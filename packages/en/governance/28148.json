P. ABBOTT\r\nAND GEO. M. LOOMIS,\r\n\r\nIn the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States, for\r\nthe Southern District of Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is now but one great question dividing the American people, and\r\nthat, to the great danger of the stability of our government, the\r\nconcord and harmony of our citizens, and the perpetuation of our\r\nliberties, divides us by a geographical line. Hence estrangement,\r\nalienation, enmity, have arisen between the North and the South, and\r\nthose who, from \"the times that tried men's souls,\" have stood shoulder\r\nto shoulder in asserting their rights against the world; who, as a band\r\nof brothers, had combined to build up this fair fabric of human liberty,\r\nare now almost in the act of turning their fratricidal arms against each\r\nother's bosoms. All other parties that have existed in our country, were\r\nsegregated on questions of policy affecting the whole nation and each\r\nindividual composing it alike; they pervaded every section of the Union,\r\nand the acerbity of political strife was softened by the ties of blood,\r\nfriendship, and neighborhood association. Moreover, these parties were\r\nconstantly changing, on account of the influence mutually exerted by the\r\nmembers of each; the Federalist of yesterday becomes the Republican of\r\nto-day, and Whigs and Democrats change their party allegiance with every\r\nchange of leaders. If the republicans mismanaged the government, they\r\nsuffered the consequences alike with the federalists; if the democrats\r\nplunged our country into difficulties, they had to abide the penalty as\r\nwell as the whigs. All parties alike had to suffer the evils, or enjoy\r\nthe advantages of bad or good government. But it has been reserved to\r\nour own times to witness the rise, growth, and prevalence of a party\r\nconfined exclusively to one section of the Union, whose fundamental\r\nprinciple is opposition to the rights and interests of the other\r\nsection; and this, too, when those rights are most sacredly guaranteed,\r\nand those interests protected, by that compact under which we became a\r\nunited nation. In a free government like ours, the eclecticism of\r\nparties--by which we mean the affinity by which the members of a party\r\nunite on questions of national policy, by which all sections of the\r\ncountry are alike affected--has always been considered as highly\r\nconducive to the purity and integrity of the government, and one of the\r\ncauses most promotive of its perpetuity. Such has been the case, not\r\nonly in our own country, but also in England, from whom we have mainly\r\nderived our ideas of civil and religious liberty, and even, to some\r\nextent, our form of government. But there, the case of oppressed and\r\ndown-trodden Ireland, bears witness to the baneful effects of\r\ngeographical partizan government and legislation.\r\n\r\nIn our own country this same spirit, which had its origin in the\r\nMissouri contest, is now beginning to produce its legitimate fruits:\r\nwitness the growing distrust with which the people of the North and the\r\nSouth begin to regard each other; the diminution of Southern travel,\r\neither for business or pleasure, in the Northern States; the efforts of\r\neach section to develop its own resources, so as virtually to render it\r\nindependent of the other; the enactment of \"unfriendly legislation,\" in\r\nseveral of the States, towards other States of the Union, or their\r\ncitizens; the contest for the exclusive possession of the territories,\r\nthe common property of the States; the anarchy and bloodshed in Kansas;\r\nthe exasperation of parties throughout the Union; the attempt to\r\nnullify, by popular clamor, the decision of the supreme tribunal of our\r\ncountry; the existence of the \"underground railroad,\" and of a party in\r\nthe North organized for the express purpose of robbing the citizens of\r\nthe Southern States of their property; the almost daily occurrence of\r\nfugitive slave mobs; the total insecurity of slave property in the\r\nborder States;[1] the attempt to circulate incendiary documents among\r\nthe slaves in the Southern States, and the flooding of the whole country\r\nwith the most false and malicious misrepresentations of the state of\r\nsociety in the slave States; the attempt to produce division among us,\r\nand to array one portion of our citizens in deadly hostility to the\r\nother; and finally, the recent attempt to excite, at Harper's Ferry, and\r\nthroughout the South, an insurrection, and a civil and servile war, with\r\nall its attendant horrors.\r\n\r\nAll these facts go to prove that there is a great wrong somewhere, and\r\nthat a part, or the whole, of the American people are demented, and\r\nhurrying down to swift destruction. To ascertain where this great wrong\r\nand evil lies, to point out the remedy, to disabuse the public mind of\r\nall erroneous impressions or prejudices, to combat all false doctrines\r\non _this_ subject, and to establish the truth, shall be the aim of the\r\nfollowing pages. In preparing them we have consulted the works of most\r\nof the writers on both sides of this question, as well as the statistics\r\nand history tending to throw light upon the subject. To this we would\r\ninvite the candid and dispassionate attention of every patriot and\r\nphilanthropist. To all such we would say, in the language of the Roman\r\nbard,\r\n\r\n          \"Si quid novisti vectius istis,\r\n           Candidus imperti; si non,\r\n           His utere mecum.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following pages, the words slave and slavery are not used in the\r\nsense commonly understood by the abolitionists. With them these terms\r\nare contradistinguished from servants and servitude. According to their\r\ndefinition, a slave is merely a \"chattel\" in a human form; a _thing_ to\r\nbe bought and sold, and treated worse than a brute; a being without\r\nrights, privileges, or duties. Now, if this is a correct definition of\r\nthe word, we totally object to the term, and deny that we have any such\r\ninstitution as _slavery_ among us. We recognize among us no class,\r\nwhich, as the abolitionists falsely assert, that the Supreme Court\r\ndecided \"had no rights which a white man was bound to respect.\" The\r\nwords _slave_ and _servant_ are perfectly synonymous, and differ only in\r\nbeing derived from different languages; the one from Sclavonic, the\r\nother from the Latin, just as feminine and womanly are respectively of\r\nLatin and Saxon origin. The Saxon synonym _thrall_ has become obsolete\r\nin our language, but some of its derivations, as thralldom, are still in\r\nuse. In Greek the same idea was expressed by _doulos_, and in Hebrew by\r\n_ebed_. The one idea of servitude, or of obedience to the will of\r\nanother, is accurately expressed by all these terms. He who wishes to\r\nsee this topic thoroughly examined, may consult \"Fletcher's Studies on\r\nSlavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe word _slavery_ is used in the following discussions, to express the\r\ncondition of the _African race_ in our Southern States, as also in other\r\nparts of the world, and in other times. This word, as defined by most\r\nwriters, does not truly express the relation which the African race in\r\nour country, _now_ bears to the white race. In some parts of the world,\r\nthe relation has essentially changed, while the word to express it has\r\nremained the same. In most countries of the world, especially in former\r\ntimes, the _persons_ of the slaves were the absolute property of the\r\nmaster, and might be used or abused, as caprice or passion might\r\ndictate. Under the Jewish law, a slave might be beaten to death by his\r\nmaster, and yet the master go entirely unpunished, unless the slave died\r\noutright under his hand. Under the Roman law, slaves had no rights\r\nwhatever, and were scarcely recognized as human beings; indeed, they\r\nwere sometimes drowned in fish-ponds, to feed the eels. Such is not the\r\nlabor system among us. As an example of faulty definition, we will\r\nadduce that of Paley: \"Slavery,\" says he, \"is an obligation to labor for\r\nthe benefit of the master, without the contract or consent of the\r\nservant.\" Waiving, for the present, the accuracy of this definition, as\r\nfar as it goes, we would remark that it is only half of the definition;\r\nthe only idea here conveyed is that of compulsory and unrequited labor.\r\nSuch is not our labor-system. Though we prefer the term slave, yet if\r\nthis be its true definition, we must protest against its being applied\r\nto our system of African servitude, and insist that some other term\r\nshall be used. The true definition of the term, as applicable to the\r\ndomestic institution in the Southern States, is as follows: Slavery is\r\nthe duty and obligation of the slave to labor for the mutual benefit of\r\nboth master and slave, under a warrant to the slave of protection, and a\r\ncomfortable subsistence, under all circumstances. The person of the\r\nslave is not property, no matter what the fictions of the law may say;\r\nbut the right to his labor is property, and may be transferred like any\r\nother property, or as the right to the services of a minor or an\r\napprentice may be transferred. Nor is the labor of the slave solely for\r\nthe benefit of the master, but for the benefit of all concerned; for\r\nhimself, to repay the advances made for his support in childhood, for\r\npresent subsistence, and for guardianship and protection, and to\r\naccumulate a fund for sickness, disability, and old age. The master, as\r\nthe head of the system, has a right to the obedience and labor of the\r\nslave, but the slave has also his mutual rights in the master; the right\r\nof protection, the right of counsel and guidance, the right of\r\nsubsistence, the right of care and attention in sickness and old age. He\r\nhas also a right in his master as the sole arbiter in all his wrongs and\r\ndifficulties, and as a merciful judge and dispenser of law to award the\r\npenalty of his misdeeds. Such is American slavery, or as Mr. Henry\r\nHughes happily terms it, \"Warranteeism.\"\r\n\r\nIn order that the subject of American slavery may be thoroughly\r\ndiscussed, we have availed ourselves of the labors of several of the\r\nablest writers in the Union. These have been taken, not from one section\r\nonly, but from both sections of our country. It is true, most of them\r\nare citizens of the Southern States, and for this there is a good and\r\nobvious reason; no one can correctly discuss this subject, or any other,\r\nwho is practically unacquainted with it. This was the error of the\r\nFrench nation, when they undertook to legislate the African savages of\r\nSt. Domingo into free citizens of the model republic; of the English\r\nnation when they undertook to interfere in the internal affairs of\r\ntheir colonies; and thus must it always be, when men undertake to think\r\nor write, or act, in reference to any subject, of whose fundamental\r\ntruths, they are profoundly ignorant. It is true, that in every part of\r\nthe civilized world there are noble minds, rising superior to the\r\nprejudices of education, and the influence of the society in which they\r\nare placed, and defending the truth for its own sake; to all such we\r\nrender their due homage.\r\n\r\nIt is objected to the defenders of American slavery, that they have\r\nchanged their ground; that from being apologists for it as an inevitable\r\nevil, they have become its defenders as a social and political good,\r\nmorally right, and sanctioned by the Bible and by God himself. This\r\ncharge is unjust, as by reference to a few historical facts will\r\nabundantly appear. The present slave States had little or no agency in\r\nthe first introduction of Africans into this country; this was achieved\r\nby the Northern commercial States and by Great Britain. Wherever the\r\nclimate suited the negro constitution, slavery was profitable and\r\nflourished; where the climate was unsuitable, slavery was unprofitable,\r\nand died out. Most of the slaves in the Northern States were sent\r\nsouthward to a more congenial clime. Upon the introduction into Congress\r\nof the first abolition discussions, by John Quincy Adams, and Joshua\r\nGiddings, Southern men altogether refused to engage in the debate, or\r\neven to receive petitions on the subject. They averred that no good\r\ncould grow out of it, but only unmitigated evil.\r\n\r\nThe agitation of the abolition question had commenced in France during\r\nthe horrors of her first revolution, under the auspices of the Red\r\nRepublicans; it had pervaded England until it achieved the ruin of her\r\nWest India colonies, and by anti-slavery missionaries it had been\r\nintroduced into our Northern States. During all this agitation the\r\nSouthern States had been quietly minding their own business, regardless\r\nof all the turmoil abroad. They had never investigated the subject\r\ntheoretically, but they were well acquainted with all its practical\r\nworkings. They had received from Africa a few hundred thousand pagan\r\nsavages, and had developed them into millions of civilized Christians,\r\nhappy in themselves, and useful to the world. They had never made the\r\ninquiry whether the system were fundamentally wrong, but they judged it\r\nby its fruits, which were beneficent to all. When therefore they were\r\ncharged with upholding a moral, social, and political evil; and its\r\nimmediate abolition was demanded, as a matter not only of policy, but\r\nalso of justice and right, their reply was, we have never investigated\r\nthe subject. Our fathers left it to us as a legacy, we have grown up\r\nwith it; it has grown with our growth, and strengthened with our\r\nstrength, until it is now incorporated with every fibre of our social\r\nand political existence. What you say concerning its evils _may_ be true\r\nor false, but we clearly see that your remedy involves a vastly greater\r\nevil, to the slave, to the master, to our common country, and to the\r\nworld. We understand the nature of the negro race; and in the relation\r\nin which the providence of God has placed them to us, they are happy and\r\nuseful members of society, and are fast rising in the scale of\r\nintelligence and civilization, and the time may come when they will be\r\ncapable of enjoying the blessings of freedom and self-government. We are\r\ninstructing them in the principles of our common Christianity, and in\r\nmany instances have already taught them to read the word of life. But we\r\nknow that the time has not yet come; that this liberty which is a\r\nblessing to _us_, would be a curse to _them_. Besides, to us and to you,\r\nsuch a violent disruption would be most disastrous, it would topple to\r\nits foundations the whole social and political edifice. Moreover, we\r\nhave had warning on this subject. God, in his providence, has permitted\r\nthe emancipation of the African race in a few of the islands contiguous\r\nto our shores, and far from being elevated thereby to the condition of\r\nChristian freemen, they have rapidly retrograded to the state of pagan\r\nsavages. The value of property in those islands has rapidly depreciated,\r\ntheir production has vastly diminished, and their commerce and\r\nusefulness to the world is destroyed. We wish not to subject either\r\nourselves or our dependents to such a fate. God has placed them in our\r\nhands, and he holds us responsible for our course of policy towards\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis courteous, common-sense, and practical reply, far from closing the\r\nmouths of the agitators, only encouraged them to redouble their\r\nexertions, and to imbitter the epithets which they hurled at the\r\nslave-holders. They exhausted the vocabulary of billingsgate in\r\ndenouncing those guilty of this most henious of all sins, and charged\r\nthem in plain terms, with being _afraid_ to investigate or to discuss\r\nthe subject. Thus goaded into it, many commenced the investigation. Then\r\nfor the first time did the Southern people take a position on this\r\nsubject. It is due to a citizen of this State, the Rev. J. Smylie, to\r\nsay that he was the first to promulgate the truth, as deduced from the\r\nBible, on the subject of slavery. He was followed by a host of others,\r\nwho discussed it not only in the light of revelation and morals, but as\r\nconsistent with the Federal Constitution and the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; until many of those who had commenced their career of\r\nabolition agitation by reasoning from the Bible and the Constitution,\r\nwere compelled to acknowledge that they both were hopelessly\r\npro-slavery, and to cry: \"give us an anti-slavery constitution, an\r\nanti-slavery Bible, and an anti-slavery God.\" To such straits are men\r\nreduced by fanaticism. It is here worthy of remark, that most of the\r\nearly abolition propagandists, many of whom commenced as Christian\r\nministers, have ended in downright infidelity. Let us then hear no more\r\nof this charge, that the defenders of slavery have changed their ground;\r\nit is the abolitionists who have been compelled to appeal to \"a higher\r\nlaw,\" not only than the Federal Constitution, but also, than the law of\r\nGod. This is the inevitable result when men undertake to be \"wise above\r\nwhat is written.\" The Apostle, in the Epistle to Timothy, has not only\r\nexplicitly laid down the law on the subject of slavery, but has, with\r\nprophetic vision, drawn the exact portrait of our modern abolitionists.\r\n\r\n\"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters\r\nworthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not\r\nblasphemed. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise\r\nthem, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because\r\nthey are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things\r\nteach and exhort. If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to\r\nwholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the\r\ndoctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing,\r\nbut doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy,\r\nstrife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings, of men of\r\ncorrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is\r\ngodliness; from such withdraw thyself.\"\r\n\r\nCan any words more accurately and vividly portray the character and\r\nconduct of the abolitionists, or more plainly point out the results of\r\ntheir efforts? Is it any wonder that after having received such a\r\ncastigation, they should totally repudiate the authority of God's law,\r\nand say, \"Not _thy_ will, but _mine_ be done.\" It is here explicitly\r\ndeclared that this doctrine, the obedience of slaves to their masters,\r\nare the words of our Lord Jesus Christ; and the arguments of its\r\nopposers are characterized as doting sillily about questions and strifes\r\nof words, and therefore unworthy of reply and refutation. But the\r\nconsequences are more serious; look at the catalogue. Envy, the root of\r\nthe evil; strife, see the divisions in our churches, and in our\r\npolitical communities; railings, their calling slaveholders robbers,\r\nthieves, murderers, outlaws; evil surmisings, can any good thing come\r\nout of Nazareth, or from the Slave States? Perverse disputings of men of\r\ncorrupt minds, their wresting the Scriptures from their plain and\r\nobvious meaning to compel them to teach abolitionism. Finally; the duty\r\nof all Christians: from such withdraw thyself.\r\n\r\nThe monographs embraced in this compendium of discussions on slavery,\r\nwere written at different periods; some of them several years ago, and\r\nsome of them were prepared expressly for this work, and some have been\r\nre-written in order to continue the subject down to the present time.\r\nThere is this further advantage in combining works of different dates,\r\nthat by comparing them it is evident that the earlier and later writers\r\nboth stood on, substantially, the same ground, and take the same general\r\nviews of the institution. The charge of inconsistency must, therefore,\r\nfall to the ground. To the reading public, most of the matter contained\r\nin these pages will be new; as, though some of them have been before the\r\npublic for several years, they have had but a limited circulation, no\r\nefforts having been made by the Southern people to scatter them\r\nbroadcast throughout the land, in the form of _Sunday school books_, or\r\n_religious tracts_. Nor will it be expected by the reader, that the\r\nauthors of the works on the different topics embraced in this\r\ndiscussion, should have been able to confine their arguments strictly\r\nwithin the assigned limits. The subjects themselves so inosculate, that\r\nit would be strange indeed if the writers should not occasionally\r\nencroach upon each other's province; but even this, from the variety of\r\nargument, and mode of illustration, will be found interesting.\r\n\r\nThe work of Professor Christy, on the Economical Relations of Slavery,\r\ncontains a large amount of the most accurate, valuable and well arranged\r\nstatistical matter, and his combinations and deductions are remarkable\r\nfor their philosophical accuracy. He spent several years in the service\r\nof the American Colonization Society, as agent for Ohio, and made\r\nhimself thoroughly acquainted with the results, both to the blacks and\r\nwhites, both of slavery and emancipation.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hammond is too well known, as an eminent statesman and\r\npolitical writer, to require notice here. His letters are addressed to\r\nMr. Clarkson, of England, who, in conjunction with Wilberforce, after a\r\nlong struggle, at last secured the passage, by the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain, of acts to abolish the slave trade and slavery, in the British\r\nWest India colonies. The results of this are vividly portrayed by the\r\nauthor, and his predictions are now history.\r\n\r\nChancellor Harper, with a master hand, draws a parallel between the\r\nsocial condition of communities where slave labor exists and where it\r\ndoes not, and vindicates the South from the aspersions cast upon her.\r\n\r\nDr. Bledsoe's \"Liberty and Slavery,\" or Slavery in the Light of Moral\r\nScience, discusses the right or wrong of slavery, exposes the fallacies,\r\nand answers the arguments of the abolitionists. His established\r\nreputation as an accurate reasoner, and a forcible writer, guarantees\r\nthe excellence of this work.\r\n\r\nDr. Stringfellow's Slavery in the Light of Divine Revelation, and Dr.\r\nHodge's Bible Argument on Slavery, form a synopsis of the whole\r\ntheological argument on the subject. The plain and obvious teachings, of\r\nboth Old and New Testament, are given with such irresistible force as to\r\ncarry conviction to every mind, except those wedded to the theory of a\r\n\"Higher Law\" than the Law of God.\r\n\r\nDr. Cartwright's \"Ethnology of the African Race,\" are the results of the\r\nobservation and experience of a lifetime, spent in an extensive practice\r\nof medicine in the midst of the race. He has had the best of\r\nopportunities for becoming intimately acquainted with all the\r\nidiosyncrasies of this race, and he has well improved them. That the\r\nnegro is _now_ an inferior species, or at least variety of the human\r\nrace, is well established, and must, we think, be admitted by all. That\r\nby himself he has never emerged from barbarism, and even when partly\r\ncivilized under the control of the white man, he speedily returns to the\r\nsame state, if emancipated, are now indubitable truths. Whether or not,\r\nunder our system of slavery, he can ever be so elevated as to be worthy\r\nof freedom, time and the providence of God alone can determine. The most\r\nencouraging results have already been achieved by American slavery, in\r\nthe elevation of the negro race in our midst; as they are now as far\r\nsuperior to the natives of Africa, as the whites are to them. In a\r\nreligious point of view, also, there is great encouragement, as there\r\nare twice as many communicants of Christian churches among our slaves,\r\nas there are among the heathen at all the missionary stations in the\r\nworld. (See Prof. Christy's statistics in this volume.) What the negroes\r\nmight have been, but for the interference of the abolitionists, it is\r\nimpossible to conjecture. That their influence has only been unmitigated\r\nevil, we have the united testimony, both of themselves and of the slave\r\nholders. (See Dr. Beecher's late sermon on the Harper's Ferry trials.)\r\n\r\nTo show what has been the uniform course of Christians in the South\r\ntowards the slaves, we will quote from the first pastoral letter of the\r\nSynod of the Carolinas and Georgia, to the churches under their care.\r\n\r\nAfter addressing husbands and wives, parents and children, on their\r\nrelative duties, the Synod continues, \"But parents and heads of\r\nfamilies, think it not surprising that we inform you that God has\r\ncommitted others to your care, besides your natural offspring, in the\r\nwelfare of whose souls you are also deeply interested, and whose\r\nsalvation you are bound to endeavor to promote--we mean your slaves;\r\npoor creatures! shall they be bound for life, and their owners never\r\nonce attempt to deliver their souls from the bondage of sin, nor point\r\nthem to eternal freedom through the blood of the Son of God! On this\r\nsubject we beg leave to submit to your consideration the conduct of\r\nAbraham, the father of the faithful, through whose example is\r\ncommunicated unto you the commandment of God (Gen. xviii: 19); 'For I\r\nknow him,' says God, 'that he will command his children and his\r\nhousehold after him, that they shall keep the ways of the Lord, to do\r\njustice and judgment.'\r\n\r\n\"Masters and servants, attend to your duty--in the express language of\r\nthe Holy Ghost--'servants, obey your masters in all things; not with eye\r\nservice, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God; and\r\nwhatsoever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to man. And\r\nyou, masters, render to your servants their due, knowing that your\r\nmaster is also in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with Him.'\r\nAnd let those who govern, and those who are governed, make the object of\r\nliving in this world be, to prepare to meet your God and judge, when all\r\nshall stand on a level before His bar, and receive their decisive\r\nsentence according to the deeds done in the body.\r\n\r\n\"Servants, be willing to receive instruction, and discourage not your\r\nmasters by your stubbornness or aversion. Remember, the interest is your\r\nown, and if you be wise, it will be for your own good; _spend the\r\nSabbath in learning to read, and in teaching your young ones_, instead\r\nof rambling abroad from place to place; a few years will give you many\r\nSabbaths, which, if rightly improved, will be sufficient for the\r\npurpose. Attend, also, on public worship, when you have opportunity, and\r\nbehave there with decency and good order.\r\n\r\n\"Were these relative duties conscientiously practiced, by husbands and\r\nwives, parents and children, masters and servants, how pleasing would be\r\nthe sight; expressing by your conduct pious Joshua's resolution, as for\r\nme and my house, we will serve the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nThe argument on slavery, deduced from the law of nations, we commend to\r\nthe special attention of the candid reader. Indeed, it is from the\r\nrecognition of the duty of the various races and nations composing the\r\nhuman family, to contribute their part for the advancement and good of\r\nthe whole, not only that slavery has existed in all ages, but also that\r\nefforts have been, and are now being made, to extend the benefits of\r\ncivilization and religion to the benighted races of the earth. This has\r\nbeen done in two different ways; one by sending the teacher forth to the\r\nheathen, the other by bringing the heathen to the teacher. Both have\r\nachieved great good, but the latter has been the more successful. Though\r\nthe principles embraced in this general law of nations have been\r\nacknowledged and acted out in all times, it is due to J. Q.

Its\r\nfavorable reception led to further investigation, and an enlargement of\r\nthe work for a second edition.\r\n\r\nThe present publishers have bought the copyright of the third edition,\r\nwith the privilege of printing it in the form and manner that may best\r\nsuit their purposes. This step severs the author from all further\r\nconnection with the work, and affords him an opportunity of stating a\r\nfew of the facts which led, originally, to its production. He was\r\nconnected with the newspaper press, as an editor, from 1824 till 1836.\r\nThis included the period of the tariff controversy, and the rise of the\r\nanti-slavery party of this country. After resigning the editorial chair,\r\nhe still remained associated with public affairs, so as to afford him\r\nopportunities of observing the progress of events. In 1848 he accepted\r\nan appointment as Agent of the American Colonization Society, for Ohio;\r\nand was thus brought directly into contact with the elements of\r\nagitation upon the slavery question, in the aspect which that\r\ncontroversy had then assumed. Upon visiting Columbus, the seat of\r\ngovernment of the State, in January, 1849, the Legislature, then in\r\nsession, was found in great, agitation about the repeal of the Black\r\nLaws, which had originally been enacted to prevent the immigration of\r\ncolored men into the State. The abolitionists held the balance of\r\npower, and were uncompromising in their demands. To escape from the\r\ndifficulty, and prevent all future agitation upon the subject,\r\npoliticians united in erasing this cause of disturbance from the statute\r\nbook. The colored people had been in convention at the capitol; and felt\r\nthemselves in a position, as they imagined, to control the legislation\r\nof the State. They were encouraged in this belief by the abolitionists,\r\nand proceeded to effect an organization by which black men were to\r\n_stump_ the State in advocacy of their claims to an equality with white\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the Colonization cause was brought before the\r\nLegislature, by a memorial asking aid to send emigrants to Liberia. An\r\nappointment was also made, by the agent, for a Lecture on Colonization,\r\nto be delivered in the hall of the House of Representatives; and\r\nrespectful notices sent to the African churches, inviting the colored\r\npeople to attend. This invitation was met by them with the publication\r\nof a call for an indignation meeting; which, on assembling, denounced\r\nboth the agent and the cause he advocated, in terms unfitted to be\r\ncopied into this work. One of the resolutions, however, has some\r\nsignificance, as foreshadowing the final action they contemplated, and\r\nwhich has shown itself so futile, as a means of redress, in the recent\r\nHarper's Ferry Tragedy. That resolution reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_,--That we will never leave this country while one of our\r\nbrethren groans in slavish fetters in the United States, but will remain\r\non this soil and contend for our rights, and those of our enslaved\r\nrace--upon the rostrum--in the pulpit--in the social circle, and upon\r\nthe field, if necessary, until liberty to the captive shall be\r\nproclaimed throughout the length and breadth of this great Republic, or\r\nwe called from time to eternity.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1850, Mr. Stanley's proposition, to Congress, for the\r\nappropriation of the last installment of the Surplus Revenue to\r\nColonization, was laid before the Ohio Legislature for approval. The\r\ncolored people again held meetings, denouncing this proposition also,\r\nand the following resolutions, among others, were adopted--the first at\r\nColumbus and the second at Cincinnati:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_,--That it is our unalterable and eternal determination, as\r\nheretofore expressed, to remain in the United States at all hazards, and\r\nto 'buffet the withering flood of prejudice and misrule,' which menaces\r\nour destruction until we are exalted, to ride triumphantly upon its\r\nfoaming billows, or honorably sink into its destroying vortex: although\r\ninducements may be held out for us to emigrate, in the shape of odious\r\nand oppressive laws, or liberal appropriations.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_,--That we should labor diligently to secure--first, the\r\nabolition of slavery, and, failing in this, the separation of the\r\nStates; one or the other event being necessary to our ever enjoying in\r\nits fullness and power, the privilege of an American citizen.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, some three or four years later, on the occasion of the formation\r\nof the Ohio State Colonization Society, another meeting was called, in\r\nopposition to Colonization, in the city of Cincinnati, which, among\r\nothers, passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_,--That in our opinion the emancipation and elevation of our\r\nenslaved brethren depends in a great measure upon their brethren who are\r\nfree, remaining in the country; and we will remain to be that 'agitating\r\nelement' in American politics, which Mr Wise, in a late letter,\r\nconcludes, has done so much for the slave.\"\r\n\r\nMany similar resolutions might be quoted, all manifesting a\r\ndetermination, on the part of the colored people, to maintain their\r\nfoothold in the United States, until the freedom of the slave should be\r\neffected; and indicating an expectation, on their part, that this result\r\nwould be brought about by an insurrection, in which they expected to\r\ntake a prominent part. In this policy they were encouraged by nearly all\r\nthe opponents of Colonization, but especially by the active members of\r\nthe organizations for running off slaves to Canada.\r\n\r\nTo meet this state of things, COTTON IS KING was written. The mad folly\r\nof the Burns' case, at Boston, in 1854, proved, conclusively, that white\r\nmen, by the thousand, stood prepared to provoke a collision between the\r\nNorth and the South. The eight hundred men who volunteered at Worcester,\r\nand proceeded to Boston, on that occasion, with banner flying, showed\r\nthat such a condition of public sentiment prevailed; while, at the same\r\ntime, the sudden dispersion of that valorous army, by a single officer\r\nof the general government, who, unaided, captured their leader and bore\r\noff their banner, proved, as conclusively, that such philanthropists are\r\nnot soldiers--that promiscuous crowds of undisciplined men are wholly\r\nunreliable in the hour of danger.\r\n\r\nThe author would here repeat, then, that the main object he had in view,\r\nin the preparation of COTTON IS KING, was to convince the abolitionists\r\nof the utter failure of their plans, and that the policy they had\r\nadopted was productive of results, the opposite of what they wished to\r\neffect;--that British and American abolitionists, in destroying tropical\r\ncultivation by emancipation in the West Indies, and opposing its\r\npromotion in Africa by Colonization, had given to slavery in the United\r\nStates its prosperity and its power;--that the institution was no longer\r\nto be controlled by moral or physical force, but had become wholly\r\nsubject to the laws of Political Economy;--and that, therefore, labor in\r\ntropical countries, to supply tropical products to commerce, and not\r\ninsurrection in the United States, was the agency to be employed by\r\nthose who would successfully oppose the extension of American Slavery:\r\nfor, just as long as the hands of the free should persist in refusing to\r\nsupply the demands of commerce for cotton, just so long it would\r\ncontinue to be obtained from those of the slave.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in the perusal of the present edition, that Great\r\nBritain, in her efforts to promote cotton cultivation in India and\r\nAfrica, now acts upon this principle, and that she thereby acknowledges\r\nthe truth of the views which the author has advanced. It will be seen\r\nalso, that to check American slavery and prevent a renewal of the slave\r\ntrade by American planters, she has even determined to employ the slaves\r\nof Africa in the production of cotton: that is to say, the slavery of\r\nAmerica is to be opposed by arraying against it the slavery of\r\nAfrica--the petty chiefs there being required to force their slaves to\r\nthe cotton patches, that the masters here may find a diminishing market\r\nfor the products of their plantations.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be remarked, that the author has had many\r\nopportunities of conversing with colored men, on the subject of\r\nemigration to Africa, and they have almost uniformly opposed it on the\r\nground that they would be needed here. Some of them, in defending their\r\nconduct, revealed the grounds of their hopes. But details on this point\r\nare unnecessary. The subject is referred to, only as affording an\r\nillustration of the extent to which ignorant men may become the victims\r\nof dangerous delusions. The sum of the matter was about this: the\r\ncolored people, they said, had organizations extending from Canada to\r\nLouisiana, by means of which information could be communicated\r\nthroughout the South, when the blow for freedom was to be struck.\r\nPhilanthropic white men were expected to take sides against the\r\noppressor, while those occupying neutral ground would offer no\r\nresistance to the passage of forces from Canada and Ohio to Virginia and\r\nKentucky. Once upon slave territory, they imagined the work of\r\nemancipation would be easily executed, as every slave would rush to the\r\nstandard of freedom.\r\n\r\nThese schemes of the colored people were viewed, at the time, as the\r\nvagaries of over excited and ignorant minds, dreaming of the repetition\r\nof Egyptian miracles for their deliverance; and were subjects of regret,\r\nonly because they operated as barriers to Colonization. But when a\r\nfriend placed in the author's hand, a few days since, a copy of the\r\n_Chatham_ (Canada West) _Weekly Pilot_, of October 13, he could see that\r\nthe seed sown at Columbus in 1849, had yielded its harvest of bitterness\r\nand disappointment at Harper's Ferry in 1859. That paper contained the\r\nproceedings and resolutions of the colored men, at Chatham, on the 3d of\r\nthat month, in which the annexed resolution was included:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_,--That in view of the fact that a crisis will soon occur in\r\nthe United States to affect our friends and countrymen there, we feel it\r\nthe duty of every colored person to make the Canadas their homes. The\r\ntemperature and salubrity of the climate, and the productiveness and\r\nfertility of the soil afford ample field for their encouragement. To\r\nhail their enslaved bondmen upon their deliverance, in the glorious\r\nkingdom of British Liberty, in the Canadas, we cordially invite the free\r\nand the bond, the noble and the ignoble--we have no 'Dred Scott Law.'\"\r\n\r\nThe occasion which called out this resolution, together with a number of\r\nothers, was the delivery of a lecture, on the 3d of October last, by an\r\nagent from Jamaica, who urged them to emigrate to that beautiful island.\r\nThe import of this resolution will be better understood, when it is\r\nremembered, that the organization of Brown's insurrectionary scheme took\r\nplace, in this same city of Chatham, on the 8th of May last. The\r\n\"crisis\" which was soon to occur in the United States, and the\r\nimportance of every colored man remaining at his post, at that\r\nparticular juncture, as urged by the resolutions, all indicate, very\r\nclearly, that Brown's movements were known to the leaders of the\r\nmeeting, and that they desired to co-operate in the movement. The\r\nspirit breathed by the whole series of the Chatham resolutions, is so\r\nfully in accord with those passed from time to time in the United\r\nStates, that there is no difficulty in perceiving that the views,\r\nexpectations, and hopes of the colored people of both countries have\r\nbeen the same. The Chatham meeting was on the night of the 3d October,\r\nand the outbreak of Brown on that of the 16th.\r\n\r\nBut the failure of the Harper's Ferry movement should now serve as\r\nconvincing proof, that nothing can be gained, by such means, for the\r\nAfrican race. No successful organization, for their deliverance, can be\r\neffected in this country; and foreign aid is out of the question, not\r\nonly because foreign nations will not wage war for a philanthropic\r\nobject, but because they cannot do without our cotton for a single year.\r\nThey are very much in the condition of our Northern politicians, since\r\nthe old party landmarks have been broken down. The slavery question is\r\nthe only one left, upon which any enthusiasm can be awakened among the\r\npeople. The negro is to American politics what cotton is to European\r\nmanufactures and commerce--the controlling element. As the overthrow of\r\nAmerican slavery, with the consequent suspension of the motion of the\r\nspindles and looms of Europe, would bring ruin upon millions of its\r\npopulation; so the dropping of the negro question, in American politics,\r\nwould at once destroy the prospects of thousands of aspirants to office.\r\nIn ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the clamor against slavery is\r\nmade only for effect; and there is not now, nor has there been at any\r\nother period, any intention on the part of political agitators to wage\r\nactual war against the slave States themselves. But while the author\r\nbelieves that no intention of exciting to insurrection ever existed\r\namong leading politicians at the North, he must express the opinion that\r\nevil has grown out of the policy they have pursued, as it has excited\r\nthe free negro to attempts at insurrection, by leading him to believe\r\nthat they were in earnest in their professions of prosecuting the\r\n\"irrepressible conflict,\" between freedom and slavery, to a termination\r\ndestructive to the South; and, lured by this hope, he has been led to\r\nconsider it his duty, as a man, to stand prepared for Mr Jefferson's\r\ncrisis, in which Omnipotence would be arrayed upon his side. This stand\r\nhe has been induced to take from principles of honor, instead of seeking\r\nnew fields of enterprise in which to better his condition.\r\n\r\nBut there is another evil to the colored man, which has grown out of\r\nnorthern agitation on the question of slavery. The controversy is one of\r\nsuch a peculiar nature, that any needed modification of it can be made,\r\nby politicians, to suit whatever emergency may arise. The Burns' case\r\nconvinced them that many men, white and black, were then prepared for\r\ntreason. This was a step, however, that voters at large disapproved;\r\nand, not only was it unpopular to advocate the forcing of emancipation\r\nupon the slave States, but it seemed equally repugnant to the people to\r\nhave the North filled with free negroes. The free colored man was,\r\ntherefore, given to understand, that slavery was not to be disturbed in\r\nthe States where it had been already established. But this was not all.\r\nHe had to have another lesson in the philosophy of _dissolving scenes_,\r\nas exhibited in the great political magic lantern. Nearly all the\r\nWestern States had denied him an equality with the white man, in the\r\nadoption or modification of their constitutions. He looked to Kansas for\r\njustice, and lo! it came. The first constitution, adopted by the free\r\nState men of that territory, excluded the free colored man from the\r\nrights of citizenship! \"Why is this,\" said the author, to a leading\r\nGerman politician of Cincinnati: \"why have the free State men excluded\r\nthe free colored people from the proposed State?\" \"Oh,\" he replied, \"we\r\nwant it for our sons--for white men,--and we want the _nigger_ out of\r\nour way: we neither want him there as a slave or freeman, as in either\r\ncase his presence tends to degrade labor.\" This is not all. Nearly every\r\nslave State is legislating the free colored men out of their bounds, as\r\na \"disturbing element\" which their people are determined no longer to\r\ntolerate. Here, then, is the result of the efforts of the free colored\r\nman to sustain himself in the midst of the whites; and here is the evil\r\nthat political agitation has brought upon him.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the author believes he will be performing a\r\nuseful service, in bringing the question of the economical relations of\r\nAmerican slavery, once more, prominently before the public. It is time\r\nthat the true character of the negro race, as compared with the white,\r\nin productive industry, should be determined. If the negro, as a\r\nvoluntary laborer, is the equal of the white man, as the abolitionists\r\ncontend, then, set him to work in tropical cultivation, and he can\r\naccomplish something for his race; but if he is incapable of competing\r\nwith the white man, except in compulsory labor,--as slaveholders most\r\nsincerely believe the history of the race fully demonstrates--then let\r\nthe truth be understood by the world, and all efforts for his elevation\r\nbe directed to the accomplishment of the separation of the races.\r\nBecause, until the colored men, who are now free, shall afford the\r\nevidence that freedom is best for the race, those held in slavery cannot\r\nescape from their condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nSome new and important facts in relation to the results of West India\r\nemancipation are presented, which show, beyond question, that the\r\nadvancing productiveness, claimed for these islands, is not due to any\r\nimprovement in the industrial habits of the negroes, but is the result,\r\nwholly, of the introduction of immigrant labor from abroad. No\r\nadvancement, of any consequence, has been made where immigrants have not\r\nbeen largely imported; and in Jamaica, which has received but few, there\r\nis a large decline in production from what existed during even the first\r\nyears of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe present edition embraces a considerable amount of new matter, having\r\na bearing on the condition of the cotton question, and a few other\r\npoints of public interest. Several new Statistical Tables have been\r\nadded to the appendix, that are necessary to the illustration of the\r\ntopics discussed; and some historical matter also, in illustration of\r\nthe early history of slavery in the United States.\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI, JANUARY 1, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"COTTON IS KING\" has been received, generally, with much favor by the\r\npublic. The author's name having been withheld, the book was left to\r\nstand or fall upon its own merits. The first edition has been sold\r\nwithout any special effort on the part of the publishers. As they did\r\nnot risk the cost of stereotyping, the work has been left open for\r\nrevision and enlargement. No change in the matter of the first edition\r\nhas been made, except a few verbal alterations and the addition of some\r\nqualifying phrases. Two short paragraphs only have been omitted, so as\r\nto leave the public documents and abolitionists, only, to testify as to\r\nthe moral condition of the free colored people. The matter added to the\r\npresent volume equals nearly one-fourth of the work. It relates mainly\r\nto two points: _First_, The condition of the free colored people;\r\n_Second_, The economical and political relations of slavery. The facts\r\ngiven, it is believed, will completely fortify all the positions of the\r\nauthor, on these questions, so far as his views have been assailed.\r\n\r\nThe field of investigation embraced in the book is a broad one, and the\r\nsources of information from which its facts are derived are accessible\r\nto but few. It is not surprising, then, that strangers to these facts,\r\non first seeing them arranged in their philosophical relations and\r\nlogical connection, should be startled at their import, and misconceive\r\nthe object and motives of the author.\r\n\r\nFor example: One reviewer, in noticing the first edition, asserts that\r\nthe writer \"endeavors to prove that slavery is a great blessing in its\r\nrelations to agriculture, manufactures, and commerce.\" The candid reader\r\nwill be unable to find any thing, in the pages of the work, to justify\r\nsuch an assertion. The author has proved that the products of slave\r\nlabor are in such universal demand, through the channels named by the\r\nreviewer, that it is impracticable, in the existing condition of the\r\nworld, to overthrow the system; and that as the free negro has\r\ndemonstrated his inability to engage successfully in cotton culture,\r\ntherefore American slavery remains immovable, and presents a standing\r\nmonument of the folly of those who imagined they could effect its\r\noverthrow by the measures they pursued. This was the author's aim.\r\n\r\nAnother charges, that the whole work is based on a fallacy, and that all\r\nits arguments, therefore, are unsound. The fallacy of the book, it is\r\nexplained, consists in making cotton and slavery indivisible, and\r\nteaching that cotton can not be cultivated except by slave labor;\r\nwhereas, in the opinion of the objector, that staple can be grown by\r\nfree labor. Here, again, the author is misunderstood. He only teaches\r\nwhat is true beyond all question: not that free labor is incapable of\r\nproducing cotton, but that it does not produce it so as to affect the\r\ninterests of slave labor; and that the American planter, therefore,\r\nstill finds himself in the possession of the monopoly of the market for\r\ncotton, and unable to meet the demand made upon him for that staple,\r\nexcept by a vast enlargement of its cultivation, requiring the\r\nemployment of an increased amount of labor in its production.\r\n\r\nAnother says: \"The real object of the work is an apology for American\r\nslavery. Professing to repudiate extremes, the author pleads the\r\nnecessity for the present continuance of slavery, founded on economical,\r\npolitical, and moral considerations.\" The dullest reader can not fail to\r\nperceive that the work contains not one word of apology for the\r\ninstitution of slavery, nor the slightest wish for its continuance. The\r\nauthor did not suppose that Southern slave holders would thank any\r\nNorthern man to attempt an apology for their maintaining what they\r\nconsider their rights under the constitution; neither did he imagine\r\nthat any plea for the continuance of American slavery was needed, while\r\nthe world at large is industriously engaged in supporting it by the\r\nconsumption of its products. He, therefore, neither attempted an apology\r\nfor its existence nor a plea for its continuance. He was writing history\r\nand not recording his own opinions, about which he never imagined the\r\npublic cared a fig. He was merely aiming at showing, how an institution,\r\nfeeble and ill supported in the outset, had become one of the most\r\npotent agents in the advancement of civilization, notwithstanding the\r\nopposition it has had to encounter; and that those who had attempted its\r\noverthrow, in consequence of a lack of knowledge of the plainest\r\nprinciples of political economy and of human nature in its barbarous\r\nstate, had contributed, more than any other class of persons, to produce\r\nthis result.\r\n\r\nAnother charges the author with ignorance of the recent progress making\r\nin the culture of cotton, by free labor, in India and Algeria; and\r\ncongratulates his readers that, \"on this side of the ocean, the\r\nprospects of free soil and free labor, and of free cotton as one of the\r\nproducts of free soil and free labor, were never so fair as now.\" This\r\nis a pretty fair example of one's \"whistling to keep his courage up,\"\r\nwhile passing, in the dark, through woods where he thinks ghosts are\r\nlurking on either side. Algeria has done nothing, yet, to encourage the\r\nhope that American slavery will be lessened in value by the cultivation\r\nof cotton in Africa. The British custom-house reports, as late as\r\nSeptember, 1855, instead of showing any increase of imports of cotton\r\nfrom India, it will be seen, exhibit a great falling off in its\r\nsupplies; and, in the opinion of the best authorities, extinguishes the\r\nhope of arresting the progress of American slavery by any efforts made\r\nto render Asiatic free labor more effective. As to the prospects on this\r\nside of the ocean, a glance at the map will show, that the chances of\r\ngrowing cotton in Kansas are just as good, and only as good as in\r\nIllinois and Missouri, from whence not a pound is ever exported. Texas\r\nwas careful to appropriate nearly all the cotton lands acquired from\r\nMexico, which lie on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains; and, by\r\nthat act, all such lands, mainly, have been secured to slavery. Where,\r\nthen, is free labor to operate, even were it ready for the task?\r\n\r\nAnother alleges that the book is \"a weak effort to slander the people of\r\ncolor.\" This is a charge that could have come only from a careless\r\nreader. The whole testimony, embraced in the first edition, nearly, as\r\nto the economical failure of West India Emancipation, and the moral\r\ndegradation of the free colored people, generally, is quoted from\r\nabolition authorities, as is expressly stated; not to slander the people\r\nof color, but to show them what the world is to think of them, on the\r\ntestimony of their particular friends and self-constituted guardians.\r\n\r\nAnother objects to what is said of those who hold the opinion that\r\nslavery is _malum in se_, and who yet continue to purchase and use its\r\nproducts. On this point it is only necessary to say, that the logic of\r\nthe book has not been affected by the sophistry employed against it; and\r\nthat if those who hold the _per se_ doctrine, and continue to use slave\r\nlabor products, dislike the charge of being _participes criminis_ with\r\nrobbers, they must classify slavery in some other mode than that in\r\nwhich they have placed it in their creeds. For, if they are not\r\npartakers with thieves, then slavery is not a system of robbery; but if\r\nslavery be a system of robbery, as they maintain, then, on their own\r\nprinciples, they are as much partakers with thieves as any others who\r\ndeal in stolen property.\r\n\r\nThe severest criticism on the book, however, comes from one who charges\r\nthe author with a \"disposition to mislead, or an ignorance which is\r\ninexcusable,\" in the use of the statistics of crime, having reference to\r\nthe free colored people, from 1820 to 1827. The object of the author, in\r\nusing the statistics referred to, was only to show the reasons why the\r\nscheme of colonization was then accepted, by the American public, as a\r\nmeans of relief to the colored population, and not to drag out these\r\nsorrowful facts to the disparagement of those now living. But the\r\nreviewer, suspicious of every one who does not adopt his abolition\r\nnotions, suspects the author of improper motives, and asks: \"Why go so\r\nfar back, if our author wished to treat the subject fairly?\" Well, the\r\nstatistics on this dismal topic have been brought up to the latest date\r\npracticable, and the author now leaves it to the colored people\r\nthemselves to say, whether they have gained any thing by the reviewer's\r\nzeal in their behalf. He will learn one lesson at least, we hope, from\r\nthe result: that a writer can use his pen with greater safety to his\r\nreputation, when he knows something about the subject he discusses.\r\n\r\nBut this reviewer, warming in his zeal, undertakes to philosophise, and\r\nsays, that the evils existing among the free colored people, will be\r\nfound in exact proportion to the slowness of emancipation; and complains\r\nthat New Jersey was taken as the standard, in this respect, instead of\r\nMassachusetts, where, he asserts, \"all the negroes in the commonwealth,\r\nwere, by the new constitution, liberated in a day, and none of the ill\r\nconsequences objected followed, either to the commonwealth or to\r\nindividuals.\" The reviewer is referred to the facts, in the present\r\nedition, where he will find, that the amount of crime, at the date to\r\nwhich he refers, was _six times_ greater among the colored people of\r\nMassachusetts, in proportion to their numbers, than among those of New\r\nJersey. The next time he undertakes to review KING COTTON, it will be\r\nbest for him not to rely upon his imagination, but to look at the facts.\r\nHe should be able at least, when quoting a writer, to discriminate\r\nbetween evils resulting from insurrections, and evils growing out of\r\ncommon immoralities. Experience has taught, that it is unsafe, when\r\ncalculating the results of the means of elevation employed, to reason\r\nfrom a civilized to a half civilized race of men.\r\n\r\nThe last point that needs attention, is the charge that the author is a\r\nslaveholder, and governed by mercenary motives. To break the force of\r\nany such objection to the work, and relieve it from prejudices thus\r\ncreated, the veil is lifted, and the author's name is placed upon the\r\ntitle page.\r\n\r\nThe facts and statistics used in the first edition, were brought down to\r\nthe close of 1854, mainly, and the arguments founded upon the then\r\nexisting state of things. The year 1853 was taken as best indicating the\r\nrelations of our planters and farmers to the manufactures and commerce\r\nof the country and the world; because the exports and imports of that\r\nyear were nearer an average of the commercial operations of the country\r\nthan the extraordinary year which followed; and because the author had\r\nnearly finished his labors before the results of 1854 had been\r\nascertained. In preparing the second edition for the press, many\r\nadditional facts, of a more recent date, have been introduced: all of\r\nwhich tend to prove the general accuracy of the author's conclusions, as\r\nexpressed in the first edition.\r\n\r\nTables IV and V, added to the present edition, embrace some very curious\r\nand instructive statistics, in relation to the increase and decrease of\r\nthe free colored people, in certain sections, and the influence they\r\nappear to exert on public sentiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the preparation of the following pages, the author has aimed at\r\nclearness of statement, rather than elegance of diction. He sets up no\r\nclaim to literary distinction; and even if he did, every man of\r\nclassical taste knows, that a work, abounding in facts and statistics,\r\naffords little opportunity for any display of literary ability.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care has been taken, by the author, to secure perfect\r\naccuracy in the statistical information supplied, and in all the facts\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nThe authorities consulted are Brande's Dictionary of Science, Literature\r\nand Art; Porter's Progress of the British Nation; McCullough's\r\nCommercial Dictionary; Encyclopædia Americana; London Economist; De\r\nBow's Review; Patent Office Reports; Congressional Reports on Commerce\r\nand Navigation; Abstract of the Census Reports, 1850; and Compendium of\r\nthe Census Reports. The extracts from the Debates in Congress, on the\r\nTariff Question, are copied from the _National Intelligencer_.\r\n\r\nThe tabular statements appended, bring together the principal facts,\r\nbelonging to the questions examined, in such a manner that their\r\nrelations to each other can be seen at a glance.\r\n\r\nThe first of these Tables, shows the date of the origin of cotton\r\nmanufactories in England, and the amount of cotton annually consumed,\r\ndown to 1853; the origin and amount of the exports of cotton from the\r\nUnited States to Europe; the sources of England's supplies of cotton,\r\nfrom countries other than the United States; the dates of the\r\ndiscoveries which have promoted the production and manufacture of\r\ncotton; the commencement of the movements made to meliorate the\r\ncondition of the African race; and the occurrence of events that have\r\nincreased the value of slavery, and led to its extension.\r\n\r\nThe second and third of the tables, relate to the exports and imports of\r\nthe United States; and illustrate the relations sustained by slavery, to\r\nthe other industrial interests and to the commerce of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY STATEMENTS.\r\n\r\n          Character of the Slavery controversy in the United\r\n          States--In Great Britain--Its influence in\r\n          modifying the policy of Anti-Slavery men in\r\n          America--Course of the Churches--Political\r\n          Parties--Result, COTTON IS KING--Necessity of\r\n          reviewing the policy in relation to the African\r\n          race--Topics embraced in the discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE controversy on SLAVERY, in the United States, has been one of an\r\nexciting and complicated character. The power to emancipate existing, in\r\nfact, in the States separately and not in the general government, the\r\nefforts to abolish it, by appeals to public opinion, have been fruitless\r\nexcept when confined to single States. In Great Britain the question was\r\nsimple. The power to abolish slavery in her West Indian colonies was\r\nvested in Parliament. To agitate the people of England, and call out a\r\nfull expression of sentiment, was to control Parliament and secure its\r\nabolition. The success of the English abolitionists, in the employment\r\nof moral force, had a powerful influence in modifying the policy of\r\nAmerican anti-slavery men. Failing to discern the difference in the\r\ncondition of the two countries, they attempted to create a public\r\nsentiment throughout the United States adverse to slavery, in the\r\nconfident expectation of speedily overthrowing the institution. The\r\nissue taken, that slavery is _malum in se_--a sin in itself--was\r\nprosecuted with all the zeal and eloquence they could command. Churches\r\nadopting the _sin per se_ doctrine, inquired of their converts, not\r\nwhether they supported slavery by the use of its products, but whether\r\nthey believed the institution itself sinful. Could public sentiment be\r\nbrought to assume the proper ground; could the slaveholder be convinced\r\nthat the world denounced him as equally criminal with the robber and\r\nmurderer; then, it was believed, he would abandon the system. Political\r\nparties, subsequently organized, taught, that to vote for a slaveholder,\r\nor a pro-slavery man, was sinful, and could not be done without violence\r\nto conscience; while, at the same time, they made no scruples of using\r\nthe products of slave labor--the exorbitant demand for which was the\r\ngreat bulwark of the institution. This was a radical error. It laid all\r\nwho adopted it open to the charge of practical inconsistency, and left\r\nthem without any moral power over the consciences of others. As long as\r\nall used their products, so long the slaveholders found the _per se_\r\ndoctrine working them no harm; as long as no provision was made for\r\nsupplying the demand for tropical products by free labor, so long there\r\nwas no risk in extending the field of operations. Thus, the very things\r\nnecessary to the overthrow of American slavery, were left undone, while\r\nthose essential to its prosperity, were continued in the most active\r\noperation; so that, now, after more than a thirty years' war, we may\r\nsay, emphatically, COTTON IS KING, and his enemies are vanquished.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is due to the age--to the friends of\r\nhumanity--to the cause of liberty--to the safety of the Union--that we\r\nshould review the movements made in behalf of the African race, in our\r\ncountry; so that errors of principle may be abandoned; mistakes in\r\npolicy corrected; the free colored people taught their true relations to\r\nthe industrial interests of the world; the rights of the slave as well\r\nas the master secured; and the principles of the constitution\r\nestablished and revered. It is proposed, therefore, to examine this\r\nsubject in the light of the social, civil, and commercial history of the\r\ncountry; and, in doing this, to embrace the facts and arguments under\r\nthe following heads:\r\n\r\n1. The early movements on the subject of slavery; the circumstances\r\nunder which the Colonization Society took its rise; the relations it\r\nsustained to slavery and to the schemes projected for its abolition; the\r\norigin of the elements which have given to American slavery its\r\ncommercial value and consequent powers of expansion; and the futility of\r\nthe means used to prevent the extension of the institution.\r\n\r\n2. The relations of American slavery to the industrial interests of our\r\nown country; to the demands of commerce; and to the present political\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n3. The industrial, social, and moral condition of the free colored\r\npeople in the British colonies and in the United States; and the\r\ninfluence they have exerted on public sentiment in relation to the\r\nperpetuation of slavery.\r\n\r\n4. The moral relations of persons holding the _per se_ doctrine, on the\r\nsubject of slavery, to the purchase and consumption of slave labor\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY MOVEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY; THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER\r\nWHICH THE COLONIZATION SOCIETY TOOK ITS RISE; THE RELATIONS IT SUSTAINED\r\nTO SLAVERY AND TO THE SCHEMES PROJECTED FOR ITS ABOLITION; THE ORIGIN OF\r\nTHE ELEMENTS WHICH HAVE GIVEN TO AMERICAN SLAVERY ITS COMMERCIAL VALUE\r\nAND CONSEQUENT POWERS OF EXPANSION; AND THE FUTILITY OF THE MEANS USED\r\nTO PREVENT THE EXTENSION OF THE INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n          Emancipation in the United States begun--First\r\n          Abolition Society organized--Progress of\r\n          Emancipation--First Cotton Mill--Exclusion of\r\n          Slavery from N. W. Territory--Elements of Slavery\r\n          expansion--Cotton Gin invented--Suppression of the\r\n          Slave Trade--Cotton Manufactures commenced in\r\n          Boston--Franklin's Appeal--Condition of the Free\r\n          Colored People--Boston Prison-Discipline\r\n          Society--Darkening Prospects of the Colored\r\n          People.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR years after the Declaration of American Independence, Pennsylvania\r\nand Massachusetts had emancipated their slaves; and, eight years\r\nthereafter, Connecticut and Rhode Island followed their example.\r\n\r\nThree years after the last named event, an _abolition society_ was\r\norganized by the citizens of the State of New York, with John Jay at its\r\nhead. Two years subsequently, the Pennsylvanians did the same thing,\r\nelecting Benjamin Franklin to the presidency of their association. The\r\nsame year, too, slavery was forever excluded, by act of Congress, from\r\nthe Northwest Territory. This year is also memorable as having witnessed\r\nthe erection of the first cotton mill in the United States, at Beverley,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nDuring the year that the New York Abolition Society was formed, Watts,\r\nof England, had so far perfected the _steam engine_ as to use it in\r\npropelling machinery for spinning cotton; and the year the Pennsylvania\r\nSociety was organized witnessed the invention of the _power loom_. The\r\n_carding machine_ and the _spinning jenny_ having been invented twenty\r\nyears before, the power loom completed the machinery necessary to the\r\nindefinite extension of the manufacture of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe work of emancipation, begun by the four States named, continued to\r\nprogress, so that in seventeen years from the adoption of the\r\nconstitution, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, and New Jersey, had also\r\nenacted laws to free themselves from the burden of slavery.\r\n\r\nAs the work of manumission proceeded, the elements of slavery expansion\r\nwere multiplied. When the four States first named liberated their\r\nslaves, no regular exports of cotton to Europe had yet commenced; and\r\nthe year New Hampshire set hers free, only 138,328 lbs. of that article\r\nwere shipped from the country. Simultaneously with the action of\r\nVermont, in the year following, the _cotton gin_ was invented, and an\r\nunparalleled impulse given to the cultivation of cotton. At the same\r\ntime, Louisiana, with her immense territory, was added to the Union, and\r\nroom for the extension of slavery vastly increased. New York lagged\r\nbehind Vermont for six years, before taking her first step to free her\r\nslaves, when she found the exports of cotton to England had reached\r\n9,500,000 lbs.; and New Jersey, still more tardy, fell five years behind\r\nNew York; at which time the exports of that staple--so rapidly had its\r\ncultivation progressed--were augmented to 38,900,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nFour years after the emancipations by States had ceased, the slave trade\r\nwas prohibited; but, as if each movement for freedom must have its\r\ncounter-movement to stimulate slavery, that same year the manufacture of\r\ncotton goods was commenced in Boston. Two years after that event, the\r\nexports of cotton amounted to 93,900,000 lbs. War with Great Britain,\r\nsoon afterward, checked both our exports and her manufacture of the\r\narticle; but the year 1817, memorable in this connection, from its being\r\nthe date of the organization of the Colonization Society, found our\r\nexports augmented to 95,660,000 lbs., and her consumption enlarged to\r\n126,240,000 lbs. Carding and spinning machinery had now reached a good\r\ndegree of perfection, and the power loom was brought into general use in\r\nEngland, and was also introduced into the United States. Steamboats,\r\ntoo, were coming into use, in both countries; and great activity\r\nprevailed in commerce, manufactures, and the cultivation of cotton.\r\n\r\nBut how fared it with the free colored people during all this time? To\r\nobtain a true answer to this question we must revert to the days of the\r\nPennsylvania Abolition Society.\r\n\r\nWith freedom to the slave, came anxieties among the whites as to the\r\nresults. Nine years after Pennsylvania and Massachusetts had taken the\r\nlead in the trial of emancipation, Franklin issued an appeal for aid to\r\nenable his society to form a plan for the promotion of industry,\r\nintelligence, and morality among the free blacks; and he zealously urged\r\nthe measure on public attention, as essential to their well-being, and\r\nindispensable to the safety of society. He expressed his belief, that\r\nsuch is the debasing influence of slavery on human nature, that its very\r\nextirpation, if not performed with care, may sometimes open a source of\r\nserious evils; and that so far as emancipation should be promoted by the\r\nsociety, it was a duty incumbent on its members to instruct, to advise,\r\nto qualify those restored to freedom, for the exercise and enjoyment of\r\ncivil liberty.\r\n\r\nHow far Franklin's influence failed to promote the humane object he had\r\nin view, may be inferred from the fact, that forty-seven years after\r\nPennsylvania passed her act of emancipation, and thirty-eight after he\r\nissued his appeal, _one-third_ of the convicts in her penitentiary were\r\ncolored men; though the preceding census showed that her slave\r\npopulation had almost wholly disappeared--there being but _two hundred\r\nand eleven_ of them remaining, while her free colored people had\r\nincreased in number to more than _thirty thousand_. Few of the other\r\nfree States were more fortunate, and some of them were even in a worse\r\ncondition--_one-half_ of the convicts in the penitentiary of New Jersey\r\nbeing colored men.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the whole of the sad tale that must be recorded. Gloomy\r\nas was the picture of crime among the colored people of New Jersey, that\r\nof Massachusetts was vastly worse. For though the number of her colored\r\nconvicts, as compared with the whites, was as _one_ to _six_, yet the\r\nproportion of her colored population in the penitentiary was _one_ out\r\nof _one hundred and forty_, while the proportion in New Jersey was but\r\n_one_ out of _eight hundred and thirty-three_. Thus, in Massachusetts,\r\nwhere emancipation had, in 1780, been _immediate_ and unconditional,\r\nthere was, in 1826, among her colored people, about six times as much\r\ncrime as existed among those of New Jersey, where _gradual_ emancipation\r\nhad not been provided for until 1804.\r\n\r\nThe moral condition of the colored people in the free States, generally,\r\nat the period we are considering, may be understood more clearly from\r\nthe opinions expressed, at the time, by the _Boston Prison Discipline\r\nSociety_. This benevolent association included among its members, Rev.\r\nFrancis Wayland, Rev. Justin Edwards, Rev. Leonard Woods, Rev. William\r\nJenks, Rev. B. B. Wisner, Rev. Edward Beecher, Lewis Tappan, Esq., John\r\nTappan, Esq., Hon. George Bliss, and Hon. Samuel M. Hopkins.\r\n\r\nIn the First Annual Report of the Society, dated June 2, 1826, they\r\nenter into an investigation \"of the progress of crime, with the causes\r\nof it,\" from which we make the following extracts:\r\n\r\n\"DEGRADED CHARACTER OF THE COLORED POPULATION.--The first cause,\r\nexisting in society, of the frequency and increase of crime is the\r\ndegraded character of the colored population. The facts, which are\r\ngathered from the penitentiaries, to show how great a proportion of the\r\nconvicts are colored, even in those States where the colored population\r\nis small, show, most strikingly, the connection between ignorance and\r\nvice.\"\r\n\r\nThe report proceeds to sustain its assertions by statistics, which\r\nprove, that, in Massachusetts, where the free colored people constituted\r\n_one seventy-fourth_ part of the population, they supplied _one-sixth_\r\npart of the convicts in her penitentiary; that in New York, where the\r\nfree colored people constituted _one thirty-fifth_ part of the\r\npopulation, they supplied more than _one-fourth_ part of the convicts;\r\nthat, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, where the colored people\r\nconstituted _one thirty-fourth_ part of the population, they supplied\r\nmore than _one-third_ part of the convicts; and that, in New Jersey,\r\nwhere the colored people constituted _one-thirteenth_ part of the\r\npopulation, they supplied more than _one-third_ part of the convicts.\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary,\" continues the report, \"to pursue these\r\nillustrations. It is sufficiently apparent, that one great cause of the\r\nfrequency and increase of crime, is neglecting to raise the character of\r\nthe colored population.\r\n\r\n\"We derive an argument in favor of education from these facts. It\r\nappears from the above statement, that about _one-fourth_ part of all\r\nthe expense incurred by the States above mentioned, for the support of\r\ntheir criminal institutions, is for the colored convicts. * * Could\r\nthese States have anticipated these surprising results, and appropriated\r\nthe money to raise the character of the colored population, how much\r\nbetter would have been their prospects, and how much less the expense of\r\nthe States through which they are dispersed for the support of their\r\ncolored convicts! * * If, however, their character can not be raised,\r\nwhere they are, a powerful argument may be derived from these facts, in\r\nfavor of colonization, and civilized States ought surely to be as\r\nwilling to expend money on any given part of its population, to prevent\r\ncrime, as to punish it.\r\n\r\n\"We can not but indulge the hope that the facts disclosed above, if they\r\ndo not lead to an effort to raise the character of the colored\r\npopulation, will strengthen the hands and encourage the hearts of all\r\nthe friends of colonizing the free people of color in the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nThe Second Annual Report of the Society, dated June 1, 1827, gives the\r\nresults of its continued investigations into the condition of the free\r\ncolored people, in the following language and figures:\r\n\r\n          \"CHARACTER OF THE COLORED POPULATION.--In the last\r\n          report, this subject was exhibited at considerable\r\n          length.

The returns from\r\nseveral prisons show, that the white convicts are remaining nearly the\r\nsame, or are diminishing, while the colored convicts are increasing. At\r\nthe same time, the white population is increasing, in the Northern\r\nStates, much faster than the colored population.\"\r\n\r\n                          _Whole No.    _Colored\r\n                        of Convicts._    Convicts._    _Proportion._\r\n   In Massachusetts,       313              50            1 to 6\r\n   In New York,            381             101            1 to 4\r\n   In New Jersey,           67              33            1 to 2\r\n\r\nSuch is the testimony of men of unimpeachable veracity and undoubted\r\nphilanthrophy, as to the early results of emancipation in the United\r\nStates. Had the freedmen, in the Northern States, improved their\r\nprivileges; had they established a reputation for industry, integrity,\r\nand virtue, far other consequences would have followed their\r\nemancipation. Their advancement in moral character would have put to\r\nshame the advocate for the perpetuation of slavery. Indeed, there could\r\nhave been no plausible argument found for its continuance. No regular\r\nexports of cotton, no cultivation of cane sugar, to give a profitable\r\ncharacter to slave labor, had any existence when Jay and Franklin\r\ncommenced their labors, and when Congress took its first step for the\r\nsuppression of the slave trade.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the free colored people persevered in their evil habits.\r\nThis not only served to fix their own social and political condition on\r\nthe level of the slave, but it reacted with fearful effect upon their\r\nbrethren remaining in bondage. Their refusing to listen to the counsel\r\nof the philanthropists, who urged them to forsake their indolence and\r\nvice, and their frequent violations of the laws, more than all things\r\nelse, put a check to the tendencies, in public sentiment, toward general\r\nemancipation. The failure of Franklin to obtain the means of\r\nestablishing institutions for the education of the blacks, confirmed the\r\npopular belief that such an undertaking was impracticable, and the whole\r\nAfrican race, freedmen as well as slaves, were viewed as an intolerable\r\nburden, such as the imports of foreign paupers are now considered. Thus\r\nthe free colored people themselves, ruthlessly threw the car of\r\nemancipation from the track, and tore up the rails upon which, alone, it\r\ncould move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n          State of public opinion in relation to colored\r\n          population--Southern views of\r\n          Emancipation--Influence of Mr. Jefferson's\r\n          opinions--He opposed Emancipation except connected\r\n          with Colonization--Negro equality not contemplated\r\n          by the Father's of the Revolution--This proved by\r\n          the resolutions of their conventions--The true\r\n          objects of the opposition to the slave\r\n          trade--Motives of British Statesmen in forcing\r\n          Slavery on the colonies--Absurdity of supposing\r\n          negro equality was contemplated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE opinion that the African race would become a growing burden had its\r\norigin before the revolution, and led the colonists to oppose the\r\nintroduction of slaves; but failing in this, through the opposition of\r\nEngland, as soon as they threw off the foreign yoke many of the States\r\nat once crushed the system--among the first acts of sovereignty by\r\nVirginia, being the prohibition of the slave trade. In the determination\r\nto suppress this traffic all the States united--but in emancipation\r\ntheir policy differed. It was found easier to manage the slaves than the\r\nfree blacks--at least it was claimed to be so--and, for this reason, the\r\nslave States, not long after the others had completed their work of\r\nmanumission, proceeded to enact laws prohibiting emancipations, except\r\non condition that the persons liberated should be removed. The newly\r\norganized free States, too, taking alarm at this, and dreading the\r\ninflux of the free colored people, adopted measures to prevent the\r\ningress of this proscribed and helpless race.\r\n\r\nThese movements, so distressing to the reflecting colored man, be it\r\nremembered, were not the effect of the action of colonizationists, but\r\ntook place, mostly, long before the organization of the American\r\nColonization Society; and, at its first annual meeting, the importance\r\nand humanity of colonization was strongly urged, on the very ground that\r\nthe slave States, as soon as they should find that the persons liberated\r\ncould be sent to Africa, would relax their laws against emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe slow progress made by the great body of the free blacks in the\r\nNorth, or the absence, rather, of any evidences of improvement in\r\nindustry, intelligence, and morality, gave rise to the notion, that\r\nbefore they could be elevated to an equality with the whites, slavery\r\nmust be wholly abolished throughout the Union. The constant ingress of\r\nliberated slaves from the South, to commingle with the free colored\r\npeople of the North, it was claimed, tended to perpetuate the low moral\r\nstandard originally existing among the blacks; and universal\r\nemancipation was believed to be indispensable to the elevation of the\r\nrace. Those who adopted this view, seem to have overlooked the fact,\r\nthat the Africans, of savage origin, could not be elevated at once to an\r\nequality with the American people, by the mere force of legal\r\nenactments. More than this was needed, for their elevation, as all are\r\nnow, reluctantly, compelled to acknowledge. Emancipation, unaccompanied\r\nby the means of intellectual and moral culture, is of but little value.\r\nThe savage, liberated from bondage, is a savage still.\r\n\r\nThe slave States adopted opinions, as to the negro character, opposite\r\nto those of the free States, and would not risk the experiment of\r\nemancipation. They said, if the free States feel themselves burdened by\r\nthe few Africans they have freed, and whom they find it impracticable to\r\neducate and elevate, how much greater would be the evil the slave States\r\nmust bring upon themselves by letting loose a population nearly twelve\r\ntimes as numerous. Such an act, they argued, would be suicidal--would\r\ncrush out all progress in civilization; or, in the effort to elevate the\r\nnegro with the white man, allowing him equal freedom of action, would\r\nmake the more energetic Anglo-Saxon the slave of the indolent African.\r\nSuch a task, onerous in the highest degree, they could not, and would\r\nnot undertake; such an experiment, on their social system, they dared\r\nnot hazard; and in this determination they were encouraged to\r\npersevere, not only by the results of emancipation, then wrought out at\r\nthe North, but by the settled convictions which had long prevailed at\r\nthe South, in relation to the impropriety of freeing the negroes. This\r\nopinion was one of long standing, and had been avowed by some of the\r\nablest statesmen of the Revolution. Among these Mr. Jefferson stood\r\nprominent. He was inclined to consider the African inferior \"in the\r\nendowments both of body and mind\" to the European; and, while expressing\r\nhis hostility to slavery earnestly, vehemently, he avowed the opinion\r\nthat it was impossible for the two races to live equally free in the\r\nsame government--that \"nature, habit, opinion, had drawn indelible lines\r\nof distinction between them\"--that, accordingly, emancipation and\r\n\"deportation\" (colonization) should go hand in hand--and that these\r\nprocesses should be gradual enough to make proper provisions for the\r\nblacks in a new country, and fill their places in this with free white\r\nlaborers.[2]\r\n\r\nAnother point needs examination. Notwithstanding the well-known opinions\r\nof Mr. Jefferson, it has been urged that the Declaration of Independence\r\nwas designed, by those who issued it, to apply to the negro as well as\r\nto the white man; and that they purposed to extend to the negro, at the\r\nend of the struggle, then begun, all the privileges which they hoped to\r\nsecure for themselves. Nothing can be further from the truth, and\r\nnothing more certain than that the rights of the negro never entered\r\ninto the questions then considered. That document was written by Mr.\r\nJefferson himself, and, with the views which he entertained, he could\r\nnot have thought, for a moment, of conferring upon the negro the rights\r\nof American citizenship. Hear him further upon this subject and then\r\njudge:\r\n\r\n\"It will probably be asked, why not retain and incorporate the blacks\r\ninto the State, and thus save the expense of supplying by importation of\r\nwhite settlers, the vacancies they will leave? Deep-rooted prejudices\r\nentertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of\r\nthe injuries they have sustained; new provocations; the real\r\ndistinctions which nature has made; and many other circumstances, will\r\ndivide us into parties, and produce convulsions, which will probably\r\nnever end, but in the extermination of the one or the other race. To\r\nthese objections, which are political, may be added others, which are\r\nphysical and moral\"[3]\r\n\r\nNow it is evident, from this language, that Mr. Jefferson was not only\r\nopposed to allowing the negroes the rights of citizenship, but that he\r\nwas opposed to emancipation also, except on the condition that the\r\nfreedmen should be removed from the country. He could, therefore, have\r\nmeant nothing more by the phrase, \"all men are created equal,\" which he\r\nemployed in the Declaration of Independence, than the announcement of a\r\ngeneral principle, which, in its application to the colonists, was\r\nintended most emphatically to assert their equality, before God and the\r\nworld, with the imperious Englishmen who claimed the divine right of\r\nlording it over them. This was undoubtedly the view held by Mr.\r\nJefferson, and the extent to which he expected the language of the\r\nDeclaration to be applied.[4] Nor could the signers of that instrument,\r\nor the people whom they represented, ever have intended to apply its\r\nprinciples to any barbarous or semi-barbarous people, in the sense of\r\nadmitting them to an equality with themselves in the management of a\r\nfree government. Had this been their design, they must have enfranchised\r\nboth Indians and Africans, as both were within the territory over which\r\nthey exercised jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nBut testimony of a conclusive character is at hand, to show that quite\r\na different object was to be accomplished, than negro equality, in the\r\nmovements of the colonists which preceded the outbreak of the American\r\nRevolution. They passed resolutions upon the subject of the slave trade,\r\nit is true, but it was to oppose it, because it increased the colored\r\npopulation, a result they deprecated in the strongest language. The\r\nchecking of this evil, great as the people considered it, was not the\r\nprincipal object they had in view, in resolving to crush out the slave\r\ntrade. It was one of far greater moment, affecting the prosperity of the\r\nmother country, and designed to force her to deal justly with the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nThis point can only be understood by an examination of the history of\r\nthat period, so as to comprehend the relations existing between Great\r\nBritain and her several colonies. Let us, then, proceed to the\r\nperformance of this task.\r\n\r\nThe whole commerce of Great Britain, in 1704, amounted, in value, to\r\nthirty-two and a half millions of dollars. In less than three quarters\r\nof a century thereafter, or three years preceding the outbreak of the\r\nAmerican Revolution, it had increased to eighty millions annually. More\r\nthan thirty millions of this amount, or over one-third of the whole,\r\nconsisted of exports to her West Indian and North American colonies and\r\nto Africa. The yearly trade with Africa, alone, at this\r\nperiod--1772--was over four and a third millions of dollars: a\r\nsignificant fact, when it is known that this African traffic was in\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nBut this statement fails to give a true idea of the value of North\r\nAmerica and the West Indies to the mother country. Of the commodities\r\nwhich she imported from them--tobacco, rice, sugar, rum--ten millions of\r\ndollars worth, annually, were re-exported to her other dependencies, and\r\nfive millions to foreign countries--thus making her indebted to these\r\ncolonies, directly and indirectly, for more than one-half of all her\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nIf England was greatly dependent upon these colonies for her increasing\r\nprosperity, they were also dependent upon her; and upon each other, for\r\nthe mutual promotion of their comfort and wealth. This is easily\r\nunderstood. The colonies were prohibited from manufacturing for\r\nthemselves. This rendered it necessary that they should be supplied with\r\nlinen and woolen fabrics, hardware and cutlery, from the looms and shops\r\nof Great Britain; and, in addition to these necessaries, they were\r\ndependent upon her ships to furnish them with slaves from Africa. The\r\nNorth American colonies were dependent upon the West Indies for coffee,\r\nsugar, rum; and the West Indies upon North America, in turn, for their\r\nmain supplies of provisions and lumber. The North Americans, if\r\ncompelled by necessity, could do without the manufacures of England, and\r\nforego the use of the groceries and rum of the West Indies; but Great\r\nBritain could not easily bear the loss of half her commerce, nor could\r\nthe West India planters meet a sudden emergency that would cut off their\r\nusual supplies of provisions.\r\n\r\nSuch were the relations existing between Great Britain and the colonies,\r\nand between the colonies themselves, when the Bostonians cast the tea\r\noverboard. This act of resistance to law, was followed by the passage,\r\nthrough Parliament, of the Boston Port Bill, closing Boston Harbor to\r\nall commerce whatsoever. The North American colonies, conscious of their\r\npower over the commerce of Great Britain, at once obeyed the call of the\r\ncitizens of Boston, and united in the adoption of peaceful measures, to\r\nforce the repeal of the obnoxious act. Meetings of the people were held\r\nthroughout the country, generally, and resolutions passed, recommending\r\nthe non-importation and non-consumption of all British manufactures and\r\nWest India products; and resolving, also, that they would not export any\r\nprovisions, lumber, or other products, whatever, to Great Britain or any\r\nof her colonies. These resolutions were accompanied by another, in many\r\nof the counties of Virginia, in some of the State conventions, and,\r\nfinally, in those of the Continental Congress, in which the slave trade,\r\nand the purchase of additional slaves, were specially referred to as\r\nmeasures to be at once discontinued. These resolutions, in substance,\r\ndeclare, as the sentiment of the people: That the African trade is\r\ninjurious to the colonies; that it obstructs the population of them by\r\nfreemen; that it prevents the immigration of manufacturers and other\r\nuseful emigrants from Europe from settling among them; that it is\r\ndangerous to virtue and the welfare of the population; that it occasions\r\nan annual increase of the balance of trade against them; that they most\r\nearnestly wished to see an entire stop put to such a wicked, cruel, and\r\nunlawful traffic; that they would not purchase any slaves hereafter to\r\nbe imported, nor hire their vessels, nor sell their commodities or\r\nmanufactures to those who are concerned in their importation.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it appears evident, that the primary object of all the\r\nresolutions was to cripple the commerce of England. Those in relation to\r\nthe slave trade, especially, were expected, at once, when taken in\r\nconnection with the determination to withhold all supplies of provisions\r\nfrom the West India planters--to stop the slave trade, and deprive the\r\nBritish merchants of all further profits from that traffic. But it would\r\ndo more than this, as it would compel the West India planters, in a\r\ngreat degree, to stop the cultivation of sugar and cotton, for export,\r\nand force them to commence the growing of provisions for food--thus\r\nproducing ruinous consequences to British manufactures and commerce.[5]\r\nBut, in the opposition thus made to the slave trade, there is no act\r\nwarranting the conclusion that the negroes were to be admitted to a\r\nposition of equality with the whites. The sentiments expressed, with a\r\nsingle exception,[6] are the reverse, and their increase viewed as an\r\nevil. South Carolina and Georgia did not follow the example of Virginia\r\nand North Carolina in resolving against the slave trade, but acquiesced\r\nin the non-intercourse policy, until the grievances complained of should\r\nbe remedied. Another reason existed for opposing the slave trade; this\r\nwas the importance of preventing the increase of a population that might\r\nbe employed against the liberties of the colonies. That negroes were\r\nthus employed, during the Revolution, is a matter of history; and that\r\nthe British hoped to use that population for their own advantage, is\r\nclearly indicated by the language of the Earl of Dartmouth, who\r\ndeclared, as a sufficient reason for turning a deaf ear to the\r\nremonstrances of the colonists against the further importation of\r\nslaves, that \"Negroes cannot become Republicans--they will be a power in\r\nour hands to restrain the unruly colonists.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, now, will any one say, that the fathers of the Revolution ever\r\nintended to declare the negro the equal of the white man, in the sense\r\nthat he was entitled to an equality of political privileges under the\r\nconstitution of the United States!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Randall's Life of Jefferson, vol. i. page 370.\r\n\r\n[3] Randall's Life of Jefferson, vol. i. page 370, Note.\r\n\r\n[4] That Mr. Jefferson was considered as having no settled plans or\r\nviews in relation to the disposal of the blacks, and that he was\r\ndisinclined to risk the disturbance of the harmony of the country for\r\nthe sake of the negro, appears evident from the opinions entertained of\r\nhim and his schemes by John Quincy Adams. After speaking of the zeal of\r\nMr. Jefferson, and the strong manner in which, at times, he had spoken\r\nagainst slavery, Mr. Adams says: \"But Jefferson had not the spirit of\r\nmartyrdom. He would have introduced a flaming denunciation of slavery\r\ninto the Declaration of Independence, but the discretion of his\r\ncolleagues struck it out. He did insert a most eloquent and impassioned\r\nargument against it in his Notes on Virginia; but, on that very account,\r\nthe book was published almost against his will. He projected a plan of\r\ngeneral emancipation, in his revision of the Virginia laws, but finally\r\npresented a plan leaving slavery precisely where it was; and, in his\r\nMemoir, he leaves a posthumous warning to the planters that they must,\r\nat no distant day, emancipate their slaves, or that worse will follow;\r\nbut he withheld the publication of his prophecy till he should himself\r\nbe in the grave.\"--_Life of J. Q.

The moral desolation\r\nexisting in Africa, was without a parallel among the nations of the\r\nearth. When the last of our Northern States had freed its slaves, not a\r\nsingle Christian Church had been successfully established in Africa, and\r\nthe slave trade was still legalized to the citizens of every Christian\r\nnation. Even its subsequent prohibition, by the United States and\r\nEngland, had no tendency to check the traffic, nor ameliorate the\r\ncondition of the African. The other Europeon powers, having now the\r\nmonopoly of the trade, continued to prosecute it with a vigor it never\r\nfelt before. The institution of slavery, while lessened in the United\r\nStates, where it had not yet been made profitable, was rapidly acquiring\r\nan unprecedented enlargement in Cuba and Brazil, where its profitable\r\ncharacter had been more fully realized. How shall the slave trade be\r\nannihilated, slavery extension prevented, and Africa receive a Christian\r\ncivilization? were questions that agitated the bosom of many a\r\nphilanthropist, long after Wilberforce had achieved his triumphs. It was\r\nfound, that the passage of laws prohibiting the slave trade, and the\r\nextermination of that traffic, were two distinct things--the one not\r\nnecessarily following the other. The success of Wilberforce with the\r\nBritish Parliament, only increased the necessity for additional\r\nphilanthropic efforts; and a quarter of a century afterwards found the\r\nevil vastly increased which he imagined was wholly destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt was at the period in the history of Africa, and of public sentiment\r\non slavery, which we have been considering, that the American\r\nColonization Society was organized. It began its labors when the eye of\r\nthe statesman, the philanthropist, and the Christian, could discover no\r\nother plan of overcoming the moral desolation, the universal oppression\r\nof the colored race, than by restoring the most enlightened of their\r\nnumber to Africa itself. Emancipation, by States, had been at an end for\r\na dozen of years. The improvement of the free colored people, in the\r\npresence of the slave, was considered impracticable. Slave labor had\r\nbecome so profitable, as to leave little ground to expect general\r\nemancipation, even though all other objections had been removed. The\r\nslave trade had increased twenty-five per cent. during the preceding ten\r\nyears. Slavery was rapidly extending itself in the tropics, and could\r\nnot be arrested but by the suppression of the slave trade. The foothold\r\nof the Christian missionary was yet so precarious in Africa, as to leave\r\nit doubtful whether he could sustain his position.\r\n\r\nThe colonization of the free colored people in Africa, under the\r\nteachings of the Christian men who were prepared to accompany them, it\r\nwas believed, would as fully meet all the conditions of the race, as was\r\npossible in the then existing state of the world. It would separate\r\nthose who should emigrate from all further contact with slavery, and\r\nfrom its depressing influences; it would relax the laws of the slave\r\nStates against emancipation, and lead to the more frequent liberation of\r\nslaves; it would stimulate and encourage the colored people remaining\r\nhere, to engage in efforts for their own elevation; it would establish\r\nfree republics along the coast of Africa, and drive away the slave\r\ntrader; it would prevent the extension of slavery, by means of the slave\r\ntrade, in tropical America; it would introduce civilization and\r\nChristianity among the people of Africa, and overturn their barbarism\r\nand bloody superstitions; and, if successful, it would react upon\r\nslavery at home, by pointing out to the States and General Government, a\r\nmode by which they might free themselves from the whole African race.\r\n\r\nThe Society had thus undertaken as great an amount of work as it could\r\nperform. The field was broad enough, truly, for an association that\r\nhoped to obtain an income of but five to ten thousand dollars a year,\r\nand realized annually an average of only $3,276 during the first six\r\nyears of its existence. It did not include the destruction of American\r\nslavery among the objects it labored to accomplish. That subject had\r\nbeen fully discussed; the ablest men in the nation had labored for its\r\noverthrow; more than half the original States of the Union had\r\nemancipated their slaves; the advantages of freedom to the colored man\r\nhad been tested; the results had not been as favorable as anticipated;\r\nthe public sentiment of the country was adverse to an increase of the\r\nfree colored population; the few of their number who had risen to\r\nrespectability and affluence, were too widely separated to act in\r\nconcert in promoting measures for the general good; and, until better\r\nresults should follow the liberation of slaves, further emancipations,\r\nby the States, were not to be expected. The friends of the Colonization\r\nSociety, therefore, while affording every encouragement to emancipation\r\nby individuals, refused to agitate the question of the general abolition\r\nof slavery. Nor did they thrust aside any other scheme of benevolence in\r\nbehalf of the African race. Forty years had elapsed from the\r\ncommencement of emancipation in the country, and thirty from the date of\r\nFranklin's Appeal, before the society sent off its first emigrants. At\r\nthat date, no extended plans were in existence, promising relief to the\r\nfree colored man. A period of lethargy, among the benevolent, had\r\nsucceeded the State emancipations, as a consequence of the indifference\r\nof the free colored people, as a class, to their degraded condition. The\r\npublic sentiment of the country was fully prepared, therefore, to adopt\r\ncolonization as the best means, or, rather, as the only means for\r\naccomplishing any thing for them or for the African race. Indeed, so\r\ngeneral was the sentiment in favor of colonization, somewhere beyond the\r\nlimits of the United States, that those who disliked Africa, commenced a\r\nscheme of emigration to Hayti, and prosecuted it, until eight thousand\r\nfree colored persons were removed to that island--a number nearly\r\nequaling the whole emigration to Liberia up to 1850. Haytien emigration,\r\nhowever, proved a most disastrous experiment.\r\n\r\nBut the general acquiescence in the objects of the Colonization Society\r\ndid not long continue. The exports of cotton from the South were then\r\nrapidly on the increase. Slave labor had become profitable, and slaves,\r\nin the cotton-growing States, were no longer considered a burden. Seven\r\nyears after the first emigrants reached Liberia, the South exported\r\n294,310,115 lbs. of cotton; and, the year following, the total cotton\r\ncrop reached 325,000,000 lbs. But a great depression in prices had\r\noccurred,[7] and alarmed the planters for their safety. They had\r\ndecided against emancipation, and now to have their slaves rendered\r\nvalueless, was an evil they were determined to avert. The Report of the\r\nBoston Prison Discipline Society, which appeared at this moment, was\r\nwell calculated, by the disclosures it made, to increase the alarm in\r\nthe South, and to confirm slaveholders in their belief of the dangers of\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, a warfare against colonization was commenced at the\r\nSouth, and it was pronounced an abolition scheme in disguise. In\r\ndefending itself, the society re-asserted its principles of neutrality\r\nin relation to slavery, and that it had only in view the colonization of\r\nthe free colored people. In the heat of the contest, the South were\r\nreminded of their former sentiments in relation to the whole colored\r\npopulation, and that colonization merely proposed removing one division\r\nof a people they had pronounced a public burden.[8]\r\n\r\nThe emancipationists at the North had only lent their aid to\r\ncolonization in the hope that it would prove an able auxiliary to\r\nabolition; but when the society declared its unalterable purpose to\r\nadhere to its original position of neutrality, they withdrew their\r\nsupport, and commenced hostilities against it. \"The Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety,\" said a distinguished abolitionist, \"began with a declaration\r\nof war against the Colonization Society.\"[9] This feeling of hostility\r\nwas greatly increased by the action of the abolitionists of England.\r\nThe doctrine of \"Immediate, not Gradual Abolition,\" was announced by\r\nthem as their creed; and the anti-slavery men of the United States\r\nadopted it as the basis of their action. Its success in the English\r\nParliament, in procuring the passage of the Act for West India\r\nemancipation, in 1833, gave a great impulse to the abolition cause in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, William Lloyd Garrison declared hostilities against the\r\nColonization Society; in 1834, James G. Birney followed his example;\r\nand, in 1836 Gerritt Smith also abandoned the cause. The North\r\neverywhere resounded with the cry of \"Immediate Abolition;\" and, in\r\n1837, the abolitionists numbered 1,015 societies; had seventy agents\r\nunder commission, and an income, for the year, of $36,000.[10] The\r\nColonization Society, on the other hand, was greatly embarrassed. Its\r\nincome, in 1838, was reduced to $10,000; it was deeply in debt; the\r\nparent society did not send a single emigrant, that year, to Liberia;\r\nand its enemies pronounced it bankrupt and dead.[11]\r\n\r\nBut did the abolitionists succeed in forcing emancipation upon the\r\nSouth, when they had thus rendered colonization powerless? Did the\r\nfetters fall from the slave at their bidding? Did fire from heaven\r\ndescend, and consume the slaveholder at their invocation? No such thing!\r\nThey had not touched the true cause of the extension of slavery. They\r\nhad not discovered the secret of its power; and, therefore, its locks\r\nremained unshorn, its strength unabated. The institution advanced as\r\ntriumphantly as if no opposition existed. The planters were progressing\r\nsteadily, in securing to themselves the monopoly of the cotton markets\r\nof Europe, and in extending the area of slavery at home. In the same\r\nyear that Gerritt Smith declared for abolition, the title of the Indians\r\nto fifty-five millions of acres of land, in the slave States, was\r\nextinguished, and the tribes removed. The year that colonization was\r\ndepressed to the lowest point, the exports of cotton, from the United\r\nStates, amounted to 595,952,297 lbs., and the consumption of the article\r\nin England, to 477,206,108 lbs.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Birney seceded from colonization, he encouraged his new allies\r\nwith the hope, that West India free labor would render our slave labor\r\nless profitable, and emancipation, as a consequence, be more easily\r\neffected. How stood this matter six years afterward? This will be best\r\nunderstood by contrast. In 1800, the West Indies exported 17,000,000\r\nlbs. of cotton, and the United States, 17,789,803 lbs. They were then\r\nabout equally productive in that article. In 1840, the West India\r\nexports had dwindled down to 427,529 lbs., while those of the United\r\nStates had increased to 743,941,061 lbs.\r\n\r\nAnd what was England doing all this while? Having lost her supplies from\r\nthe West Indies, she was quietly spinning away at American slave labor\r\ncotton; and to ease the public conscience of the kingdom, was loudly\r\ntalking of a free labor supply of the commodity from the banks of the\r\nNiger! But the expedition up that river failed, and 1845 found her\r\nmanufacturing 626,496,000 lbs. of cotton, mostly the product of American\r\nslaves! The strength of American slavery at that moment may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact, that we exported that year 872,905,996 lbs. of cotton,\r\nand our production of cane sugar had reached over 200,000,000 lbs.;\r\nwhile, to make room for slavery extension, we were busied in the\r\nannexation of Texas and in preparations for the consequent war with\r\nMexico!\r\n\r\nBut abolitionists themselves, some time before this, had, mostly, become\r\nconvinced of the feeble character of their efforts against slavery, and\r\nallowed politicians to enlist them in a political crusade, as the last\r\nhope of arresting the progress of the system. The cry of \"Immediate\r\nAbolition\" died away; reliance upon moral means was mainly abandoned;\r\nand the limitation of the institution, geographically, became the chief\r\nobject of effort. The results of more than a dozen years of political\r\naction are before the public, and what has it accomplished! We are not\r\nnow concerned in the inquiry of how far the strategy of politicians\r\nsucceeded in making the votes of abolitionists subservient to slavery\r\nextension. That they did so, in at least one prominent case, will never\r\nbe denied by any candid man. All we intend to say, is, that the cotton\r\nplanters, instead of being crippled in their operations, were able, in\r\nthe year ending the last of June, 1853, to export 1,111,570,370 lbs. of\r\ncotton, beside supplying near 300,000,000 lbs. for home consumption; and\r\nthat England, the year ending the last of January, 1853, consumed the\r\nunprecedented quantity of 817,998,048 lbs. of that staple.[12] The year\r\n1854, instead of finding slavery perishing under the blows it had\r\nreceived, has witnessed the destruction of all the old barriers to its\r\nextension, and beholds it expanded widely enough for the profitable\r\nemployment of the slave population, with all its natural increase, for a\r\nhundred years to come!!\r\n\r\nIf political action against slavery has been thus disastrously\r\nunfortunate, how is it with anti-slavery action, at large, as to its\r\nefficiency at this moment? On this point, hear the testimony of a\r\ncorrespondent of Frederick Douglass' Paper, January 26, 1855:\r\n\r\n\"How gloriously did the anti-slavery cause arise . . . . . . in 1833-4!\r\nAnd now what is it, in our agency! . . . . . . What is it, through the\r\nerrors or crimes of its advocates variously--probably quite as much as\r\nthrough the brazen, gross, and licentious wickedness of its enemies.\r\nAlas! what is it but a mutilated, feeble, discordant, and half-expiring\r\ninstrument, at which Satan and his children, legally and illegally,\r\nscoff! Of it I despair.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the crowning results of both political and anti-slavery action,\r\nfor the overthrow of slavery! Such are the demonstrations of their utter\r\nimpotency as a means of relief to the bond and free of the colored\r\npeople!\r\n\r\nSurely, then, if the negro is capable of elevation, it is time that some\r\nother measures should be devised, than those hitherto adopted, for the\r\nmelioration of the African race! Surely, too, it is time for the\r\nAmerican people to rebuke that class of politicians, North and South,\r\nwhose only capital consists in keeping up a fruitless warfare upon the\r\nsubject of slavery--nay! abundant in fruits to the poor colored man; but\r\nto him, \"their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of\r\nGomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter;\r\ntheir vine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe application of this language, to the case under consideration, will\r\nbe fully justified when the facts, in the remaining pages of this work,\r\nare carefully studied.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] See Table I, Appendix.\r\n\r\n[8] The sentiment of the Colonization Society, was expressed in the\r\nfollowing resolution, embraced in its annual report of 1826:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_,--That the society disclaims, in the most unqualified terms,\r\nthe design attributed to it, of interfering, on the one hand, with the\r\nlegal rights and obligations of slavery; and, on the other, of\r\nperpetuating its existence within the limits of the country.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Mr. Clay, on behalf of the society, defined its\r\nposition thus:\r\n\r\n\"It protested, from the commencement, and throughout all its progress,\r\nand it now protests, that it entertains no purpose, on its own\r\nauthority, or by its own means, to attempt emancipation, partial or\r\ngeneral; that it knows the General Government has no constitutional\r\npower to achieve such an object; that it believes that the States, and\r\nthe States only, which tolerate slavery, can accomplish the work of\r\nemancipation; and that it ought to be left to them exclusively,\r\nabsolutely, and voluntarily, to decide the question.\"--_Tenth Annual\r\nReport, p. 14, 1828._\r\n\r\n[9] Gerrit Smith, 1835.\r\n\r\n[10] Lundy's Life.\r\n\r\n[11] On the floor of an Ecclesiastical Assembly, one minister pronounced\r\ncolonization \"a dead horse;\" while another claimed that his \"old mare\r\nwas giving freedom to more slaves, by trotting off with them to Canada,\r\nthan the Colonization Society was sending of emigrants to Liberia.\"\r\n\r\n[12] This portion of the work is left unchanged, and the statistics of\r\nthe increase of slave labor products, up to 1859, introduced elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[13] Deuteronomy, xxxii. 32, 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIONS OF AMERICAN SLAVERY TO THE INDUSTRIAL INTERESTS OF OUR\r\nCOUNTRY; TO THE DEMANDS OF COMMERCE; AND TO THE PRESENT POLITICAL\r\nCRISIS.\r\n\r\n          Present condition of Slavery--Not an isolated\r\n          system--Its relations to other industrial\r\n          interests--To manufactures, commerce, trade, human\r\n          comfort--Its benevolent aspect--The reverse\r\n          picture--Immense value of tropical possessions to\r\n          Great Britain--England's attempted monopoly of\r\n          Manufactures--Her dependence on American\r\n          Planters--Cotton Planters attempt to monopolize\r\n          Cotton markets--_Fusion_ of these parties--Free\r\n          Trade essential to their success--Influence on\r\n          agriculture, mechanics--Exports of Cotton,\r\n          Tobacco, etc.--Increased production of\r\n          Provisions--Their extent--New markets needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE institution of slavery, at this moment, gives indications of a\r\nvitality that was never anticipated by its friends or foes. Its enemies\r\noften supposed it about ready to expire, from the wounds they had\r\ninflicted, when in truth it had taken two steps in advance, while they\r\nhad taken twice the number in an opposite direction. In each successive\r\nconflict, its assailants have been weakened, while its dominion has been\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nThis has arisen from causes too generally overlooked. Slavery is not an\r\nisolated system, but is so mingled with the business of the world, that\r\nit derives facilities from the most innocent transactions. Capital and\r\nlabor, in Europe and America, are largely employed in the manufacture of\r\ncotton. These goods, to a great extent, may be seen freighting every\r\nvessel, from Christian nations, that traverses the seas of the globe;\r\nand filling the warehouses and shelves of the merchants over two-thirds\r\nof the world. By the industry, skill, and enterprise employed in the\r\nmanufacture of cotton, mankind are better clothed; their comfort better\r\npromoted; general industry more highly stimulated; commerce more widely\r\nextended; and civilization more rapidly advanced than in any preceding\r\nage.\r\n\r\nTo the superficial observer, all the agencies, based upon the sale and\r\nmanufacture of cotton, seem to be legitimately engaged in promoting\r\nhuman happiness; and he, doubtless, feels like invoking Heaven's\r\nchoicest blessings upon them. When he sees the stockholders in the\r\ncotton corporations receiving their dividends, the operatives their\r\nwages, the merchants their profits, and civilized people everywhere\r\nclothed comfortably in cottons, he can not refrain from exclaiming: The\r\nlines have fallen unto them in pleasant places; yea, they have a goodly\r\nheritage!\r\n\r\nBut turn a moment to the source whence the raw cotton, the basis of\r\nthese operations, is obtained, and observe the aspect of things in that\r\ndirection. When the statistics on the subject are examined, it appears\r\nthat nine-tenths of the cotton consumed in the Christian world is the\r\nproduct of the slave labor of the United States.[14] It is this monopoly\r\nthat has given to slavery its commercial value; and, while this monopoly\r\nis retained, the institution will continue to extend itself wherever it\r\ncan find room to spread. He who looks for any other result, must expect\r\nthat nations, which, for centuries, have waged war to extend their\r\ncommerce, will now abandon that means of aggrandizement, and bankrupt\r\nthemselves to force the abolition of American slavery!\r\n\r\nThis is not all. The economical value of slavery, as an agency for\r\nsupplying the means of extending manufactures and commerce, has long\r\nbeen understood by statesmen.[15] The discovery of the power of steam,\r\nand the inventions in machinery, for preparing and manufacturing cotton,\r\nrevealed the important fact, that a single island, having the monopoly\r\nsecured to itself, could supply the world with clothing. Great Britain\r\nattempted to gain this monopoly; and, to prevent other countries from\r\nrivaling her, she long prohibited all emigration of skillful mechanics\r\nfrom the kingdom, as well as all exports of machinery. As country after\r\ncountry was opened to her commerce, the markets for her manufactures\r\nwere extended, and the demand for the raw material increased. The\r\nbenefits of this enlarged commerce of the world, were not confined to a\r\nsingle nation, but mutually enjoyed by all. As each had products to\r\nsell, peculiar to itself, the advantages often gained by one were no\r\ndetriment to the others. The principal articles demanded by this\r\nincreasing commerce have been coffee, sugar, and cotton, in the\r\nproduction of which slave labor has greatly predominated. Since the\r\nenlargement of manufactures, cotton has entered more extensively into\r\ncommerce than coffee and sugar, though the demand for all three has\r\nadvanced with the greatest rapidity. England could only become a great\r\ncommercial nation, through the agency of her manufactures. She was the\r\nbest supplied, of all the nations, with the necessary capital, skill,\r\nlabor, and fuel, to extend her commerce by this means. But, for the raw\r\nmaterial, to supply her manufactories, she was dependent upon other\r\ncountries. The planters of the United States were the most favorably\r\nsituated for the cultivation of cotton; and while Great Britain was\r\naiming at monopolizing its manufacture, they attempted to monopolize the\r\nmarkets for that staple. This led to a fusion of interests between them\r\nand the British manufacturers; and to the adoption of principles in\r\npolitical economy, which, if rendered effective, would promote the\r\ninterests of this coalition. With the advantages possessed by the\r\nEnglish manufacturers, \"Free Trade\" would render all other nations\r\nsubservient to their interests; and, so far as their operations should\r\nbe increased, just so far would the demand for American cotton be\r\nextended. The details of the success of the parties to this combination,\r\nand the opposition they have had to encounter, are left to be noticed\r\nmore fully hereafter. To the cotton planters, the co-partnership has\r\nbeen eminently advantageous.\r\n\r\nHow far the other agricultural interests of the United States are\r\npromoted, by extending the cultivation of cotton, may be inferred from\r\nthe Census returns of 1850, and the Congressional Reports on Commerce\r\nand Navigation, for 1854.[16] Cotton and tobacco, only, are largely\r\nexported. The production of sugar does not yet equal our consumption of\r\nthe article, and we import, chiefly from slave labor countries,\r\n445,445,680 lbs. to make up the deficiency.[17] But of cotton and\r\ntobacco, we export more than _two-thirds_ of the amount produced; while\r\nof other products of the agriculturists, less than the _one forty-sixth_\r\npart is exported. Foreign nations, generally, can grow their provisions,\r\nbut can not grow their tobacco and cotton. Our surplus provisions, not\r\nexported, go to the villages, towns, and cities, to feed the mechanics,\r\nmanufacturers, merchants, professional men, and others; or to the cotton\r\nand sugar districts of the South, to feed the planters and their slaves.\r\nThe increase of mechanics and manufacturers at the North, and the\r\nexpansion of slavery at the South, therefore, augment the markets for\r\nprovisions, and promote the prosperity of the farmer. As the mechanical\r\npopulation increases, the implements of industry and articles of\r\nfurniture are multiplied, so that both farmer and planter can be\r\nsupplied with them on easier terms. As foreign nations open their\r\nmarkets to cotton fabrics, increased demands for the raw material are\r\nmade. As new grazing and grain-growing States are developed, and teem\r\nwith their surplus productions, the mechanic is benefited, and the\r\nplanter, relieved from food-raising, can employ his slaves more\r\nextensively upon cotton. It is thus that our exports are increased; our\r\nforeign commerce advanced; the home markets of the mechanic and farmer\r\nextended, and the wealth of the nation promoted. It is thus, also, that\r\nthe free labor of the country finds remunerating markets for its\r\nproducts--though at the expense of serving as an efficient auxiliary in\r\nthe extension of slavery!\r\n\r\nBut more: So speedily are new grain-growing States springing up; so\r\nvast is the territory owned by the United States, ready for settlement;\r\nand so enormous will soon be the amount of products demanding profitable\r\nmarkets, that the national government has been seeking new outlets for\r\nthem, upon our own continent, to which, alone, they can be\r\nadvantageously transported. That such outlets, when our vast possessions\r\nWestward are brought under cultivation, will be an imperious necessity,\r\nis known to every statesman. The farmers of these new States, after the\r\nexample of those of the older sections of the country, will demand a\r\nmarket for their products. This can be furnished, only, by the extension\r\nof slavery; by the acquisition of more tropical territory; by opening\r\nthe ports of Brazil, and other South American countries, to the\r\nadmission of our provisions; by their free importation into European\r\ncountries; or by a vast enlargement of domestic manufactures, to the\r\nexclusion of foreign goods from the country. Look at this question as it\r\nnow stands, and then judge of what it must be twenty years hence. The\r\nclass of products under consideration, in the whole country, in 1853,\r\nwere valued at $1,551,176,490; of which there were exported to foreign\r\ncountries, to the value of only $33,809,126.[18] The planter will not\r\nassent to any check upon the foreign imports of the country, for the\r\nbenefit of the farmer. This demands the adoption of vigorous measures to\r\nsecure a market for his products by some of the other modes stated.\r\nHence, the orders of our executive, in 1851, for the exploration of the\r\nvalley of the Amazon; the efforts, in 1854, to obtain a treaty with\r\nBrazil, for the free navigation of that immense river; the negotiations\r\nfor a military foothold in St. Domingo; and the determination to acquire\r\nCuba. But we must not anticipate topics to be considered at a later\r\nperiod in our discussion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] See Appendix, Table I.\r\n\r\n[15] It may be well here to illustrate this point, by an extract from\r\nMcQueen, of England, in 1844, when this highly intelligent gentleman was\r\nurging upon his government the great necessity which existed for\r\nsecuring to itself, as speedily as possible, the control of the labor\r\nand the products of tropical Africa. In reference to the benefits which\r\nhad been derived from her West India colonies, before the suppression of\r\nthe slave trade and the emancipation of the slaves had rendered them\r\ncomparatively unproductive, he said: \"During the fearful struggle of a\r\nquarter of a century, for her existence as a nation, against the power\r\nand resources of Europe, directed by the most intelligent but\r\nremorseless military ambition against her, the command of the\r\nproductions of the torrid zone, and the advantageous commerce which that\r\nafforded, gave to Great Britain the power and the resources which\r\nenabled her to meet, to combat, and to overcome, her numerous and\r\nreckless enemies in every battle-field, whether by sea or land,\r\nthroughout the world. In her the world saw realized the fabled giant of\r\nantiquity. With her hundred hands she grasped her foes in every region\r\nunder heaven, and crushed them with resistless energy.\"\r\n\r\nIn further presenting the considerations which he considered necessary\r\nto secure the adoption of the policy he was urging, Mr. McQueen referred\r\nto the difficulties which were then surrounding Great Britain, and the\r\nextent to which rival nations had surpassed her in tropical cultivation.\r\nHe continued: \"The increased cultivation and prosperity of foreign\r\ntropical possessions is become so great, and is advancing so rapidly the\r\npower and resources of other nations, that these are embarrassing this\r\ncountry, (England,) in all her commercial relations, in her pecuniary\r\nresources, and in all her political relations and negotiations.\" . . . .\r\n. . \"Instead of supplying her own wants with tropical productions, and\r\nnext nearly all Europe, as she formerly did, she had scarcely enough, of\r\nsome of the most important articles, for her own consumption, while her\r\ncolonies were mostly supplied with foreign slave produce.\" . . . . . .\r\n\"In the mean time tropical productions had been increased from\r\n$75,000,000, to $300,000,000 annually. The English capital invested in\r\ntropical productions in the East and West Indies, had been, by\r\nemancipation in the latter, reduced from $750,000,000, to $650,000,000;\r\nwhile, since 1808, on the part of foreign nations $4,000,000,000 of\r\nfixed capital had been created in slaves and in cultivation wholly\r\ndependent upon the labor of slaves.\" The odds, therefore, in\r\nagricultural and commercial capital and interest, and consequently in\r\npolitical power and influence, arrayed against the British tropical\r\npossessions, were very fearful--six to one. This will be better\r\nunderstood by giving the figures on the subject. The contrast is very\r\nstriking, and reveals the secret of England's untiring zeal about\r\nslavery and the slave trade. Indeed, Mr. McQueen frankly acknowledges,\r\nthat \"If the foreign slave trade be not extinguished, and the\r\ncultivation of the tropical territories of other powers opposed and\r\nchecked by British tropical cultivation, then the interests and the\r\npower of such states will rise into a preponderance over those of Great\r\nBritain; and the power and the influence of the latter will cease to be\r\nfelt, feared and respected, amongst the civilized and powerful nations\r\nof the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut here are the figures upon which this humiliating acknowledgement is\r\nmade.

The motives prompting her to this policy,\r\nneed not be referred to here, as they will be noticed hereafter. The\r\nHon. George Thompson, it will be remembered, when urging the increase of\r\ncotton cultivation in the East Indies, declared that the scheme must\r\nsucceed, and that, soon, all slave labor cotton would be repudiated by\r\nthe British manufacturers. Mr Garrison indorsed the measure, and\r\nexpressed his belief that, with its success, the American slave system\r\nmust inevitably perish from starvation! But England's efforts signally\r\nfailed, and the golden apple, fully ripened, dropped into the lap of our\r\ncotton planters.[19] The year that heard Thompson's pompous\r\npredictions,[20] witnessed the consumption of but 445,744,000 lbs. of\r\ncotton, by England; while, fourteen years later, she used 817,998,048\r\nlbs., nearly 700,000,000 lbs. of which were obtained from America!\r\n\r\nThat we have not overstated her dependence upon our slave labor for\r\ncotton is a fact of world-wide notoriety. _Blackwood's Magazine_,\r\nJanuary, 1853, in referring to the cultivation of the article, by the\r\nUnited States, says:\r\n\r\n\"With its increased growth has sprung up that mercantile navy, which now\r\nwaves its stripes and stars over every sea, and that foreign influence,\r\nwhich has placed the internal peace--we may say the subsistence of\r\nmillions in every manufacturing country in Europe--within the power of\r\nan oligarchy of planters.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the same subject, the _London Economist_ quotes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Let any great social or physical convulsion visit the United States,\r\nand England would feel the shock from Land's End to John O'Groats. The\r\nlives of nearly two millions of our countrymen are dependent upon the\r\ncotton crops of America; their destiny may be said, without any kind of\r\nhyperbole, to hang upon a thread. Should any dire calamity befall the\r\nland of cotton, a thousand of our merchant ships would rot idly in dock;\r\nten thousand mills must stop their busy looms; two thousand thousand\r\nmouths would starve, for lack of food to feed them.\"\r\n\r\nA more definite statement of England's indebtedness to cotton, is given\r\nby McCullough; who shows that as far back as 1832, her exports of cotton\r\nfabrics were equal in value to about two-thirds of all the woven fabrics\r\nexported from the empire. The same state of things, nearly, existed in\r\n1849, when the cotton fabrics exported, according to the _London\r\nEconomist_, were valued at about $140,000,000, while all the other woven\r\nfabrics exported did not quite reach to the value of $68,000,000. On\r\nconsulting the same authority, of still later dates, it appears, that\r\nthe last four years has produced no material change in the relations\r\nwhich the different classes of British fabrics, exported, bear to each\r\nother. The present condition of the demand and supplies of cotton,\r\nthroughout Europe, and the extent to which the increasing consumption of\r\nthat staple must stimulate the American planters to its increased\r\nproduction, will be noticed in the proper place.[21]\r\n\r\nThere was a time when American slave labor sustained no such relations\r\nto the manufactures and commerce of the world as it now so firmly holds;\r\nand when, by the adoption of proper measures, on the part of the free\r\ncolored people and their friends, the emancipation of the slaves, in all\r\nthe States, might, possibly, have been effected. But that period has\r\npassed forever away, and causes, unforeseen, have come into operation,\r\nwhich are too powerful to be overcome by any agencies that have since\r\nbeen employed.[22] What Divine Providence may have in store for the\r\nfuture, we know not; but, at present, the institution of slavery is\r\nsustained by numberless pillars, too massive for human power and wisdom\r\nto overthrow.\r\n\r\nTake another view of this subject. To say nothing now of the tobacco,\r\nrice, and sugar, which are the products of our slave labor, we exported\r\nraw cotton to the value of $109,456,404 in 1853. Its destination was, to\r\nGreat Britain, 768,596,498 lbs.; to the Continent of Europe, 335,271,434\r\nlbs.; to countries on our own Continent, 7,702,438 lbs.; making the\r\ntotal exports, 1,111,570,370 lbs. The entire crop of that year being\r\n1,305,152,800 lbs., gives, for home consumption, 268,403,600 lbs.[23] Of\r\nthis, there was manufactured into cotton fabrics to the value of\r\n$61,869,274;[24] of which there was retained, for home markets, to the\r\nvalue of $53,100,290. Our imports of cotton fabrics from Europe, in\r\n1853, for consumption, amounted in value to $26,477,950:[25] thus\r\nmaking our cottons, foreign and domestic, for that year, cost us\r\n$79,578,240.\r\n\r\nIn bringing down the results to 1858, it will be seen that the imports\r\nof foreign cotton goods has fluctuated at higher and lower amounts than\r\nthose of 1853; and that an actual decrease of our exports of cotton\r\nmanufactures has taken place since that date.[26] But in the exports of\r\nraw cotton there has been an increase of nearly a hundred millions of\r\npounds over that of 1853--the total exports of 1859 being 1,208,561,200\r\nlbs. The total crop of 1859, in the United States, was 1,606,800,000\r\nlbs., and the amount taken for consumption 371,060,800 lbs.[27]\r\n\r\nThus, while our consumption of foreign cotton goods is not on the\r\nincrease, the foreign demand for our raw cotton is rapidly augmenting;\r\nand thus the American planter is becoming more and more important to the\r\nmanufactures and commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nThis, now, is what becomes of our cotton; this is the way in which it so\r\nlargely constitutes the basis of commerce and trade; and this is the\r\nnature of the relations existing between the slavery of the United\r\nStates and the economical interests of the world.\r\n\r\nBut have the United States no other great leading interests, except\r\nthose which are involved in the production of cotton? Certainly, they\r\nhave. Here is a great field for the growth of provisions. In ordinary\r\nyears, exclusive of tobacco and cotton, our agricultural property, when\r\nadded to the domestic animals and their products, amounts in value\r\n$1,551,176,490. Of this, there is exported only to the value of\r\n$33,809,126; which leaves for home consumption and use, a remainder to\r\nthe value of $1,517,367,364.[28] The portions of the property\r\nrepresented by this immense sum of money, which pass from the hands of\r\nthe agriculturists, are distributed throughout the Union, for the\r\nsupport of the day laborers, sailors, mechanics, manufacturers, traders,\r\nmerchants, professional men, planters, and the slave population. This is\r\nwhat becomes of our provisions.\r\n\r\nBesides this annual consumption of provisions, most of which is the\r\nproduct of free labor, the people of the United States use a vast amount\r\nof groceries, which are mainly of slave labor origin. Boundless as is\r\nthe influence of cotton, in stimulating slavery extension, that of the\r\ncultivation of groceries falls but little short of it; the chief\r\ndifference being, that they do not receive such an increased value under\r\nthe hand of manufacturers. The cultivation of coffee, in Brazil, employs\r\nas great a number of slaves as that of cotton in the United States.\r\n\r\nBut, to comprehend fully our indebtedness to slave labor for groceries,\r\nwe must descend to particulars. Our imports of coffee, tobacco, sugar,\r\nand molasses, for 1853, amounted in value to $38,479,000; of which the\r\nhand of the slave, in Brazil and Cuba, mainly, supplied to the value of\r\n$34,451,000.[29] This shows the extent to which we are sustaining\r\nforeign slavery, by the consumption of these four products. But this is\r\nnot our whole indebtedness to slavery for groceries. Of the domestic\r\ngrown tobacco, valued at $19,975,000, of which we retain nearly\r\none-half, the Slave States produce to the value of $16,787,000; of\r\ndomestic rice, the product of the South, we consume to the value of\r\n$7,092,000; of domestic slave grown sugar and molasses, we take, for\r\nhome consumption, to the value of $34,779,000; making our grocery\r\naccount, with domestic slavery, foot up to the sum of $50,449,000. Our\r\nwhole indebtedness, then, to slavery, foreign and domestic, for these\r\nfour commodities, after deducting two millions of re-exports amounts to\r\n$82,607,000.\r\n\r\nThe exports of tobacco are on the increase, as appears from Table VIII\r\nof Appendix, showing an extension of its cultivation; but the exports of\r\nrice are not on the increase, from which it would appear that its\r\nproduction remains stationary.\r\n\r\nBy adding the value of the foreign and domestic cotton fabrics,\r\nconsumed annually in the United States, to the yearly cost of the\r\ngroceries which the country uses, our total indebtedness, for articles\r\nof slave labor origin, will be found swelling up to the enormous sum of\r\n$162,185,240.[30]\r\n\r\nWe have now seen the channels through which our cotton passes off into\r\nthe great sea of commerce, to furnish the world its clothing. We have\r\nseen the origin and value of our provisions, and to whom they are sold.\r\nWe have seen the sources whence our groceries are derived, and the\r\nmillions of money they cost. To ascertain how far these several\r\ninterests are sustained by one another, will be to determine how far any\r\none of them becomes an element of expansion to the others. To decide a\r\nquestion of this nature with precision is impracticable. The statistics\r\nare not attainable. It may be illustrated, however, in various ways, so\r\nas to obtain a conclusion proximately accurate. Suppose, for example,\r\nthat the supplies of food from the North were cut off, the manufactories\r\nleft in their present condition, and the planters forced to raise their\r\nprovisions and draught animals: in such circumstances, the export of\r\ncotton must cease, as the lands of these States could not be made to\r\nyield more than would subsist their own population, and supply the\r\ncotton demanded by the Northern States. Now, if this be true of the\r\nagricultural resources of the cotton States--and it is believed to be\r\nnearly the full extent of their capacity--then the surplus of cotton, to\r\nthe value of more than a hundred millions of dollars, now annually sent\r\nabroad, stands as the representative of the yearly supplies which the\r\ncotton planters receive from the farmers north of the cotton line. This,\r\ntherefore, as will afterward more fully appear, may be taken as the\r\nprobable extent to which the supplies from the North serve as an element\r\nof slavery expansion in the article of cotton alone.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Paganism has, long since, attained its maximum in agricultural\r\nindustry, and the introduction of Christian civilization, into India,\r\ncan, alone, lead to an increase of its productions for export.\r\n\r\n[20] 1839.\r\n\r\n[21] ENGLAND AND SLAVERY.--In the _London Times_ of October 7th, 1858,\r\nthere is a long and very able and candid article on the subject of\r\ncotton. The proportions of the article used by different nations are\r\nthus stated:\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, 51.28 France, 13.24 Northern Europe, 6.84 Other foreign\r\nports, 5.91 Consumption of the U. S., 23.58\r\n\r\nThus it appears that England uses more of the raw material than all the\r\nrest of the world. After giving the great facts the writer uses the\r\nfollowing language:\r\n\r\n\"An advance of one pence per pound on the price of American cotton is\r\nwelcomed by the slave-owner of the Southern States as supplying him with\r\nthe sinews of war for the struggle now waging with the Northern\r\nabolitionists. This mere advance of one pence on our present annual\r\nconsumption is equivalent to an annual subscription of sixteen millions\r\nof dollars toward the maintainance of American slavery.\"--_American\r\nMissionary._\r\n\r\n[22] See the speech of the Hon. Gerrit Smith, on the \"Kansas-Nebraska\r\nBill,\" in which he asserts, that the invention of the _Cotton Gin_\r\nfastened slavery upon the country; and that, but for its invention,\r\nslavery would long since have disappeared.\r\n\r\n[23] This is only the consumption north of Virginia.\r\n\r\n[24] This estimate is probably too low, being taken from the census of\r\n1850. The exports of cottons for 1850 were $4,734,424; and for 1353,\r\n$8,768,894; having nearly doubled in four years.\r\n\r\n[25] These figures were taken from the official documents for the first\r\nedition. They vary a little from the revised documents from which Table\r\nVII is taken, but not so as to affect our argument.\r\n\r\n[26] See Table VII, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n[27] See Table VI, in Appendix; and in this connection it may be\r\nexplained that the _crop year_ ends August 31st.\r\n\r\n[28] See Table II, in Appendix. We have of course to limit our\r\nstatements in relation to some of these amounts to the figures used in\r\nthe first edition, because they can only be ascertained from the census\r\ntables of 1850. While it will be found that the exports of bread-stuffs\r\nand provisions have increased considerably, it will be seen from Table\r\nVIII that it is not in a greater ratio than the exports of cotton and\r\ntobacco. To show that the statement as it stands was a fair one at the\r\ntime, it is only necessary for the reader to look at the last named\r\ntable to see that the three years preceding 1853 exported considerably\r\nless than that year.\r\n\r\n[29] See Table III, Appendix.\r\n\r\n[30] These estimates have not been recast and adapted to 1859, for the\r\nthird edition, because, as will be seen from Tables VII, VIII and X,\r\nthere has been no great change in the amount of these commodities\r\nconsumed since 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n          Economical relations of Slavery further\r\n          considered--System unprofitable in grain growing,\r\n          but profitable in culture of Cotton--Antagonism of\r\n          Farmer and Planter--\"Protection,\" and, \"Free\r\n          Trade\" controversy--Congressional Debates on the\r\n          subject--Mr. Clay--Position of the South--\"Free\r\n          Trade,\" considered indispensable to its\r\n          prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT the subject of the relations of American slavery to the economical\r\ninterests of the world, demands a still closer scrutiny, in order that\r\nthe causes of the failure of abolitionism to arrest its progress, as\r\nwell as the present relations of the institution to the politics of the\r\ncountry, may fully appear.\r\n\r\nSlave labor has seldom been made profitable where it has been wholly\r\nemployed in grazing and grain growing; but it becomes remunerative in\r\nproportion as the planters can devote their attention to cotton, sugar,\r\nrice, or tobacco. To render Southern slavery profitable in the highest\r\ndegree, therefore, the slaves must be employed upon some one of these\r\narticles, and be sustained by a supply of food and draught animals from\r\nNorthern agriculturists; and before the planter's supplies are complete,\r\nto these must be added cotton gins, implements of husbandry, furniture,\r\nand tools, from Northern mechanics. This is a point of the utmost\r\nmoment, and must be considered more at length.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a vital question to the success of the slaveholder, to\r\nknow how he could render the labor of his slaves the most profitable.\r\nThe grain growing States had to emancipate their slaves, to rid\r\nthemselves of a profitless system. The cotton-growing States, ever after\r\nthe invention of the cotton gin, had found the production of that staple\r\nhighly remunerative. The logical conclusion, from these different\r\nresults, was, that the less provisions, and the more cotton grown by the\r\nplanter, the greater would be his profits. This must be noted with\r\nspecial care. _Markets_ for the surplus products of the farmer of the\r\nNorth, were equally as important to him as the supply of _Provisions_\r\nwas to the planter. But the planter, to be eminently successful, must\r\npurchase his supplies at the lowest possible prices; while the farmer,\r\nto secure his prosperity, must sell his products at the highest possible\r\nrates. Few, indeed, can be so ill informed, as not to know, that these\r\ntwo topics, for many years, were involved in the \"Free Trade\" and\r\n\"Protective Tariff\" doctrines, and afforded the _materiel_ of the\r\npolitical contests between the North and the South--between free labor\r\nand slave labor. A very brief notice of the history of that controversy,\r\nwill demonstrate the truth of this assertion.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of the agricultural States, thirty years since, to establish\r\nthe protective policy, and promote \"Domestic Manufactures,\" was a\r\nstruggle to create such a division of labor as would afford a \"Home\r\nMarket\" for their products, no longer in demand abroad. The first\r\ndecisive action on the question, by Congress, was in 1824; when the\r\ndistress in these States, and the measures proposed for their relief, by\r\nnational legislation, were discussed on the passage of the \"Tariff Bill\"\r\nof that year. The ablest men in the nation were engaged in the\r\ncontroversy. As provisions are the most important item on the one hand,\r\nand cotton on the other, we shall use these two terms as the\r\nrepresentatives of the two classes of products, belonging, respectively,\r\nto free labor and to slave labor.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay, in the course of the debate, said: \"What, again, I would ask,\r\nis the cause of the unhappy condition of our country, which I have\r\nfairly depicted? It is to be found in the fact that, during almost the\r\nwhole existence of this government, we have shaped our industry, our\r\nnavigation, and our commerce, in reference to an extraordinary war in\r\nEurope, and to foreign markets which no longer exist; in the fact that\r\nwe have depended too much on foreign sources of supply, and excited too\r\nlittle the native; in the fact that, while we have cultivated, with\r\nassiduous care, our foreign resources, we have suffered those at home to\r\nwither, in a state of neglect and abandonment. The consequence of the\r\ntermination of the war of Europe, has been the resumption of European\r\ncommerce, European navigation, and the extension of European\r\nagriculture, in all its branches. Europe, therefore, has no longer\r\noccasion for any thing like the same extent as that which she had during\r\nher wars, for American commerce, American navigation, the produce of\r\nAmerican industry. Europe in commotion, and convulsed throughout all her\r\nmembers, is to America no longer the same Europe as she is now,\r\ntranquil, and watching with the most vigilant attention, all her own\r\npeculiar interests, without regard to their operation on us. The effect\r\nof this altered state of Europe upon us, has been to circumscribe the\r\nemployment of our marine, and greatly to reduce the value of the produce\r\nof our territorial labor. . . . . The greatest want of civilized society\r\nis a market for the sale and exchange of the surplus of the products of\r\nthe labor of its members. This market may exist at home or abroad, or\r\nboth, but it must exist somewhere, if society prospers; and, wherever it\r\ndoes exist, it should be competent to the absorption of the entire\r\nsurplus production. It is most desirable that there should be both a\r\nhome and a foreign market. But with respect to their relative\r\nsuperiority, I can not entertain a doubt. The home market is first in\r\norder, and paramount in importance. The object of the bill under\r\nconsideration, is to create this home market, and to lay the foundation\r\nof a genuine American policy. It is opposed; and it is incumbent on the\r\npartisans of the foreign policy (terms which I shall use without any\r\ninvidious intent) to demonstrate that the foreign market is an adequate\r\nvent for the surplus produce of our labor. But is it so? 1. Foreign\r\nnations can not, if they would, take our surplus produce. . . . . 2. If\r\nthey could, they would not. . . . . We have seen, I think, the causes of\r\nthe distress of the country. We have seen that an exclusive dependence\r\nupon the foreign market must lead to a still severer distress, to\r\nimpoverishment, to ruin. We must, then, change somewhat our course. We\r\nmust give a new direction to some portion of our industry. We must\r\nspeedily adopt a genuine American policy. Still cherishing a foreign\r\nmarket, let us create also a home market, to give further scope to the\r\nconsumption of the produce of American industry. Let us counteract the\r\npolicy of foreigners, and withdraw the support which we now give to\r\ntheir industry, and stimulate that of our own country. . . . . The\r\ncreation of a home market is not only necessary to procure for our\r\nagriculture a just reward of its labors, but it is indispensable to\r\nobtain a supply of our necessary wants. If we can not sell, we can not\r\nbuy. That portion of our population (and we have seen that it is not\r\nless than four-fifths) which makes comparatively nothing that foreigners\r\nwill buy, has nothing to make purchases with from foreigners. It is in\r\nvain that we are told of the amount of our exports, supplied by the\r\nplanting interest. They may enable the planting interest to supply all\r\nits wants; but they bring no ability to the interests not planting,\r\nunless, which can not be pretended, the planting interest was an\r\nadequate vent for the surplus produce of all the labor of all other\r\ninterests. . . . . But this home market, highly desirable as it is, can\r\nonly be created and cherished by the protection of our own legislation\r\nagainst the inevitable prostration of our industry, which must ensue\r\nfrom the action of FOREIGN policy and legislation. . . . . The sole\r\nobject of the tariff is to tax the produce of foreign industry, with the\r\nview of promoting American industry. . . . . But it is said by the\r\nhonorable gentleman from Virginia, that the South, owing to the\r\ncharacter of a certain portion of its population, can not engage in the\r\nbusiness of manufacturing. . . . . The circumstances of its degradation\r\nunfits it for manufacturing arts. The well-being of the other, and the\r\nlarger part of our population, requires the introduction of those arts.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done in this conflict? The gentleman would have us\r\nabstain from adopting a policy called for by the interests of the\r\ngreater and freer part of the population. But is that reasonable? Can it\r\nbe expected that the interests of the greater part should be made to\r\nbend to the condition of the servile part of our population? That, in\r\neffect, would be to make us the slaves of slaves. . . . . I am sure that\r\nthe patriotism of the South may be exclusively relied upon to reject a\r\npolicy which should be dictated by considerations altogether connected\r\nwith that degraded class, to the prejudice of the residue of our\r\npopulation. But does not a perseverance in the foreign policy, as it now\r\nexists, in fact, make all parts of the Union, not planting, tributary to\r\nthe planting parts? What is the argument? It is, that we must continue\r\nfreely to receive the produce of foreign industry, without regard to the\r\nprotection of American industry, that a market may be retained for the\r\nsale abroad of the produce of the planting portion of the country; and\r\nthat, if we lessen the consumption, in all parts of America, those which\r\nare not planting, as well as the planting sections, of foreign\r\nmanufactures, we diminish to that extent the foreign market for the\r\nplanting produce. The existing state of things, indeed, presents a sort\r\nof tacit compact between the cotton-grower and the British manufacturer,\r\nthe stipulations of which are, on the part of the cotton-grower, that\r\nthe whole of the United States, the other portions as well as the\r\ncotton-growing, shall remain open and unrestricted in the consumption of\r\nBritish manufactures; and, on the part of the British manufacturer,\r\nthat, in consideration thereof, he will continue to purchase the cotton\r\nof the South. Thus, then, we perceive that the proposed measure, instead\r\nof sacrificing the South to the other parts of the Union, seeks only to\r\npreserve them from being actually sacrificed under the operation of the\r\ntacit compact which I have described.\"\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the Protective Tariff, by the South, arose from two\r\ncauses: the first openly avowed at the time, and the second clearly\r\ndeducible from the policy it pursued: the one to secure the foreign\r\nmarket for its cotton, the other to obtain a bountiful supply of\r\nprovisions at cheap rates. Cotton was admitted free of duty into foreign\r\ncountries, and Southern statesmen feared its exclusion, if our\r\ngovernment increased the duties on foreign fabrics. The South exported\r\nabout twice as much of that staple as was supplied to Europe by all\r\nother countries, and there were indications favoring the desire it\r\nentertained of monopolizing the foreign markets. The West India planters\r\ncould not import food, but at such high rates as to make it\r\nimpracticable to grow cotton at prices low enough to suit the English\r\nmanufacturer. To purchase cotton cheaply, was essential to the success\r\nof his scheme of monopolizing its manufacture, and supplying the world\r\nwith clothing. The close proximity of the provision and cotton-growing\r\ndistricts in the United States, gave its planters advantages over all\r\nother portions of the world. But they could not monopolize the markets,\r\nunless they could obtain a cheap supply of food and clothing for their\r\nnegroes, and raise their cotton at such reduced prices as to undersell\r\ntheir rivals. A manufacturing population, with its mechanical\r\ncoadjutors, in the midst of the provision-growers, on a scale such as\r\nthe protective policy contemplated, it was conceived, would create a\r\npermanent market for their products, and enhance the price; whereas, if\r\nthis manufacturing could be prevented, and a system of free trade\r\nadopted, the South would constitute the principal provision market of\r\nthe country, and the fertile lands of the North supply the cheap food\r\ndemanded for its slaves. As the tariff policy, in the outset,\r\ncontemplated the encouragement of the production of iron, hemp, whisky,\r\nand the establishment of woolen manufactories, principally, the South\r\nfound its interests but slightly identified with the system--the coarser\r\nqualities of cottons, only, being manufactured in the country, and, even\r\nthese, on a diminished scale, as compared with the cotton crops of the\r\nSouth. Cotton, up to the date when this controversy had been fairly\r\ncommenced, had been worth, in the English market, an average price of\r\nfrom 29 7/10 to 48 4/10 cents per lb.[31] But at this period, a wide\r\nspread and ruinous depression both in the culture and manufacture of the\r\narticle, occurred--cotton, in 1826, having fallen, in England, as low as\r\n11 9/10 to 18 9/10 cents per lb. The home market, then, was too\r\ninconsiderable to be of much importance, and there existed little hope\r\nof its enlargement to the extent demanded by its increasing cultivation.\r\nThe planters, therefore, looked abroad to the existing markets, rather\r\nthan to wait for tardily creating one at home. For success in the\r\nforeign markets, they relied, mainly, upon preparing themselves to\r\nproduce cotton at the reduced prices then prevailing in Europe. All\r\nagricultural products, except cotton, being excluded from foreign\r\nmarkets, the planters found themselves almost the sole exporters of the\r\ncountry; and it was to them a source of chagrin, that the North did not,\r\nat once, co-operate with them in augmenting the commerce of the nation.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the history of the controversy, politicians found it an\r\neasy matter to produce feelings of the deepest hostility between the\r\nopposing parties. The planters were led to believe that the millions of\r\nrevenue collected off the goods imported, was so much deducted from the\r\nvalue of the cotton that paid for them, either in the diminished price\r\nthey received abroad, or in the increased price which they paid for the\r\nimported articles. To enhance the duties, for the protection of our\r\nmanufacturers, they were persuaded, would be so much of an additional\r\ntax upon themselves, for the benefit of the North; and, beside, to give\r\nthe manufacturer such a monopoly of the home market for his fabrics,\r\nwould enable him to charge purchasers an excess over the true value of\r\nhis stuffs, to the whole amount of the duty. By the protective policy,\r\nthe planters expected to have the cost of both provisions and clothing\r\nincreased, and their ability to monopolize the foreign markets\r\ndiminished in a corresponding degree. If they could establish free\r\ntrade, it would insure the American market to foreign manufacturers;\r\nsecure the foreign markets for their leading staple; repress home\r\nmanufactures; force a large number of the Northern men into\r\nagriculture; multiply the growth, and diminish the price of provisions;\r\nfeed and clothe their slaves at lower rates; produce their cotton for a\r\nthird or fourth of former prices; rival all other countries in its\r\ncultivation; monopolize the trade in the article throughout the whole of\r\nEurope; and build up a commerce and a navy that would make us ruler of\r\nthe seas.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[31] This includes the period from 1806 to 1826, though the decline\r\nbegan a few years before the latter date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n          Tariff controversy continued--Mr. Hayne--Mr.\r\n          Carter--Mr. Govan--Mr. Martindale--Mr.\r\n          Buchanan--Sugar Planters invoked to aid Free\r\n          Trade--The West also invoked--Its pecuniary\r\n          embarrassments for want of markets--Henry\r\n          Baldwin--Remarks on the views of the\r\n          parties--State of the world--Dread of the\r\n          Protective policy by the Planters--Their schemes\r\n          to avert its consequences, and promote Free Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO understand the sentiments of the South, on the Protective Policy, as\r\nexpressed by its statesmen, we must again quote from the Congressional\r\nDebates of 1824:\r\n\r\nMr. Hayne, of South Carolina, said: \"But how, I would seriously ask, is\r\nit possible for the home market to supply the place of the foreign\r\nmarket, for our cotton? We supply Great Britain with the raw material,\r\nout of which she furnishes the Continent of Europe, nay, the whole\r\nworld, with cotton goods. Now, suppose our manufactories could make\r\nevery yard of cloth we consume, that would furnish a home market for no\r\nmore than 20,000,000 lbs. out of the 180,000,000 lbs. of cotton now\r\nshipped to Great Britain; leaving on our hands 160,000,000 lbs., equal\r\nto two-thirds of our whole produce. . . . . Considering this scheme of\r\npromoting certain employments, at the expense of others, as unequal,\r\noppressive, and unjust--viewing prohibition as the _means_, and the\r\ndestruction of all foreign commerce as the _end_ of this policy--I take\r\nthis occasion to declare, that we shall feel ourselves, justified in\r\nembracing the very first opportunity of repealing all such laws as may\r\nbe passed for the promotion of these objects.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Carter, of South Carolina, said: \"Another danger to which the\r\npresent measure would expose this country, and one in which the\r\nSouthern States have a deep and vital interest, would be the risk we\r\nincur, by this system of exclusion, of driving Great Britain to\r\ncountervailing measures, and inducing all other countries, with whom the\r\nUnited States have any considerable trading connections, to resort to\r\nmeasures of retaliation. There are countries possessing vast capacities\r\nfor the production of rice, of cotton, and of tobacco, to which England\r\nmight resort to supply herself. She might apply herself to Brazil,\r\nBengal, and Egypt, for her cotton; to South America, as well as to her\r\ncolonies, for her tobacco; and to China and Turkey for her rice.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Govan, of South Carolina, said: \"The effect of this measure on the\r\ncotton, rice, and tobacco-growing States, will be pernicious in the\r\nextreme:--it will exclude them from those markets where they depended\r\nalmost entirely for a sale of those articles, and force Great Britain to\r\nencourage the cottons, (Brazil, Rio Janeiro, and Buenos Ayres,) which,\r\nin a short time, can be brought in competition with us. Nothing but the\r\nconsumption of British goods in this country, received in exchange, can\r\nsupport a command of the cotton market to the Southern planter. It is\r\none thing very certain, she will not come here with her gold and silver\r\nto trade with us. And should Great Britain, pursuing the principles of\r\nher reciprocal duty act, of last June, lay three or four cents on our\r\ncotton, where would, I ask, be our surplus of cotton? It is well known\r\nthat the United States can not manufacture one-fourth of the cotton that\r\nis in it; and should we, by our imprudent legislative enactments, in\r\npursuing to such an extent this restrictive system, force Great Britain\r\nto shut her ports against us, it will paralyze the whole trade of the\r\nSouthern country. This export trade, which composes five-sixths of the\r\nexport trade of the United States, will be swept entirely from the\r\nocean, and leave but a melancholy wreck behind.\"\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, also, to add a few additional extracts, from the\r\nspeeches of Northern statesmen, during this discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Martindale, of New York, said: \"Does not the agriculture of the\r\ncountry languish, and the laborer stand still, because, beyond the\r\nsupply of food for his own family, his produce perishes on his hands, or\r\nhis fields lie waste and fallow; and this because his accustomed market\r\nis closed against him? It does, sir. . . . . A twenty years' war in Europe,\r\nwhich drew into its vortex all its various nations, made our merchants\r\nthe carriers of a large portion of the world, and our farmers the\r\nfeeders of immense belligerent armies. An unexampled activity and\r\nincrease in our commerce followed--our agriculture extended itself, grew\r\nand nourished. An unprecedented demand gave the farmer an extraordinary\r\nprice for his produce. . . . . Imports kept pace with exports, and\r\nconsumption with both. . . . . Peace came into Europe, and shut out our\r\nexports, and found us in war with England, which almost cut off our\r\nimports. . . . . Now we felt how _comfortable_ it was to have plenty of\r\nfood, but no clothing. . . . . Now we felt the imperfect organization of\r\nour system. Now we saw the imperfect distribution and classification of\r\nlabor. . . . . Here is the explanation of our opposite views. It is\r\nemployment, after all, that we are all in search of. It is a market for\r\nour labor and our produce, which we all want, and all contend for. 'Buy\r\nforeign goods, that we may import,' say the merchants: it will make a\r\nmarket for importations, and find employment for our ships. Buy English\r\nmanufactures, say the cotton planters; England will take our cotton in\r\nexchange. Thus the merchant and the cotton planter fully appreciate the\r\nvalue of a market when they find their own encroached upon. The farmer\r\nand manufacturer claim to participate in the benefits of a market for\r\ntheir labor and produce; and hence this protracted debate and struggle\r\nof contending interests. It is a contest for a market between the\r\n_cotton-grower and the merchant_ on the one side, and the _farmer and\r\nthe manufacturer_ on the other. That the manufacturer would furnish this\r\nmarket to the farmer, admits no doubt. The farmer should reciprocate the\r\nfavor; and government is now called upon to render this market\r\naccessible to foreign fabrics for the mutual benefit of both. . . . .\r\nThis, then, is the remedy we propose, sir, for the evils which we suffer.\r\nPlace the mechanic by the side of the farmer, that the manufacturer who\r\nmakes our cloth, should make it from _our_ farmers' wool, flax, hemp,\r\netc., and be fed by our farmers' provisions. Draw forth our iron from\r\nour own mountains, and we shall not drain our country in the purchase of\r\nthe foreign. . . . . We propose, sir, to supply our own wants from our own\r\nresources, by the means which God and Nature have placed in our\r\nhands. . . . . But here is a question of sectional interest, which elicits\r\nunfriendly feelings and determined hostility to the bill. . . . . The\r\ncotton, rice, tobacco, and indigo-growers of the Southern States, claim\r\nto be deeply affected and injured by this system. . . . . Let us\r\ninquire if the Southern planter does not demand what, in fact, he denies\r\nto others. And now, what does he request? That the North and West should\r\nbuy--what? Not their cotton, tobacco, etc., for that we do already, to\r\nthe utmost of our ability to consume, or pay, or vend to others; and\r\nthat is to an immense amount, greatly exceeding what they purchase of\r\nus. But they insist that we should buy English wool, wrought into cloth,\r\nthat they may pay for it with their cotton; that we should buy Russia\r\niron, that they may sell their cotton; that we should buy Holland gin\r\nand linen, that they may sell their tobacco. In fine, that we should not\r\ngrow wool, and dig and smelt the iron of the country; for, if we did,\r\nthey could not sell their cotton.\" (On another occasion, he said:)\r\n\"Gentlemen say they _will_ oppose every part of the bill. They will,\r\ntherefore, move to strike out every part of it. And, on every such\r\nmotion, we shall hear repeated, as we have done already, the same\r\nobjections: that it will ruin trade and commerce; that it will destroy\r\nthe revenue, and prostrate the navy; that it will enhance the prices of\r\narticles of the first necessity, and thus be taxing the poor; and that\r\nit will destroy the cotton market, _and stop the future growth of\r\ncotton_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan, of Pennsylvania, said: \"No nation can be perfectly\r\nindependent which depends upon foreign countries for its supply of iron.\r\nIt is an article equally necessary in peace and in war. Without a\r\nplentiful supply of it, we cannot provide for the common defense. Can we\r\nso soon have forgotten the lesson which experience taught us during the\r\nlate war with Great Britain? Our foreign supply was then cut off, and we\r\ncould not manufacture in sufficient quantities for the increased\r\ndomestic demand. The price of the article became extravagant, and both\r\nthe Government and the agriculturist were compelled to pay double the\r\nsum for which they might have purchased it, had its manufacture, before\r\nthat period, been encouraged by proper protecting duties.\"\r\n\r\nSugar cane, at that period, had become an article of culture in\r\nLouisiana, and efforts were made to persuade her planters into the\r\nadoption of the Free Trade system. It was urged that they could more\r\neffectually resist foreign competition, and extend their business, by a\r\ncheap supply of food, than by protective duties. But the Louisianians\r\nwere too wise not to know, that though they would certainly obtain\r\ncheap provisions by the destruction of Northern manufactures, still,\r\nthis would not enable them to compete with the cheaper labor supplied by\r\nthe slave trade to the Cubans.\r\n\r\nThe West, for many years, gave its undivided support to the\r\nmanufacturing interests, thereby obtaining a heavy duty on hemp, wool,\r\nand foreign distilled spirits: thus securing encouragement to its hemp\r\nand wool-growers, and the monopoly of the home market for its whisky.\r\nThe distiller and the manufacturer, under this system, were equally\r\nranked as public benefactors, as each increased the consumption of the\r\nsurplus products of the farmer. The grain of the West could find no\r\nremunerative market, except as fed to domestic animals for droving East\r\nand South, or distilled into whisky which would bear transportation.\r\nTake a fact in proof of this assertion. Hon. Henry Baldwin, of\r\nPittsburgh, at a public dinner given him by the friends of General\r\nJackson, in Cincinnati, May, 1828, in referring to the want of markets,\r\nfor the farmers of the West, said, \"He was certain, the aggregate of\r\ntheir agricultural produce, finding a market in Europe, would not pay\r\nfor the pins and needles they imported.\"\r\n\r\nThe markets in the Southwest, now so important, were then quite limited.\r\nAs the protective system, coupled with the contemplated internal\r\nimprovements, if successfully accomplished, would inevitably tend to\r\nenhance the price of agricultural products; while the free trade and\r\nanti-internal improvement policy, would as certainly reduce their value;\r\nthe two systems were long considered so antagonistic, that the success\r\nof the one must sound the knell of the other. Indeed, so fully was Ohio\r\nimpressed with the necessity of promoting manufactures, that all capital\r\nthus employed, was for many years entirely exempt from taxation.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that the friends of protection appealed to the fact, that\r\nthe duties levied on foreign goods did not necessarily enhance their\r\ncost to the consumer; that the competition among home manufacturers, and\r\nbetween them and foreigners, had greatly reduced the price of nearly\r\nevery article properly protected; that foreign manufacturers always had,\r\nand always would advance their prices according to our dependence upon\r\nthem; that domestic competition was the only safety the country had\r\nagainst foreign imposition; that it was necessary we should become our\r\nown manufacturers, in a fair degree, to render ourselves independent of\r\nother nations in times of war, as well as to guard against the\r\nvacillations in foreign legislation; that the South would be vastly the\r\ngainer by having the market for its products at its own doors, to avoid\r\nthe cost of their transit across the Atlantic; that, in the event of the\r\nrepression or want of proper extension of our manufactures, by the\r\nadoption of the free trade system, the imports of foreign goods, to meet\r\nthe public wants, would soon exceed the ability of the people to pay,\r\nand, inevitably, involve the country in bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nSouthern politicians remained inflexible, and refused to accept any\r\npolicy except free trade, to the utter abandonment of the principle of\r\nprotection. Whether they were jealous of the greater prosperity of the\r\nNorth, and desirous to cripple its energies, or whether they were truly\r\nfearful of bankrupting the South, we shall not wait to inquire. Justice\r\ndemands, however, that we should state that the South was suffering from\r\nthe stagnation in the cotton trade existing throughout Europe. The\r\nplanters had been unused to the low prices, for that staple, they were\r\ncompelled to accept. They had no prospect of an adequate home market for\r\nmany years to come, and there were indications that they might lose the\r\none they already possessed. The West Indies was still slave territory,\r\nand attempting to recover its early position in the English market. This\r\nit had to do, or be forced into emancipation. The powerful Viceroy of\r\nEgypt, Mehemet Ali, was endeavoring to compel his subjects to grow\r\ncotton on an enlarged scale. The newly organized South American\r\nrepublics were assuming an aspect of commercial consequence, and might\r\ncommence its cultivation. The East Indies and Brazil were supplying to\r\nGreat Britain from one-third to one-half of the cotton she was annually\r\nmanufacturing. The other half, or two-thirds, she might obtain from\r\nother sources, and repudiate all traffic with our planters. Southern\r\nmen, therefore, could not conceive of any thing but ruin to themselves,\r\nby any considerable advance in duties on foreign imports. They\r\nunderstood the protective policy as contemplating the supply of our\r\ncountry with home manufactured articles to the exclusion of those of\r\nforeign countries. This would confine the planters, in the sale of their\r\ncotton, to the American market mainly, and leave them in the power of\r\nmoneyed corporations; which, possessing the ability, might control the\r\nprices of their staple, to the irreparable injury of the South. With\r\nslave labor they could not become manufacturers, and must, therefore,\r\nremain at the mercy of the North, both as to food and clothing, unless\r\nthe European markets should be retained. Out of this conviction grew the\r\nwar upon Corporations; the hostility to the employment of foreign\r\ncapital in developing the mineral, agricultural, and manufacturing\r\nresources of the country; the efforts to destroy the banks and the\r\ncredit system; the attempts to reduce the currency to gold and silver;\r\nthe system of collecting the public revenues in coin; the withdrawal of\r\nthe public moneys from all the banks as a basis of paper circulation;\r\nand the sleepless vigilance of the South in resisting all systems of\r\ninternal improvements by the General Government. Its statesmen foresaw\r\nthat a paper currency would keep up the price of Northern products one\r\nor two hundred per cent. above the specie standard; that combinations of\r\ncapitalists, whether engaged in manufacturing wool, cotton, or iron,\r\nwould draw off labor from the cultivation of the soil, and cause large\r\nbodies of the producers to become consumers; and that roads and canals,\r\nconnecting the West with the East, were effectual means of bringing the\r\nagricultural and manufacturing classes into closer proximity, to the\r\nserious limitation of the foreign commerce of the country, the checking\r\nof the growth of the navy, and the manifest, injury of the planters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n          Character of the Tariff controversy--Peculiar\r\n          condition of the people--Efforts to enlist the\r\n          West in the interest of the South--Mr.\r\n          McDuffie--Mr. Hamilton--Mr. Rankin--Mr.\r\n          Garnett--Mr. Cuthbert--the West still shut out\r\n          from market--Mr. Wickliffe--Mr. Benton--Tariff of\r\n          1828 obnoxious to the South--Georgia\r\n          Resolutions--Mr. Hamilton--Argument to Sugar\r\n          Planters.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Protective Tariff and Free Trade controversy, at its origin, and\r\nduring its progress, was very different in its character from what many\r\nnow imagine it to have been. People, on both sides, were often in great\r\nstraits to know how to obtain a livelihood, much less to amass\r\nfortunes. The word _ruin_ was no unmeaning phrase at that day. The news,\r\nnow, that a bank has failed, carries with it, to the depositors and\r\nholders of its notes, no stronger feelings of consternation, than did\r\nthe report of the passage or repeal of tariff laws, then, affect the\r\nminds of the opposing parties. We have spoken of the peculiar condition\r\nof the South in this respect. In the West, for many years, the farmers\r\noften received no more than _twenty-five cents_, and rarely over _forty\r\ncents_, per bushel for their wheat, after conveying it, on horseback, or\r\nin wagons, not unfrequently, a distance of fifty miles, to find a\r\nmarket. Other products were proportionally low in price; and such was\r\nthe difficulty in obtaining money, that people could not pay their taxes\r\nbut with the greatest sacrifices. So deeply were the people interested\r\nin these questions of national policy, that they became the basis of\r\npolitical action during several Presidential elections. This led to much\r\nvacillation in legislation on the subject, and gave alternately, to one\r\nand then to the other section of the Union, the benefits of its favorite\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe vote of the West, during this struggle, was of the first importance,\r\nas it possessed the balance of power, and could turn the scale at will.\r\nIt was not left without inducements to co-operate with the South, in its\r\nmeasures for extending slavery, that it might create a market among the\r\nplanters for its products. This appears from the particular efforts made\r\nby the Southern members of Congress, during the debate of 1824, to win\r\nover the West to the doctrines of free trade.\r\n\r\nMr. McDuffie, of South Carolina, said: \"I admit that the Western people\r\nare _embarrassed_, but I deny that they are _distressed_, in any other\r\nsense of the word. . . . . I am well assured that the permanent prosperity\r\nof the West depends more upon the improvement of the means of\r\ntransporting their produce to market, and of receiving the returns, than\r\nupon every other subject to which the legislation of this government can\r\nbe directed. . . . . Gentlemen (from the West) are aware that a very\r\nprofitable trade is carried on by their constituents with the Southern\r\ncountry, in _live stock_ of all descriptions, which they drive over the\r\nmountains and sell for cash. This extensive trade, which, from its\r\npeculiar character, more easily overcomes the difficulties of\r\ntransportation than any that can be substituted in its place, is about\r\nto be put in jeopardy for the conjectural benefits of this measure. When\r\nI say this trade is about to be put in jeopardy, I do not speak\r\nunadvisedly. I am perfectly convinced that, if this bill passes, it will\r\nhave the effect of inducing the people of the South, partly from the\r\nfeeling and partly from the necessity growing out of it, to raise within\r\nthemselves, the live stock which they now purchase from the West. . . . .\r\nIf we cease to take the manufactures of Great Britain, she will assuredly\r\ncease to take our cotton to the same extent. It is a settled principle\r\nof her policy--a principle not only wise, but essential to her\r\nexistence--to purchase from those nations that receive her manufactures,\r\nin preference to those who do not. We have, heretofore, been her best\r\ncustomers, and, therefore, it has been her policy to purchase our cotton\r\nto the full extent of our demand for her manufactures. But, say\r\ngentlemen, Great Britain does not purchase your cotton from affection,\r\nbut from interest. I grant it, sir; and that is the very reason of my\r\ndecided hostility to a system which will make it her interest to\r\npurchase from other countries in preference to our own. It _is_ her\r\ninterest to purchase cotton, even at a higher price, from those\r\ncountries which receive her manufactures in exchange. It is better for\r\nher to give a little more for cotton, than to obtain nothing for her\r\nmanufactures. It will be remarked that the situation of Great Britain\r\nis, in this respect, widely different from that of the United States.\r\nThe powers of her soil have been already pushed very nearly to the\r\nmaximum of their productiveness. The productiveness of her manufactures\r\non the contrary, is as unlimited as the demand of the whole world. . . . .\r\nIn fact, sir, the policy of Great Britain is not, as gentlemen seem to\r\nsuppose, to secure the _home_, but the _foreign_ market for her\r\nmanufactures. The former she has without an effort. It is to attain the\r\nlatter that all her policy and enterprise are brought into requisition.\r\nThe manufactures of that country are _the basis of her commerce_; our\r\nmanufactures, on the contrary are to be _the destruction of our\r\ncommerce_. . . . . It can not be doubted that, in pursuance of the\r\npolicy of forcing her manufactures into foreign markets, she will, if\r\ndeprived of a large portion of our custom, direct all her efforts to\r\nSouth America. That country abounds in a soil admirably adapted to the\r\nproduction of cotton, and will, for a century to come, import her\r\nmanufactures from foreign countries.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, of South Carolina, said: \"That the planters in his section\r\nshared in that depression which is common in every department of the\r\nindustry of the Union, _excepting those from which we have heard the\r\nmost clamor for relief_. This would be understood when it was known that\r\nsea-island cotton had fallen from 50 or 60 cents, to 25 cents--a fall\r\neven greater than that which has attended wheat, of which we had heard\r\nso much--as if the grain-growing section was the only agricultural\r\ninterest which had suffered. . . . . While the planters of this region do\r\nnot dread competition in the foreign markets on equal terms, from the\r\nsuperiority of their cotton, they entertain a well-founded apprehension,\r\nthat the restrictions contemplated will lead to retaliatory duties on\r\nthe part of Great Britain, which must end in ruin. . . . . In relation to\r\nour upland cottons, Great Britain may, without difficulty, in the course\r\nof a very short period, supply her wants from Brazil. . . . . How long the\r\nexclusive production, even of the sea-island cotton, will remain to our\r\ncountry, is yet a doubtful and interesting problem. The experiments that\r\nare making on the Delta of the Nile, if pushed to the Ocean, may result\r\nin the production of this beautiful staple, in an abundance which, in\r\nreference to other productions, has long blest and consecrated Egyptian\r\nfertility. . . . . We are told by the honorable Speaker (Mr. Clay,) that\r\nour manufacturing establishments will, in a very short period, supply\r\nthe place of the foreign demand. The futility, I will not say mockery of\r\nthis hope, may be measured by one or two facts. First, the present\r\nconsumption of cotton, by our manufactories, is about equal to one-sixth\r\nof our whole production. . . . . How long it will take to increase these\r\nmanufactories to a scale equal to the consumption of this production, he\r\ncould not venture to determine; but that it will be some years after the\r\nepitaph will have been written on the fortunes of the South, there can\r\nbe but little doubt.\" . . . . [After speaking of the tendency of\r\nincreased manufactures in the East, to check emigration to the West, and\r\nthus to diminish the value of the public lands and prevent the growth of\r\nthe Western States, Mr. H. proceeded thus:] \"That portion of the Union\r\ncould participate in no part of the bill, except in its burdens, in\r\nspite of the fallacious hopes that were cherished, in reference to\r\ncotton bagging for Kentucky, and the woolen duty for Steubenville, Ohio.\r\nHe feared that to the entire region of the West, no 'cordial drops of\r\ncomfort' would come, even in the duty on foreign spirits. To a large\r\nportion of our people, who are in the habit of solacing themselves with\r\nHollands, Antigua, and Cogniac, whisky would still have 'a most\r\nvillainous twang.' The cup, he feared, would be refused, though tendered\r\nby the hand of patriotism as well as conviviality. No, the West has but\r\none interest, and that is, that its best customer, the South, should be\r\nprosperous.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin, of Mississippi, said: \"With the West, it appears to me like\r\na rebellion of the members against the body. It is true, we export, but\r\nthe amount received from those exports is only apparently, largely in\r\nour favor, inasmuch as we are the consumers of your produce, dependent\r\non you for our implements of husbandry, the means of sustaining life,\r\nand almost every thing except our lands and negroes; all of which draws\r\nmuch from the apparent profits and advantages. In proportion as you\r\ndiminish our exportations, you diminish our means of purchasing from\r\nyou, and destroy your own market. You will compel us to use those\r\nadvantages of soil and of climate which God and Nature have placed\r\nwithin our reach, and to live, as to you, as you desire us to live as to\r\nforeign nations--dependent on our own resources.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garnett, of Virginia, said: \"The Western States can not manufacture.\r\nThe want of capital (of which they, as well as the Southern States, have\r\nbeen drained by the policy of government,) and other causes render it\r\nimpossible. The Southern States are destined to suffer more by this\r\npolicy than any other--the Western next; but it will not benefit the\r\naggregate population of any State. It is for the benefit of capitalists\r\nonly. If persisted in, it will drive the South to ruin and resistance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cuthbert, of Georgia, said: \"He hoped the market for the cotton of\r\nthe South was not about to be contracted within a little miserable\r\nsphere, (the home market,) instead of being spread throughout the world.\r\nIf they should drive the cotton-growers from the only source from whence\r\ntheir means were derived, (the foreign market,) they would be unable any\r\nlonger to take their supplies from the West--they must contract their\r\nconcerns within their own spheres, and begin to raise flesh and grain\r\nfor their own consumption. The South was already under a severe\r\npressure--if this measure went into effect, its distress would be\r\nconsummated.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1828, the West found still very limited means of communication with\r\nthe East. The opening of the New York canal, in 1825, created a means of\r\ntraffic with the seaboard, to the people of the Lake region; but all of\r\nthe remaining territory, west of the Alleghanies, had gained no\r\nadvantages over those it had enjoyed in 1824, except so far as steamboat\r\nnavigation had progressed on the Western rivers. In the debate preceding\r\nthe passage of the tariff in 1828, usually termed the \"Woolens' Bill,\"\r\nallusion is made to the condition of the West, from which we quote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nMr. Wickliffe, of Kentucky, said: \"My constituents may be said to be a\r\ngrain-growing people. They raise stock, and their surplus grain is\r\nconverted into spirits. Where, I ask, is our market? . . . . Our market\r\nis where our sympathies should be, in the South. Our course of trade,\r\nfor all heavy articles, is down the Mississippi. What breadstuffs we\r\nfind a market for, are principally consumed in the States of\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, South Alabama, and Florida. Indeed, I may say,\r\nthese States are the consumers, at miserable and ruinous prices to the\r\nfarmers of my State, of our exports of spirits, corn, flour, and cured\r\nprovisions. . . . . We have had a trade of some value to the South in\r\nour stock. We still continue it under great disadvantages. It is a\r\nready-money trade--I may say it is the only money trade in which we are\r\nengaged. . . . . Are the gentlemen acquainted with the extent of that\r\ntrade? It may be fairly stated at three millions per annum.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Benton urged the Western members to unite with the South, \"for the\r\npurpose of enlarging the market, increasing the demand in the South, and\r\nits ability to purchase the horses, mules, and provisions, which the\r\nWest could sell nowhere else.\"\r\n\r\nThe tariff of 1828, created great dissatisfaction at the South. Examples\r\nof the expressions of public sentiment, on the subject, adopted at\r\nconventions, and on other occasions, might be multiplied indefinitely.\r\nTake a case or two, to illustrate the whole. At a public meeting in\r\nGeorgia, held subsequently to the passage of the \"Woolens' Bill,\" the\r\nfollowing resolution was adopted:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That to retaliate as far as possible\r\n          upon our oppressors, our Legislature be requested\r\n          to impose taxes, amounting to prohibition, on the\r\n          hogs, horses, mules, and cotton-bagging, whisky,\r\n          pork, beef, bacon, flax, and hemp cloth, of the\r\n          Western, and on all the productions and\r\n          manufactures of the Eastern and Northern States.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, of South Carolina, in a speech at the Waterborough\r\nDinner, given subsequently to the passage of the tariff of 1828, said:\r\n\r\n\"It becomes us to inquire what is to be our situation under this\r\nunexpected and disastrous conjunction of circumstances, which, in its\r\nprogress, will deprive us of the benefits of a free trade with the rest\r\nof the world, which formed one of the leading objects of the Union. Why,\r\ngentlemen, ruin, unmitigated ruin, must be our portion, if this system\r\ncontinues. . . . . From 1816 down to the present time, the South has\r\nbeen drugged, by the slow poison of the miserable empiricism of the\r\nprohibitory system, the fatal effects of which we could not so long have\r\nresisted, but for the stupendously valuable staples with which God has\r\nblessed us, and the agricultural skill and enterprise of our people.\"\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of the nature of this controversy, and of the\r\narguments used during the contest, we must give the substance of the\r\nremarks of a prominent politician, who was aiming at detaching the sugar\r\nplanters from their political connection with the manufacturers. We have\r\nto rely on memory, however, as we can not find the record of the\r\nlanguage used on the occasion. It was published at the time, and\r\ncommented on, freely, by the newspapers at the North. He said: \"We must\r\nprevent the increase of manufactories, force the surplus labor into\r\nagriculture, promote the cultivation of our unimproved western lands,\r\nuntil provisions are so multiplied and reduced in price, that the slave\r\ncan be fed so cheaply as to enable us to grow our sugar at _three cents\r\na pound_. Then, without protective duties, we can rival Cuba in the\r\nproduction of that staple, and drive her from our markets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTariff controversy continued--Tariff of 1832--The crisis--_Secession_\r\nthreatened--Compromise finally adopted--Debates--Mr. Hayne--Mr.\r\nMcDuffie--Mr. Clay--Adjustment of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE opening of the year 1832, found the parties to the Tariff\r\ncontroversy once more engaged in earnest debate, on the floor of\r\nCongress; and midsummer witnessed the passage of a new Bill, including\r\nthe principle of protection. This Act produced a crisis in the\r\ncontroversy, and led to the movements in South Carolina toward\r\nsecession; and, to avert the threatened evil, the Bill was modified, in\r\nthe following year, so as to make it acceptable to the South; and, so\r\nas, also, to settle the policy of the Government for the succeeding nine\r\nyears. A few extracts from the debates of 1832, will serve to show what\r\nwere the sentiments of the members of Congress, as to the effects of the\r\nprotective policy on the different sections of the Union, up to that\r\ndate:\r\n\r\nMr. Hayne, of South Carolina, said: \"When the policy of '24 went into\r\noperation, the South was supplied from the West, through a single\r\navenue, (the Saluda Mountain Gap,) with live stock, horses, cattle, and\r\nhogs, to the amount of considerably upward of a million of dollars a\r\nyear. Under the pressure of the system, this trade has been regularly\r\ndiminishing. It has already fallen more than one-half. . . . . In\r\nconsequence of the dire calamities which the system has inflicted on the\r\nSouth--blasting our commerce, and withering our prosperity--the West has\r\nbeen very nearly deprived of her best customer. . . . . And what was\r\nfound to be the result of four years' experience at the South? Not a\r\nhope fulfilled; not one promise performed; and our condition infinitely\r\nworse than it had been four years before. Sir, the whole South rose up\r\nas one man, and protested against any further experiment with this\r\nsystem. . . . . Sir, I seize the opportunity to dispel forever the\r\ndelusion that the South can find any compensation, in a home market, for\r\nthe injurious operation of the protective system. . . . . What a\r\nspectacle do you even now exhibit to the world? A large portion of your\r\nfellow-citizens, believing themselves to be grievously oppressed by an\r\nunwise and unconstitutional system, are clamoring at your doors for\r\njustice: while another portion, supposing that they are enjoying rich\r\nbounties under it, are treating their complaints with scorn and\r\ncontempt. . . . . This system may destroy the South, but it will not\r\npermanently advance the prosperity of the North. It may depress us, but\r\ncan not elevate them. Beside, sir, if persevered in, it must annihilate\r\nthat portion of the country from which the resources are to be drawn.\r\nAnd it may be well for gentlemen to reflect whether adhering to this\r\npolicy would not be acting like the man who 'killed the goose which laid\r\nthe golden eggs.' Next to the Christian religion, I consider _Free\r\nTrade_, in its largest sense, as the greatest blessing that can be\r\nconferred on any people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McDuffie, of South Carolina, said: \"At the close of the late war\r\nwith Great Britain, every thing in the political and commercial changes,\r\nresulting from the general peace, indicated unparalleled prosperity to\r\nthe Southern States, and great embarrassment and distress to those of\r\nthe North. The nations of the Continent had all directed their efforts\r\nto the business of manufacturing; and all Europe may be said to have\r\nconverted their swords into machinery, creating unprecedented demand for\r\ncotton, the great staple of the Southern States. There is nothing in the\r\nhistory of commerce that can be compared with the increased demand for\r\nthis staple, notwithstanding the restrictions by which this Government\r\nhas limited that demand. As cotton, tobacco, and rice, are produced only\r\non a small portion of the globe, while all other agricultural staples\r\nare common to every region of the earth, this circumstance gave the\r\nplanting States very great advantages. To cap the climax of the\r\ncommercial advantages opened to the cotton planters, England, their\r\ngreat and most valued customer, received their cotton under a mere\r\nnominal duty. On the other hand, the prospects of the Northern States\r\nwere as dismal as those of the Southern States were brilliant. They had\r\nlost the carrying trade of the world, which the wars of Europe had\r\nthrown into their hands. They had lost the demand and the high prices\r\nwhich our own war had created for their grain and other productions;\r\nand, soon afterward, they also lost the foreign market for their grain,\r\nowing, partly, to foreign corn laws, but still more to other causes.\r\nSuch were the prospects, and such the well-founded hope of the Southern\r\nStates at the close of the late war, in which they bore so glorious a\r\npart in vindicating the freedom of trade. But where are now these\r\ncheering prospects and animating hopes? Blasted, sir--utterly\r\nblasted--by the consuming and withering course of a system of\r\nlegislation which wages an exterminating war against the blessings of\r\ncommerce and the bounties of a merciful Providence; and which, by an\r\nimpious perversion of language, is called 'Protection.' . . . . I will\r\nnot add, sir, my deep and deliberate conviction, in the face of all the\r\nmiserable cant and hypocrisy with which the world abounds on the\r\nsubject, that any course of measures which shall hasten the abolition of\r\nslavery, by destroying the value of slave labor, will bring upon the\r\nSouthern States the greatest political calamity with which they can be\r\nafflicted; for I sincerely believe, that when the people of those States\r\nshall be compelled, by such means, to emancipate their slaves, they will\r\nbe but a few degrees above the condition of slaves themselves. Yes, sir,\r\nmark what I say: when the people of the South cease to be masters, by\r\nthe tampering influence of this Government, direct or indirect, they\r\nwill assuredly be slaves. It is the clear and distinct perception of the\r\nirresistible tendency of this protective system to precipitate us upon\r\nthis great moral and political catastrophe, that has animated me to\r\nraise my warning voice, that my fellow-citizens may foresee, and\r\nforeseeing, avoid the destiny that would otherwise befall them. . . . .\r\nAnd here, sir, it is as curious as it is melancholy and distressing, to\r\nsee how striking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which\r\nthe manufacturing States have reduced the planting States, and that\r\nwhich formerly bound the Anglo-American colonies to the British\r\nEmpire. . . . England said to her American colonies 'You shall not trade\r\nwith the rest of the world for such manufactures _as are produced in the\r\nmother country_.' The manufacturing States say to their Southern\r\ncolonies, 'You shall not trade with the rest of the world for such\r\nmanufactures as _we produce_, under a penalty of forty per cent. upon\r\nthe value of every cargo detected in this illicit commerce; which\r\npenalty, aforesaid, shall be levied, collected, and paid out of the\r\nproducts of your industry, to nourish and sustain ours.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay, in referring to the condition of the country at large, said:\r\n\"I have now to perform the more pleasing task of exhibiting an imperfect\r\nsketch of the existing state of the unparalleled prosperity of the\r\ncountry. On a general survey, we behold cultivation extended; the arts\r\nflourishing; the face of the country improved; our people fully and\r\nprofitably employed, and the public countenance exhibiting tranquillity,\r\ncontentment, and happiness. And, if we descend into particulars, we have\r\nthe agreeable contemplation of a people out of debt; land rising slowly\r\nin value, but in a secure and salutary degree; a ready, though not an\r\nextravagant market for all the surplus productions of our industry;\r\ninnumerable flocks and herds browsing and gamboling on ten thousand\r\nhills and plains, covered with rich and verdant grasses; our cities\r\nexpanded, and whole villages springing up, as it were, by enchantment;\r\nour exports and imports increased and increasing; our tonnage, foreign\r\nand coastwise, swelled and fully occupied; the rivers of our interior\r\nanimated by the perpetual thunder and lightning of countless steamboats;\r\nthe currency sound and abundant; the public debt of two wars nearly\r\nredeemed; and, to crown all, the public treasury overflowing,\r\nembarrassing Congress, not to find subjects of taxation, but to select\r\nthe objects which shall be liberated from the impost. If the term of\r\nseven years were to be selected, of the greatest prosperity which this\r\npeople have enjoyed since the establishment of their present\r\nConstitution, it would be exactly that period of seven years which\r\nimmediately followed the passage of the tariff of 1824.\r\n\r\n\"This transformation of the condition of the country from gloom and\r\ndistress to brightness and prosperity, has been mainly the work of\r\nAmerican legislation, fostering American industry, instead of allowing\r\nit to be controlled by foreign legislation, cherishing foreign industry.\r\nThe foes of the American system, in 1824, with great boldness and\r\nconfidence, predicted, first, the ruin of the public revenue, and the\r\ncreation of a necessity to resort to direct taxation. The gentleman from\r\nSouth Carolina, (General Hayne,) I believe, thought that the tariff of\r\n1824 would operate a reduction of revenue to the large amount of eight\r\nmillions of dollars; secondly, the destruction of our navigation;\r\nthirdly, the desolation of commercial cities; and, fourthly, the\r\naugmentation of the price of articles of consumption, and further\r\ndecline in that of the articles of our exports. Every prediction which\r\nthey made has failed--utterly failed. . . . . It is now proposed to\r\nabolish the system to which we owe so much of the public prosperity\r\n. . . . . Why, sir, there is scarcely an interest--scarcely a vocation\r\nin society--which is not embraced by the beneficence of this system. . .\r\n. . The error of the opposite argument, is in assuming one thing, which,\r\nbeing denied, the whole fails; that is, it assumes that the _whole_\r\nlabor of the United States would be profitably employed without\r\nmanufactures. Now, the truth is, that the system _excites_ and _creates_\r\nlabor, and this labor creates wealth, and this new wealth communicates\r\nadditional ability to consume; which acts on all the objects\r\ncontributing to human comfort and enjoyment. . . . . I could extend and\r\ndwell on the long list of articles--the hemp, iron, lead, coal, and\r\nother items--for which a demand is created in the home market by the\r\noperation of the American system; but I should exhaust the patience of\r\nthe Senate. _Where, where_ should we find a market for all these\r\narticles, if it did not exist at home? What would be the condition of\r\nthe largest portion of our people, and of the territory, if this home\r\nmarket were annihilated? How could they be supplied with objects of\r\nprime necessity? What would not be the certain and inevitable decline in\r\nthe price of all these articles, but for the home market?\"\r\n\r\nBut we must not burden our pages with further extracts. What has been\r\nquoted affords the principal arguments of the opposing parties, on the\r\npoints in which we are interested, down to 1832. The adjustment, in\r\n1833, of the subject until 1842, and its subsequent agitation, are too\r\nfamiliar, or of too easy access to the general reader, to require a\r\nnotice from us here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n          Results of the contest on Protection and Free\r\n          Trade--More or less favorable to all--Increased\r\n          consumption of Cotton at home--Capital invested in\r\n          Cotton and Woolen factories--Markets thus afforded\r\n          to the Farmer--South successful in securing the\r\n          monopoly of the Cotton markets--Failure of Cotton\r\n          cultivation in other countries--Diminished prices\r\n          destroyed Household Manufacturing--Increasing\r\n          demand for Cotton--Strange Providences--First\r\n          efforts to extend Slavery--Indian lands\r\n          acquired--No danger of over-production--Abolition\r\n          movements served to unite the South--Annexation of\r\n          territory thought essential to its\r\n          security--Increase of Provisions necessary to its\r\n          success--Temperance cause favorable to this\r\n          result--The West ready to supply the Planters--It\r\n          is greatly stimulated to effort by Southern\r\n          markets--_Tripartite Alliance_ of Western Farmers,\r\n          Southern Planters, and English Manufacturers--The\r\n          East competing--The West has a choice of\r\n          markets--Slavery extension necessary to Western\r\n          progress--Increased price of Provisions--More\r\n          grain growing needed--Nebraska and Kansas needed\r\n          to raise food--The Planters stimulated by\r\n          increasing demand for Cotton--Aspect of the\r\n          Provision question--California gold changed the\r\n          expected results of legislation--Reciprocity\r\n          Treaty favorable to Planters--Extended cultivation\r\n          of Provisions in the Far West essential to\r\n          Planters--Present aspect of the Cotton question\r\n          favorable to Planters--London Economist's\r\n          statistics and remarks--Our Planters must extend\r\n          the culture of Cotton to prevent its increased\r\n          growth elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE results of the contest, in relation to Protection and Free Trade,\r\nhave been more or less favorable to all parties. This has been an\r\neffect, in part, of the changeable character of our legislation; and, in\r\npart, of the occurrence of events in Europe, over which our legislators\r\nhad no control. The manufaturing States, while protection lasted,\r\nsucceeded in placing their establishments upon a comparatively permanent\r\nbasis; and, by engaging largely in the manufacture of cottons, as well\r\nas woolens, have rendered home manufactures, practically, very\r\nadvantageous to the South. Our cotton factories, in 1850, consumed as\r\nmuch cotton as those of Great Britain did in 1831; thus affording\r\nindications, that, by proper encouragement, they might, possibly, be\r\nmultiplied so as to consume the whole crop of the country. The cotton\r\nand woolen factories, in 1850, employed over 130,000 work hands, and had\r\n$102,619,581 of capital invested in them. They thus afford an important\r\nmarket to the farmer, and, at the same time, have become an equally\r\nimportant auxiliary to the planter. They may yet afford him the only\r\nmarket for his cotton.\r\n\r\nThe cotton planting States, toward the close of the contest, found\r\nthemselves rapidly accumulating strength, and approximating the\r\naccomplishment of the grand object at which they aimed--the monopoly of\r\nthe cotton markets of the world. This success was due, not so much to\r\nany triumph over the North--to any prostration of our manufacturing\r\ninterests--as to the general policy of other nations. All rivalry to the\r\nAmerican planters from those of the West Indies, was removed by\r\nemancipation; as, under freedom, the cultivation of cotton was nearly\r\nabandoned. Mehemet Ali had become imbecile, and the indolent Egyptians\r\nneglected its culture. The South Americans, after achieving their\r\nindependence, were more readily enlisted in military forays, than in the\r\nart of agriculture, and they produced little cotton for export. The\r\nemancipation of their slaves, instead of increasing the agricultural\r\nproducts of the Republics, only supplied, in ample abundance, the\r\nelements of promoting political revolutions, and keeping their soil\r\ndrenched with human blood. Such are the uses to which degraded men may\r\nbe applied by the ambitious demagogue. Brazil and India both supplied to\r\nEurope considerably less in 1838 than they had done in 1820; and the\r\nlatter country made no material increase afterward, except when her\r\nchief customer, China, was at war, or prices were above the average\r\nrates in Europe. While the cultivation of cotton was thus stationary or\r\nretrograding, everywhere outside of the United States, England and the\r\nContinent were rapidly increasing their consumption of the article,\r\nwhich they nearly doubled from 1835 to 1845; so that the demand for the\r\nraw material called loudly for its increased production. Our planters\r\ngathered a rich harvest of profits by these events.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all that is worthy of note, in this strange chapter of\r\nProvidences. No prominent event occurred, but conspired to advance the\r\nprosperity of the cotton trade, and the value of American slavery. Even\r\nthe very depression suffered by the manufacturers and cultivators of\r\ncotton, from 1825 to 1829, served to place the manufacturing interests\r\nupon the broad and firm basis they now occupy. It forced the planters\r\ninto the production of their cotton at lower rates; and led the\r\nmanufacturers to improve their machinery, and reduce the price of their\r\nfabrics low enough to sweep away all household manufacturing, and\r\nsecure to themselves the monopoly of clothing the civilized world. This\r\nwas the object at which the British manufacturers had aimed, and in\r\nwhich they had been eminently successful. The growing manufactures of\r\nthe United States, and of the Continent of Europe, had not yet sensibly\r\naffected their operations.\r\n\r\nThere is still another point requiring a passing notice, as it may serve\r\nto explain some portions of the history of slavery, not so well\r\nunderstood. It was not until events diminishing the foreign growth of\r\ncotton, and enlarging the demand for its fabrics, had been extensively\r\ndeveloped, that the older cotton-growing States became willing to allow\r\nslavery extension in the Southwest; and, even then, their assent was\r\nreluctantly given--the markets for cotton, doubtless, being considered\r\nsufficiently limited for the territory under cultivation. Up to 1824,\r\nthe Indians held over thirty-two millions of acres of land in Georgia,\r\nMississippi, and Alabama, and over twenty millions of acres in Florida,\r\nMissouri and Arkansas; which was mostly retained by them as late as\r\n1836. Although the States interested had repeatedly urged the matter\r\nupon Congress, and some of them even resorted to forcible means to gain\r\npossession of these Indian lands, the Government did not fulfill its\r\npromise to remove the Indians until 1836; and even then, the measure met\r\nwith such opposition, that it was saved but by one vote--Mr. Calhoun and\r\nsix other Southern Senators voting against it.[32] In justice to Mr.\r\nCalhoun, however, it must be stated that his opposition to the measure\r\nwas based on the conviction that the treaty had been fraudulently\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe older States, however, had found, by this time, that the foreign and\r\nhome demand for cotton was so rapidly increasing that there was little\r\ndanger of over-production; and that they had, in fact, secured to\r\nthemselves the monopoly of the foreign markets. Beside this, the\r\nabolition movement at that moment, had assumed its most threatening\r\naspect, and was demanding the destruction of slavery or the dissolution\r\nof the Union. Here was a double motive operating to produce harmony in\r\nthe ranks of Southern politicians, and to awaken the fears of many,\r\nNorth and South, for the safety of the Government. Here, also, was the\r\norigin of the determination, in the South, to extend slavery, by the\r\nannexation of territory, so as to gain the political preponderance in\r\nthe National Councils, and to protect its interests against the\r\ninterference of the North.\r\n\r\nIt was not the increased demand for cotton, alone, that served as a\r\nprotection to the older States. The extension of its cultivation, in the\r\ndegree demanded by the wants of commerce, could only be effected by a\r\ncorresponding increased supply of provisions. Without this, it could not\r\nincrease, except by enhancing their price to the injury of the older\r\nStates. This food did not fail to be in readiness, so soon as it was\r\nneeded. Indeed, much of it had long been awaiting an outlet to a\r\nprofitable market. Its surplus, too, had been somewhat increased by the\r\nTemperance movement in the North, which had materially checked the\r\ndistillation of grain.\r\n\r\nThe West, which had long looked to the East for a market, had its\r\nattention now turned to the South, as the most certain and convenient\r\nmart for the sale of its products--the planters affording to the farmers\r\nthe markets they had in vain sought from the manufacturers. In the\r\nmeantime, steamboat navigation was acquiring perfection on the Western\r\nrivers--the great natural outlets for Western products--and became a\r\nmeans of communication between the Northwest and the Southwest, as well\r\nas with the trade and commerce of the Atlantic cities. This gave an\r\nimpulse to industry and enterprise, west of the Alleghanies,\r\nunparalleled in the history of the country. While, then, the bounds of\r\nslave labor were extending from Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia,\r\nWestward, over Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas, the area of\r\nfree labor was enlarging, with equal rapidity, in the Northwest,\r\nthroughout Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. Thus, within these\r\nprovision and cotton regions, were the forests cleared away, or the\r\nprairies broken up, simultaneously by those old antagonistic forces,\r\nopponents no longer, but harmonized by the fusion of their\r\ninterests--the connecting link between them being the steamboat. Thus,\r\nalso, was a _tripartite alliance_ formed, by which the Western Farmer,\r\nthe Southern Planter, and the English Manufacturer, became united in a\r\ncommon bond of interest: the whole giving their support to the doctrine\r\nof Free Trade.\r\n\r\nThis active commerce between the West and South, however, soon caused a\r\nrivalry in the East, that pushed forward improvements, by States or\r\nCorporations, to gain a share in the Western trade. These improvements,\r\nas completed, gave to the West a choice of markets, so that its Farmers\r\ncould elect whether to feed the slave who grows the cotton, or the\r\noperatives who are engaged in its manufacture. But this rivalry did\r\nmore. The competition for Western products enhanced their price, and\r\nstimulated their more extended cultivation. This required an enlargement\r\nof the markets; and the extension of slavery became essential to Western\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nWe have not reached the end of the alliance between the Western Farmer\r\nand Southern Planter. The emigration which has been filling Iowa and\r\nMinnesota, and is now rolling like a flood into Kansas and Nebraska, is\r\nbut a repetition of what has occurred in the other Western States and\r\nTerritories. Agricultural pursuits are highly remunerative, and tens of\r\nthousands of men of moderate means, or of no means, are cheered along to\r\nwhere none forbids them land to till. For the last few years, public\r\nimprovements have called for vastly more than the usual share of labor,\r\nand augmented the consumption of provisions. The foreign demand added to\r\nthis, has increased their price beyond what the planter can afford to\r\npay. For many years free labor and slave labor maintained an even race\r\nin their Western progress. Of late the freemen have begun to lag behind,\r\nwhile slavery has advanced by several degrees of longitude. Free labor\r\nmust be made to keep pace with it. There is an urgent necessity for\r\nthis. The demand for cotton is increasing in a ratio greater than can be\r\nsupplied by the American planters, unless by a corresponding increased\r\nproduction. This increasing demand must be met, or its cultivation will\r\nbe facilitated elsewhere, and the monopoly of the planter in the\r\nEuropean markets be interrupted. This can only be effected by\r\nconcentrating the greatest possible number of slaves upon the cotton\r\nplantations. Hence they must be supplied with provisions.\r\n\r\nThis is the present aspect of the Provision question, as it regards\r\nslavery extension. Prices are approximating the maximum point, beyond\r\nwhich our provisions can not be fed to slaves, unless there is a\r\ncorresponding increase in the price of cotton. Such a result was not\r\nanticipated by Southern statesmen, when they had succeeded in\r\noverthrowing the protective policy, destroying the United States Bank,\r\nand establishing the Sub-Treasury system. And why has this occurred? The\r\nmines of California prevented both the Free-Trade Tariff,[33] and the\r\nSub-Treasury scheme from exhausting the country of the precious metals,\r\nextinguishing the circulation of Bank Notes, and reducing the prices of\r\nagricultural products to the specie value. At the date of the passage of\r\nthe Nebraska Bill, the multiplication of provisions, by their more\r\nextended cultivation, was the only measure left that could produce a\r\nreduction of prices, and meet the wants of the planters. The Canadian\r\nReciprocity Treaty, since secured, will bring the products of the\r\nBritish North American colonies, free of duty, into competition with\r\nthose of the United States, when prices, with us, rule high, and tend to\r\ndiminish their cost; but in the event of scarcity in Europe, or of\r\nforeign wars, the opposite results may occur, as our products, in such\r\ntimes, will pass, free of duty, through these colonies, into the foreign\r\nmarket. It is apparent, then, that nothing short of extended free labor\r\ncultivation, far distant from the seaboard, where the products will bear\r\ntransportation to none but Southern markets, can fully secure the cotton\r\ninterests from the contingencies that so often threaten them with\r\nruinous embarrassments. In fact, such a depression of our cotton\r\ninterests has only been averted by the advanced prices which cotton has\r\ncommanded, for the last few years, in consequence of the increased\r\nEuropean demand, and its diminished cultivation abroad.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, the _London Economist_, of June 9, 1855, in remarking\r\non the aspects of the cotton question, at that moment says:\r\n\r\n\"Another somewhat remarkable circumstance, considering we are at war,\r\nand considering the predictions of some persons, is the present high\r\nprice and consumption of cotton. The crop in the United States is short,\r\nbeing only 1,120,000,000 or 1,160,000,000 lbs., but not so short as to\r\nhave a very great effect on the markets had consumption not increased.\r\nOur mercantile readers will be well aware of this fact, but let us state\r\nhere that the total consumption between January 1st and the last week in\r\nMay was:\r\n\r\n                      =CONSUMPTION OF COTTON.=\r\n                             =1853.=       =1854.=      =1855.=\r\n\r\n  Pounds,                 331,708,000   295,716,000   415,648,000\r\n  Less than 1855,          83,940,000   119,932,000\r\n  Average consumption of\r\n     lbs. per week,        15,600,000    14,000,000    19,600,000\r\n\r\n\"Though the crop in the United States is short up to this time, Great\r\nBritain has received 12,400,000 lbs. more of the crop of 1854 than she\r\nreceived to the same period of the crop of 1853. Thus, in spite of the\r\nwar, and in spite of a short crop of cotton, in spite of dear corn and\r\nfailing trade to Australia and the United States, the consumption of\r\ncotton has been one-fourth in excess of the flourishing year of 1853,\r\nand more than a third in excess of 1854. These facts are worth\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"It is reasonably expected that the present high prices will bring\r\ncotton forward rapidly; but as yet this effect has not ensued. . . . .\r\nThus, it will be seen that, notwithstanding the short crop in the\r\nStates, (at present, they have sent us more in 1855 than in 1854, but\r\nnot so much as in 1853,) the supply from other sources, except Egypt,\r\nhas been smaller in 1855 than in either of the preceding years, and the\r\nsupply from Egypt, though greater than in 1854, is less than in 1853.\"\r\n[From India, the principal hope of increased supplies, the imports for\r\n1855, in the first four months of the year, were less by 47,960,000 lbs.\r\nthan in 1854, and less by 64,000,000 lbs. than in 1853.[34]] \"We may\r\ninfer, therefore, that the rise in price hitherto, has not been\r\nsufficient to bring increased supplies from India and other places; but\r\nthese will, no doubt, come when it is seen that the rise will probably\r\nbe permanent in consequence of the enlarged consumption, and the\r\ncomparative deficiency in the crop of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAfter noticing the increasing exports of raw cotton from both England\r\nand the United States to France and the other countries of the\r\nContinent, from which it is inferred that the consumption is increasing\r\nin Europe, generally, as well as in Great Britain, the _Economist_\r\nproceeds to remark:\r\n\r\n\"A rapidly increasing consumption of cotton in Europe has not been met\r\nby an equally rapidly increasing supply, and the present relative\r\ncondition of the supply to the demand seems to justify an advance of\r\nprice, unless a greatly diminished consumption can be brought about.\r\nWhat supplies may yet be obtained from India, the Brazils, Egypt, etc.,\r\nwe know not; but, judging from the imports of the three last years, they\r\nare not likely to supply the great deficiency in the stocks just\r\nnoticed. A decrease in consumption, which is recommended, can only be\r\naccomplished by the state of the market, not by the will of individual\r\nspinners; for if some lessen their consumption of the raw material while\r\nthe demand of the market is for more cloth, it will be supplied by\r\nothers, either here or abroad; and the only real solution of the\r\ndifficulty or means of lowering the price, is an increased supply. This\r\npoints to other exertions than those which have been latterly directed\r\nto the production of fibrous materials to be converted directly into\r\npaper. Exertions ought rather to be directed to the production of\r\nfibrous materials which shall be used for textile fabrics, and so much\r\nlarger supplies of rags--the cheapest and best material for making paper\r\nwill be obtained. But theoretical production, and the schemers who\r\npropose it, not guided by the market demands, are generally erroneous,\r\nand what we now require is more and cheaper material for clothing as the\r\nmeans of getting more rags to make paper.\r\n\r\n\"Another important deduction may be made from the state of the cotton\r\nmarket. It has not been affected, at least the production of cotton with\r\nthe importation into Europe has not been disturbed by the war, and yet\r\nit seems not to have kept pace with the consumption. From this we infer\r\nthat legislative restrictions on traffic, permanently affecting the\r\nhabits of the people submissive to them, and of all their customers,\r\nhave a much more pernicious effect on production and trade than national\r\noutpourings in war of indignation and anger--which, if terrible in their\r\neffects, are of short duration. These are in the order of nature, except\r\nas they are slowly corrected and improved by knowledge; while the\r\nrestrictions--the offspring of ignorance and misplaced ambition--are at\r\nall times opposed to her beneficent ordinances.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Economist_ of June 30, in its Trade Tables, sums up the imports for\r\nthe 5th month of the year 1855; from which it appears, that instead of\r\nany increase of the imports of cotton having occurred, they had fallen\r\noff to the extent of 43,772,176 lbs. below the quantity imported in the\r\ncorresponding month of 1854.\r\n\r\nThe _Economist_ of September 1, 1855, in continuing its notices of the\r\ncotton markets, and stating that there is still a falling off in its\r\nsupplies, says:\r\n\r\n\"The decline in the quantity of cotton imported is notoriously the\r\nconsequence of the smallness of last year's crops in the United States.\r\n. . . . It is remarkable that the additional supply which has made up\r\npartly for the shortness of the American crop comes from the Brazils,\r\nEgypt, and other parts. From British India the supply is relatively\r\nshorter than from the United States. It fails us more than that of the\r\nStates, and the fact is rather unfavorable to the speculations of those\r\nwho wish to make us independent of the States, and dependent chiefly on\r\nour own possessions. The high freights that have prevailed, and are\r\nlikely to prevail with a profitable trade, would obviously make it\r\nextremely dangerous for our manufacturers to increase their dependence\r\non India for a supply of cotton. In 1855, when we have a short supply\r\nfrom other quarters, India has sent us one-third less than in 1853.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Economist_ of February 23, 1856, contains the Annual Statement of\r\nImports for 1855, ending December 31, from which it appears that the\r\nsupplies of cotton from India, for the whole year, were only 145,218,976\r\nlbs., or 35,212,520 lbs. less than the imports for 1853. Of these\r\nimports 66,210,704 lbs. were re-exported; thus leaving the British\r\nmanufacturers but 79,008,272 lbs. of the free labor cotton of India,\r\nupon which to employ their looms.[35]\r\n\r\nThis increasing demand for cotton beyond the present supplies, if not\r\nmet by the cotton growers of the United States, must encourage its\r\ncultivation in countries which now send but little to market. To prevent\r\nsuch a result, and to retain in their own hands the monopoly of the\r\ncotton market, will require the utmost vigilance on the part of our\r\nplanters. That vigilance will not be wanting.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] Benton's Thirty Year's View.\r\n\r\n[33] The Tariff of 1846, under which our imports are now made,\r\napproximates the Free Trade principles very closely.\r\n\r\n[34] These figures are taken from a part of the _Economist's_ article\r\nnot copied.

An\r\nopportunity is now offered for recording the results of the movements of\r\nGreat Britain to promote cotton culture in her own possessions between\r\nthat and 1859. The results will be startling. Few anti-slavery men in\r\nthe United States expected that Great Britain would so soon be engaged\r\nzealously in establishing slave labor in Africa, or that Lord Palmerston\r\nshould publicly commend the measure. The question is one of so much\r\nimportance as to demand a full examination. The extracts are taken,\r\nmainly, from the _London Economist_, a periodical having the highest\r\nreputation for candor and fair dealing. On Feb. 12, 1859, the\r\n_Economist_ said:\r\n\r\n\"We are not surprised that the future supply of cotton should have\r\nengaged the attention of Parliament on an early night of the Session. It\r\nis a question the importance of which can not well be overrated, if we\r\nrefer only to the commercial interests which it involves, or to the\r\nsocial comfort or happiness of the millions who are now dependent upon\r\nit for their support. But it has an aspect far loftier and even more\r\nimportant. At its root lies the ultimate success of a policy for which\r\nEngland has made great struggles and great sacrifices--the maintaining\r\nof existing treaties, and perhaps the peace of the world. Every year as\r\nit passes, proves more and more that the question of slavery, and even\r\nof the slave trade, is destined to be materially affected, if not\r\nultimately governed, by considerations arising out of the cultivation of\r\nthis plant. It is impossible to observe the tendency of public opinion\r\nthroughout America, not even excepting the Free States, with relation to\r\nthe slave trade, without feeling conscious that it is drifting into\r\nindifference, and even laxity. In every light, then, in which this great\r\nsubject can be viewed, it is one which well deserves the careful\r\nattention equally of the philanthropist and the statesman.\r\n\r\n\"It has been said, that in the case of cotton we have found an exception\r\nto the great commercial principle of supply and demand. Is this so? We\r\ndoubt it. We doubt if, on the contrary, we shall not find, upon\r\ninvestigation, that it presents one of the strongest examples of the\r\nstruggle of that principle to maintain its conclusions. No doubt the\r\nconditions of its production have made that struggle a severe one; but,\r\nnevertheless, it has not been altogether unsuccessful. Eighteen years\r\nago, (in 1840) the total supply of cotton imported into this country was\r\n592,488,000 lbs.: with temporary fluctuations, it had steadily grown\r\nuntil it had reached, in the last three years, upwards of 900,000,000\r\nlbs., showing an increase of more than fifty per cent. Nevertheless, the\r\ndemand had been constantly pressing upon the supply, the consumption has\r\nalways shown a tendency to exceed the production, and the consequent\r\nresult of a high price has, during a majority of those years, acted as a\r\npowerful stimulant to cultivation. But, practically speaking, we possess\r\nbut two sources of supply, and both present such powerful obstacles to\r\nextended cultivation, that we are not surprised at the habitual\r\nuneasiness of those whose interests demand a continually increasing\r\nquantity. Those two sources are the United States and British India. It\r\nis true that Brazil, Egypt, the West Indies, and some other countries,\r\nfurnish small quantities of cotton; but when we state that of the\r\n931,847,000 lbs., imported into the United Kingdom in 1858, the\r\nproportion furnished by America and India was 870,656,000 lbs., leaving\r\nfor all other places put together, a supply of only 61,191,000 lbs.,\r\nnotwithstanding the many laudable efforts, both on the part of\r\nGovernment, and of the mercantile community, to encourage its growth in\r\nnew countries, it will be admitted that, as an _immediate_ and practical\r\nquestion, it is confined to those two sources. They are not only the\r\nsources from whence the largest supplies are received, but they are\r\nalso those where the chief increase has taken place.\r\n\r\n\"In 1840 the supply received from the United States was 487,856,000 lbs.\r\nSince that time, with some considerable fluctuations, it has steadily\r\nincreased, until in 1858 it rose to 732,403,000 lbs.--the maximum\r\nquantity having reached in 1856, 780,040,000 lbs. Yet, great as this\r\nincrease has been, it appears that it has not been equal to the\r\nincreased demand, if we may judge from the price, at the two\r\nperiods.[36] The large supplies of the last three years have commanded\r\nprices at least _sixteen per cent._ higher than the smaller supplies\r\nfrom 1840 to 1842. Every encouragement, therefore, which high and\r\nremunerative prices could give to increased cultivation has been\r\nliberally afforded to the cotton-growing States of America.\r\n\r\n\"But whatever the price, there is a condition which places an absolute\r\nlimit upon the growth. Land in every way suited for the purpose, is\r\nabundant and cheap. Means of transport is of the cheapest and best kind,\r\nand is without limit. The limit lies in the necessary ingredient of\r\nlabor. If cotton had been the produce of free labor, no doubt the\r\nprinciple of supply and demand would have solved the difficulty. The\r\nsurplus of the Old World would have steadily maintained the balance\r\nbetween the two in the New World. Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, the\r\nSouthern parts of France, and Portugal, would have sent their surplus\r\nlabor to the best market. As it is, the two kinds of labor--that of the\r\nfreeman and that of the slave--can not be united in the same\r\ncultivation. The slave States of America are, therefore, dependent for\r\nany increase of labor only upon themselves. The consuming States can\r\ndraw supplies only from the breeding States. It is, therefore, exactly\r\nin proportion as the slave population increases that the cotton crop\r\nbecomes larger. Taking the average of three or four years at any period\r\nof the history of the United States for the last forty years, it will be\r\nfound that the growth of cotton is equal to one bale for each person of\r\nthe slave population. The calculation is well known. When the slave\r\npopulation was two millions, the average produce of cotton was two\r\nmillions of bales:--as the one rose the other increased. The slave\r\npopulation is now about three millions and a half; the cotton crop of\r\nthe present year is computed at from 3,500,000 to 3,700,000 bales. The\r\nhigh price of cotton, and the great profit attached to its cultivation,\r\nhave no doubt furnished the greatest stimulant to an increase of that\r\npart of the population. In the competition for more labor, the price of\r\nslaves was enormously increased. Some years ago the price of a slave was\r\nabout £100; now they are worth from £200 to £400. But what must be the\r\ntendency of this fearful competition for a limited supply of human\r\nlabor--limited as long as the slave trade is prohibited--unlimited as\r\nsoon as the slave trade is legalized? What is the actual condition of\r\nthe Southern States at this moment? There is on the ground and being\r\nsecured, according to computation, the largest cotton crop ever known.\r\nThe last estimates vary from 3,550,000 bales to 3,700,000 bales. A very\r\nfew years ago it was calculated that cotton at any thing above _four\r\ncents_ the pound for \"middling quality\" on the spot was a profitable\r\ncrop. Now, the price for the same quality on the spot is fully _ten\r\ncents_ the pound;--and it has been about the same or higher for a long\r\ntime. What is the consequence? A correspondent writing by the last mail\r\nsays: 'The people of this section of the country feel _made of gold_,\r\nand every thing here is, of course, going at full cry--_every planter\r\nwants to open more land and buy more negroes_.' What do these facts\r\nsuggest? Do they furnish no explanation of the strong desire in the\r\nSouthern States to possess Cuba? Do they furnish no explanation of the\r\nexaggerated irritation got up last year in respect to the West India\r\nsquadron, and the demand of the American Government, we fear too\r\nsuccessfully made, that the right of search in the mitigated form in\r\nwhich it existed should be altogether abandoned? A people familiarized\r\nnot only with slavery, but also with the slave trade as between one\r\nclass of States and another, can hardly be expected to entertain a very\r\nstrong repugnance to a slave trade from beyond the seas. That cargoes of\r\nimported slaves have recently been landed in the United States is not\r\ndenied:--that vessels fitted out as slavers have recently been seized in\r\nAmerican ports, we know upon official authority. The same correspondent\r\nwhom we have already quoted, says there are two great questions which\r\noccupy the Southern States at this moment. The one is the acquisition of\r\nCuba. 'The other,' he says, 'is one which has been presented to me\r\nforcibly during my sojourn in the South, and that is the increase of\r\nslave population. You must have noticed an illicit importation of\r\nnegroes from Africa landed in Georgia. This has undoubtedly been done,\r\nand I doubt not also that other negroes have been landed. It is of\r\ncourse the desire of every honest man that the whole force of the\r\ngovernment should be used to put down such a trade, and punish the\r\noffenders; but I fear the profits of the trade are so enormous that it\r\nwill be carried on in the face of all opposition. Negroes are now worth\r\nhere from 1,000 to 2,000 dollars a-piece. The subject of their being\r\nintroduced is being openly discussed, and the propriety of the trade\r\nbeing again legalized. It is plain this discussion will by and by take\r\nshape. Will not the government be obliged to listen to it, and what will\r\nbe the result? When labor is so profitable it will be obtained. How? I\r\nconfess to looking upon this subject with great anxiety. The feeling\r\nwith regard to slavery both in the North and South has undergone a\r\nmaterial change in the last four years. It is now looked upon with far\r\nless abhorrence.' Is it possible to separate the danger which is here\r\npresented so forcibly from the question of the high price of cotton? We\r\nknow by experience the influence which the Southern States can exercise\r\nupon the election of a President. . . . . . . If the free States are\r\nindifferent, we know that, at whatever risk, the slave States will have\r\ntheir own way; and with them it is plain that much must depend upon the\r\nprice of cotton and the motives which it furnishes to '_open more land\r\nand buy more negroes_.'\r\n\r\n\"But with what an enormous interest does this view of the case invest\r\nthe cultivation of cotton in India. It is the only real obstacle that we\r\ncan interpose to the growing feeling in favor of slavery, to the\r\ndiminishing abhorrence of the slave trade in the United States. It is\r\nthe only field, competition with which can, for many years to come,\r\nredress the undue stimulant which high prices are giving to slave labor\r\nin America. Nor do the facts as regard the past discourage the hope that\r\nit may be successfully used for that purpose. In 1840 the supply of\r\ncotton from India was 77,011,000 lbs.;--in 1858 it had risen to\r\n138,253,000 lbs.: having been in the immediately preceding year no less\r\nthan 250,338,000 lbs. The average importation for four years from 1840\r\nto 1843 amounted to 83,300,000 lbs.:--the average importation for the\r\nlast four years has been 178,000,000 lbs. or somewhat more than double\r\nthat of the former period. In some important respects the conditions of\r\nsupply from India differ very much from those which attach to and\r\ndetermine the supply from America. In India there is no limit to the\r\nquantity of labor. There may be said to be little or none to the\r\nquantity of land. The obstacle is of another kind; it lies almost\r\nexclusively in the want of cheap transit. Our supplies of India cotton\r\nare not even determined by the quantity produced, but by that which,\r\nwhen produced, can profitably be forwarded to England. It is, therefore,\r\na question of price whether we obtain more or less. A rise in the price\r\nof _one penny_ the pound in 1857, suddenly increased the supply from\r\n180,000,000 lbs. in 1856 to 250,000,000 lbs. in 1857. A fall in the\r\nprice in 1858 again suddenly reduced it to 138,000,000 lbs. It was not\r\nthat the production of cotton varied in these proportions in those\r\nyears, but that at given prices it was possible to incur more cost in\r\nthe transit than at others. The same high price, therefore, which at\r\npresent renders a large supply possible from India, creates an unusual\r\ndemand for slaves in the United States. But would not the same\r\ncorrective consequence be produced if we could diminish the cost of\r\ntransit in India? Every farthing a pound saved in carriage is equivalent\r\nto so much added to the price of cotton. Four-pence the pound in the\r\nLiverpool market for good India cotton, with a cost of two-pence from\r\nthe spot of production, would command just as great a supply as a price\r\nof five-pence the pound if the intermediate cost were three-pence. The\r\nwhole question resolves itself into one of good roads and cheap\r\nconveyance. Labor in India is infinitely more abundant than in the\r\nUnited States, and much cheaper; land is at least as cheap; the climate\r\nis as good;--but the bullock trains on the miserable roads of Hindostan\r\ncannot compete with the steamers and other craft on the Mississippi. No\r\ndoubt we have new hopes in the district of Scinde, and in the aid of the\r\nIndus. We have new hopes in the railways which are being\r\nconstructed,--not only in cheapening transit, but even more in improving\r\nthe condition in which native produce will be brought to market.\r\nWhatever, therefore, be the financial sacrifice which in the first place\r\nmust be made for the purpose of opening the interior of India, it should\r\nbe cheerfully made, as the only means by which we can hope permanently\r\nto improve the revenues of India, to increase and cheapen the supply of\r\nthe most important raw material of our own industry, and to bring in\r\nthe abundant labor of the millions of our fellow-subjects in India, to\r\nredress the deficiency in the slave States of America, and thus to give\r\nthe best practical check to the growing attractions of slavery and the\r\nslave trade.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1859, the editor resumes the subject, and discusses the\r\nbearing which the movements making in Africa are likely to have upon\r\nthese interests.\r\n\r\n\"We pointed out in a recent number the very close connection between the\r\ntraditional policy of England in resisting the slave trade, and the\r\nefforts which are now making to find other sources of cotton supply\r\nbesides the United States. We showed that a cry is now arising in the\r\nUnited States, for the renewal of the slave trade--a cry stimulated\r\nprincipally by the high price of cotton. We showed that for every slave\r\nin the Southern States there is on the average a bale of cotton produced\r\nannually, and that as the demand for cotton, and consequently the price\r\nof cotton rises, the demand for slaves and the price of slaves rises\r\nwith it. In the words of a correspondent whom we then quoted, 'every\r\nplanter wants to open more land and buy more negroes.' Hence the demand\r\nin the South for the recently successful attempt to smuggle\r\nslave-cargoes into Georgia. If, then, either in India or any other\r\nquarter of the world, it be possible either to cheapen the carriage or\r\nfacilitate the growth of cotton, so as to bring it into the English\r\nmarkets at a price that can compete successfully with the American\r\ncotton, we are conferring a double benefit on mankind--we are increasing\r\nthe supply of one of the most necessary, and, relatively to the demand,\r\none of the least abundant, articles of commerce, on the steady supply of\r\nwhich the livelihood of millions, and the comfort of almost every\r\ncivilized nation on the face of the earth, depends, and by means of the\r\nincreased competition we are diminishing the force of the motive which\r\nis now threatening the United States with a renewal of the slave trade.\r\nWe cannot, therefore, well conceive of stronger considerations than\r\nthose which are now urging Englishmen to do what may be in their power\r\nfor the promotion of an increased supply from cotton-growing countries\r\nother than the States of America.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these reasons which apply to the promotion of the cotton-supply\r\nin India, or in our own West Indian islands, there is one peculiar to\r\nthe case of Africa which makes it important that no opportunities of\r\nencouraging the cotton-growth of that continent should be neglected. The\r\nAfrican supply, if ever it become large, will not only check the rise in\r\nthe price of cotton, and therefore of slaves in America,--but it will\r\ndiminish the profits of slave exportation on the coast of Africa.\r\nExperience has now sufficiently proved to us, that no one agency has\r\nbeen so effective in paralyzing the slave trade as the growth of any\r\nbranch of profitable industry which convinces the native African chiefs\r\nthat they can get a surer and, in the long run, larger profit by\r\nemploying their subjects in peaceful labor, than they can even get from\r\nthe large but uncertain gains of the slave trade. . . . . Once let the\r\nAfrican chiefs find out, as in many instances they have already found\r\nout, that the sale of the laborer can be only a source of profit _once_,\r\nwhile his labor may be a source of constant and increasing profit, and\r\nwe shall hear no more of their killing the hen which may lay so many\r\ngolden eggs, for the sake only of a solitary and final prize.\"\r\n\r\nThe _American Missionary_, of April, 1859, gives a condensed statement\r\nof a discussion in the British Parliament, last summer, in which the\r\ncondition of cotton culture in Africa was brought out, and its\r\nencouragement strongly urged as a means of suppressing the slave trade,\r\nand of increasing the supplies of that commodity to the manufacturers of\r\nEngland. S. Fitzgerald, Under Secretary of State, said:\r\n\r\n\"He did not scruple to say that, looking at the papers which he had\r\nperused, it was to the West Coast of Africa that we must look for that\r\nlarge increase in our supply of cotton which was now becoming absolutely\r\nnecessary, and without which he and others who had studied this subject\r\nforesaw grave consequences to the most important branch of the\r\nmanufactures of this country. Our consul at Lagos reported:\r\n\r\n\"The whole of the Yoruba and other countries south of the Niger, with\r\nthe Houssa and the Nuffe countries on the north side of that river, have\r\nbeen, from all time, cotton-growing countries; and notwithstanding the\r\ncivil wars, ravages, disorders and disruptions caused by the slave\r\ntrade, more than sufficient cotton to clothe their populations has\r\nalways been cultivated, and their fabrics have found markets and a ready\r\nsale in those countries where the cotton plant is not cultivated, and\r\ninto which the fabrics of Manchester and Glasgow have not yet\r\npenetrated. The cultivation of cotton, therefore, in the above-named\r\ncountries is not new to the inhabitants; all that is required is to\r\noffer them a market for the sale of as much as they can cultivate, and\r\nby preventing the export of slaves from the seaboard render some\r\nsecurity to life, freedom, property, and labor.\" Another of our consuls,\r\nspeaking of the trade in the Bight of Benin in 1856, said:\r\n\r\n\"'The readiness with which the inhabitants of the large town of\r\nAbbeokuta have extended their cultivation of the cotton plant merits the\r\nfavorable notice of the manufacturer and of the philanthropist, as a\r\nmeans of supplanting the slave trade.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It was worthy of notice that while the quantity of cotton obtained from\r\nAmerica between 1784 and 1791, the first seven years of the importation\r\ninto this country was only 74 bales; during the years 1855 and 1856 the\r\ntown of Abbeokuta alone exported nearly twenty times that quantity. He\r\nthought he might fairly say that if we succeed in repressing the\r\nslave-trade, as he believed we should, we should in a few years receive\r\na very large supply of this most important article from the West Coast\r\nof Africa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. J. H. Gurney said he had received from Mr. Thomas Clegg, of\r\nManchester, a few figures, from which it appeared that while in 1852\r\nonly 1800 lbs. of cotton had been brought into Great Britain from\r\nAfrica, in the first five months of the present year it was 94,400 lbs.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Buxton said: 'There was no question now, that any required amount\r\nof cotton, equal to that of New Orleans in quality, might be obtained. A\r\nvery short time ago Mr. Clegg, of Manchester, aided by the Rev. H. Venn,\r\nand a few other gentlemen, trained and sent out two or three young\r\nnegroes as agents to Abbeokuta. These young men taught the natives to\r\ncollect and clean their cotton, and sent it home to England. The result\r\nwas, that the natives had actually purchased 250 cotton-gins for\r\ncleaning their cotton. Mr. Clegg stated that he was in correspondence\r\nwith seventy-six natives and other African traders, twenty-two of them\r\nbeing chiefs. With one of them Mr. Clegg had a transaction, by which he\r\n(the African) received £3500. And the amount of cotton received at\r\nManchester had risen, hand over hand, till it came last year to nearly\r\n100,000 lbs.' Well might Mr. Clegg say, that this was 'a rare instance\r\nof the rapid development of a particular trade, and the more so because\r\nevery ounce of cotton had been collected, all labor performed, and the\r\nresponsibility borne by native Africans alone.' The fact was, that the\r\nWest African natives were not mere savages. In trade no men could show\r\nmore energy and quickness. And a considerable degree of social\r\norganization existed. He could give a thousand proofs of this, but he\r\nwould only quote a word or two from Lieutenant May's despatch to Lord\r\nClarendon, dated the 24th of November, 1857. Lieutenant May crossed\r\noverland from the Niger to Lagos, and he says:\r\n\r\n\"A very pleasing and hopeful part of my report lies in the fact, that\r\ncertainly three-quarters of the country was under cultivation. Nor was\r\nthis the only evidence of the industry and peace of the country; in\r\nevery hut is cotton spinning; in every town is weaving, dyeing; often\r\niron smelting, pottery works, and other useful employments are to be\r\nwitnessed; while from town to town, for many miles, the entire road\r\npresents a continuous file of men, women, and children carrying these\r\narticles of their production for sale. I entertain feelings of much\r\nincreased respect for the industry and intellect of these people, and\r\nadmiration for their laws and manners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Palmerston said: 'I venture to say that you will find on the West\r\nCoast of Africa a most valuable supply of cotton, so essential to the\r\nmanufactures of this country. The cotton districts of Africa are more\r\nextensive than those of India. The access to them is more easy than to\r\nthe Indian cotton district; and I venture to say that your commerce with\r\nthe Western Coast of Africa, in the article of cotton, will, in a few\r\nyears, prove to be far more valuable than that of any other portion of\r\nthe world, the United States alone excepted.'\"\r\n\r\nThe _London Anti-Slavery Reporter_, as quoted by the _American\r\nMissionary_ of March, 1859, says:\r\n\r\n\"A few days ago, Mr. Consul Campbell addressed us, saying: 'African\r\ncotton is no myth. A vessel has just arrived from Lagos with 607 bales\r\non board, _on native account_. Several hundred bales more have been\r\npreviously shipped this year.'\r\n\r\n\"In order to afford our readers some idea of the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of this branch of native African industry and commerce, we\r\nappend a statement which will exhibit it at a single glance. We have\r\nonly to observe that we are indebted to Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester,\r\nfor these interesting particulars, and that the quantities ordered have\r\nbeen obtained from Abbeokuta alone. He is about to extend the field of\r\nhis operations. Four Europeans have gone out, expressly to trade in\r\nnative cotton; and several London houses, encouraged by the success\r\nwhich has attended Mr. Clegg's experiment, are about to invest largely\r\nin the same traffic. The quantity of raw cotton which has already been\r\nimported into England, from Abbeokuta, since 1851, is 276,235 lbs., and\r\nthe trade has developed itself as follows:\r\n\r\n          1851-52       9 Bags or Bales      lbs.   1810\r\n          1853         37    ditto                  4617\r\n          1854          7    ditto                  1588\r\n          1855         14    ditto                  1651\r\n          1856        103    ditto                11,492\r\n          1857        283    ditto                35,419\r\n          1858       1819    ditto               220,099\r\n\r\n\"The last importation includes advices from Lagos up to the 1st of last\r\nNovember. Since that time, the presses and other machinery sent out,\r\nhave been got into full work, and the quantity of the raw staple in\r\nstock has rapidly accumulated, the bulk shipped being on 'native\r\naccount.' Each bag or bale weighs about 120 lbs. Let it be borne in mind\r\nthat the whole of this quantity has been collected, all the labor\r\nperformed and the responsibility borne by native Africans; while the\r\ncost of production, Mr. Clegg informs us, does not exceed one half-penny\r\na pound in the end. It can be laid down in England at about 4 1/4_d._ a\r\npound, and sells at from 7_d._ to 9_d._\"\r\n\r\nThe great point of interest in this movement consists in the fact, that\r\nin promoting the production of cotton in Africa, Englishmen are giving\r\ndirect encouragement to the employment of slave labor. It is an\r\nundeniable fact, that from eight-tenths to nine-tenths of the population\r\nof Africa are held as slaves by the petty kings and chiefs; and that,\r\nmore especially, the women, under the prevailing system of polygamy, are\r\ndoomed to out-doors' labor for the support of their indolent and sensual\r\nhusbands. Hitherto the labor of the women has, in general, been\r\ncomparatively light, as the preparation of food and clothing limited the\r\nextent of effort required of them; but now, the cotton mills of England\r\nmust be supplied by them, and the hum of the spindles will sound the\r\nknell of their days of ease. That we are not alone in this view of the\r\nquestion, will appear from the opinions expressed by the _American\r\nMissionary_, when referring to this subject. It says:\r\n\r\n\"An encouraging feature in this movement is, that the men engaged in it\r\nall feel that the suppression of the slave trade is absolutely essential\r\nto its success. The necessity of this is the great burden of all their\r\narguments in its behalf. It thus acts with a double force. There can be\r\nno question that the development of the resources of Africa will be an\r\neffectual means, in itself, of discouraging the exportation of slaves,\r\nwhile at the same time those who would encourage this development are\r\nseeking the overthrow of that infamous traffic as the necessary removal\r\nof an obstacle to their success.\r\n\r\n\"There is, however, one danger connected with all this that can not be\r\nobviated by any effort likely to be put forth under the stimulus of\r\ncommerce, or the spirit of trade. This danger can be averted only by\r\nsending the missionaries of a pure gospel, a gospel of equal and\r\nimpartial love, into Africa, in numbers commensurate with the increase\r\nof its agricultural resources and its spirit of general enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"The danger to which we allude is not merely that of worldliness, such\r\nas in a community always accompanies an increase of wealth, but that the\r\nslavery now existing there may be strengthened and increased by the\r\nrapid rise in the value of labor, and thus become so firmly rooted that\r\nthe toil of ages may be necessary for it removal. All this might have\r\nbeen prevented if the spirit of Christian enterprise had gone ahead of\r\nthat of commerce, and thus prepared the way for putting commerce, under\r\nthe influence of Christianity. For years Africa has been open to the\r\nmissionary of the cross, to go everywhere preaching love to God and man,\r\nwith nothing to hinder except the sickliness of the climate. This evil,\r\nand the dangers arising from it, business men are willing to risk, and\r\nwithin the next ten years there will be thousands, and tens of\r\nthousands, looking to Africa for the means of increasing their riches.\"\r\n\r\nFrom all this it appears, that the question of slavery is becoming more\r\nintimately blended with cotton culture than at any former period; and\r\nthat the urgent demand for its increased production must establish the\r\nsystem permanently, under the control of Great Britain, in Africa\r\nitself. Look at the facts, and especially at the position of Great\r\nBritain. The supply of cotton is inadequate to the demands of the\r\nmanufacturing nations. Great Britain stands far in advance of all others\r\nin the quantity consumed. The ratio of increased production in the\r\nUnited States cannot be advanced except by a renewal of the slave trade,\r\nor a resort to the scheme of immigration on the plan of England and\r\nFrance. It is thought by English writers, that the renewal of the slave\r\ntrade by the United States is inevitable, as a consequence of the\r\npresent high prices of cotton and slaves, unless the slave traders can\r\nbe shut out from the slave markets of Africa. They assume it as a\r\nsettled principle, that the immigration system is impracticable wherever\r\nslavery exists; and that the American planter can only succeed in\r\nsecuring additional labor by means of the slave trade. Then, according\r\nto this theory, to prevent an increased production of cotton in the\r\nUnited States, it is only necessary to make it impracticable for us to\r\nrenew that traffic.\r\n\r\nThe supply of cotton from India is not on the increase, nor can be,\r\nexcept when prices rule high in England, or until rail roads shall be\r\nconstructed into the interior, a work requiring much time and money. The\r\nrenewal of the slave trade by the United States, on a large scale,\r\nwould, of course, cheapen cotton in the proportion of the amount of\r\nlabor supplied. In this view the writers referred to are correct. They\r\nare right also in supposing that a reduction below present prices, of a\r\ncent or two per pound, would be ruinous to India in the present\r\ncondition of her inland transportation. They desire, very naturally,\r\ntherefore, that prices should be kept up for the advantage of India, so\r\nthat its cotton can bear export. But while high prices benefit India,\r\nthey also enrich the American planter, and afford him inducements to\r\nrenew the slave trade.\r\n\r\nHere Great Britain is thrown into a dilemma. The slave trade to America\r\nmust be prevented, in her opinion, or it will ruin the East Indies. To\r\nprevent the renewal of this traffic--to keep up the price of cotton as\r\nlong as may be necessary, for the benefit of India, and prevent a supply\r\nof African slaves from reaching the American planter--is a problem that\r\nrequires more than an ordinary amount of skill to solve. That skill, if\r\nit exists any where, is possessed by British statesmen, and they are now\r\nemployed in the execution of this difficult task. They are convinced\r\nthat free labor cannot be found, at this moment, any where in the world,\r\nto meet the growing demands for cotton. To supply this increasing\r\ndemand, a new element must be brought into requisition; or rather old\r\nelements must be employed anew. Her cotton spindles must not cease to\r\nwhir, or millions of the people of Great Britain will starve at home, or\r\nbe forced into emigration, to the weakening of her strength. The old\r\nsources of supply being inadequate, a new field of operations must be\r\nopened up--new forces must be brought into requisition in the\r\ncultivation of cotton. Slave labor and free labor, both combined, are\r\nnot now able to furnish the quantity needed. Free labor cannot be\r\nincreased, at present, in this department of production. Slave labor,\r\ntherefore, is the only means left by which the work can be\r\naccomplished--not slave labor to the extent now employed, but to the\r\nextent to which it may be increased from the ranks of the scores of\r\nmillions of the population of Africa.\r\n\r\nThis is the true state of the case; and the important question now\r\nagitated is: Who shall have the advantages of this labor? Two fields,\r\nonly, present themselves in which this additional labor can be\r\nemployed--Africa and America. Great Britain is deeply interested in\r\nlimiting it to Africa, which she can only do by preventing a renewal of\r\nthe slave trade to America: for she takes it for granted that we will\r\nrenew the slave trade if we can make money by the operation. South\r\nAfrica is unavailable for this purpose, as it is under British rule, and\r\nslavery abolished within its limits by law. Nothing can be done there,\r\nas it is filling up with English emigrants who will not toil, under a\r\nburning sun, in the cotton fields; and they can not be permitted to\r\nreduce the natives again to slavery. West Africa alone, affords the\r\nclimate, soil, and population, necessary to success in cotton culture.\r\nTo this point the attention of Englishmen is now mainly directed. One\r\nfeature in the civil condition of West Africa must be specially noticed,\r\nas adapting it to the purposes to which it is to be devoted. The\r\nterritory has not been seized by the British crown, as in South Africa,\r\nand British law does not bear rule within its limits. The tribes are\r\ntreated as independent sovereignties, and are governed by their own\r\ncustoms and laws. This is fortunate for the new policy now inaugurating,\r\nas the native chiefs and kings hold the population at large as slaves.\r\nHeretofore they have sold their slaves at will, as well as their\r\ncaptives taken in war, to the slave traders. Now they are to be taught a\r\ndifferent policy by Englishmen; and the African slaveholders are to be\r\nconvinced that they will make more money by employing their slaves in\r\ngrowing cotton, than in selling them to be carried off to the American\r\nplanters. This done, and the transportation of laborers to the United\r\nStates will be prevented. This will put it out of the power of our\r\nplanters, to increase their production of cotton so as to reduce prices;\r\nand this will enable India to complete her rail roads, so as to be able\r\nto compete with American cotton at any price whatever.\r\n\r\nBut this new policy, if successful, will do more than stop the slave\r\ntrade, to the supposed injury of the American planter. England will\r\nthereby have the benefit of the labor of Africa secured to herself. With\r\nits scores of millions of population under her direction, she hopes to\r\ncompete with American slavery in the production of cotton; and not only\r\nto compete with it, but to surpass it altogether, and, in time, to\r\nrender it so profitless as to force emancipation upon us. She will there\r\nhave access to a population ten fold greater than that of the slave\r\npopulation of the United States; and the only doubt of success exists in\r\nthe question, as to whether the negro master in Africa can make the\r\nslave work as well there as the white master in America has done here.\r\n\r\nBut how shall England, in this measure, preserve her \"traditional\r\npolicy,\" in which she pledged herself no longer to cherish slave labor.\r\nThis will be very easily done. She need not authorize slavery in Western\r\nAfrica; but as it already exists among all the tribes \"by local law,\"\r\nshe has only to recognize their independence, and bargain with the\r\nchiefs for all the cotton they can force their slaves to produce. This\r\nhas already been done, by Englishmen, at several points in Africa, and\r\nwill doubtless be resorted to in many other portions of that country.\r\nThe moral responsibility of establishing slavery permanently in Africa,\r\nwill thus be thrown upon the chiefs and kings, as it has heretofore been\r\nupon the American planter; and Great Britain can reap all the advantages\r\nof the increased production of slave labor cotton, while her moralists\r\ncan easily satisfy the conscience of the people at home, by declaiming\r\nagainst the system which secures to them their bread.\r\n\r\nHere now the policy of British statesmen can be comprehended. They must\r\nhave cotton. The products of free labor would be preferred, but as it\r\ncan not be had, in sufficient quantities, they must take that of slave\r\nlabor. To allow the American planter to supply this want, by renewing\r\nthe slave trade, would ruin India and benefit America. To save India,\r\nand, at the same time, to secure the cotton demanded by the\r\nmanufacturers, slavery is to be encouraged in Africa; and this is to be\r\ndone as a means not only of preventing the slave trade, and checking the\r\nextension of slavery in America, but of multiplying the fields of cotton\r\ncultivation--a policy very essential to the wants of the British nation.\r\nThus, slavery is to be promoted in Africa as an effectual means of\r\nchecking it in America; it is to be converted into a blessing there, and\r\nmade instrumental in wiping out its curse here!\r\n\r\nAnd this, now, is the result of England's philanthropic efforts for\r\nAfrican freedom. Her economical errors, in West Indian emancipation, are\r\nto be repaired by the permanent establishment of slavery in Africa! But\r\nwhat must be the practical moral effect of her policy? What must be the\r\nopinion entertained of the negro race, when Great Britain abandons her\r\npolicy in reference to them? This is not hard to divine. It will wipe\r\nout the odium she has managed to cast upon the system; and, so far as\r\nher example is concerned, will justify the American planter in refusing\r\nto emancipate his slaves. Her conduct is a practical acknowledgment of\r\nthe Southern theory of the African race--that slavery is their normal\r\ncondition, otherwise she must have adopted the same policy in West\r\nAfrica that she has in South Africa.\r\n\r\nBut before closing this part of our investigations, it may be well to\r\nexamine the claims of Great Britain in relation to her humanity towards\r\nthe African, or any of the inferior races doomed to lives of toil--such\r\nas the coolies of India and the laborers of China.\r\n\r\nThe contest for the advantages of supplying the increasing demands for\r\ncotton, is between Great Britain operating in India and Africa, and the\r\nAmerican planter operating by an increased amount of labor furnished by\r\nmeans of the slave trade. The contest between the parties may be\r\nimagined as assuming this form: A portion of the American planters\r\ninsist, that they should be allowed to manage this matter; but Great\r\nBritain says, nay: my subjects can do it better than you can. You\r\nAmericans are governed by mercenary motives: we Britons by philanthropic\r\nintentions. You Americans have made no sacrifices for the cause of\r\nhumanity: we Britons have emancipated our West India slaves.\r\n\r\nAye, aye, replies the American planter; we understand all about the\r\nhumanity of which you boast. Your special type of philanthropy is fully\r\ndisplayed in the history of your West Indies. Look at it. The total\r\nimportation of slaves from Africa into your West Indian Islands, was\r\n1,700,000 persons; of whom and their descendants, in 1833, only 660,000\r\nremained for emancipation; we had less than 400,000 imported Africans,\r\nof whom and their descendants there existed among us, in 1850, more than\r\n3,600,000 persons of African descent; that is to say, the number of\r\nAfricans and their descendants in the United States, is nearly eight or\r\nten to one of those that were imported, whilst in the British West\r\nIndies there are not two persons remaining for every five imported.[37]\r\nAnd besides, we have 500,000 free colored persons among us, a number\r\nnearly equal to that which your emancipation act set at liberty, and\r\nmore than the whole number imported. Your slavery seems to have been a\r\nsystem of wholesale slaughter: ours the reverse.\r\n\r\nAll true, says Britain: but then we have ceased to do evil, and are\r\nlearning to do well. We found \"that slavery was bearing our colonies\r\ndown to ruin with awful speed; that had it lasted but another half\r\ncentury, they must have sunk beyond recovery.\"[38]\r\n\r\nWhat! says the planter; sunk beyond recovery! why, we find our slaves\r\nrapidly increasing, and ourselves almost \"made of gold.\" Be pleased to\r\nexplain, why slavery in the hands of Englishmen should be so\r\ndestructive, while with the American it is not only profitable to the\r\nslaveholder himself, but the comfort of the slaves has been so well\r\nsecured, from the first, that their natural increase has been about\r\nequal to that of any other people in the full enjoyment of the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\nCertainly, says Britain: having done our duty, we are free to confess,\r\nthat \"what gave the death blow to slavery, in the minds of English\r\nstatesmen, was the population returns, which showed the fact, 'the\r\nappalling fact,' that although only eleven out of the eighteen islands\r\nhad sent them in, yet in those eleven islands the slaves had decreased\r\nin twelve years, by no less than 60,219, namely: from 558,194 to\r\n497,975![39] Had similar returns been procured from the other seven\r\ncolonies (including Mauritius, Antigua, Barbadoes, and Granada,) the\r\ndecrease must have been little, if at all, less than 100,000! Now it was\r\nplain to every one that if this were really so, the system could not\r\nlast. The driest economist would allow that it would not pay, to let the\r\nworking classes be slaughtered. To work the laboring men of our West\r\nIndies to death, might bring in a good return for a while, but could not\r\nbe a profitable enterprise in the long run. Accordingly, this was the\r\nmain, we had almost said the only, topic of the debates on slavery in\r\n1831 and 1832. Is slavery causing a general massacre of the working\r\nclasses in our sugar islands, or is it not, was a question worth\r\ndebating, in the pounds, shillings, and pence view, as well as in the\r\nmoral one. And debated it was, long and fiercely. The result was the\r\nfull establishment of the dreadful fact. The slaves, as Mr. Marryatt\r\nsaid, were 'dying like rotten sheep.' Whatever then may be said for West\r\nIndian slavery, this damning thing must be said of it, that _the slaves\r\nwere dying of it_. Then came emancipation.\"[40] And in performing this\r\nact--in demonstrating to the world the destructive character of\r\nslavery--Englishmen expected America to follow their example, and to\r\nemancipate her slaves also.\r\n\r\nAnd thereby deceived yourselves, says the planter, into the ruin of your\r\nislands, without effecting any good for the Africans at large, and but\r\nlittle for those upon whom your bounties were bestowed. And, then, we\r\ncannot see the vastness of your philanthropy, in allowing such\r\ndestructive cruelties to prevail so long, and in only emancipating your\r\nslaves when it was apparent they must soon become extinct under the\r\nlash, as applied by the hands of Britons. We know that you claimed that\r\nslavery was the same everywhere, and that humane men in our country were\r\ndeceived into the belief that American slavery was as ruinous to life as\r\nBritish West Indian slavery. We know that the elder Mr. Buxton, in 1831,\r\nused this language, \"where the blacks are free they increase. But let\r\nthere be a change in only one circumstance, let the population be the\r\nsame in every respect, only let them be slaves instead of freemen, and\r\nthe current is immediately stopped;\" and, in support of this, his\r\nbiographer adds: \"This appalling fact was never denied, that at the time\r\nof the abolition of the slave trade, the number of slaves in the West\r\nIndies was 800,000; in 1830 it was 700,000; that is to say, in\r\ntwenty-three years it had diminished by 100,000.\"[41] This assertion,\r\nthat slavery is always destructive of life, was made by Mr. Buxton, in\r\nthe face of the fact, that ten distinct sets of our _Census tables_ were\r\nthen accessible to him, in each one of which he had the evidence that\r\nAmerican slavery, instead of reducing the number of our slave\r\npopulation, tended to its rapid increase. From this and kindred acts of\r\nthat gentleman, we came to the conclusion, that, though he might be very\r\nbenevolent, he was not very truthful; and was, therefore, a very unsafe\r\nguide to follow, as you must now acknowledge; unsafe, because your\r\nemancipation on a small scale, before securing a general emancipation by\r\nother countries, has thrown you under the necessity of now attempting to\r\nestablish slavery elsewhere on a large scale; unsafe, because your negro\r\npopulation have not made half the moral progress under freedom, that\r\nours have done under slavery; and because, that, where cultivation has\r\ndepended upon the emancipated negro alone, with a single exception, the\r\nislands have almost gone to ruin.[42]\r\n\r\nYou misinterpret facts, says Britain: our islands are not ruined; no, by\r\nno means. Under slavery they would have been totally ruined; but\r\nemancipation has placed them in a position favorable to a full\r\ndevelopment of all their resources. \"It is to be borne in mind that the\r\ninflux of free labor is exactly one of those advantages of which a land\r\nis debarred by slavery. It is a part of the curse of slavery that it\r\nrepels the freeman. When we are told that to judge of the effect of\r\nemancipation we must exclude those colonies that imported coolies, we\r\nreply at once that this useful importation has been one of the many\r\nblessings that freedom has brought in her train.\"[43]\r\n\r\nI understand your views now, says the planter: but for emancipation,\r\nyour colonies would have sunk to irretrievable destruction. That measure\r\nhas prepared the way for the coolie system; and under its operations the\r\nprosperity of your islands is on the increase. But what is the character\r\nof this coolie system, that is working such wonders? In what does it\r\ndiffer from the slave trade, of which you desire to deprive us? And what\r\nmust be its effects upon the colored population, which have received\r\ntheir freedom at your hands, and whose moral elevation your Christian\r\nmissionaries are laboring to promote? On this point I would not multiply\r\ntestimony. The character of the coolie traffic is but too well\r\nunderstood, and is now believed by all intelligent men to be the slave\r\ntrade in disguise. A writer, representing the anti-slavery society of\r\nGreat Britain, makes these statements.[44]\r\n\r\n\"I am prepared to show, that fraud, misrepresentation, and actual\r\nviolence are the constituent elements of the immigration system, even as\r\nit is now conducted, and that no vigilance on the part of the government\r\nwhich superintends its prosecution can prevent the abuses incidental to\r\nit. . . . . In China, especially, this is notoriously the case, and I\r\nrefer you to Sir John Bowring's despatches on Immigration from China,\r\nfor the fullest revelations. I need only add, that he designates the\r\nChinese coolie traffic as being in every essential particular 'as bad as\r\nthe African slave trade,' and that he recommends its entire prohibition.\r\n. . . . The mortality during the sea-voyage is so great, that the\r\nEmigration Commissioners declare 'these results to be shocking to\r\nhumanity, and disgraceful to the manner in which the traffic is carried\r\non.' I beg to call your special attention to the term 'traffic,' and to\r\nrefer you for particulars of the mortality, to the Emigration\r\nCommissioners' Report for 1858. They may be briefly summarised. During\r\nthe season 1856-57 the deaths at sea amounted to 17.26/100 per cent. on\r\n4,094 coolies shipped from Calcutta--a rate which, if computed for the\r\nwhole year, instead of 90 days, the term of the voyage, would average\r\nupwards of 70 per cent. The rate of mortality on shipments of Chinese\r\nbound to British Guiana, varied from 14 per cent. to 50. . . . . On\r\nshipments of Chinese bound to Havanna, on board British vessels, the\r\ndeath-rate fluctuated between 20 per cent. and 60. Yet, sir, immigration\r\nis said, by its advocates, to be now conducted on an improved system. .\r\n. . . We come now to the treatment of the coolie, as soon as he is\r\ndischarged from the ship. There is no official evidence, that I am yet\r\naware of, to show what abuses of authority he is subjected to, but the\r\nJamaica Immigration Bill, now awaiting the sanction of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, proves that the imported laborer is, during his term of\r\nservice, subject to conditions quite incompatible with a system of free\r\nlabor, and the same remark applies to other colonies. That the\r\nimmigrants are liable to ill usage and neglect, may be gathered from the\r\nreports of travelers who have seen them in every stage of destitution\r\nand misery; and that they are peculiarly affected by the kind of service\r\nthey contract to render, and by climate, is sufficiently proved by the\r\nawful mortality during industrial residence, which we are assured the\r\nImmigration Agent General's returns for Jamaica show to be equal to 50\r\nper cent. Sir E. B. Lytton admits it to be 33 per cent. But if we accept\r\nhis correction--which I confess I am not prepared to do without knowing\r\nupon what evidence he makes it--I maintain that even this death-rate\r\nestablishes the startling fact, that coolie labor in Jamaica is\r\nproportionately more destructive to human life than slave labor in\r\nCuba.\"\r\n\r\nOn the question of the influence that the coolie immigration exerts upon\r\nthe emancipated blacks in the West Indies, the Editor of the _London\r\nEconomist_ very justly remarks:\r\n\r\n\"Bringing with them depraved heathen habits, and the detestable\r\ntraditions of the worst forms of idolatry, and always looking forward to\r\ntheir return as the epoch when they will renew their heathen worship and\r\nfind themselves again among heathen standards of action,--they are\r\nalmost proof against the best influences which can be brought to bear\r\nupon them, and, what is worse, they are not only proof against the good,\r\nbut missionaries for evil. They are closely associated in their labor\r\nwith a race that is just emerging out of barbarism with the fostering\r\ncare of Christianity, and we need not say that their social influence on\r\nsuch a race is deteriorating in the extreme. The difficulty would be\r\nindefinitely diminished, were the new immigrants a permanent addition to\r\nthe population. By careful regulations for that purpose, they might, in\r\nthat case, be subdued by the higher influences of their English\r\nteachers; but the prospect of speedy restoration to the country and\r\nhabits of their birth, entirely foils such attempts as these. How far\r\nthis great difficulty can be overcome; and if it cannot, how far it may\r\nmore than balance the moral and physical advantages of a fuller labor\r\nmarket,--it requires the most careful inquiry to determine.\" Here now\r\nare four distinct points upon which the testimony shows, conclusively,\r\nthat the coolie system is worse than ever the slave trade has been\r\nrepresented to be; and that as the slave trade is opposed on the ground\r\nof the destruction of human life which attends it, so the coolie system\r\nshould be abandoned upon the same grounds. The points are these: 1st,\r\nthe frauds and cruelties incident to the procuring of immigrants; 2d,\r\nthe mortality during the middle passage; 3d, the mortality in the\r\nislands where they are employed; 4th, the influence of the heathen\r\ncoolies in demoralizing the emancipated blacks among whom they are\r\nintermingled. These points demand serious consideration by Britons, as\r\nwell as Americans--by those who would reopen the slave trade, as well as\r\nthose who would substitute for that traffic the immigration system.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in conclusion, says the planter, I must beg to demur to\r\nBritain's claiming a monopoly of all the philanthropy in the world\r\ntoward the African race; and upon that claim founding another which, if\r\ngranted, will secure to her the monopoly of all the labor of Africa\r\nitself; and I would beg, further, that myself and my fellow planters may\r\nbe excused, if we cannot see any thing more in all her movements than a\r\ndetermination to have a full supply of cotton, even at the risk of\r\ndooming Africa to become one vast slave plantation.\r\n\r\nWhile a faithful view of the plans and expectations of the British, in\r\nrelation to the production of cotton in Africa, has been presented, it\r\nwould be doing injustice to the reader not to give a few facts, in\r\nclosing, which indicate that their success, after all, may not equal\r\ntheir anticipations. The Rev. T. J. Bowen,[45] says of African cotton\r\ngenerally, that \"the staple is good, but the yield can not be more than\r\none-fourth of what it was on similar lands in the Southern States;\" and\r\nof Yoruba, in particular, he says, that \"both upland and sea island\r\ncotton are planted; but neither produces very well, owing to the extreme\r\nand constant heat of the climate.\" Of this, Mr. Bowen, who is a native\r\nof Georgia, must be regarded as a good judge. He spent six years as a\r\nmissionary of the Baptist Church in exploring the Abbeokuta and Yoruba\r\ncountry. This cause of short crops in Yoruba is evidently incurable. It\r\ndoes not exist in equal force in Liberia and its vicinity. Mr. Bowen\r\nsays: \"The average in the dry season is about 80 degrees at Ijaye, and\r\n82 at Ogbomoshaw, and a few degrees lower during the rains. I have never\r\nknown the mercury to rise higher than 93 degrees in the shade, at Ijaye.\r\nThe highest reading at Ogbomoshaw was 97.5.\" These places are from 100\r\nto 150 miles inland.[46]\r\n\r\nAnother remark. The confidence with which it is asserted, that\r\nimmigration is impracticable as a means of obtaining labor, wherever\r\nslavery prevails, will remind the reader of another theory to which\r\nEnglishmen long tried to make us converts: that slave labor is\r\nnecessarily unprofitable and should be abandoned on economical grounds.\r\nNow they are forced to admit that our planters seem to \"be made of\r\ngold.\" Perhaps these same planters can use immigrant labor as\r\nsuccessfully as slave labor. If necessary, doubtless, they will make the\r\nattempt, notwithstanding the opinions entertained beyond the sea.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] See Table VIII, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n[37] Compendium of United States Census, 1850.\r\n\r\n[38] Mr. C.

The political\r\ninfluence which these Territories will give to the South, if secured,\r\nwill be of the first importance to perfect its arrangements for future\r\nslavery extension--whether by divisions of the larger States and\r\nTerritories, now secured to the institution, its extension into\r\nterritory hitherto considered free, or the acquisition of new territory\r\nto be devoted to the system, so as to preserve the balance of power in\r\nCongress. When this is done, Kansas and Nebraska, like Kentucky and\r\nMissouri, will be of little consequence to slaveholders, compared with\r\nthe cheap and constant supply of provisions they can yield. Nothing,\r\ntherefore, will so exactly coincide with Southern interests, as a rapid\r\nemigration of freemen into these new Territories. White free labor,\r\ndoubly productive over slave labor in grain-growing, must be multiplied\r\nwithin their limits, that the cost of provisions may be reduced and the\r\nextension of slavery and the growth of cotton suffer no interruption.\r\nThe present efforts to plant them with slavery, are indispensable to\r\nproduce sufficient excitement to fill them speedily with a free\r\npopulation; and if this whole movement has been a Southern scheme to\r\ncheapen provisions, and increase the ratio of the production of sugar\r\nand cotton, as it most unquestionably will do, it surpasses the\r\nstatesman-like strategy which forced the people into an acquiescence in\r\nthe annexation of Texas.\r\n\r\nAnd should the anti-slavery voters succeed in gaining the political\r\nascendency in these Territories, and bring them as free States\r\ntriumphantly into the Union; what can they do, but turn in, as all the\r\nrest of the Western States have done, and help to feed slaves, or those\r\nwho manufacture or who sell the products of the labor of slaves. There\r\nis no other resource left, either to them or to the older free States,\r\nwithout an entire change in almost every branch of business and of\r\ndomestic economy. Reader, look at your bills of dry goods for the year,\r\nand what do they contain? At least three-fourths of the amount are\r\nFrench, English, or American cotton fabrics, woven from slave labor\r\ncotton. Look at your bills for groceries, and what do they contain?\r\nCoffee, sugar, molasses, rice--from Brazil, Cuba, Louisiana, Carolina;\r\nwhile only a mere fraction of them are from free labor countries. As now\r\nemployed, our dry goods' merchants and grocers constitute an immense\r\narmy of agents for the sale of fabrics and products coming, directly or\r\nindirectly, from the hand of the slave; and all the remaining portion of\r\nthe people, free colored, as well as white, are exerting themselves,\r\naccording to their various capacities, to gain the means of purchasing\r\nthe greatest possible amount of these commodities. Nor can the country,\r\nat present, by any possibility, pay the amount of foreign goods\r\nconsumed, but by the labor of the slaves of the planting States. This\r\ncan not be doubted for a moment. Here is the proof:\r\n\r\nCommerce supplied us, in 1853, with foreign articles, for consumption,\r\nto the value of $250,420,187, and accepted, in exchange, of our\r\nprovisions, to the value of but $33,809,126; while the products of our\r\nslave labor, manufactured and unmanufactured, paid to the amount of\r\n$133,648,603, on the balance of this foreign debt. This, then, is the\r\nmeasure of the ability of the Farmers and Planters, respectively, to\r\nmeet the payment of the necessaries and comforts of life, supplied to\r\nthe country by its foreign commerce. The farmer pays, or seems only to\r\npay, $33,800,000, while the planter has a broad credit, on the account,\r\nof $133,600,000.\r\n\r\nThis was true in 1853: is it so in 1859? The amounts are not now the\r\nsame, but the proportions have not varied materially. Reference to Table\r\nVIII, in the Appendix, will show, that while the provisions exported,\r\nfor the three years preceding 1859, amounted to a yearly average of\r\n$67,512,812, the value of the cotton and tobacco exported, during the\r\nsame period, amounted to an annual average of $147,079,647.\r\n\r\nBut is this seeming productiveness of slavery real, or is it only\r\nimaginary? Has the system such capacities, over the other industrial\r\ninterests of the nation, in the creation of wealth, as these figures\r\nindicate? Or, are these results due to its intermediate position between\r\nthe agriculture of the country and its foreign commerce? These are\r\nquestions worthy of consideration. Were the planters left to grow their\r\nown provisions, they would, as already intimated, be unable to produce\r\nany cotton for export. That their present ability to export so\r\nextensively, is in consequence of the aid they receive from the North,\r\nis proved by facts such as these:\r\n\r\nIn 1820, the cotton-gin had been a quarter of a century in operation,\r\nand the culture of cotton was then nearly as well understood as at\r\npresent. The North, though furnishing the South with some live stock,\r\nhad scarcely begun to supply it with provisions, and the planters had to\r\ngrow the food, and manufacture much of the clothing for their slaves. In\r\nthat year the cotton crop equaled 109 lbs. to each slave in the Union,\r\nof which 83 lbs. per slave were exported. In 1830 the exports of the\r\narticle had risen to 143 lbs., in 1840 to 295 lbs., and in 1853 to 337\r\nlbs. per slave. The total cotton crop of 1853 equaled 395 lbs. per\r\nslave--making both the production and export of that staple, in 1853,\r\nmore than four times as large, in proportion to the slave population, as\r\nthey were in 1820.[47] Had the planters, in 1853, been able to produce\r\nno more cotton, per slave, than in 1820, they would have grown but\r\n359,308,472 lbs., instead of the actual crop of 1,305,152,800 lbs.; and\r\nwould not only have failed to supply any for export, but have barely\r\nsupplied the home demand, and been _minus_ the total crop of that year,\r\nby 945,844,328 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn this estimate, some allowance, perhaps, should be made, for the\r\ngreater fertility of the new lands, more recently brought under\r\ncultivation; but the difference, on this account, can not be equal to\r\nthe difference in the crops of the several periods, as the lands, in the\r\nolder States, in 1820, were yet comparatively fresh and productive.\r\n\r\nAgain, the dependence of the South upon the North, for its provisions,\r\nmay be inferred from such additional facts as these: The \"Abstract of\r\nthe Census,\" for 1850, shows, that the production of wheat, in Florida,\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, averaged, the year\r\npreceding, very little more than a peck, (it was 27/100 of a bushel,) to\r\neach person within their limits. These States must purchase flour\r\nlargely, but to what amount we can not determine. The shipments of\r\nprovisions from Cincinnati to New Orleans and other down river ports,\r\nshow that large supplies leave that city for the South; but what\r\nproportion of them is taken for consumption by the planters, must be\r\nleft, at present, to conjecture. These shipments, as to a few of the\r\nprominent articles, for the four years ending August 31, 1854, averaged\r\nannually the following amounts:\r\n\r\n          Wheat flour        brls.         385,204\r\n          Pork and Bacon      lbs.      43,689,000\r\n          Whisky             gals.       8,115,360\r\n\r\nCincinnati also exports eastward, by canal, river and railroad, large\r\namounts of these productions. The towns and cities westward send more of\r\ntheir products to the South, as their distance increases the cost of\r\ntransportation to the East. But, in the absence of full statistics, it\r\nis not necessary to make additional statements.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the subject, it appears that slavery is not a\r\nself-sustaining system, independently remunerative; but that it attains\r\nits importance to the nation and to the world, by standing as an agency,\r\nintermediate, between the grain-growing States and our foreign commerce.\r\nAs the distillers of the West transformed the surplus grain into\r\nwhisky, that it might bear transport, so slavery takes the products of\r\nthe North, and metamorphoses them into cotton, that they may bear\r\nexport.\r\n\r\nIt seems, indeed, when the whole of the facts brought to view are\r\nconsidered, that American slavery, though of little force unaided, yet\r\nproperly sustained, is the great central power, or energizing influence,\r\nnot only of nearly all the industrial interests of our own country, but\r\nalso of those of Great Britain and much of the Continent; and that, if\r\nstricken from existence, the whole of these interests, with the\r\nadvancing civilization of the age, would receive a shock that must\r\nretard their progress for years to come.\r\n\r\nThis is no exaggerated picture of the present imposing power of slavery.\r\nIt is literally true. Southern men, at an early day, believed that the\r\nProtective Tariff would have paralyzed it--would have destroyed it. But\r\nthe abolitionists, led off by their sympathies with England, and\r\ninfluenced by American politicians and editors, who advocated free\r\ntrade, were made the instruments of its overthrow. No such extended\r\nmining and manufacturing, as the Protective system was expected to\r\ncreate, has now any existence in the Union. Under it, according to the\r\ntheory of its friends, more than one hundred and sixty millions in\r\nvalue, of the foreign imports for 1853, would have been produced in our\r\nown country. But free trade is dominant: the South has triumphed in its\r\nwarfare with the North: the political power passed into its hands with\r\nthe defeat of the Father of the Protective Tariff, ten years since, in\r\nthe last effort of his friends to elevate him to the Presidency: the\r\nslaveholding and commercial interests then gained the ascendency, and\r\nsecured the power of annexing territory at will: the nation has become\r\nrich in commerce, and unbounded in ambition for territorial\r\naggrandizement: the people acquiesce in the measures of Government, and\r\nare proud of the influence it has gained in the world: nay, more, the\r\npeaceful aspect of the nations has been changed, and the policy of our\r\nown country must be modified to meet the exigencies that may arise.\r\n\r\nOne word more on the point we have been considering. With the defeat of\r\nMr. Clay, came the immediate annexation of Texas, and, as he predicted,\r\nthe war with Mexico. The results of these events let loose from its\r\nattachments a mighty avalanche of emigration and of enterprise, under\r\nthe rule of the free trade policy, then adopted, which, by the golden\r\ntreasures it yields, renders that system, thus far, self-sustaining, and\r\nable to move on, as its friends believe, with a momentum that forbids\r\nany attempt to return again to the system of protection. Whether the\r\nTariff controversy is permanently settled, or not, is a question about\r\nwhich we shall not speculate. It may be remarked, however, that one of\r\nthe leading parties in the North gave its adhesion to free trade many\r\nyears since, and still continues to vote with the South. The leading\r\nabolition paper, too, ever since its origin, has advocated the Southern\r\nfree trade system; and thus, in defending the cause it has espoused, as\r\nwas said of a certain general in the Mexican war, its editors have been\r\ndigging their ditches on the wrong side of their breastworks. To say the\r\nleast, their position is a very strange one, for men who profess to\r\nlabor for the subversion of American slavery. It would be as rational to\r\npour oil upon a burning edifice, to extinguish the fire, as to attempt\r\nto overthrow that system under the rule of free trade. For, whatever\r\ndifferences of opinion may exist on the question of free trade, as\r\napplied to the nations at large, there can be no question that it has\r\nbeen the main element in promoting the value of slave labor in the\r\nUnited States; and, consequently, of extending the system of slavery,\r\nvastly, beyond the bounds it would otherwise have reached. But the\r\neditors referred to, do not stand alone. More than one United States\r\nSenator, after acquiring notoriety and position by constant clamors\r\nagainst slavery at home, has not hesitated to vote for free trade at\r\nWashington, with as hearty a good will as any friend of the extension of\r\nslavery in the country!\r\n\r\nAll these things together have paralyzed the advocates of the protection\r\nof free labor, at present, as fully as the North has thereby been shorn\r\nof its power to control the question of slavery. Indeed, from what has\r\nbeen said of the present position of American slavery, in its relation\r\nto the other industrial interests of the country, and of the world,\r\nthere is no longer any doubt that it now supplies the complement of that\r\n_home market_, so zealously urged as essential to the prosperity of the\r\nagricultural population of the country: and which, it was supposed,\r\ncould only be created by the multiplication of domestic manufactures.\r\nThis desideratum being gained, the great majority of the people have\r\nnothing more to ask, but seem desirous that our foreign commerce shall\r\nbe cherished; that the cultivation of cotton and sugar shall be\r\nextended; that the nation shall become cumulative as well as\r\nprogressive; that, as despotism is striving to spread its raven wing\r\nover the earth, freedom must strengthen itself for the protection of the\r\nliberties of the world; that while three millions of Africans, only, are\r\nheld to involuntary servitude for a time, to sustain the system of free\r\ntrade, the freedom of hundreds of millions is involved in the\r\npreservation of the American Constitution; and that, as African\r\nemancipation, in every experiment made, has thrown a dead weight upon\r\nAnglo-Saxon progress, the colored people must wait a little, until the\r\ngeneral battle for the liberties of the civilized nations is gained,\r\nbefore the universal elevation of the barbarous tribes can be achieved.\r\nThis work, it is true, has been commenced at various outposts in\r\nheathendom, by the missionary, but is impeded by numberless hindrances;\r\nand these obstacles to the progress of Christian civilization, doubtless\r\nwill continue, until the friends of civil and religious liberty shall\r\ntriumph in nominally Christian countries; and, with the wealth of the\r\nnations at command, instead of applying it to purposes of war, shall\r\ndevote it to sweeping away the darkness of superstition and barbarism\r\nfrom the earth, by extending the knowledge of science and revelation to\r\nall the families of man.\r\n\r\nBut we must hasten.\r\n\r\nThere are none who will deny the truth of what is said of the present\r\nstrength and influence of slavery, however much they may have deprecated\r\nits acquisition of power. There are none who think it practicable to\r\nassail it, successfully, by political action, in the States where it is\r\nalready established by law. The struggle against the system, therefore,\r\nis narrowed down to an effort to prevent its extension into territory\r\nnow free; and this contest is limited to the people who settle the\r\nterritories. The question is thus taken out of the hands of the people\r\nat large, and they are cut off from all control of slavery both in the\r\nStates and Territories. Hence it is, that the American people are\r\nconsidering the propriety of banishing this distracting question from\r\nnational politics, and demanding of their statesmen that there shall no\r\nlonger be any delay in the adoption of measures to sustain the\r\nConstitution and laws of our glorious Union, against all its enemies,\r\nwhether domestic or foreign.\r\n\r\nThe policy of adopting this course, may be liable to objection; but it\r\ndoes not appear to arise from any disposition to prove recreant to the\r\ncause of philanthropy, that a large portion of the people of the free\r\nStates are desirous of divorcing the slavery question from all\r\nconnection with political movements. It is because they now find\r\nthemselves wholly powerless, as did the colonizationists, forty years\r\nsince, in regard to emancipation, and are thus forced into a position of\r\nneutrality on that subject.\r\n\r\nA word on this point. The friends of colonization, in the outset of that\r\nenterprise, found themselves shut up to the necessity of creating a\r\nRepublic on the shores of Africa, as the only hope for the free colored\r\npeople--the further emancipation of the slaves, by State action, having\r\nbecome impracticable. After nearly forty years of experimenting with the\r\nfree colored people, by others, colonizationists still find themselves\r\ncircumscribed in their operations, to their original design of building\r\nup the Republic of Liberia, as the only rational hope of the elevation\r\nof the African race--the prospects of general emancipation being a\r\nthousand-fold more gloomy in 1859 than they were in 1817.\r\n\r\nAbolitionists, themselves, now admit that slavery completely controls\r\nall national legislation. This is equivalent to admitting that all their\r\nschemes for its overthrow have failed. Theodore Parker, of Boston, in a\r\nsermon before his congregation, recently, is reported as having made the\r\nfollowing declaration: \"I have been preaching to you in this city for\r\nten years; and beside the multitudes addressed here, I have addressed a\r\nhundred thousand annually in excursions through the country; and in that\r\ntime the area of slavery has increased a hundred fold.\" Gerrit Smith, in\r\nhis late speech in Congress, said, that cotton is now the dominant\r\ninterest of the country, and sways Church, and State, and commerce, and\r\ncompels all of them to go for slavery. Mr. Sumner, in his thrice\r\nrepeated lecture, in New York, in May, 1855, declared, that,\r\n\"notwithstanding all its excess of numbers, wealth, and intelligence,\r\nthe North is now the vassal of an oligarchy, whose single inspiration\r\ncomes from slavery.\". . . . . It \"now dominates over the Republic,\r\ndetermines its national policy, disposes of its offices, and sways all\r\nto its absolute will.\" . . . . \"In maintaining its power, the slave\r\noligarchy has applied a new test for office\"--. . . . \"Is he faithful to\r\nslavery?\" . . . . \"With arrogant ostracism, it excludes from every\r\nnational office all who can not respond to this test.\" Hon. L. D.\r\nCampbell, in a letter to the Cincinnati Convention of Colored Freemen,\r\nJanuary 5, 1852, said: \"I regard the _present position_ of your race in\r\nthis country as infinitely worse than it was ten years ago. The States\r\nwhich were _then_ preparing for gradual emancipation, are _now_\r\nendeavoring to extend, perpetuate, and strengthen slavery! . . . . A\r\nvast amount of territory which was _then_ free is _now_ everlastingly\r\ndedicated to slavery. . . . . From the lights of the past, I confess,\r\nI see nothing to justify a promise of much to your _future prospects_.\"\r\n\r\nThat these gentlemen state a great truth, as to the present position of\r\nthe slavery question, and the darkening prospects of emancipation, will\r\nbe denied by no man of intelligence and candor. Doubtless, a certain\r\nclass of politicians, because of the present dearth of political\r\ncapital, of any other kind, will continue to agitate this subject. But,\r\nsooner or later, it must take the form we have stated, and become a\r\nquestion of minor importance in politics. This result is inevitable,\r\nbecause the people at large are beginning to realize their want of power\r\nover the institution of slavery, and the futility of any measures\r\nhitherto adopted to arrest its progress, and elevate the free colored\r\npeople on terms of equality among the whites.\r\n\r\nBut, I am told that the North has recently achieved a great victory over\r\nthe South, in the election of Mr. Banks, as Speaker.[48] Time was when\r\nsuch a result would have been considered far otherwise than a Northern\r\ntriumph. Mr. Banks is an ultra free trade man, and his sentiments will\r\nassuredly work no ill to the commercial interests of the South. His\r\nelection provoked no threats of secession. What, then, has been gained\r\nto the North, in the wild excitement consequent upon the controversy\r\nrelative to the Speakership? The opponents of slavery are further than\r\never from accomplishing any thing practicable in checking the demand for\r\nthe great staple of the South. Cotton is King still.\r\n\r\nIn such a crisis as this, shall the friends of the Union be rebuked, if\r\nthey determine to take a position of neutrality, in politics, on the\r\nsubject of slavery; while, at the same time, they offer to guarantee the\r\nfree colored people a Republic of their own, where they may equal other\r\nraces, and aid in redeeming a Continent from the woes it has suffered\r\nfor thousands of years!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] The progressive increase is indicated by the following figures:\r\n\r\n                            =1820.=       =1830.=     =1840.=       =1853.=\r\n  Total slaves\r\n     in United States,     1,538,098    2,009,043    2,487,356      3,296,408\r\n  Cotton exported, lbs., 127,800,000  298,459,102  743,941,061  1,111,570,370\r\n  Average export to\r\n    each slave, lbs.,            83           143          295            337\r\n\r\n[48] The remarks in this chapter remain as they were in the first\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL, SOCIAL, AND MORAL CONDITION OF THE FREE PEOPLE OF COLOR\r\nIN THE BRITISH COLONIES, HAYTI, AND IN THE UNITED STATES; AND THE\r\nINFLUENCE THEY HAVE EXERTED ON PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN RELATION TO SLAVERY,\r\nAND TO THEIR OWN PROSPECTS OF EQUALITY WITH THE WHITES.\r\n\r\n          Effects of opposition to Colonization on\r\n          Liberia--Its effects on free colored people--Their\r\n          social and moral condition--Abolition testimony on\r\n          the subject--American Missionary Association--Its\r\n          failure in Canada--Degradation of West India free\r\n          colored people--American and Foreign Anti-Slavery\r\n          Society--Its testimony on the dismal condition of\r\n          West India free negroes--London Times on same\r\n          subject--Mr. Bigelow on same subject--Effect of\r\n          results in West Indies on Emancipation--Opinion of\r\n          Southern Planters--Economical failure of West\r\n          India Emancipation--Ruinous to British\r\n          Commerce--Similar results in Hayti--Extent of\r\n          diminution of exports from West Indies resulting\r\n          from Emancipation--Results favorable to American\r\n          Planter--Moral condition of Hayti--Later facts in\r\n          reference to the West Indies--Negro free labor a\r\n          failure--Necessity of education to render freedom\r\n          of value--Franklin's opinion\r\n          confirmed--Colonization essential to promote\r\n          Emancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have noticed the social and moral condition of the free colored\r\npeople, from the days of Franklin, to the projection of colonization. We\r\nhave also glanced at the main facts in relation to the abolition warfare\r\nupon colonization, and its success in paralyzing the enterprise. This\r\nsubject demands a more extended notice. The most serious injury from\r\nthis hostility, sustained by the cause of colonization, was the\r\nprejudice created, in the minds of the more intelligent free colored\r\nmen, against emigration to Liberia. The Colonization Society had\r\nexpressed its belief in the natural equality of the blacks and whites;\r\nand that there were a sufficient number of educated, upright, free\r\ncolored men, in the United States, to establish and sustain a Republic\r\non the coast of Africa, \"whose citizens, rising rapidly in the scale of\r\nexistence, under the stimulants to noble effort by which they would be\r\nsurrounded, might soon become equal to the people of Europe, or of\r\nEuropean origin--so long their masters and oppressors.\" These were the\r\nsentiments of the first Report of the Colonization Society, and often\r\nrepeated since. Its appeals were made to the moral and intelligent of\r\nthe free colored people; and, with their co-operation, the success of\r\nits scheme was considered certain. But the very persons needed to lead\r\nthe enterprise, were, mostly, persuaded to reject the proffered aid, and\r\nthe society was left to prosecute its plans with such materials as\r\noffered. In consequence of this opposition, it was greatly embarrassed,\r\nand made less progress in its work of African redemption, than it must\r\nhave done under other circumstances. Had three-fourths of its emigrants\r\nbeen the enlightened, free colored men of the country, a dozen Liberias\r\nmight now gird the coast of Africa, where but one exists; and the slave\r\ntrader be entirely excluded from its shores. Doubtless, a wise\r\nProvidence has governed here, as in other human affairs, and may have\r\npermitted this result, to show how speedily even semi-civilized men can\r\nbe elevated under American Protestant free institutions. The great body\r\nof emigrants to Liberia, and nearly all the leading men who have sprung\r\nup in the colony, and contributed most to the formation of the Republic,\r\nwent out from the very midst of slavery; and yet, what encouraging\r\nresults! It has been a sad mistake to oppose colonization, and thus to\r\nretard Africa's redemption!\r\n\r\nBut how has it fared with the free colored people elsewhere? The answer\r\nto this question will be the solution of the inquiry, What has\r\nabolitionism accomplished by its hostility to colonization, and what is\r\nthe condition of the free colored people, whose interests it volunteered\r\nto promote, and whose destinies it attempted to control?\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists themselves shall answer this question. The colored\r\npeople shall see what kind of commendations their tutors give them, and\r\nwhat the world is to think of them, on the testimony of their particular\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of a colored population in Canada, is the work of\r\nAmerican abolitionists. _The American Missionary Association_, is their\r\norgan for the spread of a gospel untainted, it is claimed, by contact\r\nwith slavery. Out of four stations under its care in Canada, at the\r\nopening of 1853, but one school, that of Miss Lyon, remained at its\r\nclose. All the others were abandoned, and all the missionaries had asked\r\nto be released,[49] as we are informed by its Seventh Annual Report,\r\nchiefly for the reasons stated in the following extract, page 49:\r\n\r\n\"The number of missionaries and teachers in Canada, with which the year\r\ncommenced, has been greatly reduced. Early in the year, Mr. Kirkland\r\nwrote to the committee, that the opposition to white missionaries,\r\nmanifested by the colored people of Canada, had so greatly increased, by\r\nthe interested misrepresentations of ignorant colored men, pretending to\r\nbe ministers of the gospel, that he thought his own and his wife's\r\nlabors, and the funds of the association, could be better employed\r\nelsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nThis Mission seems never to have been in a prosperous condition. Passing\r\nover to the Eleventh Annual Report, 1857, it is found that the\r\nAssociation had then but one missionary, the Rev. David Hotchkiss, in\r\nthat field. In relation to his prospects, the Report says:\r\n\r\n\"It has, however, happened to him, as it frequently did to Paul and his\r\nfellow-laborers, that his faithfulness and his success have been the\r\noccasion of stirring up certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, so that\r\nat one time it was thought by some lookers-on that his life was in\r\ndanger, and that he might be compelled to leave the scene of his present\r\nlabors.\" He had succeeded, however, in gathering a church of 28 members,\r\nbut \"on the 21st of June, the house in which the little church worshiped\r\nwas burned to the ground. This was undoubtedly the work of an\r\nincendiary, as there had been no fire in it for more than two weeks.\r\nThreats now were freely used against Mr. Hotchkiss and the church, but\r\nhe continued his labors, and procured another house, and had it fitted\r\nup for worship. On the 24th of August, this also was burned down. They\r\nhave since had to meet in private houses, and much doubt has been felt\r\nrelative to ultimate duty. At later dates, however, the opposition was\r\nmore quiet, and hopes revived. This field is emphatically a hard one,\r\nand requires much faith and patience from those who labor there.\"[50]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of August, 1858, Mr. Hotchkiss writes: \"My wife's school is\r\nin a prosperous condition. She has had nearly forty scholars, and they\r\nlearn well. There are numbers who can not come to school for want of\r\nsuitable clothing. They are nearly naked.\"[51]\r\n\r\nOn a late occasion it is remarked, that \"this society seems to meet with\r\nthe trouble which accompanies the efforts of other missionary societies\r\nin their endeavors to 'to seek and to save that which was lost.' They\r\nsay they find it 'extremely difficult to win the confidence of the\r\ncolored people of Canada.'\"[52]\r\n\r\nBut we have a picture of a different kind to present, and one that\r\nproves the capacity of the free colored people for improvement--not when\r\nrunning at large and uncared for, but when subjected to wholesome\r\nrestraint. This is as essential to the progress of the blacks as the\r\nwhites, while they are in the course of intellectual, moral and\r\nindustrial training:\r\n\r\n\"Some years ago the Rev. William King, a slave owner in Louisiana,\r\nmanumitted his slaves and removed them to Canada. They now, with others,\r\noccupy a tract of land at Buxton and the vicinity, called the Elgin\r\nBlock, where Mr. King is stationed as a Presbyterian missionary.\r\n\r\n\"A recent general meeting there was attended by Lord Althorp, son of\r\nEarl Spencer, and J. W. Probyn, Esq., both members of the British\r\nParliament, who made addresses. The whole educational and moral\r\nmachinery is worked by the presiding genius of the Rev. W. King, to whom\r\nthe entire settlement are under felt and acknowledged obligations. He\r\nteaches them agriculture and industry. He superintends their education,\r\nand preaches on the Lord's day. He regards the experiment as highly\r\nsuccessful.\"[53]\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to multiply testimony on this subject, but simply\r\nto afford an index to the condition of the colored people, as described\r\nby abolition pens, best known to the public. We turn, therefore, from\r\nthe British colonies in the North, to her possessions in the Tropics.\r\n\r\nWest India emancipation, under the guidance of English abolitionists,\r\nhas always been viewed as the grand experiment, which was to convince\r\nthe world of the capacity of the colored man to rise, side by side, with\r\nthe white man. We shall let the friends of the system, and the public\r\ndocuments of the British Government, testify as to its results, both\r\nmorally and economically. Opening, again, the Seventh Annual Report of\r\nthe _American Missionary Association_, page 30, where it speaks of their\r\nmoral condition, we find it written:\r\n\r\n\"One of our missionaries, in giving a description of the moral condition\r\nof the people of Jamaica, after speaking of the licentiousness which\r\nthey received as a legacy from those who denied them the pure joys of\r\nholy wedlock, and trampled upon and scourged chastity, as if it were a\r\nfiend to be driven out from among men--that enduring legacy, which, with\r\nits foul, pestilential influence, still blights, like the mildew of\r\ndeath, every thing in society that should be lovely, virtuous, and of\r\ngood report; and alluding to their intemperance, in which they have\r\nfollowed the example set by the governor in his palace, the bishop in\r\nhis robes, statesmen and judges, lawyers and doctors, planters and\r\noverseers, and even professedly Christian ministers; and the deceit and\r\nfalsehood which oppression and wrong always engender, says: 'It must not\r\nbe forgotten that we are following in the wake of the accursed system of\r\n_slavery_--a system that _unmakes man_, by warring upon his conscience,\r\nand crushing his spirit, leaving naught but the shattered wrecks of\r\nhumanity behind it. If we may but gather up some of these floating\r\nfragments, from which the image of God is well nigh effaced, and pilot\r\nthem safely into that better land, we shall not have labored in vain.\r\nBut we may _hope to do more_. The chief fruit of our labors is to be\r\nsought in the _future_, rather than in the _present_.' It should be\r\nremembered, too, (continues the Report,) that there is but a small part\r\nof the population yet brought within the reach of the influence of\r\nenlightened Christian teachers, while the great mass by whom they are\r\nsurrounded are but little removed from actual heathenism.\" Another\r\nmissionary, page 33, says, it is the opinion of all intelligent\r\nChristian men, that \"nothing save the furnishing of the people with\r\nample means of education and religious instruction will save them from\r\nrelapsing into a state of barbarism.\" And another, page 36, in speaking\r\nof certain cases of discipline, for the highest form of crime, under the\r\nseventh commandment, says: \"There is _nothing_ in public sentiment to\r\nsave the youth of Jamaica in this respect.\"\r\n\r\nThe missions of this Association, in Jamaica, differ scarcely a shade\r\nfrom those among the actual heathen. On this point, the Report, near its\r\nclose, says:\r\n\r\n\"For most of the adult population of Jamaica, the unhappy victims of\r\nlong years of oppression and degradation, our missionaries have great\r\nfear. Yet for even these there may be hope, even though with trembling.\r\nBut it is around the youth of the island that their brightest hopes and\r\nanticipations cluster; from them they expect to gather their principal\r\nsheaves for the great Lord of the harvest.\"\r\n\r\nThe _American Missionary_, a monthly paper, and organ of this\r\nAssociation, for July, 1855, has the following quotation from the\r\nletters of the missionaries, recently received. It is given, as\r\nabolition testimony, in further confirmation of the moral condition of\r\nthe colored people of Jamaica:\r\n\r\n\"From the number of churches and chapels in the island, Jamaica ought\r\ncertainly to be called a Christian land. The people may be called a\r\nchurch-going people. There are chapels and places of worship enough, at\r\nleast in this part of the island, to supply the people if every station\r\nof our mission were given up. And there is no lack of ministers and\r\npreachers. As far as I am acquainted, almost the entire adult population\r\nprofess to have a hope of eternal life, and I think the larger part are\r\nconnected with churches. In view of such facts some have been led to\r\nsay, 'The spiritual condition of the population is very satisfactory.'\r\nBut there is another class of facts that is perfectly astounding. With\r\nall this array of the externals of religion, one broad, deep wave of\r\nmoral death rolls over the land. A man may be a drunkard, a liar, a\r\nSabbath-breaker, a profane man, a fornicator, an adulterer, and such\r\nlike--and be known to be such--and go to chapel, and hold up his head\r\nthere, and feel no disgrace from these things, because they are so\r\ncommon as to create a public sentiment in his favor. He may go to the\r\ncommunion table, and cherish a hope of heaven, and not have his hope\r\ndisturbed. I might tell of persons guilty of some, if not all, these\r\nthings, ministering in holy things.\"\r\n\r\nWhat motives can prompt the American Missionary Association to cast such\r\nimputations upon the missions of the English and Scotch Churches, in\r\nJamaica, we leave to be determined by the parties interested. Few,\r\nindeed, will believe that the English and Scotch Churches would, for a\r\nmoment, tolerate such a condition of things, in their mission stations,\r\nas is here represented.\r\n\r\nNext we turn to the Annual Report of the American and Foreign\r\nAnti-Slavery Society, 1853, which discourses thus, in its own language,\r\nand in quotations which it indorses:[54]\r\n\r\n\"The friends of emancipation in the United States have been\r\ndisappointed in some respects at the results in the West Indies, because\r\nthey expected too much. A nation of slaves can not at once be converted\r\ninto a nation of intelligent, industrious, and moral freemen.\" . . . .\r\n\"It is not too much, even now, to say of the people of Jamaica, . . . .\r\ntheir condition is exceedingly degraded, their morals woefully corrupt.\r\nBut this must, by no means, be understood to be of universal\r\napplication. With respect to those who have been brought under a\r\nhealthful educational and religious influence, _it is not true_. But as\r\nrespects the great mass, whose humanity has been ground out of them by\r\ncruel oppression--whom no good Samaritan hand has yet reached--how could\r\nit be otherwise? We wish to turn the tables; to supplant oppression by\r\nrighteousness, insult by compassion and brotherly kindness, hatred and\r\ncontempt by love and winning meekness, till we allure these wretched\r\nones to the hope and enjoyment of manhood and virtue.\"[55] . . . . \"The\r\nmeans of education and religious instruction are better enjoyed,\r\nalthough but little appreciated and improved by the great mass of the\r\npeople. It is also true, that the moral sense of the people is becoming\r\nsomewhat enlightened. . . . . But while this is true, yet their moral\r\ncondition is very far from being what it ought to be. . . . . It is\r\nexceedingly dark and distressing. Licentiousness prevails to a most\r\nalarming extent among the people. . . . . The almost universal\r\nprevalence of intemperance is another prolific source of the moral\r\ndarkness and degradation of the people. The great mass, among all\r\nclasses of the inhabitants, from the governor in his palace to the\r\npeasant in his hut--from the bishop in his gown to the beggar in his\r\nrags--are all slaves to their cups.\"[56]\r\n\r\nThis is the language of American abolitionists, going out under the\r\nsanction of their Annual Reports. Lest it may be considered as too\r\nhighly colored, we add the following from the _London Times_, of near\r\nthe same date. In speaking of the results of emancipation, in Jamaica,\r\nit says:\r\n\r\n\"The negro has not acquired, with his freedom, any habits of industry or\r\nmorality. His independence is but little better than that of an\r\nuncaptured brute. Having accepted few of the restraints of civilization,\r\nhe is amenable to few of its necessities; and the wants of his nature\r\nare so easily satisfied, that at the present rate of wages, he is called\r\nupon for nothing but fitful or desultory exertion. The blacks,\r\ntherefore, instead of becoming intelligent husbandmen, have become\r\nvagrants and squatters, and it is now apprehended that with the failure\r\nof cultivation in the island will come the failure of its resources for\r\ninstructing or controlling its population. So imminent does this\r\nconsummation appear, that memorials have been signed by classes of\r\ncolonial society hitherto standing aloof from politics, and not only the\r\nbench and the bar, but the bishop, clergy, and ministers of all\r\ndenominations in the island, without exception, have recorded their\r\nconviction, that, in the absence of timely relief, the religious and\r\neducational institutions of the island must be abandoned, and the masses\r\nof the population retrogade to barbarism.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the editors of the _New York Evening Post_, Mr. Bigelow, a few\r\nyears since, spent a winter in Jamaica, and continues to watch, with\r\nanxious solicitude, as an anti-slavery man, the developments taking\r\nplace among its colored population. In reviewing the returns published\r\nby the Jamaica House of Assembly, in 1853, in reference to the ruinous\r\ndecline in the agriculture of the island, and stating the enormous\r\nquantity of lands thrown out of cultivation, since 1848, the _Post_\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"This decline has been going on from year to year, daily becoming more\r\nalarming, until at length the island has reached what would appear to be\r\nthe last profound of distress and misery, . . . . when thousands of\r\npeople do not know, when they rise in the morning, whence or in what\r\nmanner they are to procure bread for the day.\"\r\n\r\nWe must examine, more closely, the economical results of emancipation,\r\nin the West Indies, before we can judge of the effects, upon the trade\r\nand commerce of the world, which would result from general emancipation\r\nin the United States. We do this, not to afford an argument in behalf of\r\nthe perpetuation of slavery, because its abolition might injuriously\r\naffect the interests of trade and commerce; but because the whole of\r\nthese results have long been well known to the American planter, and\r\nserve as conclusive arguments, with him, against emancipation. He\r\nbelieves that, in tropical cultivation, African free labor is worthless;\r\nthat the liberation of the slaves in this country, must, necessarily, be\r\nfollowed with results similar to what has occurred in the West Indies;\r\nand, for this reason, as well as on account of the profitable character\r\nof slavery, he refuses to give freedom to his slaves. We repeat, we do\r\nnot cite the fact of the failure, economically, of free labor in\r\nJamaica, as an argument for the perpetuation of slavery. Not at all. We\r\nallude to the fact, only to show that emancipation has greatly reduced\r\nthe commerce of the colonies, and that the logic of this result\r\nmilitates against the colored man's prospects of advancement in the\r\nscale of political and social equality. But to the facts:\r\n\r\nThe British planters, up to 1806, had received from the slave traders an\r\nuninterrupted supply of laborers, and had rapidly extended their\r\ncultivation as commerce increased its demands for their products. Let us\r\ntake the results in Jamaica as an example of the whole of the British\r\nWest India islands. She had increased her exports of sugar from a yearly\r\naverage of 123,979,000 lbs. in 1772-3, to 234,700,000 lbs. in 1805-6. No\r\ndiminution of exports had occurred, as has been asserted by some\r\nanti-slavery writers, before the prohibition of the slave trade. The\r\nincrease was progressive and undisturbed, except so far as affected by\r\nseasons, more or less favorable. But no sooner was her supply of slaves\r\ncut off, by the act of 1806, which took effect in 1808, than the exports\r\nof Jamaica began to diminish, until her sugar had fallen off from 1822\r\nto 1832, to an annual average of 131,129,000 lbs., or nearly to what\r\nthey had been sixty years before. It was not until 1833 that the\r\nEmancipation Act was passed; so that this decline in the exports of\r\nJamaica, took place under all the rigors of West India slavery. The\r\nexports of rum, coffee, and cotton, were diminished in nearly the same\r\nratio.\r\n\r\nTo arrest this ruinous decline in the commercial prosperity of the\r\nislands, emancipation was adopted in 1833 and perfected in 1838. This\r\npolicy was pursued under the plea, that free labor is doubly as\r\nproductive as slave labor; and, that the negroes, liberated, would labor\r\ntwice as well as when enslaved. But what was the result? Ten years after\r\nfinal emancipation was effected, the exports of sugar from Jamaica were\r\nonly 67,539,200 lbs. a year, instead of 234,700,000 lbs., as in 1805-6.\r\nThe exports of coffee, during the same year, were reduced to 5,684,921\r\nlbs., instead of 23,625,377 lbs., as in 1805-6; and the extinction of\r\nthe cultivation of cotton, for export, had become almost complete,\r\nthough in 1800, it had nearly equaled that of the United States. These\r\nare no fancy sketches, drawn for effect, but sober realities, attested\r\nby the public documents of the British government.[57] The Jamaica\r\nnegro, ignorant and destitute of forethought, disappointed the English\r\nphilanthropists.\r\n\r\nIn Hayti, emancipation had been productive of results, fully as\r\ndisastrous to its commerce, as it had been to that of Jamaica. There was\r\nan almost total abandonment of the production of sugar, soon after\r\nfreedom was declared. This took place in 1793. In 1790 the island\r\nexported 163,318,810 lbs. of sugar. But in 1801 its export was reduced\r\nto 18,534,112 lbs., in 1818, to 5,443,765 lbs., and in 1825 to 2,020\r\nlbs.;[58] since which time its export has nearly ceased. Indeed, it is\r\nasserted, that, \"at this moment there is not one pound of sugar exported\r\nfrom the island, and all that is used is imported from the United\r\nStates.\"[59]\r\n\r\nThe exports of coffee, from Hayti, in 1790, were 76,835,219 lbs.; and of\r\ncotton, 7,004,274 lbs. But the exports of the former article, in 1801,\r\nwere reduced to 43,420,270 lbs., and the latter to 474,118 lbs.[60] The\r\nexports of coffee have varied, annually, since that period, from thirty\r\nto forty million pounds; and the cotton exported has rarely much\r\nexceeded one million pounds.[61] At present, \"with the exception of\r\nGonaives, there is not a pound of cotton produced, and only a very\r\nlimited quanity there, barely sufficient for consumption; and instead of\r\nexporting indigo, as formerly, they import all they use from the United\r\nStates.\"[62]\r\n\r\nAccording to the authorities before cited, the deficit of free labor\r\ntropical cultivation, as compared with that of slave labor, while\r\nsustained by the slave trade, including the British West Indies and\r\nHayti, stands as follows:--a startling result, truly, to those who\r\nexpected emancipation to work well for commerce, and supersede the\r\nnecessity of employing slave labor:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Contrast of Slave Labor and Free Labor Exports from the West Indies._\r\n\r\n  SLAVE LABOR.\r\n                                 _lbs.          _lbs.        _lbs.\r\n                     _Years._    Sugar._      Coffee._      Cotton._\r\n  British West Indies, 1807,  636,025,643    31,610,764   17,000,000[63]\r\n  Hayti,               1790,  163,318,810    76,835,219    7,286,126\r\n                              -----------   -----------   ----------\r\n     Total                    809,344,453   108,245,983   24,286,126\r\n\r\n  FREE LABOR.\r\n                                 _lbs.          _lbs.          _lbs.\r\n                     _Years._    Sugar._      Coffee._        Cotton._\r\n  British West Indies, 1848,   313,306,112    6,770,792       427,529[64]\r\n  Hayti                1848,   very little.  34,114,717[C]  1,591,454[65]\r\n                               -----------   ----------     ---------\r\n     Total                     313,306,112   40,885,509     2,018,983\r\n\r\n     Free Labor Deficit        496,038,341   67,360,474    22,267,143\r\n\r\nTo understand the bearing which this decrease of production, by free\r\nlabor, has upon the interests of the African race, it must be\r\nremembered, that the consumption of cotton and sugar has not diminished,\r\nbut increased, vastly; and that for every bale of cotton, or hogshead of\r\nsugar, that the free labor production is diminished, an equal amount of\r\nslave labor cotton and sugar is demanded to supply its place; and, more\r\nthan this, for every additional bale or hogshead required by their\r\nincreased consumption, an additional one must be furnished by slave\r\nlabor, because the world will not dispense with their use. As no\r\nmaterial change has occurred, for several years, in the commercial\r\ncondition of the islands, it is not necessary to bring this statement\r\ndown to a later date than 1848. The causes operating to encourage the\r\nAmerican planters, in extending their cultivation of cotton and sugar,\r\ncan now be understood.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the moral condition of Hayti, we need say but little. It\r\nis known that a great majority of the children of the island are born\r\nout of wedlock, and that the Christian Sabbath is the principal market\r\nday in the towns. The _American and Foreign Christian Union_, a\r\nmissionary paper of New York, after quoting the report of one of the\r\nmissionaries in Hayti, who represents his success as encouraging, thus\r\nremarks: \"This letter closes with some singular incidents not suitable\r\nfor publication, showing the deplorable state of community there, both\r\nmorally and socially. There seems to be a mixture of African barbarism\r\nwith the sensuous civilization of France. . . . . That dark land needs\r\nthe light which begins to dawn thereon.\"\r\n\r\nThus matters stood when the second edition of this work went to press.\r\nAn opportunity is now afforded, of embracing the results of emancipation\r\nto a later date, and of forming a better judgment of the effects of that\r\npolicy on the question of freedom in the United States. For, if the\r\nnegro, with full liberty, in the West Indies, has proved himself\r\nunreliable in voluntary labor, the experiment of freeing him here will\r\nnot be attempted by our slaveholders.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said, recently, about British emancipation, and the\r\nreturning commercial prosperity of her tropical islands. The American\r\nMissionary Association[66] gives currency to the assertion, that \"they\r\nyield more produce than they ever did during the existence of slavery.\"\r\nIt is said, also, in the _Edinburgh Review_, that existing facts \"show\r\nthat slavery was bearing our colonies down to ruin with awful speed;\r\nthat had it lasted but another half century, they must have sunk beyond\r\nrecovery. On the other hand, that now, under freedom and free trade,\r\nthey are growing day by day more rich and prosperous; with spreading\r\ntrade, with improving agriculture, with a more educated, industrious and\r\nvirtuous people; while the comfort of the quondam slaves is increased\r\nbeyond the power of words to portray.\"[67]\r\n\r\nNow all this seems very encouraging; but how such language can be used,\r\nwithout its being considered as flatly contradicting well known facts,\r\nand what the American Missionary Association, Mr. Bigelow, and others,\r\nhave heretofore said, will seem very mysterious to the reader. And yet,\r\nthe assertions quoted would seem to be proved, by taking the aggregate\r\nproduction of the whole British West India islands and Mauritius, as the\r\nindex to their commercial prosperity. But if the islands be taken\r\nseparately, and all the facts considered, a widely different conclusion\r\nwould be formed, by every candid man, than that the improvement is due\r\nto the increased industry of the negroes. On this subject the facts can\r\nbe drawn from authorities which would scorn to conceal the truth with\r\nthe design of sustaining a theory of the philanthropist. This question\r\nis placed in its true light by the _London Economist_, July 16, 1859, in\r\nwhich it is shown that the apparent industrial advancement of the\r\nislands is due to the importation of immigrants from India, China, and\r\nAfrica, by the \"coolie traffic,\" and not to the improved industry of the\r\nemancipated negroes. Says the _Economist_:\r\n\r\n\"We find one of the Emigration Commissioners, Mr. Murdock,[68] in an\r\ninteresting memorandum on this subject, giving us the following\r\ncomparison between the islands which have been recently supplied with\r\nimmigrants, and those which have not:\r\n\r\n                              _Sugar, pounds.

The last\r\n               The three years after         three years._\r\n                 apprenticeship._[69]\r\n\r\n  Jamaica          202,973,568               139,369,776\r\n  Antigua           63,824,656                70,302,736\r\n\r\nHere, now, is presented the key to the mystery overhanging the British\r\nWest Indies. Men, high in station, have asserted that West India\r\nemancipation has been an economic success; while others, equally\r\nhonorable, have maintained the opposite view. Both have presented\r\nfigures, averred to be true, that seemed to sustain their declarations.\r\nThis apparent contradiction is thus explained. The first take the\r\naggregate production in the whole of the islands, which, they say,\r\nexceeds that during the existence of slavery;[70] the second take the\r\nproduction in Jamaica alone, as representing the whole; and, thus, the\r\nstartling fact appears, that the sugar crop of the last three years in\r\nJamaica, has fallen 63,603,000 lbs., below what it was during the first\r\nthree years of freedom. This argues badly for the free negroes; but it\r\nmust be the legitimate fruits of emancipation, as no exterior force has\r\nbeen brought into that island to interfere, materially, with its\r\nworkings. In Mauritius, Trinidad, and British Guiana, it will be seen\r\nthat the production has greatly increased; but from a very different\r\ncause than any improvement in the industry of the blacks who had\r\nreceived their freedom--the increase in Mauritius having been more than\r\ndouble what it had been when the production depended upon them. The\r\nsugar crop, in this island, for the three years preceding the\r\nintroduction of immigrant labor, was but 217,200,000 lbs.; while, during\r\nthe last three years, by the aid of 210,000 immigrants, it has been run\r\nup to 469,812,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nTaking all these facts into consideration, it is apparent that West\r\nIndia emancipation has been a failure, economically considered. The\r\nproduction in Jamaica, when it has depended upon the labor of the free\r\nblacks alone, has materially declined in some of the islands, since the\r\nabandonment of slavery, and is not so great now as it was during the\r\nfirst years of freedom; and, so far is it from being equal to what it\r\nwas while slavery prevailed, and especially while the slave trade was\r\ncontinued, that it now falls short of the production of that period by\r\nan immense amount. In no way, therefore, can it be claimed, that the\r\ncultivation of the British West India islands is on the increase, except\r\nby resorting to the pious fraud of crediting the products of the\r\nimmigrant labor to the account of emancipation--a resort to which no\r\nconscientious Christian man will have recourse, even to sustain a\r\nphilanthropic theory.\r\n\r\nBut the Island of Barbadoes is an exception. It is said to have suffered\r\nno diminution in its production since emancipation, and that this result\r\nwas attained without the aid of immigrant labor. The _London Economist_\r\nmust be permitted to explain this phenomenon; and must also be allowed\r\nto give its views on the subject of the effects of emancipation, after\r\nthe lapse of a quarter of a century from the date of the passage of the\r\nEmancipation Act:\r\n\r\n\"We are no believers in Mr. Carlyle's gospel of the 'beneficent whip' as\r\nthe bearer of salvation to tropical indolence. But we can not for a\r\nmoment doubt that the first result of emancipation was, in most of the\r\nislands, to substitute for the worst kind of moral and political evil,\r\none of a less fatal but still of a very pernicious kind. The negroes had\r\nbeen treated as mere machines for raising sugar and coffee. They were\r\nsuddenly liberated from that mechanical drudgery; they became free\r\nbeings--but without the discipline needful to use freedom well, and\r\nunfortunately with a larger amount of practical freedom than the\r\nlaboring class of any Northern or temperate climate could by any\r\npossibility enjoy. They suddenly found themselves, in most of the\r\nislands, in a position in many respects analagous to that of a people\r\npossessed of a moderate property in England, who can supply their\r\nprincipal wants without any positive labor, and have no ambition to rise\r\ninto any higher sphere than that into which they were born. The only\r\ndifference was, that the negroes in most of the West India islands\r\nwanted vastly less than such people as these in civilized\r\nStates,--wanted nothing in fact, but the plantains they could grow\r\nalmost without labor, and the huts which they could build on any waste\r\nmountain land without paying rent for it. The consequence naturally was,\r\nthat when the spur of physical tyranny was removed, there was no\r\nsufficient substitute for it, in most of the islands, in the wholesome\r\nhardships of natural exigencies. The really beneficent 'whip' of hunger\r\nand cold was not substituted for the human cruelty from which they had\r\nescaped. In Barbadoes alone, perhaps, the pressure of a dense\r\npopulation, with the absence of any waste mountain lands on which the\r\nnegroes could squat, rent free, was an efficient substitute for the\r\nterrors of slavery. And, consequently, in Barbadoes alone, has the\r\nEmancipation Act produced unalloyed and conspicuous good. The natural\r\nspur of competition for the means of living, took the place there of the\r\nartificial spur of slavery, and the slow, indolent temperament of the\r\nAfrican race was thus quickened into a voluntary industry essential to\r\nits moral discipline, and most favorable to its intellectual culture.\"\r\n\r\nIn further commenting on the figures quoted, the _Economist_ remarks:\r\n\r\n\"These results, do not of course, necessarily represent in any degree\r\nthe fresh spur to diligence on the part of the old population, caused by\r\nthe new labor. In islands like Trinidad, where the amount of unredeemed\r\nland suited for such production is almost unlimited, the new labor\r\nintroduced cannot for a long time press on the old labor at all. But\r\nwherever the amount of land fitted for this kind of culture is nearly\r\nexhausted, the presence of the new competition will soon be felt. And,\r\nin any case, it is only through this gradual supply of the labor market\r\nthat we can hope to bring the wholesome spur of necessity to act\r\neventually on the laboring classes. Englishmen, indeed, may well think\r\nthat at times the good influences of this competitive jostling for\r\nemployment are overrated and its evil underrated. But this is far from\r\ntrue of the negro race. To their slow and unambitious temperament,\r\ninfluences of this kind are almost unalloyed good, as the great\r\nsuperiority in the population of Barbadoes to that of the other islands\r\nsufficiently shows.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Economist_, in further discussing this question, favors the\r\nintroduction of a permanent class of laborers, not only that the\r\ncultivation may be increased, but because there is \"no doubt at all that\r\nif a larger supply of labor could be attained in the West Indies,\r\nwithout any very great incidental evils, the benefit experienced even by\r\nthe planters would be by no means so great as that of the negro\r\npopulation themselves;\" and thinks that \"the philanthropic party, in\r\ntheir tenderness for the emancipated Africans, are sometimes not a\r\nlittle blind to the advantages of stern industrial necessities;\" and\r\nthat, \"what the accident of population and soil has done for Barbadoes,\r\nit cannot be doubted that a stream of immigration, if properly\r\nconducted, might do in some degree for the other islands.\"\r\n\r\nLest it should be thought that the _Economist_ stands alone in its\r\nrepresentations in relation to the failure of negro free labor in\r\nJamaica, we quote a statement of the Colonial Minister, which recently\r\nappeared in the _New York Tribune_, and was thence transferred to the\r\n_American Missionary_, February, 1859:\r\n\r\n\"The Colonial Minister says: 'Jamaica is now the only important sugar\r\nproducing colony which exports a considerable smaller quantity of sugar\r\nthan was exported in the time of slavery, while some such colonies since\r\nthe passage of the Emancipation Act have largely increased their\r\nproduct.'\"\r\n\r\nTime is thus casting light upon the question of the capacity of the\r\nAfrican race for voluntary labor. Jamaica included 311,692 negroes, at\r\nthe time of emancipation, out of the 660,000 who received their freedom\r\nin the whole of the West Indian islands. This was but little less than\r\nhalf of the whole number. It was a fair field to test the question of\r\nthe willingness of the free negro to work. But what is the result? We\r\nhave it admitted by both the _Economist_ and the Colonial Minister, that\r\nthere has been a vast falling off in the exports from Jamaica, and that\r\na spur of some kind must be applied to secure their adopting habits of\r\nindustry. The spur of the \"whip\" having been thrown away, the remedy\r\nproposed is to press them into a corner, by immigration from India and\r\nChina, so that the securing of bread shall become the great necessity\r\nwith them, and they be compelled to labor or starve, as has been the\r\ncase in Barbadoes. This is the opinion of the _Economist_, always\r\nopposed to slavery, but now convinced that the \"slow, indolent\r\ntemperament of the African race\" needs such a \"spur\" to quicken it \"into\r\na voluntary industry essential to its moral discipline, and most\r\nfavorable to its intellectual culture.\"\r\n\r\nThe West India emancipation experiments have demonstrated the truth of a\r\nfew principles that the world should fully understand. It must now be\r\nadmitted that mere personal liberty, even connected with the stimulus of\r\nwages, is insufficient to secure the industry of an ignorant population.\r\nIt is intelligence, alone, that can be acted upon by such motives.\r\nIntelligence, then, must precede voluntary industry. And, hereafter,\r\nthat man, or nation, may find it difficult to command respect, or\r\nsucceed in being esteemed wise, who will not, along with exertions to\r\nextend personal freedom to man, intimately blend with their efforts\r\nadequate means for intellectual and moral improvement. The results of\r\nWest India emancipation, it must be further noticed, fully confirm the\r\nopinions of Franklin, that freedom, to unenlightened slaves, must be\r\naccompanied with the means of intellectual and moral elevation,\r\notherwise it may be productive of serious evils to themselves and to\r\nsociety. It also sustains the views entertained by Southern\r\nslaveholders, that emancipation, unaccompanied by the colonization of\r\nthe slaves, could be of little value to the blacks, while it would\r\nentail a ruinous burden upon the whites. These facts must not be\r\noverlooked in the projection of plans for emancipation, as none can\r\nreceive the sanction of Southern men, which does not embrace in it the\r\nremoval of the colored people. With the example of West India\r\nemancipation before them, and the results of which have been closely\r\nwatched by them, it can not be expected that Southern statesmen will\r\never risk the liberation of their slaves, except on these conditions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[49] Mr. Wilson, the Missionary at St. Catharines, still remained there,\r\nbut not under the care of the Association.\r\n\r\n[50] 11th Annual Report, pages 36, 37.\r\n\r\n[51] _American Missionary_, October, 1858.\r\n\r\n[52] _African Repository_, October, 1859.\r\n\r\n[53] _African Repository_, January, 1858.\r\n\r\n[54] Page 170.\r\n\r\n[55] Extract from the report of a missionary, quoted in the Report, page\r\n172.\r\n\r\n[56] Extract from the report of another missionary, page 171, of the\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n[57] The average exports from the Island of Jamaica, omitting cotton,\r\nduring the three epochs referred to--that of the slave trade, of slavery\r\nalone, and of freedom--for periods of five years, during the first two,\r\nand for the three years separately, in the last, will give a full view\r\nof this point:\r\n\r\n  _Years of Exports._               _lbs.

They have been\r\nunder the guardianship of their abolition friends, ever since that\r\nperiod, and have cherished feelings of determined hostility to\r\ncolonization. What have they gained by this hostility? What has been\r\naccomplished for them by their abolition friends, or what have they done\r\nfor themselves? Those who took refuge in Liberia have built up a\r\nRepublic of their own; and with the view of encouraging them to laudable\r\neffort, have been recognized as an independent nation, by five of the\r\ngreat governments of the earth. But what has been the progress of those\r\nwho remained behind, in the vain hope of rising to an equality with the\r\nwhites, and of assisting in abolishing American slavery?\r\n\r\nWe offer no opinion, here, of our own, as to the present social and\r\nmoral condition of the free colored people in the North. What it was at\r\nthe time of the founding of Liberia, has already been shown. On this\r\nsubject we might quote largely from the proceedings of the Conventions\r\nof the colored people, and the writings of their editors, so as to\r\nproduce a dark picture indeed; but this would be cruel, as their voices\r\nare but the wailings of sensitive and benevolent hearts, while weeping\r\nover the moral desolations that, for ages, have overwhelmed their\r\npeople. Nor shall we multiply testimony on the subject; but in this, as\r\nin the case of Canada and the West Indies, allow the abolitionists to\r\nspeak of their own schemes. The Hon. Gerrit Smith, in his letter to\r\nGovernor Hunt, of New York, in 1852, while speaking of his ineffectual\r\nefforts, for fifteen years past, to prevail upon the free colored people\r\nto betake themselves to mechanical and agricultural pursuits, says:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose, moreover, that during all these fifteen years, they had been\r\nquitting the cities, _where the mass of them rot, both physically and\r\nmorally_, and had gone into the country to become farmers and\r\nmechanics--suppose, I say, all this--and who would have the hardihood to\r\naffirm that the Colonization Society lives upon the malignity of the\r\nwhites--but it is true that it lives upon _the voluntary degradation of\r\nthe blacks_. I do not say that the colored people are more debased than\r\nthe white people would be if persecuted, oppressed and outraged as are\r\nthe colored people. But I do say that they are debased, deeply debased;\r\nand that to recover themselves they must become heroes, self-denying\r\nheroes, capable of achieving a great moral victory--a two-fold\r\nvictory--a victory over themselves and a victory over their enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe _New York Tribune_, September 22, 1855, in noticing the movements of\r\nthe colored people of New York, to secure to themselves equal suffrage,\r\nthus gives utterance to its views of their moral condition:\r\n\r\n\"Most earnestly desiring the enfranchisement of the Afric-American race,\r\nwe would gladly wean them, at the cost of some additional ill-will, from\r\nthe sterile path of political agitation. They can help win their rights\r\nif they will, but not by jawing for them. One negro on a farm which he\r\nhas cleared or bought patiently hewing out a modest, toilsome\r\nindependence, is worth more to the cause of equal suffrage than three in\r\nan Ethiopian (or any other) convention, clamoring against white\r\noppression with all the fire of a Spartacus. It is not logical\r\nconviction of the justice of their claims that is needed, but a\r\nprevalent belief that they would form a wholesome and desirable element\r\nof the body politic. Their color exposes them to much unjust and\r\ndamaging prejudice; but if their degradation were but skin-deep, they\r\nmight easily overcome it. . . . . Of course, we understand that the evil\r\nwe contemplate is complex and retroactive--that the political degradation\r\nof the blacks is a cause as well as a consequence of their moral\r\ndebasement. Had they never been enslaved, they would not now be so\r\nabject in soul; had they not been so abject, they could not have been\r\nenslaved. Our aborigines might have been crushed into slavery by\r\noverwhelming force; but they could never have been made to live in it.\r\nThe black man who feels insulted in that he is called a 'nigger,'\r\ntherein attests the degradation of his race more forcibly than does the\r\nblackguard at whom he takes offense; for negro is no further a term of\r\nopprobrium than the character of the blacks has made it so. . . . . If\r\nthe blacks of to-day were all or mainly such men as Samuel R. Ward or\r\nFrederick Douglass, nobody would consider 'negro' an invidious or\r\nreproachful designation.\r\n\r\n\"The blacks of our State ought to enjoy the common rights of man; but\r\nthey stand greatly in need of the spirit in which those rights have been\r\nwon by other races. They will never win them as white men's barbers,\r\nwaiters, ostlers and boot blacks; that is to say, the tardy and\r\nungracious concession of the right of suffrage, which they may\r\nultimately wrench from a reluctant community, will leave them still the\r\npolitical as well as social inferiors of the whites--excluded from all\r\nhonorable office, and admitted to white men's tables only as waiters and\r\nplate-washers--unless they shall meantime have wrought out, through\r\ntoil, privation and suffering, an intellectual and essential\r\nenfranchisement. At present, white men dread to be known as friendly to\r\nthe black, because of the never-ending, still-beginning importunities to\r\nhelp this or that negro object of charity or philanthrophy to which such\r\na reputation inevitably subjects them. Nine-tenths of the free blacks\r\nhave no idea of setting themselves to work except as the hirelings and\r\nservitors of white men; no idea of building a church, or accomplishing\r\nany other serious enterprise, except through beggary of the whites. As a\r\nclass, the blacks are indolent, improvident, servile and licentious; and\r\ntheir inveterate habit of appealing to white benevolence or compassion\r\nwhenever they realize a want or encounter a difficulty, is eminently\r\nbaneful and enervating. If they could never more obtain a dollar until\r\nthey shall have earned it, many of them would suffer, and some perhaps\r\nstarve; but, on the whole, they would do better and improve faster than\r\nmay now be reasonably expected.\"\r\n\r\nIn tracing the causes which led to the organization of the American\r\nColonization Society, the statistics of the penitentiaries down to 1827,\r\nwere given, as affording an index to the moral condition of the free\r\ncolored people at that period. The facts of a similar kind, for 1850,\r\nare added here, to indicate their present moral condition. The\r\nstatistics are compiled from the Compendium of the Census of the United\r\nStates, for 1850, and published in 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tabular Statement of the number of the native and foreign white\r\npopulation, the colored population, the number of each class in the\r\nPenitentiaries, the proportion of the convicts to the whole number of\r\neach class, the proportion of colored convicts over the foreign and also\r\nover the native whites, in the four States named, for the year 1850:_\r\n\r\n  _Classes, etc._          _Mass._    _N.

It will be instructive,\r\nalso, to note the _moral condition_ of the free colored people in\r\nMassachusetts, the great center of abolitionism, where they have enjoyed\r\nequal rights ever since 1780. Strange to say, there is nearly three\r\ntimes as much among them, in that State, as exists among those of Ohio!\r\nMore than this will be useful to note, as it regards the direction of\r\nthe _emigration_ of the free colored people. Massachusetts, in 1850, had\r\nbut 2,687 colored persons born out of the State, while Ohio had 12,662\r\nborn out of her limits. Take another fact: the increase, _per cent._, of\r\nthe colored population, in the whole New England States, was, during the\r\nten years, from 1840 to 1850, but 1 71/100, while in Ohio, it was,\r\nduring that time, 45 76/100.\r\n\r\nThere is another point worthy of notice. Though the New England\r\nabolition States have offered equal political rights to the colored man,\r\nit has afforded him little temptation to emigrate into their bounds. On\r\nthe contrary, several of these States have been diminishing their free\r\ncolored population, for many years past, and none of them can have had\r\naccessions of colored immigrants; as is abundantly proved by the fact,\r\nthat their additions, of this class of persons, have not exceeded the\r\nnatural increase of the resident colored population.[71] Another fact is\r\nequally as instructive. It will be noted, that, in Ohio, the largest\r\nincrease of the free colored population, is in the anti-abolition\r\ncounties--the abolition counties, often, having increased very little,\r\nindeed, between 1840 and 1850. But the most curious fact is, that the\r\nlargest majorities for the abolition candidate for governor, in 1855,\r\nwere in the counties having the fewest colored people, while the largest\r\nmajorities against him, were in those having the largest numbers of free\r\nnegroes and mullatoes.[72] From these facts, both in regard to New\r\nEngland and Ohio, one of two conclusions may be logically deduced:\r\nEither the colored people find so little sympathy from the\r\nabolitionists, that they will not live among them; or else their\r\npresence, in any community, in large numbers, tends to cure the whites\r\nof all tendencies toward practical abolitionism!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[71] See Table IV, Appendix.\r\n\r\n[72] See Table V, Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nDisappointment of English and American Abolitionists--Their failure\r\nattributed to the inherent evils of Slavery--Their want of\r\ndiscrimination--The differences in the system in the British Colonies\r\nand in the United States--Colored people of United States vastly in\r\nadvance of all others--Success of the Gospel among the Slaves--_Democratic\r\nReview_ on African civilization--Vexation of Abolitionists at their\r\nfailure--Their apology not to be accepted--Liberia attests its\r\nfalsity--The barrier to the colored man's elevation removable only by\r\nColonization--Colored men begin to see it--Chambers, of Edinburgh--His\r\ntestimony on the crushing effects of New England's treatment of colored\r\npeople--Charges Abolitionists with insincerity--Approves\r\nColonization--Abolition violence rebuked by an English clergyman.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of the free colored people can now be understood. The\r\nresults, in their case, are vastly different from what was anticipated,\r\nwhen British philanthropists succeeded in West India emancipation. They\r\nare very different, also, from what was expected by American\r\nabolitionists: so different, indeed, that their disappointment is fully\r\nmanifested, in the extracts made from their published documents. As an\r\napology for the failure, it seems to be their aim to create the belief,\r\nthat the dreadful moral depravation, existing in the West Indies, is\r\nwholly owing to the demoralizing tendencies of slavery. They speak of\r\nthis effect as resulting from laws inherent in the system, which have no\r\nexceptions, and must be equally as active in the United States as in the\r\nBritish colonies. But in their zeal to cast odium on slavery, they prove\r\ntoo much--for, if this be true, it follows, that the slave population of\r\nthe United States must be equally debased with that of Jamaica, and as\r\nmuch disqualified to discharge the duties of freemen, as both have been\r\nsubjected to the operations of the same system. This is not all. The\r\nlogic of the argument would extend even to our free colored people, and\r\ninclude them, according to the American Missionary Association, in the\r\ndire effects of \"that enduring legacy which, with its foul, pestilential\r\ninfluences, still blights, like the mildew of death, every thing in\r\nsociety that should be lovely, virtuous, and of good report.\" Now, were\r\nit believed, generally, that the colored people of the United States are\r\nequally as degraded as those of Jamaica, upon what grounds could any one\r\nadvocate the admission of the blacks to equal social and political\r\nprivileges with the whites? Certainly, no Christian family or community\r\nwould willingly admit such men to terms of social or political equality!\r\nThis, we repeat, is the logical conclusion from the Reports of the\r\nAmerican Missionary Association and the American and Foreign\r\nAnti-Slavery Society--a conclusion, too, the more certain, as it makes\r\nno exceptions between the condition of the colored people under the\r\nslavery of Jamaica and under that of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut in this, as in much connected with slavery, abolitionists have taken\r\ntoo limited a view of the subject. They have not properly discriminated\r\nbetween the effects of the original barbarism of the negroes, and those\r\nproduced by the more or less favorable influences to which they were\r\nafterward subjected under slavery. This point deserves special notice.\r\nAccording to the best authorities, the colored people of Jamaica, for\r\nnearly three hundred years, were entirely without the gospel; and it\r\ngained a permanent footing among them, only at a few points, at their\r\nemancipation, twenty-five years ago; so that, when liberty reached them,\r\nthe great mass of the Africans, in the British West Indies, were\r\nheathen.[73] Let us understand the reason of this. Slavery is not an\r\nelement of human progress, under which the mind necessarily becomes\r\nenlightened; but Christianity is the _primary_ element of progress, and\r\ncan elevate the savage, whether in bondage or in freedom, if its\r\nprinciples are taught him in his youth. The slavery of Jamaica began\r\nwith savage men. For three hundred years, its slaves were destitute of\r\nthe gospel, and their barbarism was left to perpetuate itself. But in\r\nthe United States, the Africans were brought under the influence of\r\nChristianity, on their first introduction, over two hundred and thirty\r\nyears since, and have continued to enjoy its teachings, in a greater or\r\nless degree, to the present moment. The disappearance from among our\r\ncolored people, of the savage condition of the human mind--the\r\nincapacity to comprehend religious truths--and its continued existence\r\namong those of Jamaica, can now be understood. The opportunities enjoyed\r\nby the former, for advancement, over the latter, have been _six_ to\r\n_one_. With these facts before the mind, it is not difficult to perceive\r\nthat the colored population of Jamaica can not but still labor under\r\nthe disadvantages of hereditary barbarism and involuntary servitude,\r\nwith the superadded misfortune of being inadequately supplied with\r\nChristian instruction, along with their recent acquisition of freedom.\r\nBut while all this must be admitted, of the colored people of Jamaica,\r\nit is not true of those of our own country; for, long since, they have\r\ncast off the heathenism of their fathers, and have become enlightened in\r\na very encouraging degree. Hence it is, that the colored people of the\r\nUnited States, both bond and free, have made vastly greater progress,\r\nthan those of the British West Indies, in their knowledge of moral\r\nduties and the requirements of the gospel; and hence, too, it is, that\r\nGerrit Smith is right, in asserting that the demoralized condition of\r\nthe great mass of the free colored people, in our cities, is\r\ninexcusable, and deserving of the utmost reprobation, because it is\r\n_voluntary_--they knowing their duty but abandoning themselves to\r\ndegrading habits.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to another point of great moment. It will be denied by\r\nbut few--and by none maintaining the natural equality of the races--that\r\nthe free colored people of the United States are sufficiently\r\nenlightened, to be elevated by education, in an encouraging degree,\r\nwhere proper restraints from vice, and encouragements to virtue prevail.\r\nA large portion, even, of the slave population, are similarly\r\nenlightened. We speak not of the state of the morals of either class.\r\n\r\nAs the public are not well informed, in relation to the extent to which\r\nthe religious instruction of the slaves at the South prevails, the\r\nfollowing information will prove interesting, and show that a good work\r\nhas long been in progress, and has been producing its fruits:\r\n\r\n\"The South Carolina Methodist Conference have a missionary committee\r\ndevoted entirely to promoting the religious instruction of the slave\r\npopulation, which has been in existence twenty-six years. The Report[74]\r\nof the last year shows a greater degree of activity than is generally\r\nknown. They have twenty-six missionary stations in which thirty-two\r\nmissionaries are employed. The Report affirms that public opinion in\r\nSouth Carolina is decidedly in favor of the religious instruction of\r\nslaves, and that it has become far more general and systematic than\r\nformerly. It also claims a great degree of success to have attended the\r\nlabors of the missionaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Missionary Board, of the Louisiana Conference, of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, 1855, says:[75]\r\n\r\n\"It is stated upon good authority, that the number of colored members in\r\nthe Church South, exceeds that of the entire membership of all the\r\nProtestant missions in the world. What an enterprise is this committed\r\nto our care! The position we, of the Methodist Church South, have taken\r\nfor the African, has, to a great extent, cut us off from the sympathy of\r\nthe Christian Church throughout the world; and it behooves us to make\r\ngood this position in the sight of God, of angels, of men, of churches,\r\nand to our own consciences, by presenting before the throne of His glory\r\nmultitudes of the souls of these benighted ones abandoned to our care,\r\nas the seals of our ministry. Already Lousiana promises to be one vast\r\nplantation. Let us--we must gird ourselves for this Heaven-born\r\nenterprise of supplying the pure gospel to the slave. The great question\r\nis, How can the greatest number be preached to?--The building roadside\r\nchapels is as yet the best solution of it. In some cases planters build\r\nso as to accommodate adjoining plantations, and by this means the\r\npreacher addresses three hundred or more slaves, instead of one hundred\r\nor less. Economy of this kind is absolutely essential where the labor of\r\nthe missionary is so much needed and demanded.\r\n\r\n\"On the Lafourche and Bayou Black Missionwork, several chapels are in\r\nprocess of erection, upon a plan which enables the slave, as his master,\r\nto make an offering towards building a house of God. Instead of money,\r\nthe hands subscribe labor. Timber is plenty; many of the servants are\r\ncarpenters. Upon many of the plantations are saw mills. Here is much\r\nmaterial; what hindereth that we should build a church on every tenth\r\nplantation? Let us maintain our policy steadily. Time and diligence are\r\nrequired to effect substantial good, especially in this department of\r\nlabor. Let us continue to ask for buildings adapted to the worship of\r\nGod, and set apart; to urge, when practicable, the preaching to blacks\r\nin the presence of their masters, their overseers, and the neighbors\r\ngenerally.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the effects of the great revival among colored people has been\r\nthe establishment of a regular system of prayer-meetings for their\r\nbenefit. Meetings are held every night during the week at the tobacco\r\nfactories, the proprietors of which have been kind enough to place those\r\nedifices at the disposal of the colored brethren. The owners of the\r\nseveral factories preside over these meetings, and the most absolute\r\ngood conduct is exhibited.\"[76]\r\n\r\n\"In Newbern, N. C., the slaves have a large church of their own, which\r\nis well attended. They pay a salary of $500 per annum to their white\r\nminister. They have likewise a negro preacher in their employ, whom they\r\npurchased from his master.[77]\r\n\r\nAnd Newbern in this respect is not isolated. For in nearly every town of\r\nany size in the Southern States, the colored people have their churches,\r\nand what is more than is always known at the North, _they sustain their\r\nchurches and pay their ministers_,[78]\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, that the religious instruction of our _colored population_\r\nbe affectionately and earnestly commended to the ministry and eldership\r\nof our churches generally, as opening to us a field of most obligatory\r\nand interesting Christian effort, in which we are called to labor more\r\nfaithfully and fully, by our regard for our social interests, as well as\r\nby the higher considerations of duty to God and the souls of our fellow\r\nmen.[79]\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are copied from the _New York Observer_, of the\r\npresent year:\r\n\r\nThe Presbytery of Roanoke, Virginia, (O. S.) has addressed a Pastoral\r\nletter, on the instruction of the colored people, to the churches under\r\nits care, and ordered the same to be read in all the churches of the\r\nPresbytery, in those that are vacant, as well as where there are pastors\r\nor stated supplies. It commences by saying: \"Among the important\r\ninterests of the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which have claimed\r\nour special attention since the organization of the Presbytery in April\r\nlast,--that the work of the Lord may be vigorously and efficiently\r\ncarried forward within our bounds,--_the religious instruction of the\r\ncolored people_, is hardly to be placed second to any other.\" After\r\nspeaking of the obstacles and encouragements to the work, it gives the\r\nfollowing statistics:\r\n\r\n\"In the Presbytery of Charleston, S. C., 1637 out of 2889 members, or\r\nconsiderably over one-half, are colored. In the whole Synod of South\r\nCarolina, 5,009 out of 13,074, are colored members. The Presbyteries of\r\nMississippi and Central Mississippi, of Tuscaloosa and South Alabama, of\r\nGeorgia, of Concord, and Fayetteville, also show many churches with\r\nlarge proportions of colored communicants, from one-third to one-seventh\r\nof the whole. Our own Presbytery reports 276 out of 1737 members. In the\r\nwhole of the above mentioned bodies, there are 9,076 colored, out of\r\n33,667 communicants. Among the churches of these Presbyteries, we find\r\ntwenty with an aggregate colored membership of 3,600, or an average of\r\n130 to each. We find also, such large figures as these, 260, 333, 356,\r\n525! These facts speak for themselves and forbid discouragement.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the obligations to instruct this class, the letter says:\r\n\r\n\"But these people are _among_ us, at our doors, in our own fields, and\r\naround our firesides! If they need instruction, then the command of our\r\nLord, and every obligation of benevolence, call us to the work of\r\nteaching them, with all industry, the doctrines of Christ. The _first\r\nand kindest_ outgoings of our Christian compassion should be toward\r\nthem. They are not only near us, but are also entirely _dependent_ upon\r\nus. As to all means of securing religious privileges for themselves, and\r\nas to energy and self-directing power, they are but children,--forced to\r\nlook to their masters for every supply. From this arises an obligation,\r\nat once imperative, and of most solemn and momentous significance to us,\r\nto make thorough provision for their religious instruction, to the full\r\nextent that we are able to provide it for ourselves. This obligation\r\nacquires great additional force when it is further considered, that\r\nbesides proximity and dependence, they are indeed _members of our_\r\n'_households_.' As the three hundred and eighteen 'trained servants' of\r\nAbraham were 'born in his own house;' i. e., were born and bred as\r\nmembers of his _household_, so are our servants. Of course no argument\r\nis needed, to show that every man is bound by high and sacred\r\nobligations, for the discharge of which he must give account, to provide\r\nhis _family_ suitably, or to the extent of his ability, with the means\r\nof grace and salvation.\r\n\r\nAfter dwelling on the duties of the ministry, the letter goes on:\r\n\r\n\"But the work of Christianizing our colored population can never be\r\naccomplished by the labors of the ministry alone, unaided by the hearty\r\nco-operation of families, by carrying on a system of _home instruction_.\r\n_We must begin with the children._ For if the children of our servants\r\nbe left to themselves during their early years, this neglect must of\r\nnecessity beget two enormous evils. Evil habits will be rapidly acquired\r\nand strengthened; since if children are not learning good, they will be\r\nlearning what is bad. And having thus grown up both ignorant and\r\nvicious, they will have no inclination to go to the Lord's house; or if\r\nthey should go, their minds will be found so dark, so entirely\r\nunacquainted with the rudimental language and truths of the gospel, that\r\nmuch of the preaching must at first prove unintelligible, unprofitable\r\nat the time, and so uninteresting as to discourage further attendance.\r\nIn every regard, therefore, masters are bound to see that religious\r\ninstruction is provided at home for their people, especially for the\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\"If there be no other to undertake the work, (the mistress, or the\r\nchildren of the family,) the master is bound to deny himself and\r\ndischarge the duty. It is for him to see that the thing is properly\r\ndone; for the whole responsibility rests on him at last. It usually,\r\nhowever, devolves upon the mistress, or upon the younger members of the\r\nfamily, where there are children qualified for it, to perform this\r\nservice. Some of our young men, and, _to their praise be it spoken_,\r\nstill more of our young women, have willingly given themselves to this\r\nself-denying labor; in aid of their parents, or as a duty which they\r\nthemselves owe to Christ their Redeemer, and to their fellow creatures.\r\nWe take this occasion, gladly, to bid all these 'God speed' in their\r\nwork of love. Co-workers together with us, we praise you for this. We\r\nbid you take courage. Let no dullness, indifference, or neglect, weary\r\nout your patience. You are laboring for Christ, and for precious souls.\r\nYou are doing a work the importance of which _eternity_ will fully\r\nreveal. You will be blessed, too, in your deed even now. This labor will\r\nprove to you an important means of grace. You will have something to\r\npray for, and will enjoy the pleasing consciousness, that you are not\r\nidlers in the Lord's vineyard. You will be winning stars for your crowns\r\nof rejoicing through eternity. Grant that it will cost you much\r\nself-denial. Can you, notwithstanding, consent to see these immortal\r\nbeings growing up in ignorance and vice, at your very doors?\r\n\r\n\"The methods of carrying on the home instruction are various, and we are\r\nabundantly supplied with the needful facilities. We need not name the\r\nreading of the Bible; and judiciously selected sermons, to be read to\r\nthe adults when they cannot attend preaching, should not be omitted.\r\nCatechetical instruction, by means of such excellent aids as our own\r\n'Catechism for young children,' and 'Jones' Catechism of Scripture\r\ndoctrine and practice,' will of course be resorted to; together with\r\nteaching them _hymns_ and _singing with them_. The reading to them, for\r\nvariety, such engaging and instructive stories as are found in the\r\n'Children's column' of some of our best religious papers; and suitable\r\nSabbath school, or other juvenile books, such as 'The Peep of Day,'\r\n'Line upon Line,' etc., will, in many cases, prove an excellent aid, in\r\nimbuing their minds with religious truth. _Masters should not spare\r\nexpense or trouble_, to provide liberally these various helps to those\r\nwho take this work in hand, to aid and encourage them to the utmost in\r\ntheir self-denying toil.\r\n\r\n\"Brethren, the time is propitious to urge your attention to this\r\nimportant duty. A deep and constantly increasing interest in the work,\r\nis felt throughout the South. Just at this time, also, extensively\r\nthroughout portions of our territory, an unusual awakening has been\r\nshowing itself among the colored people. It becomes us, and it is of\r\nvital importance on every account, by judicious instruction, both to\r\nguide the movement, and to improve the opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"We commend this whole great interest to the Divine blessing; and, under\r\nGod, to your conscientious reflection, to devise the proper ways; and to\r\nyour faithful Christian zeal, to accomplish whatever your wisdom may\r\ndevise and approve.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Mobile Daily Tribune_, in referring to the religious training of\r\nthe slaves, says:[80]\r\n\r\n\"Few persons are aware of the efforts that are continually in progress,\r\nin a quiet way, in the various Southern States, for the moral and\r\nreligious improvement of the negroes--of the number of clergymen of good\r\nfamilies, accomplished education, and often of a high degree of talent,\r\nwho devote their whole time and energies to this work; or of the many\r\nlaymen--almost invariably slaveholders themselves--who sustain them by\r\ntheir purses and by their assistance as catechists, Sunday school\r\nteachers, and the like. These men do not make platform speeches, or talk\r\nin public on the subject of their 'mission,' or theorize about the\r\n'planes' on which they stand: they are too busy for this, but they work\r\non quietly in labor and self-denial, looking for a sort of reward very\r\ndifferent from the applause bestowed upon stump agitators. Their work is\r\na much less noisy one, but its results will be far more momentous.\r\n\r\n\"We have very limited information on this subject, for the very reasons\r\njust mentioned, but enough to give some idea of the zeal with which\r\nthese labors are prosecuted by the various Christian denominations.\r\nThus, among the Old School Presbyterians it is stated that about one\r\nhundred ministers are engaged in the religious instruction of the\r\nnegroes exclusively. In South Carolina alone there are forty-five\r\nchurches or chapels of the Episcopal Church, appropriated exclusively to\r\nnegroes; thirteen clergymen devote to them their whole time, and\r\ntwenty-seven a portion of it; and one hundred and fifty persons of the\r\nsame faith are engaged in imparting to them catechetical instruction.\r\nThere are other States which would furnish similar statistics if they\r\ncould be obtained.\r\n\r\n\"It is in view of such facts as these, that one of our cotemporaries,\r\n(the _Philadelphia Inquirer_,) though not free from a certain degree of\r\nanti-slavery proclivity, makes the following candid admission:\r\n\r\n\"'The introduction of African slavery into the colonies of North\r\nAmerica, though doubtless brought about by wicked means, may in the end\r\naccomplish great good to Africa; a good, perhaps, to be effected in no\r\nother way. Hundreds and thousands have already been saved, temporally\r\nand spiritually, who otherwise must have perished. Through these and\r\ntheir descendants it is that civilization and Christianity have been\r\nsent back to the perishing millions of Africa.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Annual Report of the Missionary Society of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church South, 1859, says:\r\n\r\n\"In our colored missions great good has been accomplished by the labors\r\nof the self-sacrificing and zealous missionaries.\r\n\r\n\"This seems to be at home our most appropriate field of labor. By our\r\nposition we have direct access to those for whom these missions are\r\nestablished. Our duty and obligation in regard to them are evident.\r\nIncreased facilities are afforded us, and open doors invite our entrance\r\nand full occupancy. The real value of these missions is often overlooked\r\nor forgotten by _Church census-takers_ and statistic-reporters of our\r\nbenevolent associations. We can but repeat that this field, which seems\r\nalmost, by common consent, to be left for our occupancy, is one of the\r\nmost important and promising in the history of missions. At home even\r\nits very humility obscures, and abroad a mistaken philanthropy\r\nrepudiates its claims. But still the fact exists; and when we look at\r\nthe large number of faithful, pious, and self-sacrificing missionaries\r\nengaged in the work, the wide field of their labors, and the happy\r\nthousands who have been savingly converted to God through their\r\ninstrumentality, we can but perceive the propriety and justice of\r\nassigning to these missions the prominence we have. Indeed, the subject\r\nassumes an importance beyond the conception even of those more directly\r\nengaged in this great work, when it is remembered that these missions\r\nabsolutely number more converts to Christianity, according to statistics\r\ngiven, than all the members of all other missionary societies combined.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, in\r\ntheir Report for 1859, says:\r\n\r\n\"It is gratifying that so much has been done for the evangelization of\r\nthis people. In addition to the missions presented in our report,\r\nthousands of this people are served by preachers in charge of circuits\r\nand stations. But still a great work remains to be accomplished among\r\nthe negroes within your limits. New missions are needed, and increased\r\nattention to the work in this department generally demanded. Heaven\r\ndevolves an immense responsibility upon us with reference to these sable\r\nsons of Ham. Providence has thrown them in our midst, not merely to be\r\nour household and agricultural servants, but to be served by us with the\r\nblessed gospel of the Son of God. Let us then, in the name of Him who\r\nmade it a special sign of his Messiahship that the poor had the gospel\r\npreached unto them--let us in his name go forth, bearing the bread of\r\nlife to these poor among us, and opening to them all the sources of\r\nconsolation and encouragement afforded by the religion of Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Texas Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, in their\r\nReport for 1859, say:\r\n\r\n\"At the last Conference, Gideon W. Cottingham and David W. Fly were\r\nappointed Conference African missionaries, whose duties were to travel\r\nthroughout the Conference, visit the planters in person, and organize\r\nmissions in regions unsupplied. They report an extensive field open, and\r\ntruly white unto the harvest, and have succeeded in organizing several\r\nimportant missions. All the planters, questioned upon the subject, were\r\nwilling to give the missionary access to their servants, to preach and\r\ncatechize, not only on the Sabbath, but during the week. And this\r\nwillingness was not confined to the professors alone, but the deepest\r\ninterest was displayed by many who make no pretensions to religion\r\nwhatever. An interest shown not merely by giving the missionary access\r\nto their servants, but by their pledging their prompt support. The\r\nservants themselves receive the word with the utmost eagerness. They are\r\nhungering for the bread of life; our tables are loaded. Shall not these\r\nstarving souls be fed? Cases of appalling destitution are found: numbers\r\nwho heard for the first time the word of life listened eagerly to the\r\nwonders it unfolded. The Greeks are truly at our doors, heathens growing\r\nup in our midst, revival fire flames around them, a polar frost within\r\ntheir hearts. God help the Church to take care of these perishing souls!\r\nOur anniversaries are usually scenes of unmingled joy. With our sheaves\r\nin our hands, we come from the harvest field, and though sad that so\r\nlittle has been done, yet rejoicing that we have the privilege of laying\r\nany pledge of devotion upon the altar.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in their\r\nReport for 1859, say:\r\n\r\n\"We are cheered to see a growing interest among our planters and\r\nslave-owners in our _domestic missions_. Still that interest is not what\r\nthe importance of the subject demands. While few are willing to bar\r\ntheir servants all gospel privileges, there is a great want in many\r\nplaces of suitable houses for public worship. Too many masters think\r\nthat to permit the missionary to come on the plantation, and preach in\r\nthe gin, or mill, or elsewhere, as circumstances may dictate, is their\r\nonly duty, especially if the missionary gets his bread. None of the\r\nattendant circumstances of a neat church, and suitable Sunday apparel,\r\netc., to cheer and gladden the heart on the holy Sabbath, and cause its\r\ngrateful thanksgiving to go up as clouds of incense before Him, are\r\nthought necessary by many masters.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding, we are cheered by a brightening prospect. Christian\r\nmasters are building churches for their servants. Owners in many places\r\nare adopting the wise policy of erecting their churches so as to bring\r\ntwo, three, or more plantations together for preaching. This plan is so\r\nconsonant with the gospel economy, and so advantageous every way, that\r\nit must become the uniform practice of all our missionary operations\r\namong the slaves. Our late Conference wisely adopted a resolution,\r\nencouraging the building of churches for the accommodation of several\r\nplantations together, wherever it can be done.\"\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in\r\ntheir Report for 1859, say:\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the increasing claims of the destitute colored population\r\nmust not be ignored. New fields are opening before us, the claims of\r\nwhich are pressed with an earnestness which nothing but deeply-felt\r\nnecessity could dictate. And the question is pressed upon us, What shall\r\nwe do? Must not the contributions of the Church be more liberal and more\r\nsystematic? Must not the friends of the enterprise become more zealous?\r\nWill not the wealthy patrons of our society, whose people are served,\r\ncontribute a sum equal in the aggregate to the salary of the\r\nmissionaries who serve their people? This done, and every claim urged\r\nupon your Board shall be honored.\r\n\r\n\"This is wondrous work! God loves it, honors it, blesses it! He has\r\ncrowned it with success. The old negro has abandoned his legendary\r\nrites, and has sought and found favor with God through Jesus Christ. The\r\ncatechumens have received into their hearts the gracious instructions\r\ngiven by the missionary, and scores of them are converted annually, and\r\nbecome worthy members of the Church. Here lies the most inviting field\r\nof labor. To instruct these children of Ham in the plan of salvation, to\r\npreoccupy their minds with \"the truth as it is in Jesus,\" to see them\r\nrenounce the superstitions of their forefathers, and embrace salvation's\r\nplan, would make an angel's heart rejoice.\"\r\n\r\nFailing in securing the Reports of the Baptists at the South, we are\r\nunable to exhibit in detail, their operations among the slave\r\npopulation. The same failure has also occurred in reference to the\r\nCumberland Presbyterians, and some of the other denominations at the\r\nSouth. The statistics, taken from the _Southern Baptist Register_, will\r\nindicate the extent of their success. The following statement made up\r\nfrom the Annual Reports of the Churches named, or from the _Register_,\r\nshows the extent to which the slave population, in the entire South,\r\nhave been brought under the influence of the gospel, and led to profess\r\ntheir faith in the Saviour:\r\n\r\n  Methodist Episcopal Church South,                      188,000\r\n  Methodist Episcopal Church North,[81] in Va. and Md.,   15,000\r\n  Missionary and Anti-Missionary Baptist,                175,000\r\n  General Assembly Presbyterian, (O. S.,)                 12,000\r\n  General Assembly Presbyterian, (N. S.,) estimated        6,000\r\n  Cumberland Presbyterians,                               20,000\r\n  Protestant Episcopal Church, estimated                   7,000\r\n  Christian Church,                                       10,000\r\n  All other denominations,                                20,000\r\n                                                         -------\r\n                 Total                                   453,000\r\n\r\nThe remark has been made, in two of the reports quoted, that the number\r\nof slaves brought into the Christian Church, as a consequence of the\r\nintroduction of the African race into the United States, exceeds all the\r\nconverts made, throughout the heathen world, by the whole missionary\r\nforce employed by Protestant Christendom. Newcomb's Encyclopedia of\r\nMissions, 1856, gives the whole number of converts in the Protestant\r\nChristian missions in Asia, Africa, Pacific islands, West Indies, and\r\nNorth American Indians at 211,389; but more recent estimates make the\r\nnumber approximate 250,000: thus showing that the number of African\r\nconverts in the Southern States, is almost double the whole number of\r\nheathen converts. It is well enough to observe here, that these facts\r\nare not given to prove that slavery should be adopted as a means of\r\nconverting the heathen, but to call attention to the mode in which\r\nDivine Providence is working for the salvation of the African race.\r\n\r\nOur opinion as to the advancement of the free colored people of the\r\nUnited States, in general intelligence, does not stand alone. It is\r\nsustained by high authority, not of the abolition school. The\r\n_Democratic Review_, of 1852,[82] when discussing the question of their\r\nability to conquer and civilize Africa, says:\r\n\r\n\"The negro race has, among its freemen in this country, a mass of men\r\nwho are eminently fitted for deeds of daring. They have generally been\r\nengaged in employments which give a good deal of leisure, and stimulus\r\ntoward improvement of the mind. They have associated much more freely\r\nwith the cultivated and intelligent white than even with their own color\r\nof the same humble station; and on such terms as to enable them to\r\nacquire much of his spirit, and knowledge, and valor. The free blacks\r\namong us are not only confident and well informed, but they have almost\r\nall seen something of the world. They are pre-eminently locomotive and\r\nperambulating. In rail roads, and hotels, and stages, and steamers, they\r\nhave been placed incessantly in contact with the news, the views, the\r\nmotives, and the ideas of the day. Compare the free black with ordinary\r\nwhite men without advantages, and he stands well. Add to this\r\ncultivation, that the negro body is strong and healthy, and the negro\r\nmind keen and bright, though not profound nor philosophical, and you\r\nhave at once a formidable warrior, with a little discipline and\r\nknowledge of weapons. There is no doubt that the picked American free\r\nblacks, would be five times, ten times as efficient in the field of\r\nbattle as the same number of native Africans.\"\r\n\r\nWhy is it then, that the efforts for the moral elevation of the free\r\ncolored people, have been so unsuccessful? Before answering this\r\nquestion, it is necessary to call attention to the fact, that\r\nabolitionists seem to be sadly disappointed in their expectations, as to\r\nthe progress of the free colored people. Their vexation at the\r\nstubborness of the negroes, and the consequent failure of their\r\nmeasures, is very clearly manifested in the complaining language, used\r\nby Gerrit Smith, toward the colored people of the eastern cities, as\r\nwell as by the contempt expressed by the American Missionary\r\nAssociation, for the colored preachers of Canada. They had found an\r\napology, for their want of success in the United States, in the presence\r\nand influence of colonizationists; but no such excuse can be made for\r\ntheir want of success in Canada and the West Indies. Having failed in\r\ntheir anticipations, now they would fain shelter themselves under the\r\npretense, that a people once subjected to slavery, even when liberated,\r\ncan not be elevated in a single generation; that the case of adults,\r\nraised in bondage, like heathen of similar age, is hopeless, and their\r\nchildren, only, can make such progress as will repay the missionary for\r\nhis toil. But they will not be allowed to escape the censure due to\r\ntheir want of discrimination and foresight, by any such plea; as the\r\nsuccess of the Republic of Liberia, conducted from infancy to\r\nindependence, almost wholly by liberated slaves, and those who were born\r\nand raised in the midst of slavery, attests the falsity of their\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nBut to return. Why have the efforts for the elevation of the free\r\ncolored people, not been more successful? On this point our remarks may\r\nbe limited to our own free colored people. The barrier to their progress\r\nhere, exists not so much in their want of capacity, as in the absence of\r\nthe incitements to virtuous action, which are constantly stimulating the\r\nwhite man to press onward and upward in the formation of character and\r\nthe acquisition of knowledge. There is no position in church or state,\r\nto which the poorest white boy, in the common school, may not aspire.\r\nThere is no post of honor, in the gift of his country, that is legally\r\nbeyond his reach. But such encouragements to noble effort, do not and\r\ncannot reach the colored man, and he remains with us a depressed and\r\ndisheartened being. Persuading him to remain in this hopeless condition,\r\nhas been the great error of the abolitionists. They accepted Jefferson's\r\nviews in relation to emancipation, but rejected his opinions as to the\r\nnecessity of separating the races; and thus overlooked the teachings of\r\nhistory, that two races, differing so widely as to prevent their\r\namalgamation by marriage, can never live together, in the same\r\ncommunity, but as superiors and inferiors--the inferior remaining\r\nsubordinate to the superior. The encouraging hopes held out to the\r\ncolored people, that this law would be inoperative upon them, has led\r\nonly to disappointment. Happily, this delusion is nearly at an end; and\r\nsome of them are beginning to act on their own judgments. They find\r\nthemselves so scattered and peeled, that there is not another half a\r\nmillion of men in the world, so enlightened, who are accomplishing so\r\nlittle for their social and moral advancement. They perceive that they\r\nare nothing but branches, wrenched from the great African _banyan_, not\r\nyet planted in genial soil, and affording neither shelter nor food to\r\nthe beasts of the forest or the fowls of the air--their roots unfixed in\r\nthe earth, and their tender shoots withering as they hang pendent from\r\ntheir boughs.\r\n\r\nThat this is no exaggerated picture of the discouragements surrounding\r\nour free colored people, is fully confirmed by the testimony of\r\nimpartial witnesses. Chambers, of Edinburgh, who recently made the tour\r\nof the United States, investigated this point very carefully. His\r\nopinions on the subject have been published, and are so discriminating\r\nand truthful, that we must quote the main portion of them. In speaking\r\nof the agitation of the question of slavery, he says:\r\n\r\n\"For a number of years, as is well known, there has been much angry\r\ndiscussion on the subject between the Northern and Southern States; and\r\nat times the contention has been so great, as to lead to mutual threats\r\nof a dismemberment of the Union. A stranger has no little difficulty in\r\nunderstanding how much of this war of words is real, and how much is\r\nmerely an explosion of _bunkum_. . . . . I repeat, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand what is the genuine public feeling on this entangled\r\nquestion; for with all the demonstrations in favor of freedom in the\r\nNorth, there does not appear in that quarter to be any practical\r\nrelaxation of the usages which condemn persons of African descent to an\r\ninferior social status. There seems, in short, to be a fixed notion\r\nthroughout the whole of the States, whether slave or free, that the\r\ncolored is by nature a subordinate race; and that, in no circumstances,\r\ncan it be considered equal to the white. Apart from commercial views,\r\nthis opinion lies at the root of American slavery; and the question\r\nwould need to be argued less on political and philanthropic than on\r\nphysiological grounds. . . . . I was not a little surprised to find,\r\nwhen speaking a kind word for at least a very unfortunate, if not\r\nbrilliant race, that the people of the Northern States, though\r\nrepudiating slavery, did not think more favorably of the negro character\r\nthan those further South. Throughout Massachusetts, and other New\r\nEngland States, likewise in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, etc.,\r\nthere is a rigorous separation of the white and black races. . . . . The\r\npeople of England, who see a negro only as a wandering curiosity, are\r\nnot at all aware of the repugnance generally entertained toward persons\r\nof color in the United States: it appeared to amount to an absolute\r\nmonomania. As for an alliance with one of the race, no matter how faint\r\nthe shade of color, it would inevitably lead to a loss of caste, as\r\nfatal to social position and family ties as any that occurs in the\r\nBrahminical system. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\"Glad to have had an opportunity of calling attention to many cheering\r\nand commendable features in the social system of the Americans, I\r\nconsider it not less my duty to say, that in their general conduct\r\ntoward the colored race, a wrong is done which can not be alluded to\r\nexcept in terms of the deepest sorrow and reproach. I can not think\r\nwithout shame of the pious and polished New Englanders adding to their\r\noffenses on this score the guilt of hypocrisy. Affecting to weep over\r\nthe sufferings of imaginary dark-skinned heroes and heroines;\r\ndenouncing, in well-studied platform oratory, the horrid sin of reducing\r\nhuman beings to the abject condition of chattels; bitterly scornful of\r\nSouthern planters for hard-hearted selfishness and depravity; fanatical\r\non the subject of abolition; wholly frantic at the spectacle of fugitive\r\nslaves seized and carried back to their owners--these very persons are\r\ndaily surrounded by manumitted slaves, or their educated descendants,\r\nyet shrink from them as if the touch were pollution, and look as if they\r\nwould expire at the bare idea of inviting one of them to their house or\r\ntable. Until all this is changed, the Northern abolitionists place\r\nthemselves in a false position, and do damage to the cause they espouse.\r\nIf they think that negroes are MEN, let them give the world an evidence\r\nof their sincerity, by moving the reversal of all those social and\r\npolitical arrangements which now, in the free States, exclude persons of\r\ncolor, not only from the common courtesies of life, but from the\r\nprivileges and honors of citizens. I say, until this is done, the uproar\r\nabout abolition is a delusion and a snare. . . . .\r\n\r\n\"While lamenting the unsatisfactory condition, present and prospective,\r\nof the colored population, it is gratifying to consider the energetic\r\nmeasures that have been adopted by the African Colonization Society, to\r\ntransplant, with their own consent, free negroes from America to\r\nLiberia. Viewing these endeavors as, at all events, a means of\r\nencouraging emancipation, checking the slave trade, and, at the same\r\ntime, of introducing Christianity and civilized usages into Africa, they\r\nappear to have been deserving of more encouragement than they have had\r\nthe good fortune to receive. Successful only in a moderate degree, the\r\noperations of this society are not likely to make a deep impression on\r\nthe numbers of the colored population; and the question of their\r\ndisposal still remains unsettled.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Christian churches of the South are pursuing the true policy\r\nfor the moral welfare of the slave population, will be admitted by every\r\nright minded man. The present chapter cannot be more appropriately\r\nclosed, than by quoting the language of Rev. J. Waddington, of England,\r\nat a meeting in behalf of the American Missionary Association, held in\r\nBoston, July, 1859. The speakers had been very violent in their\r\ndenunciations of slavery, and when Mr. Waddington came to speak, he thus\r\nrebuked their unchristian spirit:\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" said Mr. Waddington, \"a strong conviction, that freedom can\r\nnever come but of vital Christianity. It is not born of the intellect,\r\nit is not the product of the conscience; it can never be the result of\r\nthe sword. It was with extreme horror that I heard the assertion made\r\nlast night, that it must be through a baptism of blood that freedom must\r\ncome. Never! never! The sword can destroy, it can never create. What do\r\nwe want for freedom? Expansion of the heart. That we should honor other\r\nmen; that we should be concerned for other men. What is it that causes\r\nslavery and oppression? Selfishness, intense, self-destroying\r\nselfishness if you will. Nothing can exorcise that selfishness but the\r\nconstraining love of Christ. The gospel alone, by the Spirit of God, can\r\nwaken freedom in men, in families, in nations.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington, also remarked, that \"every thing in America was\r\nextremely wonderful and surprising to him; and nothing more surprised\r\nhim than the burning words with which his ministerial friends pelted\r\neach other; yet he had no doubt they were the kindest men in the world.\r\nHe thought it was not intended that any harm should be done, but only\r\nthat the cause of truth should be advanced.\"[83]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] Rev.

Have they\r\nsucceeded better in aiding in the abolition of slavery? They have not,\r\nas is abundantly demonstrated by the triumph of the institution. This is\r\nan important point for consideration, as the principal object\r\ninfluencing them to remain in the country, was, that they might assist\r\nin the liberation of their brethren from bondage. But their agency in\r\nthe attempts made to abolish the institution having failed, a more\r\nimportant question arises, as to whether the free colored people, by\r\nrefusing to emigrate, may not have contributed to the advancement of\r\nslavery? An affirmative answer must be given to this inquiry. Nor is a\r\nprotracted discussion necessary to prove the assertion.\r\n\r\nOne of the objections urged with the greatest force against\r\ncolonization, is, its tendency, as is alleged, to increase the value of\r\nslaves by diminishing their numbers. \"Jay's Inquiry,\" 1835, presents\r\nthis objection at length; and the Report of the \"Anti-Slavery Society of\r\nCanada,\" 1853, sums it up in a single proposition thus:\r\n\r\n\"The first effect of beginning to reduce the number of slaves, by\r\ncolonization, would be to increase the market value of those left\r\nbehind, and thereby increase the difficulty of setting them free.\"\r\n\r\nThe practical effect of this doctrine, is to discourage all\r\nemancipations; to render eternal the bondage of each individual slave,\r\nunless all can be liberated; to prevent the benevolence of one master\r\nfrom freeing his slaves, lest his more selfish neighbor should be\r\nthereby enriched; and to leave the whole system intact, until its total\r\nabolition can be effected. Such philanthropy would leave every\r\nindividual, of suffering millions, to groan out a miserable existence,\r\nbecause it could not at once effect the deliverance of the whole. This\r\nobjection to colonization can be founded only in prejudice, or is\r\ndesigned to mislead the ignorant. The advocates of this doctrine do not\r\npractice it, or they would not promote the escape of fugitives to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nBut abolitionists object not only to the colonization of liberated\r\nslaves, as tending to perpetuate slavery; they are equally hostile to\r\nthe colonization of the free colored people, for the same reason. The\r\n\"American Reform Tract and Book Society,\" the organ of the\r\nabolitionists, for the publication of anti-slavery works, has issued a\r\nTract on \"Colonization,\" in which this objection is stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Society perpetuates slavery, by removing the free laborer, and\r\nthereby increasing the demand for, and the value of, slave labor.\"\r\n\r\nThe projectors and advocates of such views may be good philanthropists,\r\nbut they are bad philosophers. We have seen that the power of American\r\nslavery lies in the demand for its products; and that the whole country,\r\nNorth of the sugar and cotton States, is actively employed in the\r\nproduction of provisions for the support of the planter and his slaves,\r\nand in consuming the products of slave labor. This is the constant\r\nvocation of the whites. And how is it with the blacks? Are they\r\ncompeting with the slaves, in the cultivation of sugar and cotton, or\r\nare they also supporting the system, by consuming its products? The\r\nlatitudes in which they reside, and the pursuits in which they are\r\nengaged, will answer this question.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1850, shows but 40,900 free colored persons in the nine\r\nsugar and cotton States, including Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas,\r\nTennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina,\r\nwhile 393,500 are living in the other States. North Carolina is omitted,\r\nbecause it is more of a tobacco and wool-growing, than cotton-producing\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOf the free colored persons in the first-named States, 19,260 are in the\r\ncities and larger towns; while, of the remainder, a considerable number\r\nmay be in the villages, or in the families of the whites. From these\r\nfacts it is apparent, that less than 20,000 of the entire free colored\r\npopulation (omitting those of North Carolina,) are in a position to\r\ncompete with slave labor, while all the remainder, numbering over\r\n412,800, are engaged, either directly or indirectly, in supporting the\r\ninstitution. Even the fugitives escaping to Canada, from having been\r\nproducers necessarily become consumers of slave-grown products; and,\r\nworse still, under the Reciprocity Treaty, they must also become growers\r\nof provisions for the planters who continue to hold their brothers,\r\nsisters, wives and children, in bondage.\r\n\r\nThese are the practical results of the policy of the abolitionists.\r\nVerily, they, also, have dug their ditches on the wrong side of their\r\nbreastworks, and afforded the enemy an easy entrance into their\r\nfortress. But, \"Let them alone; they be blind leaders of the blind. And\r\nif the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.\"[84]\r\n\r\nBut we are not yet prepared to estimate the full extent of the\r\ninfluence, for ill, exerted by the free colored people upon public\r\nsentiment. The picture of their degraded moral condition, drawn by the\r\nabolitionists, is a dark one indeed, and calculated to do but little\r\ntoward promoting emancipation, or in placing themselves in a position of\r\nequality with the whites. According to their testimony, the condition of\r\nthe slave, under the restraints of Christian masters, must be vastly\r\nmore favorable to moral progress, than that of the majority of those who\r\nhave received their freedom. While they have all the animal appetites\r\nand passions fully developed, they seem to remain, intellectually,\r\nchild-like, with neither the courage nor the foresight enabling them to\r\nseize upon fields of enterprise that would lead to wealth and fame. Look\r\nat the facts upon this point. They were offered a home and government of\r\ntheir own in Africa, with the control of extensive tropical cultivation;\r\nbut they rejected the boon, and refused to leave the land of their\r\nbirth, in the vain belief that they could, by remaining here, assist in\r\nwrenching the chains from the slaves of the South. They expected great\r\naid, too, in their work, from the moral effect of West Indian\r\nemancipation; but that has failed in the results anticipated, and the\r\nfree colored laborer is about to be superseded there by imported coolie\r\nlabor from abroad. They expected, also, that the emigrants and fugitives\r\nto Canada, rising into respectability under British laws, would do the\r\nrace much honor, and show the value of emancipation; but even there the\r\nhope has not been realized, and it will be no uncommon thing should the\r\nGovernment set its face against them as most unwelcome visitors. A few\r\nscraps of history will be of service, in illustrating the feeling of the\r\nsubjects of the British North American colonies, in relation to the\r\ninroads made upon them by the free colored people.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, an English military officer, thus wrote:\r\n\r\n\"There is a settlement of negroes a few miles from Halifax, Nova Scotia,\r\nat Hammond's Plains. Any one would have imagined that the Government\r\nwould have taken warning from the trouble and expense it incurred by\r\ngranting protection to those who emigrated from the States during the\r\nRevolution; 1200 of whom were removed to Sierra Leone in 1792 by their\r\nown request. Again when 600 of the insurgent negroes--the Maroons of\r\nJamaica--were transported to Nova Scotia in 1796, and received every\r\npossible encouragement to become good subjects, by being granted a\r\nsettlement at Preston, and being employed upon the fortifications at\r\nHalifax; yet they, too, soon became discontented, and being unwilling to\r\nearn a livelihood by labor, were, in 1800, removed to the same colony,\r\nafter costing the island of Jamaica more than $225,000, and a large\r\nadditional expense to the Province, _i. e._ Nova Scotia. Notwithstanding\r\nwhich, when the runaway slaves were received on board the fleet, off the\r\nChesapeake, during the late war, permission was granted to them to form\r\na settlement at Hammond's Plains, where the same system of discontent\r\narose--many of the settlers professing that they would prefer their\r\nformer well-fed life of slavery, in a more congenial climate, and\r\nearnestly petitioning to be removed, were sent to Trinidad in 1821. Some\r\nfew of those who remained are good servants and farmers, disposing of\r\nthe produce of their lands in the Halifax market; but the majority are\r\nidle, roving, and dirty vagabonds.\"[85]\r\n\r\nThus it appears, that as late as 1821, the policy of the British\r\ncolonies of North America, was to remove the fugitive negroes from their\r\nterritories. The 1200 exported from Halifax, in 1792, were fugitive\r\nslaves who had joined the English during the American Revolutionary war,\r\nand had been promised lands in Nova Scotia; but the Government having\r\nfailed to meet its pledge, and the climate proving unfavorable, they\r\nsought refuge in Africa. These shipments of the colored people, from the\r\nBritish colonies at the North to those of the Tropics, was in accordance\r\nwith the plan that England had adopted at home, in reference to the same\r\nclass of persons--that of removing a people who were a public burden, to\r\nwhere they could be self-supporting. This is a matter of some interest,\r\nand is deserving of notice in this connection. On the 22d of May, 1772,\r\nLord Mansfield decided the memorable Somerset case, and pronounced it\r\nunlawful to hold a slave in Great Britain. The close of that decision\r\nreads thus:\r\n\r\n\"Immemorial usage preserves a positive law, after the occasion or\r\naccident which gave rise to it, has been forgotten; and tracing the\r\nsubject to natural principles, the claim of slavery never can be\r\nsupported. The power claimed was never in use here, or acknowledged by\r\nthe law. Upon the whole, we can not say the cause returned is sufficient\r\nby the law; therefore the man must be discharged.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to this date, many slaves had been introduced into English\r\nfamilies, and, on running away, the fugitives had been delivered up to\r\ntheir masters, by order of the Court of King's Bench, under Lord\r\nMansfield; but now the poor African, no longer hunted as a beast of\r\nprey, in the streets of London, slept under his roof, miserable as it\r\nmight be, in perfect security.[86]\r\n\r\nTo Granville Sharp belonged the honor of this achievement. By the\r\ndecision, about 400 negroes were thrown upon their own resources. They\r\nflocked to Mr. Sharp as their patron; but considering their numbers, and\r\nhis limited means, it was impossible for him to afford them adequate\r\nrelief. To those thus emancipated, others, discharged from the army and\r\nnavy, were afterward added, who, by their improvidence, were reduced to\r\nextreme distress. After much reflection, Mr. Sharp determined to\r\ncolonize them in Africa; but this benevolent scheme could not be\r\nexecuted at once, and the blacks--indigent, unemployed, despised,\r\nforlorn, vicious--became such nuisances, as to make it necessary they\r\nshould be sent somewhere, and no longer suffered to infest the streets\r\nof London.[87] Private benevolence could not be sufficiently enlisted in\r\ntheir behalf, and fifteen years passed away, when Government, anxious to\r\nremove what it regarded as injurious, at last came to the aid of Mr.\r\nSharp, and supplied the means of their transportation and support. In\r\nApril, 1787, these colored people, numbering over 400, were put on\r\nshipboard for Africa, and in the following month were landed in Sierra\r\nLeone.[88]\r\n\r\nBut to return to Canada. We have at hand a flood of information, to\r\nenable us to present a true picture of the colored population of that\r\nProvince, and to discern the feelings entertained toward them by the\r\nwhite inhabitants. On the 27th April, 1841, the Assistant Secretary to\r\nGovernment, addressed MAJOR ROBERT LACHLAN, Chairman of the Quarter\r\nSessions for the Western District, requesting information relating to\r\nthe colored immigrants in that quarter. Major Lachlan replied at length\r\nto the inquiries made, and kept a record of his Report. This volume he\r\nhas had the goodness to place in our hands, from which to make such\r\nextracts as may be necessary to a true understanding of this question.\r\n\r\nThe Major entered the public service of the British Government in 1805,\r\nand was connected with the army in India for twenty years. Having\r\nretired from that service, he settled in Canada in 1835, with the\r\nintention of devoting himself to agriculture; but he was again called\r\ninto public life, as sheriff, magistrate, colonel of militia, Chairman\r\nof the Quarter Sessions, and Associate Judge at the Assizes. In 1857 he\r\nremoved to Cincinnati, where he now resides. A true Briton, he is an\r\nenemy of the system of slavery; but having been a close observer of the\r\nworkings of society, under various circumstances, systems of law,\r\ndegrees of intelligence, and moral conditions, he is opposed to placing\r\ntwo races, so widely diverse as the blacks and whites, upon terms of\r\nlegal equality; not that he is opposed to the elevation of the colored\r\nman, but because he is convinced that, in his present state of ignorance\r\nand degradation, the two races cannot dwell together in peace and\r\nharmony. This opinion, it will be seen, was the outgrowth of his\r\nexperience and observation in Canada, and not the result of a prejudice\r\nagainst the African race. The Western District, the field of his\r\nofficial labors, is the main point toward which nearly all the\r\nemigration from the States is directed; and the Major had, thus, the\r\nbest of opportunities for studying this question. Besides the facts of\r\nan official nature, in the volume from which we quote, it has a large\r\namount of documentary testimony, from other sources, from which liberal\r\nextracts have also been made.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] Matthew's Gospel, xv: 14.\r\n\r\n[85] \"A Subaltern's Furlough,\" by Lt.

I trust, therefore, that should\r\n          the particulars furnished by me upon these heads,\r\n          be found more meager and defective than might be\r\n          expected, it will either be assigned to these\r\n          causes, or to others which may be given in the\r\n          course of the following remarks: and if these\r\n          remarks, themselves, be found to be drawn up with\r\n          more of loose unmethodical freedom than official\r\n          conciseness, I trust that that feature will rather\r\n          be regarded in their favor than otherwise.\r\n\r\n          \"The exact period at which the colored people\r\n          began to make their appearance in the Western\r\n          District, _as settlers_, I have not been able to\r\n          ascertain to my satisfaction; but it is generally\r\n          believed to have been about the time of the War\r\n          with the Americans, in 1812. Before then, however,\r\n          there had been a few scattered about, who,\r\n          generally speaking, had, prior to the passing of\r\n          the Emancipation Bill, been slaves to different\r\n          individuals in the District. From 1813 to 1821,\r\n          the increase was very trifling; and they were\r\n          generally content to hire themselves out as\r\n          domestic or farm servants; but about the latter\r\n          period the desire of several gentlemen residing\r\n          near Sandwich and Amherstburgh to place settlers\r\n          on their lands, induced them, in the absence of\r\n          better, to resort to the unfortunate, impolitic\r\n          expedient of leasing out or selling small portions\r\n          of land to colored people on such inviting\r\n          conditions as not only speedily allowed many of\r\n          those who had already settled in the country to\r\n          undertake 'farming on their own account,' but\r\n          encouraged many more to escape from their American\r\n          masters, to try their fortunes in this now\r\n          far-famed 'land of liberty and promise.' The\r\n          stream having thus begun to flow, the secret\r\n          workings of the humane, but not unexceptionable\r\n          abolitionist societies, existing in the American\r\n          States, speedily widened and deepened the channel\r\n          of approach, until a flood of colored immigrants,\r\n          of the very worst classes, has been progressively\r\n          introduced into the District, which had, last\r\n          year, reached an aggregate of about 1500 souls,\r\n          and which threatens to be doubled in the course of\r\n          a very short time, unless it be within the power\r\n          of the Government to counteract it;--but which,\r\n          _if suffered to roll on unchecked_, will sooner or\r\n          later lead to the most serious, if not most\r\n          lamentable consequences.\r\n\r\n          \"From my making so strong an observation at the\r\n          very threshold of my remarks, it will be readily\r\n          perceived that my opinion of these unfortunate\r\n          people is unfavorable. I am therefore anxious,\r\n          before proceeding further, to shield myself from\r\n          the imputation of either groundless antipathy or\r\n          pre-indisposition toward men of color, and to have\r\n          it thoroughly understood that, as far as I can\r\n          judge of my own feelings, _they_ are the very\r\n          reverse, having not only been warmly in favor of\r\n          the poor enslaved negro, but having for near\r\n          twenty years of my life been surrounded by free\r\n          colored people, and retained my favorable leaning\r\n          toward even the African race, till some time after\r\n          my arrival in this Province. Unfortunately,\r\n          however, for this pre-disposition, as well as for\r\n          the character of this ill-fated race, my attention\r\n          was shortly after directed by particular\r\n          circumstances to the quiet study of their\r\n          disposition and habits, and ended in a thorough\r\n          conviction that without a radical change they\r\n          would ere long, like the snake in the bosom of the\r\n          husbandman, prove a curse, instead of a benefit to\r\n          the country which fosters and protects them.\r\n\r\n          \"The first time that I had occasion to express\r\n          myself thus strongly on the subject, in an\r\n          official way, was less than two years after my\r\n          arrival in the District, while holding the office\r\n          of sheriff,--when, in corresponding with Mr.\r\n          Secretary Joseph, during the troubles in January,\r\n          1838, I, in a postscript to a letter in which I\r\n          expressed unwillingness to call in aid from other\r\n          quarters, while our own population were allowed to\r\n          remain inactive, was led to add the following\r\n          remarkable words: 'My vote has been equally\r\n          decided against employing the colored people,\r\n          except on a similar emergency;--in fact, though a\r\n          cordial friend to the emancipation of the poor\r\n          African, I regard the rapidly increasing\r\n          population rising round us, as destined to be a\r\n          bitter curse to the District; and do not think our\r\n          employing them as our _defenders_ at all likely to\r\n          retard the progress of such an event;'--an opinion\r\n          which all my subsequent observation and\r\n          experience, whether as a private individual, as\r\n          Sheriff of the District, as a local Magistrate, as\r\n          Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, or as an anxious\r\n          friend to pure British immigration, have only the\r\n          more strongly confirmed.\"\r\n\r\n          After these preliminary remarks, the Records of\r\n          Major Lachlan, proceed to the details of the\r\n          various points upon which he was required by\r\n          Government to report. Much of this, though the\r\n          whole is interesting, must be omitted in our\r\n          extracts. In speaking of the several townships to\r\n          which the colored immigration was directed, he\r\n          says of Amherstburgh:\r\n\r\n          \"That place may now be regarded as the Western\r\n          rendezvous of the colored race,--being the point\r\n          to which all the idle and worthless, as well as\r\n          the well disposed, first direct their steps,\r\n          before dispersing over other parts of the\r\n          District,--a distinction of which it unfortunately\r\n          bears too evident marks in the great number of\r\n          petty crimes committed by or brought home to these\r\n          people,--to the great trouble of the investigating\r\n          local magistrates, and the still greater annoyance\r\n          of the inhabitants generally,--arising from the\r\n          constant nightly depredations committed on their\r\n          orchards, barns, granaries, sheep-folds, fowl-yards,\r\n          and even cellars.\" . . . . \"In Gosfield, I am given\r\n          to understand their general character is rather\r\n          above par; . . . . while in the next adjoining\r\n          township of Mersea, so much are they disliked by\r\n          the inhabitants, that they are, in a manner,\r\n          proscribed by general consent--a colored man being\r\n          there scarcely suffered to travel along the\r\n          highroads unmolested.\r\n\r\n          \"The first thing that forcibly struck me, in these\r\n          people, was a total absence of that modest and\r\n          unpresuming demeanor which I had been some how led\r\n          to expect, and the assumption, instead, of a 'free\r\n          and easy' independence of manner as well as\r\n          language toward all white inhabitants, except\r\n          their immediate employers, together with an\r\n          apparent utter indifference to being hired on\r\n          reasonable average wages, though, as already\r\n          stated, seemingly without any visible means of a\r\n          livelihood, and their also, at all times,\r\n          estimating the value of their labor on a par, if\r\n          not above that of the white man. And I had\r\n          scarcely recovered from my surprise, at such\r\n          conduct, as a private individual, when, as a\r\n          magistrate, I was still more astonished at the\r\n          great amount of not only petty offenses, but of\r\n          crime of the most atrocious dye, perpetrated by so\r\n          small a body of strangers compared with the great\r\n          bulk of the white population: and such still\r\n          continuing to be the unabating case, Session after\r\n          Session, Assize after Assize, it at length became\r\n          so appalling to my feelings, that on being placed\r\n          in the chair of the Quarter Sessions, I could not\r\n          refrain from more than once pointing to it in\r\n          strong language in my charges to the Grand Juries.\r\n          In July last year, for instance, I was led, in\r\n          connection with a particular case of larceny, to\r\n          observe . . . . 'The case itself will, I trust,\r\n          involve no difficulty so far as the Grand Jury is\r\n          concerned; but it affords the magistrates another\r\n          opportunity of lamenting that there should so\r\n          speedily be furnished no less than five additional\r\n          instances of the rapid increase of crime in this\r\n          (hitherto in that respect highly fortunate)\r\n          District, arising solely from the recent great\r\n          influx of colored people into it from the\r\n          neighboring United States,--and who unfortunately\r\n          not only furnish the major part of the crime\r\n          perpetrated in the District, but also thereby a\r\n          very great portion of its rapidly increasing\r\n          debt,--from the expense attending their\r\n          maintenance in jail before trial, as well as after\r\n          conviction! . . . .\r\n\r\n          \"In spite of these solemn admonitions, a large\r\n          proportion of the criminals tried at the ensuing\r\n          September Assizes were colored people; and among\r\n          them were two aggravated cases of rape and arson;\r\n          the former wantonly perpetrated on a respectable\r\n          farmer's wife, in this township, to whom the\r\n          wretch was a perfect stranger; the latter\r\n          recklessly committed at a merchant's store in the\r\n          vicinity of Sandwich, for the mere purpose of\r\n          opening a hole through which to convey away his\r\n          plunder. And, notwithstanding 'the general jail\r\n          delivery' that then took place, the greater part\r\n          of the crimes brought before the following mouth's\r\n          Quarter Sessions (chiefly larceny and assaults)\r\n          were furnished by the same people!--a circumstance\r\n          of so alarming and distressing a character, that I\r\n          was again led to comment upon it in my charge to\r\n          the Grand Jury in the following terms. 'Having\r\n          disposed of the law relating to these offenses, I\r\n          arrive at a very painful part of nay observations,\r\n          in once more calling the particular attention of\r\n          the Grand Jury, as well as the public at large, to\r\n          the remarkable and appalling circumstance that\r\n          among a population of near 20,000 souls,\r\n          inhabiting this District, the greater portion of\r\n          the crime perpetrated therein should be committed\r\n          by less than 2,000 refugees from a life of _abject\r\n          slavery_, to a land of _liberty, protection and\r\n          comfort_,--and from whom, therefore, if there be\r\n          such generous feelings as thankfulness and\r\n          gratitude, a far different line of conduct might\r\n          reasonably be expected. I allude to the alarming\r\n          increase of crime still perpetrated by the colored\r\n          settlers, and who, in spite of the late numerous,\r\n          harrowing, _convicted examples_, unhappily furnish\r\n          _the whole of the offenses now likely to be\r\n          brought before you_!'. . . . .\r\n\r\n          \"But, sir, the wide spreading current of crime\r\n          among this unfortunate race was not to be easily\r\n          arrested;--and I had long become so persuaded that\r\n          it must sooner or later force itself upon the\r\n          notice of the Legislature, that on feeling it my\r\n          duty to draw the attention of my brother\r\n          magistrates to the embarrassed state of the\r\n          District finances, and to the greater portion of\r\n          its expenses arising from this disreputable\r\n          source, I was led, in framing the report of a\r\n          special committee (of which I was chairman)\r\n          appointed to investigate our pecuniary\r\n          difficulties, to advert once more to the great\r\n          undue proportion of our expenses arising from\r\n          crime committed by so small a number of colored\r\n          people, compared with the great body of the\r\n          inhabitants, in the following strong but\r\n          indisputable language: 'It is with pain and regret\r\n          that your committee, in conclusion, feel bound to\r\n          recur to the great additional burthen thrown upon\r\n          the District, as well as the undeserved stigma\r\n          cast upon the general character of its population,\r\n          whether native or immigrant British, by the late\r\n          great influx of colored people of the worst\r\n          description from the neighboring States--a great\r\n          portion of whom appear to have no visible means of\r\n          gaining a livelihood,--and who, therefore, not\r\n          only furnish a large proportion of the basest\r\n          crimes perpetrated in the country, such as murder,\r\n          rape, arson, burglary, and larceny, besides every\r\n          other description of minor offense,--untraceable\r\n          to the _color_ of the perpetrators in a\r\n          miscellaneous published calendar; but also,\r\n          besides the constant trouble they entail upon\r\n          magistrates who happen to reside in their\r\n          neighborhood, produce a large portion of the debt\r\n          incurred by the District, from the great number\r\n          committed to and subsisted in prison, etc.; and\r\n          they would with all respect for the liberty of the\r\n          subject, and the sincerest good will toward their\r\n          African brethren generally,--whom they would wish\r\n          to regard with every kindly feeling, venture to\r\n          suggest, for the consideration of Government,\r\n          whether any legislative check can possibly be\r\n          placed upon the rapid importation of the most\r\n          worthless of this unfortunate race, such, as the\r\n          good among themselves candidly lament, has of late\r\n          inundated this devoted section of the Province, to\r\n          the great detriment of the claims of the poor\r\n          emigrant from the mother country upon our\r\n          consideration, the great additional and almost\r\n          uncontrollable increase of crime, and the\r\n          proportionate demoralization of principle among\r\n          the inhabitants of the country.' . . . . . .\r\n\r\n          \"Notwithstanding all these strenuous endeavors,\r\n          added to the most serious and impressive\r\n          admonitions to various criminals after conviction\r\n          and sentence, no apparent change for the better\r\n          occurred; for at the Quarter Sessions of last\r\n          January, the usual preponderance of negro crime\r\n          struck me so forcibly as again to draw from me, in\r\n          my charge to the Grand Jury, the following\r\n          observations: 'I am extremely sorry to be unable\r\n          to congratulate you or the country on a light\r\n          calendar, the matters to be brought before you\r\n          embracing no less than three cases of larceny, and\r\n          one of enticing soldiers to desert, besides\r\n          several arising from that ever prolific source,\r\n          assaults, etc. I cannot, however, pass the former\r\n          by altogether without once more emphatically\r\n          remarking, that it is as much to the disgrace of\r\n          the free colored settlers in our District, as it\r\n          is creditable to the rest of our population, that\r\n          the greater part of the culprits to be brought\r\n          before us are still men of color: and I lament\r\n          this the more, as I was somewhat in hopes that the\r\n          earnest admonitions that I had more than once felt\r\n          it my duty to address to that race, would have\r\n          been attended with some good effect.'. . . . .\r\n\r\n          \"In spite of all these reiterated, anxious\r\n          endeavors, the amount of crime exhibited in the\r\n          Calendar of the following Quarter Sessions, in\r\n          April last, consisted solely (I think) of five\r\n          cases of larceny, perpetrated by negroes; and at\r\n          the late Assizes, held on the 20th instant, out of\r\n          five criminal cases, one of enticing soldiers to\r\n          desert, and two of theft, were, as usual,\r\n          committed by men of color!!!\r\n\r\n          \"Having thus completed a painful retrospect of the\r\n          appalling amount of crime committed by the colored\r\n          population in the District at large, compared with\r\n          the general mass of the white population, I now\r\n          consider it my duty to advert more particularly to\r\n          what has been passing more immediately under my\r\n          own observation in the township of Colchester.\"\r\n\r\nThe record from which we quote, has, under this head, the statement of\r\nthe township collector, as to the moral and social condition of the\r\ncolored people of the township, in which he says, \"that, in addition to\r\nthe black women there were fourteen yellow ones, and fifteen _white_\r\nones--that they run together like beasts, and that he did not suppose\r\none third of them were married; and further, that they would be a curse\r\nto this part of Canada, unless there is something done to put a stop to\r\ntheir settling among the white people.'\r\n\r\nIn referring to the enlistment of the blacks as soldiers, to the\r\nprejudice of the legitimate prospects of the deserving European\r\nemigrants, the record says: \"With regard to continuing to employ the\r\ncolored race to discharge--in some instances exclusively, as is now the\r\ncase at Chatham--the duties of regular soldiers, in such times as these,\r\n_in a country peopled by BRITONS_, I regard it as not only impolitic in\r\nthe extreme, but even _dangerous_ also,--besides throwing a stigma of\r\ndegradation on the honorable profession of which I was for twenty-four\r\nyears of my life a devoted member. And I even put it to yourself, sir,\r\nwhat would have been your feelings, if, amid the great political\r\nexcitement prevalent during the late Kent election,[90] there had been a\r\nserious disturbance and some unthinking magistrate had called in '_the\r\naid of the military_' to quell it, and blood had been shed!--for the\r\nthing was within possibility, and for some time gave me much uneasiness.\r\nHad such been the case,--what would have been the appalling, and\r\nprobable, nay, almost _certain_ result,--if I may judge from the well\r\nknown feelings of the white population generally,--_that that\r\nunfortunate company would have been instantly turned upon, by men of all\r\nparties, and massacred on the spot with their own weapons!_\" . . . . .\r\n\"Allow me, therefore, at all events briefly to remark, that before any\r\nthing can be accomplished connected with the moral and religious\r\nimprovement of the negro settlers, they must be rescued from the hands\r\nof the utterly ignorant and uneducated, yet conceited coxcombs of their\r\nown color, who assume to themselves the grave character and holy office\r\nof ministers and preachers of the gospel, and lead their still more\r\nignorant followers into all the extravagancies of 'Love Feasts' and\r\n'Camp Meetings,' without at all comprehending their import, and at the\r\nsame time utterly neglecting all other essentials!--an object well\r\ndeserving of the most serious and anxious consideration of an\r\nenlightened Government, as far as those who are already settled in the\r\ncountry are concerned; while it would be a most sound and politic\r\nmeasure to take every lawful step to discourage as much as possible, if\r\nwe can not altogether _prevent_ the further introduction of so\r\nobjectionable and deleterious a class of settlers into a BRITISH\r\n_colony_. \". . . . \"Perhaps one of the wisest measures that could be\r\ndevised--(since our friends, the American abolitionists, will insist on\r\npeopling Canada with run-away negro slaves)--will be to throw every\r\npossible obstacle in the way of the sadly deteriorating _amalgamation of\r\ncolor_ already in progress, by Government allotting, at least, a\r\ndistinct and separate location to all negro settlers, except those who\r\nchoose to occupy the humble but useful station of farm and domestic\r\nservants; and even, if possible, purchasing back at the public expense,\r\non almost any terms, whatever scattered landed property they may have\r\nelsewhere acquired in different parts of the Province.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report of Major Lachlan is very extensive, and embraces many topics\r\nconnected with the question of negro immigration into Canada. His\r\nresponse to Government led to further investigation, and to some\r\nlegislative action in the Canadian Parliament. The latest recorded\r\ncommunications upon the subject, from his pen, are dated November 9th,\r\n1849, and June 4th, 1850, from which it appears that up to that date,\r\nthere had been no abatement of the hostile feeling of the whites toward\r\nthe blacks, nor any improvement in the social and moral condition of the\r\nblacks themselves.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, the Elgin Association went into operation. Its object was to\r\nconcentrate the colored people at one point, and thus have them in a\r\nmore favorable position for intellectual and moral culture. A large body\r\nof land was purchased in the Township of Raleigh, and offered for sale\r\nin small lots to colored settlers. The measure was strongly opposed, and\r\ncalled out expressions of sentiment adverse to it, from the people at\r\nlarge. A public meeting, held in Chatham, August 18, 1849, thus\r\nexpressed itself:\r\n\r\n\"The Imperial Parliament of Great Britain has forever banished slavery\r\nfrom the Empire. In common with all good men, we rejoice at the\r\nconsummation of this immortal act; and we hope, that all other nations\r\nmay follow the example. Every member of the human family is entitled to\r\ncertain rights and privileges, and no where on earth are they better\r\nsecured, enjoyed, or more highly valued, than in Canada. Nature,\r\nhowever, has divided the same great family into distinct species, for\r\ngood and wise purposes, and it is no less our interest, than it is our\r\nduty, to follow her dictates and obey her laws. Believing this to be a\r\nsound and correct principle, as well as a moral and a Christian duty, it\r\nis with alarm we witness the fast increasing emigration, and settlement\r\namong us of the African race; and with pain and regret, do we view the\r\nestablishment of an association, the avowed object of which is to\r\nencourage the settlement in old, well-established communities, of a race\r\nof people which is destined by nature to be distinct and separate from\r\nus. It is also with a feeling of deep resentment that we look upon the\r\nselection of the Township of Raleigh, in this District, as the first\r\nportion of our beloved country, which is to be cursed, with a systematic\r\norganization for setting the laws of nature at defiance. Do communities\r\nin other portions of Canada, feel that the presence of the negro among\r\nthem is an annoyance? Do they feel that the increase of the colored\r\npeople among them, and amalgamation its necessary and hideous attendant,\r\nis an evil which requires to be checked? With what a feeling of horror,\r\nwould the people of any of the old settled townships of the eastern\r\nportion of this Province, look upon a measure which had for its avowed\r\nobject, the effect of introducing several hundreds of Africans, into the\r\nvery heart of their neighborhood, their families interspersing\r\nthemselves among them, upon every vacant lot of land, their children\r\nmingling in their schools, and all claiming to be admitted not only to\r\npolitical, but to social privileges? and when we reflect, too, that many\r\nof them must from necessity, be the very worst species of that neglected\r\nrace; the fugitives from justice; how much more revolting must the\r\nscheme appear? How then can you adopt such a measure? We beseech our\r\nfellow subjects to pause before they embark in such an enterprise, and\r\nask themselves, 'whether they are doing by us as they would wish us to\r\ndo unto them.' . . . . Surely our natural position is irksome enough\r\nwithout submitting to a measure, which not only holds out a premium for\r\nfilling up our district with a race of people, upon whom we can not look\r\nwithout a feeling of repulsion, and who, having been brought up in a\r\nstate of bondage and servility, are totally ignorant both of their\r\nsocial and political duties; but at the same time makes it the common\r\nreceptable into which all other portions of the Province are to void the\r\ndevotees of misery and crime. Look at your prisons and your\r\npenitentiary, and behold the fearful preponderance of their black over\r\ntheir white inmates in proportion to the population of each. . . . . We\r\nhave no desire to show hostility toward the colored people, no desire to\r\nbanish them from the Province. On the contrary, we are willing to assist\r\nin any well-devised scheme for their moral and social advancement. Our\r\nonly desire is, that they shall be separated from the whites, and that\r\nno encouragement shall hereafter be given to the migration of the\r\ncolored man from the United States, or any where else. The idea that we\r\nhave brought the curse upon ourselves, through the establishment of\r\nslavery by our ancestors, is false. As Canadians, we have yet to learn\r\nthat we ought to be made a vicarious atonement for European sins.\r\n\r\n\"Canadians: The hour has arrived when we should arouse from our\r\nlethargy; when we should gather ourselves together in our might, and\r\nresist the onward progress of an evil which threatens to entail upon\r\nfuture generations a thousand curses. Now is the day. A few short years\r\nwill put it beyond our power. Thousands and tens of thousands of\r\nAmerican negroes, with the aid of the abolition societies in the States,\r\nand with the countenance given them by our philanthropic institutions,\r\nwill continue to pour into Canada, if resistance is not offered. Many of\r\nyou who live at a distance from this frontier, have no conception either\r\nof the number or the character of these emigrants, or of their poisonous\r\neffect upon the moral and social habits of a community. You listen with\r\nactive sympathy to every thing narrated of the sufferings of the poor\r\nAfrican; your feelings are enlisted, and your purse strings unloosed,\r\nand this often by the hypocritical declamation of some self-styled\r\nphilanthropist. Under such influences many of you, in our large cities\r\nand towns, form yourselves into societies, and, without reflection, you\r\nsupply funds for the support of schemes prejudicial to the best\r\ninterests of our country. Against such proceedings, and especially\r\nagainst any and every attempt to settle any township in this District\r\nwith negroes, we solemnly protest, and we call upon our countrymen, in\r\nall parts of the Province, to assist in our opposition.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow Christians: Let us forever maintain the sacred dogma, that all\r\nmen have equal, natural, and inalienable rights. Let us do every thing\r\nin our power, consistent with international polity and justice, to\r\nabolish the accursed system of slavery in the neighboring Republic. But\r\nlet us not, through a mistaken zeal to abate the evil of another land,\r\nentail upon ourselves a misery which every enlightened lover of his\r\ncountry must mourn. Let the slaves of the United States be free, but let\r\nit be in their own country. Let us not countenance their further\r\nintroduction among us; in a word, let the people of the United States\r\nbear the burthen of their own sins.\r\n\r\n\"What has already been done, can not now be avoided; but it is not too\r\nlate to do justice to ourselves, and retrieve the errors of the past.\r\nLet a suitable place be provided by the Government, to which the colored\r\npeople may be removed, and separated from the whites, and in this scheme\r\nwe will cordially join. We owe it to them, but how much more do we owe\r\nit to ourselves? But we implore you that you will not, either by your\r\ncounsel, or your pecuniary aid, assist those who have projected the\r\nassociation for the settlement of a horde of ignorant slaves in the town\r\nof Raleigh. It is one of the oldest and most densely settled townships,\r\nin the very center of our new and promising District of Kent, and we\r\nfeel that this scheme, if carried into operation, will have the effect\r\nof hanging like a dead weight upn our rising prosperity. What is our\r\ncase to-day, to-morrow may be yours; join us then, in endeavoring to put\r\na stop to what is not only a general evil, but in this case an act of\r\nunwarrantable injustice; and when the time may come when you shall be\r\nsimilarly situated to us, we have no doubt that, like us, you will cry\r\nout, and your appeal shall not be in vain.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of September, 1849, the colored people of Toronto, Canada,\r\nheld a meeting, in which they responded at length to the foregoing\r\naddress. The spirit of the meeting can be divined from the following\r\nresolutions, which were unanimously passed:\r\n\r\n\"1st. _Resolved_, That we, as a portion of the inhabitants of Canada,\r\nconceive it to be our imperative duty to give an expression of sentiment\r\nin reference to the proceedings of the late meeting held at Chatham,\r\ndenying the right of the colored people to settle where they please.\r\n\r\n\"2d. _Resolved_, That we spurn with contempt and burning indignation,\r\nany attempt, on the part of any person, or persons, to thrust us from\r\nthe general bulk of society, and place us in a separate and distinct\r\nclassification, such as is expressly implied in an address issued from\r\nthe late meeting above alluded to.\r\n\r\n\"3d. _Resolved_, That the principle of selfishness, as exemplified in\r\nthe originators of the resolutions and address, we detest, as we do\r\nsimilar ones emanating from a similar source; and we can clearly see the\r\nworkings of a corrupt and depraved heart, arranged in hostility to the\r\nheaven-born principle of _liberty_, in its broadest and most\r\nunrestricted sense.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of October, 1849, the Municipal Council of the Western\r\nDistrict, adopted a Memorial to His Excellency, the Governor General,\r\nprotesting against the proposed Elgin Association, in which the\r\nfollowing language occurs:\r\n\r\n. . . . . \"Clandestine petitions have been got up, principally, if not\r\nwholly, signed by colored people, in order to mislead Government and the\r\nElgin Association. These petitions do not embody the sentiments or\r\nfeelings of the respectable, intelligent, and industrious yeomanry of\r\nthe Western District. We can assure your Excellency that any such\r\nstatement is false, that there is but one feeling, and that is of\r\ndisgust and hatred, that they, the negroes, should be allowed to settle\r\nin any township where there is a white settlement. Our language is\r\nstrong; but when we look at the expressions used at a late meeting held\r\nby the colored people of Toronto, openly avowing the propriety of\r\namalgamation, and stating that it must, and will, and shall continue, we\r\ncannot avoid so doing. . . . . . The increased immigration of foreign\r\nnegroes into this part of the Province is truly alarming. We cannot omit\r\nmentioning some facts for the corroboration of what we have stated. The\r\nnegroes, who form at least one-third of the inhabitants of the township\r\nof Colchester, attended the township meeting for the election of parish\r\nand township officers, and insisted upon their right to vote, which was\r\ndenied them by every individual white man at the meeting. The\r\nconsequence was, that the Chairman of the meeting was prosecuted and\r\nthrown into heavy costs, which costs were paid by subscription from\r\nwhite inhabitants. In the same township of Colchester, as well as in\r\nmany others, the inhabitants have not been able to get schools in many\r\nschool sections, in consequence of the negroes insisting on their right\r\nof sending their children to such schools. No white man will ever act\r\nwith them in any public capacity; this fact is so glaring, that no\r\nsheriff in this Province would dare to summons colored men to do jury\r\nduty. That such things have been done in other quarters of the British\r\ndominions we are well aware of, but we are convinced that the Canadians\r\nwill never tolerate such conduct.\"\r\n\r\nA Toronto paper of December 24, 1847, says: \"The white inhabitants are\r\nfast leaving the vicinity of the proposed colored settlement, for the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nThe _St. Catharines Journal_, June, 1852, under the head of \"the fruits\r\nof having colored companies and colored settlements,\" says: \"On the\r\noccasion of the June muster of the militia, a pretty large turn out took\r\nplace at St. Catharines. We regret exceedingly that the day did not pass\r\nover without a serious riot. It seems that on the parade ground some\r\ninsult was offered to the colored company, which was very properly\r\nrestrained by Colonel Clark, and others. If the affair had ended here,\r\nit would have been fortunate; but the bad feeling exhibited on the\r\nparade ground was renewed, by some evil-minded person, and the colored\r\npopulation, becoming roused to madness, they proceeded to wreak their\r\nvengeance on a company in Stinson's tavern, after which a general melee\r\ntook place, in which several men were wounded, and it is likely some\r\nwill die of the injuries received. The colored village is a ruin, and\r\nmuch more like a place having been beseiged by an enemy than any thing\r\nelse. This is the reward which the colored men have received for their\r\nloyalty, and the readiness with which they turned out to train, and no\r\ndoubt would if the country required their services. This is a most\r\npainful occurrence, and must have been originated by some very ignorant\r\npersons. How any man possessing the common feelings of humanity, to say\r\nnothing of loyalty, could needlessly offer insult to so many men, so\r\ncheerfully turning out in obedience to the laws of the country, exceeds\r\nbelief, if it were not a matter of fact. Too much credit cannot be given\r\nto those worthy citizens who used their best efforts to restrain the\r\nexcitement, and prevented any further blood-shedding.\"\r\n\r\nBut here we have testimony of a later date. Hon. Colonel Prince, member\r\nof the Canadian Parliament in 1857, had resided among the colored people\r\nof the Western District; and, like other humane men, had sympathized\r\nwith them, at the outset, and shown them many favors. Time and\r\nobservation changed his views, and, in the course of his parliamentary\r\nduties, we find him taking a stand adverse to the further increase of\r\nthe negro population in Canada. Hear him, as reported at the time:\r\n\r\n\"On the order of the day for the third reading of the emigrants' law\r\namendment bill being called, Hon. Col. Prince said he was wishful to\r\nmove a rider to the measure. The black people who infested the land were\r\nthe greatest curse to the Province. The lives of the people of the West\r\nwere made wretched by the inundation of these animals, and many of the\r\nlargest farmers in the county of Kent have been compelled to leave their\r\nbeautiful farms, because of the pestilential swarthy swarms.--What were\r\nthese wretches fit for? Nothing. They cooked our victuals and shampooned\r\nus; but who would not rather that these duties should be performed by\r\nwhite men? The blacks were a worthless, useless, thriftless set of\r\nbeings--they were too indolent, lazy and ignorant to work, too proud to\r\nbe taught; and not only that, if the criminal calendars of the country\r\nwere examined, it would be found that they were a majority of the\r\ncriminals. They were so detestable that unless some method were adopted\r\nof preventing their influx into this country by the \"underground rail\r\nroad,\" the people of the West would be obliged to drive them out by open\r\nviolence. The bill before the House imposed a capitation tax upon\r\nemigrants from Europe, and the object of his motion was to levy a\r\nsimilar tax upon blacks who came hither from the States. He now moved,\r\nseconded by Mr. Patton, that a capitation tax of 5_s_ for adults, and\r\n3_s_ 9_d_ for children above one year and under fourteen years of age,\r\nbe levied on persons of color emigrating to Canada from any foreign\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Ought not the Western men to be protected from the rascalities and\r\nvillainies of the black wretches? He found these men with fire and food,\r\nand lodging when they were in need; and he would be bound to say that\r\nthe black men of the county of Essex would speak well of him in this\r\nrespect. But he could not admit them as being equal to white men; and,\r\nafter a long and close observation of human nature, he had come to the\r\nconclusion that the black man was born to and intended for slavery, and\r\nthat he was fit for nothing else. [Sensation.] Honorable gentlemen might\r\ntry to groan him down, but he was not to be moved by mawkish sentiment,\r\nand he was persuaded that they might as well try to change the spots of\r\nthe leopard as to make the black a good citizen. He had told black men\r\nso, and the lazy rascals had shrugged their shoulders and wished they\r\nhad never ran away from their \"good old massa\" in Kentucky. If there was\r\nany thing unchristian in what he had proposed, he could not see it, and\r\nhe feared that he was not born a Christian.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Windsor Herald_, of July 3d, 1857, contains the proceedings of an\r\nindignation meeting, held by the colored people of Toronto, at which\r\nthey denounced Colonel Prince in unmeasured terms of reproach. The same\r\npaper contains the reply of the Colonel, copied from the _Toronto\r\nColonist_, and it is given entire, as a specimen of the spicy times they\r\nhave, in Canada, over the negro question. The editor remarks, in\r\nrelation to the reply of Colonel Prince, that it has given general\r\nsatisfaction in his neighborhood. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR:--Your valuable paper of yesterday has afforded me a rich\r\ntreat and not a little fun in the report of an indignation meeting of\r\n'the colored citizens' of Toronto, held for the purpose of censuring me.\r\nPerhaps I ought not to notice their proceedings--perhaps it would be\r\nmore becoming in me to allow them to pass at once into the oblivion\r\nwhich awaits them; but as it is the fashion in this country not\r\nunfrequently to assume that to be true which appears in print against an\r\nindividual, unless he flatly denies the accusation, I shall, at least,\r\nfor once, condescend to notice these absurd proceedings. They deal in\r\ngeneralities, and so shall I. Of the colored citizens of Toronto I know\r\nlittle or nothing; no doubt, some are respectable enough in their way,\r\nand perform the inferior duties belonging to their station tolerably\r\nwell. Here they are kept in order--in their proper place--but their\r\n'proceedings' are evidence of their natural conceit, their vanity, and\r\ntheir ignorance; and in them the cloven foot appears, and evinces what\r\nthey would do, if they could. I believe that in this city, as in some\r\nothers of our Province, they are looked upon as necessary evils, and\r\nonly submitted to because white servants are so scarce. But I now deal\r\nwith these fellows as a body, and I pronounce them to be, as such, the\r\n_greatest curse_ ever inflicted upon the two magnificent western\r\ncounties which I have the honor to represent in the Legislative Council\r\nof this Province! and few men have had the experience of them that I\r\nhave. Among the many _estimable_ qualities they possess, a systematic\r\nhabit of _lying_ is not the least prominent; and the 'colored citizens'\r\naforesaid seem to partake of that quality in an eminent degree, because\r\nin their famous _Resolutions_ they roundly assert that during the\r\nRebellion 'I walked arm and arm with colored men'--that 'I owe my\r\nelection to the votes of colored men'--and that I have 'accumulated much\r\nearthly gains,' as a lawyer, among 'colored clients.' All Lies! Lies!\r\nLies! from beginning to end. I admit that one company of blacks did\r\nbelong to my contingent battalion, but they made the very worst of\r\nsoldiers, and were, comparatively speaking, unsusceptible of drill or\r\ndiscipline, and were conspicuous for one act only--a stupid sentry shot\r\nthe son of one of our oldest colonels, under a mistaken notion that he\r\nwas thereby doing his duty. But I certainly never did myself the honor\r\nof 'walking arm in arm' with any of the colored gentlemen of that\r\ndistinguished corps. Then, as to my election. Few, very few blacks voted\r\nfor me. _I never canvassed them_, and hence, I suppose, they supported,\r\nas a body, my opponent. They took compassion upon '_a monument of\r\ninjured innocence_,' and they sustained the monument for a while, upon\r\nthe pedestal their influence erected. But the monument fell, and the\r\nfall proved that such influence was merely ephemeral, and it sank into\r\ninsignificant nothingness, as it should, and I hope ever will do; or God\r\nhelp this noble land. Poor Blackies! Be not so bold or so conceited, or\r\nso insolent hereafter, I do beseech you.\r\n\r\n\"Then how rich I have become among my 'colored clients!' I assert,\r\nwithout the fear of contradiction, that I have been the friend--the\r\nsteady friend of our western 'Darkies' for more than twenty years; and\r\namidst difficulties and troubles innumerable, (for they are a litigious\r\nrace,) I have been their adviser, and I never made twenty pounds out of\r\nthem in that long period! The fact is that the poor creatures had never\r\nthe ability to pay a lawyer's fee.\r\n\r\n\"It has been my misfortune, and the misfortune of my family, to live\r\namong those blacks, (and they have lived _upon_ us,) for twenty-four\r\nyears. I have employed _hundreds_ of them, and, with the exception of\r\none, (named Richard Hunter,) not one has ever done for us a week's\r\nhonest labor. I have taken them into my service, have fed and clothed\r\nthem, year after year, on their arrival from the States, and in return I\r\nhave generally found them rogues and thieves, and a graceless,\r\nworthless, thriftless, lying set of vagabonds. That is my very plain and\r\nvery simple description of the darkies as a body, and it would be\r\nindorsed by all the western white men with very few exceptions.\r\n\r\n\"I have had scores of their George Washingtons, Thomas Jeffersons, James\r\nMadisons, as well as their Dinahs, and Gleniras, and Lavinias, in my\r\nservice, and I understand them thoroughly, and I include the whole batch\r\n(old Richard Hunter excepted) in the category above described. To\r\nconclude, you 'Gentlemen of color,' East and West, and especially you\r\n'colored citizens of Toronto,' I thank you for having given me an\r\nopportunity to publish my opinion of your race. Call another indignation\r\nmeeting, and there make greater fools of yourselves than you did at the\r\nlast, and then 'to supper with what appetite you may.'\r\n\r\n                      \"Believe me to remain,\r\n                            Mr. Editor,\r\n                       Yours very faithfully,\r\n                                                        =JOHN PRINCE.=\r\n  Toronto, 26th June, 1857.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impracticable to extract the whole of the important facts referred\r\nto in Maj. Lachlan's Report, as it would make a volume of itself. In\r\nmany places he takes occasion to urge the necessity of education for the\r\ncolored people, as the only possible means of their elevation; and also\r\npresses upon the attention of the better classes of that race, the duty\r\nof co-operating with the magistrates in their efforts for the\r\nsuppression of crime, as well as the advantages to be derived from the\r\nformation of associations for their intellectual and moral advancement.\r\nOn the 23d of May, 1847, he addressed the Right Honorable, the Earl of\r\nElgin, the Governor of Canada, on the subject of the causes checking the\r\nprosperity of the Western District, the fourth one of which he states to\r\nbe \"the unfortunate influx into its leading townships of swarms of\r\nrun-away negro slaves, of the worst description, from the American\r\nStates.\" After referring to the facts contained in his report of 1841, a\r\nportion of which are presented in the preceding pages, he says: \"I shall\r\ntherefore rest content with stating, in connection with these extracts,\r\nthe simple fact, that on the Province gradually recovering from the\r\nshock given to immigration by the late rebellion, and the stream of\r\nBritish settlers beginning once more to flow toward the Province, a\r\nconsiderable number of emigrants of the laboring classes made their way\r\nto the Western District, and for some time wandered about in search of\r\nemployment; but with the exception of those who had come to join\r\nrelations and friends, and a few others, the greater portion, finding\r\nthemselves unable to obtain work, from the ground which they naturally\r\nexpected to occupy being already monopolized by negroes, and there being\r\nno public works of any kind on which they could be engaged, became\r\ncompletely disheartened, and were ultimately forced to disperse\r\nthemselves elsewhere; and, most generally, found a refuge in the\r\nneighboring States of Michigan and Ohio. And such, it may be added, has\r\never since continued to be the case; while, on the other hand, the\r\ninflux of negroes has been greatly on the increase. . . . . Far,\r\nhowever, be it for me to suppose it possible to abridge for one moment\r\nthat noble constitutional principle--that slavery and _British Rule_ and\r\n_British feeling are incompatible_; but still I consider it no trifling\r\nevil that any part of an essentially _British_ colony should be thereby\r\nexposed to be made the receptable of the worst portion of the lowest\r\ngrade of the human race, from every part of the American Union, to the\r\nevident serious injury of its own inhabitants, and equally serious\r\nprejudice to the claims of more congenial settlers.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement shows, very clearly, how the negro immigration into\r\nCanada operates injuriously to its prosperity by repelling the white\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\nWhat was true of the colored population of the \"Western District of\r\nCanada, in 1841, while Major Lachlan filled the chair of the Quarter\r\nSessions, seems to be equally true in 1859. The _Essex Advocate_,\r\ncontains the following extract from the Presentment of the Grand Jury,\r\nat the Essex Assizes, November 17, 1859, in reference to the jail: \"We\r\nare sorry to state to your Lordship the great prevalence of the colored\r\nrace among its occupants, and beg to call attention to an accompanying\r\ndocument from the Municipal Council and inhabitants of the Township of\r\nAnderdon, which we recommend to your Lordship's serious consideration.\r\n\r\n\"'_To the Grand Jury of the County of Essex, in Inquest assembled_: We,\r\nthe undersigned inhabitants of the Township of Anderdon, respectfully\r\nwish to call the attention of the Grand Inquest of the County of Essex\r\nto the fearful state of crime in our township. That there exists\r\norganized bands of thieves, too lazy to work, who nightly plunder our\r\nproperty! That nearly all of us, more or less, have suffered losses; and\r\nthat for the last two years the stealing of sheep has been most\r\nalarming, one individual having had nine stolen within that period. We\r\nlikewise beg to call your attention to the fact, that seven colored\r\npersons are committed to stand trial at the present assizes on the\r\ncharge of sheep stealing, and that a warrant is out against the eighth,\r\nall from the Town of Anderdon. We beg distinctly to be understood, that\r\nalthough we are aware that nine-tenths of the crimes committed in the\r\nCounty of Essex, according to the population, are so committed by the\r\ncolored people, yet we willingly extend the hand of fellowship and\r\nkindness to the emancipated slave, whom Great Britain has granted an\r\nasylum to in Canada We therefore hope the Grand Jury of the County of\r\nEssex will lay the statement of our case before his Lordship, the Judge\r\nat the present assizes, that some measure may be taken by the Government\r\nto protect us and our property, or persons of capital will be driven\r\nfrom the country.'\"\r\n\r\nWe find it stated in the _Cincinnati Daily Commercial_, that the \"Court,\r\nin alluding to this presentment, remarked that 'he was not surprised at\r\nfinding prejudice existing against them (the negroes) among the\r\nrespectable portion of the people, for they were indolent, shiftless and\r\ndishonest, and unworthy of the sympathy that some mistaken parties\r\nextended to them; they would not work when opportunity was presented,\r\nbut preferred subsisting by thieving from respectable farmers, and\r\nbegging from those benevolently inclined.'\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1859, Mr. Stanley, a government agent from the West\r\nIndies, visited Canada with the view of inducing the colored people of\r\nthat Province to emigrate to Jamaica. The _Windsor Herald_, in noticing\r\nthe movement, gives the details of the arguments presented, at the\r\nmeeting in Windsor, to influence them to accept the offer. To men of\r\nintelligence and foresight, the reasons would have been convincing; but\r\nupon the minds of the colored people, they seem to have had scarcely any\r\nweight whatever--only one man entering his name, as an emigrant, at the\r\nclose of the lecture. They were assured that in Jamaica they could\r\nobtain employment at remunerative salaries, and in three years become\r\nowners of property, besides possessing all the advantages of British\r\nsubjects. Only a stipulated number were called for at the present time,\r\nthey were told, but if the experiment proved successful, the gates would\r\nbe thrown open for a general emigration. The Governor of the Island\r\nguaranteed them occupations on their arrival, or a certain stipend until\r\nsuch were found, and also their passage thither gratis. Four hundred\r\nemigrants were wanted to commence the experiment, and if they succeeded\r\nin getting the number required, they designed starting for Jamaica in\r\nthe space of a month.\r\n\r\nThe indisposition of the colored people to accept the liberal offer of\r\nthe authorites of Jamaica, created some surprise among the whites; but\r\nthe mystery was explained when the agent visited Chatham, and made\r\nsimilar offers to the colored people of that town. As already stated, in\r\nthe Preface to this work, they not only rejected the offered boon with\r\ncontempt, but gave as their reason, that events would shortly transpire\r\nin the United States, which would demand their aid in behalf of their\r\nfellow countrymen there.[91] This was thirteen days before the Harper's\r\nFerry outbreak, and Chatham was the town in which John Brown and his\r\nassociates concocted their insurrectionary movement. The chief reason\r\nwhy the Jamaica emigration scheme was rejected, must have been the\r\ndetermination of the blacks of Canada to co-operate in the Brown\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nHere, now, are all the results of the Canada experiment, as presented\r\nby the official action of its civil officers and public men. Need it be\r\nsaid, that the prospects of the African race have only been rendered the\r\nmore dark and gloomy, by the conduct of the free colored men of that\r\nProvince. And when we couple the results there with those of the West\r\nIndies, it must be obvious to all, that what has been attempted for the\r\ncolored race is wholly impracticable; that in its present state of\r\nadvancement from barbarism, the attainment of civil and social equality,\r\nwith the enlightened white races, is utterly impossible.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that philanthropists have committed a grave error\r\nin their policy, and the sooner they retrace their steps the better for\r\nthe colored people. The error to which we refer, is this: they found a\r\nsmall portion of colored men, whose intelligence and moral character\r\nequaled that of the average of the white population; and, considering it\r\na great hardship that such men should be doomed to a degraded condition,\r\nthey attempted to raise them up to the civil and social position which\r\ntheir merits would entitle them to occupy. But in attempting to secure\r\nequal rights to the enlightened negro, the philanthropists claimed the\r\nsame privilege for the whole of that race. In this they failed to\r\nrecognize the great truth, that free government is not adapted to men in\r\na condition of ignorance and moral degradation. By taking such broad\r\nground--by securing the largest amount of liberty for a great mass of\r\nthe most degraded of humanity--they have altogether failed in convincing\r\nthe world, that freedom is a boon worth the bestowal upon the African in\r\nhis present condition. The intelligent colored man, who could have been\r\nlifted up to a suitable hight, and maintained his position, if he had\r\nbeen taken alone, could not be elevated at all when the whole race were\r\nfastened to his skirts. And this mistake was a very natural one for men\r\nwho think but superficially. Despotic government is repugnant to\r\nenlightened men: hence, in rejecting it for themselves, they repudiate\r\nit as a form of rule for all others. This decision, plausible as it may\r\nappear, is not consistent with the philosophy of human nature as it now\r\nis; nor is it in accordance with the sentiments of the profound\r\nstatesmen who framed the American Constitution. They held that only men\r\nof intelligence and moral principle were capable of self-government;\r\nand, hence, they excluded from citizenship the barbarous and\r\nsemi-barbarous Indians and Africans, who were around them and in their\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the results of emancipation in the United States, in a\r\npreceding chapter, it is stated that one principal cause, operating to\r\ncheck the further liberation of the slaves, at an early day in our\r\nhistory, was, that freedom had proved itself of little value to the\r\ncolored man, while the measure had greatly increased the burdens of the\r\nwhites; and that until he should make such progress as would prove that\r\nfreedom was the best condition for the race, while intermingled with the\r\nwhites, any further movements toward general emancipation were not to be\r\nexpected. This view is now indorsed by some of the most prominent\r\nabolitionists. Listen to the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher on this subject. In\r\nhis sermon in reference to the Harper's Ferry affair, he says:\r\n\r\n\"If we would benefit the African at the South, we must _begin at home_.\r\nThis is to some men the most disagreeable part of the doctrine of\r\nemancipation. It is very easy to labor for the emancipation of beings a\r\nthousand miles off; but when it comes to the practical application of\r\njustice and humanity to those about us, it is not so easy. The truths of\r\nGod respecting the rights and dignities of men, are just as important to\r\nfree colored men, as to enslaved colored men. It may seem strange for me\r\nto say that the lever with which to lift the load of Georgia is in New\r\nYork; but it is. I do not believe the whole free North can tolerate\r\ngrinding injustice toward the poor, and inhumanity toward the laboring\r\nclasses, without exerting an influence unfavorable to justice and\r\nhumanity in the South. No one can fail to see the inconsistency between\r\nour treatment of those among us, who are in the lower walks of life, and\r\nour professions of sympathy for the Southern slaves. How are the free\r\ncolored people treated at the North? They are almost without education,\r\nwith but little sympathy for their ignorance. They are refused the\r\ncommon rights of citizenship which the whites enjoy. They can not even\r\nride in the cars of our city rail roads. They are snuffed at in the\r\nhouse of God, or tolerated with ill-disguised disgust. Can the black man\r\nbe a mason in New York? Let him be employed as a journeyman, and every\r\nIrish lover of liberty that carries the hod or trowel, would leave at\r\nonce, or compel him to leave! Can the black man be a carpenter? There is\r\nscarcely a carpenter's shop in New York in which a journeyman would\r\ncontinue to work, if a black man was employed in it. Can the black man\r\nengage in the common industries of life? There is scarcely one in which\r\nhe can engage. He is crowded down, down, down through the most menial\r\ncallings, to the bottom of society. We tax them and then refuse to allow\r\ntheir children to go to our public schools. We tax them and then refuse\r\nto sit by them in God's house. We heap upon them moral obloquy more\r\natrocious than that which the master heaps upon the slave. And\r\nnotwithstanding all this, we lift ourselves up to talk to the Southern\r\npeople about the rights and liberties of the human soul, and especially\r\nthe African soul! It is true that slavery is cruel. But it is not at all\r\ncertain that there is not more love to the race in the South than in the\r\nNorth. . . . . . Whenever we are prepared to show toward the lowest, the\r\npoorest, and the most despised, an unaffected kindness, such as led\r\nChrist, though the Lord of glory, to lay aside his dignities and take on\r\nhimself the form of a servant, and to undergo an ignominious death, that\r\nhe might rescue men from ignorance and bondage--whenever we are prepared\r\nto do such things as these, we may be sure that the example at the North\r\nwill not be unfelt at the South. Every effort that is made in Brooklyn\r\nto establish churches for the free colored people, and to encourage them\r\nto educate themselves and become independent, is a step toward\r\nemancipation in the South. The degradation of the free colored men in\r\nthe North will fortify slavery in the South!\"\r\n\r\nWe think we may safely guarantee, that whenever Northern abolitionists\r\nshall carry out Mr. Beecher's scheme, of spending their time and money\r\nfor the moral and intellectual culture of the free colored people, the\r\nSouth will at once emancipate every slave within her limits; because we\r\nwill then be in the midst of the millenium. Intelligent free colored men\r\nwill agree with us in opinion, as they have tested them upon this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nOne point more remains to be noticed:--the influence which the results\r\nin Canada and Jamaica have exerted upon the prospects of the free\r\ncolored man in the United States. We mean, of course, his prospects for\r\nsecuring the civil and social equality to which he has been aspiring.\r\nHis own want of progress has been the main cause of checking the\r\nextension of emancipation. This is now admitted even by Rev. H. W.\r\nBeecher, himself. Then, again, the fact that much less advancement has\r\nbeen made by the negroes in the British Provinces, than by those in the\r\nUnited States, operates still more powerfully in preventing any further\r\nliberation of the slaves. These two causes, combined, have dealt a\r\ndeath-blow to the hope of emancipation, in the South, by any moral\r\ninfluence coming from that quarter; and has, in fact, put back that\r\ncause, so far as the moral power of the negro is concerned, to a period\r\nhopelessly distant. Loyal Britons may urge upon us the duty of\r\nemancipation as strongly as they please; but so long as they denounce\r\nthe influx of colored men as a curse to Canada, just so long they will\r\nfail in persuading Americans that an increase of free negroes will be a\r\nblessing to the United States. The moral power of the free negro, in\r\npromoting emancipation, is at an end; but how is it with his prospects\r\nof success in the employment of force? The Harper's Ferry movement is\r\npronounced, by anti-slavery men themselves, as the work of a madman; and\r\nno other attempt of that kind can be more successful, as none but the\r\ninsane and the ignorant will ever enlist in such an enterprise. The\r\npower of the free colored people in promoting emancipation, say what\r\nthey will, is now at an end.\r\n\r\nBut these are not all the results of the movements noticed. They have\r\nnot only rendered the free colored people powerless in emancipation, but\r\nhave acted most injuriously upon themselves, as a class, in both the\r\nfree and the slave States. In the Northwestern free States, every new\r\nConstitution framed, and every old one amended, with perhaps one\r\nexception, exclude the free negroes from the privileges of citizenship.\r\nIn the slave States, generally, efforts are making not only to prevent\r\nfarther emancipations, but to drive out the free colored population from\r\ntheir territories.\r\n\r\nThus, at this moment, stands the question of the capacity of the free\r\ncolored people of the United States, to influence public opinion in\r\nfavor of emancipation. And where are their champions who kindled the\r\nflame which is now extinguished? Many of them are in their graves; and\r\nthe Harper's Ferry act, but applied the match that exploded the existing\r\norganizations. One chieftain--always truthful, ever in earnest--is,\r\nalas, in the lunatic asylum; another--whose zeal overcomes his judgment,\r\nat times--backs down from the position he had taken, that rifles were\r\nbetter than bibles in the conflict with slavery; another--coveting not\r\nthe martyr's crown, yet a little--has left his editorial chair, to put\r\nthe line dividing English and American territory between himself and\r\ndanger; another--whose life could not well be spared, as he, doubtless,\r\nthought--after helping to organize the conspiracy at Chatham, in\r\nCanada, immediately set out to explore Africa: perhaps to select a home\r\nfor the Virginia slaves, and be ready to receive them when Brown should\r\nset them free. These forces can never be re-combined. As for others, so\r\nfar as politicians are concerned, the colored race have nothing to hope.\r\nThe battle for free territory, in the sense in which they design to be\r\nunderstood, is a contest to keep the blacks and whites entirely\r\nseparate. It is a determination to carry out the policy of Jefferson, by\r\nseparating the races where it can be accomplished--a policy that will be\r\nadhered to in the free States, and which the Canadians would gladly\r\nadopt, if the mother country would permit them to carry out their\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nFree colored men of the United States! \"in the days of adversity\r\nconsider.\" Are not the signs of the times indicative of the necessity of\r\na change of policy?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] The testimony here offered is the more important, as the Western\r\nDistrict is the center of emigration from the United States.\r\n\r\n[90] The Hon.

In\r\nattempting this, we choose not to traverse that interminable labyrinth,\r\nwithout a thread, which includes the moral character of the system, as\r\nit respects the relation between the master and the slave. The only\r\naspect in which we care to consider it, is in the moral relations which\r\nthe consumers of slave labor products sustain to slavery: and even on\r\nthis, we shall offer no opinion, our aim being only to promote inquiry.\r\n\r\nThis view of the question is not an unimportant one. It includes the\r\ngerm of the grand error in nearly all anti-slavery effort; and to which,\r\nchiefly, is to be attributed its want of moral power over the conscience\r\nof the slaveholder. The abolition movement, was designed to create a\r\npublic sentiment, in the United States, that should be equally as potent\r\nin forcing emancipation, as was the public opinion of Great Britain. But\r\nwhy have not the Americans been as successful as the English? This is an\r\ninquiry of great importance. When the Anti-Slavery Convention, which\r\nmet, December 6, 1833, in Philadelphia, declared, as a part of its\r\ncreed: \"That there is no difference in principle, between the African\r\nslave trade, and American slavery,\" it meant to be understood as\r\nteaching, that the person who purchased slaves imported from Africa, or\r\nwho held their offspring as slaves, was _particeps criminis_--partaker\r\nin the crime--with the slave trader, on the principle that he who\r\nreceives stolen property, knowing it be such, is equally guilty with the\r\nthief.\r\n\r\nOn this point Daniel O'Connell was very explicit, when, in a public\r\nassembly, he used this language: \"When an American comes into society,\r\nhe will be asked, 'are you one of the thieves, or are you an honest man?\r\nIf you are an honest man, then you have given liberty to your slaves; if\r\nyou are among the thieves, the sooner you take the outside of the house,\r\nthe better.'\"\r\n\r\nThe error just referred to was this: they based their opposition to\r\nslavery on the principle, that it was _malum in se_--a sin in\r\nitself--like the slave trade, robbery and murder; and, at the same time,\r\ncontinued to use the products of the labor of the slave as though they\r\nhad been obtained from the labor of freemen. But this seeming\r\ninconsistency was not the only reason why they failed to create such a\r\npublic sentiment as would procure the emancipation of our slaves. The\r\nEnglish emancipationists began their work like philosophers--addressing\r\nthemselves, respectfully to the power that could grant their requests.\r\nBeside the moral argument, which declared slavery a crime, the English\r\nphilanthropists labored to convince Parliament, that emancipation would\r\nbe advantageous to the commerce of the nation. The commercial value of\r\nthe Islands had been reduced one-third, as a result of the abolition of\r\nthe slave trade. Emancipation, it was argued, would more than restore\r\ntheir former prosperity, as the labor of freemen was twice as productive\r\nas that of slaves. But American abolitionists commenced their crusade\r\nagainst slavery, by charging those who sustained it, and who alone, held\r\nthe power to manumit, with crimes of the blackest dye. This placed the\r\nparties in instant antagonism, causing all the arguments on human\r\nrights, and the sinfulness of slavery, to fall without effect upon the\r\nears of angry men. The error on this point, consisted in failing to\r\ndiscriminate between the sources of the power over emancipation in\r\nEngland and in the United States. With Great Britain, the power was in\r\nParliament. The masters, in the West Indies, had no voice in the\r\nquestion. It was the voters in England alone who controlled the\r\nelections, and, consequently, controlled Parliament. But the condition\r\nof things in the United States is the reverse of what it was in England.\r\nWith us, the power of emancipation is in the States, not in Congress.\r\nThe slaveholders elect the members to the State Legislatures; and they\r\nchoose none but such as agree with them in opinion. It matters not,\r\ntherefore, what public sentiment may be at the North, as it has no power\r\nover the Legislatures of the South. Here, then, is the difference: with\r\nus the slaveholder controls the question of emancipation, while in\r\nEngland the consent of the master was not necessary to the execution of\r\nthat work.\r\n\r\nOur anti-slavery men seem to have fallen into their errors of policy, by\r\nfollowing the lead of those of England, who manifested a total ignorance\r\nof the relations existing between our General Government and the State\r\nGovernments. On the abolition platform, slaveholders found themselves\r\nplaced in the same category with slave traders and thieves. They were\r\ntold that all laws, giving them power over the slave, were void in the\r\nsight of heaven; and that their appropriation of the fruits of the labor\r\nof the slave, without giving him compensation, was robbery. Had the\r\npreaching of these principles produced conviction, it must have promoted\r\nemancipation. But, unfortunately, while these doctrines were held up to\r\nthe gaze of slaveholders, in the one hand of the exhorter, they beheld\r\nhis other hand stretched out, from beneath his cloak of seeming\r\nsanctity, to clutch the products of the very robbery he was professing\r\nto condemn! Take a fact in proof of this view of the subject.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the declarations of Daniel O'Connell, on behalf of the\r\nEnglish, and by the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Convention, on the part of\r\nAmericans, the British manufacturers were purchasing, annually, about\r\n300,000,000 lbs. of cotton, from the very men denounced as equally\r\ncriminal with slave traders and thieves; and the people of the United\r\nStates were almost wholly dependent upon slave labor for their supplies\r\nof cotton and groceries. It is no matter for wonder, therefore, that\r\nslaveholders, should treat, as fiction, the doctrine that slave labor\r\nproducts are the fruits of robbery, so long as they are purchased\r\nwithout scruple, by all classes of men, in Europe and America. The\r\npecuniary argument for emancipation, that free labor is more profitable\r\nthan slave labor, was also urged here, but was treated as the greatest\r\nabsurdity. The masters had, before their eyes, the evidence of the\r\nfalsity of the assertion, that, if emancipated, the slaves would be\r\ndoubly profitable as free laborers. The reverse was admitted, on all\r\nhands, to be true in relation to our colored people.\r\n\r\nBut this question, of the moral relations which the consumers of slave\r\nlabor products sustain to slavery, is one of too important a nature to\r\nbe passed over without a closer examination; and, beside, it is involved\r\nin less obscurity than the morality of the relation existing between the\r\nmaster and the slave. Its consideration, too, affords an opportunity of\r\ndiscriminating between the different opinions entertained on the broad\r\nquestion of the morality of the institution, and enables us to judge of\r\nthe consistency and conscientiousness of every man, by the standard\r\nwhich he himself adopts.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent opinions, as to the morality of the institution of\r\nslavery, in the United States, may be classified under three heads: 1.\r\nThat it is justified by Scripture example and precept. 2. That it is a\r\ngreat civil and social evil, resulting from ignorance and degradation,\r\nlike despotic systems of government, and may be tolerated until its\r\nsubjects are sufficiently enlightened to render it safe to grant them\r\nequal rights. 3. That it is _malum in se_, like robbery and murder, and\r\ncan not be sustained, for a moment, without sin; and, like sin, should\r\nbe immediately abandoned.\r\n\r\nThose who consider slavery sanctioned by the Bible, conceive that they\r\ncan, consistently with their creed, not only hold slaves, and use the\r\nproducts of slave labor, without doing violence to their consciences,\r\nbut may adopt measures to perpetuate the system. Those who consider\r\nslavery merely a great civil and social evil, a despotism that may\r\nengender oppression, or may not, are of opinion that they may purchase\r\nand use its products, or interchange their own for those of the\r\nslaveholder, as free governments hold commercial and diplomatic\r\nintercourse with despotic ones, without being responsible for the moral\r\nevils connected with the system, But the position of those who believe\r\nslavery _malum in se_, like the slave trade, robbery and murder, is a\r\nvery different one from either of the other classes, as it regards the\r\npurchase and use of slave labor products. Let us illustrate this by a\r\ncase in point.\r\n\r\nA company of men hold a number of their fellow men in bondage under the\r\nlaws of the commonwealth in which they live, so that they can compel\r\nthem to work their plantations, and raise horses, cattle, hogs, and\r\ncotton. These products of the labor of the oppressed, are appropriated\r\nby the oppressors to their own use, and taken into the markets for sale.\r\nAnother company proceed to a community of freemen, on the coast of\r\nAfrica, who have labored voluntarily during the year, seize their\r\npersons, bind them, convey away their horses, cattle, hogs, and cotton,\r\nand take the property to market. The first association represents the\r\nslaveholders; the second a band of robbers. The commodities of both\r\nparties, are openly offered for sale, and every one knows how the\r\nproperty of each was obtained. Those who believe the _per se_ doctrine,\r\nplace both these associations in the same moral category, and call them\r\nrobbers. Judged by this rule, the first band are the more criminal, as\r\nthey have deprived their victims of personal liberty, forced them into\r\nservitude, and then \"despoiled them of the fruits of their labor.\"[92]\r\nThe second band have only deprived their victims of liberty, while they\r\nrobbed them; and thus have committed but two crimes, while the first\r\nhave perpetrated three. These parties attempt to negotiate the sale of\r\ntheir cotton, say in London. The first company dispose of their cargo\r\nwithout difficulty--no one manifesting the slightest scruple at\r\npurchasing the products of slave labor. But the second company are not\r\nso fortunate. As soon as their true character is ascertained, the police\r\ndrag its members to Court, where they are sentenced to Bridewell. In\r\nvain do these robbers quote the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Convention,\r\nand Daniel O'Connell, to prove that their cotton was obtained by means\r\nno more criminal than that of the slaveholders, and that, therefore,\r\njudgment ought to be reversed. The Court will not entertain such a\r\nplea, and they have to endure the penalty of the law. Now, why this\r\ndifference, if slavery be _malum in se_? And if the receiver of stolen\r\nproperty is _particeps criminis_ with the thief, why is it, that the\r\nEnglishman, who should receive and sell the cotton of the robbers, would\r\nrun the risk of being sent to prison with them, while if he acted as\r\nagent of the slaveholders, he would be treated as an honorable man? If\r\nthe master has no moral right to hold his slaves, in what respect can\r\nthe products of their labor differ from the property acquired by\r\nrobbery? And if the property be the fruits of robbery, how can any one\r\nuse it, without violating conscience?\r\n\r\nWe have met with the following sage exposition of the question, in\r\njustification of the use of slave labor products, by those who believe\r\nthe _per se_ doctrine: The master owns the lands, gives his skill and\r\nintelligence to direct the labor, and feeds and clothes the slaves. The\r\nslaves, therefore, are entitled only to a part of the proceeds of their\r\nlabor, while the master is also justly entitled to a part of the crop.\r\nWhen brought into the market, the purchaser can not know what part\r\nbelongs, rightfully, to the master, and what to his slaves, as the whole\r\nis offered in bulk. He may, therefore, purchase the whole, innocently,\r\nand throw the sinfulness of the transaction upon the master, who sells\r\nwhat belongs to others. But if the _per se_ doctrine be true, this\r\napology for the purchaser is not a justification. Where a \"confusion of\r\ngoods\" has been made by one of the owners, so that they can not be\r\nseparated, he who \"confused\" them can have no advantage, in law, from\r\nhis own wrong, but the goods are awarded to the innocent party. On this\r\nwell known principle of law, this most equitable rule, the master\r\nforfeits his right in the property, and the purchaser, knowing the\r\nfacts, becomes a party in his guilt. But aside from this, the \"confusion\r\nof goods,\" by the master, can give him no moral right to dispose of the\r\ninterest of his slaves therein for his own benefit; and the persons\r\npurchasing such property, acquire no moral right to its possession and\r\nuse. These are sound, logical views. The argument offered, in\r\njustification of those who hold that slavery is _malum in se_, is the\r\nstrongest that can be made. It is apparent, then, from a fair analysis\r\nof their own principles, that they are _participes criminis_ with\r\nslaveholders.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the laws regulating the institution of slavery, be morally\r\nnull and void, and not binding on the conscience, then the slaves have a\r\nmoral right to the proceeds of their labor. This right can not be\r\nalienated by any act of the master, but attaches to the property\r\nwherever it may be taken, and to whomsoever it may be sold. This\r\nprinciple, in law, is also well established. The recent decision on the\r\n\"Gardiner fraud,\" confirms it; the Court asserting, that the money paid\r\nout of the Treasury of the United States, under such circumstances,\r\ncontinued its character as the money and property of the United States,\r\nand may be followed into the hands of those who cashed the orders of\r\nGardiner, and subsequently drew the money, but who are not the true\r\nowners of the said fund; and decreeing that the amount of funds, thus\r\nobtained, be collected off the estate of said Gardiner, and off those\r\nwho drew funds from the treasury, on his orders.\r\n\r\nThese principles of law are so well understood, by every man of\r\nintelligence, that we can not conceive how those advocating the _per se_\r\ndoctrines, if sincere, can continue in the constant use of slave grown\r\nproducts, without a perpetual violation of conscience and of all moral\r\nlaw. Taking them under _protest_, against the slavery which produced\r\nthem, is ridiculous. Refusing to fellowship the slaveholder, while\r\neagerly appropriating the products of the labor of the slave, which he\r\nbrings in his hand, is contemptible. The most noted case of the kind, is\r\nthat of the British Committee, who had charge of the preliminary\r\narrangements for the admission of members to the World's Christian\r\nEvangelical Alliance. One of the rules it adopted, but which the\r\nAlliance afterward modified, excluded all American clergymen, suspected\r\nof a want of orthodoxy on the _per se_ doctrine, from seats in that\r\nbody. Their language, to American clergymen, was virtually, \"Stand\r\naside, I am holier than thou;\" while, at the same moment, their\r\nparishioners, the manufacturers, had about completed the purchase of\r\n624,000,000 lbs. of cotton, for the consumption of their mills, during\r\nthe year; the bales of which, piled together, would have reached\r\nmountain-high, displaying, mostly, the brands, \"New Orleans,\" \"Mobile,\"\r\n\"Charleston.\"\r\n\r\nAs not a word was said, by the Committee, against the Englishmen who\r\nwere buying and manufacturing American cotton, the case may be viewed as\r\none in which the fruits of robbery were taken under _protest_ against\r\nthe robbers themselves. To all intelligent men, the conduct of the\r\npeople of Britain, in protesting against slavery, as a system of\r\nrobbery, while continuing to purchase such enormous quantities of the\r\ncotton produced by slaves, appears as Pharasaical as the conduct of the\r\n_conscientious_ Scotchman, in early times, in Eastern Pennsylvania, who\r\nmarried his wife under protest against the constitution and laws of the\r\nGovernment, and especially, against the authority, power, and right of\r\nthe magistrate who had just tied the knot.[93]\r\n\r\nSuch pliable consciences, doubtless, are very convenient in cases of\r\nemergency. But as they relax when selfish ends are to be subserved, and\r\nretain their rigidity only when judging the conduct of others, the\r\ninference is, that the persons possessing them are either hypocritical,\r\nor else, as was acknowledged by Parson D., in similar circumstances,\r\nthey have mistaken their _prejudices_ for their _consciences_.\r\n\r\nSo far as Britain is concerned, she is, manifestly, much more willing to\r\nreceive American slave labor cotton for her factories, than American\r\nrepublican principles for her people. And why so? The profits derived by\r\nher, from the purchase and manufacture of slave labor cotton, constitute\r\nso large a portion of the means of her prosperity, that the Government\r\ncould not sustain itself were the supplies of this article cut off. It\r\nis easy to divine, therefore, why the people of England are boundless in\r\ntheir denunciation of American slavery, while not a single remonstrance\r\ngoes up to the throne, against the importation of American cotton.\r\nShould she exclude it, the act would render her unable to pay the\r\ninterest on her national debt; and many a declaimer against slavery,\r\nlosing his income, would have to go supperless to bed.\r\n\r\nLet us contrast the conduct of a pagan government with that of Great\r\nBritain. When the Emperor of China became fully convinced of his\r\ninability to resist the prowess of the British arms, in the famous\r\n\"Opium War,\" efforts were made to induce him to legalize the traffic in\r\nopium, by levying a duty on its import, that should yield him a heavy\r\nprofit. This he refused to do, and recorded his decision in these\r\nmemorable words:\r\n\r\n\"It is true, I can not prevent the introduction of the flowing poison.\r\nGain-seeking and corrupt men will, for profit and sensuality, defeat my\r\nwishes, but nothing will induce me to derive a revenue from the vice and\r\nmisery of my people.\"[94]\r\n\r\nLet us revert a moment to the case of robbery, before cited, in further\r\nillustration of this subject. The prisoners serve out their term in\r\nBridewell, and, after a year or two, again visit London with a cargo of\r\ncotton. The police recognize them, and they are a second time arraigned\r\nbefore the court for trial. The judge demands why they should have dared\r\nto revisit the soil of England, to offer for sale the products of their\r\nrobbery. The prisoners assure his honor that they have neither outraged\r\nthe public sentiment of the kingdom, nor violated its laws. \"While in\r\nyour prison, sir,\" they go on to say, \"we became instructed in the\r\nmorals of British economics. Anxious to atone for our former fault, and\r\nto restore ourselves to the confidence and respect of the pious subjects\r\nof your most gracious Queen, no sooner were we released from prison,\r\nthan we hastened to the African coast, from whence our former cargo was\r\nobtained, and seizing the self-same men whom we had formerly robbed, we\r\nbore them off, bodily, to the soil of Texas. They resisted sturdily, it\r\nis true, but we mastered them. We touched none of the fruits of their\r\nprevious labors. Their cotton we left in the fields, to be drenched by\r\nthe rains or drifted by the winds; because, to have brought it into your\r\nmarkets would have subjected us, anew, to a place in your dungeons. In\r\nTexas, we brought our prisoners under the control of the laws, which\r\nthere give us power to hold them as slaves. Stimulated to labor, under\r\nthe lash of the overseer, they have produced a crop of cotton, which is\r\nnow offered in your markets as a lawful article of commerce. We are not\r\nsubjects of your Government, and, therefore, not indictable under your\r\nlaws against slave trading. Your honor, will perceive, then, that our\r\nmoral relations are changed. We come now to your shores, not as dealers\r\nin stolen property, but as slaveholders, with the products of slave\r\nlabor. We are aware that _bunkum_ speakers, at your public assemblies,\r\ndenounce the slaveholder as a thief, and his appropriation of the fruits\r\nof the labor of his slaves, as robbery. We comprehend the motives\r\nprompting such utterances. We come not to attend meetings of\r\nEcclesiastical Conventions, representing the republican principles of\r\nAmerica, to unsettle the doctrines upon which the throne of your kingdom\r\nis based. But we come as cotton planters, to supply your looms with\r\ncotton, that British commerce may not be abridged, and England, the\r\ngreat civilizer of the world, may not be forced to slack her pace in the\r\nperformance of her mission. This is our character and position; and your\r\nhonor will at once see that it is your duty, and the interest of your\r\nGovernment, to treat us as gentlemen and your most faithful allies.\" The\r\njudge at once admits the justice of their plea, rebukes the police,\r\napologizes to the prisoners, assures them that they have violated no law\r\nof the realm; and that, though the public sentiment of the nation\r\ndenounces the slaveholder as a thief, yet the public necessity demands a\r\nfull supply of cotton from the planter. He then orders their immediate\r\ndischarge, and invites them to partake of the hospitalities of his house\r\nduring their stay in London.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair example of British consistency, on the subject of\r\nslavery, so far as the supply of cotton is concerned. The English\r\nmanufacturers are under the absolute necessity of procuring it; but as\r\nfree labor is incapable of increasing its production, slave labor must\r\nbe made to remedy the defect.\r\n\r\nThe reason can now be clearly comprehended, why abolitionists have had\r\nso little moral power over the conscience of the slaveholder. Their\r\npractice has been inconsistent with their precepts; or, at least, their\r\nconduct has been liable to this construction. Nor do we perceive how\r\nthey can exert a more potent influence, in the future, unless their\r\nenergies are directed to efforts such as will relieve them from a\r\nposition so inconsistent with their professions, as that of constantly\r\npurchasing products which they, themselves, declare to be the fruits of\r\nrobbery. While, therefore, things remain as they are, with the world so\r\nlargely dependent upon slave labor, how can it be otherwise, than that\r\nthe system will continue to flourish? And while its products are used by\r\nall classes, of every sentiment, and country, nearly, how can the\r\nslaveholder be brought to see any thing, in the practice of the world,\r\nto alarm his conscience, and make him cringe, before his fellow-men, as\r\na guilty robber?\r\n\r\nBut, has nothing worse occurred from the advocacy of the _per se_\r\ndoctrine, than an exhibition of inconsistency on the part of\r\nabolitionists, and the perpetuation of slavery resulting from their\r\nconduct? This has occurred. Three highly respectable religious\r\ndenominations, now limited to the North, had once many flourishing\r\ncongregations in the South. On the adoption of the _per se_ doctrine, by\r\ntheir respective Synods, their congregations became disturbed, were soon\r\nafter broken up, or the ministers in charge had to seek other fields of\r\nlabor. Their system of religious instruction, for the family, being\r\nquite thorough, the slaves were deriving much advantage from the\r\ninfluence of these bodies. But when they resolved to withhold the gospel\r\nfrom the master, unless he would emancipate, they also withdrew the\r\nmeans of grace from the slave; and, so far as they were concerned, left\r\nhim to perish eternally! Whether this course was proper, or whether it\r\nwould have been better to have passed by the morality of the legal\r\nrelation, in the creation of which the master had no agency, and\r\nconsidered him, under Providence, as the moral guardian of the slave,\r\nbound to discharge a guardian's duty to an immortal being, we shall not\r\nundertake to determine. Attention is called to the facts, merely to show\r\nthe practical effects of the action of these churches upon the slave,\r\nand what the _per se_ doctrine has done in depriving him of the gospel.\r\n\r\nAnother remark, and we have done with this topic. Nothing is more\r\ncommon, in certain circles, than denunciations of the Christian men and\r\nministers, who refuse to adopt the _per se_ principle. We leave others\r\nto judge whether these censures are merited. One thing is certain: those\r\nwho believe that slavery is a great civil and social evil, entailed upon\r\nthe country, and are extending the gospel to both master and slave, with\r\nthe hope of removing it peacefully, can not be reproached with acting\r\ninconsistently with their principles; while those who declare slavery\r\n_malum in se_, and refuse to fellowship the Christian slaveholder,\r\nbecause they consider him a robber, but yet use the products of slave\r\nlabor, may fairly be classified, on their own principles, with the\r\nhypocritical people of Israel, who were thus reproached by the Most\r\nHigh: \"What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou\r\nshouldst take my covenant in thy mouth? . . . . . When thou sawest a\r\nthief, then thou consentedst with him.\"[95]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[92] This is the phrase, nearly verbatim, used by Mr. Sumner in his\r\nspeech on the Fugitive Slave Bill. Language, a little more to the point,\r\nis used in \"The Friendly Remonstrance of the People of Scotland, on the\r\nSubject of Slavery,\" published in the _American Missionary_, September,\r\n1855. In depicting slavery it speaks of it as a system \"which robs its\r\nvictims of the fruits of their toil.\"\r\n\r\n[93] An anecdote, illustrative of the pliability of some consciences, of\r\nthis apparently rigid class, where interest or inclination demands it,\r\nhas often been told by the late Governor Morrow, of Ohio. An old Scotch\r\n\"Cameronian,\" in Eastern Pennsylvania, became a widower, shortly after\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution of the United States. He refused to\r\nacknowledge either the National or State Government, but pronounced them\r\nboth unlawful, unrighteous, and ungodly. Soon he began to feel the want\r\nof a wife, to care for his motherless children. The consent of a woman\r\nin his own Church was gained, because to take any other would have been\r\nlike an Israelite marrying a daughter of the land of Canaan. On this\r\npoint, as in refusing to swear allegiance to Government, he was\r\ncontrolled by conscience. But now a practical difficulty presented\r\nitself. There was no minister of his Church in the country--and those of\r\nother denominations, in his judgment, had no Divine warrant for\r\nexercising the functions of the sacred office. He repudiated the whole\r\nof them. But how to get married, that was the problem. He tried to\r\npersuade his intended to agree to a marriage contract, before witnesses,\r\nwhich could be confirmed whenever a proper minister should arrive from\r\nScotland. But his \"lady-love\" would not consent to the plan. She must be\r\nmarried \"like other folk,\" or not at all--because \"people would talk\r\nso.\" The Scotchman for want of a wife, like Great Britain for want of\r\ncotton, saw very plainly that his children must suffer; and so he\r\nresolved to get married at all hazards, as England buys her cotton, but\r\nso as not to violate conscience. Proceeding with his intended to a\r\nmagistrate's office, the ceremony was soon performed, and they twain\r\npronounced \"one flesh.\" But no sooner had he \"kissed the bride,\" the\r\nsealing act of the contract at that day, than the good Cameronian drew a\r\nwritten document from his pocket, which he read aloud before the officer\r\nand witnesses; and in which he entered his solemn protest against the\r\nauthority of the Government of the United States, against that of the\r\nState of Pennsylvania, and especially against the power, right, and\r\nlawfulness of the acts of the magistrate who had just married him. This\r\ndone, he went his way, rejoicing that he had secured a wife without\r\nrecognizing the lawfulness of ungodly governments, or violating his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n[94] _National Intelligencer_, 1854.\r\n\r\n[95] Psalm 1: 16, 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN concluding our labors, there is little need of extended observation.\r\nThe work of emancipation, in our country, was checked, and the extension\r\nof slavery promoted:--first, by the neglect of the free colored people\r\nto improve the advantages afforded them; second, by the increasing value\r\nimparted to slave labor; third, by the mistaken policy into which the\r\nEnglish and American abolitionists have fallen. Whatever reasons might\r\nnow be offered for emancipation, from an improvement of our free colored\r\npeople, is far more than counterbalanced by its failure in the West\r\nIndies, and the constantly increasing value of the labor of the slave.\r\nIf, when the planters had only a moiety of the markets for cotton, the\r\nvalue of slavery was such as to arrest emancipation, how must the\r\nobstacles be increased, now, when they have the monopoly of the markets\r\nof the world? And, besides all this, a more deadly blow, than has been\r\ngiven by all other causes combined, is now levelled at negro freedom\r\nfrom a quarter the least suspected. The failure of the Canadian\r\nimmigrants to improve the privileges afforded them under British law,\r\nproves, conclusively, that the true laws of progress for the African\r\nrace, do not consist in a mere escape from slavery.\r\n\r\nWe propose not to speak of remedies for slavery. That we leave to\r\nothers. Thus far this very perplexing question, has baffled all human\r\nwisdom. Either some radical defect must have existed, in the measures\r\ndevised for its removal, or the time has not yet come for successfully\r\nassailing the institution. Our work is completed, in the delineation we\r\nhave given of its varied relations to our agricultural, commercial, and\r\nsocial interests. As the monopoly of the culture of cotton, imparts to\r\nslavery its economical value, the system will continue as long as this\r\nmonopoly is maintained. Slave labor products have now become necessities\r\nof human life, to the extent of more than half the commercial articles\r\nsupplied to the Christian world. Even free labor, itself, is made\r\nlargely subservient to slavery, and vitally interested in its\r\nperpetuation and extension.\r\n\r\nCan this condition of things be changed? It may be reasonably doubted,\r\nwhether any thing efficient can be speedily accomplished: not because\r\nthere is lack of territory where freemen may be employed in tropical\r\ncultivation, as all Western and Central Africa, nearly, is adapted to\r\nthis purpose; not because intelligent free labor, under proper\r\nincentives, is less productive than slave labor; but because freemen,\r\nwhose constitutions are adapted to tropical climates, will not avail\r\nthemselves of the opportunity offered for commencing such an enterprise.\r\n\r\nKING COTTON cares not whether he employs slaves or freemen. It is the\r\n_cotton_, not the _slaves_, upon which his throne is based. Let freemen\r\ndo his work as well, and he will not object to the change. The efforts\r\nof his most powerful ally, Great Britain, to promote that object, have\r\nalready cost her people many hundreds of millions of dollars, with total\r\nfailure as a reward for her zeal; and she is now compelled to resort to\r\nthe expedient of employing the slave labor of Africa, to meet the\r\nnecessities of her manufacturers. One-sixth of the colored people of the\r\nUnited States are free; but they shun the cotton regions, and have been\r\ninstructed to detest emigration to Liberia. Their improvement has not\r\nbeen such as was anticipated; and their more rapid advancement can not\r\nbe expected, while they remain in the country. The free colored people\r\nof the British West Indies, can no longer be relied on to furnish\r\ntropical products, for they are resting contented in a state of almost\r\nsavage indolence; and the introduction of coolie labor has become\r\nindispensable as a means of saving the Islands from ruin, as well as of\r\nforcing the negro into habits of industry. Hayti is not in a more\r\npromising condition; and even if it were, its population and territory\r\nare too limited to enable it to meet the increasing demand. HIS MAJESTY,\r\nKING COTTON, therefore, is forced to continue the employment of his\r\nslaves; and, by their toil, is riding on, conquering and to conquer! He\r\nreceives no check from the cries of the oppressed, while the citizens of\r\nthe world are dragging forward his chariot, and shouting aloud his\r\npraise!\r\n\r\nKING COTTON is a profound statesman, and knows what measures will best\r\nsustain his throne. He is an acute mental philosopher, acquainted with\r\nthe secret springs of human action, and accurately perceives who can\r\nbest promote his aims. He has no evidence that colored men can grow his\r\ncotton, except in the capacity of slaves. Thus far, all experiments made\r\nto increase the production of cotton, by emancipating the slaves\r\nemployed in its cultivation, have been a total failure. It is his\r\npolicy, therefore, to defeat all schemes of emancipation. To do this, he\r\nstirs up such agitations as lure his enemies into measures that will do\r\nhim no injury. The venal politician is always at his call, and assumes\r\nthe form of saint or sinner, as the service may demand. Nor does he\r\noverlook the enthusiast, engaged in Quixotic endeavors for the relief of\r\nsuffering humanity, but influences him to advocate measures which tend\r\nto tighten, instead of loosing the bands of slavery. Or, if he can not\r\nbe seduced into the support of such schemes, he is beguiled into efforts\r\nthat waste his strength on objects the most impracticable; so that\r\nslavery receives no damage from the exuberance of his philanthropy. But\r\nshould such a one, perceiving the futility of his labors, and the evils\r\nof his course, make an attempt to avert the consequences; while he is\r\ndoing this, some new recruit, pushed forward into his former place,\r\ncharges him with lukewarmness, or pro-slavery sentiments, destroys his\r\ninfluence with the public, keeps alive the delusions, and sustains the\r\nsupremacy of KING COTTON in the world.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the economical connections of slavery, with the other\r\nmaterial interests of the world, we have called it a _tripartite\r\nalliance_. It is more than this. It is _quadruple_. Its structure\r\nincludes four parties, arranged thus: The Western Agriculturists; the\r\nSouthern Planters; the English Manufacturers; and the American\r\nAbolitionists! By this arrangement, the abolitionists do not stand in\r\ndirect contact with slavery; they imagine, therefore, that they have\r\nclean hands and pure hearts, so far as sustaining the system is\r\nconcerned. But they, no less than their allies, aid in promoting the\r\ninterests of slavery. Their sympathies are with England on the slavery\r\nquestion, and they very naturally incline to agree with her on other\r\npoints. She advocates _Free Trade_, as essential to her manufactures and\r\ncommerce; and they do the same, not waiting to inquire into its bearings\r\nupon _American slavery_. We refer now to the people, not to their\r\nleaders, whose integrity we choose not to indorse. The free trade and\r\nprotective systems, in their bearings upon slavery, are so well\r\nunderstood, that no man of general reading, especially an editor, or\r\nmember of Congress, who professes anti-slavery sentiments, at the same\r\ntime advocating free trade, will ever convince men of intelligence,\r\npretend what he may, that he is not either woefully perverted in his\r\njudgment, or emphatically, a \"dough-face\" in disguise! England, we were\r\nabout to say, is in alliance with the cotton planter, to whose\r\nprosperity free trade is indispensable. Abolitionism is in alliance with\r\nEngland. All three of these parties, then, agree in their support of the\r\nfree trade policy. It needed but the aid of the Western farmer,\r\ntherefore, to give permanency to this principle. His adhesion has been\r\ngiven, the _quadruple alliance_ has been perfected, and slavery and free\r\ntrade _nationalized_!\r\n\r\nSlavery, thus intrenched in the midst of such powerful allies, and\r\nwithout competition in tropical cultivation, has become the sole\r\nreliance of KING COTTON. Lest the sources of his aggrandisement should\r\nbe assailed, we can well imagine him as being engaged constantly, in\r\ndevising new questions of agitation, to divert the public from all\r\nattempts to abandon free trade and restore the protective policy. He now\r\nfinds an ample source of security, in this respect, in agitating the\r\nquestion of slavery extension. This exciting topic, as we have said,\r\nserves to keep politicians of the abolition school at the North in his\r\nconstant employ. But for the agitation of this subject, few of these men\r\nwould succeed in obtaining the suffrages of the people. Wedded to\r\nEngland's free trade policy, their votes in Congress, on all questions\r\naffecting the tariff, are always in perfect harmony with Southern\r\ninterests, and work no mischief to the system of slavery. If Kansas\r\ncomes into the Union as a slave State, he is secure in the political\r\npower it will give him in Congress; but if it is received as a free\r\nState, it will still be tributary to him, as a source from whence to\r\ndraw provisions to feed his slaves. Nor does it matter much which way\r\nthe controversy is decided, so long as all agree not to disturb slavery\r\nin the States where it is already established by law. Could KING COTTON\r\nbe assured that this position will not be abandoned, he would care\r\nlittle about slavery in Kansas; but he knows full well that the public\r\nsentiment in the North is adverse to the system, and that the present\r\nrace of politicians may readily be displaced by others who will pledge\r\nthemselves to its overthrow in all the States of the Union, Hence he\r\nwills to retain the power over the question in his own hands.\r\n\r\nThe crisis now upon the country, as a consequence of slavery having\r\nbecome dominant, demands that the highest wisdom should be brought to\r\nthe management of national affairs. Slavery, nationalized, can now be\r\nmanaged only as a national concern. It can now be abolished only with\r\nthe consent of those who sustain it. Their assent can be gained only by\r\nemploying other agents to meet the wants it now supplies. It must be\r\nsuperseded, then, if at all, by means that will not injuriously affect\r\nthe interests of commerce and agriculture, to which it is now so\r\nimportant an auxiliary. None other will be accepted, for a moment, by\r\nthe slaveholder. To supply the existing demand for tropical products,\r\nexcept by the present mode, is impossible. To make the change, is not\r\nthe work of a day, nor of a generation. Should the influx of foreigners\r\ncontinue, such a change may, one day, be possible. But to effect the\r\ntransition from slavery to freedom, on principles that will be\r\nacceptable to the parties who control the question; to devise and\r\nsuccessfully sustain such measures as will produce this result; must be\r\nleft to statesmen of broader views and loftier conceptions than are to\r\nbe found among those at present engaged in this great controversy.\r\n\r\nTake a more particular view of this subject, in the light of the\r\ncommercial operations of the United States, for the year 1859, as best\r\nindicating the relations of the North and the South, and their mutual\r\ndependence upon each other. The total value of the imports of foreign\r\ncommodities, including specie, was $338,768,130.[96] Of this $20,895,077\r\nwere re-exported, leaving for home consumption, $317,873,053--an amount\r\nmore than eleven times greater than the whole foreign commerce of Great\r\nBritain one hundred and fifty-six years ago, and more than four times\r\ngreater than her exports eighty-six years ago.[97]\r\n\r\nLet us inquire how this immense foreign commerce is sustained; how these\r\n$317,873,000 of foreign imports are paid for by the American people; and\r\nhow far the Northern and Southern States respectively have contributed\r\nto its payment. More than one-half the amount, or $161,434,923, was paid\r\nin raw cotton, and more than one-third of the remainder, or $57,502,305,\r\nin the precious metals; leaving less than $100,000,000 to be paid in the\r\nother productions of the country. More than one-third of this remainder\r\nwas paid in cotton fabrics, tobacco, and rice; while the products of the\r\nforest, of the sea, and of various minor manufactures, swelled up our\r\ncredits, so that the exports of breadstuffs and provisions, needed to\r\nliquidate the debt, only amounted to a little over $38,000,000.[98] Of\r\nthis amount the exports, from the Northern States, of wheat and wheat\r\nflour, made up only $15,262,769, and the corn and corn meal but\r\n$2,206,396. \"King Hay,\" so much lauded for his magnitude and money\r\nvalue, never once ventured on board a merchant vessel, to seek a foreign\r\nland, so as to aid in paying for the commodities which we imported.[99]\r\nIn a word, the products of the forest and of agriculture, exported by\r\nthe free States, amounted in value to about $45,300,000; while the same\r\nclasses of products, supplied for export by the Slave States, amounted\r\nto more than $193,400,000.[100]\r\n\r\nThe economical relations of the North and the South can now be\r\nunderstood more clearly than they could be from the statistics referred\r\nto in the body of this work. The facts, in relation to the commerce of\r\nthe United States, for 1859, were not accessible until after the\r\nstereotyping had been completed; and they are only crowded in here by\r\nomitting two or three pages of remarks of another kind, but of less\r\nimportance, which closed the volume. By consulting Table XII, and two or\r\nthree of the others, which contain similar facts, covering the\r\ncommercial operations of the country since the year 1821, the whole\r\nquestion of the relations of the North and the South can be fully\r\ncomprehended. It will be seen that the exports of tobacco, which are\r\nmainly from the South, have equaled in value considerably more than\r\none-third the amount of that of breadstuffs and provisions; and that, in\r\nthe same period, the exports of cotton have exceeded in value those of\r\nbreadstuffs and provisions to the amount of $1,421,482,261.[101] Here,\r\nnow, a just conception can be formed of the importance of cotton to the\r\ncommerce of the country, as compared with our other productions. The\r\namount exported, of that article, in the last thirty-nine years, has\r\nexceeded in value the exports of breadstuffs and provisions to the\r\nextent of _fourteen hundred and twenty-one millions of dollars_! Verily,\r\nCotton is King!\r\n\r\nAnother point needs consideration. It is a fact, not to be questioned,\r\nthat the productions of the Northern States amount to an immense sum,\r\nabove those of the Southern States, when valued in dollars and cents;\r\nbut the proportion of the products of the former; exported to foreign\r\ncountries, is very insignificant, indeed, when compared with the value\r\nof the exports from the latter.[102] And, yet, the North is acquiring\r\nwealth with amazing rapidity. This fact could not exist, unless the\r\nNorthern people produce more than they consume--unless they have a\r\nsurplus to sell, after supplying their own wants. They must, therefore,\r\nfind a permanent and profitable market, somewhere, for the surplus\r\nproducts that yield them their wealth. As that market is not in Europe,\r\nit must be in the Southern States. But the extent to which the South\r\nreceive their supplies from the North, cannot be determined by any data\r\nnow in the possession of the public. It must, however, be very large in\r\namount, and, if withheld, would greatly embarrass the Southern people,\r\nby lessening their ability to export as largely as hitherto. So, on the\r\nother hand, if the Northern people were deprived of the markets afforded\r\nby the South, they would find so little demand elsewhere for their\r\nproducts, that it would have a ruinous effect upon their prosperity. All\r\nthat can be safely said upon this subject is, that the interests of both\r\nsections of the country are so intimately connected, so firmly blended\r\ntogether, that a dissolution of the Union would be destructive to all\r\nthe economical interests of both the North and the South. Cut off from\r\nthe South all that the North supplies to the planters, in such articles\r\nas agricultural implements, furniture, clothing, provisions, horses, and\r\nmules, and cotton culture would at once have to be abandoned to a great\r\nextent. But would the South alone be the sufferer? Could the Northern\r\nagriculturist, manufacturer, and mechanic, remain prosperous, and\r\ncontinue to accumulate wealth, without a market for their products?\r\nCould Northern merchants dwell in their palaces, and roll in luxury,\r\nwith a foreign commerce contracted to one-third of its present extent,\r\nand a domestic demand for merchandize reduced to one-half its present\r\namount? Certainly not.\r\n\r\nAnd if the mere necessity of self supply, of food and clothing, such as\r\nexisted in 1820, would now be disastrous to the South, and react\r\ndestructively upon the North, what would be the effect of emancipation\r\nupon the country at large? What would be the effect of releasing from\r\nrestraint three and a half millions of negroes, to bask in idleness,\r\nunder the genial sunshine of the South, or to emigrate hither and\r\nthither, at will, with none to control their actions? It is too late to\r\ninsist that free labor would be more profitable than slave labor, when\r\nnegroes are to be the operatives: Jamaica has solved that problem. It is\r\ntoo late to claim that white labor could be made to take the place of\r\nblack labor, while the negroes remain upon the ground: Canada, and the\r\nNorthern States, demonstrate that the two races cannot be made to labor\r\ntogether peacefully and upon terms of equality. Nothing is more certain,\r\ntherefore, than that emancipation would inevitably place the Southern\r\nStates in a similar position to that of Jamaica. On this point take a\r\nfact or two.\r\n\r\nThe _Colonial Standard_,[103] of the 13th January, 1859, in speaking of\r\nthe present industrial condition of that Island, says, that there are\r\nnot more than twenty thousand laborers who employ themselves in sugar\r\ncultivation for wages. This will seem astonishing to those who expected\r\nso much from emancipation, when it is stated that the black population\r\nof Jamaica, when liberated from slavery, numbered three hundred and\r\neleven thousand, six hundred and ninety two; and that the exports of\r\nsugar from the Island, in 1805, before the slave trade was prohibited,\r\namounted to 237,751,150 lbs.;[104] while, in 1859, the exports of that\r\nstaple commodity, only amounted to 44,800,000 lbs.[105] It will thus be\r\nseen that the exports of sugar from Jamaica is now less than one-fifth\r\nof what it was in the prosperous days of slavery; and so it must be as\r\nto cotton, in the South, were emancipation forced upon this country. And\r\nwhat would be the condition of our foreign commerce, and what the effect\r\nupon the country, generally, were the exports of the South diminished to\r\nless than one-fifth of their present amount? Would the lands of the\r\nNorthern farmers still continue to advance in price, if the markets for\r\nthe surplus products of the soil no longer existed? Would those of the\r\nSouthern planters rise in value, in the event of emancipation, to an\r\nequality with the lands at the North, when no laborers could be found to\r\ntill the soil? No man entitled to the name of statesman--no man of\r\npractical common sense--could imagine that such a result would follow\r\nthe liberation of the slaves in the Southern States. Under the\r\nphilanthropic legislation of Great Britain, no such result followed the\r\npassage of the act for the abolition of slavery in her colonies; but, on\r\nthe contrary, the value of their real estate soon became reduced to a\r\nmost ruinous extent; and such must inevitably be the result under the\r\nadoption of similar measures in the United States. This is the\r\nconviction of the men of the South, and they will act upon their own\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThere are strong indications that the views presented in the first\r\nedition of this work, and reported in the subsequent issues, are rapidly\r\nbecoming the views of intelligent and unprejudiced men everywhere. At a\r\nlate date in the British Parliament, Lord Brougham made a strong\r\nanti-American cotton and anti-American slavery speech. The _London\r\nTimes_, thus \"takes the backbone all out of his argument, and leaves\r\nhim nothing but his sophistries to stand on,\" thus:\r\n\r\n\"Lord Brougham and the veterans of the old Anti-Slavery Society do not\r\nshare our delight at this great increase in the employment of our home\r\npopulation. Their minds are still seared by those horrible stories which\r\nwere burnt in upon them in their youth, when England was not only a\r\nslave-owning, but even a slave-trading State. Their remorse is so great\r\nthat the ghost of a black man is always before them. They are benevolent\r\nand excellent people; but if a black man happened to have broken his\r\nshin, and a white man were in danger of drowning, we much fear that a\r\nreal anti-slavery zealot would bind up the black man's leg before he\r\nwould draw the white man out of the water. It is not an inconsistency,\r\ntherefore, that while we see only cause of congratulation in this\r\nwonderful increase of trade, Lord Brougham sees in it the exaggeration\r\nof an evil he never ceases to deplore.\r\n\r\n\"We, and such as we, who are content to look upon society as Providence\r\nallows it to exist--to mend it when we can, but not to distress\r\nourselves immoderately for evils which are not of our creation--we see\r\nonly the free and intelligent English families who thrive upon the wages\r\nwhich these cotton bales produce. Lord Brougham sees only the black\r\nlaborers who, on the other side of the Atlantic, pick the cotton pods in\r\nslavery. Lord Brougham deplores that in this tremendous exportation of a\r\nthousand millions of pounds of cotton, the lion's share of the profits\r\ngoes to the United States, and has been produced by slave labor. Instead\r\nof twenty-three millions, the United States now send us eight hundred\r\nand thirty millions, and this is all cultivated by slaves. It is very\r\nsad that this should be so, but we do not see our way to a remedy. There\r\nseems to be rather a chance of its becoming worse.\r\n\r\n\"If France, who is already moving onwards in a restless, purblind state,\r\nshould open her eyes wide, should give herself fair-play, by accepting\r\nour coals, iron, and machinery, and, under the stimulus of a wholesome\r\ncompetition, should take to manufacturing upon a large scale, even these\r\nthree millions of slaves will not be enough. France will be competing\r\nwith us in the foreign cotton markets, stimulating still further the\r\nproduce of Georgia and South Carolina. The jump which the consumption of\r\ncotton in England has just made is but a single leap, which may be\r\nrepeated indefinitely. There are a thousand millions of mankind on the\r\nglobe, all of whom can be most comfortably clad in cotton. Every year\r\nnew tribes and new nations are added to the category of cotton-wearers.\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the supply of this universal\r\nnecessity will, for many years yet to come, fail to keep pace with the\r\ndemand, and in the interest of that large class of our countrymen to\r\nwhom cotton is bread, we must continue to hope that the United States\r\nwill be able to supply us in years to come with twice as much as we\r\nbought of them in years past. 'Let us raise up another market,' says the\r\nanti-slavery people. So say we all. . . . . .\r\n\r\n\"But even Lord Brougham would not ask us to believe that there is any\r\nproximate hope that the free cotton raised in Africa will, within any\r\nreasonable time, drive out of culture the slave-grown cotton of America.\r\nIf this be so, of what use can it be to make irritating speeches in the\r\nHouse of Lords against a state of things by which we are content to\r\nprofit? Lord Brougham and Lord Grey are not men of such illogical minds\r\nas to be incapable of understanding that it is the demand of the English\r\nmanufacturers which stimulates the produce of slave-grown American\r\ncotton. They are, neither of them, we apprehend, so reckless or so\r\nwicked as to close our factories and to throw some two millions of our\r\nmanufacturing population out of bread. Why, then, these inconsequent and\r\nthese irritating denunciations? Let us create new fields of produce of\r\nwe can; but, meanwile, it is neither just nor dignified to buy the raw\r\nmaterial from the Americans, and to revile them for producing it.\"\r\n\r\nWe have said that the more popular belief, in reference to the moral\r\ncharacter of slavery, now prevailing throughout the world, ranks it as\r\nidentical in principle with despotic forms of government. Here arises a\r\nquestion of importance. Can despotism be acknowledged by Christians as a\r\nlawful form of government? Those who hold the view of slavery under\r\nconsideration, answer in the affirmative. The necessity of civil\r\ngovernment, they say, is denied by none. Society can not exist in its\r\nabsence. Republicanism can be sustained only where the majority are\r\nintelligent and moral. In no other condition can free government be\r\nmaintained. Hence, despotism establishes itself, of necessity, more or\r\nless absolutely, over an ignorant or depraved people; obtaining the\r\nacquiescence of the enlightened, by offering them security to person and\r\nproperty. Few nations, indeed, possess moral elevation sufficient to\r\nmaintain republicanism. Many have tried it, have failed, and relapsed\r\ninto despotism. Republican nations, therefore, must forego all\r\nintercourse with despotic governments, or acknowledge them to be lawful.\r\nThis can be done, it is claimed, without being accountable for moral\r\nevils connected with their administration. Elevated examples of such\r\nrecognitions are on record. Christ paid tribute to Cæsar; and Paul, by\r\nappealing to Cæsar's tribunal, admitted the validity of the despotic\r\ngovernment of Rome, with its thirty millions of slaves. To deny the\r\nlawfulness of despotism, and yet hold intercourse with such governments,\r\nis as inconsistent as to hold the _per se_ doctrine, in regard to\r\nslavery, and still continue to use its products.\r\n\r\nHow far masters in general escape the commission of sin, in the\r\ntreatment of their slaves, or whether any are free from guilt, is not\r\nthe point at issue, in this view of slavery. The mere possession of\r\npower over the slave, under the sanction of law, is held not to be\r\nsinful; but, like despotism, may be used for the good of the governed.\r\nThat Southern masters are laboring for the good of the slave, to an\r\nencouraging extent, is apparent from the missionary efforts they are\r\nsustaining among the slave population. And when it is considered that\r\nthe African race, under American slavery, have made much greater\r\nprogress than they have ever done in any other part of the world; and\r\nthat the elevating influences are now greatly increased among them; it\r\nis to be expected that dispassionate men will be disposed to leave the\r\npresent condition of things undisturbed, rather than to rush madly into\r\nthe adoption of measures that may prove fatal to the existence of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] See Table XII, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n[97] See Speech of Edmund Burke, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n[98] See Table VIII, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n[99] It has been denied that \"Cotton is King,\" and claimed that Hay is\r\nentitled to that royal appellation; because its estimated value exceeds\r\nthat of Cotton. The imperial character of Cotton rests upon the fact,\r\nthat it enters so largely into the manufactures, trade, and commerce of\r\nthe world, while hay is only in demand at home.\r\n\r\n[100] See Table XII, in Appendix, for the statistics on this subject.\r\n\r\n[101] See Table VIII, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n[102] See Table XII.\r\n\r\n[103] This paper is published at Kingston, Jamaica, and in confirmation\r\nof the views of the _London Economist_, quoted in the body of the work,\r\nthe following extract is copied from its columns:\r\n\r\n\"Barbadoes, we all know, is prosperous because she possesses a native\r\npopulation almost as dense as that of China, with a very limited extent\r\nof superficial soil. In Barbadoes, therefore, population presses on the\r\nmeans of subsistence, in the same way, if not to the same extent, as in\r\nEngland, and the people are industrious from necessity. Trinidad and\r\nBritish Guiana, on the other hand, have taken steps to produce this\r\npressure artificially, by large importations of foreign labor. The\r\nformer colony, by the importation of eleven thousand coolies, has\r\ntrebled her crops since 1854, while the latter has doubled hers by the\r\nintroduction of twenty-three thousand immigrants.\r\n\r\n\"While Jamaica is the single instance of retrogression, she affords also\r\nthe solitary example of non-immigration.\r\n\r\n\"Mauritius, by importing something like one hundred and seventy thousand\r\nlaborers, has increased her exports of sugar from 70,000,000 lbs. in\r\n1844, to 250,000,000 lbs. in 1858. Jamaica, by depending wholly on\r\nnative labor, has fallen from an export of 69,000 hhds. in 1848, to one\r\nof 28,000 hhds. in 1859.\r\n\r\n\"It is believed that there are not at this moment above twenty thousand\r\nlaborers who employ themselves in sugar cultivation for wages.\"\r\n\r\n[104] Martin's British Colonies.

See foot note on page 222.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nEARLY MOVEMENTS IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES ON THE SLAVERY QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSENTIMENTS have been quoted from the proceedings of the public meetings\r\nheld by the fathers of the Revolution, which, when taken in connection\r\nwith the language of the Declaration of Independence, seem to favor the\r\nopinion that it was their purpose to extend to the colored people all\r\nthe privileges to be secured by that struggle. An examination of the\r\nhistorical records, leads to the conclusion, that no such intention\r\nexisted on the part of the statesmen and patriots of that day. The\r\nopinions expressed, with scarcely an exception, show that they viewed\r\nthe slave trade and slavery as productive of evils to the colonies, and\r\ncalculated to retard their prosperity, if not to prevent their\r\nacquisition of independence. The question of negro slavery was one of\r\nlittle moment, indeed, in the estimation of the colonists, when compared\r\nwith the objects at which they aimed; and the resolutions adopted, which\r\nbound them not to import any more slaves, or purchase any imported by\r\nothers, was a blow aimed at the commerce of the mother country, and\r\ndesigned to compel Parliament to repeal its obnoxious laws. But the\r\nresolutions themselves must be given, as best calculated to demonstrate\r\nwhat were the designs of those by whom they were adopted. Before doing\r\nthis, however, it is necessary to ascertain what were the relations\r\nwhich the North American Colonies bore to the commerce of the British\r\nEmpire, and why it was, that the refusal any longer to purchase imported\r\nslaves would be so ruinous to Great Britain, and her other colonies.\r\nWhen this is done, and not till then, can the full meaning of the\r\nresolutions be determined. Such were the links connecting these colonies\r\nwith England--with the West Indies--and with the African slave trade,\r\nconducted by British merchants--that more than one-half of the commerce\r\nof the mother country was directly or indirectly under their control.\r\nThe facts on this subject are extracted from the debates in the British\r\nParliament, and especially from the speech of Hon. EDMUND BURKE, on his\r\nresolutions, of March 22d, 1775, for conciliation with America.[106] He\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"I have in my hand two accounts; one, a comparative statement of the\r\nexport trade of England to its colonies, as it stood in the year 1704,\r\nand as it stood in the year 1772. The other, a state of the export trade\r\nof this country to its colonies alone, as it stood in 1772, compared\r\nwith the whole trade of England to all parts of the world, (the colonies\r\nincluded,) in the year 1704. They are from good vouchers; the latter\r\nperiod from the accounts on your own table, the earlier, from an\r\noriginal manuscript of Davenant, who first established the Inspector\r\nGeneral's Office, which has been, ever since his time, so abundant a\r\nsource of Parliamentary information.\r\n\r\n\"The export trade to the colonies, consists of three great branches. The\r\nAfrican, which, terminating almost wholly in the colonies, must be put\r\nto the account of their commerce; the West Indian, and the North\r\nAmerican. All these are so interwoven, that the attempt to separate them\r\nwould tear to pieces the contexture of the whole; and if not entirely\r\ndestroy, would very much depreciate the value of all the parts. I,\r\ntherefore, consider these three denominations to be, what in effect they\r\nare, one trade.\r\n\r\n\"The trade to the colonies, taken on the export side, at the beginning\r\nof this century, that is, in the year 1704, stood thus:\r\n\r\n  \"Exports to North America and the West Indies   $2,416,325\r\n   To Africa                                         433,325\r\n                                                  ----------\r\n                                                  $2,849,650\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1772, which I take as a middle year, between the highest\r\nand lowest of those lately laid on your table, the account was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \"To North America and the West Indies          $23,958,670\r\n   To Africa                                       4,331,990\r\n   To which, if you add the export trade from\r\n     Scotland, which had, in 1704, no existence    1,820,000\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n                                                 $30,110,660\r\n\r\n\"From a little over two millions and three quarters, it has grown to\r\nover thirty millions.[107] It has increased no less than twelve fold.\r\nThis is the state of the colony trade, as compared with itself at these\r\ntwo periods, within this century; and this is matter for meditation. But\r\nthis is not all. Examine my second account. See how the export trade to\r\nthe colonies alone, in 1772, stood in the other point of view, that is,\r\nas compared to the whole trade of England, in 1704.\r\n\r\n  \"The whole trade of England, including that\r\n      to the colonies, in 1704                   $32,545,000\r\n   Export to the colonies alone, in 1772          30,120,000\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n        Difference                                $2,425,000\r\n\r\n\"The trade with America alone, is now within less than two millions and\r\na half of being equal to what this great commercial nation, England,\r\ncarried on at the beginning of this century with the whole world! If I\r\nhad taken the largest year of those on your table, it would rather have\r\nexceeded. But, it will be said, is not this American trade an unnatural\r\nprotuberance, that has drawn the juices from the rest of the body? The\r\nreverse. It is the very food that has nourished every other part into\r\nits present magnitude. Our general trade has been greatly augmented; and\r\naugmented more or less in almost every part to which it ever extended;\r\nbut with this material difference, that of the thirty-two millions and a\r\nhalf, which, in the beginning of the century, constituted the whole mass\r\nof our export commerce, the colony trade was but one-twelfth part; it is\r\nnow considerably more than a third of the whole--[which is $80,000,000.]\r\nThis is the relative proportion of the importance of the colonies at\r\nthese two periods; and all reasoning concerning our mode of treating\r\nthem, must have this proportion as its basis; or it is a reasoning,\r\nweak, rotten, and sophistical.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perceive, from what is said by Mr. Burke, the\r\nembarrassments that must fall upon the mother country, in the event of a\r\nrebellion in the North American colonies. Take another illustration of\r\nthis point. More than one-third of the exports of Great Britain were\r\nmade to North America, the West Indies, and Africa. They stood thus\r\nduring the three years ending at Christmas, 1773:\r\n\r\n          Annual average exports to North America      $17,500,000\r\n          To the West Indies                             6,500,000\r\n          To Africa                                      3,500,000\r\n                                                        ----------\r\n              Total value of exports                   $27,500,000\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The total value of the exports of Great Britain to\r\nall the world, at this date, was $80,000,000. These exports were made\r\nup, in part, of colonial products, tobacco, rice, sugar, etc., to the\r\namount of $15,000,000;--$5,000,000 to foreign countries, and $10,000,000\r\nto Ireland,--which, when added to the $27,500,000, paid for by the\r\ncolonies, exhibits them as sustaining more than one-half of the commerce\r\nof the mother country.[108]\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the alarm which led to the examination of this\r\nsubject by the Hon. Edmund Burke, and others, of the British Parliament,\r\nwas the adoption, by the North American colonies, of the policy of\r\nnon-importation and non-consumption of all English products, whether\r\nfrom the mother country, or any of her colonies; and the non-exportation\r\nof any North American products to Great Britain, the West Indies, or any\r\nof the dependencies of the crown. This agreement was adopted as a\r\nmeasure of retaliation upon Parliament, for the passage of the Boston\r\nPort Bill, which ordered the closing of Boston harbor to all commerce.\r\nThe measure was first proposed at a meeting of the citizens of Boston,\r\nheld on May 13, 1774. It was soon seconded by all the principal cities,\r\ntowns, and counties, throughout the colonies; and when the Continental\r\nCongress met at Philadelphia, the terms of the league were drawn up and\r\nadopted, October 20, 1774, and went into operation.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from memorials to Parliament, praying that the\r\ndifficulties with North America might be adjusted, and the threatened\r\nevils averted, will show how the slave trade was then interwoven with\r\nthe commerce and national prosperity of Great Britain, and to what\r\nextent the American league could affect that prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, January 23, 1775: \"Mr. Burke then presented a\r\npetition of the Master, Wardens, and Commonalty, of the Society of\r\nMerchants Venturers of the city of Bristol, under their common seal;\r\nwhich was read, setting forth, That a very beneficial and increasing\r\ntrade to the British colonies in America, has been carried on from the\r\nport of Bristol, highly to the advantage of the kingdom in general, and\r\nof the said city in particular; and that the exports from the said port\r\nto America, consist of almost every species of British manufactures,\r\nbesides East India goods, and other articles of commerce; and the\r\nreturns are made not only in many valuable and useful commodities from\r\nthence, but also, by a circuitous trade, carried on with Ireland, and\r\nmost parts of Europe, to the great emolument of the merchant, and\r\nimprovement of his Majesty's revenue; and that the merchants of the said\r\nport are also deeply engaged in the trade to the West India islands,\r\nwhich, by the exchange of their produce with America, for provisions,\r\nlumber, and other stores, are thereby almost wholly maintained, and\r\nconsequently, become dependent upon North America for support; and that\r\nthe trade to Africa, which is carried on from the said port to a very\r\nconsiderable extent, is also dependent upon the flourishing state of the\r\nWest India islands, and America; and that these different branches of\r\ncommerce give employment not only to a very numerous body of artists and\r\nmanufacturers, but also to a great number of ships, and many thousand\r\nseamen, by which means a very capital increase is made to the naval\r\nstrength of Great Britain. . . . . . The passing certain acts of\r\nParliament, and other measures lately adopted, caused such a great\r\nuneasiness in the minds of the inhabitants of America, as to make the\r\nmerchants apprehensive of the most alarming consequences, and which, if\r\nnot speedily remedied, must involve them in utter ruin. And the\r\npetitioners, as merchants deeply interested in measures which so\r\nmaterially affect the commerce of this kingdom, and not less concerned\r\nas Englishmen, in every thing that relates to the general welfare,\r\ncannot look without emotion on the many thousands of miserable objects,\r\nwho, by the total stop put to the export trade of America, will be\r\ndischarged from their manufactories for want of employment, and must be\r\nreduced to great distress.\"[109]\r\n\r\nJanuary 26, 1775. A petition of the merchants and tradesmen of the port\r\nof Liverpool, was presented to the House, and read, setting forth: \"That\r\nan extensive and most important trade has been long carried on, from\r\nsaid town to the continent and islands of America; and that the exports\r\nfrom thence infinitely exceed in value the imports from America, from\r\nwhence an immense debt arises, and remains due to the British merchant;\r\nand that every article which the laborer, manufacturer, or more\r\ningenious artist, can furnish for use, convenience, or luxury, makes a\r\npart in these exports, for the consumption of the American; and that\r\nthose demands, as important in amount as various in quality, have for\r\nmany seasons been so constant, regular, and diffusive, that they are now\r\nbecome essential to the flourishing state of all their manufactures, and\r\nof consequence to every ndividual in these kingdoms; and that the bread\r\nof thousands in Great Britain, principally and immediately depends upon\r\nthis branch of commerce, of which a temporary interruption will reduce\r\nthe hand of industry to idleness and want, and a longer cessation of it\r\nwould sink the now opulent trader in indigence and ruin; and that at\r\nthis particular season of the year, the petitioners have been accustomed\r\nto send to North America many ships wholly laden with the products of\r\nBritain; but by the unhappy differences at present subsisting, from\r\nwhatever source they flow, the trade to these parts is entirely at a\r\nstand; and that the present loss, though great, is nothing, when\r\ncompared with the dreadful mischiefs which will certainly ensue, if some\r\neffectual remedy is not speedily applied to this spreading malady, which\r\nmust otherwise involve the West India islands, and the trade to Africa,\r\nin the complicated ruin; but that the petitioners can still, with\r\npleasing hopes, look up to the British Parliament, from whom they trust\r\nthat these unhappy divisions will speedily be healed, mutual confidence\r\nand credit restored, and the trade of Britain again flourishing with\r\nundecaying vigor.\"[110]\r\n\r\nMarch 16, 1775. To the question \"From what places do the sugar colonies\r\ndraw food for subsistence?\" the answer, given before Parliament, was, in\r\npart, as follows: \"I confine myself at present to necessary food.\r\nIreland furnishes a large quantity of salted beef, pork, butter, and\r\nherrings, but no grain. North America supplies all the rest, both corn\r\nand provisions. North America is truly the granary of the West Indies;\r\nfrom whence they draw the great quantities of flour and biscuit for the\r\nuse of one class of people, and of Indian corn for the support of all\r\nthe others; for the support, not of man only, but of every animal . . .\r\n. . . North America also furnishes the West Indies with rice . . . . . .\r\nNorth America not only furnishes the West Indies with bread, but with\r\nmeat, with sheep, with poultry, and some live cattle; but the demand for\r\nthese is infinitely short of the demand for the salted beef, pork, and\r\nfish. Salted fish, (if the expression may be permitted in contrast with\r\nbread,) is the meat of all the lower ranks in Barbadoes and the Leeward\r\nIslands. It is the meat of all the slaves in the West Indies. Nor is it\r\ndisdained by persons in better condition. The North American colonies\r\nalso furnishes the sugar colonies with salt from Turks' Island, Sal\r\nTortuga, and Anguilla; although these islands are themselves a part of\r\nthe West Indies. The testimony which some experience has enabled me to\r\nbear, you will find confirmed, Sir, by official accounts. The same\r\naccounts will distinguish the source of the principal, the great supply\r\nof corn and provisions. They will fix it precisely in the middle\r\ncolonies of North America; in those colonies who have made a public\r\nagreement in their Congress, to withhold all their supplies after the\r\ntenth of next September. How far that agreement may be precipitated in\r\nits execution, may be retarded or frustrated, it is for the wisdom of\r\nParliament to consider: but if it is persisted in, I am well founded to\r\nsay, that nothing will save Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands from the\r\ndreadful consequences of absolute famine. I repeat, the famine will not\r\nbe prevented. The distress will fall upon them suddenly; they will be\r\noverwhelmed with it, before they can turn themselves about to look for\r\nrelief. What a scene! when rapine, stimulated by hunger, has broken down\r\nall screens, confounded the rich with the poor, and leveled the freeman\r\nwith his slave! The distress will be sudden. The body of the people do\r\nnot look forward to distant events; if they should do this, they will\r\nput their trust in the wisdom of Parliament. Suppose them to be less\r\nconfident in the wisdom of Parliament, they are destitute of the means\r\nof purchasing an extraordinary stock. Suppose them possessed of the\r\nmeans; a very extraordinary stock is not to be found at market. There is\r\na plain reason in the nature of the thing, which prevents any\r\nextraordinary stock at market, and which would forbid the planter from\r\nlaying it in, if there was; it is, that the objects of it are\r\nperishable. In those climates, the flour will not keep over six or eight\r\nweeks; the Indian corn decays in three months; and all the North\r\nAmerican provisions are fit only for present use.\"[111]\r\n\r\nTo the question, what are the advantages of the sugar colonies to Great\r\nBritain? it was answered: \"The advantage is not that the profits all\r\ncentre here; it is, that it creates, in the course of attaining those\r\nprofits, a commerce and navigation in which multitudes of your people,\r\nand millions of your money are employed; it is that the support which\r\nthe sugar colonies received in one shape, they give in another. In\r\nproportion to their dependence on North America, and upon Ireland, they\r\nenable North America and Ireland to trade with Great Britain. By their\r\ndependence upon Great Britain for hands to push the culture of the\r\nsugar-cane, they uphold the trade of Great Britain to Africa. A trade\r\nwhich in the pursuit of negroes, as the principal, if not the only\r\nintention of the adventurer, brings home ivory and gold as secondary\r\nobjects. In proportion as the sugar colonies consume, or cause to be\r\nconsumed, among their neighbors, Asiatic commodities, they increase the\r\ntrade of the English East India Company. In this light I see the India\r\ngoods which are carried to the coast of Guinea.[112]\r\n\r\nTo the question, what proportion of land in the Leeward Islands, being\r\napplied to raising provisions, would supply the negroes with provisions,\r\non an estate of two hundred hogsheads, for instance? it was answered:\r\n\"The native products of the Islands are very uncertain; all so, but\r\nGuinea corn; therefore, much more land would be applied to this purpose\r\nthan would be necessary to raise the supply for the regular constant\r\nconsumption. They must provide against accidents, such as hurricanes,\r\nexcess of wet weather, or of dry weather, the climate being very\r\nuncertain; it is, therefore, impossible to answer this question\r\nprecisely; but this I can say, that if they were obliged to raise their\r\nown food, that their food then must be their principal object, and sugar\r\nonly a secondary object; it would be but the trifle, which provisions\r\nare now.\"[113]\r\n\r\nThe testimony in reference to Jamaica, was very similar to that quoted\r\nin relation to Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands; except that as\r\nJamaica had more unimproved land, and greater diversity of soil and\r\nclimate, it might, in time, stand prepared to meet the shock. But as the\r\nemergency was likely to be sudden and unexpected, much suffering must\r\nensue in the outset of the non-intercourse policy.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to add a few remarks, from the speech of Mr.\r\nGlover, in summing up the testimony. He said: \"From this ground see what\r\nis put in hazard; not merely a monied profit, but our bulwark of\r\ndefense, our power in offense--the acts and industry of our Nation.\r\nInstead of thousands and tens of thousands of families in comfort, a\r\nnavigation extensive and enlarging, the value and rents of lands yearly\r\nrising, wealth abounding, and at hand for further improvements, see or\r\nforesee, that this third of our whole commerce, that sole basis of our\r\nEmpire, and this third in itself the best, once lost, carries with it a\r\nproportion of our national faculties, our treasure, our public revenue,\r\nand the value of land, succeeded in its fall by a multiplication of\r\ntaxes to reinstate that revenue, an increasing burden on every\r\nincreasing estate, decreasing by the reduced demand of its produce for\r\nthe support of Manufactures, and menaced with a heavier calamity\r\nstill--the diminution of our Marine, of our seamen, of our general\r\npopulation, by the emigration of useful subjects, strengthening that\r\nvery country you wish to humble, and weakening this in the sight of\r\nrival powers, who wish to humble us.\r\n\r\n\"To recapitulate the heads of that material evidence delivered before\r\nyou, would be tedious in me, unnecessary in itself. Leaving it,\r\ntherefore, to its own powerful impression, I here add only, in a general\r\nmode of my own, that of the inhabitants of those Islands, above four\r\nhundred thousand are blacks, from whose labor the immense riches there,\r\nso distinctly proved at your bar, are derived, with such immense\r\nadvantage to these kingdoms. How far these multitudes, if their\r\nintercourse with North America is stopped, may be exposed to famine, you\r\nhave heard. One-half in Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, say one\r\nhundred thousand negroes, in value at least twenty millions of dollars,\r\npossibly, it grieves me to say probably, may perish. The remainder must\r\ndivert to provisions the culture of the produce so valuable to Great\r\nBritain. The same must be the practice in great part throughout Jamaica\r\nand the new settled acquisitions. They may feel a distress just short of\r\ndestruction, but must divert for subsistence so much labor as, in\r\nproportion, will shorten their rich product.\"[114]\r\n\r\nThe North American colonies could not have devised a measure so alarming\r\nto Great Britain, and so well calculated to force Parliament into the\r\nrepeal of her obnoxious laws, as this policy of non-intercourse. It\r\nwould deprive the West Indies of their ordinary supplies of provisions,\r\nand force them to suspend their usual cultivation, to produce their own\r\nfood. It would cause not only the cessation of imports from Great\r\nBritain into the West Indies, on account of the inability of its people\r\nto pay, but would, at once, check all demand for slaves, both in the\r\nsugar Islands and in North America--thus creating a loss, in the\r\nAfrican trade alone, of three and a half millions of dollars, and\r\nputting in peril one-half of the commerce of England.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to introduce the resolutions, passed by the North\r\nAmerican colonies, on the subject of the slave trade and slavery. It is\r\nnot considered necessary to burden our pages with a repetition of the\r\nwhole of the accompanying resolutions. They embraced every item of\r\nforeign commodities, excepting in a few instances where medicines,\r\nsaltpetre, and other necessaries, were exempted from the prohibition. In\r\na few counties, though they condemned the slave trade, they excepted\r\nnegroes, and desired to retain the privilege of procuring them. This was\r\nin the early part of the movement. When the Continental Congress came to\r\nact upon it, no such exemption was made.\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1774, the citizens of Providence, Rhode Island, met and\r\nacquiesced in the Boston resolutions. Their proceedings closed with this\r\ndeclaration: \"Whereas, the inhabitants of America are engaged in the\r\npreservation of their rights and liberties; and as personal liberty is\r\nan essential part of the natural rights of mankind, the deputies of the\r\ntown are directed to use their endeavors to obtain an act of the General\r\nAssembly, prohibiting the importation of negro slaves in this colony;\r\nand that all negroes born in the colony should be free at a certain\r\nage.\"\r\n\r\nPrince George county, Virginia, June 1774, responded to Boston, and\r\nadded this resolution: \"_Resolved_, That the African trade is injurious\r\nto this colony, obstructs the population of it by freemen, prevents\r\nmanufacturers and other useful emigrants from Europe from settling among\r\nus, and occasions an annual balance of trade against the colony.\"[115]\r\n\r\nCulpepper County, Virginia, July 7, 1774 acquiesced in the\r\nnon-intercourse policy, and added this resolution: \"_Resolved_, That the\r\nimporting slaves and convict servants, is injurious to this colony, as\r\nit obstructs the population of it with freemen and useful manufacturers,\r\nand that we will not buy such slave or convict hereafter to be\r\nimported.\"[116]\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Convention, at Charleston, South Carolina, July 6, 7, 8,\r\n1774, resolved to acquiesce in the Boston non-intercourse measures, and\r\nthe merchants agreed not to import goods or slaves, until the grievances\r\nwere redressed.[117]\r\n\r\nNansemond County Virginia, July 11, 1774, gave full assent to the Boston\r\nmeasures, and also \"_Resolved_, That the African trade is injurious to\r\nthis colony, obstructs the population of it by freemen, prevents\r\nmanufacturers and other useful emigrants from Europe from settling among\r\nus, and occasions an annual increase of the balance of trade against the\r\ncolony .\"[118]\r\n\r\nCaroline County, Virginia, July 14, 1774, cordially acceded to the\r\nBoston policy, and also \"_Resolved_, That the African trade is injurious\r\nto this colony, obstructs our population by freemen, manufacturers, and\r\nothers, who would emigrate from Europe and settle here, and occasions a\r\nbalance of trade against the country that ought to be associated\r\nagainst.\"[119]\r\n\r\nSurry County, Virginia, July 6, 1774, decided to sustain the Bostonians\r\nand also \"_Resolved_, That as the population of this colony, with\r\nfreemen and useful manufacturers, is greatly obstructed by the\r\nimportation of slaves and convict servants, we will not purchase any\r\nsuch slaves or servants, hereafter to be imported.\"[120]\r\n\r\nFairfax County, Virginia, July 18, 1774, took ground strongly with\r\nBoston, and further \"_Resolved_, That it is the opinion of this meeting,\r\nthat during our present difficulties and distress, no slaves ought to be\r\nimported into any of the British colonies on the continent; and we take\r\nthis opportunity of declaring our most earnest wishes to see an entire\r\nstop forever put so such a wicked, cruel, and unnatural trade.\"[121]\r\n\r\nHanover county, Virginia, July 20, 1774, sustained the Boston\r\nresolutions, and also \"_Resolved_, That the African trade for slaves, we\r\nconsider as most dangerous to virtue and the welfare of this country; we\r\ntherefore most earnestly wish to see it totally discouraged.\"[122]\r\n\r\nPrince Ann County, Virginia, July 27, 1784, adopted the Boston policy,\r\nmost distinctly, and also \"_Resolved_, That our Burgesses be instructed\r\nto oppose the importation of slaves and convicts as injurious to this\r\ncolony, by preventing the population of it by freemen and useful\r\nmanufacturers.\"[123]\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Convention of Delegates, which met at Williamsburgh, August\r\n1, 1774, fully indorsed the non-intercourse policy, medicines excepted,\r\nand in their resolutions declared: \"We will neither ourselves import,\r\nnor purchase any slave or slaves imported by any other person, after the\r\nfirst day of November next, either from Africa, the West Indies, or any\r\nother place.\"[124]\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Convention of Delegates, which met at Newbern, August\r\n24, 1774, fully indorsed the non-intercourse policy, and also passed\r\nthis among their other resolutions: \"_Resolved_, That we will not import\r\nany slave or slaves, or purchase any slave or slaves, imported or\r\nbrought into this Province by others, from any part of the world, after\r\nthe first day of November next.\"[125]\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the Continental Congress, which met at Philadelphia, Sept.\r\n5, 1774, in passing its non-importation, non-exportation, and\r\nnon-consumption Agreement, included the following as the second article\r\nof that document:\r\n\r\n\"That we will neither import nor purchase any slave imported after the\r\nfirst day of December next; after which time we will wholly discontinue\r\nthe slave trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will\r\nwe hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or manfactures to those\r\nwho are concerned in it.\"[126]\r\n\r\nTo afford a clear view of the reasons which prompted the colonies to\r\nadopt such stringent measures to compel Parliament to repeal its\r\noppressive acts, it is only necessary to quote the very brief summary of\r\ngrievances of which they complained, as drawn up by the Pennsylvania\r\nConvention, which met in Philadelphia, July 15, 1774:\r\n\r\n\"The legislative authority claimed by Parliament over these colonies,\r\nconsists of two heads: first, a general power of internal legislation;\r\nand, secondly, a power of regulating our trade; both, she contends, are\r\nunlimited. Under the first may be included, among other powers, those of\r\nforbidding us to worship our Creator in the manner we think most\r\nacceptable to him--imposing taxes on us--collecting them by their own\r\nofficers--enforcing the collection by Admiralty Courts, or Courts\r\nMartial--abolishing trials by jury--establishing a standing army among\r\nus in time of peace, without consent of our Assemblies--paying them with\r\nour money--seizing our young men for recruits--changing constitutions of\r\ngovernment--stopping the press--declaring any action, even a meeting of\r\nthe smallest number, to consider of peaceable modes to obtain redress of\r\ngrievances, high treason--taking colonists to Great Britain to be\r\ntried--exempting 'murderers' of colonists from punishment, by carrying\r\nthem to England, to answer indictments found in the colonies--shutting\r\nup our ports--prohibiting us from slitting iron to build our houses,\r\nmaking hats to cover our heads, or clothing to cover the rest of our\r\nbodies, etc.\"[127]\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of grievances such as these, and of efforts of\r\nredress such as the adoption of the Non-Intercourse Agreement was\r\nexpected to afford, that the resolutions against the slave trade and\r\nslavery were passed. What, then, was their true import? Did the patriots\r\nof the Revolution contemplate the enfranchisement of the negro, in the\r\nevent of securing their own independence? Did their views of free\r\ninstitutions include the idea that barbarism and civilization could\r\ncoalesce and co-exist in harmony and safety? Or did they not hold, as a\r\ngreat fundamental truth, that a high degree of intelligence and moral\r\nprinciple was essential to the success of free government? And was it\r\nnot on this very principle, that they opposed the further introduction\r\nof negroes from Africa, and afterwards, by a special clause in the\r\nConstitution, excluded the Indians from citizenship?\r\n\r\nThe resolutions which have been quoted, have given rise to much\r\ndiscussion, and have often been misrepresented. By severing them from\r\ntheir connection with the circumstances under which they were adopted,\r\nand associating them with the phrase in the Declaration of Independence,\r\nthat \"all men are created equal,\" the impression has been made that the\r\nnegroes were to be included in the rights therein claimed. But as they\r\nhave not been made participants in the benefits of the Revolution, it\r\nhas been argued that the nation has broken its covenant engagements, and\r\nmust expect that the judgments of Heaven will be poured out upon her.\r\n\r\nNow, what are the facts? The colonists were aiming at a high degree of\r\nmental and moral culture, and were desirous of developing the resources\r\nof the country, by encouraging the influx of freemen from Europe, and\r\nespecially of mechanics and manufacturers. They were anxiously looking\r\nforward to the time when they could cast off the yoke of oppression\r\nwhich the mother country had forced upon their necks. The multiplication\r\nof the negro population was considered as a barrier to the success of\r\ntheir measures, and as most dangerous to virtue and the welfare of the\r\ncountry. It was increasing the indebtedness of the citizens to foreign\r\nmerchants, and augmenting the balance of trade against the colonies. But\r\nthere was no settled policy in reference to the future disposition of\r\nthe colored population. Feelings of pity were manifested toward them,\r\nand some expressed themselves in favor of emancipation. The Continental\r\nCongress, in addition to its action in the Non-Intercourse Agreement,\r\n_Resolved_, April 6, 1776, \"That no slaves be imported into any of the\r\nthirteen United Colonies.\"[128] The Delaware Convention, August 27,\r\n1776, adopted, as the 26th article of its Constitution, that \"No person\r\nhereafter imported into this State from Africa, ought to be held in\r\nslavery on any pretense whatever; and no negro, Indian, or mulatto slave\r\nought to be brought into this State, for sale, from any part of the\r\nworld.\"[129]\r\n\r\nThere was more of meaning in this action, than the resolution, standing\r\nalone, would seem to indicate. On the 11th of July, preceding, Gen.\r\nWashington wrote to the Massachusetts Assembly, that the enemy had\r\nexcited the slaves and savages to arms against him;[130] and on November\r\n7th, 1775, Lord Dunmore had issued a proclamation, declaring the\r\nemancipation of all slaves \"that were able and willing to bear arms,\r\nthey joining his Majesty's troops, as soon as may be, for the more\r\nspeedy reducing the colonists to their duty to his Majesty's crown and\r\ndignity.\"[131]\r\n\r\nPrevious to the commencement of hostilities, the resolutions of the\r\ncolonists, adverse to the slave trade and slavery, were designed to\r\noperate against British commerce; but, after that event, the measures\r\nadopted had reference, mainly, to the prevention of the increase of a\r\npopulation that had been, and might continue to be, employed against the\r\nliberties of the colonies. That such a course formed a part of the\r\npolicy of Great Britain, is beyond dispute; and that she considered the\r\nprosecution of the slave trade as necessary to her purposes, was clearly\r\nindicated by the Earl of Dartmouth, who declared, as a sufficient reason\r\nfor turning a deaf ear to the remonstrances of the colonists against the\r\nfurther importation of slaves, that \"Negroes cannot become\r\nrepublicans--they will be a power in our hands to restrain the unruly\r\ncolonists.\" That such motives prompted England to prosecute the\r\nintroduction of slaves into the colonies, was fully believed by American\r\nstatesmen; and their views were expressed, by Mr. Jefferson, in a clause\r\nin the first draft of the Declaration of Independence, but which was\r\nafterward omitted.\r\n\r\nThat the emancipation of the negroes was not contemplated, by those in\r\ngeneral, who voted for the resolutions quoted, is evident from the\r\nsubsequent action of Virginia, where the greater portion of the meetings\r\nwere held. They could not have intended to enfranchise men, whom they\r\ndeclared to be obstacles in the way of public prosperity, and as\r\ndangerous to the virtues of the people. Nor could the signers of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence have designed to include the Indians and\r\nnegroes in the assertion that all men are created equal, because these\r\nsame men, in afterwards adopting the Constitution, deliberately\r\nexcluded the Indians from citizenship, and forever fixed the negro in a\r\ncondition of servitude, under that Constitution, by including him, as a\r\nslave, in the article fixing the ratio of Congressional representation\r\non the basis of five negroes equaling three white men. The phrase--\"all\r\nmen are created equal\"--could, therefore, have meant nothing more than\r\nthe declaration of a general principle, asserting the equality of the\r\ncolonists, before God, with those who claimed it as a divine right to\r\nlord it over them. The Indians were men as well as the negroes. Both\r\nwere within the territory over which the United Colonies claimed\r\njurisdiction. The exclusion of both from citizenship under the\r\nConstitution, is conclusive that neither were intended to be embraced in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nThat the colonists were determined, at any sacrifice, to achieve their\r\nown liberties, even at the sacrifice of their slave property, seems to\r\nhave been the opinion of intelligent Englishmen. Burke, in his speech\r\nalready quoted, thus dissipates the hopes of those who expected to find\r\nless resistance at the South than at the North.\r\n\r\n\"There is, however, a circumstance attending the [Southern] colonies,\r\nwhich, in my opinion, fully counterbalances this difference, and makes\r\nthe spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those to the\r\nNorthward. It is that in Virginia and the Carolinas, they have a vast\r\nmultitude of slaves. Where this is the case, in any part of the world,\r\nthose who are free, are by far the most proud and jealous of their\r\nfreedom. Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank\r\nand privilege. Not seeing there that freedom, as in countries where it\r\nis a common blessing, and as broad and general as the air, may be united\r\nwith much abject toil, with great misery with all the exterior of\r\nservitude, liberty looks, among them, like something that is more noble\r\nand liberal. I do not mean, sir, to commend the peculiar morality of\r\nthis sentiment, which has at least as much pride as virtue in it; but I\r\ncan not alter the nature of man. The fact is so; and these people of the\r\nSouthern colonies are much more strongly, and with a higher and more\r\nstubborn spirit, attached to liberty, than those to the Northward. Such\r\nwere all the ancient commonwealths; such were our Gothic ancestors; such\r\nin our days were the Poles; and such will be all masters of slaves, who\r\nare not slaves themselves. In such a people the haughtiness of\r\ndomination combines with the spirit of freedom, fortifies it, and\r\nrenders it invincible.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[106] See American Archives, vol i. folio 1749.\r\n\r\n[107] His estimates are in pounds sterling.

Canada has all along been a sealed book\r\nto the public of the States, so far as the condition of blacks, who had\r\nescaped thither, were concerned. Since the completion of the\r\nstereotyping of the volume, and just as it was about ready for the\r\npress, the _New York Herald_, of January 5, reached us. It embraces a\r\ndetailed report on this important subject, which was prepared by a\r\nspecial agent, who visited the settlements he describes. It is very\r\ninteresting to find, that the opinions and predictions of Major Lachlan,\r\nmade in 1841 to 1850, as to the results of colored immigration into\r\nCanada, should be so fully sustained and fulfilled, by a report upon the\r\nactual facts in 1859.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, here, that we believe a crisis has arrived in the\r\nhistory of the free colored people of the United States, which demands\r\nthe most calm and serious consideration; and we would remind the more\r\nintelligent colored men, that the honor of conducting their fellow-men\r\nin the road to a high civilization, will be as great as are the honors\r\nheaped upon the few of the white race, who have been the master spirits\r\nin bringing up their fellow-men to the pinnacle of greatness upon which\r\nthey now stand. More than one field, for the accomplishment of this\r\nobject, now presents itself; and, as the darkest hour is said to be that\r\nwhich immediately proceeds the dawn of day; it may be hoped that the\r\nlowering clouds now overshadowing their prospects, will soon be\r\ndissipated by a brighter sun, that shall reveal the highway of their\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nBut to the extracts from the _Herald_. After giving a detailed account\r\nof the whole subject of negro immigration into Canada, together with the\r\nparticulars of the results of the several attempts at founding\r\nsettlements for the refugees, the _Herald's_ reporter sums up the whole\r\nmatter thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE SOCIAL AND MORAL EFFECT OF THE IMPORTATION OF FUGITIVE SLAVES INTO\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\n\"While, as we have seen, the British abolitionists in Canada are\r\nlaboring with the republican abolitionists of America to entice away the\r\nslave property of the South, and to foment a servile insurrection in the\r\nSouthern States, and a disruption of the Union, there are men of sense\r\nand of honor among our neighbors over the borders, who deplore this\r\ninterference of their countrymen in the affairs of the republic, and\r\nappreciate the terrible catastrophe to which, if persevered in, it must\r\neventually lead. I conversed with a prominent abolitionist in Chatham,\r\nholding a public position of trust and honor, who told me that the first\r\nsuggestion of the Harper's Ferry attack was made to Brown by British\r\nabolitionists in Chatham, and who assured me that he had himself\r\nsubscribed money to aid Brown in raising men for the service in Ohio and\r\nelsewhere in the States. In reply to some questions I put to him, he\r\nstated that he and his associates on the other side looked with\r\nexpectation and hope to the day, not far distant, when a disruption of\r\nthe Union would take place; for that, in that case, the British\r\nabolitionists would join the republican abolitionists of America in open\r\nwarfare upon the slaveholding States. When I reminded him that the\r\npatriotic men of the North would raise a barrier of brave hearts,\r\nthrough which such traitors would find it difficult to reach the\r\nSouthern States, he replied--'Oh, we have often talked over and\r\ncalculated upon that; but you forget that we should have the negroes of\r\nthe South to help us in their own homes against their oppressors, with\r\nthe knife and the fire-brand.'\r\n\r\n\"I conversed on the other hand with conservative, high-minded men, who\r\nexpressed the most serious apprehension that the bold and unjustifiable\r\nassociation of Canadian abolitionists with the negro stealers and\r\ninsurrectionists of America would eventually plunge the two countries\r\ninto war.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that the immigration of fugitive slaves into Canada is\r\nunattended by any social or moral good to the negro. It is injurious,\r\nalso, to the white citizens of Canada, inasmuch as it depresses the\r\nvalue of their property, diminishes their personal comfort and safety,\r\nand destroys the peace and good order of the community. Mr. Sheriff\r\nMercer, of Kent county, assured me that the criminal statistics of that\r\ncounty prove that nine-tenths of the offenses against the laws are\r\ncommitted by colored persons. The same proportion holds good in Essex\r\ncounty, and the fact is the more startling when it is remembered that\r\nthe blacks do not at present number more than one-fourth of the whole\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\"In the township of Anderdon, Essex county, this fall, nearly every\r\nsheep belonging to the white farmers has been stolen. The fact was\r\npresented in the return of the Grand Jury of the county, and some twelve\r\nnegro families, men, women and children, were committed to jail on the\r\ncharge of sheep stealing. The cases of petit larceny are incredibly\r\nnumerous in every township containing negro settlements, and it is a\r\nfact that frequently the criminal calendars would be bare of a\r\nprosecution but for the negro prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"The offenses of the blacks are not wholly confined to those of a light\r\ncharacter. Occasionally some horrible crime startles the community, and\r\nis almost invariably attended by a savage ferocity peculiar to the\r\nvicious negro. If a murder is committed by a black, it is generally of\r\nan aggravated and brutal nature. The offense of rape is unfortunately\r\npeculiarly prevalent among the negroes. Nearly every assize is marked by\r\na charge of this character. A prominent lawyer of the Province, who has\r\nheld the position of public prosecutor, told me that his greatest dread\r\nwas of this offense, for that experience had taught him that no white\r\nwoman was safe at all times, from assault, and those who were rearing\r\ndaughters in that part of Canada, might well tremble at the danger by\r\nwhich they are threatened. He told me that he never saw a really brutal\r\nlook on the human face until he beheld the countenances of the negroes\r\ncharged with the crime of rape. When the lust comes over them they are\r\nworse than the wild beast of the forest. Last year, in broad daylight, a\r\nrespectable white woman, while walking in the public road within the\r\ntown of Chatham, was knocked down by a black savage and violated. This\r\nyear, near Windsor, the wife of a wealthy farmer, while driving alone\r\nin a wagon, was stopped by a negro in broad daylight, dragged out into\r\nthe road, and criminally assaulted in a most inhuman manner. It was\r\nimpossible to hear the recital of these now common crimes without a\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\n\"The fugitive slaves go into Canada as beggars, and the mass of them\r\ncommit larceny and lay in jail until they become lowered and debased,\r\nand ready for worse crimes. Nor does there seem at present a prospect of\r\neducation doing much to better their condition, for they do not appear\r\nanxious to avail themselves of school privileges as a general rule. The\r\nworse class of blacks are too poor and too indolent to clothe their\r\nchildren in the winter, and their services are wanted at home in the\r\nsummer. The better class affect airs as soon as they become tolerably\r\nwell to do, and refuse to send their little ones to any but white\r\nschools. In Windsor there are two public colored schools, but the\r\nnegroes of that place choose to refuse to allow their children to attend\r\nthese institutions, and sent them to the schools for whites. They were\r\nnot admitted, and two of the black residents, named Jones and Green,\r\ntested the question at law, to try whether the trustees or teachers had\r\na right to exclude their children. It was decided that the trustees had\r\nsuch power, when separate schools were provided for colored persons.\r\n\r\n\"That property is seriously depreciated in all neighborhoods in which\r\nthe negroes settle is a well known fact. Mr. S. S. Macdonnel, a resident\r\nof Windsor, and a gentleman of high social and political position, is\r\nthe owner of a large amount of real estate in that place. The Bowyer\r\nfarm, a large tract of land belonging to him, was partitioned into lots\r\nsome few years since, and sold at auction. Some of the lots were bid in\r\nby negroes of means, among others, by a mulatto named De Baptiste,\r\nresiding in Detroit. As soon as the white purchasers found that negroes\r\nwere among the buyers, they threw up their lots, and since then the\r\nvalue of the property has been much depressed. In several instances Mr.\r\nMacdonnel paid premiums to the negroes to give up their purchases, where\r\nthey had happened to buy in the midst of white citizens. At a subsequent\r\nsale of another property, cut up into very fine building lots, by the\r\nsame gentleman, one of the conditions of sale announced was, that no bid\r\nshould be received from colored persons. De Baptiste attended and bid in\r\na lot. When his bid was refused, he endeavored to break up the auction\r\nin a row, by the aid of other negroes, and failing in this, brought an\r\naction at law against Mr. Macdonnel. This Mr. M. prepared to defend, but\r\nit was never pressed to a trial. These incidents, together with the\r\nattempt of the Windsor negroes to force their children into the schools\r\nfor whites, illustrate the impudent assumption of the black, as soon as\r\nhe becomes independent, and the deeply seated antipathy of the whites in\r\nCanada to their dark skinned neighbors. At the same time it is\r\nobservable that the 'free negro' in Canada--that is, the black who was\r\nfree in the States--endeavors to hold his head above the 'fugitive,' and\r\nhas a profound contempt for the escaped slave.\r\n\r\n\"As I desired to obtain the views of intelligent Canadians upon the\r\nimportant questions before me, I requested a prominent and wealthy\r\ncitizen of Windsor to favor me with a written statement of his\r\nobservations on the effect of the negro immigration and received the\r\nfollowing hastily prepared and brief communication, in reply. The\r\nopinions expressed are from one of the most accomplished gentlemen in\r\nthe Province, and are worthy of serious consideration, although the\r\npublic position he occupies renders it proper that I should not make\r\npublic use of his name:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \"'WINDSOR, Dec. 23, 1859.\r\n\r\n          \"'MY DEAR SIR--In reply to your request, I beg to\r\n          say that I would cheerfully give you my views at\r\n          length upon the important topics discussed at our\r\n          interview, did not my pressing engagements just\r\n          now occupy too much of my time to make it possible\r\n          that I should do more than hastily sketch down\r\n          such thoughts as occur to me in the few moments I\r\n          can devote to the subject.\r\n\r\n          \"'The constant immigration of fugitives from\r\n          slavery into the two western counties of the\r\n          Province of Canada, Kent and Essex, has become a\r\n          matter for serious consideration to the landed\r\n          proprietors in those counties, both as it effects\r\n          the value and salability of real estate, and as\r\n          rendering the locality an undesirable place of\r\n          abode.\r\n\r\n          \"'It is certain that ever since large numbers of\r\n          fugitive slaves have, by means of the organization\r\n          known here and in the States as \"the Underground\r\n          Railroad,\" and of such associations as the Dawn\r\n          and Elgin Institutes and the Refugee Home Society,\r\n          been annually introduced into these two counties,\r\n          no settlers from the old country, from the States,\r\n          or from the eastern part of Canada, have taken up\r\n          lands there. And there is every reason to assign\r\n          the fact of there being a large colored\r\n          population, and that population constantly on the\r\n          increase, as the chief cause why these counties do\r\n          not draw a portion at least of the many seeking\r\n          Western homes.\r\n\r\n          \"'Kent and Essex have been justly styled \"the\r\n          Garden of Upper Canada.\" The soil in most parts of\r\n          the counties cannot be excelled in richness and\r\n          fertility, and the climate is mild and delightful.\r\n          There are thousands of acres open for sale at a\r\n          moderate price, but it now seldom happens that a\r\n          lot of wild land is taken up by a new comer. The\r\n          farmer who has achieved the clearing of the land\r\n          that years ago was settled upon may wish to extend\r\n          his possessions for the sake of his sons who are\r\n          growing up, by the acquisition of an adjoining or\r\n          neighboring piece of wild land; but seldom or\r\n          never is the uncleared forest intruded upon now by\r\n          the encampment of emigrant families.\r\n\r\n          \"'It may be broadly asserted, first, in general,\r\n          that the existence of a large colored population\r\n          in Kent and Essex has prevented many white\r\n          settlers from locating there who otherwise would\r\n          have made a home in one of those counties; and,\r\n          secondly, that in particular instances it\r\n          constantly occurs that the sale of a lot of land\r\n          is injuriously affected by reason of the near\r\n          settlement of colored people.\r\n\r\n          \"'Next, as to the general feeling of the gentry\r\n          and farmers who live in the midst of this\r\n          population: All regard it with dissatisfaction,\r\n          and with a foreboding--an uncomfortable\r\n          anticipation for the future, as they behold the\r\n          annual inpouring of a people with whom they have\r\n          few or no sympathies in common, many of whose\r\n          characteristics are obnoxious and bad, and who\r\n          have to make a commencement here, in the\r\n          development of their better nature, should they\r\n          possess any, from perhaps the lowest point to\r\n          which the human mind can be degraded,\r\n          intellectually and morally.\r\n\r\n          \"'There is undoubtedly hardly a well thinking\r\n          person whose heart is not touched with a feeling\r\n          of pity for the unfortunates who present\r\n          themselves as paupers, in the name of liberty, to\r\n          become denizens of our country. And it would,\r\n          doubtless, be a great moral spectacle to witness\r\n          these escaped slaves, as they are sometimes\r\n          pictured by professional philanthropists,\r\n          rendering themselves happy in their freedom,\r\n          acquiring property, surrounding themselves with\r\n          the comforts, if not the elegancies of life, and\r\n          advancing themselves intellectually, socially and\r\n          politically. But, alas for human nature! If the\r\n          negro is really fitted by the Creator to enjoy\r\n          freedom as we enjoy it, the habits of mind and of\r\n          action, however baneful they may be, that have\r\n          been long exercised, are not to be suddenly broken\r\n          or changed; and the slave who was idle, and lying,\r\n          and thievish in the South, will not obtain\r\n          opposite qualities forthwith by crossing the line\r\n          that makes him free.\r\n\r\n          \"'This is not said in a spirit of malevolence\r\n          toward the colored people that are here and are\r\n          brought here, but as presenting their case as it\r\n          really is, and as explaining the position in which\r\n          residents of these counties are placed, or will be\r\n          placed, if this continuous flow from the slave\r\n          States is poured in by means of the organizations\r\n          and societies formed for that purpose in many of\r\n          the Northern States of America, and fostered and\r\n          aided by many indiscreet men in our own country.\r\n\r\n          \"'The main argument in favor of the free school\r\n          system is, that it is a benefit to all to be\r\n          surrounded by an intelligent and moral community,\r\n          and for such a benefit every property holder\r\n          should be glad to contribute his quota. Is there,\r\n          then, any need of asking the question, if the\r\n          people of these counties desire the sort of\r\n          population that comes to them from the Southern\r\n          States?\r\n\r\n          \"'What is the condition of the negroes on their\r\n          arrival here? What their progress in the\r\n          acquisition of property and knowledge, and their\r\n          conduct as citizens?\r\n\r\n          \"'There are very few indeed who arrive here with\r\n          sufficient means at once to acquire a farm, or to\r\n          enter into business of any kind. The great mass of\r\n          them may be called paupers, claiming aid from the\r\n          societies through whose agency they are brought\r\n          out. Some of these societies hold large tracts of\r\n          land, which they sub-divide and sell to new comers\r\n          upon long time, but with conditions as to\r\n          clearing, residence, etc., that are difficult of\r\n          observance. I believe there is much trouble in\r\n          carrying out this plan, arising in some measure\r\n          from the peculiarities of negro character--a want\r\n          of constancy or steadiness of purpose, as well as\r\n          from a feeling of distrust as to their having the\r\n          land secured to them. If the land is not purchased\r\n          from any of these societies, a parcel of ten or\r\n          fifteen colored families get together and purchase\r\n          and settle upon some other spot.\r\n\r\n          \"While there are instances of colored men\r\n          accumulating property here, the great mass of them\r\n          fail even in securing a living without charity or\r\n          crime. They have but little forethought for the\r\n          future, and care only to live lazily in the\r\n          present. The criminal records of the county show\r\n          that nine-tenths of the offenses are committed by\r\n          the colored population, and I think the experience\r\n          of every citizen who resides near a settlement\r\n          will testify to their depredating habits.\r\n\r\n          \"'I have given you thus hurriedly and\r\n          disconnectedly my views on these subjects.

I am, my dear sir, faithfully yours.'\r\n                                                 ----- -----.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the testimony of the writer of the above communication,\r\nmy views upon the subject under examination were confirmed by the\r\nvaluable opinion of the Hon. Colonel Prince, the representative of the\r\ncounty in the Provincial Parliament for a long term of years. Colonel\r\nPrince has bestowed much consideration upon the negro question, and he\r\nhas practical experience of the condition and conduct of the colored\r\npopulation. In June, 1858, in the course of a debate in the Legislative\r\nCouncil, Col. Prince was reported to have spoken as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'In the county of Essex the greatest curse that befell them was the\r\nswarm of blacks that infested that county. They were perfectly inundated\r\nwith them. Some of the finest farmers of the county of Kent had actually\r\nleft their beautiful farms, so as not to be near this terrible nuisance.\r\nIf they looked over the criminal calendars of the country they would see\r\nthat the majority of names were those of colored people. They were a\r\nuseless, worthless, thriftless set of people, too lazy and indolent to\r\nwork, and too proud to be taught. . . . . Were the blacks to swarm the\r\ncountry and annoy them with their rascalities? Honorable gentlemen might\r\nspeak feelingly for the negroes, but they had never lived among them as\r\nhe had done. Notwithstanding all that he said about them, they would\r\nsay, if asked on the subject, that they had no better friend than Col.\r\nPrince. But there was no use in trying to get the white man to live with\r\nthem. It was a thing they would not do. There was a great sympathy\r\nalways expressed for the black man who escaped from the slave life; but\r\nhe had lived with them twenty-five years, and had come to the conclusion\r\nthat the black man was born for servitude, and was not fit for any thing\r\nelse. He might listen to the morbid philanthropy of honorable gentlemen\r\nin favor of the negro; but they might as well try to change the spots of\r\nthe leopard as to change the character of the blacks. They would still\r\nretain their idle and thievish propensities.'\r\n\r\n\"While Col. Prince claims that he was very inaccurately reported, and\r\nthat he never said one word in favor of slavery, which he professes to\r\nabhor with a holy horror, he yet adheres to the opinion that the colored\r\nrace is not fit to live and mix in freedom with the whites. He deplores\r\ndeeply the action of such of his countrymen as improperly interfere in\r\nthe affairs of the States, and condemns the lawless running off of\r\nslaves from the South, and the attempts to raise servile insurrection in\r\nthe slaveholding States. As a constitutional British gentleman, he\r\nreveres the laws, and believes that where they are bad, or where the\r\nconstitution of a country is unwise, the remedy lies in the power of the\r\npeople by legal means. He sees the evil effect, morally and socially, of\r\nthe influx of fugitive slaves into Canada, and would shut them out if he\r\ncould. He knows that the negroes form an enormous portion of the\r\ncriminals of his county, and the county of Kent, and he is doubly\r\nannoyed that men who come from servitude to freedom should abuse their\r\nprivileges as the negroes do. He admits that every distinct attempt to\r\nmake a settlement of negroes self-supporting and prosperous, has failed,\r\nand he believes that the negro is not yet fit for self-government, and\r\nrequires over him a guiding, if not a master's hand.\r\n\r\nCol. Prince is a gentleman of the old school--hale, hearty and\r\nwhole-souled--and does not fear to express the sentiments he entertains.\r\n\r\n\"The lessons taught by an examination into the action of the Canadian\r\nabolitionists, and of the condition and prospects of the fugitive slaves\r\nin the Province, should be made useful to the American people. The\r\nhistory of the past proves that Great Britain would gladly destroy the\r\nUnion of the States, which makes the American republic a leading power\r\namong nations. As in days past she sought to accomplish this object\r\nthrough the instrumentality of traitors and of the foes of the Union, so\r\nnow she seeks aid in her designs from the republican abolition enemies\r\nof the confederacy in our own States. The intrigues of the British\r\nemissaries in Canada should stay the hand of every man who fancies that\r\nin helping to rob the South of its slaves he is performing an act of\r\nhumanity; for they should teach him that he is but helping on the\r\ndesigns of those who look eagerly to the slavery agitation and the\r\nsectional passions engendered thereby, to accomplish a disruption of the\r\nUnion, and encompass the failure of our experiment of free\r\ngovernment. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\"Let our merchants and our farmers carefully consider these facts, and\r\nthen reflect upon what they are required by the abolition agitators to\r\ndo. To what end are the systematized negro stealing of the North, the\r\nattempts to incite insurrection at the South, and their natural results,\r\na dissolution of the Union, to lead? Are we to render New York and the\r\nother free States subject to the same deplorable evils as afflict the\r\nwestern counties of Canada? Are our Northern farmers willing to have the\r\nvalue of their lands depreciated, and to subject their crops and stock\r\nto constant depredations by inviting here the same class of neighbors\r\nthat at present deplete whole Canadian townships of their sheep? Unless\r\nwe desire to accomplish such results, why, under a mistaken idea of\r\ncharity to the negro, do we take him from a life of usefulness and\r\ncontent at the South to plant him in freedom and suffering at the North?\r\nWhy do we consent to help forward, directly or indirectly, an agitation\r\nthat can only incite a disruption of the Union and bring upon us the\r\nvery evils we deplore?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT DECISIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the volume was in type, the Supreme Court of Ohio has made a\r\ndecision of great importance to the free colored people. We copy from\r\nthe _Law Journal_, December, 1859:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NEGROES AND THE COMMON SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\"The Supreme Court of Ohio, on Tuesday, on a question before them\r\ninvolving the right of _colored_ children to be admitted into the Common\r\nSchools of the State, decided that the law of the State interfered with\r\nno right of colored children on the subject, and that they were not,\r\ntherefore, entitled of _right_ to the admission demanded. The following\r\nis the reported statement of the case:\r\n\r\n\"'Enos Van Camp _vs._ Board of Equalization of incorporated village of\r\nLogan, Hocking County, Ohio. Error to District Court of Hocking County.\r\n\r\n\"'Peck J. held:\r\n\r\n\"'1. That the statute of March 14, 1853, 'to provide for the\r\nreorganization, supervision, and maintenance of Common Schools, is a law\r\nof _classification_ and not of _exclusion_, providing for the education\r\nof _all_ youths within the prescribed ages, and that the words 'white'\r\nand 'colored,' as used in said act, are used in their popular and\r\nordinary signification.\r\n\r\n\"'2. That children of three-eighths African and five-eighths white\r\nblood, but who are distinctly colored, and generally treated and\r\nregarded as colored children by the community where they reside, are\r\nnot, _as of right_, entitled to admission into the Common Schools, set\r\napart under said act, for the instruction of white youths.\r\n\r\n\"'Brinkherhoff, C.

Banks, on the ground that he believed the chapter in the bill\r\nrelating to the militia, in which the word \"white\" was stricken out, to\r\nbe unconstitutional. In this opinion he is sustained by the Supreme\r\nCourt and by the Attorney General.\r\n\r\nThe matter was discussed in the House at some length, and the veto\r\nsustained by a vote of 146 to 6.\r\n\r\nA new chapter was then introduced on leave, and it being precisely the\r\nsame as the other, except that the word \"white\" was restored, it passed\r\nthe House with but one negative vote.\r\n\r\nUnder a suspension of the rules the new bill was then sent to the\r\nSenate, where, after debate, it was passed by a vote of 11 to 15.\r\n\r\nThe Governor signed the new bill, and the Legislature adjourned _sine\r\ndie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH-SIDE VIEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. Dr. Fuller, of Baltimore, has written a long letter to Hon. Edward\r\nEverett, in regard to the present state of things as regards slavery. We\r\nsubjoin two or three specimens:--_Cincinnati Gazette._\r\n\r\n\"In June, 1845, there assembled in Charleston a body of men,\r\nrepresenting almost all the wisdom and wealth of South Carolina. There\r\nwere present, also, delegates from Georgia, and I believe from other\r\nStates. It was a meeting of the association for the improvement, moral\r\nand religious, of the slave population. The venerable Judge Huger\r\npresided. Having been appointed to address that large and noble\r\naudience, I did not hesitate to speak my whole mind: appealing to\r\nmasters to imitate the Antonines and other magnanimous Roman Emperors,\r\nto become the guardians of their slaves, to have laws enacted protecting\r\nthem in their relations as husbands and wives and parents; to recognize\r\nthe rights which the Gospel asserts for servants as well as masters. In\r\na word, I pressed upon them the solemn obligations which their power\r\nover these human beings imposed upon them--obligations only the more\r\nsacred, because their power was so irresponsible.\r\n\r\n\"That august assembly not only honored me with their attention, but\r\nexpressed their approval, the presiding officer concurring most\r\nemphatically in the views submitted.\r\n\r\n\"I need scarcely tell you that no such address would be regarded as wise\r\nor prudent at this time. It is not that masters are less engaged in\r\nseeking to promote the moral and religious well-being of their servants;\r\nbut measures which once could have been adopted most beneficially would\r\nnow only expose master and servant to the baneful influence of fanatical\r\nintermeddling.\r\n\r\n\"If any thing is certain, it is that the Gospel does not recognise\r\nhatred, abuse, violence and blood as the means by which good is to be\r\ndone. The Gospel is a system of love. It assails no established social\r\nrelations, but it infuses love into the hearts of those who are bound\r\ntogether, and thus unites them in affection.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he says:\r\n\r\n\"I think I speak accurately when I say, that hitherto every sacrifice\r\nfor the emancipation of slaves has been made by Southern men; and many\r\nhundred thousand dollars have been expended in such liberations. The\r\nNorth has wasted large sums for abolition books and lectures; for\r\naddresses calculated to inflame the imaginations of women and children,\r\nand to mislead multitudes of men--most excellent and pious--but utterly\r\nignorant as to the condition of things at the South. We now find,\r\nindeed, that money has been contributed even for the purchase of deadly\r\nweapons to be employed against the South, and to enlist the most\r\nferocious passions in secret crusades, compared with which an open\r\ninvasion by foreign enemies would be a blessing. I believe, however,\r\nthat not one cent has yet been given to set on foot--or even encourage\r\nwhen proposed--any plausible enterprise for the benefit of the slave.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I do now believe that the guardianship of a kind master is at this time\r\na great blessing to the African. If emancipation is ever to take place,\r\nit will be gradually, and under the mild, but resistless influence of\r\nthe Gospel. Whether slavery be an evil or not, we at the South did not\r\nbring these Africans here--we protested against their introduction. The\r\ntrue friend of the African is at the South, and thousands of hearts\r\nthere are seeking to know what can be done for the race. There must be\r\nsome limits to human responsibility, and a man in New England has no\r\nmore right to interfere with the institutions of Virginia, than he has\r\nto interfere with those of England or France. All such interference\r\nwill be repelled by the master, but it will prove injurious to the\r\nslave. Dr. Channing was regarded as a leading abolitionist in his day,\r\nbut could that noble man now rise up, he would stand aghast at the\r\nmadness which is rife everywhere on this subject. 'One great principle,\r\nwhich we should lay down as immovably true, is, that if a good work\r\ncannot be carried on by the calm, self-controlled, benevolent spirit of\r\nChristianity, then the time for doing it has not yet come.' Such was his\r\nlanguage, when opposing slavery. Were he now living, the delirious\r\nspirit of the day would denounce him, as it denounced Mr. Webster, and\r\nnow denounces you and every true patriot. Nay, even Mr. Beecher is\r\nabused as not truculent enough.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus saw slavery all around him. Did he seek to employ force? He said\r\n'All power in heaven and earth is given unto me, therefore, go teach, go\r\npreach the Gospel.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORED PEOPLE EMIGRATING FROM LOUISIANA TO HAYTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _New Orleans Picayune_ notices that a vessel cleared from that port\r\non the previous day, having on board eighty-one free colored persons,\r\nemigrating to Hayti. The _Picayune_ says:\r\n\r\n\"These people are all from the Opelousas parishes, and all\r\ncultivators--well versed in farming, and in all the mechanical arts\r\nconnected with a farm. Among them are brickmakers, blacksmiths,\r\nwheelwrights, carpenters, etc. Some of them are proficient weavers, who\r\nhave long been employed making the stuff called Attakapas cottonade, so\r\nfavorably known in the market. They take along with them the necessary\r\nmachinery for that trade, and all sorts of agricultural and mechanical\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\n\"These eighty-one persons--twenty-four adults and fifty-seven children\r\nand youths--compose fourteen families, or rather households, for they\r\nare all related, and the eighty-one may be called one family. They are\r\nall in easy circumstances, some even rich, one family being worth as\r\nmuch as $50,000. They were all land owners in this State, and have sold\r\nout their property with the intention of investing their capital in\r\nHayti.\"--\r\n\r\n          _Cincinnati Commercial_, January, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COOLIE TRAFFIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be well to put upon record one of those extreme cases of hardship\r\nand cruelty which necessarily accompany the transportation of laborers\r\nto the West Indies, whether under the name of the slave trade, or coolie\r\nimmigration. The China correspondent of the _New York Journal of\r\nCommerce_, of a recent date, says: The Flora Temple, an English vessel,\r\nhad made all arrangements to secure a full cargo of coolies. They were\r\ncheated, inveigled, or stolen, and either taken directly to the ship or\r\nelse confined in the barracoons in Macao till the ship was ready to\r\nsail for Havanna--the crew numbering fifty, and the coolies eight\r\nhundred and fifty. The vessel sailed October 8, 1859, when the coolies\r\nsoon learned their destiny, and resolved to avert it at all hazards. On\r\nthe morning of the 11th, without weapons of any kind, they rushed upon\r\nthe guard and killed him. The noise brought the captain and his brother\r\non deck, fully armed with revolvers, who by rapid firing and resolutely\r\npressing forward, drove the miserable wretches below; where, without\r\nlight and air, they were locked and barred like felons, in a space too\r\nlimited to permit their living during the long voyage before them. Think\r\nof eight hundred and fifty human beings all full grown men, pressed into\r\nthis contracted, rayless, airless dungeon, in which they were to be\r\ndeported from China to Havana, all the long way over the China sea, the\r\nIndian ocean, and the Atlantic!\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, the vessel struck upon an unknown reef, a gale of wind in\r\nthe meantime blowing, and the sea running high. Every effort was made to\r\nsave the ship by the officers and crew; the poor coolies, battened down\r\nbeneath the decks, being allowed no chance to aid in saving the ship or\r\nthemselves. Although the yards were \"braced around\" and the ship \"hove\r\naback,\" she struck first slightly, and then soon after several times\r\nwith a tremendous crash, the breakers running alongside very high.\r\nPieces of her timbers and planking floated up on her port side, and\r\nafter some more heavy thumps she remained apparently immovable. The\r\nwater rapidly increased in the hold till it reached the \"between-decks,\"\r\nwhere the eight hundred and fifty coolies were confined.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, indeed, almost immediately after the ship first\r\nstruck, the officers and crew very naturally became afraid of the\r\ncoolies for the treatment they had received, and the captain ordered the\r\nboats to be lowered, not to save the coolies in whole or in part, but to\r\npreserve himself and crew. These boats, even under favorable\r\ncircumstances, were not more than sufficient for the officers and crew,\r\nshowing that no provision had been made for the poor coolies in case of\r\ndisaster. The boats passed safely through the breakers, leaving the ship\r\nalmost without motion, all her masts standing, her back broken, and the\r\nsea making a clear break over her starboard and quarter.\r\n\r\nWhen the boats left the ship, and steered away, without making an effort\r\nto save the eight hundred and fifty coolies, or allowing them to do any\r\nthing themselves, with their last look toward the ship they saw that the\r\ncoolies had escaped from their prison through doors which the concussion\r\nhad made for them, and stood clustering together, helpless and\r\ndespairing, upon the decks, and gazing upon the abyss which was opening\r\nits jaws to receive them. My friend assures me that he knows these poor\r\ncreatures were completely imprisoned all the night these terrible\r\noccurences were going on, the hatches being \"battened down,\" and made as\r\nsecure as a jail door under lock and bars.\r\n\r\nThe ship was three hundred miles from land when it struck, and after\r\nfourteen days of toil and struggle, one of the boats only succeeded in\r\nreaching Towron, in Cochin-China. The three other boats were never heard\r\nof. Here the French fleet was lying; and the admiral at once sent one of\r\nhis vessels to the fatal scene of the disaster, where some of the wreck\r\nwas to be seen; but not a _single coolie_! Every one of the _eight\r\nhundred and fifty_ had perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\nFACTS IN RELATION TO COTTON--ITS GROWTH, MANUFACTURE, AND INFLUENCE ON\r\nCOMMERCE, SLAVERY, EMANCIPATION, ETC., CHRONOLOGICALLY ARRANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\n          | Great Britain Annual Import | United States' Annual    |\r\n   YEARS. | and Consumption of Cotton,  | Exports Cotton to Great  |\r\n          | from earliest dates to      | Britain and Europe       |\r\n          | 1858, in lbs.               | generally.               |\r\n  --------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\r\n    1641  | Cotton manufacture first    |                          |\r\n          | named in English history.   |                          |\r\n          |                             |                          |\r\n          |      TOTAL IMPORTS.         |                          |\r\n    1697  |        1,976,359            |                          |\r\n    1701  |        1,985,868            |                          |\r\n    1700  |}                            |                          |\r\n     to   |}       1,170,881            |                          |\r\n    1705  |}                            |                          |\r\n    1710  |          715,008            |                          |\r\n    1720  |        1,972,805            |                          |\r\n    1730  |        1,545,472            |                          |\r\n    1741  |        1,645,031            | 1747-48, 7 bags of       |\r\n    1751  |        2,976,610            | Cotton were shipped from |\r\n    1764  |        3,870,392            | Charleston, S.

This\r\nwill explain any seeming discrepancy in the imports by her from us, and\r\nour exports to her.\r\n\r\nN. B.--In 1781 Great Britain commenced re-exporting a portion of her\r\nimports of Cotton to the Continent; but the amount did not reach a\r\nmillion of pounds, except in one year, until 1810, when it rose to over\r\neight millions. The next year, however, it fell to a million and a\r\nquarter, and only rose, from near that amount, to six millions in 1814\r\nand 1815. From 1818, her _consumption_, only, of cotton, is given, as\r\nbest representing her relations to slave labor for that commodity. After\r\nthis date her exports of cotton gradually enlarged, until, in 1853, they\r\nreached over one hundred and forty-seven millions of pounds. Of this,\r\nover eighty-two millions were derived from the United States, and over\r\nfifty-nine millions from India. That is to say, of her imports of\r\n180,431,000 lbs. in 1853, from India, she re-exported 59,000,000.\r\n\r\nWe are enabled to add, for our second edition, that the imports of\r\nCotton into Great Britain, from India, for 1854, amounted to 119,835,968\r\nlbs., of which 66,405,920 lbs. were re-exported; and that her imports\r\nfrom the same for 1855 amounted to 145,218,976 lbs., of which 66,210,704\r\nlbs. were re-exported; thus leaving, for the former year, but 53,430,048\r\nlbs., and for the latter but 79,008,272 lbs. of East India Cotton for\r\nconsumption in England. The present condition of cotton supplies from\r\nIndia up to 1859, will be seen in the extracts from the _London\r\nEconomist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\n          TABULAR STATEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS,\r\n          DOMESTIC ANIMALS, ETC., EXPORTED FROM THE UNITED\r\n          STATES: THE TOTAL VALUE OF PRODUCTS AND ANIMALS\r\n          RAISED IN THE COUNTRY; AND THE VALUE OF THE\r\n          PORTION THEREOF LEFT FOR HOME CONSUMPTION AND USE,\r\n          FOR THE YEAR 1853.

differ slightly from some other estimates, as must\r\nbe the case in all computations that are not official, but that from\r\nexamination it has reason to think them as near the truth as any\r\npractical object can require.

D.,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERTY AND SLAVERY:\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\nSLAVERY IN THE LIGHT OF MORAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS work has, for the most part, been thought out for several years,\r\nand various portions of it reduced to writing. Though we have long\r\ncherished the design of preparing it for the press, yet other\r\nengagements, conspiring with a spirit of procrastination, have hitherto\r\ninduced us to defer the execution of this design. Nor should we have\r\nprosecuted it, as we have done, during a large portion of our last\r\nsummer vacation, and the leisure moments of the first two months of the\r\npresent session of the University, but for the solicitation of two\r\nintelligent and highly-esteemed friends. In submitting the work, as it\r\nnow is, to the judgment of the truth-loving and impartial reader, we beg\r\nleave to offer one or two preliminary remarks.\r\n\r\nWe have deemed it wise and proper to notice only the more decent,\r\nrespectable, and celebrated among the abolitionists of the North. Those\r\nscurrilous writers, who deal in wholesale abuse of Southern character,\r\nwe have deemed unworthy of notice. Their writings are, no doubt, adapted\r\nto the taste of their readers; but as it is certain that no educated\r\ngentleman will tolerate them, so we would not raise a finger to promote\r\ntheir downfall, nor to arrest their course toward the oblivion which so\r\ninevitably awaits them.\r\n\r\nIn replying to the others, we are conscious that we have often used\r\nstrong language; for which, however, we have no apology to offer. We\r\nhave dealt with their arguments and positions rather than with their\r\nmotives and characters. If, in pursuing this course, we have often\r\nspoken strongly, we merely beg the reader to consider whether we have\r\nnot also spoken justly. We have certainly not spoken without\r\nprovocation. For even these men--the very lights and ornaments of\r\nabolitionism--have seldom condescended to argue the great question of\r\nLiberty and Slavery with us as with equals. On the contrary, they\r\nhabitually address us as if nothing but a purblind ignorance of the very\r\nfirst elements of moral science could shield our minds against the force\r\nof their irresistible arguments. In the overflowing exuberance of their\r\nphilanthropy, they take pity of our most lamentable moral darkness, and\r\ngraciously condescend to teach us the very A B C of ethical philosophy!\r\nHence, if we have deemed it a duty to lay bare their pompous inanities,\r\nshowing them to be no oracles, and to strip their pitiful sophisms of\r\nthe guise of a profound philosophy, we trust that no impartial reader\r\nwill take offense at such vindication of the South against her accusers\r\nand despisers.\r\n\r\nIn this vindication, we have been careful throughout to distinguish\r\nbetween the abolitionists, our accusers, and the great body of the\r\npeople of the North. Against these we have said nothing, and we could\r\nsay nothing; since for these we entertain the most profound respect. We\r\nhave only assailed those by whom we have been assailed; and we have held\r\neach and every man responsible only for what he himself has said and\r\ndone. We should, indeed, despise ourselves if we could be guilty of the\r\nmonstrous injustice of denouncing a whole people on account of the\r\nsayings and doings of a portion of them. We had infinitely rather suffer\r\nsuch injustice--as we have so long done--than practice it toward others.\r\n\r\nWe cannot flatter ourselves, of course, that the following work is\r\nwithout errors. But these, whatever else may be thought of them, are not\r\nthe errors of haste and inconsideration. For if we have felt deeply on\r\nthe subject here discussed, we have also thought long, and patiently\r\nendeavored to guard our minds against fallacy. How far this effort has\r\nproved successful, it is the province of the candid and impartial reader\r\nalone to decide. If our arguments and views are unsound, we hope he will\r\nreject them. On the contrary, if they are correct and well-grounded, we\r\nhope he will concur with us in the conclusion, that the institution of\r\nslavery, as it exists among us at the South, is founded in political\r\njustice, is in accordance with the will of GOD and the designs of his\r\nprovidence, and is conducive to the highest, purest, best interests of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF CIVIL LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n          The commonly-received definition of Civil\r\n          Liberty.--Examination of the commonly-received\r\n          definition of Civil Liberty.--No good law ever\r\n          limits or abridges the Natural Liberty of\r\n          Mankind.--The distinction between Rights and\r\n          Liberty.--The Relation between the State of Nature\r\n          and Civil Society.--Inherent and Inalienable\r\n          Rights.--Conclusion of the First Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW subjects, if any, more forcibly demand our attention, by their\r\nintrinsic grandeur and importance, than the great doctrine of human\r\nliberty. Correct views concerning this are, indeed, so intimately\r\nconnected with the most profound interests, as well as with the most\r\nexalted aspirations, of the human race, that any material departure\r\ntherefrom must be fraught with evil to the living, as well as to\r\nmillions yet unborn. They are so inseparably interwoven with all that is\r\ngreat and good and glorious in the destiny of man, that whosoever aims\r\nto form or to propagate such views should proceed with the utmost care,\r\nand, laying aside all prejudice and passion, be guided by the voice of\r\nreason alone.\r\n\r\nHence it is to be regretted--deeply regretted--that the doctrine of\r\nliberty has so often been discussed with so little apparent care, with\r\nso little moral earnestness, with so little real energetic searching and\r\nlonging after truth. Though its transcendent importance demands the best\r\nexertion of all our powers, yet has it been, for the most part, a theme\r\nfor passionate declamation, rather than of severe analysis or of\r\nprotracted and patient investigation. In the warm praises of the\r\nphilosopher, no less than in the glowing inspirations of the poet, it\r\noften stands before us as a vague and ill-defined _something_ which all\r\nmen are required to worship, but which no man is bound to understand. It\r\nwould seem, indeed, as if it were a mighty something not to be clearly\r\nseen, but only to be deeply felt. And felt it has been, too, by the\r\nignorant as well as by the learned, by the simple as well as by the\r\nwise: felt as a fire in the blood, as a fever in the brain, and as a\r\nphantom in the imagination, rather than as a form of light and beauty in\r\nthe intelligence. How often have the powers of darkness surrounded its\r\nthrone, and desolation marked its path! How often from the altars of\r\nthis _unknown idol_ has the blood of human victims streamed! Even here,\r\nin this glorious land of ours, how often do the _too-religious_\r\nAmericans seem to become deaf to the most appalling lessons of the past,\r\nwhile engaged in the frantic worship of this their tutelary deity! At\r\nthis very moment, the highly favored land in which we live is convulsed\r\nfrom its centre to its circumference, by the agitations of these pious\r\ndevotees of freedom; and how long ere scenes like those which called\r\nforth the celebrated exclamation of Madame Roland--\"O Liberty, what\r\ncrimes are perpetrated in thy name!\" may be enacted among us, it is not\r\npossible for human sagacity or foresight to determine.\r\n\r\nIf no one would talk about liberty except those who had taken the pains\r\nto understand it, then would a perfect calm be restored, and peace once\r\nmore bless a happy people. But there are so many who imagine they\r\nunderstand liberty as Falstaff knew the true prince, namely, by\r\ninstinct, that all hope of such a consummation must be deferred until it\r\nmay be shown that their instinct is a blind guide, and its oracles are\r\nfalse. Hence the necessity of a close study and of a clear analysis of\r\nthe nature and conditions of civil liberty, in order to a distinct\r\ndelineation of the great idol, which all men are so ready to worship,\r\nbut which so few are willing to take the pains to understand. In the\r\nprosecution of such an inquiry, we intend to consult neither the\r\npecuniary interests of the South nor the prejudices of the North; but\r\ncalmly and immovably proceed to discuss, upon purely scientific\r\nprinciples, this great problem of our social existence and national\r\nprosperity, upon the solution of which the hopes and destinies of\r\nmankind in no inconsiderable measure depend. We intend no appeal to\r\npassion or to sordid interest, but only to the reason of the wise and\r\ngood. And if justice, or mercy, or truth, be found at war with the\r\ninstitution of slavery, then, in the name of God, let slavery perish.\r\nBut however guilty, still let it be tried, condemned, and executed\r\naccording to law, and not extinguished by a despotic and lawless power\r\nmore terrific than itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ I. _The commonly-received definition of civil liberty._\r\n\r\n\"Civil liberty,\" says Blackstone, \"is no other than natural liberty so\r\nfar restrained as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage.\"\r\nThis definition seems to have been borrowed from Locke, who says that,\r\nwhen a man enters into civil society, \"he is to part with so much of his\r\n_natural liberty_, in providing for himself, as the good, prosperity,\r\nand safety of the society shall require.\" So, likewise, say Paley,\r\nBerlamaqui, Rutherforth, and a host of others. Indeed, among jurists and\r\nphilosophers, such seems to be the commonly-received definition of civil\r\nliberty. It seems to have become a political maxim that civil liberty is\r\nno other than a certain portion of our natural liberty, which has been\r\ncarved therefrom, and secured to us by the protection of the laws.\r\n\r\nBut is this a sound maxim? Has it been deduced from the nature of\r\nthings, or is it merely a plausible show of words? Is it truth--solid\r\nand imperishable truth--or merely one of those fair semblances of truth,\r\nwhich, through the too hasty sanction of great names, have obtained a\r\ncurrency among men? The question is not what Blackstone, or Locke, or\r\nPaley may have thought, but what is truth? Let us examine this point,\r\nthen, in order that our decision may be founded, not upon the authority\r\nof man, but, if possible, in the wisdom of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II. _Examination of the commonly-received definition of civil\r\nliberty._\r\n\r\nBefore we can determine whether such be the origin of civil liberty, we\r\nmust first ascertain the character of that natural liberty out of which\r\nit is supposed to be reserved. What, then, is natural liberty? What is\r\nthe nature of the material out of which our civil liberty is supposed to\r\nbe fashioned by the art of the political sculptor? It is thus defined by\r\nLocke: \"To understand political power right, and derive it from its\r\noriginal, we must consider what state all men are naturally in; and that\r\nis a state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of\r\ntheir possessions and persons as they think fit, _within the bounds of\r\nthe law of nature_, without asking leave or depending upon the will of\r\nany other man.\"[136] In perfect accordance with this definition,\r\nBlackstone says: \"This natural liberty consists in a power of acting as\r\none thinks fit, without any restraint or control, unless by the laws of\r\nnature, being a right inherent in us by birth, and one of the gifts of\r\nGod to man at his creation, when he endowed him with the faculty of\r\nfree-will.\" Such, according to Locke and Blackstone, is that natural\r\nliberty, which is limited and abridged, as they suppose, when we enter\r\ninto the bonds of civil society.\r\n\r\nNow mark its features: it is the gift of God to man at his creation; the\r\nvery top and flower of his existence; that by which he is distinguished\r\nfrom the lower animals and raised to the rank of moral and accountable\r\nbeings. Shall we sacrifice this divine gift, then, in order to secure\r\nthe blessings of civil society? Shall we abridge or mutilate the image\r\nof God, stamped upon the soul at its creation, by which we are capable\r\nof knowing and obeying his law, in order to secure the aid and\r\nprotection of man? Shall we barter away any portion of this our glorious\r\nbirthright for any poor boon of man's devising? Yes, we are told--and\r\nwhy? Because, says Blackstone, \"Legal obedience and conformity is\r\ninfinitely more valuable than _the wild and savage liberty which is\r\nsacrificed to obtain it_.\"\r\n\r\nBut how is this? _Now_ this natural liberty is a thing of light, and\r\n_now_ it is a power of darkness. Now it is the gift of God, that moves\r\nwithin a sphere of light, and breathes an atmosphere of love; and anon,\r\nit is a wild and savage thing that carries terror in its train. It would\r\nbe an angel of light, if it were not a power of darkness; and it would\r\nbe a power of darkness, if it were not an angel of light. But as it is,\r\nit is both by turns, and neither long, but runs through its Protean\r\nchanges, according to the exigencies of the flowing discourse of the\r\nlearned author. Surely such inconsistency, so glaring and so portentous,\r\nand all exhibited on one and the same page, is no evidence that the\r\ngenius of the great commentator was as steady and profound as it was\r\nelegant and classical.\r\n\r\nThe source of this vacillation is obvious. With Locke, he defines\r\nnatural liberty to be a power of acting as one thinks fit, _within the\r\nlimits prescribed by the law of nature_; but he soon loses sight of\r\nthis all-important limitation, from which natural liberty derives its\r\nform and beauty. Hence it becomes in his mind a power to act as one\r\npleases, without the restraint or control of any law whatever, either\r\nhuman or divine. The sovereign will and pleasure of the individual\r\nbecomes the only rule of conduct, and lawless anarchy the condition\r\nwhich it legitimates. Thus, having loosed the bonds and marred the\r\nbeauty of natural liberty, he was prepared to see it, now become so\r\n\"wild and savage,\" offered up as a sacrifice on the altar of civil\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThis, too, was the great fundamental error of Hobbes. What Blackstone\r\nthus did through inadvertency, was knowingly and designedly done by the\r\nphilosopher of Malmesbury. In a state of nature, says he, all men have a\r\nright to do as they please. Each individual may set up a right to all\r\nthings, and consequently to the same things. In other words, in such a\r\nstate there is no law, exept that of force. The strong arm of power is\r\nthe supreme arbiter of all things. Robbery and outrage and murder are as\r\nlawful as their opposites. That is to say, there is no such thing as a\r\nlaw of nature; and consequently all things are, in a state of nature,\r\nequally allowable. Thus it was that Hobbes delighted to legitimate the\r\nhorrors of a state of nature, as it is called, in order that mankind\r\nmight, without a feeling of indignation or regret, see the wild and\r\nferocious liberty of such a state sacrificed to despotic power. Thus it\r\nwas that he endeavoured to recommend the \"Leviathan,\" by contrasting it\r\nwith the huger monster called Natural Liberty.\r\n\r\nThis view of the state of nature, by which all law and the great\r\nFountain of all law are shut out of the world, was perfectly agreeable\r\nto the atheistical philosophy of Hobbes. From one who had extinguished\r\nthe light of nature, and given dominion to the powers of darkness, no\r\nbetter could have been expected; but is it not deplorable that a\r\nChristian jurist should, even for a moment, have forgotten the great\r\ncentral light of his own system, and drawn his arguments from such an\r\nabyss of darkness?\r\n\r\nBlackstone has thus lost sight of truth, not only in regard to his\r\ngeneral propositions, but also in regard to particular instances. \"The\r\nlaw,\" says he, \"which restrains a man from doing mischief to his\r\nfellow-citizens diminishes the natural liberty of mankind.\" Now, is this\r\ntrue? The doing of mischief is contrary to the law of nature, and hence,\r\naccording to the definition of Blackstone himself, the perpetration of\r\nit is not an exercise of any natural right. As no man possesses a\r\nnatural right to do mischief, so the law which forbids it does not\r\ndiminish the natural liberty of mankind. The law which forbids mischief\r\nis a restraint not upon the _natural liberty_, but upon the _natural\r\ntyranny_, of man.\r\n\r\nBlackstone is by no means alone in the error to which we have alluded.\r\nBy one of the clearest thinkers and most beautiful writers of the\r\npresent age,[137] it is argued, \"that as government implies restraint,\r\nit is evident we give up a certain portion of our liberty by entering\r\ninto it.\" This argument would be valid, no doubt, if there were nothing\r\nin the world beside liberty to be restrained; but the evil passions of\r\nmen, from which proceed so many frightful tyrannies and wrongs, are not\r\nto be identified with their rights or liberties. As government implies\r\nrestraint, it is evident that something is restrained when we enter into\r\nit; but it does not follow that this something must be our natural\r\nliberty. The argument in question proceeds on the notion that government\r\ncan restrain nothing, unless it restrain the natural liberty of mankind;\r\nwhereas, we have seen, the law which forbids the perpetration of\r\nmischief, or any other wrong, is a restriction, not upon the _liberty_,\r\nbut upon the _tyranny_, of the human will. It sets a bound and limit,\r\nnot to any right conferred on us by the Author of nature, but upon the\r\nevil thoughts and deeds of which we are the sole and exclusive\r\noriginators. Such a law, indeed, so far from restraining the natural\r\nliberty of man, recognizes his natural rights, and secures his freedom,\r\nby protecting the weak against the injustice and oppression of the\r\nstrong. The way in which these authors show that natural liberty is, and\r\nof right ought to be, abridged by the laws of society, is, by\r\nidentifying this natural freedom, not with a power to act as God wills,\r\nbut with a power in conformity with our own sovereign will and pleasure.\r\nThe same thing is expressly done by Paley.[138] \"To do what we will,\"\r\nsays he, \"is natural liberty.\" Starting from this definition, it is no\r\nwonder that he should have supposed that natural liberty is restrained\r\nby civil government. In like manner, Burke first says, \"That the effect\r\nof liberty to individuals is, _that they may do what they please_;\" and\r\nthen concludes, that in order to \"secure some liberty,\" we make \"a\r\nsurrender in trust of the whole of it.\"[139] Thus the natural rights of\r\nmankind are first caricatured, and then sacrificed.\r\n\r\nIf there be no God, if there be no difference between right and wrong,\r\nif there be no moral law in the universe, then indeed would men possess\r\na natural right to do mischief or to act as they please. Then indeed\r\nshould we be fettered by no law in a state of nature, and liberty\r\ntherein would be coextensive with power. Right would give place to\r\nmight, and the least restraint, even from the best laws, would impair\r\nour natural freedom. But we subscribe to no such philosophy. That\r\nlearned authors, that distinguished jurists, that celebrated\r\nphilosophers, that pious divines, should thus deliberately include the\r\nenjoyment of our natural rights and the indulgence of our evil passions\r\nin one and the same definition of liberty, is, it seems to us, matter of\r\nthe most profound astonishment and regret. It is to confound the source\r\nof all tyranny with the fountain of all freedom. It is to put darkness\r\nfor light, and light for darkness. And it is to inflame the minds of men\r\nwith the idea that they are struggling and contending for liberty, when,\r\nin reality, they may be only struggling and contending for the\r\ngratification of their malignant passions. Such an offense against all\r\nclear thinking, such an outrage against all sound political ethics,\r\nbecomes the more amazing when we reflect on the greatness of the authors\r\nby whom it is committed, and the stupendous magnitude of the interests\r\ninvolved in their discussions.\r\n\r\nShould we, then, exhibit the fundamental law of society, and the natural\r\nliberty of mankind, as antagonistic principles? Is not this the way to\r\nprepare the human mind, at all times so passionately, not to say so\r\nmadly, fond of freedom, for a repetition of those tremendous conflicts\r\nand struggles beneath which the foundations of society have so often\r\ntrembled, and some of its best institutions been laid in the dust? In\r\none word, is it not high time to raise the inquiry, Whether there be, in\r\nreality, any such opposition as is usually supposed to exist between the\r\nlaw of the land and the natural rights of mankind? Whether such\r\nopposition be real or imaginary? Whether it exists in the nature of\r\nthings, or only in the imagination of political theorists?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ III. _No good law ever limits or abridges the natural liberty of\r\nmankind_\r\n\r\nBy the two great leaders of opposite schools, Locke and Burke, it is\r\ncontended that when we enter into society the natural rights of\r\nself-defense is surrendered to the government. If any natural right,\r\nthen, be limited or abridged by the laws of society, we may suppose the\r\nright of self-defense to be so; for this is the instance which is always\r\nselected to illustrate and confirm the reality of such a surrender of\r\nour natural liberty. It has, indeed, become a sort of maxim, that when\r\nwe put on the bonds of civil society, we give up the natural right of\r\nself-defense.\r\n\r\nBut what does this maxim mean? Does it mean that we transfer the right\r\nto repel force by force? If so, the proposition is not true; for this\r\nright is as fully possessed by every individual after he has entered\r\ninto society as it could have been in a state of nature. If he is\r\nassailed, or threatened with immediate personal danger, the law of the\r\nland does not require him to wait upon the strong but slow arm of\r\ngovernment for protection. On the contrary, it permits him to protect\r\nhimself, to repel force by force, in so far as this may be necessary to\r\nguard against injury to himself; and the law of nature allows no more.\r\nIndeed, if there be any difference, the law of the land allows a man to\r\ngo further in the defense of self than he is permitted to go by the law\r\nof God. Hence, in this sense, the maxim under consideration is not true;\r\nand no man's natural liberty is abridged by the State.\r\n\r\nDoes this maxim mean, then, that in a state of nature every man has a\r\nright to redress his own wrongs by the _subsequent_ punishment of the\r\noffender, which right the citizen has transferred to the government? It\r\nis clear that this must be the meaning, if it have any correct meaning\r\nat all. But neither in this sense is the maxim or proposition true. The\r\nright to punish an offender must rest upon the one or the other of two\r\ngrounds: either upon the ground that the offender deserves punishment,\r\nor that his punishment is necessary to prevent similar offenses. Now,\r\nupon neither of these grounds has any man, even in a state of nature,\r\nthe right to punish an offense committed against himself.\r\n\r\nFirst, he has no right to punish such an offense on the ground that it\r\ndeserves punishment. No man has, or ever had, the right to wield the\r\nawful attribute of retributive justice; that is, to inflict so much pain\r\nfor so much guilt or moral turpitude. This is the prerogative of God\r\nalone. To his eye, all secrets are known, and all degrees of guilt\r\nperfectly apparent; and to him alone belongs the vengeance which is due\r\nfor moral ill-desert. His law extends over the state of nature as well\r\nas over the state of civil society, and calls all men to account for\r\ntheir evil deeds. It is evident that, in so far as the intrinsic demerit\r\nof actions is concerned, it makes no difference whether they be punished\r\nhere or hereafter. And beside, if the individual had possessed such a\r\nright in a state of nature, he has not transferred it to society; for\r\nsociety neither has nor claims any such right. Blackstone but utters the\r\nvoice of the law when he says: \"The end or final cause of human\r\npunishment is not by way of atonement or expiation, for that must be\r\nleft to the just determination of the supreme Being, but a precaution\r\nagainst future offenses of the same kind.\" The exercise of retributive\r\njustice belongs exclusively to the infallible Ruler of the world, and\r\nnot to frail, erring man, who himself so greatly stands in need of\r\nmercy. Hence, the right to punish a transgressor on the ground that such\r\npunishment is deserved, has not been transferred from the individual to\r\ncivil society: first, because he had no such natural right to transfer;\r\nand, secondly, because society possesses no such right.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, if we consider the other ground of punishment, it\r\nwill likewise appear that the right to punish never belonged to the\r\nindividual, and consequently could not have been transferred by him to\r\nsociety. For, by the law of nature, the individual has no right to\r\npunish an offense against himself _in order to prevent further offences\r\nof the same kind_. If the object of human punishment be, as indeed it\r\nis, to prevent the commission of crime, by holding up examples of terror\r\nto evil-doers, then, it is evidently no more the natural right of the\r\nparty injured to redress the wrong, than it is the right of others. All\r\nmen are interested in the prevention of wrongs, and hence all men should\r\nunite to redress them. All men are endowed by their Creator with a sense\r\nof justice, in order to impel them to secure its claims, and throw the\r\nshield of its protection around the weak and oppressed.\r\n\r\nThe prevention of wrong, then, is clearly the natural duty, and\r\nconsequently the natural right, of all men.\r\n\r\nThis duty should be discharged by others, rather than by the party\r\naggrieved. For it is contrary to the law of nature itself, as both Locke\r\nand Burke agree, that any man should be \"judge in his own case;\" that\r\nany man should, by an _ex post facto_ decision, determine the amount of\r\npunishment due to his enemy, and proceed to inflict it upon him. Such a\r\ncourse, indeed, so far from preventing offenses, would inevitably\r\npromote them; instead of redressing injuries, would only add wrong to\r\nwrong; and instead of introducing order, would only make confusion worse\r\nconfounded, and turn the moral world quite upside down.\r\n\r\nOn no ground, then, upon which the right to punish may be conceived to\r\nrest, does it appear that it was ever possessed, or could ever have been\r\npossessed, by the individual. And if the individual never possessed such\r\na right, it is clear that he has never transferred it to society. Hence,\r\nthis view of the origin of government, however plausible at first sight,\r\nor however generally received, has no real foundation in the nature of\r\nthings. It is purely a creature of the imagination of theorists; one of\r\nthe phantoms of that manifold, monstrous, phantom deity called Liberty,\r\nwhich has been so often invoked by the _pseudo_ philanthropists and\r\nreckless reformers of the present day to subvert not only the law of\r\ncapital punishment, but also other institutions and laws which have\r\nreceived the sanction of both God and man.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth is, that we are all bound by the law of nature and the\r\nlaw of God to love our neighbor as ourselves. Hence it is the duty of\r\nevery man, in a state of nature, to do all in his power to protect the\r\nrights and promote the interests of his fellow-men. It is the duty of\r\nall men to consult together, and concert measures for the general good.\r\nRight here it is, then, that the law of man, the constitution of civil\r\nsociety, comes into contact with the law of God and rests upon it. Thus,\r\ncivil society arises, not from a surrender of individual rights, but\r\nfrom a right originally possessed by all; nay, from a solemn duty\r\noriginally imposed upon all by God himself--a duty which must be\r\nperformed, whether the individual gives his consent or not. The very law\r\nof nature itself requires, as we have seen, not only the punishment of\r\nthe offender, but also that he be punished acccording to a\r\npre-established law, and by the decision of an impartial tribunal. And\r\nin the enactment of such law, as well as in the administration, the\r\ncollective wisdom of society, or its agents, moves in obedience to the\r\nlaw of God, and not in pursuance of rights derived from the individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ IV. _The distinction between rights and liberty._\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing discussion we have, in conformity to the custom of\r\nothers, used the terms _rights_ and _liberty_ as words of precisely the\r\nsame import. But, instead of being convertible terms, there seems to be\r\na very clear difference in their signification. If a man be taken, for\r\nexample, and without cause thrown into prison, this deprives him of his\r\n_liberty_, but not of his _right_, to go where he pleases. The right\r\nstill exists; and his not being allowed to enjoy this right, is\r\nprecisely what constitutes the oppression in the case supposed. If there\r\nwere no right still subsisting, then there would be no oppression.\r\nHence, as the _right_ exists, while the _liberty_ is extinguished, it is\r\nevident they are distinct from each other. The liberty of a man in such\r\na case, as in all others, would consist in an opportunity to enjoy his\r\nright, or in a state in which it might be enjoyed if he so pleased.\r\n\r\nThis distinction between rights and liberty is all-important to a clear\r\nand satisfactory discussion of the doctrine of human freedom. The great\r\nchampions of that freedom, from a Locke down to a Hall, firmly and\r\npassionately grasping the natural rights of man, and confounding these\r\nwith his liberty, have looked upon society as the restrainer, and not as\r\nthe author, of that liberty. On the other hand, the great advocates of\r\ndespotic power, from a Hobbes down to a Whewell, seeing that there can\r\nbe no genuine liberty--that is, no secure enjoyment of one's rights--in\r\na state of nature, have ascribed, not only our liberty, but all our\r\nexisting rights also, to the State.\r\n\r\nBut the error of Locke is a noble and generous sentiment when compared\r\nwith the odious dogma of Hobbes and Whewell. These learned authors\r\ncontend that we derive all our existing rights from society. Do we,\r\nthen, live and move and breathe and think and worship God only by rights\r\nderived from the State? No, certainly. We have these rights from a\r\nhigher source. God gave them, and all the powers of earth combined\r\ncannot take them away. But as for our liberty, this we freely own is,\r\nfor the most part, due to the sacred bonds of civil society. Let us\r\nrender unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things\r\nthat are God's.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ V. _The relation between the state of nature and of civil society._\r\n\r\nHerein, then, consists the true relation between the _natural_ and the\r\n_social_ states. Civil society does not abridge our natural rights, but\r\nsecures and protects them. She does not assume our right of\r\nself-defense,--she simply discharges the duty imposed by God to defend\r\nus. The original right is in those who compose the body politic, and not\r\nin any individual. Hence, civil society does not impair our natural\r\nliberty, as actually existing in a state of nature, or as it might\r\ntherein exist; for, in such a state, there would be no real liberty, no\r\nreal enjoyment of natural rights.\r\n\r\nMr. Locke, as we have seen, defines the state of nature to be one of\r\n\"perfect freedom.\" Why, then, should we leave it? \"If man, in the state\r\nof nature, be so free,\" says he, \"why will he part with his freedom? To\r\nwhich it is obvious to answer,\" he continues, \"that though, in the state\r\nof nature, he hath such a right, _yet the enjoyment of it is very\r\nuncertain_, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others; for all\r\nbeing kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater part not\r\nstrict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he\r\nhas in this state is very unsafe, very insecure. This makes him willing\r\nto quit a condition which, _however free, is full of fears and continual\r\ndangers_; and it is not without reason that he seeks out, and is willing\r\nto join in society with, others who are already united, or have a mind\r\nto unite, _for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties, and\r\nestates_, which I call by the general name _property_.\"[140] What! can\r\nthat be a state of perfect freedom which is subject to fears and\r\nperpetual dangers? In one word, can a reign of terror be the reign of\r\nliberty? It is evident, we think, that Locke has been betrayed into no\r\nlittle inaccuracy and confusion of thought from not having distinguished\r\nbetween rights and liberty.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that, in a state of nature, we would possess\r\nrights, but we could not enjoy them. That is to say, notwithstanding all\r\nour rights, we should be destitute of freedom or liberty. Society\r\ninterposes the strong arm of the law to protect our rights, to secure\r\nus in the enjoyment of them. She delivers us from the alarms, the\r\ndangers, and the violence of the natural state. Hence, under God, she is\r\nthe mother of our peace and joy, by whose sovereign rule anarchy is\r\nabolished and liberty established. Liberty and social law can never be\r\ndissevered. Liberty, robed in law, and radiant with love, is one of the\r\nbest gifts of God to man. But liberty, despoiled of law, is a wild,\r\ndark, fierce spirit of licentiousness, which tends \"to uproar the\r\nuniversal peace.\"\r\n\r\nHence it is a frightful error to regard the civil state or government as\r\nantagonistic to the natural liberty of mankind; for this is, indeed, the\r\nauthor of the very liberty we enjoy. Good government it is that\r\nrestrains the elements of tyranny and oppression, and introduces liberty\r\ninto the world. Good government it is that shuts out the reign of\r\nanarchy, and secures the dominion of equity and goodness. He who would\r\nspurn the restraints of law, then, by which pride, and envy, and hatred,\r\nand malice, ambition, and revenge are kept within the sacred bounds of\r\neternal justice,--he, we say, is not the friend of human liberty. He\r\nwould open the flood-gates of tyranny and oppression; he would mar the\r\nharmony and extinguish the light of the world. Let no such man be\r\ntrusted.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing remarks be just, it would follow that the state of\r\nnature, as it is called, would be one of the most unnatural states in\r\nthe world. We may conceive it to exist, for the sake of illustration or\r\nargument; but if it should actually exist, it would be at war with the\r\nlaw of nature itself. For this requires, as we have seen, that men\r\nshould unite together, and frame such laws as the general good demands.\r\n\r\nNot only the law, but the very necessities of nature, enjoin the\r\ninstitution of civil government. God himself has thus laid the\r\nfoundations of civil society deep in the nature of man. It is an\r\nordinance of Heaven, which no human decree can reverse or annul. It is\r\nnot a thing of compacts, bound together by promises and paper, but is\r\nitself a law of nature as irreversible as any other. Compacts may give\r\nit one form or another, but in one form or another it must exist. It is\r\nno accidental or artificial thing, which may be made or unmade, which\r\nmay be set up or pulled down, at the mere will and pleasure of man. It\r\nis a decree of God; the spontaneous and irresistible working of that\r\nnature, which, in all climates, through all ages, and under all\r\ncircumstances, manifests itself in social organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VI. _Inherent and inalienable rights._\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about inherent and inalienable rights, which is\r\neither unintelligible or rests upon no solid foundation. \"The\r\ninalienable rights of men\" is a phrase often brandished by certain\r\nreformers, who aim to bring about \"the immediate abolition of slavery.\"\r\nYet, in the light of the foregoing discussion, it may be clearly shown\r\nthat the doctrine of inalienable rights, if properly handled, will not\r\ntouch the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nAn inalienable right is either one which the possessor of it himself\r\ncannot alienate or transfer, or it is one which society has not the\r\npower to take from him. According to the import of the terms, the first\r\nwould seem to be what is meant by an inalienable right; but in this\r\nsense it is not pretended that the right to either life or liberty has\r\nbeen transferred to society or alienated by the individual. And if, as\r\nwe have endeavored to show, the right, or power, or authority of society\r\nis not derived from a transfer of individual rights, then it is clear\r\nthat neither the right to life nor liberty is transferred to society.\r\nThat is, if no rights are transferred, than these particular rights are\r\nstill untransferred, and, if you please, untransferable. Be it conceded,\r\nthen, that the individual has never transferred his right to life or\r\nliberty to society.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in the above sense that the abolitionist uses the\r\nexpression, _inalienable rights_. According to his view, an inalienable\r\nright is one of which society itself cannot, without doing wrong,\r\ndeprive the individual, or deny the enjoyment of it to him. This is\r\nevidently his meaning; for he complains of the injustice of society, or\r\ncivil government, in depriving a certain portion of its subjects of\r\ncivil freedom, and consigning them to a state of servitude. \"Such an\r\nact,\" says he, \"is wrong, because it is a violation of the inalienable\r\nrights of all men.\" But let us see if his complaint be just or well\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nIt is pretended by no one that society has the right to deprive any\r\nsubject of either life or liberty, _without good and sufficient cause or\r\nreason_. On the contrary, it is on all hands agreed that it is only for\r\ngood and sufficient reasons that society can deprive any portion of its\r\nsubjects of either life or liberty. Nor can it be denied, on the other\r\nside, that a man may be deprived of either, or both, by a preordained\r\nlaw, in case there be a good and sufficient reason for the enactment of\r\nsuch law. For the crime of murder, the law of the land deprives the\r\ncriminal of life: _à fortiori_, might it deprive him of liberty. In the\r\ninfliction of such a penalty, the law seeks, as we have seen, not to\r\ndeal out so much pain for so much guilt, nor even to deal out pain for\r\nguilt at all, but simply to protect the members of society, and _secure\r\nthe general good_. The general good is the sole and sufficient\r\nconsideration which justifies the State in taking either the life or the\r\nliberty of its subjects.\r\n\r\nHence, if we would determine in any case whether society is justified in\r\ndepriving any of its members of civil freedom by law, we must first\r\nascertain whether the general good demands the enactment of such a law.\r\nIf it does, then such a law is just and good--as perfectly just and good\r\nas any other law which, for the same reason or on the same ground, takes\r\naway the life or liberty of its subjects. All this talk about the\r\ninalienable rights of men may have a very admirable meaning, if one will\r\nonly be at the pains to search it out; but is it not evident that, when\r\nsearched to the bottom, it has just nothing at all to do with the great\r\nquestion of slavery? But more of this hereafter.[141]\r\n\r\nThis great problem, as we have seen, is to be decided, not by an appeal\r\nto the inalienable rights of men, but simply and solely by a reference\r\nto the general good. It is to be decided, not by the aid of abstractions\r\nalone; a little good sense and _practical sagacity_ should be allowed to\r\nassist in its determination. There are inalienable rights, we\r\nadmit--inalienable both because the individual cannot transfer them, and\r\nbecause society can never rightfully deprive any man of their enjoyment.\r\nBut life and liberty are _not_ \"among these.\" There are inalienable\r\nrights, we admit, but then such abstractions are the edge-tools of\r\npolitical science, with which it is dangerous for either men or children\r\nto play. They may inflict deep wounds on the cause of humanity; they can\r\nthrow no light on the great problem of slavery.\r\n\r\nOne thing seems to be clear and fixed; and that is, that the rights of\r\nthe individual are subordinate to those of the community. _An\r\ninalienable right is a right coupled with a duty; a duty with which no\r\nother obligation can interfere._ But, as we have seen, it is the _duty_,\r\nand consequently, the _right_, of society to make such laws as the\r\ngeneral good demands. This inalienable right is conferred, and its\r\nexercise enjoined, by the Creator and Governor of the universe. All\r\nindividual rights are subordinate to this inherent, universal, and\r\ninalienable right. It should be observed, however, that in the exercise\r\nof this paramount right, this supreme authority, no society possesses\r\nthe power to contravene the principles of justice. In other words, it\r\nshould be observed that no unjust law can ever promote the public good.\r\nEvery law, then, which is not unjust, and which the public good demands,\r\nshould be enacted by society.\r\n\r\nBut we have already seen and shall still more fully see, that the law\r\nwhich ordains slavery is not unjust in itself, or, in other words, that\r\nit interferes with none of the inalienable rights of man. Hence, if it\r\nbe shown that the public good, and especially the good of the slave,\r\ndemands such a law, then the question of slavery will be settled. We\r\npurpose to show this before we have done with the present discussion.\r\nAnd if, in the prosecution of this inquiry, we should be so fortunate as\r\nto throw only one steady ray of light on the great question of slavery,\r\nby which the very depths of society have been so fearfully convulsed, we\r\nshall be more than rewarded for all the labor which, with no little\r\nsolicitude, we have felt constrained to bestow upon an attempt at its\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VII. _Conclusion of the first chapter._\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we shall merely add that if the foregoing remarks be\r\njust, it follows that the great problem of political philosophy is not\r\nprecisely such as it is often taken to be by statesmen and historians.\r\nThis problem, according to Mackintosh and Macaulay, consists in finding\r\nsuch an adjustment of the antagonistic principles of public order and\r\nprivate liberty, that neither shall overthrow or subvert the other, but\r\neach be confined within its own appropriate limits. Whereas, if we are\r\nnot mistaken, these are not _antagonistic_, but _co-ordinate_,\r\nprinciples. The very law which institutes public order is that which\r\nintroduces private liberty, since no secure enjoyment of one's rights\r\ncan exist where public order is not maintained. And, on the other hand,\r\nunless private liberty be introduced, public order cannot be\r\nmaintained, or at least such public order as should be established;\r\nfor, if there be not private liberty, if there be no secure enjoyment of\r\none's rights, then the highest and purest elements of our nature would\r\nhave to be extinguished, or else exist in perpetual conflict with the\r\nsurrounding despotism. As license is not liberty, so despotism is not\r\norder, nor even friendly to that enlightened, wholesome order, by which\r\nthe good of the public and the individual are at the same time\r\nintroduced and secured. In other words, what is taken from the one of\r\nthese principles is not given to the other; on the contrary, every\r\nadditional element of strength and beauty which is imparted to the one\r\nis an accession of strength and beauty to the other. Private liberty,\r\nindeed, lives and moves and has its very being in the bosom of public\r\norder. On the other hand, that public order alone which cherishes the\r\ntrue liberty of the individual is strong in the approbation of God and\r\nin the moral sentiments of mankind. All else is weakness, and death, and\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nThe true problem, then, is, not how the conflicting claims of these two\r\nprinciples may be adjusted, (for there is no conflict between them,) but\r\nhow a real public order, whose claims are identical with those of\r\nprivate liberty, may be introduced and maintained. The practical\r\nsolution of this problem, for the heterogeneous population of the South\r\nimperatively demands, as we shall endeavor to show, the institution of\r\nslavery; and that without such an institution it would be impossible to\r\nmaintain either a sound public order or a decent private liberty. We\r\nshall endeavor to show, that the very laws or institution which is\r\nsupposed by fanatical declaimers to shut out liberty from the Negro race\r\namong us, really shuts out the most frightful _license_ and disorder\r\nfrom society. In one word, we shall endeavor to show that in preaching\r\nup liberty _to and for_ the slaves of the South, the abolitionist is\r\n\"casting pearls before swine,\" that can neither comprehend the nature,\r\nnor enjoy the blessings, of the freedom which is so officiously thrust\r\nupon them. And if the Negro race should be moved by their fiery appeals,\r\nit would only be to rend and tear in pieces the fair fabric of American\r\nliberty, which, with all its shortcomings and defects, is by far the\r\nmost beautiful ever yet conceived or constructed by the genius of man.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] Locke on Civil Government, chap. ii.\r\n\r\n[137] Robert Hall.\r\n\r\n[138] Political Philosophy, chap. v.\r\n\r\n[139] Reflections on the Revolution in France.\r\n\r\n[140] Locke on Civil Government, chap. ix.\r\n\r\n[141] Chap. ii. § x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENTS AND POSITIONS OF ABOLITIONISTS.\r\n\r\n          The first fallacy of the Abolitionist.--The second\r\n          fallacy of the Abolitionist.--The third fallacy of\r\n          the Abolitionist.--The fourth fallacy of the\r\n          Abolitionist.--The fifth fallacy of the\r\n          Abolitionist.--The sixth fallacy of the\r\n          Abolitionist.--The seventh fallacy of the\r\n          Abolitionist.--The eighth fallacy of the\r\n          Abolitionist.--The ninth fallacy of the\r\n          Abolitionist.--The tenth, eleventh, twelfth,\r\n          thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth\r\n          fallacies of the Abolitionist; or his seven\r\n          arguments against the right of a man to hold\r\n          property in his fellow-man.--The seventeenth\r\n          fallacy of the Abolitionist; or, the Argument from\r\n          the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING in the preceding chapter discussed and defined the nature of\r\ncivil liberty, as well as laid down some of the political conditions on\r\nwhich its existence depends, we shall now proceed to examine the\r\nquestion of slavery. In the prosecution of this inquiry, we shall, in\r\nthe first place, consider the arguments and positions of the advocates\r\nof immediate abolition; and, in the second, point out the reasons and\r\ngrounds on which the institution of slavery is based and its justice\r\nvindicated. The first branch of the investigation, or that relating to\r\nthe arguments and positions of the abolitionist, will occupy the\r\nremainder of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is insisted by abolitionists that the institution of slavery is, in\r\nall cases and under all circumstances, morally wrong, or a violation of\r\nthe law of God. Such is precisely the ground assumed by the one side and\r\ndenied by the other.\r\n\r\nThus says Dr. Wayland: \"I have wished to make it clear that slavery, or\r\nthe holding of men in bondage, and 'obliging them to labor for our\r\nbenefit, without their contract or consent,' is always and everywhere,\r\nor, as you well express it, _semper et ubique_, a moral wrong, a\r\nviolation of the obligations under which we are created to our\r\nfellow-men, and a transgression of the law of our Creator.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Fuller likewise: \"The simple question is, Whether it _is\r\nnecessarily, and amid all circumstances, a crime to hold men in a\r\ncondition where they labor for another without their consent or\r\ncontract_? and in settling this matter all impertinences must be\r\nretrenched.\"\r\n\r\nIn one word, Dr. Wayland insists that slavery is condemned by the law of\r\nGod, by the moral law of the universe. We purpose to examine the\r\narguments which he has advanced in favor of this position. We select his\r\narguments for examination, because, as a writer on moral and political\r\nscience, he stands so high in the northern portion of the Union. His\r\nwork on these subjects has indeed long since passed the fiftieth\r\nthousand; a degree of success which, in his own estimation, authorizes\r\nhim to issue his letters on slavery over the signature of \"THE AUTHOR OF\r\nTHE MORAL SCIENCE.\" But the very fact that his popularity is so great,\r\nand that he is _the_ author of _the_ Moral Science, is a reason why his\r\narguments on a question of such magnitude should be subjected to a\r\nsevere analysis and searching scrutiny, in order that, under the\r\nsanction of so imposing a name, no error may be propagated and no\r\nmischief done.\r\n\r\nHence we shall hold Dr. Wayland amenable to all the laws of logic.\r\nEspecially shall we require him to adhere to the point he has undertaken\r\nto discuss, and to retrench all irrelevancies. If, after having\r\nsubjected his arguments to such a process, it shall be found that every\r\nposition which is assumed on the subject is directly contradicted by\r\nhimself, we shall not make haste to introduce anarchy into the Southern\r\nStates, in order to make it answer to the anarchy in his views of civil\r\nand political freedom. But whether this be the case or not, it is not\r\nfor us to determine; we shall simply proceed to examine, and permit the\r\nimpartial reader to decide for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ I. _The first fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists do not hold their passions in subjection to reason.\r\nThis is not merely the judgment of a Southern man: it is the opinion of\r\nthe more decent and respectable abolitionists themselves. Thus says Dr.\r\nChanning, censuring the conduct of the abolitionists: \"They have done\r\nwrong, I believe; nor is their wrong to be winked at because done\r\nfanatically or with good intentions; for how much mischief may be\r\nwrought with good designs! They have fallen into the common error of\r\nenthusiasts--that of exaggerating their object, of feeling as if no evil\r\nexisted but that which they opposed, and as if no guilt could be\r\ncompared with that of countenancing or upholding it.\"[142] In like\r\nmanner, Dr. Wayland says: \"I unite with you and the lamented Dr Channing\r\nin the opinion that the tone of the abolitionists at the North has been\r\nfrequently, I fear I must say generally, 'fierce, bitter, and abusive.'\r\nThe abolitionist press has, I believe, from the beginning, too commonly\r\nindulged in _exaggerated statement_, in violent denunciation, and in\r\ncoarse and lacerating invective. At our late Missionary Convention in\r\nPhiladelphia, I heard many things from men who claim to be the exclusive\r\nfriends of the slave, which pained me more than I can express. It seemed\r\nto me that the spirit which many of them manifested was very different\r\nfrom the spirit of Christ. I also cheerfully bear testimony to the\r\ngeneral courtesy, the Christian urbanity, and the calmness under\r\nprovocation which, in a remarkable degree, characterized the conduct of\r\nthe members from the South.\"\r\n\r\nIn the flood of sophisms which the abolitionists usually pour out in\r\ntheir explosions of passion, none is more common than what is\r\ntechnically termed by logicians the _ignoratio elenchi_, or a mistaking\r\nof the point in dispute. Nor is this fallacy peculiar to the more vulgar\r\nsort of abolitionists. It glares from the pages of Dr. Wayland, no less\r\nthan from the writings of the most fierce, bitter, and vindictive of his\r\nassociates in the cause of abolitionism. Thus, in one of his letters to\r\nDr. Fuller, he says: \"To present this subject in a simple light. Let us\r\nsuppose that your family and mine were neighbors. We, our wives and\r\nchildren, are all human beings in the sense that I have described, and,\r\nin consequence of that common nature, and by the will of our common\r\nCreator, are subject to the law, _Thou shalt love thy neighbor as\r\nthyself_. Suppose that I should set fire to your house, shoot you as you\r\ncame out of it, and seizing your wife and children, 'oblige them to\r\nlabor for my benefit without their contract or consent.' Suppose,\r\nmoreover, aware that I could not thus oblige them, unless they were\r\ninferior in intellect to myself, I should forbid them to read, and thus\r\nconsign them to intellectual and moral imbecility. Suppose I should\r\nmeasure out to them the knowledge of God on the same principle. Suppose\r\nI should exercise this dominion over them and their children as long as\r\nI lived, and then do all in my power to render it certain that my\r\nchildren should exercise it after me. _The question before us I suppose\r\nto be simply this: Would I, in so doing, act at variance with the\r\nrelations existing between us as creatures of God?_ Would I, in other\r\nwords, violate the supreme law of my Creator, Thou shalt love thy\r\nneighbor as thyself? or that other, Whatsoever ye would that men should\r\ndo unto you, do ye even so unto them? I do not see how any intelligent\r\ncreature can give more than one answer to this question. Then I think\r\nthat every intelligent creature must affirm that do this is wrong, or,\r\nin the other form of expression, that it is a great moral evil. Can we\r\nconceive of any greater?\"\r\n\r\nIt was surely very kind in Dr. Wayland to undertake, with so much pains,\r\nto instruct us poor, benighted sons of the South in regard to the\r\ndifference between right and wrong. We would fain give him full credit\r\nfor all the kindly feeling he so freely professes for his \"Southern\r\nbrethren;\" but if he really thinks that the question, whether arson, and\r\nmurder, and cruelty are offenses against the \"supreme law of the\r\nCreator,\" is still open for discussion among us, then we beg leave to\r\ninform him that he labors under a slight hallucination. If he had never\r\nwritten a word, we should have known, perhaps, that it is wrong for a\r\nman to set fire to his neighbor's house, and shoot him as he came out,\r\nand reduce his wife and children to a state of ignorance, degradation,\r\nand slavery. Nay, if we should find his house already burnt, and himself\r\nalready shot, we should hardly feel justified in treating his wife and\r\nchildren in so cruel a manner. Not even if they were \"guilty of a skin,\"\r\nor ever so degraded, should we deem ourselves justified in reducing them\r\nto a state of servitude. This is NOT \"the question before us.\" We are\r\nquite satisfied on all such points. The precept, too, Thou shalt love\r\nthy neighbor as thyself, was not altogether unknown in the Southern\r\nStates before his letters were written. A committee of very amiable\r\nphilanthropists came all the way from England, as the agents of some\r\nabolition society there, and told us all that the law of God requires us\r\nto love our neighbor as ourselves. In this benevolent work of\r\nenlightenment they were, if we mistake not, several months in advance of\r\nDr. Wayland. We no longer need to be enlightened on such points. Being\r\nsufficiently instructed, we admit that we should love our neighbor as\r\nourselves, and also that arson, murder, and so forth are violations of\r\nthis law. But we want to know whether, _semper et ubique_, the\r\ninstitution of slavery is morally wrong. _This is the question_, and to\r\nthis we intend to hold the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II. _The second fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\nLest we should be suspected of misrepresentation, we shall state the\r\nposition of Dr. Wayland in his own words. In regard to the institution\r\nof slavery, he says: \"I do not see that it does not sanction the whole\r\nsystem of the slave-trade. _If I have a right to a thing after I have\r\ngotten it, I have a natural right to the means necessary for getting\r\nit._ If this be so, I should be as much justified in sending a vessel to\r\nAfrica, murdering a part of the inhabitants of a village, and making\r\nslaves of the rest, as I should be in hunting a herd of wild animals,\r\nand either slaying them or subjecting them to the yoke.\"\r\n\r\nNow mark the principle on which this most wonderful argument is based:\r\n\"If I have a right to a thing after I have gotten it, I have a natural\r\nright to the means for getting it.\" That is to say, If I have the right\r\nto a slave, now that I have got him, then I may rightfully use all\r\nnecessary means to reduce other men to slavery! I may shoot, burn, or\r\nmurder, if by this means I can only get slaves! Was any consequence ever\r\nmore wildly drawn? Was any _non sequitur_ ever more glaring?\r\n\r\nLet us see how this argument would apply to other things. If I have a\r\nright to a watch after I have gotten it, no matter how, then I have a\r\nright to use the means necessary to get watches; I may steal them from\r\nmy neighbors! Or, if I have a right to a wife, provided I can get one,\r\nthen may I shoot my friend and marry his widow! Such is the argument of\r\none who seeks to enlighten the South and reform its institutions!\r\n\r\n\r\n§ III. _The third fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\nNearly allied to the foregoing argument is that of the same author, in\r\nwhich he deduces from the right of slavery, supposing it to exist,\r\nanother retinue of monstrous rights. \"This right also,\" says Dr.\r\nWayland, referring to the right to hold slaves, \"as I have shown,\r\ninvolves the right to use all the means necessary to its establishment\r\nand perpetuity, and, _of course, the right to crush his intellectual and\r\nsocial nature_, and to stupefy his conscience, in so far as may be\r\nnecessary to enable me to enjoy this right with the least possible\r\nperil.\" This is a compound fallacy, a many-sided error. But we will\r\nconsider only two phases of its absurdity.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if the slaveholder should reason in this way, no one\r\nwould be more ready than the author himself to condemn his logic. If any\r\nslaveholder should say, That because I have a right to my slaves,\r\ntherefore I have the right to crush the intellectual and moral nature of\r\nmen, in order to _establish_ and perpetuate their bondage,--he would be\r\namong the first to cry out against such reasoning. This is evident from\r\nthe fact that he everywhere commends those slaveholders who deem it\r\ntheir duty, as a return for the service of their slaves, to promote both\r\ntheir temporal and eternal good. He everywhere insists that such is the\r\nduty of slaveholders; and if such be their duty, they surely have no\r\nright to violate it, by crushing the intellectual and moral nature of\r\nthose whom they are bound to elevate in the scale of being. If the\r\nslaveholder, then, should adopt such an argument, his logic would be\r\nvery justly chargeable by Dr. Wayland with evidencing not so much the\r\nexistence of a clear head as of a bad heart.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the above argument overlooks the fact that the\r\nSouthern statesman vindicates the institution of slavery on the ground\r\nthat it finds the Negro race already so degraded as to unfit it for a\r\nstate of freedom. He does not argue that it is right to seize those who,\r\nby the possession of cultivated intellects and pure morals, are fit for\r\nfreedom, and debase them in order to prepare them for social bondage. He\r\ndoes not imagine that it is ever right to shoot, burn, or corrupt, in\r\norder to reduce any portion of the enlightened universe to a state of\r\nservitude. He merely insists that those only who are already unfit for a\r\nhigher and nobler state than one of slavery, should be held by society\r\nin such a state. This position, although it is so prominently set forth\r\nby every advocate of slavery at the South, is almost invariably\r\noverlooked by the Northern abolitionists. They talk, and reason, and\r\ndeclaim, indeed, just as if we had caught a bevy of black angels as they\r\nwere winging their way to some island of purity and bliss here upon\r\nearth, and reduced them from their heavenly state, by the most\r\ndiabolical cruelties and oppressions, to one of degradation, misery, and\r\nservitude. They forget that Africa is not yet a paradise, and that\r\nSouthern servitude is not quite a hell. They forget--in the heat and\r\nhaste of their argument they forget--that the institution of slavery is\r\ndesigned by the South not for the enlightened and the free, but only for\r\nthe ignorant and the debased. They need to be constantly reminded that\r\nthe institution of slavery is not the mother, but the daughter, of\r\nignorance and degradation. It is, indeed, the legitimate offspring of\r\nthat intellectual and moral debasement which, for so many thousand\r\nyears, has been accumulating and growing upon the African race. And if\r\nthe abolitionists at the North will only invent some method by which all\r\nthis frightful mass of degradation may be blotted out _at once_, then\r\nwill we most cheerfully consent to \"the _immediate_ abolition of\r\nslavery.\" On this point, however, we need not dwell, as we shall have\r\noccasion to recur to it again when we come to consider the grounds and\r\nreasons on which the institution of slavery is vindicated.\r\n\r\nHaving argued that the right of slavery, if it exist, implies the right\r\nto shoot and murder an enlightened neighbor, with a view to reduce his\r\nwife and children to a state of servitude, as well as to crush their\r\nintellectual and moral nature in order to keep them in such a state, the\r\nauthor adds, \"If I err in making these inferences, I _err innocently_.\"\r\nWe have no doubt of the most perfect and entire innocence of the author.\r\nBut we would remind him that innocence, however perfect or _childlike_,\r\nis not the only quality which a great reformer should possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ IV. _The fourth fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\nHe is often guilty of a _petitio principii_, in taking it for granted\r\nthat the institution of slavery is an injury to the slave, which is the\r\nvery point in dispute. Thus says Dr. Wayland: \"If it be asked when,\r\n[slavery must be abandoned,] I ask again, when shall a man begin to\r\ncease doing wrong? Is not the answer _immediately_? If a man is injuring\r\nus, do we doubt as to the _time when_ he ought to cease? There is, then,\r\nno doubt in respect to the time when we ought to cease inflicting injury\r\nupon others.\"[143] Here it is assumed that slavery is an _injury_ to the\r\nslave: but this is the very point which is denied, and which he should\r\nhave discussed. If a state of slavery be a greater injury to the slave\r\nthan a state of freedom would be, then are we willing to admit that it\r\nshould be abolished. But even in that case, not _immediately_, unless it\r\ncould be shown that the remedy would not be worse than the evil. If, on\r\nthe whole, the institution of slavery be a curse to the slave, we say\r\nlet it be abolished; not suddenly, however, as if by a whirlwind, but by\r\nthe counsels of wise, cautious, and far-seeing statesmen, who, capable\r\nof looking both before and after, can comprehend in their plans of\r\nreform all the diversified and highly-complicated interests of society.\r\n\r\n\"But it may be said,\" continues the author, \"immediate abolition would\r\nbe the greatest possible injury to the slaves themselves. They are not\r\ncompetent to self-government.\" True: this is the very thing which may\r\nbe, and which is, said by every Southern statesman in his advocacy of\r\nthe institution of slavery. Let us see the author's reply. \"This is a\r\nquestion of fact,\" says he, \"_which is not in the province of moral\r\nphilosophy to decide_. It very likely may be so. So far as I know, the\r\nfacts are not sufficiently known to warrant a full opinion on the\r\nsubject. We will, therefore, suppose it to be the case, and ask, What is\r\nthe duty of masters _under these circumstances_?\" In the discussion of\r\nthis question, the author comes to the conclusion that a master may hold\r\nhis slaves in bondage, provided his intentions be good, and with a view\r\nto set them at liberty as soon as they shall be qualified for such a\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nMoral philosophy, then, it seems, when it closes its eyes upon facts,\r\npronounces that slavery should be _immediately_ abolished; but if it\r\nconsider facts, which, instead of being denied, are admitted to be \"very\r\nlikely\" true, it decides against its immediate abolition! Or, rather,\r\nmoral philosophy looks at the fact that slavery is an _injury_, in order\r\nto see that it should be forthwith abolished; but closes its eyes upon\r\nthe fact that its abolition may be a still greater injury, lest this\r\nforegone conclusion should be called in question! Has moral philosophy,\r\nthen, an eye only for the facts which lie one side of the question it\r\nproposes to decide?\r\n\r\nSlavery is an _injury_, says Dr. Wayland, and therefore it should be\r\n_immediately_ abolished. But its abolition would be a still greater\r\ninjury, replies the objector. This may be true, says Dr. Wayland: it is\r\nhighly probable; but then this question of injury is one of fact, which\r\nit is not in the province of moral philosophy to decide! So much for the\r\nconsistency and even-handed justice of the author.\r\n\r\nThe position assumed by him, that questions of fact are not within the\r\nprovince of moral philosophy, is one of so great importance that it\r\ndeserves a separate and distinct notice. Though seldom openly avowed,\r\nyet is it so often tacitly assumed in the arguments and declamations of\r\nabolitionists, that it shall be more fully considered in the following\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ V. _The fifth fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that A has a right to use the body of B according to his--that\r\nis, A's--will. Now if this be true, it is true universally; and hence, A\r\nhas the control over the body of B, and B has control over the body of\r\nC, C of D, &c., and Z again over the body of A: that is, every separate\r\nwill has the right of control over some other body besides its own, and\r\nhas no right of control over its own body or intellect.\"[144] Now, if\r\nmen were cut out of pasteboard, all exactly alike, and distinguished\r\nfrom each other only by the letters of the alphabet, then the reasoning\r\nof the author would be excellent. But it happens that men are not cut\r\nout of pasteboard. They are distinguished by differences of character,\r\nby diverse habits and propensities, which render the reasonings of the\r\npolitical philosopher rather more difficult than if he had merely to\r\ndeal with or arrange the letters of the alphabet. In one, for example,\r\nthe intellectual and moral part is almost wholly eclipsed by the brute;\r\nwhile, in another, reason and religion have gained the ascendency, so as\r\nto maintain a steady empire over the whole man. The first, as the author\r\nhimself admits, is incompetent to self-government, and should,\r\ntherefore, be held by the law of society in a state of servitude. But\r\ndoes it follow that \"if this be true, it is true _universally_?\" Because\r\none man who can not govern himself may be governed by another, does it\r\nfollow that every man should be governed by others? Does it follow that\r\nthe one who has acquired and maintained the most perfect\r\nself-government, should be subjected to the control of him who is wholly\r\nincompetent to control himself? Yes, certainly, if the reasoning of Dr.\r\nWayland be true; but, according to every sound principle of political\r\nethics, the answer is, emphatically, No!\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between a Hottentot and a Newton. The first should\r\nno more be condemned to astronomical calculations and discoveries, than\r\nthe last should be required to follow a plough. Such differences,\r\nhowever, are overlooked by much of the reasoning of the abolitionist. In\r\nregard to the question of fact, whether a man is really a man and not a\r\nmere thing, he is profoundly versed. He can discourse most eloquently\r\nupon this subject: he can prove, by most irrefragable arguments, that a\r\nHottentot is a man as well as a Newton. But as to the differences among\r\nmen, such nice distinctions are beneath his philosophy! It is true that\r\none may be sunk so low in the scale of being that civil freedom would be\r\na curse to him; yet, whether this be so or not, is a question of fact\r\nwhich his philosophy does not stoop to decide. He merely wishes to know\r\nwhat rights A can possibly have, either by the law of God or man, which\r\ndo not equally belong to B? And if A would feel it an injury to be\r\nplaced under the control of B, then, \"there is no doubt\" that it is\r\nequally wrong to place B under the control of A? In plain English, if it\r\nwould be injurious and wrong to subject a Newton to the will of a\r\nHottentot, then it would be equally injurious and wrong to subject a\r\nHottentot to the will of a Newton! Such is the inevitable consequence of\r\nhis very profound political principles! Nay, such is the identical\r\nconsequence which he draws from his own principles!\r\n\r\nIf questions of fact are not within the province of the moral\r\nphilosopher, then the moral philosopher has no business with the science\r\nof political ethics. This is not a pure, it is a mixed science. Facts\r\ncan no more be overlooked by the political architect, than magnitude can\r\nbe disregarded by the mathematician. The man, the political dreamer, who\r\npays no attention to them, may be fit, for aught we know, to frame a\r\ngovernment out of moonshine for the inhabitants of Utopia; but, if we\r\nmight choose our own teachers in political wisdom, we should decidedly\r\nprefer those who have an eye for facts as well as abstractions. If we\r\nmay borrow a figure from Mr. Macaulay, the legislator who sees no\r\ndifference among men, but proposes the same kind of government for all,\r\nacts about as wisely as a tailor who should measure the Apollo Belvidere\r\nto cut clothes for all his customers--for the pigmies as well as for the\r\ngiants.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VI. _The sixth fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by Dr. Wayland that the institution of slavery is\r\ncondemned as \"a violation of the plainest dictates of natural justice,\"\r\nby \"the natural conscience of man, from at least as far back as the time\r\nof Aristotle.\" If any one should infer that Aristotle himself condemned\r\nthe institution of slavery, he would be grossly deceived; for it is\r\nknown to every one who has read the Politics of Aristotle that he is,\r\nunder certain circumstances, a strenuous advocate of the natural\r\njustice, as well as of the political wisdom, of slavery. Hence we shall\r\nsuppose that Dr. Wayland does not mean to include Aristotle in his broad\r\nassertion, but only those who came after him. Even in this sense, or to\r\nthis extent, his positive assertion is so diametrically opposed to the\r\nplainest facts of history, that it is difficult to conceive how he could\r\nhave persuaded himself of its truth. It is certain that, on other\r\noccasions, he was perfectly aware of the fact that the natural\r\nconscience of man, from the time of Aristotle down to that of the\r\nChristian era, was in favor of the institution of slavery; for as often\r\nas it has served his purpose to assert this fact, he has not hesitated\r\nto do so. Thus, \"the universal existence of slavery at the time of\r\nChrist,\" says he, \"took its origin from the moral darkness of the age.\r\nThe immortality of the soul was unknown. Out of the Hebrew nation not a\r\nman on earth had any true conception of the character of the Deity or of\r\nour relations and obligations to him. The law of universal love to man\r\nhad never been heard of.\"[145] No wonder he here argues that _slavery\r\nreceived the universal sanction of the heathen world_, since so great\r\nwas the moral darkness in which they were involved. This darkness was so\r\ngreat, if we may believe the author, that the men of one nation esteemed\r\nthose of another \"as by nature foes, whom they had a right\" not only \"to\r\nsubdue or enslave,\" but also to murder \"whenever and in what manner\r\nsoever they were able.\"[146] The sweeping assertion, that such was the\r\nmoral darkness of the heathen world, is wide of the truth; for, at the\r\ntime of Christ, no civilized nation \"esteemed it right to murder or\r\nenslave, whenever and in what manner soever they were able,\" the people\r\nof other nations. There were some ideas of natural justice, even then,\r\namong men; and if there were not, why does Dr. Wayland appeal to their\r\nideas of natural justice as one argument against slavery? If the heathen\r\nworld \"esteemed it right\" to make slaves, how can it be said that its\r\nconscience condemned slavery? Is it not evident that Dr. Wayland is\r\ncapable of asserting either the one thing or its opposite, just as it\r\nmay happen to serve the purpose of his anti-slavery argument? Whether\r\nfacts lie within the province of moral philosophy or not, it is certain,\r\nwe think, that the moral philosopher who may be pleased to set facts at\r\nnaught has no right to substitute fictions in their stead.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VII. _The seventh fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,\" is the rule of action which,\r\nin the estimation of abolitionists, should at once and forever decide\r\nevery good man against the institution of slavery. But when we consider\r\nthe stupendous interests involved in the question, and especially those\r\nof an intellectual and moral nature, we dare not permit ourselves to be\r\ncarried away by any form of mere words. We _must_ pause and investigate.\r\nThe fact that the dexterous brandishing of the beautiful precept in\r\nquestion has made, and will no doubt continue to make, its thousands of\r\nconverts or victims, is a reason why its real import should be the more\r\nclosely examined and the more clearly defined. The havoc it makes among\r\nthose whose philanthropy is stronger than their judgment--or, if you\r\nplease, whose judgment is weaker than their philanthropy--flows not from\r\nthe divine precept itself, but only from human interpretations thereof.\r\nAnd it should ever be borne in mind that he is the real enemy of the\r\ngreat cause of philanthropy who, by absurd or overstrained applications\r\nof this sublime precept, lessens that profound respect to which it is so\r\njustly entitled from every portion of the rational universe.\r\n\r\nIt is repeatedly affirmed by Dr. Wayland that every slaveholder lives in\r\nthe habitual and open violation of the precept which requires us to love\r\nour neighbor as ourselves. \"The moral precepts of the Bible,\" says he,\r\n\"are diametrically opposed to slavery. These are, 'Thou shalt love thy\r\nneighbor as thyself,' and 'All things whatsoever ye would that men\r\nshould do unto you, do ye even so unto them.' Now, were this precept\r\nobeyed,\" he continues, \"it is manifest that slavery could not in fact\r\nexist for a single instant. The principle of the precept is absolutely\r\nsubversive of the principle of slavery.\" If strong assertion were\r\nargument, we should no doubt be overwhelmed by the irresistible logic of\r\nDr. Wayland. But the assertion of no man can be accepted as sound\r\nargument. We want to know the very meaning of the words of the great\r\nTeacher, and to be guided by _that_, rather than by the fallible\r\nauthority of an earthly oracle. What, then, is the meaning, the real\r\nmeaning, of his inspired words?\r\n\r\nDo they mean that whatsoever we might, in any relation of life, desire\r\nfor ourselves, we should be willing to grant to others in the like\r\nrelation or condition? This interpretation, we are aware, has been put\r\nupon the words by a very celebrated divine. If we may believe that\r\ndivine, we cannot do as we would be done by, unless, when we desire the\r\nestate of another, we forthwith transfer our estate to him! If a poor\r\nman, for example, should happen to covet the estate of his rich\r\nneighbor, then he is bound by this golden rule of benevolence to give\r\nhis little all to him, without regard to the necessities or wants of his\r\nown family! But this interpretation, though seriously propounded by a\r\nman of undoubted genius and piety, has not, so far as we know, made the\r\nslightest possible impression on the plain good sense of mankind. Even\r\namong his most enthusiastic admirers, it has merely excited a\r\ngood-natured smile at what they could not but regard as the strange\r\nhallucination of a benevolent heart.\r\n\r\n_A wrong desire in one relation of life is not a reason for a wrong act\r\nin another relation thereof._ A man may desire the estate, he may desire\r\nthe man-servant, or the maid-servant, or the wife of his neighbor, but\r\nthis is no reason why he should abandon his own man-servant, or his\r\nmaid-servant, or his wife to the will of another. The criminal who\r\ntrembles at the bar of justice may desire both judge and jury to acquit\r\nhim, but this is no reason why, if acting in the capacity of either\r\njudge or juror, he should bring in a verdict of acquittal in favor of\r\none justly accused of crime. If we would apply the rule in question\r\naright, we should consider, not what we might wish or desire if placed\r\nin the situation of another, but what we _ought_ to wish or desire.\r\n\r\nIf a man were a child, he might wish to be exempt from the wholesome\r\nrestraint of his parents; but this, as every one will admit, is no\r\nreason why he should abandon his own children to themselves. In like\r\nmanner, if he were a slave, he might most vehemently desire freedom; but\r\nthis is no reason why he should set his slaves at liberty. The whole\r\nquestion of right turns upon what he _ought_ to wish or desire if placed\r\nin such a condition. If he were an intelligent, cultivated, civilized\r\nman,--in one word, if he were fit for freedom,--then his desire for\r\nliberty would be a rational desire, would be such a feeling as he\r\n_ought_ to cherish; and hence, he should be willing to extend the same\r\nblessing to all other intelligent, cultivated, civilized men, to all\r\nsuch as are prepared for its enjoyment. Such is the sentiment which he\r\nshould entertain, and such is precisely the sentiment entertained at the\r\nSouth. No one here proposes to reduce any one to slavery, much less\r\nthose who are qualified for freedom; and hence the inquiry so often\r\npropounded by Dr. Wayland and other abolitionists, how we would like to\r\nbe subjected to bondage, is a grand impertinence. We should like it as\r\nlittle as themselves; and in this respect we shall do as we would be\r\ndone by.\r\n\r\nBut suppose we were veritable slaves--slaves in character and in\r\ndisposition as well as in fact--and as unfit for freedom as the Africans\r\nof the South--what _ought_ we then to wish or desire? Ought we to desire\r\nfreedom? We answer, no; because on that supposition freedom would be a\r\ncurse and not a blessing. Dr. Wayland himself admits that \"it is very\r\nlikely\" freedom would be \"the greatest possible injury\" to the slaves of\r\nthe South. Hence, we cannot perceive that if we were such as they, we\r\nought to desire so great an evil to ourselves. It would indeed be to\r\ndesire \"the greatest possible injury\" to ourselves; and though, as\r\nignorant and blind slaves, we might cherish so foolish a desire,\r\nespecially if instigated by abolitionists, yet this is no reason why, as\r\nenlightened citizens, we should be willing to inflict the same great\r\nevil upon others. _A foolish desire, we repeat, in one relation of life,\r\nis not a good reason for a foolish or injurious act in another relation\r\nthereof._\r\n\r\nThe precept which requires us to do as we would be done by, was intended\r\nto enlighten the conscience. It is used by abolitionists to hoodwink and\r\ndeceive the conscience. This precept directs us to conceive ourselves\r\nplaced in the condition of others, in order that we may the more clearly\r\nperceive what is due to them. The abolitionist employs it to convince us\r\nthat, because we desire liberty for ourselves, we should extend it to\r\nall men, even to those who are not qualified for its enjoyment, and to\r\nwhom it would prove \"the greatest possible injury.\" He employs it not\r\nto show us what is due to others, but to persuade us to injure them! He\r\nmay deceive himself; but so long as we believe what even he admits as\r\nhighly probable--namely, that the \"abolition of slavery would be the\r\ngreatest possible injury to the slaves themselves\"--we shall never use\r\nthe divine precept as an instrument of delusion and of wrong. What!\r\ninflict the greatest injury on our neighbor, and that, too, out of pure\r\nChristian charity?\r\n\r\nBut we need not argue with the abolitionist upon his own admissions. We\r\nhave infinitely stronger ground to stand on. The precept, \"Thou shalt\r\nlove thy neighbor as thyself,\" is to be found in the Old Testament as\r\nwell as in the New. Thus, in the nineteenth chapter of Leviticus, it is\r\nsaid, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;\" and no greater love\r\nthan this is any where inculcated in the New Testament. Yet in the\r\ntwenty-fifth chapter of the same book, it is written, \"Of the children\r\nof the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of\r\ntheir families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and\r\nthey shall be your possession. And ye shall take them as an inheritance\r\nfor your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they\r\nshall be your bondmen forever.\" This language is too plain for\r\ncontroversy. In regard to this very passage, in which the Hebrews are\r\ncommanded to enter upon and take possession of the land of the\r\nCanaanites, Dr. Wayland himself is constrained to admit--\"The authority\r\nto take them as slaves seems to be a part of this original, peculiar,\r\nand I may perhaps say, anomalous grant.\"[147] Now, if the principle of\r\nslavery, and the principle of the precept, Thou shalt love thy neighbor\r\nas thyself, be as Dr. Wayland boldly asserts, _always and everywhere_ at\r\nwar with each other, how has it happened that both principles are so\r\nclearly and so unequivocally embodied in one and the same code by the\r\nSupreme Ruler of the world? Has this discrepancy escaped the eye of\r\nOmniscience, and remained in the code of laws from heaven, to be\r\ndetected and exposed by \"the author of the Moral Science\"?\r\n\r\nWe do not mean that Dr. Wayland sees any discrepancy among the\r\nprinciples of the divine legislation. It is true he sees there the\r\nprecept, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,\" and also this\r\ninjunction, \"Thou shalt buy them for a possession,\" and \"They shall be\r\nyour bondmen forever;\" but although this looks very \"anomalous\" to him,\r\nhe dare not pronounce it absurd or self-contradictory. It is true, he\r\ndeclares, that slavery is condemned _always and everywhere_ by \"the\r\nplainest dictates of natural justice;\" but yet, although, according to\r\nhis own admission,[148] it was instituted by Heaven, he has found out a\r\nmethod to save the character of the Almighty from the disgrace of such a\r\nlaw. He says, \"I know the word '_shalt_' is used when speaking of this\r\nsubject, but it is clearly used as _prophetic_, and not as _mandatory_.\"\r\nAy, the words \"thou shalt\" are used in regard to the buying and holding\r\nof slaves, just as they are used in the commands which precede and\r\nfollow this injunction. There is no change in the form of the\r\nexpression. There is not, in any way, the slightest intimation that the\r\nLawgiver is about to prophesy; all seems to be a series of commands, and\r\nis clothed in the same language of authority--\"_thou shalt_.\" Yet in one\r\nparticular instance, and in one instance only, this language seems\r\n\"clearly\" _prophetic_ to Dr. Wayland, and not _mandatory_. Now, I submit\r\nto the candid and impartial reader, if this be not egregious trifling\r\nwith the word of God.\r\n\r\nDr. Wayland forgets that he had himself admitted that the very passage\r\nin question clothed the Hebrews with \"the authority to take\r\nslaves.\"[149] He now, in the face of his own admission, declares that\r\nthis language \"is clearly prophetic,\" and tells what _would_ or what\r\n_might_ be, and not what _should_ or what _must_ be.\" The poor Hebrews,\r\nhowever, when they took slaves by the authority of a \"_thou shalt_\" from\r\nthe Lord, never imagined that they were merely fulfilling a prophecy,\r\nand committing an abominable sin.\r\n\r\nThis is clear to Dr. Wayland, if we may trust the last expression of his\r\nopinion. But it is to be regretted, that either the clearness of his\r\nperceptions, or the confidence of his assertions, is so often\r\ndisproportioned to the evidence before him. Thus, he says with the most\r\nadmirable modesty, \"It _seems to me_ that the soul is the most important\r\npart of a human being;\"[150] and yet he peremptorily and positively\r\ndeclares that the very strongest language of authority ever found in\r\nScripture \"is _clearly_ used as prophetic and not mandatory!\" He may,\r\nhowever, well reserve the tone of dogmatic authority for such\r\npropositions, since, if they may not be carried by assertion, they must\r\nbe left wholly without the least shadow of support. But one would\r\nsuppose that strength of assertion in such cases required for its\r\nunembarrassed utterance no little strength of countenance.\r\n\r\n\"If any one doubts,\" says Dr. Wayland, \"respecting the bearing of the\r\nScripture precept upon this case, a few plain questions may throw\r\nadditional light upon the subject.\"[151] Now, if we mistake not, the few\r\nplain questions which he deems so unanswerable may be answered with the\r\nmost perfect ease. \"Would the master be willing,\" he asks, \"that another\r\nperson should subject him to slavery, for the same reasons and on the\r\nsame grounds that he holds his slave in bondage?\" We answer, No. If any\r\nman should undertake to subject Southern masters to slavery, on the\r\nground that they are intellectually and morally sunk so low as to be\r\nunfit for freedom or self-control, we should certainly not like the\r\ncompliment. It may argue a very great degree of self-complacency in us,\r\nbut yet the plain fact is, that we really do believe ourselves competent\r\nto govern ourselves, and to manage our affairs, without the aid of\r\nmasters. And as we are not willing to be made slaves of, especially on\r\nany such humiliating grounds, so we are not willing to see any other\r\nnation or race of men, whom we may deem qualified for the glorious\r\ncondition of freedom, subjected to servitude.\r\n\r\n\"Would the gospel allow us,\" he also asks, \"if it were in our power, to\r\nreduce our fellow-citizens of our own color to slavery?\" Certainly not.\r\nNor do we propose to reduce any one, either white or black, to a state\r\nof slavery. It is amazing to see with what an air of confidence such\r\nquestions are propounded. Dr. Channing, no less than Dr. Wayland, seems\r\nto think they must carry home irresistible conviction to the heart and\r\nconscience of every man who is not irremediably blinded by the\r\ndetestable institution of slavery. \"Now, let every reader,\" says he,\r\n\"ask himself this plain question: Could I, can I, be rightfully seized\r\nand made an article of property?\" And we, too, say, Let every reader ask\r\nhimself this plain question, and then, if he please, answer it in the\r\nnegative. But what, then, should follow? Why, if you please, he should\r\nrefuse to seize any other man or to make him an article of property. He\r\nshould be opposed to the crime of kidnapping. But if, from such an\r\nanswer, he should conclude that the institution of slavery is\r\n\"everywhere and always wrong,\" then surely, after what has been said,\r\nnot another word is needed to expose the ineffable weakness and futility\r\nof the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis golden rule, this divine precept, requires us to conceive ourselves\r\nplaced in the condition of our slaves, and then to ask ourselves, How\r\nshould we be treated by the master? in order to obtain a clear and\r\nimpartial view of our duty to them. This it requires of us; and this we\r\ncan most cheerfully perform. We can conceive that we are poor, helpless,\r\ndependent beings, possessing the passions of men and the intellects of\r\nchildren. We can conceive that we are by nature idle, improvident, and,\r\nwithout a protector and friend to guide and control us, utterly unable\r\nto take care of ourselves. And, having conceived all this, if we ask\r\nourselves, How should we be treated by the masters whom the law has\r\nplaced over us, what is the response? Is it that they should turn us\r\nloose to shift for ourselves? Is it that they should abandon us to\r\nourselves, only to fall a prey to indolence, and to the legion of vices\r\nand crimes which ever follow in its train? Is it that they should set us\r\nfree, and expose us, without protection, to the merciless impositions of\r\nthe worst portions of a stronger and more sagacious race? Is it, in one\r\nword, that we should be free from the dominion of men, who, as a general\r\nthing, are humane and wise in their management of us, only to become the\r\nvictims--the most debased and helpless victims--of every evil way? We\r\nanswer, No! Even the spirit of abolitionism itself has, in the person of\r\nDr. Wayland, declared that such treatment would, in all probability, be\r\nthe greatest of calamities. We feel sure it would be an infinite and\r\nremediless curse. And as we believe that, if we were in the condition of\r\nslaves, such treatment would be so great and so withering a curse, so we\r\ncannot, out of a feeling of love, proceed to inflict this curse upon our\r\nslaves. On the contrary, _we would do as we so clearly see we ought to\r\nbe done by_, if our conditions were changed.\r\n\r\nIs it not amazing, as well as melancholy, that learned divines, who\r\nundertake to instruct the benighted South in the great principles of\r\nduty, should entertain such superficial and erroneous views of the\r\nfirst, great, and all-comprehending precept of the gospel? If their\r\ninterpretation of this precept were correct, then the child might be set\r\nfree from the authority of the father, and the criminal from the\r\nsentence of the judge. All justice would be extinguished, all order\r\noverthrown, and boundless confusion introduced into the affairs of men.\r\nYet, with unspeakable self-complacency, they come with such miserable\r\ninterpretations of the plainest truths to instruct those whom they\r\nconceive to be blinded by custom and the institution of slavery to the\r\nclearest light of heaven. They tell us, \"Thou shouldst love thy neighbor\r\nas thyself;\" and they reiterate these words in our ears, just as if we\r\nhad never heard them before. If this is all they have to say, why then\r\nwe would remind them that the _meaning_ of the precept is the precept.\r\nIt is not a mere _sound_, it is _sense_, which these glorious words are\r\nintended to convey. And if they can only repeat the words for us, why\r\nthen they might just as well send a host of free negroes with good,\r\nstrong lungs to be our instructors in moral science.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VIII. _The eighth fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\nAn argument is drawn from the divine attributes against the institution\r\nof slavery. One would suppose that a declaration from God himself is\r\nsome little evidence as to what is agreeable to his attributes; but it\r\nseems that moral philosophers have, now-a-days, found out a better\r\nmethod of arriving at what is implied by his perfections. Dr. Wayland is\r\none of those who, setting aside the word of God, appeal to his\r\nattributes in favor of the immediate and universal abolition of slavery.\r\nIf slavery were abolished, says he, \"the laborer would then work in\r\nconformity with the conditions which God has appointed, whereas he now\r\nworks at variance with them; in the one case, we should be attempting to\r\naccumulate property under the blessing of God, whereas now we are\r\nattempting to do it under _his special and peculiar malediction_. How\r\ncan we expect to prosper, when there is not, as Mr. Jefferson remarks,\r\n'an attribute of the Almighty that can be appealed to in our\r\nfavor'?\"[152] If we may rely upon his own words, rather than upon the\r\nconfident assertions of Dr. Wayland, we need not fear the curse of God\r\nupon the slaveholder. The readiness with which Dr. Wayland points the\r\nthunders of the divine wrath at our heads, is better evidence of the\r\npassions of his own heart than of the perfections of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nAgain he says: \"If Jefferson trembled for his country when he remembered\r\nthat God is just, and declared that, 'in case of insurrection, the\r\nAlmighty has no attribute that can take part with us in the contest,'\r\nsurely it becomes a _disciple of Jesus Christ_ to pause and reflect.\"\r\nNow let it be borne in mind that all this proceeds from a man, from a\r\nprofessed disciple of Jesus Christ, who, in various places, has truly,\r\nas well as emphatically, said, \"_The duty of slaves_ is also explicitly\r\nmade known in the Bible. They are bound to _obedience_, _fidelity_,\r\n_submission_, and respect to their masters,\"[153] etc., etc.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, according to Dr. Wayland himself, is the clear and\r\nunequivocal teaching of revelation. And such being the case, shall the\r\n_real_ \"disciple of Jesus Christ\" be made to believe, on the authority\r\nof Mr. Jefferson or of any other man, that the Almighty has no attribute\r\nwhich could induce him to take sides with his own law? If, instead of\r\nsubmission to that law, there should be rebellion,--and not only\r\nrebellion, but bloodshed and murder,--shall we believe that the\r\nAlmighty, the supreme Ruler of heaven and earth, would look on well\r\npleased? Since such is the express declaration of God himself respecting\r\nthe duty of slaves, it surely becomes a disciple of Christ to pause and\r\nreflect whether he will follow his voice or the voice of man.\r\n\r\nWe owe at least one benefit to the Northern abolitionists. Ere the\r\nsubject of slavery was agitated by them, there were many loose, floating\r\nnotions among us, as well as among themselves, respecting the nature of\r\nliberty, which were at variance with the institution of slavery. But\r\nsince this agitation began, we have looked more narrowly into the\r\ngrounds of slavery, as well as into the character of the arguments by\r\nwhich it is assailed, and we have found the first as solid as adamant,\r\nthe last as unsubstantial as moonshine. If Mr. Jefferson had lived till\r\nthe present day, there can be no doubt, we think, that he would have\r\nbeen on the same side of this great question with the Calhouns, the\r\nClays, and the Websters of the country. We have known many who, at one\r\ntime, fully concurred with Mr. Jefferson on this subject, but are now\r\nfirm believers in the perfect justice and humanity of negro slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ IX. _The ninth fallacy of the abolitionist._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the abolitionist argues the question of\r\nslavery as if Southerners were proposing to catch freemen and reduce\r\nthem to bondage. He habitually overlooks the fact, that slavery results,\r\nnot from the action of the individual, but from an ordinance of the\r\nState. He forgets that it is a civil institution, and proceeds to argue\r\nas if it were founded in individual wrong. And even when he rises--as he\r\nsometimes does--to a contemplation of the real question in dispute, he\r\ngenerally takes a most narrow and one-sided view of the subject. For he\r\ngenerally takes it for granted that the legislation which ordains the\r\ninstitution of slavery is _intended_ solely and exclusively for the\r\nbenefit of the master, without the least regard to the interests of the\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nThus says Dr. Wayland: \"Domestic slavery proceeds upon the principle\r\nthat the master has a right to control the actions--physical and\r\nintellectual--of the slave for his own (that is, the master's)\r\nindividual benefit,\"[154] etc. And again: \"It supposes that the Creator\r\nintended one human being to govern the physical, intellectual, and moral\r\nactions of as many other human beings as, by purchase, he can bring\r\nwithin his physical power; and that _one human being may thus acquire a\r\nright to sacrifice the happiness of any number of other human beings,\r\nfor the purpose of promoting his own_.\"[155] Now, surely, if this\r\nrepresentation be just, then the institution of slavery should be held\r\nin infinite abhorrence by every man in Christendom.\r\n\r\nBut we can assure Dr. Wayland that, however ignorant or heathenish he\r\nmay be pleased to consider the people of the Southern States, we are not\r\nso utterly lost to all reverence for the Creator as to suppose, even for\r\na moment, that he _intended any one human being to possess the right of\r\nsacrificing the happiness of his fellow-men to his own_. We can assure\r\nhim that we are not quite so dead to every sentiment of political\r\njustice, as to imagine that any legislation which intends to benefit the\r\none at the expense of the many is otherwise than unequal and iniquitous\r\nin the extreme. There is some little sense of justice left among us yet;\r\nand hence we approve of no institution or law which proceeds on the\r\nmonstrous principle that any one man has, or can have, the \"_right to\r\nsacrifice the happiness of any number of other human beings for the\r\npurpose of promoting his own_.\" We recognize no such right. It is as\r\nvehemently abhorred and condemned by us as it can be abhorred and\r\ncondemned by the author himself.\r\n\r\nIn thus taking it for granted, as Dr. Wayland so coolly does, that the\r\ninstitution in question is \"intended\" to sacrifice the happiness of the\r\nslaves to the selfish interest of the master, he incontinently begs the\r\nwhole question. Let him establish this point, and the whole controversy\r\nwill be at an end. But let him not hope to establish any thing, or to\r\nsatisfy any one, by assuming the very point in dispute, and then proceed\r\nto demolish what every man at the South condemns no less than himself.\r\nSurely, no one who has looked at both sides of this great question can\r\nbe ignorant that the legislation of the South proceeds on the principle\r\nthat slavery is beneficial, not to the master only, but also and\r\n_especially_ to the slave. Surely, no one who has either an eye or an\r\near for facts can be ignorant that the institution of slavery is based\r\non the ground, or principle, that it is beneficial, not only to the\r\nparts, but also to the whole, of the society in which it exists. This\r\nground, or principle, is set forth in every defense of slavery by the\r\nwriters and speakers of the South; it is so clearly and so unequivocally\r\nset forth, that he who runs may read. Why, then, is it overlooked by Dr.\r\nWayland? Why is he pleased to imagine that he is combating Southern\r\nprinciples, when, in reality, he is merely combating the monstrous\r\nfigment, the distorted conception of his own brain,--namely, the right\r\nof one man to sacrifice the happiness of multitudes to his own will and\r\npleasure? Is it because facts do not lie within the province of the\r\nmoral philosopher? Is it because fiction alone is worthy of his\r\nattention? Or is it because a blind, partisan zeal has so far taken\r\npossession of his very understanding, that he finds it impossible to\r\nspeak of the institution of slavery, except in the language of the\r\ngrossest misrepresentation?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ X. _The tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth,\r\nand sixteenth fallacies of the abolitionist; or his seven arguments\r\nagainst the right of a man to hold property in his fellow-man._\r\n\r\n\"This claim of property in a human being,\" says Dr. Channing, \"is\r\naltogether false, groundless. No such right of man in man can exist. A\r\nhuman being cannot be justly owned.\" The only difficulty in maintaining\r\nthis position is, according to Dr. Channing, \"on account of its\r\nexceeding obviousness. It is too plain for proof. To defend it is like\r\ntrying to confirm a self-evident truth,\" etc., etc. Yet he advances no\r\nless than seven \"arguments,\" as he calls them, in order to establish\r\nthis self-evident position. We shall examine these seven arguments, and\r\nsee if his great confidence be not built on a mere abuse of words.\r\n\r\n\"The consciousness of our humanity,\" says he, \"involves the persuasion\r\nthat we cannot be owned as a tree or a brute.\" This, as every body\r\nknows, is one of the hackneyed commonplaces of the abolitionist. He\r\nnever ceases to declaim about the injustice of slavery, because it\r\nregards, as he is pleased to assert, a man as a mere thing or a brute.\r\nNow, once for all, we freely admit that it were monstrously unjust to\r\nregard or treat a man otherwise than as a man. We freely admit that a\r\nhuman being \"can not be owned as a tree or a brute.\"\r\n\r\nA tree may be _absolutely_ owned. That is to say, the owner of a tree\r\nmay do what he pleases with his own, provided he do no harm or injury\r\nwith it. He may cut it down; and, if he please, he may beat it as long\r\nas he has the power to raise an arm. He may work it into a house or into\r\na piece of furniture, or he may lay it on the fire, and reduce it to\r\nashes. He may, we repeat, do just exactly what he pleases with his own,\r\nif his own be such a thing as a tree, _for a tree has no rights_.\r\n\r\nIt is far otherwise with a brute. The owner of a horse, for example, may\r\nnot do what he pleases with his own. Here his property is not\r\n_absolute_; it is _limited_. He may not beat his horse without mercy,\r\n\"for a good man is merciful to his beast.\" He may not cut his horse to\r\npieces, or burn him on the fire. For the horse has rights, which the\r\nowner himself is bound to respect. The horse has a right to food and\r\nkind treatment, and the owner who refuses these is a tyrant. Nay, the\r\nvery worm that crawls beneath our feet has his rights as well as the\r\nmonarch on his throne; and just in so far as these rights are\r\ndisregarded by a man is that man a tyrant.\r\n\r\nHence even the brute may not be regarded or treated as a mere thing or a\r\ntree. He can be owned and treated no otherwise than as a brute. The\r\nhorse, for example, may not be left, like a tree, without food and care;\r\nbut he may be saddled and rode as a horse; or he may be hitched to the\r\nplough, and compelled to do his master's work.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, a man cannot be owned or treated as a horse. He cannot\r\nbe saddled or rode, nor hitched to the plough and be made to do the work\r\nof a horse. On the contrary, he should be treated as a man, and required\r\nto perform only the work of a man. The right to such work is all the\r\nownership which any one man can rightfully have in another; and this is\r\nall which any slaveholder of the South needs to claim.\r\n\r\nThe real question is, _Can one man have a right to the personal service\r\nor obedience of another without his consent?_ We do not intend to let\r\nthe abolitionist throw dust in our eyes, and shout victory amid a clamor\r\nof words. We intend to hold him to the point. Whether he be a learned\r\ndivine, or a distinguished senator, we intend he shall speak to the\r\npoint, or else his argument shall be judged, not according to the\r\neloquent noise it makes or the excitement it produces, but according to\r\nthe _sense_ it contains.\r\n\r\n_Can a man, then, have a right to the labor or obedience of another\r\nwithout his consent?_ Give us this right, and it is all we ask. We lay\r\nno claim to the soul of the slave. We grant to the abolitionist, even\r\nmore freely than he can assert, that the \"soul of the slave is his own.\"\r\nOr, rather, we grant that his soul belongs exclusively to the God who\r\ngave it. The master may use him not as a tree or a brute, but only as a\r\nrational, accountable, and immortal being may be used. He may not\r\ncommand him to do any thing which is wrong; and if he should so far\r\nforget himself as to require such service of his slave, he would himself\r\nbe guilty of the act. If he should require his slave to violate any law\r\nof the land, he would be held not as a _particeps criminis_ merely, but\r\nas a criminal in the first degree. In like manner, if he should require\r\nhim to violate the law of God, he would be guilty--far more guilty than\r\nthe slave himself--in the sight of heaven. These are truths which are\r\njust as well understood at the South as they are at the North.\r\n\r\nThe master, we repeat, lays no claim to the soul of the slave. He\r\ndemands no spiritual service of him, he exacts no divine honors. With\r\nhis own soul he is fully permitted to serve his own God. With this soul\r\nhe may follow the solemn injunction of the Most High, \"Servants, obey\r\nyour masters;\" or he may listen to the voice of the tempter, \"Servants,\r\nfly from your masters.\" Those only who instigate him to violate the law\r\nof God, whether at the North or at the South, are the men who seek to\r\ndeprive him of his rights and to exercise an infamous dominion over his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nSince, then, the master claims only a right to the labor and lawful\r\nobedience of the slave, and no right whatever to his soul, it follows\r\nthat the argument, which Dr. Channing regards as the strongest of his\r\nseven, has no real foundation. Since the master claims to have no\r\nproperty in the \"rational, moral, and immortal\" part of his being, so\r\nall the arguments, or rather all the empty declamation, based on the\r\nfalse supposition of such claim, falls to the ground. So the passionate\r\nappeals, proceeding on the supposition of such a monstrous claim, and\r\naddressed to the religious sensibilities of the multitude, are only\r\ncalculated to deceive and mislead their judgment. It is a mere thing of\r\nwords; and, though \"full of sound and fury,\" it signifies nothing. \"The\r\ntraffic in human souls,\" which figures so largely in the speeches of the\r\ndivines and demagogues, and which so fiercely stirs up the most\r\nunhallowed passions of their hearers, _is merely the transfer of a right\r\nto labor_.\r\n\r\nDoes any one doubt whether such a right may exist? The master certainly\r\nhas a right to the labor of his apprentice for a specified period of\r\ntime, though he has no right to his soul even for a moment. The father,\r\ntoo, has a right to the personal service and obedience of his child\r\nuntil he reach the age of twenty-one; but no one ever supposed that he\r\nowned the soul of his child, or might sell it, if he pleased, to\r\nanother. Though he may not sell the soul of his child, it is universally\r\nadmitted that he may, for good and sufficient reasons, transfer his\r\nright to the labor and obedience of his child. Why, then, should it be\r\nthought impossible that such a right to service may exist for life? If\r\nit may exist for one period, why not for a longer, and even for life?\r\nIf the good of both parties and the good of the whole community require\r\nsuch a relation and such a right to exist, why should it be deemed so\r\nunjust, so iniquitous, so monstrous? This whole controversy turns, we\r\nrepeat, not upon any consideration of abstract rights, but solely upon\r\nthe highest good of all--upon the highest good of the slave as well as\r\nupon that of the community.\r\n\r\n\"It is plain,\" says Dr. Channing, in his first argument, \"that if any\r\none may be held as property, then any other man may be so held.\" This\r\nsophism has been already sufficiently refuted. It proceeds on the\r\nsupposition that if one man, however incapable of self-government, may\r\nbe placed under the control of another, then all men may be placed under\r\nthe control of others! It proceeds on the idea that all men should be\r\nplaced in precisely the same condition, subjected to precisely the same\r\nauthority, and required to perform precisely the same kind of labor. In\r\none word, it sees no difference and makes no distinction between a Negro\r\nand a Newton. But as an overstrained and false idea of equality lies at\r\nthe foundation of this argument, so it will pass under review again,\r\nwhen we come to consider the great demonstration which the abolitionist\r\nis accustomed to deduce from the axiom that \"all men are created equal.\"\r\n\r\nThe third argument of Dr. Channing is, like the first, \"founded on the\r\nessential equality of men.\" Hence, like the first, it may be postponed\r\nuntil we come to consider the true meaning and the real political\r\nsignificancy of the natural equality of all men. We shall barely remark,\r\nin passing, that two arguments cannot be made out of one by merely\r\nchanging the mode of expression.\r\n\r\nThe second argument of the author is as follows: \"A man cannot be seized\r\nand held as property, because he has rights. . . . A being having rights\r\ncannot justly be made property, _for this claim over him virtually\r\nannuls all his rights_.\" This argument, it is obvious, is based on the\r\narbitrary idea which the author has been pleased to attach to the term\r\n_property_. If it proves any thing, it would prove that a horse could\r\nnot be held as property, for a horse certainly has rights. But, as we\r\nhave seen, a limited property, or a right to the labor of a man, does\r\nnot deny or annul all his rights, nor necessarily any one of them. This\r\nargument needs no further refutation. For we acknowledge that the slave\r\nhas rights; and the limited or qualified property which the master\r\nclaims in him, extending merely to his personal human labor and his\r\nlawful obedience, touches not one of these rights.\r\n\r\nThe fourth argument of Dr. Channing is identical with the second. \"That\r\na human being,\" says he, \"cannot be justly held as property, is apparent\r\nfrom _the very nature of property_. Property is an exclusive right. It\r\nshuts out all claim but that of the possessor. What one man owns cannot\r\nbelong to another.\" The only difference between the two arguments is\r\nthis: in one the \"_nature of_ property\" is said \"to annul all rights;\"\r\nand in the other it is said \"to exclude all rights!\" Both are based on\r\nthe same idea of property, and both arrive at the same conclusion, with\r\nonly a very slight difference in the mode of expression!\r\n\r\nAnd both are equally unsound. True; \"what one man owns cannot belong to\r\nanother.\" But may not one man have a right to the labor of another, as a\r\nfather to the labor of his son, or a master to the labor of his\r\napprentice; and yet that other a right to food and raiment, as well as\r\nto other things? May not one have a right to the service of another,\r\nwithout annulling or excluding all the rights of that other? This\r\nargument proceeds, it is evident, on the false supposition that if any\r\nbeing be held as property, then he has no rights; a supposition which,\r\nif true, would exclude and annul the right of property in every living\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nDr. Channing's fifth argument is deduced from \"the universal indignation\r\nexcited toward _a man_ who makes another his slave.\" \"Our laws,\" says\r\nhe, \"know no higher crime than that of reducing a man to slavery. To\r\nsteal or to buy an African on his own shores is piracy.\" \"To steal a\r\nman,\" we reply, is one thing; and, by the authority of the law of the\r\nland, to require him to do certain labor, is, one would think, quite\r\nanother. The first may be as high a crime as any known to our laws; the\r\nlast is recognized by our laws themselves. Is it not wonderful that Dr.\r\nChanning could not see so plain a distinction, so broad and so glaring a\r\ndifference? The father of his country held slaves; _he did not commit\r\nthe crime of man-stealing_.\r\n\r\nThe sixth argument of Dr. Channing, \"against the right of property in\r\nman,\" is \"drawn from a very obvious principle of moral science. It is a\r\nplain truth, universally received, that every right supposes or involves\r\na corresponding obligation. If, then, a man has a right to another's\r\nperson or powers, the latter is under obligation to give himself up as\r\na chattel to the former.\" Most assuredly, if one man has a right to the\r\nservice or obedience of another, then that other is under obligation to\r\nrender that service or obedience to him. But is such an obligation\r\nabsurd? Is it inconsistent with the inherent, the inalienable, the\r\nuniversal rights of man that the \"servant should obey his master?\" If\r\nso, then we fear the rights of man were far better understood by Dr.\r\nChanning than by the Creator of the world and the Author of revelation.\r\n\r\nSuch are the seven arguments adduced by Dr. Channing to show that no man\r\ncan rightfully hold property in his fellow-man. But before we quit this\r\nbranch of the subject, we shall advert to a passage in the address of\r\nthe Hon. Charles Sumner, before the people of New York, at the\r\nMetropolitan Theatre, May 9, 1855. \"I desire to present this argument,\"\r\nsays he, \"on grounds above all controversy, impeachment, or suspicion,\r\neven from slave-masters themselves. Not on triumphant story, not even on\r\nindisputable facts, do I now accuse slavery, but on its character, as\r\nrevealed in its own simple definition of itself. Out of its own mouth do\r\nI condemn it.\" Well, and why does he condemn it? Because, \"by the law of\r\nslavery, man, created in the image of God, is _divested of his human\r\ncharacter_ and declared to be a _mere_ chattel. That the statement may\r\nnot seem to be put forward without precise authority, I quote the law of\r\ntwo different slave States.\" That is the accusation. It is to be proved\r\nby the law of slavery itself. It is to be proved beyond \"all\r\ncontroversy,\" by an appeal to \"indisputable facts.\" Now let us have the\r\nfacts: here they are. \"The law of another polished slave State, says Mr.\r\nSumner, \"gives this definition: 'Slaves shall be delivered, sold, taken,\r\nreputed, and adjudged in law to be chattels personal, in the hands of\r\ntheir owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators, and\r\nassignees, to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever.'\"\r\n\r\nNow, _mark_; the learned Senator undertook to prove, beyond all doubt\r\nand controversy, that slavery _divests the slave of his human\r\ncharacter_, and declares him to be a _mere_ chattel. But he merely\r\nproves that it declares him to be a \"chattel personal.\" He merely proves\r\nthat the law of a Southern State regards the slave, not as real estate\r\nor landed property, but as a \"chattel personal.\" Does this divest him of\r\nhis human character? Does this make him a _mere_ chattel? May the\r\nslave, in consequence of such law, be treated as a brute or a tree? May\r\nhe be cut in pieces or worked to death at the will and pleasure of the\r\nmaster?\r\n\r\n\"We think that a learned Senator, especially when he undertakes to\r\ndemonstrate, should distinguish between declaring a man to be \"a chattel\r\npersonal,\" and a _mere_ chattel. No one doubts that a man is a thing;\r\nbut is he therefore a _mere_ thing, or nothing more than a thing? In\r\nlike manner, no one doubts that a man is an animal; does it follow,\r\ntherefore, that he is a _mere_ animal, or nothing but an animal? It is\r\nclear, that to declare a man may be held as a \"chattel personal,\" is a\r\nvery different thing from declaring that he is a _mere_ chattel. So much\r\nfor his honor's \"precise authority.\"\r\n\r\nIn what part of the law, then, is the slave \"divested of his human\r\ncharacter?\" In no part whatever. If it had declared him to be a _mere_\r\nthing, or a _mere_ chattel, or a _mere_ animal, it would have denied his\r\nhuman character, we admit; but the law in question has done no such\r\nthing. Nor is any such declaration contained in the other law quoted by\r\nthe learned Senator from the code of Louisiana. It is _merely_ by the\r\ninterpolation of this little word _mere_, that the Senator of\r\nMassachusetts has made the law of South Carolina divest an immortal\r\nbeing of his \"human character.\" He is welcome to all the applause which\r\nthis may have gained for him in the \"Metropolitan Theatre.\"\r\n\r\nThe learned Senator adduces another authority. \"A careful writer,\" says\r\nhe, \"Judge Stroud, in a work of juridical as well as philanthropic\r\nmerit, thus sums up the laws: 'The cardinal principle of slavery--that\r\nthe slave is not to be ranked among _sentient_[156] beings, but among\r\nthings--as an article of property--a chattel personal--obtains as\r\nundoubted law in all these (the slave) States.'\" We thus learn from this\r\nvery \"careful writer\" that slaves among us are \"not ranked among\r\n_sentient_ beings,\" and that this is \"the cardinal principle of\r\nslavery.\" No, they are not fed, nor clothed, nor treated as sentient\r\nbeings! They are left without food and raiment, just as if they were\r\nstocks and stones! They are not talked to, nor reasoned with, as if they\r\nwere rational animals, but only driven about, like dumb brutes beneath\r\nthe lash! No, no, not the lash, for that would recognize them as\r\n\"sentient beings!\" They are only thrown about like stones, or boxed up\r\nlike chattels; they are not set, like men, over the lower animals,\r\nrequired to do the work of men; the precise work which, of all others,\r\nin the grand and diversified economy of _human_ industry, they are the\r\nbest qualified to perform! So far, indeed, is this from being \"the\r\ncardinal principle of slavery,\" that it is no principle of slavery at\r\nall. It bears not the most distant likeness or approximation to any\r\nprinciple of slavery, with which we of the South have any the most\r\nremote acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThat man may, in certain cases, be held as property, is a truth\r\nrecognized by a higher authority than that of senators and divines. It\r\nis, as we have seen, recognized by the word of God himself. In that\r\nword, the slave is called the \"possession\"[157] of the master, and even\r\n\"his money.\"[158] Now, is not this language as strong, if not stronger,\r\nthan that adduced from the code of South Carolina? It certainly calls\r\nthe \"bondman\" his master's \"money.\" Why, then, did not the Senator from\r\nMassachusetts denounce this language, as divesting \"a man of his human\r\ncharacter,\" and declaring him to be _mere_ money? Why did he not proceed\r\nto condemn the legislation of Heaven, as well as of the South, out of\r\nits own mouth? Most assuredly, if his principles be correct, then is he\r\nbound to pronounce the law of God itself manifestly unjust and\r\niniquitous. For that law as clearly recognizes the right of property in\r\nman as it could possibly be recognized in words. But it nowhere commits\r\nthe flagrant solecism of supposing that this right of the master annuls\r\nor excludes all the rights of the slave. On the contrary, the rights of\r\nthe slave are recognized, as well as those of the master. For, according\r\nto the law of God, though \"a possession,\" and an \"inheritance,\" and \"a\r\nbondman forever,\" yet is the slave, nevertheless, a man; and, as a man,\r\nis he protected in his rights; in his rights, not as defined by\r\nabolitionists, but as recognized by the word of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ XI. _The seventeenth fallacy of the abolitionist; or the argument from\r\nthe Declaration of Independence._\r\n\r\nThis argument is regarded by the abolitionists as one of their great\r\nstrongholds; and no doubt it is so in effect, for who can bear a\r\nsuperior? Lucifer himself, who fell from heaven because he could not\r\nacknowledge a superior, seduced our first parents by the suggestion that\r\nin throwing off the yoke of subjection, they should become \"as gods.\" We\r\nneed not wonder, then, if it should be found, that an appeal to the\r\nabsolute equality of all men is the most ready way to effect the ruin of\r\nStates. We can surely conceive of none better adapted to subvert all\r\norder among us of the South, involving the two races in a servile war,\r\nand the one or the other in utter extinction. Hence we shall examine\r\nthis argument from the equality of all men, or rather this appeal to all\r\nmen's abhorrence of inferiority. This appeal is usually based on the\r\nDeclaration of Independence: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident:\r\nthat all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator\r\nwith certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness.\" We do not mean to play upon these words; we\r\nintend to take them exactly as they are understood by our opponents. As\r\nthey are not found in a metaphysical document or discussion, so it would\r\nbe unfair to suppose--as is sometimes done--that they inculcate the wild\r\ndream of Helvetius, that all men are created with equal natural\r\ncapacities of mind. They occur in a declaration of independence; and as\r\nthe subject is the doctrine of human rights, so we suppose they mean to\r\ndeclare that all men are created equal with respect to natural rights.\r\n\r\nNor do we assert that there is no truth in this celebrated proposition\r\nor maxim; for we believe that, if rightly understood, it contains most\r\nimportant and precious truth. It is not on this account, however, the\r\nless dangerous as a maxim of political philosophy. Nay, falsehood is\r\nonly then the more dangerous, when it is so blended with truth that its\r\nexistence is not suspected by its victims. Hence the unspeakable\r\nimportance of dissecting this pretended maxim, and separating the\r\nprecious truth it contains from the pernicious falsehood by which its\r\nfollowers are deceived. Its truth is certainly very far from being\r\nself-evident, or rather its truth is self-evident to some, while its\r\nfalsehood is equally self-evident to others, according to the side from\r\nwhich it is viewed. We shall endeavor to throw some light both upon its\r\ntruth and its falsehood, and, if possible, draw the line which divides\r\nthem from each other.\r\n\r\nThis maxim does not mean, then, that all men have, by nature, an equal\r\nright to political power or to posts of honor. No doubt the words are\r\noften understood in this sense by those who, without reflection, merely\r\necho the Declaration of Independence; but, in this sense, they are\r\nutterly untenable. If all men had, by nature, an equal right to any of\r\nthe offices of government, how could such rights be adjusted? How could\r\nsuch a conflict be reconciled? It is clear that all men could not be\r\nPresident of the United States; and if all men had an equal natural\r\nright to that office, no one man could be elevated to it without a wrong\r\nto all the rest. In such case, all men should have, at least, an equal\r\nchance to occupy the presidential chair. Such equal chance could not\r\nresult from the right of all men to offer themselves as candidates for\r\nthe office; for, at the bar of public opinion, vast multitudes would not\r\nhave the least shadow of a chance. The only way to effect such an object\r\nwould be by resorting to the lot. We might thus determine who, among so\r\nmany equally just claimants, should actually possess the power of the\r\nsupreme magistrate. This, it must be confessed, would be to recognize in\r\ndeed, as well as in word, the equal rights of all men. But what more\r\nabsurd than such an equality of rights? It is not without example in\r\nhistory; but it is to be hoped that such example will never be copied.\r\nThe democracy of Athens, it is well known, was, at one time, so far\r\ncarried away by the idea of equal rights, that her generals and orators\r\nand poets were elected by the lot. This was an equality, not in theory\r\nmerely, but in practice. Though the lives and fortunes of mankind were\r\nthus intrusted to the most ignorant and depraved, or to the most wise\r\nand virtuous, as the lot might determine, yet this policy was based on\r\nan equality of rights. It is scarcely necessary to add that this idea of\r\nequality prevailed, not in the better days of the Athenian democracy,\r\nbut only during its imbecility and corruption.\r\n\r\nIf all men, then, have not a natural right to fill an office of\r\ngovernment, who has this right? Who has the natural right, for example,\r\nto occupy the office of President of the United States? Certainly some\r\nmen have no such right. The man, for example, who has no capacity to\r\ngovern himself, but needs a guardian, has no right to superintend the\r\naffairs of a great nation. Though a citizen, he has no more right to\r\nexercise such power or authority than if he were a Hottentot, or an\r\nAfrican, or an ape. Hence, in bidding such a one to stand aside and\r\nkeep aloof from such high office, no right is infringed and no injury\r\ndone. Nay, right is secured, and injury prevented.\r\n\r\nWho has such a right, then?--such natural right, or right according to\r\nthe law of nature or reason? The man, we answer, who, all things\r\nconsidered, is the best qualified to discharge the duties of the office.\r\nThe man who, by his superior wisdom, and virtue, and statesmanship,\r\nwould use the power of such office more effectually for the good of the\r\nwhole people than would any other man. If there be one such man, and\r\nonly one, he of _natural right_ should be our President. And all the\r\nlaws framed to regulate the election of President are, or should be,\r\nonly so many means designed to secure the services of that man, if\r\npossible, and thereby secure the rights of all against the possession of\r\npower by the unworthy or the less worthy. This object, it is true, is\r\nnot always attained, these means are not always successful; but this is\r\nonly one of the manifold imperfections which necessarily attach to all\r\nhuman institutions; one of the melancholy instances in which natural and\r\nlegal right run in different channels. All that can be hoped, indeed,\r\neither in the construction or in the administration of human laws, is an\r\napproximation, more or less close, to the great principles of natural\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nWhat is thus so clearly true in regard to the office of President, is\r\nequally true in regard to all the other offices of government. It is\r\ncontrary to reason, to natural right, to justice, that either fools, or\r\nknaves, or demagogues should occupy seats in Congress; yet all of these\r\nclasses are sometimes seen there, and by the law of the land are\r\nentitled to their seats. Here, again, that which is right and fit in\r\nitself is different from that which exists under the law.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks, it is evident, are applicable to governors, to judges,\r\nto sheriffs, to constables, and to justices of the peace. In every\r\ninstance, he who is best qualified to discharge the duties of an office,\r\nand who would do so with greatest advantage to all concerned, has the\r\nnatural right thereto. And no man who would fill any office, or exercise\r\nany power so as to injure the community, has any right to such office or\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThere is precisely the same limitation to the exercise of the elective\r\nfranchise. Those only should be permitted to exercise this power who are\r\nqualified to do so with advantage to the community; and all laws which\r\nregulate or limit the possession of this power should have in view, not\r\nthe equal rights of all men, but solely and exclusively the public good.\r\nIt is on this principle that foreigners are not allowed to vote as soon\r\nas they land upon our shores, and that native Americans can do so only\r\nafter they have reached a certain age. And if the public good required\r\nthat any class of men, such as free blacks or slaves, for example,\r\nshould be excluded from the privilege altogether, then no doubt can\r\nremain the law excluding them would be just. It might not be equal, but\r\nwould be _just_. Indeed, in the high and holy sense of the word, it\r\nwould be equal; for, if it excluded some from a privilege or power which\r\nit conferred upon others, this is because they were not included within\r\nthe condition on which alone it should be extended to any. Such is not\r\nan equality of rights and power, it is true; but it is an equality of\r\njustice, like that which reigns in the divine government itself. In the\r\nlight of that justice, it is clear that no man, and no class of men, can\r\nhave a natural right to exercise a power which, if intrusted to them,\r\nwould be wielded for harm, and not for good.\r\n\r\nThis great truth, when stripped of the manifold sophistications of a\r\nfalse logic, is so clear and unquestionable, that it has not failed to\r\nsecure the approbation of abolitionists themselves. Thus, after all his\r\nwild extravagancies about inherent, inalienable, and equal rights, Dr.\r\nChanning has, in one of his calmer moods, recognized this great\r\nfundamental truth. \"The slave,\" says he, \"cannot rightfully, and should\r\nnot, be owned by the individual. But, like every citizen, _he is subject\r\nto the community_, AND THE COMMUNITY HAS A RIGHT AND IS BOUND TO\r\nCONTINUE ALL SUCH RESTRAINTS AS ITS OWN SAFETY AND THE WELL-BEING OF THE\r\nSLAVE DEMANDS.\" Now this is all we ask in regard to the question of\r\nequal rights. All we ask is, that each and every individual may be in\r\nsuch wise and so far restrained as the public good demands and no\r\nfurther. All we ask is, as may be seen from the first chapter of this\r\nEssay, that the right of the individual, whether real or imaginary, may\r\nbe held in subjection to the undoubted right of the community to protect\r\nitself and to secure its own highest good. This solemn right, so\r\ninseparably linked to a sacred duty, is paramount to the rights and\r\npowers of the individual. Nay, as we have already seen,[159] the\r\nindividual can have no right that conflicts with this; because it is\r\nhis _duty_ to co-operate in the establishment of the general good.\r\nSurely he can have no right which is adverse to duty. Indeed, if for the\r\ngeneral good, he would not cheerfully lay down both liberty and life,\r\nthen both may be rightfully taken from him. We have, it is true,\r\ninherent and _inalienable rights_, but among these is neither liberty\r\nnor life. For these, upon our country's altar, may be sacrificed; but\r\nconscience, truth, honor may not be touched by man.\r\n\r\nHas the community, then, after all, the right to compel \"a man,\" a\r\n\"rational and immortal being,\" to work? Let Dr. Channing answer: \"If he\r\n(the slave) cannot be induced to work by rational and natural motives,\r\n_he should be obliged to labor, on the same principle on which the\r\nvagrant in other communities is confined and compelled to earn his\r\nbread_.\" Now, if a man be \"confined, and compelled\" to work in his\r\nconfinement, what becomes of his \"inalienable right to liberty?\" We\r\nthink there must be a slight mistake somewhere. Perhaps it is in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence itself. Nay, is it not evident, indeed, that\r\nif all men have an inalienable right to liberty,\" then is this sacred\r\nright trampled in the dust by every government on earth? Is it not as\r\nreally disregarded by the enlightened Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\r\nwhich \"confines and compels\" vagrants to earn their bread, as it is by\r\nthe Legislature of Virginia, which has taken the wise precaution to\r\nprevent the rise of a swarm of vagrants more destructive than the\r\nlocusts of Egypt? The plain truth is, that although this notion of the\r\n\"inalienable right\" of all to liberty may sound very well in a\r\ndeclaration of independence, and may be most admirably adapted to stir\r\nup the passions of men and produce fatal commotions in a commonwealth,\r\nyet no wise nation ever has been or ever will be guided by it in the\r\nconstruction of her laws. It may be a brand of discord in the hands of\r\nthe abolitionist and the demagogue. It will never be an element of\r\nlight, or power, or wisdom, in the bosom of the statesman.\r\n\r\n\"The gift of liberty,\" continues Dr. Channing, \"would be a mere name,\r\nand worse than nominal, were he (the slave) to be let loose on society\r\nunder circumstances driving him to commit crimes, for which he would be\r\ncondemned to severer bondage than he had escaped.\" If then, after all,\r\nliberty may be worse than a mere name, is it not a pity that all men\r\nshould have an \"inalienable right\" to it? If it may be a curse, is it\r\nnot a pity that all men should be required to embrace it, and to be even\r\nready to die for it, as an invaluable blessing? We trust that \"no man,\"\r\nthat \"no rational and immortal being,\" will ever be so ungrateful as to\r\ncomplain of those who have withheld from him that which is \"worse than\r\nnominal,\" and a curse. For if such, and such only, be his inalienable\r\nbirthright, were it not most wisely exchanged for a mess of pottage? The\r\nvagrant, then, should not be consulted whether he will work or not. He\r\nshould be \"confined and compelled\" to work, says Dr. Channing. Nor\r\nshould the idle and the vicious, those who cannot be induced to work by\r\nrational motives, be asked whether they will remain pests to society, or\r\nwhether they will eat their bread in the sweat of their brow. \"For they,\r\ntoo,\" says Dr. Channing, \"should be compelled to work.\" But how? \"The\r\nslave should not have an owner,\" says Dr. Channing, \"but he should have\r\na guardian. He needs authority, to supply the lack of that discretion\r\nwhich he has not yet attained; but it should be the authority of a\r\nfriend, an official authority, conferred by the State, and for which\r\nthere should be responsibility to the State.\" Now, if all this be true,\r\nis not the doctrine of equal rights, as held by Dr. Channing, a mere\r\ndream? If one man may have \"a guardian,\" \"an official authority,\"\r\nappointed by the State, to compel him to work, why may not another be\r\nplaced under the same authority, and subjected to the same servitude?\r\nAre not all equal? Have not all men an equal right to liberty and to a\r\nchoice of the pursuits of happiness? Let these questions be answered by\r\nthe admirers of Dr. Channing; and it will be found that they have\r\noverthrown all the plausible logic, and blown away all the splendid\r\nrhetoric, which has been reared, on the ground of equal rights, against\r\nthe institution of slavery at the South.\r\n\r\nWe are agreed, then, that men may be compelled to work. We are also\r\nagreed that, for this purpose, the slaves of the South should be placed\r\nunder guardians and friends by the authority of the State. Dr. Channing\r\nthinks, however, that the owner is not the best guardian or the best\r\nfriend whom the State could place over the slave. On the contrary, he\r\nthinks his best friend and guardian would be an official overseer, bound\r\nto him by no ties of interest, and by no peculiar feelings of affection.\r\nIn all this, we think Dr. Channing greatly mistaken; and mistaken\r\nbecause he is an utter stranger to the feelings usually called forth by\r\nthe relation of master and slave. But, be this as it may, since such are\r\nthe concessions made by Dr. Channing, it is no longer necessary to\r\ndebate the question of slavery with him, on the high ground of abstract\r\ninalienable rights. It is brought down to one of practical utility, of\r\npublic expediency.\r\n\r\nAnd such being the nature of the question, we, as free citizens of the\r\nSouth, claim the right to settle the matter for ourselves. We claim the\r\nright to appoint such guardians and friends for this class of our\r\npopulation as we believe will be most advantageous to them, as well as\r\nto the whole community. We claim the right to impose such restraints,\r\nand such only, as the well-being of our own society seems to us to\r\ndemand. This claim may be denied. The North may claim the right to think\r\nfor us in regard to this question of expediency. But it cannot be denied\r\nthat if liberty may be a curse, then no man can, in such case, have a\r\nright to it as a blessing.\r\n\r\nIf liberty would be an equal blessing to all men, then, we freely admit,\r\nall men would have an equal right to liberty. But to concede, as Dr.\r\nChanning does, that it were a curse to some men and yet contend that all\r\nmen have an equal right to its enjoyment, is sheer absurdity and\r\nnonsense. But Dr. Channing, as we have seen, sometimes speaks a better\r\nsense. Thus, he has even said, \"It would be cruelty, not kindness, to\r\nthe latter (to the slave) to give him a freedom which he is unprepared\r\nto understand or enjoy. It would be cruelty to strike the fetters from a\r\nman whose first steps would infallibly lead him to a precipice.\" So far,\r\nthen, according to the author himself, are all men from having an\r\n\"inalienable right\" to liberty, that some men have no right to it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, Dr. Wayland, by his own admission, has overthrown all\r\nhis most confident deductions from the notion of equal rights. He, too,\r\nquotes the Declaration of Independence, and adds, \"That the equality\r\nhere spoken of is not of the means of happiness, but in the right to use\r\nthem as one wills, is too evident to need illustration.\" If this be the\r\nmeaning, then the meaning is not so evidently true. On the contrary, the\r\nvaunted maxim in question, as understood by Dr. Wayland, appears to be\r\npure and unmixed error. Power, for example, is one means of happiness;\r\nand so great a means, too, that without it all other means would be of\r\nno avail. But has any man a right to use this means of happiness as he\r\nwills? Most assuredly not. He has no right to use the power he may\r\npossess, nor any other means of happiness, as he will, but only as\r\nlawful authority has willed. If it be a power conferred by man, for\r\nexample, such as that of a chief magistrate, or of a senator, or of a\r\njudge, he may use it no otherwise than as the law of the land permits,\r\nor in pursuance of the objects for which it was conferred. In like\r\nmanner, if it proceed from the Almighty, it may be used only in\r\nconformity with his law. So far, then, is it from being true that all\r\nmen possess an equal right to use the means of happiness as they please,\r\nthat no man ever has, or ever will, possess any such right at all. And\r\nif such be the meaning of the Declaration of Independence, then the\r\nDeclaration of Independence is too evidently erroneous to need any\r\nfurther refutation. Unless, indeed, man may put forth a declaration of\r\nindependence which shall annul and destroy the immutable obligations of\r\nthe moral law, and erect _one's will_ as the rule of right. But is an\r\nequal exemption from the restraints of that law liberty, or is it\r\nuniversal anarchy and confusion?\r\n\r\nIt were much nearer the truth to say that all men have an equal right,\r\nnot to act as \"one wills,\" but to have their wills restrained by law. No\r\ngreater want is known to man, indeed, than the restraints of law and\r\ngovernment. Hence, all men have an equal right to these, but not to the\r\nsame restraints, to the same laws and governments. All have an equal\r\nright to that government which is the best for them. But the same\r\ngovernment is not the best for all. A despotism is best for some; a\r\nlimited monarchy is best for others; while, for a third people, a\r\nrepresentative republic is the best form of government.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is too plain for controversy. It has received the\r\nsanction of all the great teachers of political wisdom, from an\r\nAristotle down to a Montesquieu, and from a Montesquieu down to a Burke.\r\nIt has become, indeed, one of the commonplaces of political ethics; and,\r\nhowever strange the conjunction, it is often found in the very works\r\nwhich are loudest in proclaiming the universal equality of human rights.\r\nThus, for example, says Dr. Wayland: \"The best form of government for\r\nany people _is the best that its present moral condition renders\r\npracticable. A people may be so entirely surrendered to the influence of\r\npassion, and so feebly influenced by moral restraints, that a\r\ngovernment which relied upon moral restraint could not exist for a day_.\r\nIn this case, a subordinate and inferior principle remains--_the\r\nprinciple of fear, and the only resort is to a government of force_ or a\r\nmilitary despotism. And such do we see to be the fact.\" What, then,\r\nbecomes of the equal and inalienable right of all men to freedom? Has it\r\nvanished with the occasion which gave it birth?\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. \"Anarchy,\" continues Wayland, \"always ends in this\r\nform of government. [A military despotism.] After this has been\r\nestablished, and habits of subordination have been formed, while the\r\nmoral restraints are too feeble for self-government, an hereditary\r\ngovernment, which addresses itself to the imagination, and strengthens\r\nitself by the influence of domestic connections, may be as good a form\r\nas a people can sustain. As they advance in intellectual and moral\r\ncultivation, it may advantageously become more and more elective, and,\r\nin a suitable moral condition, it may be wholly so. For beings who are\r\nwilling to govern themselves by moral principles, there can be no doubt\r\nthat a government relying upon moral principle is the true form of\r\ngovernment. There is no reason why a man should be oppressed by taxation\r\nand subjected to fear who is willing to govern himself by the law of\r\nreciprocity. It is surely better for an intelligent and moral being to\r\ndo right from his own will, than _to pay another to force him to do\r\nright_. And yet, as it is better that he should do right than wrong,\r\neven though he be forced to do it, it is well that he should pay others\r\nto force him, if there be no other way of insuring his good conduct. God\r\nhas rendered the blessing of freedom inseparable from moral restraint to\r\nthe individual; and hence it is vain for a people to expect to be free\r\nunless they are first willing to be virtuous.\" Again, \"There is no\r\nself-sustaining power in any form of social organization. The only\r\nself-sustaining power is in individual virtue.\r\n\r\n\"And the form of a government will always adjust itself to the moral\r\ncondition of a people. A virtuous people will, by their own moral power,\r\nfrown away oppression, and, under any form of constitution, become\r\nessentially free. A people surrendered up to their own licentious\r\npassions must be held in subjection by force; for every one will find\r\nthat force alone can protect him from his neighbors; and he will submit\r\nto be oppressed, if he can only be protected. Thus, in the feudal ages,\r\nthe small independent landholders frequently made themselves slaves of\r\none powerful chief to shield themselves from the incessant oppression of\r\ntwenty.\"\r\n\r\nNow all this is excellent sense. One might almost imagine that the\r\nauthor had been reading Aristotle, or Montesquieu, or Burke. It is\r\ncertain he was not thinking of equal rights. It is equally certain that\r\nhis eyes were turned away from the South; for he could see how even\r\n\"independent landholders\" might rightfully make slaves of themselves.\r\nAfter such concessions, one would think that all this clamor about\r\ninherent and _inalienable_ rights ought to cease.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense, or to a certain extent, all men have equal rights.\r\nAll men have an equal right to the air and light of heaven; to the same\r\nair and the same light. In like manner, all men have an equal right to\r\nfood and raiment, though not to the same food and raiment. That is, all\r\nmen have an equal right to food and raiment, provided they will earn\r\nthem. And if they will not earn them, choosing to remain idle,\r\nimprovident, or nuisances to society, then they should be placed under a\r\ngovernment of force, and compelled to earn them.\r\n\r\nAgain, all men have an equal right to serve God according to the\r\ndictates of their own consciences. The poorest slave on earth possesses\r\nthis right--this inherent and inalienable right; and he possesses it as\r\ncompletely as the proudest monarch on his throne. He may choose his own\r\nreligion, and worship his own God according to his own conscience,\r\nprovided always he seek not in such service to interfere with the rights\r\nof others. But neither the slave nor the freeman has any right to\r\nmurder, or instigate others to murder, the master, even though he should\r\nbe ever so firmly persuaded that such is a part of his religious duty.\r\nHe has, however, the most absolute and perfect right to worship the\r\nCreator of all men in all ways not inconsistent with the moral law. And\r\nwo be to the man by whom such right is denied or set at naught! Such a\r\none we have never known; but whosoever he may be, or wheresoever he may\r\nbe found, let all the abolitionists, we say, hunt him down. He is not\r\nfit to be a man, much less a Christian master.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be said, the slave has also a right to religious\r\ninstruction, as well as to food and raiment. So plain a proposition no\r\none doubts. But is this right regarded at the South? No more, we fear,\r\nthan in many other portions of the so-called Christian world. Our\r\nchildren, too, and our poor, destitute neighbors, often suffer, we fear,\r\nthe same wrong at our remiss hands and from our cold hearts. Though we\r\nhave done much and would fain do more, yet, the truth must be confessed,\r\nthis sacred and imperious claim has not been fully met by us.\r\n\r\nIt may be otherwise at the North. There, children and poor neighbors,\r\ntoo, may all be trained and taught to the full extent of the moral law.\r\nThis godlike work may be fully done by our Christian brethren of the\r\nNorth. They certainly have a large surplus of benevolence to bestow on\r\nus. But if this glorious work has not been fully done by them, then let\r\nhim who is without sin cast the first stone. This simple thought,\r\nperhaps, might call in doubt their right to rail at us, at least with\r\nsuch malignant bitterness and gall. This simple thought, perhaps, might\r\nsave us many a pitiless pelting of philanthropy.\r\n\r\nBut here lies the difference--here lies our peculiar sin and shame. This\r\ngreat, primordial right is, with us, denied by law. The slave shall not\r\nbe taught to read. Oh! that he might be taught! What floods of sympathy,\r\nwhat thunderings and lightnings of philanthropy, would then be spared\r\nthe world! But why, we ask, should the slave be taught to read? That he\r\nmight read the Bible, and feed on the food of eternal life, is the\r\nreply; and the reply is good.\r\n\r\nAh! if the slave would only read his Bible, and drink its very spirit\r\nin, we should rejoice at the change; for he would then be a better and a\r\nhappier man. He would then know his duty, and the high ground on which\r\nhis duty rests. He would then see, in the words of Dr. Wayland, \"_That\r\nthe duty of slaves is explicitly made known in the Bible_. They are\r\nbound to obedience, fidelity, submission, and respect to their\r\nmasters--not only to the good and kind, but also to the unkind and\r\nfroward; not, however, on the ground of duty to man, but _on the ground\r\nof duty to God_.\" But, with all, we have some little glimpse of our\r\ndangers, as well as some little sense of our duties.\r\n\r\nThe tempter is not asleep. His eye is still, as ever of old, fixed on\r\nthe forbidden tree; and thither he will point his hapless victims. Like\r\ncertain senators, and demagogues, and doctors of divinity, he will\r\npreach from the Declaration of Independence rather than from the Bible.\r\nHe will teach, not that submission, but that _resistance_, is a duty. To\r\nevery evil passion his inflammatory and murder-instigating appeals will\r\nbe made. Stung by these appeals and maddened, the poor African, it is to\r\nbe feared, would have no better notions of equality and freedom, and no\r\nbetter views of duty to God or man, than his teachers themselves have.\r\nSuch, then, being the state of things, ask us not to prepare the slave\r\nfor his own utter undoing. Ask us not--O most kind and benevolent\r\nChristian teacher!--ask us not to lay the train beneath our feet, that\r\n_you_ may no longer hold the blazing torch in vain!\r\n\r\nLet that torch be extinguished. Let all incendiary publications be\r\ndestroyed. Let no conspiracies, no insurrections, and no murders be\r\ninstigated. Let the pure precepts of the gospel and its sublime lessons\r\nof peace be everywhere set forth and inculcated. In one word, let it be\r\nseen that in reality the eternal good of the slave is aimed at, and, by\r\nthe co-operation of all, may be secured, and then may we be asked to\r\nteach him to read. But until then we shall refuse to head a conspiracy\r\nagainst the good order, the security, the morals, and against the very\r\nlives, of both the white and the black men of the South.\r\n\r\nWe might point out other respects in which men are essentially equal, or\r\n_have equal rights_. But our object is not to write a treatise on the\r\nphilosophy of politics. It is merely to expose the errors of those who\r\npush the idea of equality to an extreme, and thereby unwisely deny the\r\ngreat differences that exist among men. For if the scheme or the\r\npolitical principles of the abolitionists be correct, then there is no\r\ndifference among men, not even among the different races of men, that is\r\nworthy the attention of the statesman.\r\n\r\nThere is one difference, we admit, which the abolitionists have\r\ndiscovered between the master and the slave at the South. Whether this\r\ndiscovery be entirely original with them, or whether they received hints\r\nof it from others, it is clear that they are now fully in possession of\r\nit. The dazzling idea of equality itself has not been able to exclude it\r\nfrom their visions. For, in spite of this idea, they have discovered\r\nthat between the Southern master and slave there is a difference of\r\ncolor! Hence, as if this were the only difference, in their political\r\nharangues, whether from the stump or from the pulpit, they seldom fail\r\nto rebuke the Southern statesman in the words of the poet: \"He finds his\r\nfellow guilty of a skin not colored like his own;\" and \"for such worthy\r\ncause dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.\" Shame and confusion\r\nseize the man, we say, who thus dooms and devotes his fellow-man,\r\nbecause he finds him \"guilty of a skin!\" If his sensibilities were only\r\nas soft as his philosophy is shallow, he would certainly cry, \"Down with\r\nthe institution of slavery!\" For how could he tolerate an institution\r\nwhich has no other foundation than a difference of color? Indeed, if\r\nsuch were the only difference between the two races among us, we should\r\nourselves unite with Mr. Seward of New York, and most \"affectionately\r\nadvise all men to be born white.\" For thus, the only difference having\r\nbeen abolished, all men would be equal in fact, and consequently\r\nentitled to become equal in political rights, and power, and position.\r\nBut if such be not the only difference between the white and the black\r\nman of the South, then neither philosophy nor paint can establish an\r\nequality between them.\r\n\r\nEvery man, we admit, is a man. But this profound aphorism is not the\r\nonly one to which the political architect should give heed. An equality\r\nof conditions, of political powers and privileges, which has no solid\r\nbasis in an equality of capacity or fitness, is one of the wildest and\r\nmost impracticable of all Utopian dreams. If in the divine government\r\nsuch an equality should prevail, it is evident that all order would be\r\noverthrown, all justice extinguished, and utter confusion would reign.\r\nIn like manner, if in human government such equality should exist, it\r\nwould be only for a moment Indeed, to aim at an equality of conditions,\r\nor of rights and powers except by first aming at an equality of\r\nintelligence and virtue, is not to reform--it is to demolish--the\r\ngovernments of society. It is, indeed, to war against the eternal order\r\nof divine Providence itself in which an immutable justice ever regins.\r\n\"It is this aiming after an equality,\" says Aristotle, \"which is the\r\ncause of seditions.\" But though seditions it may have stirred up, and\r\nfierce passions kindled, yet has it never led its poor deluded victims\r\nto the boon after which they have so fondly panted.\r\n\r\nEquality is not liberty. \"The French,\" said Napoleon, \"love equality:\r\nthey care little for liberty.\" Equality is plain, simple, easily\r\nunderstood. Liberty is complex, and exceedingly difficult of\r\ncomprehension. The most illiterate peasant may, at a glance, grasp the\r\nidea of equality; the most profound statesman may not, without much care\r\nand thought, comprehend the nature of liberty. Hence it is that\r\nequality, and not liberty, so readily seizes the mind of the multitude,\r\nand so mightily inflames its passions. The French are not the only\r\npeople who care but little for liberty, while they are crazy for\r\nequality. The same blind passion, it is to be feared, is possible even\r\nin this enlightened portion of the globe. Even here, perhaps, a man may\r\nrant and rave about equality, while, really, he may know but little\r\nmore, and consequently care but little more, about that complicated and\r\nbeautiful structure called civil liberty, than a horse does about the\r\nmechanism of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, a Senator[160] of the United States declares that the\r\ndemocratic principle is \"Equality of natural rights, guaranteed and\r\nsecured to all by the laws of a just, popular government. For one, I\r\ndesire to see that principle applied to every subject of legislation, no\r\nmatter what that subject may be--to the great question involved in the\r\nresolution now before the Senate, and to every other question.\" Again,\r\nthis principle is \"the element and guarantee of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nApply this principle, then, to every subject, to every question, and see\r\nwhat kind of government would be the result. All men have an equal right\r\nto freedom from restraint, and consequently all are made equally free.\r\nAll have an equal right to the elective franchise, and to every\r\npolitical power and privilege. But suppose the government is designed\r\nfor a State in which a large majority of the population is without the\r\ncharacter, or disposition, or habits, or experience of freemen? No\r\nmatter: the equal rights of all are natural; and hence they should be\r\napplied in all cases, and to every possible \"subject of legislation.\"\r\nThe principle of equality should reign everywhere, and mold every\r\ninstitution. Surely, after what has been said, no comment is necessary\r\non a scheme so wild, on a dream so visionary. \"As distant as heaven is\r\nfrom earth,\" says Montesquieu, \"so is the true spirit of equality from\r\nthat of extreme equality.\" And just so distant is the Senator in\r\nquestion, with all his adherents, from the true idea of civil and\r\npolitical freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Senator thinks the conduct of Virginia \"singular enough,\" because,\r\nin presenting a bill of rights to Congress, she omitted the provision of\r\n\"her own bill of rights,\" \"that all men are born[161] equally free and\r\nindependent.\" We think she acted wisely. For, in truth and in deed, all\r\nmen are born absolutely dependent and utterly devoid of freedom. What\r\nright, we ask, has the new born infant? Has he the right to go where he\r\npleases? He has no power to go at all; and hence he has no more a right\r\nto go than he has to fly. Has he the right to think for himself? The\r\npower of thought is as yet wholly undeveloped. Has he the right to\r\nworship God according to his own conscience? He has no idea of God, nor\r\nof the duties due to him. The plain truth is, that no human being\r\npossesses a right until the power or capacity on which the enjoyment of\r\nthat right depends is suitably developed or acquired. The child, for\r\ninstance, has no right to think for himself, or to worship God according\r\nto the dictates of conscience, until his intellectual and moral powers\r\nare suitably developed. He is certainly not born with such rights. Nor\r\nhas he any right to go where he pleases, or attempt to do so, until he\r\nhas learned to walk. Nor has he the right then, for, according to the\r\nlaws of all civilized nations, he is subject to the control of the\r\nparent until he reaches the lawful age of freedom. The truth is, that\r\nall men are born not equally free and independent, but equally without\r\nfreedom and without independence. \"All men are born equal,\" says\r\nMontesquieu; but he does not say they \"are born equally free and\r\nindependent.\" The first proposition is true: the last is diametrically\r\nopposed to the truth.\r\n\r\nAnother Senator[162] seems to entertain the same passion for the\r\nprinciple of equality. In his speech on the Compromise Bill of 1850, he\r\nsays that \"a statesman or a founder of States\" should adopt as an axiom\r\nthe declaration, \"That all men are created equal, and have inalienable\r\nrights of life, liberty, and choice of pursuits of happiness.\" Let us\r\nsuppose, then, that this distinguished statesman is himself about to\r\nestablish a constitution for the people of Mississippi or Louisiana, in\r\nwhich there are more blacks than whites. As they all have a natural and\r\n\"inalienable right\" to liberty, of course he would make them all free.\r\nBut would he confer upon all, upon black as well as upon white, the\r\npower of the elective franchise? Most certainly. For he has said, \"We of\r\nNew York are guilty of slavery still by withholding the _right of\r\nsuffrage_ from the race we have emancipated.\" Surely, if he had to found\r\na State himself, he would not thus be guilty of slavery--of the one\r\nodious thing which his soul abhors. All would then be invested with the\r\nright of suffrage. A black legislature would be the consequence. The\r\nlaws passed by such a body would, we fear, be no better than the\r\nconstitution provided by the Senator--by the statesman--from New York.\r\n\r\n\"All men are born equal,\" says Montesquieu; but in the hands of such a\r\nthinker no danger need be apprehended from such an axiom. For having\r\ndrank deeply of the true spirit of law, he was, in matters of\r\ngovernment, ever ready to sacrifice abstract perfection to concrete\r\nutility. Neither the principle of equality, nor any other, would he\r\napply in all cases or to every subject. He was no dreamer. He was a\r\nprofound thinker and a real statesman. \"Though real equality,\" says he,\r\n\"be the very soul of a democracy, _it is so difficult to establish, that\r\nan extreme exactness in this respect is not always convenient_.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says: \"All inequalities in democracies ought to be derived\r\nfrom the nature of the government, and even from the principle of\r\nequality. For example, it may be apprehended that people who are obliged\r\nto live by labor would be too much impoverished by public employment, or\r\nneglect the duties of attending to it; that artisans would grow\r\ninsolent; and that _too great a number of freemen would overpower the\r\nancient citizens_. IN THIS CASE, THE EQUALITY IN A DEMOCRACY MAY BE\r\nSUPPRESSED FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATE.\"\r\n\r\nThus to give all men equal power where the majority is ignorant and\r\ndepraved, would be indeed to establish equality, but not liberty. On the\r\ncontrary, it would be to establish the most odious despotism on\r\nearth,--the reign of ignorance, passion, prejudice, and brutality. It\r\nwould be to establish a mere nominal equality, and a real inequality.\r\nFor, as Montesquieu says, by introducing \"too great a number of\r\nfreemen,\" the \"ancient citizens\" would be oppressed. In such case, the\r\nprinciple of equality, even in a democracy, should be \"suppressed for\r\nthe good of the State.\" It should be suppressed, in order to shut out a\r\nstill greater and more tremendous inequality. The legislator, then, who\r\naims to introduce an extreme equality, or to apply the principle of\r\nequality to every question, would really bring about the most frightful\r\nof all inequalities, especially in a commonwealth where the majority are\r\nignorant and depraved.\r\n\r\nHence the principle of equality is merely a standard toward which an\r\napproximation may be made--an approximation always limited and\r\ncontrolled by the public good. This principle should be applied, not to\r\nevery question, but only to such as the general good permits. For this\r\ngood it \"may be suppressed.\" Nay, it must be suppressed, if, without\r\nsuch suppression, the public order may not be sustained; for, as we have\r\nabundantly seen, it is only in the bosom of an enlightened public order\r\nthat liberty can live, or move, or have its being. Thus, as Montesquieu\r\nadvises, we deduce an inequality from the very principle of equality\r\nitself; since, if such inequality be not deduced and established by law,\r\na still more terrific inequality would be forced upon us. Blind passion\r\nwould dictate the laws, and brute force would reign, while innocence and\r\nvirtue would be trampled in the dust. Such is the inequality to which\r\nthe honorable senators would invite us; and that, too, by an appeal to\r\nour love of equality! If we decline the invitation, this is not because\r\nwe are the enemies, but because we are the friends, of human freedom. It\r\nis not because we love equality less, but liberty more.\r\n\r\nThe legislators of the North may, if they please, choose the principle\r\nof equality as the very \"element and guarantee\" of their liberty; and,\r\nto make that liberty perfect, they may apply it to every possible\r\n\"subject of legislation,\" and to \"every question\" under the sun. But, if\r\nwe may be permitted to choose for ourselves, we should beg to be\r\ndelivered from such an extreme equality. We should reject it as the very\r\nworst \"element,\" and the very surest \"guarantee\" of an unbounded\r\nlicentiousness and an intolerable oppression. As the \"element and\r\nguarantee\" of freedom for ourselves, and for our posterity, we should\r\ndecidedly prefer the principle of an enlightened public order.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[142] Channing's Works, vol. ii. p. 126.\r\n\r\n[143] Elements of Moral Science, Part ii. chap. i. sec. 11.\r\n\r\n[144] Moral Science, Part ii. chap. i. sec. 2.\r\n\r\n[145] Letters on Slavery, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[146] Ibid, p. 92.\r\n\r\n[147] Letters, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[148] Letters, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[149] Letters, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[150] Letters, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[151] Moral Science, Part ii. chap. i. sec. 2.\r\n\r\n[152] Letters, p. 119, 120.\r\n\r\n[153] Moral Science Part ii. chap. i. sec. 2.\r\n\r\n[154] Moral Science, Part ii. chap. i. sec. 2.\r\n\r\n[155] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[156] The _Italics_ are our own.\r\n\r\n[157] Lev. chap. xxv.\r\n\r\n[158] Exod. chap. xxi.\r\n\r\n[159] In the first chapter.\r\n\r\n[160] Mr. Chase, of Ohio.\r\n\r\n[161] \"By nature,\" in the Original Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\n[162] Mr. Seward, of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENT FROM THE SCRIPTURES.\r\n\r\nThe Argument from the Old Testament.--The Argument from the New\r\nTestament.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN discussing the arguments of the abolitionists, it was scarcely\r\npossible to avoid intimating, to a certain extent, the grounds on which\r\nwe intend to vindicate the institution of slavery, as it exists among us\r\nat the South. But these grounds are entitled to a more distinct\r\nenunciation and to a more ample illustration. In the prosecution of this\r\nobject we shall first advert to the argument from revelation; and, if we\r\nmistake not, it will be found that in the foregoing discussion we have\r\nbeen vindicating against aspersion not only the peculiar institution of\r\nthe Southern States, but also the very legislation of Heaven itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ I. _The argument from the Old Testament._\r\n\r\nThe ground is taken by Dr. Wayland and other abolitionists, that slavery\r\nis always and everywhere, _semper et ubique_, morally wrong, and should,\r\ntherefore, be instantly and universally swept away. We point to slavery\r\namong the Hebrews, and say, There is an instance in which it was not\r\nwrong, because there it received the sanction of the Almighty. Dr.\r\nWayland chooses to overlook or evade the bearing of that case upon his\r\nfundamental position; and the means by which he seeks to evade its force\r\nis one of the grossest fallacies ever invented by the brain of man.\r\n\r\nLet the reader examine and judge for himself. Here it is: \"Let us reduce\r\nthis argument to a syllogism, and it will stand thus: Whatever God\r\nsanctioned among the Hebrews he sanctions for all men and at all times.\r\nGod sanctioned slavery among the Hebrews; therefore God sanctions\r\nslavery for all men and at all times.\"\r\n\r\nNow I venture to affirm that no man at the South has ever put forth so\r\nabsurd an argument in favor of slavery,--not only in favor of slavery\r\nfor the negro race so long as they may remain unfit for freedom, but in\r\nfavor of slavery for all men and for all times. If such an argument\r\nproved any thing, it would, indeed, prove that the white man of the\r\nSouth, no less than the black, might be subjected to bondage. But no one\r\nhere argues in favor of the subjection of the white man, either South or\r\nNorth, to a state of servitude. No one here contends for the subjection\r\nto slavery of any portion of the civilized world. We only contend for\r\nslavery in certain cases; in opposition to the thesis of the\r\nabolitionist, we assert that it is not always and everywhere wrong. For\r\nthe truth of this assertion we rely upon the express authority of God\r\nhimself. We affirm that since slavery has been ordained by him, it\r\ncannot be always and everywhere wrong. And how does the abolitionist\r\nattempt to meet this reply? Why, by a little legerdemain, he converts\r\nthis reply from an argument against his position, that slavery is always\r\nand everywhere wrong, into an argument in favor of the monstrous dogma\r\nthat it is always and everywhere right! If we should contend that, in\r\nsome cases, it is right to take the life of a man, he might just as\r\nfairly insist that we are in favor of having every man on earth put to\r\ndeath! Was any fallacy ever more glaring? was any misrepresentation ever\r\nmore flagrant?\r\n\r\nIndeed we should have supposed that Dr. Wayland might have seen that his\r\nrepresentation is not a fair one, if he had not assured us of the\r\ncontrary. We should have supposed that he might have distinguished\r\nbetween an argument in favor of slavery for the lowest grade of the\r\nignorant and debased, and an argument in favor of slavery for all men\r\nand all times, if he had not assured us that he possesses no capacity to\r\nmake it. For after having twisted the plea of the most enlightened\r\nstatesmen of the South into an argument in favor of the universal\r\nsubjection of mankind to slavery, he coolly adds, \"I believe that in\r\nthese words I express the argument correctly. If I do not, it is solely\r\nbecause I do not know how to state it more correctly.\" Is it possible\r\nDr. Wayland could not distinguish between the principle of slavery for\r\nsome men and the principle of slavery for all men? between the\r\nproposition that the ignorant, the idle, and the debased may be\r\nsubjected to servitude, and the idea that all men, even the most\r\nenlightened and free, may be reduced to bondage? If he had not\r\npositively declared that he possessed no such capacity, we should most\r\ncertainly have entertained a different opinion.\r\n\r\nIt will not be denied, we presume, that the very best men, whose lives\r\nare recorded in the Old Testament, were the owners and holders of\r\nslaves. \"I grant at once,\" says Dr. Wayland, \"that the Hebrews held\r\nslaves from the time of the conquest of Canaan, and that Abraham and the\r\npatriarchs held them many centuries before. I grant also that Moses\r\nenacted laws with special reference to that relation. . . . . I wonder\r\nthat any should have had the hardihood to deny so plain a matter of\r\nrecord. I should almost as soon deny the delivery of the ten\r\ncommandments to Moses.\"\r\n\r\nNow, is it not wonderful that directly in the face of \"so plain a matter\r\nof record,\" a pious Presbyterian pastor should have been arraigned by\r\nabolitionists, not for holding slaves, but for daring to be so far a\r\nfreeman as to express his convictions on the subject of slavery? Most\r\nabolitionists must have found themselves a little embarrassed in such a\r\nproceeding. For _there_ was the fact, staring them in the face, that\r\nAbraham himself, \"the friend of God\" and the \"father of the faithful,\"\r\nwas the owner and holder of more than a thousand slaves. How, then,\r\ncould these professing Christians proceed to condemn and excommunicate a\r\npoor brother for having merely approved what Abraham had practiced? Of\r\nall the good men of old, Abraham was the most eminent. The sublimity of\r\nhis faith and the fervor of his piety has, by the unerring voice of\r\ninspiration itself, been held up as a model for the imitation of all\r\nfuture ages. How, then, could a parcel of poor common saints presume,\r\nwithout blushing, to cry and condemn one of their number because he was\r\nno better than \"Father Abraham?\" This was the difficulty; and, but for a\r\nvery happy discovery, it must have been an exceedingly perplexing one.\r\nBut \"Necessity is the mother of invention.\" On this trying occasion she\r\nconceived the happy thought that the plain matter of record \"was all a\r\nmistake;\" that Abraham never owned a slave; that, on the contrary, he\r\nwas \"a prince,\" and the \"men whom he bought with his money\" were \"his\r\nsubjects\" merely! If, then, we poor sinners of the South should be\r\ndriven to the utmost extremity,--all honest arguments and pleas failing\r\nus,--may we not escape the unutterable horrors of civil war, by calling\r\nour masters princes, and our slaves subjects?\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this topic with the pointed and powerful words of Dr.\r\nFuller, in his reply to Dr. Wayland: \"Abraham,\" says he, \"was 'the\r\nfriend of God,' and walked with God in the closest and most endearing\r\nintercourse; nor can any thing be more exquisitely touching than those\r\nwords, 'Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?' It is the\r\nlanguage of a friend who feels that concealment would wrong the\r\nconfidential intimacy existing. The love of this venerable servant of\r\nGod in his promptness to immolate his son has been the theme of apostles\r\nand preachers for ages; and such was his faith, that all who believe are\r\ncalled 'the children of faithful Abraham.' This Abraham, you admit, held\r\nslaves. Who is surprised that Whitefield, with this single fact before\r\nhim, could not believe slavery to be a sin? Yet if your definition of\r\nslavery be correct, holy Abraham lived all his life in the commission of\r\none of the most aggravated crimes against God and man which can be\r\nconceived. His life was spent in outraging the rights of hundreds of\r\nhuman beings, as moral, intellectual, immortal, fallen creatures, and in\r\nviolating their relations as parents and children, and husbands and\r\nwives. And God not only connived at this appalling iniquity, but, in the\r\ncovenant of circumcision made with Abraham, expressly mentions it, and\r\nconfirms the patriarch in it, speaking of those 'bought with his money,'\r\nand requiring him to circumcise them. Why, at the very first blush,\r\nevery Christian will cry out against this statement. To this, however,\r\nyou must come, or yield your position; and this is only the first\r\nutterly incredible and monstrous corollary involved in the assertion\r\nthat slavery is essentially and always 'a sin of appalling magnitude.'\"\r\n\r\nSlavery among the Hebrews, however, was not left merely to a tacit or\r\nimplied sanction. It was thus sanctioned by the express legislation of\r\nthe Most High: \"Both thy bondmen and thy bond-maids, which thou shalt\r\nhave, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye\r\nbuy bondmen and bond-maids. Moreover, of the children of the strangers\r\nthat do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families\r\nthat are with you, which they begat in your land; and they shall be your\r\npossession. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children\r\nafter you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen\r\nforever.\"[163] Now these words are so perfectly explicit, that there is\r\nno getting around them. Even Dr. Wayland, as we have seen, admits that\r\nthe authority to take slaves _seems_ to be a part of \"this original,\r\npeculiar,\" and perhaps \"anomalous grant.\" No wonder it appeared\r\n_peculiar_ and _anomalous_. The only wonder is, that it did not appear\r\nimpious and absurd. So it has appeared to some of his co-agitators, who,\r\nbecause they could not agree with Moses, have denied his mission as an\r\ninspired teacher, and joined the ranks of infidelity.\r\n\r\nDr. Channing makes very light of this and other passages of Scripture.\r\nHe sets aside this whole argument from revelation with a few bold\r\nstrokes of the pen. \"In this age of the world,\" says he, \"and amid the\r\nlight which has been thrown on the true interpretation of the\r\nScriptures, such reasoning hardly deserves notice.\" Now, even if not for\r\nour benefit, we think there are two reasons why such passages as the\r\nabove were worthy of Dr. Channing's notice. In the first place, if he\r\nhad condescended to throw the light in his possession on such passages,\r\nhe might have saved Dr. Wayland, as well as other of his admirers, from\r\nthe necessity of making the very awkward admission that the Almighty had\r\nauthorized his chosen people to buy slaves, and hold them as \"bondmen\r\nforever.\" He might have enabled them to see through the great\r\ndifficulty, that God has authorized his people to commit \"a sin of\r\napalling magnitude,\" to perpetrate as \"great a crime as can be\r\nconceived;\" which seems so clearly to be the case, if their views of\r\nslavery be correct. Secondly, he might have enabled his followers to\r\nespouse the cause of abolition without deserting, as so many of them\r\nhave openly done, the armies of the living God. For these two reasons,\r\nif for no other, we think Dr. Channing owed it to the honor of his cause\r\nto notice the passages of Scripture bearing on the subject of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic Institutes not only recognize slavery as lawful; they contain\r\na multitude of minute directions for its regulation. We need not refer\r\nto all of them; it will be sufficient for our purpose if we only notice\r\nthose which establish some of the leading characteristics of slavery\r\namong the people of God.\r\n\r\n1. Slaves were regarded as property. They were, as we have seen, called\r\na \"possession\" and an \"inheritance.\"[164] They were even called the\r\n\"money\" of the master. Thus, it is said, \"if a man smite his servant or\r\nhis maid with a rod, and he die under his hand, he shall surely be\r\npunished. Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be\r\npunished, for he is his money.\"[165] In one of the ten commandments this\r\nright of property is recognized: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's\r\nhouse, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor _his_ man-servant,\r\nnor _his_ maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is\r\nthy neighbor's.\"\r\n\r\n2. They might be sold. This is taken for granted in all those passages\r\nin which, for particular reasons, the master is forbidden to sell his\r\nslaves. Thus it is declared: \"Thou shalt not make merchandise of her,\r\nbecause thou hast humbled her.\" And still more explicitly: \"If a man\r\nsell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the\r\nmen-servants do. If she please not her master who hath betrothed her to\r\nhimself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange\r\nnation, he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with\r\nher.[166]\r\n\r\n3. The slavery thus expressly sanctioned was hereditary and perpetual:\r\n\"Ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to\r\ninherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen forever.\" Even\r\nthe Hebrew servant might, by his own consent, become in certain cases a\r\nslave for life: \"If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve;\r\nand in the seventh shall he go out free for nothing. If he came in by\r\nhimself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife\r\nshall go out with him. If his master have given him a wife, and she have\r\nborne him sons or daughters, the wife and the children shall be her\r\nmaster's, and he shall go out by himself. And if the servant shall\r\nplainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go\r\nout free: then his master shall bring him unto the judges: he shall also\r\nbring him to the door or unto the door-post, and his master shall bore\r\nhis ear through with an awl, and _he shall serve him forever_.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is evident, we think, that the legislator of the Hebrews was not\r\ninspired with the sentiments of an abolitionist. The principles of his\r\nlegislation are, indeed, so diametrically opposed to the political\r\nnotions of the abolitionist, that the latter is sadly perplexed to\r\ndispose of them. While some deny the authority of these principles\r\naltogether, and of the very book which contains them, others are\r\ncontent to evade their force by certain ingenious devices of their own.\r\nWe shall now proceed to examine some of the more remarkable of these\r\ncunningly-devised fables.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted by the inventors of these devices, that God expressly\r\npermitted his chosen people to buy and hold slaves. Yet Dr. Wayland, by\r\nwhom this admission is made, has endeavored to weaken the force of it by\r\nalleging that God has been pleased to enlighten our race progressively.\r\nIf, he argues, the institution of slavery among His people appears so\r\nvery \"peculiar and anomalous,\" this is because he did not choose to make\r\nknown his whole mind on the subject. He withheld a portion of it from\r\nhis people, and allowed them, by express grant, to hold slaves until the\r\nfuller revelation of his will should blaze upon the world. Such is,\r\nperhaps, the most plausible defense which an abolitionist could possibly\r\nset up against the light of revelation.\r\n\r\nBut to what does it amount? If the views of Dr. Wayland and his\r\nfollowers, respecting slavery, be correct, it amounts to this: The\r\nAlmighty has said to his people, you may commit \"a sin of appalling\r\nmagnitude;\" you may perpetrate \"as great an evil as can be conceived;\"\r\nyou may persist in a practice which consists in \"outraging the rights\"\r\nof your fellow-men, and in \"crushing their intellectual and moral\"\r\nnature. They have a natural, inherent, and inalienable right to liberty\r\nas well as yourselves, but yet you may make slaves of them, and they may\r\nbe your bondmen forever. In one word, _you_, my chosen people, may\r\ndegrade \"rational, accountable, and immortal beings\" to the \"rank of\r\nbrutes.\" Such, if we may believe Dr. Wayland, is the first stage in the\r\ndivine enlightenment of the human race! It consists in making known a\r\npart of God's mind, not against the monstrous iniquity of slavery, but\r\nin its favor! It is the utterance, not of a partial truth, but of a\r\nmonstrous falsehood! It is the revelation of his will, not against sin,\r\nbut in favor of as great a sin \"as can be conceived.\" Now, we may\r\nfearlessly ask if the cause which is reduced to the necessity of\r\nresorting to such a defense may not be pronounced desperate indeed, and\r\nunspeakably forlorn?\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that polygamy and divorce, as well as slavery, are\r\npermitted and regulated in the Old Testament. This, we reply, proves, in\r\nregard to polygamy and divorce, exactly what it proves in regard to\r\nslavery,--namely, that neither is in itself sinful, that neither is\r\n_always_ and _everywhere_ sinful. In other words, it proves that\r\nneither polygamy nor divorce, as permitted in the Old Testament, is\r\n\"_malum in se_,\" is inconsistent with the eternal and unchangeable\r\nprinciples of right. They are forbidden in the New Testament, not\r\nbecause they are in themselves absolutely and immutably wrong, but\r\nbecause they are inconsistent with the best interests of society;\r\nespecially in civilized and Christian communities. If they had been\r\nwrong in themselves, they never could have been permitted by a holy God,\r\nwho is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, except with inifinite\r\nabhorrence.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is contended by Dr. Wayland that \"Moses intended to abolish\r\nslavery,\" because he forbade the Jews \"to deliver up a fugitive slave.\"\r\nThe words are these: \"Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant\r\nthat is escaped from his master unto thee: \"He shall dwell with thee,\r\neven among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of the gates\r\nwhere it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.\"[167] \"This\r\nprecept, I think,\" says Dr. Wayland, \"clearly shows that Moses intended\r\nto abolish slavery. How could slavery long continue in a country where\r\nevery one was forbidden to deliver up a fugitive slave? How different\r\nwould be the condition of slaves, and how soon would slavery itself\r\ncease, were this the law of compulsory bondage among us!\"\r\n\r\nThe above passage of Scripture is a precious morsel with those who are\r\nopposed to a fugitive slave law. A petition from Albany, New York, from\r\nthe enlightened seat of empire of the Empire State itself, signed, if we\r\nrecollect right, by one hundred and fifty persons, was presented to the\r\nUnited States Senate by Mr. Seward, praying that no bill in relation to\r\nfugitive slaves might be passed, which should not contain that passage.\r\nWhether Mr. Seward was enlightened by his constituents, or whether he\r\nmade the discovery for himself, it is certain that he holds an act for\r\nthe reclamation of fugitive slaves to be \"contrary to the divine law.\"\r\nIt is certain that he agrees with his constituents, who, in the petition\r\nreferred to, pronounced every such act \"immoral,\" and contrary to the\r\nlaw of God. But let us look at this passage a little, and see if these\r\nabolitionists, who thus plant themselves so confidently upon \"a higher\r\nlaw,\" even upon \"the divine law\" itself, be not as hasty and rash in\r\ntheir interpretation of this law as they are accustomed to be in their\r\njudgment respecting the most universal and long-established institutions\r\nof human society.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if their interpretation be correct, we are at once\r\nmet by a very serious difficulty. For we are required to believe that\r\none passage of Scripture grants an \"authority to take slaves,\" while\r\nanother passage is designed to annul this authority. We are required to\r\nbelieve that, in one portion of the divine law, the right of the master\r\nto hold his slaves as \"bondmen\" is recognized, while another part of the\r\nsame law denies the existence of such right. In fine, we are required to\r\nbelieve that the legislator of the Jews intended, in one and the same\r\ncode, both to establish and to abolish slavery; that with one hand he\r\nstruck down the very right and institution which he had set up with the\r\nother. How Dr. Channing and Mr. Sumner would have disposed of this\r\ndifficulty we know full well, for they carry within their own bosoms a\r\nhigher law than this higher law itself. But how Dr. Wayland, as an\r\nenlightened member of the good old orthodox Baptist Church, with whom\r\nthe Scripture is really and in truth the inspired word of God, would\r\nhave disposed of it, we are at some loss to conceive.\r\n\r\nWe labor under no such difficulty. The words in question do not relate\r\nto slaves owned by Hebrew masters. They relate to those slaves only who\r\nshould escape from heathen masters, and seek an asylum among the people\r\nof God. \"The first inquiry of course is,\" says a learned divine,[168]\r\n\"in regard to those very words, 'Where does his master live?' Among the\r\nHebrews, or among foreigners? The language of the passage fully develops\r\nthis and answers the question. 'He has escaped from his master unto the\r\nHebrews; (the text says--_thee_, _i. e._ Israel;) _he shall dwell with\r\nthee, even among you . . . in one of thy gates_.' Of course, then, he is\r\nan _immigrant_, and did _not dwell among them_ before his flight. If he\r\nhad been a Hebrew servant, belonging to a Hebrew, the whole face of the\r\nthing would be changed. Restoration, or restitution, if we may judge by\r\nthe tenor of other property-laws among the Hebrews, would have surely\r\nbeen enjoined. But, be that as it may, the language of the text puts it\r\nbeyond a doubt that the servant is a _foreigner_, and has fled from a\r\n_heathen master_. This entirely changes the complexion of the case. The\r\nHebrews were God's chosen people, and were the only nation on earth\r\nwhich worshiped the only living and true God. . . . . In case a slave\r\nescaped from them (the heathen) and came to the Hebrews, two things were\r\nto be taken into consideration, according to the views of the Jewish\r\nlegislator. The first was that the treatment of slaves among the heathen\r\nwas far more severe and rigorous than it could lawfully be under the\r\nMosaic law. The heathen master possessed the power of life and death, of\r\nscourging or imprisoning, or putting to excessive toil, even to any\r\nextent that he pleased. Not so among the Hebrews. _Humanity_ pleaded\r\nthere for the protection of the fugitive. The second and most important\r\nconsideration was, that only among the Hebrews could the fugitive slave\r\ncome to the knowledge and worship of the only living and true God.\"\r\n\r\nNow this view of the passage in question harmonizes one portion of\r\nScripture with another, and removes every difficulty. It shows, too, how\r\ngreatly the abolitionists have deceived themselves in their rash and\r\nblind appeal to \"the divine law\" in question. \"The reason of the law,\"\r\nsays my Lord Coke, \"is the law.\" It is applicable to those cases, and to\r\nthose cases only, which come within the reason of the law. Hence, if it\r\nbe a fact, and if our Northern brethren really believe that we are sunk\r\nin the darkness of heathen idolatry, while the light of the true\r\nreligion is with them alone, why, then, we admit that the reason and\r\nprinciple of the divine law in question is in their favor. Then we admit\r\nthat the return of our fugitive slaves is \"contrary to the divine law.\"\r\nBut if we are not heathen idolaters, if the God of the Hebrews be also\r\nthe God of Southern masters, then the Northern States do not violate the\r\nprecept in question--they only discharge a solemn constitutional\r\nobligation--in delivering up our \"fugitives from labor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II. _The argument from the New Testament._\r\n\r\nThe New Testament, as Dr. Wayland remarks, was given, \"not to one\r\npeople, but to the whole race; not for one period, but for all time.\"\r\nIts lessons are, therefore, of universal and perpetual obligation. If,\r\nthen, the Almighty had undertaken to enlighten the human race by\r\ndegrees, with respect to the great sin of slavery, is it not wonderful\r\nthat, in the very last revelation of his will, he has uttered not a\r\nsingle syllable in disapprobation thereof? Is it not wonderful, that he\r\nshould have completed the revelation of his will,--that he should have\r\nset his seal to the last word he will ever say to man respecting his\r\nduties, and yet not one word about the great obligation of the master to\r\nemancipate his slaves, nor about the \"appalling sin\" of slavery? Such\r\nsilence must, indeed, appear exceedingly peculiar and anomalous to the\r\nabolitionist. It would have been otherwise had he written the New\r\nTestament. He would, no doubt, have inserted at least one little precept\r\nagainst the sin of slavery.\r\n\r\nAs it is, however, the most profound silence reigns through the whole\r\nword of God with respect to the sinfulness of slavery. \"It must be\r\ngranted,\" says Dr. Wayland, \"that the New Testament contains no\r\n_precept_ prohibitory of slavery.\" Marvellous as such silence must needs\r\nbe to the abolitionist, it cannot be more so to him than his attempts to\r\naccount for it are to others. Let us briefly examine these attempts:\r\n\r\n\"You may give your child,\" says Dr. Wayland, \"if he were approaching to\r\nyears of discretion, permission to do an act, while you inculcate upon\r\nhim principles which forbid it, for the sake of teaching him to be\r\ngoverned by principles, rather than by any direct enactment. In such\r\ncase you would expect him to obey the principle, and not avail himself\r\nof the permission.\" Now we fearlessly ask every reader whose moral sense\r\nhas not been perverted by false logic, if such a proceeding would not be\r\ninfinitely unworthy of the Father of mercies? According to Dr. Wayland's\r\nview, he beholds his children living and dying in the practice of an\r\nabominable sin, and looks on without the slightest note of admonition or\r\nwarning. Nay, he gives them permission to continue in the practice of\r\nthis frightful enormity, to which they are already bound by the triple\r\ntie of habit, interest, and feeling! Though he gives them line upon\r\nline, and precept upon precept, in order to detach them from other sins,\r\nhe yet gives them permission to live and die in this awful sin! And why?\r\nTo teach them, forsooth, not to follow his permission, but to be guided\r\nby his principles! Even the guilty Eli remonstrated with his sons. Yet\r\nif, instead of doing this, he had given them permission to practice the\r\nvery sins they were bent upon, he might have been, for all that, as pure\r\nand faithful as the Father of mercies himself is represented to be in\r\nthe writings of Dr. Wayland. Such are the miserable straits, and such\r\nthe impious sophisms, to which even divines are reduced, when, on the\r\nsupposition that slavery is a sin, they undertake to vindicate or defend\r\nthe word which they themselves are ordained to preach!\r\n\r\nAnother reason, scarcely less remarkable than the one already noticed,\r\nis assigned for the omission of all precepts against slavery. \"It was no\r\npart of the scheme of the gospel revelation,\" we are told by Dr.\r\nWayland, (who quotes from Archbishop Whately,) \"to lay down any thing\r\napproaching to a complete system of _moral precepts_--to enumerate every\r\nthing that is _enjoined_ or _forbidden_ by our religion.\" If this method\r\nof teaching had been adopted, \"the New Testament would,\" says Dr.\r\nWayland, \"have formed a library in itself, more voluminous than the laws\r\nof the realm of Great Britain.\" Now, all this is very true; and hence\r\nthe necessity of leaving many points of duty to the enlightened\r\nconscience, and to the application of the more general precepts of the\r\ngospel. But how has it happened that slavery is passed over in silence?\r\nBecause, we are told; \"every thing\" could not be noticed. If, indeed,\r\nslavery be so great a sin, would it not have been easier for the divine\r\nteacher to say, Let it be abolished, than to lay down so many minute\r\nprecepts for its regulation? Would this have tended to swell the gospel\r\ninto a vast library, or to abridge its teachings? Surely, when Dr.\r\nWayland sets up such a plea, he must have forgotten that the New\r\nTestament, though it cannot notice \"every thing,\" contains a multitude\r\nof rules to regulate the conduct of the master and the slave. Otherwise\r\nhe could scarcely have imagined that it was from an aversion to\r\nminuteness, or from an impossibility to forbid every evil, that the sin\r\nof slavery is passed over in silence.\r\n\r\nHe must also have forgotten another thing. He must have forgotten the\r\ncolors in which he had painted the evils of slavery. If we may rely upon\r\nthese, then slavery is no trifling offense. It is, on the contrary, a\r\nstupendous sin, overspreading the earth, and crushing the\r\nfaculties--both intellectual and moral--of millions of human beings\r\nbeneath its odious and terrific influence. Now, if this be so, then\r\nwould it have been too much to expect that at least one little word\r\nmight have been directed against so great, so tremendous an evil? The\r\nmethod of the gospel may be comprehensive, if you please; it may teach\r\nby great principles rather than by minute precepts. Still, it is\r\ncertain that St. Paul could give directions about his cloak; and he\r\ncould spend many words in private salutations. In regard to the great\r\nsocial evil of the age, however, and beneath which a large majority of\r\neven the civilized world were crushed to the earth, he said nothing,\r\nlest he should become too minute,--lest his epistles should swell into\r\ntoo large a volume! Such is one of Dr. Wayland's defences of the gospel.\r\nWe shall offer no remark; we shall let it speak for itself.\r\n\r\nA third reason for the silence in question is the alleged ease with\r\nwhich precepts may be evaded. \"A simple precept or prohibition,\" says\r\nDr. Wayland, \"is, of all things, the easiest to be evaded. Lord Eldon\r\nused to say, that 'no man in England could construct an act of\r\nParliament through which he could not drive a coach-and-four.' We find\r\nthis to have been illustrated by the case of the Jews in the time of our\r\nSaviour. The Pharisees, who prided themselves on their strict obedience\r\nto the _letter_, violated the _spirit_ of every precept of the Mosaic\r\ncode.\"\r\n\r\nNow, in reply to this most extraordinary passage, we have several\r\nremarks to offer. In the first place, perhaps every one is not so good a\r\ndriver as Lord Eldon. It is certain, that acts of Parliament have been\r\npassed, through which the most slippery of rogues have not been able to\r\nmake their escape. They have been caught, tried, and condemned for their\r\noffenses, in spite of all their ingenuity and evasion.\r\n\r\nSecondly, a \"principle\" is just as easily evaded as a \"precept;\" and, in\r\nmost cases, it is far more so. The great principle of the New Testament,\r\nwhich our author deems so applicable to the subject of slavery, is this:\r\n\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" Now, if this be the great\r\nprinciple intended to enlighten us respecting the sin of slavery, we\r\nconfess it has been most completely evaded by every slave State in the\r\nUnion. We have, indeed, so entirely deceived ourselves in regard to its\r\ntrue import, that it seems to us to have not the most remote application\r\nto such a subject. If any one will give our remarks on this great\r\n\"principle\" a candid examination, we think he will admit that we have\r\ndeceived ourselves on very plausible, if not on unanswerable, grounds.\r\nIf slavery be a sin,--_always and everywhere_ a monstrous\r\niniquity,--then we should have been far more thoroughly enlightened with\r\nrespect to its true nature, and found evasion far more difficult, if\r\nthe New Testament had explicitly declared it to be such, and commanded\r\nall masters everywhere to emancipate their slaves. We could have driven\r\na coach-and-four neither through, nor around, any such express\r\nprohibition. It is indeed only in consequence of the default, or\r\nomission, of such precept or command, that the abolitionist appeals to\r\nwhat he calls the principles of the gospel. If he had only one such\r\nprecept,--if he had only one such precise and pointed prohibition, he\r\nmight then, and he _would_, most triumphantly defy evasion. He would\r\nsay, There is _the word_; and none but the obstinate gainsayers, or\r\nunbelievers, would dare reply. But as it is, he is compelled to lose\r\nhimself in vague generalities, and pretend to a certainty which nowhere\r\nexists, except in his own heated mind. This pretense, indeed, that an\r\nexpress precept, prohibitory of slavery, is not the most direct way to\r\nreveal its true nature, because a precept is so much more easily evaded\r\nthan a principle, is merely one of the desperate expedients of a forlorn\r\nand hopeless cause. If the abolitionist would maintain that cause, or\r\nvindicate his principles, it will be found that he must retire, and hide\r\nhimself from the light of revelation.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the above passage seems to present a very strange view of the\r\nDivine proceedings. According to that view, it appears that the Almighty\r\ntried the method of teaching by precept in the Old Testament, and the\r\nexperiment failed. For precepts may be so easily evaded, that every one\r\nin the Mosaic code was violated by the Pharisees. Hence, the method of\r\nteaching by precept was laid aside in the New Testament, and the better\r\nmethod of teaching by principle was adopted. Such is the conclusion to\r\nwhich we must come, if we adopt the reasoning of Dr. Wayland. But we\r\ncannot adopt his reasoning; since we should then have to believe that\r\nthe experiment made in the Old Testament proved a failure, and that its\r\nDivine Author, having grown wiser by experience, improved upon his\r\nformer method.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the method of the one Testament is the same as that\r\nof the other. In both, the method of teaching by precept is adopted; by\r\nprecepts of greater and of lesser generality. Dr. Wayland's principle is\r\nmerely a general or comprehensive precept; and his precept is merely a\r\nspecific or limited principle. The distinction he makes between them,\r\nand the use he makes of this distinction, only reflect discredit upon\r\nthe wisdom and consistency of the Divine Author of revelation.\r\n\r\nA third account which Dr. Wayland gives of the silence of the New\r\nTestament respecting the sin of slavery, is as follows: \"If this form of\r\nwrong had been singled out from all the others, and had alone been\r\ntreated preceptively, the whole system would have been vitiated. We\r\nshould have been authorized to inquire why were not similar precepts in\r\nother cases delivered? and if they were not delivered, we should have\r\nbeen at liberty to conclude that they were intentionally omitted, and\r\nthat the acts which they would have forbidden are innocent.\" Very well.\r\nBut idolatry, polygamy, divorce, is each and every one singled out, and\r\nforbidden by precept, in the New Testament. Slavery alone is passed over\r\nin silence. Hence, according to the principle of Dr. Wayland himself, we\r\nare at liberty to conclude that a precept forbidding slavery was\r\n\"intentionally omitted,\" and that slavery itself \"is innocent.\"\r\n\r\nEach one of these reasons is not only exceedingly weak in itself, but it\r\nis inconsistent with the others. For if a precept forbidding slavery\r\nwere purposely omitted, in order to teach mankind to be governed by\r\nprinciple and to disregard permissions, then the omission could not have\r\narisen from a love of brevity. Were it not, indeed, just as easy to give\r\na precept forbidding, as to give one permitting, the existence of\r\nslavery? Again, if a great and world-devouring sin, such as the\r\nabolitionists hold slavery to be, has been left unnoticed, lest its\r\ncondemnation should impliedly sanction other sins, then is it not worse\r\nthan puerile to suppose that the omission was made for the sake of\r\nbrevity, or to teach mankind that the permissions of the Most High may\r\nin certain cases be treated with contempt, may be set at naught, and\r\ndespised as utterly inconsistent, as diametrically opposed to the\r\nprinciples and purity of his law?\r\n\r\nIf the abolitionist is so completely lost in his attempts to meet the\r\nargument from the silence of Scripture, he finds it still more difficult\r\nto cope with that from its express precepts and injunctions. _Servants,\r\nobey your masters_, is one of the most explicit precepts of the New\r\nTestament. This precept just as certainly exists therein as does the\r\ngreat principle of love itself. \"The obedience thus enjoined is placed,\"\r\nsays Dr. Wayland, \"not on the ground of duty to man, but on the ground\r\nof duty to God.\" We accept the interpretation. It cannot for one moment\r\ndisturb the line of our argument. It is merely the shadow of an attempt\r\nat an evasion. All the obligations of the New Testament are, indeed,\r\nplaced on the same high ground. The obligation of the slave to obey his\r\nmaster could be placed upon no higher, no more sacred, no more\r\nimpregnable, ground.\r\n\r\nRights and obligations are correlative. That is, every right implies a\r\ncorresponding obligation, and every obligation implies a corresponding\r\nright. Hence, as the slave is under an obligation to obey the master, so\r\nthe master has a right to his obedience. Nor is this obligation\r\nweakened, or this right disturbed, by the fact that the first is imposed\r\nby the word of God, and rests on the immutable ground of duty to him.\r\nIf, by the divine law, the obedience of the slave is due to the master,\r\nthen, by the same law, the master has a right to his obedience.\r\n\r\nMost assuredly, the master is neither \"a robber,\" nor \"a murderer,\" nor\r\n\"a manstealer,\" merely because he claims of the slave that which God\r\nhimself commands the slave to render. All these epithets may be, as they\r\nhave been, hurled at us by the abolitionist. His anathemas may thunder.\r\nBut it is some consolation to reflect, that, as he was not consulted in\r\nthe construction of the moral code of the universe, so, it is to be\r\nhoped, he will not be called upon to take part in its execution.\r\n\r\nThe most enlightened abolitionists are sadly puzzled by the precept in\r\nquestion; and, from the manner in which they sometimes speak of it, we\r\nhave reason to fear it holds no very high place in their respect. Thus,\r\nsays the Hon. Charles Sumner, \"Seeking to be brief, I shall not\r\nundertake to reconcile texts of the Old Testament, which, whatever may\r\nbe their import, are all absorbed in the New; nor shall I stop to\r\nconsider the precise interpretation of the oft-quoted phrase, _Servants,\r\nobey your masters_; nor seek to weigh any such imperfect injunction in\r\nthe scales against those grand commandments on which hang all the law\r\nand the prophets.\"[169] Now this is a very significant passage. The\r\norator, its learned author, will not stop to consider the texts of the\r\nOld Testament bearing on the subject of slavery, because they are all\r\nmerged in the New! Nor will he stop to consider any \"such _imperfect\r\ninjunction_\" as those contained in the New, because they are all\r\nswallowed up and lost in the grand commandment, \"Thou shalt love thy\r\nneighbor as thyself!\"\r\n\r\nIf he had bestowed a little more attention on this grand commandment\r\nitself, he might have seen, as we have shown, that it in no wise\r\nconflicts with the precept which enjoins servants to obey their masters.\r\nHe might have seen that it is not at all necessary to \"weigh\" the one of\r\nthose precepts \"in the scales against\" the other, or to brand either of\r\nthem as imperfect. For he might have seen a perfect harmony between\r\nthem. It is no matter of surprise, however, that an abolitionist should\r\nfind imperfections in the moral code of the New Testament.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly no wonder that Mr. Sumner should have seen imperfections\r\ntherein. For he has, in direct opposition to the plainest terms of the\r\ngospel, discovered that it is the first duty of the slave to fly from\r\nhis master. In his speech delivered in the Senate of the United States,\r\nwe find among various other quotations, a verse from Sarah W. Morton, in\r\nwhich she exhorts the slave to fly from bondage. Having produced this\r\nquotation \"as part of the testimony of the times,\" and pronounced it \"a\r\ntruthful homage to the inalienable rights\" of the slave, Mr. Sumner was\r\nin no mood to appreciate the divine precept, \"Servants, obey your\r\nmasters.\" Having declared fugitive slaves to be \"the heroes of the age,\"\r\nhe had not, as we may suppose, any very decided taste for the\r\ncommonplace Scriptural duties of submission and obedience. Nay, he\r\nspurns at and rejects such duties as utterly inconsistent with the\r\n\"inalienable rights of man.\" He appeals from the oracles of eternal\r\ntruth to \"the testimony of the times.\" He appeals from Christ and his\r\napostles to Sarah W. Morton. And yet, although he thus takes ground\r\ndirectly against the plainest precepts of the gospel, and even ventures\r\nto brand some of them as \"imperfect,\" he has the hardihood to rebuke\r\nthose who find therein, not what it really contains, but only a\r\nreflection of themselves!\r\n\r\nThe precept in question is not an isolated injunction of the New\r\nTestament. It does not stand alone. It is surrounded by other\r\ninjunctions, equally authoritative, equally explicit, equally\r\nunequivocal. Thus, in Eph. vi. 5: \"Servants, be obedient to them that\r\nare your masters according to the flesh.\" Precisely the same doctrine\r\nwas preached to the Colossians: (iii. 22:) \"Servants, obey in all\r\nthings your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as\r\nmen-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.\" Again, in St.\r\nPaul's Epistle to Timothy, he writes: \"Let as many servants as are under\r\nthe yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of\r\nGod and his doctrine be not blasphemed.\" Likewise, in Tit. ii. 9, 10, we\r\nread: \"Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to\r\nplease them well in all things; not answering again; not purloining, but\r\nshowing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our\r\nSaviour in all things.\" And in 1 Pet. ii. 18, it is written: \"Servants,\r\nbe subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and\r\ngentle, but also to the froward.\" Yet, in the face of these passages,\r\nMr. Sumner declares that it is the duty of slaves to fly from bondage,\r\nand thereby place themselves among \"the heroes of the age.\" He does not\r\nattempt to interpret or explain these precepts; he merely sets them\r\naside, or passes them by with silent contempt, as \"imperfect.\" Indeed,\r\nif his doctrines be true, they are not only imperfect--they are\r\nradically wrong and infamously vicious. Thus, the issue which Mr. Sumner\r\nhas made up is not with the slaveholders of the South; it is with the\r\nword of God itself. The contradiction is direct, plain, palpable, and\r\nwithout even the decency of a pretended disguise. We shall leave Mr.\r\nSumner to settle this issue and controversy with the Divine Author of\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, we shall barely remind the reader of what that Divine\r\nAuthor has said in regard to those who counsel and advise slaves to\r\ndisobey their masters, or fly from bondage. \"They that have believing\r\nmasters,\" says the great Apostle to the Gentiles, \"let them not despise\r\nthem because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they\r\nare faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach\r\nand exhort. If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome\r\nwords, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine\r\nwhich is according to godliness, _he is proud, knowing nothing_.\" Mr.\r\nSumner congratulates himself that he has stripped \"from slavery the\r\napology of Christianity.\" Let servants \"count their own masters worthy\r\nof all honor,\" and \"do them service,\" says St. Paul. \"Let servants\r\ndisobey their masters,\" says Mr. Sumner, \"and cease to do them service.\"\r\n\"These things teach and exhort,\" says St. Paul. \"These things denounce\r\nand abhor,\" says Mr. Sumner. \"If any man teach otherwise,\" says St.\r\nPaul, \"he is proud, knowing nothing.\" \"I teach otherwise,\" says Mr.\r\nSumner. And is it by such conflict that he strips from slavery the\r\nsanction of Christianity? If the sheer _ipse dixit_ of Mr. Sumner be\r\nsufficient to annihilate the authority of the New Testament, which he\r\nprofesses to revere as divine, then, indeed, has he stripped the\r\nsanction of Christianity from the relation of master and slave.\r\nOtherwise, he has not even stripped from his own doctrines the burning\r\nwords of her condemnation.\r\n\r\nDr. Wayland avoids a direct conflict with the teachings of the gospel.\r\nHe is less bold, and more circumspect, than the Senator from\r\nMassachusetts. He has honestly and fairly quoted most of the texts\r\nbearing on the subject of slavery. He shows them no disrespect. He\r\npronounces none of them imperfect. But with this array of texts before\r\nhim he proceeds to say: \"Now, I do not see that the scope of these\r\npassages can be misunderstood.\" Nor can we. It would seem, indeed,\r\nimpossible for the ingenuity of man to misunderstand the words, quoted\r\nby Dr. Wayland himself, \"Servants, _obey_ in all things your masters\r\naccording to the flesh.\" Dr. Wayland does not misunderstand them. For he\r\nhas said, in his Moral Science: \"The _duty of slaves_ is explicitly made\r\nknown in the Bible. They are bound to obedience, fidelity, submission,\r\nand respect to their masters, not only to the good and kind, but also to\r\nthe unkind and froward.\" But when he comes to reason about these words,\r\nwhich he finds it so impossible for any one to misunderstand, he is not\r\nwithout a very ingenious method to evade their plain import and to\r\nescape from their influence. Let the reader hear, and determine for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"I do not see,\" says Dr. Wayland, \"that the scope of these passages can\r\nbe misunderstood. They teach patience, meekness, fidelity, and\r\ncharity--duties which are obligatory on Christians toward all men, and,\r\nof course, toward masters. These duties are obligatory on us toward\r\nenemies, because an enemy, like every other man, is a moral creature of\r\nGod.\" True. But is this all? Patience, meekness, fidelity,\r\ncharity--duties due to all men! But what has become of the word\r\n_obedience_? This occupies a prominent--nay, the most prominent--place\r\nin the teachings of St. Paul. It occupies no place at all in the\r\nreasonings of Dr. Wayland. It is simply dropped out by him, or\r\noverlooked; and this was well done, for this word _obedience_ is an\r\nexceedingly inconvenient one for the abolitionist. If Dr. Wayland had\r\nretained it in his argument, he could not have added, \"duties which are\r\nobligatory on Christians toward all men, and, of course, toward\r\nmasters.\" Christians are not bound to obey all men. But slaves are bound\r\nto obey \"their own masters.\" It is precisely upon this injunction to\r\nobedience that the whole argument turns. And it is precisely this\r\ninjunction to obedience which Dr. Wayland leaves out in his argument. He\r\ndoes not, and he cannot, misunderstand the word. But he can just drop it\r\nout, and, in consequence, proceed to argue as if nothing more were\r\nrequired of slaves than is required of all Christian men!\r\n\r\nThe only portion of Scripture which Mr. Sumner condescends to notice is\r\nthe Epistle of St. Paul to Philemon. He introduces the discussion of\r\nthis epistle with the remark that, \"In the support of slavery, it is the\r\nhabit to pervert texts and to invent authority. Even St. Paul is vouched\r\nfor a wrong which his Christian life rebukes.\"[170] Now we intend to\r\nexamine who it is that really perverts texts of Scripture, and invents\r\nauthority. We intend to show, as in the clear light of noonday, that it\r\nis the conduct of Mr. Sumner and other abolitionists, and not that of\r\nthe slaveholder, which is rebuked by the life and writings of the great\r\napostle.\r\n\r\nThe epistle in question was written to a slaveholder, who, if the\r\ndoctrine of Mr. Sumner be true, lived in the habitual practice of \"a\r\nwrong so transcendent, so loathsome, so direful,\" that it \"must be\r\nencountered _wherever it can be reached_, and the battle must be\r\ncontinued, without truce or compromise, until the field is entirely\r\nwon.\" Is there any thing like this in the Epistle to Philemon? Is there\r\nany thing like it in any of the epistles of St. Paul? Is there anywhere\r\nin his writings the slightest hint that slavery is a sin at all, or that\r\nthe act of holding slaves is in the least degree inconsistent with the\r\nmost exalted Christian purity of life? We may safely answer these\r\nquestions in the negative. The very epistle before us is from \"Paul, a\r\nprisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon, _our\r\ndearly-beloved, and fellow-laborer_.\" The inspired writer then proceeds\r\nin these words: \"I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my\r\nprayers. Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord\r\nJesus, and toward all saints; that the communication of thy faith may\r\nbecome effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in\r\nyou in Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love,\r\nbecause the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.\"\r\n\r\nNow if, instead of leaving out this portion of the epistle, Mr. Sumner\r\nhad pronounced it in the hearing of his audience, the suspicion might\r\nhave arisen in some of their minds that the slaveholder may not, after\r\nall, be so vile a wretch. It might even have occurred to some, perhaps,\r\nthat the Christian character of Philemon, the slaveholder, might\r\npossibly have been as good as that of those by whom all slaveholders are\r\nexcommunicated and consigned to perdition. It might have been supposed\r\nthat a Christian man may possibly hold slaves without being as bad as\r\nrobbers, or cut-throats, or murderers. We do not say that Mr. Sumner\r\nshrunk from the reading of this portion of the epistle in the hearing of\r\nhis audience, lest it should seem to rebuke the violence and the\r\nuncharitableness of his own sentiments, as well as those of his brother\r\nabolitionists at the North. We do say, however, that Mr. Sumner had no\r\nsort of use for this passage. It could in no way favor the impression\r\nhis oration was designed to make. It breathes, indeed, a spirit of\r\ngood-will toward the Christian master as different from that which\r\npervades the speeches of the honorable Senator, as the pure charity of\r\nHeaven is from the dire malignity of earth.\r\n\r\n\"It might be shown,\" says Mr. Sumner, \"that the present epistle, when\r\ntruly interpreted, is a protest against slavery, and a voice for\r\nfreedom.\" If, instead of merely asserting that this \"might be done,\" the\r\naccomplished orator had actually done it, he would have achieved far\r\nmore for the cause of abolitionism than has been effected by all the\r\nsplendors of his showy rhetoric. He has, indeed, as we shall presently\r\nsee, made some attempt to show that the Epistle to Philemon is an\r\nemancipation document. When we come to examine this most extraordinary\r\nattempt, we shall perceive that Mr. Sumner's power \"to pervert texts and\r\nto invent authority,\" has not been wholly held in reserve for what\r\n\"might be done.\" If his view of this portion of Scripture be not very\r\nprofound, it certainly makes up in originality what it lacks in depth.\r\nIf it should fail to instruct, it will at least amuse the reader. It\r\nshall be noticed in due time.\r\n\r\nThe next point that claims our attention is the intimation that St.\r\nPaul's \"real judgment of slavery\" may be inferred \"from his\r\ncondemnation, on another occasion, of 'manstealers,' or, according to\r\nthe original text, slave-traders, in company with murderers of fathers\r\nand murderers of mothers.\" Were we disposed to enter into the exegesis\r\nof the passage thus referred to, we might easily show that Mr. Sumner is\r\ngrossly at fault in his Greek. We might show that something far more\r\nenormous than even trading in slaves is aimed at by the condemnation of\r\nthe apostle. But we have not undertaken to defend \"manstealers,\" nor\r\n\"slave-traders,\" in any form or shape. Hence, we shall dismiss this\r\npoint with the opinion of Macknight, who thinks the persons thus\r\ncondemned in company with murderers of fathers and mothers, are \"they\r\nwho make war for the inhuman purpose of selling the vanquished as\r\nslaves, as is the practice of the African princes.\" To take any free\r\nman, whether white or black, by force, and sell him into bondage, is\r\nmanstealing. To make war for such a purpose, were, we admit, wholesale\r\nmurder and manstealing combined. This view of the passage in question\r\nagrees with that of the great abolitionist, Mr. Barnes, who holds that\r\n\"the _essential_ idea of the term\" in question, \"is _that of converting\r\na free man into a slave_\" . . . . the \"changing of a freeman into a slave,\r\nespecially by traffic, subjection, etc.\" Now, as we of the South,\r\nagainst whom Mr. Sumner is pleased to inveigh, propose to make no such\r\nchanges of freemen into slaves, much less to wage war for any such\r\npurpose, we may dismiss his gross perversion of the text in question. He\r\nmay apply the condemnation of the apostle to us now, if it so please the\r\nbenignity of his Christian charity, but it will not, we assure him,\r\nenter into our consciences, until we shall not only become\r\n\"slave-traders,\" but also, with a view to the gain of such odious\r\ntraffic, make war upon freemen.\r\n\r\nWe have undertaken to defend, as we have said, neither \"slave-traders,\"\r\nnor \"manstealers.\" We leave them both to the tender mercies of Mr.\r\nSumner. But we have undertaken to defend slavery, that is, _the_ slavery\r\nof the South, and to vindicate the character of Southern masters against\r\nthe aspersions of their calumniators. And in this vindication we shrink\r\nnot from St. Paul's \"real judgment of slavery.\" Nay, we desire, above\r\nall things, to have his real judgment. His judgment, we mean, not of\r\nmanstealers or of murderers, but of slavery and slaveholders. We have\r\njust seen \"his real judgment\" respecting the character of one\r\nslaveholder. We have seen it in the very epistle Mr. Sumner is\r\ndiscussing. Why, then, does he fly from St. Paul's opinion of the\r\nslaveholder to what he has said of the manstealer and the murderer? We\r\nwould gather an author's opinion of slavery from what he has said of\r\nslavery itself, or of the slaveholder. But this does not seem to suit\r\nMr. Sumner's purpose quite so well. Entirely disregarding the apostle's\r\nopinion of the slaveholder contained in the passage right before him, as\r\nwell as elsewhere, Mr. Sumner infers his \"real judgment of slavery\" from\r\nwhat he has said of manstealers and murderers! He might just as well\r\nhave inferred St. Paul's opinion of Philemon from what he has, \"on\r\nanother occasion,\" said of Judas Iscariot.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner contents himself with \"calling attention to two things,\r\napparent on the face\" of the epistle itself; and which, in his opinion,\r\nare \"in themselves an all-sufficient response.\" The first of these\r\nthings is, says he: \"While it appears that Onesimus had been in some way\r\nthe servant of Philemon, it does not appear that he had ever been held\r\nas a slave, much less as a chattel.\" It does not appear that Onesimus\r\nwas the slave of Philemon, is the position of the celebrated senatorial\r\nabolitionist. We cannot argue this position with him, however, since he\r\nhas not deigned to give any reasons for it, but chosen to let it rest\r\nupon his assertion merely. We shall, therefore, have to argue the point\r\nwith Mr. Albert Barnes, and other abolitionists, who have been pleased\r\nto attempt to bolster up so novel, so original, and so bold an\r\ninterpretation of Scripture with exegetical reasons and arguments.\r\n\r\nIn looking into these reasons and arguments,--if reasons and arguments\r\nthey may be called,--we are at a loss to conceive on what principle\r\ntheir authors have proceeded. The most plausible conjecture we can make\r\nis, that it was deemed sufficient to show that it is possible, by a bold\r\nstroke of interpretation, to call in question the fact that Onesimus was\r\nthe slave of Philemon; since, if this may only be questioned by the\r\nlearned, then the unlearned need not trouble themselves with the\r\nScripture, but simply proceed with the work of abolitionism. Then may\r\nthey cry, \"Who shall decide when doctors disagree?\"[171] and give all\r\nsuch disputings to the wind. Such seems to us to have been the principle\r\non which the assertion of Mr. Sumner and Mr. Barnes has proceeded;\r\nevincing, as it does, an utter, total, and reckless disregard of the\r\nplainest teachings of inspiration. But let the candid reader hear, and\r\nthen determine for himself.\r\n\r\nThe Greek word [Greek: doulos], applied to Onesimus, means, according to\r\nMr. Barnes, either a slave, or a hired servant, or an apprentice. It is\r\nnot denied that it means a _slave_. \"The word,\" says Mr. Barnes himself,\r\n\"is that which is commonly applied to a slave.\" Indeed, to assert that\r\nthe Greek word [Greek: doulos] does not mean _slave_, were only a little\r\nless glaringly absurd than to affirm that no such meaning belongs to the\r\nEnglish term _slave_ itself. If it were necessary, this point might be\r\nmost fully, clearly, and conclusively established; but since is is not\r\ndenied, no such work of supererogation is required at our hands.\r\n\r\nBut it is insisted, that the word in question has a more extensive\r\nsignification than the English term _slave_. \"Thus,\" says Mr. Barnes,\r\n\"it is so extensive in its signification as to be applicable to any\r\nspecies of servitude, whether voluntary or involuntary.\" Again: \"All\r\nthat is necessairly implied by it is, that he was, in some way, the\r\nservant of Philemon--whether _hired or bought cannot be shown_.\" Once\r\nmore, he says: \"The word denotes _servant_ of any kind, and it should\r\nnever be assumed that those to whom it was applied were slaves.\" Thus,\r\naccording to Mr. Barnes, the word in question denotes a slave, or a\r\nhired servant, or, as he has elsewhere said, an apprentice. It denotes\r\n\"servant of _any_ kind,\" whether \"voluntary or involuntary.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the positive assertion of Mr. Barnes. But where is the proof?\r\nWhere is the authority on which it rests? Surely, if this word is\r\napplied to hired servants, either in the Greek classics or in the New\r\nTestament, Mr. Barnes, or Mr. Sumner, or some other learned\r\nabolitionist, should refer us to the passage where it is so used. We\r\nhave Mr. Barnes' assertion, again and again repeated, in his very\r\nelaborate Notes on the Epistle to Philemon; but not the shadow of an\r\nauthority for any such use of the word. But stop: in making this\r\nassertion, he refers us to his \"Notes on Eph. vi 5, and 1 Tim. vi.\"\r\nPerhaps we may find his authority by the help of one of these\r\nreferences. We turn, then, to Eph. vi. 5; and we find the following\r\nnote: \"Servants. [Greek: Hoi douloi]. The word here used denotes one who\r\nis bound to render service to another, whether that service be free or\r\nvoluntary, and may denote, therefore, either a slave, or one who binds\r\nhimself to render service to another. _It is often used in these senses\r\nin the New Testament, just as it is elsewhere._\"[172] Why, then, if it\r\nis so often used to denote a hired servant, or an apprentice, or a\r\nvoluntary servant of any kind, in the New Testament, is not at least one\r\nsuch instance of its use produced by Mr. Barnes? He must have been aware\r\nthat one such authority from the New Testament was worth more than his\r\nbare assertion, though it were a hundred times repeated. Yet no such\r\nauthority is adduced or referred to; he merely supports his assertion in\r\nthe one place by his assertion in the other?\r\n\r\nLet us look, in the next place, to his other reference, which is to 1\r\nTim. vi. 1. Here, again, we find not the shadow of an authority that the\r\nword in question is applicable to \"hired servants,\" or \"apprentices.\" We\r\nsimply meet the oft-repeated assertion of the author, that it is\r\napplicable to _any_ species of servitude. He refers from assertion to\r\nassertion, and nowhere gives a single authority to the point in\r\nquestion. If we may believe him, such authorities are abundant, even in\r\nthe New Testament; yet he leaves the whole matter to rest upon his own\r\nnaked assertion! Yea, as Greek scholars, he would have us to believe\r\nthat [Greek: doulos] may mean a \"hired servant,\" just as well as a\r\nslave; and he would have us to believe this, too, not upon the usage of\r\nGreek writers, but upon his mere assertion! We look for other evidence;\r\nand we intend to pin him down to proof, ere we follow him in questions\r\nof such momentous import as the one we have in hand.\r\n\r\nWhy is it, then, we ask the candid reader, if the term in question mean\r\n\"a hired servant,\" as well as a slave, that no such application of the\r\nword is given? If such applications be as abundant as our author asserts\r\nthey are, why not refer us to a single instance, that our utter\r\nignorance may be at least relieved by one little ray of light? Why\r\nrefer us from assertion to assertion, if authorities may be so\r\nplentifully had? We cannot conceive, unless the object be to deceive the\r\nunwary, or those who may be willingly deceived. An assertion merely,\r\nbolstered up with a \"See note,\" here or there, may be enough for such;\r\nbut if, after all, there be nothing but assertion on assertion piled, we\r\nshall not let it pass for proof. Especially, if such assertion be at war\r\nwith truth, we shall track its author, and, if possible, efface his\r\nfootprints from the immaculate word of God.\r\n\r\nIf the term [Greek: doulos] signifies \"a hired servant,\" or \"an\r\napprentice,\" it is certainly a most extraordinary circumstance that the\r\nbest lexicographers of the Greek language have not made the discovery.\r\nThis were the more wonderful, if, as Mr. Barnes asserts, the word \"is\r\noften used in these senses\" by Greek writers. We have several Greek\r\nlexicons before us, and in not one of them is there any such meaning\r\ngiven to the word. Thus, in Donnegan, for example, we find: \"[Greek:\r\ndoulos], a slave, a servant, as opposed to [Greek: despotês], a master.\"\r\nBut we do not find from him that it is ever applied to hired servants or\r\napprentices. In like manner, Liddell and Scott have \"[Greek: doulos], a\r\n_slave_, _bondman_, strictly one born so, opposed to [Greek:\r\nandrapodon].\" But they do not lay down \"a hired servant,\" or \"an\r\napprentice,\" as one of its significations. If such, indeed, be found\r\namong the meanings of the word, these celebrated lexicographers were as\r\nignorant of the fact as ourselves. Stephens also, as any one may see by\r\nreferring to his \"Thesaurus, Ling. Græc., Tom I. art. [Greek: Doulos],\"\r\nwas equally ignorant of any such use of the term in question. Is it not\r\na pity, then, that, since such knowledge rested with Mr. Barnes, and\r\nsince, according to his own statement, proofs of its accuracy were so\r\nabundant, he should have withheld all the evidence in his possession,\r\nand left so important a point to stand or fall with his bare assertion?\r\nEven if the rights of mankind had not been in question, the interests of\r\nGreek literature were, one would think, sufficient to have induced him\r\nto enlighten our best lexicographers with respect to the use of the word\r\nunder consideration. Such, an achievement would, we can assure him, have\r\ndetracted nothing from his reputation for scholarship.\r\n\r\nBut how stands the word in the New Testament? It is certain that,\r\nhowever \"often it may be applied\" to hired servants in the New\r\nTestament, Mr. Barnes has not condescended to adduce a single\r\napplication of the kind. This is not all. Those who have examined every\r\ntext of the New Testament in which the word [Greek: doulos] occurs, and\r\ncompiled lexicons especially for the elucidation of the sacred volume,\r\nhave found no such instance of its application.\r\n\r\nThus, Schleusner, in his Lexicon of the New Testament, tells us that it\r\nmeans slave as opposed to, [Greek: eleutheros], _freeman_. His own words\r\nare: [Greek: Doulos, ou, ho], (1) proprie: _servus, minister, homo non\r\nliber nec sui juris_, et opponitur [Greek: tô eleutheros]. Matt. viii.\r\n9; xiii. 27, 28; 1 Cor. vii. 21, 22; xii. 13; [Greek: eite douloi, eite\r\neleutheroi]. Tit. ii. 9.\"\r\n\r\nWe next appeal to Robinson's Lexicon of the New Testament. We there find\r\nthese words: \"[Greek: doulos, ou, ho], _a bondman, slave, servant, pr.\r\nby birth_; diff. from [Greek: andrapodon], 'one enslaved in war,' comp.\r\nXen. An., iv. 1, 12,\" etc. Now if, as Mr. Barnes asserts, the word in\r\nquestion is so often applied to hired servants in the New Testament, is\r\nit not passing strange that neither Schleusner nor Robinson should have\r\ndiscovered any such application of it? So far, indeed, is Dr. Robinson\r\nfrom having made any such discovery, that he expressly declares that the\r\n[Greek: doulos] \"WAS NEVER A HIRED SERVANT; _the latter being called_\r\n[Greek: misthios, misthôtos].\" \"In a family,\" continues the same high\r\nauthority, \"the [Greek: doulos] was _bound to serve, a slave_, and was\r\nthe property of his master, 'a living possession,' as Aristotle calls\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Greek [Greek: doulos],\" says Dr. Smith, in his Dictionary of\r\nAntiquities, \"like the Latin _servus_, corresponds to the usual meaning\r\nof our word slave. . . . . Aristotle (Polit. i. 3.) says that a complete\r\nhousehold is that which consists of slaves and freemen, ([Greek: oikia\r\nde teleios ek doulôn kai eleutherôn],) and he defines a slave to be a\r\nliving working-tool and possession. ([Greek: Ho doulos empsychon,\r\norganon], Ethic. Nicim. viii. 13; [Greek: ho doulos ktêma ti empsychon],\r\nPol. i. 4.) Thus Aristotle himself defines the [Greek: doulos] to be,\r\nnot a \"servant of any kind,\" but a slave; and we presume that he\r\nunderstood the force of this Greek word at least as well as Mr. Barnes\r\nor Mr. Sumner. And Dr. Robinson, as we have just seen, declares that it\r\nnever means a hired servant.\r\n\r\nIndeed, all this is so well understood by Greek scholars, that Dr.\r\nMacknight does not hesitate to render the term [Greek: doulos], applied\r\nto Onesimus in the Epistle to Philemon, by the English word _slave_. He\r\nhas not even added a footnote, as is customary with him when he deems\r\nany other translation of a word than that given by himself at all worthy\r\nof notice. In like manner, Moses Stuart just proceeds to call Onesimus\r\n\"the slave of Philemon,\" as if there could be no ground for doubt on so\r\nplain a point. Such is the testimony of these two great Biblical\r\ncritics, who devoted their lives in great measure to the study of the\r\nlanguage, literature, and interpretation of the Epistles of the New\r\nTestament.\r\n\r\nNow, it should be observed, that not one of the authorities quoted by us\r\nhad any motive \"to pervert texts,\" or \"to invent authorities,\" \"in\r\nsupport of slavery.\" Neither Donnegan, nor Liddell and Scott, nor\r\nStephens, nor Schleusner, nor Robinson, nor Smith, nor Macknight, nor\r\nStuart, could possibly have had any such motive. If they were not all\r\nperfectly unbiassed witnesses, it is certain they had no bias in favor\r\nof slavery. It is, indeed, the abolitionist, and not the slaveholder,\r\nwho, in this case, \"has perverted texts;\" and if he has not \"invented\r\nauthorities,\" it is because his attempts to do so have proved abortive.\r\n\r\nBeside the clear and unequivocal import of the word applied to Onesimus,\r\nit is evident, from other considerations, that he was the slave of\r\nPhilemon. To dwell upon all of these would, we fear, be more tedious\r\nthan profitable to the reader. Hence we shall confine our attention to a\r\nsingle circumstance, which will, we think, be sufficient for any candid\r\nor impartial inquirer after truth. Among the arguments used by St. Paul\r\nto induce Philemon to receive his fugitive slave kindly, we find this:\r\n\"For perhaps he therefore departed _for a season_, that thou shouldest\r\nreceive him _forever_.\" This verse is thus paraphrased by Macknight: \"To\r\nmitigate thy resentment, consider, that _perhaps also for this reason he\r\nwas separated_ from thee _for a little while_, (so [Greek: pros hôran]\r\nsignified, 1 Thess. ii. 17, note 2,) _that thou mightest have him_ thy\r\nslave _for life_.\" Dr. Macknight also adds, in a footnote: \"By telling\r\nPhilemon that he would now have Onesimus forever, the apostle intimates\r\nto him his firm persuasion that Onesimus would never any more run away\r\nfrom him.\" Such seems to be the plain, obvious import of the apostle's\r\nargument. No one, it is believed, who had no set purpose to subserve, or\r\nno foregone conclusion to support, would view this argument in any other\r\nlight. Perhaps he was separated for a while as a slave, that \"thou\r\nmightest have him forever,\" or for life. How have him? Surely, one\r\nwould think, as a slave, or in the same capacity from which he was\r\nseparated for a while. The argument requires this; the opposition of the\r\nwords, and the force of the passage, imperatively require it. But yet,\r\nif we may believe Mr. Barnes, the meaning of St. Paul is, that perhaps\r\nOnesimus was separated for a while _as a servant_, that Philemon might\r\nnever receive him again as a servant, but forever as a Christian\r\nbrother! Lest we should be suspected of misrepresentation, we shall give\r\nhis own words. \"The meaning is,\" says he, \"that it was possible that\r\nthis was permitted in the providence of God, _in order_ that Onesimus\r\nmight be brought under the influence of the gospel, and be far more\r\nserviceable to Philemon as a Christian than he could have been in his\r\nformer relation to him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth verse of the epistle, St. Paul says: \"Whom I have sent\r\nagain,\" or, as Macknight more accurately renders the words, \"Him I have\r\nsent back,\" ([Greek: hon anepempsa].) Here we see the great apostle\r\n_actually sending back a fugitive slave to his master_. That act of St.\r\nPaul is not, and cannot be, denied. The words are too plain for denial.\r\nOnesimus \"_I have sent back_.\" Surely it cannot be otherwise than a most\r\nunpleasant spectacle to abolitionist eyes thus to see Paul, the\r\naged--perhaps the most venerable and glorious hero whose life is upon\r\nrecord--assume such an attitude toward the institution of slavery. Had\r\nhe dealt with slavery as he always dealt with every thing which he\r\nregarded as sin; had he assumed toward it an attitude of stern and\r\nuncompromising hostility, and had his words been thunderbolts of\r\ndenunciation, then indeed would he have been a hero after the very\r\nhearts of the abolitionists. But, as it is, they have to _apologize_ for\r\nthe great apostle, and try, as best they may, to deliver him from his\r\n_very equivocal position_! But if they are true apostles, and not false,\r\nthen, we fear, the best apology for his conduct is that he had never\r\nread the Declaration of Independence, nor breathed the air of Boston.\r\n\r\nThis point, however, we shall not decide. We shall examine their\r\napologies, and let the candid reader decide for himself. St. Paul, it is\r\nnot denied, sent back Onesimus. But, says Mr. Barnes, he did not\r\n_compel_ or _urge_ him to go. He did not send him back against his will.\r\nOnesimus, no doubt, desired to return, and St. Paul was moved to send\r\nhim by his own request. Now, in the first place, this apology is built\r\non sheer assumption. There is not the slightest evidence that Onesimus\r\nrequested St. Paul to send him back to his master. \"There may have been\r\nmany reasons,\" says Mr. Barnes, \"why Onesimus desired to return to\r\nColosse, and no one can prove that he did not express that desire to St.\r\nPaul, and that his 'sending' him was not in consequence of such\r\nrequest.\" True; even if Onesimus had felt no such desire, and had\r\nexpressed no such desire to St. Paul, it would have been impossible, in\r\nthe very nature of things, for any one to prove such negatives, unless\r\nhe had been expressly informed on the subject by the writer of the\r\nepistle. But is it not truly wonderful, that any one should, without the\r\nleast particle or shadow of evidence, be pleased to imagine a series of\r\npropositions, and then call upon the opposite party to disprove them? Is\r\nnot such proceeding the very stuff that dreams are made of?\r\n\r\nNo doubt there may have been reasons why Onesimus should desire to\r\nreturn to his master. There were certainly reasons, and reasons of\r\ntremendous force, too, why he should have desired no such thing. The\r\nfact that Philemon, whom he had offended by running away, had, according\r\nto law, the power of life and death over him, is one of the reasons why\r\nhe should have dreaded to return. Hence, unless required by the apostle\r\nto return, he _may_ have desired no such thing, and no one can prove\r\nthat an expression of such desire on his part was the ground of the\r\napostle's action. It is certain, that he who affirms should prove.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, if St. Paul were an abolitionist at heart, he\r\nshould have avoided the appearance of so great an evil. He should not,\r\nfor a moment, have permitted himself to stand before the world in the\r\nsimple and unexplained attitude of one who had sent back a fugitive\r\nslave to his master. No honest abolitionist would permit himself to\r\nappear in such a light. He would scorn to occupy such a position. Hence,\r\nwe repeat, if St. Paul were an abolitionist at heart, he should have let\r\nit be known that, in sending Onesimus back, he was moved, not originally\r\nby the principles of his own heart, but by the desire and request of the\r\nfugitive himself. By such a course, he would have delivered himself from\r\na false position, and spared his friends among the abolitionists the\r\nnecessity of making awkward apologies for his conduct.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the positions of Mr. Barnes are not merely sheer assumptions;\r\nthey are perfectly gratuitous. For it is easy to explain the\r\ndetermination of St. Paul to send Onesimus back, without having recourse\r\nto the supposition that Onesimus desired him to do so. Such\r\ndetermination was, indeed, the natural and necessary result of the well\r\nknown principles of the great apostle. He had repeatedly, and most\r\nemphatically, inculcated the principle, that it is the duty of slaves to\r\n\"obey their masters,\" and to \"count them worthy of all honor.\" This duty\r\nOnesimus had clearly violated in running away from his master. If St.\r\nPaul, then, had not taught Onesimus a different doctrine from that which\r\nhe had taught the churches, he must have felt that he had done wrong in\r\nabsconding from Philemon, and desired to repair the wrong by returning\r\nto him. \"It is,\" says Mr. Barnes, \"by no means necessary to suppose that\r\nPaul felt that Onesimus was under _obligation_ to return.\" But we must\r\nsuppose this, unless we suppose that Paul felt that Onesimus was under\r\nno obligation to obey the precepts which he himself had delivered for\r\nthe guidance and direction of all Christian servants.\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly notice a few other of Mr. Barnes' arguments, and\r\nthen dismiss this branch of the subject. \"If St. Paul sent back\r\nOnesimus,\" says he, \"this was, doubtless, at his own request; for there\r\nis not the slightest evidence that he _compelled_ him, or even urged\r\nhim, to go.\" We might just as well conclude that St. Paul first required\r\nOnesimus to return, because there is not the slightest evidence that\r\nOnesimus made any such request.\r\n\r\n\"Paul,\" says Mr. Barnes, \"had no power to send Onesimus back to his\r\nmaster unless he chose to go.\" This is very true. But still Onesimus may\r\nhave chosen to go, just because St. Paul, his greatest benefactor and\r\nfriend, had told him it was his duty to do so. He may have chosen to go,\r\njust because the apostle had told him it is the duty of servants not to\r\nrun away from their masters, but to obey them, and count them worthy of\r\nall honor. It is also true, that \"there is not the slightest evidence\r\nthat he _compelled_ him, or even _urged_ him, to go.\" It is, on the\r\nother hand, equally true, that there is not the slightest evidence that\r\nany thing more than a bare expression of the apostle's opinion, or a\r\nreiteration of his well-known sentiments, was necessary to induce him to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\"The language is just as would have been used,\" says our author, \"on\r\nthe supposition, either that he requested him to go and bear a letter to\r\nColosse, or that Onesimus desired to go, and that Paul sent him\r\nagreeably to his request. Compare Phil. ii. 25: 'Yet I suppose it\r\nnecessary _to send_ Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor,'\r\netc.; Col. iv. 7, 8: 'All my estate shall Tychicus declare unto you, who\r\nis a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow-servant in the\r\nLord: whom I have _sent_ unto you for the same purpose, that he might\r\nknow your estate.' But Epaphroditus and Tychicus were not sent against\r\ntheir own will,--nor is there any more reason to think that Onesimus\r\nwas.\" Now there is not the least evidence that either Epaphroditus or\r\nTychicus _requested_ the apostle to _send_ them as he did; and, so far\r\nas appears from his statements, the whole thing originated with himself.\r\nIt is simply said that he _sent_ them. It is true, they were \"not sent\r\nagainst their own will,\" for they were ready and willing to obey his\r\ndirections. We have good reason, as we have seen, to believe that\r\nprecisely the same thing was true in regard to the sending of Onesimus.\r\n\r\nBut there is another case of _sending_ which Mr. Barnes has overlooked.\r\nIt is recorded in the same chapter of the same epistle which speaks of\r\nthe sending of Epaphroditus. We shall adduce it, for it is a case\r\ndirectly in point. \"But ye know the proof of him, (_i. e._ of Timothy,)\r\nthat, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.\r\nHim, therefore, I hope to _send_ presently, so soon as I shall see how\r\nit will go with me.\" Now, here the apostle proposes to send Timothy, not\r\nso soon as Timothy should request to be sent, but so soon as he should\r\nsee how it would go with himself as a prisoner at Rome. \"As a son with\r\nthe father,\" so Timothy, after his conversion, served with the great\r\napostle, and, not against his own will, but most cheerfully, obeyed his\r\ndirections. And in precisely the same ineffably endearing relation did\r\nOnesimus stand to the apostle. As a recent convert,--as a sincere and\r\nhumble Christian,--he naturally looked to his great inspired teacher for\r\nadvice, and was, no doubt, with more than filial affection, ready to\r\nobey.\r\n\r\nHence, we insist that Paul was responsible for the return of Onesimus to\r\nhis master. He might have prevented his return, had he so desired; for\r\nhe tells us so himself, (ver. 13.) But he chose to send him back. And\r\nwhy? Because Onesimus requested? The apostle says not so. \"I would have\r\nretained him with me,\" says he to Philemon, \"that in thy stead he might\r\nhave ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel. BUT WITHOUT THY MIND\r\nWOULD I DO NOTHING.\" Nay, whatever may have been his own desires, or\r\nthose of Onesimus, he would do nothing without the mind of Philemon.\r\nSuch is the reason which the apostle assigns for his own conduct, for\r\nhis own determination not to retain the fugitive slave.\r\n\r\n\"What the apostle wrote to Philemon on this occasion is,\" says Dr.\r\nMacknight, \"highly worthy of notice; namely, that although he had great\r\nneed of an affectionate, honest servant to minister to him in his bonds,\r\nsuch as Onesimus was, who had expressed a great inclination to stay with\r\nhim; and although, if Onesimus had remained with him, he would only have\r\ndischarged the duty which Philemon himself owed to his spiritual father,\r\nyet the apostle would by no means detain Onesimus without Philemon's\r\nleave, because it belonged to him to dispose of his own slave in the way\r\nhe thought proper. Such was the apostle's regard to justice, and to the\r\nrights of mankind!\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Barnes, however, the apostle was governed in this\r\ntransaction, not by a regard to principle or the rights of mankind, but\r\nby a regard for the feelings of the master! Just listen, for one moment,\r\nto his marvellous discourse: \"It is probable,\" says he, \"that _if_\r\nOnesimus had proposed to return, it would have been easy for Paul to\r\nhave retained him with him. He might have represented his own want of a\r\nfriend. He might have appealed to his gratitude on account of his\r\nefforts for his conversion. He might have shown him that he was under no\r\nmoral obligation to go back. He might have refused to give him this\r\nletter, and might have so represented to him the dangers of the way, and\r\nthe probability of a harsh reception, as effectually to have dissuaded\r\nhim from such a purpose. But, in that case, it is clear that this might\r\nhave caused hard feeling in the bosom of Philemon, and rather than do\r\nthat, he preferred to let him return to his master, and to plead for him\r\nthat he might have a kind reception. It is, therefore, by no means\r\nnecessary to suppose that Paul felt that Onesimus was under _obligation_\r\nto return, or that he was disposed to _compel_ him, or that Onesimus was\r\nnot inclined to return voluntarily; but all the circumstances of the\r\ncase are met by the supposition that, if Paul had retained him, Philemon\r\nmight conceive that he had injured _him_.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! that so much truth should have been suppressed; and that, too, by\r\nthe most glorious champion of truth the world has ever seen. He tells\r\nnot his \"son Onesimus\" that he is under no moral obligation to return to\r\nhis master. On the contrary, he leaves him ignorant of his rights--of\r\nhis inherent, sacred, and eternal rights. He sees him blindly put off\r\n\"the hero,\" and put on \"the brute\" again. And why? Because, forsooth, if\r\nhe should only speak, _he might cause hard feeling in the bosom of his\r\nmaster_! Should he retain Onesimus, his son, he would not injure\r\nPhilemon at all. But then Philemon \"might _conceive_\" that he had\r\ninjured him. Ah! when will abolitionist again suppress such mighty\r\ntruth, lest he disturb some _fancied_ right, or absurd feeling ruffle?\r\nWhen the volcano of his mind suppress and keep its furious fires in,\r\nlest he consume some petty despot's despicable sway; or else, at least,\r\ntouch his tender sensibilities with momentary pain? \"_Fiat justitia,\r\nruat coelum_,\" is a favorite maxim with other abolitionists. But St.\r\nPaul, it seems, could not assume quite so lofty a tone. He could not\r\nsay, \"Let justice be done, though the heavens should fall.\" He could not\r\neven say, \"Let justice be done,\" though the feelings of Philemon should\r\nbe hurt.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, we think, that St. Paul needs to be defended against Mr.\r\nBarnes' defenses of him, and vindicated against his apologies. If,\r\nindeed, he were so pitiful a pleader of \"the innocent cause\" as Mr.\r\nBarnes would have us to believe he is, then, we ask if those\r\nabolitionists are not in the right who despise both the apostle and his\r\ndoctrine? No other abolitionist, it is certain, will ever imitate his\r\nexample, as that example is represented by Mr. Barnes. No other\r\nabolitionist will ever suppress the great truths--as he conceives them\r\nto be--with which his soul is on fire, and which, in his view, lie at\r\nthe foundation of human happiness, lest he should \"cause hard feelings\"\r\nin the bosom of a slaveholder.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, perhaps, that the remarks and apology of Mr. Barnes do\r\nnot proceed on the supposition that Onesimus was a slave. If so, the\r\nanswer is at hand. For surely Mr. Barnes cannot think it would have been\r\ndishonorable in the apostle to advise, or even to urge, \"a hired\r\nservant,\" or \"an apprentice,\" to return and fulfill his contract. It is\r\nevident that, although Mr. Barnes would have the reader to believe that\r\nOnesimus was merely a hired servant or an apprentice, he soon forgets\r\nhis own interpretation, and proceeds to reason just as if he himself\r\nregarded him as a slave. This, if possible, will soon appear still more\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nThe apostle did not, according to Mr. Barnes, wholly conceal his\r\nabolition sentiments. He made them known to Philemon. Yes, we are\r\ngravely told, the letter which Onesimus carried in his pocket, as he\r\nwended his way back from Rome to Colosse, was and is an emancipation\r\ndocument! This great discovery is, we believe, due to the abolitionists\r\nof the present day. It was first made by Mr. Barnes, or Dr. Channing, or\r\nsome other learned emancipationist, and after them by Mr. Sumner.\r\nIndeed, the discovery that it appears from the face of the epistle\r\nitself that it is an emancipation document, is the second of the two\r\n\"conclusive things\" which, in Mr. Sumner's opinion, constitute \"an\r\nall-sufficient response\" to anti-abolitionists.\r\n\r\nNow supposing St. Paul to have been an abolitionist, such a disclosure\r\nof his views would, we admit, afford some little relief to our minds.\r\nFor it would show that, although he did not provoke opposition by\r\nproclaiming the truth to the churches and to the world, he could at\r\nleast run the risk of hurting the feelings of a slaveholder. But let us\r\nlook into this great discovery, and see if the apostle has, in reality,\r\nwhispered any such words of emancipation in the ear of Philemon.\r\n\r\nIn his note to the sixteenth verse of the epistle, Mr. Barnes says: \"Not\r\nnow as a servant. The adverb rendered 'not now,' ([Greek: _ouketi_])\r\nmeans _no more_, _no further_, _no longer_.\" So let it be. We doubt not\r\nthat such is its meaning. Hence, we need not examine Mr. Barnes'\r\nnumerous authorities, to show that such is the force of the adverb in\r\nquestion. He has, we admit, most abundantly established his point that\r\n[Greek: _ouketi_] means _no longer_. But then this is a point which no\r\nanti-abolitionist has the least occasion to deny. We find precisely the\r\nsame rendition in Macknight, and we are perfectly willing to abide by\r\nhis translation. If Mr. Barnes had spared himself the trouble of\r\nproducing these authorities, and adduced only one to show that [Greek:\r\n_doulos_] means _a hired servant_, or _an apprentice_, his labor would\r\nhave been bestowed where it is needed.\r\n\r\nAs the passage stands, then, St. Paul exhorts Philemon to receive\r\nOnesimus, \"no longer as a servant.\" Now this, we admit, is perfectly\r\ncorrect _as far as it goes_. \"It (_i. e._ this adverb) implies,\" says\r\nMr. Barnes, \"that he had been in this condition, _but was not to be\r\nnow_.\" He was _no longer_ to be a servant! Over this view of the\r\npassage, Mr. Sumner goes into quite a paroxysm of triumphant joy.\r\n\"Secondly,\" says he, \"in charging Onesimus with this epistle to\r\nPhilemon, the apostle announces him as 'not now a servant, but above a\r\nservant,--a brother beloved;' and he enjoins upon his correspondent the\r\nhospitality due only to a freeman, saying expressly, 'If thou count me,\r\ntherefore, as a partner, _receive him as myself_;' ay, sir, not as\r\nslave, not even as servant, but as a brother beloved, even as the\r\napostle himself. Thus with apostolic pen wrote Paul to his disciple\r\nPhilemon. Beyond all doubt, in these words of gentleness, benediction,\r\nand EMANCIPATION,[173] dropping with celestial, soul-awakening power,\r\nthere can be no justification for a conspiracy, which, beginning with\r\nthe treachery of Iscariot, and the temptation of pieces of silver, seeks\r\nby fraud, brutality, and violence, through officers of the law armed to\r\nthe teeth like pirates, and amid soldiers who degrade their uniform, to\r\nhurl a fellow-man back into the lash-resounding den of American slavery;\r\nand if any one can thus pervert this beneficent example, allow me to say\r\nthat he gives too much occasion to doubt his intelligence or his\r\nsincerity.\"\r\n\r\nNow in regard to the spirit of this passage we have at present nothing\r\nto say. The sudden transition from the apostle's \"words of blessing and\r\nbenediction,\" to Mr. Sumner's words of railing and vituperation, we\r\nshall pass by unnoticed. Upon these the reader may make his own\r\ncomments. It is our object simply to comment on the words of the great\r\napostle. And, in the first place, we venture to suggest that there are\r\nseveral very serious difficulties in the way of Mr. Barnes' and Mr.\r\nSumner's interpretation of the passage in question.\r\n\r\nLet us, for the sake of argument, concede to these gentlemen that\r\nOnesimus was merely the hired servant, or apprentice, of Philemon. What\r\nthen follows? If they are not in error, it clearly and unequivocally\r\nfollows that St. Paul's \"words of emancipation\" were intended, not for\r\nslaves merely, but for hired servants and apprentices! For servants of\r\nany and every desrciption! Mr. Sumner expressly tells us that he was to\r\nreturn, \"not as a slave, _not even as a servant_, but as a brother\r\nbeloved.\" Now such a scheme of emancipation would, it seems to us, suit\r\nthe people of Boston as little as it would those of Richmond. It would\r\nabolish every kind of \"servitude, whether voluntary or involuntary,\" and\r\nrelease all hired servants, as well as apprentices, from the obligation\r\nof their contracts. Such is one of the difficulties in their way. It may\r\nnot detract from the \"sincerity,\" it certainly reflects no credit on the\r\n\"intelligence,\" of Mr. Sumner, to be guilty of such an oversight.\r\n\r\nThere is another very grave difficulty in the way of these gentlemen.\r\nSt. Paul writes that the servant Onesimus, who had been unprofitable to\r\nPhilemon in times past, would now be profitable to him. But how\r\nprofitable? As a servant? No! he was no longer to serve him at all. His\r\n\"emancipation\" was announced! He was to be received, not as a slave, not\r\neven as a servant, but _only_ as a brother beloved! Philemon was,\r\nindeed, to extend to him the hospitalities due to a freeman, even such\r\nas were due to the apostle himself? Now, for aught we know, it may have\r\nbeen very agreeable to the feelings of Philemon, to have his former\r\nservant thus unceremoniously \"emancipated,\" and quartered upon him as \"a\r\ngentleman of elegant leisure;\" but how this could have been so\r\n_profitable_ to him is more than we can conceive.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, we think, that in a worldly point of view, all the\r\nprofits would have been on the side of Onesimus. \"But,\" says Mr. Barnes,\r\n\"he would now be more profitable as a Christian brother.\" It is true,\r\nOnesimus had not been very profitable as a Christian brother before he\r\nran away, for he had not been a Christian brother at all. But if he were\r\nsent back by the apostle, because he would be profitable merely as a\r\nChristian brother, we cannot see why any other Christian brother would\r\nnot have answered the purpose just as well as Onesimus. If such, indeed,\r\nwere the apostle's object, he might have conferred a still greater\r\nbenefit upon Philemon by sending several Christian brethren to live with\r\nhim, and to feast upon his good things.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the supposition that St. Paul thus announced the emancipation\r\nof Onesimus, is as inconsistent with the whole scope and design of the\r\npassage, as it is with the character of the apostle. If he would do\r\nnothing without the consent of Philemon, not even retain his servant to\r\nminister to himself while in prison, much less would he declare him\r\nemancipated, and introduce him to his former master as a freeman. We\r\nsubmit to the candid reader, we submit to every one who has the least\r\nperception of the character and spirit of the apostle, if such an\r\ninterpretation of his words be not simply ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that such an interpretation is peculiar to abolitionists.\r\n\"Men,\" says Mr. Sumner, \"are prone to find in uncertain, disconnected\r\ntexts, a confirmation of their own personal prejudices or\r\nprepossessions. And I,\"--he continues, \"who am no divine, but only a\r\nsimple layman--make bold to say, that whosoever finds in the gospel any\r\nsanction of slavery, finds there merely a reflection of himself.\" He\r\nmust have been a very simple layman indeed, if he did not perceive how\r\nvery easily his words might have been retorted. We venture to affirm\r\nthat no one, except an abolitionist, has ever found the slightest\r\ntincture of abolitionism in the writings of the great apostle to the\r\nGentiles.\r\n\r\nThe plain truth is, that Philemon is exhorted to receive Onesimus \"no\r\nlonger as a slave ONLY, but above a slave,--a brother beloved.\" Such is\r\nthe translation of Macknight, and such, too, is the concurrent voice of\r\nevery commentator to whom we have access. Pool, Clarke, Scott, Benson,\r\nDoddridge--all unite in the interpretation that Onesimus was, in the\r\nheaven-inspired and soul-subduing words of the loving apostle, commended\r\nto his master, not as a slave _merely_, but also as a Christian brother.\r\nThe great fact--the \"words of emancipation,\" which Mr. Sumner sees so\r\nclearly on \"the face of the epistle,\"--they cannot see at all. Neither\r\nsign nor shadow of any such thing can they perceive. It is a sheer\r\nreflection of the abolitionist himself. Thus, the Old Testament is not\r\nonly merged in the New, but the New itself is merged in Mr. Charles\r\nSumner, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWe shall notice one passage more of Scripture. The seventh chapter of\r\nthe Epistle to the Corinthians begins thus: \"Now concerning the things\r\nwhereof ye wrote unto me;\" and it proceeds to notice, among other\r\nthings, the relation of master and slave. This passage was designed to\r\ncorrect the disorders among the Christian slaves at Corinth, who,\r\nagreeably to the doctrine of the false teacher, _claimed their liberty,\r\non pretense that, as brethren in Christ, they were on an equality with\r\ntheir Christian masters_.\" Here, then, St. Paul met abolitionism face\r\nto face. And how did he proceed? Did he favor the false teacher? Did he\r\nrecognize the claim of the discontented Christian slaves? Did he even\r\nonce hint that they were entitled to their freedom, on the ground that\r\nall men are equal, or on any other ground whatever? His own words will\r\nfurnish the best answer to these questions.\r\n\r\n\"Let every man,\" says he, \"abide in the same calling wherein he was\r\ncalled. Art thou called, being a servant? _care not for it._\" Thus, were\r\nChristian slaves exhorted to continue in that condition of life in which\r\nthey were when converted to Christianity. This will not be denied. It is\r\ntoo plain for controversy. It is even admitted by Mr. Barnes himself. In\r\nthe devout contemplation of this passage Chrysostom exclaims: \"Hast thou\r\nbeen called, being a slave? Care not for it. Continue to be a slave.\r\nHast thou been called, being in uncircumcision? Remain uncircumcised.\r\nBeing circumcised, didst thou become a believer? Continue circumcised.\r\nFor these are no hindrances to piety. Thou are called, being a slave;\r\nanother, with an unbelieving wife; another, being circumcised.\r\n[Astonishing! Where has he put slavery?] As circumcision profits not,\r\nand uncircumcision does no harm, so neither doth slavery nor yet\r\nliberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"The great argument\" against slavery is, according to Dr. Channing and\r\nother abolitionists, drawn from the immortality of the soul. \"Into every\r\nhuman being,\" says he, \"God has breathed an immortal spirit, more\r\nprecious than the whole outward creation. No earthly nor celestial\r\nlanguage can exaggerate the worth of a human being.\" The powers of this\r\nimmortal spirit, he concludes, \"reduce to insignificance all outward\r\ndistinctions.\" Yea, according to St. Paul himself, they reduce to utter\r\ninsignificance all outward distinctions, and especially the distinction\r\nbetween liberty and slavery. \"Art thou called,\" says he, \"being a slave?\r\ncare not for it.\" Art thou, indeed, the Lord's freeman and _as such_\r\ndestined to reign on a throne of glory forever? Oh, then, care not for\r\nthe paltry distinctions of the passing world!\r\n\r\nNow, whom shall the Christian teacher take for his model?--St. Paul, or\r\nDr. Channing? Shall he seek to make men contented with the condition in\r\nwhich God has placed them, or shall he stir up discontent, and inflame\r\nthe restless passions of men? Shall he himself, like the great apostle,\r\nbe content to preach the doctrines of eternal life to a perishing\r\nworld; or shall he make politics his calling, and inveigh against the\r\ndomestic relations of society? Shall he exhort men not to continue in\r\nthe condition of life in which God has placed them, but to take his\r\nprovidence out of his hands, and, _in [Greek: ]direct opposition to his\r\nword_, assert their rights? In one word, shall he preach the gospel of\r\nChrist and his apostles, or shall he preach the gospel of the\r\nabolitionist?\r\n\r\n\"Art thou called, being a servant? care not for it; but if thou mayest\r\nbe made free, use it rather.\" The Greek runs thus: [Greek: _all' ei kai\r\ndunasai eleutheros genesthai, mallon chrêsai_],--literally, \"but even if\r\nthou canst become free, rather make use of.\" Make use of what? The Greek\r\nverb is left without a case. How, then, shall this be applied? To what\r\ndoes the ambiguous _it_ of our translation refer? \"One and all of the\r\nnative Greek commentators in the early ages,\" says Stuart, \"and many\r\nexpositors in modern times, say that the word to be supplied is [Greek:\r\n_douleia_], i. e. _slavery, bondage_. The reason which they give for it\r\nis, that this is the only construction which can support the proposition\r\nthe apostle is laboring to establish, viz.: 'Let every man abide in\r\n_statu quo_.' Even De Wette, (who, for his high liberty notions, was\r\nbanished from Germany,) in his commentary on this passage, seems plainly\r\nto accede to the force of this reasoning; and with him many others have\r\nagreed. No man can look at the simple continuity of logic in the passage\r\nwithout feeling that there is force in the appeal.\" Yet the fact should\r\nnot be concealed, that Stuart himself is \"not satisfied with this\r\nexegesis of the passage;\" which, according to his own statement, was the\r\nuniversal interpretation from \"the early ages\" down to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. This change, says he, \"seems to have been the spontaneous\r\nprompting of the spirit of liberty, that beat high\" in the bosom of its\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nNow have we not some reason to distrust an interpretation which comes\r\nnot exactly from Heaven, but from a spirit beating high in the human\r\nbreast? _That_ is certainly not an unerring spirit. We have already seen\r\nwhat it can do with the Scriptures. But whether it has erred in this\r\ninstance, or not, it is certain that it should never be permitted to\r\nbeat so very high in any human breast as to annul the teachings of the\r\napostle, or to make him contradict himself. This has been too often\r\ndone. We too frequently hear those who admit that St. Paul exhorts\r\n\"slaves to continue in slavery,\" still contend that \"if they may be\r\nmade free,\" they should move heaven and earth to attain so desirable an\r\nobject. They \"should continue in that state,\" and yet exert all their\r\npower to escape therefrom!\r\n\r\nConybeare and Howson, who are acknowledged to be among the best\r\ncommentators of the Epistles of St. Paul, have restored \"the continuity\r\nof his logic.\" They translate his words thus: \"Nay, though thou have\r\npower to gain thy freedom, seek rather to remain content.\" This\r\ntranslation certainly possesses the advantage that it makes the doctrine\r\nof St. Paul perfectly consistent with itself.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the point in regard to which there is no\r\ncontroversy. It is on all sides agreed, that St. Paul no less than three\r\ntimes exhorts every man to continue in the condition in which Providence\r\nhas placed him. \"And this rule,\" says he, \"ordain I in all the\r\nchurches.\" Yet--would any man believe it possible?--the very\r\nquintessence of abolitionism itself has been extracted from this passage\r\nof his writings! Let us consider for a moment the wonderful alchemy by\r\nwhich this has been effected.\r\n\r\nWe find in this passage the words: \"Be not ye the servants of men.\"\r\nThese words are taken from the connection in which they stand,\r\ndissevered from the words which precede and follow them, and then made\r\nto teach that slaves should not submit to the authority of their\r\nmasters, should not continue in their present condition. It is certain\r\nthat no one but an abolitionist, who has lost all respect for revelation\r\nexcept when it happens to square with his own notions, could thus make\r\nthe apostle so directly and so flatly contradict himself and all his\r\nteaching. Different interpretations have been given to the words just\r\nquoted; but until abolitionism set its cloven foot upon the Bible, such\r\nviolence had not been done to its sacred pages.\r\n\r\nConybeare and Howson suppose that the words in question are intended to\r\ncaution the Corinthians against \"their servile adherence to party\r\nleaders.\" Bloomfield, in like manner, says: \"The best commentators are\r\nagreed,\" that they are \"to be taken figuratively, in the sense, 'do not\r\nbe blindly followers of men, conforming to their opinions,' etc.\" It is\r\ncertain that Rosenmüller, Grotius, and we know not how many more, have\r\nall concurred in this interpretation. But be the meaning what it may,\r\n_it is not_ an exhortation to slaves to burst their bonds in sunder,\r\nunless the apostle has, in one and the same breath, taught\r\ndiametrically opposite doctrines.\r\n\r\nYet, in direct opposition to the plain words of the apostle, and to the\r\nconcurrent voice of commentators and critics, is he made to teach that\r\nslaves should throw off the authority of their masters! Lest such a\r\nthing should be deemed impossible, we quote the words of the author by\r\nwhom this outrage has been perpetrated. \"The command of the 23d verse,\"\r\nsays he, \"'be not ye the servants of men,' is equally plain. There are\r\nno such commands uttered in regard to the relations of husband and wife,\r\nparent and child, as are here given in regard to slavery. _No one is\r\nthus urged to dissolve the marriage relation. No such commands are given\r\nto relieve children from obedience to their parents_,\" etc.[174] Nor is\r\nany such command, we repeat, given to relieve slaves from obedience to\r\ntheir masters, or to dissolve the relation between them.\r\n\r\nIf such violence to Scripture had been done by an obscure scribbler, or\r\nby an infidel quoting the word of God merely for a purpose, it would not\r\nhave been matter of such profound astonishment. But is it not\r\nunspeakably shocking that a Christian man, nay, that a Christian\r\nminister and doctor of divinity, should thus set at naught the clearest,\r\nthe most unequivocal, and the most universally received teachings of the\r\ngospel? If he had merely accused the Christian man of the South, as he\r\nhas so often done in his two stupid volumes on slavery, of the crimes of\r\n\"swindling,\" of \"theft,\" of \"robbing,\" and of \"manstealing,\" we could\r\nhave borne with him well; and, as we have hitherto done, continued to\r\npass by his labors with silent contempt. But we have deemed it important\r\nto show in what manner, and to what extent, the spirit of abolitionism\r\ncan wrest the pure word of God to its antichristian purpose.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude the argument from scripture with the following just\r\nand impressive testimony of the Princeton Review: \"The mass of the pious\r\nand thinking people in this country are neither abolitionists nor the\r\nadvocates of slavery. They stand where they ever have stood--on the\r\nbroad Scriptural foundation; maintaining the obligation of all men, in\r\ntheir several places and relations, to act on the law of love, and to\r\npromote the spiritual and temporal welfare of others by every means in\r\ntheir power. They stand aloof from the abolitionists for various\r\nreasons. In the first place, they disapprove of their principles. The\r\nleading characteristic doctrine of this sect is that slaveholding is in\r\nall cases a sin, and should, therefore, under all circumstances, be\r\nimmediately abandoned. _As nothing can be plainer than that slaveholders\r\nwere admitted to the Christian church by the inspired apostles, the\r\nadvocates of this doctrine are brought into direct collision with the\r\nScriptures. This leads to one of the most dangerous evils connected with\r\nthe whole system, viz., a disregard of the authority of the word of God,\r\na setting up a different and higher standard of truth and duty, and a\r\nproud and confident wresting of Scripture to suit their own purposes._\r\nTHE HISTORY OF INTERPRETATION FURNISHES NO EXAMPLES OF MORE WILLFUL AND\r\nVIOLENT PERVERSIONS OF THE SACRED TEXT THAN ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE\r\nWRITINGS OF THE ABOLITIONISTS. THEY SEEM TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES ABOVE\r\nTHE SCRIPTURES; AND WHEN THEY PUT THEMSELVES ABOVE THE LAW OF GOD, IT IS\r\nNOT WONDERFUL THAT THEY SHOULD DISREGARD THE LAWS OF MEN. Significant\r\nmanifestations of the result of this disposition to consider their own\r\nlight a surer guide than the word of God, are visible in the anarchical\r\nopinions about human governments, civil and ecclesiastical, and on the\r\nrights of women, which have found appropriate advocates in the abolition\r\npublications. Let these principles be carried out, and there is an end\r\nto all social subordination, to all security for life and property, to\r\nall guarantee for public or domestic virtue. If our women are to be\r\nemancipated from subjection to the law which God has imposed upon them,\r\nif they are to quit the retirement of domestic life, where they preside\r\nin stillness over the character and destiny of society; if they are to\r\ncome forth in the liberty of men, to be our agents, our public\r\nlecturers, our committee-men, our rulers; if, in studied insult to the\r\nauthority of God, we are to renounce in the marriage contract all claim\r\nto obedience, we shall soon have a country over which the genius of Mary\r\nWolstonecraft would delight to preside, but from which all order and all\r\nvirtue would speedily be banished. There is no form of human excellence\r\nbefore which we bow with profounder deference than that which appears in\r\na delicate woman, adorned with the inward graces and devoted to the\r\npeculiar duties of her sex; and there is no deformity of human\r\ncharacter from which we turn with deeper loathing than from a woman\r\nforgetful of her nature, and clamorous for the vocation and rights of\r\nmen. It would not be fair to object to the abolitionists the disgusting\r\nand disorganizing opinions of even some of their leading advocates and\r\npublications, did they not continue to patronize those publications, and\r\nwere not these opinions the legitimate consequences of their own\r\nprinciples. Their women do but apply their own method of dealing with\r\nScripture to another case. This no inconsiderable portion of the party\r\nhave candor enough to acknowledge, and are therefore prepared to abide\r\nthe result.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] Lev. xxv. 44, 45, 56.\r\n\r\n[164] Lev. xxv. 44, 45, 46.\r\n\r\n[165] Exod. xxi. 20, 21.\r\n\r\n[166] Exod. xxi. 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[167] Deut. xxiii. 15, 16.\r\n\r\n[168] Moses Stewart, a divine of Massachusetts, who had devoted a long\r\nand laborious life to the interpretation of Scripture, and who was by no\r\nmeans a friend to the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\n[169] Speech in the Metropolitan Theatre, 1855.\r\n\r\n[170] Speech at the Metropolitan Theatre, 1855.\r\n\r\n[171] Fools may hope to escape responsibility by such a cry.

It is under this point of view, or with reference to the\r\nhighest good of the governed, that we now proceed to consider the\r\ninstitution of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe way is open and clear for this view of the subject.

On the other\r\nhand, if we mistake not, it has been most clearly shown that the\r\ndoctrines and practices of the abolitionist are at war with the most\r\nexplicit words of God, as well as with the most unquestionable\r\nprinciples of political ethics. Hence, without the least disrespect to\r\nthe eternal principles of right, we may now proceed to subject his\r\ndoctrines to the only remaining test of political truth, namely, _to the\r\ntest of experience_. Having examined the internal qualities of the tree\r\nand found them bad, we may now proceed to inquire if \"its fruits\" be not\r\npoison. And if the sober lessons of history, if the infallible records\r\nof experience, be found in perfect harmony with the conclusions of\r\nreason and of revelation, then shall we not be triply justified in\r\npronouncing abolitionism a social and a moral curse?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ I. _The Question._\r\n\r\nHere, at the outset, we may throw aside a mass of useless verbiage, with\r\nwhich our inquiry is usually encumbered. We are eternally told that\r\nKentucky has fallen behind Ohio, and Virginia behind Pennsylvania,\r\nbecause their energies have been crippled, and their prosperity\r\nover-clouded, by the institution of slavery. Now, it is of no importance\r\nto our argument that we should either deny the fact, or the explanation\r\nwhich is given of it by abolitionists. If the question were, whether\r\nslavery should be introduced among us, or into any non-slaveholding\r\nState, then such facts and explanations would be worthy of our notice.\r\nThen such an appeal to experience would be relevant to the point in\r\ndispute. But such is not the question. We are not called upon to decide\r\nwhether slavery shall be established in our midst or not. This question\r\nhas been decided for us. Slavery--as every body knows--was forced upon\r\nthe colonies by the arbitrary and despotic rule of Great Britain, and\r\nthat, too, against the earnest remonstrances of our ancestors. The thing\r\nhas been done. The past is beyond our control. It is fixed and\r\nunalterable. The only inquiry which remains for us now is, whether the\r\nslavery which was thus forced upon our ancestors shall be continued, or\r\nwhether it shall be abolished? The question is not what Virginia, or\r\nKentucky, or any other slave State, _might_ have been, but what they\r\nwould be in case slavery were abolished. If abolitionists would speak to\r\nthe point, then let them show us some country in which slavery has been\r\nabolished, and we will abide by the experiment. Fortunately for us, we\r\nneed not look far for such an experiment;--an experiment which has been\r\nmade, not upon mere chattels or brutes, but upon the social and moral\r\nwell-being of more than a million of human beings. We refer, of course,\r\nto the emancipation of the slaves in the British colonies. This work, as\r\nevery one knows, was the great vaunted achievement of British\r\nabolitionists. Here, then, we may see their philosophy--if philosophy it\r\nmay be called--\"teaching by example.\" Here we may see and taste the\r\nfruits of abolitionism, ere we conclude to grow them upon our own soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II. _Emancipation in the British Colonies._\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely in the power of human language to describe the\r\nenthusiastic delight with which the abolitionists, both in England and\r\nin America, were inspired by the spectacle of West India Emancipation.\r\nWe might easily adduce a hundred illustrations of the almost frantic joy\r\nwith which it intoxicated their brains. We shall, however, for the sake\r\nof brevity, confine our attention to a single example,--which will, at\r\nthe same time, serve to show, not only how wild the abolitionist himself\r\nwas, but also how indignant he became that others were not equally\r\ndisposed to part with their sober senses. \"The prevalent state of\r\nfeeling,\" said Dr. Channing in 1840, \"in the free States in regard to\r\nslavery is indifference--an indifference strengthened by the notion of\r\ngreat difficulties attending the subject. The fact is painful, but the\r\ntruth should be spoken. The majority of the people, even yet, care\r\nlittle about the matter. A painful proof of this insensibility was\r\nfurnished about a year and a half ago, when the English West Indies were\r\nemancipated. An event surpassing this in moral grandeur is not recorded\r\nin history. In one day, probably seven hundred thousand of human beings\r\nwere rescued from bondage to full, unqualified freedom. The\r\nconsciousness of wrongs, in so many breasts, was exchanged into\r\nrapturous, grateful joy. What shouts of thanksgiving broke forth from\r\nthose liberated crowds! What new sanctity and strength were added to the\r\ndomestic ties! What new hopes opened on future generations! The crowning\r\nglory of this day was the fact that the work of emancipation was wholly\r\ndue to the principles of Christianity. The West Indies were freed, not\r\nby force, or human policy, but by the reverence of a great people for\r\njustice and humanity. The men who began and carried on this cause were\r\nChristian philanthropists; and they prevailed by spreading their own\r\nspirit through a nation. In this respect, the emancipation of the West\r\nIndies was a grander work than the redemption of the Israelites from\r\nbondage. This was accomplished by force, by outward miracles, by the\r\nviolence of the elements. That was achieved by love, by moral power, by\r\nGod, working, not in the stormy seas, but in the depths of the human\r\nheart. And how was this day of emancipation--one of the most blessed\r\ndays that ever dawned upon the earth--received in this country? While in\r\ndistant England a thrill of gratitude and joy pervaded thousands and\r\nmillions, we, the neighbors of the West Indies, and who boast of our\r\nlove of liberty, saw the sun of that day rise and set with hardly a\r\nthought of the scenes on which it was pouring its joyful light. The\r\ngreater part of our newspapers did not refer to the event. The great\r\nmajority of the people had forgotten it. Such was the testimony we gave\r\nto our concern for the poor slave; and is it from discussions of slavery\r\namong such a people that the country is to be overturned?\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the glowing expectations of the abolitionists. It now remains\r\nto be seen whether they were true prophets, or merely \"blind leaders of\r\nthe blind.\" Be that as it may, for the present we cannot agree with Dr.\r\nChanning, that the good people of the free States were insincere in\r\nboasting of their \"love of liberty,\" because they did not go into\r\nraptures over so fearful an experiment before they had some little time\r\nto see how it would work. They did, no doubt, most truly and profoundly\r\nlove liberty. But then they had some reason to suspect, perhaps, that\r\nliberty may be one thing, and abolitionism quite another. Liberty, they\r\nknew, was a thing of light and love; but as for abolitionism, it was,\r\nfor all they knew, a demon of destruction. Hence they would wait, and\r\nsee. We do well to rejoice at once, exclaims Dr. Channing. If a\r\nman-child is born into the world, says he, do we wait to read his future\r\nlife ere we rejoice at his birth? Ah, no! But then, perhaps, this\r\noffspring of abolitionism is no man-child at all. It may, for aught we\r\nknow, be an abortion of night and darkness merely. Hence, we shall wait,\r\nand mark his future course, ere we rend the air with shouts that he is\r\nborn at last.\r\n\r\nThis man-child, or this monster, is now seventeen years and four months\r\nold. His character is developed, and fixed for life. We may now read\r\nhis history, written by impartial men, and determine for ourselves,\r\nwhether it justifies the bright and boundless hopes of the\r\nabolitionists, or the \"cold indifference,\" nay, the suspicions and the\r\nfears, of the good people of the free States.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin with Jamaica, which is by far the largest and most\r\nvaluable of the British West Indies. The very first year after the\r\ncomplete emancipation of the slaves of this island, its prosperity began\r\nto manifest symptoms of decay. As long as it was possible, however, to\r\nfind or invent an explanation of these fearful signs, the abolitionists\r\nremained absolutely blind to the real course of events. In 1839, the\r\nfirst year of complete emancipation, it appeared that the crop of sugar\r\nexported from the island had fallen off no less than eight thousand four\r\nhundred and sixty-six hogsheads. But, then, it was discovered that the\r\nhogsheads had been larger this year than the preceding! It is true,\r\nthere was not exactly any proof that larger hogsheads had been used all\r\nover the island, but it was rumored; and the rumor was, of course,\r\neagerly swallowed by the abolitionists.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, it was quite certain that the free negroes had eaten more\r\nsugar than while they were slaves, which helped mightily to account for\r\nthe great diminution in the exports of the article. No one could deny\r\nthis. It is certain, that if the free negroes only devoured sugar as\r\neagerly as such floating conjectures were gulped down by the\r\nabolitionists, the whole phenomenon needed no other cause for its\r\nperfect explanation. It never once occured, however, to these reasoners\r\nto imagine that the decrease in the amount of rum exported from another\r\nisland _might_ be owing to the circumstance that the free blacks had\r\nswallowed a little more of that article as well as of sugar. On the\r\ncontrary, this fact was held up as a most conclusive and triumphant\r\nproof that the free negroes had not only become temperate themselves,\r\nbut also so virtuous that they scorned to produce such an article to\r\npoison their fellow-men. The English abolitionists who rejoiced at such\r\na reflection were, it must be confessed, standing on rather delicate\r\nground. For if such an inference proved any thing, it proved that the\r\nblacks of the island in question had, at one single bound, passed from\r\nthe depths of degradation to an exaltation of virtue far above their\r\nemancipators, the English people themselves; since these, as every\r\nreader of history knows, not only enforced the culture of opium in\r\nIndia, but also absolutely compelled the poor Chinese to receive it at\r\nthe mouth of the cannon!\r\n\r\nIt also appears that, for 1839, the amount of coffee exported had fallen\r\noff 38,554 cwt., or about one third of the whole amount of the preceding\r\nyear. \"The coffee is a very uncertain crop,\" said a noted English\r\nemancipationist, in view of this startling fact, \"and the deficiency, on\r\nthe comparison of these two years, is not greater, I believe, than has\r\noften occurred before.\" This is true, for a drought or a hurricane had\r\nbefore created quite as great a deficiency. But while the fact is true,\r\nit only proves that the first year of emancipation was no worse on the\r\ncoffee crop than a drought or a hurricane.\r\n\r\n\"We should also remember,\" says this zealous abolitionist, \"that, both\r\nin sugar and coffee, the profit to the planter may be increased by the\r\nsaving of expense, even where the produce is diminished.\" Such a thing,\r\nwe admit, is possible; it _may_ be true. But _in point of fact_, as we\r\nshall soon see, the expense was increased, while the crop was\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nBut after every possible explanation, even Dr. Channing and Mr. Gurney\r\nwere bound to admit \"that some decrease has taken place in both the\r\narticles, in connection with the change of system.\" They also admitted\r\nthat \"so far as this decrease of produce is connected with the change of\r\nsystem, _it is obviously to be traced to a corresponding decrease in the\r\nquantity of labor_.\"\r\n\r\nMay we not suppose, then, that here the ingenuity of man is at an end,\r\nand the truth begins to be allowed to make its appearance? By no means.\r\nFor here \"comes the critical question,\"--says Mr. Gurney, \"the real\r\nturning point. To what is this decrease in the quantity of labor owing?\r\nI answer deliberately but without reserve, '_Mainly_ to causes which\r\nclass under slavery and not under freedom.' It is, for the most part,\r\nthe result of those impolitic attempts to force the labor of freemen\r\nwhich have disgusted the peasantry, and have led to the desertion of\r\nmany of the estates.\"\r\n\r\nNow suppose this were the case, is it not the business, is it not the\r\nduty, of the legislator to consider the passions, the prejudices, and\r\nthe habits of those for whom he legislates? Indeed, if he overlook\r\nthese, is he not a reckless experimenter rather than a wise statesman?\r\nIf he legislates, not for man as he _is_, but for man as he _ought to\r\nbe_, is he not a political dreamer rather than a sound philosopher?\r\n\r\nThe abolitionist not only closed his eyes on every appearance of decline\r\nin the prosperity of the West Indies, he also seized with avidity every\r\nindication of the successful operation of his scheme, and magnified it\r\nboth to himself and to the world. He made haste, in particular, to paint\r\nin the most glowing colors the rising prosperity of Jamaica.[175] His\r\nnarrative was hailed with eager delight by abolitionists in all parts of\r\nthe civilized world. It is a pity, we admit, to spoil so fine a story,\r\nor to put a damper on so much enthusiasm. But the truth, especially in a\r\ncase like the present, should be told. While, then, to the enchanted\r\nimagination of the abolitionist, the wonderful industry of the freed\r\nnegroes and the exuberant bounty of nature were concurring to bring\r\nabout a paradise in the island of Jamaica, the dark stream of\r\nemancipation was, in reality, undermining its prosperity and glory. We\r\nshall now proceed to adduce the evidence of this melancholy fact, which\r\nhas in a few short years become so abundant and so overwhelming, that\r\neven the most blind and obstinate must feel its force.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the immense sources of wealth to be found in Jamaica,\r\nan intelligent eye-witness says: \"Such are some of the natural resources\r\nof this dilapidated and poverty-stricken country. Capable as it is of\r\nproducing almost every thing, and actually producing nothing which might\r\nnot become a staple with a proper application of capital and skill, its\r\ninhabitants are miserably poor, and daily sinking deeper into the utter\r\nhelplessness of abject want.\r\n\r\n          \"'Magnas inter opes inops.'\r\n\r\n\"Shipping has deserted her ports; her magnificent plantations of sugar\r\nand coffee are running to weeds; her private dwellings are falling to\r\ndecay; the comforts and luxuries which belong to industrial prosperity\r\nhave been cut off, one by one, from her inhabitants; and the day, I\r\nthink, is at hand when there will be none left to represent the wealth,\r\nintelligence, and hospitality for which the Jamaica planter was once\r\ndistinguished.\"[176]\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" says Mr. Carey, \"to read Mr. Bigelow's volume,\r\nwithout arriving at the conclusion that the freedom granted to the negro\r\nhas had little effect except that of enabling him to live at the expense\r\nof the planter so long as any thing remained. Sixteen years of freedom\r\ndid not appear to its author to have 'advanced the dignity of labor or\r\nof the laboring classes one particle,' while it had ruined the\r\nproprietors of the land, and thus great damage had been done to the one\r\nclass without benefit of any kind to the other.\r\n\r\nFrom a statistical table, published in August, 1853, it appears, says\r\none of our northern journals, that, since 1846, \"the number of sugar\r\nestates on the island that have been totally abandoned amounts to one\r\nhundred and sixty-eight, and the number partially abandoned to\r\nsixty-three; the value of which two hundred and thirty-one estates was\r\nassessed, in 1841, at £1,655,140, or nearly eight millions and a half of\r\ndollars. Within the same period two hundred and twenty-three\r\ncoffee-plantations have been totally, and twenty partially, abandoned,\r\nthe assessed value of which was, in 1841, £500,000, or two millions and\r\na half of dollars; and of cattle-pens, (grazing farms,) one hundred and\r\ntwenty-two have been totally, and ten partially, abandoned, the value of\r\nwhich was a million and a half of dollars. The aggregate value of these\r\nsix hundred and six estates, which have been thus ruined and abandoned\r\nin the island of Jamaica, within the last seven or eight years, amounted\r\nby the regular assessments, ten years since, to the sum of nearly two\r\nand a half millions of pounds sterling, or twelve and a half millions of\r\ndollars.\"[177]\r\n\r\nIn relation to Jamaica, another witness says: \"The marks of decay\r\nabound. Neglected fields, crumbling houses, fragmentary fences,\r\nnoiseless machinery--these are common sights, and soon become familiar\r\nto observation. I sometimes rode for miles in succession over fertile\r\nground, which used to be cultivated, and which is now lying waste. So\r\nrapidly has cultivation retrograded, and the wild luxuriance of nature\r\nreplaced the conveniences of art, that parties still inhabiting these\r\ndesolated districts have sometimes, in the strong language of a speaker\r\nat Kingston, 'to seek about the bush to find the entrance into their\r\nhouses.'\r\n\r\n\"The towns present a spectacle no less gloomy. A great part of Kingston\r\nwas destroyed, some years ago, by an extensive conflagration: yet\r\nmultitudes of the houses which escaped that visitation are standing\r\nempty, though the population is little, if at all, diminished. The\r\nexplanation is obvious. Persons who have nothing, and can no longer keep\r\nup their domestic establishments, take refuge in the abodes of others,\r\nwhere some means of subsistence are still left; and in the absence of\r\nany discernible trade or occupation, the lives of crowded thousands\r\nappear to be preserved from day to day by a species of miracle. The most\r\nbusy thoroughfares of former times have now almost the quietude of a\r\nSabbath.\r\n\r\n\"'The finest land in the world,' says Mr. Bigelow, 'may be had at any\r\nprice, and almost for the asking.' Labor 'receives no compensation, and\r\nthe product of labor does not seem to know how to find the way to\r\nmarket.'\"[178]\r\n\r\nFrom the report made in 1849, and signed by various missionaries, the\r\nmoral and religious state of the island appears no less gloomy than its\r\nscenes of poverty and distress. The following extract from that report\r\nwe copy from Mr. Carey's \"Slave Trade, Domestic and Foreign:\"--\r\n\r\n\"Missionary efforts in Jamaica are beset at the present time with many\r\nand great discouragements. Societies at home have withdrawn or\r\ndiminished the amount of assistance afforded by them to chapels and\r\nschools throughout this island. The prostrate condition of its\r\nagriculture and commerce disables its own population from doing as much\r\nas formerly for maintaining the worship of God and the tuition of the\r\nyoung, and induces numbers of negro laborers to retire from estates\r\nwhich have been thrown up, to seek the means of subsistence in the\r\nmountains, where they are removed in general from moral training and\r\nsuperintendence. The consequences of this state of matters are very\r\ndisastrous. Not a few missionaries and teachers--often struggling with\r\ndifficulties which they could not overcome--have returned to Europe, and\r\nothers are preparing to follow them. Chapels and schools are abandoned,\r\nor they have passed into the hands of very incompetent instructors.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot dwell upon each of the West India Islands. Some of these have\r\nnot suffered so much as others; but while some, from well-known causes,\r\nhave been partially exempt from the evils of emancipation, all have\r\nsuffered to a fearful extent. This, as we shall now show, is most amply\r\nestablished by English authorities.\r\n\r\nMr. Bigelow, whose \"Notes on Jamaica in 1850\" we have noticed, is an\r\nAmerican writer; a Northern man; and, it is said, by no means a friend\r\nto the institution of slavery. It is certain that Mr. Robert Baird, from\r\nwhom we shall now quote, is not only a subject of Great Britain, but\r\nalso a most enthusiastic advocate of \"the glorious Act of British\r\nEmancipation.\" But although he admires that act, yet, on visiting the\r\nWest Indies for his health, he could not fail to be struck with the\r\nappalling scenes of distress there exhibited. In describing these, his\r\nobject is not to reflect shame on the misguided philanthropy of Great\r\nBritain; but only to urge the adoption of other measures, in order to\r\nrescue the West Indies from the utter ruin and desolation which must\r\notherwise soon overtake them. We might easily adduce many impressive\r\nextracts from his work; but, for the sake of brevity, we shall confine\r\nour attention to one or two passages.\r\n\r\n\"Hope,\" says Mr. Baird, \"delights to brighten the prospects of the\r\nfuture; and thus it is that the British West Indian planter goes on from\r\nyear to year, struggling against his downward progress, and still hoping\r\nthat something may yet turn up to retrieve his ruined fortunes. But all\r\ndo not struggle on. Many have given in, and many more can and will\r\nconfirm the statement of a venerable friend of my own--a gentleman high\r\nin office in one of the islands above-mentioned--who, when showing me\r\nhis own estate and sugar-works, assured me, that for above a quarter of\r\na century they had yielded him nearly £2000 per annum; and that now,\r\ndespite all his efforts and improvements, (which were many,) he could\r\nscarcely manage to make the cultivation pay itself. Instances of this\r\nkind might be multiplied till the reader was tired, and even heart-sick,\r\nof such details. But what need of such? Is it not notorious? Has it not\r\nbeen proved by the numerous failures that have taken place of late years\r\namong our most extensive West Indian merchants? Are not the reports of\r\nalmost all the governors of our colonial possessions filled with\r\nstatements to the effect that great depreciation of property has taken\r\nplace in all and each of our West Indian colonies, and that great has\r\nbeen the distress consequent thereupon? These governors are, of course,\r\nall of them imbued, to some extent, with the ministerial policy--at\r\nleast it is reasonable to assume that they are so. At all events,\r\nwhether they are so or not, their position almost necessitates their\r\ndoing their utmost to carry out, with success, the ministerial views and\r\ngeneral policy. To embody the substance of the answer given by a\r\ntalented lieutenant-governor, in my own hearing, to an address which set\r\nforth, somewhat strongly, the ruined prospects and wasted fortunes of\r\nthe colonists under his government: 'It must, or it ought to be, the\r\nobject and the desire of every governor or lieutenant-governor in the\r\nBritish West Indian Islands, to disappoint and stultify, if he can, the\r\nprognostications of coming ruin with which the addresses he receives\r\nfrom time to time are continually charged?' Yet what say these\r\ngovernors? Do not the reports of one and all of them confirm the above\r\nstatement as to the deplorable state of distress to which the West\r\nIndian planters in the British colonies are reduced?\"[179]\r\n\r\nAgain, he says: \"That the British West Indian colonists have been loudly\r\ncomplaining that they are ruined, is a fact so generally acknowledged,\r\nthat the very loudness and frequency of the complaint has been made a\r\nreason for disregarding or undervaluing the grounds of it. That the West\r\nIndians are always grumbling is an observation often heard; and, no\r\ndoubt, it is very true that they are so. But let any one who thinks that\r\nthe extent and clamor of the complaint exceeds the magnitude of the\r\ndistress which has called it forth, go to the West Indies and judge for\r\nhimself. Let him see with his own eyes the neglected and abandoned\r\nestates,--the uncultivated fields, fast hurrying back into a state of\r\nnature, with all the speed of tropical luxuriance--the dismantled and\r\nsilent machinery, the crumbling walls, and deserted mansions, which are\r\nfamiliar sights in most of the British West Indian colonies. Let him,\r\nthen, transport himself to the Spanish islands of Porto Rico and Cuba,\r\nand witness the life and activity which in these slave colonies prevail.\r\nLet him observe for himself the activity of the slavers--the\r\nimprovements daily making in the cultivation of the fields and in the\r\nprocesses carried on at the Ingenios or sugar-mills--and _the general\r\nindescribable air of thriving and prosperity which surrounds the\r\nwhole_,--and then let him come back to England and say, if he honestly\r\ncan, that the British West Indian planters and proprietors are\r\ngrumblers, who complain without adequate cause.\"[180]\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has shown no little solicitude to ascertain the real state\r\nof things in her West India colonies. For this purpose, she appointed,\r\nin 1842, a select committee, consisting of some of the most prominent\r\nmembers of Parliament, with Lord Stanley at their head. In 1848, another\r\ncommittee was appointed by her, with Lord George Bentinck as its\r\nchairman, to inquire into the condition of her Majesty's East and West\r\nIndia possessions and the Mauritius, and to consider whether any\r\nmeasures could be adopted for their relief. The report of both\r\ncommittees show, beyond all doubt, that unexampled distress existed in\r\nthe colonies. The report of 1848 declares: \"That many estates in the\r\nBritish West India colonies have been already abandoned, that many more\r\nare in the course of abandonment, and that from this cause a very\r\nserious diminution is to be apprehended in the total amount of\r\nproduction. That the first effect of this diminution will be an increase\r\nin the price of sugar, and the ultimate effect a greater extension to\r\nthe growth of sugar in slave countries, and a greater impetus to slavery\r\nand the slave-trade.\" From the same report, we also learn that the\r\nprosperity of the Mauritius, no less than that of the West India\r\nIslands, had suffered a fearful blight, in consequence of the \"glorious\r\nact of emancipation.\"\r\n\r\nA third commission was appointed, in 1850, to inquire into the condition\r\nand prospects of British Guiana. Lord Stanley, in his second letter to\r\nMr. Gladstone, the Secretary of the British colonies, has furnished us\r\nwith the following extracts from the report of this committee:--\r\n\r\n\"Of Guiana generally they say--'It would be but a melancholy task to\r\ndwell upon the misery and ruin which so alarming a change must have\r\noccasioned to the proprietary body; but your commissioners feel\r\nthemselves called upon to notice the effects which this wholsale\r\nabandonment of property has produced upon the colony at large. Where\r\nwhole districts are fast relapsing into bush, and occasional patches of\r\nprovisions around the huts of village settlers are all that remain to\r\ntell of once flourishing estates, it is not to be wondered at that the\r\nmost ordinary marks of civilization are rapidly disappearing, and that\r\nin many districts of the colony all travelling communication by land\r\nwill soon become utterly impracticable.'\r\n\r\n\"Of the Abary district:--'Your commission find that the line of road is\r\nnearly impassable, and that a long succession of formerly cultivated\r\nestates presents now a series of pestilent swamps, overrun with bush,\r\nand productive of malignant fevers.'\r\n\r\n\"Nor are matters,\" says Lord Stanley, \"much better further south.\r\n\r\n\"'Proceeding still lower down, your commissioners find that the public\r\nroads and bridges are in such a condition that the few estates still\r\nremaining on the upper west bank of Mahaica Creek are completely cut\r\noff, save in the very dry season; and that with regard to the whole\r\ndistrict, unless something be done very shortly, travelling by land will\r\nentirely cease. In such a state of things it cannot be wondered at that\r\nthe herdsman has a formidable enemy to encounter in the jaguar and other\r\nbeasts of prey, and that the keeping of cattle is attended with\r\nconsiderable loss from the depredations committed by these animals.'\r\n\r\n\"It may be worth noticing,\" continues Lord Stanley, \"that this\r\ndistrict--now overrun with wild beasts of the forest--was formerly the\r\nvery garden of the colony. The estates touched one another along the\r\nwhole line of the road, leaving no interval of uncleared land.\r\n\r\n\"The east coast, which is next mentioned by the commissioners, is better\r\noff. Properties, once of immense value, had there been bought at nominal\r\nprices; and the one railroad of Guiana passing through that tract, a\r\ncomparatively industrious population--composed of former laborers on the\r\nline--enabled the planters still to work these to some profit. Even of\r\nthis favored spot, however, they report that it 'feels most severely the\r\nwant of continuous labor.'\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners next visit the east bank of the Demerara River, thus\r\ndescribed:--\r\n\r\n\"'Proceeding up the east bank of the river Demerara, the generally\r\nprevailing features of ruin and distress are everywhere perceptible.\r\nRoads and bridges almost impassable are fearfully significant exponents\r\nof the condition of the plantations which they traverse; and Canal No.\r\n3, once covered with plantains and coffee, presents now a scene of\r\nalmost total desolation.'\r\n\r\n\"Crossing to the west side, they find prospects somewhat brighter: 'A\r\nfew estates, are still 'keeping up a cultivation worthy of better\r\ntimes.' But this prosperous neighborhood is not extensive, and the next\r\npicture presented to our notice is less agreeable:--\r\n\r\n\"'Ascending the river still higher, your commissioners learn that the\r\ndistrict between Hobaboe Creek and \"Stricken Heuvel\" contained, in 1829,\r\neight sugar and five coffee and plantain estates, and now there remain\r\nbut three in sugar, and four partially cultivated with plantains, by\r\npetty settlers; while the roads, with one or two exceptions, are in a\r\nstate of utter abandonment. Here, as on the opposite bank of the river,\r\nhordes of squatters have located themselves, who avoid all communication\r\nwith Europeans, and have seemingly given themselves up altogether to the\r\nrude pleasures of a completely savage life.'\r\n\r\n\"The west coast of Demerara--the only part of the country which still\r\nremains unvisited--is described as showing _only_ a diminution of fifty\r\nper cent. upon its produce of sugar; and with this fact the evidence\r\nconcludes as to one of the three sections into which the colony is\r\ndivided. Does Demerara stand alone in its misfortunes?\r\n\r\n\"Again hear the report:--'If the present state of the county of Demerara\r\naffords cause for deep apprehension, your commissioners find that\r\nEssequibo has retrograded to a still more alarming extent. In fact,\r\nunless a large and speedy supply of labor be obtained to cultivate the\r\ndeserted fields of this once flourishing district, there is great reason\r\nto fear that it will relapse into total abandonment.'\r\n\r\n\"Describing another portion of the colony--they say of one district,\r\n'Unless a fresh supply of labor be very soon obtained, there is every\r\nreason to fear that it will become completely abandoned.' Of a second,\r\n'speedy immigration alone can save this island from total ruin.' 'The\r\nprostrate condition of this once beautiful part of the coast,' are the\r\nwords which begin another paragraph, describing another tract of\r\ncountry. Of a fourth, 'the proprietors on this coast seem to be keeping\r\nup a hopeless struggle against approaching ruin.' Again, 'the once\r\nfamous Arabian coast, so long the boast of the colony, presents now but\r\na mournful picture of departed prosperity. Here were formerly situated\r\nsome of the finest estates in the country, and a large resident body of\r\nproprietors lived in the district, and freely expended their incomes on\r\nthe spot whence they derived them.' Once more, 'the lower part of the\r\ncoast, after passing Devonshire Castle, to the river Pomeroon, presents\r\na scene of almost total desolation.' Such is Essequibo!\r\n\r\n\"Berbice,\" says Lord Stanley, \"has fared no better. Its rural population\r\namounts to 18,000. Of these, 12,000 have withdrawn from the estates, and\r\nmostly from the neighborhood of the white man, to enjoy a savage freedom\r\nof ignorance and idleness, beyond the reach of example and sometimes of\r\ncontrol. But on the condition of the negro I shall dwell more at length\r\nhereafter; at present it is the state of property with which I have to\r\ndo. What are the districts which together form the county of Berbice?\r\nThe Corentyne coast--the Canje Creek--east and west banks of the Berbice\r\nRiver--and the west coast, where, however, cotton was formerly the chief\r\narticle produced. To each of these respectively the following passages,\r\nquoted in order, apply:--\r\n\r\n\"'The abandoned plantations on this coast,[181] which, if capital and\r\nlabor could be procured, might easily be made very productive, are\r\neither wholly deserted, or else appropriated by hordes of squatters, who\r\nof course are unable to keep up at their own expense the public roads\r\nand bridges; and consequently all communication by land between the\r\nCorentyne and New Amsterdam is nearly at an end. The roads are\r\nimpassable for horses or carriages, while for foot passengers they are\r\nextremely dangerous. The number of villages in this deserted region must\r\nbe upward of 2500, and as the country abounds with fish and game, they\r\nhave no difficulty in making a subsistence. In fact, the Corentyne coast\r\nis fast relapsing into a state of nature.'\r\n\r\n\"'Canje Creek was formerly considered a flourishing district of the\r\ncounty, and numbered on its east bank seven sugar and three coffee\r\nestates, and on its west bank eight estates, of which two were in sugar\r\nand six in coffee, making a total of eighteen plantations. The coffee\r\ncultivation has long since been entirely abandoned, and of the sugar\r\nestates but eight still now remain. They are suffering severely for want\r\nof labor, and being supported principally by African and Coolie\r\nimmigrants, it is much to be feared that if the latter leave and claim\r\ntheir return passages to India, a great part of the district will\r\nbecome abandoned.'\r\n\r\n\"Under present circumstances, so gloomy is the condition of affairs\r\nhere,[182] that the two gentlemen whom your commissioners have examined\r\nwith respect to this district, both concur in predicting \"its slow but\r\nsure approximation to the condition in which civilized man first found\r\nit.\"'\r\n\r\n\"'A district[183] that in 1829 gave employment to 3635 registered\r\nslaves, but at the present moment there are not more than 600 laborers\r\nat work on the few estates still in cultivation, although it is\r\nestimated there are upward of 2000 people idling in villages of their\r\nown. The roads are in many parts several feet under water and perfect\r\nswamps, while in some places the bridges are wanting altogether. In fact\r\nthe whole district is fast becoming a total wilderness, with the\r\nexception of the one or two estates which yet continue to struggle on,\r\nand which are hardly accessible now but by water.'\r\n\r\n\"'Except in some of the best villages,[184] they care not for back or\r\nfront dams to keep off the water; their side-lines are disregarded, and\r\nconsequently the drainage is gone, while in many instances the public\r\nroad is so completely flooded that canoes have to be used as a means of\r\ntransit. The Africans are unhappily following the example of the Creoles\r\nin this district, and buying land on which they settle in contented\r\nidleness; and your commissioners cannot view instances like these\r\nwithout the deepest alarm, for if this pernicious habit of squatting is\r\nallowed to extend to the immigrants also, there is no hope for the\r\ncolony.'\"[185]\r\n\r\nWe might fill a volume with extracts to the same effect. We might in\r\nlike manner point to other regions, especially to Guatemala, to the\r\nBritish colony on the southern coast of Africa, and to the island of\r\nHayti, in all of which emancipation has been followed by precisely\r\nsimilar results. But we must hasten to consider how it is that\r\nemancipation has wrought all this ruin and desolation. In the mean time,\r\nwe shall conclude this section in the ever-memorable words of Alison,\r\nthe historian: \"The negroes,\" says he, \"who, in a state of slavery, were\r\ncomfortable and prosperous beyond any peasantry in the world, and\r\nrapidly approaching the condition of the most opulent serfs of Europe,\r\n_have been by the act of emancipation irretrievably consigned to a state\r\nof barbarism_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ III. _The manner in which emancipation has ruined the British\r\nColonies._\r\n\r\nBy the act of emancipation, Great Britain paralyzed the right arm of her\r\ncolonial industry. The laborer would not work except occasionally, and\r\nthe planter was ruined. The morals of the negro disappeared with his\r\nindustry, and he speedily retraced his steps toward his original\r\nbarbarism. All this had been clearly foretold. \"Emancipation,\" says Dr.\r\nChanning in 1840, \"was resisted on the ground that the slave, if\r\nrestored to his rights, _would fall into idleness and vagrancy, and even\r\nrelapse into barbarism_.\"\r\n\r\nThis was predicted by the West Indian planters, who certainly had a good\r\nopportunity to know something of the character of the negro, whether\r\nbond or free. But who could suppose for a moment that an enlightened\r\nabolitionist would listen to slaveholders? His response was, that \"their\r\nunhappy position as slaveholders had robbed them of their reason and\r\nblunted their moral sense.\" Precisely the same thing had been foretold\r\nby the Calhouns and the Clays of this country. But they, too, were\r\nunfortunately slaveholders, and, consequently, so completely \"sunk in\r\nmoral darkness,\" that their testimony was not entitled to credit. The\r\ncalmest, the profoundest, the wisest statesman of Great Britain likewise\r\nforewarned the agitators of the desolation and the woes they were about\r\nto bring upon the West Indies. But the madness of the day would confide\r\nin no wisdom except its own, and listen to no testimony except to the\r\nclamor of fanatics. Hence the frightful experiment was made, and, as we\r\nhave seen, the prediction of the anti-abolitionist has been fulfilled to\r\nthe very letter.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this downward tendency in the British colonies is now\r\nperfectly apparent to all who have eyes to see. On this point, the two\r\ncommittees above referred to both concur in the same conclusion. The\r\ncommittee of 1842 declare, \"that the principal causes of this diminished\r\nproduction, and consequent distress, are the great difficulty which has\r\nbeen experienced by the planters in obtaining _steady_ and _continuous_\r\nlabor, and the high rate of remuneration which they give for even the\r\n_broken_ and _indifferent_ work which they are able to procure.\"\r\n\r\nThe cry of the abolitionist has been changed. At first--even before the\r\nexperiment was more than a year old--he insisted that the industry of\r\nthe freed black was working wonders in the British colonies. In the West\r\nIndies, in particular, he assured us that the freed negro would do \"an\r\ninfinity of work for wages.\"[186] Though he had been on the islands, and\r\nhad had an opportunity to see for himself, he boasted that \"the old\r\nnotion that the negro is, by constitution, a lazy creature, who will do\r\nno work at all except by compulsion, _is now forever exploded_.\"[187] He\r\neven declared, that the free negro \"understands his interest as well as\r\na Yankee.\"[188] These confident statements, made by an eye-witness, were\r\nhailed by the abolitionists as conclusive proof that the experiment was\r\nworking admirably. \"The great truth has come out,\" says Dr. Channing,\r\n\"that the hopes of the most sanguine advocates of emancipation have been\r\nrealized--if not surpassed--by the West Indies.\" What! the negro become\r\nidle, indeed! \"He is more likely,\" says the enchanted doctor, \"to fall\r\ninto the civilized man's cupidity than into the filth and sloth of the\r\nsavage.\" But all these magnificent boasts were quite premature. A few\r\nshort years have sufficed to demonstrate that the deluded authors of\r\nthem, who had so lamentably failed to predict the future, could not even\r\nread the present.\r\n\r\nTheir boasts are now exploded. Their former hopes are blasted; and their\r\ncry is changed. The song now is,--\"Well, suppose the negroes will not\r\nwork: they are FREE! They can now do as they list, and there is no man\r\nto hinder.\" Ah, yes! they can now, at their own sweet will, stretch\r\nthemselves \"under their gracefully-waving groves,\" and be lulled to\r\nsleep amid the sound of waterfalls and the song of birds.\r\n\r\nSuch, precisely, is the paradise for which the negro sighs, except that\r\nhe does not care for the waterfalls and the birds. But it should be\r\nremarked, that when sinful man was driven from the only Paradise that\r\nearth has ever seen, he was doomed to eat his bread in the sweat of his\r\nbrow. This doom he cannot reverse. Let him make of life--as the Haytien\r\nnegroes do--\"one long day of unprofitable ease,\"[189] and he may dream\r\nof Paradise, or the abolitionists may dream for him. But while he\r\ndreams, the laws of nature are sternly at their work. Indolence benumbs\r\nhis feeble intellect, and inflames his passions. Poverty and want are\r\ncreeping on him. Temptation is surrounding him; and vice, with all her\r\nmotley train, is winding fast her deadly coils around his very soul, and\r\nmaking him the devil's slave, to do his work upon the earth. Thus, the\r\nblossoms of his paradise are _fine words_, and its fruits are _death_.\r\n\r\n\"If but two hours' labor per day,\" says Theodore Parker, \"are necessary\r\nfor the support of each colored man, I know not why he should toil\r\nlonger.\" You know not, then, why the colored man should work more than\r\ntwo hours a day? Neither does the colored man himself. You know not why\r\nhe should have any higher or nobler aim in life than to supply his few,\r\npressing, animal wants? Neither does he. You know not why he should\r\nthink of the future, or provide for the necessities of old age? Neither\r\ndoes he. You know not why he should take thought for seasons of\r\nsickness? Neither does he; and hence his child often dies under his own\r\neyes, for the want of medical attendance. You know not that the colored\r\nman, who begins with working only two hours a day, will soon end with\r\nceasing from all regular employment, and live, in the midst of filth, by\r\nstealing or other nefarious means? In one word, you know not why the\r\ncolored man should not live like the brute, in and for the present\r\nmerely--blotting out all the future from his plans of life? If, indeed,\r\nyou really know none of these things, then we beg you will excuse us, if\r\n_we_ do not know why you should assume to teach our senators wisdom;--if\r\nwe do not know why the cobbler should not stick to his last, and all\r\nsuch preachers to their pulpits.[190]\r\n\r\nAbolitionism is decidedly progressive. The time was when Dr. Channing\r\nthought that men should work, and that, if they would not labor from\r\nrational motives, they should be compelled to labor.[191] The time was,\r\nwhen even abolitionists looked upon labor with respect, and regarded it\r\nas merely an obedience to the very first law of nature, or merely a\r\ncompliance with the very first condition of all economic, social, and\r\nmoral well-being. But the times are changed. The exigencies of\r\nabolitionism now require that _manual labor, and the gross material\r\nwealth_ it produces, should be sneeringly spoken of, and great swelling\r\neulogies pronounced on the infinite value of the negro's freedom. For\r\nthis is all he has; and for this, all else has been sacrificed. Thus,\r\nsince abolitionists themselves have been made to see that the freed\r\nnegro--the pet and idol of their hearts--will not work from rational\r\nmotives, then the principles of political economy, and the affairs of\r\nthe world, all must be adjusted to the course _he_ may be pleased to\r\ntake.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we shall notice a passage from Montesquieu, which is\r\nexactly in point. He is often quoted by the abolitionists, but seldom\r\nfairly. It is true, he is exceedingly hostile to slavery _in general_,\r\nand very justly pours ridicule and contempt on some of the arguments\r\nused in favor of the institution. But yet, with all his enthusiastic\r\nlove of liberty,--nay, with his ardent passion for equality,--he saw far\r\ntoo deeply into the true \"Spirit of Laws\" not to perceive that slavery\r\nis, in certain cases, founded on the great principles of political\r\njustice. It is precisely in those cases in which a race or a people will\r\nnot work without being compelled to do so, that he justifies the\r\ninstitution in question. Though warmly and zealously opposed to slavery,\r\nyet he was not bent on sacrificing the good of society to abstractions\r\nor to prejudice. Hence, he could say: \"But as all men are born equal,\r\nslavery must be accounted unnatural, THOUGH IN SOME COUNTRIES IT BE\r\nFOUNDED ON NATURAL REASON; and a wide difference ought to be made\r\nbetwixt such countries, and those in which natural reason rejects it, as\r\nin Europe, where it has been happily abolished.\"[192] Now, if we inquire\r\nin what countries, or under what circumstances, he considered slavery\r\nfounded on natural reason, we may find his answer in a preceding portion\r\nof the same page. It is in those \"countries,\" says he, \"where the excess\r\nof heat enervates the body, and renders men so slothful and dispirited,\r\nthat nothing but the fear of chastisement can oblige them to perform any\r\nlaborious duty,\" etc. Such, as we have seen, is precisely the case with\r\nthe African race in its present condition.\r\n\r\n\"Natural slavery, then,\" he continues, \"is to be limited to some\r\nparticular parts of the world.\"[193] And again: \"Bad laws have made lazy\r\nmen--they have been reduced to slavery because of their laziness.\" The\r\nfirst portion of this remark--that bad laws have made lazy men--is not\r\napplicable to the African race. For they were made lazy, not by bad\r\nlaws, but by the depravity of human nature, in connection and\r\nco-operation with long, long centuries of brutal ignorance and the most\r\nsavage modes of life. But, be the cause of this laziness what it may, it\r\nis sufficient, according to the principles of this great advocate of\r\nhuman freedom and equality, to justify the servitude in which the\r\nprovidence of God has placed the African.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is very hard on lazy men that they should be compelled to\r\nwork. It is for this reason that Montesquieu calls such slavery \"the\r\nmost cruel that is to be found among men;\" by which he evidently means\r\nthat it is the most cruel, though necessary, because those on whom it is\r\nimposed are least inclined to work. If he had only had greater\r\nexperience of negro slavery, the hardship would have seemed far less to\r\nhim. For though the negro is naturally lazy, and too improvident to work\r\nfor himself, he will often labor for a master with a right good will,\r\nand with a loyal devotion to his interests. He is, indeed, often\r\nprepared, and made ready for labor, because he feels that, in his\r\nmaster, he has a protector and a friend.\r\n\r\nBut whether labor be a heavy burden or a light, it must be borne. The\r\ngood of the lazy race, and the good of the society into which they have\r\nbeen thrown, both require them to bear this burden, which is, after all\r\nand at the worst, far lighter than that of a vagabond life. \"Nature\r\ncries aloud,\" says the abolitionist, \"for freedom.\" Nature, we reply,\r\ndemands that man shall work, and her decree must be fulfilled. For ruin,\r\nas we have seen, is the bitter fruit of disobedience to her will.\r\n\r\nIt is now high time that we should notice some of the exalted eulogies\r\nbestowed by abolitionists upon freedom; and also _the kind of freedom_\r\non which these high praises have been so eloquently lavished. This,\r\naccordingly, we shall proceed to do in the following section.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ IV. _The great benefit supposed by American abolitionists to result to\r\nthe freed negroes from the British act of emancipation._\r\n\r\nWe have, in the preceding sections, abundantly seen that the freed\r\ncolored subjects of the British crown are fast relapsing into the most\r\nirretrievable barbarism, while the once flourishing colonies themselves\r\npresent the most appalling scenes of desolation and distress. Surely it\r\nis no wonder that the hurrahing of the English people has ceased. \"At\r\nthe present moment,\" says the London Times for December 1st, 1852, \"if\r\nthere is one thing in the world that the British public do not like to\r\ntalk about, or _even to think about_, it is the condition of the race\r\nfor whom this great effort was made.\" Not so with the abolitionists of\r\nthis country. They still keep up the annual celebration of that great\r\nevent, the act of emancipation, by which, in the language of one of\r\ntheir number, more than half a million of human beings were \"turned from\r\nbrutes into freemen!\"\r\n\r\nIt is the freedom of the negro which they celebrate. Let us look, then,\r\nfor a few moments, into the mysteries of this celebration, and see, if\r\nwe may, the nature of the praises they pour forth in honor of freedom,\r\nand _the kind of freedom on which_ they are so passionately bestowed.\r\n\r\nWe shall not quote from the more insane of the fraternity of\r\nabolitionists, for their wild, raving nonsense would, indeed, be\r\nunworthy of serious refutation. We shall simply notice the language of\r\nDr. Channing, the scholar-like and the eloquent, though visionary,\r\nadvocate of British emancipation. Even as early as 1842, in an address\r\ndelivered on the anniversary of that event, he burst into the following\r\nstrain of impassioned eulogy: \"Emancipation works well, far better than\r\ncould have been anticipated. _To me it could hardly have worked\r\notherwise than well._ It banished _slavery_, that wrong and curse not to\r\nbe borne. It gave _freedom_, the dear birthright of humanity; and had it\r\ndone nothing more, I should have found in it cause for joy. Freedom,\r\nsimple freedom, is 'in my estimation just, far prized above all price.'\r\n_I do not stop to ask if the emancipated are better fed and clothed than\r\nformerly._ THEY ARE FREE; AND THAT ONE WORD CONTAINS A WORLD OF\r\nGOOD,[194] unknown to the most pampered slave.\" And again, he says,\r\n\"Nature cries aloud for freedom as our proper good, our birthright and\r\nour end, and resents nothing so much as its loss.\"\r\n\r\nIn these high-sounding praises, which hold up personal freedom as \"our\r\nproper good,\" as \"our end,\" it is assumed that man was made for liberty,\r\nand not liberty for man. It is, indeed, one of the fundamental errors of\r\nthe abolitionist to regard freedom as a great substantive good, or as in\r\nitself a blessing, and not merely as a relative good. It may be, and\r\nindeed often is, an unspeakable benefit, but then it is so only as a\r\nmeans to an end. The end of our existence, the _proper good_, is the\r\nimprovement of our intellectual and moral powers, the perfecting of our\r\nrational and immortal natures. When freedom subserves this end, it is a\r\ngood; when it defeats this end, it is an evil. Hence there may be a\r\nworld of evil as well as a world of good in \"this one word.\"\r\n\r\nThe wise man adapts the means to the end. It were the very hight of\r\nfolly to sacrifice the end to the means. No man gives personal freedom\r\nto his child because he deems it always and in all cases a good. His\r\nheart teaches him a better doctrine when the highest good of his child\r\nis concerned. Should we not be permitted, then, to have something of the\r\nsame feeling in regard to those whom Providence has placed under our\r\ncare, especially since, having the passions of men, with only the\r\nintellects of children, they stand in utmost need of guidance and\r\ndirection?\r\n\r\nAs it is their duty to labor, so the law which compels them to do so is\r\nnot oppressive. It deprives them of the enjoyment of no right, unless,\r\nindeed, they may be supposed to have a right to violate their duty.\r\nHence, in compelling the colored population of the South to work, the\r\nlaw does not deprive them of liberty, in the true sense of the word;\r\nthat is, _it does not deprive them of the enjoyment of any natural\r\nright_. It merely requires them to perform a natural duty.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be denied. It has been, as we have shown, admitted both by\r\nDr. Wayland and Dr. Channing.[195] But while the _end_ is approved, the\r\n_means_ are not liked. Few of the abolitionists are disposed to offer\r\nany substitute for our method. They are satisfied merely to pull down\r\nand destroy, without the least thought or care in regard to\r\nconsequences. Dr. Channing has, however, been pleased to propose another\r\nmethod, for securing the industry of the black and the prosperity of the\r\nState. Let us then, for a moment, look at this scheme.\r\n\r\nThe black man, says he, should not be owned. He should work, but not\r\nunder the control of a master. His overseer should be appointed by the\r\nState, and be amenable to the State for the proper exercise of his\r\nauthority. Now, if this learned and eloquent orator had only looked one\r\ninch beneath the surface of his own scheme, he would have seen that it\r\nis fraught with the most insuperable difficulties, and that its\r\nexecution must needs be attended with the most ruinous consequences.\r\n\r\nEmancipate the blacks, then, and let the State undertake to work them.\r\nIn the first place, we must ignore every principle of political economy,\r\nand consent to the wildest and most reckless of experiments, ere we can\r\nagree that the State should superintend and carry on the agricultural\r\ninterests of the country. But suppose this difficulty out of the way, on\r\nwhat land would the State cause _its slaves_ to be worked? It would\r\nscarcely take possession of the plantations now under improvements; and,\r\nsetting aside the owners, proceed to cultivate the land. But it must\r\neither do this, or else leave these plantations to become worthless for\r\nthe want of laborers, and open new ones for the benefit of the State! In\r\nno point of view could a more utterly chimerical or foolish scheme be\r\nwell conceived. If we may not be allowed to adhere to our own plan, we\r\nbeg that some substitute may be proposed which is not fraught with such\r\ninevitable destruction to the whole South. Otherwise, we shall fear\r\nthat these self-styled friends of humanity are more bent on carrying out\r\ntheir own designs than they are on promoting our good.\r\n\r\nBut what is meant by the freedom of the emancipated slaves, on which so\r\nmany exalted eulogies have been pronounced? Its first element, it is\r\nplain, is a freedom from labor[196]--freedom from the very first law of\r\nnature. In one word, its sum and substance is a power on the part of the\r\nfreed black to act pretty much as he pleases. Now, before we expend\r\noceans of enthusiasm on such a freedom, would it not be well to see\r\n_how_ he would be pleased to act?\r\n\r\nDr. Channing has told us, we are aware, of the \"indomitable love of\r\nliberty,\" which had been infused into the breast of \"fierce barbarians\"\r\nby their native wildernesses.[197] But we are no great admirers of a\r\nliberty which knows no law except its own will, and seeks no end except\r\nthe gratification of passion.[198] Hence, we have no very great respect\r\nfor the liberty of fierce barbarians. It would make a hell on earth. \"My\r\nmaxim,\" exclaims Dr. Channing, \"is anything but slavery!\" Even slavery,\r\nwe cry, before a freedom such as his!\r\n\r\nThis kind of freedom, it should be remembered, was born in France and\r\ncradled in the revolution. May it never be forgotten that the \"Friends\r\nof the Blacks\" at Boston had their exact prototypes in \"_les Amis des\r\nNoirs_\" of Paris. Of this last society Robespierre was the ruling\r\nspirit, and Brissot the orator. By the dark machinations of the\r\none,[199] and the fiery eloquence of the other, the French people--_la\r\ngrande nation_--were induced, in 1791, to proclaim the principle of\r\nequality to and for the free blacks of St. Domingo. This beautiful\r\nisland, then the brightest and most precious jewel in the crown of\r\nFrance, thus became the first of the West Indies in which the dreadful\r\nexperiment of a forced equality was tried. The authors of that\r\nexperiment were solemnly warned of the horrors into which it would\r\ninevitably plunge both the whites and the blacks of the island. Yet,\r\nfirm and immovable as death, Robespierre sternly replied, then \"Perish\r\nthe colonies rather than sacrifice one iota of our principles!\"[200] The\r\nmagnificent colony of St. Domingo did not quite perish, it is true; but\r\nyet, as every one, except the philanthropic \"Ami des Noirs\" of the\r\npresent day, still remembers with a thrill of horror, the entire white\r\npopulation soon melted, like successive flakes of snow, in the furnace\r\nof that freedom which a Robespierre had kindled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe atrocities of this awful massacre have had, as the historian has\r\nsaid,[201] no parallel in the annals of human crime. \"The negroes,\" says\r\nAlison, \"marched with spiked infants on their spears instead of colors;\r\nthey sawed asunder the male prisoners, and violated the females on the\r\ndead bodies of their husbands.\" The work of death, thus completed with\r\nsuch outbursts of unutterable brutality, constituted and closed the\r\nfirst act in the grand drama of Haytien freedom.\r\n\r\nBut equality was not yet established. The colored men, or mulattoes,\r\nbeheld, with an eye burning with jealousy, the superior power and\r\nascendency of the blacks. Hence arose the horrors of a civil war.\r\nEquality had been proclaimed, and anarchy produced. In this frightful\r\nchaos, the ambitious mulattoes, whose insatiable desire of equality had\r\nfirst disturbed the peace of the island, perished miserably beneath the\r\nvengeance of the very slaves whom they had themselves roused from\r\nsubjection and elevated into irresistible power. Thus ended the second\r\nact of the horrible drama.\r\n\r\nThis bloody discord, this wild chaos of disgusting brutalities, of\r\ncourse terminated not in freedom, but in a military despotism. With the\r\nsubsequent wars and fearful destruction of human life our present\r\ninquiry has nothing to do. We must confine our attention to the point\r\nbefore us, namely, the kind of freedom achieved by the blacks of St.\r\nDomingo. We have witnessed the two great manifestations of that freedom;\r\nwe shall now look at its closing scene. This we shall, for obvious\r\nreasons, present in the language of an English author.\r\n\r\n\"An independent negro state,\" says he, \"was thus established in Hayti;\r\nbut the people have not derived all the benefits which they sanguinely\r\nexpected. Released from their compulsory toil, they have not yet learned\r\nto subject themselves to the restraints of regular industry. The first\r\nabsolute rulers made the most extraordinary efforts to overcome the\r\nindolence which soon began to display itself. The _Code Rural_ directed\r\nthat the laborer should fix himself on a certain estate, which he was\r\nnever afterward to quit without a passport from the government. His\r\nhours of labor and rest were fixed by statute. The whip, at first\r\npermitted, was ultimately prohibited; but as every military officer was\r\nallowed to chastise with a thick cane, and almost every proprietor held\r\na commission, the laborer was not much relieved. By these means Mr.\r\nMackenzie supposes that the produce of 1806 was raised to about a third\r\nof that of 1789. But such violent regulations could not continue to be\r\nenforced amid the succeeding agitations, and under a republican\r\n_régime_. Almost all traces of laborious culture were soon obliterated;\r\nlarge tracts, which had been one entire sugar garden, presented now only\r\na few scattered plantations.\"[202]\r\n\r\nThus the lands were divided out among the officers of the army, while\r\nthe privates were compelled to cultivate the soil under their former\r\nmilitary commanders, clothed with more than \"a little brief authority.\"\r\nNo better could have been expected except by fools or fanatics. The\r\nblacks might preach equality, it is true, but yet, like the more\r\nenlightened ruffians of Paris, they would of course take good care not\r\nto practice what they had preached. Hence, by all the horrors of their\r\nbloody resolution, they only effected a change of masters. The white man\r\nhad disappeared, and the black man, one of their own race and color, had\r\nassumed his place and his authority. And of all masters, it is well\r\nknown, the naturally servile are the most cruel. \"The earth,\" says\r\nSolomon, \"cannot bear a servant when he reigneth.\"[203]\r\n\r\n          \"The sensual and the dark rebel in vain:\r\n           Slaves by their own compulsion, in mad game\r\n           They burst their manacles, to wear the _name_\r\n           Of Freedom, graven on a heavier chain.\"\r\n\r\n          COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\nThus \"the world of good\" they sought was found, most literally, in \"the\r\nword;\" for the word, the name of freedom, was all they had achieved--at\r\nleast of good. Poverty, want, disease, and crime, were the substantial\r\nfruits of their boasted freedom.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, the sugar exported was 672,000,000 pounds; in 1806, it was\r\n47,516,531 pounds; in 1825, it was 2020 pounds; in 1832, it was 0\r\npounds. If history had not spoken, we might have safely inferred, from\r\nthis astounding decline of industry, that the morals of the people had\r\nsuffered a fearful deterioration. But we are not left to inference. We\r\nare informed, by the best authorities,[204] that their \"morals are\r\nexceedingly bad;\" and that under the reign of liberty, as it is called,\r\ntheir condition has, in all respects, become far worse than it was\r\nbefore. \"There appears every reason to apprehend,\" says James Franklin,\r\n\"that it will recede into irrecoverable insignificance, poverty, and\r\ndisorder.\"[205]\r\n\r\nMr. T. Babington Macaulay has, we are aware, put forth certain notions\r\non the subject of liberty, which are exactly in accordance with the\r\nviews and the spirit of the abolitionists, as well as with the\r\ncut-throat philosophy of the Parisian philanthropists of the revolution.\r\nAs these notions are found in one of his juvenile productions, and\r\nillustrated by \"a pretty story\" out of Ariosto, we should not deem it\r\nworth while to notice them, if they had not been retained in the latest\r\nedition of his Miscellanies. But for this circumstance, we should pass\r\nthem by as the rhetorical flourish of a young man who, in his most\r\nmature productions, is often more brillant than profound.\r\n\r\n\"Ariosto,\" says he, \"tells a pretty story of a fairy, who, by some\r\nmysterious law of her nature, was condemned to appear at certain seasons\r\nin the form of a foul and poisonous snake. Those who injured her during\r\nthe period of her disguise were forever excluded from participation in\r\nthe blessings which she bestowed. But to those who, in spite of her\r\nloathsome aspect, pitied and protected her, she afterward revealed\r\nherself in the beautiful and celestial form which was natural to her,\r\naccompanied their steps, granted all their wishes, filled their houses\r\nwith wealth, made them happy in love, and victorious in war. Such a\r\nspirit is Liberty. At times she takes the form of a hateful reptile. She\r\ngrovels, she hisses, she stings. But wo to those who in disgust shall\r\nventure to crush her! And happy are those who, having dared to receive\r\nher in her degraded and frightful shape, shall at length be rewarded by\r\nher in the time of her beauty and her glory.\"\r\n\r\nFor aught we know, all this may be very fine poetry, and may deserve the\r\nplace which it has found in some of our books on rhetoric. But yet this\r\nbeautiful passage will--like the fairy whose charms it celebrates--be so\r\nsurely transformed into a hateful snake or venomous toad, that it should\r\nnot be swallowed without an antidote. Robespierre, Danton, Marat,\r\nBarrière, and the black Dessalines, took this hateful, hissing,\r\nstinging, maddening reptile to their bosoms, and they are welcome to its\r\nrewards. But they mistook the thing: it was not liberty transformed; it\r\nwas tyranny unbound, the very scourge of hell, and Satan's chief\r\ninstrument of torture to a guilty world. It was neither more nor less\r\nthan Sin, despising GOD, and warring against his image on the earth.\r\n\r\nWe do not doubt--nay, we firmly believe--that in the veritable history\r\nof the universe, _analogous_ changes have taken place. But then these\r\nawful changes were not mere fairy tales. They are recorded in the word\r\nof God. When Lucifer, the great bearer of light, himself was _free_, he\r\nsought equality with God, and thence became a hateful, hissing serpent\r\nin the dust. But he was not fully cursed, until \"by devilish art\" he\r\nreached \"the organs of man's fancy,\" and with them forged the grand\r\nillusion that equality alone is freedom.\r\n\r\nFor even sinless, happy Eve was made to feel herself oppressed, until,\r\nwith keen desire of equality with gods, \"forth reaching to the fruit,\r\nshe plucked, she ate:\"--\r\n\r\n          \"Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,\r\n           Sighing through all her works, gave signs of wo,\r\n           That all was lost.\"\r\n\r\nHow much easier, then, to effect the ruin of poor, fallen man, by\r\nstirring up this fierce desire of equality with discontented thoughts\r\nand vain hopes of unattainable good! It is this dark desire, and not\r\nliberty, which, in its rage, becomes the \"poisonous snake;\" and, though\r\ndecked in fine, allegoric, glowing garb, it is still the loathsome\r\nthing, the \"false worm,\" that turned God's Paradise itself into a\r\nblighted world.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Macaulay had only distinguished between liberty and license,\r\nthan which no two things in the universe are more diametrically opposed\r\nto each other, his passion for fine rhetoric would not have betrayed him\r\ninto so absurd a conceit respecting the diverse forms of freedom.\r\nLiberty is--as we have seen--the bright emanation of reason in the form\r\nof law; license is the triumph of blind passion over all law and order.\r\nHence, if we would have liberty, the great deep of human passion must be\r\nrestrained. For this purpose, as Mr. Burke has said, there must be power\r\nsomewhere; and if there be not moral power within, there must be\r\nphysical power without. Otherwise, the restraints will be too weak; the\r\nsafeguards of liberty will give way, and the passions of men will burst\r\ninto anarchy, the most frightful of all the forms of tyranny. Shall we\r\ncall this liberty? Shall we seek the secure enjoyment of natural rights\r\nin a wild reign of lawless terror? As well might we seek the pure light\r\nof heaven in the bottomless pit. It is, indeed, a most horrible\r\ndesecration of the sacred name of liberty, to apply it either to the\r\nbutcheries and brutalities of the French Revolution, or to the more\r\ndiabolical massacres of St. Domingo. If such were freedom, it would, in\r\nsober truth, be more fitly symbolized by ten thousand hissing serpents\r\nthan by a single poisonous snake; and by all on earth, as in heaven, it\r\nshould be abhorred. Hence, those pretended friends and advocates of\r\nfreedom, who would thus fain transmute her form divine into such\r\nhorribly distorted shapes, are with her enemies confederate in dark,\r\nmisguided league.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ V. _The consequences of abolition to the South._\r\n\r\n\"We have had experience enough in our own colonies,\" says the\r\n_Prospective Review_, for November, 1852, \"not to wish to see the\r\nexperiment tried elsewhere on a larger scale.\" Now this, though it comes\r\nto us from across the Atlantic, really sounds like the voice of genuine\r\nphilanthropy. Nor do we wish to see the experiment, which has brought\r\ndown such wide-spread ruin on all the great interests of St. Domingo and\r\nthe British colonies, tried in this prosperous and now beautiful land of\r\nours. It requires no prophet to foresee the awful consequences of such\r\nan experiment on the lives, the liberties, the fortunes, and the morals,\r\nof the people of the Southern States. Let us briefly notice some of\r\nthese consequences.\r\n\r\nConsider, in the first place, the vast amount of property which would be\r\ndestroyed by the madness of such an experiment. According to the\r\nestimate of Mr. Clay, \"the total value of the slave property in the\r\nUnited States is twelve hundred millions of dollars,\" all of which the\r\npeople of the South are expected to sacrifice on the altar of\r\nabolitionism. It only moves the indignation of the abolitionist that we\r\nshould for one moment hesitate. \"I see,\" he exclaims, \"in the\r\nimmenseness of the value of the slaves, the enormous amount of the\r\nrobbery committed on them. I see 'twelve hundred millions of dollars'\r\nseized, extorted by unrighteous force.\"[206] But, unfortunately, his\r\npassions are so furious, that his mind no sooner comes into contact with\r\nany branch of the subject of slavery, than instantly, as if by a flash\r\nof lightning, his opinion is formed, and he begins to declaim and\r\ndenounce as if reason should have nothing to do with the question. He\r\ndoes not even allow himself time for a single moment's serious\r\nreflection. Nay, resenting the opinion of the most sagacious of our\r\nstatesmen as an insult to his understanding, he deems it beneath his\r\ndignity even to make an attempt to look beneath the surface of the great\r\nproblem on which he condescends to pour the illuminations of his genius.\r\nEre we accept his oracles as inspired, we beg leave to think a little,\r\nand consider their intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nTwelve hundred millions of dollars extorted by unrighteous force! What\r\nenormous robbery! Now, let it be borne in mind, that this is the\r\nlanguage of a man who, as we have seen, has--in one of his lucid\r\nintervals--admitted that _it is right to apply force_ to compel those to\r\nwork who will not labor from rational motives. Such is precisely the\r\napplication of the force which now moves his righteous indignation!\r\n\r\nThis force, so justly applied, has created this enormous value of twelve\r\nhundred millions of dollars. It has neither seized, nor extorted this\r\nvast amount from others; it has simply created it out of that which, but\r\nfor such force, would have been utterly valueless. And if experience\r\nteaches any thing, then, no sooner shall this force be withdrawn, than\r\nthe great value in question will disappear. It will not be restored; it\r\nwill be annihilated. The slaves--now worth so many hundred millions of\r\ndollars--would become worthless to themselves, and nuisances to\r\nsociety. No free State in the Union would be willing to receive\r\nthem--or a considerable portion of them--into her dominions. They would\r\nbe regarded as pests, and, if possible, everywhere expelled from the\r\nempires of freemen.\r\n\r\nOur lands, like those of the British West Indies, would become almost\r\nvalueless for the want of laborers to cultivate them. The most beautiful\r\ngarden-spots of the sunny South would, in the course of a few years, be\r\nturned into a jungle, with only here and there a forlorn plantation.\r\nPoverty and distress, bankruptcy and ruin, would everywhere be seen. In\r\none word, the condition of the Southern States would, in all material\r\nrespects, be like that of the once flourishing British colonies in which\r\nthe fatal experiment of emancipation has been tried.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the fearful consequences of emancipation. But these are\r\nnot all. The ties that would be severed, and the sympathies crushed, by\r\nemancipation, are not at all understood by abolitionists. They are,\r\nindeed, utter strangers to the moral power which these ties and\r\nsympathies now exert for the good of the inferior race. \"Our patriarchal\r\nscheme of domestic servitude,\" says Governor Hammond, \"is indeed well\r\ncalculated to awaken the higher and finer feelings of our nature. It is\r\nnot wanting in its enthusiasm and its poetry. The relations of the most\r\nbeloved and honored chiefs, and the most faithful and admiring subjects,\r\nwhich, from the time of Homer, have been the theme of song, are frigid\r\nand unfelt, compared with those existing between the master and his\r\nslaves; who served his father, and rocked his cradle, or have been born\r\nin his household, and look forward to serve his children; who have been\r\nthrough life the props of his fortune, and the objects of his care; who\r\nhave partaken of his griefs, and looked to him for comfort in their own;\r\nwhose sickness he has so frequently watched over and relieved; whose\r\nholidays he has so often made joyous by his bounties and his presence;\r\nfor whose welfare, when absent, his anxious solicitude never ceases, and\r\nwhose hearty and affectionate greetings never fail to welcome him home.\r\nIn this cold, calculating, ambitious world of ours, there are few ties\r\nmore heart-felt, or of more benignant influence, than those which\r\nmutually bind the master and the slave, under our ancient system, handed\r\ndown from the father of Israel.\"\r\n\r\nLet the slaves be emancipated then, and, in one or two generations, the\r\nwhite people of the South would care as little for the freed blacks\r\namong us, as the same class of persons are now cared for by the white\r\npeople of the North. The prejudice of race would be restored with\r\nunmitigated violence. The blacks are contented in servitude, so long as\r\nthey find themselves excluded from none of the privileges of the\r\ncondition to which they belong; but let them be delivered from the\r\nauthority of their masters, and they will feel their rigid exclusion\r\nfrom the society of the whites and all participation in their\r\ngovernment. They would become clamorous for \"their inalienable rights.\"\r\nThree millions of freed blacks, thus circumstanced, would furnish the\r\nelements of the most horrible civil war the world has ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nThese elements would soon burst in fury on the land. There was no civil\r\nwar in Jamaica, it is true, after the slaves were emancipated; but this\r\nwas because the power of Great Britain was over the two parties, and\r\nheld them in subjection. It would be far otherwise here. For here there\r\nwould be no power to check--while there would be infernal agencies at\r\nwork to promote--civil discord and strife. As Robespierre caused it to\r\nbe proclaimed to the free blacks of St. Domingo that they were naturally\r\nentitled to all the rights and privileges of citizens; as Mr. Seward\r\nproclaimed the same doctrine to the free blacks of New York; so there\r\nwould be kind benefactors enough to propagate the same sentiments among\r\nour colored population. They would be instigated, in every possible way,\r\nto claim their natural equality with the whites; and, by every\r\ndiabolical art, their bad passions would be inflamed. If the object of\r\nsuch agitators were merely to stir up scenes of strife and blood, it\r\nmight be easily attained; but if it were to force the blacks into a\r\nsocial and political equality with the whites, it would most certainly\r\nand forever fail. For the government of these Southern States was, by\r\nour fathers, founded on the VIRTUE and the INTELLIGENCE of the people,\r\nand there we intend it shall stand. The African has neither part nor lot\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\nWe cannot suppose, for a moment, that abolitionists would be in the\r\nslightest degree moved by the awful consequences of emancipation.\r\nPoverty, ruin, death, are very small items with these sublime\r\nphilanthropists. They scarcely enter into their calculations. The\r\ndangers of a civil war--though the most fearful the world has ever\r\nseen--lie quite beneath the range of their humanity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we should expect our argument from the consequences of\r\nemancipation to be met by a thorough-going abolitionist with the\r\nwords,--\"Perish the Southern States rather than sacrifice one iota of\r\nour principles!\" We ask them not to sacrifice their principles to us;\r\nnor do we intend that they shall sacrifice us to their principles. For\r\nif perish we must, it shall be as a sacrifice to our own principles, and\r\nnot to theirs.\r\n\r\n          NOTE.--It has not fallen within the scope of our\r\n          design to consider the effects of emancipation,\r\n          and of the consequent destruction of so large an\r\n          amount of property, on the condition and\r\n          prosperity of the world. Otherwise it might easily\r\n          have been shown that every civilized portion of\r\n          the globe would feel the shock. This point has\r\n          been very happily, though briefly, illustrated by\r\n          Governor Hammond, in his \"Letters on Slavery.\"\r\n\r\n          Nor has it formed any part of our purpose, in the\r\n          following section, to discuss the influence of\r\n          American slavery on the future destiny and\r\n          civilization of Africa. This subject has been ably\r\n          discussed by various writers; and especially by an\r\n          accomplished divine, the Rev. William N.\r\n          Pendleton, in a discourse published in the\r\n          \"Virginian Colonizationist,\" for September, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VI. _Elevation of the Blacks by Southern slavery._\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists, with the most singular unanimity, perseveringly\r\nassert that Southern slavery degrades its subjects \"into brutes.\"\r\nThis assertion fills us with amazement. If it were possible, we\r\nwould suppose, in a judgment of charity, that its authors knew\r\nnothing of the history of Africa or of the condition of our slaves.\r\nBut such ignorance is not possible. On the other hand, we find it\r\nequally impossible tobelieve that so many men and women--the very lights\r\nof abolitionism--could knowingly utter so palpable a falsehood. Thus we\r\nare forced to the conclusion, that the authors of this charge are so\r\ncompletely carried away by a blind hatred of slavery, that they do not\r\ncare to keep their words within the sacred bounds of eternal truth. This\r\nseems to be the simple, melancholy fact. The great question with them\r\nseems to be, not what is true or what is false, but what will most\r\nspeedily effect the destruction of Southern slavery. Any thing that\r\nseems to answer this purpose is blindly and furiously wielded by them.\r\nThe Edinburgh Review, in a high-wrought eulogy on an American authoress,\r\nsays that she assails slavery with arrows \"poisoned by truth.\" Her\r\nwords, it is true, are dipped in flaming poison; but _that_ poison is\r\nnot truth. The truth is never poison.\r\n\r\nThe native African could not be degraded. Of the fifty millions of\r\ninhabitants of the continent of Africa, it is estimated that forty\r\nmillions were slaves. The master had the power of life and death over\r\nthe slave; and, in fact, his slaves were often fed, and killed, and\r\neaten, just as we do with oxen and sheep in this country. Nay, the hind\r\nand fore-quarters of men, women, and children, might there be seen hung\r\non the shambles and exposed for sale! Their women were beasts of burden;\r\nand, when young, they were regarded as a great delicacy by the palate of\r\ntheir pampered masters. A warrior would sometimes take a score of young\r\nfemales along with him, in order to enrich his feasts and regale his\r\nappetite. He delighted in such delicacies. As to his religion, it was\r\neven worse than his morals; or rather, his religion was a mass of the\r\nmost disgusting immoralities. His notion of a God, and the obscene acts\r\nby which that notion was worshiped, are too shocking to be mentioned.\r\nThe vilest slave that ever breathed the air of a Christian land could\r\nnot begin to conceive the horrid iniquities of such a life. And yet, in\r\nthe face of all this, we are told--yea, we are perseveringly and\r\neternally told--that \"the African has been degraded into a brute\" by\r\nAmerican slavery! Indeed, if such creatures ever reach the level of\r\nsimple brutality at all, is it not evident they must be elevated, and\r\nnot degraded, to it?\r\n\r\nThe very persons who make the above charge know better. Their own\r\nwritings furnish the most incontestable proof that they know better. A\r\nwriter in the Edinburgh Review,[207] for example, has not only asserted\r\nthat \"slavery degrades its subjects into brutes,\" but he has the\r\naudacity to declare, in regard to slavery in the United States, that \"we\r\ndo not believe that such oppression is to be found in any other part of\r\nthe world, civilized or uncivilized. We do not believe that such\r\noppression ever existed before.\" Yet even this unprincipled writer has,\r\nin the very article containing this declaration, shown that he knows\r\nbetter. He has shown that he knows that the African has been elevated\r\nand improved by his servitude in the United States. We shall proceed to\r\nconvict him out of his own mouth.\r\n\r\n\"The African slave-trade was frightful,\" says he; \"but its prey were\r\nsavages, accustomed to suffering and misery, and to endure them with\r\npatience almost amounting to apathy. The victims of the American\r\nslave-trade have been bred in a highly-cultivated community. Their\r\ndispositions have been softened, their intellects sharpened, and their\r\nsensibilities excited, by society, by Christianity, and by all the\r\nameliorating but enervating influences of civilization. The savage\r\nsubmits to be enslaved himself, or have his wife or his child carried\r\noff by his enemies, as merely a calamity. His misery is not embittered\r\nby indignation. He suffers only what--if he could--he would inflict. He\r\ncannot imagine a state of society in which there shall not be masters\r\nand slaves, kidnapping and man-selling, coffles and slave-traders, or in\r\nwhich any class shall be exempt from misfortunes which appear to him to\r\nbe incidental to humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThus, according to this very sagacious, honest, consistent writer, it\r\nmatters little what you do with the native African: he has no moral\r\nsense; he feels no wrong; he suffers only what he would inflict. But\r\nwhen you come to deal with the American slave, or, as this writer calls\r\nhim, \"the civilized Virginian,\" it is quite another thing! His\r\ndispositions have been softened, his intellect sharpened, and his\r\nsensibilities roused to a new life, by society and by Christianity! And\r\nyet, according to this very writer, this highly civilized Virginian is\r\nthe man who, by American slavery, has been degraded from the native\r\nAfrican into a brute! We dismiss his lawless savage, and his equally\r\nlawless pen, from our further consideration.\r\n\r\nWe proceed, in like manner, to condemn Dr. Channing out of his own\r\nmouth. He has repeatedly asserted that slavery among us degrades its\r\nsubjects into brutes. Now hear him on the other side of this question.\r\n\r\n\"The European race,\" says he, \"have manifested more courage, enterprise,\r\ninvention; but in the dispositions which Christianity particularly\r\nhonors, how inferior are they to the African? When I cast my eyes over\r\nour Southern region,--the land of bowie-knives, lynch-law, and duels, of\r\n'chivalry,' 'honor,' and revenge; and when I consider that Christianity\r\nis declared to be a spirit of charity, 'which seeketh not its own, is\r\nnot easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and endureth all things,' and is\r\nalso declared to be 'the wisdom from above,' which is 'first pure, then\r\npeaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good\r\nfruits;' can I hesitate in deciding to which of the races in that land\r\nChristianity is most adapted, and in which its noblest disciples are\r\nmost likely to be reared?\"[208]\r\n\r\nIt was by casting his eyes over \"our Southern region\" that Dr. Channing\r\nconcluded \"that we are holding in bondage one of the best races of the\r\nhuman family.\" If he had cast them over the appallingly dark region of\r\nAfrica, he would have been compelled, in spite of the wonder-working\r\npower of his imagination, to pronounce it one of the very worst and most\r\ndegraded races upon earth. If, as he imagines, this race among us is now\r\nnearer to the kingdom of heaven than we ourselves are, how dare he\r\nassert--as he so often has done--that our slavery has \"degraded them\r\ninto brutes?\" If, indeed, they had not been elevated--both physically\r\nand morally--by their servitude in America, it would have been beyond\r\nthe power of even Dr. Channing to pronounce such a eulogy upon them. We\r\nsay, then, that he knew better when he asserted that we have degraded\r\nthem into brutes. He spoke, not from his better knowledge and his\r\nconscience, but from blind, unreflecting passion. For he knew--if he\r\nknew any thing--that the blacks have been elevated and improved by their\r\ncontact with the whites of this enlightened portion of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the abolitionist can make the slave a brute or a saint,\r\njust as it may happen to suit the exigency of his argument. If slavery\r\ndegrades its subjects into brutes, then one would suppose that slaves\r\nare brutes. But the moment you speak of selling a slave, he is no longer\r\na brute,--he is a civilized man, with all the most tender affections,\r\nwith all the most generous emotions. If the object be to excite\r\nindignation against slavery, then it always transforms its subjects into\r\nbrutes; but if it be to excite indignation against the slaveholder, then\r\nhe holds, not brutes, but a George Harris--or an Eliza--or an Uncle\r\nTom--in bondage. Any thing, and every thing, except fair and impartial\r\nstatement, are the materials with which he works.\r\n\r\nNo fact is plainer than that the blacks have been elevated and improved\r\nby their servitude in this country. We cannot possibly conceive, indeed,\r\nhow Divine Providence could have placed them in a better school of\r\ncorrection. If the abolitionists can conceive a better method for their\r\nenlightenment and religious improvement, we should rejoice to see them\r\ncarry their plan into execution. They need not seek to rend asunder our\r\nUnion, on account of the three millions of blacks among us, while there\r\nare fifty millions of the same race on the continent of Africa, calling\r\naloud for their sympathy, and appealing to their Christian benevolence.\r\nLet them look to that continent. Let them rouse the real, active,\r\nself-sacrificing benevolence of the whole Christian world in behalf of\r\nthat most degraded portion of the human family; and, after all, if they\r\nwill show us on the continent of Africa, or elsewhere, three millions of\r\nblacks in as good a condition--physically and morally--as our slaves,\r\nthen will we most cheerfully admit that all other Christian nations,\r\ncombined, have accomplished as much for the African race, as has been\r\ndone by the Southern States of the Union.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[175] Life of Joseph John Gurney, vol. ii. p. 214.\r\n\r\n[176] Bigelow's Notes on Jamaica in 1850, as quoted in Carey's \"Slave\r\nTrade, Foreign and Domestic.\"\r\n\r\n[177] Quoted by Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\n[178] Carey's Slave Trade.\r\n\r\n[179] \"The West Indies and North America,\" by Robt.

I take not the Bible for my master--nor yet the\r\nchurch--nor even Jesus of Nazareth for my master. . . . . . He is my best\r\nhistoric ideal of human greatness; not without errors--not without the\r\nstain of his times, and I presume, of course, not without sins; for men\r\nwithout sins exist in the dreams of girls.\" Thus, the truth of all\r\nmiracles is denied; and the faith of the Christian world, in regard to\r\nthe sinless character of Jesus, is set down by this very modest _divine_\r\nas the dream of girls! Yet he believes that half a million of men were,\r\nby the British act of emancipation, turned from slaves into freemen!\r\nThat is to say, he does not believe in the miracles of the gospel; he\r\nonly believes in the miracles of abolitionism.

We no sooner begin\r\nto reason from the past to the future, than we are lost in amazement at\r\nthe prospect before us. We behold the United States, and that too at no\r\nvery distant period, the first power among the nations of the earth. But\r\nsuch reasoning is not always to be relied on. Whether, in the present\r\ninstance, it points to a reality, or to a magnificent dream merely, will\r\nof course depend on the wisdom, the integrity, and the moderation, of\r\nour rulers.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be disguised that the Union, with all its unspeakable\r\nadvantages and blessings, is in danger. It is the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nagainst which the waves of abolitionism have dashed with their utmost\r\nforce and raged with an almost boundless fury. On the other hand, it is\r\nprecisely the Fugitive Slave Law--that great constitutional guarantee of\r\nour rights--which the people of the South are, as one man, the most\r\ninflexibly determined to maintain. We are prepared, and we shall\r\naccordingly proceed, to show that, in this fearful conflict, the great\r\nleaders of abolitionism--the Chases, the Sewards, and the Sumners, of\r\nthe day--are waging a fierce, bitter, and relentless warfare against the\r\nConstitution of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ I. _Mr. Seward's attack on the Constitution of his country._\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which Mr. Seward's reasoning overlooks,--namely, that\r\nhe has taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States.\r\nWe shall not lose sight of this fact, nor permit him to obscure it by\r\nhis special pleadings and mystifications; since it serves to show that\r\nwhile, in the name of a \"higher law,\" he denounces the Constitution of\r\nhis country, he at the same time commits a most flagrant outrage against\r\nthat higher law itself.\r\n\r\nThe clause of the Constitution which Mr. Seward denounces is as follows:\r\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws\r\nthereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall\r\nbe delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may\r\nbe due.\" This clause, as Mr. Seward contemptuously says, is \"from the\r\nConstitution of the United States in 1787.\" He knows of only one other\r\ncompact like this \"in diplomatic history;\" and that was made between\r\ndespotic powers \"in the year of grace 902, in the period called the Dark\r\nAges.\" But whether this compact made by the fathers of the Republic, or\r\nthe sayings and doings of Mr. Seward in regard to it, are the more\r\nworthy of the Dark Ages, it is not for him alone to determine.\r\n\r\n\"The law of nature,\" says he, \"disavows such compacts; the law of\r\nnature, written on the hearts and consciences of freemen, repudiates\r\nthem.\" If this be so, then it certainly follows that in founding States\r\nno such compacts should be formed. For, as Mr. Seward says, \"when we are\r\nfounding States, all these laws must be brought to the standard of the\r\nlaws of God, and must be tried by that standard, and must stand or fall\r\nby it.\" This is true, we repeat; but the Senator who uttered this truth\r\nwas _not_ founding States or forming a constitution. He was living and\r\nacting under a constitution already formed, and one which he had taken\r\nan oath to support. If, in the construction of this instrument, our\r\nfathers really followed \"as precedents the abuses of tyrants and\r\nrobbers,\" then the course of the Senator in question was plain: _he\r\nshould have suffered martyrdom rather than take an oath to support it_.\r\nFor the law of nature, it is clear, permits no man first to take an oath\r\nto support such compacts, and then repudiate them. If they are at war\r\nwith his conscience, then, in the name of all that is sacred, let him\r\nrepudiate them, but, by all means, without having first placed himself\r\nunder the necessity of repudiating, at the same time, the obligation of\r\nhis oath.\r\n\r\nThere is a question among casuists, whether an oath extorted by force\r\ncan bind a man to act in opposition to his conscience. But this was not\r\nMr. Seward's case. His oath was not extorted. If he had refused to take\r\nit, he would have lost nothing _except an office_.\r\n\r\n\"There was deep philosophy,\" says he, \"in the confession of an eminent\r\nEnglish judge. When he had condemned a young woman to death, under the\r\nlate sanguinary code of his country, for her first theft, she fell down\r\ndead at his feet. 'I seem to myself,' said he, 'to have been pronouncing\r\nsentence, not against the prisoner, but against the law itself.'\" Ay,\r\nthere was something better than \"deep philosophy\" in that English judge;\r\nthere was stern integrity; for, though he felt the law to be hard and\r\ncruel, yet, having taken an oath to support it, he hardly felt himself\r\nat liberty to dispense with the obligation of his oath. We commend his\r\nexample to the Senator from New York.\r\n\r\nBut who is this Senator, or any other politician of the present day,\r\nthat he should presume to pass so sweeping and so peremptory a sentence\r\nof condemnation on a compact made by the fathers of the Republic and\r\nratified by the people of the United States? For our part, if we wished\r\nto find \"the higher law,\" we should look neither into the Dark Ages nor\r\ninto his conscience. We had infinitely rather look into the great souls\r\nof those by whom the Constitution was framed, and by every one of whom\r\nthe very compact which Mr. Seward pronounces so infamous was cordially\r\nsanctioned.\r\n\r\n\"Your Constitution and laws,\" exclaims Mr. Seward, \"convert hospitality\r\nto the refugee from the most degrading oppression on earth into a crime,\r\nbut all mankind except you esteem that hospitality a virtue.\" Not\r\ncontent with thus denouncing the \"Constitution and laws,\" he has\r\nelsewhere exhorted the people to an open resistance to their execution.\r\n\"It is,\" says he, in a speech at a mass-meeting in Ohio, \"written in the\r\nConstitution of the the United States,\" and \"in violation to divine\r\nlaw,[209] that we shall surrender the fugitive slave who takes refuge at\r\nour fireside from his relentless pursuer.\" He then and there exhorts the\r\npeople to resist the execution of this clear, this unequivocal, this\r\n_acknowledged_, mandate of the Constitution! \"Extend,\" says he, a\r\n\"cordial welcome _to the fugitive who lays his weary limbs at your\r\ndoor_, and DEFEND HIM AS YOU WOULD YOUR HOUSEHOLD GODS.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall not trust ourselves to characterize such conduct. In the calm,\r\njudicial language of the Chancellor of his own State such proceeding of\r\nMr. Seward will find its most fitting rebuke. \"Independent, however,\"\r\nsays Chancellor Walworth, \"_of any legislation on this subject either by\r\nthe individual States or by Congress_, if the person whose services are\r\nclaimed is in fact a fugitive from servitude under the laws of another\r\nState, _the constitutional provision is imperative that he shall be\r\ndelivered up to his master upon claim made_.\" Thus far, Mr. Seward\r\nconcurs with the chancellor in opinion; but the latter continues--\"and\r\nany state officer or private citizen, who owes allegiance to the United\r\nStates, and has taken the usual oath to support the Constitution\r\nthereof, cannot, WITHOUT INCURRING THE MORAL GUILT OF PERJURY, do any\r\nact to deprive the master of his right of recaption, when there is no\r\nreal doubt that the person whose services are claimed is in fact the\r\nslave of the claimant.\"[210] Yet, regardless of the question whether the\r\nfugitive is a slave or not, the life and labors of Mr. Seward are, in a\r\ngreat measure, dedicated to a subversion of the constitutional clause\r\nand right under consideration. He counsels open resistance! Yea, he\r\nexhorts the people to protect and defend fugitive slaves _as such_, and\r\nthough they had confessed themselves to have fled from servitude! But we\r\ndoubt not that \"the law of nature, written on the hearts and consciences\r\nof freemen,\" will reverse this advice of his, and reaffirm the decision\r\nof the chancellor of his own State. Nay, wherever there exists a freeman\r\nwith a real heart and conscience, there that decision already stands\r\naffirmed.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Seward's arguments are more fully elaborated by Mr. Sumner, of\r\nMassachusetts, so they will pass under review when we come to examine\r\nthe speech of that Senator. In the mean time, we beg leave to lay before\r\nthe reader a few living examples of the manner in which the law of\r\nnature, as written on the hearts and consciences of freemen, has\r\nexpressed itself in regard to the points above considered.\r\n\r\n\"I recognize, indeed,\" says the Hon. R. C. Winthrop, of Boston, \"a power\r\nabove all human law-makers and a code above all earthly constitutions!\r\nAnd whenever I perceive a clear conflict of jurisdiction and authority\r\nbetween the Constitution of my country and the laws of my God, my course\r\nis clear. I shall resign my office, whatever it may be, and renounce all\r\nconnection with public service of any sort. Never, never, sir, will I\r\nput myself under the necessity of calling upon God to witness my promise\r\nto support a constitution, any part of which I consider to be\r\ninconsistent with his commands.\r\n\r\n\"But it is a libel upon the Constitution of the United States--and, what\r\nis worse, sir, it is a libel upon the great and good men who framed,\r\nadopted, and ratified it; it is a libel upon Washington and Franklin,\r\nand Hamilton and Madison, upon John Adams, and John Jay, and Rufus King;\r\nit is a libel upon them all, and upon the whole American people of 1789,\r\nwho sustained them in their noble work, and upon all who, from that time\r\nto this, generation after generation, in any capacity,--national,\r\nmunicipal, or state,--have lifted their hands to heaven in attestation\r\nof their allegiance to the government of their country;--it is a gross\r\nlibel upon every one of them, to assert or insinuate that there is any\r\nsuch inconsistency! Let us not do such dishonor to the fathers of the\r\nRepublic and the framers of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ashman, of Massachusetts, after reciting the clause in the\r\nConstitution which demands the restoration of fugitive slaves, proceeds\r\nas follows: \"This reads very plainly, and admits of no doubt but that,\r\nso far as fugitive slaves are concerned, the Constitution fully\r\nrecognizes the right to reclaim them from within the limits of the free\r\nStates. It is the Constitution which we have all sworn to support, and\r\nwhich I hope we all mean to support; and I have no mental reservation\r\nexcluding any of its clauses from the sanction of that oath. It is too\r\nlate now to complain that such a provision is there. Our fathers, who\r\nformed that entire instrument, placed it there, and left it to us as an\r\ninheritance; and nothing but an amendment of the Constitution, or a\r\nviolation of our oaths, can tear it out. And, however much we may abhor\r\nslavery, there is no way for honorable, honest--nay, conscientious--men,\r\nwho desire to live under our laws and our Constitution, but to abide by\r\nit in its spirit.\"\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the Hon. S. A. Douglas, of Illinois, declares: \"All I\r\nhave to say on that subject is this, that the Constitution provides that\r\na fugitive from service in one State, escaping into another, 'shall be\r\ndelivered up.' The Constitution also provides that no man shall be a\r\nSenator unless he takes an oath to support the Constitution. Then, I\r\nask, how does a man acquire a right on this floor to speak, except by\r\ntaking an oath to support and sustain the Constitution of the United\r\nStates? And when he takes that oath, I do not understand that he has a\r\nright to have a mental reservation, or entertain any secret equivocation\r\nthat he excepts that clause which relates to the surrender of fugitives\r\nfrom service. I know not how a man reconciles it to his conscience to\r\ntake that oath to support the Constitution, when he believes that\r\nConstitution is in violation of the law of God. If a man thus believes,\r\nand takes the oath, he commits perfidy to his God in order that he may\r\nenjoy the temporary honors of a seat upon this floor. In this point of\r\nview, it is simply a question of whether Senators will be true to their\r\noaths and true to the Constitution under which we live.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II. _The attack of Mr. Sumner on the Constitution of his country._\r\n\r\nIf we have not noticed the arguments of Mr. Chase, of Ohio, it is\r\nbecause they are reproduced in the celebrated speech of Mr. Sumner, and\r\nbecause he has so fully indorsed the history and logic of this speech as\r\nto make it his own. Hence, in replying to the one of these Senators, we\r\nat the same time virtually reply to the other.\r\n\r\nWe select the speech of Mr. Sumner for examination, because it is\r\ngenerally considered the more powerful of the two. It is, indeed, the\r\nmost elaborate speech ever made in the Senate of the United States, or\r\nelsewhere, on the subject of the Fugitive Slave Law. Even Mr. Weller\r\nfound it \"so handsomely embellished with poetry, both Latin and English,\r\nso full of classical allusions and rhetorical flourishes,\" as to make it\r\nmore palatable than he supposed an abolition speech could possibly be\r\nmade. As to the abolitionists themselves, they seem to know no bounds in\r\ntheir enthusiastic admiration of this sublime effort of their champion.\r\nWe should not wonder, indeed, if many a female reformer had gone into\r\nhysterics over an oration which has received such violent bursts of\r\napplause from grave and dignified Senators. \"By this effort,\" says Mr.\r\nHale, he has placed \"himself side by side with the first orators of\r\nantiquity, and as far ahead of any living American orator as freedom is\r\nahead of slavery. I believe that he has formed to-day a new era in the\r\nhistory of the politics and of the eloquence of the country; and that in\r\nfuture generations the young men of this nation will be stimulated to\r\neffort by the record of what an American Senator has this day done,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt that young men may attempt to imitate the speech in\r\nquestion; but, as they grow older, it is to be hoped that their taste\r\nwill improve. The speech in question will make a \"new era\" in the\r\ntactics of abolitionism, and that is all. We shall see this when we come\r\nto examine this wonderful oration, which so completely ravished _three\r\nSenators_, and called forth such wild shouts of applause from the whole\r\nempire of abolitionism.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase seems almost equally delighted with this marvellous effort.\r\n\"I avow my conviction, now and here,\" says he, \"that, logically and\r\nhistorically, his argument is impregnable--entirely impregnable.\"\r\n. . . . . . \"In my judgment,\" he continues, \"the speech of my friend\r\nfrom Massachusetts will make a NEW ERA in American history.\" Indeed, Mr.\r\nSumner himself does not seem altogether dissatisfied with this effort,\r\nif we may judge from the manner in which it is referred to in his other\r\nspeeches. We do not blame him for this. We can see no reason why he\r\nshould be the only abolitionist in the universe who is not enraptured\r\nwith his oration. But when he so \"fearlessly asserts\" that his speech\r\n\"has never been answered,\" we beg leave to assure him that it _may_ be\r\nrefuted with the most perfect ease. For, indeed, its history is half\r\nfiction, and its logic wholly false: the first containing just enough of\r\ntruth to deceive, and the last just enough of plansibility to convince\r\nthose who are waiting, and watching, and longing to be convinced.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which strikes the mind, on reading the speech of Mr.\r\nSumner, is the strange logical incoherency of its structure. Its parts\r\nare so loosely hung together, and appear so distressingly disjointed,\r\nthat one is frequently at a loss to perceive the design of the oration.\r\nIts avowed object is to procure a repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law of\r\n1850; but no one would ever imagine or suspect such a thing from the\r\ntitle of the speech, which is as follows: \"Freedom, national; Slavery,\r\nsectional.\" It is difficult, at first view, to perceive what logical\r\nconnection this title, or proposition, has with the repeal of the\r\nFugitive Slave Law. But if there be little or no logical connection\r\nbetween these things, we shall soon see how the choice of such a title\r\nand topic of discourse opens the way for the rhetorician to make a most\r\npowerful appeal to the passions and to the prejudices of his readers. We\r\nsay, of his readers, because it is evident that the speech was made for\r\nBuncombe, and not for the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner deems it necessary to refute the position that slavery is a\r\nnational institution, in order to set the world right with respect to\r\nthe relations of the Federal Government to slavery. \"The relations of\r\nthe Government of the United States,\" says he,--\"I speak of the National\r\nGovernment--to slavery, _though plain and obvious, are constantly\r\nmisunderstood_.\" Indeed, nothing in history seems more remarkable than\r\nthe amount of ignorance and stupidity which prevailed in the world\r\nbefore the appearance of the abolitionists, except the wonderful\r\nilluminations which accompanied their advent. \"A popular belief at this\r\nmoment,\" continues Mr. Sumner, \"makes slavery a national institution,\r\nand, of course, renders its support a national duty. The extravagance of\r\nthis error can hardly be surpassed.\" In truth, it is so exceedingly\r\nextravagant, that we doubt if it really exists. It is certain, that we\r\nhave no acquaintance, either historically or personally, with those who\r\nhave fallen into so wild an absurdity.\r\n\r\nIt is true, there is \"a popular belief\"--nay, there is a deep-rooted\r\nnational conviction--that the Government of the United States is bound\r\nto protect the institution of slavery, in so far as this may be done by\r\nthe passage of a Fugitive Slave Law. This national conviction has spoken\r\nout in the laws of Congress; it has been ratified and confirmed by the\r\njudicial opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, as well as\r\nby the decisions of the Supreme Courts of the three great\r\nnon-slaveholding States of Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania.\r\nBut no one, so far as we know, has ever deduced this obligation to\r\nprotect slavery, in this respect, from the absurd notion that \"it is a\r\nnational institution.\" No such deduction is to be found in any of the\r\narguments of counsel before the courts above-mentioned, nor in the\r\nopinions of the courts themselves. We shrewdly suspect that it is to be\r\nfound nowhere except in the fertile imagination of Mr. Sumner.\r\n\r\nWe concede that slavery is _not_ \"a national institution.\" In combating\r\nthis position, Mr. Sumner is merely beating the air. We know that\r\nslavery is not national; it is local, being confined to certain States,\r\nand exclusively established by local or State laws. Hence, Mr. Sumner\r\nmay fire off as much splendid rhetoric as he pleases at his men of\r\nstraw. \"Slavery national!\" he indignantly exclaims: \"Sir, this is all a\r\nmistake and absurdity, fit to take a place in some new collection of\r\n'Vulgar Errors' by some other Sir Thomas Browne, with the ancient but\r\nexploded stories that the toad has a stone in its head and that\r\nostriches digest iron.\" These may be very fine embellishments; they\r\ncertainly have nothing to do with the point in controversy. The question\r\nis not whether slavery is a national institution, but whether the\r\nNational Government does not recognize slavery as a local institution,\r\nand is not pledged to protect the master's right to reclaim the fugitive\r\nfrom his service. This is the question, and by its relevancy to this\r\nquestion the rhetoric of Mr. Sumner must be tried.\r\n\r\nWe do not say it has no such relevancy. Mr. Sumner beats the air, it is\r\ntrue, but he does not beat the air in vain. His declamation may have no\r\nlogical bearing on the point in dispute, but, if you watch it closely,\r\nyou will always find that it is most skillfully adapted to bring the\r\nprejudices and passions of the reader to bear on that point. Though he\r\nmay not be much of a logician, yet, it must be admitted, he is \"skillful\r\nof fence.\" We should do him great injustice as an antagonist, at least\r\nbefore the tribunal of human passion, if we should suppose that it is\r\nmerely for the abstract glory of setting up a man of straw, and then\r\nknocking it down, that he has mustered all the powers of his logic and\r\nunfurled all the splendors of his rhetoric. He has a design in all this,\r\nwhich we shall now proceed to expose.\r\n\r\nHere are two distinct questions. First, Is slavery a national\r\ninstitution? Secondly, Has Congress the power to pass a Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw? These two questions are, we repeat, perfectly distinct; and hence,\r\nif Mr. Sumner wished to discuss them fairly and honestly, he should have\r\nargued each one by itself. We agree with him in regard to the first; we\r\ndissent _toto coelo_ from him in regard to the last. But he has not\r\nchosen to keep them separate, or to discuss each one by itself. On the\r\ncontrary, he has, as we have seen, connected them together as premiss\r\nand conclusion, and he keeps them together through the first portion of\r\nhis speech. Most assuredly Mr. Sumner knows that one of the very best\r\nways in the world to cause a truth or proposition to be rejected is to\r\nbind it up with a manifest error or absurdity. Yet the proposition for\r\nwhich we contend--that Congress has the power to support slavery by the\r\npassage of a Fugitive Slave Law--is bound up by him with the monstrous\r\nabsurdity that \"slavery is a national institution;\" and both are\r\ndenounced together as if both were equally absurd. One instance, out of\r\nmany, of this unfair mode of proceeding, we shall now lay before our\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution contains no power,\" says he, \"to make a king or to\r\nsupport kingly rule. With similar reason it may be said that it contains\r\nno power to make a slave, or to support a system of slavery. The absence\r\nof all such power is hardly more clear in one case than in the other.\r\nBut, if there be no such power, all national legislation upholding\r\nslavery must be unconstitutional and void.\"\r\n\r\nThus covertly, and in company with the supposed power of Congress to\r\nmake slaves or to institute slavery, Mr. Sumner denounces the power of\r\nCongress to enact a Fugitive Slave Law! He not only denounces it, but\r\ntreats it as absurd in the extreme; just as absurd, indeed, as it would\r\nbe to assert that Congress had power \"to support kingly rule!\" We can\r\nlisten to the arguments of Mr. Sumner; but we cannot accept his mere\r\nopinion as authority that the power of Congress to enact such a law is\r\nso glaringly unconstitutional, is so monstrously absurd; for, however\r\npassionately that opinion may be declaimed, we cannot forget that a\r\nFugitive Slave Law was passed by the Congress of 1793, received the\r\nsignature of George Washington, and, finally, the judicial sanction of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States. Mr. Sumner is but a man.\r\n\r\nThis advantage of mixing up with a glaring falsehood the idea he wishes\r\nto be rejected is not the only one which Mr. Sumner derives from his man\r\nof straw. By combating the position--\"the popular belief,\" as he calls\r\nit--that \"slavery is a national institution,\" he lays open a wide field\r\nfor his peculiar powers of declamation. He calls up all the\r\nfathers--North and South--to bear witness against slavery, in order to\r\nshow that it is not a national institution. He quotes colleges, and\r\nchurches, and patriots, against slavery. Not content with this, he pours\r\ndown furious invectives of his own, with a view to render slavery as\r\nodious as possible. But, since the simple question is, _What saith the\r\nConstitution_--why this fierce crusade against slavery? In deciding this\r\nvery question, namely, the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nof 1793, a high judicial authority has said that \"the abstract\r\nproposition of the justice or injustice of slavery is wholly irrelevant\r\nhere, and, I apprehend, ought not to have the slightest influence upon\r\nany member of this court.\"[211]\r\n\r\nIt ought not to have--and it did not have--the slightest influence on\r\nthe highest judicial tribunal of New York, in which the above opinion\r\nwas delivered. Much as the author of that opinion (Mr. Senator Bishop)\r\nabhorred slavery, he did not permit such an influence to reach his\r\njudgment. It would have contaminated his judicial integrity. But\r\nalthough before a judicial tribunal, about to decide on the\r\nconstitutionality of a Fugitive Slave Law, the abstract proposition of\r\nthe justice or injustice of slavery is out of place, yet at the bar of\r\npassion and prejudice it is well calculated, as Mr. Sumner must know, to\r\nexert a tremendous influence. Hence, if he can only get up the horror of\r\nhis readers against slavery before he comes to the real question,\r\nnamely, the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Law, he knows that\r\nhis victory will be more than half gained. But we admonish him that\r\npassion and prejudice can only give a temporary éclat to his argument.\r\n\r\nSo much for the unfairness of Mr. Sumner. If we should notice all such\r\ninstances of artful design in his speech, we should have no space for\r\nhis logic. To this we would now invite the attention of the reader, in\r\norder to see if it be really \"impregnable.\"\r\n\r\nAs we have already intimated, Mr. Sumner does not, like Mr. Seward,\r\nopenly denounce the Constitution of his country. On the contrary, he\r\nprofesses the most profound respect for every part of that instrument,\r\nnot even excepting the clause which demands the restoration of the\r\nfugitive from labor. But an examination of his argument, both\r\n_historical_ and _logical_, will enable us, we trust, to estimate this\r\nprofession at its real intrinsic worth.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin with his argument from history. In the examination of\r\nthis argument, we beg to excuse ourselves from any further notice of all\r\nthat vast array of historical proofs to show that \"freedom is national\r\nand slavery sectional.\"[212] We shall consider those proofs alone which\r\nrelate to the real point in controversy, namely, Has Congress the power\r\nto pass a Fugitive Slave Law?\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner argues, from the well-known sentiments of the framers of the\r\nConstitution with respect to slavery, that they intended to confer no\r\nsuch power on Congress. Thus, after quoting the sentiments of Gouverneur\r\nMorris, of Elbridge Gerry, of Roger Sherman, and James Madison, he adds:\r\n\"In the face of these unequivocal statements, it is absurd to suppose\r\nthat they consented _unanimously_ to any provision by which the National\r\nGovernment, the work of their own hands, could be made the most\r\noffensive instrument of slavery.\" Such is the historical argument of Mr.\r\nSumner. Let us see what it is worth.\r\n\r\nElbridge Gerry had said: \"We ought to be careful NOT _to give any\r\nsanction to slavery_;\"--language repeatedly quoted, and underscored as\r\nabove, by Mr. Sumner. It is absurd, he concludes, to suppose that a man\r\nwho could use such language had the least intention to confer a power on\r\nCongress to support slavery by the passage of a Fugitive Slave Law. This\r\nis one branch of his historical argument. It may appear perfectly\r\nconclusive to Mr. Sumner, and \"entirely impregnable\" to Mr. Chase; but,\r\nafter all, it is not quite so invulnerable as they imagine. Mr. Sumner\r\nstopped his historical researches at a most convenient point for his\r\nargument. If he had only read a little further, he would have discovered\r\nthat this same identical Elbridge Gerry was in the Congress of 1793, and\r\nVOTED FOR the Fugitive Slave Law then passed!\r\n\r\nIt fares no better with the historical argument to prove the opinion or\r\nintention of Roger Sherman. He had declared, it is true, that he was\r\nopposed to any clause in the Constitution \"acknowledging men to be\r\nproperty.\" But we should not, with Mr. Sumner, infer from this that he\r\nnever intended that Congress should possess a power to legislate in\r\nreference to slavery. For, unfortunately for such a conclusion, however\r\nconfidently it may be drawn, or however dogmatically asserted, Roger\r\nSherman himself was in the Senate of 1793, and was actually on the\r\ncommittee which reported the Fugitive Slave Law of that session! Thus,\r\nalthough the premiss of Mr. Sumner's argument is a historical fact, yet\r\nits conclusion comes directly into conflict with another historical\r\nfact!\r\n\r\nWe cannot, in the same way, refute the argument from the language of\r\nGouverneur Morris, who said \"that he never would concur in upholding\r\ndomestic slavery,\" because he was not in the Congress of 1793. But\r\nRobert Morris was there, and, although he helped to frame the\r\nConstitution in 1787, he uttered not a syllable against the\r\nconstitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Law. Indeed, this law passed the\r\nSenate by resolution simply, _the yeas and nays not having been called\r\nfor_!\r\n\r\nThe words of Mr. Madison, who \"thought it wrong to admit in the\r\nConstitution the idea that there could be property in man,\" are four or\r\nfive times quoted in Mr. Sumner's speech. As we have already seen,[213]\r\nthere cannot be, in the strict sense of the terms, \"property in man;\"\r\nfor the soul is the man, and no one, except God, can own the soul. Hence\r\nMr. Madison acted wisely, we think, in wishing to exclude such an\r\nexpression from the Constitution, inasmuch as it would have been\r\nmisunderstood by Northern men, and only shocked their feelings without\r\nanswering any good purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that slaves are property, we merely mean that their masters\r\nhave a right to their service or labor. This idea is recognized in the\r\nConstitution, and _this right is secured_. We ask no more. As Mr.\r\nMadison, and the whole South, had the _thing_, he did not care to\r\nwrangle about the _name_. We are told, again and again, that the word\r\n_slave_ does not appear in the Constitution. Be it so. We care not,\r\nsince our slaves are there recognized as \"persons held to service\" by\r\nthose to whom \"such service is due.\" It is repeated without end that the\r\n\"Constitution acts on slaves as _persons_, and not as property.\"\r\nGranted; and if Northern men will, according to the mandate of the\r\nConstitution, only deliver up our fugitive servants, we care not whether\r\nthey restore them as persons or as property. If we may only reclaim them\r\nas persons, and regain their service, we are perfectly satisfied. We\r\nutterly despise all such verbal quibbling.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison was above it. He acted wisely, we repeat, in refusing to\r\nshock the mind of any one, by insisting upon a mere word, and upon a\r\nword, too, which might not have conveyed a correct idea of his own\r\nviews. But that Mr. Madison could, as he undersood the terms, regard\r\nslaves as property, we have the most incontestable evidence. For in the\r\nConvention of Virginia, called to ratify the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, he said, \"Another clause secures us that _property_ which we now\r\npossess. At present, if any slave elopes to any of those States where\r\nslaves are free, he becomes emancipated by their laws, for the laws of\r\nthe States are uncharitable to one another in this respect.\" He then\r\nquotes the provision from the Constitution relative to fugitives from\r\nlabor, and adds: \"This clause was expressly inserted to enable _owners_\r\nof slaves to reclaim them.\" So much for Mr. Sumner's main argument from\r\nthe language of the members of the Convention of 1787.\r\n\r\nArguing from the sentiments of that convention with respect to slavery,\r\nhe concludes that nothing could have been further from their intentions\r\nthan to confer upon Congress the power to pass a uniform Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw. He boldly asserts, that if a proposition to confer such a power\r\nupon Congress had \"been distinctly made it would have been distinctly\r\ndenied.\" \"But no person in the convention,\" he says, \"_not one of the\r\nreckless partisans of slavery, was so audacious as to make the\r\nproposition_.\" Now we shall show that the above statement of his is\r\ndiametrically opposed to the truth. We shall show that the members of\r\nthe convention in question were perfectly willing to confer such a power\r\nupon Congress.\r\n\r\nThe reason why they were so is obvious to any one who has a real\r\nknowledge of the times about whose history Mr. Sumner so confidently\r\ndeclaims. This reason is well stated in the language of the Chancellor\r\nof New York whom we have already quoted. \"The provision,\" says he, \"as\r\nto persons escaping from servitude in one State into another, appears by\r\ntheir journal to have been adopted by a unanimous vote of the\r\nconvention. At that time the existence of involuntary servitude, or the\r\nrelation of master and servant, was known to and recognized by the laws\r\nof every State in the Union except Massachusetts, and _the legal right\r\nof recaption by the master existed in all_, AS A PART OF THE CUSTOMARY\r\nOR COMMON LAW OF THE WHOLE CONFEDERACY.\" Hence, instead of shocking the\r\nconvention, a clause recognizing such right would have been merely\r\ndeclaratory of the \"customary or common law,\" which then universally\r\nprevailed. The \"history of the times\" confirms this view, and furnishes\r\nno evidence against it.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner tries to make a different impression. He lays great stress on\r\nthe fact that it was not until late in the convention that the first\r\nclause relative to the surrender of fugitive slaves was introduced. But\r\nthis fact agrees more perfectly with our view than with his. There was\r\nno haste about the introduction of such a provision, because it was well\r\nknown that, whenever it should be introduced, it would pass in the\r\naffirmative without difficulty. And, in fact, when it was introduced, it\r\n\"WAS UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED.\" This single fact speaks volumes.\r\n\r\nLet us now attend, for a moment, to Mr. Sumner's historical proofs. He\r\nquotes the following passage from the Madison Papers:--\"Gen. (Charles\r\nCotesworth) Pinckney was not satisfied with it. He seemed to wish some\r\nprovision should be included in favor of property in slaves.\" \"But,\" by\r\nway of comment, Mr. Sumner adds, \"he made no proposition. Unwilling to\r\nshock the convention, and uncertain in his own mind, he only _seemed_\r\nto wish such a provision.\" Now, a bare abstract proposition to recognize\r\nproperty in men is one thing, and a clause to secure the return of\r\nfugitive slaves is quite another. The first, it is probable, would have\r\nbeen rejected by the convention; the last was actually and unanimously\r\nadopted by it.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's next proof is decidedly against him. Here it is \"Mr. Butler\r\nand Mr. Charles Pinckney, both from South Carolina, now moved openly to\r\nrequire 'fugitive slaves and servants to be delivered up like\r\ncriminals.' . . . . . . Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania, at once objected:\r\n'This would oblige the executive of the State to do it at the public\r\nexpense.' Mr. Sherman, of Connecticut, saw no more propriety in the\r\npublic seizing and surrendering a slave or servant than a horse! Under\r\nthe pressure of these objections the offensive proposition was quietly\r\nwithdrawn.\"\r\n\r\nNow mark the character of these objections. It is objected, not that it\r\nis wrong to deliver up fugitive slaves, but only that they should not be\r\n\"delivered up like criminals;\" that is, by a demand on the executive of\r\nthe State to which they may have fled. And this objection is based on\r\nthe ground that such a requisition would oblige the public to deliver\r\nthem up at its own expense. Mr. Sherman insists, not that it is wrong to\r\nsurrender fugitive slaves or fugitive horses, but only that the\r\nexecutive, or public, should not be called upon to surrender them.\r\nSurely, if these gentlemen had been so violently opposed to the\r\nrestoration of fugitive slaves, here was a fair occasion for them to\r\nspeak out; and as honest, outspoken men they would, no doubt, have made\r\ntheir sentiments known. But there is, in fact, not a syllable of such a\r\nsentiment uttered. There is not the slightest symptom of the existence\r\nof any such feeling in their minds. If any such existed, we must insist\r\nthat Mr. Sumner has discovered it by instinct, and not by his researches\r\nin history.\r\n\r\nThe statement that \"under the pressure of these objections the offensive\r\npropositon was _quietly withdrawn_\" is not true. It was not quietly\r\nwithdrawn; on the contrary, it was withdrawn with the assurance that it\r\nwould be again introduced. \"Mr. Butler withdrew his proposition,\" says\r\nMr. Madison, \"_in order that some particular provision might be made_,\r\napart from this article.\"[214] Accordingly, the very next day he\r\nintroduced a provision, which, as Mr. Madison declares, \"was expressly\r\ninserted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim them.\"\r\n\r\nThese glosses of Mr. Sumner on the history of the times will appear\r\nimportant, if we view them in connection with his design. This design is\r\nto bring into doubt the idea that slaves are embraced in the clause of\r\nthe Constitution which requires fugitives from service or labor to be\r\ndelivered up. We should not suspect this design from the hints here\r\nthrown out, if it were not afterward more fully disclosed. \"On the next\r\nday,\" says Mr. Sumner, \"August 29th, profiting by the suggestions\r\nalready made, Mr. Butler moved a proposition, substantially like that\r\nnow found in the Constitution, _not directly for the surrender of_\r\n'_fugitive slaves_,' as originally proposed, but as 'fugitives from\r\nservice or labor,' which, without debate or opposition of any kind, was\r\nunanimously adopted.\" Was it then unanimously adopted because it was a\r\nclause for the surrender of \"fugitives from service or labor\" only, and\r\nnot for the surrender of fugitive slaves?\r\n\r\nSuch appears to be the insinuation of Mr. Sumner. Be this as it may, it\r\nis certain that he has afterward said that it may be questioned whether\r\n\"the language employed\" in this clause \"can be judicially regarded as\r\njustly applicable to fugitive slaves, _which is often and earnestly\r\ndenied_.\". . . . \"_Still further_,\" he says, in italics, \"_to the courts\r\nof each State must belong the determination of the question, to which\r\nclass of persons, according to just rules of interpretation, the phrase\r\n'persons held to service or labor' is strictly applicable._\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner doubts, then, whether this provision, after all, refers to\r\n\"fugitive slaves.\" Now, although he has said much in regard to \"the\r\neffrontery of the Southern members of the convention\" that formed the\r\nConstitution, we may safely defy him, or any other man, to point to any\r\nthing in their conduct which approximates to such audacity. What! the\r\nclause in question not designed to embrace fugitive slaves? Mr. Butler,\r\neven before he introduced the clause, declared, as we have seen, that\r\nsuch would be its design. It was so understood by every member of the\r\nconvention; for there was not a man there who possessed the capacity to\r\nmisunderstand so plain a matter; and it has been so understood by every\r\nman, of all parties and all factions, from that day down to the present.\r\nNot one of the hired advocates who have been employed, in different\r\nStates, to argue against the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, has ever had the unblushing effrontery to contend that the clause\r\nin question is not applicable to fugitive slaves. Nay, more, until Mr.\r\nSumner appeared, the frantic zeal of no abolitionist had ever so\r\ncompletely besotted his intellect as to permit him to take such ground.\r\nBy Dr. Channing, by Mr. Seward, and by Mr. Chase, such application of\r\nthe words in question is unhesitatingly admitted; and hence we dismiss\r\nMr. Sumner's discovery with the contempt it deserves.\r\n\r\nBut to return. \"The provision,\" says Mr. Sumner, \"which showed itself\r\nthus tardily, and was so slightly noticed in the National Convention,\r\nwas neglected in most of the contemporaneous discussions before the\r\npeople.\" No wonder; for it was merely declaratory of the \"customary or\r\ncommon law\" of that day. \"In the Conventions of South Carolina, North\r\nCarolina, and Virginia,\" he admits, \"it was commended as securing\r\nimportant rights, though on this point there was a difference of\r\nopinion. In the Virginia Convention, an eminent character,--Mr. George\r\nMason,--with others, expressly declared that there was 'no security of\r\nproperty coming within this section.'\"\r\n\r\nNow, we shall not stickle about the fact that Mr. Sumner has not given\r\nthe very words of Mr. Mason, since he has given them in substance. But\r\nyet he has given them in such a way, and in such a connection, as to\r\nmake a false impression. The words of Mr. Mason, taken in their proper\r\nconnection, are as follows: \"We have no security for the property of\r\nthat kind (slaves) which we already have. There is no clause in this\r\nConstitution to secure it, _for they may lay such a tax as will amount\r\nto manumission_.\" This shows his position, not as it is misrepresented\r\nby Mr. Sumner, but as it stands in his own words. If slave property may\r\nbe rendered worthless by the taxation of Congress, how could it be\r\nsecured by a clause which enables the owner to reclaim it? It would not\r\nbe worth reclaiming. Such was the argument and true position of Mr.\r\nGeorge Mason.\r\n\r\n\"Massachusetts,\" continues Mr. Sumner, \"while exhibiting peculiar\r\nsensitiveness at any responsibility for slavery, seemed to view it with\r\nunconcern.\" If Massachusetts had only believed that the clause was\r\nintended to confer on Congress the power to pass a Fugitive Slave Law,\r\ninto what flames of indignation would her sensitiveness have burst! So\r\nMr. Sumner would have us to believe. But let us listen, for a moment, to\r\nthe sober voice of history.\r\n\r\nIt was only about four years after the government went into operation\r\nthat Congress actually exercised the power in question, and _passed a\r\nFugitive Slave Law_. Where was Massachusetts then! Did she burst into\r\nflames of indignation? Her only voice, in reply, was as distinctly and\r\nas emphatically pronounced in favor of that law as was the voice of\r\nVirginia itself. With a single exception, her whole delegation in\r\nCongress,[215] with Fisher Ames at their head, voted for the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law of 1793! Not a whisper of disapprobation was heard from their\r\nconstituents. As Mr. Sumner himself says, the passage of that act \"drew\r\nlittle attention.\" Hence he would have us to believe that Massachusetts\r\nwould have been stirred from her depths if the convention had conferred\r\nsuch a power upon Congress, and yet that she was not moved at all when\r\nCongress proceeded, as he maintains, to _usurp_ and exercise that power!\r\n\r\nThis is not all. Every member from the free States, with the exception\r\nof five, recorded his vote in favor of the same law.[216] In the Senate,\r\nas we have already said, it was passed by resolution, and not by a\r\nrecorded vote. No one, in either branch of Congress, uttered a syllable\r\nagainst the constitutionality of the law, though many of the most\r\ndistinguished members of the very convention which framed the\r\nConstitution itself were there. Not to mention others, there were James\r\nMadison, and Roger Sherman, and Elbridge Gerry, and Rufus King, and\r\nCaleb Strong, and Robert Morris, and Oliver Elsworth; and yet from not\r\none of these illustrious framers of the Constitution was a syllable\r\nuttered against the constitutionality of the law in question. Nay, the\r\nlaw was supported and enacted by themselves. What, then, in the face of\r\nthese indubitable facts, becomes of all Mr. Sumner's far-fetched\r\narguments from \"the literature of the age\" and from his multitudinous\r\nvoices against slavery? It is absurd, says Mr. Sumner, to suppose that\r\nsuch men intended to confer any power upon Congress to pass a Fugitive\r\nSlave Law. It is a _fact_, we reply, that as members of Congress they\r\nproceeded, without hesitation or doubt, to exercise that very power. It\r\n\"dishonors the memory of the fathers,\" says Mr. Sumner, to suppose they\r\nintended that Congress should possess such a power. How, then, will he\r\nvindicate the memory of the fathers against the imputation of his own\r\ndoctrine that they, as members of Congress, must have knowingly usurped\r\nthe power which, as members of the convention, they had intended not to\r\nconfer?\r\n\r\nOne more of Mr. Sumner's historical arguments, and we are done with this\r\nbranch of the subject. He deems it the most conclusive of all. It is\r\nfounded on the arrangement of certain clauses of the Constitution, and\r\nis, we believe, perfectly original. We must refer the reader to the\r\nspeech itself if he desire to see this very curious argument, since we\r\ncannot spare the room to give it a full and fair statement.\r\n\r\nNor is this at all necessary to our purpose, inasmuch as we intend to\r\nnotice only one thing about this argument, namely, the wonderful effect\r\nit produces on the mind of its inventor. \"The framers of the\r\nConstitution,\" says he, \"were wise and careful men, who had a reason for\r\nwhat they did, and who understood the language which they employed.\" We\r\ncan readily believe all this. Nor can we doubt that they \"had a design\r\nin the peculiar arrangement\" of the clauses adopted by them. That\r\ndesign, however, we feel quite sure, is different from the one\r\nattributed to them by Mr. Sumner. But let us suppose he is right, and\r\nthen see what would follow.\r\n\r\nThe design attributed to them by Mr. Sumner was to make every one see,\r\nbeyond the possibility of a mistake, that the Constitution confers no\r\npower on Congress to pass a Fugitive Slave Law. \"They not only decline\r\nall addition of any such power to the compact,\" says he, \"but, _to\r\nrender misapprehension impossible,--to make assurance doubly sure,--to\r\nexclude any contrary conclusion_, they punctiliously arrange,\" etc. Now,\r\nif such were the case, then we ask if design of so easy accomplishment\r\nwere ever followed by failure so wonderful?\r\n\r\nThey failed, in the first place, \"to exclude a contrary conclusion\" from\r\nthe Supreme Courts of Massachusetts, of New York, and of Pennsylvania,\r\nall of which tribunals have decided that they _did_ confer such a power\r\nupon Congress. In the second place, although those wise men labored to\r\nmake \"misapprehension impossible,\" yet, according to Mr. Sumner, the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States has entirely misapprehended them. So\r\nfar from seeing that the power in question is not granted to Congress,\r\nthis high tribunal decides that it is clearly and unquestionably\r\ngranted. This is not all. The most marvellous failure is yet to come.\r\nFor, after all their pains to make the whole world see their meaning,\r\nthese wise men did not see it themselves, but went away, many of them,\r\nand, in the Congress of 1793, helped to pass a Fugitive Slave Law!\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared, indeed, that the failure would have been absolutely\r\ntotal but for the wonderful sagacity of a few abolitionists. For the\r\ndesign imputed to the framers of the Constitution, and which they took\r\nso much pains to disclose, had remained profoundly concealed from nearly\r\nall men, not excepting themselves, until it was detected by Messrs.\r\nSumner, Chase, and company. But these have, at last, discovered it, and\r\nnow see it as in a flood of light. Indeed, they see it with such\r\ntranscendent clearness, with such marvellous perspicacity of vision, as\r\nto atone for the stupidity and blindness of the rest of mankind.\r\n\r\nSo much for Mr. Sumner's historical argument. His logical argument is,\r\nif possible, still more illogical than his historical. In regard to\r\nthis, however, we shall be exceedingly brief, as we are sick of his\r\nsophisms, and long to be delivered from the pursuit of them.\r\n\r\nHe encounters, at the outset, \"a difficulty\" in the legislation of the\r\nCongress of 1793 and in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\" But \"on examination,\" says he, \"this difficulty will\r\ndisappear.\" Perhaps difficulty so great never vanished so suddenly from\r\nbefore any other man.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Congress of 1793, though it contained so many of\r\nthe most distinguished framers of the Constitution, is annihilated by a\r\nfew bold strokes of Mr. Sumner's pen. One short paragraph, containing\r\ntwo ineffably weak arguments, does the business.\r\n\r\nThe first of these arguments is as follows: \"The act of 1793 proceeded\r\nfrom a Congress that had already recognized the United States Bank,\r\nchartered by a previous Congress, which, though sanctioned by the\r\nSupreme Court, has been since in high quarters pronounced\r\nunconstitutional. If it erred as to the bank, it may have erred also as\r\nto fugitives from labor.\" We cannot conceive why such an argument should\r\nhave been propounded, unless it were to excite a prejudice against the\r\nCongress of 1793 in the minds of those who may be opposed to a National\r\nBank. For if we look at its conclusion we shall see that it merely aims\r\nto establish a point which no one would deny. It merely aims to prove\r\nthat, as the Congress of 1793 was composed of fallible men, \"so it may\r\nhave erred!\" We admit the conclusion, and therefore pass by the inherent\r\nweaknesses in the structure of the argument.\r\n\r\nHis second argument is this: \"But the very act contains a capital\r\nerror[217] on this very subject, so declared by the Supreme Court, in\r\npretending to vest a portion of the judicial power of the nation in\r\nstate officers. _This error takes from the act all authority as an\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution_. I DISMISS IT.\" This passage,\r\nconsidered as an argument, is simply ridiculous. How many of the best\r\nlaws ever enacted by man have, in the midst of much that is as clear as\r\nnoonday, been found to contain an error! Should all, therefore, have\r\nbeen blindly rejected? As soon as the error has been detected, has any\r\nenlightened tribunal on earth ever said, \"I dismiss\" the whole?\r\n\r\nBy such a process we might have made as short work with Mr. Sumner's\r\nspeech. If, after pointing out one error therein, we had dismissed the\r\nwhole speech as worthless, we should have imitated his reasoning, and in\r\nour conclusion have come much nearer to the truth. If we should say,\r\nindeed, that because the sun has a spot on its surface it is therefore a\r\ngreat ball of darkness, our argument would be exactly like that of Mr.\r\nSumner. But that great luminary would not refuse to shine in obedience\r\nto our contemptible logic. In like manner, the authority of the\r\nillustrious Congress of 1793, in which there were so many profound\r\nstatesmen and pure patriots, will not be the less resplendent because\r\nMr. Charles Sumner has, with Titanic audacity and Lilliputian weakness,\r\nassailed it with one of the most pitiful of all the pitiful sophisms\r\nthat ever were invented by man.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the decision of the Supreme Court he says: \"Whatever maybe\r\nthe influence of this judgment as a rule to the judiciary, it can not\r\narrest our duty as legislators. And here I adopt, with entire assent,\r\nthe language of President Jackson, in his memorable veto, in 1832, of\r\nthe Bank of the United States.\" He then quotes this language, in which\r\nhe italicizes the following sentence: \"_Each public officer, who takes\r\nan oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support it as\r\nhe understands it, and not as it is understood by others._\" With these\r\nauthoritative words of Andrew Jackson,\" says he, \"I dismiss this topic.\r\nThe early legislation of Congress and the decisions of the Supreme Court\r\ncan not stand in our way. I advance to the argument.\" We shall let him\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nBut we must say a few words in conclusion. Mr. Sumner swears to support\r\nthe Constitution as he understands it; but how is it supported by him?\r\nIs it supported by him at all or in any way? Let us see. The clause\r\nrespecting \"persons held to service or labor,\" says he, imposes an\r\nobligation, not upon \"the National Government, but upon the States.\" Is\r\nhe then in favor of the States passing any law, or doing any act, by\r\nwhich fugitive slaves may be delivered up? \"Never,\" he replies.\r\nMassachusetts will never do any such thing by his advice or consent.\r\nSurely, then, he will speak a kind word to the good people of\r\nMassachusetts, and advise them to do nothing in violation of this solemn\r\ncompact of the Constitution. If he will do nothing to support the\r\ncompact, surely he will do nothing to break it down. He will not permit\r\nus to indulge any such charitable hope. For it is his _avowed_ object,\r\nby speech-making and by agitation, to create such a \"public opinion\" as\r\n\"shall blast with contempt, indignation, and abhorrence, all who, _in\r\nwhatever form_, or _under whatever name_, undertake to be agents\"[218]\r\nin reclaiming fugitive slaves. Yea, upon the very officers of the law\r\nthemselves, who, for this purpose, act under and by authority of the\r\nsupreme laws of the land, he pours down scorn and derision. Even these,\r\nthough in the discharge of an official duty, are--if it be in the power\r\nof Mr. Sumner--to be blasted with abhorrence, indignation, and contempt!\r\n\r\nThe Constitution declares that the fugitive slave \"shall be delivered\r\nup.\" He shall NOT \"be delivered up,\" says Mr. Sumner; and, in order to\r\nmake his words good, he means to create a \"public opinion,\" which no\r\nSouthern master dare encounter. Nay, he rejoices to believe that such\r\npublic opinion is, in some localities, already created and prepared for\r\nopen resistance to the Constitution of the United States. \"There are\r\nmany,\" says he, \"who will never shrink at any cost, and, notwithstanding\r\nall the atrocious penalties of this bill, from efforts to save a\r\nwandering fellow-man from bondage. They will offer him the shelter of\r\ntheir houses, and, IF NEED BE, WILL PROTECT HIS LIBERTY BY FORCE.\"[219]\r\nHorrible words! Words tending directly to a conflict in which the\r\nbrightest hopes of humanity must perish, and the glory of the Republic\r\nbe extinguished in oceans of blood.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such things, we are imperiously constrained to doubt Mr.\r\nSumner's regard for the obligation of the oath which binds him to\r\nsupport the Constitution of his country. It is certain that he can\r\nrejoice in the breach of this obligation by others. A certain judge in\r\nVermont, who, like every other State officer, had taken an oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States, just set Constitution,\r\nlaws, evidence, all at defiance, and boldly declared that the fugitive\r\nshould _not_ be delivered up, \"_unless the master could show a bill of\r\nsale from the Almighty_.\" This deed, which, in the language of\r\nChancellor Walworth, is stamped with \"the moral guilt of perjury,\"\r\nappears heroic to Mr. Sumner, by whom it is related with evident\r\ndelight. It would seem, indeed, as if the moral sensibility of an\r\nabolitionist of his stamp is all drawn to a single point of his\r\nconscience, so that it can feel absolutely nothing except slavery. It\r\nseems dead to the obligation of an oath, to the moral guilt of perjury.\r\nNay, it seems to rejoice in the very bravery of its perpetration,\r\nprovided it only enables a fugitive slave to effect his escape.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Sumner would seek to justify himself by declaring that the\r\nlanguage _fugitive from services_ does not include fugitive slaves. If\r\nso, we reply that the Vermont judge, whose infamous decision he\r\napproves, had no such fine pretext. It is Mr. Sumner, as we have seen,\r\nwho first suggested this most excellent method of reconciling conscience\r\nwith treachery to the Constitution. Though he professes the most\r\nprofound respect for that instrument, he deliberately sets to work to\r\nundermine one of its most clear and unequivocal mandates. He does not,\r\nlike Mr. Seward, openly smite the Constitution with his hand, or\r\ncontemptuously kick it with his foot. _He betrays it with a kiss._\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner admires the conduct of the Vermont judge; but he can heap the\r\nmost frantic abuse on the acts of the best men America has produced.\r\nThough they be the deliberate public acts of a Clay, or a Calhoun, or a\r\nWebster, or a GEORGE WASHINGTON, his language is not the less violent,\r\nnor his raving vituperation the less malignant. In regard to the\r\nFugitive Slave Law of 1850, he says: \"And still further, as if to do a\r\ndeed which should 'make heaven weep, all earth amazed,' this same\r\nCongress, in disregard of all the cherished safeguards of freedom, has\r\npassed a most cruel, unchristian, devilish act.\" The great difficulty\r\nunder which Mr. Sumner labors, and which all the energy of his soul\r\nstruggles to surmount, is to find language violent enough in which to\r\ndenounce this \"foul enactment,\" this \"detestable and heaven-defying\r\nbill,\" this \"monster act,\" which \"sets at naught the best principles of\r\nthe Constitution and the very laws of God!\"\r\n\r\nNow, this bill, let it be remembered, is liable to no objection which\r\nmay not be urged against the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793. It will not be\r\ndenied, indeed, that if the one of these laws be unconstitutional so\r\nalso is the other, and that both must stand or fall together. Let it\r\nalso be borne in mind that, as the one received the support of a Clay,\r\nand a Calhoun, and a Webster, so the other received the sanction and the\r\nsignature of George Washington. Yet, in the face of these facts, Mr.\r\nSumner does not moderate his rage. They only seem to increase the\r\nintensity and the fury of his wrath. \"The soul sickens,\" he cries, \"in\r\nthe contemplation of this legalized outrage. In the dreary annals of the\r\npast there are many acts of shame--there are many ordinances of\r\nmonarchs, and laws which have become a byword and a hissing to the\r\nnations. But when we consider the country and the age, I ask fearlessly,\r\nwhat act of shame, what ordinance of monarch, what law, can compare in\r\natrocity with this enactment of an American Congress?\"\r\n\r\nNot content with pouring floods of abuse on the law itself, Mr. Sumner\r\nproceeds to consign to infamy its authors and all who have given it\r\ntheir support. For, after furnishing examples of what he deems among the\r\nmost atrocious transactions of the past, he adds: \"I would not\r\nexaggerate. I wish to keep within bounds; but _I think no person can\r\ndoubt_ that the condemnation affixed to all these transactions and to\r\ntheir authors must be the lot hereafter of the Fugitive Slave Bill, and\r\nof every one, according to the measure of his influence, who gave it his\r\nsupport. Into the immortal catalogue of national crimes this law has now\r\npassed, drawing with it, by an inexorable necessity, its authors also,\r\nand chiefly him who, as President of the United States, set his name to\r\nthe bill, and breathed into it that final breath without which it would\r\nhave no life. Other Presidents may be forgotten, but the name signed to\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Bill can never be forgotten. There are depths of\r\ninfamy, as there are hights of fame. I regret to say what I must, but\r\ntruth compels me. Better far for him had he never been born; better for\r\nhis memory, and for the name of his children, had he never been\r\nPresident!\"\r\n\r\nIf neither Mr. Fillmore nor George Washington swore to support the\r\nConstitution as Mr. Sumner understands it, we beg him to consider that\r\n_his opinion was not known_ when they took the oath of office. Mr.\r\nFillmore had, at that time, no better guide to go by than the decisions\r\nof the most enlightened judicial tribunals of his country, with the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States at their head. He was not so far\r\nraised above other men, nor possessed of so wonderful an insight into\r\nthe Constitution, as Mr. Sumner; for he could understand it no better\r\nthan its framers. Hence he was, no doubt, so conscious of his own\r\nfallibility that he could hardly look upon modesty as a crime, or upon a\r\ndeference to the judicial tribunals of his country as infamous. We\r\ntrust, therefore, that his good name will survive, and that his children\r\nwill not blush to own it. It is certain that the American people will\r\nnever believe, on the bare authority of Mr. Sumner, that, in his course\r\nregarding the Fugitive Slave Law, he planted his feet in the very\r\n\"depths of infamy,\" when they can so clearly see that he merely trod in\r\nthe footsteps of George Washington.\r\n\r\nIf what a man lacks in reason he could only make up in rage, then, after\r\nall, it would have to be concluded that Mr. Sumner is a very respectable\r\nSenator; for, surely, the violence of his denunciations is almost as\r\nremarkable as the weakness of his logic. Fortunately, however, it can\r\nhurt no one except himself or those whom he represents. Certainly, the\r\nbrightest names in the galaxy of American statesmen are not to be swept\r\naway by the filthy torrent of his invectives. The Clays, the Calhouns,\r\nthe Websters, and the Washingtons of America, are, indeed, as far above\r\nthe impotent rage of this Senator as the very stars of heaven are beyond\r\nhis arm.[220]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ III. _The right of Trial by Jury not impaired by the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw._\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that the power to enact such a law does not reside in\r\nCongress, because no such power has been \"expressly delegated,\" and\r\nbecause it is not \"necessary and proper\" to carry any expressly\r\ndelegated authority into effect. We should have replied to this\r\nargument; but it has been urged before every tribunal in which the great\r\nquestion under consideration has been tried, and everywhere refuted. By\r\nMr. Justice Nelson, in the Supreme Court of New York,[221] by Mr.\r\nSenator Bishop, in the Court of Errors in the same State,[222] and by\r\nMr. Justice Story, in the Supreme Court of the United States, it has\r\nbeen so clearly, so powerfully, and so triumphantly demolished as to\r\nleave nothing more to be desired on the subject. And besides, it has\r\nbeen our object not so much to refute arguments against the law in\r\nquestion, or to establish that which has been so long established,[223]\r\nas to show on what slender grounds, and yet with what unbounded\r\nconfidence, the greatest champions of abolitionism are accustomed to\r\noppose the Constitution, the laws, the judicial decisions, and the\r\nuniform practice, of the whole government under which we live.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this design, there is another sophism of theirs, which\r\nit now devolves upon us to examine. We allude to the argument that the\r\nFugitive Slave Law is unconstitutional, because it denies the right of\r\ntrial by jury.\r\n\r\nIs this still an open question? In the biography of Mr. Justice Story,\r\npublished by his son, it is said: \"The argument that the Act of 1793 was\r\nunconstitutional, because it did not provide for a trial by jury\r\naccording to the requisitions of the sixth article in the amendment to\r\nthe Constitution, having been suggested to my father on his return from\r\nWashington, he replied that this question was not argued by counsel nor\r\nconsidered by the court, and that he should still consider it an open\r\none.\" Mr. Sumner adduces this \"distinct statement that the necessity of\r\ntrial by jury was not before the court;\" and adds, \"So that, in the\r\nestimation of the judge himself, it was still an open question.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case here referred to--Prigg _v._ The Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania, reported in XVI. Peters--it is true that the question of\r\ntrial by jury was not argued by counsel nor considered by the court. But\r\nif the greater includes the less, then this question was embraced in the\r\ndecision; for, in that case, Prigg had seized the fugitive slave without\r\nprocess, and carried her away without any certificate from magistrate or\r\njudge in the State of Pennsylvania. The court declared that he had a\r\nright to do so under and by virtue of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. Most assuredly, if he had a constitutional right to such\r\nproceeding, then, in such cases, the Constitution dispenses with the\r\nnecessity of trial by jury.\r\n\r\nIt was urged by counsel that such summary method of reclaiming fugitive\r\nslaves was unconstitutional; but the court decided otherwise. It was\r\ninsisted by Mr. Hambly, just as it is now insisted by Mr. Sumner and\r\nothers, that such arrest was unconstitutional, because it was made by\r\nthe mere will of the party, and not, as the Constitution requires, \"by\r\ndue process of law.\" Thus the point was presented by the record, argued\r\nby the counsel, and overruled by the court.\r\n\r\nIn overruling this argument the court says: \"The owner must, therefore,\r\nhave the right to seize and repossess the slave which the local laws of\r\nhis own State confer upon him as property; and we all know that this\r\nright of seizure and recaption is universally acknowledged in all the\r\nslaveholding States. Indeed, this is no more than a mere affirmance of\r\nthe principles of the common law applicable to this very subject.\" Then,\r\nafter a quotation from Blackstone, the court adds: \"Upon this ground, we\r\nhave not the slightest hesitation in holding that, under and in virtue\r\nof the Constitution, the owner of a slave is clothed with entire\r\nauthority in every State in the Union to seize and recapture his slave\r\nwhenever he can do it without any breach of the peace or any illegal\r\nviolence.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this opinion of the court--delivered by Mr. Justice\r\nStory--Mr. Chief Justice Taney says: the master \"has a right, peaceably,\r\nto take possession of him, and carry him away, without any certificate\r\nor warrant from a judge of the District or Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates, or from any magistrate of the State; and whosoever resists or\r\nobstructs him is a wrong-doer; and every State law which proposes,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to authorize such resistance or obstruction, is\r\nnull and void, and affords no justification to the individual or the\r\nofficer of the State who acts under it. This right of the master being\r\ngiven by the Constitution of the United States, neither Congress nor a\r\nState Legislature can by any law or regulation impair it or restrict\r\nit.[224]\r\n\r\nHence it would have been well if Mr. Sumner and the son of Judge Story\r\nhad looked into this decision again before they proclaimed the opinion\r\nthat the right of trial by jury is, in such cases, still an open\r\nquestion. Mr. Justice Story himself must, on reflection, have seen that\r\nthe off-hand expression attributed to him was erroneous. His more\r\ndeliberate opinion is recorded, not only in the case of Prigg, but also\r\nin his \"Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States.\" \"It is\r\nobvious,\" says he, \"that these provisions for the arrest and removal of\r\nfugitives of both classes contemplate summary ministerial proceedings,\r\nand not the ordinary courts of judicial investigations to ascertain\r\nwhether the complaint be well-founded or the claim of ownership be\r\nestablished beyond all legal controversy. In cases of suspected crimes\r\nthe guilt or innocence of the party is to be made out at his trial, and\r\nnot upon the preliminary inquiry whether he shall be delivered up. All\r\nthat would seem in such cases to be necessary is that there should be\r\n_primâ facie_ evidence before the executive authority to satisfy its\r\njudgment that there is probable cause to believe the party guilty, such\r\nas, upon an ordinary warrant, would justify his commitment for trial.\r\nAnd in the cases of fugitive slaves there would seem to be the same\r\nnecessity of requiring only _primâ facie_ proofs of ownership, without\r\nputting the party to a formal assertion of his rights by a suit at the\r\ncommon law.\"[225]\r\n\r\nBut, since the abolitionists will discuss this point, then let it be\r\nconsidered an open question, and let them produce their arguments. The\r\nfirst we shall notice is from Mr. Sumner, who again reasons from the\r\nsentiments of the fathers. \"At the close of the National Convention,\"\r\nsays he, \"Elbridge Gerry refused to sign the Constitution, because,\r\namong other things, it established 'a tribunal _without juries_, a Star\r\nChamber as to civil cases.' Many united in his opposition, and, on the\r\nrecommendation of the First Congress, this additional safeguard was\r\nadopted as an amendment.\" Thus, according to Mr. Sumner, Elbridge Gerry\r\nwas the father of the clause in the Constitution which guarantees the\r\nright of trial by jury. Yet Elbridge Gerry never dreamed of applying\r\nthis clause to the case of fugitive slaves; for, as we have already\r\nseen, he voted for the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793, in which such\r\napplication of it is denied. Nor did any other member of that Congress\r\npropose the right of trial by jury in such cases.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there would have been opposition to the act of 1793 if any\r\nmember of Congress had supposed, for a moment, that it denied the right\r\nof trial by jury to the fugitive slave. It does no such thing. It leaves\r\nthat right unimpaired; and if any slave in the Union, whether fugitive\r\nor otherwise, desire such trial, it is secured to him by the\r\nConstitution and laws of the country. But he cannot have such trial\r\nwhere or in what State he chooses. If he lives in Richmond, he may have\r\na trial by jury there; but he cannot escape to Boston, and there demand\r\nthis as a right. The fugitive from labor, like the fugitive from\r\njustice, has a right to a trial by jury, but neither can claim to have\r\nthis trial in any part of the world he pleases. The latter must be tried\r\nin \"the vicinage\" where the offense is alleged to have been committed,\r\nbecause there the witnesses are to be found. He has no right to flee\r\nfrom these and require them to follow him with their testimony. As he\r\nhas a constitutional right to be tried in the vicinage of the alleged\r\noffense, so has the commonwealth a right to insist on his trial there.\r\nIn like manner, and for a similar reason, if the colored man wishes to\r\nassert his freedom under the law, he may appeal to a jury of the\r\ncountry; but this must be done in the State under whose laws he is\r\nclaimed as a slave and where the witnesses reside. He cannot fly to a\r\ndistant State, and there demand a kind of trial which neither the\r\nConstitution, nor the laws, nor public expediency, secures to him. If he\r\nassert this right at all, he must assert it in conformity with the\r\n_undoubted right of the other party_, which is to be sued in this, as in\r\nall other personal actions, in the place where he resides.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these considerations, it is no wonder that the Congress\r\nof 1793 were so unanimous in regard to the Fugitive Slave Law. Though\r\nthis law did not provide for a jury trial, yet its authors all knew that\r\nsuch trial was not denied to the fugitive slave, if he had a mind to\r\nclaim it. Hence the law was passed by that Congress, without even an\r\nallusion to this modern abolition objection to its constitutionality.\r\nAmong all the members of that body who had taken part in framing the\r\nConstitution of the United States,[226] not one was found to hint at\r\nsuch an objection. This objection is of more recent origin, if not of\r\nless respectable parentage.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the law in question, allowing a trial by jury to the\r\nfugitive slave in a distant State, would indeed be a virtual denial of\r\nthe constitutional right of the master. Either because the jury could\r\nnot agree, or because distant testimony might be demanded, the trial\r\nwould probably be continued, and put off, until the expense, the loss of\r\ntime, and the worriment of vexatious proceedings, would be more than the\r\nslave is worth. The language of Mr. Chief Justice Taney, in relation to\r\nan action for damages by the master, is peculiarly applicable to such a\r\ntrial by jury. The master \"_would be compelled_,\" says he, \"_to\r\nencounter the costs and expenses of a suit, prosecuted at a distance\r\nfrom his own home, and to sacrifice perhaps the value of his property\r\nin endeavoring_ to obtain compensation.\" This is not the kind of\r\nremedy, says he, the Constitution \"intended to give. The delivery of the\r\nproperty itself--its PROMPT AND IMMEDIATE DELIVERY--_is plainly\r\nrequired, and was intended to be secured_.\" Such prompt and immediate\r\ndelivery was a part of \"the customary or common law\" at the time the\r\nConstitution was adopted, and its framers, no doubt, intended that this\r\npractice should be enforced by the clause in question, as appears from\r\nthe fact that so many of them concurred in the Act of 1793.\r\n\r\nBut if such right to a prompt and immediate delivery be guaranteed by\r\nthe Constitution itself, then, with all due submission, we would ask,\r\nwhat power has Congress to limit or abridge this right? If under and by\r\nvirtue of the Constitution this right to a prompt and immediate delivery\r\nbe secured, then what power has Congress to say there shall _not_ be a\r\nprompt or immediate delivery? \"This right of the master,\" says Mr. Chief\r\nJustice Taney, \"being given by the Constitution of the United States,\r\nNEITHER CONGRESS NOR A STATE LEGISLATURE CAN BY ANY LAW OR REGULATION\r\nIMPAIR IT OR RESTRICT IT.\" If this be sound doctrine,--and such we hold\r\nit to be,--then Congress has no constitutional power to impair or\r\nrestrict the right in question, by giving the fugitive slave a trial by\r\njury in the State to which he may have fled. This would not be to give a\r\n\"prompt and immediate delivery,\" such as the Supreme Court declares the\r\nmaster is entitled to by the Constitution itself; it would be either to\r\ngive no delivery at all, or else one attended with such delays,\r\nvexations, and costs, as would materially impair, if not wholly\r\nannihilate, the right in question.\r\n\r\nIt is right and proper, we think, that questions arising exclusively\r\nunder our own laws should be tried in our own States and by our own\r\ntribunals. Hence we shall never consent, unless constrained by the\r\njudicial decision of the Supreme Court of the Union, to have such\r\nquestions tried in States whose people and whose juries may, perhaps, be\r\nhostile to our interests and to our domestic institutions. For we are\r\nSOVEREIGN as well as they.\r\n\r\nOnly conceive such a trial by jury in a Northern State, with such an\r\nadvocate for the fugitive slave as Mr. Chase, or Mr. Sumner, or some\r\nother flaming abolitionist! There sits the fugitive slave,--\"one of the\r\nheroes of the age,\" as Mr. Sumner calls him, and the very embodiment of\r\npersecuted innocence. On the other hand is the master,--the vile\r\n\"slave-hunter,\" as Mr. Sumner delights to represent him, and whom, if\r\npossible, he is determined \"to blast with contempt, indignation, and\r\nabhorrence.\" The trial begins. The advocate appeals to the prejudices\r\nand the passions of the jury. He denounces slavery--about which neither\r\nhe nor the jury know any thing--as the epitome of all earthly wrongs, as\r\nthe sum and substance of all human woes. Now, suppose that on the jury\r\nthere is _only one man_, who, like the Vermont judge, requires \"a bill\r\nof sale from the Almighty\" before he will deliver up a fugitive slave;\r\nor who, like Mr. Seward, sets his own private opinion above the\r\nConstitution of his country; or who, like Mr. Sumner, has merely sworn\r\nto support the supreme law as he understands it; and who, at the same\r\ntime, possesses his capacity to understand it just exactly as he\r\npleases: then what chance would the master have for a verdict? Just none\r\nat all. For that one man, however clear the master's evidence, would\r\nhang the jury, and the cause would have to be tried over again.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the whole twelve jurors should decide according to the law\r\nand the evidence, and give a verdict in favor of the claimant; would his\r\nrights then be secured? Very far from it. For there is the eager crowd,\r\nwhich never fails to flock to such trials, and which the inflammatory\r\neloquence of the advocate has now wrought into a frenzy. Cannot such\r\ncrowd, think you, furnish a mob to effect by force what every member of\r\nthe jury had refused to accomplish by falsehood? If the master--if the\r\nabhorred \"slave-hunter\"--should escape from such a crowd with a sound\r\nbody only, and without his property, he ought, we think, to deem himself\r\nexceedingly fortunate.\r\n\r\nMr. Winthrop, of Massachusetts, has advocated a trial by jury in such\r\ncases. He was, no doubt, perfectly sincere in the belief expressed by\r\nhim, that under such a provision more fugitive slaves would be reclaimed\r\nthan under the law as it now stands. But it is equally certain that\r\nneither Mr. Seward nor Mr. Chase was of this opinion when the one\r\nproposed, and the other voted for, a trial by jury in such cases.\r\nNeither of these Senators, we think we may confidently affirm, intended\r\nto aid the master in reclaiming his fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, sir,\" says Mr. Winthrop, \"I shall vote for the amendment\r\noffered by the Senator from New Jersey, as right and just in itself,\r\nwhatever may be its effects.\" That is to say, whatever may be the\r\neffect of a jury trial in such cases, he means to vote for it _as right\r\nand just in itself_! Whether this were a burst of passion merely, or the\r\ndeliberate conviction of the author of it, we are not able to determine,\r\nbut we shall trust it was the former. For surely such an opinion, if\r\ndeliberately entertained, is creditable neither to a Senator nor to a\r\njurist. Neither this, nor any other mode of trial, is \"right in itself;\"\r\nand when right at all, it is only so as a means to an end. It is only\r\nright when it subserves the great end of justice; and if it fail to\r\nanswer this end it is then worse than worthless. Hence the statesman who\r\ndeclares that, \"_whatever may be the effects_\" of a particular mode of\r\ntrial, he will nevertheless support it \"as right and just in itself,\"\r\nthereby announces that he is prepared to sacrifice the end to the\r\nmeans,--a sentiment which, we venture to affirm, is more worthy of a\r\nfanatical declaimer than of the high-minded and accomplished Senator by\r\nwhom it was uttered.\r\n\r\nThe great objection urged against the Fugitive Slave Law is that under\r\nit a freeman may be seized and reduced to slavery. This law, as well as\r\nevery other, may, no doubt, be grossly abused, and made a cover for evil\r\ndeeds. But is there no remedy for such evil deeds. Is there no\r\nprotection for the free blacks of the North, except by a denial of the\r\nclear and unquestionable constitutional rights of the South? If not,\r\nthen we should be willing to submit; but there is a remedy against such\r\nfoul abuse of the law of Congress in question, and, as we conceive, a\r\nmost ample remedy.\r\n\r\nThe master may recapture his fugitive slave. This is his constitutional\r\nright. But, in the language of the Supreme Court of New York, already\r\nquoted, if a villain, under cover of a pretended right, proceeds to\r\ncarry off a freeman, he does so \"_at his peril, and would be answerable\r\nlike any other trespasser or kidnapper_.\" He must be caught, however,\r\nbefore he can be punished. Let him be caught, let the crime be proved\r\nupon him, and we would most heartily concur in the law by which he\r\nshould himself be doomed to slavery for life in the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nThe Fugitive Slave Law is not the only one liable to abuse. The innocent\r\nmay be, and often have been, arrested for crime; but this is no reason\r\nwhy the law of arrest should be abolished, or even impaired in its\r\noperation. Nay, innocent persons have often been maliciously prosecuted;\r\nyet no one, on this account, ever dreamed of throwing obstacles in the\r\nway of prosecution for crime. The innocent have been made the victims\r\nof perjury; but who imagines that all swearing in courts of justice\r\nshould therefore be abolished? Such evils and such crimes are sought to\r\nbe remedied by separate legislation, and not by undermining the laws of\r\nwhich they are the abuses. In like manner, though we wish to see the\r\nfree blacks of the North protected, and would most cheerfully lend a\r\nhelping hand for that purpose, yet, at the same time, we would maintain\r\nour own constitutional rights inviolate. The villain who, under cover of\r\nthe law made for the protection of our rights, should seek to invade the\r\nrights of Northern freemen, is as much abhorred by us as by any\r\nabolitionists on earth. Nor, on the other hand, have we any sympathy\r\nwith those who, under cover of a law _to be made_ for the protection of\r\nthe free blacks of the North, seek to invade the rights of the South. We\r\nhave no sympathy with either class of kidnappers.\r\n\r\nIs it not wonderful that, while the abolitionists of the North create\r\nand keep up so great a clamor about the danger their free blacks are in,\r\nthey do so little, and ask so little, either by legislation or\r\notherwise, in order to protect them, except in such manner, or by such\r\nlegislation, as shall aim a deadly blow at the rights and interests of\r\nthe South? If they really wish to protect their free blacks, and if the\r\nlaws are not already sufficient for that purpose, we are more than\r\nwilling to assist in the passage of more efficient ones. But we are not\r\nwilling to abandon the great right which the Constitution spreads, like\r\nan impenetrable shield, over Southern property to the amount of sixteen\r\nhundred millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe complaint in regard to the want of protection for the free blacks of\r\nthe North is without just foundation. In the case of Jack _v._ Martin,\r\ndecided in the Court of Errors of New York, we find the following\r\nlanguage, which is here exactly in point:--\"It was contended on the\r\nargument of this cause, with great zeal and earnestness, that, under the\r\nlaw of the United States, a freeman might be dragged from his family and\r\nhome into captivity. This is supposing an extreme case, as I believe it\r\nis not pretended any such ever has occurred, or that any complaint of\r\nthat character has ever been made; at all events, I cannot regard it as\r\na very potent argument. The same position might as well be taken in the\r\ncase of a fugitive from justice. It might be assumed that he was an\r\ninnocent man, and entitled to be tried by a jury of the State where he\r\nwas arrested, to ascertain whether he had violated the laws of the State\r\nfrom which he fled; whereas the fact is, the executive of this State\r\nwould feel bound to deliver up the most exalted individual in this\r\nState, (however well satisfied he might be of his innocence,) if a\r\nrequisition was made upon him by the executive of another State.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same case, when before the Supreme Court of New York, the court\r\nsaid: \"In the case under review, the proceedings are before a magistrate\r\nof our own State, presumed to possess a sympathy with his\r\nfellow-citizens, and _where, upon the supposition that a freeman is\r\narrested, he may readily procure the evidence of his freedom_. If the\r\nmagistrate should finally err in granting the certificate, _the party\r\ncan still resort to the protection of the national judiciary. The\r\nproceedings by which his rights have been invaded being under a law of\r\nCongress, the remedy for error or injustice belongs peculiarly to that\r\nhigh tribunal._ UNDER THEIR AMPLE SHIELD, THE APPREHENSION OF CAPTIVITY\r\nAND OPPRESSION CAN NOT BE ALARMING.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that when this opinion was pronounced by the Supreme Court\r\nof New York, it had not fathomed the depths of some men's capacity of\r\nbeing alarmed by apprehensions of captivity and oppression. The\r\nabolitionists will, whether or no, be most dreadfully alarmed. But the\r\ndanger consists, not in the want of laws and courts to punish the\r\nkidnapper, but in the want of somebody to catch him. If he does all the\r\nmischief ascribed to him by the abolitionists, is it not wonderful that\r\nhe is not caught by them? Rumor, with her thousand tongues, is clamorous\r\nabout his evil deeds; and fanatical credulity, with her ten thousand\r\nears, gives heed to the reports of rumor. But yet, somehow or other, the\r\nabolitionists, with all their fiery, restless zeal, never succeed in\r\nlaying their hands on the offender himself. He must, indeed, be a most\r\nadroit, a most cunning, a most wonderful rogue. He boldly goes into a\r\ncommunity in which so many are all eye, all ear, and all tongue, in\r\nregard to the black man's rights; he there steals a free negro, who\r\nhimself has the power to tell when, where, and how, he became free; and\r\nyet, in open day, and amid ten thousand flaming guardians of\r\nfreedom,[227] he escapes with perfect impunity! Is he not a most\r\nmarvelous proper rogue? But perhaps the reason the abolitionists do not\r\nlay hands on him is that he is an imaginary being, who, though\r\nintangible and invisible, will yet serve just as well to create an alarm\r\nand keep up a great excitement as if he were a real personage.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ IV. _The duty of the Citizen in regard to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States._\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, it is agreed on all sides, is \"the supreme law of the\r\nland,\"--of every State in the Union. The first duty of the citizen in\r\nregard to the Constitution is, then, to respect and obey each and every\r\none of its provisions. If he repudiates or sets at naught this or that\r\nprovision thereof, because it does not happen to agree with his own\r\nviews or feelings, he does not respect the Constitution at all; he makes\r\nhis own will and pleasure the supreme law. The true principle of loyalty\r\nresides not in his bosom. We may apply to him, and to the supreme law of\r\nthe land, the language of an inspired apostle, that \"whosoever shall\r\nkeep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.\"\r\nHe is guilty of all, because, by his willful disobedience in the one\r\ninstance, he sets at naught the authority by which the whole was\r\nordained and established.\r\n\r\nIn opposing the Fugitive Slave Law, it is forgotten by the abolitionists\r\nthat, if no such law existed, the master would have, under the\r\nConstitution itself, the same right to reclaim his fugitive from labor,\r\nand to reclaim him in the same summary manner; for, as we have seen, the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States has decided that by virtue of the\r\nConstitution alone the master has a right to pursue and reclaim his\r\nfugitive slave, without even a writ or legal process. Hence, in opposing\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law because it allows a summary proceeding in such\r\ncases, the abolitionists really make war on the Constitution. The\r\nbattery which they open against the Constitution is merely masked behind\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law; and thus the nature of their attack is concealed\r\nfrom the eyes of their non-legal followers.\r\n\r\nBut, says Mr. Chase, of Ohio, I do not agree with the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States. I oppose not the Constitution, but the decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court. \"A decision of the Supreme Court,\" says he, \"cannot\r\nalter the Constitution.\" This is very true; but then, on the other\r\nhand, it is equally true that neither can his opinion alter the\r\nConstitution. But here the question arises, which is the rule of conduct\r\nfor the true and loyal citizen,--the decision of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, or the opinion of Governor Chase? We decidedly prefer\r\nthe former. \"Sir,\" says Mr. Chase, \"when gentlemen from the slave States\r\nask us to support the Constitution, I fear they mean only their\r\n_construction_ of the Constitution.\" We mean not so. We mean neither\r\n_our_ nor _his_ construction of the Constitution, but that construction\r\nonly which has been given to it by the highest judicial tribunal in the\r\nland, by the supreme and final arbiter in all such conflicts of opinion.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Chase opposes argument as well as opinion to the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court in regard to slavery. \"What more natural,\" says he, \"than\r\nthat gentlemen from the slave States, in view of the questions likely to\r\ncome before the Supreme Court, should desire that a majority of its\r\nmembers might have interests like those which they would desire to\r\nmaintain! _Certain it is that some care has been taken to secure such a\r\nconstitution of the court, and not without success._\" If Mr. Chase, or\r\nany other abolitionist, should insinuate that the decision in question\r\nis owing to such an unfair constitution of the Supreme Court, the answer\r\nis as easy and triumphant as the accusation would be infamous and vile;\r\nfor, as is well known, the very decision which is so obnoxious to his\r\nsentiments was delivered by the great jurist of Massachusetts, Mr.\r\nJustice Story, and was concurred in by the other Northern members of the\r\nCourt. This is not all. How did it happen that substantially the same\r\ndecision has been rendered by the Supreme Courts of New York,\r\nMassachusetts, and Pennsylvania? Were these high tribunals also\r\nconstituted with reference to the peculiar interests of the South?\r\n\r\nThe question is not whether the decision of the Supreme Court, or the\r\nopinion of Mr. Chase, the more perfectly reflects the Constitution. Even\r\nif he were infallible, as the Supreme Court certainly is not, we, the\r\npeople of the United States, have not agreed that he shall decide such\r\nquestions for us. And besides, it would be difficult, perhaps, to\r\npersuade the people that he is, for the determination of such questions,\r\nany more happily constituted than the Supreme Court itself, with all the\r\nmanifold imperfections of its Southern members. But, however this may\r\nbe, it is certain that until the people shall be so persuaded, and\r\nshall agree to abide by his opinions, it is the duty of the good citizen\r\nto follow the decisions of the great judicial tribunal provided by the\r\nConstitution of his country.\r\n\r\nIf you, good citizen of the North, have a right to set up your opinion\r\nin opposition to such decisions, then I have the same right, and so has\r\nevery other member of the commonwealth. Thus, as many constructions of\r\nthe Constitution would necessarily result as there are individual\r\nopinions in the land. Law and order would be at an end; a chaos of\r\nconflicting elements would prevail, and every man would do that which\r\nseemed right in his own eyes. The only escape from such anarchy is a\r\njust and loyal confidence in the judicial tribunals of the land--is a\r\nsubjection of the intense egotism of the individual to the will of the\r\nnation, as expressed in the Constitution and expounded by the\r\nconstitutional authorities. Hence, we mean to support the Constitution,\r\nnot as _we_ understand it nor as _you_ understand it, but as it is\r\nunderstood by the Supreme Court of the United States. Such, it seems to\r\nus, is the only wise course--nay, is the imperative duty--of every\r\ncitizen who does not intend to disorganize the fundamental law and\r\nrevolutionize the government of his country.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed, perhaps, by those who have reflected little on the\r\nsubject, that the controversy respecting the Fugitive Slave Law is\r\nmerely about the value of a few slaves. It is, in our opinion, far\r\notherwise; it is a great constitutional question; and hence the deep\r\ninterest which it has excited throughout the nation, as well as in the\r\nSenate of the United States. It is a question, as it appears to us,\r\nwhether the Constitution or the abolitionists shall rule the country.\r\nThe Fugitive Slave Law is, as we have seen, surrounded by the strongest\r\npossible evidences of its constitutionality; and hence, if this may be\r\nswept away as unconstitutional by the passions of a mad faction, then\r\nmay every other legal defence be leveled before like storms, and all\r\nsecurity annihilated. Hence, as the friends of law and order, we intend\r\nto take our stand right here, and defend this Act, which, although\r\ndespised and abhorred by a faction, has received the sanction of the\r\nfathers, as well as of the great judicial tribunals, of the land.\r\n\r\nWe are asked to repeal this law--ay, by the most violent agitator of the\r\nNorth we are asked to repeal this law--for \"_the sake of tranquillity\r\nand peace_!\" But how can this bring peace? Suppose this law were\r\nrepealed; would tranquillity be restored? We have not forgotten--nor can\r\nwe be so easily made to forget--that this very agitator himself has\r\ndeclared, that slavery is \"a wrong so transcendent\" that no truce is to\r\nbe allowed to it so long as it occupies a single foot of ground in the\r\nUnited States. Is it not, then, a delusive prospect of peace which is\r\noffered to us in exchange for the law in question?\r\n\r\nNor can we forget what other agitators have uttered respecting the\r\nabolition of slavery in the Southern States. \"Slavery,\" said Mr. Seward,\r\nat a mass-meeting in Ohio, \"can be limited to its present bounds; it can\r\nbe ameliorated. It can be--and it _must_ be--ABOLISHED, and you and I\r\ncan and _must_ do it.\" Does this look like peace, if the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw were only out of the way? Mr. Seward, from his place in the Senate\r\nof the United States, tells us how we must act among the people of the\r\nNorth, if, in reclaiming our fugitive slaves, we would not disturb their\r\npeace. But he had already exhorted the people of the North to \"extend a\r\ncordial welcome\" to our fugitive slaves, and to \"defend them as they\r\nwould their household gods.\" What, then, does he mean by peace?\r\n\r\nThis outcry, indeed, that the peace of the country is disturbed by the\r\nFugitive Slave Law, is as great a delusion as ever was attempted to be\r\npalmed off on any people. If this law were repealed to-morrow, would\r\nagitation cease? Would the abolitionists of the North cease to proclaim\r\nthat their doors are open, and their hospitality is ready, to receive\r\nthe poor benighted blacks? (the blacks of the South, we mean; for we\r\nhave never heard of their open doors, or cordial hospitality, for the\r\npoor free blacks of their own neighborhood.) But we have heard--from Dr.\r\nChanning himself--of \"a convention at the North, of highly respected\r\nmen, preparing and publishing an address to the slaves, in which they\r\nare exhorted to fly from bondage, and to _feel no scruple in seizing and\r\nusing horse or boat which may facilitate their escape_.\" Now, if the\r\nFugitive Slave Law were repealed, would all such proceedings cease? Or\r\nif, under the Constitution as expounded by the Supreme Courts of the\r\nUnion and of New York, and without any such law to back him, the master\r\nshould seek to reclaim his property, would he be welcomed, or hooted and\r\nresisted, by the defenders of the fugitive from service? Let these\r\nthings be considered, and it will be evident, we think, that the repeal\r\nof the law in question would only invite further aggressions, and from\r\nthis prostrate outpost the real enemies of the peace of the country\r\nwould march, if possible, over every other defense of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHence, although we most ardently desire harmony and concord for the\r\nStates of the Union, we shall never seek it by a surrender of the\r\nConstitution or the decisions of the Supreme Court. If it cannot be\r\nfound under these, it cannot be found at all. Mr. Chase assures us,\r\nindeed, that just so long as the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in\r\nthe case of Prigg prevails, we must \"encounter difficulties, and serious\r\ndifficulties.\"[228] If it must be so, then so be it. If the question be\r\nwhether the decisions of the Supreme Court, or the dictation of\r\ndemagogues, shall rule our destinies, then is our stand taken and our\r\npurpose immovably fixed.\r\n\r\nWe have a right to peace under the decisions of that august tribunal. It\r\nis neither right nor proper--it is contrary to every principle of\r\nnatural justice--that either party to this great controversy should\r\ndecide for itself. Hence, if the abolitionists will not submit to the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, we shall most assuredly refuse\r\nsubmission to their arrogant dictation. We can, from our inmost hearts,\r\nrespect the feelings of those of our Northern brethren who may choose to\r\nremain passive in this matter, and leave us--by such aid as the law may\r\nafford--to reclaim our own fugitives from labor. For such we have only\r\nwords of kindness and feelings of fraternal love. But as for those--and\r\nespecially for those in high places--who counsel resistance to the laws\r\nand to the Constitution of the Republic, we hold them guilty of a high\r\nmisdemeanor, and we shall ever treat them as disturbers of the public\r\npeace, nay, as enemies of the independence, the perpetuity, the\r\ngreatness, and the glory of the Union under which, by the blessing of\r\nAlmighty God, we have hitherto so wonderfully prospered.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[209] On this point, see page 176.\r\n\r\n[210] XIV. Wendell, Jack v. Martin, p. 528\r\n\r\n[211] XIV. Wendell's Reports, Jack _v._ Martin.\r\n\r\n[212] In asserting that freedom is national, Mr. Sumner may perhaps mean\r\nthat it is the duty of the National Government to exclude slavery from\r\nall its territories, and to admit no new State in which there are\r\nslaves. If this be his meaning, we should reply, that it is as foreign\r\nfrom the merits of the Fugitive Slave Law, which he proposed to discuss,\r\nas it is from the truth. The National Government has, indeed, no more\r\npower to exclude, than it has to ordain, slavery; for slavery or no\r\nslavery is a question which belongs wholly and exclusively to the\r\nsovereign people of each and every State or territory. With our whole\r\nhearts we respond to the inspiring words of the President's Message: \"If\r\nthe friends of the Constitution are to have another struggle, its\r\nenemies could not present a more acceptable issue than that of a State,\r\nwhose Constitution clearly embraces a republican form of government,\r\nbeing excluded from the Union because its domestic institutions may not,\r\nin all respects, comport with the ideas of what is wise and expedient\r\nentertained in some other State.\"\r\n\r\n[213] Chap. ii § x.\r\n\r\n[214] Madison Papers, p. 1448.\r\n\r\n[215] One member seems to have been absent from the House.\r\n\r\n[216] Annals of Congress; 2d Congress, 1791-1793, p. 861.\r\n\r\n[217] This error was by no means a capital one.\r\n\r\n[218] Speech in the Senate, in 1855.\r\n\r\n[219] Speech in Boston, October 3d, 1850.\r\n\r\n[220] Mr. Sumner has a great deal to say, in his speech, about \"the\r\nmemory of the fathers.\" When their sentiments agree with his own, or\r\nonly seem to him to do so, then they are \"the demi-gods of history.\" But\r\nonly let these demi-gods cross his path or come into contact with his\r\nfanatical notions, and instantly they sink into sordid knaves. The\r\nframers of the Constitution of the United States, says he, made \"a\r\ncompromise, which _cannot be mentioned without shame_. It was that\r\n_hateful bargain_ by which Congress was restrained until 1808 from the\r\nprohibition of the foreign slave trade, thus securing, down to that\r\nperiod, _toleration for crime_.\" . . . . \"The effrontery of slaveholders\r\nwas matched by _the sordidness of the Eastern members_.\" . . . . \"The\r\nbargain was struck, and at this price the Southern States gained the\r\ndetestable indulgence. At a subsequent day, Congress branded the slave\r\ntrade as piracy, and thus, by solemn legislative act, adjudged this\r\ncompromise to be _felonious and wicked_.\"\r\n\r\nBut for this compromise, as every one who has read the history of the\r\ntimes perfectly well knows, no union could have been formed, and the\r\nslave trade might have been carried on to the present day. By this\r\ncompromise, then, the Convention did not tolerate crime nor the slave\r\ntrade; they merely formed the Union, and, in forming it, _gained the\r\npower to abolish the slave trade in twenty years_. The gain of this\r\npower, which Congress had not before possessed, was considered by them\r\nas a great gain to the cause of humanity. If the Eastern members, from a\r\nblind and frantic hatred of slavery, had blasted all prospects of a\r\nunion, and at the same time put the slave trade beyond their power\r\nforever, they would have imitated the wisdom of the abolitionists, who\r\nalways promote the cause they seek to demolish.\r\n\r\nIf any one will read the history of the times, he will see that \"the\r\nfathers,\" the framers of the Constitution, were, in making this very\r\ncompromise, governed by the purest, the most patriotic, and the most\r\nhumane, of motives. He who accuses them of corruption shows himself\r\ncorrupt; especially if, like Mr. Sumner, he can laud them on one page as\r\ndemi-gods, and on the very next denounce them as sordid knaves, who, for\r\nthe sake of filthy lucre, could enter into a \"felonious and wicked\"\r\nbargain. Yet the very man who accuses them of having made so infamous\r\nand corrupt a bargain in regard to the slave trade can and does most\r\neloquently declaim against the monstrous injustice of supposing them\r\ncapable of the least act in favor of slavery!\r\n\r\n[221] XII. Wendell, p. 314.\r\n\r\n[222] XIV. Wendell, p. 530; XVI. Peters, p. 608.\r\n\r\n[223] Indeed, if we had produced all the arguments in favor of the\r\nconstitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Law, it would have carried us\r\nfar beyond our limits, and swelled this single chapter into a volume.\r\n\r\n[224] This decision of the Supreme Court, which authorizes the master to\r\nseize his fugitive slave _without process_, (see his speech, Appendix to\r\nCongressional Globe, vol. xxii., part 2, p. 1587,) is exceedingly\r\noffensive to Mr. Chase of Ohio; and no wonder, since the Legislature of\r\nhis own State has passed a law, making it a penitentiary offense in the\r\nmaster who should thus prosecute his constitutional right as declared by\r\nthis decision. But, in regard to this point, the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States does not stand alone. The Supreme Court of New York, in\r\nthe case of Jack _v._ Martin, had previously said: \"Whether the owner or\r\nagent might have made the arrest in the first instance without any\r\nprocess, we will not stop to examine; authorities of deserved\r\nrespectability and weight have held the affirmative. 2 Pick. 11, 5 Serg.\r\n& Rawle, 62, and the case of Glen _v._ Hodges, in this court, before\r\nreferred to, (in 9 Johnson,) seem to countenance the same conclusion. It\r\nwould indeed appear to follow as a necessary consequence, from _the\r\nundoubted position, that under this clause of the Constitution the right\r\nand title of the owner to the service of the slave is as entire and\r\nperfect within the jurisdiction of the State to which he has fled as it\r\nwas in the one from which he escaped. Such seizure would be at the peril\r\nof the party_; AND IF A FREEMAN WAS TAKEN, HE WOULD BE ANSWERABLE LIKE\r\nANY OTHER TRESPASSER OR KIDNAPPER.\"\r\n\r\n[225] Story on Constitution, vol. iii. book iii., chap. xl.\r\n\r\n[226] The framers of the Constitution in that Congress were:--\"John\r\nLangdon and Nicholas Gilmer, of New Hampshire; Caleb Strong and Elbridge\r\nGerry, of Massachusetts; Roger Sherman and Oliver Elsworth, of\r\nConnecticut; Rufus King, of New York; Robert Morris and Thomas\r\nFitzsimmons, of Pennsylvania; George Reid and Richard Basset, of\r\nDelaware; Jonathan Dayton, of New Jersey; Pierce Butler, of South\r\nCarolina; Hugh Williamson, of North Carolina; William Few and Abraham\r\nBaldwin, of Georgia; and last, but not least, James Madison, of\r\nVirginia.\" Yet from not one of these framers of the Constitution--from\r\nnot one of these illustrious guardians of freedom--was a syllable heard\r\nin regard to the right of trial by jury in connection with the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law then passed. The more pity it is, no doubt, the abolitionist\r\nwill think, that neither Mr. Chase, nor Mr. Sumner, nor Mr. Seward, was\r\nthere to enlighten them on the subject of trial by jury and to save the\r\ncountry from the infamy of such an Act. Alas! for the poor, blind\r\nfathers!\r\n\r\n[227] This crime of kidnapping, says Mr. Chase, of Ohio, is \"not\r\nunfrequent\" in his section of country; that is, about Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n[228] Appendix to Congressional Globe, vol. xxii., part ii., p. 1587.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nBIBLE ARGUMENT:\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\nSLAVERY IN THE LIGHT OF DIVINE REVELATION.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nTHORNTON STRINGFELLOW, D. D.,\r\n\r\nOF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIBLE ARGUMENT:\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\nSLAVERY IN THE LIGHT OF DIVINE REVELATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES exist among the inhabitants of these United States, which\r\nmake it proper that the Scriptures should be carefully examined by\r\nChristians in reference to the institution of slavery, which exists in\r\nseveral of the States, with the approbation of those who profess\r\nunlimited subjection to God's revealed will.\r\n\r\nIt is branded by one portion of people, who take their rule of moral\r\nrectitude from the Scriptures, as a great sin; nay, the greatest of sins\r\nthat exist in the nation. And they hold the obligation to exterminate\r\nit, to be paramount to all others.\r\n\r\nIf slavery be thus sinful, it behooves all Christians who are involved\r\nin the sin, to repent in dust and ashes, and wash their hands of it,\r\nwithout consulting with flesh and blood. Sin in the sight of God is\r\nsomething which God in his word makes known to be wrong, either by\r\npreceptive prohibition, by principles of moral fitness, or examples of\r\ninspired men, contained in the sacred volume. When these furnish no law\r\nto condemn human conduct, there is no transgression. Christians should\r\nproduce a \"thus saith the Lord,\" both for what they condemn as sinful,\r\nand for what they approve as lawful, in the sight of heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped, that on a question of such vital importance as this\r\nto the peace and safety of our common country, as well as to the welfare\r\nof the church, we shall be seen cleaving to the Bible, and taking all\r\nour decisions about this matter, from its inspired pages. With men from\r\nthe North, I have observed for many years a palpable ignorance of the\r\nDivine will, in reference to the institution of slavery. I have seen but\r\na few who made the Bible their study, that had obtained a knowledge of\r\nwhat it did revea on this subject. Of late their denunciation of\r\nslavery as a sin, is loud and long.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, to examine the sacred volume briefly, and if I am\r\nnot greatly mistaken, I shall be able to make it appear that the\r\ninstitution of slavery has received, in the first place,\r\n\r\n1st. The sanction of the Almighty in the Patriarchal age.\r\n\r\n2d. That it was incorporated into the only National Constitution which\r\never emanated from God.\r\n\r\n3d. That its legality was recognized, and its relative duties regulated,\r\nby Jesus Christ in his kingdom; and\r\n\r\n4th. That it is full of mercy.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed further, it is necessary that the terms used to\r\ndesignate the thing, be defined. It is not a name, but a thing, that is\r\ndenounced as sinful; because it is supposed to be contrary to, and\r\nprohibited by the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nOur translators have used the term servant, to designate a state in\r\nwhich persons were serving, leaving us to gather the _relation_ between\r\nthe party served, and the party rendering the service, from other terms.\r\nThe term slave, signifies with us, a definite state, condition, or\r\nrelation, which state, condition, or relation, is precisely that one\r\nwhich is denounced as sinful. This state, condition, or relation, is\r\nthat in which one human being is held without his consent, by another,\r\nas property;[229] to be bought, sold, and transferred, together with\r\nincrease, as property forever. Now, this precise thing, is denounced by\r\na portion of the people of these United States, as the greatest\r\nindividual and national sin that is among us, and is thought to be so\r\nhateful in the sight of God, as to subject the nation to ruinous\r\njudgments, if it be not removed. Now, I propose to show from the\r\nScriptures, that this state, condition, or relation, did exist in the\r\n_patriarchal age_, and that the persons most extensively involved in the\r\nsin, if it be a sin, are the very persons who have been singled out by\r\nthe Almighty, as the objects of his special regard--whose character and\r\nconduct he has caused to be held up as _models_ for future generations.\r\nBefore we conclude slavery to be a thing hateful to God, and a great sin\r\nin his sight, it is proper that we should search the records he has\r\ngiven us, with care, to see in what light he has looked upon it, and\r\nfind the warrant for concluding, that we shall honor him by efforts to\r\nabolish it; which efforts, in their consequences, may involve the\r\nindiscriminate slaughter of the innocent and the guilty, the master and\r\nthe servant. We all believe him to be a Being who is the same yesterday,\r\nto-day, and forever.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded language which was ever uttered in relation to\r\nslavery, is the inspired language of Noah. In God's stead he says,\r\n\"Cursed be Canaan;\" \"a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.\"\r\n\"Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\" \"God\r\nshall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and\r\nCanaan shall be his servant.\"--Gen. ix: 25, 26, 27. Here, language is\r\nused, showing the _favor_ which God would exercise to the posterity of\r\nShem and Japheth, while they were holding the posterity of Ham in a\r\nstate of _abject bondage_. May it not be said in truth, that God decreed\r\nthis institution before it existed; and has he not connected its\r\n_existence_ with prophetic tokens of special favor, to those who should\r\nbe slave owners or masters? He is the same God now, that he was when he\r\ngave these views of his moral character to the world; and unless the\r\nposterity of Shem and Japheth, from whom have sprung the Jews, and all\r\nthe nations of Europe and America, and a great part of Asia, (the\r\nAfrican race that is in them excepted,)--I say, unless they are all\r\ndead, as well as the Canaanites or Africans, who descended from Ham,\r\nthen it is quite possible that his favor may now be found with one class\r\nof men who are holding another class in bondage. Be this as it may, God\r\n_decreed slavery_--and shows in that decree, tokens of good-will to the\r\nmaster. The sacred records occupy but a short space from this inspired\r\nray on this subject, until they bring to our notice, a man that is held\r\nup as a model, in all that adorns human nature, and as one that God\r\ndelighted to honor. This man is Abraham, honored in the sacred records,\r\nwith the appellation, \"Father\" of the \"faithful.\" Abraham was a native\r\nof Ur, of the Chaldees. From thence the Lord called him to go to a\r\ncountry which he would show him; and he obeyed, not knowing whither he\r\nwent. He stopped for a time at Haran, where his father died. From thence\r\nhe \"took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their\r\nsubstance that they had gathered, and the souls they had gotten in\r\nHaran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan.\"--Gen. xii: 5.\r\n\r\nAll the ancient Jewish writers of note, and Christian commentators\r\nagree, that by the \"souls they had gotten in Haran,\" as our translators\r\nrender it, are meant their slaves, or those persons they had bought with\r\ntheir money in Haran. In a few years after their arrival in Canaan, Lot\r\nwith all he had was taken captive. So soon as Abraham heard it, he armed\r\nthree hundred and eighteen slaves that were born in his house, and\r\nretook him. How great must have been the entire slave family, to produce\r\nat this period of Abraham's life, such a number of young slaves able to\r\nbear arms.--Gen. xiv: 14.\r\n\r\nAbraham is constantly held up in the sacred story, as the subject of\r\ngreat distinction among the princes and sovereigns of the countries in\r\nwhich he sojourned. This distinction was on account of his great wealth.\r\nWhen he proposed to buy a burying-ground at Sarah's death, of the\r\nchildren of Heth, he stood up and spoke with great humility of himself\r\nas \"a stranger and sojourner among them,\" (Gen. xxiii: 4,) desirous to\r\nobtain a burying-ground. But in what light do they look upon him? \"Hear\r\nus, my Lord, thou art a mighty prince among us.\"--Gen. xxiii: 6. Such is\r\nthe light in which they viewed him. What gave a man such distinction\r\namong such a people? Not moral qualities, but great wealth, and its\r\ninseparable concomitant, power. When the famine drove Abraham to Egypt,\r\nhe received the highest honors of the reigning sovereign. This honor at\r\nPharaoh's court, was called forth by the visible tokens of immense\r\nwealth. In Genesis xii: 15, 16, we have the honor that was shown to him,\r\nmentioned, _with a list of his property_, which is given in these words,\r\nin the 16th verse: \"He had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and\r\nmen-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.\" The\r\n_amount_ of his flocks may be inferred from the _number of slaves_\r\nemployed in tending them. They were those he brought from Ur of the\r\nChaldees, of whom the three hundred and eighteen were born; those gotten\r\nin Haran, where he dwelt for a short time, and those which he inherited\r\nfrom his father, who died in Haran. When Abraham _went up_ from Egypt,\r\nit is stated in Genesis xiii: 2, that he was \"_very rich_,\" not only in\r\n_flocks_ and _slaves_, but in \"_silver_ and _gold_\" also.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of Sodom, we see him sojourning in the kingdom of\r\nGerar. Here he received from the sovereign of the country, the honors of\r\nequality; and Abimelech, the king, (as Pharoah had done before him,)\r\nseeks Sarah for a wife, under the idea that she was Abraham's sister.\r\nWhen his mistake was discovered, he made Abraham a large present. Reason\r\nwill tell us, that in selecting the items of this present, Abimelech was\r\ngoverned by the visible indications of Abraham's preference in the\r\narticles of wealth--and that above all, he would present him with\r\nnothing which Abraham's sense of moral obligation would not allow him to\r\nown. Abimelech's present is thus described in Genesis xx: 14, 16, \"And\r\nAbimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants,\r\nand a thousand pieces of silver, and gave them unto Abraham.\" This\r\npresent discloses to us what constituted the most highly prized items of\r\nwealth, among these eastern sovereigns in Abraham's day.\r\n\r\nGod had promised Abraham's seed the land of Canaan, and that in his seed\r\nall the nations of the earth should be blessed. He reached the age of\r\neighty-five, and his wife the age of seventy-five, while as yet, they\r\nhad no child. At this period, Sarah's anxiety for the promised seed, in\r\nconnection with her age, induced her to propose a female slave of the\r\nEgyptian stock, as a secondary wife, from which to obtain the promised\r\nseed. This alliance soon puffed the slave with pride, and she became\r\ninsolent to her mistress--the mistress complained to Abraham, the\r\nmaster. Abraham ordered Sarah to exercise her authority. Sarah did so,\r\nand pushed it to severity, and the slave absconded. The divine oracles\r\ninform us, that the angel of God found this run-away bond-woman in the\r\nwilderness; and if God had commissioned this angel to improve this\r\nopportunity of teaching the world how much he abhorred slavery, he took\r\na bad plan to acomplish it. For, instead of repeating a homily upon\r\ndoing to others as we \"would they should do unto us,\" and heaping\r\nreproach upon Sarah, as a hypocrite, and Abraham as a tyrant, and\r\ngiving Hagar direction how she might get into Egypt, from whence\r\n(according to abolitionism) she had been unrighteously sold into\r\nbondage, the angel addressed her as \"Hagar, Sarah's maid,\" Gen. xvi: 1,\r\n9; (thereby recognizing the relation of master and slave,) and asks her,\r\n\"whither wilt thou go?\" and she said \"I flee from the face of my\r\nmistress.\" Quite a wonder she honored Sarah so much as to call her\r\nmistress; but she knew nothing of abolition, and God by his angel did\r\nnot become her teacher.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at what may be called an _abuse_ of the institution,\r\nin which one person is the property of another, and under their control,\r\nand subject to their authority without their consent; and if the Bible\r\nbe the book, which proposes to furnish the case which leaves it without\r\ndoubt that God abhors the institution, here we are to look for it. What,\r\ntherefore, is the doctrine in relation to slavery, in a case in which a\r\nrigid exercise of its arbitrary authority is called forth upon a\r\nhelpless female; who might use a strong plea for protection, upon the\r\nground of being the master's wife. In the face of this case, which is\r\nhedged around with aggravations as if God designed by it to awaken all\r\nthe sympathy and all the abhorrence of that portion of mankind, who\r\nclaim to have more mercy than God himself--but I say, in view of this\r\nstrong case, what is the doctrine taught? Is it that God abhors the\r\ninstitution of slavery; that it is a reproach to good men; that the\r\nevils of the institution can no longer be winked at among saints; that\r\nAbraham's character must not be transmitted to posterity, with this\r\nstain upon it; that Sarah must no longer be allowed to live a stranger\r\nto the abhorrence God has for such conduct as she has been guilty of to\r\nthis poor helpless female? I say, what is the doctrine taught? Is it so\r\nplain that it can be easily understood? and does God teach that she is a\r\nbond-woman or slave, and that she is to recognize Sarah as her mistress,\r\nand not her equal--that she must return and submit herself unreservedly\r\nto Sarah's authority? Judge for yourself, reader, by the angel's answer:\r\n\"And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return unto thy mistress, and\r\nsubmit thyself under her hands.\"--Gen. xvi: 9.\r\n\r\nBut, says the spirit of abolition, with which the Bible has to contend,\r\nyou are building your house upon the sand, for these were nothing but\r\nhired servants; and their servitude designates no such state,\r\ncondition, or relation, as that, in which one person is made the\r\nproperty of another, to be bought, sold, or transferred forever. To\r\nthis, we have two answers in reference to the subject, _before giving\r\nthe law_. In the first place, the term servant, in the schedules of\r\nproperty among the patriarchs, _does designate_ the state, condition, or\r\nrelation in which one person is the legal property of another, as in\r\nGen. xxiv: 35, 36. Here Abraham's servant, who had been sent by his\r\nmaster to get a wife for his son Isaac, in order to prevail with the\r\nwoman and her family, states, that the man for whom he sought a bride,\r\nwas the son of a man whom God had greatly blessed with riches; which he\r\ngoes on to enumerate thus, in the 35th verse: \"He hath given him flocks,\r\nand herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants,\r\nand camels, and asses;\" then in verse 36th, he states the disposition\r\nhis master had made of his estate: \"My master's wife bare a son to my\r\nmaster when she was old, and unto him he hath given all that he hath.\"\r\nHere, servants are enumerated with silver and gold as part of the\r\npatrimony. And, reader, bear it in mind; as if to rebuke the doctrine of\r\nabolition, servants are not only inventoried as property, but as\r\nproperty which _God had given to Abraham_. After the death of Abraham,\r\nwe have a view of Isaac at Gerar, when he had come into the possession\r\nof this estate; and this is the description given of him: \"And the man\r\nwaxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great; for\r\nhe had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and _great store\r\nof servants_.\"--Gen. xxvi: 13, 14. This state in which servants are made\r\nchattels, he received as an inheritance from his father, and passed to\r\nhis son Jacob.\r\n\r\nAgain, in Genesis xvii, we are informed of a covenant God entered into\r\nwith Abraham; in which he stipulates to be a God to him and his _seed_,\r\n(not his servants,) and to give to his _seed_ the land of Canaan for an\r\neverlasting possession. He expressly stipulates, that Abraham shall put\r\nthe token of this covenant upon every servant born in his house, and\r\nupon every servant _bought with his money of any stranger_.--Gen. xvii:\r\n12, 13. Here again servants are property. Again, more than four hundred\r\nyears afterward, we find the _seed_ of Abraham, on leaving Egypt,\r\ndirected to celebrate the rite, that was ordained as a memorial of their\r\ndeliverance, viz: the Passover, at which time the same institution which\r\nmakes _property_ of _men_ and _women_, is recognized, and the _servant\r\nbought with money_, is given the privilege of partaking, upon the ground\r\nof his being circumcised _by his master_, while the hired servant, over\r\nwhom the master had no such control, is excluded until he _voluntarily_\r\nsubmits to circumcision; showing clearly that the institution of\r\ninvoluntary slavery then carried with it a right, on the part of the\r\nmaster, _to choose_ a religion _for the servant_ who was his money, as\r\nAbraham did, by God's direction, when he imposed circumcision on those\r\nhe had bought with his money,--when he was circumcised himself, with\r\nIshmael his son, who was the only individual beside himself, on whom he\r\nhad a right to impose it, except the bond-servants bought of the\r\nstranger with his money, and their children born in his house. The next\r\nnotice we have of servants as property, is from God himself, when\r\nclothed with all the visible tokens of his presence and glory, on the\r\ntop of Sinai, when he proclaimed his law to the millions that surrounded\r\nits base: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not\r\ncovet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant,\r\nnor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.\"--Ex. xx:\r\n17. Here is a patriarchal catalogue of property, having God for its\r\nauthor, the wife among the rest, who was then purchased, as Jacob\r\npurchased his two, by fourteen years' service. Here the term servant, as\r\nused by the Almighty, under the circumstances of the case could not be\r\nunderstood by these millions, as meaning any thing but property, because\r\nthe night they left Egypt, a few weeks before, Moses, by Divine\r\nauthority, recognized their servants as property, which they had bought\r\nwith their money.\r\n\r\n2d. In addition to the evidence from the context of these, and various\r\nother places, to prove the term servant to be identical in the import of\r\nits essential particulars with the term slave among us, there is\r\nunquestionable evidence, that _in the patriarchal age_, there are two\r\ndistinct states of servitude alluded to, and which are indicated by two\r\ndistinct terms, or by the same term, and an adjective to explain.\r\n\r\nThese two terms are first, servant or bond-servant; second, hireling or\r\nhired servant; the first indicating involuntary servitude; the second,\r\nvoluntary servitude for stipulated wages, and a specified time. Although\r\nthis admits of the clearest proof _under the law_, yet it admits of\r\nproof before the law was given. On the night the Israelites left Egypt,\r\nwhich was before the law was given, Moses, in designating the\r\nqualifications necessary for the Passover, uses this language,--Exod.\r\nxii: 44, 45: \"Every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou\r\nhast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. A foreigner and an\r\nhired servant shall not eat thereof.\" This language carries to the human\r\nmind, with irresistible force, the idea of _two distinct states_--one a\r\nstate of _freedom_, the other a state of _bondage_: in one of which, a\r\nperson is serving with his consent for wages; in the other of which a\r\nperson is serving without his _consent_, according to his master's\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nAgain, in Job iii, Job expresses the strong desire he had been made by\r\nhis afflictions to feel, that he had died in his infancy. \"For now,\"\r\nsays he, \"should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept:\r\nthen had I been at rest. There (meaning the grave) the wicked cease from\r\ntroubling, and there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest\r\ntogether; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. The small and the\r\ngreat are there, and the servant is free from his master.\"--Job iii: 11,\r\n13, 17, 18, 19. Now, I ask any common-sense man to account for the\r\nexpression in this connection, \"there the servant is free from his\r\nmaster.\" Afflictions are referred to, arising out of _states_ or\r\n_conditions_, from which _ordinarily_ nothing but _death_ brings relief.\r\n_Death_ puts an end to afflictions of body that are incurable, as he\r\ntook his own to be, and therefore he desired it.\r\n\r\nThe troubles brought on good men by a wicked persecuting world, last for\r\nlife; but in _death_ the wicked cease from troubling,--_death_ ends that\r\n_relation_ or _state_ out of which such troubles grow. The prisoners of\r\nthe oppressors, in that age, stood in a _relation_ to their _oppressor_,\r\nwhich led the oppressed to expect they would hear the voice of the\r\n_oppressor_ until _death_. But _death_ broke the _relation_, and was\r\ndesired, because in the grave they would hear his voice no more.\r\n\r\nAll the distresses growing out of inequalities in human condition; as\r\nwealth and power on one side, and poverty and weakness on the other,\r\nwere terminated by death; the grave brought both to a level: the small\r\nand the great are there, and there, (that is, in the grave,) he adds,\r\nthe servant is free from his master; made so, evidently, by _death_. The\r\n_relation_, or _state_ out of which his oppression had arisen, being\r\ndestroyed by _death_, he would be freed from them, because he would, by\r\n_death_, be freed from his master who inflicted them. This view of the\r\ncase, and this only, will account for the use of such language. But upon\r\na supposition that a _state_ or _relation_ among men is referred to,\r\nthat is _voluntary_, such as that between a _hired servant_ and his\r\n_employer_, that can be _dissolved_ at the pleasure of the _servant_,\r\nthe language is without meaning, and perfectly unwarranted; while such a\r\n_relation_ as that of _involuntary_ and _hereditary_ servitude, where\r\nthe master had _unlimited power_ over his servant, and in an age when\r\ncruelty was common, there is the greatest propriety in making the\r\nservant or slave, a _companion with himself, in affliction_, as well as\r\nthe oppressed and afflicted, in every class where _death alone_\r\ndissolved the _state_ or _condition_, out of which their afflictions\r\ngrew. Beyond all doubt, this language refers to a state of _hereditary\r\nbondage_, from the afflictions of which, _ordinarily_, nothing in that\r\nday brought relief but _death_.\r\n\r\nAgain, in chapter 7th, he goes on to defend himself in his eager desire\r\nfor death, in an address to God. He says, it is natural for a servant to\r\ndesire the shadow, and a hireling his wages: \"As the servant earnestly\r\ndesireth the shadow, and as the hireling looketh for the reward of his\r\nwork,\" so it is with me, should be supplied.--Job vii: 2. Now, with the\r\nprevious light shed upon the use and meaning of these terms in the\r\n_patriarchal Scriptures_, can any man of candor bring himself to believe\r\nthat two states or conditions are not here referred to, in one of which,\r\nthe highest reward after toil is mere rest; in the other of which, the\r\nreward was wages? And how appropriate is the language in reference to\r\nthese two states.\r\n\r\nThe _slave_ is represented as earnestly desiring the _shadow_, because\r\nhis condition allowed him no prospect of any thing more desirable; but\r\nthe _hireling_ as looking for the _reward of his work_, because _that_\r\nwill be an equivalent for his fatigue.\r\n\r\nSo Job looked at _death_, as being to his _body_ as the servant's\r\n_shade_, therefore he desired it; and like the _hireling's wages_,\r\nbecause _beyond the grave_, he hoped to reap the fruit of his doings.\r\nAgain, Job (xxxi:) finding himself the subject of suspicion (see from\r\nverse 1 to 30) as to the rectitude of his past life, clears himself of\r\nvarious sins, in the most solemn manner, as unchastity, injustice in his\r\ndealings, adultery, contempt of his servants, unkindness to the poor,\r\ncovetousness, the pride of wealth, etc. And in the 13th, 14th, and 15th\r\nverses he thus expresses himself: \"If I did despise the cause of my\r\nman-servant, or my maid-servant, when they contended with me, what then\r\nshall I do when God rises up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer\r\nhim? Did not he that made me in the womb, make him? And did not one\r\nfashion us in the womb?\" Taking this language in connection with the\r\nlanguage employed by Moses, in reference to the institution of\r\ninvoluntary servitude in _that age_, and especially in connection with\r\nthe language which Moses employs _after the law was given_, and what\r\nelse can be understood, than a reference to a class of duties that slave\r\nowners felt themselves above stooping to notice or perform, but which,\r\nnevertheless, it was the duty of the righteous man to discharge: for\r\nwhatever proud and wicked men might think of a poor servant that stood\r\nin his estate, on an equality with brutes, yet, says Job, he that made\r\nme, made them, and if I despise their reasonable causes of complaint,\r\nfor injuries which they are made to suffer, and for the redress of which\r\nI only can be appealed to, then what shall I do, and how shall I fare,\r\nwhen I carry my causes of complaint to him who is my master, and to whom\r\nonly I can go for relief? When he visiteth me for despising _their\r\ncause_, what shall I answer him for _despising mine_? He means that he\r\nwould feel self-condemned, and would be forced to admit the justice of\r\nthe retaliation. But on the supposition that allusion is had to _hired\r\nservants_, who were _voluntarily_ working for _wages_ agreed upon, and\r\nwho were the _subjects of rights_ for the _protection of which_, their\r\nappeal would be to \"the judges in the gate,\" as much as any other class\r\nof men, then there is no point in the statement. For _doing that_ which\r\ncan be _demanded as a legal right_, gives us no claim to the character\r\nof _merciful benefactors_. Job himself was a great slaveholder, and,\r\nlike Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, won no small portion of his claims to\r\ncharacter with God and men from the manner in which he discharged his\r\nduty to his slaves. Once more: the conduct of Joseph in Egypt, _as\r\nPharaoh's counsellor_, under all the circumstances, proves him a friend\r\nto absolute slavery, as a form of government better adapted to the state\r\nof the world at that time, than the one which existed in Egypt; for\r\ncertain it is, that he peaceably effected a change in the fundamental\r\nlaw, by which a _state, condition, or relation_, between Pharaoh and the\r\nEgyptians was established, which answers to the one now denounced as\r\nsinful in the sight of God. Being warned of God, he gathered up all the\r\nsurplus grain in the years of plenty, and sold it out in the years of\r\nfamine, until he gathered up all the money; and when money failed, the\r\nEgyptians came and said, \"Give us bread;\" and Joseph said, \"Give your\r\ncattle, and I will give for your cattle, if money fail.\" When that year\r\nwas ended, they came unto him the second year, and said, \"There is not\r\naught left in sight of my Lord, but our bodies and our lands. Buy us and\r\nour lands for bread.\" And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for\r\nPharoah.\r\n\r\nSo the land became Pharoah's, and as for the people, he removed them to\r\ncities, from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the other end\r\nthereof. Then Joseph said unto the people, \"Behold! I have bought you\r\nthis day, and your land for Pharoah; and they said, \"we will be\r\nPharoah's servants.\"--See Gen. xlvii: 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25. Having\r\nthus changed the fundamental law, and created a state of entire\r\n_dependence_ and _hereditary bondage_, he enacted in his sovereign\r\npleasure, that they should give Pharoah one part, and take the other\r\nfour parts of the productions of the earth to themselves. How far the\r\nhand of God was in this overthrow of liberty, I will not decide; but\r\nfrom the fact that he has singled out the greatest slaveholders of that\r\nage, as the objects of his special favor, it would seem that the\r\ninstitution was one furnishing great opportunities to exercise grace and\r\nglorify God, as it still does, where its duties are faithfully\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nI have been tedious on this first proposition, but I hope the importance\r\nof the subject to Christians as well as to statesmen will be my apology.\r\nI have written it, not for victory over an adversary, or to support\r\nerror or falsehood, but to gather up God's will in reference to holding\r\nmen and women in _bondage, in the patriarchal age_. And it is clear, in\r\nthe first place, that God decreed this state before it existed. Second.\r\nIt is clear that the highest manifestations of good-will which he ever\r\ngave to mortal man, was given to Abraham, in that covenant in which he\r\nrequired him to circumcise all his _male servants, which he had bought\r\nwith his money_, and that were _born of them_ in his house. Third. It is\r\ncertain that he gave _these servants_ as _property_ to Isaac. Fourth. It\r\nis certain that, as the owner of _these slaves_, Isaac received similar\r\ntokens of God's favor. Fifth. It is certain that Jacob, who inherited\r\nfrom Isaac his father, received like tokens of divine favor. Sixth. It\r\nis certain, from a fair construction of language, that Job, who is held\r\nup by God himself as a model of human perfection, was a great\r\nslaveholder. Seventh. It is certain, when God showed honor, and came\r\ndown to bless Jacob's posterity, in taking them by the hand to lead them\r\nout of Egypt, _they were the owners of slaves that were bought with\r\nmoney, and treated as property_; _which slaves_ were allowed of God to\r\nunite in celebrating the divine goodness to their _masters_, while\r\n_hired servants_ were excluded. Eighth. It is certain that God\r\ninterposed to give Joseph the power in Egypt, which he used, to create a\r\nstate, or condition, among the Egyptians, which _substantially agrees_\r\nwith _patriarchal_ and _modern slavery_. Ninth. It is certain, that in\r\nreference to this institution in Abraham's family, and the surrounding\r\nnations, for five hundred years, it is never censured in any\r\ncommunication made from God to men. Tenth. It is certain, when God put a\r\n_period_ to _that dispensation_, he _recognised slaves as property on\r\nMount Sinai_. If, therefore, it has become sinful since, it cannot be\r\nfrom the _nature of the thing_, but from the _sovereign pleasure of God\r\nin its prohibition_. We will therefore proceed to our second\r\nproposition, which is--\r\n\r\nSecond.--That it was incorporated in the only national constitution\r\nemanating from the Almighty. By common consent, that portion of time\r\nstretching from Noah, until the law was given to Abraham's posterity, at\r\nMount Sinai, is called the patriarchal age; _this is the period we have\r\nreviewed_, in relation to this subject. From the giving of the law until\r\nthe coming of Christ, is called the Mosaic or legal dispensation. From\r\nthe coming of Christ to the end of time, is called the Gospel\r\ndispensation. The legal dispensation _is the period of time, we propose\r\nnow to examine_, in reference to the institution of involuntary and\r\nhereditary slavery; in order to ascertain, whether, during this period,\r\n_it existed at all_, and _if it did exist_, whether with the _divine\r\nsanction_, or in _violation of the divine will_. This dispensation is\r\ncalled the legal dispensation, because it was the pleasure of God to\r\ntake Abraham's posterity by miraculous power, then numbering near three\r\nmillions of souls, and give them a written constitution of government, a\r\ncountry to dwell in, and a covenant of special protection and favor, for\r\ntheir obedience to his law until the coming of Christ. The laws which he\r\ngave them emanated from his sovereign pleasure, and were designed, in\r\nthe first place, to make himself known in his essential perfections;\r\nsecond, in his moral character; third, in his relation to man; and\r\nfourth, to make known those principles of action by the exercise of\r\nwhich man attains his highest moral elevation, viz: supreme love to God,\r\nand love to others as to ourselves.\r\n\r\nAll the law is nothing but a preceptive exemplification of these two\r\nprinciples; consequently, the existence of a precept in the law, utterly\r\nirreconcilable with these principles, would destroy all claims upon us\r\nfor an acknowledgment of its divine original. Jesus Christ himself has\r\nput his finger upon these two principles of human conduct, (Deut. vi:\r\n5--Levit. xix: 18,) revealed in the law of Moses, and decided, that on\r\nthem hang all the law and the prophets.\r\n\r\nThe Apostle Paul decides in reference to the relative duties of men,\r\nthat whether written out in preceptive form in the law or not, they are\r\nall comprehended in this saying, viz: \"thou shalt love thy neighbor as\r\nthyself.\" With these views to guide us, as to the acknowledged design of\r\nthe law, viz: that of revealing the eternal principles of moral\r\nrectitude, by which human conduct is to be measured, so that sin may\r\nabound, or be made apparent, and righteousness be ascertained or known,\r\nwe may safely conclude, that the institution of slavery, which legalizes\r\nthe holding one person in bondage as property forever by another, if it\r\nbe morally wrong, or at war with the principle which requires us to love\r\nGod supremely, and our neighbor as ourself, will, if noticed at all in\r\nthe law, be noticed, for the purpose of being condemned as sinful. And\r\nif the modern views of abilitionists be correct, we may expect to find\r\nthe institution marked with such tokens of divine displeasure, as will\r\nthrow all other sins into the shade, as comparatively small, when laid\r\nby the side of this monster. What, then, is true? Has God ingrafted\r\nhereditary slavery upon the constitution of government he condescended\r\nto give to his chosen people--that people, among whom he promised to\r\ndwell, and that he required to be holy? I answer, he has. It is clear\r\nand explicit. He enacts, first, that his chosen people may take their\r\nmoney, go into the slave markets of the surrounding nations, (the seven\r\ndevoted nations excepted,) and purchase men-servants and women-servants,\r\nand give them, and their increase, to their children and their\r\nchildren's children, forever; and worse still for the refined humanity\r\nof our age--he guarantees to the foreign slaveholder perfect protection,\r\nwhile he comes in among the Israelites, for the purpose of dwelling,\r\nand raising and selling slaves, who should be acclimated and accustomed\r\nto the habits and institutions of the country. And worse still for the\r\nsublimated humanity of the present age, God passes with the right to buy\r\nand possess, the right to govern, by a severity which knows no bounds\r\nbut the master's discretion. And if worse can be, for the morbid\r\nhumanity we censure, he enacts that his own people may sell themselves\r\nand their families for limited periods, with the privilege of extending\r\nthe time at the end of the sixth year to the fiftieth year or jubilee,\r\nif they prefer bondage to freedom. Such is the precise character of two\r\ninstitutions, found in the constitution of the Jewish commonwealth,\r\nemanating directly from Almighty God. For the fifteen hundred years,\r\nduring which these laws were in force, God raised up a succession of\r\nprophets to reprove that people for the various sins into which they\r\nfell; yet there is not a reproof uttered against the institution of\r\n_involuntary slavery_, for any species of abuse that ever grew out of\r\nit. A severe judgment is pronounced by Jeremiah, (chapter xxxiv: see\r\nfrom the 8th to the 22d verse,) for an abuse or violation of the law,\r\nconcerning the _voluntary_ servitude of Hebrews; but the prophet pens it\r\nwith caution, as if to show that it had no reference to any abuse that\r\nhad taken place under the system of _involuntary slavery_, which existed\r\nby law among that people; the sin consisted in making hereditary\r\nbond-men and bond-women of Hebrews, which was positively forbidden by\r\nthe law, and not for buying and holding one of another nation in\r\nhereditary bondage, which was as positively allowed by the law. And\r\nreally, in view of what is passing in our country, and elsewhere, among\r\nmen who profess to reverence the Bible, it would seem that these must be\r\ndreams of a distempered brain, and not the solemn truths of that sacred\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nWell, I will now proceed to make them good to the letter, see Levit.\r\nxxv: 44, 45, 46; \"Thy bond-men and thy bond-maids which thou shalt have,\r\nshall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy\r\nbond-men and bond-maids. Moreover, of the children of the strangers that\r\ndo sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that\r\nare with you, which they begat in your land. And they shall be your\r\npossession. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children\r\nafter you, to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bond-men\r\nforever.\" I ask any candid man, if the words of this institution could\r\nbe more explicit? It is from God himself; it authorizes that people, to\r\nwhom he had become _king and law-giver_, to purchase men and women as\r\nproperty; to hold them and their posterity in bondage; and to will them\r\nto their children as a possession forever; and more, it allows _foreign\r\nslaveholders_ to _settle_ and _live among them_; to _breed slaves_ and\r\n_sell them_. Now, it is important to a correct understanding of this\r\nsubject, to connect with the right to _buy_ and _possess_, as property,\r\nthe amount of authority _to govern_, which is granted by the\r\n_law-giver_; this amount of authority is implied, in the first place, in\r\nthe law which prohibits the exercise of rigid authority upon the\r\nHebrews, who are allowed to sell themselves for limited times. \"If thy\r\nbrother be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not _compel\r\nhim_ to serve as a _bond servant_, but as a _hired servant_, and as a\r\n_sojourner_ he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee until the year\r\nof jubilee--_they shall not be sold as bond-men_; thou _shalt not rule\r\nover them with rigor_.\"--Levit. xxv: 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. It will be\r\nevident to all, that here are _two states_ of servitude; in reference to\r\n_one_ of which, _rigid_ or _compulsory_ authority, is _prohibited_, and\r\nthat its _exercise is authorised in the other_.\r\n\r\nSecond.--In the criminal code, that conduct is punished with death, when\r\ndone to a _freeman_, which is not punishable at all, when done _by a\r\nmaster to a slave_, for the express reason, that the slave is the\r\n_master's money_. \"He that smiteth a man so that he die, shall surely be\r\nput to death.\"--Exod. xxi: 20, 21. \"If a man smite his servant or his\r\nmaid, with a rod, and he die under his hand, he shall be surely\r\npunished; notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be\r\npunished, for he is his money.\"--Exod. xxi: 20. Here is precisely the\r\nsame crime: smiting a man so that he die; if it be a freeman, he shall\r\nsurely be put to death, whether the man die under his hand, or live a\r\nday or two after; but if it be a servant, and the master continued the\r\nrod until the servant died under his hand, then it must be evident that\r\nsuch a chastisement could not be necessary for any purpose of wholesome\r\nor reasonable authority, and therefore he may by punished, but not with\r\ndeath. But if the death did not take place for a day or two, then it is\r\nto be _presumed_, that the master only aimed to use the rod, so far as\r\nwas necessary to produce subordination, and for this, the law which\r\nallowed him to lay out his money in the slave, would protect him\r\nagainst all punishment. This is the common-sense principle which has\r\nbeen adopted substantially in civilized countries, where involuntary\r\nslavery has been instituted, from that day until this. Now, here are\r\nlaws that authorize the holding of men and women in bondage, and\r\nchastising them with the rod, with a severity that terminates in death.\r\nAnd he who believes the Bible to be of divine authority, believes these\r\nlaws were given by the Holy Ghost to Moses. I understand modern\r\nabolition sentiments to be sentiments of marked hatred against such\r\nlaws; to be sentiments which would hold God himself in abhorrence, if he\r\nwere to give such laws his sanction; but he has given them his sanction;\r\ntherefore, they must be in harmony with his moral character. Again, the\r\ndivine Law-giver, in guarding the property right in slaves among his\r\nchosen people, sanctions principles which may work the separation of man\r\nand wife, father and children. Surely, my reader will conclude, if I\r\nmake this good, I shall force a part of the saints of the present day to\r\nblaspheme the God of Israel. All I can say is, truth is mighty, and I\r\nhope it will bring us all to say, let God be true, in settling the true\r\nprinciples of humanity, and every man a liar who says slavery was\r\ninconsistent with it, in the days of the Mosaic law. Now for the proof:\r\n\"If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve thee, and in the\r\nseventh he shall go out free for nothing; if he came in by himself, he\r\nshall go out by himself; if he were married, then his wife shall go out\r\nwith him; if his master have given him a wife (one of his bond-maids)\r\nand she have borne him sons and daughters, the wife and her children\r\nshall be her master's and he shall go out by himself.\"--Exod. xxi: 2, 3,\r\n4. Now, the God of Israel gives this man the option of being separated\r\nby the master, from his wife and children, or becoming himself a servant\r\nforever, with a mark of the fact, like our cattle, in the ear, that can\r\nbe seen wherever he goes; for it is enacted, \"If the servant shall\r\nplainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go\r\nout free, then his master shall bring him unto the judges, (in open\r\ncourt,) he shall also bring him unto the door, or unto the door post,\r\n(so that all in the court-house, and those in the yard may be witnesses,\r\nand his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall\r\nserve him forever.\" It is useless to spend more time in gathering up\r\nwhat is written in the Scriptures on this subject, from the giving of\r\nthe law until the coming of Christ.\r\n\r\nHere is the authority, from God himself, to hold men and women, and\r\ntheir increase, in slavery, and to transmit them as property forever;\r\nhere is plenary power to govern them, whatever measure of severity it\r\nmay require; provided only, that _to govern_, be the object in\r\nexercising it. Here is power given to the master, to separate man and\r\nwife, parent and child, by denying ingress to his premises, sooner than\r\ncompel him to free or sell the mother, that the marriage relation might\r\nbe honored. The _preference_ is given of God to _enslaving the father_\r\nrather than _freeing the mother and children_.\r\n\r\nUnder every view we are allowed to take of the subject, the conviction\r\nis forced upon the mind, that from Abraham's day, until the coming of\r\nChrist, (a period of two thousand years,) this institution found favor\r\nwith God. No marks of his displeasure are found resting upon it. It\r\nmust, therefore, in its moral nature, be in harmony with those moral\r\nprinciples which he requires to be exercised by the law of Moses, and\r\nwhich are the principles that secure harmony and happiness to the\r\nuniverse, viz: supreme love to God, and the love of our neighbor as\r\nourself.--Deut. vi: 5.--Levit. xix: 18. To suppose that God has laid\r\ndown these fundamental principles of moral rectitude in his law, as the\r\nsoul that must inhabit every preceptive requirement of that law, and yet\r\nto suppose he created relations among the Israelites, and prescribed\r\nrelative duties growing out of these relations, that are hostile to the\r\nspirit of the law, is to suppose what will never bring great honor or\r\nglory to our Maker. But if I understand that spirit which is now warring\r\nagainst slavery, this is the position which the spirit of God forces it\r\nto occupy, viz: that God has ordained slavery, and yet slavery is the\r\ngreatest of sins. Such was the state of the case when Jesus Christ made\r\nhis appearance. We propose--\r\n\r\nThird. To show that Jesus Christ recognized this institution as one that\r\nwas lawful among men, and regulated its relative duties.\r\n\r\nHaving shown from the Scriptures, that slavery existed with Abraham and\r\nthe patriarchs, with divine approbation, and having shown from the same\r\nsource, that the Almighty incorporated it in the law, as an institution\r\namong Abraham's seed, until the coming of Christ, our precise object now\r\nis, to ascertain whether _Jesus Christ has abolished it_, or _recognized\r\nit_ as a _lawful relation_, existing among men, and prescribed duties\r\nwhich belong to it, as he has other relative duties; such as those\r\nbetween husband and wife, parent and child, magistrate and subject.\r\n\r\nAnd first, I may take it for granted, without proof, that he has not\r\nabolished it by commandment, for none pretend to this. This, by the way,\r\nis a singular circumstance, that Jesus Christ should put a system of\r\nmeasures into operation, which have for their object the subjugation of\r\nall men to him as a law-giver--kings, legislators, and private citizens\r\nin all nations; at a time, too, when hereditary slavery existed in all;\r\nand after it had been incorporated for fifteen hundred years into the\r\nJewish constitution, immediately given by God himself. I say, it is\r\npassing strange, that under such circumstances, Jesus should fail to\r\nprohibit its further existence, if it was his intention to abolish it.\r\nSuch an omission or oversight cannot be charged upon any other\r\nlegislator the world has ever seen. But, says the abolitionist, he has\r\nintroduced new moral principles, which will extinguish it as an\r\nunavoidable consequence, without a direct prohibitory command. What are\r\nthey? \"Do to others as you would they should do to you.\" Taking these\r\nwords of Christ to be a body, inclosing a moral soul in them, what soul,\r\nI ask, is it?\r\n\r\nThe same embodied in these words of Moses, Levit. xix: 18; \"thou shalt\r\nlove thy neighbor as thyself;\" or is it another? It cannot be another,\r\nbut it must be the very same, because Jesus says, there are but two\r\nprinciples in being in God's moral government, _one_ including all that\r\nis _due to God_, the _other_ all that is _due to men_.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, doing to others as we would they should do to us, means\r\nprecisely what loving our neighbor as ourself means, then Jesus has\r\nadded no new moral principle above those in the law of Moses, to\r\nprohibit slavery, for in his law is found this principle, and slavery\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe very God that said to them, they should love him supremely, and\r\ntheir neighbors as themselves, said to them also, \"of the heathen that\r\nare round about you, thou shalt buy bond-men and bond-women, and they\r\nshall be your possession, and ye shall take them as an inheritance for\r\nyour children after you, to inherit them as a possession; they shall be\r\nyour bond-men forever.\" Now, to suppose that Jesus Christ left his\r\ndisciples to find out, without a revelation, that slavery must be\r\nabolished, as a natural consequence from the fact, that when God\r\nestablished the relation of master and servant under the law, he said to\r\nthe master and servant, each of you must love the other as yourself, is,\r\nto say the least, making Jesus to presume largely upon the intensity of\r\ntheir intellect, that they would be able to spy out a discrepancy in the\r\nlaw of Moses, which God himself never saw. Again: if \"do to others as ye\r\nwould they should do to you,\" is to abolish slavery, it will for the\r\nsame reason, level all inequalities in human condition. It is not to be\r\nadmitted, then, that Jesus Christ introduced any new moral principle\r\nthat must, of necessity, abolish slavery. The principle relied on to\r\nprove it, stands boldly out to view in the code of Moses, as the _soul_,\r\nthat must _regulate_, and _control_, the _relation_ of _master and\r\nservant_, and therefore cannot abolish it.\r\n\r\nWhy a master cannot do to a servant, or a servant to a master, as he\r\nwould have them do to him, as soon as a wife to a husband or a husband\r\nto a wife, I am utterly at a loss to know. The wife is \"subject to her\r\nhusband in all things\" by divine precept. He is her \"head,\" and God\r\n\"suffers her not to usurp authority over him.\" Now, why in such a\r\nrelation as this, we can do to others _as we_ would they should do to\r\nus, any sooner than in a relation, securing to us what is just and equal\r\nas servants, and due respect and faithful service rendered with good\r\nwill to us as masters, I am at a loss to conceive. I affirm then, first,\r\n(and no man denies,) that Jesus Christ has not abolished slavery by a\r\nprohibitory command: and second, I affirm, he has introduced no new\r\nmoral principle which can work its destruction, under the gospel\r\ndispensation; and that the principle relied on for this purpose, is a\r\nfundamental principle of the Mosaic law, under which slavery was\r\ninstituted by Jehovah himself: and third, with this absence of positive\r\nprohibition, and this absence of principle, to work its ruin, I affirm,\r\nthat in all the Roman provinces, where churches were planted by the\r\napostles, hereditary slavery existed, as it did among the Jews, and as\r\nit does now among us, (which admits of proof from history that no man\r\nwill dispute who knows any thing of the matter,) and that in instructing\r\nsuch churches, the Holy Ghost by the apostles, has recognized the\r\ninstitution, as one _legally existing_ among them, to be perpetuated in\r\nthe church, and that its duties are prescribed.\r\n\r\nNow for the proof: To the church planted at Ephesus the capital of the\r\nlesser Asia, Paul ordains by letter, subordination in the fear of\r\nGod,--first between wife and husband; second, child and parent; third,\r\nservant and master; _all, as states, or conditions, existing among the\r\nmembers_.\r\n\r\nThe relative duties of each state are pointed out; those between the\r\nservant and master in these words: \"Servants be obedient to them who are\r\nyour masters, according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in\r\nsingleness of your heart as unto Christ; not with eye service as men\r\npleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the\r\nheart, with good-will, doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men,\r\nknowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he\r\nreceive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. And ye masters do the\r\nsame things to them, forbearing threatening, knowing that your master is\r\nalso in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him.\" Here, by\r\nthe Roman law, the servant was property, and the control of the master\r\nunlimited, as we shall presently prove.\r\n\r\nTo the church at Colosse, a city of Phrygia, in the lesser Asia,--Paul\r\nin his letter to them, recognizes the three relations of wives and\r\nhusbands, parents and children, servants and masters, as relations\r\nexisting among the members; (here the Roman law was the same;) and to\r\nthe servants and masters he thus writes: \"Servants obey in all things\r\nyour masters, according to the flesh: not with eye service, as men\r\npleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God: and whatsoever you\r\ndo, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not unto men; knowing that of the\r\nLord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the\r\nLord Christ. But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong he has\r\ndone; and there is no respect of persons with God. Masters give unto\r\nyour servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a\r\nmaster in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe same Apostle writes a letter to the church at Corinth;--a very\r\nimportant city, formerly called the eye of Greece, either from its\r\nlocation, or intelligence, or both, and consequently, an important\r\npoint, for radiating light in all directions, in reference to subjects\r\nconnected with the cause of Jesus Christ; and particularly, in the\r\nbearing of its practical precepts on civil society, and the political\r\nstructure of nations. Under the direction of the Holy Ghost, he\r\ninstructs the church, that, on this particular subject, _one general\r\nprinciple_ was ordained of God, applicable alike in all countries and\r\nat all stages of the church's future history, and that it was this: \"_as\r\nthe Lord has called every one, so let him walk_.\" \"Let every man abide\r\nin the same calling wherein he is called.\" \"Let every man wherein he is\r\ncalled, therein abide with God.\"--1 Cor. vii: 17, 20, 24. \"_And so\r\nordain I in all churches_;\" vii: 17. The Apostle thus explains his\r\nmeaning:\r\n\r\n\"Is any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Art thou called, being a servant? Care not for it, but if thou mayest\r\nbe made free, use it rather;\" vii: 18, 21. Here, by the Roman law,\r\nslaves were property,--yet Paul ordains, in this, and all other\r\nchurches, that Christianity gave them no title to freedom, but on the\r\ncontrary, required them not to care for being slaves, or in other words,\r\nto be contented with their _state_, or _relation_, unless they could be\r\n_made free_, in a lawful way.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have a letter by Peter, who is the Apostle of the\r\ncircumcision--addressed especially to the Jews, who were scattered\r\nthrough various provinces of the Roman empire; comprising those\r\nprovinces especially, which were the theater of their dispersion, under\r\nthe Assyrians and Babylonians. Here, for the space of seven hundred and\r\nfifty years, they had resided, during which time those revolutions were\r\nin progress which terminated the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, and\r\nMacedonian empires, and transferred imperial power to Rome. These\r\nrevolutionary scenes of violence left one half the human race (within\r\nthe range of their influence,) in abject bondage to the other half. This\r\nwas the state of things in these provinces addressed by Peter, when he\r\nwrote. The chances of war, we may reasonably conclude, had assigned a\r\nfull share of bondage to this people, who were despised of all nations.\r\nIn view of their enslaved condition to the Gentiles; knowing, as Peter\r\ndid, their seditious character; foreseeing, from the prediction of the\r\nSaviour, the destined bondage of those who were then free in Israel,\r\nwhich was soon to take place, as it did, in the fall of Jerusalem, when\r\nall the males of seventeen, were sent to work in the mines of Egypt, as\r\nslaves to the State, and all the males under, amounting to upwards of\r\nninety-seven thousand, were sold into domestic bondage;--I say, in view\r\nof these things, Peter was moved by the Holy Ghost to write to them,\r\nand his solicitude for such of them as were in slavery, is very\r\nconspicuous in his letter; (read carefully from 1 Peter, 2d chapter,\r\nfrom the 13th verse to the end;) but it is not the solicitude of an\r\nabolitionist. He thus addresses them: \"Dearly beloved, I beseech you.\"\r\nHe thus instructs them: \"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for\r\nthe Lord's sake.\" \"For so is the will of God.\" \"Servants, be subject to\r\nyour masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to\r\nthe froward.\"--1 Peter ii: 11, 13, 15, 18. What an important document is\r\nthis! enjoining political subjection to _governments of every form_, and\r\nChristian subjection on the part of servants to their masters, whether\r\ngood or bad; for the purpose of showing forth to advantage, the _glory\r\nof the gospel_, and putting to silence the ignorance of foolish men, who\r\nmight think it seditious.\r\n\r\nBy \"every ordinance of man,\" as the context will show, is meant\r\ngovernmental regulations or laws, as was that of the Romans for\r\nenslaving their prisoners taken in war, instead of destroying their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nWhen such enslaved persons came into the church of Christ let them (says\r\nPeter) \"be subject to their masters with all fear,\" whether such masters\r\nbe good or bad. It is worthy of remark, that he says much to secure\r\ncivil subordination to the State, and hearty and cheerful obedience to\r\nthe masters, on the part of servants; yet he says nothing to masters in\r\nthe whole letter. It would seem from this, that danger to the cause of\r\nChrist was on the side of _insubordination among the servants_, and a\r\n_want of humility with inferiors_, rather than _haughtiness among\r\nsuperiors_ in the church.\r\n\r\nGibbon, in his Rome, vol. 1, pages 25, 26, 27, shows, from standard\r\nauthorities, that Rome at this time swayed its scepter over one hundred\r\nand twenty millions of souls; that in every province, and in every\r\nfamily, _absolute slavery existed_; that it was at least fifty years\r\nlater than the date of Peter's letters, before the absolute power of\r\nlife and death over the slave was _taken from the master_, and\r\n_committed to the magistrate_; that about sixty millions of souls were\r\nheld as property in this abject condition; that the price of a slave was\r\nfour times that of an ox; that their punishments were very sanguinary;\r\nthat in the second century, when their condition began to improve a\r\nlittle, emancipation was prohibited, except for great personal merit,\r\nor some public service rendered to the State; and that it was not until\r\nthe third or fourth generation after freedom was obtained, that the\r\ndescendants of a slave could share in the honors of the State. This is\r\nthe _state, condition_, or _relation_ among the _members of the\r\napostolic churches_, whether among _Gentiles_ or _Jews_; which the Holy\r\nGhost, by Paul for the Gentiles, and Peter for the Jews, recognizes as\r\nlawful; the mutual duties of which he prescribes in the language above.\r\nNow, I ask, can any man in his proper senses, from these premises, bring\r\nhimself to conclude that slavery is _abolished by Jesus Christ_, or that\r\nobligations are imposed by him upon his disciples that are subversive of\r\nthe institution? Knowing as we do from cotemporary historians, that the\r\ninstitution of slavery existed at the time and to the extent stated by\r\nGibbon--what sort of a soul a man must have, who, with these facts\r\nbefore him, will conceal the truth on this subject, and hold Jesus\r\nChrist responsible for a scheme of treason that would, if carried out,\r\nhave brought the life of every human being on earth at the time, into\r\nthe most imminent peril, and that must have worked the destruction of\r\nhalf the human race?\r\n\r\nAt Rome, the authoritative centre of that vast theater upon which the\r\nglories of the cross were to be won, a church was planted. Paul wrote a\r\nlong letter to them. On this subject it is full of instruction.\r\n\r\nAbolition sentiments had not dared to show themselves so near the\r\nimperial sword. To warn the church against their treasonable tendency,\r\nwas therefore unnecessary. Instead, therefore, of special precepts upon\r\nthe subject of relative duties between master and servant, he lays down\r\na system of practical morality, in the 12th chapter of his letter, which\r\nmust commend itself equally to the king on his throne, and the slave in\r\nhis hovel; for while its practical operation leaves the subject of\r\nearthly government to the discretion of man, it secures the exercise of\r\nsentiments and feelings that must exterminate every thing inconsistent\r\nwith doing to others as we would they should do unto us: a system of\r\nprinciples that will give moral strength to governments; peace,\r\nsecurity, and good-will to individuals; and glory to God in the highest.\r\nAnd in the 13th chapter, from the 1st to the end of the 7th verse, he\r\nrecognizes human government as an ordinance of God, which the followers\r\nof Christ are to obey, honor, and support; not only from dread of\r\npunishment, but _for conscience sake_; which I believe abolitionism\r\nrefuses most positively to do, to such governments as _from the force of\r\ncircumstances_ even _permit_ slavery.\r\n\r\nAgain. But we are furnished with additional light, and if we are not\r\ngreatly mistaken, with light which arose out of circumstances analogous\r\nto those which are threatening at the present moment to overthrow the\r\npeace of society, and deluge this nation with blood. To Titus whom Paul\r\nleft in Crete, to set in order the things that were wanting, he writes a\r\nletter, in which he warns him of false teachers, that were to be dreaded\r\non account of their doctrine. While they professed \"to know God,\" that\r\nis, to know his will under the gospel dispensation, \"in works they\r\ndenied him;\" that is, they did, and required others to do, what was\r\ncontrary to his will under the gospel dispensation. \"They were\r\nabominable,\" that is, to the Church and State, \"and disobedient,\" that\r\nis, to the authority of the apostles, and the civil authority of the\r\nland. Titus, he then exhorts, \"to speak the things that become sound\r\ndoctrine;\" that is, that the members of the church observe the law of\r\nthe land, and obey the civil magistrate; that \"servants be obedient to\r\ntheir own masters, and please them well in all things,\" not \"answering\r\nagain, not purloining, but showing all good fidelity, that they may\r\nadorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things,\" _in that which\r\nsubjects the ecclesiastical to the civil authority in particular_.\r\n\"These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority; let no\r\nman despise thee. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and\r\npowers, to obey magistrates.\"--Titus i: 16, and ii: from 1 to 10, and\r\niii: 1. The context shows that a doctrine was taught by these wicked\r\nmen, which tended in its influence on servants, to bring the gospel of\r\nChrist into contempt in Church and State, because of its seditions and\r\ninsubordinate character.\r\n\r\nBut at Ephesus, the capital of the lesser Asia, where Paul had labored\r\nwith great success for three years--a point of great importance to the\r\ngospel cause--the Apostle left Timothy for the purpose of watching\r\nagainst the false teachers, and particularly against the abolitionists.\r\nIn addition to a letter which he had addressed to this church\r\npreviously, in which the mutual duty of master and servant is taught,\r\nand which has already been referred to, he further instructs Timothy by\r\nletter on the same subject: \"Let as many servants as are under the yoke\r\ncount their masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his\r\ndoctrine be not blasphemed.\"--1 Tim. vi: 1. These were unbelieving\r\nmasters, as the next verse will show. In this church at Ephesus, the\r\ncircumstances existed, which are brought to light by Paul's letter to\r\nTimothy, that must silence every cavil, which men, who do not know God's\r\nwill on this subject, may start until time ends. In an age filled with\r\nliterary men, who are employed in transmitting historically, to future\r\ngenerations, the structure of society in the Roman Empire; that would\r\nput it in our power at this distant day, to know the state or condition\r\nof a slave in the Roman Empire, as well as if we had lived at the time,\r\nand to know beyond question, that his condition was precisely that one,\r\nwhich is now denounced as sinful: in such an age, and in such\r\ncircumstances, Jesus Christ causes his will to be published to the\r\nworld; and it is this, that if a Christian slave have an unbelieving\r\nmaster, who acknowledges no allegiance to Christ, this believing slave\r\nmust count his master worthy of all honor, according to what the Apostle\r\nteaches the Romans, \"Render, therefore, to all their dues, tribute to\r\nwhom tribute is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear,\r\nhonor to whom honor.\"--Rom. xiii: 7. Now, honor is enjoined of God in\r\nthe Scriptures, from children to parents--from husbands to wives--from\r\nsubjects to magistrates and rulers, and here by Jesus Christ, from\r\nChristian slaves to unbelieving masters, who held them as property by\r\nlaw, with power over their very lives. And the command is remarkable.\r\nWhile we are commanded to honor father and mother, without adding to the\r\nprecept \"all honor,\" here a Christian servant is bound to render to his\r\nunbelieving master \"all honor.\" Why is this? Because in the one case\r\nnature moves in the direction of the command; but in the other, against\r\nit. Nature being subjected to the law of grace, might be disposed to\r\nobey reluctantly; hence the amplitude of the command. But what purpose\r\nwas to be answered by this devotion of the slave? The Apostle answers,\r\n\"that the name of God and his doctrine (of subordination to the\r\nlaw-making power) be not blasphemed,\" as they certainly would by a\r\ncontrary course on the part of the servant, for the most obvious reason\r\nin the world; while the sword would have been drawn against the gospel,\r\nand a war of extermination waged against its propagators, in every\r\nprovince of the Roman Empire, for there was slavery in all; and so it\r\nwould be now.\r\n\r\nBut, says the caviler, these directions are given to Christian slaves\r\nwhose masters did not acknowledge the authority of Christ to govern\r\nthem; and are therefore defective as proof, that he approves of one\r\nChristian man holding another in bondage. Very well, we will see. In the\r\nnext verse, (1 Timothy vi: 2,) he says, \"and they that have believing\r\nmasters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren, but\r\nrather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers\r\nof the benefit.\" Here is a great change; instead of a command to a\r\nbelieving slave to render to a believing master _all honor_, and thereby\r\nmaking that believing master in _honor_ equal to an unbelieving master,\r\nhere is rather an exhortation to the slave _not to despise him, because\r\nhe is a believer_. Now, I ask, why the circumstance of a master becoming\r\na believer in Christ, should become the cause of his believing slave\r\ndespising him while that slave was supposed to acquiesce in the duty of\r\nrendering all honor to that master before he became a believer? I\r\nanswer, _precisely_, and _only, because_ there were _abolition teachers_\r\namong them, who _taught otherwise_, and consented not to wholesome\r\nwords, _even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ_.--1 Timothy vii: 3; and\r\n\"to the doctrine which is according to godliness,\" taught in the 8th\r\nverse, viz: having food and raiment, servants should therewith be\r\ncontent; for the pronoun us, in the 8th verse of this connection, means\r\n_especially_ the _servants he was instructing_, as well as Christians in\r\ngeneral. These men taught, that godliness abolished slavery, that it\r\ngave the title of freedom to the slave, and that so soon as a man\r\nprofessed to be subject to Christ, and refused to liberate his slaves,\r\nhe was a hypocrite, and deserved not the countenance of any who bore the\r\nChristian name. Such men, the Apostle says, are \"proud, (just as they\r\nare now,) knowing nothing,\" (that is, on this subject,) but \"doating\r\nabout questions, and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife,\r\nrailings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds,\r\nand destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such\r\nwithdraw thyself.\"--1 Tim. vi: 4, 5.\r\n\r\nSuch were the bitter fruits which abolition sentiments produced in the\r\nApostolic day, and such precisely are the fruits they produce now.\r\n\r\nNow, I say, here is the case made out, which certainly would call forth\r\nthe command from Christ, to abolish slavery, if he ever intended to\r\nabolish it. Both the servant and the master were one in Christ Jesus.\r\nBoth were members of the same church, both were under unlimited and\r\nvoluntary obedience to the same divine law-giver.\r\n\r\nNo political objection existed at the time against their obedience to\r\nhim on the subject of slavery; and what is the will, not of Paul, but of\r\nthe Lord Jesus Christ, immediately in person, upon the case thus made\r\nout? Does he say to the master, having put yourself under my government,\r\nyou must no longer hold your brother in bondage? Does he say to the\r\nslave, if your master does not release you, you must go and talk to him\r\nprivately, about this trespass upon your rights under the law of my\r\nkingdom; and if he does not hear you, you must take two or three with\r\nyou; and if he does not hear them then you must tell it to the church,\r\nand have him expelled from my flock, as a wolf in sheep's clothing? I\r\nsay, what does the Lord Jesus say to this poor believing slave,\r\nconcerning a master who held unlimited power over his person and life,\r\nunder the Roman law? He tells him that the very circumstance of his\r\nmaster's being a brother, constitutes the reason why he should be more\r\nready to do him service; for in addition to the circumstance of his\r\nbeing a brother who would be benefited by his service, he would as a\r\nbrother give him what was just and equal in return, and \"forbear\r\nthreatening,\" much less abusing his authority over him, for that he (the\r\nmaster) also had a master in heaven, who was no respecter of persons. It\r\nis taken for granted, on all hands pretty generally, that Jesus Christ\r\nhas at least been silent, or that he has not personally spoken on the\r\nsubject of slavery. Once for all, I deny it. Paul, after stating that a\r\nslave was to honor an unbelieving master, in the 1st verse of the 6th\r\nchapter, says, in the 2d verse, that to a believing master, he is the\r\nrather to do service, because he who partakes of the benefit is his\r\nbrother. He then says, if any man teach otherwise, (as all abolitionists\r\nthen did, and now do,) and consent not to wholesome words, \"even the\r\nwords of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Now, if our Lord Jesus Christ uttered\r\nsuch words, how dare we say he has been silent? If he has been silent,\r\nhow dare the Apostle say these are the words of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nif the Lord Jesus Christ never spoke them? \"Where, or when, or on what\r\noccasion he spoke them, we are not informed; but certain it is, that\r\nPaul has borne false witness, or that Jesus Christ has uttered the words\r\nthat impose an obligation on servants, who are abject slaves, to render\r\nservice with good-will from the heart, to believing masters, and to\r\naccount their unbelieving masters as worthy of all honor, that the name\r\nof God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. Jesus Christ revealed to Paul\r\nthe doctrine which Paul has settled throughout the Gentile world, (and\r\nby consequence, the Jewish world also,) on the subject of slavery, so\r\nfar as it affects his kingdom. As we have seen, it is clear and full.\r\n\r\nFrom the great importance of the subject, involving the personal liberty\r\nof half the human race at that time, and a large portion of them at all\r\ntimes since, it is not to be wondered at, that Paul would carry the\r\nquestion to the Saviour, and plead for a decisive expression of his\r\nwill, that would forever do away the necessity of inferring any thing by\r\nreasoning from the premises laid down in the former dispensation; or in\r\nthe patriarchal age; and at Ephesus, if not at Crete, the issue is\r\nfairly made, between Paul on the one side, and certain abolition\r\nteachers on the other, when, in addition to the official intelligence\r\nordinarily given to the apostles by the Holy Ghost, to guide them into\r\nall truth, he affirms, that the doctrine of perfect civil subordination,\r\non the part of hereditary slaves to their masters, whether believers or\r\nunbelievers, was one which he, Paul, taught in the words of the Lord\r\nJesus Christ himself.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures we have adduced from the New Testament, to prove the\r\nrecognition of hereditary slavery by the Saviour, as a lawful relation\r\nin the sight of God, lose much of their force from the use of a word by\r\nthe translators, which by time, has lost much of its original meaning;\r\nthat is, the word _servant_. Dr. Johnson, in his Dictionary, says:\r\n\"Servant is one of the few words, which by time has acquired a softer\r\nsignification than its original, knave, degenerated into cheat. While\r\n_servant_, which signified originally, a person preserved from death by\r\nthe conqueror, and reserved for slavery, signifies only an obedient\r\nattendant.\" Now, all history will prove that the servants of the New\r\nTestament addressed by the apostles, in their letters to the several\r\nchurches throughout the Roman Empire, were such as were perserved from\r\ndeath by the conqueror, and taken into slavery. This was their\r\ncondition, and it is a fact well known to all men acquainted with\r\nhistory. Had the word which designates their condition, in our\r\ntranslation, lost none of its original meaning, a common man could not\r\nhave fallen into a mistake as to the condition indicated. But to waive\r\nthis fact we are furnished with all the evidence that can be desired.\r\nThe Saviour appeared in an age of learning--the enslaved condition of\r\nhalf the Roman Empire, at the time, is a fact embodied with all the\r\nhistorical records--the constitution God gave the Jews, was in harmony\r\nwith the Roman regulations on the subject of slavery. In this state of\r\nthings, Jesus ordered his gospel to be preached in all the world, and to\r\nevery creature. It was done as he directed; and masters and servants,\r\nand persons in all conditions, were brought by the gospel to obey the\r\nSaviour. Churches were constituted. We have examined the letters written\r\nto the churches, composd of these materials. The result is, that each\r\nmember is furnished with a law to regulate the duties of his civil\r\nstation--from the highest to the lowest.\r\n\r\nWe will remark, in closing under this head, that we have shown from the\r\ntext of the sacred volume, that when God entered into covenant with\r\nAbraham, it was with him as a slaveholder; that when he took his\r\nposterity by the hand in Egypt, five hundred years afterward to confirm\r\nthe promise made to Abraham, it was done with them as slaveholders; that\r\nwhen he gave them a constitution of government, he gave them the right\r\nto perpetuate hereditary slavery; and that he did not for the fifteen\r\nhundred years of their national existence, express disapprobation toward\r\nthe institution.\r\n\r\nWe have also shown from authentic history that the institution of\r\nslavery existed in every family, and in every province of the Roman\r\nEmpire, at the time the gospel was published to them.\r\n\r\nWe have also shown from the New Testament, that all the churches are\r\nrecognized as composed of masters and servants; and that they are\r\ninstructed by Christ how to discharge their relative duties; and finally\r\nthat in reference to the question which was then started, whether\r\nChristianity did not abolish the institution, or the right of one\r\nChristian to hold another Christian in bondage, we have shown, that \"the\r\nwords of our Lord Jesus Christ\" are, that so far from this being the\r\ncase, it adds to the obligation of the servant to render service with\r\ngood-will to his master, and that gospel fellowship is not to be\r\nentertained with persons who will not consent to it!\r\n\r\nI propose, in the fourth place, to show that the institution of slavery\r\nis full of mercy. I shall say but a few words on this subject. Authentic\r\nhistory warrants this conclusion, that for a long period of time, it was\r\nthis institution alone which furnished a motive for sparing the\r\nprisoner's life. The chances of war, when the earth was filled with\r\nsmall tribes of men, who had a passion for it, brought to decision,\r\nalmost daily, conflicts, where nothing but this institution interposed\r\nan inducement to save the vanquished. The same was true in the enlarged\r\nschemes of conquest, which brought the four great universal empires of\r\nthe Scriptures to the zenith of their power.\r\n\r\nThe same is true in the history of Africa, as far back as we can trace\r\nit. It is only sober truth to say, that the institution of slavery has\r\nsaved from the sword more lives, including their increase, than all the\r\nsouls who now inhabit this globe.\r\n\r\nThe souls thus conquered and subjected to masters, who feared not God\r\nnor regarded men, in the days of Abraham, Job, and the patriarchs, were\r\nsurely brought under great obligations to the mercy of God, in allowing\r\nsuch men as these to purchase them, and keep them in their families.\r\n\r\nThe institution when engrafted on the Jewish constitution, was designed\r\nprincipally, not to enlarge the number, but to ameliorate the condition\r\nof the slaves in the neighboring nations.\r\n\r\nUnder the gospel, it has brought within the range of gospel influence,\r\nmillions of Ham's descendant's among ourselves, who but for this\r\ninstitution, would have sunk down to eternal ruin; knowing not God, and\r\nstrangers to the gospel. In their bondage here on earth, they have been\r\nmuch better provided for, and great multitudes of them have been made\r\nthe freemen of the Lord Jesus Christ, and left this world rejoicing in\r\nhope of the glory of God. The elements of an empire, which I hope will\r\nlead Ethiopia very soon to stretch out her hands to God, is the fruit of\r\nthe institution here. An officious meddling with the institution, from\r\nfeeling and sentiments unknown to the Bible, may lead to the\r\nextermination of the slave race among us, who, taken as a whole, are\r\nutterly unprepared for a higher civil state; but benefit them, it\r\ncannot. Their condition, _as a class_, is now better than that of any\r\nother equal number of laborers on earth, and is daily improving.\r\n\r\nIf the Bible is allowed to awaken the spirit, and control the\r\nphilanthropy which works their good, the day is not far distant when\r\nthe highest wishes of saints will be gratified, in having conferred on\r\nthem all that the spirit of good-will can bestow. This spirit which was\r\nkindling into life, has received a great check among us of late, by that\r\ntrait which the Apostle Peter reproves and shames in his officious\r\ncountrymen, when he says: \"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or\r\nas a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a busy-body in other men's\r\nmatters.\" Our citizens have been murdered--our property has been stolen,\r\n(if the receiver is as bad as the thief,)--our lives have been put in\r\njeopardy--our characters traduced--and attempts made to force political\r\nslavery upon us in the place of domestic, by strangers who have no right\r\nto meddle with our matters. Instead of meditating generous things to our\r\nslaves, as a return for gospel subordination, we have to put on our\r\narmor to suppress a rebellious spirit, engendered by \"false doctrine,\"\r\npropagated by men \"of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth,\" who\r\nteach them that the gain of freedom to the slave, is the only proof of\r\ngodliness in the master. From such, Paul says we must withdraw\r\nourselves; and if we fail to do it, and to rebuke them with all the\r\nauthority which \"the words of our Lord Jesus Christ\" confer, we shall be\r\nwanting in duty to them, to ourselves, and to the world.\r\n\r\n                                                  THORNTON STRINGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[229] The property in slaves in the United States is their _service or\r\nlabor_. The Constitution guarantees this property to its owner, both in\r\napprentices and slaves. And the Supreme Court has decided, Judge Baldwin\r\npresiding, that all the means \"necessary and proper\" to secure this\r\nproperty, may be constitutionally used by the master, in the absence of\r\nall statute law. The Roman law made the slave of that law, to be, not a\r\n_personal chattel_, held to service or labor only, as is the American\r\napprentice or slave, but to be a _mere thing_; and guaranteed to the\r\nmaster the right to do with that _mere thing_, just as he pleased. To\r\ncut it up, for instance, as the master sometimes did, to feed fishes.\r\n\r\nAbolitionists are guilty of the inexcusable wickedness of holding up\r\nthis ancient Roman slavery, as a model of American slavery; although\r\nthey know that the personal rights of apprentices and slaves, are as\r\nwell defined and secured, by judicial decisions and statute laws, as the\r\nrights of husband and wife, parent and child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nOF ELDER GALUSHA'S REPLY TO DR. RICHARD FULLER OF SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER my essay on slavery was published in the _Herald_,[230] I sent a\r\ncopy of it to a prominent abolition gentleman in New York, accompanied\r\nby a friendly letter.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman I selected as a correspondent, because of his high\r\nstanding, intellectual attainments, and unquestioned piety. I frankly\r\navowed to him my readiness to abandon slavery, so soon as I was\r\nconvinced by the Bible that it was sinful, and requested him, \"if the\r\nBible contained precepts, and settled principles of conduct, in direct\r\nopposition to those portions of it upon which I relied, as furnishing\r\nthe mind of the Almighty upon the subject of slavery, that he would\r\nfurnish me with the knowledge of the fact.\" To this letter I received a\r\nfriendly reply, accompanied by a printed communication containing the\r\nresult of a prayerful effort which he had previously made, for the\r\npurpose of furnishing the very information to a friend at the South,\r\nwhich I sought to obtain at his hands.\r\n\r\nIt may be owing to my prejudices, or a want of intellect, that I fail to\r\nbe convinced, by those portions of the Bible to which he refers, to\r\nprove that slavery is sinful. But as the support of truth is _my\r\nobject_, and as I wish to have the answer of a good conscience toward\r\nGod in this matter, I herewith publish, for the information of all into\r\nwhose hands my first essay may have fallen, every passage in the Bible\r\nto which this distinguished brother refers me for \"precepts and settled\r\nprinciples of conduct, in direct opposition to those portions of it upon\r\nwhich I relied, as furnishing the mind of the Almighty upon the subject\r\nof slavery.\"\r\n\r\n1st. His reference to the sacred volume is this: \"God hath made of one\r\nblood all nations of men.\" This is a Scripture truth which I believe;\r\nyet God decreed that Canaan should be a servant of servants to his\r\nbrother--that is, an abject slave in his posterity. This God effected\r\neight hundred years afterward, in the days of Joshua, when the\r\nGibeonites were subjected to prepetual bondage, and made hewers of wood\r\nand drawers of water.--Joshua ix: 23.\r\n\r\nAgain, God ordained, as law-giver to Israel, that their captives taken\r\nin war should be enslaved.--Deut. xx: 10 to 15.\r\n\r\nAgain, God enacted that the Israelites should buy slaves of the heathen\r\nnations around them, and will them and their increase as property to\r\ntheir children forever.--Levit. xxv: 44, 45, 46. All these nations were\r\n_made of one blood_. Yet God ordained that some should be \"chattel\"\r\nslaves to others, and gave his special aid to effect it. In view of this\r\nincontrovertible fact, how can I believe this passage disproves the\r\nlawfulness of slavery in the sight of God? How can any sane man believe\r\nit, who believes the Bible?\r\n\r\n2d. His second Scripture reference to disprove the lawfulness of\r\nslavery in the sight of God, is this: \"God has said a man is better than\r\na sheep.\" This is a Scripture truth which I fully believe--and I have no\r\ndoubt, if we could ascertain what the Israelites had to pay for those\r\nslaves they bought with their money according to God's law, in Levit.\r\nxxv: 44, that we should find they had to pay more for them than they\r\npaid for sheep, for the reason assigned by the Saviour; that is, that a\r\nservant man is better than a sheep; for when he is done plowing, or\r\nfeeding cattle, and comes in from the field, he will, at his master's\r\nbidding, prepare him his meal, and wait upon him till he eats it, while\r\nthe master feels under no obligation even to thank him for it because he\r\nhas done no more than his duty.--Luke xvii: 7, 8, 9. This, and other\r\nimportant duties, which the people of God bought their slaves to perform\r\nfor them, by the permission of their Maker, were duties which sheep\r\ncould not perform. But I cannot see what there is in it to blot out from\r\nthe Bible a relation which God created, in which he made one man to be a\r\nslave to another.\r\n\r\n3d. His third Scripture reference to prove the unlawfulness of slavery\r\nin the sight of God, is this: \"God commands children to obey their\r\nparents, and wives to obey their husbands.\" This, I believe to be the\r\nwill of Christ to Christian children and Christian wives--whether they\r\nare bond or free. But it is equally true that Christ ordains that\r\nChristianity shall not abolish slavery.--1 Cor. vii: 17, 21, and that he\r\ncommands servants to obey their masters and to count them worthy of all\r\nhonor.--1 Tim. vi: 1, 2. It is also true, that God allowed Jewish\r\nmasters to use the rod to make them do it--and to use it with the\r\nseverity requisite to accomplish the object.--Exod. xxi: 20,21. It is\r\nequally true, that Jesus Christ ordains that a Christian servant shall\r\nreceive for the wrong he hath done.--Col. iii: 25. My correspondent\r\nadmits, without qualification, that if they are property, it is right.\r\nBut the Bible says, they were property.--Levit. xxv: 44, 45, 46.\r\n\r\nThe above reference, reader, _enjoins_ the _duty_ of two _relations_,\r\nwhich God ordained, but does not _abolish_ a third _relation_ which _God\r\nhas ordained_; as the Scripture will prove, to which I have referred\r\nyou, under the first reference made by my correspondent.\r\n\r\n4th. His fourth Scripture reference is, to the _intention_ of Abraham to\r\ngive his estate to a servant, in order to prove that servant was not a\r\nslave. \"What,\" he says, \"property inherit property?\" I answer, yes. Two\r\nyears ago, in my county, William Hansbrough gave to his slaves his\r\nestate, worth forty or fifty thousand dollars. In the last five or six\r\nyears, over two hundred slaves, within a few miles of me, belonging to\r\nvarious masters, have inherited portions of their masters' estates.\r\n\r\nTo render slaves valuable, the Romans qualified them for the learned\r\nprofessions, and all the various arts. They were teachers, doctors,\r\nauthors, mechanics, etc. So with us, tradesmen of every kind are to be\r\nfound among our slaves. Some of them are undertakers--some farmers--some\r\noverseers, or stewards--some housekeepers--some merchants--some\r\nteamsters, and some money-lenders, who give their masters a portion of\r\ntheir income, and keep the balance. Nearly all of them have an income of\r\ntheir own--and was it not for the seditious spirit of the North, we\r\nwould educate our slaves generally, and so fit them earlier for a more\r\nimproved condition, and higher moral elevation.\r\n\r\nBut will all this, when duly certified, prove they are not slaves? No.\r\nNeither will Abraham's _intention_ to give one of his servants his\r\nestate, prove that he was not a slave. Who had higher claims upon\r\nAbraham, before he had a child, than this faithful slave, born in his\r\nhouse, reared by his hand, devoted to his interest, and faithful in\r\nevery trust?\r\n\r\n5th. His fifth reference, my correspondent says, \"forever sets the\r\nquestion at rest.\" It is this: \"Thou shalt not deliver unto his master,\r\nthe servant which is escaped from his master unto thee--he shall dwell\r\nwith thee, even in that place which he shall choose, in one of thy\r\ngates, where it liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him.\"\r\n\r\nThis my distinguished correspondent says, \"forever puts the question at\r\nrest.\" My reader, I hope, will ask himself what question it puts to\r\nrest. He will please to remember, that it is brought to put this\r\nquestion to rest, \"Is slavery sinful in the sight of God?\" the Bible\r\nbeing judge--or \"did God ever allow one man to hold property in\r\nanother?\"\r\n\r\nMy correspondent admits this to be the question at issue. He asks, \"What\r\nis slavery?\" And thus answers: \"It is the principle involved in holding\r\nman as property.\" \"This,\" he says: \"is the point at issue.\" He says, \"if\r\nit be right to hold man as property, it is right to treat him as\r\nproperty,\" etc. Now, conceding all in the argument, that can be demanded\r\nfor this law about run-away slaves, yet it does not prove that slavery\r\nor holding property in man is sinful--because it is a part and parcel of\r\nthe Mosaic law, given to Israel in the wilderness by the same God, who\r\nin the same wilderness enacted \"that of the heathen that were round\r\nabout them, they should buy bond-men and bond-women--also of the\r\nstrangers that dwelt among them should they buy, and they should pass as\r\nan inheritance to their children after them, to possess them as bond-men\r\nforever.\"--Levit. xxv: 44.\r\n\r\nHow can I admit that a prohibition to deliver up a run-away slave, under\r\nthe law of Moses, is proof that there was no slavery allowed under that\r\nlaw? Here is the law from God himself,--Levit. xxv: 44, authorizing the\r\nIsraelites to buy slaves and transmit them and their increase as a\r\npossession to their posterity forever--and to make slaves of their\r\ncaptives taken in war.--Deut. xx: 10-15. Suppose, for argument's sake, I\r\nadmit that God prohibited the delivery back of one of _these slaves_,\r\nwhen he fled from his master--would that prove that he was not a slave\r\nbefore he fled? Would that prove that he did not remain legally a slave\r\nin the sight of God, according to his own law, until he fled? The\r\npassage proves the very reverse of that which it is brought to prove. It\r\nproves that the slave is recognized by God himself as a slave, until he\r\nfled to the Israelites. My correspondent's exposition of this law seems\r\nbased upon the idea that God, who had held fellowship with slavery among\r\nhis people for five hundred years, and who had just given them a formal\r\nstatute to legalize the purchase of slaves from the heathen, and to\r\nenslave their captives taken in war, was, nevertheless, desirous to\r\nabolish the institution. But, as if afraid to march directly up to his\r\nobject, he was disposed to undermine what he was unwilling to attempt to\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\nUpon the principle that man is prone to think God is altogether such an\r\none as himself, we may account for such an interpretation at the present\r\ntime, by men north of Mason & Dixon's line. Our brethren there have held\r\nfellowship with this institution, by the constitutional oath they have\r\ntaken to protect us in this property. Unable, constitutionally, to\r\noverthrow the institution, they see, or think they see, a sanction in\r\nthe law of God to undermine it, by opening their gates and letting our\r\nrun-away slaves \"dwell among them where it liketh them best.\" If I could\r\nbe astonished at any thing in this controversy, it would be to see\r\nsensible men engaged in the study of that part of the Bible which\r\nrelates to the rights of property, as established by the Almighty\r\nhimself, giving in to the idea that the Judge of the world, acting in\r\nthe character of a national law-giver, would legalize a property right\r\nin slaves, _as he did_--give full power to the master to govern--secure\r\nthe increase as an inheritance to posterity for all time to come--and\r\nthen add a clause to legalize a fraud upon the unsuspecting purchaser.\r\nFor what better is it, under this interpretation?\r\n\r\nWith respect to slaves purchased of the heathen, or enslaved by war, the\r\nlaw passed a clear title to them and their increase forever. With\r\nrespect to the hired servants of the Hebrews, the law secured to the\r\nmaster a right to their service until the Sabbatic year or\r\nJubilee--unless they were bought back by a near kinsman at a stated\r\nprice in money when owned by a heathen master. But these legal rights,\r\nunder these laws of heaven's King, by this interpretation, are all\r\ncanceled--for the pecuniary loss, there is no redress--and for the\r\ninsult no remedy, whenever a \"liketh him best\" man can induce the slave\r\nto run away. And worse still, the community of masters thus insulted and\r\nswindled, according to this interpretation, are bound to show respect\r\nand afford protection to the villains who practice it. Who can believe\r\nall this? I judge our Northern brethren will say, the Lord deliver us\r\nfrom such legislation as this. So say we. What, then, does this run-away\r\nlaw mean? It means that the God of Israel ordained his people to be an\r\nasylum for the slave who fled from heathen cruelty to them for\r\nprotection; it is the law of nations--but surrendered under the\r\nConstitution by these States, who agreed to deliver them up. See, says\r\nGod, ye oppress not the stranger. Thou shalt neither _vex_ a stranger,\r\nnor _oppress_ him.--Exod. xxii: 21.\r\n\r\nHis 6th reference to the Bible is this: \"Do to others as ye would they\r\nshould do to you.\" I have shown in the essay, that these words of our\r\nSaviour, embody the same moral principle, which is embodied by Moses in\r\nLevit. xix: 18, in these words, \"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\" In this\r\nwe can not be mistaken, because Jesus says there are but two such\r\nprinciples in God's moral government--_one_ of supreme love of\r\nGod--_another_ of love to our neighbor as ourself. To the everlasting\r\nconfusion of the argument from moral precepts, to overthrow the\r\npositive institution of slavery, this moral precept was given to\r\nregulate the mutual duties of this very relation, which God by law\r\nordained for the Jewish commonwealth.\r\n\r\nHow can that which regulates the _duty_, overthrow the _relation_\r\nitself?\r\n\r\nHis 7th reference is, \"They which are accounted to rule over the\r\nGentiles, exercise lordship over them, but so it shall not be among\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nTurn to the passage, reader, in Mark x: 42; and try your ingenuity at\r\nexpounding, and see if you can destroy one _relation_ that has been\r\ncreated among men, because the _authority_ given in another relation was\r\n_abused_. The Saviour refers to the _abuse_ of State _authority_, as a\r\nwarning to those who should be clothed with _authority_ in his kingdom,\r\nnot to _abuse_ it, but to connect the use of it with humility. But how\r\nofficial humility in the kingdom of Christ, is to rob States of the\r\nright to make their own laws, dissolve the relation of slavery\r\nrecognized by the Saviour as a lawful relation, and overthrow the right\r\nof property in slaves as settled by God himself, I know not. Paul, in\r\ndrawing the character of those who oppose slavery, in his letter to\r\nTimothy, says, (vi: 4,) they are \"proud, knowing nothing;\" he means,\r\nthat they were puffed with a conceit of their superior sanctity, while\r\nthey were deplorably ignorant of the will of Christ on this subject. Is\r\nit not great pride that leads a man to think he is better than the\r\nSaviour? Jesus held fellowship with, and enjoined subjection to\r\ngovernments, which sanctioned slavery in its worst form--but\r\nabolitionists refuse fellowship for governments which have mitigated all\r\nits rigors.\r\n\r\nGod established the relation by law, and bestowed the highest\r\nmanifestations of his favor upon slaveholders; and has caused it to be\r\nwritten as with a sunbeam in the Scriptures. Yet such saints would be\r\nrefused the ordinary tokens of Christian fellowship among abolitionists.\r\nIf Abraham were on earth, they could not let him, consistently, occupy\r\ntheir pulpits, to tell of the things God has prepared for them that love\r\nhim. Job himself would be unfit for their communion. Joseph would be\r\nplaced on a level with pirates. Not a single church planted by the\r\napostles would make a fit home for our abolition brethren, (for they all\r\nhad masters and slaves.) The apostles and their ministerial associates\r\ncould not occupy their pulpits, for they fraternized with slavery, and\r\nupheld State authority upon the subject. Now, I ask, with due respect\r\nfor all parties, can sentiments which lead to such results as these be\r\nheld by any man, _in the absence of pride_ of no ordinary character,\r\nwhether he be sensible of it or not?\r\n\r\nAgain, whatever of intellect we may have--can that something which\r\nprompts to results like these be _Bible knowledge_?\r\n\r\nReference the 8th is favorable in _sound_ if not in _sense_. It is in\r\nthese words, \"Neither be ye called _masters_, for one is your _master_,\r\neven Christ.\" I am free to confess, it is difficult to repress the\r\nspirit which the prophet felt when he witnessed the zeal of his deluded\r\ncountrymen, at Mount Carmel. I think a sensible man ought to know\r\nbetter, than to refer me to such a passage, to prove slavery unlawful;\r\nyet my correspondent is a sensible man. However, I will balance it by an\r\nequal authority, for dissolving another relation. \"Call no man _father_\r\nupon earth, for one is your _father_ in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the last abolishes the _relation_ between _parent and child_, the\r\nfirst will abolish the _relation_ between _master and servant_.\r\n\r\nThe 9th reference to prove slavery unlawful in the sight of God, is\r\nthis: \"He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his\r\nhand, he shall surely be put to death.\" Wonderful!\r\n\r\nI suppose that no State has ever established domestic slavery, which did\r\nnot find such a law necessary. It is this institution which makes such a\r\nlaw needful. Unless slavery exists, there would be no motive to steal a\r\nman. And, the danger is greater in a slave State than a free one.\r\nVirginia has such a law, and so have all the States of North America.\r\n\r\nWill these laws prove four thousand years hence that slavery did not\r\nexist in the United States? No--but why not! Because the statute will\r\nstill exist, which authorizes us to buy bond-men and bond-women with our\r\nmoney, and give them and their increase as an inheritance to our\r\nchildren, forever. So the Mosaic statute still exists, which authorized\r\nthe Jews to do the same thing, and God is its author.\r\n\r\nReference the 10th is: \"Rob not the poor because he is poor. Let the\r\noppressed go free; break every yoke; deliver him that is spoiled out of\r\nthe hand of the oppressor. What doth the Lord require of thee but to do\r\njustly, love mercy, walk humbly with thy God. He that oppresseth the\r\npoor reproacheth his Maker.\" This _sounds_ very well, reader, yet I\r\npropose to make every man who reads me, _confess_, that these Scriptures\r\nwill not condemn slavery. Answer me this question: Are these, and such\r\nlike passages, in the Old Testament, from whence they are all taken,\r\nintended to reprove and condemn that people, for doing what God, in his\r\nlaw gave them a right to do? I know you must answer, they were not;\r\nconsequently, you confess they do not condemn slavery; because God gave\r\nthem the right, by law, to purchase slaves of the heathen.--Levit. xxv:\r\n44. And to make slaves of their captives taken in war.--Deut. xx: 14.\r\nThe moral precepts of the Old or New Testament cannot make that wrong\r\nwhich God ordained to be his will, as he has slavery.\r\n\r\nThe 11th reference of my distinguished correspondent to the sacred\r\nvolume, to prove that slavery is contrary to the will of Jesus Christ\r\nand sinful, is in these words: \"Masters, give unto your servants that\r\nwhich is just and equal.\" The argument of my correspondent is this, that\r\nslavery is a relation, in which rights based upon _justice_ cannot\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nI answer, God ordained, after man sinned, that he, \"should eat bread\r\n(that is, _have food and raiment_) in the sweat of his face.\"\r\n\r\nHe has since ordained, that some should be slaves to others, (as we have\r\nproved under the first reference.) _Therefore_, when food and raiment\r\nare withheld from him in slavery, it is _unjust_.\r\n\r\nGod has ordained food and raiment, as wages for the sweat of the face.\r\nChrist has ordained that with these, whether in slavery or freedom, his\r\ndisciples shall be content.\r\n\r\nThe relation of master and slave, says Gibbon, existed in every province\r\nand in every family of the Roman Empire. Jesus ordains in the 13th\r\nchapter of Romans, from the 1st to the end of the 7th verse, and in 1\r\nPeter, 2d chapter, 13th, 14th, and 15th verses, that the _legislative\r\nauthority_, which created the relation, should be obeyed and honored by\r\nhis disciples. But while he thus _legalises_ the _relation_ of master\r\nand slave as established by the civil law, he proceeds to prescribe the\r\nmutual duties which the parties, when they come into his kingdom, must\r\nperform to each other.\r\n\r\nThe reference of my correspondent to disprove the _relation_, is a part\r\nof what Jesus has prescribed on this subject to _regulate_ the _duties_\r\nof the relation, and is itself proof that the relation existed--that\r\nits legality was recognized--and its duties prescribed by the Son of God\r\nthrough the Holy Ghost given to the apostles.\r\n\r\nThe 12th reference is, \"Let as many servants as are under the yoke,\r\ncount their masters worthy of all honor. And they that have believing\r\nmasters, let them not despise them because they are brethren, but rather\r\ndo them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the\r\nbenefit.\" If my reader will turn to my remarks, in my first essay upon\r\nthis Scripture, he will cease to wonder that it fails to convince me\r\nthat slavery is sinful. I should think the wonder would be, that any man\r\never quoted it for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly. My correspondent informs me that the Greek word \"doulos,\"\r\ntranslated servant, means hired servant and not slave.\r\n\r\nI reply, that the primary meaning of this Greek word, is in a singular\r\nstate of preservation. God, as if foreseeing and providing for this\r\ncontroversy, has caused, in his providence, that its meaning in Greek\r\ndictionaries shall be thus given, \"the opposite of free.\" Now, readers,\r\nwhat is the _opposite_ of _free_? Is it a state somewhere _between_\r\nfreedom and slavery? If freedom, as a condition, has an opposite, that\r\nopposite state is indicated by this very word \"doulos.\" So says every\r\nGreek lexicographer. I ask, if this is not wonderful, that the Holy\r\nGhost has used a term, so incapable of deceiving, and yet that that term\r\nshould be brought forward for the purpose of deception. Another\r\nremarkable fact is this: the English word servant, originally meant\r\nprecisely the same thing as the Greek word \"doulos;\" that is, says Dr.\r\nJohnson in his Dictionary, it meant formerly a captive taken in war, and\r\nreserved for slavery. These are two remarkable facts in the providence\r\nof God. But, reader, I will give you a Bible key, by which to decide for\r\nyourself, without foreign aid, whether _servant_, when it denotes a\r\nrelation in society, where the other side of that relation is _master_,\r\nmeans _hired servant_. \"Every man's servant that is bought for money\r\nshall eat thereof; but a hired servant shall not eat thereof.\"--Exod.\r\nxii; 44, 45. Here are two classes of servants alluded to--one was\r\nallowed to eat the Passover the night Israel left Egypt; the other not.\r\nWhat was the difference in these two classes? Were they both hired\r\nservants? If so, it should read, \"Every hired servant that is bought for\r\nmoney shall eat thereof; but a hired servant that is bought for money,\r\nshall not eat thereof.\" My reader, why has the Holy Ghost, in presiding\r\nover the inspired pen, been thus particular? Is it too much to say, it\r\nwas to provide against the delusion of the nineteenth century, which\r\nlearned men would be practicing upon unlearned men, as well as\r\nthemselves, on the subject of slavery? Who, with the Bible and their\r\nlearning, would not be able to discover, that a servant bought with\r\nmoney was a slave; and that a hired servant was a free man? Again,\r\nLevit. xxv: 44, 45, and 46; \"Thy bond-servants shall be of the heathen\r\nthat are round about you, and of the children of the strangers that do\r\nsojourn among you, of them shall ye buy. And they shall be your\r\npossession, and ye shall take them as an inheritance, for your children\r\nafter you, to inherit them for a possession, they shall be your bond-men\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\nReader, were these hired servants? If so, they hired themselves for a\r\nlong time. And what is very singular, they hired their posterity for all\r\ntime to come. And what is still more singular, the wages were paid, not\r\nto the servant, but to a former owner or master. And what is still\r\nstranger, they hired themselves and their posterity to be an inheritance\r\nto their master and his posterity forever! Yet, reader, I am told by my\r\ndistinguished correspondent, that servant in the Scriptures, when used\r\nto designate a relation, means only hired servant. Again, I ask, were\r\nthe enslaved captives in Deut. xx: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, hired\r\nservants?\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest and best of men ever raised at the North, (I mean\r\nLuther Rice,) once told me when I quoted the law of God for the purchase\r\nof slaves from the heathen, (in order to silence his argument about\r\n\"doulos,\" and hired servant,) I say he told me positively, there was no\r\nsuch law. When I opened the Bible and showed it to him, his shame was\r\nvery visible. (And I hope he is not the only great and good man, that\r\nGod will put to shame for being ignorant of his word.) But he never\r\nopened his mouth to me about slavery again while he lived.\r\n\r\nIf my reader does no _better_ than he did, at least let him not fight\r\nagainst God for establishing the institution of \"chattel\" slavery in his\r\nkingdom, nor against me for believing he did do it. But, reader, if you\r\nhave the hardihood to insist that these were hired servants, and not\r\nslaves after all, then, I answer, that ours are hired servants, too,\r\nand not slaves; and so the dispute ends favorably to the South, and it\r\nis lawful for us, according to abolition admissions, to hold them to\r\nservitude. For ours, we paid money to a former owner; so did the Jews\r\nfor theirs. The increase of ours passes as an inheritance to our\r\nchildren, so did the increase of the Jewish servants pass as an\r\ninheritance to their children, to be an inheritance forever. And all\r\nthis took place by the direction of God to his chosen people.\r\n\r\nMy correspondent thinks with Mr. Jefferson, that Jehovah has no\r\nattributes that will harmonize with slavery; and that all men are born\r\nfree and equal. Now, I say let him throw away his Bible as Mr. Jefferson\r\ndid his, and then they will be fit companions. But never disgrace the\r\nBible by making Mr. Jefferson its expounder, nor Mr. Jefferson by\r\nderiving his sentiments from it. Mr. Jefferson did not bow to the\r\nauthority of the Bible, and on this subject I do not bow to him. How can\r\nany man, who believes the Bible, admit for a moment that God intended to\r\nteach mankind by the Bible, that all are born free and equal?\r\n\r\nMen who engage in this controversy ought to look into the Bible, and see\r\nwhat is in it about slavery. I do not know how to account for such men\r\nsaying, as my correspondent does, that the slave of the Mosaic law,\r\npurchased of the heathen, was a hired servant; and that both he and the\r\nHebrew hired servant of the same law, had a passport from God to run\r\naway from their masters with impunity, to prove which is the object of\r\none of his quotations. Again, New Testament _servants_ and _masters_ are\r\nnot the servants and masters of the Mosaic law, but the servants and\r\nmasters of the Roman Empire. To go to the law of Moses to find out the\r\nstatutes of the Roman Empire, is folly. Yet on this subject the\r\ndifference is not great, and so far as humanity (in the abolition sense\r\nof it) is concerned, is in favor of the Roman law.\r\n\r\nThe laws of each made slaves to be property, and allowed them to be\r\nbought and sold. See Gibbon's Rome, vol. i: pp. 25, 26, and Levit. xxv:\r\n44, 45, 46. The laws of each allowed prisoners taken in war to be\r\nenslaved. See Gibbon as above, and Deut. xx: 10-15. The difference was\r\nthis: the Roman law allowed _men_ taken in battle to be enslaved--the\r\nJewish law required the _men_ taken in battle to be put to death, and to\r\nenslave their wives and children. In the case of the Midianites, the\r\nmercy of enslaving some of the women was denied them because they had\r\nenticed the Israelites into sin, and subjected them to a heavy judgment\r\nunder Balaam's counsel, and for a reason not assigned, the mercy of\r\nslavery was denied to the male children in this special case. See\r\nNumbers xxxi: 15, 16, 17.\r\n\r\nThe first letter to Timothy, while at Ephesus, if rightly understood,\r\nwould do much to stay the hands of men, who have more zeal than\r\nknowledge on this subject. See again what I have written in my first\r\nessay on this letter. In addition to what I have there said, I would\r\nstate, that the \"_other doctrine_,\" 1 Tim. i: 3, which Paul says, must\r\nnot be taught, I take to be a principle tantamount to this, that Jesus\r\nChrist proposed to subordinate the civil to ecclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine which was \"_according to godliness_,\" 1 Tim, vi: 3, I take\r\nto be a principle which subordinated the church, or Christ in his\r\nmembers, to civil governments, or \"the powers that be.\" One principle\r\nwas seditious, and when consummated must end in the man of sin. The\r\nother principle was practically a quiet submission to government, as an\r\nordinance of God in the hands of men.\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists, at Ephesus, in attempting to interfere with the\r\nrelations of slavery, and to unsettle the rights of property, acted upon\r\na principle, which statesmen must see, would in the end, subject the\r\nwhole frame-work of government to the supervision of the church, and\r\nterminate in the man of sin, or a pretended successor of Christ, sitting\r\nin the temple of God, and claiming a right to reign over, and control\r\nthe civil governments of the world. The Apostle, therefore, chapter ii:\r\n1, to render the doctrine of subordination to the State a very prominent\r\ndoctrine, and to cause the knowledge of it to spread among all who\r\nattended their worship, orders that the very first thing done by the\r\nchurch should be, that of making supplication, prayers, and\r\nintercessions, and giving God thanks for all men that were placed in\r\nauthority, by the State, for the administration of civil government. He\r\nassigns the reason for this injunction, \"that we may lead a quiet and\r\npeaceable life in all godliness and honesty.\"\r\n\r\nMy correspondent complains, that abolitionists at the North are not safe\r\nwhen they come among us. They are much safer than the saints of Ephesus\r\nwould have been in the Apostolic day, if Paul would have allowed the\r\nseditious doctrine to be propagated which our Northern brethren think it\r\nsuch a merit to preach, when it subjects them to no risk. How can they\r\nexpect, in the nature of things, to lead a quiet and peaceable life when\r\nthey come among us? They are _organized_ to overthrow our\r\nsovereignty--to put our lives in peril, and to trample upon Bible\r\nprinciples, by which the rights of property are to be settled.\r\n\r\nQuestions and strifes of words characterized the disputes of the\r\nabolitionists at Ephesus about slavery. It is amusing and painful to see\r\nthe questions and strifes of words in the piece of my correspondent.\r\nMany of these questions are about our property right in slaves. The\r\n_substance of them_ is this: that the present title is not good, because\r\nthe original title grew out of violence and injustice. But, reader, our\r\noriginal title was obtained in the same way which God in his law\r\nauthorized his people to obtain theirs. They obtained their slaves by\r\npurchase of those who made them captives in the hazards of war, or by\r\nconquest with their own sword. My correspondent speaks at one time as if\r\nours were stolen in the first instance; but, as if forgetting that, in\r\nanother place he says, that so great is the hazard attending the wars of\r\nAfrica, that one life is lost for every two that are taken captive and\r\nsold into slavery. If this is stealing, it has at least the merit of\r\nbeing more manly than some that is practiced among us.\r\n\r\nA case seems to have been preserved by the Holy Ghost, as if to rebuke\r\nthis abolition doctrine about property rights. It is the case of the\r\nKing of Ammon, a heathen, on the one side, and Jephtha, who \"obtained a\r\ngood report by faith,\" on the other. It is consoling to us that we\r\noccupy the ground Jephtha did--and we may well suspect the correctness\r\nof the other side, because it is the ground occupied by Ammon. The case\r\nis this: A heathen is seen menacing Israel. Jephtha is selected by his\r\ncountrymen to conduct the controversy. He sends a message to his\r\nmenacing neighbor, to know why he had come out against him. He returned\r\nfor answer, that it was because Israel held property to which they had\r\nno right. Jephtha answered, they had had it in possession for three\r\nhundred years. Ammon replied, they had no right to it, because it was\r\nobtained in the first instance by violence. Jephtha replied, that it was\r\nheld by the same sort of a title as that by which Ammon held his\r\npossessions--that is to say, whatever Ammon's god Chemosh enabled him to\r\ntake in war, he considered to be his of right; and that Israel's God\r\nhad assisted them to take this property, and they considered the title\r\nto be such an one as Ammon was bound to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nAmmon stickled for the _eternal_ principle of righteousness, and\r\ncontended that it had been violated in the first instance. But, reader,\r\nin the appeal made to the sword, God vindicated Israel's title.--Judges\r\nxi: 12-32.\r\n\r\nAnd if at the present time, we take ground with Ammon about the rights\r\nof property, I will not say how much work we may have to do, nor who\r\nwill prove the rightful owner of my correspondent's domicil; but certain\r\nI am, that by his Ammonitish principle of settling the rights of\r\nproperty, he will be ousted.\r\n\r\nReader, in looking over the printed reply of my correspondent to his\r\nSouthern friend, which occupies ten columns of a large newspaper, to see\r\nif I had overlooked any Scripture, I find I have omitted to notice one\r\nreference to the sacred volume, which was made by him, for the general\r\npurpose of showing that the Scriptures abound with moral principles, and\r\ncall into exercise moral feelings inconsistent with slavery. It is this:\r\n\"Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my\r\nbrethren, you have done it unto me.\" The design of the Saviour, in the\r\nparable from which these words are taken, in Matt. xxv, is, to impress\r\nstrongly upon the human mind, that _character_, deficient in _correct\r\nmoral feeling_, will prove fatal to human hopes in a coming day.\r\n\r\nBut, reader, will you stop and ask yourself, \"What is correct moral\r\nfeeling?\" Is it abhorrence and hatred to the will and pleasure of God?\r\nCertainly not. Then it is not abhorrence and hatred of slavery, which\r\nseems to be a cardinal virtue at the North. It has been the will and\r\npleasure of God to institute slavery by a law of his own, in that\r\nkingdom over which he immediately presided; and to give it his sanction\r\nwhen instituted by the laws of men. The most elevated morality is\r\nenjoined under both Testaments, upon the parties in this relation. There\r\nis nothing in the relation inconsistent with its exercise.\r\n\r\nMy reader will remember that the subject in dispute is, whether\r\ninvoluntary and hereditary slavery was ever lawful in the sight of God,\r\nthe Bible being judge.\r\n\r\n1. I have shown by the Bible, that God decreed this relation between the\r\nposterity of Canaan, and the posterity of Shem and Japheth.\r\n\r\n2. I have shown that God executed this decree by aiding the posterity\r\nof Shem, (at a time when \"they were holiness to the Lord,\") to enslave\r\nthe posterity of Canaan in the days of Joshua.\r\n\r\n3. I have shown that when God ratified the covenant of promise with\r\nAbraham, he recognized Abraham as the owner of slaves he had bought with\r\nhis money of the stranger, and recorded his approbation of the relation,\r\nby commanding Abraham to circumcise them.\r\n\r\n4. I have shown that when he took Abraham's posterity by the hand in\r\nEgypt, five hundred years afterward, he publicly approbated the same\r\nrelation, by permitting every slave they had bought with their money to\r\neat the Passover, while he refused the same privilege to their _hired\r\nservants_.\r\n\r\n5. I have shown that God, as their national law-giver, ordained by\r\nexpress statute, that they should buy slaves of the nations around them,\r\n(the seven devoted nations excepted,) and that these slaves and their\r\nincrease should be a perpetual inheritance to their children.\r\n\r\n6. I have shown that God ordained slavery by law for their captives\r\ntaken in war, while he guaranteed a successful issue to their wars, so\r\nlong as they obeyed him.\r\n\r\n7. I have shown that when Jesus ordered his gospel to be published\r\nthrough the world, the relation of master and slave existed by law in\r\nevery province and family of the Roman Empire, as it had done in the\r\nJewish commonwealth for fifteen hundred years.\r\n\r\n8. I have shown that Jesus ordained, that the legislative authority,\r\nwhich created this relation in that empire, should be obeyed and honored\r\nas an ordinance of God, as all government is declared to be.\r\n\r\n9. I have shown that Jesus has prescribed the mutual duties of this\r\nrelation in his kingdom.\r\n\r\n10. And lastly, I have shown, that in an attempt by his professed\r\nfollowers to disturb this relation in the Apostolic churches, Jesus\r\norders that fellowship shall be disclaimed with all such disciples, as\r\nseditious persons--whose conduct was not only dangerous to the State,\r\nbut destructive to the true character of the gospel dispensation.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, as will appear by the recorded language of the\r\nBible, to which we have referred you, reader, of what use is it to argue\r\nagainst it from moral requirements?\r\n\r\nThey regulate the duties of this and all other lawful relations among\r\nmen--but they cannot abolish any relation, ordained or sanctioned of\r\nGod, as is slavery.\r\n\r\nI would be understood as referring for proof of this summary, to my\r\nfirst as well as my present essay.\r\n\r\nWhen I first wrote, I did suppose the Scriptures had been examined by\r\nleading men in the opposition, and that prejudice had blinded their\r\neyes. I am now of a different opinion. What will be the effect of this\r\ndiscussion, I will not venture to predict, knowing human nature as well\r\nas I do. But men who are capable of exercising candor must see, that it\r\nis not against an institution unknown to the Bible, or declared by its\r\nauthor to be sinful, that the North is waging war.\r\n\r\nTheir hostility must be transferred from us to God, who established\r\nslavery by law in that kingdom over which he condescended to preside;\r\nand to Jesus, who recognized it as a relation established in Israel by\r\nhis Father, and in the Roman government by men, which he bound his\r\nfollowers to obey and honor.\r\n\r\nIn defending the institution as one which has the sanction of our Maker,\r\nI have done what I considered, under the peculiar circumstances of our\r\ncommon country, to be a Christian duty. I have set down naught in\r\nmalice. I have used no sophistry. I have brought to the investigation of\r\nthe subject, common sense. I have not relied on powers of argument,\r\nlearning, or ingenuity. These would neither put the subject into the\r\nBible nor take it out. It is a Bible question. I have met it fairly, and\r\nfully, according to the acknowledged principles of the abolitionists. I\r\nhave placed before my reader what is in the Bible, to prove that slavery\r\nhas the sanction of God, and is not sinful. I have placed before him\r\nwhat I suppose to be the quintessence of all that can be gleaned from\r\nthe Bible to disprove it.\r\n\r\nI have made a few plain reflections to aid the understanding of my\r\nreader. What I have written was designed for those who reverence the\r\nBible as their counsellor--who take it for rules of conduct, and\r\ndevotional sentiments.\r\n\r\nI now commit it to God for his blessing, with a fervent desire, that if\r\nI have mistaken his will in any thing, he will not suffer my error to\r\nmislead another.\r\n\r\n                                                THORNTON STRINGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n          [The following letter, in substance, was written\r\n          to a brother in Kentucky, who solicited a copy of\r\n          my slavery pamphlet, as well as my opinion on the\r\n          movement in that State, on the subject of\r\n          emancipation.]\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:--\r\n\r\nI received your letter, and the slavery pamphlet which you requested me\r\nto send you, I herewith inclose.\r\n\r\nWhen I published the first essay in that pamphlet, I intended to invite\r\na discussion with Elder Galusha, of New York; and when I received Mr.\r\nGalusha's letter to Dr. Fuller, I still expected a discussion. But after\r\nmanifesting, on his part, great pleasure in the outset, for the\r\nopportunity tendered him by a Southern man, to discuss this subject, he\r\nultimately declined it. This being the case, I did not at that time\r\npresent as full a view of the subject as the Scriptures furnish. I have\r\nsince thought of supplying this deficiency; and the condition of things\r\nin Kentucky furnishes a fit opportunity for saying to you, what I said\r\nto a brother in Pennsylvania, who, like yourself, requested me to send\r\nhim a copy of my pamphlet.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I could add any thing, beyond what I said to him,\r\nthat would be useful to you. To this brother I said, among other things,\r\nthat Dr. Wayland (in his discussion with Dr. Fuller,) relied principally\r\nupon _two arguments_, used by all the intelligent abolitionists, to\r\noverthrow the weight of Scriptural authority in support of slavery. The\r\nfirst of these arguments is designed to neutralize the sanction given to\r\nslavery by the law of Moses; and the second is designed to neutralize\r\nthe sanction given to slavery by the New Testament.\r\n\r\nThe Dr. frankly admits, that the law of Moses did establish slavery in\r\nthe Jewish commonwealth; and he admits with equal frankness, that it was\r\nincorporated as an element in the gospel church. For the purpose,\r\nhowever, of destroying the sanction thus given to the legality of the\r\nrelation under the _law of Moses_, he assumes two things in relation to\r\nit, which are expressly contradicted by the law. He assumes, in the\r\nfirst place, that the Almighty, under the law, gave a _special\r\npermission_ to the Israelites to enslave the seven devoted nations, as a\r\npunishment for their sins. He then _assumes_, in the second place, that\r\nthis _special permission_ to enslave the seven nations, prohibited, by\r\n_implication_, the enslaving of all other nations. The conclusion which\r\nthe Dr. draws from the above assumptions is this--that a _special\r\npermission_ under the law, to enslave a particular people, as a\r\npunishment for their sins, is not a _general permission_ under the\r\ngospel, to enslave all, or any other people. The premises here assumed,\r\nand from which this conclusion is drawn, are precisely the reverse of\r\nwhat is recorded in the Bible.\r\n\r\nThe Bible statement is this: that the Israelites under the law, so far\r\nfrom being permitted or required to enslave the seven nations, as a\r\npunishment for their sins, were expressly commanded to _destroy them\r\nutterly_. Here is the proof--Deut. vii: 1 and 2: \"When the Lord thy God\r\nshall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and\r\nhath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittities, and the\r\nGirgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites,\r\nand the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier\r\nthan thou; and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee,\r\nthou shalt smite them, _and utterly destroy them_, thou shalt make no\r\ncovenant with then, nor show mercy unto them.\" And again, in Deut. xx:\r\n16 and 17: \"But the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth\r\ngive thee for an inheritance, _thou shalt save alive nothing that\r\nbreatheth_. But thou shalt _utterly destroy them_, namely, the\r\nHittities, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the\r\nHivites, and the Jebusites, _as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee_.\"\r\nThis law was _delivered_ by Moses, and was _executed_ by Joshua some\r\nyears afterward, to the letter.\r\n\r\nHere is the proof of it, Josh. xi: 14 to 20 inclusive: \"And all the\r\nspoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a\r\nprey unto themselves; _but every man they smote with the edge of the\r\nsword until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_As the Lord commanded Moses_ his servant; so did Moses command Joshua,\r\nand _so did Joshua_; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord\r\ncommanded Moses. So Joshua took all that land, the hills and all the\r\nsouth country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley and the plain,\r\nand the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same. Even from the\r\nmount Halak that goeth up to Sier, even unto Baalgad, in the valley of\r\nLebanon, under mount Hermon, and all their kings he took, and smote\r\nthem, and slew them. Joshua made war a long time with all these kings.\r\nThere was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, _save\r\nthe Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon_, all others they took in battle.\r\nFor it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come\r\nagainst Israel in the battle, _that he might destroy them utterly_, and\r\nthat they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, _as the\r\nLord commanded Moses_.\" In this account of their _destruction_, the\r\nGibeonites, who deceived Joshua, are excepted, and the reason given is,\r\nthat Joshua in their case, failed to ask counsel at the mouth of the\r\nLord. Here is the proof: \"And the men took of them victuals, and asked\r\nnot counsel of the mouth of the Lord.\"--Josh. ix: 14. This counsel\r\nJoshua was expressly commanded to ask, when he was ordained some time\r\nbefore, to be the _executor_ of God's _legislative will_, by Moses. Here\r\nis the proof--Numb. xxvii: 18-23: \"And the Lord said unto Moses, Take\r\nthee Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thy\r\nhand upon him; and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the\r\ncongregation; and give him a charge in their sight. And thou shalt put\r\nsome of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children\r\nof Israel may be obedient. _And he shall stand before Eleazar the\r\npriest, who shall ask counsel for him, after the judgment of Urim before\r\nthe Lord: at his word shall they go out, and at his word shall they come\r\nin, both he and all the children of Israel with him, even all the\r\ncongregation._ And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and he took\r\nJoshua and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the\r\ncongregation. And he laid his hands upon him, _and gave him a charge, as\r\nthe Lord commanded by the hand of Moses_.\" These scriptures furnish a\r\npalpable contradiction of the first assumption, that is--that the Lord\r\ngave a _special permission to enslave_ the seven nations. The Lord\r\nordered that they should be destroyed utterly.\r\n\r\nAs to the second assumption, so far from the Israelites being prohibited\r\n_by implication_, from enslaving the subjects of other nations, they\r\nwere expressly authorized by the law _to make slaves by war, of any\r\nother nation_. Here is the proof--Deut. xx: 10 to 17 inclusive: \"When\r\nthou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace\r\nunto it. And it shall be if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto\r\nthee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein,\r\nshall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. And if it\r\nwill make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou\r\nshalt besiege it. And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thy\r\nhands, then shalt thou smite every male thereof with the edge of the\r\nsword. _But the women and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that\r\nis in the city_, even all the spoils thereof, shalt thou take unto\r\nthyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord\r\nthy God hath given thee. _Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which\r\nare very far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nations.\r\nBut of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee\r\nfor an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth. But\r\nthou shalt utterly destroy them, namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites,\r\nthe Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as\r\nthe Lord thy God hath commanded thee._\" They were authorized also by the\r\nlaw, to purchase slaves with money of any nation except the seven. Here\r\nis the proof--Levit. xxv: 44, 45, and 46: \"Both thy bond-men and thy\r\nbond-maids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are\r\nround about you; (that is, round about the country given them of God,\r\nwhich was the country of the seven nations they were soon to occupy;) of\r\nthem shall ye buy bond-men and bond-maids. Moreover, of the children of\r\nthe strangers that do sojourn among you, (that is, the mixed multitude\r\nof strangers which come up with them from Egypt, mentioned in Exod. xii:\r\n38,) of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,\r\nwhich they begat in your land; and they shall be your possession. And ye\r\nshall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to\r\ninherit them for a possession, they shall be your bond-men forever.\"\r\n\r\nNow, let it be noted that this first law, of Deut. xx: above referred\r\nto, which authorized them to make slaves by war of any other nation, was\r\nexecuted _for the first time_, under the direction of Moses himself,\r\nwhen thirty-two thousand of the Midianites were enslaved. These slaves\r\nwere not of the seven nations.\r\n\r\nAnd it is worthy of further remark, that of each half, into which the\r\nLord had these slaves divided, he claimed for his portion, one slave of\r\nevery five hundred for the priests, and one slave of every fifty for the\r\nLevites. These slaves he gave to the priests and Levites, who were his\r\nrepresentatives to be their property forever.--Numb. xxxi. These\r\nscriptures palpably contradict the Dr.'s second assumption--that is,\r\nthat they were _prohibited by implication_ from enslaving the subjects\r\nof any other nation. The Dr.'s assumptions being the antipodes of truth,\r\nthey cannot furnish a conclusion that is warranted by the truth.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion authorized by the truth, is this: that the making of\r\nslaves by war, and the purchase of slaves with money, was legalized by\r\nthe Almighty in the Jewish commonwealth, as regards the subject of _all\r\nnations except the seven_.\r\n\r\nThe second argument of the Dr.'s, as I remarked, is designed to\r\nneutralize the sanction given to slavery in the New Testament.\r\n\r\nThe Dr. frankly admits that slavery was sanctioned by the Apostles in\r\nthe Apostolic churches. But to neutralize this sanction, he resorts to\r\ntwo more assumptions, not only without proof, but palpably contradicted\r\nby the Old and New Testament text. The first assumption is this--_that\r\npolygamy and divorce were both sins under the law of Moses, although\r\nsanctioned by the law_. And the second assumption is, that polygamy and\r\ndivorce are _known to be sins under the gospel_, not by any gospel\r\nteaching or prohibition, but by the general principles of morality. From\r\nthese premises the conclusion is drawn, that although slavery was\r\nsanctioned in the Apostolic church, yet it was a sin, because, like\r\npolygamy and divorce, it was contrary to the principles of the moral\r\nlaw. The premises from which this conclusion is drawn, are at issue with\r\nthe word of God, and therefore the conclusion must be false. The first\r\nthing here assumed is, that polygamy and divorce, although sanctioned by\r\nthe law of Moses, were both sins under that law. Now, so far from this\r\nbeing true, as to _polygamy_, it is a fact that polygamy was not only\r\nsanctioned, when men chose to practice it, but it was expressly enjoined\r\nby the law in certain cases, and a most humiliating penalty annexed to\r\nthe breach of the command.--Deut. xxv: 5-9. As sin is defined by the\r\nHoly Ghost to be a transgression of the law, it is impossible that\r\n_polygamy_ could have been a sin under the law, unless it was a sin to\r\nobey the law, and an act of righteousness to transgress it. That\r\n_polygamy_ was a sin under the law, therefore, is palpably false.\r\n\r\nAs to _divorce_, the Almighty gave it the full and explicit sanction of\r\nhis authority, in the law of Moses, for various causes.--Deut. xxiv: 1.\r\nFor those causes, therefore, divorce could not have been a sin under\r\nthe law, unless human conduct, in exact accordance with the law of God,\r\nwas sinful. The first thing assumed by the Dr., therefore, that polygamy\r\nand divorce were both sins, under the law, is proved to be false. They\r\nwere lawful, and therefore, could not be sinful.\r\n\r\nThe Dr.'s second assumption (with respect to polygamy and divorce,) is\r\nthis, that they are _known_ under the gospel to be sins, not by the\r\nprohibitory _precepts_ of the gospel, but by the general _principles_ of\r\nmorality. This assumption is certainly a very astonishing one--for Jesus\r\nChrist in one breath has uttered language as perfectly subversive of all\r\nauthority for polygamy and divorce in his kingdom, as light is\r\nsubversive of darkness. The Pharisees, ever desirous of exposing him to\r\nthe prejudices and passions of the people, \"asked him in the presence of\r\ngreat multitudes, who came with him from Galilee into the coasts of\r\nJudea beyond Jordan,\" whether he admitted, with Moses, the legality of\r\ndivorce for every cause. Their object was to provoke him to the exercise\r\nof legislative authority; to whom he promptly replied, that God made man\r\nat the beginning, male and female, and ordained that the male and female\r\nby marriage, should be one flesh. And for satisfactory reasons, had\r\nsanctioned divorce among Abraham's seed; and then adds, as a law-giver,\r\n\"But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, (except for\r\nfornication,) and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and if a\r\nwoman put away her husband, and marry again, she committeth adultery.\"\r\nHere polygamy and divorce die together. The law of Christ is, that\r\n_neither_ party shall put the other away--that _either_ party, taking\r\nanother companion, while the first companion lives, is guilty of\r\nadultery--consequently, polygamy and divorce are prohibited forever,\r\nunless this law is violated--and that violation is declared to be\r\nadultery, which excludes from his kingdom.--1 Cor. vi: 9. After the\r\nchurch was organized, the Holy Ghost, by Paul, _commands_, let not the\r\nwife depart from her husband, but, and if she depart let her remain\r\nunmarried--and let not the husband put away his wife.--1 Cor. vii: 10.\r\nHere _divorce_ is prohibited by _both parties_; a second marriage\r\naccording to Christ, would be adultery, while the first companion lives;\r\nconsequently, _polygamy_ is prohibited also.\r\n\r\nThis second assumption, therefore, that polygamy and divorce are known\r\nto be sins by _moral principles_ and _not by prohibitory precepts_, is\r\nswept away by the words of Christ, and the teaching of the Holy Ghost.\r\nThese unauthorized and dangerous assumptions are the foundation, upon\r\nwhich the abolition structure is made to rest by the distinguished Dr.\r\nWayland.\r\n\r\nThe facts with respect to polygamy and divorce, warrant precisely the\r\nopposite conclusion; that is, that if slavery under the gospel is\r\nsinful, then its sinfulness would have been made known by the gospel, as\r\nhas been done with respect to polygamy and divorce. All three, polygamy,\r\ndivorce and slavery, were _sanctioned_ by the law of Moses. But under\r\nthe gospel, slavery has been _sanctioned_ in the church, while polygamy\r\nand divorce have been _excluded_ from the church. It is manifest,\r\ntherefore, that under the gospel, polygamy and divorce have been made\r\nsins, _by prohibition_, while slavery remains lawful because\r\n_sanctioned_ and _continued_. The _lawfulness_ of slavery under the\r\ngospel, rests upon the sovereign pleasure of Christ, in _permitting it_;\r\nand the _sinfulness_ of polygamy and divorce, upon his sovereign\r\npleasure in _prohibiting_ their continuance. The law of Christ gives to\r\nthe relation of slavery its full sanction. _That law_ is to be found,\r\nfirst, in the _admission_, _by the apostles_, of slaveholders and their\r\nslaves into the gospel church; second, in the _positive injunction_ by\r\nthe Holy Ghost, of obedience on the part of Christian slaves in this\r\nrelation, to their believing masters; third, in the _absence_ of any\r\ninjunction upon the believing master, under any circumstances, to\r\ndissolve this relation; fourth, in the _absence_ of any instruction from\r\nChrist or the apostles, that the relation is sinful; and lastly, in the\r\n_injunction_ of the Holy Ghost, delivered by Paul, _to withdraw_ from\r\nall such as teach that this relation is sinful. Human conduct in exact\r\naccordance with the law of Christ thus proclaimed, and thus expounded by\r\nthe Holy Ghost, in the conduct and teaching of the apostles, cannot be\r\nsinful.\r\n\r\nThere are other portions of God's word, in the light of which we may add\r\nto our stock of knowledge on this subject. For instance, the Almighty by\r\nMoses legalized marriage between female slaves and Abraham's male\r\ndescendants. But under this law the wife remained a slave still. If she\r\nbelonged to the husband, then this law gave freedom to her children; but\r\nif she belonged to another man, then her children, though born in lawful\r\nwedlock, were hereditary slaves.--Exod. xxi: 4. Again, if a man marries\r\nhis own slave, then he lost the right to sell her--if he divorced her,\r\nthen she gained her freedom.--Deut. xxi: 10 to 14, inclusive. Again,\r\nthere was a law from God which granted rights to Abraham's sons under a\r\nmatrimonial contract; for a violation of the rights conferred by this\r\nlaw, a _free woman, and her seducer_, forfeited their lives, Deut. xxii:\r\n23 and 24; also 13 to 21, inclusive. But for the same offense, _a slave_\r\nonly exposed herself to stripes, and her _seducer_ to the penalty of a\r\nsheep.--Levit. xix: 20 to 22, inclusive. Again, there was a law which\r\nguarded his people, whether free or bond, from personal violence. If in\r\nvindictiveness, a man with an unlawful weapon, maimed his own slave by\r\nknocking out his eye, or his tooth, the slave was to be free for this\r\nwanton act of personal violence, as a penalty upon the master.--Exod.\r\nxxi: 26 to 27, inclusive. But for the same offense, committed against a\r\nfree person, the offender had to pay an eye for an eye, and a tooth for\r\na tooth, as the penalty.--Levit. xxiv: 19, 20, and Exod. xxi: 24 and 25,\r\ninclusive. Again, there was a law to guard the personal safety of the\r\ncommunity against dangerous stock. If an ox, known to be dangerous, was\r\nsuffered to run at large and kill a person, if the person so killed _was\r\nfree_, then the owner forfeited his _life_ for his neglect,--Exod. xxi:\r\n29. But if the person so killed _was a slave_, then the offender was\r\nfined thirty shekels of silver.--Exod. xxi: 32. In some things, slaves\r\namong the Israelites, as among us, were invested with privileges above\r\nhired servants--they were privileged to eat the Passover, but hired\r\nservants were not, Exod. xii: 44, 45; and such as were owned by the\r\npriests and Levites were privileged to eat of the holy things of their\r\nmasters, but hired servants dare not taste them.--Levit. xxii: 10, 11.\r\nThese are statutes from the Creator of man. They are certainly\r\npredicated upon a view of things, in the Divine mind, that is _somewhat\r\ndifferent_ from that which makes an abolitionist; and, to say the least,\r\nthey deserve consideration with all men who worship the God of the\r\nBible, and not the God of their own imagination. They show very clearly,\r\nthat our Creator is the _author_ of social, moral, and political\r\ninequality among men. That so far from the Scriptures teaching, as\r\nabolitionists do, that all men have ever had a divine right to freedom\r\nand equality, they show, _in so many words_, that marriages were\r\nsanctioned of God as lawful, in which _he enacted_, that the children of\r\nfree men should be born hereditary slaves. They show also, that he\r\nguarded the chastity of the free by the price of life, and the chastity\r\nof the slave by the rod. They show, that in the judgment of God, the\r\nlife of a free man in the days of Moses, was too sacred for commutation,\r\nwhile a fine of thirty shekels of silver was sufficient to expiate for\r\nthe death of a slave. As I said in my first essay, so I say now, this is\r\na controversy between abolitionists and their Maker. I see not how, with\r\ntheir present views and in their present temper, they can stop short of\r\nblasphemy against that Being who enacted these laws.\r\n\r\nOf late years, some obscure passages (which have no allusion whatever to\r\nthe subject) have been brought forward to show, that God _hated\r\nslavery_, although the work of his own hands. Once for all, I challenge\r\nproof, that in the Old Testament or the New, _any reproof was ever\r\nuttered against involuntary slavery, or against any abuse of its\r\nauthority_. Upon abolition principles, this is perfectly unaccountable,\r\nand of itself, is an unanswerable argument that the _relation_ is not\r\nsinful.\r\n\r\nThe opinion has been announced also of late, that slavery among the Jews\r\nwas felt to be an evil, and, by degrees, that they abolished it. To\r\nascertain the correctness of this opinion, let the following\r\nconsideration be weighed: After centuries of cruel _national bondage_\r\npracticed upon Abraham's seed in Egypt, they were brought in godly\r\ncontrition to pour out \"the effectual fervent prayer\" of a righteous\r\npeople, to the Almighty for mercy, and were answered by a covenant God,\r\nwho sent Moses to deliver them from their bondage--but let it be\r\nremembered, that when this deliverance from bondage to the nation of\r\nEgypt was vouchsafed to them, they were extensive domestic slave owners.\r\nGod had not by his providential dealings, nor in any other way, shown\r\nthem the sin of domestic slavery--for they held on to their slaves, and\r\nbrought them out as their property into the wilderness. And it is worthy\r\nof further remark, that the Lord, _before they left Egypt_, recognized\r\nthese slaves _as property_, which they had bought with their money, and\r\nthat he secured to these slaves privileges above hired servants, _simply\r\nbecause they were slaves_.--Exod. xii: 44, 45. And let it be noticed\r\nfurther, that the first law passed by the Almighty after proclaiming the\r\nten commandments or moral constitution of the nation, was a law to\r\nregulate property rights in hereditary slaves, and to regulate property\r\nrights in Jewish hired servants for a term of years.--Exod. xxi: 1 to 6,\r\ninclusive. And let it be considered further, that when the Israelites\r\nwere subjected to a cruel captivity in Babylon, more than eight hundred\r\nyears after this, they were still extensive slave owners; that when\r\nhumbled and brought to repentance for their sins, and the Lord restored\r\nthem to their own land again, that he brought them back to their old\r\nhomes as slave owners. Although greatly impoverished by a seventy years'\r\ncaptivity in a foreign land, yet the slaves which they brought up from\r\nBabylon bore a proportion of nearly one slave for every five free\r\npersons that returned, or about one slave for every family.--Ezra ii:\r\n64, 65. Now, can we, in the face of these facts, believe they were tired\r\nof slavery when they came out of Egypt? It had then existed five hundred\r\nyears. Or can we believe they were tired of it when they came up from\r\nBabylon? It had then existed among them fourteen hundred years. Or can\r\nwe believe that God put them into these schools of affliction in Egypt\r\nand Babylon to teach them, (and all others through them,) the sinfulness\r\nof slavery, and yet, that he brought them out without giving them the\r\nfirst hint that involuntary slavery was a sin? And let it be further\r\nconsidered, that it was the business of the prophets which the Lord\r\nraised up, _to make known to them the sins for which his judgments were\r\nsent upon them_. The sins which he charged upon them in all his\r\nvisitation are upon record. Let any man find involuntary slavery in any\r\nof God's indictments against them, and I will retract all I have ever\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nIn my original essay, I said nothing of Paul's letter to Philemon,\r\nconcerning Onesimus, a run-away slave, converted by Paul's preaching at\r\nRome; and who was returned by the Apostle, with a most affectionate\r\nletter to his master, entreating the master to receive him again, and to\r\nforgive him. O, how immeasurably different Paul's conduct to this slave\r\nand his master, from the conduct of our abolition brethren! Which are we\r\nto think is guided by the Spirit of God? It is _impossible_ that both\r\ncan be guided by that Spirit, unless sweet water and bitter can come\r\nfrom the same fountain. This letter, itself, is sufficient to teach any\r\nman, capable of being taught in the ordinary way, that slavery is not,\r\n_in the sight of God, what it is in the sight of the abolitionists_.\r\n\r\nI had prepared the argument furnished by this letter for my original\r\nessay; I afterward struck it out, because at that time, so little had\r\nthe Bible been examined at the North in reference to slavery, that the\r\nabolitionists very generally thought that this was the only scripture\r\nwhich Southern slaveholders could find, giving any countenance to their\r\nviews of slavery. To test the correctness of this opinion, therefore, I\r\ndetermined to make no allusion to it at that time.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear sir, if from the evidence contained in the Bible to prove\r\nslavery a lawful relation among God's people under every dispensation,\r\nthe assertion is still made, in the very face of this evidence, that\r\nslavery has _ever been_ the greatest sin--_everywhere, and under all\r\ncircumstances_--can you, or can any sane man bring himself to believe,\r\nthat the mind capable of such a decision, is not capable of trampling\r\nthe word of God under foot upon any subject?\r\n\r\nIf it were not known to be the fact, we could not admit that a\r\nBible-reading man could bring himself to believe, with Dr. Wayland, that\r\na thing made lawful by the God of heaven, was, notwithstanding, the\r\ngreatest sin--and that Moses under the law, and Jesus Christ under the\r\ngospel, had sanctioned and regulated in practice, the greatest known sin\r\non earth--and that Jesus had left his church to find out as best they\r\nmight, that the law of God which established slavery under the Old\r\nTestament, and the precepts of the Holy Ghost which regulate the mutual\r\nduty of master and slave under the New Testament, were laws and\r\nprecepts, to sanction and regulate among the people of God the greatest\r\nsin which was ever perpetrated.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means strange that it should have taken seventeen centuries\r\nto make such discoveries as the above, and it is worthy of note, that\r\nthese discoveries were made at last by men who did not appear to know,\r\nat the time they made them, what was in the Bible on the subject of\r\nslavery, and who now appear unwilling that the teachings of the Bible\r\nshould be spread before the people--this last I take to be the case,\r\nbecause I have been unable to get the Northern press to give it\r\npublicity.\r\n\r\nMany anti-slavery men into whose hands my essays chanced to fall, have\r\nfrankly confessed to me, that in their Bible reading, they had\r\noverlooked the plain teaching of the Holy Ghost, by taking what they\r\nread in the Bible about masters and servants, to have reference to hired\r\nservants and their employers.\r\n\r\nYou ask me for my opinion about the emancipation movement in the State\r\nof Kentucky. I hold that the emancipation of hereditary slaves by a\r\nState is not commanded, or in any way required by the Bible. The Old\r\nTestament and the New, sanction slavery, but under no circumstances\r\nenjoin its abolition, even among saints. Now, if religion, or the duty\r\nwe owe our Creator, was inconsistent with slavery, then this could not\r\nbe so. If pure religion, therefore, did not require its abolition under\r\nthe law of Moses, nor in the church of Christ--we may safely infer, that\r\nour political, moral and social relations do not require it in a State;\r\nunless a State requires higher moral, social, and religious qualities in\r\nits subjects, than a gospel church.\r\n\r\nMasters have been left by the Almighty, both under the patriarchal,\r\nlegal, and gospel dispensations, to their individual discretion on the\r\nsubject of emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe principle of justice inculcated by the Bible, refuses to sanction,\r\nit seems to me, such an outrage upon the rights of men, as would be\r\nperpetrated by any sovereign State, which, to-day, makes a thing to be\r\nproperty, and to-morrow, takes it from the lawful owners, _without\r\npolitical necessity or pecuniary compensation_. Now, if it be morally\r\nright for a majority of the people (and that majority possibly a meagre\r\none, who may not own a slave) to take, without necessity or\r\ncompensation, the property in slaves held by a minority, (and that\r\nminority a large one,) then it would be morally right for a majority,\r\nwithout property, to take any thing else that may be lawfully owned by\r\nthe prudent and care-taking portion of the citizens.\r\n\r\nAs for intelligent philanthropy, it shudders at the infliction of\r\ncertain ruin upon a whole race of helpless beings. If emancipation by\r\nlaw is philanthropic in Kentucky, it is, for the same reasons,\r\nphilanthropic in every State in the Union. But nothing in the future is\r\nmore certain, than that such emancipation would begin to work the\r\ndegradation and final ruin of the slave race, from the day of its\r\nconsummation.\r\n\r\nBreak the master's sympathy, which is inseparably connected with his\r\nproperty right in his slave, and that moment the slave race is placed\r\nupon a common level with all other competitors for the rewards of merit;\r\nbut as the slaves are inferior in the qualities which give success among\r\ncompetitors in our country, extreme poverty would be their lot; and for\r\nthe want of means to rear families, they would multiply slowly, and die\r\nout by inches, degraded by vice and crime, unpitied by honest and\r\nvirtuous men, and heart-broken by sufferings without a parallel.\r\n\r\nSo long as States let masters alone on this subject, good men among\r\nthem, both in the church and out of it, will struggle on, as experience\r\nmay dictate and justify, for the benefit of the slave race. And should\r\nthe time ever come, when emancipation in its consequences, will comport\r\nwith the moral, social, and political obligations of Christianity, then\r\nChristian masters will invest their slaves with freedom, and then will\r\nthe good-will of those follow the descendants of Ham, who, without any\r\nagency of their own, have been made in this land of liberty, their\r\nprovidential guardians.\r\n\r\n          Yours, with affection,\r\n          THORNTON STRINGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n          [It is or ought to be known to all men, that\r\n          African slavery in the United States originated\r\n          in, and is perpetuated by a social and political\r\n          necessity, and that its continuance is demanded\r\n          equally by the highest interests of both races.\r\n          All writers on public law, from Drs. Channing and\r\n          Wayland, among the abolitionists, up to the\r\n          highest authorities on national law, admit the\r\n          necessity and propriety of slavery in a social\r\n          body, whenever men will not provide for their own\r\n          wants, and yield obedience to the law which guards\r\n          the rights of others.

In a late communication you[231] refer to _this\r\nessay_, and express a wish that it should be republished. Many have\r\nexpressed a similar wish.\r\n\r\nSome who admit the _legality_ of slavery in the sight of God, question\r\nthe _expediency of its expansion_. It is believed by them to be an\r\nelement that is hostile to the best interests of society, and therefore,\r\ngreat efforts have been, and are now being made, to exclude it from all\r\nthe new States and Territories which may hereafter be organized upon our\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nWhile the _expediency_ of its _expansion_ or _continuance_, are\r\nquestions with which I have not heretofore meddled, yet I hold their\r\n_investigation_ to be within the legitimate range of Christian duty.\r\n\r\nIf unquestionable _facts_ and _experience_ warrant the _conclusion_,\r\nthat while slavery is lawful, yet its _continuance_ or _expansion_ among\r\nus is _inexpedient_, then let us act accordingly.\r\n\r\nBeing _prompted_ by your request, I propose to examine _facts_, which\r\nare admitted the world over, as evidence of prosperity and happiness\r\nin a community, and to compare the evidence thus furnished in\r\ndifferent sections of our country, where the experiment of freedom,\r\nand the experiment of slavery have been fully and fairly upon trial\r\nsince the commencement of our colonial existence, that we may see,\r\nif possible, what is true on this subject. This seems to be the\r\n_unerring_ method of coming at the truth. And if it shall appear, by\r\nsuch a comparison--fairly made--between States of equal age, where\r\nslavery and freedom have had a fair opportunity to produce their\r\nlegitimate results, that in all the elements of prosperity, slaveholding\r\nStates suffer nothing in the comparison--but that, in almost every\r\nparticular, are decidedly in advance of the non-slaveholding States,\r\nwhy then we are bound to let the testimony of these facts control our\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nEvery man and woman in the United States should not only be willing, but\r\ndesirous to know, what is the matter-of-fact evidence on this\r\nall-absorbing question. It is but lately that any method existed, of\r\ncoming at _undisputed_ facts, which would throw light upon this subject.\r\nThe Congress of the United States seeing this, thought proper to order\r\nthat such facts as tend to demonstrate the relative prosperity of the\r\ndifferent States of the Union, in religion--in morals--in the\r\nacquisition of wealth--in the increase of native population--in the\r\nprolongation of life--in the diminution of crime, etc., etc., should be\r\nascertained, under oath, by competent and responsible agents, and that\r\nthese facts should be published at the national expense for the benefit\r\nof the people: so that the people could, understandingly, apply the\r\ncorrective for evils that might be found to exist in one locality, and\r\nprofit by a knowledge of the greater prosperity that might be found to\r\nexist in another locality.\r\n\r\nUp to that time, the non-slaveholding States affirmed, and the\r\nslaveholding States tacitly admitted, that by this test, the\r\nslaveholding States must suffer in the comparison, in some important\r\nitems. The facts which belong to the subject, are now before the world,\r\nin the census of 1850.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to compare some of the most important of these facts,\r\nwhich have a bearing on this subject. I shall take for the most part,\r\nthe six New England States, on one side, and the five old slave States,\r\n(extending from, and including Maryland and Georgia,) on the other side,\r\nfor the comparison.\r\n\r\nI select _these States_, not because they are the richest, (for they are\r\nnot,) but because they all lie on the Atlantic side of the\r\nUnion--because they were settled at or near the same time--because they\r\nhave (within a fraction) an equal free population--and because it has\r\nbeen constantly affirmed, and almost universally admitted, that the\r\nadvantages of freedom, and the disadvantages of slavery, have been more\r\nperfectly developed in these two sections, than they have been anywhere\r\nelse in the United States. There have been no controlling circumstances\r\nat any time, since their first settlement, to neutralize the advantages\r\nof freedom on the one side, or to modify the evils of slavery on the\r\nother. Their mutual tendencies, without let or hindrance, have been in\r\nfull and free operation for more than two centuries. This is surely a\r\nlength of time quite sufficient to test the question now in controversy\r\nbetween the North and the South, as to the evils of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe first facts I shall examine are those which throw light on the\r\nprogress made in each of these two localities in religion. Of all the\r\nevils ascribed to slavery by the free men of the North, none equals, in\r\ntheir estimation, its deleterious tendency upon _religion_ and _morals_.\r\nIndeed, such is the _moral character_, ascribed by many at the North,\r\nwho call themselves Christians, to a Southern slaveholder, that no\r\ndegree of personal piety, of which he can be the subject, will bring\r\nthem to admit that he is any thing but a God-abhorred miscreant, utterly\r\nunfit for the association of honorable men, much less Christian men.\r\n\r\nIn the outset of this examination, let me remark, that it is just and\r\nproper, in a comparative estimate of the tendency of freedom and slavery\r\nupon religion and morals, in these two sections of our country, that due\r\nallowance be made for the moral and religious character of the materials\r\nby which these two sections were originally settled. New England was\r\nsettled by Puritans, who were remarkable for orthodox sentiments in\r\nreligion--for high-toned religious conscientiousness, and a rigid\r\npersonal piety; while these five slave States were either settled, or\r\nreceived character from Cavaliers, who rather scoffed at pure religion,\r\nand were highly tinged with infidelity.\r\n\r\nThe stream does not, in its flow onward, carry with more certainty the\r\ncharacteristics of the fountain, than does progressive society,\r\n_generally_, the moral, social, and religious characteristics of its\r\norigin. The five slave States, in this comparison originated in a people\r\nof loose morals--strongly tinged with infidelity--and subjected, also,\r\nin their onward progress, to all the evil tendencies (if any there be)\r\nthat are ascribed to slavery.\r\n\r\nAt the end of more than two centuries, we are comparing the progress\r\nwhich these five slave States have made in religion, with the progress\r\nmade by six non-slaveholding States, whose subjects, when originally\r\norganized into communities, were in advance, in personal piety and\r\nreligious conscientiousness, of any communities that had then been\r\nfounded since the days of the apostles--and that have been, in their\r\nonward progress, from that time until this, free from all the supposed\r\nevils of slavery. If infidelity and slavery be antagonistic elements,\r\nalmost, if not altogether, too strong for moral control in a community,\r\nit certainly ought not to seem strange, that with this original odds\r\nagainst them, these five old slave States should be found very far\r\nbehind their more highly favoured Northern neighbors in religious\r\nattainments.\r\n\r\nReligion being, at present, the subject of comparison, it may be\r\nappropriate to remark further, that the _Christian religion_ is\r\npropagated by God's blessing upon the observance of his laws.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental law of God, _for its propagation_ requires the gospel to\r\nbe preached to every creature; because, in the divine plan, faith in the\r\ngospel was to make men Christians. The gospel was to be made the _power\r\nof God_ unto salvation, to every one that _believeth_. _This faith_ was\r\nto be originated by hearing the gospel, for \"faith comes by hearing.\"\r\nAll those efforts, therefore, in a community, which manifests the\r\ngreatest solicitude on the part of the people, that the gospel should be\r\n_heard_, is credible evidence that the people who make these efforts,\r\nare the friends of Christ, and well-wishers to his cause. Now, all those\r\n_means_ which are most likely to secure the ear of the people, are left\r\nby Christ to the _discretion_ of his friends. They may use the\r\nmarket-place--the highways--the forests--or _any other place_, which in\r\ntheir judgment is most likely to get the ear of the people when the\r\ngospel is proclaimed. By common consent, however, within the limits of\r\nChristian civilization, they have agreed that suitable houses, in which\r\nthe people can meet to hear the gospel, are the most suitable and proper\r\nmeans for securing the audience of the people, and as a consequence, the\r\ntransforming power of the gospel upon the hearts and lives of those who\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nWith these views to guide us in estimating the value of the facts to be\r\nexamined, we proceed to disclosures made by the census of 1850. We there\r\nlearn that the free population of New England is two million seven\r\nhundred and twenty-eight thousand and sixteen; and that the free\r\npopulation of these five slave States is two million seven hundred and\r\nthirty thousand two hundred and fourteen; an excess of only two thousand\r\none hundred and ninety-eight. This fraction we will drop out, and speak\r\nof them as equals. New England, then, with an equal population, has\r\nerected four thousand six hundred and seven churches; these five slave\r\nStates have erected eight thousand and eighty-one churches. These New\r\nEngland churches will accommodate one million eight hundred and\r\nninety-three thousand four hundred and fifty hearers; the churches of\r\nthe five slave States will accommodate two million eight hundred and\r\nninety-six thousand four hundred and seventy-two hearers. Thus we see\r\nthat these slave States, with an equal free population, have erected\r\nnearly double the number of churches, and furnished accommodation for\r\nupwards of a million more persons, to hear the gospel, than can be\r\naccommodated in New England. In New England, nine hundred and\r\nthirty-four thousand, five hundred and sixty-six of its population\r\n(which is nearly one-third) are excluded from a seat in houses built for\r\nthe purpose of enabling people to hear the gospel; while in these five\r\nSouthern States, there is room enough for every hearer that could be\r\ncrowded into the churches of New England, and then enough left to\r\naccommodate more than a million of slaves.\r\n\r\nIncluding slaves, these five Southern States have a population of seven\r\nhundred and twenty thousand four hundred and ten more than New England;\r\nyet while there are seven hundred and twenty thousand four hundred and\r\nten persons less in New England to provide for, there are two hundred\r\nthousand more persons in New England who can't find a seat in the house\r\nof God to hear the gospel, than there are in these five slave States.\r\n\r\nThe next fact set forth in the census, which I will examine, is equally\r\n_suggestive_. These four thousand six hundred and seven churches in New\r\nEngland are valued at nineteen million three hundred and sixty-two\r\nthousand six hundred and thirty-four dollars. These eight thousand and\r\neighty-one churches in the five slave States are valued at eleven\r\nmillion one hundred and forty-nine thousand one hundred and eighteen\r\ndollars. Here is an immense expenditure in New England to erect\r\nchurches; yet we see that those New England churches, when erected, will\r\nseat one million three thousand and twenty-two persons less than those\r\nerected by the slave States, at a cost of eight million one hundred and\r\nthirteen thousand five hundred and sixteen dollars less money. What\r\nprompted to such an expenditure as this? Was it worldly pride? or was it\r\ngodly humility? Does it exhibit the evidence of humility, and a desire\r\nto glorify God, by a provision that shall enable _all the people_ to\r\nhear the gospel? or does it exhibit the evidence of pride, that seeks to\r\nglorify the wealthy contributors, who occupy these costly temples to the\r\nexclusion of the humble poor? We must all draw our own conclusions. A\r\nmite, given to God from a right spirit, was declared by the Saviour to\r\nbe more than all the costly gifts of wealthy pride, which were cast into\r\nthe offerings of God. The Saviour informed the messenger of John the\r\nBaptist, that _one of the signs_ by which to decide the _presence_ of\r\nthe Messiah, was to be found in the fact that the poor had the gospel\r\npreached to them. When we exclude the poor, we may safely conclude we\r\nexclude Christ.\r\n\r\nIt is legitimate to conclude, therefore, that all the arrangements found\r\namong a people, which palpably defeat the preaching of the gospel to the\r\npoor, are arrangements which throw a shade of deep suspicion upon the\r\ncharacter of those who make them. _Costly palaces_ were never built for\r\nthe poor; they are neither suitable nor proper to secure the preaching\r\nof the gospel to every creature.\r\n\r\nThere is still another fact revealed in the census, that furnishes\r\nmaterial for reflection when the effects of slavery upon religion are\r\nbeing tried. The six New England States were originally settled by\r\n_orthodox_ Christians--by men who manifested a very high regard for the\r\ninterests of pure religion; the five slave States, by men who scoffed at\r\nreligion, and who were subjected, also, to the so-called curse of\r\nslavery; yet, at the end of over two hundred years, we have to deduct\r\nfrom the four thousand six hundred and seven churches built up by New\r\nEngland orthodoxy and freedom, the _astonishing number_ of two hundred\r\nand two Unitarian, and two hundred and eighty-five Universalist\r\nchurches--while from the five slave States, we have to deduct from the\r\neight thousand and eighty-one churches which they have built, only one\r\nUnitarian, and seven Universalist churches. New England regards these\r\nfour hundred and eighty-seven churches, which she has built, to be the\r\nproduct of _blind guides_, that are _leaders of the blind_. Is it not\r\nstrange (she herself being judge) that New England orthodoxy and\r\npersonal freedom should beget this vast amount of infidelity; while\r\nslaveholders and slavery have begotten so little of it in the same\r\nlength of time? Is there nothing in all this to render the correctness\r\nof Northern views questionable, as to the deleterious tendency of\r\nslavery? The facts, however, are given to the world in the census of\r\n1850. All are left to draw from these facts their own conclusions. One\r\nof these conclusions must be, that there is something else in the world\r\nto corrupt religion and morals, besides slaveholders and slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is not improper to refer to some historical facts in this connection,\r\nwhich are not in the census, but which, nevertheless, we all know to\r\nexist. There are _isms_ at the North whose name is Legion. According to\r\nthe universal standard of _orthodoxy_, we are compelled to exclude the\r\n_subjects_ of these isms from the pale of Christianity. What the\r\nrelative proportion is, North and South, of such of these isms as have\r\nbeen nurtured into _organized_ existence, we have no certain means of\r\nknowing--and I do not wish to do injustice, or to be offensive, in\r\nstatements which are not susceptible of proof by facts and figures--yet,\r\nI suppose that in the five slave States, a man might wear himself out in\r\ntravel, and never find one of these isms with an _organized_ existence.\r\nTo find a single individual, would be doing more than most men have\r\ndone, with whom I am acquainted. But how is it in New England? The soil\r\nseems to suit them--they grow up like Jonah's gourd. Some are warring\r\nwith great zeal against the social, and some against the religious\r\ninstitutions of society. Why is this? The institution of slavery has not\r\nproduced, at the North, the moral obliquity, out of which they grow--a\r\nreverence for the Bible has not produced it. How is their existence,\r\nthen, to be accounted for at the North, under institutions, whose\r\ntendency is supposed to be so favorable to moral and religious\r\nprosperity? And how is their utter absence to be accounted for at the\r\nSouth, where the institution of slavery is supposed to be so fatal to\r\nmorality, religion and virtue? I will leave it for others to explain\r\nthis fact. It is a mysterious fact, according to the modes of reasoning\r\nat the North. It is assumed by the North, that slavery tends to produce\r\nsocial, moral, and religious evils. This assumption is flatly\r\ncontradicted by the facts of the census. These facts can never be\r\nexplained by the _New England theory_. There was an _ancient theory_,\r\nheld by men who were righteous in their own eyes, that no good thing\r\ncould come out of Nazareth. By that theory Christ himself was condemned.\r\nIt is not wonderful, therefore, that his friends should share the same\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThe next disclosure of the census, which we will compare, are those\r\nwhich relate to the social prosperity of a people. Are they wealthy? are\r\nthey healthy? are they in conditions to raise families, etc.?\r\n\r\nThese questions indicate the _elements_ which belong to the item now to\r\nbe examined. States are made up of families. Wealth is a blessing in\r\nthose States which have it so distributed, as to give the greatest\r\nnumber of homes to the families which compose them. Wealth, so\r\ndistributed in States, as to diminish the number of homes, is a curse to\r\nthe families which compose them. Home is the nursery and shield of\r\nvirtue. No right-minded man or woman, who had the means, could ever\r\nconsent to have a family without a home; and no State should make wealth\r\nher boast, whose families are extensively without homes.\r\n\r\nNew England has five hundred and eighteen thousand five hundred and\r\nthirty-two families, and four hundred and forty-seven thousand seven\r\nhundred and eighty-nine dwellings. The five slave States have five\r\nhundred and six thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight families, and four\r\nhundred and ninety-six thousand three hundred and sixty-nine dwellings.\r\nHere we see the astonishing fact, that with an equal population, New\r\nEngland has eleven thousand five hundred and sixty-four more families\r\nthan these five slave States, and that these five slave States have\r\nforty-eight thousand five hundred and eighty more dwellings than New\r\nEngland--so that New England actually has seventy thousand seven hundred\r\nand forty-three families without a home. In New England one family in\r\nevery _seven_ is without a home, while in these five old slave States\r\nonly one family in every _fifty-two_ is without a home.\r\n\r\nAccording to the average number of persons composing a family, New\r\nEngland has three hundred and seventy-three thousand seven hundred of\r\nher people thrown upon the world without a place to call home.\r\n\r\nIt is truly painful to think of the effects upon morals and virtue,\r\nwhich must flow from this state of things; and it is a pleasure to a\r\nphilanthropic heart to think of the superior condition of the\r\nslaveholding people, who so generally have homes, where parents can\r\nthrow the shield of protection around their offspring, and guard them\r\nagainst the dangers and demoralizing tendencies of an unprotected\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of facts, equally astonishing, disclosed by the\r\ncensus, and which belong to the comparison we are now making, between\r\nStates which were organized originally by Puritan orthodoxy and New\r\nEngland freedom on one side, and by infidel slaveholders and slavery on\r\nthe other. They are facts which relate to natural increase in a State.\r\nOne of the boasts of Northern freemen is the _increase_ of their\r\npopulation. With such a climate as New England, it was to be expected\r\nthat the people would increase faster, and live longer, than in the\r\nclimate of these five slave States. It is well known that a large\r\nportion of the population of these five Southern States have a fatal\r\nclimate to contend with, and that everywhere else on the globe, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, a diminished increase of births, and an increased\r\namount of deaths has been the result. But the census, as if disregarding\r\nclimate, and slavery, and the universal experience of all ages,\r\ntestifies that there is twenty-seven per cent. more of births, and\r\nthirty-three per cent. less of deaths in the five old slave States, than\r\nthere is in the six New England States.\r\n\r\nNew England, with an equal population, and eleven thousand five hundred\r\nand sixty-four more families, has sixteen thousand five hundred and\r\nthirty-four less annual births, and ten thousand one hundred and\r\nfifty-two more annual deaths, than these five sickly old Southern slave\r\nStates. The annual births in New England are sixty-one thousand one\r\nhundred and forty-eight; and in the five slave States seventy-seven\r\nthousand six hundred and eighty-three. In New England the annual deaths\r\nare forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty-eight; in the five slave\r\nStates thirty-two thousand two hundred and sixteen.\r\n\r\nIn New England the ratio of births is one to forty-four; in the five\r\nslave States one to thirty-five. In New England the ratio of deaths is\r\none to sixty-four; in the five slave States it is one to eighty-five.\r\n\r\nThe slaves are not in this estimate of births and deaths; they are in\r\nthe census, however, and that shows that they multiply considerably\r\nfaster, and are less liable to die than the freemen of New England.\r\n\r\nHere are facts which contradict all history and all experience. In a\r\nsickly Southern climate, among slaveholders, people actually multiply\r\nfaster, and die slower, than they do among freemen without slavery, in\r\none of the purest and healthiest Northern climates in the world. How is\r\nthis to be accounted for? Why do people multiply rapidly? Is it because\r\nthey live in a healthy climate? Why do they die rapidly? Is it because\r\nthey live in a sickly climate? Our census contradicts both suppositions.\r\nWhere, then, does the cause lie? Will excluding slavery from a\r\ncommunity cause them to multiply more rapidly and die slower? The\r\ncensus says, No!\r\n\r\nThe census testifies that the proportion of births is twenty-seven per\r\ncent. greater, and the proportion of deaths thirty-three per cent. less,\r\namong slaveholders, in a community where slavery has existed for more\r\nthan two hundred years, under all the disadvantages of a sickly climate,\r\nthan among free men in the pure climate of New England. A man, in his\r\nright mind, will demand an explanation of these astonishing facts. They\r\nare easily explained. The census discloses a degree of _poverty_ in New\r\nEngland, which scatters seventy thousand families to the four winds of\r\nheaven, and _feeds_ (as we shall presently see) the _poor-house_, with\r\none hundred and thirty-five per cent. more of paupers than is found in\r\nthese slave States. This is no condition of things to increase births,\r\nor diminish deaths, unless brothels give _increase_, and squalid poverty\r\nthe requisite sympathy and aid, to recover the sick and dying, from the\r\nperiod of infancy to that of old age.\r\n\r\nWe proceed to compare other facts, which have a bearing upon the\r\nrelative merits of different institutions in securing social prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn every country there is a class to be found in such utter destitution,\r\nthat they must either be supported by charity, or perish of want. This\r\ndestitution arises, generally, from oppressive exactions or excessive\r\nvice, and is evidence of the tendency of social institutions, and the\r\nsuperiority of one over another, in securing the greatest amount of\r\nindividual prosperity and comfort.\r\n\r\nWith these views to aid us, we will compare some facts belonging to New\r\nEngland and these five old slave States. With an equal population, New\r\nEngland has thirty-three thousand four hundred and thirty-one paupers;\r\nthese five slave States have fourteen thousand two hundred and\r\ntwenty-one. Here is an excess of paupers in New England, notwithstanding\r\nher boasted prosperity, of one hundred and thirty-five per cent. over\r\nthese five slave States. And if to these _continual paupers_ we were to\r\nadd the number (as given in State returns) that are partially aided in\r\nNew England, the addition would be awful. But I suppose New England will\r\nstrive to wipe off this stain of regular pauperism, by throwing the\r\nblame of it upon the _foreigners_ among them. It should be remembered,\r\nhowever, as an offset to this, that these foreigners are all from\r\nnon-slaveholding countries. From their infancy they have shared the\r\nblessings of freedom and free institutions; therefore they ought to be\r\nadmitted, as homogeneous materials, in the social organizations of New\r\nEngland, which we are now comparing with Southern slaveholding\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nBut as foreign paupers are distinguished in the census from native born\r\ncitizens, we will now (in the comparison) exclude them in both sections.\r\nThe number of paupers will then be, for New England, eighteen thousand\r\nnine hundred and sixty-six; for the five slave States, eleven thousand\r\nseven hundred and twenty-eight--leaving to New England, which is\r\nconsidered the model section of the world in all that is lovely in\r\nreligious and social prosperity, seven thousand two hundred and\r\nthirty-eight more of her native sons in the poor-house, (or nearly\r\nseventy per cent.,) than are to be found in this condition in an equal\r\npopulation in these five Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of New England's _native sons_ in the poor-house is one to one\r\nhundred and forty-three; of these five slave States one to two hundred\r\nand thirty-four. The ratio of New England's _entire population_ in the\r\npoor-house is one to eighty-one; the ratio of the entire population of\r\nthese five slave States is one to one hundred and seventy-one.\r\n\r\nThe Saviour asks if a good tree can bring forth evil fruit, or an evil\r\ntree good fruit. Here is an exhibition of the _fruit_ borne by _New\r\nEngland freedom_ and _Southern slavery_. The Saviour gives every man a\r\nright to judge the tree by the fruit, and declares such to be righteous\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThere is another item in the census which throws much light on the\r\ncomparative comfort and happiness of the people in these two localities.\r\nIt is neither physical destitution, criminal degradation, nor mental\r\nsuffering; but it is an effect which is known to flow from one, or the\r\nother, or all three of these _conditions_ as causes; therefore it is an\r\nimportant item in determining the amount of destitution, degradation,\r\nand suffering, which exist in a community.\r\n\r\nWhen we see effects which are known to flow from certain causes--the\r\ncauses may be concealed--yet we know that they exist by the effects we\r\nsee. With these remarks I proceed to state a fact disclosed in the\r\ncensus, as it exists in New England, and as it exists in these five old\r\nslave States.\r\n\r\nIn New England, with an equal population, we find that three thousand\r\neight hundred and twenty-nine of her white children have been crushed by\r\nsufferings _of some sort_, to the condition of insanity, while in these\r\nfive old slave States there are only two thousand three hundred and\r\ntwenty-six of her white children who have been called to suffer, in\r\ntheir earthly pilgrimage, a degree of anguish beyond mental endurance.\r\nHere is a difference of more than sixty per cent. in favor of these five\r\nStates, as to conditions of suffering that are beyond endurance among\r\nmen. Very poor evidence this, of the superior happiness and comfort of\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\nBut while her white children are called to suffer over sixty per cent.\r\nmore of these crushing sorrows than those of these five States, how is\r\nit with her black children in freedom, compared with the family here in\r\nslavery, from which the most of them have fled, that they might enjoy\r\nthe blessings of liberty? It is exceedingly interesting to see the\r\nbenefits and blessings which New England freedom and Puritan sympathy\r\nhave conferred upon them.\r\n\r\nHere are the facts of the census upon this subject:\r\n\r\nAmong the free negroes of New England, one is deaf or dumb for every\r\nthree thousand and five; while among the slaves of these States there is\r\nonly one for every six thousand five hundred and fifty-two. In New\r\nEngland one free negro is blind for every eight hundred and seventy;\r\nwhile in these States there is only one blind slave for every two\r\nthousand six hundred and forty-five. In New England there is one free\r\nnegro insane or an idiot for every nine hundred and eighty; while in\r\nthese States there is but one slave for every three thousand and eighty.\r\n\r\nCan any man bring himself to believe, with these facts before him, that\r\nfreedom in New England has proved a blessing to this race of people, or\r\nthat slavery is to them a curse in the Southern States? In\r\nnon-slaveholding States, _money_ will be the _master of poverty_. These\r\nfacts enumerated show the fruits of such a relation the world over. The\r\nslave of money, while nominally free, has none to care for him at those\r\nperiods, and in those conditions of his life, when he is not able to\r\nrender service or labor. Childhood, old age, and sickness, are\r\nconditions which make sympathy indispensable. Nominal freedom, combined\r\nwith poverty, can not secure it in those conditions, because it can not\r\nrender service or labor. The slave of the South enjoys this sympathy in\r\nall conditions from birth till death. There is a spontaneous heart-felt\r\nflow of it, to soothe his sorrows, to supply his wants, and smooth his\r\npassage to the grave. Interest, honor, humanity, public opinion, and the\r\nlaw, all _combine_ to awaken it, and to promote its activity.\r\n\r\nMany facts of the character here examined have been disclosed in State\r\nstatistics, and others in the Federal census; some of which I shall\r\nhereafter notice, that show with the most unquestionable certainty, that\r\nfreedom to this race, in our country, is a curse.\r\n\r\nThe facts which we have now examined, if they prove any thing, prove\r\nthat religion has prospered more among slaveholders at the South, than\r\nit has among free men in New England. Slaveholders have made a much more\r\nextensive and suitable provision for the people of all classes to hear\r\nthe gospel, than has been made by the freemen of New England.\r\nSlaveholders have almost entirely frowned down the attempts of\r\nblind-guides to corrupt the gospel, or mislead the people. Among them\r\norganized bodies to overthrow the moral, social, and religious\r\ninstitutions of society, are unknown.\r\n\r\nIf the facts already examined prove any thing, they prove that wealth,\r\namong slaveholders, is much more equally distributed--so that very few,\r\ncompared with New England, are without homes.\r\n\r\nThe facts examined prove also, beyond question, that the unbearable\r\nmiseries which have their source in the heartless exactions of excessive\r\nwealth, or extreme poverty, are more than sixty per cent. greater in New\r\nEngland than in these States, and that one hundred and thirty-five per\r\ncent. more of New England's toiling millions have to bear the\r\ndegradation of the poor-house, or die of want, than are to be found in\r\nthis condition in these five slave States.\r\n\r\nThe facts we have examined, prove also, that under all the disadvantages\r\nof climate, the natural increase of the slave States is sixty per cent.\r\ngreater than it is in New England--twenty-seven per cent. of it by\r\nincreased annual births, and thirty-three per cent. of it by diminished\r\nannual deaths. These are the most astonishing facts ever presented to\r\nthe world. They speak a language that ought to be read and studied by\r\nall men. In the present state of our country, they ought to be\r\nprayerfully pondered and not disregarded.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all this, the aggregate wealth of New England is a\r\nsource of exultation and pride among her sons. They believe, with a\r\nblind and stubborn tenacity, that slavery tends to poverty, and freedom\r\nto wealth.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the aggregate earnings of the toiling\r\nmillions--when _hoarded_ by a _few_--may grow faster than it will when\r\nthese millions are allowed to take from it a daily supply, equal to\r\ntheir reasonable wants. And it cannot be denied that New England has\r\ngreat aggregate wealth.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the census show, however, that it is very unequally divided\r\namong her people. The question now to be tried is, whether the _few_ in\r\nNew England have _hoarded_ this wealth, and can now _show it_, or\r\nwhether they have squandered it upon their lusts, and are unable to\r\n_show it_.\r\n\r\nThis last and prominent boast of increased aggregate wealth in New\r\nEngland, over that accumulated by slaveholders, we will now test by the\r\ncensus of 1850. This is the standard adopted by our National Legislature\r\nfor its decision.\r\n\r\nBefore we examine the facts, however, let a few reflections which belong\r\nto the subject be weighed.\r\n\r\nThe people of these five slave States are now, and ever have been, an\r\nagricultural people. The people of the New England States are a\r\ncommercial and manufacturing people. New England has, in proportion to\r\nnumbers, the richest and most extensive commerce in the world. In\r\nmanufacturing skill and enterprise, they have no superiors on the globe.\r\nThey have ever reproached the South for investing their income in\r\nslavelabor, in preference to commerce and manufactures. It has been the\r\nsettled conviction among nations, that investments in commerce and\r\nmanufactures give the greatest, and those in agriculture the smallest\r\nprofits. It is the settled conviction of the non-slaveholding States\r\nthat investments in slave labor, for agricultural purposes, is the worst\r\nof all investments, and tends greatly to lessen its profits. This has\r\nbeen proclaimed to the South so long by our Northern neighbors, that\r\nmany here have been brought to believe it, and to regret the existence\r\nof slavery among us on that account, if on no other. With these\r\nobservations we turn to the census.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1850 tells us that New England, with a population now\r\nnumbering two million seven hundred, and twenty-eight thousand and\r\nsixteen, with all the advantages of a commercial and manufacturing\r\ninvestment, and with the most energetic and enterprising free men on\r\nearth, to give that investment its greatest productiveness, has\r\naccumulated wealth, in something over two hundred years, to the amount\r\nof one billion three million four hundred and sixty-six thousand one\r\nhundred and eighty-one dollars; while these five slave States, with an\r\nequal population, have, in the same time, accumulated wealth to the\r\namount of one billion four hundred and twenty million nine hundred and\r\neighty-nine thousand five hundred and seventy-three dollars.\r\n\r\nHere we see the indisputable fact that these five agricultural States,\r\nwith slavery, have accumulated an excess of aggregate wealth over the\r\namount accumulated in New England in the same time, of four hundred and\r\nseventeen million five hundred and twenty-three thousand three hundred\r\nand two dollars--so that the property belonging to New England, if\r\nequally divided, would give to each citizen but three hundred and\r\nsixty-seven dollars, while that belonging to the five slave States, if\r\nequally divided, would give to each citizen the sum of five hundred and\r\ntwenty dollars--a difference in favor of each citizen in these five\r\nslave States of one hundred and fifty-three dollars.\r\n\r\nI am aware, however, of an opinion that some other non-slaveholding\r\nStates, have been much more successful in the accumulation of wealth,\r\nthan the six New England States, and that New York, Pennsylvania, and\r\nOhio, are of this favored number. Lest a design to deceive, by\r\nconcealing this supposed fact, should be attributed to the writer, we\r\nwill see what the census says as to these three more favored States. By\r\nthe census of 1850 we learn that New York, instead of being able to\r\ndivide three hundred and sixty-seven dollars with her citizens, as New\r\nEngland could with hers, is only able to divide two hundred and\r\nthirty-one dollars; Pennsylvania two hundred and fourteen, and Ohio two\r\nhundred and nineteen. These several averages among freemen at the North,\r\nand in New England, stand against the average of five hundred and twenty\r\ndollars, which these five old impoverished Southern slave States could\r\ndivide with their citizens.\r\n\r\nThese facts must astonish our Northern neighbors, so long accustomed to\r\nbelieve that slavery was the fruitful source of poverty, with all its\r\nimagined evils; and these facts will astonish many at the South, so\r\nlong accustomed to hear it affirmed that slavery had produced these\r\nevils, and while they were without the means of knowing, of course they\r\nfeared that it was so.\r\n\r\nThat every thing may appear, however, which will throw additional light\r\non the subject, I will state that Massachusetts, which is the _richest_\r\nnon-slaveholding State, could divide with each of her citizens five\r\nhundred and forty-eight dollars. But on the other hand, South Carolina\r\ncould divide one thousand and one dollars, Louisiana eight hundred and\r\nsix dollars, Mississippi seven hundred and two dollars, and Georgia six\r\nhundred and thirty-eight dollars, with their citizens.\r\n\r\nRhode Island, which is the next _richest_ non-slaveholding State to that\r\nof Massachusetts, could divide with her citizens five hundred and\r\ntwenty-six dollars; one other non-slaveholding State (Connecticut) could\r\ndivide with her citizens three hundred and twenty-one dollars. After\r\nthis, the next _highest_ non-slaveholding State could divide two hundred\r\nand eighty; the next highest two hundred and thirty-one; the next\r\nhighest two hundred and twenty-eight; the next highest two hundred and\r\nnineteen; the next highest two hundred and fourteen dollars. After this,\r\nthe division ranges, among the non-slaveholding States, from one hundred\r\nand sixty-six down to one hundred and thirty-four dollars--which last\r\nsum is the amount that the so-called rich and prosperous Illinois could\r\ndivide with her population.\r\n\r\nIn the slaveholding States that are _less wealthy_ than South Carolina,\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia, already noticed; Alabama could\r\ndivide with her citizens five hundred and eleven dollars; Maryland four\r\nhundred and twenty-three; Virginia four hundred and three; Kentucky\r\nthree hundred and seventy-seven; and North Carolina three hundred and\r\nsixty-seven. All these States are much _richer_ than the _third richest_\r\nnon-slaveholding State of the Union, viz: Connecticut. After this,\r\nTennessee could divide two hundred and forty-eight dollars, and\r\nMissouri, which is the poorest of all the slave States, one hundred and\r\nsixty-six dollars.\r\n\r\nWe will now give the _general average_ of the _non-slaveholding States_,\r\n(California excepted, which in 1850 had not had time to exhibit any\r\nfixed character,) and then the _general average_ of the _slaveholding\r\nStates_ of the _whole Union_.\r\n\r\nThe population of all the free States is thirteen million two hundred\r\nand fourteen thousand three hundred and eighty; the free population of\r\nall the slave States is six million three hundred and twelve thousand\r\neight hundred and ninety-nine. These thirteen million two hundred and\r\nfourteen thousand three hundred and eighty of freemen have accumulated\r\nan aggregate of property estimated at three billion one hundred and\r\neighty-six million six hundred and eighty-three thousand eight hundred\r\nand twenty four dollars; while these six million three hundred and\r\ntwelve thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine of slaveholders have\r\naccumulated an aggregate of two billion seven hundred and seventy-five\r\nmillion one hundred and twenty-one thousand, six hundred and forty-four\r\ndollars' worth of property.\r\n\r\nHere we see that a population of Northern freemen, one hundred and nine\r\n_per cent._ greater than the number of Southern freemen in the slave\r\nStates, have accumulated but sixteen _per cent._ _more_ of property.\r\n\r\nIn a division of the property accumulated by all the non-slaveholding\r\nStates, it will give to each citizen two hundred and thirty-three\r\ndollars; while all accumulated by the various slave States, will give to\r\neach citizen four hundred and thirty-nine dollars--nearly double. Were\r\nwe to give the slaves an equal share with the whites, in an average\r\ndivision of aggregate wealth, the slaveholding States, with their slaves\r\nincluded, would then be able to give each person two hundred and\r\nninety-one dollars instead of two hundred and thirty-three dollars,\r\nwhich is all the free States have to divide with their people.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, with these facts before us, to believe that slavery\r\ntends to poverty. Such is the testimony of the census on the relative\r\nwealth of these two sections of our country. It proves that slavery, as\r\nan agricultural investment, is more profitable than an investment in\r\ncommerce and manufactures. The facts which have been reviewed prove with\r\nequal clearness, that where slavery exists, the white race, and the\r\nblack, have prospered more in their religious, social and moral\r\ncondition, than either race has prospered, where slavery has been\r\nexcluded. We see that an increased amount of poverty and wretchedness\r\nhas to be borne in New England by both races. Ecclesiastical statistics\r\nwill show an increased amount of prosperity in religion that is\r\noverwhelming.\r\n\r\nSuch is the prostration of moral restraint at the North, that, in their\r\ncities, standing armies are necessary to guard the persons and property\r\nof unoffending citizens, and to execute the laws upon reckless\r\noffenders. This state of things is unknown in the slave States.\r\n\r\nThe census shows that slavery has been a blessing to the white race in\r\nthese slave States. They have prospered more in religion, they have more\r\nhomes, are wealthier, multiply faster, and live longer than in New\r\nEngland, and they are exempt from the curse of organized infidelity and\r\nlawless violence.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the slave's condition at the South, with that of his own\r\nrace in freedom at the South, shows with equal clearness, that slavery,\r\nin these States, has been, and now is, a blessing to this race of people\r\nin all the essentials of human happiness and comfort. Our slaves all\r\nhave homes, are bountifully provided for in health, cared for and kindly\r\nnursed in childhood, sickness, and old age; multiply faster, live\r\nlonger, are free from all the corroding ills of poverty and anxious\r\ncare, labor moderately, enjoy the blessings of the gospel, and let alone\r\nby wicked men, are contented and happy.\r\n\r\nEx-Governor Smith, a few years past, in his message to the Legislature\r\nof this State, showed, if I remember correctly, that seven-tenths more\r\nof crime was chargeable to free negroes than to the whites and slaves.\r\nBy the census of 1850, the ratio of whites in the Penitentiary of\r\nVirginia, for ten years, was one to twenty-three thousand and three,\r\nwhile the ratio for the free negroes was one to three thousand and one.\r\nFor the same length of time, in the Penitentiary of Massachusetts, the\r\naverage of whites was one to seven thousand five hundred and\r\neighty-seven, instead of one to twenty-three thousand and three, as in\r\nVirginia; and in Massachusetts the average of free negroes in the\r\nPenitentiary, for this length of time, was one to two hundred and fifty,\r\ninstead of one to three thousand and one, as in Virginia. Here we see\r\nthat for an average of ten years, two hundred and fifty free negroes at\r\nthe North, commit annually as much crime as twenty-three thousand and\r\nthree white persons at the South; and that two hundred and fifty free\r\nnegroes, in a non-slaveholding State, commit annually as much crime as\r\nthree thousand and one free negroes in a slaveholding State. We see,\r\nalso, that seven thousand five hundred and eighty-seven white persons at\r\nthe North, commit annually as much crime as twenty-three thousand and\r\nthree white persons commit at the South. In the cities, criminal\r\ndegradation at the North is from three to five times greater with the\r\nwhites than at the South, and from ten to ninety-three times greater\r\nwith the free negroes at the North, than with the whites at the South,\r\nand about twelve times greater than with the free negroes at the South.\r\n\r\nThe Federal census, and the State records, show not very far from this\r\nproportion of criminal degradation, chargeable to this race of people\r\nwhen invested with _the freedom of New England_. Can we, with these\r\nfacts before us, think that freedom to this race, in our country, is a\r\nblessing to them?\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the condition of the aborigines in freedom is now, and ever\r\nhas been, as much below that of their enslaved sons in these States, as\r\nthe condition of a brute, is beneath that of a man. Slavery is becoming,\r\nto this people, so manifestly a blessing in our country, that fugitives\r\nfrom labor are constantly returning to their masters again, after\r\ntasting the blessings, or rather the awful curse to them, of freedom in\r\nnon-slaveholding States; and while I write, those who are lawfully free\r\nin this State, are praying our Legislature for a law that will allow\r\nthem to become slaves.\r\n\r\nBut before I dismiss the subject of wealth entirely, let me remark, that\r\nwhile the census testifies that an agricultural people, with African\r\nslave labor, increases wealth faster than free labor, employed in\r\nagriculture, manufactures and commerce, yet reason demands that it\r\nshould be satisfactorily accounted for. It is well known that laboring\r\nfreemen at the North are more skillful, work longer in a day, labor\r\nharder while at it, live on cheaper food, and less of it, than laborers\r\nat the South.\r\n\r\nHow, then, is it to be accounted for that the aggregate increase of\r\nwealth is less with them than it is with Southern slaveholders? Among\r\nmany reasons that might be assigned, I will mention three. The first is,\r\nthat half the people at the North (this is ascertained to be about the\r\namount) live in villages, towns and cities. The second reason is, that\r\nthe cost of living in cities (as has been ascertained) is about double\r\nwhat it is in the country--to this _cost_ we must _add_, for the\r\n_imprudent_ indulgences of _pride_ and _fashion_; and to _this_ we must\r\n_add_, for a thousand _indulgences_, in violation of _moral propriety_,\r\nall of which are almost unknown in country life. The third reason is to\r\nbe found in the great amount of pauperism and crime produced by city\r\nlife. In the city of New York, for instance, according to the American\r\nAlmanac, there were received in 1847, at the principal alms-houses of\r\nthe city, twenty-eight thousand six hundred and ninety-two persons, and\r\n_out-door relief_ was given _from the public funds_ to thirty-four\r\nthousand five hundred and seventy-two more--making in all seventy-three\r\nthousand two hundred and sixty-four persons, or one out of every five,\r\nin the city of New York, dependent, more or less, on _public charity_.\r\nThe total cost of this, to the city, was three hundred and nineteen\r\nthousand two hundred and ninety-three dollars and eighty-eight cents. In\r\n1849, in the Mayor's message, the estimate for the same thing is four\r\nhundred thousand dollars. In Massachusetts, according to the report of\r\nthe Secretary of State in 1848, the number of constant and occasional\r\npaupers, in the _whole State_, was one to every twenty of the whole\r\npopulation. The proportion in the cities, I suppose, would equal New\r\nYork, which, as we have seen, is one to five. To this _public burden_ in\r\ncities, we must add an immense _unknown amount_ of _private charity_,\r\nwhich is not needed in country life.\r\n\r\n_Crime_ in Northern cities keeps pace with _pauperism_. In _Boston_,\r\naccording to official State reports a few years past, one person out of\r\nevery fourteen males, and one out of every twenty-eight females, was\r\narraigned for criminal offenses. According to the census of 1850, there\r\nwere in the _State_ of Massachusetts, in a population of nine hundred\r\nand ninety-four thousand five hundred and fourteen, the number of seven\r\nthousand two hundred and fifty convictions for crime. In Virginia, the\r\nsame year, in a population of one million four hundred and twenty-one\r\nthousand six hundred and sixty-one, there were one hundred and seven\r\nconvictions for crime.\r\n\r\nIn the _State_ of New York the proportion of crime is about the same as\r\nin Massachusetts. In the _city_ of New York, in 1848 or 1849, there were\r\nsentenced to the _State Prison_ one hundred and nineteen men and\r\nseventeen women; to the _Penitentiary_ seven hundred men and one hundred\r\nand seventy women; to the _City Prison_ one hundred and sixty-two men\r\nand sixty-seven women--making a total of one thousand two hundred and\r\nthirty-five criminals. Here is an amount of crime in a single city, that\r\nequals all in the fifteen slave States together. In the _State_ of New\r\nYork, according to the census of 1850, there was, in a population of\r\nthree million and ninety-seven thousand three hundred and four, the\r\nnumber of ten thousand two hundred and seventy-nine convictions for\r\ncrime; while in South Carolina, in a population of six hundred and\r\nsixty-eight thousand five hundred and seven, (which is considerably over\r\none-fifth) there were only forty-six convictions for crime.\r\n\r\nTo live in cities filled with such an amount of poverty and criminal\r\ndegradation, as the census discloses, at the North, standing armies of\r\npolicemen, firemen, etc., are absolutely necessary to secure the people\r\nagainst lawless violence. Now subtract from the products of labor the\r\n_cost_ of city life--the cost of vain and criminal indulgences, the\r\n_support_ of _paupers_, and the _machinery_ to guard innocence and\r\npunish crime--and the wonder ceases that wealth accumulates slowly--the\r\nwonder is that it accumulates at all. What is accumulated, must be\r\nprincipally from commerce and manufactures. The system of abandoning the\r\ncountry and congregating in cities, tends directly to concentrate wealth\r\ninto the hands of a few, and to diffuse poverty and crime among the\r\nmasses of the people.\r\n\r\nThese facts of poverty and crime at the North, which are exhibited by\r\nthe census, will help to explain the seeming mystery that the South\r\nmultiplies by natural increase faster than the North. In 1845, according\r\nto her statistical report, Massachusetts had seven-eighths of her\r\nmarriageable young women working in factories under male overseers. The\r\ncensus of 1840 shows that, with fewer adults, Virginia had one hundred\r\nthousand more children than Massachusetts. In the census of 1850 the\r\nproportion in favor of Virginia is still greater.\r\n\r\nPauperism, in Massachusetts and New York, according to the State census,\r\nincreased between 1836 and 1848 ten times faster than wealth or\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn the slaveholding States there is less than a tenth of the people in\r\ncities--pauperism is almost unknown--the people are on farms--the style\r\nof living is less costly by half, but greatly superior in quality and\r\ncomfort--according to the census, there is but little crime--almost all\r\nhave homes--the amount of agricultural labor does not fluctuate--the\r\nfarms are not cultivated by the spade and hoe, but are large enough to\r\njustify a system of enlarged agricultural operations by the aid of horse\r\npower. The result is that more is saved, and the proceeds more equally\r\ndistributed between capital and labor, or the rich and the poor.\r\n\r\nThe South did not seek or desire the responsibility, and the onerous\r\nburden, of civilizing and christianizing these degraded savages; but\r\nGod, in his mysterious providence, brought it about. He allowed England,\r\nand her Puritan sons at the North, from the love of gain, to become the\r\nwilling instruments, to force African slaves upon the Cavaliers of the\r\nSouth. These Cavaliers were a noble race of men. They remonstrated\r\nagainst this outrage to the last. They preferred indented labor from the\r\nmother country, which they were securing as they needed it. A descendant\r\nof theirs, in drafting the Declaration of Independence, made this\r\noutrage one of the prominent causes for dissolving all political\r\nconnection with the mother country. But God intended (as we now see) to\r\nbless these savages, by forcing us against our wills, to become their\r\nmasters and guardians; and he has abundantly blessed us, also, (as we\r\nnow see) for allowing his word to be our counselor in this relation. We\r\nwere forced by his word to admit the relation to be lawful, and he\r\nenabled us to admit and feel the great responsibility devolved upon us\r\nas their divinely appointed protectors.\r\n\r\nThe North, after pocketing the price of these savages, refused to bear\r\nany part of the burden of training and elevating them; and finally, with\r\nFrance and England, turned them loose by emancipation, and ignored the\r\nword of God in justification of the deed, by declaring that to hold them\r\nin slavery was sinful. The result is, that the portion they held of this\r\ndegraded race, is immersed in poverty, wretchedness and crime, without a\r\nparallel in civilized communities, and are less in number now, than the\r\noriginal importations from Africa, (so says the Superintendent of the\r\ncensus;) while the portion held by us is in high comfort, regularly\r\nimproving in morals and intellect, and multiplying more rapidly than the\r\nwhite race at the North. It does seem, from the facts of the census,\r\nthat this (so-called) philanthropy has been a curse to _both races, at\r\nthe North, and in the West Indies_, and that it is displeasing in the\r\nsight of God. The census exhibits unmistakable evidence that, without a\r\nchange, the emancipated portion of the race, _in these localities_, will\r\nultimately perish, and that this catastrophe is to be hastened by\r\npoverty and criminal degradation. The census shows that those who are\r\n_responsible_ for this deed are subjected _in our country_, by annual\r\n_births_ and _deaths_, to a _decrease_ of sixty per cent., and to a much\r\n_heavier per cent._ than this, _of poverty and crime_.\r\n\r\nBut while these are the results to both races at the North, prosperity,\r\nunequaled in the annals of the world, has attended us (as the census\r\nshows) in almost every thing we have put our hands to, both for this\r\nlife and that which is to come. The _satisfaction_ is ours, also, of\r\n_knowing_ that these degraded outcasts, which were thrown upon our\r\nhands, have not only been _cared for_, but _elevated in the scale of\r\nbeing_, and brought to share largely in the blessings of intellectual,\r\nsocial, and religious culture.\r\n\r\nBut for their _enslaved condition_ here, they would have remained until\r\nthis hour in their _original degradation_.\r\n\r\n_In view of all the facts compared_, I would ask all who feel interested\r\nin the great question now agitating our country, to let these facts be\r\ntheir guide and counselor in deciding the issue. Are the people of the\r\nNorth warranted from these facts, in believing they would honor God and\r\nbenefit men by overthrowing the institution of slavery, if they could.\r\n\r\nThese facts testify plainly, that where African slavery has existed in\r\nour country for more than two hundred years, the social and religious\r\ncondition of men has improved more rapidly than it has under the best\r\narrangements of exclusive freedom.\r\n\r\nThese facts show that, with the advantages of the best location and\r\nclimate upon the globe, and a high degree of moral, religious, and\r\nsocial intelligence to commence with, those communities at the North who\r\nexcluded this element from their organizations, are actually behind\r\nslaveholding communities, in religion, in wealth, in the increase of\r\ntheir race, and in the comforts of their condition. If this be so, (and\r\nthe census testifies that it is,) what will justify the North in efforts\r\nto involve both sections of our country in civil war and disunion,\r\nbecause slavery exists in one section of it? And if the institution of\r\nAfrican slavery has certainly improved the condition of both races in\r\nour country, (and the census testifies that it has,) why should they\r\nhazard all the blessings vouchsafed to the North and the South sooner\r\nthan suffer its expansion over new territory?\r\n\r\nThe expansion of African slavery (according to the test by which we are\r\nnow trying it) has never yet done injury in this Union. In Texas\r\nslaveholders were called to organize a State, (not in this Union at the\r\ntime,) which in 1850 had a population of two hundred and twelve thousand\r\nfive hundred and ninety-two. The individuals composing it originally,\r\nwere the most lawless set of adventurers that ever lived. Did slavery\r\ndisqualify slaveholders from organizing a social body, even out of these\r\nmaterials, that could secure the highest results in human progress? What\r\nis now the social, moral, and religious complexion of Texas? In the\r\nessentials of prosperity it is ahead, under equal circumstances, of any\r\nportion of the Union. Slaveholders, in the providence of God, had to\r\norganize States on the Gulf of Mexico, and on the banks of the\r\nMississippi, after the acquisition of Louisiana from France, and Florida\r\nfrom Spain. The original materials (numbering upwards of seventy\r\nthousand) of which these States were composed, had been trained under\r\nthe most pernicious system of morals that ever existed among a civilized\r\npeople. The result in this case, also, will testify that slavery does\r\nnot paralyze communities in the accumulation of wealth, or in the\r\ncorrection of moral, social, and religious evils. The census shows that\r\nin all these items these new slave States which have been added to our\r\nUnion, have greatly outstripped their non-slaveholding equals in age.\r\nThe temples of the Lord are now seen studding these slaveholding\r\nlocalities over, and are vocal with his praise--the moral majesty of the\r\nlaw is a paramount power. The amount of paupers and criminals, in some\r\nof them, is less than one-seventieth part that is chargeable to some of\r\ntheir twin sisters of equal age, (who are free[232]) nurseries of\r\nliterature and science are multiplying rapidly, and promising the\r\nhighest results--prosperity, in these slaveholding communities, in\r\ncrowning the efforts of good men to arrest vice, to promote virtue, to\r\ndiminish want, to create plenty, and to arrange the elements of progress\r\nfor the highest social, moral, and religious results.\r\n\r\nThere is another historical fact which deserves to be weighed, in making\r\nup a judgment on the expansion of slavery. Within the present century,\r\nthe colonies of Mexico and South America, in imitation of our example,\r\nthrew off the colonial yoke, and established independent governments.\r\nAll of these States, except one, preferred the non-slaveholding model,\r\nand _excluded_ the element of _slavery_: that one, which is Brazil,\r\npreferred the model adopted by the Southern States of this Union, and\r\n_retained_ African _slavery_.\r\n\r\nAll of those States, which _excluded slavery_, have been visited, in\r\nrapid succession, with _insurrection, revolution, and fearful anarchy_;\r\nwhile Brazil has enjoyed tranquillity, from the commencement of her\r\nindependent political existence until the present hour. This remarkable\r\nfact has occurred, too, in a State where the slaves are two to one of\r\nthe other race. The slaves in the United States are one to two of the\r\nother race. Is not this fact, like all those examined, _God's\r\nprovidential voice_? and does He not, in these facts, speak a language\r\nthat we can _read and understand_?\r\n\r\nNow, shall we, in view of these facts, rebel against the teachings of\r\nHis providence, as it is now made known to us in the census, and claim\r\nfor ourselves more wisdom than he has displayed, in _allowing such\r\nresults_ to be the product of _slaveholding communities_?\r\n\r\nWe cannot put an end to African slavery, if we would--and we ought not,\r\nif we could--until God opens a door to _make its termination a blessing,\r\nand not a curse_. When He does that, slavery in this Union will end.\r\n\r\n                   With Christian affection, yours,\r\n                                         THORNTON STRINGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[231] This letter was addressed to ELDER JAMES FIFE.\r\n\r\n[232] Texas and Michigan; see also, Arkansas and Indiana, Florida and\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\nIN THE LIGHT OF SOCIAL ETHICS.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR HARPER,\r\n\r\nOF SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHT OF SOCIAL ETHICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF SLAVERY ON SOCIAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n          Necessity of Investigation--Vindicators of\r\n          Slavery--Slavery a means of\r\n          Civilization--Prejudices of\r\n          Abolitionism--Discussion of the Declaration of\r\n          Independence--Rights of\r\n          Society--Self-Preservation--The greatest good to\r\n          the greatest number--Ambiguity in moral\r\n          Investigation--Influence of Slavery on\r\n          Civilization--The Slavery of England's\r\n          Civilization--How Slavery retards the evils of\r\n          Civilization--Servitude Inevitable--Abuses of\r\n          Slavery and of Free Labor--Social ties, master and\r\n          slave--Intellectual advancement--Morals of\r\n          Slavery, and of Free Labor--Marriage relation and\r\n          licentiousness--Virtues of Slavery--Security from\r\n          Evils--Insecurity of Free Labor--Menial\r\n          occupations necessary--Utopianism--Slavery and the\r\n          servitude of Civilization contrasted--The African\r\n          an inferior variety of the human race--Elevating\r\n          influence of Slavery on the slave, on the master,\r\n          on statesmen--Duties of master--Elevation of\r\n          female character--Necessity of Slavery in tropical\r\n          climates--Examples from history--Southern\r\n          States--Insurrections impossible--Military\r\n          strength of Slavery--Advantageous consequences of\r\n          the increase of slaves--Destructive consequences\r\n          of Emancipation to our country, and to the\r\n          world--Kakistocracy--White\r\n          emigration--Amalgamation--Deplorable results of\r\n          Fanaticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE institution of domestic slavery exists over far the greater portion\r\nof the inhabited earth. Until within a very few centuries, it may be\r\nsaid to have existed over the whole earth--at least in all those\r\nportions of it which had made any advances toward civilization. We might\r\nsafely conclude then, that it is deeply founded in the nature of man and\r\nthe exigencies of human society. Yet, in the few countries in which it\r\nhas been abolished--claiming, perhaps justly, to be furthest advanced in\r\ncivilization and intelligence, but which have had the smallest\r\nopportunity of observing its true character and effects--it is\r\ndenounced as the most intolerable of social and political evils. Its\r\nexistence, and every hour of its continuance, is regarded as the crime\r\nof the communities in which it is found. Even by those in the countries\r\nalluded to, who regard it with the most indulgence or the least\r\nabhorrence--who attribute no criminality to the present generation--who\r\nfound it in existence, and have not yet been able to devise the means of\r\nabolishing it,--it is pronounced a misfortune and a curse injurious and\r\ndangerous always, and which must be finally fatal to the societies which\r\nadmit it. This is no longer regarded as a subject of argument and\r\ninvestigation. The opinions referred to are assumed as settled, or the\r\ntruth of them as self-evident. If any voice is raised among ourselves to\r\nextenuate or to vindicate, it is unheard. The judgment is made up. We\r\ncan have no hearing before the tribunal of the civilized world. Yet, on\r\nthis very account, it is more important that we, the inhabitants of the\r\nslaveholding States of America, insulated as we are, by this\r\ninstitution, and cut off, in some degree, from the communion and\r\nsympathies of the world by which we are surrounded, or with which we\r\nhave intercourse, and exposed continually to their animadversions and\r\nattacks, should thoroughly understand this subject, and our strength and\r\nweakness in relation to it. If it be thus criminal, dangerous, and\r\nfatal; and if it be possible to devise means of freeing ourselves from\r\nit, we ought at once to set about the employing of those means. It would\r\nbe the most wretched and imbecile fatuity, to shut our eyes to the\r\nimpending dangers and horrors, and \"drive darkling down the current of\r\nour fate,\" till we are overwhelmed in the final destruction. If we are\r\ntyrants, cruel, unjust, oppressive, let us humble ourselves and repent\r\nin the sight of heaven, that the foul stain may be cleansed, and we\r\nenabled to stand erect as having common claims to humanity with our\r\nfellow-men.\r\n\r\nBut if we are nothing of all this; if we commit no injustice or cruelty;\r\nif the maintenance of our institutions be essential to our prosperity,\r\nour character, our safety, and the safety of all that is dear to us, let\r\nus enlighten our minds and fortify our hearts to defend them.\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat singular evidence of the indisposition of the rest of\r\nthe world to hear any thing more on this subject, that perhaps the most\r\nprofound, original, and truly philosophical treatise, which has\r\nappeared within the time of my recollection,[233] seems not to have\r\nattracted the slightest attention out of the limits of the slaveholding\r\nStates themselves. If truth, reason, and conclusive argument, propounded\r\nwith admirable temper and perfect candor, might be supposed to have an\r\neffect on the minds of men, we should think this work would have put an\r\nend to agitation on the subject. The author has rendered inappreciable\r\nservice to the South in enlightening them on the subject of their own\r\ninstitutions, and turning back that monstrous tide of folly and madness\r\nwhich, if it had rolled on, would have involved his own great State\r\nalong with the rest of the slaveholding States in a common ruin. But\r\nbeyond these, he seems to have produced no effect whatever. The\r\ndenouncers of slavery, with whose production the press groans, seems to\r\nbe unaware of his existence--unaware that there is a reason to be\r\nencountered or argument to be answered. They assume that the truth is\r\nknown and settled, and only requires to be enforced by denunciation.\r\n\r\nAnother vindicator of the South has appeared in an individual who is\r\namong those that have done honor to American literature.[234] With\r\nconclusive argument, and great force of expression, he has defended\r\nslavery from the charge of injustice or immorality, and shown clearly\r\nthe unspeakable cruelty and mischief which must result from any scheme\r\nof abolition. He does not live among slaveholders, and it can not be\r\nsaid of him, as of others, that his mind is warped by interest, or his\r\nmoral sense blunted by habit and familiarity with abuse. These\r\ncircumstances, it might be supposed, would have secured him hearing and\r\nconsideration. He seems to be equally unheeded, and the work of\r\ndenunciation, disdaining argument, still goes on.\r\n\r\nPresident Dew has shown that the institution of slavery is a principal\r\ncause of civilization. Perhaps nothing can be more evident than that it\r\nis the sole cause. If any thing can be predicated as universally true of\r\nuncultivated man, it is that he will not labor beyond what is absolutely\r\nnecessary to maintain his existence. Labor is pain to those who are\r\nunaccustomed to it, and the nature of man is averse to pain. Even with\r\nall the training, the helps, and motives of civilization, we find that\r\nthis aversion can not be overcome in many individuals of the most\r\ncultivated societies. The coercion of slavery alone is adequate to form\r\nman to habits of labor. Without it, there can be no accumulation of\r\nproperty, no providence for the future, no tastes for comfort or\r\nelegancies, which are the characteristics and essentials of\r\ncivilization. He who has obtained the command of another's labor, first\r\nbegins to accumulate and provide for the future, and the foundations of\r\ncivilization are laid. We find confirmed by experience that which is so\r\nevident in theory. Since the existence of man upon the earth, with no\r\nexception whatever, either of ancient or modern times, every society\r\nwhich has attained civilization, has advanced to it through this\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nWill those who regard slavery as immoral, or crime in itself, tell us\r\nthat man was not intended for civilization, but to roam the earth as a\r\nbiped brute? That he was not to raise his eyes to Heaven, or be\r\nconformed in his nobler faculties to the image of his Maker? Or will\r\nthey say that the Judge of all the earth has done wrong in ordaining the\r\nmeans by which alone that end can be obtained? It is true that the\r\nCreator can make the wickedness as well as the wrath of man to praise\r\nhim, and bring forth the most benevolent results from the most atrocious\r\nactions. But in such cases, it is the motive of the actor alone which\r\ncondemns the action. The act itself is good, if it promotes the good\r\npurposes of God, and would be approved by him, if that result only were\r\nintended. Do they not blaspheme the providence of God who denounce as\r\nwickedness and outrage, that which is rendered indispensable to his\r\npurposes in the government of the world? Or at what stage of the\r\nprogress of society will they say that slavery ceases to be necessary,\r\nand its very existence becomes sin and crime? I am aware that such\r\nargument would have little effect on those with whom it would be\r\ndegrading to contend--who pervert the inspired writings--which in some\r\nparts expressly sanction slavery, and throughout indicate most clearly\r\nthat it is a civil institution, with which religion has no concern--with\r\na shallowness and presumption not less flagrant and shameless than his,\r\nwho would justify murder from the text, \"and Phineas arose and executed\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something in this subject which blunts the\r\npreceptions, and darkens and confuses the understandings and moral\r\nfeelings of men. Tell them that, of necessity, in every civilized\r\nsociety, there must be an infinite variety of conditions and\r\nemployments, from the most eminent and intellectual, to the most servile\r\nand laborious; that the negro race, from their temperament and capacity,\r\nare peculiarly suited to the situation which they occupy, and not less\r\nhappy in it than any corresponding class to be found in the world; prove\r\nincontestably that no scheme of emancipation could be carried into\r\neffect without the most intolerable mischiefs and calamities to both\r\nmaster and slave, or without probably throwing a large and fertile\r\nportion of the earth's surface out of the pale of civilization--and you\r\nhave done nothing. They reply, that whatever may be the consequence, you\r\nare bound to do _right_; that man has a right to himself, and man cannot\r\nhave property in man; that if the negro race be naturally inferior in\r\nmind and character, they are not less entitled to the rights of\r\nhumanity; that if they are happy in their condition, it affords but the\r\nstronger evidence of their degradation, and renders them still more\r\nobjects of commiseration. They repeat, as the fundamental maxim of our\r\ncivil policy, that all men are born free and equal, and quote from our\r\nDeclaration of Independence, \"that men are endowed by their Creator with\r\ncertain inalienable _rights_, among which are life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not the first time that I have had occasion to observe that men\r\nmay repeat with the utmost confidence, some maxim or sentimental phrase,\r\nas self-evident or admitted truth, which is either palpably false, or to\r\nwhich, upon examination, it will be found that they attach no definite\r\nidea. Notwithstanding our respect for the important document which\r\ndeclared our independence, yet if any thing be found in it, and\r\nespecially in what may be regarded rather as its ornament than its\r\nsubstance--false, sophistical or unmeaning, that respect should not\r\nscreen it from the freest examination.\r\n\r\n_All men are born free and equal._ Is it not palpably nearer the truth\r\nto say that no man was ever born free, and that no two men were ever\r\nborn equal? Man is born in a state of the most helpless dependence on\r\nothers. He continues subject to the absolute control of others, and\r\nremains without many of the civil and all of the political privileges of\r\nhis society, until the period which the laws have fixed as that at which\r\nhe is supposed to have attained the maturity of his faculties. Then\r\ninequality is further developed, and becomes infinite in every society,\r\nand under whatever form of government. Wealth and poverty, fame or\r\nobscurity, strength or weakness, knowledge or ignorance, ease or labor,\r\npower or subjection, mark the endless diversity in the condition of men.\r\n\r\nBut we have not arrived at the profundity of the maxim. This inequality\r\nis, in a great measure, the result of abuses in the institutions of\r\nsociety. They do not speak of what exists, but of what ought to exist.\r\nEvery one should be left at liberty to obtain all the advantages of\r\nsociety which he can compass, by the free exertion of his faculties,\r\nunimpeded by civil restraints. It may be said that this would not remedy\r\nthe evils of society which are complained of. The inequalities to which\r\nI have referred, with the misery resulting from them, would exist in\r\nfact under the freest and most popular form of government that man could\r\ndevise. But what is the foundation of the bold dogma so confidently\r\nannounced? Females are human and rational beings. They may be found of\r\nbetter faculties, and better qualified to exercise political privileges,\r\nand to attain the distinctions of society, than many men; yet who\r\ncomplains of the order of society by which they are excluded from them?\r\nFor I do not speak of the few who would desecrate them; do violence to\r\nthe nature which their Creator has impressed upon them; drag them from\r\nthe position which they necessarily occupy for the existence of\r\ncivilized society, and in which they constitute its blessing and\r\nornament--the only position which they have ever occupied in any human\r\nsociety--to place them in a situation in which they would be alike\r\nmiserable and degraded. Low as we descend in combating the theories of\r\npresumptuous dogmatists, it cannot be necessary to stoop to this. A\r\nyouth of eighteen may have powers which cast into the shade those of any\r\nof his more advanced cotemporaries. He may be capable of serving or\r\nsaving his country, and if not permitted to do so now, the occasion may\r\nhave been lost forever. But he can exercise no political privilege, or\r\naspire to any political distinction. It is said that, of necessity,\r\nsociety must exclude from some civil and political privileges those who\r\nare unfitted to exercise them, by infirmity, unsuitableness of\r\ncharacter, or defect of discretion; that of necessity there must be some\r\ngeneral rule on the subject, and that any rule which can be devised will\r\noperate with hardship and injustice on individuals. This is all that can\r\nbe said, and all that need be said. It is saying, in other words, that\r\nthe privileges in question are no matter of natural right, but to be\r\nsettled by convention, as the good and safety of society may require. If\r\nsociety should disfranchise individuals convicted of infamous crimes,\r\nwould this be an invasion of natural right? Yet this would not be\r\njustified on the score of their moral guilt, but that the good of\r\nsociety required or would be promoted by it. We admit the existence of a\r\nmoral law, binding on societies as on individuals. Society must act in\r\ngood faith. No man, or body of men, has a right to inflict pain or\r\nprivation on others, unless with a view, after full and impartial\r\ndeliberation, to prevent a greater evil. If this deliberation be had,\r\nand the decision made in good faith, there can be no imputation of moral\r\nguilt. Has any politician contended that the very existence of\r\ngovernments in which there are orders privileged by law, constitutes a\r\nviolation of morality; that their continuance is a crime, which men are\r\nbound to put an end to, without any consideration of the good or evil to\r\nresult from the change? Yet this is the natural inference from the dogma\r\nof the natural equality of men as applied to our institution of\r\nslavery--an equality not to be invaded without injustice and wrong, and\r\nrequiring to be restored instantly, unqualifiedly, and without reference\r\nto consequences.\r\n\r\nThis is sufficiently common-place, but we are sometimes driven to\r\ncommon-place. It is no less a false and shallow, than a presumptuous\r\nphilosophy, which theorizes on the affairs of men as a problem to be\r\nsolved by some unerring rule of human reason, without reference to the\r\ndesigns of a superior intelligence, so far as he has been placed to\r\nindicate them, in their creation and destiny. Man is born to subjection.\r\nNot only during infancy is he dependent, and under the control of\r\nothers; at all ages, it is the very bias of his nature, that the strong\r\nand the wise should control the weak and the ignorant. So it has been\r\nsince the days of Nimrod. The existence of some form of slavery in all\r\nages and countries, is proof enough of this. He is born to subjection as\r\nhe is born in sin and ignorance. To make any considerable progress in\r\nknowledge, the continued efforts of successive generations, and the\r\ndiligent training and unwearied exertions of the individual, are\r\nrequisite. To make progress in moral virtue, not less time and effort,\r\naided by superior help, are necessary; and it is only by the matured\r\nexercise of his knowledge and his virtue, that he can attain to civil\r\nfreedom. Of all things, the existence of civil liberty is most the\r\nresult of artificial institution. The proclivity of the natural man is\r\nto domineer or to be subservient. A noble result, indeed, but in the\r\nattaining of which, as in the instances of knowledge and virtue, the\r\nCreator, for his own purposes, has set a limit beyond which we cannot\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nBut he who is most advanced in knowledge, is most sensible of his own\r\nignorance, and how much must forever be unknown to man in his present\r\ncondition. As I have heard it expressed, the further you extend the\r\ncircle of light, the wider is the horizon of darkness. He who has made\r\nthe greatest progress in moral purity, is most sensible of the\r\ndepravity, not only of the world around him, but of his own heart, and\r\nthe imperfection of his best motives; and this he knows that men must\r\nfeel and lament so long as they continue men. So when the greatest\r\nprogress in civil liberty has been made, the enlightened lover of\r\nliberty will know that there must remain much inequality, much\r\ninjustice, much _slavery_, which no human wisdom or virtue will ever be\r\nable wholly to prevent or redress. As I have before had the honor to say\r\nto this Society, the condition of our whole existence is but to struggle\r\nwith evils--to compare them--to choose between them, and, so far as we\r\ncan, to mitigate them. To say that there is evil in any institution, is\r\nonly to say that it is human.\r\n\r\nAnd can we doubt but that this long discipline and laborious process, by\r\nwhich men are required to work out the elevation and improvement of\r\ntheir individual nature and their social condition, is imposed for a\r\ngreat and benevolent end? Our faculties are not adequate to the solution\r\nof the mystery, why it should be so; but the truth is clear, that the\r\nworld was not intended for the seat of universal knowledge, or goodness,\r\nor happiness, or freedom.\r\n\r\n_Man has been endowed by his Creator with certain inalienable rights,\r\namong which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness._ What is\r\nmeant by the _inalienable_ right of liberty? Has any one who has used\r\nthe words ever asked himself this question? Does it mean that a man has\r\nno right to alienate his own liberty--to sell himself and his posterity\r\nfor slaves? This would seem to be the more obvious meaning. When the\r\nword _right_ is used, it has reference to some law which sanctions it,\r\nand would be violated by its invasion. It must refer either to the\r\ngeneral law of morality, or the law of the country--the law of God or\r\nthe law of man. If the law of any country permitted it, it would of\r\ncourse be absurd to say that the law of that country was violated by\r\nsuch alienation. If it have any meaning in this respect, it must mean\r\nthat though the law of the country permitted it, the man would be guilty\r\nof an immoral act who should thus alienate his liberty. A fit question\r\nfor schoolmen to discuss, and the consequences resulting from its\r\ndecision as important as from any of theirs. Yet who will say that the\r\nman pressed by famine, and in prospect of death, would be criminal for\r\nsuch an act? Self-preservation, as is truly said, is the first law of\r\nnature. High and peculiar characters, by elaborate cultivation, may be\r\ntaught to prefer death to slavery, but it would be folly to prescribe\r\nthis as a duty to the mass of mankind.\r\n\r\nIf any rational meaning can be attributed to the sentence I have quoted,\r\nit is this:--That the society, or the individuals who exercise the\r\npowers of government, are guilty of a violation of the law of God or of\r\nmorality, when, by any law or public act, they deprive men of life or\r\nliberty, or restrain them in the pursuit of happiness. Yet every\r\ngovernment does, and of necessity must, deprive men of life and liberty\r\nfor offenses against society. Restrain them in the pursuit of happiness!\r\nWhy all the laws of society are intended for nothing else but to\r\nrestrain men from the pursuit of happiness, according to their own ideas\r\nof happiness or advantage--which the phrase must mean if it means any\r\nthing. And by what right does society punish by the loss of life or\r\nliberty? Not on account of the moral guilt of the criminal--not by\r\nimpiously and arrogantly assuming the prerogative of the Almighty, to\r\ndispense justice or suffering, according to moral desert. It is for its\r\nown protection--it is the right of self-defense. If there existed the\r\nblackest moral turpitude, which by its example or consequences, could be\r\nof no evil to society, government would have nothing to do with that. If\r\nan action, the most harmless in its moral character, could be dangerous\r\nto the security of society, society would have the perfect right to\r\npunish it. If the possession of a black skin would be otherwise\r\ndangerous to society, society has the same right to protect itself by\r\ndisfranchising the possessor of civil privilege, and to continue the\r\ndisability to his posterity, if the same danger would be incurred by its\r\nremoval. Society inflicts these forfeitures for the security of the\r\nlives of its members; it inflicts them for the security of their\r\nproperty, the great essential of civilization; it inflicts them also for\r\nthe protection of its political institutions, the forcible attempt to\r\noverturn which, has always been justly regarded as the greatest crime;\r\nand who has questioned its right so to inflict? \"Man can not have\r\nproperty in man\"--a phrase as full of meaning as, \"who slays fat oxen\r\nshould himself be fat.\" Certainly he may, if the laws of society allow\r\nit, and if it be on sufficient grounds, neither he nor society do wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd is it by this--as we must call it, however recommended to our higher\r\nfeelings by its associations--well-sounding, but unmeaning verbiage of\r\nnatural equality and inalienable rights, that our lives are to be put in\r\njeopardy, our property destroyed, and our political institutions\r\noverturned or endangered? If a people had on its borders a tribe of\r\nbarbarians, whom no treaties or faith could bind, and by whose attacks\r\nthey were constantly endangered, against whom they could devise no\r\nsecurity, but that they should be exterminated or enslaved; would they\r\nnot have the right to enslave them, and keep them in slavery so long as\r\nthe same danger would be incurred by their manumission? If a civilized\r\nman and a savage were by chance placed together on a desolate island,\r\nand the former, by the superior power of civilization, would reduce the\r\nlatter to subjection, would he not have the same right? Would this not\r\nbe the strictest self-defense? I do not now consider, how far we can\r\nmake out a similar case to justify our enslaving of the negroes. I speak\r\nto those who contend for inalienable rights, and that the existence of\r\nslavery always, and under all circumstances, involves injustice and\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, we acknowledge the existence of a moral law. It is not\r\nnecessary for us to resort to the theory which resolves all right into\r\nforce. The existence of such a law is imprinted on the hearts of all\r\nhuman beings. But though its existence be acknowledged, the mind of man\r\nhas hitherto been tasked in vain to discover an unerring standard of\r\nmorality. It is a common and undoubted maxim of morality, that you shall\r\nnot do evil that good may come. You shall not do injustice or commit an\r\ninvasion of the rights of others, for the sake of a greater ulterior\r\ngood. But what is injustice, and what are the rights of others? And why\r\nare we not to commit the one or invade the other? It is because it\r\ninflicts pain or suffering, present or prospective, or cuts them off\r\nfrom enjoyment which they might otherwise attain. The Creator has\r\nsufficiently revealed to us that _happiness_ is the great end of\r\nexistence, the sole object of all animated and sentient beings. To this\r\nhe has directed their aspirations and efforts, and we feel that we\r\nthwart his benevolent purposes when we destroy or impede that happiness.\r\nThis is the only _natural_ right of man. All other rights result from\r\nthe conventions of society, and these, to be sure, we are not to invade,\r\nwhatever good may appear to us likely to follow. Yet are we in no\r\ninstance to inflict pain or suffering, or disturb enjoyment, for the\r\nsake of producing a greater good? Is the madman not to be restrained who\r\nwould bring destruction on himself or others? Is pain not to be\r\ninflicted on the child, when it is the only means by which he can be\r\neffectually instructed to provide for his own future happiness? Is the\r\nsurgeon guilty of wrong who amputates a limb to preserve life? Is not\r\nthe object of all penal legislation, to inflict suffering for the sake\r\nof greater good to be secured to society?\r\n\r\nBy what right is it that man exercises dominion over the beasts of the\r\nfield; subdues them to painful labor, or deprives them of life for his\r\nsustenance or enjoyment? They are not rational beings. No, but they are\r\nthe creatures of God, sentient beings, capable of suffering and\r\nenjoyment, and entitled to enjoy according to the measure of their\r\ncapacities. Does not the voice of nature inform every one, that he is\r\nguilty of wrong when he inflicts on them pain without necessity or\r\nobject? If their existence be limited to the present life, it affords\r\nthe stronger argument for affording them the brief enjoyment of which it\r\nis capable. It is because the greater good is effected; not only to man\r\nbut to the inferior animals themselves. The care of man gives the boon\r\nof existence to myriads who would never otherwise have enjoyed it, and\r\nthe enjoyment of their existence is better provided for while it lasts.\r\nIt belongs to the being of superior faculties to judge of the relations\r\nwhich shall subsist between himself and inferior animals, and the use he\r\nshall make of them; and he may justly consider himself, who has the\r\ngreater capacity of enjoyment, in the first instance. Yet he must do\r\nthis conscientiously, and no doubt, moral guilt has been incurred by the\r\ninfliction of pain on these animals, with no adequate benefit to be\r\nexpected. I do no disparagement to the dignity of human nature, even in\r\nits humblest form, when I say that on the very same foundation, with the\r\ndifference only of circumstance and degree, rests the right of the\r\ncivilized and cultivated man, over the savage and ignorant. It is the\r\norder of nature and of God, that the being of superior faculties and\r\nknowledge, and therefore of superior power, should control and dispose\r\nof those who are inferior. It is as much in the order of nature, that\r\nmen should enslave each other, as that other animals should prey upon\r\neach other. I admit that he does this under the highest moral\r\nresponsibility, and is most guilty if he wantonly inflicts misery or\r\nprivation on beings more capable of enjoyment or suffering than brutes,\r\nwithout necessity or any view to the greater good which is to result. If\r\nwe conceive of society existing without government, and that one man by\r\nhis superior strength, courage or wisdom, could obtain the mastery of\r\nhis fellows, he would have a perfect right to do so. He would be morally\r\nresponsible for the use of his power, and guilty if he failed to direct\r\nthem so as to promote their happiness as well as his own. Moralists have\r\ndenounced the injustice and cruelty which have been practiced towards\r\nour aboriginal Indians, by which they have been driven from their native\r\nseats and exterminated, and no doubt with much justice. No doubt, much\r\nfraud and injustice has been practiced in the circumstances and the\r\nmanner of their removal. Yet who has contended that civilized man had no\r\nmoral right to possess himself of the country? That he was bound to\r\nleave this wide and fertile continent, which is capable of sustaining\r\nuncounted myriads of a civilized race, to a few roving and ignorant\r\nbarbarians? Yet if any thing is certain, it is certain that there were\r\nno means by which he could possess the country, without exterminating or\r\nenslaving them. Savage and civilized man cannot live together, and the\r\nsavage can be tamed only by being enslaved or by having slaves. By\r\nenslaving alone could he have preserved them.[235] And who shall take\r\nupon himself to decide that the more benevolent course, and more\r\npleasing to God, was pursued towards them, or that it would not have\r\nbeen better that they had been enslaved generally, as they were in\r\nparticular instances? It is a refined philosophy, and utterly false in\r\nits application to general nature, or the mass of human kind, which\r\nteaches that existence is not the greatest of all boons, and worthy of\r\nbeing preserved even under the most adverse circumstances. The strongest\r\ninstinct of all animated beings sufficiently proclaims this. When the\r\nlast red man shall have vanished from our forests, the sole remaining\r\ntraces of his blood will be found among our enslaved population.[236]\r\nThe African slave trade has given, and will give, the boon of existence\r\nto millions and millions in our country, who would otherwise never have\r\nenjoyed it, and the enjoyment of their existence is better provided for\r\nwhile it lasts. Or if, for the rights of man over inferior animals, we\r\nare referred to revelation, which pronounces--\"ye shall have dominion\r\nover the beasts of the field, and over the fowls of the air,\" we refer\r\nto the same, which declares not the less explicitly--\r\n\r\n\"Both the bond-men and bond-maids which thou shalt have, shall be of the\r\nheathen that are among you. Of them shall you buy bond-men and\r\nbond-maids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moreover of the children of strangers that do sojourn among you, of\r\nthem shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they\r\nbegot in your land, and they shall be your possession. And ye shall take\r\nthem as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them by\r\npossession. They shall be your bond-men forever.\"\r\n\r\nIn moral investigations, ambiguity is often occasioned by confounding\r\nthe intrinsic nature of an action, as determined by its consequence,\r\nwith the motives of the actor, involving moral guilt or innocence. If\r\npoison be given with a view to destroy another, and it cures him of\r\ndisease, the poisoner is guilty, but the act is beneficent in its\r\nresults. If medicine be given with a view to heal, and it happens to\r\nkill, he who administered it is innocent, but the act is a noxious one.\r\nIf they who begun and prosecuted the slave trade, practiced horrible\r\ncruelties and inflicted much suffering--as no doubt they did, though\r\nthese have been much exaggerated--for merely selfish purposes, and with\r\nno view to future good, they were morally most guilty. So far as\r\nunnecessary cruelty was practiced, the motive and the act were alike\r\nbad. But if we could be sure that the entire effect of the trade has\r\nbeen to produce more happiness than would otherwise have existed, we\r\nmust pronounce it good, and that it has happened in the ordering of\r\nGod's providence, to whom evil cannot be imputed. Moral guilt has not\r\nbeen imputed to Las Casas, and if the importation of African slaves into\r\nAmerica, had the effect of preventing more suffering than it inflicted,\r\nit was good, both in the motive and the result. I freely admit that, it\r\nis hardly possible to justify morally, those who begun and carried on\r\nthe slave trade. No speculation of future good to be brought about,\r\ncould compensate the enormous amount of evil it occasioned.\r\n\r\nIf we should refer to the common moral sense of mankind, as determined\r\nby their conduct in all ages and countries, for a standard of morality,\r\nit would seem to be in favor of slavery. The will of God, as determined\r\nby utility, would be an infallible standard, if we had an unerring\r\nmeasure of utility. The utilitarian philosophy, as it is commonly\r\nunderstood, referring only to the animal wants and employments, and\r\nphysical condition of man, is utterly false and degrading. If a\r\nsufficiently extended definition be given to utility, so as to include\r\nevery thing that may be a source of enjoyment or suffering, it is for\r\nthe most part useless. How can you compare the pleasures resulting from\r\nthe exercise of the understanding, the taste and the imagination, with\r\nthe animal enjoyments of the senses--the gratification derived from a\r\nfine poem with that from a rich banquet? How are we to weigh the pains\r\nand enjoyments of one man highly cultivated and of great sensibility,\r\nagainst those of many men of blunter capacity for enjoyment or\r\nsuffering? And if we could determine with certainty in what utility\r\nconsists, we are so short-sighted with respect to consequences--the\r\nremote results of our best considered actions are so often wide of our\r\nanticipations, or contrary to them, that we should still be very much in\r\nthe dark. But though we cannot arrive at absolute certainty with respect\r\nto the utility of actions, it is always fairly matter of argument.\r\nThough an imperfect standard, it is the best we have, and perhaps the\r\nCreator did not intend that we should arrive at perfect certainty with\r\nregard to the morality of many actions. If, after the most careful\r\nexamination of consequences that we are able to make, with due distrust\r\nof ourselves, we impartially, and in good faith, decide for that which\r\nappears likely to produce the greatest good, we are free from moral\r\nguilt. And I would impress most earnestly, that with our imperfect and\r\nlimited faculties, and short-sighted as we are to the future, we can\r\nrarely, very rarely indeed, be justified in producing considerable\r\npresent evil or suffering, in the expectation of remote future good--if\r\nindeed this can ever be justified.\r\n\r\nIn considering this subject, I shall not regard it in the first instance\r\nin reference to the present position of the slaveholding States, or the\r\ndifficulties which lie in the way of their emancipating their slaves,\r\nbut as a naked, abstract question--whether it is better that the\r\ninstitution of praedial and domestic slavery should, or should not,\r\nexist in civilized society. And though some of my remarks may seem to\r\nhave such a tendency, let me not be understood as taking upon myself to\r\ndetermine that it is better that it should exist. God forbid that the\r\nresponsibility of deciding such a question should ever be thrown on me\r\nor my countrymen. But this I will say, and not without confidence, that\r\nit is in the power of no human intellect to establish the contrary\r\nproposition--that it is better it should not exist. This is probably\r\nknown but to one being, and concealed from human sagacity.\r\n\r\nThere have existed in various ages, and we now see existing in the\r\nworld, people in every stage of civilization, from the most barbarous to\r\nthe most refined. Man, as I have said, is not born to civilization. He\r\nis born rude and ignorant. But it will be, I suppose, admitted that it\r\nis the design of his Creator that he should attain to civilization: that\r\nreligion should be known, that the comforts and elegancies of life\r\nshould be enjoyed, that letters and arts should be cultivated; in short,\r\nthat there should be the greatest possible development of moral and\r\nintellectual excellence. It can hardly be necessary to say any thing of\r\nthose who have extolled the superior virtues and enjoyments of savage\r\nlife--a life of physical wants and sufferings, of continual insecurity,\r\nof furious passions and depraved vices. Those who have praised savage\r\nlife, are those who have known nothing of it, or who have become savages\r\nthemselves. But as I have said, so far as reason or universal experience\r\ninstruct us, the institution of slavery is an essential process in\r\nemerging from savage life. It must then produce good, and promote the\r\ndesigns of the Creator.\r\n\r\nI add further, _that slavery anticipates the benefits of civilization,\r\nand retards the evils of civilization_. The former part of this\r\nproposition has been so fully established by a writer of great power of\r\nthought--though I fear his practical conclusions will be found of\r\nlittle value--that it is hardly necessary to urge it.[237] Property--the\r\naccumulation of capital, as it is commonly called--is the first element\r\nof civilization. But to accumulate, or to use capital to any\r\nconsiderable extent, the combination of labor is necessary. In early\r\nstages of society, when people are thinly scattered over an extensive\r\nterritory, the labor necessary to extensive works cannot be commanded.\r\nMen are independent of each other. Having the command of abundance of\r\nland, no one will submit to be employed in the service of his neighbor.\r\nNo one, therefore, can employ more capital than he can use with his own\r\nhands, or those of his family, nor have an income much beyond the\r\nnecessaries of life. There can, therefore, be little leisure for\r\nintellectual pursuits, or means of acquiring the comforts or elegancies\r\nof life. It is hardly necessary to say, however, that if a man has the\r\ncommand of slaves, he may combine labor, and use capital to any required\r\nextent, and therefore accumulate wealth. He shows that no colonies have\r\nbeen successfully planted without some sort of slavery. So we find the\r\nfact to be. It is only in the slaveholding States of our Confederacy,\r\nthat wealth can be acquired by agriculture--which is the general\r\nemployment of our whole country. Among us, we know that there is no one,\r\nhowever humble his beginning, who, with persevering industry,\r\nintelligence, and orderly and virtuous habits, may not attain to\r\nconsiderable opulence. So far as wealth has been accumulated in the\r\nStates which do not possess slaves, it has been in cities by the\r\npursuits of commerce, or lately, by manufactures. But the products of\r\nslave labor furnish more than two-thirds of the materials of our foreign\r\ncommerce, which the industry of those States is employed in transporting\r\nand exchanging; and among the slaveholding States is to be found the\r\ngreat market for all the productions of their industry, of whatever\r\nkind. The prosperity of those States, therefore, and the civilization of\r\ntheir cities, have been for the most part created by the existence of\r\nslavery. Even in the cities, but for a class of population, which our\r\ninstitutions have marked as servile, it would be scarcely possible to\r\npreserve the ordinary habitudes of civilized life, by commanding the\r\nnecessary menial and domestic service.\r\n\r\nEvery stage of human society, from the most barbarous to the most\r\nrefined, has its own peculiar evils to mark it as the condition of\r\nmortality; and perhaps there is none but omnipotence who can say in\r\nwhich the scale of good or evil most preponderates. We need say nothing\r\nof the evils of savage life. There is a state of society elevated\r\nsomewhat above it, which is to be found in some of the more thinly\r\npeopled portions of our own country--the rudest agricultural\r\nstate--which is thus characterized by the author to whom I have\r\nreferred: \"The American of the back woods has often been described to\r\nthe English as grossly ignorant, dirty, unsocial, delighting in rum and\r\ntobacco, attached to nothing but his rifle, adventurous, restless, more\r\nthan half savage. Deprived of social enjoyments or excitements, he has\r\nrecourse to those of savage life, and becomes (for in this respect the\r\nAmericans degenerate) unfit for society.\" This is no very inviting\r\npicture, which, though exaggerated, we know not to be without likeness.\r\nThe evils of such a state, I suppose, will hardly be thought compensated\r\nby unbounded freedom, perfect equality, and ample means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nBut let us take another stage in the progress--which to many will appear\r\nto offer all that is desirable in existence, and realize another Utopia.\r\nLet us suppose a state of society in which all shall have property, and\r\nthere shall be no great inequality of property--in which society shall\r\nbe so much condensed as to afford the means of social intercourse,\r\nwithout being crowded, so as to create difficulty in obtaining the means\r\nof subsistence--in which every family that chooses may have as much land\r\nas will employ its own hands, while others may employ their industry in\r\nforming such products as it may be desirable to exchange with them.\r\nSchools are generally established, and the rudiments of education\r\nuniversally diffused. Religion is taught, and every village has its\r\nchurch, neat, though humble, lifting its spire to heaven. Here is a\r\nsituation apparently the most favorable to happiness. I say\r\n_apparently_, for the greatest source of human misery is not in external\r\ncircumstances, but in men themselves--in their depraved inclinations,\r\ntheir wayward passions and perverse wills. Here is room for all the\r\npetty competition, the envy, hatred, malice and dissimulation that\r\ntorture the heart in what may be supposed the most sophisticated states\r\nof society; and though less marked and offensive, there may be much of\r\nthe licentiousness.\r\n\r\nBut apart from this, in such a condition of society, if there is little\r\nsuffering, there is little high enjoyment. The even flow of life forbids\r\nthe high excitement which is necessary for it. If there is little vice,\r\nthere is little place for the eminent virtues, which employ themselves\r\nin controlling the disorders and remedying the evils of society, which,\r\nlike war and revolution, call forth the highest powers of man, whether\r\nfor good or for evil. If there is little misery, there is little room\r\nfor benevolence. Useful public institutions we may suppose to be\r\ncreated, but not such as are merely ornamental. Elegant arts can be\r\nlittle cultivated, for there are no means to reward the artists; nor the\r\nhigher literature, for no one will have leisure or means to cultivate it\r\nfor its own sake. Those who acquire what may be called liberal\r\neducation, will do so in order to employ it as the means of their own\r\nsubsistence or advancement in a profession, and literature itself will\r\npartake of the sordidness of trade. In short, it is plain that in such a\r\nstate of society, the moral and intellectual faculties cannot be\r\ncultivated to their highest perfection.\r\n\r\nBut whether that which I have described be the most desirable state of\r\nsociety or no, it is certain that it can not continue. Mutation and\r\nprogress is the condition of human affairs. Though retarded for a time\r\nby extraneous or accidental circumstances, the wheel must roll on. The\r\ntendency of population is to become crowded, increasing the difficulty\r\nof obtaining subsistence. There will be some without any property except\r\nthe capacity for labor. This they must sell to those who have the means\r\nof employing them, thereby swelling the amount of their capital, and\r\nincreasing inequality. The process still goes on. The number of laborers\r\nincreases until there is a difficulty in obtaining employment. Then\r\ncompetition is established. The remuneration of the laborer becomes\r\ngradually less and less; a larger and larger proportion of the product\r\nof his labor goes to swell the fortune of the capitalist; inequality\r\nbecomes still greater and more invidious, until the process ends in the\r\nestablishment of just such a state of things, as the same author\r\ndescribes as now existing in England. After a most imposing picture of\r\nher greatness and resources; of her superabounding capital, and all\r\npervading industry and enterprise; of her public institutions for\r\npurposes of art, learning and benevolence; her public improvements, by\r\nwhich intercourse is facilitated, and the convenience of man subserved;\r\nthe conveniences and luxuries of life enjoyed by those who are in\r\npossession of fortune, or have profitable employments; of all, in short,\r\nthat places her at the head of modern civilization, he proceeds to give\r\nthe reverse of the picture. And here I shall use his own words: \"The\r\nlaboring class compose the bulk of the people; the great body of the\r\npeople; the vast majority of the people--these are the terms by which\r\nEnglish writers and speakers usually describe those whose only property\r\nis their labor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of comprehensive words, the two most frequently used in English\r\npolitics, are distress and pauperism. After these, of expressions\r\napplied to the state of the poor, the most common are vice and misery,\r\nwretchedness, sufferings, ignorance, degradation, discontent, depravity,\r\ndrunkenness, and the increase of crime; with many more of the like\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on to give the details of this inequality and wretchedness, in\r\nterms calculated to sicken and appal one to whom the picture is new.\r\nThat he has painted strongly we may suppose; but there is ample\r\ncorroborating testimony, if such were needed, that the representation is\r\nsubstantially just. Where so much misery exists, there must of course be\r\nmuch discontent, and many have been disposed to trace the sources of the\r\nformer in vicious legislation, or the structure of government; and the\r\nauthor gives the various schemes, sometimes contradictory, sometimes\r\nludicrous, which projectors have devised as a remedy for all this evil\r\nto which flesh is heir. That ill-judged legislation may have sometimes\r\naggravated the general suffering, or that its extremity may be mitigated\r\nby the well-directed efforts of the wise and virtuous, there can be no\r\ndoubt. One purpose for which it has been permitted to exist is, that it\r\nmay call forth such efforts, and awaken powers and virtues which would\r\notherwise have slumbered for want of object. But remedy there is none,\r\nunless it be to abandon their civilization. This inequality, this vice,\r\nthis misery, this _slavery_, is the price of England's civilization.\r\nThey suffer the lot of humanity. But perhaps we may be permitted humbly\r\nto hope, that great, intense and widely spread as this misery\r\nundoubtedly is in reality, it may yet be less so than in appearance. We\r\ncan estimate but very, very imperfectly the good and evil of individual\r\ncondition, as of different states of society. Some unexpected solace\r\narises to alleviate the severest calamity. Wonderful is the power of\r\ncustom, in making the hardest condition tolerable; the most generally\r\nwretched life has circumstances of mitigation, and moments of vivid\r\nenjoyment, of which the more seemingly happy can scarcely conceive;\r\nthough the lives of individuals be shortened, the aggregate of existence\r\nis increased; even the various forms of death accelerated by want,\r\nfamiliarized to the contemplation, like death to the soldier on the\r\nfield of battle, may become scarcely more formidable than what we are\r\naccustomed to regard as nature's ordinary outlets of existence. If we\r\ncould perfectly analyze the enjoyments and sufferings of the most happy,\r\nand the most miserable man, we should perhaps be startled to find the\r\ndifference so much less than our previous impressions had led us to\r\nconceive. But it is not for us to assume the province of omniscience.\r\nThe particular theory of the author quoted, seems to be founded on an\r\nassumption of this sort--that there is a certain stage in the progress,\r\nwhen there is a certain balance between the demand for labor, and the\r\nsupply of it, which is more desirable than any other--when the territory\r\nis so thickly peopled that all can not own land and cultivate the soil\r\nfor themselves, but a portion will be compelled to sell their labor to\r\nothers; still leaving, however, the wages of labor high, and the laborer\r\nindependent. It is plain, however, that this would in like manner\r\npartake of the good and the evil of other states of society. There would\r\nbe less of equality and less rudeness, than in the early stages; less\r\ncivilization, and less suffering, than in the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is the competition for employment, which is the source of this misery\r\nof society, that gives rise to all excellence in art and knowledge. When\r\nthe demand for labor exceeds the supply, the services of the most\r\nordinarily qualified laborer will be eagerly retained. When the supply\r\nbegins to exceed, and competition is established, higher and higher\r\nqualifications will be required, until at length when it becomes very\r\nintense, none but the most consummately skillful can be sure to be\r\nemployed. Nothing but necessity can drive men to the exertions which are\r\nnecessary so to qualify themselves. But it is not in arts, merely\r\nmechanical alone, that this superior excellence will be required. It\r\nwill be extended to every intellectual employment; and though this may\r\nnot be the effect in the instance of every individual, yet it will fix\r\nthe habits and character of the society, and prescribe everywhere, and\r\nin every department, the highest possible standard of attainment.\r\n\r\nBut how is it that the existence of slavery, as with us, will retard the\r\nevils of civilization? Very obviously. It is the intense competition of\r\ncivilized life, that gives rise to the excessive cheapness of labor, and\r\nthe excessive cheapness of labor is the cause of the evils in question.\r\nSlave labor can never be so cheap as what is called free labor.\r\nPolitical economists have established as the natural standard of wages\r\nin a fully peopled country, the value of the laborer's existence. I\r\nshall not stop to inquire into the precise truth of this proposition. It\r\ncertainly approximates the truth. Where competition is intense, men will\r\nlabor for a bare subsistence, and less than a competent subsistence. The\r\nemployer of free laborers obtains their services during the time of\r\ntheir health and vigor, without the charge of rearing them from infancy,\r\nor supporting them in sickness or old age. This charge is imposed on the\r\nemployer of slave labor, who, therefore, pays higher wages, and cuts off\r\nthe principal source of misery--the wants and sufferings of infancy,\r\nsickness, and old age. Laborers too will be less skillful, and perform\r\nless work--enhancing the price of that sort of labor. The poor laws of\r\nEngland are an attempt--but an awkward and empirical attempt--to supply\r\nthe place of that which we should suppose the feelings of every human\r\nheart would declare to be a natural obligation--that he who has received\r\nthe benefit of the laborer's services during his health and vigor,\r\nshould maintain him when he becomes unable to provide for his own\r\nsupport. They answer their purpose, however, very imperfectly, and are\r\nunjustly and unequally imposed. There is no attempt to apportion the\r\nburden according to the benefit received--and perhaps there could be\r\nnone. This is one of the evils of their condition.\r\n\r\nIn periods of commercial revulsion and distress, like the present, the\r\ndistress, in countries of free labor, falls principally on the laborers.\r\nIn those of slave labor, it falls almost exclusively on the employer. In\r\nthe former, when a business becomes unprofitable, the employer dismisses\r\nhis laborers or lowers their wages. But with us, it is the very period\r\nat which we are least able to dismiss our laborers; and if we would not\r\nsuffer a further loss, we can not reduce their wages. To receive the\r\nbenefit of the services of which they are capable, we must provide for\r\nmaintaining their health and vigor. In point of fact, we know that this\r\nis accounted among the necessary expenses of management. If the income\r\nof every planter of the Southern States were permanently reduced\r\none-half, or even much more than that, it would not take one jot from\r\nthe support and comforts of the slaves. And this can never be materially\r\naltered, until they shall become so unprofitable that slavery must be of\r\nnecessity abandoned. It is probable that the accumulation of individual\r\nwealth will never be carried to quite so great an extent in a\r\nslaveholding country, as in one of free labor; but a consequence will\r\nbe, that there will be less inequality and less suffering.\r\n\r\n_Servitude_ is the condition of civilization. It was decreed, when the\r\ncommand was given, \"be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth,\r\nand subdue it,\" and when it was added, \"in the sweat of thy face shalt\r\nthou eat bread.\" And what human being shall arrogate to himself the\r\nauthority to pronounce that our form of it is worse in itself, or more\r\ndispleasing to God, than that which exists elsewhere? Shall it be said\r\nthat the servitude of other countries grows out of the exigency of their\r\ncircumstances, and therefore society is not responsible for it? But if\r\nwe know that in the progress of things it is to come, would it not seem\r\nthe part of wisdom and foresight, to make provision for it, and thereby,\r\nif we can, mitigate the severity of its evils? But the fact is not so.\r\nLet any one who doubts, read the book to which I have several times\r\nreferred, and he may be satisfied that it was forced upon us by the\r\nextremest exigency of circumstances, in a struggle for very existence.\r\nWithout it, it is doubtful whether a white man would be now existing on\r\nthis continent--certain, that if there were, they would be in a state of\r\nthe utmost destitution, weakness, and misery. It was forced on us by\r\nnecessity, and further fastened upon us by the superior authority of the\r\nmother country. I, for one, neither deprecate nor resent the gift. Nor\r\ndid we institute slavery. The Africans brought to us had been, speaking\r\nin the general, slaves in their own country, and only underwent a change\r\nof masters. In the countries of Europe, and the States of our\r\nConfederacy, in which slavery has ceased to exist, it was abolished by\r\npositive legislation. If the order of nature has been departed from, and\r\na forced and artificial state of things introduced, it has been, as the\r\nexperience of all the world declares, by them and not by us.\r\n\r\nThat there are great evils in a society where slavery exists, and that\r\nthe institution is liable to great abuse, I have already said. To say\r\notherwise, would be to say that they were not human. But the whole of\r\nhuman life is a system of evils and compensations. We have no reason to\r\nbelieve that the compensations with us are fewer, or smaller in\r\nproportion to the evils, than those of any other condition of society.\r\nTell me of an evil or abuse; of an instance of cruelty, oppression,\r\nlicentiousness, crime or suffering, and I will point out, and often in\r\nfive fold degree, an equivalent evil or abuse in countries where slavery\r\ndoes not exist.\r\n\r\nLet us examine without blenching, the actual and alleged evils of\r\nslavery, and the array of horrors which many suppose to be its universal\r\nconcomitants. It is said that the slave is out of the protection of the\r\nlaw; that if the law purports to protect him in life and limb, it is but\r\nimperfectly executed; that he is still subject to excessive labor,\r\ndegrading blows, or any other sort of torture, which a master pampered\r\nand brutalized by the exercise of arbitrary power, may think proper to\r\ninflict; he is cut off from the opportunity of intellectual, moral, or\r\nreligious improvement, and even positive enactments are directed against\r\nhis acquiring the rudiments of knowledge; he is cut off forever from the\r\nhope of raising his condition in society, whatever may be his merit,\r\ntalents, or virtues, and therefore deprived of the strongest incentive\r\nto useful and praiseworthy exertion; his physical degradation begets a\r\ncorresponding moral degradation: he is without moral principle, and\r\naddicted to the lowest vices, particularly theft and falsehood; if\r\nmarriage be not disallowed, it is little better than a state of\r\nconcubinage, from which results general licentiousness, and the want of\r\nchastity among females--this indeed is not protected by law, but is\r\nsubject to the outrages of brutal lust; both sexes are liable to have\r\ntheir dearest affections violated; to be sold like brutes; husbands to\r\nbe torn from wives, children from parents;--this is the picture commonly\r\npresented by the denouncers of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat singular fact that when there existed in our State no\r\nlaw for punishing the murder of a slave, other than a pecuniary fine,\r\nthere were, I will venture to say, at least ten murders of freemen, for\r\none murder of a slave. Yet it is supposed they are all less protected,\r\nor less secure than their masters. Why they are protected by their very\r\nsituation in society, and therefore less need the protection of law.\r\nWith any other person than their master, it is hardly possible for them\r\nto come into such sort of collision as usually gives rise to furious and\r\nrevengeful passions; they offer no temptation to the murderer for gain;\r\nagainst the master himself, they have the security of his own interest,\r\nand by his superintendence and authority, they are protected from the\r\nrevengeful passions of each other. I am by no means sure that the cause\r\nof humanity has been served by the change in jurisprudence, which has\r\nplaced their murder on the same footing with that of a freeman. The\r\nchange was made in subserviency to the opinions and clamor of others who\r\nwere utterly incompetent to form an opinion on the subject; and a wise\r\nact is seldom the result of legislation in this spirit. From the fact\r\nwhich I have stated, it is plain that they less need protection. Juries\r\nare, therefore, less willing to convict, and it may sometimes happen\r\nthat the guilty will escape all punishment. _Security_ is one of the\r\ncompensations of their humble position. We challenge the comparison,\r\nthat with us there have been fewer murders of slaves, than of parents,\r\nchildren, apprentices, and other murders, cruel and unnatural, in\r\nsociety where slavery does not exist.\r\n\r\nBut short of life or limb, various cruelties may be practiced as the\r\npassions of the master may dictate. To this the same reply has been\r\noften given--that they are secured by the master's interest. If the\r\nstate of slavey is to exist at all, the master must have, and ought to\r\nhave, such power of punishment as will compel them to perform the duties\r\nof their station. And is not this for their advantage as well as his? No\r\nhuman being can be contented, who does not perform the duties of his\r\nstation. Has the master any temptation to go beyond this? If he inflicts\r\non him such punishment as will permanently impair his strength, he\r\ninflicts a loss on himself, and so if he requires of him excessive\r\nlabor. Compare the labor required of the slave, with those of the free\r\nagricultural or manufacturing laborer in Europe, or even in the more\r\nthickly peopled portions of the non-slaveholding States of our\r\nConfederacy--though these last are no fair subjects of comparison--they\r\nenjoying, as I have said, in a great degree, the advantages of slavery\r\nalong with those of an early and simple state of society. Read the\r\nEnglish Parliamentary reports, on the condition of the manufacturing\r\noperatives, and the children employed in factories. And such is the\r\nimpotence of man to remedy the evils which the condition of his\r\nexistence has imposed on him, that it is much to be doubted whether the\r\nattempts by legislation to improve their situation, will not aggravate\r\nits evils. They resort to this excessive labor as a choice of evils. If\r\nso, the amount of their compensation will be lessened also with the\r\ndiminished labor; for this is a matter which legislation can not\r\nregulate. Is it the part of benevolence then to cut them off even from\r\nthis miserable liberty of choice? Yet would these evils exist in the\r\nsame degree, if the laborers were the _property_ of the master--having a\r\ndirect interest in preserving their lives, their health and strength?\r\nWho but a driveling fanatic has thought of the necessity of protecting\r\ndomestic animals from the cruelty of their owners? And yet are not great\r\nand wanton cruelties practiced on these animals? Compare the whole of\r\nthe cruelties inflicted on slaves throughout our Southern country, with\r\nthose elsewhere, inflicted by ignorant and depraved portions of the\r\ncommunity, on those whom the relations of society put into their\r\npower--of brutal husbands on their wives; of brutal parents--subdued\r\nagainst the strongest instincts of nature to that brutality by the\r\nextremity of their misery--on their children; of brutal masters on\r\napprentices. And if it should be asked, are not similar cruelties\r\ninflicted, and miseries endured, in your society? I answer, in no\r\ncomparable degree. The class in question are placed under the control of\r\nothers, who are interested to restrain their excesses of cruelty or\r\nrage. Wives are protected from their husbands, and children from their\r\nparents. And this is no inconsiderable compensation of the evils of our\r\nsystem; and would so appear, if we could form any conception of the\r\nimmense amount of misery which is elsewhere thus inflicted. The other\r\nclass of society, more elevated in their position, are also (speaking of\r\ncourse in the general) more elevated in character, and more responsible\r\nto public opinion.\r\n\r\nBut besides the interest of their master, there is another security\r\nagainst cruelty. The relation of master and slave, when there is no\r\nmischievous interference between them, is, as the experience of all the\r\nworld declares, naturally one of kindness. As to the fact, we should be\r\nheld interested witnesses, but we appeal to universal nature. Is it not\r\nnatural that a man should be attached to that which is _his own_, and\r\nwhich has contributed to his convenience, his enjoyment, or his vanity?\r\nThis is felt even toward animals and inanimate objects. How much more\r\ntoward a being of superior intelligence and usefulness, who can\r\nappreciate our feelings towards him, and return them? Is it not natural\r\nthat we should be interested in that which is dependent on us for\r\nprotection and support? Do not men everywhere contract kind feelings\r\ntoward their dependents? Is it not natural that men should be more\r\nattached to those whom they have long known,--whom, perhaps, they have\r\nreared or been associated with from infancy--than to one with whom their\r\nconnection has been casual and temporary? What is there in our\r\natmosphere or institutions, to produce a perversion of the general\r\nfeelings of nature? To be sure, in this as in all other relations, there\r\nis frequent cause of offense or excitement--on one side, for some\r\nomission of duty, on the other, on account of reproof or punishment\r\ninflicted. But this is common to the relation of parent and child; and I\r\nwill venture to say, that if punishment be justly inflicted--and there\r\nis no temptation to inflict it unjustly--it is as little likely to\r\noccasion permanent estrangement or resentment as in that case. Slaves\r\nare perpetual children. It is not the common nature of man, unless it be\r\ndepraved by his own misery, to delight in witnessing pain. It is more\r\ngrateful to behold contented and cheerful beings, than sullen and\r\nwretched ones. That men are sometimes wayward, depraved and brutal, we\r\nknow. That atrocious and brutal cruelties have been perpetrated on\r\nslaves, and on those who were not slaves, by such wretches, we also\r\nknow. But that the institution of slavery has a natural tendency to form\r\nsuch a character, that such crimes are more common, or more aggravated\r\nthan in other states of society, or produce among us less surprise and\r\nhorror, we utterly deny, and challenge the comparison. Indeed, I have\r\nlittle hesitation in saying, that if full evidence could be obtained,\r\nthe comparison would result in our favor, and that the tendency of\r\nslavery is rather to humanize than to brutalize.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of travelers in oriental countries, give a very favorable\r\nrepresentation of the kindly relations which exist between the master\r\nand slave; the latter being often the friend, and sometimes the heir of\r\nthe former. Generally, however, especially if they be English\r\ntravelers--if they say any thing which may seem to give a favorable\r\ncomplexion to slavery, they think it necessary to enter their protest,\r\nthat they shall not be taken to give any sanction to slavery as it\r\nexists in America. Yet human nature is the same in all countries. There\r\nare very obvious reasons why in those countries there should be a nearer\r\napproach to equality in their manners. The master and slave are often of\r\ncognate races, and therefore tend more to assimilate. There is, in fact,\r\nless inequality in mind and character, where the master is but\r\nimperfectly civilized. Less labor is exacted, because the master has\r\nfewer motives to accumulate. But is it an injury to a human being, that\r\nregular, if not excessive labor, should be required of him? The primeval\r\ncurse, with the usual benignity of providential contrivance, has been\r\nturned into the solace of an existence that would be much more\r\nintolerable without it. If they labor less, they are much more subject\r\nto the outrages of capricious passions. If it were put to the choice of\r\nany human being, would he prefer to be the slave of a civilized man, or\r\nof a barbarian or semi-barbarian? But if the general tendency of the\r\ninstitution in those countries is to create kindly relations, can it be\r\nimagined why it should operate differently in this? It is true, as\r\nsuggested by President Dew--with the exception of the ties of close\r\nconsanguinity, it forms one of the most intimate relations of society.\r\nAnd it will be more and more so, the longer it continues to exist. The\r\nharshest features of slavery were created by those who were strangers to\r\nslavery--who supposed that it consisted in keeping savages in subjection\r\nby violence and terror. The severest laws to be found on our statute\r\nbook, were enacted by such, and such are still found to be the severest\r\nmasters. As society becomes settled, and the wandering habits of our\r\ncountrymen altered, there will be a larger and larger proportion of\r\nthose who were reared by the owner, or derived to him from his\r\nancestors, and who therefore will be more and more intimately regarded,\r\nas forming a portion of his family.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the slave is driven to labor by stripes; and if the\r\nobject of punishment be to produce obedience or reformation, with the\r\nleast permanent injury, it is the best method of punishment. But is it\r\nnot intolerable, that a being formed in the image of his Maker, should\r\nbe degraded by _blows_? This is one of the perversions of mind and\r\nfeeling, to which I shall have occasion again to refer. Such punishment\r\nwould be degrading to a freeman, who had the thoughts and aspirations of\r\na freeman. In general, it is not degrading to a slave, nor is it felt\r\nto be so. The evil is the bodily pain. Is it degrading to a child? Or if\r\nin any particular instance it would be so felt, it is sure not to be\r\ninflicted--unless in those rare cases which constitute the startling and\r\neccentric evils, from which no society is exempt, and against which no\r\ninstitution of society can provide.\r\n\r\n_The slave is cut off from the means of intellectual, moral, and\r\nreligious improvement, and in consequence his moral character becomes\r\ndepraved, and he addicted to degrading vices._ The slave receives such\r\ninstruction as qualifies him to discharge the duties of his particular\r\nstation. The Creator did not intend that every individual human being\r\nshould be highly cultivated, morally and intellectually, for, as we have\r\nseen, he has imposed conditions on society which would render this\r\nimpossible. There must be general mediocrity, or the highest cultivation\r\nmust exist along with ignorance, vice, and degradation. But is there in\r\nthe aggregate of society, less opportunity for intellectual and moral\r\ncultivation, on account of the existence of slavery? We must estimate\r\ninstitutions from their aggregate of good or evil. I refer to the views\r\nwhich I have before expressed to this society. It is by the existence of\r\nslavery, exempting so large a portion of our citizens from the necessity\r\nof bodily labor, that we have a greater proportion than any other\r\npeople, who have leisure for intellectual pursuits, and the means of\r\nattaining a liberal education. If we throw away this opportunity, we\r\nshall be morally responsible for the neglect or abuse of our advantages,\r\nand shall most unquestionably pay the penalty. But the blame will rest\r\non ourselves, and not on the character of our institutions.\r\n\r\nI add further, notwithstanding that _equality_ seems to be the passion\r\nof the day, if, as Providence has evidently decreed, there can be but a\r\ncertain portion of intellectual excellence in any community, it is\r\nbetter that it should be _unequally_ divided. It is better that a part\r\nshould be fully and highly cultivated, and the rest utterly ignorant. To\r\nconstitute a society, a variety of offices must be discharged, from\r\nthose requiring but the lowest degree of intellectual power, to those\r\nrequiring the very highest, and it should seem that the endowments ought\r\nto be apportioned according to the exigencies of the situation. In the\r\ncourse of human affairs, there arise difficulties which can only be\r\ncomprehended or surmounted by the strongest native power of intellect,\r\nstrengthened by the most assiduous exercise, and enriched with the most\r\nextended knowledge--and even these are sometimes found inadequate to the\r\nexigency. The first want of society is--leaders. Who shall estimate the\r\nvalue to Athens, of Solon, Aristides, Themistocles, Cymon, or Pericles?\r\nIf society have not leaders qualified, as I have said, they will have\r\nthose who will lead them blindly to their loss and ruin. Men of no great\r\nnative power of intellect, and of imperfect and superficial knowledge,\r\nare the most mischievous of all--none are so busy, meddling, confident,\r\npresumptuous, and intolerant. The whole of society receives the benefit\r\nof the exertions of a mind of extraordinary endowments. Of all\r\ncommunities, one of the least desirable, would be that in which\r\nimperfect, superficial, half-education should be universal. The first\r\ncare of a State which regards its own safety, prosperity, and honor,\r\nshould be, that when minds of extraordinary power appear, to whatever\r\ndepartment of knowledge, art or science, their exertions may be\r\ndirected, the means should be provided for their most consummate\r\ncultivation. Next to this, that education should be as widely extended\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nOdium has been cast upon our legislation, on account of its forbidding\r\nthe elements of education to be communicated to slaves. But, in truth,\r\nwhat injury is done to them by this? He who works during the day with\r\nhis hands, does not read in intervals of leisure for his amusement, or\r\nthe improvement of his mind--or the exceptions are so very rare, as\r\nscarcely to need the being provided for. Of the many slaves whom I have\r\nknown capable of reading, I have never known one to read any thing but\r\nthe Bible, and this task they impose on themselves as matter of duty. Of\r\nall methods of religious instruction, however, this, of reading for\r\nthemselves, would be the most inefficient--their comprehension is\r\ndefective, and the employment is to them an unusual and laborious one.\r\nThere are but very few who do not enjoy other means more effectual for\r\nreligious instruction. There is no place of worship opened for the white\r\npopulation, from which they are excluded. I believe it a mistake, to say\r\nthat the instructions there given are not adapted to their\r\ncomprehension, or calculated to improve them. If they are given as they\r\nought to be--practically, and without pretension, and are such as are\r\ngenerally intelligible to the free part of the audience, comprehending\r\nall grades of intellectual capacity,--they will not be unintelligible to\r\nslaves. I doubt whether this be not better than instruction, addressed\r\nspecially to themselves--which they might look upon as a devise of the\r\nmaster's, to make them more obedient and profitable to himself. Their\r\nminds, generally, show a strong religious tendency, and they are fond of\r\nassuming the office of religious instructors to each other; and perhaps\r\ntheir religious notions are not much more extravagant than those of a\r\nlarge portion of the free population of our country. I am not sure that\r\nthere is a much smaller proportion of them, than of the free population,\r\nwho make some sort of religious profession. It is certainly the master's\r\n_interest_ that they should have proper religious sentiments, and if he\r\nfails in his duty toward them, we may be sure that the consequences will\r\nbe visited not upon them, but upon him.\r\n\r\nIf there were any chance of their elevating their rank and condition in\r\nsociety, it might be matter of hardship, that they should be debarred\r\nthose rudiments of knowledge which open the way to further attainments.\r\nBut this they know can not be, and that further attainments would be\r\nuseless to them. Of the evil of this, I shall speak hereafter. A\r\nknowledge of reading, writing, and the elements of arithmetic, is\r\nconvenient and important to the free laborer, who is the transactor of\r\nhis own affairs, and the guardian of his own interests--but of what use\r\nwould they be to the slave? These alone do not elevate the mind or\r\ncharacter, if such elevation were desirable.\r\n\r\nIf we estimate their morals according to that which should be the\r\nstandard of a free man's morality, then I grant they are degraded in\r\nmorals--though by no means to the extent which those who are\r\nunacquainted with the institution seem to suppose. We justly suppose,\r\nthat the Creator will require of man the performance of the duties of\r\nthe station in which his providence has placed him, and the cultivation\r\nof the virtues which are adapted to their performance; that he will make\r\nallowance for all imperfection of knowledge, and the absence of the\r\nusual helps and motives which lead to self-correction and improvement.\r\nThe degradation of morals relate principally to loose notions of\r\nhonesty, leading to petty thefts; to falsehood and to licentious\r\nintercourse between the sexes. Though with respect even to these, I\r\nprotest against the opinion which seems to be elsewhere entertained,\r\nthat they are universal, or that slaves, in respect to them, might not\r\nwell bear a comparison with the lowest laborious class of other\r\ncountries. But certainly there is much dishonesty leading to petty\r\nthefts. It leads, however, to nothing else. They have no contracts or\r\ndealings which might be a temptation to fraud, nor do I know that their\r\ncharacters have any tendency that way. They are restrained by the\r\nconstant, vigilant, and interested superintendence which is exercised\r\nover them, from the commission of offenses of greater magnitude--even if\r\nthey were disposed to them--which I am satisfied they are not. Nothing\r\nis so rarely heard of, as an atrocious crime committed by a slave;\r\nespecially since they have worn off the savage character which their\r\nprogenitors brought with them from Africa. Their offenses are confined\r\nto petty depredations, principally for the gratification of their\r\nappetites, and these for reasons already given, are chiefly confined to\r\nthe property of their owner, which is most exposed to them. They could\r\nmake no use of a considerable booty, if they should obtain it. It is\r\nplain that this is a less evil to society in its consequences and\r\nexample, than if committed by a freeman, who is master of his own time\r\nand actions. With reference to society then, the offense is less in\r\nitself--and may we not hope that it is less in the sight of God? A slave\r\nhas no hope that by a course of integrity, he can materially elevate his\r\ncondition in society, nor can his offense materially depress it, or\r\naffect his means of support, or that of his family. Compared to the\r\nfreeman, he has no character to establish or to lose. He has not been\r\nexercised to self-government, and being without intellectual resources,\r\ncan less resist the solicitations of appetite. Theft in a freeman is a\r\ncrime; in a slave, it is a vice. I recollect to have heard it said, in\r\nreference to some question of a slave's theft which was agitated in a\r\nCourt, \"Courts of Justice have no more to do with a slave's stealing,\r\nthan with his lying--that is a matter for the domestic forum.\" It was\r\ntruly said--the theft of a slave is no offense against society. Compare\r\nall the evils resulting from this, with the enormous amount of vice,\r\ncrime, and depravity, which in an European, or one of our Northern\r\ncities, disgusts the moral feelings, and render life and property\r\ninsecure. So with respect to his falsehood. I have never heard or\r\nobserved, that slaves have any peculiar proclivity to falsehood, unless\r\nit be in denying or concealing their own offenses, or those of their\r\nfellows. I have never heard of falsehood told by a slave for a\r\nmalicious purpose. Lies of vanity are sometimes told, as among the weak\r\nand ignorant of other conditions. Falsehood is not attributed to an\r\nindividual charged with an offense before a Court of Justice, who pleads\r\n_not guilty_--and certainly the strong temptation to escape punishment,\r\nin the highest degree extenuates, if it does not excuse, falsehood told\r\nby a _slave_. If the object be to screen a a fellow slave, the act bears\r\nsome semblance of fidelity, and perhaps truth could not be told without\r\nbreach of confidence. I know not how to characterize the falsehood of a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said by the denouncers of slavery, that marriage does\r\nnot exist among slaves. It is difficult to understand this, unless\r\nwillful falsehood were intended. We know that marriages are contracted;\r\nmay be, and often are, solemnized with the forms usual among other\r\nclasses of society, and often faithfully adhered to during life. The law\r\nhas not provided for making those marriages indissoluble, nor could it\r\ndo so. If a man abandons his wife, being without property, and being\r\nboth property themselves, he cannot be required to maintain her. If he\r\nabandons his wife, and lives in a state of concubinage with another, the\r\nlaw cannot punish him for bigamy. It may perhaps be meant that the\r\nchastity of wives is not protected by law from the outrages of violence.\r\nI answer, as with respect to their lives, that they are protected by\r\nmanners, and their position. Who ever heard of such outrages being\r\noffered? At least as seldom, I will venture to say, as in other\r\ncommunities of different forms of polity. One reason doubtless may be,\r\nthat often there is no disposition to resist. Another reason also may\r\nbe, that there is little temptation to such violence, as there is so\r\nlarge a proportion of this class of females who set little value on\r\nchastity, and afford easy gratification to the hot passions of men. It\r\nmight be supposed, from the representations of some writers, that a\r\nslaveholding country was one wide stew for the indulgence of unbridled\r\nlust. Particular instances of intemperate and shameless debauchery are\r\nrelated, which may perhaps be true, and it is left to be inferred that\r\nthis is the universal state of manners. Brutes and shameless debauchees\r\nthere are in every country; we know that if such things are related as\r\ngeneral or characteristic, the representation is false. Who would argue\r\nfrom the existence of a Col. Chartres in England, or of some individuals\r\nwho might, perhaps, be named in other portions of this country, of the\r\nhorrid dissoluteness of manners occasioned by the want of the\r\ninstitution of slavery? Yet the argument might be urged quite as fairly,\r\nand really it seems to me with a little more justice--for there such\r\ndepravity is attended with much more pernicious consequences. Yet let us\r\nnot deny or extenuate the truth. It is true that in this respect the\r\nmorals of this class are very loose, (by no means so universally so as\r\nis often supposed,) and that the passions of men of the superior caste,\r\ntempt and find gratification in the easy chastity of the females. This\r\nis evil, and to be remedied, if we can do so, without the introduction\r\nof greater evil. But evil is incident to every condition of society, and\r\nas I have said, we have only to consider in which institution it most\r\npredominates.\r\n\r\nCompare these prostitutes of our country, (if it is not injustice to\r\ncall them so,) and their condition with those of other countries--the\r\nseventy thousand prostitutes of London, or of Paris, or the ten thousand\r\nof New York, or our other Northern cities. Take the picture given of the\r\nfirst from the author whom I have before quoted. \"The laws and customs\r\nof England conspire to sink this class of English women into a state of\r\nvice and misery below that which necessarily belongs to their condition.\r\nHence their extreme degradation, their troopers' oaths, their love of\r\ngin, their desperate recklessness, and the shortness of their miserable\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\"English women of this class, or rather girls, for few of them live to\r\nbe women, die like sheep with the rot; so fast that soon there would be\r\nnone left, if a fresh supply were not obtained equal to the number of\r\ndeaths. But a fresh supply is always obtained without the least trouble;\r\nseduction easily keeps pace with prostitution or mortality. Those that\r\ndie are, like factory children that die, instantly succeeded by new\r\ncompetitors for misery and death.\" There is no hour of a summer's or a\r\nwinter's night, in which there may not be found in the streets a ghastly\r\nwretch, expiring under the double tortures of disease and famine. Though\r\nless aggravated in its features, the picture of prostitution in New York\r\nor Philadelphia would be of like character.\r\n\r\nIn such communities, the unmarried woman who becomes a mother, is an\r\noutcast from society--and though sentimentalists lament the hardship of\r\nthe case, it is justly and necessarily so. She is cut off from the hope\r\nof useful and profitable employment, and driven by necessity to further\r\nvice. Her misery, and the hopelessness of retrieving, render her\r\ndesperate, until she sinks into every depth of depravity, and is\r\nprepared for every crime that can contaminate and infest society. She\r\nhas given birth to a human being, who, if it be so unfortunate as to\r\nsurvive its miserable infancy, is commonly educated to a like course of\r\nvice, depravity, and crime.\r\n\r\nCompare with this the female slave under similar circumstances. She is\r\nnot a less useful member of society than before. If shame be attached to\r\nher conduct, it is such shame as would be elsewhere felt for a venial\r\nimpropriety. She has not impaired her means of support, nor materially\r\nimpaired her character, or lowered her station in society; she has done\r\nno great injury to herself, or any other human being. Her offspring is\r\nnot a burden but an acquisition to her owner; his support is provided\r\nfor, and he is brought up to usefulness; if the fruit of intercourse\r\nwith a freeman, his condition is, perhaps, raised somewhat above that of\r\nhis mother. Under these circumstances, with imperfect knowledge, tempted\r\nby the strongest of human passions--unrestrained by the motives which\r\noperate to restrain, but are so often found insufficient to restrain the\r\nconduct of females elsewhere, can it be matter of surprise that she\r\nshould so often yield to the temptation? Is not the evil less in itself,\r\nand in reference to society--much less in the sight of God and man? As\r\nwas said of theft--the want of chastity, which among females of other\r\ncountries is sometimes vice, sometimes crime--among the free of our own,\r\nmuch more aggravated; among slaves, hardly deserves a harsher term than\r\nthat of weakness. I have heard of complaint made by a free prostitute,\r\nof the greater countenance and indulgence shown by society toward\r\ncolored persons of her profession, (always regarded as of an inferior\r\nand servile class, though individually free,) than to those of her own\r\ncomplexion. The former readily obtain employment; are even admitted into\r\nfamilies, and treated with some degree of kindness and familiarity,\r\nwhile any approach to intercourse with the latter is shunned as\r\ncontamination. The distinction is habitually made, and it is founded on\r\nthe unerring instinct of nature. The colored prostitute is, in fact, a\r\nfar less contaminated and depraved being. Still many, in spite of\r\ntemptation, do preserve a perfectly virtuous conduct, and I imagine it\r\nhardly ever entered into the mind of one of these, that she was likely\r\nto be forced from it by authority or violence.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, if we have no prostitutes from the free class of\r\nsociety among ourselves. I answer, in no assignable proportion. With\r\ngeneral truth, it might be said, that there are none. When such a case\r\noccurs, it is among the rare evils of society. And apart from other and\r\nbetter reasons, which we believe to exist, it is plain that it must be\r\nso, from the comparative absence of temptation. Our brothels,\r\ncomparatively very few--and these should not be permitted to exist at\r\nall--are filled, for the most part, by importations from the cities of\r\nour confederate States, where slavery does not exist. In return for the\r\nbenefits which they receive from our slavery, along with tariffs,\r\nlibels, opinions, moral, religious, or political--they furnish us also\r\nwith a supply of thieves and prostitutes. Never, but in a single\r\ninstance, have I heard of an imputation on the general purity of\r\nmanners, among the free females of the slaveholding States. Such an\r\nimputation, however, and made in coarse terms, we have never heard\r\nhere--_here_ where divorce was never known--where no court was ever\r\npolluted by an action for criminal conversation with a wife--where it is\r\nrelated rather as matter of tradition, not unmingled with wonder, that a\r\nCarolinian woman of education and family, proved false to her conjugal\r\nfaith--an imputation deserving only of such reply as self-respect would\r\nforbid us to give, if respect for the author of it did not. And can it\r\nbe doubted, that this purity is caused by, and is a compensation for the\r\nevils resulting from the existence of an enslaved class of more relaxed\r\nmorals?\r\n\r\nIt is mostly the warm passions of youth, which give rise to licentious\r\nintercourse. But I do not hesitate to say, that the intercourse which\r\ntakes place with enslaved females, is less depraving in its effects,\r\nthan when it is carried on with females of their own caste. In the first\r\nplace, as like attracts like, that which is unlike repels; and though\r\nthe strength of passion be sufficient to overcome the repulsion, still\r\nthe attraction is less. He feels that he is connecting himself with one\r\nof an inferior and servile caste, and that there is something of\r\ndegradation in the act. The intercourse is generally casual; he does not\r\nmake her habitually an associate, and is less likely to receive any\r\ntaint from her habits and manners. He is less liable to those\r\nextraordinary fascinations, with which worthless women sometimes\r\nentangle their victims, to the utter destruction of all principle, worth\r\nand vigor of character. The female of his own race offers greater\r\nallurements. The haunts of vice often present a show of elegance, and\r\nvarious luxury tempts the senses. They are made an habitual resort, and\r\ntheir inmates associates, till the general character receives a taint\r\nfrom the corrupted atmosphere. Not only the practice is licentious, but\r\nthe understanding is sophisticated; the moral feelings are bewildered,\r\nand the boundaries of virtue and vice are confused. Where such\r\nlicentiousness very extensively prevails, society is rotten to the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBut is it a small compensation for the evils attending the relation of\r\nthe sexes among the enslaved class, that they have universally the\r\nopportunity of indulging in the first instinct of nature, by forming\r\nmatrimonial connections? What painful restraint--what constant effort to\r\nstruggle against the strongest impulses are habitually practiced\r\nelsewhere, and by other classes? And they must be practiced, unless\r\ngreater evils would be encountered. On the one side, all the evils of\r\nvice, with the miseries to which it leads--on the other, a marriage\r\ncursed and made hateful by want--the sufferings of children, and\r\nagonizing apprehensions concerning their future fate. Is it a small good\r\nthat the slave is free from all this? He knows that his own subsistance\r\nis secure, and that his children will be in as good a condition as\r\nhimself. To a refined and intellectual nature, it may not be difficult\r\nto practice the restraint of which I have spoken. But the reasoning from\r\nsuch to the great mass of mankind, is most fallacious. To these, the\r\nsupply of their natural and physical wants, and the indulgence of the\r\nnatural domestic affections, must, for the most part, afford the\r\ngreatest good of which they are capable. To the evils which sometimes\r\nattend their matrimonial connections, arising from their looser\r\nmorality, slaves, for obvious reasons, are comparatively insensible. I\r\nam no apologist of vice, nor would I extenuate the conduct of the\r\nprofligate and unfeeling, who would violate the sanctity of even these\r\nengagements, and occasion the pain which such violations no doubt do\r\noften inflict. Yet such is the truth, and we can not make it otherwise.\r\nWe know that a woman's having been before a mother, is very seldom\r\nindeed an objection to her being made a wife. I know perfectly well how\r\nthis will be regarded by a class of reasoners or declaimers, as imposing\r\na character of deeper horror on the whole system; but still, I will say,\r\nthat if they are to be exposed to the evil, it is mercy that the\r\nsensibility to it should be blunted. Is it no compensation also for the\r\nvices incident to slavery, that they are, to a great degree, secured\r\nagainst the temptation to greater crimes, and more atrocious vices, and\r\nthe miseries which attend them; against their own disposition to\r\nindolence, and the profligacy which is its common result?\r\n\r\nBut if they are subject to the vices, they have also the virtues of\r\nslaves. Fidelity--often proof against all temptation--even death\r\nitself--an eminently cheerful and social temper--what the Bible imposes\r\nas a duty, but which might seem an equivocal virtue in the code of\r\nmodern morality--submission to constituted authority, and a disposition\r\nto be attached to, as well as to respect those, whom they are taught to\r\nregard as superiors. They may have all the knowledge which will make\r\nthem useful in the station in which God has been pleased to place them,\r\nand may cultivate the virtues which will render them acceptable to him.\r\nBut what has the slave of any country to do with heroic virtues, liberal\r\nknowledge, or elegant accomplishments? It is for the master; arising out\r\nof his situation--imposed on him as duty--dangerous and disgraceful if\r\nneglected--to compensate for this, by his own more assidious\r\ncultivation, of the more generous virtues, and liberal attainments.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed one of the great evils of slavery, that it affords\r\nthe slave no opportunity of raising himself to a higher rank in society,\r\nand that he has, therefore, no inducement to meritorious exertion, or\r\nthe cultivation of his faculties. The indolence and carelessnes of the\r\nslave, and the less productive quality of his neighbor, are traced to\r\nthe want of such excitement. The first compensation for this\r\ndisadvantage, is his security. If he can rise no higher, he is just in\r\nthe same degree secured against the chances of falling lower. It has\r\nbeen sometimes made a question whether it were better for man to be\r\nfreed from the perturbations of hope and fear, or to be exposed to their\r\nvicissitudes. But I suppose there could be little question with respect\r\nto a situation, in which the fears must greatly predominate over the\r\nhopes. And such, I apprehend, to be the condition of the laboring poor\r\nin countries where slavery does not exist. If not exposed to present\r\nsuffering, there is continual apprehension for the future--for\r\nthemselves--for their children--of sickness and want, if not of actual\r\nstarvation. They expect to improve their circumstances! Would any person\r\nof ordinary candor, say that there is one in a hundred of them, who\r\ndoes not well know, that with all the exertion he can make, it is out of\r\nhis power materially to improve his circumstances? I speak not so much\r\nof menial servants, who are generally of a superior class, as of\r\nagricultural and manufacturing laborers. They labor with no such view.\r\nIt is the instinctive struggle to preserve existence, and when the\r\nsuperior efficiency of their labor over that of our slaves is pointed\r\nout, as being animated by a free man's hopes, might it not well be\r\nreplied--it is because they labor under a sterner compulsion. The laws\r\ninterpose no obstacles to their raising their condition in society. 'Tis\r\na great boon--but as to the great mass, they know that they never will\r\nbe able to raise it--and it should seem not very important in effect,\r\nwhether it be the interdict of law, or imposed by the circumstances of\r\nthe society. One in a thousand is successful. But does his success\r\ncompensate for the sufferings of the many who are tantalized, baffled,\r\nand tortured in vain attempts to attain a like result? If the individual\r\nbe conscious of intellectual power, the suffering is greater. Even where\r\nsuccess is apparently attained, he sometimes gains it but to die--or\r\nwith all capacity to enjoy it exhausted--worn out in the struggle with\r\nfortune. If it be true that the African is an inferior variety of the\r\nhuman race, of less elevated character, and more limited intellect, is\r\nit not desirable that the inferior laboring class should be made up of\r\nsuch, who will conform to their condition without painful aspirations\r\nand vain struggles?\r\n\r\nThe slave is certainly liable to be sold. But, perhaps, it may be\r\nquestioned, whether this is a greater evil than the liability of the\r\nlaborer, in fully peopled countries, to be dismissed by his employer,\r\nwith the uncertainty of being able to obtain employment, or the means of\r\nsubsistence elsewhere. With us, the employer can not dismiss his laborer\r\nwithout providing him with another employer. His means of subsistence\r\nare secure, and this is a compensation for much. He is also liable to be\r\nseparated from wife and child--though not more frequently, that I am\r\naware of, than the exigency of their condition compels the separation of\r\nfamilies among the labering poor elsewhere--but from native character\r\nand temperament, the separation is much less severely felt. And it is\r\none of the compensations, that he may sustain these relations, without\r\nsuffering a still severer penalty for the indulgence.\r\n\r\nThe love of liberty is a noble passion--to have the free, uncontrolled\r\ndisposition of ourselves, our words and actions. But alas! it is one in\r\nwhich we know that a large portion of the human race can never be\r\ngratified. It is mockery, to say that the laborer any where has such\r\ndisposition of himself--though there may be an approach to it in some\r\npeculiar, and those, perhaps, not the most desirable, states of society.\r\nBut unless he be properly disciplined and prepared for its enjoyment, it\r\nis the most fatal boon that could be conferred--fatal to himself and\r\nothers. If slaves have less freedom of action than other laborers, which\r\nI by no means admit, they are saved in a great degree from the\r\nresponsibility of self-government, and the evils springing from their\r\nown perverse wills. Those who have looked most closely into life, and\r\nknow how great a portion of human misery is derived from these\r\nsources--the undecided and wavering purpose--producing ineffectual\r\nexertion, or indolence with its thousand attendant evils--the wayward\r\nconduct--intemperance or profligacy--will most appreciate this benefit.\r\nThe line of a slave's duty is marked out with precision, and he has no\r\nchoice but to follow it. He is saved the double difficulty, first of\r\ndetermining the proper course for himself, and then of summoning up the\r\nenergy which will sustain him in pursuing it.\r\n\r\nIf some superior power should impose on the laborious poor of any other\r\ncountry--this as their unalterable condition--you shall be saved from\r\nthe torturing anxiety concerning your own future support, and that of\r\nyour children, which now pursues you through life, and haunts you in\r\ndeath--you shall be under the necessity of regular and healthful, though\r\nnot excessive labor--in return, you shall have the ample supply of your\r\nnatural wants--you may follow the instinct of nature in becoming\r\nparents, without apprehending that this supply will fail yourselves or\r\nyour children--you shall be supported and relieved in sickness, and in\r\nold age, wear out the remains of existence among familiar scenes and\r\naccustomed associates, without being driven to beg, or to resort to the\r\nhard and miserable charity of a work-house--you shall of necessity be\r\ntemperate, and shall have neither the temptation nor opportunity to\r\ncommit great crimes, or practice the more destructive vices--how\r\ninappreciable would the boon be thought! And is not this a very near\r\napproach to the condition of our slaves? The evils of their situation\r\nthey but lightly feel, and would hardly feel at all, if they were not\r\nseduously instructed into sensibility. Certain it is, that if their fate\r\nwere at the absolute disposal of a council of the most enlightened\r\nphilanthropists in Christendom, with unlimited resources, they could\r\nplace them in no situation so favorable to themselves, as that which\r\nthey at present occupy. But whatever good there may be, or whatever\r\nmitigation of evil, it is worse than valueless, because it is the result\r\nof _slavery_.\r\n\r\nI am aware, that however often answered, it is likely to be repeated\r\nagain and again--how can that institution be tolerable, by which a large\r\nclass of society is cut off from the hope of improvement in knowledge;\r\nto whom blows are not degrading; theft no more than a fault; falsehood\r\nand the want of chastity almost venial, and in which a husband or parent\r\nlooks with comparative indifference, on that which, to a freeman, would\r\nbe the dishonor of a wife or child?\r\n\r\nBut why not, if it produces the greatest aggregate of good? Sin and\r\nignorance are only evils, because they lead to misery. It is not our\r\ninstitution, but the institution of nature, that in the progress of\r\nsociety a portion of it should be exposed to want, and the misery which\r\nit brings, and therefore involved in ignorance, vice, and depravity. In\r\nanticipating some of the good, we also anticipate a portion of the evil\r\nof civilization. But we have it in a mitigated form. The want and the\r\nmisery are unknown; the ignorance is less a misfortune, because the\r\nbeing is not the guardian of himself, and partly on account of that\r\ninvoluntary ignorance, the vice is less vice--less hurtful to man, and\r\nless displeasing to God.\r\n\r\nThere is something in this word _slavery_ which seems to partake of the\r\nqualities of the insane root, and distempers the minds of men. That\r\nwhich would be true in relation to one predicament, they misapply to\r\nanother, to which it has no application at all. Some of the virtues of a\r\nfreeman would be the vices of slaves. To submit to a blow, would be\r\ndegrading to a freeman, because he is the protector of himself. It is\r\nnot degrading to a slave--neither is it to a priest or woman. And is it\r\na misfortune that it should be so? The freeman of other countries is\r\ncompelled to submit to indignities hardly more endurable than\r\nblows--indignities to make the sensitive feelings shrink, and the proud\r\nheart swell; and this very name of freeman gives them double rancor. If\r\nwhen a man is born in Europe, it were certainly foreseen that he was\r\ndestined to a life of painful labor--to obscurity, contempt, and\r\nprivation--would it not be mercy that he should be reared in ignorance\r\nand apathy, and trained to the endurance of the evils he must encounter?\r\nIt is not certainly foreseen as to any individual, but it is foreseen as\r\nto the great mass of those born of the laboring poor; and it is for the\r\nmass, not for the exception, that the institutions of society are to\r\nprovide. Is it not better that the character and intellect of the\r\nindividual should be suited to the station which he is to occupy? Would\r\nyou do a benefit to the horse or the ox, by giving him a cultivated\r\nunderstanding or fine feelings? So far as the mere laborer has the\r\npride, the knowledge, or the aspirations of a freeman, he is unfitted\r\nfor his situation, and must doubly feel its infelicity. If there are\r\nsordid, servile, and laborious offices to be performed, is it not better\r\nthat there should be sordid, servile, and laborious beings to perform\r\nthem? If there were infallible marks by which individuals of inferior\r\nintellect, and inferior character, could be selected at their\r\nbirth--would not the interests of society be served, and would not some\r\nsort of fitness seem to require, that they should be selected for the\r\ninferior and servile offices? And if this race be generally marked by\r\nsuch inferiority, is it not fit that they should fill them?\r\n\r\nI am well aware that those whose aspirations are after a state of\r\nsociety from which evil shall be banished, and who look in life for that\r\nwhich life will never afford, contemplate that all the offices of life\r\nmay be performed without contempt or degradation--all be regarded as\r\nequally liberal, or equally respected.[238] But theorists cannot control\r\nnature and bend her to their views, and the inequality of which I have\r\nbefore spoken is deeply founded in nature. The offices which employ\r\nknowledge and intellect, will always be regarded as more liberal than\r\nthose which require the labor of the hands. When there is competition\r\nfor employment, he who gives it bestows a favor, and it will be so\r\nreceived. He will assume superiority from the power of dismissing his\r\nlaborers, and from fear of this, the latter will practice deference,\r\noften amounting to servility. Such in time will become the established\r\nrelation between the employer and the employed, the rich and the poor.\r\nIf want be accompanied with sordidness and squalor, though it be\r\npitied, the pity will be mixed with some degree of contempt. If it lead\r\nto misery, and misery to vice, there will be disgust and aversion.\r\n\r\nWhat is the essential character of _slavery_, and in what does it differ\r\nfrom the _servitude_ of other countries? If I should venture on a\r\ndefinition, I should say that where a man is compelled to labor at the\r\nwill of another, and to give him much the greater portion of the product\r\nof his labor, there _slavery_ exists; and it is immaterial by what sort\r\nof compulsion the will of the laborer is subdued. It is what no human\r\nbeing would do without some sort of compulsion. He can not be compelled\r\nto labor by blows.[239] No--but what difference does it make, if you can\r\ninflict any other sort of torture which will be equally effectual in\r\nsubduing the will? if you can starve him, or alarm him for the\r\nsubsistence of himself or his family?[240] And is it not under this\r\ncompulsion that the _freeman_ labors? I do not mean in every particular\r\ncase, but in the general. Will any one be hardy enough to say that he is\r\nat his own disposal, or has the government of himself? True, he may\r\nchange his employer if he is dissatisfied with his conduct toward him;\r\nbut this is a privilege he would in the majority of cases gladly\r\nabandon, and render the connection between them indissoluble. There is\r\nfar less of the interest and attachment in his relation to his employer,\r\nwhich so often exists between the master and the slave, and mitigates\r\nthe condition of the latter. An intelligent English traveler has\r\ncharacterized as the most miserable and degraded of all beings, \"a\r\nmasterless slave.\" And is not the condition of the laboring poor of\r\nother countries too often that of masterless slaves! Take the following\r\ndescription of a _free_ laborer, no doubt highly colored, quoted by the\r\nauthor to whom I have before referred.\r\n\r\n\"What is that defective being, with calfless legs and stooping\r\nshoulders, weak in body and mind, inert, pusillanimous and stupid, whose\r\npremature wrinkles and furtive glance, tell of misery and degradation?\r\nThat is an English peasant or pauper, for the words are synonymous. His\r\nsire was a pauper, and his mother's milk wanted nourishment. From\r\ninfancy his food has been bad, as well as insufficient; and he now feels\r\nthe pains of unsatisfied hunger nearly whenever he is awake. But half\r\nclothed, and never supplied with more warmth than suffices to cook his\r\nscanty meals, cold and wet come to him, and stay by him with the\r\nweather. He is married, of course; for to this he would have been driven\r\nby the poor laws, even if he had been, as he never was, sufficiently\r\ncomfortable and prudent to dread the burden of a family. But though\r\ninstinct and the overseer have given him a wife, he has not tasted the\r\nhighest joys of husband and father. His partner and his little ones\r\nbeing like himself, often hungry, seldom warm, sometimes sick without\r\naid, and always sorrowful without hope, are greedy, selfish, and vexing;\r\nso, to use his own expression, he hates the sight of them, and resorts\r\nto his hovel, only because a hedge affords less shelter from the wind\r\nand rain. Compelled by parish law to support his family, which means to\r\njoin them in consuming an allowance from the parish, he frequently\r\nconspires with his wife to get that allowance increased, or prevent its\r\nbeing diminished. This brings beggary, trickery, and quarrelling, and\r\nends in settled craft. Though he have the inclination, he wants the\r\ncourage to become, like more energetic men of his class, a poacher or\r\nsmuggler on a large scale, but he pilfers occasionally, and teaches his\r\nchildren to lie and steal. His subdued and slavish manner toward his\r\ngreat neighbors, shows that they treat him with suspicion and harshness.\r\nConsequently, he at once dreads and hates them; but he will never harm\r\nthem by violent means. Too degraded to be desperate, he is only\r\nthoroughly depraved. His miserable career will be short; rheumatism and\r\nasthma are conducting him to the work-house; where he will breathe his\r\nlast without one pleasant recollection, and so make room for another\r\nwretch, who may live and die in the same way.\" And this description, or\r\nsome other not much less revolting, is applied to \"the bulk of the\r\npeople, the great body of the people.\" Take the following description of\r\nthe condition of childhood, which has justly been called eloquent.[241]\r\n\r\n\"The children of the very poor have no young times; it makes the very\r\nheart bleed, to overhear the casual street talk between a poor woman and\r\nher little girl, a woman of the better sort of poor, in a condition\r\nrather above the squalid beings we have been contemplating. It is not\r\nof toys, of nursery books, of summer holidays, (fitting that age,) of\r\nthe promised sight or play; of praised sufficiency at school. It is of\r\nmangling and clear starching; of price of coals, or of potatoes. The\r\nquestions of the child, that should be the very outpourings of curiosity\r\nin idleness, are marked with forecast and melancholy providence. It has\r\ncome to be a woman, before it was a child. It has learnt to go to\r\nmarket; it chaffers, it haggles, it envies, it murmurs; it is knowing,\r\nacute, sharpened; it never prattles.\" Imagine such a description applied\r\nto the children of negro slaves, the most vacant of human beings, whose\r\nlife is a holiday.\r\n\r\nAnd this people, to whom these horrors are familiar, are those who fill\r\nthe world with clamor, concerning the injustice and cruelty of slavery.\r\nI speak in no invidious spirit. Neither the laws nor the government of\r\nEngland are to be reproached with the evils which are inseparable from\r\nthe state of their society--as little, undoubtedly, are we to be\r\nreproached with the existence of our slavery. Including the whole of the\r\nUnited States--and for reasons already given, the whole ought to be\r\nincluded, as receiving in no unequal degree the benefit--may we not say\r\njustly that we have less slavery, and more mitigated slavery, than any\r\nother country in the civilized world?\r\n\r\nThat they are called free, undoubtedly aggravates the sufferings of the\r\nslaves of other regions. They see the enormous inequality which exists,\r\nand feel their own misery, and can hardly conceive otherwise, than that\r\nthere is some injustice in the institutions of society to occasion\r\nthese. They regard the apparently more fortunate class as oppressors,\r\nand it adds bitterness that they should be of the same name and race.\r\nThey feel indignity more acutely, and more of discontent and evil\r\npassion is excited; they feel that it is mockery that calls them free.\r\nMen do not so much hate and envy those who are separated from them by a\r\nwide distance, and some apparently impassable barrier, as those who\r\napproach nearer to their own condition, and with whom they habitually\r\nbring themselves into comparison. The slave with us is not tantalized\r\nwith the name of freedom, to which his whole condition gives the lie,\r\nand would do so if he were emancipated to-morrow. The African slave sees\r\nthat nature herself has marked him as a separate--and if left to\r\nhimself, I have no doubt he would feel it to be an inferior--race, and\r\ninterposed a barrier almost insuperable to his becoming a member of the\r\nsame society, standing on the same footing of right and privilege with\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nThat the African negro is an inferior variety of the human race, is, I\r\nthink, now generally admitted, and his distinguishing characteristics\r\nare such as peculiarly mark him out for the situation which he occupies\r\namong us. And these are no less marked in their original country, than\r\nas we have daily occasion to observe them. The most remarkable is their\r\nindifference to personal liberty. In this they have followed their\r\ninstincts since we have any knowledge of their continent, by enslaving\r\neach other; but contrary to the experience of every race, the possession\r\nof slaves has no material effect in raising the character, and promoting\r\nthe civilization of the master. Another trait is the want of domestic\r\naffections, and insensibility to the ties of kindred. In the travels of\r\nthe Landers, after speaking of a single exception, in the person of a\r\nwoman who betrayed some transient emotion in passing by the country from\r\nwhich she had been torn as a slave, the authors add: \"that Africans,\r\ngenerally speaking, betray the most perfect indifference on losing their\r\nliberty, and being deprived of their relatives, while love of country is\r\nequally a stranger to their breasts, as social tenderness or domestic\r\naffection.\" \"Marriage is celebrated by the natives as unconcernedly as\r\npossible; a man thinks as little of taking a wife, as of cutting an ear\r\nof corn--affection is altogether out of the question.\" They are,\r\nhowever, very submissive to authority, and seem to entertain great\r\nreverence for chiefs, priests, and masters. No greater indignity can be\r\noffered an individual, than to throw opprobrium on his parents. On this\r\npoint of their character I think I have remarked, that, contrary to the\r\ninstinct of nature in other races, they entertain less regard for\r\nchildren than for parents, to whose authority they have been accustomed\r\nto submit. Their character is thus summed up by the travellers quoted:\r\n\"The few opportunities we have had of studying their characters, induce\r\nus to believe that they are a simple, honest, inoffensive, but weak,\r\ntimid, and cowardly race. They seem to have no social tenderness, very\r\nfew of those amiable private virtues which could win our affections, and\r\nnone of those public qualities that claim respect or command admiration.\r\nThe love of country is not strong enough in their bosoms to incite them\r\nto defend it against a despicable foe; and of the active energy, noble\r\nsentiments, and contempt of danger which distinguishes the North\r\nAmerican tribes and other savages, no traces are to be found among this\r\nslothful people. Regardless of the past, as reckless of the future, the\r\npresent alone influences their actions. In this respect, they approach\r\nnearer to the nature of the brute creation, than perhaps any other\r\npeople on the face of the globe.\" Let me ask if this people do not\r\nfurnish the very material out of which slaves ought to be made, and\r\nwhether it be not an improving of their condition to make them the\r\nslaves of civilized masters? There is a variety in the character of the\r\ntribes. Some are brutally and savagely ferocious and bloody, whom it\r\nwould be mercy to enslave. From the travelers' account, it seems not\r\nunlikely that the negro race is tending to extermination, being daily\r\nencroached on and overrun by the superior Arab race. It may be, that\r\nwhen they shall have been lost from their native seats, they may be\r\nfound numerous, and in no unhappy condition, on the continent to which\r\nthey have been transplanted.\r\n\r\nThe opinion which connects form and features with character and\r\nintellectual power, is one so deeply impressed on the human mind, that\r\nperhaps there is scarcely any man who does not almost daily act upon it,\r\nand in some measure verify its truth. Yet in spite of this intimation of\r\nnature, and though the anatomist and physiologist may tell them that the\r\nraces differ in every bone and muscle, and in the proportion of brain\r\nand nerves, yet there are some who, with a most bigoted and fanatical\r\ndetermination to free themselves from what they have prejudged to be\r\nprejudice, will still maintain that this physiognomy, evidently tending\r\nto that of the brute, when compared to that of the Caucasian race, may\r\nbe enlightened by as much thought, and animated by as lofty sentiment.\r\nWe who have the best opportunity of judging, are pronounced to be\r\nincompetent to do so, and to be blinded by our interest and\r\nprejudices--often by those who have no opportunity at all--and we are to\r\nbe taught to distrust or disbelieve that which we daily observe, and\r\nfamiliarly know, on such authority. Our prejudices are spoken of. But\r\nthe truth is, that, until very lately, since circumstances have\r\ncompelled us to think for ourselves, we took our opinions on this\r\nsubject, as on every other, ready formed from the country of our origin.\r\nAnd so deeply rooted were they, that we adhered to them, as most men\r\nwill do to deeply rooted opinions, even against the evidence of our own\r\nobservation, and our own senses. If the inferiority exists, it is\r\nattributed to the apathy and degradation produced by slavery. Though of\r\nthe hundreds of thousand scattered over other countries, where the laws\r\nimpose no disability upon them, none has given evidence of an approach\r\nto even mediocrity of intellectual excellence; this, too, is attributed\r\nto the slavery of a portion of their race. They are regarded as a\r\nservile caste, and degraded by opinion, and thus every generous effort\r\nis repressed. Yet though this should be the general effect, this very\r\nestimation is calculated to produce the contrary effect in particular\r\ninstances. It is observed by Bacon, with respect to deformed persons and\r\neunuchs, that though in general there is something of perversity in the\r\ncharacter, the disadvantage often leads to extraordinary displays of\r\nvirtue and excellence. \"Whoever hath any thing fixed in his person that\r\ndoth induce contempt, hath also a perpetual spur in himself, to rescue\r\nand deliver himself from scorn.\" So it would be with them, if they were\r\ncapable of European aspirations--genius, if they possessed it, would be\r\ndoubly fired with noble rage to rescue itself from this scorn. Of\r\ncourse, I do not mean to say that there may not be found among them some\r\nof superior capacity to many white persons; but that great intellectual\r\npowers are, perhaps, never found among them, and that in general their\r\ncapacity is very limited, and their feelings animal and coarse--fitting\r\nthem peculiarly to discharge the lower, and merely mechanical offices of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nAnd why should it not be so? We have among domestic animals infinite\r\nvarieties, distinguished by various degrees of sagacity, courage,\r\nstrength, swiftness, and other qualities. And it may be observed, that\r\nthis is no objection to their being derived from a common origin, which\r\nwe suppose them to have had. Yet these accidental qualities, as they may\r\nbe termed, however acquired in the first instance, we know that they\r\ntransmit unimpaired to their posterity for an indefinite succession of\r\ngenerations. It is most important that these varieties should be\r\npreserved, and that each should be applied to the purposes for which it\r\nis best adapted. No philo-zoost, I believe, has suggested it as\r\ndesirable that these varieties should be melted down into one equal,\r\nundistinguished race of curs or road horses.\r\n\r\nSlavery, as it is said in an eloquent article published in a Southern\r\nperiodical work,[242] to which I am indebted for other ideas, \"has done\r\nmore to elevate a degraded race in the scale of humanity; to tame the\r\nsavage; to civilize the barbarous; to soften the ferocious; to enlighten\r\nthe ignorant, and to spread the blessings of Christianity among the\r\nheathen, than all the missionaries that philanthropy and religion have\r\never sent forth.\"[243] Yet unquestionable as this is, and though human\r\ningenuity and thought may be tasked in vain to devise any other means by\r\nwhich these blessings could have been conferred, yet a sort of\r\nsensibility which would be only mawkish and contemptible, if it were not\r\nmischievous, affects still to weep over the wrongs of \"injured Africa.\"\r\nCan there be a doubt of the immense benefit which has been conferred on\r\nthe race, by transplanting them from their native, dark, and barbarous\r\nregions, to the American continent and islands? There, three-fourths of\r\nthe race are in a state of the most deplorable personal slavery. And\r\nthose who are not, are in a scarcely less deplorable condition of\r\npolitical slavery, to barbarous chiefs--who value neither life nor any\r\nother human right, or enthralled by priests to the most abject and\r\natrocious superstitions. Take the following testimony of one of the few\r\ndisinterested observers, who has had an opportunity of observing them in\r\nboth situations.[244] \"The wild savage is the child of passion, unaided\r\nby one ray of religion or morality to direct his course, in consequence\r\nof which his existence is stained with every crime that can debase human\r\nnature to a level with the brute creation. Who can say that the slaves\r\nin our colonies are such? Are they not, by comparison with their still\r\nsavage brethren, enlightened beings? Is not the West Indian negro,\r\ntherefore, greatly indebted to his master for making him what he is--for\r\nhaving raised him from the state of debasement in which he was born, and\r\nplaced him in a scale of civilized society? How can he repay him? He is\r\npossessed of nothing--the only return in his power is his servitude. The\r\nman who has seen the wild African, roaming in his native woods, and the\r\nwell fed, happy looking negro of the West Indies, may, perhaps, be able\r\nto judge of their comparative happiness; the former, I strongly suspect,\r\nwould be glad to change his state of boasted freedom, starvation, and\r\ndisease, to become the slave of sinners, and the commiseration of\r\nsaints.\"[245] It was a useful and beneficent work, approaching the\r\nheroic, to tame the wild horse, and subdue him to the use of man; how\r\nmuch more to tame the nobler animal that is capable of reason, and\r\nsubdue him to usefulness?\r\n\r\nWe believe that the tendency of slavery is to elevate the character of\r\nthe master. No doubt the character--especially of youth--has sometimes\r\nreceived a taint and premature knowledge of vice, from the contact and\r\nassociation with ignorant and servile beings of gross manners and\r\nmorals. Yet still we believe that the entire tendency is to inspire\r\ndisgust and aversion toward their peculiar vices. It was not without a\r\nknowledge of nature, that the Spartans exhibited the vices of slaves by\r\nway of negative example to their children. We flatter ourselves that the\r\nview of this degradation, mitigated as it is, has the effect of making\r\nprobity more strict, the pride of character more high, the sense of\r\nhonor more strong, than is commonly found where this institution does\r\nnot exist. Whatever may be the prevailing faults or vices of the masters\r\nof slaves, they have not commonly been understood to be those of\r\ndishonesty, cowardice, meanness, or falsehood. And so most\r\nunquestionably it ought to be. Our institutions would indeed be\r\nintolerable in the sight of God and man, if, condemning one portion of\r\nsociety to hopeless ignorance and comparative degradation, they should\r\nmake no atonement by elevating the other class by higher virtues, and\r\nmore liberal attainments--if, besides degraded slaves, there should be\r\nignorant, ignoble, and degraded freemen. There is a broad and well\r\nmarked line, beyond which no slavish vice should be regarded with the\r\nleast toleration or allowance. One class is cut off from all interest in\r\nthe State--that abstraction so potent to the feelings of a generous\r\nnature. The other must make compensation by increased assiduity and\r\ndevotion to its honor and welfare. The love of wealth--so laudable when\r\nkept within proper limits, so base and mischievous when it exceeds\r\nthem--so infectious in its example--an infection to which I fear we\r\nhave been too much exposed--should be pursued by no arts in any degree\r\nequivocal, or at any risk of injustice to others. So surely as there is\r\na just and wise governor of the universe, who punishes the sins of\r\nnations and communities, as well as of individuals, so surely shall we\r\nsuffer punishment, if we are indifferent to that moral and intellectual\r\ncultivation of which the means are furnished to us, and to which we are\r\ncalled and incited by our situation.\r\n\r\nI would to heaven I could express, as I feel, the conviction how\r\nnecessary this cultivation is, not only to our prosperity and\r\nconsideration, but to our safety and very existence. We, the\r\nslaveholding States, are in a hopeless minority in our own confederated\r\nRepublic--to say nothing of the great confederacy of civilized States.\r\nIt is admitted, I believe, not only by slaveholders, but by others, that\r\nwe have sent to our common councils more than our due share of talent,\r\nhigh character and eloquence.[246] Yet in spite of all these most\r\nstrenuously exerted, measures have been sometimes adopted which we\r\nbelieved to be dangerous and injurious to us, and threatening to be\r\nfatal. What would be our situation, if, instead of these, we were only\r\nrepresented by ignorant and groveling men, incapable of raising their\r\nviews beyond a job or petty office, and incapable of commanding bearing\r\nor consideration? May I be permitted to advert--by no means\r\ninvidiously--to the late contest carried on by South Carolina against\r\nFederal authority, and so happily terminated by the moderation which\r\nprevailed in our public counsels. I have often reflected, what one\r\ncircumstance, more than any other, contributed to the successful issue\r\nof a contest, apparently so hopeless, in which one weak and divided\r\nState was arrayed against the whole force of the confederacy--unsustained,\r\nand uncountenanced, even by those who had a common interest with her. It\r\nseemed to me to be, that we had for leaders an unusual number of men of\r\ngreat intellectual power, co-operating cordially and in good faith, and\r\ncommanding respect and confidence at home and abroad, by elevated and\r\nhonorable character. It was from these that we--the followers at\r\nhome--caught hope and confidence in the gloomiest aspect of our affairs.\r\nThese, by their eloquence and the largeness of their views, at least\r\nshook the faith of the dominant majority in the wisdom and justice of\r\ntheir measures--or the practicability of carrying them into successful\r\neffect; and by their bearing and well known character, satisfied them\r\nthat South Carolina would do all that she had pledged herself to do.\r\nWithout these, how different might have been the result? And who shall\r\nsay what at this day would have been the aspect of the now flourishing\r\nfields and cities of South Carolina? Or rather, without these, it is\r\nprobable the contest would never have been begun; but that, without even\r\nthe animation of a struggle, we should have sunk silently into a\r\nhopeless and degrading subjection. While I have memory--in the extremity\r\nof age--in sickness--under all the reverses and calamities of life--I\r\nshall have one source of pride and consolation--that of having been\r\nassociated--according to my humbler position--with the noble spirits who\r\nstood prepared to devote themselves for Liberty--the Constitution--the\r\nUnion. May such character and such talent never be wanting to South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nI am sure that it is unnecessary to say to an assembly like this, that\r\nthe conduct of the master to his slave should be distinguished by the\r\nutmost humanity. That we should indeed regard them as wards and\r\ndependents on our kindness, for whose well-being in every way we are\r\ndeeply responsible. This is no less the dictate of wisdom and just\r\npolicy, than of right feeling. It is wise with respect to the services\r\nto be expected from them. I have never heard of an owner whose conduct\r\nin their management was distinguished by undue severity, whose slaves\r\nwere not in a great degree worthless to him. A cheerful and kindly\r\ndemeanor, with the expression of interest in themselves and their\r\naffairs, is, perhaps, calculated to have a better effect on them, than\r\nwhat might be esteemed more substantial favors and indulgences.\r\nThroughout nature, attachment is the reward of attachment. It is wise,\r\ntoo, in relation to the civilized world around us, to avoid giving\r\noccasion to the odium which is so industriously excited against\r\nourselves and our institutions. For this reason, public opinion should,\r\nif possible, bear even more strongly and indignantly than it does at\r\npresent, on masters who practice any wanton cruelty on their slaves. The\r\nmiscreant who is guilty of this, not only violates the law of God and of\r\nhumanity, but as far as in him lies, by bringing odium upon, endangers\r\nthe institutions of his country, and the safety of his countrymen. He\r\ncasts a shade upon the character of every individual of his\r\nfellow-citizens, and does every one of them a personal injury. So of him\r\nwho indulges in any odious excess of intemperate or licentious passion.\r\nIt is detached instances of this sort, of which the existence is,\r\nperhaps, hardly known among ourselves, that, collected with pertinacious\r\nand malevolent industry, affords the most formidable weapons to the\r\nmischievous zealots, who array them as being characteristic of our\r\ngeneral manners and state of society.\r\n\r\nI would by no means be understood to intimate, that a vigorous, as well\r\nas just government, should not be exercised over slaves. This is part of\r\nour duty toward them, no less obligatory than any other duty, and no\r\nless necessary toward their well-being than to ours. I believe that at\r\nleast as much injury has been done and suffering inflicted by weak and\r\ninjudicious indulgence, as by inordinate severity. He whose business is\r\nto labor, should be made to labor, and that with due diligence, and\r\nshould be vigorously restrained from excess or vice. This is no less\r\nnecessary to his happiness than to his usefulness. The master who\r\nneglects this, not only makes his slaves unprofitable to himself, but\r\ndiscontented and wretched--a nuisance to his neighbors and to society.\r\n\r\nI have said that the tendency of our institution is to elevate the\r\nfemale character, as well as that of the other sex, and for similar\r\nreasons. In other states of society, there is no well-defined limit to\r\nseparate virtue and vice. There are degrees of vice, from the most\r\nflagrant and odious, to that which scarcely incurs the censure of\r\nsociety. Many individuals occupy an unequivocal position and as society\r\nbecomes accustomed to this, there will be a less peremptory requirement\r\nof purity in female manners and conduct, and often the whole of the\r\nsociety will be in a tainted and uncertain condition with respect to\r\nfemale virtue. Here, there is that certain and marked line, above which\r\nthere is no toleration or allowance for any approach to license of\r\nmanners or conduct, and she who falls below it, will fall far below even\r\nthe slave. How many will incur this penalty?\r\n\r\nAnd permit me to say, that this elevation of the female character is no\r\nless important and essential to us, than the moral and intellectual\r\ncultivation of the other sex. It would indeed be intolerable, if, when\r\none class of the society is necessarily degraded in this respect, no\r\ncompensation were made by the superior elevation and purity of the\r\nother. Not only essential purity of conduct, but the utmost purity of\r\nmanners, and I will add, though it may incur the formidable charge of\r\naffectation or prudery,--a greater severity of decorum than is required\r\nelsewhere, is necessary among us. Always should be strenuously resisted\r\nthe attempts which have been sometimes made to introduce among us the\r\nfreedom of foreign European, and especially of continental manners. This\r\nfreedom, the remotest in the world from that which sometimes springs\r\nfrom simplicity of manners, is calculated and commonly intended to\r\nconfound the outward distinctions of virtue and vice. It is to prepare\r\nthe way for licentiousness--to produce this effect--that if those who\r\nare clothed with the outward color and garb of vice, may be well\r\nreceived by society, those who are actually guilty may hope to be so\r\ntoo. It may be said, that there is often perfect purity where there is\r\nvery great freedom of manners. And, I have no doubt, this may be true in\r\nparticular instances, but it is never true of any _society_ in which\r\nthis is the general state of manners. What guards can there be to\r\npurity, when every thing that _may possibly_ be done innocently, is\r\nhabitually practiced; when there can be no impropriety which is not\r\nvice. And what must be the depth of the depravity when there is a\r\ndeparture from that which they admit as principle. Besides, things which\r\nmay perhaps be practiced innocently where they are familiar, produce a\r\nmoral dilaceration in the course of their being introduced where they\r\nare new. Let us say, we will not have the manners of South Carolina\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nI have before said that free labor is cheaper than the labor of slaves,\r\nand so far as it is so the condition of the free laborer is worse. But\r\nI think President Dew has sufficiently shown that this is only true of\r\nNorthern countries. It is matter of familiar remark that the tendency of\r\nwarm climates is to relax the human constitution and indispose to labor.\r\nThe earth yields abundantly--in some regions almost spontaneously--under\r\nthe influence of the sun, and the means of supporting life are obtained\r\nwith but slight exertion; and men will use no greater exertion than is\r\nnecessary to the purpose. This very luxuriance of vegetation, where no\r\nother cause concurs, renders the air less salubrious, and even when\r\npositive malady does not exist, the health is habitually impaired.\r\nIndolence renders the constitution more liable to these effects of the\r\natmosphere, and these again aggravate the indolence. Nothing but the\r\ncoercion of slavery can overcome the repugnance to labor under these\r\ncircumstances, and by subduing the soil, improve and render wholesome\r\nthe climate.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that there does not now exist on the face of the\r\nearth, a people in a tropical climate, or one approaching to it, where\r\nslavery does not exist, that is in a state of high civilization, or\r\nexhibits the energies which mark the progress toward it. Mexico and the\r\nSouth American Republics,[247] starting on their new career of\r\nindependence, and having gone through a farce of abolishing slavery,\r\nare rapidly degenerating, even from semi-barbarism. The only portion of\r\nthe South American continent which seems to be making any favorable\r\nprogress, in spite of a weak and arbitrary civil government, is Brazil,\r\nin which slavery has been retained. Cuba, of the same race with the\r\ncontinental republics, is daily and rapidly advancing in industry and\r\ncivilization; and this is owing exclusively to her slaves. St. Domingo\r\nis struck out of the map of civilized existence, and the British West\r\nIndies will shortly be so. On the other continent, Spain and Portugal\r\nare degenerate, and their rapid progress is downward. Their southern\r\ncoast is infested by disease, arising from causes which industry might\r\nreadily overcome, but that industry they will never exert. Greece is\r\nstill barbarous, and scantily peopled. The work of an English physician,\r\ndistinguished by strong sense and power of observation,[248] gives a\r\nmost affecting picture of the condition of Italy,--especially south of\r\nthe Appenines. With the decay of industry, the climate has degenerated\r\ntoward the condition from which it was first rescued by the labor of\r\nslaves. There is poison in every man's veins, affecting the very springs\r\nof life, dulling or extinguishing, with the energies of the body, all\r\nenergy of mind, and often exhibiting itself in the most appalling forms\r\nof disease. From year to year the pestilential atmosphere creeps\r\nforward, narrowing the circles within which it is possible to sustain\r\nhuman life. With disease and misery, industry still more rapidly decays,\r\nand if the process goes on, it seems that Italy too will soon be ready\r\nfor another experiment in colonization.\r\n\r\nYet once it was not so, when Italy was possessed by the masters of\r\nslaves; when Rome contained her millions, and Italy was a garden; when\r\ntheir iron energies of body corresponded with the energies of mind which\r\nmade them conquerors in every climate and on every soil; rolled the tide\r\nof conquest, not as in later times, from the South to the North;\r\nextended their laws and their civilization, and created them lords of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n          \"What conflux issuing forth or entering in;\r\n          Prætors, pro-consuls to their provinces,\r\n          Hasting, or on return in robes of state.\r\n          Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power,\r\n          Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings:\r\n          Or embassies from regions far remote,\r\n          In various habits, on the Appian road,\r\n          Or on th' Emilian; some from furthest South,\r\n          Syene, and where the shadow both way falls,\r\n          Meroe, Nilotic isle, and more to West,\r\n          The realms of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea;\r\n          From th' Asian kings, and Parthian among these;\r\n          From India and the golden Chersonese,\r\n          And utmost India's isle, Taprobona,\r\n          Dusk faces, with white silken turbans wreathed;\r\n          From Gallia, Gades, and the British West;\r\n          Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians, North\r\n          Beyond Danubius to the Tauric Pool!\r\n          All nations now to Rome obedience pay.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was, and such is, the picture of Italy. Greece presents a contrast\r\nnot less striking. What is the cause of the great change? Many causes,\r\nno doubt, have occurred; but though\r\n\r\n          \"War, famine, pestilence, and flood and fire,\r\n          Have dealt upon the seven-hilled city's pride,\"\r\n\r\nI will venture to say that nothing has dealt upon it more heavily than\r\nthe loss of domestic slavery. Is not this evident? If they had slaves,\r\nwith an energetic civil government, would the deadly miasma be permitted\r\nto overspread the Campagna, and invade Rome herself? Would not the soil\r\nbe cultivated, and the wastes reclaimed? A late traveller[249] mentions\r\na canal, cut for miles through rock and mountain, for the purpose of\r\ncarrying off the waters of the lake of Celano, on which thirty thousand\r\nRoman slaves were employed for eleven years, and which remains almost\r\nperfect to the present day. This, the government of Naples was ten years\r\nin repairing with an hundred workmen. The imperishable works of Rome\r\nwhich remain to the present day were, for the most part, executed by\r\nslaves. How different would be the condition of Naples, if for her\r\nwretched lazzaroni were substituted negro slaves, employed in rendering\r\nproductive the plains whose fertility now serves only to infect the air!\r\n\r\nTo us, on whom this institution is fastened, and who could not shake it\r\noff, even if we desired to do so, the great republics of antiquity offer\r\ninstruction of inestimable value. They teach us that slavery is\r\ncompatible with the freedom, stability, and long duration of civil\r\ngovernment, with denseness of population, great power, and the highest\r\ncivilization. And in what respect does this modern Europe, which claims\r\nto give opinions to the world, so far excel them--notwithstanding the\r\nimmense advantages of the Christian religion and the discovery of the\r\nart of printing? They are not more free, nor have performed more\r\nglorious actions, nor displayed more exalted virtue. In the higher\r\ndepartments of intellect--in all that relates to taste and\r\nimagination--they will hardly venture to claim equality. Where they have\r\ngone beyond them in the results of mechanical philosophy, or discoveries\r\nwhich contribute to the wants and enjoyments of physical life, they have\r\ndone so by the help of means with which they were furnished by the\r\nGrecian mind--the mother of civilization--and only pursued a little\r\nfurther the tract which that had always pointed out. In the development\r\nof intellectual power, they will hardly bear comparison. Those noble\r\nrepublics in the pride of their strength and greatness, may have\r\nanticipated for themselves--as some of their poets did for them--an\r\neverlasting duration and predominance. But they could not have\r\nanticipated, that when they had fallen under barbarous arms, that when\r\narts and civilization were lost, and the whole earth in darkness--the\r\nfirst light should break from their tombs--that in a renewed world,\r\nunconnected with them by ties of locality, language or descent, they\r\nshould still be held the models of all that is profound in science, or\r\nelegant in literature, or all that is great in character, or elevated in\r\nimagination. And perhaps when England herself, who now leads the war\r\nwith which we are on all sides threatened, shall have fulfilled her\r\nmission, and like the other glorious things of the earth, shall have\r\npassed away; when she shall have diffused her noble race and noble\r\nlanguage, her laws, her literature, and her civilization, over all\r\nquarters of the earth, and shall perhaps be overrun by some Northern\r\nhorde--sunk into an ignoble and anarchical democracy,[250] or subdued to\r\nthe dominion of some Cæsar,--demagogue and despot,--then, in Southern\r\nregions, there may be found many republics, triumphing in Grecian arts\r\nand civilization, and worthy of British descent and Roman institutions.\r\n\r\nIf, after a time, when the mind and almost the memory of the republic\r\nwere lost, Romans degenerated, they furnish conclusive evidence that\r\nthis was owing not to their domestic, but to their political slavery.\r\nThe same thing is observed over all the Eastern monarchies; and so it\r\nmust be, wherever property is insecure, and it is dangerous for a man to\r\nrise himself to such eminence by intellectual or moral excellence, as\r\nwould give him influence over his society. So it is in Egypt; and the\r\nother regions bordering the Mediterranean, which once comprehended the\r\ncivilization of the world, where Carthage, Tyre, and Phoenicia\r\nflourished. In short, the uncontradicted experience of the world is,\r\nthat in the Southern States where good government and predial and\r\ndomestic slavery are found, there are prosperity and greatness; where\r\neither of these conditions is wanting, degeneracy and barbarism. The\r\nformer, however, is equally essential in all climates and under all\r\ninstitutions. And can we suppose it to be the design of the Creator,\r\nthat these regions, constituting half of the earth's surface, and the\r\nmore fertile half, and more capable of sustaining life, should be\r\nabandoned forever to depopulation and barbarism? Certain it is that they\r\nwill never be reclaimed by the labor of freemen. In our own country,\r\nlook at the lower valley of the Mississippi, which is capable of being\r\nmade a far greater Egypt. In our own State, there are extensive tracts\r\nof the most fertile soil, which are capable of being made to swarm with\r\nlife. These are at present pestilential swamps, and valueless, because\r\nthere is abundance of other fertile soil in more favorable situations,\r\nwhich demand all and more than all the labor which our country can\r\nsupply. Are these regions of fertility to be abandoned at once and\r\nforever to the alligator and tortoise--with here and there perhaps a\r\nmiserable, shivering, crouching _free_ black savage? Does not the finger\r\nof heaven itself seem to point to a race of men--not to be enslaved by\r\nus, but already enslaved, and who will be in every way benefited by the\r\nchange of masters--to whom such climate is not uncongenial, who, though\r\ndisposed to indolence, are yet patient and capable of labor, on whose\r\nwhole features, mind and character, nature has indelibly\r\nwritten--slave;--and indicate that we should avail ourselves of these in\r\nfulfilling the first great command to subdue and replenish the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this labor will be dearer than that of Northern\r\ncountries, where, under the name of freedom, they obtain cheaper and\r\nperhaps better slaves. Yet it is the best we can have, and this too has\r\nits compensation. We see it compensated at present by the superior value\r\nof our agricultural products. And this superior value they must probably\r\nalways have. The Southern climate admits of a greater variety of\r\nproductions. Whatever is produced in Northern climates, the same thing,\r\nor something equivalent, may be produced in the Southern. But the\r\nNorthern have no equivalent for the products of Southern climates. The\r\nconsequence will be, that the products of Southern regions will be\r\ndemanded all over the civilized world. The agricultural products of\r\nNorthern regions are chiefly for their own consumption. They must\r\ntherefore apply themselves to the manufacturing of articles of luxury,\r\nelegance, convenience, or necessity,--which requires cheap labor--for\r\nthe purpose of exchanging them with their Southern neighbors. Thus\r\nnature herself indicates that agriculture should be the predominating\r\nemployment in Southern countries, and manufactures in Northern. Commerce\r\nis necessary to both--but less indispensable to the Southern, which\r\nproduce within themselves a greater variety of things desirable to life.\r\nThey will therefore have somewhat less of the commercial spirit. We must\r\navail ourselves of such labor as we can command. The slave must labor,\r\nand is inured to it; while the necessity of energy in his government, of\r\nwatchfulness, and of preparation and power to suppress insurrection,\r\nadded to the moral force derived from the habit of command, may help to\r\nprevent the degeneracy of the master.\r\n\r\nThe task of keeping down insurrection is commonly supposed by those who\r\nare strangers to our institutions, to be a very formidable one. Even\r\namong ourselves, accustomed as we have been to take our opinions on this\r\nas on every other subject, ready formed from those whom we regarded as\r\ninstructors, in the teeth of our own observation and experience, fears\r\nhave been entertained which are absolutely ludicrous. We have been\r\nsupposed to be nightly reposing over a mine, which may at any instant\r\nexplode to our destruction. The first thought of a foreigner sojourning\r\nin one of our cities, who is awaked by any nightly alarm, is of servile\r\ninsurrection and massacre. Yet if any thing is certain in human affairs,\r\nit is certain and from the most obvious considerations, that we are more\r\nsecure in this respect than any civilived and fully peopled society upon\r\nthe face of the earth. In every such society, there is a much larger\r\nproportion than with us, of persons who have more to gain than to lose\r\nby the overthrow of government, and the embroiling of social order. It\r\nis in such a state of things that those who were before at the bottom of\r\nsociety, rise to the surface. From causes already considered, they are\r\npeculiarly apt to consider their sufferings the result of injustice and\r\nmisgovernment, and to be rancorous and embittered accordingly. They have\r\nevery excitement, therefore, of resentful passion, and every temptation\r\nwhich the hope of increased opulence, or power or consideration can hold\r\nout, to urge them to innovation and revolt. Supposing the same\r\ndisposition to exist in equal degree among our slaves, what are their\r\ncomparative means or prospect of gratifying it? The poor of other\r\ncountries are called free. They have, at least, no one interested to\r\nexercise a daily and nightly superintendence and control over their\r\nconduct and actions. Emissaries of their class may traverse, unchecked,\r\nevery portion of the country, for the purpose of organizing\r\ninsurrection. From their greater intelligence, they have greater means\r\nof communicating with each other. They may procure and secrete arms. It\r\nis not alone the ignorant, or those who are commonly called the poor,\r\nthat will be tempted to revolution. There will be many disappointed men,\r\nand men of desperate fortune--men perhaps of talent and daring--to\r\ncombine them and direct their energies. Even those in the higher ranks\r\nof society who contemplate no such result, will contribute to it, by\r\ndeclaiming on their hardships and rights.\r\n\r\nWith us, it is almost physically impossible that there should be any\r\nvery extensive combination among the slaves. It is absolutely impossible\r\nthat they should procure and conceal efficient arms. Their emissaries\r\ntraversing the country, would carry their commissions on their\r\nforeheads. If we suppose among them an individual of sufficient talent\r\nand energy to qualify him for a revolutionary leader, he could not be so\r\nextensively known as to command the confidence, which would be necessary\r\nto enable him to combine and direct them. Of the class of freemen, there\r\nwould be no individual so poor or degraded (with the exception perhaps\r\nof here and there a reckless and desperate outlaw and felon) who would\r\nnot have much to lose by the success of such an attempt; every one,\r\ntherefore, would be vigilant and active to detect and suppress it. Of\r\nall impossible things, one of the most impossible would be a successful\r\ninsurrecction of our slaves, originating with themselves.\r\n\r\nAttempts at insurrection have indeed been made--excited, as we believe,\r\nby the agitation of the abolitionists and declaimers on slavery; but\r\nthese have been in every instance promptly suppressed. We fear not to\r\ncompare the riots, disorder, revolt and bloodshed, which have been\r\ncommitted in our own, with those of any other civilized communities,\r\nduring the same lapse of time. And let it be observed under what\r\nextraordinary circumstances our peace has been preserved. For the last\r\nhalf century, one half of our population has been admonished in terms\r\nthe most calculated to madden and excite, that they are the victims of\r\nthe most grinding and cruel injustice and oppression. We know that these\r\nexhortations continually reach them, through a thousand channels which\r\nwe cannot detect, as if carried by the birds of the air--and what human\r\nbeing, especially when unfavorably distinguished by outward\r\ncircumstances, is not ready to give credit when he is told that he is\r\nthe victim of injustice and oppression? In effect, if not in terms, they\r\nhave been continually exhorted to insurrection. The master has been\r\npainted as a criminal, tyrant and robber, justly obnoxious to the\r\nvengeance of God and man, and they have been assured of the countenance\r\nand sympathy, if not of the active assistance, of all the rest of the\r\nworld. We ourselves have in some measure pleaded guilty to the\r\nimpeachment. It is not long since a great majority of our free\r\npopulation, servile to the opinions of those whose opinions they had\r\nbeen accustomed to follow, would have admitted slavery to be a great\r\nevil, unjust and indefensible in principle, and only to be vindicated by\r\nthe stern necessity which was imposed upon us. Thus stimulated by every\r\nmotive and passion which ordinarily actuate human beings--not as to a\r\ncriminal enterprise, but as to something generous and heroic--what has\r\nbeen the result? A few imbecile and uncombined plots--in every instance\r\ndetected before they broke out into action, and which perhaps if\r\nundetected would never have broken into action. One or two sudden,\r\nunpremeditated attempts, frantic in their character, if not prompted by\r\nactual insanity, and these instantly crushed. As it is, we are not less\r\nassured of safety, order, and internal peace, than any other people; and\r\nbut for the pertinacious and fanatical agitations of the subject, would\r\nbe much more so.\r\n\r\nThis experience of security, however, should admonish us of the folly\r\nand wickedness of those who have sometimes taken upon themselves to\r\nsupersede the regular course of law, and by rash and violent acts to\r\npunish supposed disturbers of the peace of society. This can admit of no\r\njustification or palliation whatever. Burke, I think, somewhere remarked\r\nsomething to this effect,--that when society is in the last stage of\r\ndepravity--when all parties are alike corrupt, and alike wicked and\r\nunjustifiable in their measures and objects, a good man may content\r\nhimself with standing neuter, a sad and disheartened spectator of the\r\nconflict between the rival vices. But are we in this wretched condition?\r\nIt is fearful to see with what avidity the worst and most dangerous\r\ncharacters of society seize on the occasion of obtaining the countenance\r\nof better men, for the purpose of throwing off the restraints of law. It\r\nis always these who are most zealous and forward in constituting\r\nthemselves the protectors of the public peace. To such men--men without\r\nreputation, or principle, or stake in society--disorder is the natural\r\nelement. In that, desperate fortunes and the want of all moral principle\r\nand moral feeling constitute power. They are eager to avenge themselves\r\nupon society. Anarchy is not so much the absence of government, as the\r\ngovernment of the worst--not aristocracy, but kakistocracy--a state of\r\nthings, which to the honor of our nature, has seldom obtained among men,\r\nand which perhaps was only fully exemplified during the worst times of\r\nthe French Revolution, when that horrid hell burnt with its most lurid\r\nflame. In such a state of things, to be accused is to be condemned--to\r\nprotect the innocent is to be guilty; and what perhaps is the worst\r\neffect, even men of better nature, to whom their own deeds are\r\nabhorrent, are goaded by terror to be forward and emulous in deeds of\r\nguilt and violence. The scenes of lawless violence which have been acted\r\nin some portions of our country, rare and restricted as they have been,\r\nhave done more to tarnish its reputation than a thousand libels. They\r\nhave done more to discredit, and if any thing could, to endanger, not\r\nonly our domestic, but our republican institutions, than the\r\nabolitionists themselves. Men can never be permanently and effectually\r\ndisgraced but by themselves, and rarely endangered but by their own\r\ninjudicious conduct, giving advantage to the enemy. Better, far better,\r\nwould it be to encounter the dangers with which we are supposed to be\r\nthreatened, than to employ such means for averting them. But the truth\r\nis, that in relation to this matter, so far as respects actual\r\ninsurrection, when alarm is once excited, danger is absolutely at an\r\nend. Society can then employ legitimate and more effectual measures for\r\nits own protection. The very commission of such deeds is proof that they\r\nare unnecessary. Let those who attempt them, then, or make any\r\ndemonstration toward them, understand that they will meet only the\r\ndiscountenance and abhorrence of all good men, and the just punishment\r\nof the laws they have dared to outrage.\r\n\r\nIt has commonly been supposed, that this institution will prove a source\r\nof weakness in relation to military defense against a foreign country. I\r\nwill venture to say that in a slaveholding community, a larger military\r\nforce may be maintained permanently in the field, than in any State\r\nwhere there are not slaves. It is plain that almost the whole of the\r\nable bodied free male population, making half of the entire able bodied\r\nmale population, may be maintained in the field, and this without taking\r\nin any material degree from the labor and resources of the country. In\r\ngeneral, the labor of our country is performed by slaves. In other\r\ncountries, it is their laborers that form the material of their armies.\r\nWhat proportion of these can be taken away without fatally crippling\r\ntheir industry and resources? In the war of the Revolution, though the\r\nstrength of our State was wasted and paralyzed by the unfortunate\r\ndivisions which existed among ourselves, yet it may be said with general\r\ntruth, that every citizen was in the field, and acquired much of the\r\nqualities of the soldier.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this advantage will be attended with its compensating\r\nevils and disadvantages; to which we must learn to submit, if we are\r\ndetermined on the maintenance of our institutions. We are, as yet,\r\nhardly at all aware how little the maxims and practices of modern\r\ncivilized governments will apply to us. Standing armies, as they are\r\nelsewhere constituted, we cannot have; for we have not, and for\r\ngenerations cannot have, the materials out of which they are to be\r\nformed. If we should be involved in serious wars, I have no doubt but\r\nthat some sort of conscription, requiring the service of all citizens\r\nfor a considerable term, will be necessary. Like the people of Athens,\r\nit will be necessary that every citizen should be a soldier, and\r\nqualified to discharge efficiently the duties of a soldier. It may seem\r\na melancholy consideration, that an army so made up should be opposed to\r\nthe disciplined mercenaries of foreign nations. But we must learn to\r\nknow our true situation. But may we not hope, that made up of superior\r\nmaterials, of men having home and country to defend; inspired by higher\r\npride of character, of greater intelligence, and trained by an\r\neffective, though honorable discipline, such an army will be more than a\r\nmatch for mercenaries. The efficiency of an army is determined by the\r\nqualities of its officers, and may we not expect to have a greater\r\nproportion of men better qualified for officers, and possessing the true\r\nspirit of military command. And let it be recollected that if there were\r\notherwise reason to apprehend danger from insurrection, there will be\r\nthe greatest security when there is the largest force on foot within the\r\ncountry. Then it is that any such attempt would be most instantly and\r\neffectually crushed.\r\n\r\nAnd, perhaps, a wise foresight should induce our State to provide, that\r\nit should have within itself such military knowledge and skill as may be\r\nsufficient to organize, discipline, and command armies, by establishing\r\na military academy or school of discipline. The school of the militia\r\nwill not do for this. From the general opinion of our weakness, if our\r\ncountry should at any time come into hostile collision, we shall be\r\nselected for the point of attack; making us, according to Mr. Adam's\r\nanticipation, the Flanders of the United States. Come from what quarter\r\nit may, the storm will fall upon us. It is known that lately, when there\r\nwas apprehension of hostility with France, the scheme was instantly\r\ndevised of invading the Southern States and organizing insurrection. In\r\na popular English periodical work, I have seen the plan suggested by an\r\nofficer of high rank and reputation in the British army, of invading the\r\nSouthern States at various points and operating by the same means. He is\r\nsaid to be a gallant officer, and certainly had no conception that he\r\nwas devising atrocious crime, as alien to the true spirit of civilized\r\nwarfare, as the poisoning of streams and fountains. But the folly of\r\nsuch schemes is no less evident than their wickedness. Apart from the\r\nconsideration of that which experience has most fully proved to be\r\ntrue--that in general their attachment and fidelity to their masters is\r\nnot to be shaken, and that from sympathy with the feelings of those by\r\nwhom they are surrounded, and from whom they derive their impressions,\r\nthey contract no less terror and aversion toward an invading enemy; it\r\nis manifest that this recourse would be an hundred fold more available\r\nto us than to such an enemy. They are already in our possession, and we\r\nmight at will arm and organize them in any number that we might think\r\nproper. The Helots were a regular constituent part of the Spartan\r\narmies. Thoroughly acquainted with their characters, and accustomed to\r\ncommand them, we might use any strictness of discipline which would be\r\nnecessary to render them effective, and from their habits of\r\nsubordination already formed, this would be a task of less difficulty.\r\nThough morally most timid, they are by no means wanting in physical\r\nstrength of nerve. They are excitable by praise; and directed by those\r\nin whom they have confidence, would rush fearlessly and unquestioning\r\nupon any sort of danger. With white officers and accompanied by a strong\r\nwhite cavalry, there are no troops in the world from whom there would be\r\nso little reason to apprehend insubordination or mutiny.\r\n\r\nThis, I admit, might be a dangerous resource, and one not to be resorted\r\nto but in great extremity. But I am supposing the case of our being\r\ndriven to extremity. It might be dangerous to disband such an army, and\r\nreduce them with the habits of soldiers, to their former condition of\r\nlaborers. It might be found necessary, when once embodied, to keep them\r\nso, and subject to military discipline--a permanent standing army. This\r\nin time of peace would be expensive, if not dangerous. Or if at any time\r\nwe should be engaged in hostilities with our neighbors, and it were\r\nthought advisable to send such an army abroad to conquer settlements for\r\nthemselves, the invaded regions might have occasion to think that the\r\nscourge of God was again let loose to afflict the earth.\r\n\r\nPresident Dew has very fully shown how utterly vain are the fears of\r\nthose, who, though there may be no danger for the present, yet apprehend\r\ngreat danger for the future, when the number of slaves shall be greatly\r\nincreased. He has shown that the larger and more condensed society\r\nbecomes, the easier it will be to maintain subordination, supposing the\r\nrelative number of the different classes to remain the same--or even if\r\nthere should be a very disproportionate increase of the enslaved class.\r\nOf all vain things, the vainest and that in which man most shows his\r\nimpotence and folly, is the taking upon himself to provide for a very\r\ndistant future--at all events by any material sacrifice of the present.\r\nThough experience has shown that revolutions and political\r\nmovements--unless when they have been conducted with the most guarded\r\ncaution and moderation--have generally terminated in results just the\r\nopposite of what was expected from them, the angry ape will still play\r\nhis fantastic tricks, and put in motion machinery, the action of which\r\nhe no more comprehends or foresees than he comprehends the mysteries of\r\ninfinity. The insect that is borne upon the current will fancy that he\r\ndirects its course. Besides the fear of insurrection and servile war,\r\nthere is also alarm lest, when their numbers shall be greatly increased,\r\ntheir labor will become utterly unprofitable, so that it will be equally\r\ndifficult for the master to retain and support them, or to get rid of\r\nthem. But at what age of the world is this likely to happen? At present,\r\nit may be said that almost the whole of the Southern portion of this\r\ncontinent is to be subdued to cultivation; and in the order of\r\nProvidence, this is the task allotted to them. For this purpose, more\r\nlabor will be required for generations to come than they will be able to\r\nsupply. When that task is accomplished, there will be many objects to\r\nwhich their labor may be directed.\r\n\r\nAt present they are employed in accumulating individual wealth, and this\r\nin one way, to wit, as agricultural laborers--and this is, perhaps, the\r\nmost useful purpose to which their labor can be applied. The effect of\r\nslavery has not been to counteract the tendency to dispersion, which\r\nseems epidemical among our countrymen, invited by the unbounded extent\r\nof fertile and unexhausted soil, though it counteracts many of the evils\r\nof dispersion. All the customary trades, professions and employments,\r\nexcept the agricultural, require a condensed population for their\r\nprofitable exercise. The agriculturist who can command no labor but that\r\nof his own hands, or that of his family, must remain comparatively poor\r\nand rude. He who acquires wealth by the labor of slaves, has the means\r\nof improvement for himself and his children. He may have a more extended\r\nintercourse, and consequently means of information and refinement, and\r\nmay seek education for his children where it may be found. I say, what\r\nis obviously true, that he has the _means_ of obtaining those\r\nadvantages; but I say nothing to palliate or excuse the conduct of him\r\nwho, having such means, neglects to avail himself of them.\r\n\r\nI believe it to be true, that in consequence of our dispersion, though\r\nindividual wealth is acquired, the face of the country is less adorned\r\nand improved by useful and ornamental public works, than in other\r\nsocieties of more condensed population, where there is less wealth. But\r\nthis is an effect of that which constitutes perhaps our most conspicuous\r\nadvantage. Where population is condensed, they must have the evils of\r\ncondensed population, and among these is the difficulty of finding\r\nprofitable employment for capital. He who has accumulated even an\r\ninconsiderable sum, is often puzzled to know what use to make of it.\r\nIngenuity is therefore tasked to cast about for every enterprise which\r\nmay afford a chance of profitable investment. Works useful and\r\nornamental to the country, are thus undertaken and accomplished, and\r\nthough the proprietors may fail of profit, the community no less\r\nreceives the benefit. Among us, there is no such difficulty. A safe and\r\nprofitable method of investment is offered to every one who has capital\r\nto dispose of, which is further recommended to his feelings by the sense\r\nof independence and the comparative leisure which the employment affords\r\nto the proprietor engaged in it. It is for this reason that few of our\r\ncitizens engage in the pursuits of commerce. Though these may be more\r\nprofitable, they are also more hazardous and more laborious.\r\n\r\nWhen the demand for agricultural labor shall be fully supplied, then of\r\ncourse the labor of slaves will be directed to other employment and\r\nenterprises. Already it begins to be found, that in some instances it\r\nmay be used as profitably in works of public improvement. As it becomes\r\ncheaper and cheaper, it will be applied to more various purposes and\r\ncombined in larger masses. It may be commanded and combined with more\r\nfacility than any other sort of labor; and the laborer, kept in stricter\r\nsubordination, will be less dangerous to the security of society than in\r\nany other country, which is crowded and overstocked with a class of what\r\nare called free laborers. Let it be remembered that all the great and\r\nenduring monuments of human art and industry--the wonders of Egypt--the\r\neverlasting works of Rome--were created by the labor of slaves. There\r\nwill come a stage in our progress when we shall have facilities for\r\nexecuting works as great as any of these--more useful than the\r\npyramids--not less magnificent than the sea of Moeris. What the end of\r\nall is to be; what mutations lie hid in the womb of the distant future;\r\nto what convulsions our societies may be exposed--whether the master,\r\nfinding it impossible to live with his slaves, may not be compelled to\r\nabandon the country to them--of all this it were presumptuous and vain\r\nto speculate.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto, as I proposed, considered it as a naked, abstract\r\nquestion of the comparative good and evil of the institution of slavery.\r\nVery far different indeed is the practical question presented to us,\r\nwhen it is proposed to get rid of an institution which has interwoven\r\nitself with every fibre of the body politic; which has formed the habits\r\nof our society, and is consecrated by the usage of generations. If this\r\nbe not a vicious prescription, which the laws of God forbid to ripen\r\ninto right, it has a just claim to be respected by all tribunals of man.\r\nIf the negroes were now free, and it were proposed to enslave them, then\r\nit would be incumbent on those who proposed the measure to show clearly\r\nthat their liberty was incompatible with the public security. When it is\r\nproposed to innovate on the established state of things, the burden is\r\non those who propose the innovation, to show that advantage will be\r\ngained from it. There is no reform, however necessary, wholesome or\r\nmoderate, which will not be accompanied with some degree of\r\ninconvenience, risk or suffering. Those who acquiesce in the state of\r\nthings which they found existing, can hardly be thought criminal. But\r\nmost deeply criminal are they who give rise to the enormous evil with\r\nwhich great revolutions in society are always attended, without the\r\nfullest assurance of the greater good to be ultimately obtained. But if\r\nit can be made to appear, even probably, that no good will be obtained,\r\nbut that the results will be evil and calamitous as the process, what\r\ncan justify such innovations? No human being can be so mischievous--if\r\nacting consciously, none can be so wicked as those who, finding evil in\r\nexisting institutions, run blindly upon change, unforeseeing and\r\nreckless of consequences, and leaving it to chance or fate to determine\r\nwhether the end shall be improvement, or greater and more intolerable\r\nevil. Certainly the instincts of nature prompt to resist intolerable\r\noppression. For this resistance no rule can be prescribed, but it must\r\nbe left to the instincts of nature. To justify it, however, the\r\ninsurrectionists should at least have a reasonable probability of\r\nsuccess, and be assured that their condition will be improved by\r\nsuccess. But most extraordinary is it, when those who complain and\r\nclamor are not those who are supposed to feel the oppression, but\r\npersons at a distance from them, and who can hardly at all appreciate\r\nthe good or the evil of their situation. It is the unalterable condition\r\nof humanity, that men must achieve civil liberty for themselves. The\r\nassistance of allies has sometimes enabled nations to repel the attacks\r\nof foreign power, never to conquer liberty against their own internal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn one thing I concur with the abolitionsts; that if emancipation is to\r\nbe brought about, it is better that it should be immediate and total.\r\nBut let us suppose it to be brought about in any manner, and then\r\ninquire what would be the effects.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious effect, would be to put an end to the\r\ncultivation of our great Southern staple. And this would be equally the\r\nresult, if we suppose the emancipated negroes to be in no way\r\ndistinguished from the free laborers of other countries, and that their\r\nlabor would be equally effective. In that case, they would soon cease to\r\nbe laborers for hire, but would scatter themselves over our unbounded\r\nterritory, to become independent land owners themselves. The cultivation\r\nof the soil on an extensive scale, can only be carried on where there\r\nare slaves, or in countries superabounding with free labor. No such\r\noperations are carried on in any portions of our own country where there\r\nare not slaves. Such are carried on in England, where there is an\r\noverflowing population and intense competition for employment. And our\r\ninstitutions seem suited to the exigencies of our respective situations.\r\nThere, a much greater number of laborers is required at one season of\r\nthe year than at another, and the farmer may enlarge or diminish the\r\nquantity of labor he employs, as circumstances may require. Here, about\r\nthe same quantity of labor is required at every season, and the planter\r\nsuffers no inconvenience from retaining his laborers throughout the\r\nyear. Imagine an extensive rice or cotton plantation cultivated by free\r\nlaborers, who might perhaps _strike_ for an increase of wages, at a\r\nseason when the neglect of a few days would insure the destruction of\r\nthe whole crop. Even if it were possible to procure laborers at all,\r\nwhat planter would venture to carry on his operations under such\r\ncircumstances? I need hardly say that these staples can not be produced\r\nto any extent where the proprietor of the soil cultivates it with his\r\nown hands. He can do little more than produce the necessary food for\r\nhimself and his family.\r\n\r\nAnd what would be the effect of putting an end to the cultivation of\r\nthese staples, and thus annihilating, at a blow, two-thirds or\r\nthree-fourths of our foreign commerce? Can any sane mind contemplate\r\nsuch a result without terror? I speak not of the utter poverty and\r\nmisery to which we ourselves would be reduced, and the desolation which\r\nwould overspread our own portion of the country. Our slavery has not\r\nonly given existence to millions of slaves within our own territories,\r\nit has given the means of subsistence, and therefore existence, to\r\nmillions of freemen in our confederate States; enabling them to send\r\nforth their swarms to overspread the plains and forests of the West, and\r\nappear as the harbingers of civilization. The products of the industry\r\nof those States are in general similar to those of the civilized world,\r\nand are little demanded in their markets. By exchanging them for ours,\r\nwhich are everywhere sought for, the people of these States are enabled\r\nto acquire all the products of art and industry, all that contributes to\r\nconvenience or luxury, or gratifies the taste or the intellect, which\r\nthe rest of the world can supply. Not only on our own continent, but on\r\nthe other, it has given existence to hundreds of thousands, and the\r\nmeans of comfortable subsistence to millions. A distinguished citizen of\r\nour own State, than whom none can be better qualified to form an\r\nopinion, has lately stated that our great staple, cotton, has\r\ncontributed more than any thing else of later times to the progress of\r\ncivilization. By enabling the poor to obtain cheap and becoming\r\nclothing, it has inspired a taste for comfort, the first stimulus to\r\ncivilization. Does not _self-defense_, then, demand of us steadily to\r\nresist the abrogation of that which is productive of so much good? It is\r\nmore than self-defense. It is to defend millions of human beings, who\r\nare far removed from us, from the intensest suffering, if not from being\r\nstruck out of existence. It is the defense of human civilization.\r\n\r\nBut this is but a small part of the evil which would be occasioned.\r\nAfter President Dew, it is unnecessary to say a single word on the\r\npracticability of colonizing our slaves. The two races, so widely\r\nseparated from each other by the impress of nature, must remain together\r\nin the same country. Whether it be accounted the result of prejudice or\r\nreason, it is certain that the two races will not be blended together so\r\nas to form a homogenous population. To one who knows any thing of the\r\nnature of man and human society, it would be unnecessary to argue that\r\nthis state of things can not continue; but that one race must be driven\r\nout by the other, or exterminated, or again enslaved. I have argued on\r\nthe supposition that the emancipated negroes would be as efficient as\r\nother free laborers. But whatever theorists, who know nothing of the\r\nmatter, may think proper to assume, we well know that this would not be\r\nso. We know that nothing but the coercion of slavery can overcome their\r\npropensity to indolence, and that not one in ten would be an efficient\r\nlaborer. Even if this disposition were not grounded in their nature, it\r\nwould be a result of their position. I have somewhere seen it observed,\r\nthat to be degraded by opinion, is a thousand fold worse, so far as the\r\nfeelings of the individuals are concerned, than to be degraded by the\r\nlaws. _They_ would be thus degraded, and this feeling is incompatible\r\nwith habits of order and industry. Half our population would at once be\r\npaupers. Let an inhabitant of New-York or Philadelphia conceive of the\r\nsituation of their respective States, if one-half of their population\r\nconsisted of free negroes. The tie which now connects them, being\r\nbroken, the different races would be estranged from each other, and\r\nhostility would grow up between them. Having the command of their own\r\ntime and actions, they could more effectually combine insurrection, and\r\nprovide the means of rendering it formidable. Released from the vigilant\r\nsuperintendence which now restrains them, they would infallibly be led\r\nfrom petty to greater crimes, until all life and property would be\r\nrendered insecure. Aggression would beget retaliation, until open\r\nwar--and that a war of extermination--were established. From the still\r\nremaining superiority of the white race, it is probable that they would\r\nbe the victors, and if they did not exterminate, they must again reduce\r\nthe others to slavery--when they could be no longer fit to be either\r\nslaves or freemen. It is not only in self-defense, in defense of our\r\ncountry and of all that is dear to us, but in defense of the slaves\r\nthemselves, that we refuse to emancipate them.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose them to have political privileges, and to be admitted to\r\nthe elective franchise, still worse results may be expected.[251] It is\r\nhardly necessary to add any thing to what has been said by Mr. Paulding\r\non this subject who has treated it fully. It is already known, that if\r\nthere be a class unfavorably distinguished by any peculiarity from the\r\nrest of society, this distinction forms a tie which binds them to act\r\nin concert, and they exercise more than their due share of political\r\npower and influence--and still more, as they are of inferior character\r\nand looser moral principle. Such a class form the very material for\r\ndemogogues to work with. Other parties court them, and concede to them.\r\nSo it would be with the free blacks in the case supposed. They would be\r\nused by unprincipled politicians, of irregular ambition, for the\r\nadvancement of their schemes, until they should give them political\r\npower and importance beyond even their own intentions. They would be\r\ncourted by excited parties in their contests with each other. At some\r\ntime, they may perhaps attain political ascendancy, and this is more\r\nprobable, as we may suppose that there will have been a great emigration\r\nof whites from the country. Imagine the government of such legislators.\r\nImagine then the sort of laws that will be passed, to confound the\r\ninvidious distinction which has been so long assumed over them, and, if\r\npossible, to obliterate the very memory of it. These will be resisted.\r\nThe blacks will be tempted to avenge themselves by oppression and\r\nproscription of the white race, for their long superiority. Thus matters\r\nwill go on, until universal anarchy, or kakistocracy, the government of\r\nthe worst, is fully established. I am persuaded that if the spirit of\r\nevil should devise to send abroad upon the earth all possible misery,\r\ndiscord, horror, and atrocity, he could contrive no scheme so effectual\r\nas the emancipation of negro slaves within our country.\r\n\r\nThe most feasible scheme of emancipation, and that which I verily\r\nbelieve would involve the least danger and sacrifice, would be that the\r\n_entire_ white population should emigrate, and abandon the country to\r\ntheir slaves. Here would be triumph to philanthropy. This wide and\r\nfertile region would be again restored to ancient barbarism--to the\r\nworst of all barbarism--barbarism corrupted and depraved by intercourse\r\nwith civilization. And this is the consummation to be wished, upon a\r\n_speculation_, that in some distant future age, they may become so\r\nenlightened and improved, as to be capable of sustaining a position\r\namong the civilized races of the earth. But I believe moralists allow\r\nmen to defend their homes and their country, even at the expense of the\r\nlives and liberties of others.\r\n\r\nWill any philanthropist say that the evils, of which I have spoken,\r\nwould be brought about only by the obduracy, prejudices, and overweening\r\nself-estimation of the whites in refusing to blend the races by\r\nmarriage, and so create a homogenous population?[252] But what, if it be\r\nnot prejudice, but truth, and nature, and right reason, and just moral\r\nfeeling? As I have before said, throughout the whole of nature, like\r\nattracts like, and that which is unlike repels. What is it that makes so\r\nunspeakably loathsome, crimes not to be named, and hardly alluded to?\r\nEven among the nations of Europe, so nearly homogenous, there are some\r\npeculiarities of form and feature, mind and character, which may be\r\ngenerally distinguished by those accustomed to observe them. Though the\r\nexceptions are numerous, I will venture to say that not in one instance\r\nin a hundred, is the man of sound and unsophisticated tastes and\r\npropensities so likely to be attracted by the female of a foreign stock,\r\nas by one of his own, who is more nearly conformed to himself.\r\nShakspeare spoke the language of nature, when he made the senate and\r\npeople of Venice attribute to the effect of witchcraft, Desdemona's\r\npassion for Othello--though, as Coleridge has said, we are to conceive\r\nof him not as a negro, but as a high bred Moorish chief.\r\n\r\nIf the negro race, as I have contended, be inferior to our own in mind\r\nand character, marked by inferiority of form and features, then ours\r\nwould suffer deterioration from such intermixture. What would be thought\r\nof the moral conduct of the parent who should voluntarily transmit\r\ndisease, or fatuity, or deformity to his offspring? If man be the most\r\nperfect work of the Creator, and the civilized European man the most\r\nperfect variety of the human race, is he not criminal who would\r\ndesecrate and deface God's fairest work; estranging it further from the\r\nimage of himself, and conforming it more nearly to that of the brute? I\r\nhave heard it said, as if it afforded an argument, that the African is\r\nas well satisfied of the superiority of his own complexion, form, and\r\nfeatures, as we can be of ours. If this were true, as it is not, would\r\nany one be so recreant to his own civilization, as to say that his\r\nopinion ought to weigh against ours--that there is no universal standard\r\nof truth, and grace, and beauty--that the Hottentot Venus may perchance\r\npossess as great perfection of form as the Medicean? It is true, the\r\nlicentious passions of men overcome the natural repugnance, and find\r\ntransient gratification in intercourse with females of the other race.\r\nBut this is a very different thing from making her the associate of\r\nlife, the companion of the bosom and the hearth. Him who would\r\ncontemplate such an alliance for himself, or regard it with patience,\r\nwhen proposed for a son, or daughter, or sister, we should esteem a\r\ndegraded wretch--with justice, certainly, if he were found among\r\nourselves--and the estimate would not be very different if he were found\r\nin Europe. It is not only in defense of ourselves, of our country, and\r\nof our own generation, that we refuse to emancipate our slaves, but to\r\ndefend our posterity and race from degeneracy and degradation.\r\n\r\nAre we not justified then in regarding as criminals, the fanatical\r\nagitators whose efforts are intended to bring about the evils I have\r\ndescribed? It is sometimes said that their zeal is generous and\r\ndisinterested, and that their motives may be praised, though their\r\nconduct be condemned. But I have little faith in the good motives of\r\nthose who pursue bad ends. It is not for us to scrutinize the hearts of\r\nmen, and we can only judge of them by the tendency of their actions.\r\nThere is much truth in what was said by Coleridge. \"I have never known a\r\ntrader in philanthropy who was not wrong in heart somehow or other.\r\nIndividuals so distinguished, are usually unhappy in their family\r\nrelations--men not benevolent or beneficent to individuals, but almost\r\nhostile to them, yet lavishing money and labor and time on the race--the\r\nabstract notion.\" The prurient love of notoriety actuates some. There is\r\nmuch luxury in sentiment, especially if it can be indulged at the\r\nexpense of others, and if there be added some share of envy or\r\nmalignity, the temptation to indulgence is almost irresistible. But\r\ncertainly they may be justly regarded as criminal, who obstinately shut\r\ntheir eyes and close their ears to all instruction with respect to the\r\ntrue nature of their actions.\r\n\r\nIt must be manifest to every man of sane mind that it is impossible for\r\nthem to achieve ultimate success; even if every individual in our\r\ncountry, out of the limits of the slaveholding States, were united in\r\ntheir purposes. They can not have even the miserable triumph of St.\r\nDomingo--of advancing through scenes of atrocity, blood and massacre, to\r\nthe restoration of barbarism. They may agitate and perplex the world for\r\na time. They may excite to desperate attempts and particular acts of\r\ncruelty and horror, but these will always be suppressed or avenged at\r\nthe expense of the objects of their truculent philanthropy. But short of\r\nthis, they can hardly be aware of the extent of the mischief they\r\nperpetrate. As I have said, their opinions, by means to us inscrutable,\r\ndo very generally reach our slave population. What human being, if\r\nunfavorably distinguished by outward circumstances, is not ready to\r\nbelieve when he is told that he is the victim of injustice? Is it not\r\ncruelty to make men restless and dissatisfied in their condition, when\r\nno effort of theirs can alter it? The greatest injury is done to their\r\ncharacters, as well as to their happiness. Even if no such feelings or\r\ndesigns should be entertained or conceived by the slave, they will be\r\nattributed to him by the master, and all his conduct scanned with a\r\nsevere and jealous scrutiny. Thus distrust and aversion are established,\r\nwhere, but for mischievous interference, there would be confidence and\r\ngood-will, and a sterner control is exercised over the slave who thus\r\nbecomes the victim of his cruel advocates.[253]\r\n\r\nAn effect is sometimes produced on the minds of slaveholders, by the\r\npublications of the self-styled philanthropists, and their judgments\r\nstaggered and consciences alarmed. It is natural that the oppressed\r\nshould hate the oppressor. It is still more natural that the oppressor\r\nshould hate his victim. Convince the master that he is doing injustice\r\nto his slave, and he at once begins to regard him with distrust and\r\nmalignity. It is a part of the constitution of the human mind, that when\r\ncircumstances of necessity or temptation induce men to continue in the\r\npractice of what they believe to be wrong, they become desperate and\r\nreckless of the degree of wrong. I have formerly heard of a master who\r\naccounted for his practicing much severity upon his slaves, and exacting\r\nfrom them an unusual degree of labor, by saying that the thing (slavery)\r\nwas altogether wrong, and therefore it was well to make the greatest\r\npossible advantage out of it. This agitation occasions some slaveholders\r\nto hang more loosely on their country. Regarding the institution as of\r\nquestionable character, condemned by the general opinion of the world,\r\nand one which must shortly come to an end, they hold themselves in\r\nreadiness to make their escape from the evil which they anticipate. Some\r\nsell their slaves to new masters (always a misfortune to the slave) and\r\nremove themselves to other societies, of manners and habits uncongenial\r\nto their own. And though we may suppose that it is only the weak and the\r\ntimid who are liable to be thus affected, still it is no less an injury\r\nand public misfortune. Society is kept in an unquiet and restless state,\r\nand every sort of improvement is retarded.\r\n\r\nSome projectors suggest the education of slaves, with a view to prepare\r\nthem for freedom--as if there were any method of a man's being educated\r\nto freedom, but by himself. The truth is, however, that supposing that\r\nthey are shortly to be emancipated, and that they have the capacities of\r\nany other race, they are undergoing the very best education which it is\r\npossible to give. They are in the course of being taught habits of\r\nregular and patient industry, and this is the first lesson which is\r\nrequired. I suppose that their most zealous advocates would not desire\r\nthat they should be placed in the high places of society immediately\r\nupon their emancipation, but that they should begin their course of\r\nfreedom as laborers, and raise themselves afterward as their capacities\r\nand characters might enable them. But how little would what are commonly\r\ncalled the rudiments of education, add to their qualifications as\r\nlaborers? But for the agitation which exists, however, their education\r\nwould be carried further than this. There is a constant tendency in our\r\nsociety to extend the sphere of their employments, and consequently to\r\ngive them the information which is necessary to the discharge of those\r\nemployments. And this, for the most obvious reason, it promotes the\r\nmaster's interest. How much would it add to the value of a slave, that\r\nhe should be capable of being employed as a clerk, or be able to make\r\ncalculations as a mechanic? In consequence, however, of the fanatical\r\nspirit which has been excited, it has been thought necessary to repress\r\nthis tendency by legislation, and to prevent their acquiring the\r\nknowledge of which they might make a dangerous use. If this spirit were\r\nput down, and we restored to the consciousness of security, this would\r\nbe no longer necessary, and the process of which I have spoken would be\r\naccelerated. Whenever indications of superior capacity appeared in a\r\nslave, it would be cultivated; gradual improvement would take place,\r\nuntil they might be engaged in as various employments as they were among\r\nthe ancients--perhaps even liberal ones. Thus, if in the adorable\r\nprovidence of God, at a time and in a manner which we can neither\r\nforesee nor conjecture, they are to be rendered capable of freedom and\r\nto enjoy it, they would be prepared for it in the best and most\r\neffectual, because in the most natural and gradual manner. But\r\nfanaticism hurries to its effect at once. I have heard it said, God does\r\ngood, but it is by imperceptible degrees; the devil is permitted to do\r\nevil, and he does it in a hurry. The beneficent processes of nature are\r\nnot apparent to the senses. You cannot see the plant grow, or the flower\r\nexpand. The volcano, the earthquake, and the hurricane, do their work of\r\ndesolation in a moment. Such would be the desolation, if the schemes of\r\nfanatics were permitted to have effect. They do all that in them lies to\r\nthwart the beneficent purposes of providence. The whole tendency of\r\ntheir efforts is to aggravate present suffering, and to cut off the\r\nchance of future improvement, and in all their bearings and results,\r\nhave produced, and are likely to produce, nothing but \"pure, unmixed,\r\ndephlegmated, defecated evil.\"\r\n\r\nIf Wilberforce or Clarkson were living, and it were inquired of them\r\n\"can you be sure that you have promoted the happiness of a single human\r\nbeing?\" I imagine that, if they considered conscientiously, they would\r\nfind it difficult to answer in the affirmative. If it were asked \"can\r\nyou be sure that you have not been the cause of suffering, misery and\r\ndeath to thousands,\"--when we recollect that they probably stimulated\r\nthe exertions of the _amis des noirs_ in France, and that through the\r\nefforts of these the horrors of St. Domingo were perpetrated--I think\r\nthey must hesitate long to return a decided negative. It might seem\r\ncruel, if we could, to convince a man who has devoted his life to what\r\nhe esteemed a good and generous purpose, that he has been doing only\r\nevil--that he has been worshiping a horrid fiend, in the place of the\r\ntrue God. But fanaticism is in no danger of being convinced.[254] It is\r\none of the mysteries of our nature, and of the divine government, how\r\nutterly disproportioned to each other are the powers of doing evil and\r\nof doing good. The poorest and most abject instrument, that is utterly\r\nimbecile for any purpose of good, seems sometimes endowed with almost\r\nthe powers of omnipotence for mischief. A mole may inundate a\r\nprovince--a spark from a forge may conflagrate a city--a whisper may\r\nseparate friends--a rumor may convulse an empire--but when we would do\r\nbenefit to our race or country, the purest and most chastened motives,\r\nthe most patient thought and labor, with the humblest self-distrust, are\r\nhardly sufficient to assure us that the results may not disappoint our\r\nexpectations, and that we may not do evil instead of good. But are we\r\ntherefore to refrain from efforts to benefit our race and country? By no\r\nmeans: but these motives, this labor and self-distrust are the only\r\nconditions upon which we are permitted to hope for success. Very\r\ndifferent indeed is the course of those whose precipitate and ignorant\r\nzeal would overturn the fundamental institutions of society, uproar its\r\npeace and endanger its security, in pursuit of a distant and shadowy\r\ngood, of which they themselves have formed no definite conception--whose\r\natrocious philosophy would sacrifice a generation--and more than one\r\ngeneration--for any hypothesis.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[233] President Dew's Review of the Virginia Debates on the subject of\r\nSlavery.\r\n\r\n[234] Paulding on Slavery.\r\n\r\n[235] I refer to President Dew on this subject.\r\n\r\n[236] It is not uncommon, especially in Charleston, to see slaves, after\r\nmany descents and having mingled their blood with the Africans,\r\npossessing Indian hair and features.\r\n\r\n[237] The author of \"England and America.\" We do, however, most\r\nindignantly repudiate his conclusion, that we are bound to submit to a\r\ntariff of protection, as an expedient for retaining our slaves, \"the\r\nforce of the whole Union being required to preserve slavery, to keep\r\ndown the slaves.\"\r\n\r\n[238] Fourierites, Socialists.\r\n\r\n[239] The Irish levee and rail-road laborers are driven by blows.\r\n\r\n[240] English papers propose _this_ for the West India negroes.\r\n\r\n[241] Essays of Elia.\r\n\r\n[242] _Southern Literary Messenger_, for January, 1835. _Note to\r\nBlackstone's Commentaries._.\r\n\r\n[243] See Missionary reports, statistics; also, Prof. Christy's\r\nEthiopia.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n[244] Journal of an officer employed in the expedition, under the\r\ncommand of Captain Owen, on the Western coast of Africa, 1822.\r\n\r\n[245] The slaves of the \"Wanderer\" were returned to Africa against their\r\nwills.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n[246] In relation to the Missouri Controversy, J.

Slaves,\r\nblack or yellow, would have cultivated those plains, would have kept\r\ntogether, would have been made to assist each other; would, by keeping\r\ntogether and assisting each other, have raised a surplus produce\r\nexchangeable in distant markets; would have kept their masters together\r\nfor the sake of markets; would, by combination of labor, have preserved\r\namong their masters the arts and habits of civilized life.\" Yet this\r\nwriter, the whole practical effect of whose work, whatever he may have\r\nthought or intended, is to show the absolute necessity, and immense\r\nbenefits of slavery, finds it necessary to add, I suppose in deference\r\nto the general sentiment of his countrymen, \"that slavery might have\r\ndone all this, seems not more plain, than that so much good would have\r\nbeen bought too dear, if its price had been slavery.\" Well may we say\r\nthat the word makes men mad.\r\n\r\n[248] Johnson on Change of Air.\r\n\r\n[249] Eight days in the Abruzzi.--_Blackwood's Magazine_, November,\r\n1835.\r\n\r\n[250] I do not use the word democracy in the Athenian sense, but to\r\ndescribe the government in which the slave and his master have an equal\r\nvoice in public affairs.\r\n\r\n[251] Example of St. Domingo.\r\n\r\n[252] Effects in Mexico and South American republics among the mongrel\r\nraces.

CA.,) JANUARY 28, 1845.\r\n\r\nSIR: I received, a short time ago, a letter from the Rev. Willoughby M.\r\nDickinson, dated at your residence, \"Playford Hall, near Ipswich, 26th\r\nNovember, 1844,\" in which was inclosed a copy of your Circular Letter,\r\naddressed to professing Christians in our Northern States, having no\r\nconcern with slavery, and to others there. I presume that Mr.\r\nDickinson's letter was written with your knowledge, and the document\r\ninclosed with your consent and approbation. I therefore feel that there\r\nis no impropriety in my addressing my reply directly to yourself,\r\nespecially as there is nothing in Mr. Dickinson's communication\r\nrequiring serious notice. Having abundant leisure, it will be a\r\nrecreation to devote a portion of it to an examination and free\r\ndiscussion of the question of slavery as it exists in our Southern\r\nStates: and since you have thrown down the gauntlet to me, I do not\r\nhesitate to take it up.\r\n\r\nFamiliar as you have been with the discussions of this subject in all\r\nits aspects, and under all the excitements it has occasioned for sixty\r\nyears past, I may not be able to present much that will be new to you.\r\nNor ought I to indulge the hope of materially affecting the opinions you\r\nhave so long cherished, and so zealously promulgated. Still, time and\r\nexperience have developed facts, constantly furnishing fresh tests to\r\nopinions formed sixty years since, and continually placing this great\r\nquestion in points of view, which could scarcely occur to the most\r\nconsummate intellect even a quarter of a century ago: and which may not\r\nhave occurred yet to those whose previous convictions, prejudices, and\r\nhabits of thought, have thoroughly and permanently biased them to one\r\nfixed way of looking at the matter: while there are peculiarities in the\r\noperation of every social system, and special local as well as moral\r\ncauses materially affecting it, which no one, placed at the distance you\r\nare from us, can fully comprehend or properly appreciate. Besides, it\r\nmay be possibly, a novelty to you to encounter one who conscientiously\r\nbelieves the domestic slavery of these States to be not only an\r\ninexorable necessity for the present, but a moral and humane\r\ninstitution, productive of the greatest political and social advantages,\r\nand who is disposed, as I am, to defend it on these grounds.\r\n\r\nI do not propose, however, to defend the African slave trade. That is no\r\nlonger a question. Doubtless great evils arise from it as it has been,\r\nand is now conducted: unnecessary wars and cruel kidnapping in Africa:\r\nthe most shocking barbarities in the middle passage: and perhaps a less\r\nhumane system of slavery in countries continually supplied with fresh\r\nlaborers at a cheap rate. The evils of it, however, it may be fairly\r\npresumed, are greatly exaggerated. And if I might judge of the truth of\r\ntransactions stated as occurring in this trade, by that of those\r\nreported as transpiring among us, I should not hesitate to say, that a\r\nlarge proportion of the stories in circulation are unfounded, and most\r\nof the remainder highly colored.\r\n\r\nOn the passage of the Act of Parliament prohibiting this trade to\r\nBritish subjects rests, what you esteem, the glory of your life. It\r\nrequired twenty years of arduous agitation, and the intervening\r\nextraordinary political events, to convince your countrymen, and among\r\nthe rest your pious king, of the expediency of the measure: and it is\r\nbut just to say, that no one individual rendered more esessential\r\nservice to the cause than you did. In reflecting on the subject, you can\r\nnot but often ask yourself: What, after all, has been accomplished; how\r\nmuch human suffering has been averted; how many human beings have been\r\nrescued from transatlantic slavery? And on the answers you can give\r\nthese questions, must in a great measure, I presume, depend the\r\nhappiness of your life. In framing them, how frequently must you be\r\nreminded of the remark of Mr. Grosvenor, in one of the early debates\r\nupon the subject, which I believe you have yourself recorded, \"that he\r\nhad twenty objections to the abolition of the slave trade: the first\r\nwas, _that it was impossible_--the rest he need not give.\" Can you say\r\nto yourself, or to the world, that this _first_ objection of Mr.\r\nGrosvenor has been yet confuted? It was estimated at the commencement of\r\nyour agitation in 1787, that forty-five thousand Africans were annually\r\ntransported to America and the West Indies. And the mortality of the\r\nmiddle passage, computed by some at five, is now admitted not to have\r\nexceeded nine per cent. Notwithstanding your Act of Parliament, the\r\nprevious abolition by the United States, and that all the powers in the\r\nworld have subsequently prohibited this trade--some of the greatest of\r\nthem declaring it piracy, and covering the African seas with armed\r\nvessels to prevent it--Sir Thomas Fowel Buxton, a coadjutor of yours,\r\ndeclared in 1840, that the number of Africans now annually sold into\r\nslavery beyond the sea, amounts, at the very least, to one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand souls; while the mortality of the middle passage has\r\nincreased, in consequence of the measures taken to suppress the trade,\r\nto twenty-five or thirty per cent. And of the one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand slaves who have been captured and liberated by British\r\nmen-of-war, since the passage of your Act, Judge Jay, an American\r\nabolitionist, asserts that one hundred thousand, or two-thirds, have\r\nperished between their capture and liberation. Does it not really seem\r\nthat Mr. Grosvenor was a prophet? That though nearly all the\r\n\"impossibilities\" of 1787 have vanished, and become as familiar _facts_\r\nas our household customs, under the magic influence of steam, cotton,\r\nand universal peace, yet this wonderful prophecy still stands, defying\r\ntime and the energy and genius of mankind. Thousands of valuable lives,\r\nand fifty millions of pounds sterling, have been thrown away by your\r\ngovernment in fruitless attempts to overturn it. I hope you have not\r\nlived too long for your own happiness, though you have been spared to\r\nsee that in spite of all your toils and those of your fellow laborers,\r\nand the accomplishment of all that human agency could do, the African\r\nslave trade has increased three-fold under your own eyes--more rapidly,\r\nperhaps, than any other ancient branch of commerce--and that your\r\nefforts to suppress it, have affected _nothing more_ than a\r\nthree-fold increase of its horrors. There is a God who rules this\r\nworld--all-powerful--far-seeing: He does not permit his creatures to\r\nfoil his designs. It is he who, for his all-wise, though to us often\r\ninscrutable purposes, throws \"impossibilities\" in the way of our fondest\r\nhopes and most strenuous exertions. Can you doubt this?\r\n\r\nExperience having settled the point, that this trade _can not be\r\nabolished by the use of force_, and that blockading squadrons serve only\r\nto make it more profitable and more cruel, I am surprised that the\r\nattempt is persisted in, unless it serves as a cloak to other purposes.\r\nIt would be far better than it now is, for the African, if the trade was\r\nfree from all restrictions, and left to the mitigation and decay which\r\ntime and competition would surely bring about. If kidnapping, both\r\nsecretly, and by war made for the purpose, could be by any means\r\nprevented in Africa, the next greatest blessing you could bestow upon\r\nthat country would be to transport its actual slaves in comfortable\r\nvessels across the Atlantic. Though they might be perpetual bondsmen,\r\nstill they would emerge from darkness into light--from barbarism into\r\ncivilization--from idolatry to Christianity--in short from death to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the African slave trade, which has so signally defeated\r\nthe _philanthropy_ of the world, and turn to American slavery, to which\r\nyou have now directed your attention, and against which a crusade has\r\nbeen preached as enthusiastic and ferocious as that of Peter the\r\nHermit--destined, I believe, to be about as successful. And here let me\r\nsay, there is a vast difference between the two, though you may not\r\nacknowledge it. The wisdom of ages has concurred in the justice and\r\nexpediency of establishing rights by prescriptive use, however tortuous\r\nin their origin they may have been. You would deem a man insane, whose\r\nkeen sense of equity would lead him to denounce your right to the lands\r\nyou hold, and which perhaps you inherited from a long line of ancestry,\r\nbecause your title was derived from a Saxon or Norman conqueror, and\r\nyour lands were originally wrested by violence from the vanquished\r\nBritons. And so would the New England abolitionists regard any one who\r\nwould insist that he should restore his farm to the descendants of the\r\nslaughtered red men, to whom God had as clearly given it as he gave life\r\nand freedom to the kidnapped African. That time does not consecrate\r\nwrong, is a fallacy which all history exposes; and which the best and\r\nwisest men of all ages and professions of religious faith have\r\npractically denied. The means, therefore, whatever they may have been,\r\nby which the African race now in this country have been reduced to\r\nslavery, cannot affect us, since they are our property, as your land is\r\nyours, by inheritance or purchase and prescriptive right. You will say\r\nthat man cannot hold _property in man_. The answer is, that he can and\r\n_actually does_ hold property in his fellow all the world over, in a\r\nvariety of forms, and _has always done so_. I will show presently his\r\nauthority for doing it.\r\n\r\nIf you were to ask me whether I am an advocate of slavery in the\r\nabstract, I should probably answer, that I am not, according to my\r\nunderstanding of the question. I do not like to deal in abstractions. It\r\nseldom leads to any useful ends. There are few universal truths. I do\r\nnot now remember any single moral truth universally acknowledged. We\r\nhave no assurance that it is given to our finite understanding to\r\ncomprehend abstract moral truth. Apart from revelation and the inspired\r\nwritings, what ideas should we have even of God, salvation, and\r\nimmortality? Let the heathen answer. Justice itself is impalpable as an\r\nabstraction, and abstract liberty the merest phantasy that ever amused\r\nthe imagination. This world was made for man, and man for the world as\r\nit is. We ourselves, our relations with one another and with all matter,\r\nare real, not ideal. I might say that I am no more in favor of slavery\r\nin the abstract, than I am of poverty, disease, deformity, idiocy, or\r\nany other inequality in the condition of the human family; that I love\r\nperfection, and think I should enjoy a millennium such as God has\r\npromised. But what would it amount to? A pledge that I would join you to\r\nset about eradicating those apparently inevitable evils of our nature,\r\nin equalizing the condition of all mankind, consummating the perfection\r\nof our race, and introducing the millennium? By no means. To effect\r\nthese things, belongs exclusively to a higher power. And it would be\r\nwell for us to leave the Almighty to perfect his own works and fulfill\r\nhis own covenants. Especially, as the history of the past shows how\r\nentirely futile all human efforts have proved, when made for the purpose\r\nof aiding him in carrying out even his revealed designs, and how\r\ninvariably he has accomplished them by unconscious instruments, and in\r\nthe face of human expectation. Nay more, that every attempt which has\r\nbeen made by fallible man to extort from the world obedience to his\r\n\"abstract\" notions of right and wrong, has been invariably attended with\r\ncalamities dire, and extended just in proportion to the breadth and\r\nvigor of the movement. On slavery in the abstract, then, it would not be\r\namiss to have as little as possible to say. Let us contemplate it as it\r\nis. And thus contemplating it, the first question we have to ask\r\nourselves is, whether it is contrary to the will of God, as revealed to\r\nus in his Holy Scriptures--the only certain means given us to ascertain\r\nhis will. If it is, then slavery is a sin. And I admit at once that\r\nevery man is bound to set his face against it, and to emancipate his\r\nslaves, should he hold any.\r\n\r\nLet us open these Holy Scriptures. In the twentieth chapter of Exodus,\r\nseventeenth verse, I find the following words: \"Thou shalt not covet thy\r\nneighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his\r\nman-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any\r\nthing that is thy neighbor's\"--which is the tenth of those commandments\r\nthat declare the essential principles of the great moral law delivered\r\nto Moses by God himself. Now, discarding all technical and verbal\r\nquibbling as wholly unworthy to be used in interpreting the word of God,\r\nwhat is the plain meaning, undoubted intent, and true spirit of this\r\ncommandment? Does it not emphatically and explicitly forbid you to\r\ndisturb your neighbor in the enjoyment of his property; and more\r\nespecially of that which is here specifically mentioned as being\r\nlawfully, and by this commandment made sacredly his? Prominent in the\r\ncatalogue stands his \"man-servant and his maid-servant,\" who are thus\r\ndistinctly _consecrated as his property_, and guaranteed to him for his\r\nexclusive benefit, in the most solemn manner. You attempt to avert the\r\notherwise irresistible conclusion, that slavery was thus ordained by\r\nGod, by declaring that the word \"slave\" is not used here, and is not to\r\nbe found in the Bible, And I have seen many learned dissertations on\r\nthis point from abolition pens. It is well known that both the Hebrew\r\nand Greek words translated \"servant\" in the Scriptures, means also, and\r\nmost usually, \"slave.\" The use of the one word, instead of the other,\r\nwas a mere matter of taste with the translators of the Bible, as it has\r\nbeen with all the commentators and religions writers, the latter of whom\r\nhave, I believe, for the most part, adopted the term \"slave,\" or used\r\nboth terms indiscriminately. If, then, these Hebrew and Greek words\r\ninclude the idea of both systems of servitude, the conditional and\r\nunconditional, they should, as the major includes the minor proposition,\r\nbe always translated \"slaves,\" unless the sense of the whole text\r\nforbids it. The real question, then is, what idea is intended to be\r\nconveyed by the words used in the commandment quoted? And it is clear to\r\nmy mind, that as no limitation is affixed to them, and the express\r\nintention was to secure to mankind the peaceful enjoyment of every\r\nspecies of property, that the terms \"men-servants and maid-servants\"\r\ninclude all classes of servants, and establish a lawful, exclusive, and\r\nindefeasible interest equally in the \"Hebrew brother who shall go out in\r\nthe seventh year,\" and \"the yearly hired servant,\" and \"those purchased\r\nfrom the heathen round about,\" who were to be \"bond-men forever,\" _as\r\nthe property of their fellow-man_.\r\n\r\nYou cannot deny that there were among the Hebrews \"bond-men forever.\"\r\nYou cannot deny that God especially authorized his chosen people to\r\npurchase \"bond-men forever\" from the heathen, as recorded in the\r\ntwenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus, and that they are there designated by\r\nthe very Hebrew word used in the tenth commandment. Nor can you deny\r\nthat a \"BOND-MAN FOREVER\" is a \"SLAVE;\" yet you endeavor to hang an\r\nargument of immortal consequence upon the wretched subterfuge, that the\r\nprecise word \"slave\" is not to be found in the _translation_ of the\r\nBible. As if the translators were canonical expounders of the Holy\r\nScriptures, and _their words_, not _God's meaning_, must be regarded as\r\nhis revelation.\r\n\r\nIt is vain to look to Christ or any of his apostles to justify such\r\nblasphemous perversions of the word of God. Although slavery in its most\r\nrevolting form was everywhere visible around them, no visionary notions\r\nof piety or philanthropy ever tempted them to gainsay the LAW, even to\r\nmitigate the cruel severity of the existing system. On the contrary,\r\nregarding slavery as an _established_, as well as _inevitable condition\r\nof human society_, they never hinted at such a thing as its termination\r\non earth, any more than that \"the poor may cease out of the land,\"\r\nwhich God affirms to Moses shall never be: and they exhort \"all servants\r\nunder the yoke\" to \"count their masters as worthy of all honor:\" \"to\r\nobey them in all things according to the flesh; not with eye-service as\r\nmen-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God;\" \"not only the\r\ngood and gentle, but also the froward:\" \"for what glory is it if when ye\r\nare buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently? but if when ye\r\ndo well and suffer for it ye take it patiently, this is acceptable to\r\nGod.\" St. Paul actually apprehended a run-away slave, and sent him to\r\nhis master! Instead of deriving from the gospel any sanction for the\r\nwork you have undertaken, it would be difficult to imagine sentiments\r\nand conduct more strikingly in contrast, than those of the apostles and\r\nthe abolitionists.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, therefore, to suppose that slavery is contrary to the\r\nwill of God. It is equally absurd to say that American slavery differs\r\nin form or principle from that of the chosen people. _We accept the\r\nBible terms as the definition of our slavery, and its precepts as the\r\nguide of our conduct._ We desire nothing more. Even the right to\r\n\"buffet,\" which is esteemed so shocking, finds its express license in\r\nthe gospel. 1 Peter ii. 20. Nay, what is more, God directs the Hebrews\r\nto \"bore holes in the ears of their brothers\" to _mark_ them, when under\r\ncertain circumstances they become _perpetual slaves_. Exodus xxi. 6.\r\n\r\nI think, then, I may safely conclude, and I firmly believe, that\r\nAmerican slavery is not only not a sin, but especially commanded by God\r\nthrough Moses, and approved by Christ through his apostles. And here I\r\nmight close its defense; for what God ordains, and Christ sanctifies,\r\nshould surely command the respect and toleration of man. But I fear\r\nthere has grown up in our time a transcendental religion, which is\r\nthrowing even transcendental philosophy into the shade--a religion too\r\npure and elevated for the Bible; which seeks to erect among men a higher\r\nstandard of morals than the Almighty has revealed, or our Saviour\r\npreached; and which is probably destined to do more to impede the\r\nextension of God's kingdom on earth than all the infidels who have ever\r\nlived. Error is error. It is as dangerous to deviate to the right hand\r\nas to the left. And when men, professing to be holy men, and who are by\r\nnumbers so regarded, declare those things to be sinful which our Creator\r\nhas expressly authorized and instituted, they do more to destroy his\r\nauthority among mankind than the most wicked can effect, by proclaiming\r\nthat to be innocent which he has forbidden. To this self-righteous and\r\nself-exalted class belong all the abolitionists whose writings I have\r\nread. With them it is no end of the argument to prove your propositions\r\nby the text of the Bible, interpreted according to its plain and\r\npalpable meaning, and as understood by all mankind for three thousand\r\nyears before their time. They are more ingenious at construing and\r\ninterpolating to accommodate it to their new-fangled and ethereal code\r\nof morals, than ever were Voltaire and Hume in picking it to pieces, to\r\nfree the world from what they considered a delusion. When the\r\nabolitionists proclaim \"man-stealing\" to be a sin, and show me that it\r\nis so written down by God, I admit them to be right, and shudder at the\r\nidea of such a crime. But when I show them that to hold \"bond-men\r\nforever\" is ordained by God, _they deny the Bible, and set up in its\r\nplace a law of their own making_. I must then cease to reason with them\r\non this branch of the question. Our religion differs as widely as our\r\nmanners. The great Judge in our day of final account must decide between\r\nus.\r\n\r\nTurning from the consideration of slaveholding in its relations to man\r\nas an accountable being, let us examine it in its influence on his\r\npolitical and social state. Though, being foreigners to us, you are in\r\nno wise entitled to interfere with the civil institutions of this\r\ncountry, it has become quite common for your countrymen to decry slavery\r\nas an enormous political evil to us, and even to declare that our\r\nNorthern States ought to withdraw from the Confedracy rather than\r\ncontinue to be contaminated by it. The American abolitionists appear to\r\nconcur fully in these sentiments, and a portion, at least, of them are\r\nincessantly threatening to dissolve the Union. Nor should I be at all\r\nsurprised if they succeed. It would not be difficult, in my opinion, to\r\nconjecture which region, the North or South, would suffer most by such\r\nan event. For one, I should not object, by any means, to cast my lot in\r\na confederacy of States whose citizens might all be slaveholders.\r\n\r\nI indorse without reserve the much abused sentiment of Governor\r\nM'Duffie, that \"slavery is the corner-stone of our republican edifice;\"\r\nwhile I repudiate, as ridiculously absurd, that much lauded but nowhere\r\naccredited dogma of Mr. Jefferson, that \"all men are born equal.\"[255]\r\nNo society has ever yet existed, and I have already incidentally quoted\r\nthe highest authority to show that none ever will exist, without a\r\nnatural variety of classes. The most marked of these must, in a country\r\nlike ours, be the rich and the poor, the educated and the ignorant. It\r\nwill scarcely be disputed that the very poor have less leisure to\r\nprepare themselves for the proper discharge of public duties than the\r\nrich; and that the ignorant are wholly unfit for them at all. In all\r\ncountries save ours, these two classes, or the poor rather, who are\r\npresumed to be necessarily ignorant, are by law expressly excluded from\r\nall participation in the management of public affairs. In a Republican\r\nGovernment this can not be done. Universal suffrage, though not\r\nessential in theory, seems to be in fact a necessary appendage to a\r\nrepublican system. Where universal suffrage obtains, it is obvious that\r\nthe government is in the hands of a numerical majority; and it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that in every part of the world more than half the\r\npeople are ignorant and poor. Though no one can look upon poverty as a\r\ncrime, and we do not here generally regard it as any objection to a man\r\nin his individual capacity, still it must be admitted that it is a\r\nwretched and insecure government which is administered by its most\r\nignorant citizens, and those who have the least at stake under it.\r\nThough intelligence and wealth have great influence here, as everywhere,\r\nin keeping in check reckless and unenlightened numbers, yet it is\r\nevident to close observers, if not to all, that these are rapidly\r\nusurping all power in the non-slaveholding States, and threaten a\r\nfearful crisis in republican institutions there at no remote period. In\r\nthe slaveholding States, however, nearly one-half of the whole\r\npopulation, and those the poorest and most ignorant, have no political\r\ninfluence whatever, because they are slaves. Of the other half, a large\r\nproportion are both educated and independent in their circumstances,\r\nwhile those who unfortunately are not so, being still elevated far above\r\nthe mass, are higher toned and more deeply interested in preserving a\r\nstable and well-ordered government, than the same class in any other\r\ncountry. Hence, slavery is truly the \"corner-stone\" and foundation of\r\nevery well-designed and durable \"republican edifice.\"\r\n\r\nWith us every citizen is concerned in the maintenance of order, and in\r\npromoting honesty and industry among those of the lowest class who are\r\nour slaves; and our habitual vigilance renders standing armies, whether\r\nof soldiers or policemen, entirely unnecessary. Small guards in our\r\ncities, and occasional patrols in the country, insure us a repose and\r\nsecurity known no where else. You can not be ignorant that, excepting\r\nthe United States, there is no country in the world whose existing\r\ngovernment would not be overturned in a month, but for its standing\r\narmies, maintained at an enormous and destructive cost to those whom\r\nthey are destined to overawe--so rampant and combative is the spirit of\r\ndiscontent wherever nominal free labor prevails, with its extensive\r\nprivileges and its dismal servitude. Nor will it be long before the\r\n\"_free States_\" of this Union will be compelled to introduce the same\r\nexpensive machinery, to preserve order among their \"free and equal\"\r\ncitizens. Already has Philadelphia organized a permanent battalion for\r\nthis purpose; New York, Boston and Cincinnati will soon follow her\r\nexample; and then the smaller towns and densely populated counties. The\r\nintervention of their militia to repress violations of the peace is\r\nbecoming a daily affair. A strong government, after some of the old\r\nfashions--though probably with a new name--sustained by the force of\r\narmed mercenaries, is the ultimate destiny of the non-slaveholding\r\nsection of this confederacy, and one which may not be very distant.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to suppose, as is generally done abroad, that in\r\ncase of war slavery would be a source of weakness. It did not weaken\r\nRome, nor Athens, nor Sparta, though their slaves were comparatively far\r\nmore numerous than ours, of the same color for the most part with\r\nthemselves, and large numbers of them familiar with the use of arms. I\r\nhave no apprehension that our slaves would seize such an opportunity to\r\nrevolt. The present generation of them, born among us, would never think\r\nof such a thing at any time, unless instigated to it by others. Against\r\nsuch instigations we are always on our guard. In time of war we should\r\nbe more watchful and better prepared to put down insurrections than at\r\nany other periods. Should any foreign nation be so lost to every\r\nsentiment of civilized humanity, as to attempt to erect among us the\r\nstandard of revolt, or to invade us with black troops, for the base and\r\nbarbarous purpose of stirring up servile war, their efforts would be\r\nsignally rebuked. Our slaves could not be easily seduced, nor would any\r\nthing delight them more than to assist in stripping Cuffee of his\r\nregimentals to put him in the cotton-field, which would be the fate of\r\nmost black invaders, without any very prolix form of \"apprenticeship.\"\r\nIf, as I am satisfied would be the case, our slaves remained peaceful on\r\nour plantations, and cultivated them in time of war under the\r\nsuperintendence of a limited number of our citizens, it is obvious that\r\nwe could put forth more strength in such an emergency, at less\r\nsacrifice, than any other people of the same numbers. And thus we should\r\nin every point of view, \"out of this nettle danger, pluck the flower\r\nsafety.\"\r\n\r\nHow far slavery may be an advantage or disadvantage to those not owning\r\nslaves, yet united with us in political association, is a question for\r\ntheir sole consideration. It is true that our representation in Congress\r\nis increased by it. But so are our taxes; and the non-slaveholding\r\nStates, being the majority, divide among themselves far the greater\r\nportion of the amount levied by the Federal Government. And I doubt not\r\nthat, when it comes to a close calculation, they will not be slow in\r\nfinding out that the balance of profit arising from the connection is\r\nvastly in their favor.\r\n\r\nIn a social point of view the abolitionists pronounce slavery to be a\r\nmonstrous evil. If it was so, it would be our own peculiar concern, and\r\nsuperfluous benevolence in them to lament over it. Seeing their bitter\r\nhostility to us, they might leave us to cope with our own calamities.\r\nBut they make war upon us out of excess of charity, and attempt to\r\npurify by covering us with calumny. You have read and assisted to\r\ncirculate a great deal about affrays, duels and murders, occurring here,\r\nand all attributed to the terrible demoralization of slavery. Not a\r\nsingle event of this sort takes place among us, but it is caught up by\r\nthe abolitionists, and paraded over the world, with endless comments,\r\nvariations and exaggerations. You should not take what reaches you as a\r\nmere sample, and infer that there is a vast deal more you never hear.\r\nYou hear all, and more than all, the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the point of honor is recognized throughout the slave\r\nregion, and that disputes of certain classes are frequently referred for\r\nadjustment, to the \"trial by combat.\" It would not be appropriate for me\r\nto enter, in this letter, into a defense of the practice of duelling,\r\nnor to maintain at length, that it does not tarnish the character of a\r\npeople to acknowledge a standard of honor. Whatever evils may arise from\r\nit, however, they can not be attributed to slavery, since the same\r\ncustom prevails both in France and England. Few of your Prime Ministers,\r\nof the last half century even, have escaped the contagion, I believe.\r\nThe affrays, of which so much is said, and in which rifles, bowie-knives\r\nand pistols are so prominent, occur mostly in the frontier States of the\r\nSouth-West. They are naturally incidental to the condition of society,\r\nas it exists in many sections of these recently settled countries, and\r\nwill as naturally cease in due time. Adventurers from the older States,\r\nand from Europe, as desperate in character as they are in fortune,\r\ncongregate in these wild regions, jostling one another and often forcing\r\nthe peaceable and honest into rencontres in self-defense. Slavery has\r\nnothing to do with these things. Stability and peace are the first\r\ndesires of every slaveholder, and the true tendency of the system. It\r\ncould not possibly exist amid the eternal anarchy and civil broils of\r\nthe ancient Spanish dominions in America. And for this very reason,\r\ndomestic slavery has ceased there. So far from encouraging strife, such\r\nscenes of riot and bloodshed, as have within the last few years\r\ndisgraced our Northern cities, and as you have lately witnessed in\r\nBirmingham and Bristol and Wales, not only never have occurred, but I\r\nwill venture to say, never will occur in our slaveholding States. The\r\nonly thing that can create a mob (as you might call it) here, is the\r\nappearance of an abolitionist, whom the people assemble to chastise. And\r\nthis is no more of a mob, than a rally of shepherds to chase a wolf out\r\nof their pastures would be one.\r\n\r\nBut we are swindlers and repudiators? Pennsylvania is not a slave State.\r\nA majority of the States which have failed to meet their obligations\r\npunctually are non-slaveholding; and two-thirds of the debt said to be\r\nrepudiated is owed by these States. Many of the States of this Union are\r\nheavily encumbered with debt--none so hopelessly as England.\r\nPennsylvania owes $22 for each inhabitant--England $222, counting her\r\npaupers in. Nor has there been any repudiation definite and final, of a\r\nlawful debt, that I am aware of. A few States have failed to pay some\r\ninstallments of interest. The extraordinary financial difficulties which\r\noccurred a few years ago will account for it. Time will set all things\r\nright again. Every dollar of both principal and interest, owed by any\r\nState, North or South, will be ultimately paid, _unless the abolition of\r\nslavery overwhelms us all in one common ruin_. But have no other nations\r\nfailed to pay? When were the French Assignats redeemed? How much\r\ninterest did your National Bank pay on its immense circulation, from\r\n1797 to 1821, during which period that circulation was inconvertible,\r\nand for the time _repudiated_? How much of your national debt has been\r\nincurred for money borrowed to meet the interest on it, thus avoiding\r\ndelinquency in detail, by insuring inevitable bankruptcy and repudiation\r\nin the end? And what sort of operation was that by which your present\r\nMinistry recently expunged a handsome amount of that debt, by\r\nsubstituting, through a process just not compulsory, one species of\r\nsecurity for another? I am well aware that the faults of others do not\r\nexcuse our own, but when failings are charged to slavery, which are\r\nshown to occur to equal extent where it does not exist, surely slavery\r\nmust be acquitted of the accusation.\r\n\r\nIt is roundly asserted, that we are not so well educated nor so\r\nreligious here as elsewhere. I will not go into tedious statistical\r\nstatements on these subjects. Nor have I, to tell the truth, much\r\nconfidence in the details of what are commonly set forth as statistics.\r\nAs to education, you will probably admit that slaveholders should have\r\nmore leisure for mental culture than most people. And I believe it is\r\ncharged against them, that they are peculiarly fond of power, and\r\nambitious of honors. If this be so, as all the power and honors of this\r\ncountry are won mainly by intellectual superiority, it might be fairly\r\npresumed, that slaveholders would not be neglectful of education. In\r\nproof of the accuracy of this presumption, I point you to the facts,\r\nthat our Presidential chair has been occupied for forty-four out of\r\nfifty-six years, by slaveholders; that another has been recently elected\r\nto fill it for four more, over an opponent who was a slaveholder also;\r\nand that in the Federal Offices and both Houses of Congress,\r\nconsiderably more than a due proportion of those acknowledged to stand\r\nin the first rank are from the South. In this arena, the intellects of\r\nthe free and slave States meet in full and fair competition. Nature\r\nmust have been unusually bountiful to us, or we have been at least\r\nreasonably assiduous in the cultivation of such gifts as she has\r\nbestowed--unless indeed you refer our superiority to moral qualities,\r\nwhich I am sure _you_ will not. More wealthy we are not; nor would mere\r\nwealth avail in such rivalry.\r\n\r\nThe piety of the South is inobtrusive. We think it proves but little,\r\nthough it is a confident thing for a man to claim that he stands higher\r\nin the estimation of his Creator, and is less a sinner than his\r\nneighbor. If vociferation is to carry the question of religion, the\r\nNorth, and probably the Scotch, have it. Our sects are few, harmonious,\r\npretty much united among themselves, and pursue their avocations in\r\nhumble peace. In fact, our professors of religion seem to think--whether\r\ncorrectly or not--that it is their duty \"to do good in secret,\" and to\r\ncarry their holy comforts to the heart of each individual, without\r\nreference to class _or color_, for his special enjoyment, and not with a\r\nview to exhibit their zeal before the world. So far as numbers are\r\nconcerned, I believe our clergymen, when called on to make a showing,\r\nhave never had occasion to blush, if comparisons were drawn between the\r\nfree and slave States. And although our presses do not teem with\r\ncontroversial pamphlets, nor our pulpits shake with excommunicating\r\nthunders, the daily walk of our religious communicants furnishes,\r\napparently, as little food for gossip as is to be found in most other\r\nregions. It may be regarded as a mark of our want of excitability--though\r\nthat is a quality accredited to us in an eminent degree--that few of the\r\nremarkable religious _Isms_ of the present day have taken root among us.\r\nWe have been so irreverent as to laugh at Mormonism and Millerism, which\r\nhave created such commotions further North; and modern prophets have no\r\nhonor in our country. Shakers, Rappists, Dunkers, Socialists,\r\nFourrierists, and the like, keep themselves afar off. Even Puseyism has\r\nnot yet moved us. You may attribute this to our domestic slavery if you\r\nchoose. I believe you would do so justly. There is no material here for\r\nsuch characters to operate upon.\r\n\r\nBut your grand charge is, that licentiousness in intercourse between the\r\nsexes, is a prominent trait of our social system, and that it\r\nnecessarily arises from slavery. This is a favorite theme with the\r\nabolitionists, male and female. Folios have been written on it. It is a\r\ncommon observation, that there is no subject on which ladies of eminent\r\nvirtue so much delight to dwell, and on which in especial learned old\r\nmaids, like Miss Martineau, linger with such an insatiable relish. They\r\nexpose it in the slave States with the most minute observance and\r\nendless iteration. Miss Martineau, with peculiar gusto, relates a series\r\nof scandalous stories, which would have made Boccacio jealous of her\r\npen, but which are so ridiculously false as to leave no doubt, that some\r\nwicked wag, knowing she would write a book, has furnished her\r\nmaterials--a game too often played on tourists in this country. The\r\nconstant recurrence of the female abolitionists to this topic, and their\r\nbitterness in regard to it, cannot fail to suggest to even the most\r\ncharitable mind, that\r\n\r\n          \"Such rage without betrays the fires within.\"\r\n\r\nNor are their immaculate coadjutors of the other sex, though perhaps\r\nless specific in their charges, less violent in their denunciations. But\r\nrecently in your island, a clergyman has, at a public meeting,\r\nstigmatized the whole slave region as a \"brothel.\" Do these people thus\r\ncast stones, being \"without sin?\" Or do they only\r\n\r\n          \"Compound for sins they are inclined to\r\n          By damning those they have no mind to.\"\r\n\r\nAlas that David and Solomon should be allowed to repose in peace--that\r\nLeo should be almost canonized, and Luther more than sainted--that in\r\nour own day courtezans should be formally licensed in Paris, and\r\ntenements in London rented for years to women of the town for the\r\nbenefit of the church, with the knowledge of the bishop--and the poor\r\nslave States of America alone pounced upon, and offered up as a\r\nholocaust on the altar of immaculateness, to atone for the abuse of\r\nnatural instinct by all mankind; and if not actually consumed, at least\r\nexposed, anathematized and held up to scorn, by those who\r\n\r\n                                             \"Write,\r\n          Or with a rival's or an eunuch's spite.\"\r\n\r\nBut I do not intend to admit that this charge is just or true. Without\r\nmeaning to profess uncommon modesty, I will say that I wish the topic\r\ncould be avoided. I am of opinion, and I doubt not every right-minded\r\nman will concur, that the public exposure and discussion of this vice,\r\neven to rebuke, invariably does more harm than good; and that if it\r\ncannot be checked by instilling pure and virtuous sentiments, it is far\r\nworse than useless to attempt to do it, by exhibiting its deformities. I\r\nmay not, however, pass it over; nor ought I to feel any delicacy in\r\nexamining a question, to which the slaveholder is invited and challenged\r\nby clergymen and virgins. So far from allowing, then, that\r\nlicentiousness pervades this region, I broadly assert, and I refer to\r\nthe records of our courts, to the public press, and to the knowledge of\r\nall who have ever lived here, that among our white population there are\r\nfewer cases of divorce, separation, crim. con., seduction, rape and\r\nbastardy, than among any other five millions of people on the civilized\r\nearth. And this fact I believe will be conceded by the abolitionists of\r\nthis country themselves. I am almost willing to refer it to them and\r\nsubmit to their decision on it. I would not hesitate to do so, if I\r\nthought them capable of an impartial judgment on any matter where\r\nslavery is in question. But it is said, that the licentiousness consists\r\nin the constant intercourse between white males and colored females. One\r\nof your heavy charges against us has been, that we regard and treat\r\nthose people as brutes; you now charge us with habitually taking them to\r\nour bosoms. I will not comment on the inconsistency of these\r\naccusations. I will not deny that some intercourse of the sort does take\r\nplace. Its character and extent, however, are grossly and atrociously\r\nexaggerated. No authority, divine or human, has yet been found\r\nsufficient to arrest all such irregularities among men. But it is a\r\nknown fact, that they are perpetrated here, for the most part, in the\r\ncities. Very few mulattoes are reared on our plantations. In the cities,\r\na large proportion of the inhabitants do not own slaves. A still larger\r\nproportion are natives of the North, or foreigners. They should share,\r\nand justly, too, an equal part in this sin with the slaveholders. Facts\r\ncannot be ascertained, or I doubt not, it would appear that they are the\r\nchief offenders. If the truth be otherwise, then persons from abroad\r\nhave stronger prejudices against the African race than we have. Be this\r\nas it may, it is well known, that this intercourse is regarded in our\r\nsociety as highly disreputable. If carried on habitually, it seriously\r\naffects a man's standing, so far as it is known; and he who takes a\r\ncolored mistress--with rare and extraordinary exceptions--loses caste at\r\nonce. You will say that _one_ exception should damn our whole country.\r\nHow much less criminal is it to take a white mistress? In your eyes it\r\nshould be at least an equal offense. Yet look around you at home, from\r\nthe cottage to the throne, and count how many mistresses are kept in\r\nunblushing notoriety, without loss of caste. Such cases are nearly\r\nunknown here, and down even to the lowest walks of life, it is almost\r\ninvariably fatal to a man's position and prospects to keep a mistress\r\nopenly, whether white or black. What Miss Martineau relates of a young\r\nman's purchasing a colored concubine from a lady, and avowing his\r\ndesigns, is too absurd even for contradiction. No person would dare to\r\nallude to such a subject, in such a manner, to any decent female in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, the number of the mixed breed, in proportion to that\r\nof the black, is infinitely small, and out of the towns next to nothing.\r\nAnd when it is considered that the African race has been among us for\r\ntwo hundred years, and that those of the mixed breed continually\r\nintermarry--often rearing large families--it is a decided proof of our\r\ncontinence, that so few comparatively are to be found. Our misfortunes\r\nare two-fold. From the prolific propagation of these mongrels among\r\nthemselves, we are liable to be charged by tourists with delinquencies\r\nwhere none have been committed, while, where one has been, it cannot be\r\nconcealed. Color marks indelibly the offense, and reveals it to every\r\neye. Conceive that, even in your virtuous and polished country, if every\r\nbastard, through all the circles of your social system, was thus branded\r\nby nature and known to all, what shocking developments might there not\r\nbe! How little indignation might your saints have to spare for the\r\nlicentiousness of the slave region. But I have done with this disgusting\r\ntopic. And I think I may justly conclude, after all the scandalous\r\ncharges which tea-table gossip, and long-gowned hypocrisy have brought\r\nagainst the slaveholders, that a people whose men are proverbially\r\nbrave, intellectual and hospitable, and whose women are unaffectedly\r\nchaste, devoted to domestic life, and happy in it, can neither be\r\ndegraded nor demoralized, whatever their institutions may be. My decided\r\nopinion is, that our system of slavery contributes largely to the\r\ndevelopment and culture of those high and noble qualities.\r\n\r\nIn an economical point of view--which I will not omit--slavery presents\r\nsome difficulties. As a general rule, I agree it must be admitted, that\r\nfree labor is cheaper than slave labor. It is a fallacy to suppose that\r\nours is _unpaid labor_. The slave himself must be paid for, and thus\r\nhis labor is all purchased at once, and for no trifling sum. His price\r\nwas, in the first place, paid mostly to your countrymen, and assisted in\r\nbuilding up some of those colossal English fortunes, since illustrated\r\nby patents of nobility, and splendid piles of architecture, stained and\r\ncemented, if you like the expression, with the blood of kidnapped\r\ninnocents; but loaded with no heavier curses than abolition and its\r\nbegotten fanaticisms have brought upon your land--some of them\r\nfulfilled, some yet to be. But besides the first cost of the slave, he\r\nmust be fed and clothed, well fed and well clothed, if not for\r\nhumanity's sake, that he may do good work, retain health and life, and\r\nrear a family to supply his place. When old or sick, he is a clear\r\nexpense, and so is the helpless portion of his family. No poor law\r\nprovides for him when unable to work, or brings up his children for our\r\nservice when we need them. These are all heavy charges on slave labor.\r\nHence, in all countries where the denseness of the population has\r\nreduced it to a matter of perfect certainty, that labor can be obtained,\r\nwhenever wanted, and the laborer be forced, by sheer necessity, to hire\r\nfor the smallest pittance that will keep soul and body together, and\r\nrags upon his back while in actual employment--dependent at all other\r\ntimes on alms or poor rates--in all such countries it is found cheaper\r\nto pay this pittance, than to clothe, feed, nurse, support through\r\nchildhood, and pension in old age, a race of slaves. Indeed, the\r\nadvantage is so great as speedily to compensate for the loss of the\r\nvalue of the slave. And I have no hesitation in saying, that if I could\r\ncultivate my lands on these terms, I would, without a word, resign my\r\nslaves, provided they could be properly disposed of. But the question\r\nis, whether free or slave labor is cheapest to us in this country, at\r\nthis time, situated as we are. And it is decided at once by the fact\r\nthat we can not avail ourselves of any other than slave labor. We\r\nneither have, nor can we procure, other labor to any extent, or on any\r\nthing like the terms mentioned. We must, therefore, content ourselves\r\nwith our dear labor, under the consoling reflection that what is lost to\r\nus, is gained to humanity; and that, inasmuch as our slave costs us more\r\nthan your free men costs you, by so much is he better off. You will\r\npromptly say, emancipate your slaves, and then you will have free labor\r\non suitable terms. That might be if there were five hundred where there\r\nnow is one, and the continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, was as\r\ndensely populated as your Island. But until that comes to pass, no labor\r\ncan be procured in America on the terms you have it.\r\n\r\nWhile I thus freely admit that to the individual proprietor slave labor\r\nis dearer than free, I do not mean to admit as equally clear that it is\r\ndearer to the community and to the State. Though it is certain that the\r\nslave is a far greater consumer than your laborer, the year round, yet\r\nyour pauper system is costly and wasteful. Supported by your community\r\nat large, it is not administered by your hired agents with that\r\ninterested care and economy--not to speak of humanity--which mark the\r\nmanagement of ours, by each proprietor, for his own non-effectives; and\r\nis both more expensive to those who pay, and less beneficial to those\r\nwho receive its bounties. Besides this, slavery is rapidly filling up\r\nour country with a hardy and healthy race, peculiarly adapted to our\r\nclimate and productions, and conferring signal political and social\r\nadvantages on us as a people, to which I have already referred.\r\n\r\nI have yet to reply to the main ground on which you and your coadjutors\r\nrely for the overthrow of our system of slavery. Failing in all your\r\nattempts to prove that it is sinful in its nature, immoral in its\r\neffects, a political evil, and profitless to those who maintain it, you\r\nappeal to the sympathies of mankind, and attempt to arouse the world\r\nagainst us by the most shocking charges of tyranny and cruelty. You\r\nbegin by a vehement denunciation of \"the irresponsible power of one man\r\nover his fellow men.\" The question of the responsibility of power is a\r\nvast one. It is the great political question of modern times. Whole\r\nnations divide off upon it and establish different fundamental systems\r\nof government. That \"responsibility,\" which to one set of millions seems\r\namply sufficient to check the government, to the support of which they\r\ndevote their lives and fortunes, appears to another set of millions a\r\nmere mockery of restraint. And accordingly as the opinions of these\r\nmillions differ, they honor each other with the epithets of \"serfs\" or\r\n\"anarchists.\" It is ridiculous to introduce such an idea as this into\r\nthe discussion of a mere domestic institution; but since you have\r\nintroduced it, I deny that the power of the slaveholder in America is\r\n\"irresponsible.\" He is responsible to God. He is responsible to the\r\nworld--a responsibility which abolitionists do not intend to allow him\r\nto evade--and in acknowledgment of which, I write you this letter. He\r\nis responsible to the community in which he lives, and to the laws under\r\nwhich he enjoys his civil rights. Those laws do not permit him to kill,\r\nto maim, or to punish beyond certain limits, or to overtask, or to\r\nrefuse to feed and clothe his slave. In short, they forbid him to be\r\ntyrannical or cruel. If any of these laws have grown obsolete, it is\r\nbecause they are so seldom violated, that they are forgotten. You have\r\ndisinterred one of them, from a compilation by some Judge Stroud of\r\nPhiladelphia, to stigmatize its inadequate penalties for killing,\r\nmaiming, etc. Your object appears to be--you can have no other--to\r\nproduce the impression, that it must be often violated on account of its\r\ninsufficiency. You say as much, and that it marks our estimate of the\r\nslave. You forget to state that this law was enacted by _Englishmen_,\r\nand only indicates _their_ opinion of the reparation due for these\r\noffenses. Ours is proved by the fact, though perhaps unknown to Judge\r\nStroud or yourself, that we have essentially altered this law; and the\r\nmurder of a slave has for many years been punishable with death in this\r\nState. And so it is, I believe, in most or all of the slave States. You\r\nseem well aware, however, that laws have been recently passed in all\r\nthese States, making it penal to teach slaves to read. Do you know what\r\noccasioned their passage, and renders their stringent enforcement\r\nnecessary? I can tell you. It was the abolition agitation. If the slave\r\nis not allowed to read his Bible, the sin rests upon the abolitionists;\r\nfor they stand prepared to furnish him with a key to it, which would\r\nmake it, not a book of hope, and love, and peace, but of despair, hatred\r\nand blood; which would convert the reader, not into a Christian, but a\r\ndemon. To preserve him from such a horrid destiny, it is a sacred duty\r\nwhich we owe to our slaves, not less than to ourselves, to interpose the\r\nmost decisive means. If the Catholics deem it wrong to trust the Bible\r\nto the hands of ignorance, shall we be excommunicated because we will\r\nnot give it, and with it the corrupt and fatal commentaries of the\r\nabolitionists, to our slaves? Allow our slaves to read your writings,\r\nstimulating them to cut our throats! Can you believe us to be such\r\nunspeakable fools?\r\n\r\nI do not know that I can subscribe in full to the sentiment so often\r\nquoted by the abolitionists, and by Mr. Dickinson in his letter to me:\r\n\"_Homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto_,\" as translated and\r\npractically illustrated by them. Such a doctrine would give wide\r\nauthority to every one for the most dangerous intermeddling with the\r\naffairs of others. It will do in poetry--perhaps in some sorts of\r\nphilosophy--but the attempt to make it a household maxim, and introduce\r\nit into the daily walks of life, has caused many a \"homo\" a broken\r\ncrown; and probably will continue to do it. Still, though a slaveholder,\r\nI freely acknowledge my obligations as a man; and that I am bound to\r\ntreat humanely the fellow-creatures whom God has intrusted to my charge.\r\nI feel, therefore, somewhat sensitive under the accusation of cruelty,\r\nand disposed to defend myself and fellow-slaveholders against it. It is\r\ncertainly the interest of all, and I am convinced that it is also the\r\ndesire of every one of us, to treat our slaves with proper kindness. It\r\nis necessary to our deriving the greatest amount of profit from them. Of\r\nthis we are all satisfied. And you snatch from us the only consolation\r\nwe Americans could derive from the opprobrious imputation of being\r\nwholly devoted to making money, which your disinterested and\r\ngold-despising countrymen delight to cast upon us, when you nevertheless\r\ndeclare that we are ready to sacrifice it for the pleasure of being\r\ninhuman. You remember that Mr. Pitt could not get over the idea that\r\nself-interest would insure kind treatment to slaves, until you told him\r\nyour woful stories of the middle passage. Mr. Pitt was right in the\r\nfirst instance, and erred, under your tuition, in not perceiving the\r\ndifference between a temporary and permanent ownership of them.\r\nSlaveholders are no more perfect than other men. They have passions.\r\nSome of them, as you may suppose, do not at all times restrain them.\r\nNeither do husbands, parents and friends. And in each of these\r\nrelations, as serious suffering as frequently arises from uncontrolled\r\npassions, as ever does in that of master and slave, and with as little\r\nchance of indemnity. Yet you would not on that account break them up. I\r\nhave no hesitation in saying that our slaveholders are kind masters, as\r\nmen usually are kind husbands, parents and friends--as a general rule,\r\nkinder. A bad master--he who overworks his slaves, provides ill for\r\nthem, or treats them with undue severity--loses the esteem and respect\r\nof his fellow-citizens to as great an extent as he would for the\r\nviolation of any of his social and most of his moral obligations. What\r\nthe most perfect plan of management would be, is a problem hard to\r\nsolve. From the commencement of slavery in this country, this subject\r\nhas occupied the minds of all slaveholders, as much as the improvement\r\nof the general condition of mankind has those of the most ardent\r\nphilanthropists; and the greatest progressive amelioration of the system\r\nhas been effected. You yourself acknowledge that in the early part of\r\nyour career you were exceedingly anxious for the _immediate_ abolition\r\nof the slave trade, lest those engaged in it should so mitigate its\r\nevils as to destroy the force of your arguments and facts. The\r\nimprovement you then _dreaded_ has gone on steadily here, and would\r\ndoubtless have taken place in the slave trade, but for the measures\r\nadopted to suppress it.\r\n\r\nOf late years we have not only been annoyed, but greatly embarrassed in\r\nthis matter, by the abolitionists. We have been compelled to curtail\r\nsome privileges; we have been debarred from granting new ones. In the\r\nface of discussions which aim at loosening all ties between master and\r\nslave, we have in some measure to abandon our efforts to attach them to\r\nus, and control them through their affections and pride. We have to rely\r\nmore and more on the power of fear. We must, in all our intercourse with\r\nthem, assert and maintain strict mastery, and impress it on them that\r\nthey are slaves. This is painful to us, and certainly no present\r\nadvantage to them. But it is the direct consequence of the abolition\r\nagitation. We are determined to continue masters, and to do so we have\r\nto draw the rein tighter and tighter day by day to be assured that we\r\nhold them in complete check. How far this process will go on, depends\r\nwholly and solely on the abolitionists. When they desist, we can relax.\r\nWe may not before. I do not mean by all this to say that we are in a\r\nstate of actual alarm and fear of our slaves; but under existing\r\ncircumstances we should be ineffably stupid not to increase our\r\nvigilance and strengthen our hands. You see some of the fruits of your\r\nlabors. I speak freely and candidly--not as a colonist, who, though a\r\nslaveholder, has a master; but as a free white man, holding, under God,\r\nand resolved to hold, my fate in my own hands; and I assure you that my\r\nsentiments, and feelings, and determinations, are those of every\r\nslaveholder in this country.\r\n\r\nThe research and ingenuity of the abolitionists, aided by the invention\r\nof run-away slaves--in which faculty, so far as improvizing falsehood\r\ngoes, the African race is without a rival--have succeeded in shocking\r\nthe world with a small number of pretended instances of our barbarity.\r\nThe only wonder is, that considering the extent of our country, the\r\nvariety of our population, its fluctuating character, and the publicity\r\nof all our transactions, the number of cases is so small. It speaks well\r\nfor us. Yet of these, many are false, all highly colored, some occurring\r\nhalf a century, most of them many years ago; and no doubt a large\r\nproportion of them perpetrated by foreigners. With a few rare\r\nexceptions, the emigrant Scotch and English are the worst masters among\r\nus, and next to them our Northern fellow-citizens. Slaveholders born and\r\nbred here are always more humane to slaves, and those who have grown up\r\nto a large inheritance of them, the most so of any--showing clearly that\r\nthe effect of the system is to foster kindly feelings. I do not mean so\r\nmuch to impute innate inhumanity to foreigners, as to show that they\r\ncome here with false notions of the treatment usual and necessary for\r\nslaves, and that newly acquired power here, as everywhere else, is apt\r\nto be abused. I cannot enter into a detailed examination of the cases\r\nstated by the abolitionists. It would be disgusting, and of little\r\navail. I know nothing of them. I have seen nothing like them, though\r\nborn and bred here, and have rarely heard of any thing at all to be\r\ncompared to them. Permit me to say that I think most of _your_ facts\r\nmust have been drawn from the West Indies, where undoubtedly slaves were\r\ntreated much more harshly than with us. This was owing to a variety of\r\ncauses, which might, if necessary, be stated. One was, that they had at\r\nfirst to deal more extensively with barbarians fresh from the wilds of\r\nAfrica; another, and a leading one, the absenteeism of proprietors.\r\nAgents are always more unfeeling than owners, whether placed over West\r\nIndian or American slaves, or Irish tenantry. We feel this evil greatly\r\neven here. You describe the use of _thumb screws_, as one mode of\r\npunishment among us. I doubt if a thumb screw can be found in America. I\r\nnever saw or heard of one in this country. Stocks are rarely used by\r\nprivate individuals, and confinement still more seldom, though both are\r\ncommon punishments for whites, all the world over. I think they should\r\nbe more frequently resorted to with slaves, as substitutes for flogging,\r\nwhich I consider the most injurious and least efficacious mode of\r\npunishing them for serious offenses. It is not degrading, and unless\r\nexcessive, occasions little pain. You may be a little astonished, after\r\nall the flourishes that have been made about \"cart whips,\" etc., when I\r\nsay flogging is not the most degrading punishment in the world. It may\r\nbe so to a white man in most countries, but how is it to the white boy?\r\nThat necessary coadjutor of the schoolmaster, the \"birch,\" is never\r\nthought to have rendered infamous the unfortunate victim of pedagogue\r\nire; nor did Solomon in his wisdom dream that he was counseling parents\r\nto debase their offspring, when he exhorted them not to spoil the child\r\nby sparing the rod. Pardon me for recurring to the now exploded ethics\r\nof the Bible. Custom, which, you will perhaps agree, makes most things\r\nin this world good or evil, has removed all infamy from the punishment\r\nof the lash to the slave. Your blood boils at the recital of stripes\r\ninflicted on a man; and you think you should be frenzied to see your own\r\nchild flogged. Yet see how completely this is ideal, arising from the\r\nfashions of society. You doubtless submitted to the rod yourself, in\r\nother years, when the smart was perhaps as severe as it would be now;\r\nand you have never been guilty of the folly of revenging yourself on the\r\nPreceptor, who, in the plenitude of his \"irresponsible power,\" thought\r\nproper to chastise your son. So it is with the negro, and the negro\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nAs to chains and irons, they are rarely used; never, I believe, except\r\nin cases of running away. You will admit that if we pretend to own\r\nslaves, they must not be permitted to abscond whenever they see fit; and\r\nthat if nothing else will prevent it, these means must be resorted to.\r\nSee the inhumanity necessarily arising from slavery, you will exclaim.\r\nAre such restraints imposed on no other class of people, giving no more\r\noffense? Look to your army and navy. If your seamen, impressed from\r\ntheir peaceful occupations, and your soldiers, recruited at the\r\ngin-shops--both of them as much kidnapped as the most unsuspecting\r\nvictim of the slave trade, and doomed to a far more wretched fate--if\r\nthese men manifest a propensity to desert, the heaviest manacles are\r\ntheir mildest punishment. It is most commonly death, after summary\r\ntrial. But armies and navies, you say, are indispensable, and must be\r\nkept up at every sacrifice. I answer, that they are no more\r\nindispensable than slavery is to us--and to _you_; for you have enough\r\nof it in your country, though the form and name differ from ours.\r\n\r\nDepend upon it that many things, and in regard to our slaves, most\r\nthings which appear revolting at a distance, and to slight reflection,\r\nwould, on a nearer view and impartial comparison with the customs and\r\nconduct of the rest of mankind, strike you in a very different light.\r\nRemember that on our estates we dispense with the whole machinery of\r\npublic police and public courts of justice. Thus we try, decide, and\r\nexecute the sentences, in thousands of cases, which in other countries\r\nwould go into the courts. Hence, most of the acts of our alleged\r\ncruelty, which have any foundation in truth. Whether our patriarchal\r\nmode of administering justice is less humane than the Assizes, can only\r\nbe determined by careful inquiry and comparison. But this is never done\r\nby the abolitionists. All our punishments are the outrages of\r\n\"irresponsible power.\" If a man steals a pig in England, he is\r\ntransported--torn from wife, children, parents, and sent to the\r\nantipodes, infamous, and an outcast forever, though probably he took\r\nfrom the superabundance of his neighbor to save the lives of his\r\nfamishing little ones. If one of our well fed negroes, merely for the\r\nsake of fresh meat, steals a pig, he gets perhaps forty stripes. If one\r\nof your cottagers breaks into another's house, he is hung for burglary.\r\nIf a slave does the same here, a few lashes, or it may be, a few hours\r\nin the stocks, settles the matter. Are our courts or yours the most\r\nhumane? If slavery were not in question, you would doubtless say ours is\r\nmistaken lenity. Perhaps it often is; and slaves too lightly dealt with\r\nsometimes grow daring. Occasionally, though rarely, and almost always in\r\nconsequence of excessive indulgence, an individual rebels. This is the\r\nhighest crime he can commit. It is treason. It strikes at the root of\r\nour whole system. His life is justly forfeited, though it is never\r\nintentionally taken, unless after trial in our public courts. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, in capturing, or in self-defense, he is unfortunately killed. A\r\nlegal investigation always follows. But, terminate as it may, the\r\nabolitionists raise a hue and cry, and another \"shocking case\" is held\r\nup to the indignation of the world by tender-hearted male and female\r\nphilanthropists, who would have thought all right had the master's\r\nthroat been cut, and would have triumphed in it.\r\n\r\nI cannot go into a detailed comparison between the penalties inflicted\r\non a slave in our patriarchal courts, and those of the Courts of\r\nSessions, to which freemen are sentenced in all civilized nations; but I\r\nknow well that if there is any fault in our criminal code, it is that of\r\nexcessive mildness.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a few general facts will best illustrate the treatment this race\r\nreceives at our hands. It is acknowledged that it increases at least as\r\nrapidly as the white. I believe it is an established law, that\r\npopulation thrives in proportion to its comforts. But when it is\r\nconsidered that these people are not recruited by immigration from\r\nabroad, as the whites are, and that they are usually settled on our\r\nrichest and least healthy lands, the fact of their equal comparative\r\nincrease and greater longevity, outweighs a thousand abolition\r\nfalsehoods, in favor of the leniency and providence of our management of\r\nthem. It is also admitted that there are incomparably fewer cases of\r\ninsanity and suicide among them than among the whites. The fact is, that\r\namong the slaves of the African race these things are almost wholly\r\nunknown. However frequent suicide may have been among those brought from\r\nAfrica, I can say that in my time I cannot remember to have known or\r\nheard of a single instance of deliberate self-destruction, and but of\r\none of suicide at all. As to insanity, I have seen but one permanent\r\ncase of it, and that twenty years ago. It cannot be doubted that among\r\nthree millions of people there must be some insane and some suicides;\r\nbut I will venture to say that more cases of both occur annually among\r\nevery hundred thousand of the population of Great Britain, than among\r\nall our slaves. Can it be possible, then, that they exist in that state\r\nof abject misery, goaded by constant injuries, outraged in their\r\naffections, and worn down with hardships, which the abolitionists\r\ndepict, and so many ignorant and thoughtless persons religiously\r\nbelieve?\r\n\r\nWith regard to the separation of husbands and wives, parents and\r\nchildren, nothing can be more untrue than the inferences drawn from what\r\nis so constantly harped on by abolitionists. Some painful instances\r\nperhaps may occur. Very few that can be prevented. It is, and it always\r\nhas been, an object of prime consideration with our slaveholders, to\r\nkeep families together. Negroes are themselves both perverse and\r\ncomparatively indifferent about this matter. It is a singular trait,\r\nthat they almost invariably prefer forming connections with slaves\r\nbelonging to other masters, and at some distance. It is, therefore,\r\nimpossible to prevent separations sometimes, by the removal of one\r\nowner, his death, or failure, and dispersion of his property. In all\r\nsuch cases, however, every reasonable effort is made to keep the parties\r\ntogether, if they desire it. And the negroes forming these connections,\r\nknowing the chances of their premature dissolution, rarely complain more\r\nthan we all do of the inevitable strokes of fate. Sometimes it happens\r\nthat a negro prefers to give up his family rather than separate from his\r\nmaster. I have known such instances. As to willfully selling off a\r\nhusband, or wife, or child, I believe it is rarely, very rarely done,\r\nexcept when some offense has been committed demanding \"transportation.\"\r\nAt sales of estates, and even at sheriff's sales, they are always, if\r\npossible, sold in families. On the whole, notwithstanding the migratory\r\ncharacter of our population, I believe there are more families among our\r\nslaves, who have lived and died together without losing a single member\r\nfrom their circle, except by the process of nature, and in the enjoyment\r\nof constant, uninterrupted communion, than have flourished in the same\r\nspace of time, and among the same number of civilized people in modern\r\ntimes. And to sum up all, if pleasure is correctly defined to be the\r\nabsence of pain--which, so far as the great body of mankind is\r\nconcerned, is undoubtedly its true definition--I believe our slaves are\r\nthe happiest three millions of human beings on whom the sun shines. Into\r\ntheir Eden is coming Satan in the guise of an abolitionist.\r\n\r\nAs regards their religious condition, it is well known that a majority\r\nof the communicants of the Methodist and Baptist churches of the South\r\nare colored. Almost everywhere they have precisely the same\r\nopportunities of attending worship that the whites have, and, beside\r\nspecial occasions for themselves exclusively, which they prefer. In many\r\nplaces not so accessible to clergymen in ordinary, missionaries are\r\nsent, and mainly supported by their masters, for the particular benefit\r\nof the slaves. There are none I imagine who may not, if they like, hear\r\nthe gospel preached at least once a month--most of them twice a month,\r\nand very many every week. In our thinly settled country the whites fare\r\nno better. But in addition to this, on plantations of any size, the\r\nslaves who have joined the church are formed into a class, at the head\r\nof which is placed one of their number, acting as deacon or leader, who\r\nis also sometimes a licensed preacher. This class assembles for\r\nreligious exercises weekly, semi-weekly, or oftener, if the members\r\nchoose. In some parts, also, Sunday schools for blacks are established,\r\nand Bible classes are orally instructed by discreet and pious persons.\r\nNow where will you find a laboring population possessed of greater\r\nreligious advantages than these? Not in London, I am sure, where it is\r\nknown that your churches, chapels, and religions meeting-houses, of all\r\nsorts, can not contain one-half of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI have admitted, without hesitation, what it would be untrue and\r\nprofitless to deny, that slaveholders are responsible to the world for\r\nthe humane treatment of the fellow-beings whom God has placed in their\r\nhands. I think it would be only fair for you to admit, what is equally\r\nundeniable, that every man in independent circumstances, all the world\r\nover, and every government, is to the same extent responsible to the\r\nwhole human family, for the condition of the poor and laboring classes\r\nin their own country, and around them, wherever they may be placed, to\r\nwhom God has denied the advantages he has given themselves. If so, it\r\nwould naturally seem the duty of true humanity and rational philanthropy\r\nto devote their time and labor, their thoughts, writings and charity,\r\nfirst to the objects placed as it were under their own immediate charge.\r\nAnd it must be regarded as a clear evasion and skillful neglect of this\r\ncardinal duty, to pass from those whose destitute situation they can\r\nplainly see, minutely examine, and efficiently relieve, to inquire after\r\nthe condition of others in no way intrusted to their care, to exaggerate\r\nevils of which they can not be cognizant, to expend all their sympathies\r\nand exhaust all their energies on these remote objects of their\r\nunnatural, not to say dangerous, benevolence; and finally, to\r\ncalumniate, denounce, and endeavor to excite the indignation of the\r\nworld against their unoffending fellow-creatures for not hastening,\r\nunder their dictation, to redress wrongs which are stoutly and\r\ntruthfully denied, while they themselves go but little further in\r\nalleviating those chargeable on them than openly and unblushingly to\r\nacknowledge them. There may be indeed a sort of merit in doing so much\r\nas to make such an acknowledgment, but it must be very modest if it\r\nexpects appreciation.\r\n\r\nNow I affirm, that in Great Britain the poor and laboring classes of\r\nyour own race and color, not only your fellow-beings, but your\r\n_fellow-citizens_, are more miserable and degraded, morally and\r\nphysically, than our slaves; to be elevated to the actual condition of\r\nwhom, would be to these, _your fellow-citizens_, a most glorious act of\r\n_emancipation_. And I also affirm, that the poor and laboring classes of\r\nour older free States would not be in a much more enviable condition,\r\nbut for our slavery. One of their own Senators has declared in the\r\nUnited States Senate, \"that the repeal of the Tariff would reduce New\r\nEngland to a howling wilderness.\" And the American Tariff is neither\r\nmore or less than a system by which the slave States are plundered for\r\nthe benefit of those States which do not tolerate slavery.\r\n\r\nTo prove what I say of Great Britain to be true, I make the following\r\nextracts from the Reports of Commissioners appointed by Parliament, and\r\npublished by order of the House of Commons. I can make but few and short\r\nones. But similar quotations might be made to any extent, and I defy you\r\nto deny that these specimens exhibit the real condition of your\r\noperatives in every branch of your industry. There is of course a\r\nvariety in their sufferings. But the same incredible amount of toil,\r\nfrightful destitution, and utter want of morals, characterize the lot of\r\nevery class of them.\r\n\r\n_Collieries_--\"I wish to call the attention of the Board to the pits\r\nabout Brampton. The seams are so thin that several of them have only two\r\nfeet headway to all the working. They are worked altogether by boys from\r\neight to twelve years of age, on all-fours, with a dog belt and chain.\r\nThe passages being neither ironed nor wooded, and often an inch or two\r\nthick with mud. In Mr. Barnes' pit these poor boys have to drag the\r\nbarrows with one hundred weight of coal or slack sixty times a day sixty\r\nyards, and the empty barrows back, without once straightening their\r\nbacks, unless they chose to stand under the shaft, and run the risk of\r\nhaving their heads broken by a falling coal.\"--Report on Mines, 1842, p.\r\n71. \"In Shropshire the seams are no more than eighteen or twenty\r\ninches.\"--Ibid, p. 67. \"At the Booth pit,\" says Mr. Scriven, \"I walked,\r\nrode, and crept eighteen hundred yards to one of the nearest\r\nfaces.\"--Ibid. \"Chokedamp, firedamp, wild fire, sulphur and water, at\r\nall times menace instant death to the laborers in these mines.\" \"Robert\r\nNorth, aged 16: Went into the pit at seven years of age, to fill up\r\nskips. I drew about twelve months. When I drew by the girdle and chain\r\nmy skin was broken, and the blood ran down. I durst not say any thing.\r\nIf we said any thing, the butty, and the reeve, who works under him,\r\nwould take a stick and beat us.\"--Ibid. \"The usual punishment for theft\r\nis to place the culprit's head between the legs of one of the biggest\r\nboys, and each boy in the pit--sometimes there are twenty--inflicts\r\ntwelve lashes on the back and rump with a cat.\"--Ibid. \"Instances occur\r\nin which children are taken into these mines to work as early as four\r\nyears of age, sometimes at five, not unfrequently at six and seven,\r\nwhile from eight to nine is the ordinary age at which these employments\r\ncommence.\"--Ibid. \"The wages paid at these mines is from two dollar\r\nfifty cents to seven dollars fifty cents per month for laborers,\r\naccording to age and ability, and out of this they must support\r\nthemselves. They work twelve hours a day.\"--Ibid.\r\n\r\n_In Calico Printing._--\"It is by no means uncommon in all the districts\r\nfor children five or six years old to be kept at work fourteen to\r\nsixteen hours consecutively.\"--Report on Children, 1842, p. 59.\r\n\r\nI could furnish extracts similar to these in regard to every branch of\r\nyour manufactures, but I will not multiply them. Every body knows that\r\nyour operatives habitually labor from twelve to sixteen hours, men,\r\nwomen, and children, and the men occasionally twenty hours per day. In\r\nlace-making, says the last quoted report, children sometimes commence\r\nwork at two years of age.\r\n\r\n_Destitution._--It is stated by your Commissioners that forty thousand\r\npersons in Liverpool, and fifteen thousand in Manchester, live in\r\ncellars; while twenty-two thousand in England pass the night in barns,\r\ntents, or the open air. \"There have been found such occurrences as\r\nseven, eight, and ten persons in one cottage, I cannot say for one day,\r\nbut for whole days, without a morsel of food. They have remained on\r\ntheir beds of straw for two successive days, under the impression that\r\nin a recumbent posture the pangs of hunger were less felt.\"--Lord\r\nBrougham's Speech, 11th July, 1842. A volume of frightful scenes might\r\nbe quoted to corroborate the inferences to be necessarily drawn from the\r\nfacts here stated. I will not add more, but pass on to the important\r\ninquiry as to\r\n\r\n_Morals and Education._--\"Elizabeth Barrett, aged 14: I always work\r\nwithout stockings, shoes, or trowsers. I wear nothing but a shift. I\r\nhave to go up to the headings with the men. _They are all naked there._\r\nI am got used to that.\"--Report on Mines. \"As to illicit sexual\r\nintercourse it seems to prevail universally, and from an early period of\r\nlife.\" \"The evidence might have been doubled, which attest the early\r\ncommencement of sexual and promiscuous intercourse among boys and\r\ngirls.\" \"A lower condition of morals, in the fullest sense of the term,\r\ncould not, I think, be found. I do not mean by this that there are many\r\nmore prominent vices among them, but that moral feelings and sentiments\r\ndo not exist. _They have no morals._\" \"Their appearance, manners, and\r\nmoral natures--so far as the word _moral_ can be applied to them--are in\r\naccordance with their half-civilized condition.\"--Report on Children.\r\n\"More than half a dozen instances occurred in Manchester, where a man,\r\nhis wife, and his wife's grown-up-sister, habitually occupied the same\r\nbed.\"--Report on Sanitary Condition. \"Robert Crucilow, aged 16: I don't\r\nknow any thing of Moses--never heard of France. I don't know what\r\nAmerica is. Never heard of Scotland or Ireland. Can't tell how many\r\nweeks there are in a year. There are twelve pence in a shilling, and\r\ntwenty shillings in a pound. There are eight pints in a gallon of\r\nale.\"--Report on Mines. \"Ann Eggly, aged 18: I walk about and get fresh\r\nair on Sundays. I never go to church or chapel. I never heard of Christ\r\nat all.\"--Ibid. Others: \"The Lord sent Adam and Eve on earth to save\r\nsinners.\" \"I don't know who made the world; I never heard about God.\" \"I\r\ndon't know Jesus Christ--I never saw him--but I have seen Foster who\r\nprays about him.\" \"Employer: You have expressed surprise at Thomas\r\nMitchel's not hearing of God. I judge there are few colliers here about\r\nthat have.\"--Ibid. I will quote no more. It is shocking beyond endurance\r\nto turn over your records, in which the condition of your laboring\r\nclasses is but too faithfully depicted. Could our slaves but see it,\r\nthey would join us in lynching the abolitionists, which, by the by, they\r\nwould not now be loth to do. We never think of imposing on them such\r\nlabor, either in amount or kind. We never put them to _any work_, under\r\nten, more generally at twelve years of age, and then the very lightest.\r\nDestitution is absolutely unknown--never did a slave starve in America;\r\nwhile in moral sentiments and feelings, in religious information, and\r\neven in general intelligence, they are infinitely the superiors of your\r\noperatives. When you look around you, how dare you talk to us before the\r\nworld of slavery? For the condition of your wretched laborers, you, and\r\nevery Briton who is not one of them, are responsible before God and man.\r\nIf you are really humane, philanthropic, and charitable, here are\r\nobjects for you. Relieve them. Emancipate them. Raise them from the\r\ncondition of brutes, to the level of human beings--of American slaves,\r\nat least. Do not for an instant suppose that the _name_ of being\r\nfreemen is the slightest comfort to them, situated as they are, or that\r\nthe bombastic boast that \"whoever touches British soil stands redeemed,\r\nregenerated, and disenthralled,\" can meet with any thing but the\r\nridicule and contempt of mankind, while that soil swarms, both on and\r\nunder its surface, with the most abject and degraded wretches that ever\r\nbowed beneath the oppressor's yoke.\r\n\r\nI have said that slavery is an established and inevitable condition to\r\nhuman society. I do not speak of the _name_, but the _fact_. The Marquis\r\nof Normanby has lately declared your operatives to be \"_in effect\r\nslaves_.\" Can it be denied? Probably, for such philanthropists as your\r\nabolitionists care nothing for facts. They deal in terms and fictions.\r\nIt is the _word_ \"slavery\" which shocks their tender sensibilities; and\r\ntheir imaginations associate it with \"hydras and chimeras dire.\" The\r\nthing itself, in its most hideous reality, passes daily under their view\r\nunheeded--a familiar face, touching no chord of shame, sympathy or\r\nindignation. Yet so brutalizing is your iron bondage that the English\r\noperative is a by-word through the world. When favoring fortune enables\r\nhim to escape his prison-house, both in Europe and America he is\r\nshunned. \"With all the skill which fourteen hours of daily labor from\r\nthe tenderest age has ground into him, his discontent, which habit has\r\nmade second nature, and his depraved propensities, running riot when\r\nfreed from his wonted fetters, prevent his employment whenever it is not\r\na matter of necessity. If we derived no other benefit from African\r\nslavery in the Southern States than that it deterred your _freedmen_\r\nfrom coming hither, I should regard it an inestimable blessing.\r\n\r\nAnd how unaccountable is that philanthropy, which closes its eyes upon\r\nsuch a state of things as you have at home, and turns its blurred vision\r\nto our affairs beyond the Atlantic, meddling with matters which no way\r\nconcern them--presiding, as you have lately done, at meetings to\r\ndenounce the \"iniquity of our laws\" and \"the atrocity of our practices,\"\r\nand to sympathize with infamous wretches imprisoned here for violating\r\ndecrees promulgated both by God and man? Is this doing the work of \"your\r\nFather which is in heaven,\" or is it seeking only \"that you may have\r\nglory of man?\" Do you remember the denunciation of our Saviour, \"Woe\r\nunto you, Scribes and Pharisees; hypocrites! for ye make clean the\r\noutside of the cup and platter, but within they are full of extortion\r\nand excess.\"\r\n\r\nBut after all, supposing that every thing you say of slavery be true,\r\nand its abolition a matter of the last necessity, how do you expect to\r\neffect emancipation, and what do you calculate will be the result of its\r\naccomplishment? As to the means to be used, the abolitionists, I\r\nbelieve, affect to differ, a large proportion of them pretending that\r\ntheir sole purpose is to apply \"moral suasion\" to the slaveholders\r\nthemselves. As a matter of curiosity, I should like to know what their\r\nidea of this \"moral suasion\" is. Their discourses--yours is no\r\nexception--are all tirades, the exordium, argument and peroration,\r\nturning on the epithets \"tyrants,\" \"thieves,\" \"murderers,\" addressed to\r\nus. They revile us as \"atrocious monsters,\" \"violators of the laws of\r\nnature, God and man,\" our homes the abode of every iniquity, our land a\r\n\"brothel.\" We retort, that they are \"incendiaries\" and \"assassins.\"\r\nDelightful argument! Sweet, potent \"moral suasion!\" What slave has it\r\nfreed--what proselyte can it ever make? But if your course was wholly\r\ndifferent--if you distilled nectar from your lips, and discoursed\r\nsweetest music, could you reasonably indulge the hope of accomplishing\r\nyour object by such means? Nay, supposing that we were all convinced,\r\nand thought of slavery precisely as you do, at what era of \"moral\r\nsuasion\" do you imagine you could prevail on us to give up a thousand\r\nmillions of dollars in the value of our slaves, and a thousand millions\r\nof dollars more in the depreciation of our lands, in consequence of the\r\nwant of laborers to cultivate them? Consider: were ever any people,\r\ncivilized or savage, persuaded by any argument, human or divine, to\r\nsurrender voluntarily two thousand millions of dollars? Would you think\r\nof asking five millions of Englishmen to contribute, either at once or\r\ngradually, four hundred and fifty millions of pounds sterling to the\r\ncause of philanthropy, even if the purpose to be accomplished was not of\r\ndoubtful goodness? If you are prepared to undertake such a scheme, try\r\nit at home. Collect your fund--return us the money for our slaves, and\r\ndo with them as you like. Be all the glory yours, fairly and honestly\r\nwon. But you see the absurdity of such an idea. Away, then, with your\r\npretended \"moral suasion.\" You know it is mere nonsense. The\r\nabolitionists have no faith in it themselves. Those who expect to\r\naccomplish any thing count on means altogether different. They aim,\r\nfirst, to alarm us: that failing, to compel us by force to emancipate\r\nour slaves, at our own risk and cost. To these purposes they obviously\r\ndirect all their energies. Our Northern liberty-men endeavored to\r\ndisseminate their destructive doctrine among our slaves, and excite them\r\nto insurrection. But we have put an end to that, and stricken terror\r\ninto them. They dare not show their faces here. Then they declared they\r\nwould dissolve the Union. Let them do it. The North would repent it far\r\nmore than the South. We are not alarmed at the idea. We are well content\r\nto give up the Union sooner than sacrifice two thousand millions of\r\ndollars, and with them all the rights we prize. You may take it for\r\ngranted that it is impossible to persuade or alarm us into emancipation,\r\nor to making the first step toward it. Nothing, then, is left to try,\r\nbut sheer force. If the abolitionists are prepared to expend their own\r\ntreasure and shed their own blood as freely as they ask us to do ours,\r\nlet them come. We do not court the conflict; but we will not and we\r\ncannot shrink from it. If they are not ready to go so far; if, as I\r\nexpect, their philanthropy recoils from it; if they are looking only for\r\n_cheap_ glory, let them turn their thoughts elsewhere, and leave us in\r\npeace. Be the sin, the danger and the evils of slavery all our own. We\r\ncompel, we ask none to share them with us.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that a notable scheme has been set on foot to achieve\r\nabolition by making what is by courtesy called \"free\" labor so much\r\ncheaper than slave labor as to force the abandonment of the latter.\r\nThough we are beginning to _manufacture with slaves_, I do not think you\r\nwill attempt to pinch your operatives closer in Great Britain. You\r\ncannot curtail the rags with which they vainly attempt to cover their\r\nnakedness, nor reduce the porridge which barely, and not always, keeps\r\nthose who have employment from perishing of famine. When you can do\r\nthis, we will consider whether our slaves may not dispense with a pound\r\nor two of bacon per week, or a few garments annually. Your aim, however,\r\nis to cheapen labor in the tropics. The idea of doing this by exporting\r\nyour \"bold yeomanry\" is, I presume, given up. Cromwell tried it when he\r\n_sold_ the captured followers of Charles into _West Indian slavery_,\r\nwhere they speedily found graves. Nor have your recent experiments on\r\nBritish and even Dutch constitutions succeeded better. Have you still\r\nfaith in carrying thither your coolies from Hindostan? Doubtless that\r\nonce wild robber race, whose highest eulogium was that they did not\r\nmurder merely for the love of blood, have been tamed down, and are\r\nperhaps \"keen for immigration,\" for since your civilization has reached\r\nit, plunder has grown scarce in Guzerat. But what is the result of the\r\nexperiment thus far? Have the coolies, ceasing to handle arms, learned\r\nto handle spades, and proved hardy and profitable laborers? On the\r\ncontrary, broken in spirit and stricken with disease at home, the\r\nwretched victims whom you have hitherto kidnapped for a bounty, confined\r\nin depots, put under hatches and carried across the ocean--forced into\r\n\"voluntary immigration,\" have done little but lie down and die on the\r\n_pseudo_ soil of freedom. At the end of five years two-thirds, in some\r\ncolonies a larger proportion, are no more! Humane and pious contrivance!\r\nTo alleviate the fancied sufferings of the accursed posterity of Ham,\r\nyou sacrifice by a cruel death two-thirds of the children of the blessed\r\nShem--and demand the applause of Christians--the blessing of heaven! If\r\nthis \"experiment\" is to go on, in God's name try your hand upon the\r\nThugs. That other species of \"immigration\" to which you are resorting I\r\nwill consider presently.\r\n\r\nBut what do you calculate will be the result of emancipation, by\r\nwhatever means accomplished? You will probably point me, by way of\r\nanswer, to the West Indies--doubtless to Antigua, the great boast of\r\nabolition. Admitting that it has succeeded there--which I will do for\r\nthe sake of the argument--do you know the reason of it? The true and\r\nonly causes of whatever success has attended it in Antigua are, that the\r\npopulation was before crowded, and all or nearly all the arable land in\r\ncultivation. The emancipated negroes could not, many of them, get away\r\nif they desired; and knew not where to go, in case they did. They had,\r\npractically, no alternative but to remain on the spot; and remaining,\r\nthey must work on the terms of the proprietors, or perish--the strong\r\narm of the mother country forbidding all hope of seizing the land for\r\nthemselves. The proprietors, well knowing that they could thus command\r\nlabor for the merest necessities of life, which was much cheaper than\r\nmaintaining the non-effective as well as effective slaves in a style\r\nwhich decency and interest, if not humanity, required, willingly\r\naccepted half their value, and at once realized far more than the\r\ninterest on the other half in the diminution of their expenses, and the\r\nreduced comforts of the _freemen_. One of your most illustrious judges,\r\nwho was also a profound and philosophical historian, has said \"that\r\nvilleinage was not abolished, but went into decay in England.\" This was\r\nthe process. This has been the process wherever (the name of) villeinage\r\nor slavery has been successfully abandoned. Slavery, in fact, \"went into\r\ndecay\" in Antigua. I have admitted that, under similar circumstances, it\r\nmight profitably cease here--that is, profitably to the individual\r\nproprietors. Give me half the value of my slaves, and compel them to\r\nremain and labor on my plantation, at ten to eleven cents a day, as they\r\ndo in Antigua, supporting themselves and families, and you shall have\r\nthem to-morrow, and if you like dub them \"free.\" Not to stickle, I would\r\nsurrender them without price. No--I recall my words: My humanity revolts\r\nat the idea. I am attached to my slaves, and would not have act or part\r\nin reducing them to such a condition. I deny, however, that Antigua, as\r\na community, is, or ever will be, as _prosperous_ under present\r\ncircumstances, as she was before abolition, though fully ripe for it.\r\nThe fact is well known. The reason is that the African, if not a\r\ndistinct, is an inferior race, and never will effect, as it never has\r\neffected, as much in any other condition as in that of slavery.\r\n\r\nI know of no _slaveholder_ who has visited the West Indies since slavery\r\nwas abolished, and published _his_ views of it. All our facts and\r\nopinions come through the friends of the experiment, or at least those\r\nnot opposed to it. Taking these, even without allowance, to be true as\r\nstated, I do not see where the abolitionists find cause for exultation.\r\nThe tables of exports, which are the best evidences of the condition of\r\na people, exhibit a woful falling off--excused, it is true, by\r\nunprecedented droughts and hurricanes, to which their free labor seems\r\nunaccountably more subject than slave labor used to be. I will not go\r\ninto detail. It is well known that a large proportion of British\r\nlegislation and expenditure, and that proportion still constantly\r\nincreasing, is most anxiously devoted to repairing the monstrous error\r\nof emancipation. You are actually galvanizing your expiring colonies.\r\nThe truth, deduced from all the facts, was thus pithily stated by the\r\n_London Quarterly Review_, as long ago as 1840: \"None of the benefits\r\nanticipated by mistaken good intentions have been realized, while every\r\nevil wished for by knaves and foreesen by the wise has been painfully\r\nverified. The wild rashness of fanaticism has made the emancipation of\r\nthe slaves equivalent to the loss of one-half of the West Indies, and\r\nyet put back the chance of negro civilization.\"--Art. Ld. Dudley's\r\nLetters. Such are the _real fruits_ of your never-to-be-too-much-glorified\r\nabolition, and the valuable dividend of your twenty millions of pounds\r\nsterling invested therein.\r\n\r\nIf any further proof was wanted of the utter and well-known, though not\r\nyet openly avowed, failure of West Indian emancipation, it would be\r\nfurnished by the startling fact, that THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE HAS BEEN\r\nACTUALLY REVIVED UNDER THE AUSPICES AND PROTECTION OF THE BRITISH\r\nGOVERNMENT. Under the specious guise of \"immigration,\" they are\r\nreplenishing those Islands with slaves from the coast of Africa. Your\r\ncolony of Sierra Leone, founded on that coast to prevent the slave\r\ntrade, and peopled, by the bye, in the first instance, by negroes stolen\r\nfrom these States during the Revolutionary War, is the depot to which\r\ncaptives taken from slavers by your armed vessels are transported. I\r\nmight say returned, since nearly half the Africans carried across the\r\nAtlantic are understood to be embarked in this vicinity. The wretched\r\nsurvivors, who are there set at liberty, are immediately seduced to\r\n\"immigrate\" to the West Indies. The business is systematically carried\r\non by black \"delegates,\" sent expressly from the West Indies, where, on\r\narrival, the \"immigrants\" are _sold into slavery_ for twenty-one years,\r\nunder conditions ridiculously trivial and wickedly void, since few or\r\nnone will ever be able to derive any advantage from them. The whole\r\nprime of life thus passed in bondage, it is contemplated, and doubtless\r\nit will be carried into effect, to turn them out in their old age to\r\nshift for themselves, and to supply their places with fresh and vigorous\r\n\"immigrants.\" Was ever a system of slavery so barbarous devised before?\r\nCan you think of comparing it with ours? Even your own religious\r\nmissionaries at Sierra Leone denounce it \"as worse than the slave state\r\nin Africa.\" And your black delegates, fearful of the influence of these\r\nmissionaries, as well as on account of the inadequate supply of\r\ncaptives, are now preparing to procure the able-bodied and comparatively\r\nindustrious Kroomen of the interior, by _purchasing from their headmen_\r\nthe privilege of inveigling them to the West India market! So ends the\r\nmagnificent farce--perhaps I should say tragedy, of West India\r\nabolition! I will not harrow your feelings by asking you to review the\r\nlabors of your life and tell me what you and your brother enthusiasts\r\nhave accomplished for \"injured Africa,\" but while agreeing with Lord\r\nStowell, that \"villeinage decayed,\" and admitting that slavery might do\r\nso also, I think I am fully justified by passed and passing events in\r\nsaying, as Mr. Grosvenor said of the slave trade, that its _abolition_\r\nis \"impossible.\"\r\n\r\nYon are greatly mistaken, however, if you think that the consequences of\r\nemancipation here would be similar and no more injurious than those\r\nwhich followed from it in your little sea-girt West India Islands, where\r\nnearly all were blacks. The system of slavery is not in \"decay\" with us.\r\nIt flourishes in full and growing vigor. Our country is boundless in\r\nextent. Dotted here and there with villages and fields, it is, for the\r\nmost part, covered with immense forests and swamps of almost unknown\r\nsize. In such a country, with a people so restless as ours,\r\ncommunicating of course some of that spirit to their domestics, can you\r\nconceive that any thing short of the power of the master over the slave,\r\ncould confine the African race, notoriously idle and improvident, to\r\nlabor on our plantations? Break this bond, but for a day, and these\r\nplantations will be solitudes. The negro loves change, novelty, and\r\nsensual excitements of all kinds, _when awake_. \"Reason and order,\" of\r\nwhich Mr. Wilberforce said \"liberty was the child,\" do not characterize\r\nhim. Released from his present obligations, his first impulse would be\r\nto go somewhere. And here no natural boundaries would restrain him. At\r\nfirst they would all seek the towns, and rapidly accumulate in squalid\r\ngroups upon their outskirts. Driven thence by the \"armed police,\" which\r\nwould immediately spring into existence, they would scatter in all\r\ndirections. Some bodies of them might wander toward the \"free\" States,\r\nor to the Western wilderness, marking their tracks by their depredations\r\nand their corpses. Many would roam wild in our \"big woods.\" Many more\r\nwould seek the recesses of our swamps for secure covert. Few, very few\r\nof them, could be prevailed on to do a stroke of work, none to labor\r\ncontinuously, while a head of cattle, sheep or swine could be found in\r\nour ranges, or an ear of corn nodded in our abandoned fields. These\r\nexhausted, our folds and poultry yards, barns and store-houses, would\r\nbecome their prey. Finally, our scattered dwellings would be plundered,\r\nperhaps fired, and the inmates murdered. How long do you suppose that we\r\ncould bear these things? How long would it be before we should sleep\r\nwith rifles at our bedsides, and never move without one in our hands?\r\nThis work once begun, let the story of our British ancestors and the\r\naborigines of this country tell the sequel. Far more rapid, however,\r\nwould be the catastrophe. \"Ere many moons went by,\" the African race\r\nwould be exterminated, or reduced again to slavery, their ranks\r\nrecruited, after your example, by fresh \"emigrants\" from their\r\nfatherland.\r\n\r\nIs timely preparation and gradual emancipation suggested to avert these\r\nhorrible consequences? I thought your experience in the West Indies had,\r\nat least, done so much as to explode that idea. If it failed there, much\r\nmore would it fail here, where the two races, approximating to equality\r\nin numbers, are daily and hourly in the closest contact. Give room for\r\nbut a single spark of real jealousy to be kindled between them, and the\r\nexplosion would be instantaneous and universal. It is the most fatal of\r\nall fallacies, to suppose that these two races can exist together, after\r\nany length of time, or any process of preparation, on terms at all\r\napproaching to equality. Of this, both of them are finally and fixedly\r\nconvinced. They differ essentially, in all the leading traits which\r\ncharacterize the varieties of the human species, and color draws an\r\nindelible and insuperable line of separation between them. Every scheme\r\nfounded upon the idea that they can remain together on the same soil,\r\nbeyond the briefest period, in any other relation than precisely that\r\nwhich now subsists between them, is not only preposterous, but fraught\r\nwith deepest danger. If there was no alternative but to try the\r\n\"experiment\" here, reason and humility dictate that the sufferings of\r\n\"gradualism\" should be saved, and the catastrophe of \"immediate\r\nabolition\" enacted as rapidly as possible. Are you impatient for the\r\nperformance to commence? Do you long to gloat over the scenes I have\r\nsuggested, but could not hold the pen to portray? In your long life many\r\nsuch have passed under your review. You know that _they_ are not\r\n\"_impossible_.\" Can they be to your taste? Do you believe that in\r\nlaboring to bring them about, the abolitionists are doing the will of\r\nGod? No! God is not there. It is the work of Satan. The arch-fiend,\r\nunder specious guises, has found his way into their souls, and with\r\nfalse appeals to philanthropy, and foul insinuations to ambition,\r\ninstigates them to rush headlong to the accomplishment of his diabolical\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nWe live in a wonderful age. The events of the last three quarters of a\r\ncentury appear to have revolutionized the human mind. Enterprise and\r\nambition are only limited in their purposes by the horizon of the\r\nimagination. It is the transcendental era. In philosophy, religion,\r\ngovernment, science, arts, commerce, nothing that has been is to be\r\nallowed to be. Conservatism, in any form, is scoffed at. The slightest\r\ntaint of it is fatal. Where will all this end? If you can tolerate one\r\nancient maxim, let it be that the best criterion of the future is the\r\npast. That, if any thing, will give a clue. And, looking back only\r\nthrough your time, what was the earliest feat of this same\r\ntranscendentalism? The rays of the new moral Drummond Light were first\r\nconcentrated to a focus at Paris, to illuminate the universe. In a\r\ntwinkling it consumed the political, religious and social systems of\r\nFrance. It could not be extinguished there until literally drowned in\r\nblood. And then, from its ashes arose that supernatural man, who, for\r\ntwenty years, kept affrighted Europe in convulsions. Since that time,\r\nits scattered beams, refracted by broader surfaces, have, nevertheless,\r\ncontinued to scathe wherever they have fallen. What political structure,\r\nwhat religious creed, but has felt the galvanic shock, and even now\r\ntrembles to its foundations? Mankind, still horror-stricken by the\r\ncatastrophe of France, have shrunk from rash experiments upon social\r\nsystems. But they have been practicing in the East, around the\r\nMediterranean, and through the West India Islands. And growing\r\nconfident, a portion of them seem desperately bent on kindling the\r\nall-devouring flame in the bosom of our land. Let it once again blaze up\r\nto heaven, and another cycle of blood and devastation will dawn upon the\r\nworld. For our own sake, and for the sake of those infatuated men who\r\nare madly driving on the conflagration; for the sake of human nature, we\r\nare called on to strain every nerve to arrest it. And be assured our\r\nefforts will be bounded only with our being. Nor do I doubt that five\r\nmillions of people, brave, intelligent, united, and prepared to hazard\r\nevery thing, will, in such a cause, with the blessing of God, sustain\r\nthemselves. At all events, come what may, it is ours to meet it.\r\n\r\nWe are well aware of the light estimation in which the abolitionists,\r\nand those who are taught by them, profess to hold us. We have seen the\r\nattempt of a portion of the Free Church of Scotland to reject our alms\r\non the ground that we are \"slave-drivers,\" after sending missionaries\r\nto solicit them. And we have seen Mr. O'Connell, the \"irresponsible\r\nmaster\" of millions of ragged serfs, from whom, poverty stricken as they\r\nare, he contrives to wring a splendid privy purse, throw back with\r\ncontumely, the \"tribute\" of his own countrymen from this land of\r\n\"miscreants.\" These people may exhaust their slang, and make blackguards\r\nof themselves, but they cannot defile us. And as for the suggestion to\r\nexclude slaveholders from your London clubs, we scout it. Many of us,\r\nindeed, do go to London, and we have seen your breed of gawky lords,\r\nboth there and here, but it never entered into our conceptions to look\r\non them as better than ourselves. The American slaveholders,\r\ncollectively or individually, ask no favors of any man or race who tread\r\nthe earth. In none of the attributes of men, mental or physical, do they\r\nacknowledge or fear superiority elsewhere. They stand in the broadest\r\nlight of the knowledge, civilization and improvement of the age, as much\r\nfavored of heaven as any of the sons of Adam. Exacting nothing undue,\r\nthey yield nothing but justice and courtesy, even to royal blood. They\r\ncannot be flattered, duped, nor bullied out of their rights or their\r\npropriety. They smile with contempt at scurrility and vaporing beyond\r\nthe seas, and they turn their backs upon it where it is \"irresponsible;\"\r\nbut insolence that ventures to look them in the face, will never fail to\r\nbe chastised.\r\n\r\nI think I may trust you will not regard this letter as intrusive. I\r\nshould never have entertained an idea of writing it, had you not opened\r\nthe correspondence. If you think any thing in it harsh, review your\r\nown--which I regret that I lost soon after it was received--and you will\r\nprobably find that you have taken your revenge beforehand. If you have\r\nnot, transfer an equitable share of what you deem severe, to the account\r\nof the abolitionists at large. They have accumulated against the\r\nslaveholders a balance of invective, which, with all our efforts, we\r\nshall not be able to liquidate much short of the era in which your\r\nnational debt will be paid. At all events, I have no desire to offend\r\nyou personally, and, with the best wishes for your continued health, I\r\nhave the honor to be,\r\n\r\n                                          Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                       J.

C., March 24, 1845.\r\n\r\nSIR--In my letter to you of the 28th January--which I trust you have\r\nreceived ere this--I mentioned that I had lost your circular letter soon\r\nafter it had come to hand. It was, I am glad to say, only mislaid, and\r\nhas within a few days been recovered. A second perusal of it induces me\r\nto resume my pen. Unwilling to trust my recollections from a single\r\nreading, I did not, in my last communication, attempt to follow the\r\ncourse of your argument, and meet directly the points made and the terms\r\nused. I thought it better to take a general view of the subject, which\r\ncould not fail to traverse your most material charges. I am well aware,\r\nhowever, that for fear of being tedious, I omitted many interesting\r\ntopics altogether, and abstained from a complete discussion of some of\r\nthose introduced. I do not propose now to _exhaust_ the subject; which\r\nit would require volumes to do; but without waiting to learn--which I\r\nmay never do--your opinion of what I have already said, I sit down to\r\nsupply some of the deficiencies of my letter of January, and, with your\r\ncircular before me, to reply to such parts of it as have not been fully\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nIt is, I perceive, addressed, among others, to \"such as have never\r\nvisited the Southern States\" of this confederacy, and professes to\r\nenlighten their ignorance of the actual \"condition of the poor slave in\r\ntheir own country.\" I can not help thinking you would have displayed\r\nprudence in confining the circulation of your letter altogether to such\r\npersons. You might then have indulged with impunity in giving, as you\r\nhave done, a picture of slavery, drawn from your own excited\r\nimagination, or from those impure fountains, the Martineaus, Marryatts,\r\nTrollopes, and Dickenses, who have profited by catering, at our expense,\r\nto the jealous sensibilities and debauched tastes of your countrymen.\r\nAdmitting that you are familiar with the history of slavery, and the\r\npast discussions of it, as I did, I now think rather broadly, in my\r\nformer letter, what can _you know_ of the true _condition_ of the \"poor\r\nslave\" here? I am not aware that you have ever visited this country, or\r\neven the West Indies. Can you suppose, that because you have devoted\r\nyour life to the investigation of the subject--commencing it under the\r\ninfluence of an enthusiasm, so melancholy at first, and so volcanic\r\nafterwards, as to be nothing short of hallucination--pursuing it as men\r\nof _one idea_ do every thing, with the single purpose of establishing\r\nyour own view of it--gathering your information from discharged seamen,\r\ndisappointed speculators, factious politicians, visionary reformers and\r\nscurrilous tourists--opening your ears to every species of complaint,\r\nexaggeration and falsehood, that interested ingenuity could invent, and\r\nnever for a moment questioning the truth of any thing that could make\r\nfor your cause--can you suppose that all this has qualified you, living\r\nthe while in England, to form or approximate toward the formation of a\r\ncorrect opinion of the condition of slaves among us? I know the power of\r\nself-delusion. I have not the least doubt, that you think yourself the\r\nvery best informed man alive on this subject, and that many think so\r\nlikewise. So far as facts go, even after deducting from your list a\r\ngreat deal that is not fact, I will not deny that, probably, your\r\ncollection is the most extensive in existence. But as to the _truth_ in\r\nregard to slavery, there is not an adult in this region but knows more\r\nof it than you do. _Truth_ and _fact_ are, you are aware, by no means\r\nsynonymous terms. Ninety-nine facts may constitute a falsehood: the\r\nhundredth, added or alone, gives the truth. With all your knowledge of\r\nfacts, I undertake to say that you are entirely and grossly ignorant of\r\nthe real condition of our slaves. And from all that I can see, you are\r\nequally ignorant of the essential principles of human association\r\nrevealed in history, both sacred and profane, on which slavery rests,\r\nand which will perpetuate it forever in some form or other. However you\r\nmay declaim against it; however powerfully you may array atrocious\r\nincidents; whatever appeals you may make to the heated imaginations and\r\ntender sensibilities of mankind, believe me, your total blindness to the\r\n_whole truth_, which alone constitutes _the truth_, incapacitates you\r\nfrom ever making an impression on the sober reason and sound common\r\nsense of the world. You may seduce thousands--you can convince no one.\r\nWhenever and wherever you or the advocates of your cause can arouse the\r\npassions of the weak-minded and the ignorant, and bringing to bear with\r\nthem the interests of the vicious and unprincipled, overwhelm common\r\nsense and reason--as God sometimes permits to be done--you may triumph.\r\nSuch a triumph we have witnessed in Great Britain. But I trust it is far\r\ndistant here; nor can it, from its nature, be extensive or enduring.\r\nOther classes of reformers, animated by the same spirit as the\r\nabolitionists, attack the institution of marriage, and even the\r\nestablished relations of parent and child. And they collect instances of\r\nbarbarous cruelty and shocking degradation, which rival, if they do not\r\nthrow into the shade, your slavery statistics. But the rights of\r\nmarriage and parental authority rests upon truths as obvious as they are\r\nunchangeable--coming home to every human being,--self-impressed forever\r\non the individual mind, and can not be shaken until the whole man is\r\ncorrupted, nor subverted until civilized society becomes a putrid mass.\r\nDomestic slavery is not so universally understood, nor can it make such\r\na direct appeal to individuals or society beyond its pale. Here,\r\nprejudice and passion have room to sport at the expense of others. They\r\nmay be excited and urged to dangerous action, remote from the victims\r\nthey mark out. They may, as they have done, effect great mischief, but\r\nthey can not be made to maintain, in the long run, dominion over reason\r\nand common sense, nor ultimately put down what God has ordained.\r\n\r\nYou deny, however, that slavery is sanctioned by God, and your chief\r\nargument is, that when he gave to Adam dominion over the fruits of the\r\nearth and the animal creation, he stopped there. \"He never gave him any\r\nfurther right over his fellow-men.\" You restrict the descendants of Adam\r\nto a very short list of rights and powers, duties and responsibities, if\r\nyou limit them solely to those conferred and enjoined in the first\r\nchapter of Genesis. It is very obvious that in this narrative of the\r\nCreation, Moses did not have it in view to record any part of the law\r\nintended for the government of man in his social or political state. Eve\r\nwas not yet created; the expulsion had not yet taken place; Cain was\r\nunborn; and no allusion whatever is made to the manifold decrees of God\r\nto which these events gave rise. The only serious answer this argument\r\ndeserves, is to say, what is so manifestly true, that God's not\r\nexpressly giving to Adam \"any right over his fellow-men\" by no means\r\nexcluded him from conferring that right on his descendants; which he in\r\nfact did. We know that Abraham, the chosen one of God, exercised it and\r\nheld property in his fellow-man, even anterior to the period when\r\nproperty in land was acknowledged. We might infer that God had\r\nauthorized it. But we are not reduced to inference or conjecture. At the\r\nhazard of fatiguing you by repetition, I will again refer you to the\r\nordinances of the Scriptures. Innumerable instances might be quoted\r\nwhere God has given and commanded men to assume dominion over their\r\nfellow-men. But one will suffice. In the twenty-fifth chapter of\r\nLeviticus, you will find _domestic slavery--precisely such as is\r\nmaintained at this day in these States--ordained and established by God,\r\nin language which I defy you to pervert so as to leave a doubt on any\r\nhonest mind that this institution was founded by him, and decreed to be\r\nperpetual_. I quote the words:\r\n\r\nLeviticus xxv. 44-46: \"Both thy bond-men and thy bond-maids which thou\r\nshalt have, shall be of the heathen [Africans] that are round about you:\r\nof _them ye shall buy bond-men and bond-maids_.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you,\r\nof them shall ye buy, _and of their families that are with you which\r\nthey begat in your land_ [descendants of Africans?] and they shall be\r\nyour possession.\r\n\r\n\"_And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you,\r\nto inherit them for a possession._ THEY SHALL BE YOUR BOND-MEN FOREVER.\"\r\n\r\nWhat human legislature could make a decree more full and explicit than\r\nthis? What court of law or chancery could defeat a title to a slave\r\ncouched in terms so clear and complete as these? And this is the _law of\r\nGod_, whom you pretend to worship, while you denounce and traduce us for\r\nrespecting it.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely credible, but the fact is so, that you deny this law\r\nso plainly written, and in the face of it have the hardihood to declare\r\nthat \"though slavery is not _specifically_, yet it is _virtually_,\r\n_forbidden_ in the Scriptures, because all the crimes which necessarily\r\narises out of slavery, and which can arise from no other source, are\r\nreprobated there and threatened with divine vengeance.\" Such an unworthy\r\nsubterfuge is scarcely entitled to consideration. But its gross\r\nabsurdity may be exposed in few words. I do not know what crimes you\r\nparticularly allude to as arising from slavery. But you will perhaps\r\nadmit--not because they are denounced in the decalogue, which the\r\nabolitionists respect only so far as they choose, but because it is the\r\n_immediate interest_ of most men to admit--that disobedience to parents,\r\nadultery, and stealing, are crimes. Yet these crimes \"necessarily arise\r\nfrom\" the relations of parent and child, marriage, and the possession of\r\nprivate property; at least they \"can arise from no other sources.\" Then,\r\naccording to your argument, it is \"virtually forbidden\" to marry, to\r\nbeget children, and to hold private property! Nay, it is forbidden to\r\nlive, since murder can only be perpetrated on living subjects. You add\r\nthat \"in the same way the gladiatorial shows of old, and other barbarous\r\ncustoms, were not specifically forbidden in the New Testament, and yet\r\nChristianity was the sole means of their suppression.\" This is very\r\ntrue. But these shows and barbarous customs thus suppressed were not\r\n_authorised by God_. They were not ordained and commanded by God for the\r\nbenefit of his chosen people and mankind, as the purchase and holding of\r\nbond-men and bond-maids were. Had they been they would never have been\r\n\"suppressed by Christianity\" any more than slavery can be by your party.\r\nAlthough Christ came \"not to destroy but fulfill the law,\" he\r\nnevertheless did formally abrogate some of the ordinances promulgated by\r\nMoses, and all such as were at war with his mission of \"peace and\r\ngood-will on earth.\" He \"specifically\" annuls, for instance, one\r\n\"barbarous custom\" sanctioned by those ordinances, where he says, \"ye\r\nhave heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a\r\ntooth; but I say unto you that ye resist not evil, but whosoever shall\r\nsmite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" Now, in the\r\ntime of Christ, it was usual for masters to put their slaves to death on\r\nthe slightest provocation. They even killed and cut them up to feed\r\ntheir fishes. He was undoubtedly aware of these things, as well as of\r\nthe law and commandment I have quoted. He could only have been\r\nrestrained from denouncing them, as he did the \"_lex talionis_,\" because\r\nhe knew that in despite of these barbarities the institution of slavery\r\nwas at the bottom a sound and wholesome, as well as lawful one. Certain\r\nit is, that in his wisdom and purity he did not see proper to interfere\r\nwith it. In your wisdom, however, you make the sacrilegious attempt to\r\noverthrow it.\r\n\r\nYou quote the denunciation of Tyre and Sidon, and say that \"the chief\r\nreason given by the prophet Joel for their destruction, was, that they\r\nwere notorious beyond all others for carrying on the slave trade.\" I am\r\nafraid you think we have no Bibles in the slave States, or that we are\r\nunable to read them. I can not otherwise account for your making this\r\nreference, unless indeed your own reading is confined to an expurgated\r\nedition, prepared for the use of abolitionists, in which every thing\r\nrelating to slavery that militates against their view of it is left out.\r\nThe prophet Joel denounces the Tyrians and Sidonians, because \"the\r\nchildren also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto\r\nthe Grecians.\" And what is the divine vengeance for this \"notorious\r\nslave trading?\" Hear it. \"And I will sell your sons and daughters into\r\nthe hands of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the\r\nSabeans, to a people far off; for the Lord hath spoken it.\" Do you call\r\nthis a condemnation of slave trading? The prophet makes God himself a\r\nparticipator in the crime, if that be one. \"The Lord hath spoken it,\" he\r\nsays, that the Tyrians and Sidonians shall be _sold into slavery to\r\nstrangers_. Their real offense was, in enslaving the chosen people; and\r\ntheir sentence was a repetition of the old command, to make slaves of\r\nthe heathen round about.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon your scriptural argument, because you profess to\r\nbelieve the Bible; because a large proportion of the abolitionists\r\nprofess to do the same, and to act under its sanction; because your\r\ncircular is addressed in part to \"professing Christians;\" and because it\r\nis from that class mainly that you expect to seduce converts to your\r\nanti-christian, I may say, infidel doctrines. It would be wholly\r\nunnecessary to answer you, to any one who reads the Scriptures for\r\nhimself, and construes them according to any other formula than that\r\nwhich the abolitionists are wickedly endeavoring to impose upon the\r\nworld. The scriptural sanction of slavery is in fact so palpable, and so\r\nstrong, that both wings of your party are beginning to acknowledge it.\r\nThe more sensible and moderate admit, as the organ of the Free Church of\r\nScotland, the _North British Review_, has lately done, that they \"_are\r\nprecluded by the statements and conduct of the Apostles from regarding\r\nmere slaveholding as essentially sinful_,\" while the desperate and\r\nreckless, who are bent on keeping up the agitation at every hazard,\r\ndeclare, as has been done in the _Anti-Slavery Record_, \"If our inquiry\r\nturns out in favor of slavery, IT IS THE BIBLE THAT MUST FALL, AND NOT\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF HUMAN NATURE.\" You can not, I am satisfied, much longer\r\nmaintain before the world the Christian platform from which to wage war\r\nupon our institutions. Driven from it, you must abandon the contest, or,\r\nrepudiating REVELATION, rush into the horrors of NATURAL RELIGION.\r\n\r\nYou next complain that our slaves are kept in bondage by the \"law of\r\nforce.\" In what country or condition of mankind do you see human affairs\r\nregulated merely by the law of love? Unless I am greatly mistaken, you\r\nwill, if you look over the world, find nearly all certain and permanent\r\nrights, civil, social, and I may even add religious, resting on and\r\nultimately secured by the \"law of force.\" The power of majorities--of\r\naristocracies--of kings--nay of priests, for the most part, and of\r\nproperty, resolves itself at last into \"force,\" and could not otherwise\r\nbe long maintained. Thus, in every turn of your argument against our\r\nsystem of slavery, you advance, whether conscious of it or not, radical\r\nand revolutionary doctrines calculated to change the whole face of the\r\nworld, to overthrow all government, disorganize society, and reduce man\r\nto a state of nature--red with blood, and shrouded once more in barbaric\r\nignorance. But you greatly err, if you suppose, because we rely on force\r\nin the last resort to maintain our supremacy over our slaves, that ours\r\nis a stern and unfeeling domination, at all to be compared in\r\nhard-hearted severity to that exercised, not over the mere laborer only,\r\nbut by the higher over each lower order, wherever the British sway is\r\nacknowledged. You say, that if those you address were \"to spend one day\r\nin the South, they would return home with impressions against slavery\r\nnever to be erased.\" But the fact is universally the reverse. I have\r\nknown numerous instances, and I never knew a single one, where there was\r\nno other cause of offense, and no object to promote by falsehood, that\r\nindividuals from the non-slaveholding States did not, after residing\r\namong us long enough to understand the subject, \"return home\" _to defend\r\nour slavery_. It is matter of regret that you have never tried the\r\nexperiment yourself. I do not doubt you would have been converted, for I\r\ngive you credit for an honest though perverted mind. You would have seen\r\nhow weak and futile is all abstract reasoning about this matter, and\r\nthat, as a building may not be less elegant in its proportions, or\r\ntasteful in its ornaments, or virtuous in its uses, for being based upon\r\ngranite, so a system of human government, though founded on force, may\r\ndevelope and cultivate the tenderest and purest sentiments of the human\r\nheart. And our patriarchal scheme of domestic servitude is indeed well\r\ncalculated to awaken the higher and finer feelings of our nature. It is\r\nnot wanting in its enthusiasm and its poetry. The relations of the most\r\nbeloved and honored chief, and the most faithful and admiring subjects,\r\nwhich, from the time of Homer, have been the theme of song, are frigid\r\nand unfelt compared with those existing between the master and his\r\nslaves--who served his father, and rocked his cradle, or have been born\r\nin his household, and look forward to serve his children--who have been\r\nthrough life the props of his fortune, and the objects of his care--who\r\nhave partaken of his griefs, and looked to him for comfort in their\r\nown--whose sickness he has so frequently watched over and\r\nrelieved--whose holidays he has so often made joyous by his bounties and\r\nhis presence; for whose welfare, when absent, his anxious solicitude\r\nnever ceases, and whose hearty and affectionate greetings never fail to\r\nwelcome him home. In this cold, calculating, ambitious world of ours,\r\nthere are few ties more heartfelt, or of more benignant influence, than\r\nthose which mutually bind the master and the slave, under our ancient\r\nsystem, handed down from the father of Israel. The unholy purpose of the\r\nabolitionists is, to destroy by defiling it; to infuse into it the gall\r\nand bitterness which rankle in their own envenomed bosoms; to poison the\r\nminds of the master and the servant; turn love to hatred, array _\"force\"\r\nagainst force_, and hurl all\r\n\r\n          \"With hideous rain and combustion, down\r\n          To bottomless perdition.\"\r\n\r\nYou think it a great \"crime\" that we do not pay our slaves \"wages,\" and\r\non this account pronounce us \"robbers.\" In my former letter, I showed\r\nthat the labor of our slaves was not without great cost to us, and that\r\nin fact they themselves receive more in return for it than your\r\nhirelings do for theirs. For what purpose do men labor, but to support\r\nthemselves and their families in what comfort they are able? The efforts\r\nof mere physical labor seldom suffice to provide more than a livelihood.\r\nAnd it is a well known and shocking fact, that while few operatives in\r\nGreat Britain succeed in securing a comfortable living, the greater part\r\ndrag out a miserable existence, and sink at last under absolute want.\r\nOf what avail is it that you go through the form of paying them a\r\npittance of what you call \"wages,\" when you do not, in return for their\r\nservices, allow them what alone they ask--and have a just right to\r\ndemand--enough to feed, clothe and lodge them, in health and sickness,\r\nwith reasonable comfort. Though we do not give \"wages\" _in money_, we do\r\nthis for _our slaves_, and they are therefore better rewarded than\r\n_yours_. It is the prevailing vice and error of the age, and one from\r\nwhich the abolitionists, with all their saintly pretensions, are far\r\nfrom being free, to bring every thing to the standard of money. You make\r\ngold and silver the great test of happiness. The American slave must be\r\nwretched indeed, because he is not compensated for his services _in\r\ncash_. It is altogether praiseworthy to pay the laborer a shilling a\r\nday, and let him starve on it. To supply all his wants abundantly, and\r\nat all times, yet withhold from him _money_, is among \"the most\r\nreprobated crimes.\" The fact can not be denied, that the mere laborer is\r\nnow, and always has been, everywhere that barbarism has ceased,\r\nenslaved. Among the innovations of modern times, following \"the decay of\r\nvilleinage,\" has been the creation of a new system of slavery. The\r\nprimitive and patriarchal, which may also be called the sacred and\r\nnatural system, in which the laborer is under the personal control of a\r\nfellow-being endowed with the sentiments and sympathies of humanity,\r\nexists among us. It has been almost everywhere else superseded by the\r\nmodern _artificial money power system_, in which man--his thews and\r\nsinews, his hopes and affections, his very being, are all subjected to\r\nthe dominion of _capital_--a monster without a heart--cold, stern,\r\narithmetical--sticking to the bond--taking ever \"the pound of\r\nflesh\"--working up human life with engines, and retailing it out by\r\nweight and measure. His name of old was \"Mammon, the least erected\r\nspirit that fell from heaven.\" And it is to extend his empire that you\r\nand your deluded coadjutors dedicate your lives. You are stirring up\r\nmankind to overthrow our heaven-ordained system of servitude, surrounded\r\nby innumerable checks, designed and planted deep in the human heart by\r\nGod and nature, to substitute the absolute rule of this \"spirit\r\nreprobate,\" whose proper place was hell.\r\n\r\nYou charge us with looking on our slaves \"as chattels or brutes,\" and\r\nenter into a somewhat elaborate argument to prove that they have \"human\r\nforms,\" \"talk,\" and even \"think.\" Now the fact is, that however you may\r\nindulge in this strain for effect, it is the abolitionists, and not the\r\nslaveholders, who, practically, and in the most important point of view,\r\nregard our slaves as \"chattels or brutes.\" In your calculations of the\r\nconsequences of emancipation, you pass over entirely those which must\r\nprove most serious, and which arise from the fact of their being\r\n_persons_.\r\n\r\nYou appear to think that we might abstain from the use of them as\r\nreadily as if they were machines to be laid aside, or cattle that might\r\nbe turned out to find pasturage for themselves. I have heretofore\r\nglanced at some of the results that would follow from breaking the bonds\r\nof so many _human beings_, now peacefully and happily linked into our\r\nsocial system. The tragic horrors, the decay and ruin that would for\r\nyears, perhaps for ages, brood over our land, if it could be\r\naccomplished, I will not attempt to portray. But do you fancy the blight\r\nwould, in such an event, come to us alone? The diminution of the sugar\r\ncrop of the West Indies affected Great Britain only, and there chiefly\r\nthe poor. It was a matter of no moment to capital, that labor should\r\nhave one comfort less. Yet it has forced a reduction of the British duty\r\non sugar. Who can estimate the consequences that must follow the\r\nannihilation of the cotton crop of the slaveholding States? I do not\r\nundervalue the importance of other articles of commerce, but no calamity\r\ncould befall the world at all comparable to the sudden loss of two\r\nmillions of bales of cotton annually. From the deserts of Africa to the\r\nSiberian wilds--from Greenland to the Chinese wall,--there is not a spot\r\nof earth but would feel the sensation. The factories of Europe would\r\nfall with a concussion that would shake down castles, palaces, and even\r\nthrones; while the \"purse-proud, elbowing insolence\" of our Northern\r\nmonopolist would soon disappear forever under the smooth speech of the\r\npedlar, scourging our frontiers for a livelihood, or the bluff vulgarity\r\nof the South Sea whaler, following the harpoon amid storms and shoals.\r\nDoubtless the abolitionists think we could grow cotton without slaves,\r\nor that at worst the reduction of the crop would be moderate and\r\ntemporary. Such gross delusions show how profoundly ignorant they are of\r\nour condition here.\r\n\r\nYou declare that \"the character of the people of the South has long been\r\nthat of _hardened infidels_, who fear not God, and have no regard for\r\nreligion.\" I will not repeat what I said in my former letter on this\r\npoint. I only notice it to ask you how you could possibly reconcile it\r\nto your profession of a Christian spirit, to make such a malicious\r\ncharge--to defile your soul with such a calumny against an unoffending\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n                                  \"You are old;\r\n          Nature in you stands on the very verge\r\n          Of her confine. You should be ruled and led\r\n          By some discretion.\"\r\n\r\nMay God forgive you.\r\n\r\nAkin to this, is the wanton and furious assault made on us by Mr.\r\nMacaulay, in his late speech on the sugar duties, in the House of\r\nCommons, which has just reached me. His denunciations are wholly without\r\nmeasure, and, among other things, he asserts \"that slavery in the United\r\nStates wears its worst form; that, boasting of our civilization and\r\nfreedom, and frequenting Christian churches, we breed up slaves, nay,\r\nbeget children for slaves, and sell them at so much a-head.\" Mr.\r\nMacaulay is a reviewer, and he knows that he is \"nothing if not\r\ncritical.\" The practice of his trade has given him the command of all\r\nthe slashing and vituperative phrases of our language, and the turn of\r\nhis mind leads him to the habitual use of them. He is an author, and as\r\nno copy-right law secures for him from this country a consideration for\r\nhis writings, he is not only independent of us, but naturally hates\r\nevery thing American. He is the representative of Edinburgh; it is his\r\ncue to decry our slavery, and in doing so he may safely indulge the\r\nmalignity of his temper, his indignation against us, and his capacity\r\nfor railing. He has suffered once, for being in advance of his time in\r\nfavor of abolition, and he does not intend that it shall be forgotten,\r\nor his claim passed over, to any crumb which may now be thrown to the\r\nvociferators in the cause. If he does not know that the statements he\r\nhas made respecting the slaveholders of this country are vile and\r\natrocious falsehoods, it is because he does not think it worth his while\r\nto be sure he speaks the truth, so that he speaks to his own purpose.\r\n\r\n          \"Hic niger est, hunc tu, Romane caveto.\"\r\n\r\nSuch exhibitions as he has made, may draw the applause of a British\r\nHouse of Commons, but among the sound and high-minded thinkers of the\r\nworld they can only excite contempt and disgust.\r\n\r\nBut you are not content with depriving us of all religious feelings. You\r\nassert that our slavery has also \"demoralized the Northern States,\" and\r\ncharge upon it not only every common violation of good order there, but\r\nthe \"Mormon murders,\" the \"Philadelphia riots,\" and all \"the\r\nexterminating wars against the Indians.\" I wonder that you did not\r\nincrease the list by adding that it had caused the recent inundation of\r\nthe Mississippi, and the hurricane in the West Indies--perhaps the\r\ninsurrection of Rebecca, and the war in Scinde. You refer to the law\r\nprohibiting the transmission of abolition publications through the mail,\r\nas proof of general corruption! You could not do so, however, without\r\nnoticing the late detected espionage over the British post office by a\r\nminister of state. It is true, as you say, it \"occasioned a general\r\noutburst of national feeling\"--from the opposition; and a \"Parliamentary\r\ninquiry was instituted\"--that is, moved, but treated quite cavalierly.\r\nAt all events, though the fact was admitted, Sir James Graham yet\r\nretains the Home Department. For one, I do not undertake to condemn him.\r\nSuch things are not against the laws and usages of your country. I do\r\nnot know fully what reasons of state may have influenced him and\r\njustified his conduct. But I do know that there is a vast difference in\r\npoint of \"national morality\" between the discretionary power residing in\r\nyour government to open any letter in the public post office, and a\r\nwell-defined and limited law to prevent the circulation of certain\r\nspecified incendiary writings by means of the United States mail.\r\n\r\nHaving now referred to every thing like argument on the subject of\r\nslavery, that is worthy of notice in your letter, permit me to remark on\r\nits tone and style, and very extraordinary bearing upon other\r\ninstitutions of this country. You commence by addressing certain classes\r\nof our people, as belonging to \"a nation whose character is _now so low_\r\nin the estimation of the civilized world;\" and throughout you maintain\r\nthis tone. Did the Americans who were \"under your roof last summer\"\r\ninform you that such language would be gratifying to their\r\nfellow-citizens \"having no practical concern with slaveholding?\" Or do\r\nthe infamous libels on America, which you read in our abolition papers,\r\ninduce you to believe that all that class of people are, like the\r\nabolitionists themselves, totally destitute of patriotism or pride of\r\ncountry? Let me tell you that you are grossly deceived. And although\r\nyour stock-brokers and other speculators, who have been bitten in\r\nAmerican ventures, may have raised a stunning \"cry\" against us in\r\nEngland, there is a vast body of people here besides slaveholders, who\r\njustly\r\n\r\n          \"Deem their own land of every land the pride,\r\n          Beloved by heaven o'er all the world beside,\"\r\n\r\nand who _know_ that at this moment we rank among the first powers of the\r\nworld--a position which we not only claim, but are always ready and able\r\nto maintain.\r\n\r\nThe style you assume in addressing your Northern friends, is in perfect\r\nkeeping with your apparent estimation of them. Though I should be the\r\nlast, perhaps, to criticise mere style, I could not but be struck with\r\nthe extremely simple manner of your letter. You seem to have thought you\r\nwere writing a tract for benighted heathen, and telling wonders never\r\nbefore suggested to their imagination, and so far above their untutored\r\ncomprehension as to require to be related in the primitive language of\r\n\"the child's own book.\" This is sufficiently amusing; and would be more\r\nso, but for the coarse and bitter epithets you continually apply to the\r\npoor slaveholders--epithets which appear to be stereotyped for the use\r\nof abolitionists, and which form a large and material part of all their\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, the most extraordinary part of your letter is your bold\r\ndenunciation of \"_the shameful compromises_\" of our Constitution, and\r\nyour earnest recommendation to those you address to overthrow or\r\nrevolutionize it. In so many words you say to them, \"_you must either\r\nseparate yourselves_ from all political connection with the South, and\r\nmake your own laws; or if you do not choose such a separation, you must\r\nbreak up _the political ascendency which the Southern have had for so\r\nlong a time over the Northern States_. The italics in this, as in all\r\nother quotations, are your own. It is well for those who circulate your\r\nletter here, that the Constitution you denounce requires an overt act to\r\nconstitute treason. It may be tolerated for an American by birth, to use\r\non his own soil the freedom of speaking and writing which is guaranteed\r\nhim, and abuse our Constitution, our Union, and our people. But that a\r\nforeigner should use such seditious language, in a circular letter\r\naddressed to a portion of the American people, is a presumption well\r\ncalculated to excite the indignation of all. The party known in this\r\ncountry as the abolition party has long since avowed the sentiments you\r\nexpress, and adopted the policy you enjoin. At the recent presidential\r\nelection, they gave over 62,000 votes for their own candidate, and held\r\nthe balance of power in two of the largest States--wanting but little of\r\ndoing it in several others. In the last four years their vote has\r\nquadrupled. Should the infatuation continue, and their vote increase in\r\nthe same ratio for the next four years, it will be as large as the vote\r\nof the _actual slaveholders_ of the Union. Such a prospect is,\r\ndoubtless, extremely gratifying to you. It gives hope of a contest on\r\nsuch terms as may insure the downfall of slavery or our Constitution.\r\nThe South venerates the Constitution, and is prepared to stand by it\r\nforever, _such as it came from the hands of our fathers_; to risk every\r\nthing to defend and maintain it _in its integrity_. But the South is\r\nunder no such delusion as to believe that it derives any _peculiar_\r\nprotection from the Union. On the contrary, it is well known we incur\r\n_peculiar danger_, and that we bear far more than our porportion of the\r\nburdens. The apprehension is also fast fading away that any of the\r\ndreadful consequences commonly predicted will necessarily result from a\r\nseparation of the States. And _come what may_, we are firmly resolved\r\nthat OUR SYSTEM OF DOMESTIC SLAVERY SHALL STAND. The fate of the Union,\r\nthen--but, thank God, not of republican government--rests mainly in the\r\nhands of the people to whom your letter is addressed--the \"professing\r\nChristians of the Northern States having no concern with slaveholding,\"\r\nand whom with incendiary zeal you are endeavoring to stir up to\r\nstrife--without which fanaticism can neither live, move, nor have any\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nWe have often been taunted for our sensitiveness in regard to the\r\ndiscussion of slavery. Do not suppose it is because we have any doubts\r\nof our rights, or scruples about asserting them. There was a time when\r\nsuch doubts and scruples were entertained. Our ancestors opposed the\r\nintroduction of slaves into this country, and a feeling adverse to it\r\nwas handed down from them. The enthusiastic love of liberty fostered by\r\nour Revolution strengthened this feeling. And before the commencement of\r\nthe abolition agitation here, it was the common sentiment that it was\r\ndesirable to get rid of slavery. Many thought it our duty to do so. When\r\nthat agitation arose, we were driven to a close examination of the\r\nsubject in all its bearings, and the result has been an _universal\r\nconviction_ that in holding slaves we violate no law of God,--inflict no\r\ninjustice on any of his creatures--while the terrible consequences of\r\nemancipation to all parties and the world at large, clearly revealed to\r\nus, make us shudder at the bare thought of it. The slaveholders are,\r\ntherefore, indebted to the abolitionists for perfect ease of conscience,\r\nand the satisfaction of a settled and unanimous determination in\r\nreference to this matter. And could their agitation cease now, I\r\nbelieve, after all, the good would preponderate over the evil of it in\r\nthis country. On the contrary, however, it is urged on with frantic\r\nviolence, and the abolitionists, reasoning in the abstract, as if it\r\nwere a mere moral or metaphysical speculation, or a minor question in\r\npolitics, profess to be surprised at our exasperation. In their\r\nignorance and recklessness, they seem to be unable to comprehend our\r\nfeelings or position. The subversion of our rights, the destruction of\r\nour property, the disturbance of our peace and the peace of the world,\r\nare matters which do not appear to arrest their consideration. When\r\nrevolutionary France proclaimed \"hatred to kings and unity to the\r\nrepublic,\" and inscribed on her banners \"France risen against tyrants,\"\r\nshe professed to be only worshiping \"abstract rights.\" And if there can\r\nbe such things, perhaps she was. Yet all Europe _rose_ to put her\r\nsublime theories down. They declared her an enemy to the common peace;\r\nthat her doctrines alone violated the \"law of neighborhood,\" and, as Mr.\r\nBurke said, justly entitled them to anticipate the \"damnum nondum\r\nfactum\" of the civil law. Danton, Barrere, and the rest were apparently\r\nastonished that umbrage should be taken. The parallel between them and\r\nthe abolitionists holds good in all respects.\r\n\r\nThe rise and progress of this fanaticism is one of the phenomena of the\r\nage in which we live. I do not intend to repeat what I have already\r\nsaid, or to trace its career more minutely at present. But the\r\nlegislation of Great Britain will make it historical, and doubtless you\r\nmust feel some curiosity to know how it will figure on the page of the\r\nannalist. I think I can tell you. Though I have accorded and do accord\r\nto you and your party, great influence in bringing about the\r\nparliamentary action of your country, you must not expect to go down to\r\nposterity as the only cause of it. Though _you_ trace the progenitors of\r\nabolition from 1516, through a long stream with divers branches, down\r\nto the period of its triumph in your country, it has not escaped\r\ncontemporaries, and will not escape posterity, that England, without\r\nmuch effort, sustained the storm of its scoffs and threats, until the\r\nmoment arrived when she thought her colonies fully supplied with\r\nAfricans; and declared against the slave trade, only when she deemed it\r\nunnecessary to her, and when her colonies, full of slaves, would have\r\ngreat advantages over others not so well provided. Nor did she agree to\r\nWest India emancipation, until, discovering the error of her previous\r\ncalculation, it became an object to have slaves free throughout the\r\nWestern world, and, on the ruins of the sugar and cotton-growers of\r\nAmerica and the Islands, to build up her great slave empire in the East;\r\nwhile her indefatigable exertions, still continued, to engraft the right\r\nof search upon the law of nations, on the plea of putting an end to the\r\nforever increasing slave trade, are well understood to have chiefly in\r\nview the complete establishment of her supremacy at sea.[256] Nor must\r\nyou flatter yourself that your party will derive historic dignity from\r\nthe names of the illustrious British statesmen who have acted with it.\r\nTheir country's ends were theirs. They have stooped to use you, as the\r\nmost illustrious men will sometimes use the vilest instruments, to\r\naccomplish their own purposes. A few philanthropic common places and\r\nrhetorical flourishes, \"in the abstract,\" have secured them your \"sweet\r\nvoices,\" and your influence over the tribe of mawkish sentimentalists.\r\nWilberforce may have been yours, but what was he besides, but a wealthy\r\ncounty member? You must, therefore, expect to stand on your own merits\r\nalone before posterity, or rather that portion of it that may be curious\r\nto trace the history of the delusions which, from time to time, pass\r\nover the surface of human affairs, and who may trouble themselves to\r\nlook through the ramifications of transcendentalism, in this era of\r\nextravagances. And how do you expect to appear in their eyes? As\r\nChristians, piously endeavoring to enforce the will of God, and carry\r\nout the principles of Christianity? Certainly not, since you deny or\r\npervert the Scriptures in the doctrines you advance; and in your\r\nconduct, furnish a glaring contrast to the examples of Christ and the\r\napostles. As philanthropists, devoting yourselves to the cause of\r\nhumanity, relieving the needy, comforting the afflicted, creating peace\r\nand gladness and plenty round about you? Certainly not, since you turn\r\nfrom the needy, the afflicted; from strife, sorrow and starvation which\r\nsurround you; close your eyes and hands upon them; shut out from your\r\nthoughts and feelings the human misery which is real, tangible, and\r\nwithin your reach, to indulge your morbid imagination in conjuring up\r\nwoes and wants among a strange people in distant lands, and offering\r\nthem succor in the shape of costless denunciations of their best\r\nfriends, or by scattering among them \"firebrands, arrows and death.\"\r\nSuch folly and madness, such wild mockery and base imposture, can never\r\nwin for you, in the sober judgment of future times, the name of\r\nphilanthropists. Will you even be regarded as worthy citizens? Scarcely,\r\nwhen the purposes you have in view, can only be achieved by\r\nrevolutionizing governments and overturning social systems, and when you\r\ndo not hesitate, zealously and earnestly, to recommend such measures. Be\r\nassured, then, that posterity will not regard the abolitionists as\r\nChristians, philanthropists, or virtuous citizens. It will, I have no\r\ndoubt, look upon the mass of the party as silly enthusiasts, led away by\r\ndesigning characters, as is the case with all parties that break from\r\nthe great, acknowledged ties which bind civilized man in fellowship. The\r\nleaders themselves will be regarded as _mere ambitious men_; not taking\r\nrank with those whose ambition is \"eagle-winged and sky-aspiring,\" but\r\nbelonging to that mean and selfish class, who are instigated by\r\n\"rival-hating envy,\" and whose base thirst is for _notoriety_; who cloak\r\ntheir designs under vile and impious hypocrisies, and, unable to shine\r\nin higher spheres, devote themselves to fanaticism, as a trade. And it\r\nwill be perceived that, even in that, they shunned the highest walk.\r\nReligious fanaticism was an old established vocation, in which something\r\nbrilliant was required to attract attention. They could not be George\r\nFoxes, nor Joanna Southcotes, nor even Joe Smiths. But the dullest\r\npretender could discourse a jumble of pious bigotry, natural rights, and\r\ndriveling philanthropy. And, addressing himself to aged folly and\r\nyouthful vanity, to ancient women, to ill-gotten wealth, to the\r\nreckless of all classes, who love excitement and change, offer each the\r\ncheapest and the safest glory in the market. Hence, their numbers; and,\r\nfrom number and clamor, what impression they have made on the world.\r\n\r\nSuch, I am persuaded, is the light in which the abolitionists will be\r\nviewed by the posterity their history may reach. Unless, indeed--which\r\nGod forbid--circumstances should so favor as to enable them to produce a\r\nconvulsion which may elevate them higher on the \"bad eminence\" where\r\nthey have placed themselves.\r\n\r\n          I have the honor to be\r\n                   Your obedient servant,\r\n                                         J. H. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CLARKSON, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The foregoing Letters were not originally intended for\r\npublication. In preparing them for the press, they have been revised.\r\nThe alterations and corrections made, however, have been mostly verbal.\r\nHad the writer felt at liberty to condense the two letters into one, and\r\nbring up the history of abolition to the period of publication, he might\r\nhave presented a more concise and perfect argument, and illustrated his\r\nviews more forcibly, by reference to facts recently developed. For\r\nexample, since writing the first, the letter of Mr. Clarkson, as\r\nPresident of the British Anti-Slavery Society, to Sir Robert Peel,\r\ndenouncing the whole scheme of \"Immigration,\" has reached him; and after\r\nhe had forwarded the last, he saw it stated, that Mr. Clarkson had, as\r\nlate as the first part of April, addressed the Earl of Aberdeen, and\r\ndeclared, that all efforts to suppress the African slave trade had fully\r\nfailed. It may be confidently expected, that it will be ere long\r\nannounced from the same quarter, that the \"experiment\" of West India\r\nemancipation has also proved a complete abortion.\r\n\r\nShould the terms which have been applied to the abolitionists appear to\r\nany as unduly severe, let it be remembered, that the direct aim of these\r\npeople is to destroy us by the most shocking of all processes; and that,\r\nhaving a large portion of the civilized world for their audience, they\r\ndaily and systematically heap upon us the vilest calumnies and most\r\nunmitigated abuse. Clergymen lay aside their Bibles, and females unsex\r\nthemselves, to carry on this horrid warfare against slave holders.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[256] On these points, let me recommend you to consult a very able Essay\r\non the Slave Trade and Right of Search, by M.

A. CARTWRIGHT, M.D.\r\n\r\nOF LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHT OF ETHNOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY OF THE NEGRO CONSTITUTION, ELICITED BY QUESTIONS PROPOUNDED\r\nBY DR. C. R. HALL, OF TORQUAY, ENGLAND, THROUGH PROF. JACKSON, OF\r\nMASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL COLLEGE, BOSTON, TO SAML. A. CARTWRIGHT, M.D., NEW\r\nORLEANS.\r\n\r\n    [Reprinted from the New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo PROF. JACKSON, Boston:--\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir:_--The paper of mine, alluded to by your London correspondent,\r\nDr. Hall, which he saw in the medical work you mention, is not, as he\r\nsupposes, \"_The Report on the diseases and physical peculiarities of the\r\nNegro race_,\" the physicians of Louisiana, in convention assembled,\r\nappointed me to make; but only some additional observations intended for\r\nstudents and those persons whose want of knowledge of Comparative\r\nAnatomy prevented them from understanding the Report. The Appendix,\r\nintended for students, was published in the _Charleston_ (South\r\nCarolina) _Medical Journal_, and also in the work you mention, under the\r\ncaption of the original Report to the Medical Convention, and _the\r\nReport itself was omitted_ by the editors of those works under the\r\nerroneous impression, that the Appendix for students contained the\r\nsubstance of that paper; whereas it does so only in the sense that the\r\nfour first rules contain the substance of the arithmetic. No wonder your\r\nintelligent correspondent should not find, in the Appendix of the\r\nReport, the information he was seeking, and hence the questions he asks\r\nyou to refer to me for solution. I herewith beg leave to send you a copy\r\nof the \"_Report on the diseases and physical peculiarities of the Negro\r\nrace_,\" which the Louisiana physicians appointed me to make to the State\r\nMedical Society. In that paper your correspondent will find most of the\r\nquestions he asks already answered.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the opportunity thus afforded me of supplying an\r\nomission in the Southern works above alluded to, of a paper, very\r\nimperfect and defective, it is true, yet embodying in a small space the\r\nresults of the experience and observation of a Southern practitioner,\r\nextending through a period of active service of a third of a century's\r\nduration, and which had the honor to meet with the approbation of the\r\nphysicians generally of the South. To the few questions not answered\r\ntherein I propose to reply, and at the same time to extend my remarks on\r\nthat branch of the subject more directly connected with the particular\r\nobject of your correspondent's investigations.\r\n\r\nTo the question, \"Is not Phthisis very common among the slaves of the\r\nslave States and unknown among the native Africans at home?\" I reply in\r\nthe negative, that Phthisis, so far from being common among the slaves\r\nof the slave States, is very seldom met with. As to the native Africans\r\nat home, little or nothing is known of their diseases. They have no\r\nscience or literature among them, and never had. The word Consumption,\r\nis applied to two very different diseases among negroes. The Cachexia\r\nAfricana, Dirt-eating of the English, and Mal d'Estomac of the French,\r\ncommonly called Negro Consumption, is a very different malady from\r\nPhthisis Pulmonalis, properly so called. The Cachexia Africana, like\r\nother spanoemic states of the system, may run into Phthisis, or become\r\ncomplicated with it. Dr. Hall asks, in what does the peculiarity of\r\nNegro Consumption consist? It consists in being an anoematosis and not a\r\ntuberculosis. Not having seen my Report, he may have inferred that it\r\nwas a tubercular disease--whereas it is an erythism of mind connected\r\nwith spanoemia. Negroes, however, are sometimes, though rarely,\r\nafflicted with tubercula pulmonum, or Phthisis, properly so called,\r\nwhich has some peculiarities. With them it is more palpably a secondary\r\ndisease than it appears to be among white people. European physicians\r\nare just beginning to see and acknowledge the truth taught by our Rush\r\nin the last century, that what is called Phthisis Pulmonalis is not a\r\nprimary, but a secondary disease; the tubercles of the lungs not being a\r\ncause, but an effect of the primary or original vice of blood origin, or\r\nas he called it, general debility. For half a century the attention of\r\nthe medical profession has been directed to the special and ultimate\r\nresults of Phthisis, instead of the primary condition of the system\r\ncausing the formation of tubercles. The new knowledge, derived from the\r\nstethoscope, by detecting those abnormal deposits of abortive nutrition,\r\ncalled tubercles, has been received for more than its worth, and has\r\ngreatly served to keep up the delusion of treating effects instead of\r\ncauses. The tubercular deposits, revealed by auscultation, are not only\r\nthe effects of abortive nutrition, but the latter is itself the effect\r\nof some derangement in the digestive and respiratory functions,\r\nvitiating the nutritive fluids, and producing what Rush called general\r\ndebility. The defect in the respiratory organs arises from the fact,\r\nlong overlooked, that in a great many persons, particularly the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, the lungs are inadequate to the task of depurating the\r\nsuperabundant blood, which is thrown upon them at the age of maturity,\r\nunless aided by an occasional blood-letting, active and abundant\r\nexercise of the muscles in the open air, and a nutritious diet, as\r\nadvised by the American Hippocrates, Benjamin Rush. White children\r\nsometimes have Phthisis, but here, as everywhere, it is a rare complaint\r\nbefore maturity (twenty-one in the male and eighteen in the female.) The\r\nlymphatic and nervous temperament predominating until then, secures them\r\nagainst this fell destroyer of the master race of men. Phthisis is, par\r\nexcellence, a disease of the sanguineous temperament, fair complexion,\r\nred or flaxen hair, blue eyes, large blood vessels, and a bony\r\nencasement too small to admit the full and free expansion of the lungs,\r\nenlarged by the superabundant blood, which is determined to those organs\r\nduring that first half-score of years immediately succeeding puberty.\r\nWell-formed chests offer no impediment to its inroads, if the volume of\r\nblood be out of proportion to the expansibility and capacity of the\r\npulmonary organs. Hence it is most apt to occur precisely at, and\r\nimmediately following, that period of life known as matureness, when the\r\nsanguineous system becomes fully developed and gains the mastery, so to\r\nspeak, over the lymphatic and nervous systems. With negroes, the\r\nsanguineous never gains the mastery over the lymphatic and nervous\r\nsystems. Their digestive powers, like children, are strong, and their\r\nsecretions and excretions copious, excepting the urine, which is rather\r\nscant. At the age of maturity they do not become dyspeptic and feeble\r\nwith softening and attenuation of the muscles, as among those white\r\npeople suffering the ills of a defective system of physical education,\r\nand a want of a wholesome, nutritious diet.\r\n\r\nYour correspondent asks, \"_Do the slaves consume much sugar, or take rum\r\nin intoxicating quantities?_\"\r\n\r\nThey do not consume much sugar, but are occasionally supplied with\r\nmolasses. Their diet consists principally of pickled pork and corn\r\nbread, rice, hominy, beans, peas, potatoes, yams, pumpkins and turnips.\r\nSoups, tea, coffee and slops, are seldom used by those in health, and\r\nthey object to all such articles of diet, as making them weak. They\r\nprefer the fattest pork to the lean. In the Atlantic States salted fish\r\nis substituted for or alternated with pork--the shad, mackerel and\r\nherring, principally the latter. In Cuba pickled beef is used, but they\r\nprefer pork. Their diet is of the most nutritious kind, and they will\r\nnot labor with much effect on any other than a strong, rich diet. With\r\nvery few exceptions, they do not take rum or other intoxicating drinks,\r\nexcept as a medicine, or in holiday times. Something equivalent to the\r\n\"_Maine Liquor Law_,\" (which you can explain to your correspondent,) has\r\nlong been in practical operation on all well regulated Southern\r\nplantations. The experience of two centuries testifies to the advantages\r\nof restraining the black population, _by arbitrary power_, from the free\r\nuse of intoxicating poisons. Man has no better natural right to poison\r\nhimself or his neighbor, than to maim, wound or kill himself or his\r\nneighbor. In regard to intoxicating drinks, the negroes of the South are\r\nunder wiser laws than any other people in the Union--those of Maine\r\nexcepted. But these wise unwritten laws do not so well protect those\r\nnegroes who reside in or near towns and villages, and are not under\r\nproper discipline. The Melanic race have a much stronger propensity to\r\nindulge in the intemperate use of ardent spirits than white people. They\r\nappear to have a natural fondness for alcoholic drinks and tobacco. They\r\nneed no schooling, as the fair skin races do, to acquire a fondness for\r\neither. Nearly all chew tobacco or smoke, and are not sickened and\r\ndisgusted with the taste of that weed as white men always are when they\r\nfirst begin to use it. As an instance of their natural love for ardent\r\nspirits, I was called to a number of negro children, who found a bottle\r\nof whisky under a bed, and drank it all without dilution, although it\r\nwas the first they had ever tasted. It contained arsenic, and had been\r\nplaced where they found it by the father of some of the children, with a\r\nview of poisoning a supposed enemy. But with that want of forethought,\r\nso characteristic of the negro race, he did not think of the greater\r\nprobability of his own children finding and drinking the poison than the\r\nenemy he intended it for.\r\n\r\nI am asked, \"_If I have determined by my own observation the facts in\r\nregard to the darker color of the secretions, the flesh, the membranes\r\nand the blood of the negro than the white man--or is the statement made\r\non the authority of others?_\"\r\n\r\nThe statement is made on the authority of some of the most distinguished\r\nanatomists and physiologists of the last century, confirmed by my own\r\nrepeated observations. The authorities to which I particularly refer are\r\nMalpighi, Stubner, Meckel, Pechlin, Albinus, Soemmering, Virey and Ebel.\r\nAlmost every year of my professional life, except a few years when\r\nabroad, I have made post mortem examinations of negroes, who have died\r\nof various diseases, and I have invariably found the darker color\r\npervading the flesh and the membranes to be very evident in all those\r\nwho died of acute diseases. Chronic ailments have a tendency to destroy\r\nthe coloring matter, and generally cause the mucous surfaces to be paler\r\nand whiter than in the white race.\r\n\r\nI now come to the main and important question--the last of the series,\r\nand the most important of all, viz: \"_How is it ascertained that negroes\r\nconsume less oxygen than white people?_\"\r\n\r\nI answer, by the spirometer. I have delayed my reply to make some\r\nfurther experiments on this branch of the subject. The result is, that\r\nthe expansibility of the lungs is considerably less in the black than\r\nthe white race of similar size, age and habit. A white boy expelled from\r\nhis lungs a larger volume of air than a negro half a head taller and\r\nthree inches larger around the chest. The deficiency in the negro may be\r\nsafely estimated at 20 per cent, according to a number of observations I\r\nhave made at different times. Thus, 174 being the mean bulk of air\r\nreceivable by the lungs of a white person of five feet in height, 140\r\ncubic inches are given out by a negro of the same stature. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that great variations occur in the bulk of air\r\nwhich can be expelled from the chest, depending much upon the age, size,\r\nhealth and habits of each individual. But, as a general rule, it may be\r\nsafely stated, that a white man, of the same age and size, who has been\r\nbred to labor, is, in comparison to the negro, extra capacious. To judge\r\nthe negro by spirometrical observations made on the white man, would\r\nindicate, in the former a morbid condition when none existed. But I am\r\nfree to confess that this is a subject open to further observations. My\r\nestimate may be under or over the exact difference of the capacity of\r\nthe two races for the consumption of oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe question is also answered _anatomically_, by the comparatively\r\nlarger size of the liver, and the smaller size of the lungs; and\r\n_physiologically_, by the _roule_ the liver performs in the negro's\r\neconomy being greater, and that of the lungs and kidneys less, than in\r\nthe white man. But I have not the honor to be the first to call\r\nattention to the difference in the pulmonary apparatus of the negro and\r\nthe white man, and to the fact of the deficiency in the renal secretion.\r\nThe honor is due to Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United\r\nStates. In his Notes on Virginia, Mr. Jefferson suggested that there was\r\na difference in the pulmonary apparatus of negroes, and that they do not\r\nextricate as much caloric from the air by respiration, and\r\nconsesequently consume less oxygen. He also called attention to the fact\r\nof the defective action of the kidneys. He remarks, \"To our reproach be\r\nit said, that although the negro race has been under our eye for a\r\ncentury and a half, it has not been considered as a subject of natural\r\nhistory.\" Another half century has passed away, and nothing has yet been\r\ndone to acquire a knowledge of the diseases and physical peculiarities\r\nof a people, constituting nearly a moiety of the population of fifteen\r\nStates of the American confederacy, and whose labor, in cultivating a\r\nsingle plant, which no other operatives but themselves can cultivate\r\nwithout sacrificing ease, comfort, health and life, affords a cheap\r\nmaterial, in sufficient abundance, to clothe the naked of the whole\r\nworld. Even the little scientific knowledge heretofore acquired\r\nconcerning them, has been so far forgotten, that when I enumerated a few\r\nof their anatomical and physical peculiarities, well known to the\r\nmedical men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, I was supposed\r\nby some of my cotemporaries in the South to be broaching novelties and\r\nadvancing speculations wild and crude. But I would not be understood as\r\nunderrating the editors of the _Charleston Medical Journal_ and some\r\nother Southern writers, for mistaking anatomical facts for wild\r\nspeculations, and condemning them as such in their editorial apologies\r\nfor not publishing the same. The fault lies not with them, but in that\r\nsystem of education which seems intended to keep physicians, divines,\r\nand all other classes of men in Egyptian darkness of every thing\r\npertaining to the philosophy of the negro constitution. It is only the\r\ncountry and village practitioners of the Southern States (among\r\nprofessional men,) who appear to know any thing at all about the\r\npeculiar nature of negroes--having derived their knowledge, not from\r\nbooks or schools, but in the field of experience. It is the latter class\r\nof medical men, by far the most numerous in the South, who have with\r\ngreat unanimity sustained my feeble efforts to make the negro's peculiar\r\nnature known, and the important fact that he consumes less oxygen than\r\nthe white man. Until his defective hæmatosis be made an element in\r\ncalculating the best means for improving the negro's condition, our\r\nNorthern people ought not to wonder at finding their colored population,\r\nborn to freedom by the side of the church and school-house door, in a\r\nlower species of degradation, after trying for half a century or more to\r\nelevate them, than an equal number of slaves any where to be found in\r\nthe South. \"Will not a lover of natural history,\" says Mr. Jefferson,\r\n\"one who views the gradations in all the races of animals with the eye\r\nof philosophy, excuse an effort to keep those of the department of man\r\nas distinct as nature formed them?\" But no effort has since been made to\r\ndraw the distinctions between the black and the white races by the knife\r\nof the anatomist, but much false logic has been introduced into our\r\nbooks and schools, to argue down the distinctions which nature has made.\r\nIt is to anatomy and physiology we should look, when vindicating the\r\nliberty of human nature, to see that its dignity and best interest be\r\npreserved. \"Among the Romans,\" says Mr. Jefferson, \"emancipation\r\nrequired but one effort, but with us a second is necessary, unknown to\r\nhistory.\" This second belongs properly to natural history; the\r\ndifference in the last not being artificial, as among the Romans, or the\r\npresent Britons, requiring only an act of legislation or a revolution to\r\nefface forever, but natural, which no human laws or governmental changes\r\ncan ever obliterate. The framers of our Constitution were aware of these\r\nfacts, and built the Constitution upon the basis of natural distinctions\r\nor physical differences in the two races composing the American\r\npopulation. A very important difference between the two will be found in\r\nthe fact of the greater amount of oxygen consumed by the one than the\r\nother. If the Constitution be worth defending, surely the great truths\r\nof natural history, on which it rests as a basis, are worth being made\r\nknown and regarded by our statesmen. That negroes consume less oxygen\r\nthan the white race, is proved by their motions being proverbially much\r\nslower, and their want of muscular and mental activity. But to\r\ncomprehend fully the weight of this proof of their defective hæmatosis,\r\nit is necessary to bear in mind one of the great leading truths\r\ndisclosed by comparative anatomy. Cuvier was the first to demonstrate\r\nbeyond a doubt that muscular energy and activity are in direct\r\nproportion to the development and activity of the pulmonary organs. In\r\nhis 29th lesson, vol. vii, p. 17, D'Anatomie Comparée, he says, \"_Dans\r\nles animaux vertebrés cette quantité de respiration fait connaître\r\npresque par un calcul mathématique la nature particulière de chaque\r\nclass_.\" In the preceding page he says,--\"That the relations observed in\r\nthe different animals, between the quantity of their respiration and the\r\nenergy of their motive force, is one of the finest demonstrations that\r\ncomparative anatomy can furnish to physiology, and at the same time one\r\nof the best applications of comparative anatomy to natural history.\" The\r\nslower motions of the owl prove to the natural historian that it\r\nconsumes less oxygen than the eagle. By the same physiological principle\r\nhe can tell that the herring is the most active among fish, and the\r\nflounder the slowest, by merely seeing the gills of each: those of the\r\nherring being very large, prove that it consumes much oxygen and is very\r\nactive; while the flounder, with its small gills, consumes but little,\r\nand is very slow in its motions as a necessary consequence. Hence the\r\nhabitual slower motions of the negro than the white man, is a positive\r\nproof that he consumes less oxygen. The slow gait of the negro is an\r\nimportant element to be taken into consideration in studying his nature.\r\nI have the authority of one of the very best observers of mankind, that\r\nthis element in the negro's economy is particularly worthy of being\r\nstudied. It is no less an authority than the father of his country, the\r\nfirst President of the United States, the illustrious Washington.\r\nWashington knew better, perhaps, than any other man what the white man\r\ncould do; his power of endurance and strength of wind under a given\r\nspeed of motion. Yet he found that all his observations on the white\r\nrace were inapplicable to negroes. To know what they could do, and to\r\nascertain their power of endurance and strength of wind, new\r\nobservations had to be made, and he made them accordingly. He made them\r\non his own negroes. He saw they did not move like the soldiers he had\r\nbeen accustomed to command. Their motions were much slower, and they\r\nperformed their tasks in a more dilatory manner; the amount of labor\r\nthey could perform in a given time, with ease and comfort to themselves,\r\ncould not be told by his knowledge of what white men could do. He\r\ntherefore noted the gait or movements natural to negroes, and made\r\nobservations himself of how much they could effect in a given time,\r\nunder the slow motions or gait natural to them. He did this to enable\r\nhim to judge of what would be a reasonable service to expect from them,\r\nand to know when they loitered and when they performed their duty. Those\r\npersons unacquainted with the important truth that negroes are naturally\r\nslower in their motions than white people, judging the former by the\r\nlatter, often attempt to drive them into the same brisk motions. But a\r\nday's experience ought to be enough to teach them that every attempt to\r\ndrive negroes to the performance of tasks equal to what the white\r\nlaborer would voluntarily impose upon himself, is an actual loss to the\r\nmaster; who, instead of getting more service out of them, actually gets\r\nless, and soon none, if such a course be persisted in; because they\r\nbecome disabled in body and indisposed in mind to perform any service at\r\nall. Every master or overseer, although he may know nothing of the law\r\nabove mentioned, discovered by Cuvier, may soon learn from experience\r\nthe important fact, that there is no other alternative than to let their\r\nnegroes assume, _by their own instincts_, the natural gait or movement\r\npeculiar to them, and then, like Washington, observe what can be\r\neffected in a given time by that given gait or movement, and to ask for\r\nnor expect more. In vol. ii, pages 511 to 512, (Washington's Writings,\r\npublished by Jared Sparks) are recorded a few of the observations made\r\nby the father of his country on his own slaves, as an illustration of\r\nthe preceding remarks. It is to be regretted that Mr. Sparks, out of\r\ndeference to a modern species of idolatry (all fanaticism is idolatry,)\r\nwhich has taken deep root in Great Britain and despotic Europe, and has\r\nfrom thence been transplanted into our republic, particularly in the\r\nNorthern portion of it, should have suppressed so much of the valuable\r\nobservations of Washington on the negro race, as only to publish a small\r\nfragment of the extensive knowledge his comprehensive mind had stored\r\nup on this important subject, well known to his neighbors. The fragment\r\ninforms us, that on a certain day he visited his plantations, and found\r\nthat certain negro slaves there mentioned, by the names of George, Tom\r\nand Mike, had only hewed a certain number of feet--whereupon Washington\r\nsat down and observed their motions, letting them proceed their own\r\nway,\" and ascertained how many feet each hewed in one hour and a\r\nquarter. He also made observations on his sawyers at the same time and\r\nin the same manner. From the data thus acquired he ascertained, in the\r\nshort space of an hour and a quarter, how many feet would be a day's\r\nwork for hewing, and how many for sawing, under their usual slow gait or\r\nmovement. This hewing and sawing were of poplar. \"What may be the\r\ndifference, therefore,\" says Washington, \"between the working of this\r\nwood and other, some future observations must make known.\" But Mr.\r\nSparks, out of deference to the new school of idolatry, having its head\r\nquarters in Exeter Hall, omitted, almost entirely, the publication of\r\nany more observations on the subject. It is no less idolatry to set up\r\nan anti-scriptural dogma and to make it a rule of action, than to\r\nworship a block or a graven image in the place of the true God. The true\r\nGod has said in the Pentateuch, the most authentic books of the Bible,\r\n\"_And of the heathen shall ye buy bond-men and bond-maids_ [slaves] _and\r\nyour children shall inherit them after you, and they shall be your\r\nbondmen_ [slaves] _forever._\" Leviticus, chap. xxv, verses 44, 45, 46.\r\nBut the Dogma or Negro god of Exeter Hall says that \"_negro slavery is\r\nsin_,\" and that it is contrary to the moral sense or conscience.\r\nMedicine was anciently called the divine art; to be entitled to hold\r\nthat appellation, ought it not to lend its aid to arrest in this happy\r\nrepublic the progress of idolatry, which is only another name for\r\nfanaticism? And will your learned correspondent help to arrest it in\r\nEngland? Or will he, like Prichard, Todd, and others, make science bow\r\nto the policy of his government?--To build up India at the expense of\r\nour Union? The subject of his investigations, tubercular disease, if\r\nproperly studied, leads directly to that species of knowledge, enabling\r\nhim to determine on physiological principles, which is the best system\r\nof ethics, that taught in the Bible, _to enslave the Canaanite_, or that\r\ntaught in Exeter Hall, _to set him free_? It will lead him to the\r\ndiscovery, that the negro, or Canaanitish race, consume less oxygen\r\nthan the white, and that as a necessary consequence of the deficient\r\naeration of the blood in the lungs, a hebetude of mind and body is the\r\ninevitable physiological effect; thus making it a mercy and a blessing\r\nto negroes to have persons in authority set over them, to provide for\r\nand take care of them. Under the dogma or new commandment to free the\r\nCanaanite, practically exercised in Van Dieman's Land and at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, the poor negro race have become nearly annihilated. Whereas\r\nunder that system of ethics taught in the Bible and made a rule of\r\naction in the Southern States, the descendants of Canaan are more\r\nrapidly increasing in numbers, and have more of the comforts and\r\npleasures of life, and more morality and Christianity among them than\r\nany others of the same race on any other portion of the globe. They are\r\ndaily bought and sold, and inherited as property, as the Scriptures said\r\nthey should be. Whereas in all those countries and places in which they\r\nare set free, in obedience to the dogma that \"slavery is sin,\" they\r\nrapidly degenerate into barbarism, as they are doing in the West Indies,\r\nor become extinct as in Van Dieman's Land. The physiological fact that\r\nnegroes consume less oxygen indicates the superior wisdom of the\r\nprecepts taught in the Bible regarding those people, to any promulgated\r\nfrom Exeter Hall. Experience also proves the former to be the best. You\r\nhear of the poor negroes, or colored people, as you call them, being\r\nbeaten with many stripes by their masters and overseers. But owing to\r\nthe fact that they consume less oxygen than white people, and the other\r\nphysical differences founded on difference of structure, they beat one\r\nanother, when free from the white man's authority, with ten stripes\r\nwhere they would get one from him. They are as much in slavery in Boston\r\nas in New Orleans. They suffer more from corporeal or other punishments\r\nin the cellars and dark lanes and alleys of Boston, New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, by the cruel tyranny practiced by the strong over the weak\r\nand helpless, than an equal number in Southern slavery. In slavery the\r\nstripes fall upon the evil disposed, vicious, buck negro fellows. But\r\nwhen removed from the white man's authority, the latter make them fall\r\non helpless women and children, the weak and the infirm. Good conduct,\r\nso far from being a protection, invites aggression.\r\n\r\nBut what connection have these observations, you may say, with the\r\nsubject of Dr. Hall's inquiries, and what light do they throw on\r\ntubercular disease? They show that there exists an intimate connection\r\nbetween the amount of oxygen consumed in the lungs and the phenomena of\r\nbody and mind. They point to a people whose respiratory apparatus is so\r\ndefective, that they have not sufficient industry and mental energy to\r\nprovide for themselves, or resolution sufficiently strong to prevent\r\nthem, when in freedom, from being subjected to the arbitrary, capricious\r\nwill of the drunken and vicious of their own color, who may happen to\r\nhave greater physical strength and more cunning; they show that Phthisis\r\nis a disease of the master race, and not of the slave race--that it is\r\nthe bane of that master race of men, known by an active hæmatosis; by\r\nthe brain receiving a larger quantity of aerated blood than it is\r\nentitled to; by the strong development of the circulating system; by the\r\nenergy of intellect; by the strength and activity of the muscular\r\nsystem; the vivid imagination; the irritable, mobile, ardent and\r\ninflammatory temperament, and the indomitable will and love of freedom.\r\nWhereas the negro constitution, being the opposite of all this, is not\r\nsubject to Phthisis, although it partakes of what is called the\r\nscrofulous diathesis. In the negro constitution, as the Frenchman would\r\nsay, \"_l'arbre arteriel cede sa prominance à l'arbre veineuse_,\"\r\nspreading coldness, languor and want of energy over the entire system.\r\nThe white fluids, or lymphatic temperament, predominating, they are not\r\nso liable as the fair race, to inflammatory diseases of the lungs, or\r\nany other organ; but from the superabundant viscidities and mucosities\r\nof their mucous surfaces, they are more liable to engorgements and\r\npulmonary congestions than any other race of men. In proof of which I\r\nbeg leave to refer your correspondent to a standard work entitled\r\n\"Observations sur les Maladies des Negres, par M. Dazille. Paris, 1776.\"\r\n\r\nPneumonia, without subjective symptoms, is very common among them.\r\nDiphtheretic affections, so common among white children, are very rare\r\namong negroes. Intercurrent Pneumonia is more common among them than any\r\nother class of people. It is met with in Typhoid fevers, Rheumatism and\r\nhepatic derangements, to which they are very liable in the cold season.\r\nThe local malady requires a different treatment, to correspond with the\r\ngeneral disorder. Bad, vicious, ungovernable negroes are subject, to\r\nwhat might properly be termed, Scorbutic Pneumonia--a blood disease,\r\nrequiring anti-scorbutics. Scorbutic negroes are always vicious or\r\nworthless. A course of anti-scorbutics will reform their morals, and\r\nmake good negroes out of worthless ones. They are liable to suffocative\r\northopnoea after measles, and die unless bled and purged. But purgatives\r\nare injurious in almost all their other affections involving the\r\nrespiratory organs, except such as act especially on the liver. They\r\ncheck expectoration, says Dazille, and lay the foundations of those\r\neffusions and depots of matter so often mistaken for genuine Phthisis.\r\nAuscultation cannot well be made available with them. The nose pleads to\r\nthe eye and touch to form the diagnosis, without calling into\r\nrequisition the ear. A single examination by auscultation, in persons\r\nabounding with so much phlegm, is not sufficient to arrive at a correct\r\ndiagnosis. Repeated examinations in various postures are too tedious in\r\nexecution, and too offensive to the auscultator, to come into general\r\nuse in diagnosing the diseases of the Melanic race. This valuable mode\r\nof exploration, so useful in many cases, as practiced by experts, has of\r\nlate years been carried to a ridiculous extreme, in being made to\r\ndeceive and delude more practitioners than it enlightens, from the haste\r\nand inexperience of those who practice it. With negroes it is\r\nunnecessary, except in some rare instances. Their diseases, like their\r\npassions, have each its peculiar expression stamped in the countenance.\r\nThey are like young children in this respect. They cannot disguise their\r\ncountenance like white people. An intelligent and observant observer can\r\ntell from their countenance when they are plotting mischief, or have\r\ncommitted some crime; when they are satisfied or dissatisfied; when in\r\npleasure or in pain; when troubled or disturbed in mind; or when telling\r\na falsehood instead of the truth. An observant physician has only to\r\nbring the old science of prosoposcopia, so much used by Hippocrates in\r\nforming his diagnosis, to bear upon negroes, to be able, by a little\r\nexperience, to ascertain the most of them at a glance by the expression\r\nof their countenance.\r\n\r\nThey are very subject to fevers, attended with an obstructed circulation\r\nof air and blood in the pulmonary organs. Their abundant mucosities\r\noften prevent the ingress of air into the air cells, bloating their lips\r\nand cheeks, which are coated with a tenacious saliva. A cessation of\r\ndigestion from too full a meal, or some hepatic or other derangement, is\r\nsoon attended with such a copious exudation of mucosities, filling the\r\nair cells and tracheal passages, as to cause apoplexy, which with them\r\nis only another name for asphyxia. The head has nothing to do with it.\r\nSo abundant are the mucosities in negroes, that those in the best health\r\nhave a whitish, pasty mucus, of considerable thickness on the tongue,\r\nleading a physician not acquainted with them to suppose that they were\r\ndyspeptic, or otherwise indisposed. The lungs of the white man are the\r\nmain outlets for the elimination of carbonic acid formed in the tissues.\r\nNegroes, however, by an instinctive habit of covering their mouth, nose,\r\nhead and face with a blanket, or some other covering, when they sleep,\r\nthrow upon the liver an additional duty to perform, in the excretion of\r\ncarbonic acid. Any cause, obstructing the action of the liver, quickly\r\nproduces with them a grave malady, the retention of carbonic acid in the\r\nblood soon poisoning them.\r\n\r\nHence with white people a moderate degree of hepatic obstruction, by a\r\nresidence in swampy districts, is often found beneficial in diminishing\r\nthe exalted sensibility and irritability of phthisical patients. Viscous\r\nengorgements of the lungs destroy more negroes than all other diseases\r\ncombined. They are distinguished from inflammatory affections by the\r\npyrexial symptoms not being strongly marked, or marked at all--by the\r\npuffy or bloated appearance of the face and lips--by the slavering\r\nmouth--the highly charged tongue--and by the torpor of mind and body. In\r\na word, all the symptoms point to a deficient aeration of the blood, or\r\na kind of half way asphyxia. A torpid state of the system, listlessness\r\nand inactivity almost approaching to asphyxia from the diminished\r\nquantity of oxygen consumed by the lungs of the negro, form a striking\r\ncontrast with the energetic, active, restless, persevering Anglo-Saxon,\r\nwith a tendency to phlogosis and phthisis pulmonalis, from the surplus\r\nquantity of oxygen consumed by his lungs. Blistering the nape of the\r\nneck, so irritating in nearly all of the diseases of the Saxon race, is\r\nalmost a sovereign remedy or specific for a large proportion of the\r\ncomplaints that negroes are subject to; because most of them arise from\r\ndefective respiratory action. Hence whipping the lungs to increased\r\naction by the application of blisters over the origin of the respiratory\r\nnerves, a remedy so inexpedient and so often contra-indicated in most of\r\nthe maladies of the white man, has a magic charm about it in the\r\ntreatment of those of the negro. The magic effect of a blister to that\r\npart of the Ethiopian's body, in a large class of his ailments, although\r\nwell known to most of the planters and overseers of the Southern\r\nStates, is scarcely known at all to the medical profession beyond those\r\nboundaries. Even here, where that portion of the profession who have had\r\nmuch experience in the treatment of their diseases, and are aware of the\r\nsimple fact itself, do not profit by it in many cases where it is\r\nindicated; because they do not perceive the indication clearly, so long\r\nas the rationale of the remedy remains unexplained.\r\n\r\nYour asking for the proofs of my assertion, \"that the negro consumes\r\nless oxygen than the white man,\" has led me into a new, extensive and\r\nunexplored field of science, where the rationale of that and many other\r\nimportant facts may be found springing up spontaneously. We have medical\r\nschools in abundance teaching the art of curing the ailments, and even\r\nthe most insignificant sores, incident to the half-starved, oppressed\r\npauper population of Europe--a population we have not got, never had and\r\nnever can have, so long as we have negro slaves to work in the cane,\r\ncotton and rice fields, where the white man, from the physiological laws\r\ngoverning his economy, _can not labor and live_: but where the negro\r\nthrives, luxuriates and enjoys existence more than any laboring\r\npeasantry to be found on the continent of Europe; yet we have no schools\r\nor any chair in our numerous institutions of medical learning to teach\r\nthe art of curing and preventing the diseases peculiar to our immense\r\npopulation of negro slaves, or to make them more efficient and valuable,\r\ndocile and manageable; comfortable, happy and contented by still further\r\nimproving their condition, which can only be done by studying their\r\nnature, and not by the North and South bandying epithets--not by the\r\nquackery which prescribes the same remedy, the liberty elixir, for all\r\nconstitutions. The two races, the Anglo-Saxon and the negro, have\r\nantipodal constitutions. The former abounds with red blood, even\r\npenetrating the capillaries and the veins, flushing the face and\r\nilluminating the countenance; the skin white; lips thin; nose high; hair\r\nauburn, flaxen, red or black; beard thick and heavy; eyes brilliant;\r\nwill strong and unconquerable; mind and muscles full of energy and\r\nactivity. The latter, with molasses blood sluggishly circulating and\r\nscarcely penetrating the capillaries; skin ebony, and the mucous\r\nmembranes and muscles partaking of the darker hue pervading the blood\r\nand the cutis; lips thick and protuberant; nose broad and flat; scalp\r\ncovered with a coarse, crispy wool in thick naps; beard wanting or\r\nconsisting of a few scattering woolly naps, in the \"_bucks_,\"\r\nprovincially so called; mind and body dull and slothful; will weak,\r\nwanting or subdued. The study of such opposite organizations, the one\r\nprone to Phthisis and the other not, can not fail to throw some light on\r\ntubercular disease, the subject of your correspondent, Dr. Hall's\r\npresent investigation. In contrasting the typical white man, having an\r\nexcess of red blood and a liability to inflammatory and tuberculous\r\ncomplaints and disorders of the digestive system, with the typical\r\nnegro, deficient aerated blood, and abounding in mucosites, having an\r\nactive liver and a strong digestion, and a proclivity strongly marked to\r\nfall into congestions, or cold humid engorgements approaching asphyxia,\r\nI hope he will be able to find in this unpolished communication\r\nsomething useful.\r\n\r\n          I have the honor to be, with great respect,\r\n                                       SAML. A. CARTWRIGHT, M.D.\r\n\r\n_New Orleans, July 19th, 1852._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY OF THE PROGNATHOUS SPECIES OF MANKIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not intended by the use of the term Prognathous to call in\r\nquestion the black man's humanity or the unity of the human races as a\r\n_genus_, but to prove that the species of the genus homo are not a\r\nunity, but a plurality, each essentially different from the others--one\r\nof them being so unlike the other two--the oval-headed Caucasian and the\r\npyramidal-headed Mongolian--as to be actually prognathous, like the\r\nbrute creation; not that the negro is a brute, or half man and half\r\nbrute, but a genuine human being, anatomically constructed, about the\r\nhead and face, more like the monkey tribes and the lower order of\r\nanimals than any other species of the genus man. Prognathous is a\r\ntechnical term derived from _pro_, before, and _gnathos_, the jaws,\r\nindicating that the muzzle or mouth is anterior to the brain. The lower\r\nanimals, according to Cuvier, are distinguished from the European and\r\nMongol man by the mouth and face projecting further forward in the\r\nprofile than the brain. He expresses the rule thus: _face anterior,\r\ncranium posterior_. The typical negroes of adult age, when tried by this\r\nrule, are proved to belong to a different species from the man of Europe\r\nor Asia, because the head and face are anatomically constructed more\r\nafter the fashion of the simiadiæ and the brute creation than the\r\nCaucasian and Mongolian species of mankind, their mouth and jaws\r\nprojecting beyond the forehead containing the anterior lobes of the\r\nbrain. Moreover, their faces are proportionally larger than their\r\ncrania, instead of smaller, as in the other two species of the genus\r\nman. Young monkeys and young negroes, however, are not prognathous like\r\ntheir parents, but become so as they grow older. The head of the infant\r\nourang outang is like that of a well formed Caucasian child in the\r\nprojection and hight of the forehead and the convexity of the vertea.\r\nThe brain appears to be larger than it really is, because the face, at\r\nbirth, has not attained its proportional size. The face of the Caucasian\r\ninfant is a little under its proportional size when compared with the\r\ncranium. In the infant negro and ourang outang it is greatly so.\r\nAlthough so much smaller in infancy than the cranium, the face of the\r\nyoung monkey ultimately outgrows the cranium; so, also, does the face of\r\nthe young negro, whereas in the Caucasian, the face always continues to\r\nbe smaller than the cranium. The superfices of the face at puberty\r\nexceeds that of the hairy scalp both in the negro and the monkey, while\r\nit is always less in the white man. Young monkeys and young negroes are\r\nsuperior to white children of the same age in memory and other\r\nintellectual faculties. The white infant comes into the world with its\r\nbrain inclosed by fifteen disunited bony plates--the occipital bone\r\nbeing divided into four parts, the sphenoid into three, the frontal into\r\ntwo, each of the two temporals into two, which, with the two parietals,\r\nmake fifteen plates in all--the vomer and ethmoid not being ossified at\r\nbirth. The bones of the head are not only disunited, but are more or\r\nless overlapped at birth, in consequence of the largeness of the\r\nCaucasian child's head and the smallness of its mother's pelvis, giving\r\nthe head an elongated form, and an irregular, knotty feel to the touch.\r\nThe negro infant, however, is born with a small, hard, smooth, round\r\nhead like a gourd. Instead of the frontal and temporal bones being\r\ndivided into six plates, as in the white child, they form but one bone\r\nin the negro infant. The head is not only smaller than that of the white\r\nchild, but the pelvis of the negress is wider than that of the white\r\nwoman--its greater obliquity also favors parturition and prevents\r\nmiscarriage.\r\n\r\nNegro children and white children are alike at birth in one remarkable\r\nparticular--they are both born _white_, and so much alike, as far as\r\ncolor is concerned, as scarcely to be distinguished from each other. In\r\na very short time, however, the skin of the negro infant begins to\r\ndarken and continues to grow darker until it becomes of a shining black\r\ncolor, provided the child be healthy. The skin will become black whether\r\nexposed to the air and light or not. The blackness is not of as deep a\r\nshade during the first years of life, as afterward. The black color is\r\nnot so deep in the female as in the male, nor in the feeble, sickly\r\nnegro as in the robust and healthy. Blackness is a characteristic of the\r\nprognathous species of the genus homo, but all the varieties of all the\r\nprognathous species are not equally black. Nor are the individuals of\r\nthe same family or variety equally so. The lighter shades of color,\r\nwhen not derived from admixture with Mongolian or Caucasian blood,\r\nindicate degeneration in the prognathous species. The Hottentots,\r\nBushmen and aborigines of Australia are inferior in mind and body to the\r\ntypical African of Guinea and the Niger.\r\n\r\nThe typical negroes themselves are more or less superior or inferior to\r\none another precisely as they approximate to or recede from the typical\r\nstandard in color and form, due allowance being made for age and sex.\r\nThe standard is an oily, shining black, and as far as the conformation\r\nof the head and face is concerned and the relative proportion of nervous\r\nmatter outside of the cranium to the quantity of cerebral matter within\r\nit, is found between the simiadiæ[257] and the Caucasian. Thus, in the\r\ntypical negro, a perpendicular line, let fall from the forehead, cuts\r\noff a large portion of the face, throwing the mouth, the thick lips, and\r\nthe projecting teeth anterior to the cranium, but not the entire face,\r\nas in the lower animals and monkey tribes. When all, or a greater part\r\nof the face is thrown anterior to the line, the negro approximates the\r\nmonkey anatomically more than he does the true Caucasian; and when\r\nlittle or none of the face is anterior to the line, he approximates that\r\nmythical being of Dr. Van Evrie, a _black white man_, and almost ceases\r\nto be a negro. The black man occasionally seen in Africa, called the\r\n_Bature Dutu_, with high nose, thin lips, and long straight hair, is not\r\na negro at all, but a Moor tanned by the climate--because his children,\r\nnot exposed to the sun, do not become black like himself. The typical\r\nnegro's nervous system is modeled a little different from the Caucasian\r\nand somewhat like the ourang outang. The medullary spinal cord is larger\r\nand more developed than in the white man, but less so than in the monkey\r\ntribes. The occipital foramen, giving exit to the spinal cord, is a\r\nthird longer, says Cuvier, in proportion to its breadth, than in the\r\nCaucasian, and is so oblique as to form an angle of 30° with the\r\nhorizon, yet not so oblique as in the simiadæ, but sufficiently so to\r\nthrow the head somewhat backward and the face upward in the erect\r\nposition. Hence, from the obliquity of the head and the pelvis, the\r\nnegro walks steadier with a weight on his head, as a pail of water for\r\ninstance, than without it; whereas, the white man, with a weight on his\r\nhead, has great difficulty in maintaining his centre of gravity, owing\r\nto the occipital foramen forming no angle with the cranium, the pelvis,\r\nthe spine, or the thighs--all forming a straight line from the crown of\r\nthe head to the sole of the foot without any of the obliquities seen in\r\nthe negro's knees, thighs, pelvis and head--and still more evident in\r\nthe ourang outang.\r\n\r\nThe nerves of organic life are larger in the prognathous species of\r\nmankind than in the Caucasian species, but not so well developed as in\r\nthe simiadiæ. The brain is about a tenth smaller in the prognathous man\r\nthan in the Frenchman, as proved by actual measurement of skulls by the\r\nFrench savans, Palisot and Virey. Hence, from the small brain and the\r\nlarger nerves, the digestion of the prognathous species is better than\r\nthat of the Caucasian, and its animal appetites stronger, approaching\r\nthe simiadiæ but stopping short of their beastiality. The nostrils of\r\nthe prognathous species of mankind open higher up than they do in the\r\nwhite or olive species, but not so high up as in the monkey tribes. In\r\nthe gibbon, for instance, they open between the orbits. Although the\r\ntypical negro's nostrils open high up, yet owing to the nasal bones\r\nbeing short and flat, there is no projection or prominence formed\r\nbetween his orbits by the bones of the nose, as in the Caucasian\r\nspecies. The nostrils, however, are much wider, about as wide from wing\r\nto wing, as the white man's mouth from corner to corner, and the\r\ninternal bones, called the turbinated, on which the olfactory nerves are\r\nspread, are larger and project nearer to the opening of the nostrils\r\nthan in the white man. Hence the negro approximates the lower animals in\r\nhis sense of smell, and can detect snakes by that sense alone. All the\r\nsenses are more acute, but less delicate and discriminating, than the\r\nwhite man's. He has a good ear for melody but not for harmony, a keen\r\ntaste and relish for food but less discriminating between the different\r\nkinds of esculent substances than the Caucasian. His lips are immensely\r\nthicker than any of the white race, his nose broader and flatter, his\r\nchin smaller and more retreating, his foot flatter, broader, larger, and\r\nthe heel longer, while he has scarcely any calves at all to his legs\r\nwhen compared to an equally healthy and muscular white man. He does not\r\nwalk flat on his feet but on the outer sides, in consequence of the sole\r\nof the foot having a direction inwards, from the legs and thighs being\r\narched outwards and the knees bent. The verb, from which his Hebrew name\r\nis derived, points out this flexed position of the knees, and also\r\nclearly expresses the servile type of his mind. Ham, the father of\r\nCanaan, when translated into plain English, reads that a black man was\r\nthe father of the slave or knee-bending species of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe blackness of the prognathous race, known in the world's history as\r\nCanaanites, Cushites, Ethiopians, black men or negroes, is not confined\r\nto the skin, but pervades, in a greater or less degree, the whole inward\r\nman down to the bones themselves, giving the flesh and the blood, the\r\nmembranes and every organ and part of the body, except the bones, a\r\ndarker hue than in the white race. Who knows but what Canaan's mother\r\nmay have been a genuine Cushite, as black inside as out, and that Cush,\r\nwhich means blackness, was the mark put upon Cain? Whatever may have\r\nbeen the mark set upon Cain, the negro, in all ages of the world, has\r\ncarried with him a mark equally efficient in preventing him from being\r\nslain--the mark of blackness. The wild Arabs and hostile American\r\nIndians invariably catch the black wanderer and make a slave of him\r\ninstead of killing him, as they do the white man.\r\n\r\nNich. Pechlin, in a work written last century entitled \"De cute\r\nAthiopum,\" Albinus, in another work, entitled \"De sede et causa coloris\r\nAthiop,\" as also the great German anatomists, Meiners, Ebel, and\r\nSoemmering, all bear witness to the fact that the muscles, blood,\r\nmembranes, and all the internal organs of the body, (the bones alone\r\nexcepted,) are of a darker hue in the negro than in the white man. They\r\nestimate the difference in color to be equal to that which exists\r\nbetween the hare and the rabbit. Who ever doubts the fact, or has none\r\nof those old and impartial authorities at hand--impartial because they\r\nwere written before England adopted the policy of pressing religion and\r\nscience in her service to place white American republican freemen and\r\nGuinea negroes upon the same platform--has only to look into the mouth\r\nof the first healthy typical negro he meets to be convinced of the\r\ntruth, that the entire membraneous lining of the inside of the cheeks,\r\nlips and gums is of a much darker color than in the white man.\r\n\r\nThe negro, however, must be healthy and in good condition--sickness,\r\nhard usage and chronic ailments, particularly that cachexia, improperly\r\ncalled consumption, speedily extracts the coloring matter out of the\r\nmucous membranes, leaving them paler and whiter than in the Caucasian.\r\nThe bleaching process of bad health or degeneration begins in the\r\nblood, membranes and muscles, and finally extracts so much of the\r\ncoloring pigment out of the skin, as to give it a dull ashy appearance,\r\nsometimes extracting the whole of it, converting the negro into the\r\nalbino. Albinoism or cucosis does not necessarily imply hybridism. It\r\noccurs among the pure Africans from any cause producing a degeneration\r\nof the species. Hybridism, however, is the most prolific source of that\r\ndegeneration. Sometimes the degeneration shows itself by white spots,\r\nlike the petals of flowers, covering different parts of the skin. The\r\nMexicans are subject to a similar degeneration, only that the spots and\r\nstripes are black instead of white. It is called the pinto with them.\r\nEven the pigment of the iris and the coloring matter of the albino's\r\nhair is absorbed, giving it a silvery white appearance, and converting\r\nhim into a clairvoyant at night. According to Professors Brown, Seidy\r\nand Gibbs, the negro's hair is not tubular, like the white man's, but it\r\nis eccentrically elliptical, with flattened edges, the coloring matter\r\nresiding in the epidermis, and not in tubes. In the place of a tube, the\r\nshaft of each hair is surrounded with a scaly covering like sheep's\r\nwool, and, like wool, is capable of being felted. True hair does not\r\npossess that property. The degeneration called albinoism has a\r\nremarkable influence upon the hair, destroying its coarse, nappy, wooly\r\nappearance, and converting it into fine, long, soft, silky, curly\r\nthreads. Often, the whole external skin, so remarkably void of hair in\r\nthe healthy negro, becomes covered with a very fine, silky down,\r\nscarcely perceptible to the naked eye, when transformed into the albino.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowen, the celebrated Baptist missionary, [see his work entitled\r\nCentral Africa and Missionary Labors from 1849 to 1856, by T. J. Bowen,\r\nCharleston, Southern Baptist Publication Society, 1857,] met with a\r\ngreat many cases of leucosis in Soudan or Negroland, back of Liberia,\r\nand erroneously concluded that these people had very little, if any\r\nnegro blood in them, and would be better subjects for missionary labors\r\nthan the blacks of the same country. They are, however, nothing but\r\n_white_ black men, a degeneration of the negro proper, and are even less\r\ncapable of perpetuating themselves than the hybrids or mulattoes. Mr.\r\nBowen is at a loss to account for the depopulation, which he verifies\r\nhas been going on in Soudan the last fifty years, threatening to leave\r\nthe country, at no distant time, bare of inhabitants, unless roads be\r\nconstructed by the Christians of the Southern States for commercial\r\nintercourse, and double exertions made to civilize and Christianize the\r\nwaning population of Central Africa before it entirely disappears. The\r\ngood missionary, though sent out from Georgia, was evidently taught in\r\nthat British school which assumes that there is only a single species in\r\nthe genus homo, in opposition to the Bible, that clearly designates\r\nthree. That school quotes the references in the sacred volume, implying\r\nunity in the genus--a unity which no one denies--to disprove the\r\nexistence of distinct species, and upon this fallacy builds the theory\r\nthat negro, Indian and white men are beings exactly alike, because they\r\nare human beings. _Ergo_, the liberty so beneficial to the white man,\r\nwould be equally so to the negro--disregarding as a fable those words of\r\nthe Bible expressly declaring that the latter _shall be servant of\r\nservants_ to the former--words which would not have been there if that\r\nkind of subordination called slavery was not the normal condition of the\r\nrace of Ham. To expect to civilize or Christianize the negro without the\r\nintervention of slavery is to expect an impossibility.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowen's experience and natural good sense occasionally got the\r\nbetter of his theoretical views. Thus, at page 90, we find him\r\nconfessing that \"the native African negroes ought to have masters in\r\nobedience to the demands of natural justice.\" At page 149 he lets us\r\ninto the secret of the depopulating process which has been going on in\r\nCentral Africa the last fifty years. While standing among some negroes\r\nin Ikata, a town in Central Africa, a capricious mulatto chief sent some\r\nofficers among the company, who singled out a poor fellow who had\r\noffended the chief by saying that as he let a white man into town, he\r\nmight let in a Dahomey man also, and presented him with an empty bag\r\nwith the message: \"_The king says you must send me your head._\" The Rev.\r\nmissionary, who was present at the beheading, made no comment further\r\nthan to state the fact. But he might have added that the blood of that\r\nnegro, and millions of others, will be required at the hands of Victoria\r\nRegina and the United States for having officiously destroyed the value\r\nof negro property in Africa by breaking up the only trade that ever\r\nprotected the native Africans against the butcheries, cruelties and\r\noppressions of their mulatto, Moorish and Mahommedan tyrants. It is\r\nthese butcheries and cruelties, and the little care taken of the black\r\nman in Africa, the last fifty years, since he became valueless through\r\nBritish and American philanthropy, that lie at the root of the\r\ndepopulating process which is going on in the dark land of the Niger.\r\nEmpty bags are now filled with heads instead of cowries. Mr. Bowen was\r\nsurprised to see so few black men in Soudan, where, half a century ago,\r\nhe says they were so numerous. But he rather regards it as a fortunate\r\ncircumstance, as he has no hope of Christianizing the typical negro,\r\nexcept through slavery to Christian masters--and that idea is abhorrent\r\nto the school in which he was taught; but he has more hope from the\r\nmixed races, and these, he confesses, can not be effectually\r\nChristianized until civilized. He deplores the bad example of the black\r\nrace, among them, their polygamy, etc., as greatly in the way of\r\ncivilizing the mulattoes. But he has overlooked the important fact, as\r\nmany do, that the existence of the hybrids themselves depends upon the\r\nexistence of the typical Africans. The extinction of the latter must, of\r\nnecessity, be soon followed by the extinction of the former, as they can\r\nnot, for any length of time, propagate among themselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowen inferred that the negroes of Central Africa, although\r\ndiminishing in numbers, are rising higher in the scale of humanity, from\r\nthe very small circumstance that they do not emit from their bodies so\r\nstrong and so offensive an odor as the negro slaves of Georgia and the\r\nCarolinas do, nor are their skins of so deep a black. This is a good\r\nillustration of the important truth, that all the danger of the slavery\r\nquestion lies in the ignorance of Scripture and the natural history of\r\nthe negro. A little acquaintance with the negro's natural history would\r\nprove to Mr. Bowen that the strong odor emitted by the negro, like the\r\ndeep pigment of the skin, is an indication of high health, happiness,\r\nand good treatment, while its deficiency is a sure sign of unhappiness,\r\ndisease, bad treatment, or degeneration. The skin of a happy, healthy\r\nnegro is not only blacker and more oily than an unhappy, unhealthy one,\r\nbut emits the strongest odor when the body is warmed by exercise and the\r\nsoul is filled with the most pleasurable emotions. In the dance called\r\n_patting juber_, the odor emitted from the men, intoxicated with\r\npleasure, is often so powerful as to throw the negro women into\r\nparoxysms of unconsciousness, vulgo hysterics. On another point of much\r\nimportance there is no practical difference between the Rev. missionary\r\nand that clear-headed, bold, and eccentric old Methodist, Dr. McFarlane.\r\nBoth believe that the Bible can do ignorant, sensual savages no good;\r\nboth believe that nothing but compulsatory power can restrain\r\nuncivilized barbarians from polygamy, inebriety, and other sinful\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nThe good missionary, however, believes in the possibility of civilizing\r\nthe inferior races by the money and means of the Christian nations\r\nlavishly bestowed, after which he thinks it will be no difficult matter\r\nto convert them to Christianity. Whereas the venerable Methodist\r\nbelieves in the impossibility of civilizing them, and therefore\r\nconcludes that the Written Word was not intended for those inferior\r\nraces who can not read it. When the philosophy of the prognathous\r\nspecies of mankind is better understood, it will be seen how they, the\r\nlowest of the human species, can be made partakers, equally with the\r\nhighest, in the blessings and benefits of the Written Word of God. The\r\nplantation laws against polygamy, intoxicating drinks, and other\r\nbesetting sins of the negro race in the savage state, are gradually and\r\nsilently converting the African barbarian into a moral, rational, and\r\ncivilized being, thereby rendering the heart a fit tabernacle for the\r\nreception of Gospel truths. The prejudices of many, perhaps the majority\r\nof the Southern people, against educating the negroes they hold in\r\nsubjection, arise from some vague and indefinite fears of its\r\nconsequences, suggested by the abolition and British theories built on\r\nthe false assumption that the negro is a white man with a black skin. If\r\nsuch an assumption had the smallest degree of truth in it, the more\r\nprofound the ignorance and the deeper sunk in barbarism the slaves were\r\nkept, the better it would be for them and their masters. But experience\r\nproves that masters and overseers have nothing at all to fear from\r\ncivilized and intelligent negroes, and no trouble whatever in managing\r\nthem--that all the trouble, insubordination and danger arise from the\r\nuncivilized, immoral, rude, and grossly ignorant portion of the servile\r\nrace. It is not the ignorant semi-barbarian that the master or overseer\r\nintrusts with his keys, his money, his horse or his gun, but the most\r\nintelligent of the plantation--one whose intellect and morals have\r\nundergone the best training. An educated negro, one whose intellect and\r\nmorals have been cultivated, is worth double the price of the wild,\r\nuncultivated, black barbarian of Cuba and will do twice as much work,\r\ndo it better and with less trouble.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against educating the negroes may also be traced to the\r\nneglect of American divines in making themselves acquainted with Hebrew\r\nliterature. What little the most of them know of the meaning of the\r\nuntranslated terms occurring in the Bible, and the signification of the\r\nverbs from which they are derived, is mostly gathered from British\r\ncommentators and glossary-makers, who have blinked the facts that\r\ndisprove the Exeter Hall dogma, that negro slavery is sin against God.\r\nHence, even in the South, the important Biblical truth, that the white\r\nman derives his authority to govern the negro from the Great Jehovah, is\r\nseldom proclaimed from the pulpit. If it were proclaimed, the master\r\nrace would see deeper into their responsibilities, and look closer into\r\nthe duties they owe to the people whom God has given them as an\r\ninheritance, and their children after them, so long as time shall last.\r\nThat man has no faith in the Scriptures who believes that education\r\ncould defeat God's purposes, in subjecting the black man to the\r\ngovernment of the white. On the contrary, experience proves its\r\nadvantages, to both parties. Aside and apart from Scripture authority,\r\nnatural history reveals most of the same facts, in regard to the negro\r\nthat the Bible does. It proves the existence of at least three distinct\r\nspecies of the genus man, differing in their instincts, form, habits and\r\ncolor. The white species having qualities denied to the black--one with\r\na free and the other with a servile mind--one a thinking and reflective\r\nbeing, the other a creature of feeling and imitation, almost void of\r\nreflective faculties, and consequently unable to provide for and take\r\ncare of himself. The relation of master and slave would naturally spring\r\nup between two such different species of men, even if there was no\r\nScripture authority to support it. The relation thus established, being\r\nnatural, would be drawn closer together, instead of severed, by the\r\ninferior imitating the superior in all his ways, or in other words,\r\nacquiring an education.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[257] Monkey tribes.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CAUCASIANS AND THE AFRICANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n          SEVERAL years ago we published some original and\r\n          ingenious views of Dr. Cartwright, of New Orleans,\r\n          upon the subject of negroes and their\r\n          characteristics. The matter is more elaborately\r\n          treated by him in the following paper:--_De Bows\r\n          Review._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Nilotic monuments furnish numerous portraits of the negro races,\r\nrepresented as slaves, sixteen hundred years before the Christian era.\r\nAlthough repeatedly drawn from their native barbarism and carried among\r\ncivilized nations, they soon forget what they learn and relapse into\r\nbarbarism. If the inherent potency of the prognathous type of mankind\r\nhad been greater than it actually is, sufficiently great to give it the\r\nindependence of character that the American Indian possesses, the world\r\nwould have been in a great measure deprived of cotton and sugar. The red\r\nman is unavailable as a laborer in the cane or cotton field, or any\r\nwhere else, owing to the unalterable ethnical laws of his character. The\r\nwhite man can not endure toil under the burning sun of the cane and\r\ncotton field, and live to enjoy the fruits of his labor. The African\r\nwill starve rather than engage in a regular system of agricultural\r\nlabor, unless impelled by the stronger will of the white man. When thus\r\nimpelled, experience proves that he is much happier, during the hours of\r\nlabor in the sunny fields, than when dozing in his native woods and\r\njungles. He is also eminently qualified for a number of employments,\r\nwhich the instincts of the white man regard as degrading. If the white\r\nman be forced by necessity into employments abhorrent to his instincts,\r\nit tends to weaken or destroy that sentiment or principle of honor or\r\nduty, which is the mainspring of heroic actions, from the beginning of\r\nhistorical times to the present, and is the basis of every thing great\r\nand noble in all grades of white society.\r\n\r\nThe importance of having these particular employments, regarded as\r\nservile and degrading by the white man, attended to by the black race,\r\nwhose instincts are not repugnant to them, will be at once apparent to\r\nall those who deem the sentiment of honor or duty as worth cultivating\r\nin the human breast. It is utterly unknown to the prognathous race of\r\nmankind, and has no place in their language. When the language is given\r\nto them they can not comprehend its meaning, or form a conception of\r\nwhat is meant by it. Every white man, who has not been degraded, had\r\nrather be engaged in the most laborious employments, than to serve as a\r\nlacquey or body servant to another white man or being like himself.\r\nWhereas, there is no office which the negro or mulatto covets more than\r\nthat of being a body servant to a real gentleman. There is no office\r\nwhich gives him such a high opinion of himself, and it is utterly\r\nimpossible for him to attach the idea of degradation to it. Those\r\nidentical offices which the white man instinctively abhors, are the most\r\ngreedily sought for by negroes and mulattoes, whether slave or free, in\r\npreference to all other employments. North or South, free or slave, they\r\nare ever at the elbow, behind the table, in hotels and steamboats; ever\r\nready, with brush in hand, to brush the coat or black the shoes, or to\r\nperform any menial service which may be required, and to hold out the\r\nopen palm for the dime. The innate love to act as body servant or\r\nlacquey is too strongly developed in the negro race to be concealed. It\r\nadmirably qualifies them for waiters and house servants, as their strong\r\nmuscles, hardy frames, and the positive pleasure that labor in a hot sun\r\nconfers on them, abundantly qualify them for agricultural employment in\r\na hot climate.\r\n\r\nHence, the primordial cell germ of the Nigritians has no more potency\r\nthan what is sufficient to form a being with physical power, when its\r\ndynamism becomes exhausted, dropping the creature in the wilderness with\r\nthe mental organization too imperfect to enable him to extricate himself\r\nfrom barbarism. If Nature had intended the prognathous race for\r\nbarbarism as the end and object of their creation, they would have been\r\nlike lions and tigers, fierce and untamable. So far from being like\r\nferocious beasts, they are endowed with a will so weak, passions so\r\neasily subdued, and dispositions so gentle and affectionate, as readily\r\nto fall under subjection to the wild Arab, or any other race of men.\r\nHence they are led about in gangs of an hundred or more by a single\r\nindividual, even by an old man, or a cripple, if he be of the white race\r\nand possessed of a strong will. The Nigritian has such little command\r\nover his own muscles, from the weakness of his will, as almost to\r\nstarve, when a little exertion and forethought would procure him an\r\nabundance. Although he has exaggerated appetites and exaggerated\r\nsenses, calling loudly for their gratification, his will is too weak to\r\ncommand his muscles to engage in such kinds of labor as would readily\r\nprocure the fruits to gratify them. Like an animal in a state of\r\nhibernation, waiting for the external aid of spring to warm it into life\r\nand power, so does the negro continue to doze out a vegeto-animal\r\nexistence in the wilderness, unable to extricate himself therefrom--his\r\nown will being too feeble to call forth the requisite muscular exertion.\r\nHis muscles not being exercised, the respiration is imperfect, and the\r\nblood is imperfectly vitalized. Torpidity of body and hebetude of mind\r\nare the effects thereof, which disappear under bodily labor, because\r\nthat expands the lungs, vitalizes the blood, and wakes him up to a sense\r\nof pleasure and happiness unknown to him in the vegeto-animal or\r\nhibernating state. Nothing but will is wanting to transform the torpid,\r\nunhappy tenant of the wilderness into a rational and happy thing--the\r\nhappiest being on earth, as far as sensual pleasures are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe white man has an exaggerated will, more than he has use for; because\r\nit frequently drives his own muscles beyond their physical capacity of\r\nendurance. The will is not a faculty confined within the periphery of\r\nthe body. It can not, like the imagination, travel to immeasurable\r\ndistances from the body, and in an instant of time go and return from\r\nAldabran, or beyond the boundaries of the solar system. Its flight is\r\nconfined to the world and to limits more or less restricted--the less\r\nrestricted in some than in others. The will has two powers--direct and\r\nindirect. It is the direct motive power of the muscular system. It\r\nindirectly exerts a dynamic force upon surrounding objects when\r\nassociated with knowledge. It gives to knowledge its power. Every thing\r\nthat is made was made by the Infinite Will associated with infinite\r\nknowledge. The will of man is but a spark of the Infinite Will, and its\r\npower is only circumscribed by his knowledge. A man possessing a\r\nknowledge of the negro character can govern an hundred, a thousand, or\r\nten thousand of the prognathous race by his will alone, easier than one\r\nignorant of that character can govern a single individual of that race\r\nby the whip or a club. However disinclined to labor the negroes may be,\r\nthey can not help themselves; they are obliged to move and to exercise\r\ntheir muscles when the white man, acquainted with their character,\r\n_wills_ that they should do so. They can not resist that will, so far as\r\nlabor of body is concerned. If they resist, it is from some other cause\r\nthan that connected with their daily labor. They have an instinctive\r\nfeeling of obedience to the stronger will of the white man, requiring\r\nnothing more than moderate labor. So far, their instincts compel\r\nobedience to will as one of his rights. Beyond that, they will resist\r\nhis will and be refractory, if he encroaches on what they regard as\r\ntheir rights, viz: the right to hold property in him as he does in them,\r\nand to disburse that property to them in the shape of meat, bread and\r\nvegetables, clothing, fuel and house-room, and attention to their\r\ncomforts when sick, old, infirm, and unable to labor; to hold property\r\nin him as a conservator of the peace among themselves, and a protector\r\nagainst trespassers from abroad, whether black or white; to hold\r\nproperty in him as impartial judge and an honest jury to try them for\r\noffenses, and a merciful executioner to punish them for violations of\r\nthe usages of the plantation or locality.\r\n\r\nWith those rights acceded to them, no other compulsion is necessary to\r\nmake them perform their daily tasks than _his will be done_. It is not\r\nthe whip, as many suppose, which calls forth those muscular exertions,\r\nthe result of which is sugar, cotton, breadstuffs, rice, and tobacco.\r\nThese are products of the white man's will, acting through the muscles\r\nof the prognathous race in our Southern States. If that will were\r\nwithdrawn, and the plantations handed over as a gracious gift to the\r\nlaborers, agricultural labor would cease for the want of that spiritual\r\npower called the will, to move those machines--the muscles. They would\r\ncease to move here, as they have in Hayti. If the prognathous race were\r\nexpelled the land, and their place supplied with double their number of\r\nwhite men, agricultural labor in the South would also cease, as far as\r\nsugar and cotton are concerned, for the want of muscles that could\r\nendure exercise in the smothering heat of a cane or cotton field. Half\r\nthe white laborers of Illinois are prostrated with fevers from a few\r\ndays' work in stripping blades in a Northern corn field, owing to the\r\nconfinement of the air by the close proximity of the plants. Cane and\r\ncotton plants form a denser foliage than corn--a thick jungle, where the\r\nwhite man pants for breath, and is overpowered by the heat of the sun at\r\none time of day, and chilled by the dews and moisture of the plants at\r\nanother. Negroes glory in a close, hot atmosphere; they instinctively\r\ncover their head and faces with a blanket at night, and prefer laying\r\nwith their heads to the fire, instead of their feet. This ethnical\r\npeculiarity is in harmony with their efficiency as laborers in hot,\r\ndamp, close, suffocating atmosphere--where instead of suffering and\r\ndying, as the white man would, they are healthier, happier, and more\r\nprolific than in their native Africa--producing, under the white man's\r\nwill, a great variety of agricultural products, besides upward of three\r\nmillions of bales of cotton, and three hundred thousand hogsheads of\r\nsugar. Thus proving that subjection to his will is normal to them,\r\nbecause, under the influence of his will, they enjoy life more than in\r\nany other condition, rapidly increase in numbers, and steadily rise in\r\nthe scale of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe power of a stronger will over a weaker, or the power of one living\r\ncreature to act on and influence another, is an ordinance of nature,\r\nwhich has its parallel in the inorganic kingdom, where ponderous bodies,\r\nwidely separated in space, influence one another so much as to keep up a\r\nconstant interplay of action and reaction throughout nature's vast\r\nrealms. The same ordinance which keeps the spheres in their orbits and\r\nholds the satellites in subordination to the planets, is the ordinance\r\nthat subjects the negro race to the empire of the white man's will. From\r\nthat ordinance the snake derives its power to charm the bird, and the\r\nmagician his power to amuse the curious, to astonish the vulgar, and to\r\nconfound the wisdom of the wise. Under that ordinance, our four millions\r\nof negroes are as unalterably bound to obey the white man's will, as the\r\nfour satellites of Jupiter the superior magnetism of that planet. If\r\nindividual masters, by releasing individual negroes from the power of\r\ntheir will, can not make them free or release them from subordination to\r\nthe instinctive public sentiment or will of the aggregate white\r\npopulation, which as rigidly excludes them, in the so-called free\r\nStates, from the drawing room and parlor as it does pots and kettles and\r\nother kinds of kitchen furniture. The subjugation of equals by artifice\r\nor force is tyrrany or slavery; but there is no such thing in the United\r\nStates, because equals are on a perfect equality here. The subordination\r\nof the Nigritian to the Caucasian would never have been imagined to be a\r\ncondition similar to European slavery, if any regard had been paid to\r\nethnology. Subordination of the inferior race to the superior is a\r\nnormal, and not a forced condition. Chains and standing armies are the\r\nimplements used to force the obedience of equals to equals--of one white\r\nman to another. Whereas, the obedience of the Nigritian to the Caucasian\r\nis _spontaneous_ because it is normal for the weaker will to yield\r\nobedience to the stronger. The ordinance which subjects the negro to the\r\nempire of the white man's will, was plainly written on the heavens\r\nduring our Revolutionary war. It was then that the power of the united\r\nwill of the American people rose to its highest degree of intensity.\r\n\r\nEvery colony was a slaveholding colony excepting one; yet the people,\r\nparticularly that portion of them residing in districts where the black\r\npopulation was greatest, hastened to meet in the battle-field the\r\npowerful British armies in front of them, and the interminable hosts of\r\nIndian warriors in the wilderness behind them, leaving their wives and\r\nchildren, their old men and cripples, for seven long years, _to their\r\nnegroes to take care of_. Did the slaves, many of whom were savages\r\nrecently imported from Africa, butcher them, as white or Indian slaves\r\nsurely would have done, and fly to the enemy's standard for the liberty,\r\nland, money, rum, savage luxuries and ample protection so abundantly\r\npromised and secured to all who would desert their master's families?\r\nHistory answers that not one in a thousand joined their masters'\r\nenemies; but, on the contrary, they continued quietly their daily\r\nlabors, even in those districts where they outnumbered the white\r\npopulation ten to one. They not only produced sufficient breadstuffs to\r\nsupply the families of their masters, but a surplus of flour, pork, and\r\nbeef was sent up from the slaveholding districts of Virginia to\r\nWashington's starving army in Pennsylvania. [See Botta's History.] These\r\nagricultural products were created by savages, naturally so indolent in\r\ntheir native Africa, as to prefer to live on ant eggs and caterpillars\r\nrather than labor for a subsistence; but for years in succession they\r\ncontinued to labor in the midst of their masters' enemies--dropping\r\ntheir hoes when they saw the red coats, running to tell their mistress,\r\nand to conduct her and the children through by-paths to avoid the\r\nBritish troopers, and when the enemy were out of sight returning to\r\ntheir work again. The sole cause of their industry and fidelity is due\r\nto the spiritual influence of the white race over the black.\r\n\r\nThe empire of the white man's will over the prognathous race is not\r\nabsolute, however. It can not force exercise beyond a certain speed;\r\nneither the will nor physical force can drive negroes, for a number of\r\ndays in succession, beyond a very moderate daily labor--about one-third\r\nless than the white man voluntarily imposes on himself. If force be used\r\nto make them do more, they invariably do less and less, until they fall\r\ninto a state of impassivity, in which they are more plague than\r\nprofit--worthless as laborers, insensible and indifferent to punishment,\r\nor even to life; or, in other words, they fall into the disease which I\r\nhave named Dysesthæsia Ethiopica, characterized by hebetude of mind and\r\ninsensibility of body, caused by over working and bad treatment. Some\r\nknowledge of the ethnology of the prognathous race is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the prevention and cure of this malady in all its various\r\nforms and stages. Dirt eating, or Cachexia Africana, is another disease,\r\nlike Dysesthæsia Ethiopica, growing out of ethnical elements peculiar to\r\nthe prognathous race. The ethnical elements assimilating the negro to\r\nthe mule, although giving rise to the last named disease, are of vast\r\nimportance to the prognathous race, because they guarantee to that race\r\nan ample protection against the abuses of arbitrary power. A white man,\r\nlike a blooded horse, can be worked to death. Not so the negro, whose\r\nethnical elements, like the mule, restricts the limits of arbitrary\r\npower over him.\r\n\r\nAmong the four millions of the prognathous race in the United States, it\r\nwill be difficult, if not impossible, to find a single individual negro,\r\nwhom the white man, armed with arbitrary power, has ever been able to\r\nmake hurt himself at work. It is beyond the power of the white man to\r\ndrive the negro into this long continued and excessive muscular\r\nexertions such as the white laborers of Europe often impose upon\r\nthemselves to satisfy a greedy boss, under fear of losing their places,\r\nand thereby starving themselves and families. Throughout England,\r\nnothing is more common than decrepitude, premature old age, and a\r\nfrightful list of diseases, caused by long continued and excessive\r\nmuscular exertion. Whereas, all America can scarcely furnish an example\r\nof the kind among the prognathous race. The white men of America have\r\nperformed many prodigies, but they have never yet been able to make a\r\nnegro overwork himself.\r\n\r\nThere are other elements peculiar to the Nigritian, on which the\r\ndisease, called negro consumption, or Cachexia Africana, depends. But\r\nthese belong to that class which subject the negro to the white man's\r\nspiritual empire over him. When that spiritual empire is not maintained\r\nin all its entirety, or in other words, when the negro is badly\r\ngoverned, he is apt to fall under the spiritual influence of the artful\r\nand designing of his own color, and Cachexia Africana, or consumption,\r\nis the consequence. Better throw medicine to the dogs, than give it to a\r\nnegro patient impressed with the belief that he has walked over poison\r\nspecially laid for him, or been in some other way tricked or conjured.\r\nHe will surely die, unless treated in accordance with his ethnological\r\npeculiarities, and the hallucination expelled.\r\n\r\nThere never has been an insurrection of the prognathous race against\r\ntheir masters; and from the nature of the ethnical elements of that\r\nrace, there never can be. Hayti is no exception, it will be seen, when\r\nthe true history of the so-called insurrection of that island is\r\nwritten. There have been neighborhood disturbances and bloodshed, caused\r\nby fanaticism, and by mischievous white men getting among them and\r\ninfusing their will into them, or mesmerizing them. But, fortunately,\r\nthere is an ethnological law of their nature which estops the evil\r\ninfluence of such characters by limiting their influence strictly to\r\npersonal acquaintances. The prognathous tribes in every place and\r\ncountry are jealous and suspicious of all strangers, black or white, and\r\nhave ever been so.\r\n\r\nPrior to the emancipation act in the British West Indies, the famous\r\nExeter Hall Junto sent out a number of emissaries of the East India\r\nCompany to Jamaica, in the garb of missionaries. After remaining a year\r\nor two in the assumed character of Christian ministers, they began to\r\npreach insurrectionary doctrines, and caused a number of so-called\r\ninsurrections to break out simultaneously in different parts of the\r\nisland. The insurgents in every neighborhood were confined to the\r\npersonal acquaintances of the Exeter Hall miscreants, who succeeded in\r\ninfusing their will only into those who had listened to their incendiary\r\nharangues. This was proved upon them by the genuine missionaries, who\r\nhad long been on the island, and had gathered into their various\r\nchurches a vast number of converts. For, in no instance, did a single\r\nconvert, or any other negro, join in the numerous insurrectionary\r\nmovements who had not been personally addressed by the wolves in sheep's\r\nclothing. The Christian missionaries, particularly the Methodists,\r\nBaptist, Moravians, and Catholics, were very exact in collecting the\r\nevidence of this most important ethnological truth, in consequence of\r\nsome of the planters, at the first outbreak, having confounded them with\r\nthe Exeter Hall incendiaries.\r\n\r\nThe planters finally left the Christian missionaries and their flocks\r\nundisturbed, but proceeded to expel the false missionaries, to hang\r\ntheir converts, and to burn down their chapels. The event proved that\r\nthey were wrong in not hanging the white incendiaries; because they went\r\nhome to England, preached a crusade--traveling all over the United\r\nKingdom--proclaiming, as they went, that they had left God's houses in\r\nflames throughout Jamaica, and God's people hanging like dogs from the\r\ntrees in that sinful island. This so inflamed public sentiment in Great\r\nBritain against the planters, as to unite all parties in loud calls for\r\nthe immediate passage of the emancipation act. There is good reason to\r\nbelieve that the English ministry, in view of the probable effect of\r\nthat measure on the United States, and the encouragement it would afford\r\nto the culture of sugar and other tropical products in the East Indies\r\nand Mauritius, had previously determined to make negro freedom a leading\r\nmeasure in British policy, well knowing that its effect would be to\r\nAfricanize the sugar and cotton growing regions of America. The\r\nethnology of the prognathous race does not stop at proving that\r\nsubordination to the white race is its normal condition. It goes\r\nfurther, and proves that social and political equality is abnormal to\r\nit, whether educated or not. Neither negroes nor mulattoes know how to\r\nuse power when given to them. They always use it capriciously and\r\ntyrannically. Tschudi, a Swiss naturalist, [see Tschudi's Travels in\r\nPeru, London, 1848,] says, \"that in Lima and Peru generally, the free\r\nnegroes are a plague to society. Dishonesty seems to be a part of their\r\nvery nature. Free born negroes, admitted into the houses of wealthy\r\nfamilies, and have received, in early life, a good education, and\r\ntreated with kindness and liberality, do not differ from their\r\nuneducated brother.\"\r\n\r\nTschudi is mistaken in supposing that dishonesty is too deeply rooted in\r\nthe negro character to be removed. They are dishonest when in the\r\nabnormal condition without a master. They are also dishonest when in a\r\nstate of subordination, called slavery, badly provided for and not\r\nproperly disciplined and governed. But when properly disciplined,\r\ninstructed, and governed, and their animal wants provided for, it would\r\nbe difficult to find a more honest, faithful, and trustworthy people\r\nthan they are. When made contented and happy, as they always should be,\r\nthey reflect their master in their thoughts, morals, and religion, or at\r\nleast they are desirous of being like him. They imitate him in every\r\nthing, as far as their imitative faculties, which are very strong, will\r\ncarry them. They take a pride in his wealth, or in any thing which\r\ndistinguishes him, as if they formed a part of himself, as they really\r\ndo, being under the influence of his will, and in some measure\r\nassimilated, in their spiritual nature, to him--loving him with all the\r\nwarm and devoted affection which children manifest to their parents. He\r\nis sure of their love and friendship, although all the world may forsake\r\nhim. But to create and maintain this happy relation, he must govern them\r\nwith strict reference to their ethnological peculiarities. He must treat\r\nthem as inferiors, not as equals, as they are not satisfied with\r\nequality, and will despise a master who attempts to raise any one or\r\nmore of them to an equality with himself; because they become jealous\r\nand suspicious that their master's favorites will exercise a sinister\r\ninfluence over him against them.\r\n\r\nImpartiality of treatment in every particular, down to a hat or pair of\r\nshoes, is what they all regard as one of their dearest rights. Hence,\r\nany special favors or gifts to one, is an offense to all the rest. They\r\nalso regard as a right, when punished, not to be punished in anger, but\r\nwith cool deliberation. They will run from an angry or enraged master or\r\noverseer, armed with a gun or a pistol. They regard all overseers who\r\ncome into the field armed with deadly weapons as cowards, and all\r\ncowards have great difficulty in governing them. It is not physical\r\nforce which keeps them in subjection, but the spiritual force of the\r\nwhite man's will. One unarmed brave man can manage a thousand by the\r\nmoral force of his will alone, much better than an hundred cowards with\r\nguns in their hands. They also require as a right when punished, to be\r\npunished with a switch or a whip, and not with a stick or the fist. In\r\nthis particular the ethnical law of their nature is different from all\r\nother races of men. It is exactly the reverse of that of the American\r\nIndian. The Indian will murder any man who strikes him with a switch, a\r\ncowhide, or a whip, twenty years afterward, if he gets an opportunity;\r\nbut readily forgets blows, however severe, inflicted on him with the\r\nfist, a cudgel, or a tomahawk. A remarkable ethnological peculiarity of\r\nthe prognathous race is, that any deserved punishment, inflicted on them\r\nwith a switch, cowhide, or whip, puts them into good humor with\r\nthemselves and the executioner of the punishment, provided he manifest\r\nsatisfaction by regarding the offense as atoned for.\r\n\r\nThe negro requires government in every thing, the most minute. The\r\nIndian, on the contrary, submits to government in nothing whatever. Mr.\r\nJefferson was the first to notice this ethnical law of the red man. [See\r\nhis letter to Gilmer, June 7, 1816, vol. iv, page 279, Jefferson's\r\nCorrespondence.] \"Every man with them,\" (the Indians,) says Mr.\r\nJefferson, \"is perfectly free to follow his own inclinations; but if, in\r\ndoing this, he violates the rights of another, he is punished by the\r\ndisesteem of society or tomahawked. Their leaders conduct them by the\r\ninfluence of their characters only; and they follow or not, as they\r\nplease, him of whose character, for wisdom or war, they have the highest\r\nopinion, but, of all things, they least think of subjecting themselves\r\nto the will of one man.\" Whereas the black man requires government even\r\nin his meat and drink, his clothing, and hours of repose. Unless under\r\nthe government of one man to prescribe rules of conduct to guide him, he\r\nwill eat too much meat and not enough of bread and vegetables; he will\r\nnot dress to suit the season, or kind of labor he is engaged in, nor\r\nretire to rest in due time to get sufficient sleep, but sit up and doze\r\nby the fire nearly all night. Nor will the women undress the children\r\nand put them regularly to bed. Nature is no law unto them. They let\r\ntheir children suffer and die, or unmercifully abuse them, unless the\r\nwhite man or woman prescribe rules in the nursery for them to go by.\r\nWhenever the white woman superintends the nursery, whether the climate\r\nbe cold or hot, they increase faster than any other people on the globe;\r\nbut on large plantations, remote from her influence, the negro\r\npopulation invariably diminishes, unless the overseer take upon himself\r\nthose duties in the lying-in and nursery department, which on small\r\nestates are attended to by the mistress. She often sits up at night with\r\nsick children and administers to their wants, when their own mothers are\r\nnodding by them, and would be sound asleep if it were not for her\r\npresence. The care that white women bestow on the nursery, is one of the\r\nprincipal causes why three hundred thousand Africans, originally\r\nimported into the territory of the United States have increased to four\r\nmillions, while in the British West Indies the number imported,\r\nexceeded, by several millions, the actual population. It is also the\r\ncause why the small proprietors of negro property in Maryland, Virginia,\r\nKentucky, and Missouri are able to supply the loss on the large Southern\r\nplantations, which are cut off from the happy influence of the presiding\r\ngenius over civilization, morality, and population--the white woman.\r\n\r\nThe prognathous race require government also in their religious\r\nexercises, or they degenerate into fanatical saturnalia. A discreet\r\nwhite man or woman should always be present to regulate their religious\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nHere the investigation into the ethnology of the prognathous race must\r\nclose, at least, for the present, leaving the most interesting part,\r\nFetichism, the indigenous religion of the African tribes, untouched. It\r\nis the key to the negro character, which is difficult to learn from mere\r\nexperience. Those who are not accustomed to them have great trouble and\r\ndifficulty in managing negroes; and in consequence thereof treat them\r\nbadly. If their ethnology was better and more generally understood,\r\ntheir value would be greatly increased, and their condition, as a\r\nlaboring class, would be more enviable, compared to the European\r\npeasants, than it already is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\nIN THE\r\n\r\nLIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nE. N. ELLIOTT, L.L.D.,\r\n\r\nOF MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\nIN THE\r\n\r\nLIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are some who deny the unity of the human race; with such we have\r\nno controversy, but it is a part of our religious belief, that \"God made\r\nof one blood all nations that dwell on the face of the earth;\" and on\r\nthis we would base one of our arguments for the subordination of a part\r\nof the human family. It is not necessary to the vindication of our\r\ncause, or of truth, to deny the authority, or to fritter away the\r\nevident meaning of any part of the word of God, as is done by most of\r\nthe abolitionists. It is sufficient for our purpose that we have shown\r\nthat the negro is an inferior variety of the human race; that he is\r\ninferior in his physical structure, and in his mental and moral\r\norganization. This orgnization incapacitates him for emerging, by his\r\nown will and power, from barbarism, and achieving civilization and\r\nrefinement. History teaches the same lesson. We find Africa to-day, just\r\nas it was three thousand years ago. When God created man he said to him,\r\n\"Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and\r\nhave dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,\r\nand over every living thing that moveth on the face of the earth.\" And\r\nagain, upon the re-creation after the flood, he repeated the command, in\r\nalmost the same words, to Noah and his sons. This command shows that God\r\nhad a purpose with regard to the physical world, in placing man upon it,\r\nand that man has a mission to fulfill in subduing it, and acquiring a\r\ncontrol, not only over animate but also over inanimate nature. Indeed,\r\nthe one is essential to the other. Man can not control and subdue the\r\ninferior animals, until he has acquired some control over the powers of\r\nnature. Place him in the forest naked and unarmed, and many of the\r\nanimals are his superiors; but endow his mind with a knowledge of\r\nnature's laws, and thus enable him to make them subservient to his\r\npurposes, and he becomes irresistible; a god on earth. In fulfilling\r\nthis command, man elevates his nature as he increases his knowledge, and\r\nthereby extends his powers. God requires that every part of the human\r\nfamily shall fulfill this great command, and contribute their part in\r\nrendering subservient to human use, all the faculties of nature. Nay,\r\neven where the one talent is misimproved, he takes it away and gives it\r\nto him, who has ten talents. It is on this principle that it is right\r\nand in accordance with the ordinance of God, to dispossess of their\r\nlands, mines, waterpowers, harbors, etc., a savage nation, possessing,\r\nbut not improving them, and convert them to the uses of the world of\r\nmankind. This is the warrant for the conflict of civilization with\r\nbarbarism. Not to go back to former times, it is this precept which has\r\nconverted the former howling wilderness of this Western World, into an\r\nearthly paradise, affording an ample subsistence to happy millions of\r\nthe most enlightened of the human family. It is this that causes effete\r\ndynasties and nations to disappear from the face of the world, and their\r\nplaces to be supplied by those full of life and energy. It is this that\r\nis rolling back and blotting out the mongrel races of the New World, to\r\nmake room for the onward march of a higher civilization.\r\n\r\nThe manifest destiny men are not so far wrong after all; but instead of\r\ndestiny, it is the purpose and ordinance of God. Upon this principle has\r\nEngland acted in reference to India, Australia, China, and in almost\r\nevery region of the globe. It is upon this principle that Europe is now\r\ncontrolling the destinies of the Old World, as the United States, if\r\nthey are true to themselves, will control the destinies of the New. This\r\nhas governed us in requiring that Japan should open her ports to the\r\ncommerce, and her coal mines to the navies of the world; that she should\r\nenrol herself in the brotherhood of nations, and perform her part in the\r\ngreat drama of life. It is upon this principle that England, France, and\r\nthe United States, are requiring the same thing of China; and it is upon\r\nthis principle that the vagrant is arrested in your streets and sent to\r\nthe work-house.\r\n\r\nThese principles are clearly enunciated, and ably defended by J. Q.\r\nAdams in his celebrated speech on the Chinese question, delivered in\r\n1841. It is true, that he applies them to the rights of commerce only;\r\nbut by legitimate deduction, they are as applicable to the rights of\r\nlabor, as to the rights of commerce. Although nations and races have\r\nalways acted on these principles, yet at the time of the delivery of\r\nthis speech, so startling were the positions assumed by Mr. Adams, that\r\nbut few could be found who were prepared to defend them, yet none were\r\nable to controvert them. Their general adoption at the present day only\r\nshows what history has so long taught, that master minds are generally\r\nin advance of their age.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Memoir of J. Q. Adams,\" by Josiah Quincy, we have a report of\r\nthis speech. Speaking of the Chinese war, Mr. Adams says, \"that by the\r\nlaw of nations is to be understood, not one code of laws, binding alike\r\non all nations of the earth, but a system of rules, varying according to\r\nthe condition and character of the nations concerned. There is a law of\r\nnations among Christian communities, which is the law recognized by the\r\nConstitution of the United States, as obligatory upon them in their\r\nintercourse with European States and colonies. But we have a different\r\nlaw of nations regulating our intercourse with the Indian tribes on this\r\ncontinent; another between us and the woolly-headed nations of Africa;\r\nanother with the Barbary powers; another with the flowery land, or\r\nCelestial empire.\" Then, reasoning on the rights of property,\r\nestablished by labor, by occupation, by compact, he maintains \"that the\r\nright of exchange, barter--in other words, of commerce--necessarily\r\nfollows; that a state of nature among men is a state of peace; the\r\npursuit of happiness, man's natural right; that is the duty of all men\r\nto contribute, as much as is in their power, to one another's happiness,\r\nand that there is no other way by which they can so well contribute to\r\nthe comfort and well-being of one another, as by commerce, or the mutual\r\nexchange of equivalents.\" These views and principles he thus\r\nillustrates:\r\n\r\n\"The duty of commercial intercourse between nations, is laid down in\r\nterms sufficiently positive by Vattel, but he afterwards qualifies it by\r\na restriction, which, unless itself restricted, annuls it altogether. He\r\nsays that, although the general duty of commercial intercourse is\r\nincumbent upon nations, yet every nation may exclude any particular\r\nbranch or article of trade, which it may deem injurious to its\r\ninterests. This can not be denied. But then a nation may multiply these\r\nparticular exclusions, until they become general, and equivalent to a\r\ntotal interdict of commerce; and this, time out of mind, has been the\r\ninflexible policy of the Chinese empire. So says Vattel, without\r\naffixing any note of censure upon it. Yet it is manifestly incompatible\r\nwith the position which he had previously laid down, that commercial\r\nintercourse between nations is a moral obligation upon them all.\"\r\n\r\nThe same doctrine, with regard to the duties of _individuals_ in a\r\ncommunity, that is here advanced by Mr. Adams with regard to _races_ and\r\n_nations_, is thus set forth in Blackstone's Commentaries, book iv,\r\nchap. xxxiii: \"_There is not a more necessary, or more certain maxim, in\r\nthe frame and constitution of society, than that every individual must\r\ncontribute his share, in order to the well-being of the community._\"\r\n\r\nThe first principle laid down by Mr. Adams is, that the same code of\r\ninternational law does not apply to all nations alike, but that it\r\nvaries with the condition and character of the people; that one code of\r\nlaws applies to the enlightened and Christian nations of Europe, but an\r\nentirely different one to the pagan, woolly-headed, barbarians of\r\nAfrica. What would be just and right with regard to the African, would\r\nbe eminently unjust towards the European. Though it would be a great\r\nwrong to reduce the European to a condition of servitude, it does not\r\nfollow that it would be equally wrong to enslave the African. If all the\r\nhuman races were alike, one code of international laws would apply to\r\nthe whole, but so long as the African continues to be an inferior race,\r\nthey must be treated as such.\r\n\r\nBut again, Mr. Adams clearly lays down the principle that no nation or\r\nrace can be permitted, in any way, to isolate itself from the community\r\nof nations, but is morally bound to contribute all in its power to the\r\nwell-being of the whole race, at the same time that it secures its own.\r\nIf it possesses territory which it occupies, but does not improve, it\r\nmust yield it to the claims of civiilization. If it has productions\r\nvaluable to the world, it is morally bound to exchange them. If it has\r\nports, harbors, coal mines, or other facilities for commerce and\r\nmanufactures, it must allow other nations to participate in its\r\nadvantages. If it has a superabundant supply of labor, it must be\r\nrendered available. If, then, it is right that civilization and progress\r\nshould appropriate the hunting grounds of the Indian race; if it is\r\nright that China and Japan should be required to open their ports to the\r\ncommerce of the world, it must be equally right that the great store\r\nhouse of labor in Africa should be opened for the benefit of the human\r\nrace. In the Western World, a vast continent of fertile land and\r\npropitious climate, was possessed, not improved, by a sparse hunter\r\nrace; but the law of God and of nations required that the earth should\r\nbe subdued and replenished, and now God has enlarged Japheth, and he\r\ndwells in these tents of Shem. China, Japan, and other regions of Asia,\r\nare inhabited by teeming millions, rich in the productions of art, yet\r\nscarcely able to obtain a meagre sustenance, and rigidly excluding all\r\nintercourse with the outer world, but at the demands of commerce the\r\nbarriers are broken down, and they, in common with other nations, are\r\nbenefited by the change. Africa has long possessed a superabundant\r\npopulation of indolent, degraded, pagan savages, useless to the world\r\nand to themselves. Numberless efforts have been made to elevate them in\r\nthe scale of existence, in their own country, but all in vain. Even when\r\npartially civilized, under the control of the white man, they soon\r\nrelapse into barbarism, if emancipated from this control. But a colony\r\nof them, some two hundred years since, were imported into the Western\r\nWorld, and placed subordinate to the white race; and now, if we are to\r\nbelieve the abolitionists, they have improved so rapidly as to have\r\nbecome equal, if not superior, to the white race. Certainly they are far\r\nsuperior to their ancestors, or their brethren in Africa. At the same\r\ntime, they have conferred an equal benefit on the world. They supply a\r\ndemand for labor which can not otherwise be met, and their products not\r\nonly clothe the civilized world, but also are the life-blood of its\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to the discussion of this topic, that we should show\r\n_what_ are the laws of nations, applicable to the different races\r\nenumerated by Mr. Adams; though it is manifest to the most casual\r\nobserver, that the laws applicable to them are radically different. What\r\nwould be thought of a minister at the court of St. James, who should\r\npropose to carry out with Great Britain, the same course of policy we\r\npursue towards the Indian tribes; or of the English minister at our\r\ncapital, who would exact from us the concessions required of the rajahs\r\nof India, or the chiefs of Australia? The radical difference is this:\r\namong civilized and Christian nations, the law recognizes a perfect\r\nequality, and requires an entire reciprocity; but between an elevated\r\nand a degraded or inferior race, this inequality is recognized, and an\r\ninfluence and a superiority is accorded to the one, which is denied to\r\nthe other. This is well illustrated by our present intercourse with\r\nMexico, and should we establish a protectorate over that unhappy\r\ncountry, for their good and our own, it would be in strict accordance\r\nwith these principles. With some nations we have diplomatic intercourse,\r\non terms of perfect equality and reciprocity; others we treat as\r\ninferiors, and assume over them some degree of control, while we\r\nnevertheless recognize them as legitimate governments. But there are\r\nother nations or races, with whom we form no diplomatic relations, and\r\nwhose governments we do not recognize. In this latter class are included\r\nmost of the inhabitants of Africa, and of Hayti; or in other words, the\r\n_negro race_. The reason is, that those nations performing their duties\r\nto the human race, according to the ordinance of God, are to be\r\nrecognized as not needing our assistance, or requiring our guardianship;\r\nthose fulfilling only in part, should be considered in a state of\r\ntutelage, but those that fulfill none, or but few of these duties,\r\nrequire to be made subservient to the superior races, in order that they\r\nmay fulfill the great ends of their existence. This subordination has\r\nexisted in all times, among all nations, and with all races. But as soon\r\nas any race became so developed as no longer to require it, it ceased to\r\nexist. In this way, and in this alone,--except by the deportation of the\r\nslaves--has slavery ever ceased to exist, in any community; nor can it\r\nbe otherwise in the future. Emancipation in name, is not always freedom\r\nin reality. The free blacks of our Northern States and the West Indies,\r\nare, as a mass, more abject slaves than any on our Southern plantations.\r\nNor is it possible for them to acquire a more elevated position, until\r\nthey shall have acquired the requisite qualifications for that position.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, with the exception of serfdom, peonage, and\r\npolitical slavery, this subordination is confined to the negro race. Why\r\nis this so? Manifestly because they have shown themselves incapable, in\r\ntheir own land, of emerging from barbarism, achieving civilization and\r\nrefinement, performing their duties to the human race, and becoming\r\nentitled to a position as equals among the nations of the earth. Until\r\nsuch improvement takes place as shall entitle them to this exalted\r\nposition, their own happiness and well-being, their duties to the human\r\nrace, the claims of civilization, the progress of society, the law of\r\nnations, and the ordinance of God, require that they should be placed in\r\na subordinate position to a superior race. Experience also shows us\r\nthat this is their normal and natural position. In their native land\r\nthey still are what they have always been, a pagan, savage, servile\r\nrace, fulfilling their duties neither to themselves, to God, nor to the\r\nhuman race; but under the tutelage of a superior race, they are elevated\r\nin the scale of existence, improved mentally, morally, and physically,\r\nand are thus enabled to do their part in contributing to the well-being\r\nof the human race. But so far as our experience goes, this development\r\nis not permanent, but is liable to retrogression as soon as the\r\ninfluence of the superior race is removed. Like the electro-magnet,\r\nwhose power is lost the moment it is insulated from the vivifying power\r\nof electricity, so the servile race loses its power when removed from\r\nthe control of a superior intellect. The example of our own free blacks,\r\nthose emancipated in the West Indies, Sierra Leone, and even Liberia,\r\nare conclusive on this point.\r\n\r\nIt becomes us not to speculate too curiously concerning God's plan in\r\ngoverning the world, much less to strive to thwart his purposes with our\r\npuny arms; he will work out his purposes of good to the human race, in\r\nhis own good time and way, whether it meets our views or not. But from\r\nthe revelation of his purpose concerning the descendants of the three\r\nprogenitors of the human race after the flood, it is manifest that the\r\nchildren of Ham were to be a servile race; as their final\r\ndisinthrallment is nowhere spoken of, it is exceedingly improbable that\r\nslavery will cease to exist till the end of time. It is true that\r\nEthiopia shall stretch forth her hands to God; but this is being\r\nfulfilled on a grander scale than ever before has been witnessed, even\r\nin our midst, in this Western World, where God has enlarged Japheth,\r\nwhere he dwells in the tents of Shem, and where Cainan is his servant.\r\n\r\nPORT GIBSON, MISSISSIPPI, _February 22, 1860_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nSUPREME COURT\r\n\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nIN THE\r\n\r\nDRED SCOTT CASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRED SCOTT DECISION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER TERM, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRED SCOTT\r\n\r\n_versus_\r\n\r\nJOHN F. A. SANDFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRED SCOTT, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, _v._ JOHN F. A. SANDFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit Court of\r\nthe United States for the district of Missouri.\r\n\r\nIt was an action of trespass _vi et armis_ instituted in the Circuit\r\nCourt by Scott against Sandford.\r\n\r\nPrior to the institution of the present suit, an action was brought by\r\nScott for his freedom in the Circuit Court of St. Louis county, (State\r\ncourt,) where there was a verdict and judgment in his favor. On a writ\r\nof error to the Supreme Court of the State, the judgment below was\r\nreversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court, where it was\r\ncontinued to await the decision of the case now in question.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of Scott contained three counts: one, that Sandford had\r\nassaulted the plaintiff; one, that he had assaulted Harriet Scott, his\r\nwife; and one, that he had assaulted Eliza Scott and Lizzie Scott, his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSandford appeared, and filed the following plea:\r\n\r\n       DRED SCOTT         }\r\n        _v._              } _Plea to the Jurisdiction of the Court._\r\n  JOHN F. A. SANDFORD.    }\r\n\r\n                             APRIL TERM, 1854.\r\n\r\nAnd the said John F. A. Sandford, in his own proper person, comes and\r\nsays that this court ought not to have or take further cognizance of the\r\naction aforesaid, because he says that said cause of action, and each\r\nand every of them, (if any such have accrued to the said Dred Scott,)\r\naccrued to the said Dred Scott out of the jurisdiction of this court,\r\nand exclusively within the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of\r\nMissouri, for that, to wit: the said plaintiff, Dred Scott, is not a\r\ncitizen of the State of Missouri, as alleged in his declaration, because\r\nhe is a negro of African descent; his ancestors were of pure African\r\nblood, and were brought into this country and sold as negro slaves, and\r\nthis the said Sandford is ready to verify. Wherefore, he prays judgment\r\nwhether this court can or will take further cognizance of the action\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\n                                              JOHN F. A. SANDFORD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo this plea there was a demurrer in the usual form, which was argued in\r\nApril, 1854, when the court gave judgment that the demurrer should be\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1854, the defendant, in pursuance of an agreement between\r\ncounsel, and with the leave of the court, pleaded in bar of the action:\r\n\r\n1. Not guilty.\r\n\r\n2. That the plaintiff was a negro slave, the lawful property of the\r\ndefendant, and, as such, the defendant gently laid his hands upon him,\r\nand thereby had only restrained him, as the defendant had a right to do.\r\n\r\n3. That with respect to the wife and daughters of the plaintiff, in the\r\nsecond and third counts of the declaration mentioned, the defendant had,\r\nas to them, only acted in the same manner, and in virtue of the same\r\nlegal right.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these pleas, the plaintiff joined issue; and to the\r\nsecond and third, filed replications alleging that the defendant, of his\r\nown wrong and without the cause in his second and third pleas alleged,\r\ncommitted the trespasses, etc.\r\n\r\nThe counsel then filed the following agreed statement of facts, viz:\r\n\r\nIn the year 1834, the plaintiff was a negro slave belonging to Dr.\r\nEmerson, who was a surgeon in the army of the United States. In that\r\nyear, 1834, said Dr. Emerson took the plaintiff from the State of\r\nMissouri to the military post at Rock Island, in the State of Illinois,\r\nand held him there as a slave until the month of April or May, 1836. At\r\nthe time last mentioned, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff from\r\nsaid military post at Rock Island to the military post at Fort Snelling,\r\nsituate on the west bank of the Mississippi river, in the Territory\r\nknown as Upper Louisiana, acquired by the United States of France, and\r\nsituate north of the latitude of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes\r\nnorth, and north of the State of Missouri. Said Dr. Emerson held the\r\nplaintiff in slavery at said Fort Snelling, from said last-mentioned\r\ndate until the year 1838.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1835, Harriet, who is named in the second count of the\r\nplaintiff's declaration, was the negro slave of Major Taliaferro, who\r\nbelonged to the army of the United States. In that year, 1835, said\r\nMajor Taliaferro took said Harriet to said Fort Snelling, a military\r\npost, situated as hereinbefore stated, and kept her there as a slave\r\nuntil the year 1836, and then sold and delivered her as a slave at said\r\nFort Snelling unto the said Dr. Emerson hereinbefore named. Said Dr.\r\nEmerson held said Harriet in slavery at said Fort Snelling until the\r\nyear 1838.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836, the plaintiff and said Harriet at said Fort Snelling,\r\nwith the consent of said Dr. Emerson, who then claimed to be their\r\nmaster and owner, intermarried, and took each other for husband and\r\nwife. Eliza and Lizzie, named in the third count of the plaintiff's\r\ndeclaration, are the fruit of that marriage. Eliza is about fourteen\r\nyears old, and was born on board the steamboat Gipsey, north of the\r\nnorth line of the State of Missouri, and upon the river Mississippi.\r\nLizzie is about seven years old, and was born in the State of Missouri,\r\nat the military post called Jefferson Barracks.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1838, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff and said\r\nHarriet and their said daughter Eliza, from said Fort Snelling to the\r\nState of Missouri, where they have ever since resided.\r\n\r\nBefore the commencement of this suit, said Dr. Emerson sold and conveyed\r\nthe plaintiff, said Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie, to the defendant, as\r\nslaves, and the defendant has ever since claimed to hold them and each\r\nof them as slaves.\r\n\r\nAt the times mentioned in the plaintiff's declaration, the defendant,\r\nclaiming to be owner as aforesaid, laid his hands upon said plaintiff,\r\nHarriet, Eliza, and Lizzie, and imprisoned them, doing in this respect,\r\nhowever, no more than what he might lawfully do if they were of right\r\nhis slaves at such times.\r\n\r\nFurther proof may be given on the trial for either party.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that Dred Scott brought suit for his freedom in the Circuit\r\nCourt of St. Louis county; that there was a verdict and judgment in his\r\nfavor; that on a writ of error to the Supreme Court, the judgment below\r\nwas reversed, and the same remanded to the Circuit Court, where it has\r\nbeen continued to await the decision of this case.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1854, the cause went before a jury, who found the following\r\nverdict, viz: \"As to the first issue joined in this case, we of the jury\r\nfind the defendant not guilty; and as to the issue secondly above\r\njoined, we of the jury find that before and at the time when, etc., in\r\nthe first count mentioned, the said Dred Scott was a negro slave, the\r\nlawful property of the defendant; and as to the issue thirdly above\r\njoined, we, the jury, find that before and at the time when, etc., in\r\nthe second and third counts mentioned, the said Harriet, wife of said\r\nDred Scott, and Eliza and Lizzie, the daughters of the said Dred Scott,\r\nwere negro slaves, the lawful property of the defendant.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, the court gave judgment for the defendant.\r\n\r\nAfter an ineffectual motion for a new trial, the plaintiff filed the\r\nfollowing bill of exceptions.\r\n\r\nOn the trial of this cause by the jury, the plaintiff, to maintain the\r\nissues on his part, read to the jury the following agreed statement of\r\nfacts, (see agreement above.) No further testimony was given to the jury\r\nby either party. Thereupon the plaintiff moved the court to give to the\r\njury the following instruction, viz:\r\n\r\n\"That, upon the facts agreed to by the parties, they ought to find for\r\nthe plaintiff. The court refused to give such instruction to the jury,\r\nand the plaintiff, to such refusal, then and there duly excepted.\"\r\n\r\nThe court then gave the following instruction to the jury, on motion of\r\nthe defendant:\r\n\r\n\"The jury are instructed, that upon the facts in this case, the law is\r\nwith the defendant.\" The plaintiff excepted to this instruction.\r\n\r\nUpon these exceptions, the case came up to this court.\r\n\r\nIt was argued at December term, 1855, and ordered to be reargued at the\r\npresent term.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was now argued by Mr. Blair and Mr. G. F. Curtis for the plaintiff in\r\nerror, and by Mr. Geyer and Mr. Johnson for the defendant in error.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice Taney delivered the opinion of the court.\r\n\r\nThis case has been twice argued. After the argument of the last term,\r\ndifferences of opinion were found to exist among the members of the\r\ncourt; and as the questions in controversy are of the highest\r\nimportance, and the court was at that time much pressed by the ordinary\r\nbusiness of the term, it was deemed advisable to continue the case, and\r\ndirect a reargument on some of the points, in order that we might have\r\nan opportunity of giving to the whole subject a more deliberate\r\nconsideration. It has accordingly been again argued by counsel, and\r\nconsidered by the court; and I now proceed to deliver its opinion.\r\n\r\nThere are two leading questions presented by the record:\r\n\r\n1. Had the Circuit Court of the United States jurisdiction to hear and\r\ndetermine the case between these parties? And\r\n\r\n2. If it had jurisdiction, is the judgment it has given erroneous or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff in error, who was also the plaintiff in the court below,\r\nwas, with his wife and children, held as slaves by the defendant, in the\r\nState of Missouri; and he brought this action in the Circuit Court of\r\nthe United States for that district, to assert the title of himself and\r\nhis family to freedom.\r\n\r\nThe declaration is in the form usually adopted in that State to try\r\nquestions of this description, and contains the averment necessary to\r\ngive the court jurisdiction; that he and the defendant are citizens of\r\ndifferent States; that is, that he is a citizen of Missouri, and the\r\ndefendant a citizen of New York.\r\n\r\nThe defendant pleaded in abatement to the jurisdiction of the court,\r\nthat the plaintiff was not a citizen of the State of Missouri, as\r\nalleged in his declaration, being a negro of African descent, whose\r\nancestors were of pure African blood, and who were brought into this\r\ncountry and sold as slaves.\r\n\r\nTo this plea the plaintiff demurred, and the defendant joined in\r\ndemurrer. The court overruled the plea, and gave judgment that the\r\ndefendant should answer over. And he therefore put in sundry pleas in\r\nbar, upon which issues were joined; and at the trial the verdict and\r\njudgment were in his favor. Whereupon the plaintiff brought this writ of\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nBefore we speak of the pleas in bar, it will be proper to dispose of the\r\nquestions which have arisen on the plea in abatement.\r\n\r\nThat plea denies the right of the plaintiff to sue in a court of the\r\nUnited States, for the reasons therein stated.\r\n\r\nIf the question raised by it is legally before us, and the court should\r\nbe of opinion that the facts stated in it disqualify the plaintiff from\r\nbecoming a citizen, in the sense in which that word is used in the\r\nConstitution of the United States, then the judgment of the Circuit\r\nCourt is erroneous and must be reversed.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested, however, that this plea is not before us; and that as\r\nthe judgment in the court below on this plea was in favor of the\r\nplaintiff, he does not seek to reverse it, or bring it before the court\r\nfor revision by his writ of error; and also that the defendant waived\r\nthis defense by pleading over, and thereby admitted the jurisdiction of\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nBut in making this objection, we think the peculiar and limited\r\njurisdiction of courts of the United States has not been adverted to.\r\nThis peculiar and limited jurisdiction, has made it necessary, in these\r\ncourts, to adopt different rules and principles of pleading, so far as\r\njurisdiction is concerned, from those which regulate courts of common\r\nlaw in England, and in the different States of the Union which have\r\nadopted the common-law rules.\r\n\r\nIn these last-mentioned courts, where their character and rank are\r\nanalagous to that of a Circuit Court of the United States; in other\r\nwords, where they are what the law terms courts of general jurisdiction;\r\nthey are presumed to have jurisdiction, unless the contrary appears. No\r\naverment in the pleadings of the plaintiff is necessary, in order to\r\ngive jurisdiction. If the defendant objects to it, he must plead it\r\nspecially, and unless the fact on which he relies is found to be true by\r\na jury, or admitted to be true by the plaintiff, the jurisdiction can\r\nnot be disputed in an appellate court.\r\n\r\nNow, it is not necessary to inquire whether in courts of that\r\ndescription a party who pleads over in bar, when a plea to the\r\njurisdiction has been ruled against him, does or does not waive his\r\nplea; nor whether upon a judgment in his favor on the pleas in bar, and\r\na writ of error brought by the plaintiff, the question upon the plea in\r\nabatement would be open for revision in the appellate court. Cases that\r\nmay have been decided in such courts, or rules that may have been laid\r\ndown by common-law pleaders, can have no influence in the decision in\r\nthis court. Because, under the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, the rules which govern the pleadings in its courts, in questions\r\nof jurisdiction, stand on different principles and are regulated by\r\ndifferent laws.\r\n\r\nThis difference arises, as we have said, from the peculiar character of\r\nthe Government of the United States. For although it is sovereign and\r\nsupreme in its appropriate sphere of action, yet it does not possess all\r\nthe powers which usually belong to the sovereignty of a nation. Certain\r\nspecified powers, enumerated in the Constitution, have been conferred\r\nupon it; and neither the legislative, executive, nor judicial\r\ndepartments of the Government can lawfully exercise any authority beyond\r\nthe limits marked out by the Constitution. And in regulating the\r\njudicial department, the cases in which the courts of the United States\r\nshall have jurisdiction are particularly and specifically enumerated and\r\ndefined; and they are not authorized to take cognizance of any case\r\nwhich does not come within the description therein specified. Hence,\r\nwhen a plaintiff sues in a court of the United States, it is necessary\r\nthat he should show, in his pleadings, that the suit he brings is within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the court, and that he is entitled to sue there. And\r\nif he omits to do this, and should, by any oversight of the Circuit\r\nCourt, obtain a judgment in his favor, the judgment would be reversed in\r\nthe appellate court for want of jurisdiction in the court below. The\r\njurisdiction would not be presumed, as in the case of a common-law\r\nEnglish or State court, unless the contrary appeared. But the record,\r\nwhen it comes before the appellate court, must show, affirmatively, that\r\nthe inferior court had authority, under the Constitution, to hear and\r\ndetermine the case. And if the plaintiff claims a right to sue in a\r\nCircuit Court of the United States, under that provision of the\r\nConstitution which gives jurisdiction in controversies between citizens\r\nof different States, he must distinctly aver in his pleadings that they\r\nare citizens of different States; and he can not maintain his suit\r\nwithout showing that fact in the pleadings.\r\n\r\nThis point was decided in the case of Bingham _v._ Cabot, (in 3 Dall.,\r\n382,) and ever since adhered to by the court. And in Jackson _v._ Ashton\r\n(8 Pet., 148,) it was held that the objection to which it was open could\r\nnot be waived by the opposite party, because consent of parties could\r\nnot give jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to accumulate cases on this subject. Those already\r\nreferred to, and the cases of Capron _v._ Van Noorden, (in 2 Cr. 126.,)\r\nand Montalet _v._ Murray, (4 Cr., 46,) are sufficient to show the rule\r\nof which we have spoken. The case of Capron _v._ Van Noorden strikingly\r\nillustrates the difference between a common-law court and a court of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the fact of citizenship is avered in the declaration, and\r\nthe defendant does not deny it, and put it in issue by plea in\r\nabatement, he can not offer evidence at the trial to disprove it, and\r\nconsequently can not avail himself of the objection in the appellate\r\ncourt, unless the defect should be apparent in some other part of the\r\nrecord. For if there is no plea in abatement, and the want of\r\njurisdiction does not appear in any other part of the transcript brought\r\nup by the writ of error, the undisputed averment of citizenship in the\r\ndeclaration must be taken in this court to be true. In this case, the\r\ncitizenship is averred, but it is denied by the defendant in the manner\r\nrequired by the rules of pleading, and the fact upon which the denial is\r\nbased is admitted by the demurrer. And, if the plea and demurrer, and\r\njudgment of the court below upon it, are before us upon this record, the\r\nquestion to be decided is, whether the facts stated in the plea are\r\nsufficient to show that the plaintiff is not entitled to sue as a\r\ncitizen in a court of the United States.\r\n\r\nWe think they are before us. The plea in abatement and the judgment of\r\nthe court upon it, are a part of the judicial proceedings in the Circuit\r\nCourt, and are there recorded as such; and a writ of error always brings\r\nup to the superior court the whole record of the proceedings in the\r\ncourt below. And in the case of the United States _v._ Smith, (11\r\nWheat., 172,) this court said, that the case being brought up by writ of\r\nerror, the whole record was under the consideration of this court. And\r\nthis being the case in the present instance, the plea in abatement is\r\nnecessarily under consideration; and it becomes, therefore, our duty to\r\ndecide whether the facts stated in the plea are or are not sufficient to\r\nshow that the plaintiff is not entitled to sue as a citizen in a court\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a very serious question, and one that now for the\r\nfirst time has been brought for decision before this court. But it is\r\nbrought here by those who have a right to bring it, and it is our duty\r\nto meet it and decide it.\r\n\r\nThe question is simply this: Can a negro whose ancestors were imported\r\ninto this country, and sold as slaves, become a member of the political\r\ncommunity formed and brought into existence by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and as such become entitled to all the rights and\r\nprivileges and immunities guaranteed to the citizen? One of which rights\r\nis the privilege of suing in a court of the United States in the cases\r\nspecified in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that the plea applies to that class of persons only\r\nwhose ancestors were negroes of the African race, and imported into this\r\ncountry, and sold and held as slaves. The only matter in issue before\r\nthe court, therefore, is, whether the descendants of such slaves, when\r\nthey shall be emancipated, or who are born of parents who had become\r\nfree before their birth, are citizens of a State, in the sense in which\r\nthe word citizen is used in the Constitution of the United States. And\r\nthis being the only matter in dispute on the pleadings, the court must\r\nbe understood as speaking in this opinion of that class only, that is,\r\nof those persons who are the descendants of Africans who were imported\r\ninto this country, and sold as slaves.\r\n\r\nThe situation of this population was altogether unlike that of the\r\nIndian race. The latter, it is true, formed no part of the colonial\r\ncommunities, and never amalgamated with them in social connections or in\r\ngovernment. But although they were uncivilized, they were yet a free and\r\nindependent people, associated together in nations or tribes, and\r\ngoverned by their own laws. Many of these political communities were\r\nsituated in territories to which the white race claimed the ultimate\r\nright of dominion. But that claim was acknowledged to be subject to the\r\nright of the Indians to occupy it as long as they thought proper, and\r\nneither the English nor colonial Governments claimed or exercised any\r\ndominion over the tribe or nation by whom it was occupied, nor claimed\r\nthe right to the possession of the territory, until the tribe or nation\r\nconsented to cede it. These Indian Governments were regarded and\r\ntreated as foreign Governments, as much so as if an ocean had separated\r\nthe red man from the white; and their freedom has constantly been\r\nacknowledged, from the time of the first emigration to the English\r\ncolonies to the present day, by the different Governments which\r\nsucceeded each other. Treaties have been negotiated with them, and their\r\nalliance sought for in war; and the people who compose these Indian\r\npolitical communities have always been treated as foreigners not living\r\nunder our Government. It is true that the course of events has brought\r\nthe Indian tribes within the limits of the United States under\r\nsubjection to the white race; and it has been found necessary, for their\r\nsake as well as our own, to regard them as in a state of pupilage, and\r\nto legislate to a certain extent over them and the territory they\r\noccupy. But they may, without doubt, like the subjects of any other\r\nforeign Government, be naturalized by the authority of Congress, and\r\nbecome citizens of a State, and of the United States; and if an\r\nindividual should leave his nation or tribe, and take up his abode among\r\nthe white population, he would be entitled to all the rights and\r\nprivileges which would belong to an emigrant from any other foreign\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWe proceed to examine the case as presented by the pleadings.\r\n\r\nThe words \"people of the United States\" and \"citizens\" are synonymous\r\nterms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the political body\r\nwho, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty, and\r\nwho hold the power and conduct the Government through their\r\nrepresentatives. They are what we familiarly call the \"sovereign\r\npeople,\" and every citizen is one of this people, and a constituent\r\nmember of this sovereignty. The question before us is, whether the class\r\nof persons described in the plea in abatement compose a portion of this\r\npeople, and are constituent members of this sovereignty? We think they\r\nare not, and that they are not included, and were not intended to be\r\nincluded, under the word \"citizens\" in the Constitution, and can\r\ntherefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument\r\nprovides for and secures to citizens of the United States. On the\r\ncontrary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and\r\ninferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dominant race,\r\nand, whether emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their\r\nauthority, and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held\r\nthe power and the government might choose to grant them.\r\n\r\nIt is not the province of the court to decide upon the justice or\r\ninjustice, the policy or impolicy, of these laws. The decision of that\r\nquestion belonged to the political or law-making power; to those who\r\nformed the sovereignty and framed the Constitution. The duty of the\r\ncourt is, to interpret the instrument they have framed, with the best\r\nlights we can obtain on the subject, and to administer it as we find it,\r\naccording to its true intent and meaning when it was adopted.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this question, we must not confound the rights of\r\ncitizenship which a State may confer within its own limits, and the\r\nrights of citizenship as a member of the Union. It does not by any means\r\nfollow, because he has all the rights and privileges of a citizen of a\r\nState, that he must be a citizen of the United States. He may have all\r\nthe rights and privileges of the citizen of a State, and yet not be\r\nentitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen in any other State.\r\nFor, previous to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States,\r\nevery State had the undoubted right to confer on whomsoever it pleased\r\nthe character of citizen, and to endow him with all its rights. But this\r\ncharacter of course was confined to the boundaries of the State, and\r\ngave him no rights or privileges in other States beyond those secured to\r\nhim by the laws of nations and the comity of States. Nor have the\r\nseveral States surrendered the power of conferring these rights and\r\nprivileges by adopting the Constitution of the United States. Each State\r\nmay still confer them upon an alien, or any one it thinks proper, or\r\nupon any class or description of persons; yet he would not be a citizen\r\nin the sense in which that word is used in the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, nor entitled to sue as such in one of its courts, nor to\r\nthe privileges and immunities of a citizen in the other States. The\r\nrights which he would acquire would be restricted to the State which\r\ngave them. The Constitution has conferred on Congress the right to\r\nestablish an uniform rule of naturalization, and this right is evidently\r\nexclusive, and has always been held by this court to be so.\r\nConsequently, no State, since the adoption of the Constitution, can by\r\nnaturalizing an alien invest him with the rights and privileges secured\r\nto a citizen of a State under the Federal Government, although, so far\r\nas the State alone was concerned, he would undoubtedly be entitled to\r\nthe rights of a citizen, and clothed with all the rights and immunities\r\nwhich the Constitution and laws of the State attached to that\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt is very clear, therefore, that no State can, by any act or law of its\r\nown, passed since the adoption of the Constitution, introduce a new\r\nmember into the political community created by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. It cannot make him a member of this community by making\r\nhim a member of its own. And for the same reason it cannot introduce any\r\nperson or description of persons, who were not intended to be embraced\r\nin this new political family, which the Constitution brought into\r\nexistence, but were intended to be excluded from it.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises, whether the provisions of the Constitution, in\r\nrelation to the personal rights and privileges to which the citizen of a\r\nState should be entitled, embraced the negro African race, at that time\r\nin this country, or who might afterward be imported, who had then or\r\nshould afterward be made free in any State; and to put it in the power\r\nof a single State to make him a citizen of the United States, and endue\r\nhim with the full rights of citizenship in every other State without\r\ntheir consent? Does the Constitution of the United States act upon him\r\nwhenever he shall be made free under the laws of a State, and raised\r\nthere to the rank of a citizen, and immediately clothe him with all the\r\nprivileges of a citizen in every other State, and in its own courts?\r\n\r\nThe court think the affirmative of these propositions cannot be\r\nmaintained. And if it cannot, the plaintiff in error could not be a\r\ncitizen of the State of Missouri, within the meaning of the Constitution\r\nof the United States, and, consequently, was not entitled to sue in its\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nIt is true, every person, and every class and description of persons,\r\nwho were at the time of the adoption of the Constitution recognized as\r\ncitizens in the several States, became also citizens of this new\r\npolitical body; but none other; it was formed by them, and for them and\r\ntheir posterity, but for no one else. And the personal rights and\r\nprivileges guaranteed to citizens of this new sovereignty were intended\r\nto embrace those only who were then members of the several State\r\ncommunities, or who should afterward by birthright or otherwise become\r\nmembers, according to the provisions of the Constitution and the\r\nprinciples on which it was founded. It was the union of those who were\r\nat that time members of distinct and separate political communities into\r\none political family, whose power, for certain specified purposes, was\r\nto extend over the whole territory of the United States. And it gave to\r\neach citizen rights and privileges outside of his State which he did not\r\nbefore possess, and placed him in every other State upon a perfect\r\nequality with its own citizens as to rights of person and rights of\r\nproperty; it made him a citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt becomes necessary, therefore, to determine who were citizens of the\r\nseveral States when the Constitution was adopted. And in order to do\r\nthis, we must recur to the governments and institutions of the thirteen\r\ncolonies, when they separated from Great Britain and formed new\r\nsovereignities, and took their places in the family of independent\r\nnations. We must inquire who, at that time, were recognized as the\r\npeople or citizens of a State, whose rights and liberties had been\r\noutraged by the English Government; and who declared their independence,\r\nand assumed the powers of Government to defend their rights by force of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the court, the legislation and histories of the times,\r\nand the language used in the Declaration of Independence, show, that\r\nneither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor their\r\ndescendants, whether they had become free or not, were then acknowledged\r\nas a part of the people, nor intended to be included in the general\r\nwords used in that memorable instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion in\r\nrelation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in the civilized and\r\nenlightened portions of the world at the time of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and when the Constitution of the United States was framed\r\nand adopted. But the public history of every European nation displays it\r\nin a manner too plain to be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThey had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an\r\ninferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race,\r\neither in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they\r\nhad no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the\r\nnegro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.\r\nHe was bought and sold, and treated as an ordinary article of\r\nmerchandise and traffic, whenever a profit could be made by it. This\r\nopinion was at that time fixed and universal in the civilized portion of\r\nthe white race. It was regarded as an axiom in morals as well as in\r\npolitics, which no one thought of disputing, or supposed to be open to\r\ndispute; and men in every grade and position in society daily and\r\nhabitually acted upon it in their private pursuits, as well as in\r\nmatters of public concern, without doubting for a moment the correctness\r\nof this opinion.\r\n\r\nAnd in no nation was this opinion more firmly fixed or more uniformly\r\nacted upon than by the English Government and English people. They not\r\nonly seized them on the coast of Africa, and sold them or held them in\r\nslavery for their own use; but they took them as ordinary articles of\r\nmerchandise to every country where they could make a profit on them, and\r\nwere far more extensively engaged in this commerce, than any other\r\nnation in the world.\r\n\r\nThe opinion thus entertained and acted upon in England was naturally\r\nimpressed upon the colonies they founded on this side of the Atlantic.\r\nAnd, accordingly, a negro of the African race was regarded by them as an\r\narticle of property, and held, and bought and sold as such, in every one\r\nof the thirteen colonies which united in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and afterward formed the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. The slaves were more or less numerous in the different colonies,\r\nas slave labor was found more or less profitable. But no one seems to\r\nhave doubted the correctness of the prevailing opinion of the time.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the different colonies furnishes positive and\r\nindisputable proof of this fact.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious, in this opinion, to enumerate the various laws they\r\npassed upon this subject. It will be sufficient, as a sample of the\r\nlegislation which then generally prevailed throughout the British\r\ncolonies, to give the laws of two of them; one being still a large\r\nslaveholding State, and the other the first State in which slavery\r\nceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe province of Maryland, in 1717, (chap, xiii, s. 5,) passed a law\r\ndeclaring \"that if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white\r\nwoman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto\r\nwoman, such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life, excepting\r\nmulattoes born of white women, who, for such intermarriage, shall only\r\nbecome servants for seven years, to be disposed of as the justices of\r\nthe county court, where such marriage so happens, shall think fit; to be\r\napplied by them toward the support of a public school within the said\r\ncounty. And any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as\r\naforesaid, with any negro or mulatto, such white man or white woman\r\nshall become servants during the term of seven years, and shall be\r\ndisposed of by the justices as aforesaid, and be applied to the uses\r\naforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nThe other colonial law to which we refer was passed by Massachusetts in\r\n1705, (chap, vi.) It is entitled \"An act for the better preventing of a\r\nspurious and mixed issue,\" etc.; and it provides, that \"if any negro or\r\nmulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the English or\r\nother Christian nation, such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped,\r\nat the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be\r\nconvicted.\"\r\n\r\nAnd \"that none of her Majesty's English or Scottish subjects, nor of any\r\nother Christian nation, within this province, shall contract matrimony\r\nwith any negro or mulatto; nor shall any person, duly authorized to\r\nsolemnize marriage, presume to join any such in marriage, on pain of\r\nforfeiting the sum of fifty pounds; one moiety thereof to her Majesty,\r\nfor and toward the support of the Government within this province, and\r\nthe other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same\r\nin any of her Majesty's courts of record within the province, by bill,\r\nplaint, or information.\"\r\n\r\nWe give both of these laws in the words used by the respective\r\nlegislative bodies, because the language in which they are framed, as\r\nwell as the provisions contained in them, show, too plainly to be\r\nmisunderstood, the degraded condition of this unhappy race. They were\r\nstill in force when the Revolution began, and are a faithful index to\r\nthe state of feeling toward the class of persons of whom they speak, and\r\nof the position they occupied throughout the thirteen colonies, in the\r\neyes and thoughts of the men who framed the Declaration of Independence\r\nand established the State Constitutions and Governments. They show that\r\na perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be erected between\r\nthe white race and the one which they had reduced to slavery, and\r\ngoverned as subjects with absolute and despotic power, and which they\r\nthen looked upon as so far below them in the scale of created beings,\r\nthat intermarriages between white persons and negroes or mulattoes were\r\nregarded as unnatural and immoral, and punished as crimes, not only in\r\nthe parties, but in the person who joined them in marriage. And no\r\ndistinction in this respect was made between the free negro or mulatto\r\nand the slave, but this stigma, of the deepest degradation, was fixed\r\nupon the whole race.\r\n\r\nWe refer to these historical facts for the purpose of showing the fixed\r\nopinions concerning that race, upon which the statesmen of that day\r\nspoke and acted. It is necessary to do this, in order to determine\r\nwhether the general terms used in the Constitution of the United States,\r\nas to the rights of man and the rights of the people, was intended to\r\ninclude them, or to give to them or their posterity the benefit of any\r\nof its provisions.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Declaration of Independence is equally conclusive:\r\n\r\nIt begins by declaring \"that when in the course of human events it\r\nbecomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which\r\nhave connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the\r\nearth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and\r\nnature's God entitle them, a decent respect for the opinions of mankind\r\nrequires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the\r\nseparation.\"\r\n\r\nIt then proceeds to say: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that\r\nall men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\ncertain unalienable rights; that among them is life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, Governments are\r\ninstituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\"\r\n\r\nThe general words above quoted would seem to embrace the whole human\r\nfamily, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day would\r\nbe so understood. But it is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved\r\nAfrican race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the\r\npeople who framed and adopted this declaration; for if the language, as\r\nunderstood in that day, would embrace them, the conduct of the\r\ndistinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence would have\r\nbeen utterly and flagrantly inconsistent with the principles they\r\nasserted; and instead of the sympathy of mankind, to which they so\r\nconfidently appealed, they would have deserved and received universal\r\nrebuke and reprobation.\r\n\r\nYet the men who framed this declaration were great men--high in literary\r\nacquirements--high in their sense of honor, and incapable of asserting\r\nprinciples inconsistent with those on which they were acting. They\r\nperfectly understood the meaning of the language they used, and how it\r\nwould be understood by others; and they knew that it would not in any\r\npart of the civilized world be supposed to embrace the negro race, which\r\nby common consent, had been excluded from civilized Governments and the\r\nfamily of nations, and doomed to slavery. They spoke and acted according\r\nto the then established doctrines and principles, and in the ordinary\r\nlanguage of the day, and no one misunderstood them. The unhappy black\r\nrace were separated from the white by indelible marks, and laws long\r\nbefore established, and were never thought of or spoken of except as\r\nproperty, and when the claims of the owner or the profit of the trader\r\nwere supposed to need protection.\r\n\r\nThis state of public opinion had undergone no change when the\r\nConstitution was adopted, as is equally evident from its provisions and\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe brief preamble sets forth by whom it was formed, for what purposes,\r\nand for whose benefit and protection. It declares that it is formed by\r\nthe _people_ of the United States; that is to say, by those who were\r\nmembers of the different political communities in the several States;\r\nand its great object is declared to be to secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to themselves and their posterity. It speaks in general terms of\r\nthe _people_ of the United States, and of _citizens_ of the several\r\nStates, when it is providing for the exercise of the powers granted or\r\nthe privileges secured to the citizen. It does not define what\r\ndescription of persons are intended to be included under these terms, or\r\nwho shall be regarded as a citizen and one of the people. It uses them\r\nas terms so well understood, that no further description or definition\r\nwas necessary.\r\n\r\nBut there are two clauses in the Constitution which point directly and\r\nspecifically to the negro race as a separate class of persons, and show\r\nclearly that they were not regarded as a portion of the people or\r\ncitizens of the Government then formed.\r\n\r\nOne of these clauses reserves to each of the thirteen States the right\r\nto import slaves until the year 1808, if it thinks proper. And the\r\nimportation which it thus sanctions was unquestionably of persons of the\r\nrace of which we are speaking, as the traffic in slaves in the United\r\nStates had always been confined to them. And by the other provision the\r\nStates pledge themselves to each other to maintain the right of property\r\nof the master, by delivering up to him any slave who may have escaped\r\nfrom his service, and be found within their respective territories. By\r\nthe first above-mentioned clause, therefore, the right to purchase and\r\nhold this property is directly sanctioned and authorized for twenty\r\nyears by the people who framed the Constitution. And by the second, they\r\npledge themselves to maintain and uphold the right of the master in the\r\nmanner specified, as long as the Government they then formed should\r\nendure. And these two provisions show, conclusively, that neither the\r\ndescription of persons therein referred to, nor their descendants, were\r\nembraced in any of the other provisions of the Constitution; for\r\ncertainly these two clauses were not intended to confer on them or their\r\nposterity the blessings of liberty, or any of the personal rights so\r\ncarefully provided for the citizen.\r\n\r\nNo one of that race had ever migrated to the United States voluntarily;\r\nall of them had been brought here as articles of merchandise. The number\r\nthat had been emancipated at that time were but few in comparison with\r\nthose held in slavery; and they were identified in the public mind with\r\nthe race to which they belonged, and regarded as a part of the slave\r\npopulation rather than the free. It is obvious that they were not even\r\nin the minds of the framers of the Constitution when they were\r\nconferring special rights and privileges upon the citizens of a State in\r\nevery other part of the Union.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when we look to the condition of this race in the several States\r\nat the time, it is impossible to believe that these rights and\r\nprivileges were intended to be extended to them.\r\n\r\nIt is very true, that in that portion of the Union where the labor of\r\nthe negro race was found to be unsuited to the climate and unprofitable\r\nto the master, but few slaves were held at the time of the Declaration\r\nof Independence; and when the Constitution was adopted, it had entirely\r\nworn out in one of them, and measures had been taken for its gradual\r\nabolition in several others. But this change had not been produced by\r\nany change of opinion in relation to this race; but because it was\r\ndiscovered, from experience, that slave labor was unsuited to the\r\nclimate and productions of these States: for some of the States, where\r\nit had ceased or nearly ceased to exist, were actively engaged in the\r\nslave trade, procuring cargoes on the coast of Africa, and transporting\r\nthem for sale to those parts of the Union where their labor was found to\r\nbe profitable, and suited to the climate and productions. And this\r\ntraffic was openly carried on, and fortunes accumulated by it, without\r\nreproach from the people of the States where they resided. And it can\r\nhardly be supposed that, in the States where it was then countenanced in\r\nits worst form--that is, in the seizure and transportation--the people\r\ncould have regarded those who were emancipated as entitled to equal\r\nrights with themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd we may here again refer, in support of this proposition, to the\r\nplain and unequivocal language of the laws of the several States, some\r\npassed after the Declaration of Independence and before the Constitution\r\nwas adopted, and some since the Government went into operation.\r\n\r\nWe need not refer, on this point, particularly to the laws of the\r\npresent slaveholding States. Their statute books are full of provisions\r\nin relation to this class, in the same spirit with the Maryland law\r\nwhich we have before quoted. They have continued to treat them as an\r\ninferior class, and to subject them to strict police regulations,\r\ndrawing a broad line of distinction between the citizen and the slave\r\nraces, and legislating in relation to them upon the same principle which\r\nprevailed at the time of the Declaration of Independence. As relates to\r\nthese States, it is too plain for argument, that they have never been\r\nregarded as a part of the people or citizens of the State, nor supposed\r\nto possess any political rights which the dominant race might not\r\nwithhold or grant at their pleasure. And as long ago as 1822, the Court\r\nof Appeals of Kentucky decided that free negroes and mulattoes were not\r\ncitizens within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States;\r\nand the correctness of this decision is recognized, and the same\r\ndoctrine affirmed, in 1 Meig's Tenn. Reports, 331.\r\n\r\nAnd if we turn to the legislation of the States where slavery had worn\r\nout, or measures taken for its speedy abolition, we shall find the same\r\nopinions and principles equally fixed and equally acted upon.\r\n\r\nThus, Massachusetts, in 1786, passed a law similar to the colonial one\r\nof which we have spoken. The law of 1786, like the law of 1705, forbids\r\nthe marriage of any white person with any negro, Indian, or mulatto, and\r\ninflicts a penalty of fifty pounds upon any one who shall join them in\r\nmarriage; and declares all such marriages absolutely null and void, and\r\ndegrades thus the unhappy issue of the marriage by fixing upon it the\r\nstain of bastardy. And this mark of degradation was renewed and again\r\nimpressed upon the race, in the careful and deliberate preparation of\r\ntheir revised code, published in 1836. This code forbids any person from\r\njoining in marriage any white person with any Indian, negro, or mulatto,\r\nand subjects the party who shall offend in this respect, to\r\nimprisonment, not exceeding six months in the common jail, or to hard\r\nlabor, and to a fine of not less than fifty nor more than two hundred\r\ndollars; and like the law of 1786, it declares the marriage to be\r\nabsolutely null and void. It will be seen that the punishment is\r\nincreased by the code upon the person who shall marry them, by adding\r\nimprisonment to a pecuniary penalty.\r\n\r\nSo, too, in Connecticut. We refer more particularly to the legislation\r\nof this State, because it was not only among the first to put an end to\r\nslavery within its own territory, but was the first to fix a mark of\r\nreprobation upon the African slave trade. The law last mentioned was\r\npassed in October, 1788, about nine months after the State had ratified\r\nand adopted the present Constitution of the Unitied States; and by that\r\nlaw it prohibited its own citizens, under severe penalties, from\r\nengaging in the trade, and declared all policies of insurance on the\r\nvessel or cargo made in the State to be null and void. But up to the\r\ntime of the adoption of the Constitution, there is nothing in the\r\nlegislation of the State indicating any change of opinion as to the\r\nrelative rights and position of the white and black races in this\r\ncountry, or indicating that it meant to place the latter, when free,\r\nupon a level with its citizens. And certainly nothing which would have\r\nled the slaveholding States to suppose that Connecticut designed to\r\nclaim for them, under the new Constitution, the equal rights and\r\nprivileges and rank of citizens in every other State.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken by Connecticut upon this subject was as early as\r\n1774, when it passed an act forbidding the further importation of slaves\r\ninto the State. But the section containing the prohibition is introduced\r\nby the following preamble:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas the increase of slaves in this State is injurious to the\r\npoor, and inconvenient.\"\r\n\r\nThis recital would appear to have been carefully introduced, in order to\r\nprevent any misunderstanding of the motive which induced the Legislature\r\nto pass the law, and places it distinctly upon the interest and\r\nconvenience of the white population--excluding the inference that it\r\nmight have been intended in any degree for the benefit of the other.\r\n\r\nAnd in the act of 1784, by which the issue of slaves, born after the\r\ntime therein mentioned, were to be free at a certain age, the section is\r\nagain introduced by a preamble assigning a similar motive for the act.\r\nIt is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas sound policy requires that the abolition of slavery should be\r\neffected as soon as may be consistent with the rights of individuals,\r\nand the public safety and welfare\"--showing that the right of property\r\nin the master was to be protected, and that the measure was one of\r\npolicy, and to prevent the injury and inconvenience, to the whites, of a\r\nslave population in the State.\r\n\r\nAnd still further pursuing its legislation, we find that in the same\r\nstatute passed in 1774, which prohibited the further importation of\r\nslaves into the State, there is also a provision by which any negro,\r\nIndian, or mulatto servant, who was found wandering out of the town or\r\nplace to which he belonged, without a written pass such as is therein\r\ndescribed, was made liable to be seized by any one, and taken before the\r\nnext authority to be examined and delivered up to his master--who was\r\nrequired to pay the charge which had accrued thereby. And a subsequent\r\nsection of the same law provides, that if any free negro shall travel\r\nwithout such pass, and shall be stopped, seized, or taken up, he shall\r\npay all charges arising thereby. And this law was in full operation when\r\nthe Constitution of the United States was adopted, and was not repealed\r\ntill 1797. So that up to that time free negroes and mulattoes were\r\nassociated with servants and slaves in the police regulations\r\nestablished by the laws of the State.\r\n\r\nAnd again, in 1833, Connecticut passed another law, which made it penal\r\nto set up or establish any school in that State for the instruction of\r\npersons of the African race not inhabitants of the State, or to instruct\r\nor teach in any such school or institution, or board or harbor for that\r\npurpose, any such person, without the previous consent in writing of the\r\ncivil authority of the town in which such school or institution might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nAnd it appears by the case of Crandall _v._ the State, reported in 10\r\nConn. Rep., 340, that upon an information filed against Prudence\r\nCrandall for a violation of this law, one of the points raised in the\r\ndefense was, that the law was a violation of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States; and that the persons instructed, although of the African\r\nrace, were citizens of other States, and therefore entitled to the\r\nrights and privileges of citizens in the State of Connecticut. But Chief\r\nJustice Dagget, before whom the case was tried, held, that persons of\r\nthat description were not citizens of a State, within the meaning of the\r\nword citizen in the Constitution of the United States, and were not\r\ntherefore entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens in other\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe case was carried up to the Supreme Court of Errors of the State, and\r\nthe question fully argued there. But the case went off upon another\r\npoint, and no opinion was expressed on this question.\r\n\r\nWe have made this particular examination into the legislative and\r\njudicial action of Connecticut, because, from the early hostility it\r\ndisplayed to the slave trade on the coast of Africa, we may expect to\r\nfind the laws of that State as lenient and favorable to the subject race\r\nas those of any other State in the Union; and if we find that at the\r\ntime the Constitution was adopted, they were not even there raised to\r\nthe rank of citizens, but were still held and treated as property, and\r\nthe laws relating to them passed with reference altogether to the\r\ninterest and convenience of the white race, we shall hardly find them\r\nelevated to a higher rank any where else.\r\n\r\nA brief notice of the laws of two other States, and we shall pass on to\r\nother considerations.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of New Hampshire, collected and finally passed in 1815, no\r\none was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the State but free\r\nwhite citizens; and the same provision is found in a subsequent\r\ncollection of the laws, made in 1855. Nothing could more strongly mark\r\nthe entire repudiation of the African race. The alien is excluded,\r\nbecause, being born in a foreign country, he can not be a member of the\r\ncommunity until he is naturalized. But why are the African race, born in\r\nthe State, not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of a\r\ncitizen? The answer is obvious; he is not, by the institutions and laws\r\nof the State, numbered among its people. He forms no part of the\r\nsovereignty of the State, and is not therefore called on to uphold and\r\ndefend it.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1822, Rhode Island, in its revised code, passed a law\r\nforbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage, from\r\njoining in marriage any white person with any negro, Indian, or\r\nmulatto, under the penalty of two hundred dollars, and declaring all\r\nsuch marriages absolutely null and void; and the same law was again\r\nre-enacted in its revised code of 1844. So that, down to the\r\nlast-mentioned period, the strongest mark of inferiority and degradation\r\nwas fastened upon the African race in that State.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to enumerate and compress in the space usually\r\nallotted to an opinion of a court, the various laws, marking the\r\ncondition of this race, which were passed from time to time after the\r\nRevolution, and before and since the adoption of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. In addition to those already referred to, it is\r\nsufficient to say, that Chancellor Kent, whose accuracy and research no\r\none will question, states in the sixth edition of his Commentaries\r\n(published in 1846, 2 vols., 258, note _b_,) that in no part of the\r\ncountry except Maine, did the African race, in point of fact,\r\nparticipate equally with the whites in the exercise of civil and\r\npolitical rights.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the States therefore shows, in a manner not to be\r\nmistaken, the inferior and subject condition of that race at the time\r\nthe Constitution was adopted, and long afterward, throughout the\r\nthirteen States by which that instrument was framed; and it is hardly\r\nconsistent with the respect due to these States, to suppose that they\r\nregarded at that time, as fellow citizens and members of the\r\nsovereignty, a class of beings whom they had thus stigmatized; whom, as\r\nwe are bound, out of respect to the State sovereignties, to assume they\r\nhad deemed it just and necessary thus to stigmatize, and upon whom they\r\nhad impressed such deep and enduring marks of inferiority and\r\ndegradation; or that when they met in convention to form the\r\nConstitution, they looked upon them as a portion of their constituents,\r\nor designed to include them in the provisions so carefully inserted for\r\nthe security and protection of the liberties and rights of their\r\ncitizens. It cannot be supposed that they intended to secure to them\r\nrights, and privileges, and rank, in the new political body throughout\r\nthe Union, which every one of them denied within the limits of its own\r\ndominion. More especially, it can not be believed that the large\r\nslaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens, or\r\nwould have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to\r\nreceive them in that character from another State. For if they were so\r\nreceived, and entitled to the privileges and immunities to citizens, it\r\nwould exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the\r\npolice regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own\r\nsafety. It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognized\r\nas citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every\r\nother State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass\r\nor passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they\r\npleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night\r\nwithout molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for\r\nwhich a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full\r\nliberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which\r\nits own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political\r\naffairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went. And all of this\r\nwould be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both\r\nfree and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination\r\namong them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, it would seem, to believe that the great men of the\r\nslaveholding States, who took so large a share in framing the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and exercised so much influence in\r\nprocuring its adoption, could have been so forgetful or regardless of\r\ntheir own safety and the safety of those who trusted and confided in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBesides, this want of foresight and care would have been utterly\r\ninconsistent with the caution displayed in providing for the admission\r\nof new members into this political family. For, when they gave to the\r\ncitizens of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens in the\r\nseveral States, they at the same time took from the several States the\r\npower of naturalization, and confined that power exclusively to the\r\nFederal Government. No State was willing to permit another State to\r\ndetermine who should or should not be admitted as one of its citizens,\r\nand entitled to demand equal rights and privileges with their own\r\npeople, within their own territories. The right of naturalization was\r\ntherefore, with one accord, surrendered by the States, and confided to\r\nthe Federal Government. And this power granted to Congress to establish\r\nan uniform rule of _naturalization_ is, by the well understood meaning\r\nof the word, confined to persons born in a foreign country, under a\r\nforeign Government. It is not a power to raise to the rank of a citizen\r\nany one born in the United States, who, from birth or parentage, by the\r\nlaws of the country, belongs to an inferior and subordinate class. And\r\nwhen we find the States guarding themselves from the indiscreet or\r\nimproper admission by other States of emigrants from other countries, by\r\ngiving the power exclusively to Congress, we can not fail to see that\r\nthey could never have left with the States a much more important\r\npower--that is, the power of transforming into citizens a numerous class\r\nof persons, who in that character would be much more dangerous to the\r\npeace and safety of a large portion of the Union, than the few\r\nforeigners one of the States might improperly naturalize\r\n\r\nThe Constitution upon its adoption obviously took from the States all\r\npower by any subsequent legislation to introduce as a citizen into the\r\npolitical family of the United States any one, no matter where he was\r\nborn, or what might be his character or condition; and it gave to\r\nCongress the power to confer this character upon those only who were\r\nborn outside of the dominions of the United States. And no law of a\r\nState, therefore, passed since the Constitution was adopted, can give\r\nany right of citizenship outside of its own territory.\r\n\r\nA clause similar to the one in the Constitution, in relation to the\r\nrights and immunities of citizens of one State in the other States, was\r\ncontained in the articles of Confederation. But there is a difference of\r\nlanguage, which is worthy of note. The provision in the Articles of\r\nConfederation was \"that the _free inhabitants_ of each of the States,\r\npaupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice, excepted, should be\r\nentitled to all the privileges and immunities of free citizens in the\r\nseveral States.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that under this Confederation, each State had the\r\nright to decide for itself, and in its own tribunals, whom it would\r\nacknowledge as a free inhabitant of another State. The term _free\r\ninhabitant_, in the generality of its terms, would certainly include one\r\nof the African race who had been manumitted. But no example, we think,\r\ncan be found of his admission to all the privileges of citizenship in\r\nany State of the Union after these articles were formed, and while they\r\ncontinued in force. And, notwithstanding the generality of the words\r\n\"free inhabitants,\" it is very clear that, according to their accepted\r\nmeaning in that day, they did not include the African race, whether free\r\nor not: for the fifth section of the ninth article provides that\r\nCongress should have the power \"to agree upon the number of land forces\r\nto be raised, and to make requisitions from each State for its quota in\r\nproportion to the number of _white_ inhabitants in such State, which\r\nrequisition should be binding.\"\r\n\r\nWords could hardly have been used which more strongly mark the line of\r\ndistinction between the citizen and the subject; the free and the\r\nsubjugated races. The latter were not even counted when the inhabitants\r\nof a State were to be embodied in proportion to its numbers for the\r\ngeneral defense. And it can not for a moment be supposed, that a class\r\nof persons thus separated and rejected from those who formed the\r\nsovereignty of the States, were yet intended to be included under the\r\nwords \"free inhabitants,\" in the preceding article, to whom privileges\r\nand immunities were so carefully secured in every State.\r\n\r\nBut although this clause of the articles of Confederation is the same in\r\nprinciple with that inserted in the Constitution, yet the comprehensive\r\nword _inhabitant_, which might be construed to include an emancipated\r\nslave, is omitted; and the privilege is confined to _citizens_ of the\r\nState. And this alteration in words would hardly have been made, unless\r\na different meaning was intended to be conveyed, or a possible doubt\r\nremoved. The just and fair inference is, that as this privilege was\r\nabout to be placed under the protection of the General Government, and\r\nthe words expounded by its tribunals, and all power in relation to it\r\ntaken from the State and its courts, it was deemed prudent to describe\r\nwith precision and caution the persons to whom this high privilege was\r\ngiven--and the word _citizen_ was on that account substituted for the\r\nwords _free inhabitant_. The word citizen excluded, and no doubt\r\nintended to exclude, foreigners who had not become citizens of some one\r\nof the States when the Constitution was adopted; and also every\r\ndescription of persons who were not fully recognized as citizens in the\r\nseveral States. This, upon any fair construction of the instruments to\r\nwhich we have referred, was evidently the object and purpose of this\r\nchange of words.\r\n\r\nTo all this mass of proof we have still to add, that Congress has\r\nrepeatedly legislated upon the same construction of the Constitution\r\nthat we have given. Three laws, two of which were passed almost\r\nimmediately after the Government went into operation, will be abundantly\r\nsufficient to show this. The two first are particularly worthy of\r\nnotice, because many of the men who assisted in framing the\r\nConstitution, and took an active part in procuring its adoption, were\r\nthen in the halls of legislation, and certainly understood what they\r\nmeant when they used the words \"people of the United States\" and\r\n\"citizen\" in that well-considered instrument.\r\n\r\nThe first of these acts is the naturalization law, which was passed at\r\nthe second session of the first Congress, March 26, 1790, and confines\r\nthe right of becoming citizens \"_to aliens being free white persons_.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the Constitution does not limit the power of Congress in this\r\nrespect to white persons. And they may, if they think proper, authorize\r\nthe naturalization of any one of any color, who was born under\r\nallegiance to another Government. But the language of the law above\r\nquoted, shows that citizenship at that time was perfectly understood to\r\nbe confined to the white race; and that they alone constituted the\r\nsovereignty in the Government.\r\n\r\nCongress might, as we before said, have authorized the naturalization of\r\nIndians, because they were aliens and foreigners. But, in their then\r\nuntutored and savage state, no one would have thought of admitting them\r\nas citizens in a civilized community. And, moreover, the atrocities they\r\nhad but recently committed, when they were the allies of Great Britain\r\nin the Revolutionary war, were yet fresh in the recollection of the\r\npeople of the United States, and they were even then guarding themselves\r\nagainst the threatened renewal of Indian hostilities. No one supposed\r\nthen that any Indian would ask for, or was capable of enjoying the\r\nprivileges of an American citizen, and the word white was not used with\r\nany particular reference to them.\r\n\r\nNeither was it used with any reference to the African race imported into\r\nor born in this country; because Congress had no power to naturalize\r\nthem, and therefore there was no necessity for using particular words to\r\nexclude them.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to have been used merely because it followed out the line\r\nof division which the Constitution has drawn between the citizen race,\r\nwho formed and held the Government, and the African race, which they\r\nheld in subjection and slavery, and governed at their own pleasure.\r\n\r\nAnother of the early laws of which we have spoken, is the first militia\r\nlaw, which was passed in 1792, at the first session of the second\r\nCongress. The language of this law is equally plain and significant\r\nwith the one just mentioned. It directs that every \"free able-bodied\r\nwhite male citizen\" shall be enrolled in the militia. The word _white_\r\nis evidently used to exclude the African race, and the word \"citizen\" to\r\nexclude unnaturalized foreigners; the latter forming no part of the\r\nsovereignty, owing it no allegiance, and therefore under no obligation\r\nto defend it. The African race, however, born in the country, did owe\r\nallegiance to the Government, whether they were slaves or free; but it\r\nis repudiated, and rejected from the duties and obligations of\r\ncitizenship in marked language.\r\n\r\nThe third act to which we have alluded is even still more decisive; it\r\nwas passed as late as 1813, (2 Stat., 809,) and it provides: \"that from\r\nand after the termination of the war in which the United States are now\r\nengaged with Great Britain, it shall not be lawful to employ, on board\r\nof any public or private vessels of the United States, any person or\r\npersons except citizens of the United States, _or_ persons of color,\r\nnatives of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHere the line of distinction is drawn in express words. Persons of\r\ncolor, in the judgment of Congress, were not included in the word\r\ncitizens, and they are described as another and different class of\r\npersons, and authorized to be employed, if born in the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd even as late as 1820, (chap. civ, sec. 8,) in the charter to the\r\ncity of Washington, the corporation is authorized \"to restrain and\r\nprohibit the nightly and other disorderly meetings of slaves, free\r\nnegroes, and mulattoes,\" thus associating them together in its\r\nlegislation; and after prescribing the punishment that may be inflicted\r\non the slaves, proceeds in the following words: \"And to punish such free\r\nnegroes and mulattoes by penalties not exceeding twenty dollars for any\r\none offense; and in case of the inability of any such free negro or\r\nmulatto to pay any such penalty and cost thereon, to cause him or her to\r\nbe confined to labor for any time not exceeding six calendar months.\"\r\nAnd in a subsequent part of the same section, the act authorizes the\r\ncorporation \"to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which free\r\nnegroes and mulattoes may reside in the city.\"\r\n\r\nThis law, like the laws of the States, shows that this class of persons\r\nwere governed by special legislation directed expressly to them, and\r\nalways connected with provisions for the government of slaves, and not\r\nwith those for the government of free white citizens. And after such an\r\nuniform course of legislation as we have stated; by the colonies, by the\r\nStates, and by Congress, running through a period of more than a\r\ncentury, it would seem that to call persons thus marked and stigmatized,\r\n\"citizens\" of the United States, \"fellow-citizens,\" a constituent part\r\nof the sovereignty, would be an abuse of terms, and not calculated to\r\nexalt the character of an American citizen in the eyes of other nations.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Executive Department of the Government has been in\r\nperfect harmony upon this subject with this course of legislation. The\r\nquestion was brought officially before the late William Wirt, when he\r\nwas Attorney General of the United States, in 1821, and he decided that\r\nthe words \"citizens of the United States\" were used in the acts of\r\nCongress in the same sense as in the Constitution; and that free persons\r\nof color were not citizens, within the meaning of the Constitution and\r\nlaws; and this opinion has been confirmed by that of the late Attorney\r\nGeneral, Caleb Cushing, in a recent case, and acted upon by the\r\nSecretary of State, who refused to grant passports to them as \"citizens\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is said that a person may be a citizen, and entitled to that\r\ncharacter, although he does not possess all the rights which may belong\r\nto other citizens; as, for example, the right to vote, or to hold\r\nparticular offices; and that yet, when he goes into another State, he is\r\nentitled to be recognized there as a citizen, although the State may\r\nmeasure his rights by the rights which it allows to persons of a like\r\ncharacter or class resident in the State, and refuse to him the full\r\nrights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThis argument overlooks the language of the provision in the\r\nConstitution of which we are speaking.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, a person may be a citizen, that is, a member of the\r\ncommunity who form the sovereignty, although he exercises no share of\r\nthe political power, and is incapacitated from holding particular\r\noffice. Women and minors, who form a part of the political family, can\r\nnot vote; and when a property qualification is required to vote or hold\r\na particular office, those who have not the necessary qualification can\r\nnot vote or hold the office, yet they are citizens.\r\n\r\nSo, too, a person may be entitled to vote by the law of the State, who\r\nis not a citizen even of the State itself. And in some of the States of\r\nthe Union foreigners not naturalized are allowed to vote. And the State\r\nmay give the right to free negroes and mulattoes, but that does not make\r\nthem citizens of the State, and still less of the United States. And the\r\nprovision in the Constitution giving privileges and immunities in other\r\nStates, does not apply to them.\r\n\r\nNeither does it apply to a person who, being the citizen of a State,\r\nmigrates to another State. For then he becomes subject to the laws of\r\nthe State in which he lives, and he is no longer a citizen of the State\r\nfrom which he removed. And the State in which he resides may then,\r\nunquestionably, determine his _status_ or condition, and place him among\r\nthe class of persons who are not recognized as citizens, but belong to\r\nan inferior and subject race; and may deny him the privileges and\r\nimmunities enjoyed by its citizens.\r\n\r\nBut so far as mere rights of persons are concerned, the provision in\r\nquestion is confined to citizens of a State who are temporarily in\r\nanother State without taking up their residence there. It gives them no\r\npolitical rights in the State, as to voting or holding office, or in any\r\nother respect. For a citizen of one State has no right to participate in\r\nthe government of another. But if he ranks as a citizen in the State to\r\nwhich he belongs, within the meaning of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, then, whenever he goes into another State, the Constitution\r\nclothes him, as to the rights of person, with all the privileges and\r\nimmunities which belong to citizens of the State. And if persons of the\r\nAfrican race are citizens of a State, and of the United States, they\r\nwould be entitled to all these privileges and immunities in every State,\r\nand the State could not restrict them; for they would hold these\r\nprivileges and immunities under the paramount authority of the Federal\r\nGovernment, and its courts would be bound to maintain and enforce them,\r\nthe Constitution and laws of the State to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\nAnd if the States could limit or restrict them, or place the party in an\r\ninferior grade, this clause of the Constitution would be unmeaning, and\r\ncould have no operation; and would give no rights to the citizen when in\r\nanother State. He would have none but what the State itself chose to\r\nallow him. This is evidently not the construction or meaning of the\r\nclause in question. It guaranties rights, to the citizen, and the State\r\ncan not withhold them. And these rights are of a character and would\r\nlead to consequences which make it absolutely certain that the African\r\nrace were not included under the name of citizens of a State, and were\r\nnot in the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution when these\r\nprivileges and immunities were provided for the protection of the\r\ncitizen in other States.\r\n\r\nThe case of Legrand _v._ Darnall (2 Peters, 664) has been referred to\r\nfor the purpose of showing that this court has decided that the\r\ndescendant of a slave may sue as a citizen in a court of the United\r\nStates; but the case itself shows that the question did not arise and\r\ncould not have arisen in the case.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report, that Darnell was born in Maryland, and was\r\nthe son of a white man by one of his slaves, and his father executed\r\ncertain instruments to manumit him, and devised to him some landed\r\nproperty in the State. This property Darnall afterward sold to Legrand,\r\nthe appellant, who gave his notes for the purchase-money. But becoming\r\nafterward apprehensive that the appellee had not been emancipated\r\naccording to the laws of Maryland, he refused to pay the notes until he\r\ncould be better satisfied as to Darnell's right to convey. Darnall, in\r\nthe mean time, had taken up his residence in Pennsylvania, and brought\r\nsuit on the notes, and recovered judgment in the Circuit Court for the\r\ndistrict of Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe whole proceeding, as appears by the report, was an amicable one;\r\nLegrand being perfectly willing to pay the money, if he could obtain a\r\ntitle, and Darnall not wishing him to pay unless he could make him a\r\ngood one. In point of fact, the whole proceeding was under the direction\r\nof the counsel who argued the case for the appellee, who was the mutual\r\nfriend of the parties, and confided in by both of them, and whose only\r\nobject was to have the rights of both parties established by judicial\r\ndecision in the most speedy and least expensive manner.\r\n\r\nLegrand, therefore, raised no objection to the jurisdiction of the court\r\nin the suit at law, because he was himself anxious to obtain the\r\njudgment of the court upon his title. Consequently, there was nothing in\r\nthe record before the court to show that Darnall was of African descent,\r\nand the usual judgment and award of execution was entered. And Legrand\r\nthereupon filed his bill on the equity side of the Circuit Court,\r\nstating that Darnall was born a slave, and had not been legally\r\nemancipated, and could not therefore take the land devised to him, nor\r\nmake Legrand a good title; and praying an injunction to restrain Darnall\r\nfrom proceeding to execution on the judgment, which was granted.\r\nDarnall answered, averring in his answer that he was a free man, and\r\ncapable of conveying a good title. Testimony was taken on this point,\r\nand at the hearing the Circuit Court was of opinion that Darnall was a\r\nfree man and his title good, and dissolved the injunction and dismissed\r\nthe bill; and that decree was affirmed here, upon the appeal of Legrand.\r\n\r\nNow, it is difficult to imagine how any question about the citizenship\r\nof Darnall, or his right to sue in that character, can be supposed to\r\nhave risen or been decided in that case. The fact that he was of African\r\ndescent was first brought before the court upon the bill in equity. The\r\nsuit at law had then passed into judgment and award of execution, and\r\nthe Circuit Court, as a court of law, had no longer any authority over\r\nit. It was a valid and legal judgment, which the court that rendered it\r\nhad not the power to reverse or set aside. And unless it had\r\njurisdiction as a court of equity to restrain him from using its process\r\nas a court of law, Darnall, if he thought proper, would have been at\r\nliberty to proceed on his judgment, and compel the payment of the money,\r\nalthough the allegations in the bill were true, and he was incapable of\r\nmaking a title. No other court could have enjoined him, for certainly no\r\nState equity court could interfere in that way with the judgment of a\r\nCircuit Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut the Circuit Court as a court of equity certainly had equity\r\njurisdiction over its own judgment as a court of law, without regard to\r\nthe character of the parties; and had not only the right, but it was its\r\nduty--no matter who were the parties in the judgment--to prevent them\r\nfrom proceeding to enforce it by execution, if the court was satisfied\r\nthat the money was not justly and equitably due. The ability of Darnall\r\nto convey did not depend upon his citizenship, but upon his title to\r\nfreedon. And if he was free, he could hold and convey property, by the\r\nlaws of Maryland, although he was not a citizen. But if he was by law\r\nstill a slave, he could not. It was therefore the duty of the court,\r\nsitting as a court of equity in the latter case, to prevent him from\r\nusing its process, as a court of common law, to compel the payment of\r\nthe purchase-money, when it was evident that the purchaser must lose the\r\nland. But if he was free and could make a title, it was equally the duty\r\nof the court not to suffer Legrand to keep the land, and refuse the\r\npayment of the money, upon the ground that Darnall was incapable of\r\nsuing or being sued as a citizen in a court of the United States. The\r\ncharacter or citizenship of the parties had no connection with the\r\nquestion of jurisdiction, and the matter in dispute had no relation to\r\nthe citizenship of Darnall. Nor is such a question alluded to in the\r\nopinion of the Court.\r\n\r\nBeside, we are by no means prepared to say that there are not many\r\ncases, civil as well as criminal, in which a Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates may exercise jurisdiction, although one of the African race is a\r\nparty; that broad question is not before the court. The question with\r\nwhich we are now dealing is, whether a person of the African race can be\r\na citizen of the United States, and become thereby entitled to a special\r\nprivilege, by virtue of his title to that character, and which, under\r\nthe Constitution, no one but a citizen can claim. It is manifest that\r\nthe case of Legrand and Darnall has no bearing on that question, and can\r\nhave no application to the case now before the court.\r\n\r\nThis case, however, strikingly illustrates the consequences that would\r\nfollow the construction of the Constitution which would give the power\r\ncontended for to a State. It would in effect give it also to an\r\nindividual. For if the father of young Darnall had manumitted him in his\r\nlifetime, and sent him to reside in a State which recognized him as a\r\ncitizen, he might have visited and sojourned in Maryland when he\r\npleased, and as long as he pleased, as a citizen of the United States;\r\nand the State officers and tribunals would be compelled, by the\r\nparamount authority of the Constitution, to receive him and treat him as\r\none of its citizens, exempt from the laws and police of the State in\r\nrelation to a person of that description, and allow him to enjoy all the\r\nrights and privileges of citizenship without respect to the laws of\r\nMaryland, although such laws were deemed by it absolutely essential to\r\nits own safety.\r\n\r\nThe only two provisions which point to them and include them, treat them\r\nas property, and make it the duty of the Government to protect it; no\r\nother power, in relation to this race, is to be found in the\r\nConstitution; and as it is a Government of special, delegated, powers,\r\nno authority beyond these two provisions can be constitutionally\r\nexercised. The Government of the United States had no right to interfere\r\nfor any other purpose but that of protecting the rights of the owner,\r\nleaving it altogether with the several States to deal with this race,\r\nwhether emancipated or not, as each State may think justice, humanity,\r\nand the interests and safety of society, require. The States evidently\r\nintended to reserve this power exclusively to themselves.\r\n\r\nNo one, we presume, supposes that any change in public opinion or\r\nfeeling, in relation to this unfortunate race, in the civilized nations\r\nof Europe or in this country, should induce the court to give to the\r\nwords of the Constitution a more liberal construction in their favor\r\nthan they were intended to bear when the instrument was framed and\r\nadopted. Such an argument would be altogether inadmissible in any\r\ntribunal called on to interpret it. If any of its provisions are deemed\r\nunjust, there is a mode prescribed in the instrument itself, by which it\r\nmay be amended; but while it remains unaltered, it must be construed now\r\nas it was understood at the time of its adoption. It is not only the\r\nsame in words, but the same in meaning, and delegates the same powers to\r\nthe Government, and reserves and secures the same rights and privileges\r\nto citizens; and as long as it continues to exist in its present form,\r\nit speaks not only in the same words, but with the same meaning and\r\nintent with which it spoke when it came from the hands of its framers,\r\nand was voted on and adopted by the people of the United States. Any\r\nother rule of construction would abrogate the judicial character of this\r\ncourt, and make it the mere reflex of the popular opinion or passion of\r\nthe day. This court was not created by the Constitution for such\r\npurposes. Higher and graver trusts have been confided to it, and it must\r\nnot falter in the path of duty.\r\n\r\nWhat the construction was at that time, we think can hardly admit of\r\ndoubt. We have the language of the Declaration of Independence and of\r\nthe Articles of Confederation, in addition to the plain words of the\r\nConstitution itself; we have the legislation of the different States,\r\nbefore, about the time, and since, the Constitution was adopted; we have\r\nthe legislation of Congress, from the time of its adoption to a recent\r\nperiod; and we have the constant and uniform action of the Executive\r\nDepartment, all concurring together, and leading to the same result. And\r\nif any thing in relation to the construction of the Constitution can be\r\nregarded as settled, it is that which we now give to the word \"citizen\"\r\nand the word \"people.\"\r\n\r\nAnd upon a full and careful consideration of the subject, the court is\r\nof opinion, that, upon the facts stated in the plea in abatement, Dred\r\nScott was not a citizen of Missouri within the meaning of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and not entitled as such to sue in\r\nits courts; and, consequently, that the Circuit Court had no\r\njurisdiction of the case, and that the judgment on the plea in abatement\r\nis erroneous.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that doubts are entertained by some of the members of the\r\ncourt, whether the plea in abatement is legally before the court upon\r\nthis writ of error: but if that plea is regarded as waived, or out of\r\nthe case upon any other ground, yet the question as to the jurisdiction\r\nof the Circuit Court is presented on the face of the bill of exception\r\nitself, taken by the plaintiff at the trial; for he admits that he and\r\nhis wife were born slaves, but endeavors to make out his title to\r\nfreedom and citizenship by showing that they were taken by their owner\r\nto certain places, hereinafter mentioned, where slavery could not by law\r\nexist, and that they thereby became free, and upon their return to\r\nMissouri became citizens of that State.\r\n\r\nNow, if the removal, of which he speaks, did not give them their\r\nfreedom, then by his own admission he is still a slave, and whatever\r\nopinions may be entertained in favor of the citizenship of a free person\r\nof the African race, no one supposes that a slave is a citizen of the\r\nState or of the United States. If, therefore, the acts done by his owner\r\ndid not make them free persons, he is still a slave, and certainly\r\nincapable of suing in the character of a citizen.\r\n\r\nThe principle of law is too well settled to be disputed, that a court\r\ncan give no judgment for either party, where it has no jurisdiction; and\r\nif, upon the showing of Scott himself, it appeared that he was still a\r\nslave, the case ought to have been dismissed, and the judgment against\r\nhim and in favor of the defendant for costs, is, like that on the plea\r\nin abatement, erroneous, and the suit ought to have been dismissed by\r\nthe Circuit Court for want of jurisdiction in that court.\r\n\r\nBut, before we proceed to examine this part of the case, it may be\r\nproper to notice an objection taken to the judicial authority of this\r\ncourt to decide it; and it has been said, that as this court has decided\r\nagainst the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court on the plea in abatement,\r\nit has no right to examine any question presented by the exception; and\r\nthat any thing that it may say upon that part of the case will be extra\r\njudicial, and mere orbita dicta.\r\n\r\nThis is a manifest mistake; there can be no doubt as to the jurisdiction\r\nof this court to revise the judgment of a Circuit Court, and to reverse\r\nit for any error apparent on the record, whether it be the error of\r\ngiving judgment in a case over which it had no jurisdiction, or any\r\nother material error; and this, too, whether there is a plea in\r\nabatement or not.\r\n\r\nThe objection appears to have arisen from confounding writs of error to\r\na State court, with writs of error to a Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates. Undoubtedly, upon a writ of error to a State court, unless the\r\nrecord shows a case that gives jurisdiction, the case must be dismissed\r\nfor want of jurisdiction in _this court_. And if it is dismissed on that\r\nground, we have no right to examine and decide upon any question\r\npresented by the bill of exceptions, or any other part of the record.\r\nBut writs of error to a State Court, and to a Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States, are regulated by different laws, and stand upon entirely\r\ndifferent principles. And in a writ of error to a Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States, the whole record is before this court for examination and\r\ndecision; and if the sum in controversy is large enough to give\r\njurisdiction, it is not only the right, but it is the judicial duty of\r\nthe court, to examine the whole case as presented by the record; and if\r\nit appears upon its face that any material error or errors have been\r\ncommitted by the court below, it is the duty of this court to reverse\r\nthe judgment, and remand the case. And certainly an error in passing a\r\njudgment upon the merits in favor of either party, in a case which it\r\nwas not authorized to try, and over which it had no jurisdiction, is as\r\ngrave an error as a court can commit.\r\n\r\nThe plea in abatement is not a plea to the jurisdiction of this court,\r\nbut to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. And it appears by the\r\nrecord before us, that the Circuit Court committed an error, in deciding\r\nthat it had jurisdiction, upon the facts in the case, admitted by the\r\npleadings. It is the duty of the appellate tribunal to correct this\r\nerror; but that could not be done by dismissing the case for want of\r\njurisdiction here--for that would leave the erroneous judgment in full\r\nforce, and the injured party without remedy. And the appellate court\r\ntherefore exercises the power for which alone appellate courts are\r\nconstituted, by reversing the judgment of the court below for this\r\nerror. It exercises its proper and appropriate jurisdiction over the\r\njudgment and proceedings of the Circuit Court, as they appear upon the\r\nrecord brought up by the writ of error.\r\n\r\nThe correction of one error in the court below does not deprive the\r\nappellate court of the power of examining further into the record, and\r\ncorrecting any other material errors which may have been committed by\r\nthe inferior court. There is certainly no rule of law--nor any\r\npractice--nor any decision of a court--which even questions this power\r\nin the appellate tribunal. On the contrary, it is the daily practice of\r\nthis court, and of all appellate courts where they reverse the judgment\r\nof an inferior court for error, to correct by its opinions whatever\r\nerrors may appear on the record material to the case; and they have\r\nalways held it to be their duty to do so where the silence of the court\r\nmight lead to misconstruction or future controversy, and the point has\r\nbeen relied on by either side, and argued before the court.\r\n\r\nIn the case before us, we have already decided that the Circuit Court\r\nerred in deciding that it had jurisdiction upon the facts admitted by\r\nthe pleadings. And it appears that, in the further progress of the case,\r\nit acted upon the erroneous principle it had decided on the pleadings,\r\nand gave judgment for the defendant, where, upon the facts admitted in\r\nthe exception, it had no jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWe are at a loss to understand upon what principle of law, applicable to\r\nappellate jurisdiction, it can be supposed that this court has not\r\njudicial authority to correct the last-mentioned error, because they had\r\nbefore corrected the former; or by what process of reasoning it can be\r\nmade out, that the error of an inferior court in actually pronouncing\r\njudgment for one of the parties, in a case in which it had no\r\njurisdiction, cannot be looked into or corrected by this court, because\r\nwe have decided a similar question presented in the pleadings. The last\r\npoint is distinctly presented by the facts contained in the plaintiff's\r\nown bill of exceptions, which he himself brings here by this writ of\r\nerror. It was the point which chiefly occupied the attention of the\r\ncounsel on both sides in the argument--and the judgment which this court\r\nmust render upon both errors is precisely the same. It must, in each of\r\nthem, exercise jurisdiction over the judgment, and reverse it for the\r\nerrors committed by the court below; and issue a mandate to the Circuit\r\nCourt to conform its judgment to the opinion pronounced by this court,\r\nby dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.\r\nThis is the constant and invariable practice of this court, where it\r\nreverses a judgment for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be necessary to pursue such a question further. The want\r\nof jurisdiction in the court below may appear on the record without any\r\nplea in abatement. This is familiarly the case where a court of chancery\r\nhas exercised jurisdiction in a case where the plaintiff had a plain and\r\nadequate remedy at law, and it so appears by the transcript when brought\r\nhere by appeal. So also where it appears that a court of admiralty has\r\nexercised jurisdiction in a case belonging exclusively to a court of\r\ncommon law. In these cases there is no plea in abatement. And for the\r\nsame reason, and upon the same principles, where the defect of\r\njurisdiction is patent on the record, this court is bound to reverse the\r\njudgment, although the defendant has not pleaded in abatement to the\r\njurisdiction of the inferior court.\r\n\r\nThe cases of Jackson _v._ Ashton and of Capron _v._ Van Noorden, to\r\nwhich we have referred in a previous part of this opinion, are directly\r\nin point. In the last-mentioned case, Capron brought an action against\r\nVan Noorden in a Circuit Court of the United States, without showing, by\r\nthe usual averments of citizenship, that the court had jurisdiction.\r\nThere was no plea in abatement put in, and the parties went to trial\r\nupon the merits. The court gave judgment in favor of the defendant with\r\ncosts. The plaintiff thereupon brought his writ of error, and this court\r\nreversed the judgment given in favor of the defendant, and remanded the\r\ncase with directions to dismiss it, because it did not appear by the\r\ntranscript that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe case before us still more strongly imposes upon this court the duty\r\nof examining whether the court below has not committed an error, in\r\ntaking jurisdiction and giving a judgment for costs in favor of the\r\ndefendant; for in Capron _v._ Van Noorden the judgment was reversed,\r\nbecause it did _not appear_ that the parties were citizens of different\r\nStates. They might or might not be. But in this case it _does appear_\r\nthat the plaintiff was born a slave; and if the facts upon which he\r\nrelies have not made him free, then it appears affirmatively on the\r\nrecord that he is not a citizen, and consequently his suit against\r\nSandford was not a suit between citizens of different States, and the\r\ncourt had no authority to pass any judgment between the parties. The\r\nsuit ought, in this view of it, to have been dismissed by the Circuit\r\nCourt, and its judgment in favor of Sandford is erroneous, and must be\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the result either way, by dismissal or by a judgment for\r\nthe defendant, makes very little, if any, difference in a pecuniary or\r\npersonal point of view to either party. But the fact that the result\r\nwould be very nearly the same to the parties in either form of judgment,\r\nwould not justify this court in sanctioning an error in the judgment\r\nwhich is patent on the record, and which, if sanctioned, might be drawn\r\ninto precedent, and lead to serious mischief and injustice in some\r\nfuture suit.\r\n\r\nWe proceed, therefore, to inquire whether the facts relied on by the\r\nplaintiff entitled him to his freedom.\r\n\r\nThe case, as he himself states it, on the record brought here by his\r\nwrit of error, is this:\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff was a negro slave, belonging to Dr. Emerson, who was a\r\nsurgeon in the army of the United States. In the year 1834, he took the\r\nplaintiff from the State of Missouri to the military post at Rock\r\nIsland, in the State of Illinois, and held him there as a slave until\r\nthe month of April or May, 1836. At the time last-mentioned, said Dr.\r\nEmerson removed the plaintiff from said miltary post at Rock Island to\r\nthe military post at Fort Snelling, situate on the west bank of the\r\nMississippi river, in the territory known as Upper Louisiana, acquired\r\nby the United States of France, and situate north of the latitude of\r\nthirty-six degrees thirty minutes north, and north of the State of\r\nMissouri. Said Dr. Emerson held the plaintiff in slavery at said Fort\r\nSneling, from said last-mentioned date until the year 1838.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1835, Harriet, who is named in the second count of the\r\nplaintiff's declaration, was the negro slave of Major Taliaferro, who\r\nbelonged to the army of the United States. In that year, 1835, said\r\nMajor Taliaferro took said Harriet to said Fort Snelling, a military\r\npost, situated as hereinbefore stated, and kept her there as a slave\r\nuntil the year 1836, and then sold and delivered her as a slave, at said\r\nFort Snelling, unto the said Dr. Emerson hereinbefore named. Said Dr.\r\nEmerson held said Harriet in slavery at said Fort Snelling until the\r\nyear 1838.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836, the plaintiff and Harriet intermarried, at Fort\r\nSnelling, with the consent of Dr. Emerson, who then claimed to be their\r\nmaster and owner. Eliza and Lizzie, named in the third count of the\r\nplaintiff's declaration, are the fruit of that marriage. Eliza is about\r\nfourteen years old, and was born on board the steamboat Gipsey, north of\r\nthe north line of the State of Missouri, and upon the river Mississippi.\r\nLizzie is about seven years old, and was born in the State of Missouri,\r\nat the military post called Jefferson Barracks.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1838, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff and said\r\nHarriet, and their said daughter Eliza, from said Fort Snelling to the\r\nState of Missouri, where they have ever since resided.\r\n\r\nBefore the commencement of this suit, said Dr. Emerson sold and conveyed\r\nthe plaintiff, and Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie, to the defendant, as\r\nslaves, and the defendant has ever since claimed to hold them, and each\r\nof them, as slaves.\r\n\r\nIn considering this part of the controversy, two questions arise: 1. Was\r\nhe, together with his family, free in Missouri by reason of the stay in\r\nthe territory of the United States hereinbefore mentioned? And, 2. If\r\nthey were not, is Scott himself free by reason of his removal to Rock\r\nIsland, in the State of Illinois, as stated in the above admissions?\r\n\r\nWe proceed to examine the first question.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress, upon which the plaintiff relies, declares that\r\nslavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime,\r\nshall be forever prohibited in all that part of the territory ceded by\r\nFrance, under the name of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six\r\ndegrees thirty minutes north latitude, and not included within the\r\nlimits of Missouri. And the difficulty which meets us at the threshold\r\nof this part of the inquiry is, whether Congress was authorized to pass\r\nthis law under any of the powers granted to it by the Constitution; for\r\nif the authority is not given by that instrument, it is the duty of this\r\ncourt to declare it void and inoperative, and incapable of conferring\r\nfreedom upon any one who is held as a slave under the laws of any one of\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the plaintiff has laid much stress upon that article in\r\nthe Constitution which confers on Congress the power \"to dispose of and\r\nmake all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other\r\nproperty belonging to the United States;\" but, in the judgment of the\r\ncourt, that provision has no bearing on the present controversy, and the\r\npower there given, whatever it may be, is confined, and was intended to\r\nbe confined, to the territory which at that time belonged to, or was\r\nclaimed by, the United States, and was within their boundaries as\r\nsettled by the treaty with Great Britain, and can have no influence upon\r\na territory afterward acquired from a foreign Government. It was a\r\nspecial provision for a known and particular territory, and to meet a\r\npresent emergency, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the history of the times, as well as the careful and\r\nmeasured terms in which the article is framed, will show the correctness\r\nof this proposition.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, from the commencement of the Revolutionary\r\nwar, serious difficulties existed between the States, in relation to the\r\ndisposition of large and unsettled territories which were included in\r\nthe chartered limits of some of the States. And some of the other\r\nStates, and more especially Maryland, which had no unsettled lands,\r\ninsisted that as the unoccupied lands, if wrested from Great Britain,\r\nwould owe their preservation to the common purse and the common sword,\r\nthe money arising from them ought to be applied in just proportion among\r\nthe several States to pay the expenses of the war, and ought not to be\r\nappropriated to the use of the State in whose chartered limits they\r\nmight happen to lie, to the exclusion of the other States, by whose\r\ncombined efforts and common expense the territory was defended and\r\npreserved against the claim of the British Government.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties caused much uneasiness during the war, while the\r\nissue was in some degree doubtful, and the future boundaries of the\r\nUnited States yet to be defined by treaty, if we achieved our\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Congress of the Confederation obviously concurred in\r\nopinion with the State of Maryland, and desired to obtain from the\r\nStates which claimed it a cession of this territory, in order that\r\nCongress might raise money on this security to carry on the war. This\r\nappears by the resolution passed on the 6th of September, 1780, strongly\r\nurging the States to cede these lands to the United States, both for the\r\nsake of peace and union among themselves, and to maintain the public\r\ncredit; and this was followed by the resolution of October 10th, 1780,\r\nby which Congress pledged itself, that if the lands were ceded, as\r\nrecommended by the resolution above mentioned, they should be disposed\r\nof for the common benefit of the United States, and be settled and\r\nformed into distinct republican States, which should become members of\r\nthe Federal Union, and have the same rights of sovereignty, and freedom,\r\nand independence, as other States.\r\n\r\nBut these difficulties became much more serious after peace took place,\r\nand the boundaries of the United States were established. Every State,\r\nat that time, felt severely the pressure of its war debt; but in\r\nVirginia, and some other States, there were large territories of\r\nunsettled lands, the sale of which would enable them to discharge their\r\nobligations without much inconvenience while other States, which had no\r\nsuch resource, saw before them many years of heavy and burdensome\r\ntaxation; and the latter insisted, for the reasons before stated, that\r\nthese unsettled lands should be treated as the common property of the\r\nStates, and the proceeds applied to their common benefit.\r\n\r\nThe letters from the statesmen of that day will show how much this\r\ncontroversy occupied their thoughts, and the dangers that were\r\napprehended from it. It was the disturbing element of the time, and\r\nfears were entertained that it might dissolve the Confederation by which\r\nthe States were then united.\r\n\r\nThese fears and dangers were, however, at once removed, when the State\r\nof Virginia, in 1784, voluntarily ceded to the United States the immense\r\ntract of country lying northwest of the river Ohio, and which was within\r\nthe acknowledged limits of the State. The only object of the State, in\r\nmaking this cession, was to put an end to the threatening and exciting\r\ncontroversy, and to enable the Congress of that time to dispose of the\r\nlands, and appropriate the proceeds as a common fund for the common\r\nbenefit of the States. It was not ceded because it was inconvenient to\r\nthe State to hold and govern it, nor from any expectation that it could\r\nbe better or more conveniently governed by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe example of Virginia was soon afterward followed by other States,\r\nand, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, all of the States\r\nsimilarly situated, had ceded their unappropriated lands, except North\r\nCarolina and Georgia. The main object for which the cessions were\r\ndesired and made, was on account of their money value, and to put an end\r\nto a dangerous controversy, as to who was justly entitled to the\r\nproceeds when the land should be sold. It is necessary to bring this\r\npart of the history of these cessions thus distinctly into view, because\r\nit will enable us the better to comprehend the phraseology of the\r\narticle in the Constitution, so often referred to in the argument.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the powers of sovereignty and the eminent domain were ceded\r\nwith the land. This was essential, in order to make it effectual, and to\r\naccomplish its objects. But it must be remembered that, at that time,\r\nthere was no Government of the United States in existence with\r\nenumerated and limited powers; what was then called the United States,\r\nwere thirteen separate, sovereign, independent States, which had entered\r\ninto a league or confederation for their mutual protection and\r\nadvantage, and the Congress of the United States was composed of the\r\nrepresentatives of these separate sovereignties, meeting together, as\r\nequals, to discuss and decide on certain measures which the States, by\r\nthe Articles of Confederation, had agreed to submit to their decision.\r\nBut this Confederation had none of the attributes of sovereignty in\r\nlegislative, executive, or judicial power. It was little more than a\r\ncongress of ambassadors, authorized to represent separate nations, in\r\nmatters in which they had a common concern.\r\n\r\nIt was this congress that accepted the cession from Virginia. They had\r\nno power to accept it under the Articles of Confederation. But they had\r\nan undoubted right, as independent sovereignties, to accept any cession\r\nof territory for their common benefit, which all of them assented to;\r\nand it is equally clear, that as their common property, and having no\r\nsuperior to control them, they had the right to exercise absolute\r\ndominion over it, subject only to the restrictions which Virginia had\r\nimposed in her act of cession. There was, at we have said, no Government\r\nof the United States then in existence with special enumerated and\r\nlimited powers. The territory belonged to sovereignties, who, subject to\r\nthe limitations above mentioned, had a right to establish any form of\r\nGovernment they pleased, by compact or treaty among themselves, and to\r\nregulate rights of person and rights of property in the territory, as\r\nthey might deem proper. It was by a Congress, representing the authority\r\nof these several and separate sovereignties, and acting under their\r\nauthority and command (but not from any authority derived from the\r\nArticles of Confederation,) that the instrument usually called the\r\nordinance of 1787 was adopted; regulating in much detail the principles\r\nand the laws by which this territory should be governed; and among other\r\nprovisions, slavery is prohibited in it. We do not question the power of\r\nthe States, by agreement among themselves, to pass this ordinance, nor\r\nits obligatory force in the territory, while the confederation or league\r\nof the States in their separate sovereign character continued to exist.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things when the Constitution of the United States\r\nwas formed. The territory ceded by Virginia, belonged to the several\r\nconfederated States as common property, and they had united in\r\nestablishing in it a system of government and jurisprudence, in order to\r\nprepare it for admission as States, according to the terms of cession.\r\nThey were about to dissolve this federative Union, and to surrender a\r\nportion of their independent sovereignty to a new Government, which, for\r\ncertain purposes, would make the people of the several States one\r\npeople, and which was to be supreme and controlling, within its sphere\r\nof action throughout the United States; but this Government was to be\r\ncarefully limited in its powers, and to exercise no authority beyond\r\nthose expressly granted by the Constitution, or necessarily to be\r\nimplied from the language of the instrument, and the objects it was\r\nintended to accomplish; and as this league of States would, upon the\r\nadoption of the new Government, cease to have any power over the\r\nterritory, and the ordinance they had agreed upon be incapable of\r\nexecution and a mere nullity, it was obvious that some provision was\r\nnecessary to give the new Government sufficient power to enable it to\r\ncarry into effect the objects for which it was ceded, and the compacts\r\nand agreements which the States had made with each other in the exercise\r\nof their powers of sovereignty. It was necessary that the lands should\r\nbe sold to pay the war debt; that a Government and system of\r\njurisprudence should be maintained in it, to protect the citizens of the\r\nUnited States who should migrate to the territory, in their rights of\r\nperson and of property. It was also necessary that the new Government,\r\nabout to be adopted, should be authorized to maintain the claim of the\r\nUnited States to the unappropriated lands of North Carolina and Georgia,\r\nwhich had not then been ceded, but the cession of which was confidently\r\nanticipated upon some terms that would be arranged between the General\r\nGovernment and these two States. And, moreover, there were many articles\r\nof value besides this property in land, such as arms, military stores,\r\nmunitions, and ships of war, which were the common property of the\r\nStates, when acting in their independent characters as confederates,\r\nwhich neither the new Government nor any one else would have a right to\r\ntake possession of, or control, without authority from them; and it was\r\nto place these things under the guardianship and protection of the new\r\nGovernment, and to clothe it with the necessary powers, that the clause\r\nwas inserted in the Constitution which gives Congress the power \"to\r\ndispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the\r\nterritory or other property belonging to the United States.\" It was\r\nintended for a specific purpose, to provide for the things we have\r\nmentioned. It was to transfer to the new Government the property then\r\nheld in common by the States, and to give to that Government power to\r\napply it to the objects for which it had been destined by mutual\r\nagreement among the States before their league was dissolved. It applied\r\nonly to the property which the States held in common at that time, and\r\nhas no reference whatever to any territory or other property which the\r\nnew sovereignty might afterward itself acquire.\r\n\r\nThe language used in the clause, the arrangement and combination of the\r\npowers, and the somewhat unusual phraseology it uses, when it speaks of\r\nthe political power to be exercised in the government of the territory,\r\nall indicate the design and meaning of the clause to be such as we have\r\nmentioned. It does not speak of _any_ territory, nor of _Territories_,\r\nbut uses language which, according to its legitimate meaning, points to\r\na particular thing. The power is given in relation only to _the_\r\nterritory of the United States--that is, to a territory then in\r\nexistence, and then known or claimed as the territory of the United\r\nStates. It begins its enumeration of powers by that of disposing, in\r\nother words, making sale of the lands, or raising money from them,\r\nwhich, as we have already said, was the main object of the cession, and\r\nwhich is accordingly the first thing provided for in the article. It\r\nthen gives the power which was necessarily associated with the\r\ndisposition and sale of the lands--that is, the power of making needful\r\nrules and regulations respecting the territory. And whatever\r\nconstruction may now be given to these words, every one, we think, must\r\nadmit that they are not the words usually employed by statesmen in\r\ngiving supreme power of legislation. They are certainly very unlike the\r\nwords used in the power granted to legislate over territory which the\r\nnew Government might afterwards itself obtain by cession from a State,\r\neither for its seat of Government, or for forts, magazines, arsenals,\r\ndock yards, and other needful buildings. And the same power of making\r\nneedful rules respecting the territory is, in precisely the same\r\nlanguage, applied to the _other_ property belonging to the United\r\nStates--associating the power over the territory in this respect with\r\nthe power over movable or personal property--that is, the ships, arms,\r\nand munitions of war, which then belonged in common to the State\r\nsovereignties. And it will hardly be said, that this power, in relation\r\nto the last-mentioned objects, was deemed necessary to be thus specially\r\ngiven to the new Government, in order to authorize it to make needful\r\nrules and regulations respecting the ships it might itself build, or\r\narms and munitions of war it might itself manufacture or provide for the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nNo one, it is believed, would think a moment of deriving the power of\r\nCongress to make needful rules and regulations in relation to property\r\nof this kind from this clause of the Constitution. Nor can it, upon any\r\nfair construction, be applied to any property, but that which the new\r\nGovernment was about to receive from the confederated States. And if\r\nthis be true as to this property, it must be equally true and limited as\r\nto the territory, which is so carefully and precisely coupled with\r\nit--and like it referred to as property in the power granted. The\r\nconcluding words of the clause appear to render this construction\r\nirresistible; for, after the provisions we have mentioned, it proceeds\r\nto say, \"that nothing in the Constitution shall be so construed as to\r\nprejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular State.\"\r\n\r\nNow, as we have before said, all of the States, except North Carolina\r\nand Georgia, had made the cession before the Constitution was adopted,\r\naccording to the resolution of Congress of October 10, 1780. The claims\r\nof other States, that the unappropriated lands in these two States\r\nshould be applied to the common benefit, in like manner, was still\r\ninsisted on, but refused by the States. And this member of the clause in\r\nquestion evidently applies to them, and can apply to nothing else. It\r\nwas to exclude the conclusion that either party, by adopting the\r\nConstitution, would surrender what they deem their rights. And when the\r\nlatter provision relates so obviously to the unappropriated lands not\r\nyet ceded by the States, and the first clause makes provision for those\r\nthen actually ceded, it is impossible, by any just rule of construction,\r\nto make the first provision general, and extend to all territories,\r\nwhich the Federal Goverenment might in any way afterwards acquire, when\r\nthe latter is plainly and unequivocally confined to a particular\r\nterritory; which was a part of the same controversy, and involved in the\r\nsame dispute, and depended upon the same principles. The union of the\r\ntwo provisions in the same clause shows that they were kindred subjects;\r\nand that the whole clause is local, and relates only to lands, within\r\nthe limits of the United States, which had been or then were claimed by\r\na State; and that no other territory was in the mind of the framers of\r\nthe Constitution, or intended to be embraced in it. Upon any other\r\nconstruction it would be impossible to account for the insertion of the\r\nlast provision in the place where it is found, or to comprehend why, or\r\nfor what object, it was associated with the previous provision.\r\n\r\nThis view of the subject is confirmed by the manner in which the present\r\nGovernment of the United States dealt with the subject as soon as it\r\ncame into existence. It must be borne in mind that the same States that\r\nformed the Confederation also formed and adopted the new Government, to\r\nwhich so large a portion of their former sovereign powers were\r\nsurrendered. It must also be borne in mind that all of these same States\r\nwhich had then ratified the new Constitution were represented in the\r\nCongress which passed the first law for the government of this\r\nterritory; and many of the members of that legislative body had been\r\ndeputies from the States under the confederation--had united in adopting\r\nthe ordinance of 1787, and assisted in forming the new Government under\r\nwhich they were then acting, and whose powers they were then exercising.\r\nAnd it is obvious from the law they passed to carry into effect the\r\nprinciples and provisions of the ordinance, that they regarded it as the\r\nact of the States done in the exercise of their legitimate powers at the\r\ntime. The new Government took the territory as it found it, and in the\r\ncondition in which it was transferred, and did not attempt to undo any\r\nthing that that had been done. And, among the earliest laws passed under\r\nthe new Government, is one reviving the ordinance of 1787, which had\r\nbecome inoperative and a nullity upon the adoption of the Constitution.\r\nThis law introduces no new form or principles for its government, but\r\nrecites, in the preamble, that it is passed in order that this ordinance\r\nmay continue to have full effect, and proceeds to make only those rules\r\nand regulations which were needful to adapt it to the new Government,\r\ninto whose hands the power had fallen. It appears, therefore, that this\r\nCongress regarded the purposes to which the land in this Territory was\r\nto be applied, and the form of government and principles of\r\njurisprudence which were to prevail there, while it remained in the\r\nterritorial state, as already determined on by the States when they had\r\nfull power and right to make the decision; and that the new Government,\r\nhaving received it in this condition, ought to carry substantially into\r\neffect the plans and principles which had been previously adopted by the\r\nStates, and which, no doubt, the States anticipated when they\r\nsurrendered their power to the new Government. And if we regard this\r\nclause of the Constitution as pointing to this Territory, with a\r\nTerritorial Government already established in it, which had been ceded\r\nto the States for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned--every word in it\r\nis perfectly appropriate and easily understood, and the provisions it\r\ncontains are in perfect harmony with the objects for which it was ceded,\r\nand with the condition of its government as a Territory at the time. We\r\ncan, then, easily account for the manner in which the first Congress\r\nlegislated on the subject--and can also understand why this power over\r\nthe Territory was associated in the same clause with the other property\r\nof the United States, and subjected to the like power of making needful\r\nrules and regulations. But if the clause is construed in the expanded\r\nsense contended for, so as to embrace any territory acquired from a\r\nforeign nation by the present Government, and to give it in such\r\nterritory a despotic and unlimited power over persons and property, such\r\nas the confederated States might exercise in their common property, it\r\nwould be difficult to account for the phraseology used, when compared\r\nwith other grants of power--and also for its association with the other\r\nprovisions in the same clause.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has always been remarkable for the felicity of its\r\narrangement of different subjects, and the perspicuity and\r\nappropriateness of the language it uses. But if this clause is construed\r\nto extend to territory acquired by the present Government from a foreign\r\nnation, outside of the limits of any charter from the British Government\r\nto a colony, it would be difficult to say, why it was deemed necessary\r\nto give the Government the power to sell any vacant lands belonging to\r\nthe sovereignity which might be found within it; and if this was\r\nnecessary, why the grant of this power should precede the power to\r\nlegislate over it and establish a Government there; and still more\r\ndifficult to say, why it was deemed necessary so specially and\r\nparticularly to grant the power to make needful rules and regulations in\r\nrelation to any personal or movable property it might acquire there. For\r\nthe words, _other property_, necessarily, by every known rule of\r\ninterpretation, must mean property of a different description from\r\nterritory or land. And the difficulty would perhaps be insurmountable in\r\nendeavoring to account for the last member of the sentence, which\r\nprovides that \"nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to\r\nprejudice any claims of the United States or any particular State,\" or\r\nto say how any particular State could have claims in or to a territory\r\nceded by a foreign Government, or to account for associating this\r\nprovision with the preceding provisions of the clause, with which it\r\nwould appear to have no connection.\r\n\r\nThe words \"needful rules and regulations\" would seem, also, to have been\r\ncautiously used for some definite object. They are not the words usually\r\nemployed by statesmen, when they mean to give the powers of sovereignty,\r\nor to establish a Government, or to authorize its establishment. Thus,\r\nin the law to renew and keep alive the ordinance of 1787, and to\r\nre-establish the Government, the title of the law is: \"An act to provide\r\nfor the government of the territory northwest of the river Ohio.\" And in\r\nthe Constitution, when granting the power to legislate over the\r\nterritory that may be selected for the seat of Government independently\r\nof a State, it does not say Congress shall have power \"to make all\r\nneedful rules and regulations respecting the territory;\" but it declares\r\nthat \"Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all\r\ncases whatsoever over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as\r\nmay, by cession of particular States and the acceptance of Congress,\r\nbecome the seat of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe words \"rules and regulations\" are usually employed in the\r\nConstitution in speaking of some particular specified power which it\r\nmeans to confer on the Government, and not, as we have seen, when\r\ngranting general powers of legislation. As, for example, in the peculiar\r\npower to Congress \"to make rules for the government and regulation of\r\nthe land and naval forces, or the particular and specific power to\r\nregulate commerce;\" \"to establish an uniform _rule_ of naturalization;\"\r\n\"to coin money and _regulate_ the value thereof.\" And to construe the\r\nwords of which we are speaking as a general and unlimited grant of\r\nsovereignty over territories which the Government might afterward\r\nacquire, is to use them in a sense and for a purpose for which they were\r\nnot used in any other part of the instrument. But if confined to a\r\nparticular Territory, in which a Government and laws had already been\r\nestablished, but which would require some alterations to adapt it to the\r\nnew Government, the words are peculiarly applicable and appropriate for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of this special provision in relation to property and the\r\nrights or property held in common by the confederated States, is\r\nillustrated by the first clause of the sixth article. This clause\r\nprovides that \"all debts, contracts, and engagements entered into before\r\nthe adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United\r\nStates under this Government as under the Confederation.\" This\r\nprovision, like the one under consideration, was indispensable if the\r\nnew Constitution was adopted. The new Government was not a mere change\r\nin a dynasty, or in a form of government, leaving the nation or\r\nsovereignty the same, and clothed with all the rights, and bound by all\r\nthe obligations of the preceding one. But when the present United States\r\ncame into existence under the new Government, it was a new political\r\nbody, and a new nation, then for the first time taking its place in the\r\nfamily of nations. It took nothing by succession from the Confederation.\r\nIt had no right, as its successor, to any property or rights of property\r\nwhich it had acquired, and was not liable for any of its obligations. It\r\nwas evidently viewed in this light by the framers of the Constitution.\r\nAnd as the several States would cease to exist in their former\r\nconfederated character upon the adoption of the Constitution, and could\r\nnot, in that character, again assemble together, special provisions were\r\nindispensable to transfer to the new Government the property and rights\r\nwhich at that time they held in common; and at the same time to\r\nauthorize it to lay taxes and appropriate money to pay the common debt\r\nwhich they had contracted; and this power could only be given to it by\r\nspecial provisions in the Constitution. The clause in relation to the\r\nterritory and other property of the United States provided for the\r\nfirst, and the clause last quoted provides for the other. They have no\r\nconnection with the general powers and rights of sovereignty delegated\r\nto the new Government, and can neither enlarge nor diminish them. They\r\nwere inserted to meet a present emergency, and not to regulate its\r\npowers as a Government.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a similar provision was deemed necessary, in relation to\r\ntreaties made by the Confederation; and when in the clause next\r\nsucceeding the one of which we have last spoken, it is declared that\r\ntreaties shall be the supreme law of the land, care is taken to include,\r\nby express words, the treaties made by the confederated States. The\r\nlanguage is: \"and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the\r\nauthority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land.\"\r\n\r\nWhether, therefore, we take the particular clause in question, by\r\nitself, or in connection with the other provisions of the Constitution,\r\nwe think it clear, that it applies only to the particular territory of\r\nwhich we have spoken, and cannot, by any just rule of interpretation, be\r\nextended to territory which the new Government might afterward obtain\r\nfrom a foreign nation. Consequently, the power which Congress may have\r\nlawfully exercised in this Territory, while it remained under a\r\nTerritorial Government, and which may have been sanctioned by judicial\r\ndecision, can furnish no justification and no argument to support a\r\nsimilar exercise of power over territory afterward acquired by the\r\nFederal Government. We put aside, therefore, any argument, drawn from\r\nprecedents, showing the extent of the power which the General Government\r\nexercised over slavery in this Territory, as altogether inapplicable to\r\nthe case before us.\r\n\r\nBut the case of the American and Ocean Insurance Companies _v._ Canter\r\n(1 Pet., 511) has been quoted as establishing a different construction\r\nof this clause of the Constitution. There is, however, not the slightest\r\nconflict between the opinion now given and the one referred to; and it\r\nis only by taking a single sentence out of the latter and separating it\r\nfrom the context, that even an appearance of conflict can be shown. We\r\nneed not comment on such a mode of expounding an opinion of the court.\r\nIndeed it most commonly misrepresents instead of expounding it. And this\r\nis fully exemplified in the case referred to, where, if one sentence is\r\ntaken by itself, the opinion would appear to be in direct conflict with\r\nthat now given; but the words which immediately follow that sentence\r\nshow that the court did not mean to decide the point, but merely\r\naffirmed the power of Congress to establish a Government in the\r\nTerritory, leaving it an open question, whether that power was derived\r\nfrom this clause in the Constitution, or was to be necessarily inferred\r\nfrom a power to acquire territory by cession from a foreign Government.\r\nThe opinion on this part of the case is short, and we give the whole of\r\nit to show how well the selection of a single sentence is calculated to\r\nmislead.\r\n\r\nThe passage referred to is in page 542, in which the court, in speaking\r\nof the power of Congress to establish a Territorial Government in\r\nFlorida until it should become a State, uses the following language:\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time Florida continues to be a Territory of the United\r\nStates, governed by that clause of the Constitution which empowers\r\nCongress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the\r\nterritory or other property of the United States. Perhaps the power of\r\ngoverning a Territory belonging to the United States, which has not, by\r\nbecoming a State, acquired the means of self-government, may result,\r\nnecessarily, from the facts that it is not within the jurisdiction of\r\nany particular State, and is within the power and jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States. The right to govern may be the inevitable consequence of\r\nthe right to acquire territory. _Whichever may be the source from which\r\nthe power is derived, the possession of it is unquestionable._\"\r\n\r\nIt is thus clear, from the whole opinion on this point, that the court\r\ndid not mean to decide whether the power was derived from the clause in\r\nthe Constitution, or was the necessary consequence of the right to\r\nacquire. They do decide that the power in Congress is unquestionable,\r\nand in this we entirely concur, and nothing will be found in this\r\nopinion to the contrary. The power stands firmly on the latter\r\nalternative put by the court--that is, as \"_the inevitable consequence\r\nof the right to acquire territory_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what still more clearly demonstrates that the court did not mean to\r\ndecide the question, but leave it open for future consideration, is the\r\nfact that the case was decided in the Circuit Court by Mr. Justice\r\nJohnson, and his decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court. His opinion\r\nat the circuit is given in full in a note to the case, and in that\r\nopinion he states, in explicit terms, that the clause of the\r\nConstitution applies only to the territory then within the limits of the\r\nUnited States, and not to Florida, which had been acquired by cession\r\nfrom Spain. This part of his opinion will be found in the note in page\r\n517 of the report. But he does not dissent from the opinion of the\r\nSupreme Court; thereby showing that, in his judgment, as well as that of\r\nthe court, the case before them did not call for a decision on that\r\nparticular point, and the court abstained from deciding it. And in a\r\npart of its opinion subsequent to the passage we have quoted, where the\r\ncourt speak of the legislative power of Congress in Florida, they still\r\nspeak with the same reserve. And in page 546, speaking of the power of\r\nCongress to authorize the Territorial Legislature to establish courts\r\nthere, the court say: \"They are legislative courts, created in virtue of\r\nthe general right of sovereignty which exists in the Government, or in\r\nvirtue of that clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules\r\nand regulations respecting the territory belonging to the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the construction given to this clause is new, and\r\nnow for the first time brought forward. The case of which we are\r\nspeaking, and which has been so much discussed, shows that the fact is\r\notherwise. It shows that precisely the same question came before Mr.\r\nJustice Johnson, at his circuit, thirty years ago--was fully considered\r\nby him, and the same construction given to the clause in the\r\nConstitution which is now given by this court. And that upon an appeal\r\nfrom his decision the same question was brought before this court, but\r\nwas not decided because a decision upon it was not required by the case\r\nbefore the court.\r\n\r\nThere is another sentence in the opinion which has been commented on,\r\nwhich even in a still more striking manner shows how one may mislead or\r\nbe misled by taking out a single sentence from the opinion of a court,\r\nand leaving out of view what precedes and follows. It is in page 546,\r\nnear the close of the opinion, in which the court say: \"In legislating\r\nfor them,\" (the territories of the United States,) \"Congress exercises\r\nthe combined powers of the General and of a State Government.\" And it is\r\nsaid, that as a State may unquestionably prohibit slavery within its\r\nterritory, this sentence decides in effect that Congress may do the same\r\nin a territory of the United States, exercising there the powers of a\r\nState, as well as the power of the General Government.\r\n\r\nThe examination of this passage in the case referred to, would be more\r\nappropriate when we come to consider in another part of this opinion\r\nwhat power Congress can constitutionally exercise in a Territory, over\r\nthe rights of person or rights of property of a citizen. But, as it is\r\nin the same case with the passage we have before commented on, we\r\ndispose of it now, as it will save the court from the necessity of\r\nreferring again to the case. And it will be seen upon reading the page\r\nin which this sentence is found, that it has no reference whatever to\r\nthe power of Congress over rights of person or rights of property--but\r\nrelates altogether to the power of establishing judicial tribunals to\r\nadminister the laws constitutionally passed, and defining the\r\njurisdiction they may exercise.\r\n\r\nThe law of Congress establishing a Territorial Government in Florida,\r\nprovided that the Legislature of the Territory should have legislative\r\npowers over \"all rightful objects of legislation; but no law should be\r\nvalid which was inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the power thus conferred, the Legislature of Florida passed an\r\nact, erecting a tribunal at Key West to decide cases of salvage. And in\r\nthe case of which we are speaking, the question arose whether the\r\nTerritorial Legislature could be authorized by Congress to establish\r\nsuch a tribunal, with such powers; and one of the parties among other\r\nobjections, insisted that Congress could not under the Constitution\r\nauthorize the Legislature of the Territory to establish such a tribunal\r\nwith such powers, but that it must be established by Congress itself;\r\nand that a sale of cargo made under its order, to pay salvors, was void,\r\nas made without legal authority, and passed no property to the\r\npurchaser.\r\n\r\nIt is in disposing of this objection that the sentence relied on occurs,\r\nand the court begin that part of the opinion by stating with great\r\nprecision the point which they are about to decide.\r\n\r\nThey say: \"It has been contended that by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, the judicial power of the United States extends to all cases of\r\nadmiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and that the whole of the judicial\r\npower must be vested 'in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts\r\nas Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.' Hence it has\r\nbeen argued that Congress can not vest admiralty jurisdiction in courts\r\ncreated by the Territorial Legislature.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after thus clearly stating the point before them, and which they\r\nwere about to decide, they proceed to show that these Territorial\r\ntribunals were not constitutional courts, but merely legislative, and\r\nthat Congress might, therefore, delegate the power to the Territorial\r\nGovernment to establish the court in question; and they conclude that\r\npart of the opinion in the following words: \"Although admiralty\r\njurisdiction can be exercised in the States in those courts only which\r\nare established in pursuance of the third article of the Constitution,\r\nthe same limitation does not extend to the Territories. In legislating\r\nfor them, Congress exercises the combined powers of the General and\r\nState Governments.\"\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen by these quotations from the opinion, that the\r\ncourt, after stating the question it was about to decide in a manner too\r\nplain to be misunderstood, proceeded to decide it, and announced, as the\r\nopinion of the tribunal, that in organizing the judicial department of\r\nthe Government in a Territory of the United States, Congress does not\r\nact under, and is not restricted by, the third article in the\r\nConstitution, and is not bound, in a Territory, to ordain and establish\r\ncourts in which the judges hold their offices during good behaviour, but\r\nmay exercise the discretionary power which a State exercises in\r\nestablishing its judicial department, and regulating the jurisdiction of\r\nits courts, and may authorize the Territorial Government to establish,\r\nor may itself establish, courts in which the judges hold their offices\r\nfor a term of years only; and may vest in them judicial power upon\r\nsubjects confided to the judiciary of the United States. And in doing\r\nthis, Congress undoubtedly exercises the combined power of the General\r\nand a State Government. It exercises the discretionary power of a State\r\nGovernment in authorizing the establishment of a court in which the\r\njudges hold their appointments for a term of years only, and not during\r\ngood behaviour; and it exercises the power of the General Government in\r\ninvesting that court with admiralty jurisdiction, over which the General\r\nGovernment had exclusive jurisdiction in the Territory.\r\n\r\nNo one, we presume, will question the correctness of that opinion; nor\r\nis there any thing in conflict with it in the opinion now given. The\r\npoint decided in the case cited has no relation to the question now\r\nbefore the court. That depended on the construction of the third article\r\nof the Constitution, in relation to the judiciary of the United States,\r\nand the power which Congress might exercise in a Territory in organizing\r\nthe judicial department of the Government. The case before us depends\r\nupon other and different provisions of the Constitution, altogether\r\nseparate and apart from the one above mentioned. The question as to\r\nwhat courts Congress may ordain or establish in a Territory to\r\nadminister laws which the Constitution authorizes it to pass, and what\r\nlaws it is or is not authorized by the Constitution to pass, are widely\r\ndifferent--are regulated by different and separate articles of the\r\nConstitution, and stand upon different principles. And we are satisfied\r\nthat no one who reads attentively the page in Peters' Reports to which\r\nwe have referred, can suppose that the attention of the court was drawn\r\nfor a moment to the question now before this court, or that it meant in\r\nthat case to say that Congress had a right to prohibit a citizen of the\r\nUnited States from taking any property which he lawfully held into a\r\nTerritory of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to examine by what provision of the Constitution the\r\npresent Federal Government, under its delegated and restricted powers,\r\nis authorized to acquire territory outside of the original limits of the\r\nUnited States, and what powers it may exercise therein over the person\r\nor property of a citizen of the United States, while it remains a\r\nTerritory, and until it shall be admitted as one of the States of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly no power given by the Constitution to the Federal\r\nGovernment to establish or maintain colonies bordering on the United\r\nStates or at a distance, to be ruled and governed at its own pleasure;\r\nnor to enlarge its territorial limits in any way, except by the\r\nadmission of new States. That power is plainly given; and if a new State\r\nis admitted, it needs no further legislation from Congress, because the\r\nConstitution itself defines the relative rights and powers, and duties\r\nof the State, and the citizens of the State, and the Federal Government.\r\nBut no power is given to acquire a Territory to be held and governed\r\npermanently in that character.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the power exercised by Congress to acquire territory and\r\nestablish a Government there, according to its own unlimited discretion,\r\nwas viewed with great jealousy by the leading statesmen of the day. And\r\nin the Federalist, (No. 38,) written by Mr. Madison, he speaks of the\r\nacquisition of the Northwestern Territory by the confederated States, by\r\nthe cession from Virginia, and the establishment of a Government there,\r\nas an exercise of power not warranted by the Articles of Confederation,\r\nand dangerous to the liberties of the people. And he urges the adoption\r\nof the Constitution as a security and safeguard against such an exercise\r\nof power.\r\n\r\nWe do not mean, however, to question the power of Congress in this\r\nrespect. The power to expand the territory of the United States by the\r\nadmission of new States is plainly given; and in the construction of\r\nthis power by all the departments of the Government, it has been held to\r\nauthorize the acquisition of territory, not fit for admission at the\r\ntime, but to be admitted as soon as its population and situation would\r\nentitle it to admission. It is acquired to become a State, and not to be\r\nheld as a colony and governed by Congress with absolute authority; and\r\nas the propriety of admitting a new State is committed to the sound\r\ndiscretion of Congress, the power to acquire territory for that purpose,\r\nto be held by the United States until it is in a suitable condition to\r\nbecome a State upon an equal footing with the other States, must rest\r\nupon the same discretion. It is a question for the political department\r\nof the Government, and not the judicial; and whatever the political\r\ndepartment of the Government shall recognize as within the limits of the\r\nUnited States, the judicial department is also bound to recognize, and\r\nto administer in it the laws of the United States, so far as they apply,\r\nand to maintain in the Territory the authority and rights of the\r\nGovernment, and also the personal rights and rights of property of\r\nindividual citizens, as secured by the Constitution. All we mean to say\r\non this point is, that, as there is no express regulation in the\r\nConstitution defining the power which the General Government may\r\nexercise over the person or property of a citizen in a Territory thus\r\nacquired, the court must necessarily look to the provisions and\r\nprinciples of the Constitution, and its distribution of powers, for the\r\nrules and principles by which its decision must be governed.\r\n\r\nTaking this rule to guide us, it may be safely assumed that citizens of\r\nthe United States who migrate to a Territory belonging to the people of\r\nthe United States, cannot be ruled as mere colonists, dependent upon the\r\nwill of the General Government, and to be governed by any laws it may\r\nthink proper to impose. The principle upon which our Government rests,\r\nand upon which alone they continue to exist, is the union of States,\r\nsovereign and independent within their own limits in their internal and\r\ndomestic concerns, and bound together as one people by a General\r\nGovernment, possessing certain enumerated and restricted powers,\r\ndelegated to it by the people of the several States, and exercising\r\nsupreme authority within the scope of the powers granted to it,\r\nthroughout the dominion of the United States. A power, therefore, in the\r\nGeneral Government to obtain and hold colonies and dependent\r\nterritories, over which they might legislate without restriction, would\r\nbe inconsistent with its own existence in its present form. Whatever it\r\nacquires, it acquires for the benefit of the people of the several\r\nStates who created it. It is their trustee acting for them, and charged\r\nwith the duty of promoting the interests of the whole people of the\r\nwhole Union in the exercise of the powers specifically granted.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Territory in question was obtained by cession from\r\nFrance, it contained no population fit to be associated together and\r\nadmitted as a State; and it therefore was absolutely necessary to hold\r\npossession of it, as a Territory belonging to the United States, until\r\nit was settled and inhabited by a civilized community capable of\r\nself-government, and in a condition to be admitted on equal terms with\r\nthe other States as a member of the Union. But, as we have before said,\r\nit was acquired by the General Government, as the representative and\r\ntrustee of the people of the United States, and it must therefore be\r\nheld in that character for their common and equal benefit; for it was\r\nthe people of the several States, acting through their agent and\r\nrepresentative, the Federal Government, who in fact acquired the\r\nTerritory in question, and the Government holds it for their common use\r\nuntil it shall be associated with the other States as a member of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nBut until that time arrives, it is undoubtedly necessary that some\r\nGovernment should be established in order to organize society, and to\r\nprotect the inhabitants in their persons and property; and as the people\r\nof the United States could act in this matter only through the\r\nGovernment which represented them, and through which they spoke and\r\nacted when the Territory was obtained, it was not only within the scope\r\nof its powers, but it was its duty to pass such laws and establish such\r\na Government as would enable those by whose authority they acted to reap\r\nthe advantages anticipated from its acquisition, and to gather there a\r\npopulation which would enable it to assume the position to which it was\r\ndestined among the States of the Union. The power to acquire necessarily\r\ncarries with it the power to preserve and apply to the purposes for\r\nwhich it was acquired. The form of government to be established\r\nnecessarily rested in the discretion of Congress. It was their duty to\r\nestablish the one that would be best suited for the protection and\r\nsecurity of the citizens of the United States, and other inhabitants who\r\nmight be authorized to take up their abode there, and that must always\r\ndepend upon the existing condition of the Territory, as to the number\r\nand character of its inhabitants, and their situation in the Territory.\r\nIn some cases a Government, consisting of persons appointed by the\r\nFederal Government, would best subserve the interests of the Territory,\r\nwhen the inhabitants were few and scattered, and new to one another. In\r\nother instances, it would be more advisable to commit the powers of\r\nself-government to the people who had settled in the Territory, as being\r\nthe most competent to determine what was best for their own interests.\r\nBut some form of civil authority would be absolutely necessary to\r\norganize and preserve civilized society, and prepare it to become a\r\nState; and what is the best form must always depend on the condition of\r\nthe territory at the time, and the choice of the mode must depend upon\r\nthe exercise of a discretionary power by Congress, acting within the\r\nscope of its constitutional authority, and not infringing upon the\r\nrights of person or rights of property of the citizen who might go there\r\nto reside, or for any other lawful purpose. It was acquired by the\r\nexercise of this discretion, and it must be held and governed in like\r\nmanner, until it is fitted to be a State.\r\n\r\nBut the power of Congress over the person or property of a citizen can\r\nnever be a mere discretionary power under our Constitution and form of\r\nGovernment. The powers of the Government and the rights and privileges\r\nof the citizen are regulated and plainly defined by the Constitution\r\nitself. And when the Territory becomes a part of the United States, the\r\nFederal Government enters into possession in the character impressed\r\nupon it by those who created it. It enters upon it with its powers over\r\nthe citizen strictly defined, and limited by the Constitution, from\r\nwhich it derives its own existence, and by virtue of which alone it\r\ncontinues to exist and act as a Government and sovereignty. It has no\r\npower of any kind beyond it; and it cannot, when it enters a Territory\r\nof the United States, put off its character, and assume discretionary or\r\ndespotic powers which the Constitution has denied to it. It cannot\r\ncreate for itself a new character separated from the citizens of the\r\nUnited States, and the duties it owes them under the provisions of the\r\nConstitution. The Territory being a part of the United States, the\r\nGovernment and the citizen both enter it under the authority of the\r\nConstiution, with their respective rights defined and marked out; and\r\nthe Federal Government can exercise no power over his person or\r\nproperty, beyond what that instrument confers, nor lawfully deny any\r\nright which it has reserved.\r\n\r\nA reference to a few of the provisions of the Constitution will\r\nillustrate this proposition.\r\n\r\nFor example, no one, we presume, will contend that Congress can make any\r\nlaw in a Territory respecting the establishment of religion, or the free\r\nexercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or\r\nthe right of the people of the Territory peacably to assemble, and to\r\npetition the Government for the redress of grievances.\r\n\r\nNor can Congress deny to the people the right to keep and bear arms, nor\r\nthe right to trial by jury, nor compel any one to be a witness against\r\nhimself in a criminal proceeding.\r\n\r\nThese powers, and others, in relation to rights of person, which it is\r\nnot necessary here to enumerate, are, in express and positive terms,\r\ndenied to the General Government; and the rights of private property\r\nhave been guarded with equal care. Thus the rights of property are\r\nunited with the rights of person, and placed on the same ground by the\r\nfifth amendment to the Constitution, which provides that no person shall\r\nbe deprived of life, liberty, and property, without due process of law.\r\nAnd an act of Congress which deprives a citizen of the United States of\r\nhis liberty or property, merely because he came himself or brought his\r\nproperty into a particular Territory of the United States, and who had\r\ncommitted no offense against the laws, could hardly be dignified with\r\nthe name of due process of law.\r\n\r\nSo, too, it will hardly be contended that Congress could by law quarter\r\na soldier in a house in a Territory without the consent of the owner, in\r\ntime of peace; nor in time of war, but in a manner prescribed by law.\r\nNor could they by law forfeit the property of a citizen in a Territory\r\nwho was convicted of treason, for a longer period than the life of the\r\nperson convicted; nor take private property for public use without just\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nThe powers over person and property of which we speak are not only not\r\ngranted to Congress, but are in express terms denied, and they are\r\nforbidden to exercise them. And this prohibition is not confined to the\r\nStates, but the words are general, and extend to the whole territory\r\nover which the Constitution gives it power to legislate, including those\r\nportions of it remaining under Territorial Government, as well as that\r\ncovered by States. It is a total absence of power everywhere within the\r\ndominion of the United States, and places the citizens of a Territory,\r\nso far as these rights are concerned, on the same footing with citizens\r\nof the States, and guards them as firmly and plainly against any inroads\r\nwhich the General Government might attempt, under the plea of implied or\r\nincidental powers. And if Congress itself cannot do this--if it is\r\nbeyond the powers conferred on the Federal Government--it will be\r\nadmitted, we presume, that it could not authorize a Territorial\r\nGovernment to exercise them. It could confer no power on any local\r\nGovernment, established by its authority, to violate the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, to be supposed, that there is a difference between\r\nproperty in a slave and other property, and that different rules may be\r\napplied to it in expounding the Constitution of the United States. And\r\nthe laws and usages of nations, and the writings of eminent jurists upon\r\nthe relation of master and slave and their mutual rights and duties, and\r\nthe powers which Governments may exercise over it, have been dwelt upon\r\nin the argument.\r\n\r\nBut in considering the question before us, it must be borne in mind that\r\nthere is no law of nations standing between the people of the United\r\nStates and their Government, and interfering with their relation to each\r\nother. The powers of the Government, and the rights of the citizen under\r\nit, are positive and practical regulations plainly written down. The\r\npeople of the United States have delegated to it certain enumerated\r\npowers, and forbidden it to exercise others. It has no power over the\r\nperson or property of a citizen but what the citizens of the United\r\nStates have granted. And no laws or usages of other nations, or\r\nreasoning of statesmen or jurists upon the relations of master and\r\nslave, can enlarge the powers of the Government, or take from the\r\ncitizens the rights they have reserved. And if the Constitution\r\nrecognizes the right of property of the master in a slave, and makes no\r\ndistinction between that description of property and other property\r\nowned by a citizen, no tribunal, acting under the authority of the\r\nUnited States, whether it be legislative, executive, or judicial, has a\r\nright to draw such a distinction, or deny to it the benefit of the\r\nprovisions and guarantees which have been provided for the protection of\r\nprivate property against the encroachments of the Government.\r\n\r\nNow, as we have already said in an earlier part of this opinion, upon a\r\ndifferent point, the right of property in a slave is distinctly and\r\nexpressly affirmed in the Constitution. The right to traffic in it, like\r\nan ordinary article of merchandise and property, was guaranteed to the\r\ncitizens of the United States, in every State that might desire it, for\r\ntwenty years. And the Government in express terms is pledged to protect\r\nit in all future time, if the slave escapes from his owner. This is done\r\nin plain words--too plain to be misunderstood. And no word can be found\r\nin the Constitution which gives Congress a greater power over\r\nslave-property, or which entitles property of that kind to less\r\nprotection than property of any other description. The only power\r\nconferred is the power coupled with the duty of guarding and protecting\r\nthe owner in his rights.\r\n\r\nUpon these considerations, it is the opinion of the court that the act\r\nof Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning property\r\nof this kind in the territory of the United States north of the line\r\ntherein mentioned, is not warranted by the Constitution, and is\r\ntherefore void; and that neither Dred Scott himself, nor any of his\r\nfamily, were made free by being carried into this territory; even if\r\nthey had been carried there by the owner, with the intention of becoming\r\na permanent resident.\r\n\r\nWe have so far examined the case, as it stands under the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, and the powers thereby delegated to the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut there is another point in the case which depends on State power and\r\nState law. And it is contended, on the part of the plaintiff, that he is\r\nmade free by being taken to Rock Island, in the State of Illinois,\r\nindependently of his residence in the territory of the United States;\r\nand being so made free, he was not again reduced to a state of slavery\r\nby being brought back to Missouri.\r\n\r\nOur notice of this part of the case will be very brief; for the\r\nprinciple on which it depends was decided in this court, upon much\r\nconsideration in the case of Strader et al. _v._ Graham, reported in\r\n10th Howard, 82. In that case, the slaves had been taken from Kentucky\r\nto Ohio, with the consent of the owner, and afterward brought back to\r\nKentucky. And this court held that their _status_ or condition, as free\r\nor slave, depended upon the laws of Kentucky, when they were brought\r\nback into that State, and not of Ohio; and that this court had no\r\njurisdiction to revise the judgment of a State court upon its own laws.\r\nThis was the point directly before the court, and the decision that this\r\ncourt had not jurisdiction turned upon it, as will be seen by the report\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\nSo in this case. As Scott was a slave when taken into the State of\r\nIllinois by his owner, and was there held as such, and brought back in\r\nthat character, his _status_, as free or slave, depended on the laws of\r\nMissouri, and not of Illinois.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been urged in the argument, that by the laws of\r\nMissouri he was free on his return, and that this case, therefore, can\r\nnot be governed by the case of Strader et al. _v._ Graham, where it\r\nappeared, by the laws of Kentucky, that the plaintiffs continued to be\r\nslaves on their return from Ohio. But whatever doubts or opinions may,\r\nat one time, have been entertained upon this subject, we are satisfied,\r\nupon a careful examination of all the cases decided in the State courts\r\nof Missouri referred to, that it is now firmly settled by the decisions\r\nof the highest court in the State, that Scott and his family upon their\r\nreturn were not free, but were, by the laws of Missouri, the property of\r\nthe defendant; and that the Circuit Court of the United States had no\r\njurisdiction, when, by the laws of the State, the plaintiff was a slave,\r\nand not a citizen.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the plaintiff, it appears, brought a similar action against\r\nthe defendant in the State Court of Missouri, claiming the freedom of\r\nhimself and his family upon the same grounds and the same evidence upon\r\nwhich he relies in the case before the court. The case was carried\r\nbefore the Supreme Court of the State; was fully argued there; and that\r\ncourt decided that neither the plaintiff nor his family were entitled to\r\nfreedom, and were still the slaves of the defendant; and reversed the\r\njudgment of the inferior State court, which had given a different\r\ndecision. If the plaintiff supposed that this judgment of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the State was erroneous, and that this court had jurisdiction\r\nto revise and reverse it, the only mode by which he could legally bring\r\nit before this court was by writ of error directed to the Supreme Court\r\nof the State, requiring it to transmit the record to this court. If\r\nthis had been done, it is too plain for argument that the writ must have\r\nbeen dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court. The case of\r\nStrader and others _v._ Graham is directly in point; and, indeed,\r\nindependent of any decision, the language of the 25th section of the act\r\nof 1789 is too clear and precise to admit of controversy.\r\n\r\nBut the plaintiff did not pursue the mode prescribed by law for bringing\r\nthe judgment of a State court before this court for revision, but\r\nsuffered the case to be remanded to the inferior State court, where it\r\nis still continued, and is, by agreement of parties, to await the\r\njudgment of this court on the point. All of this appears on the record\r\nbefore us, and by the printed report of the case.\r\n\r\nAnd while the case is yet open and pending in the inferior State court,\r\nthe plaintiff goes into the Circuit Court of the United States, upon the\r\nsame case and the same evidence, and against the same party, and\r\nproceeds to judgment, and then brings here the same case from the\r\nCircuit Court, which the law would not have permitted him to bring\r\ndirectly from the State court. And if this court takes jurisdiction in\r\nthis form, the result, so far as the rights of the respective parties\r\nare concerned, is in every respect substantially the same as if it had\r\nin open violation of law entertained jurisdiction over the judgment of\r\nthe State court upon a writ of error, and revised and reversed its\r\njudgment upon the ground that its opinion upon the question of law was\r\nerroneous. It would ill become this court to sanction such an attempt to\r\nevade the law, or to exercise an appellate power in this circuitous way,\r\nwhich it is forbidden to exercise in the direct and regular and\r\ninvariable forms of judicial proceedings.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, therefore, it is the judgment of this court, that it\r\nappears by the record before us that the plaintiff in error is not a\r\ncitizen of Missouri, in the sense in which that word is used in the\r\nConstitution; and that the Circuit Court of the United States, for that\r\nreason, had no jurisdiction in the case, and could give no judgment in\r\nit. Its judgment for the defendant must, consequently, be reversed, and\r\na mandate issued, directing the suit to be dismissed for want of\r\njurisdiction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS DECIDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1. Upon a writ of error to a Circuit Court of the United States, the\r\ntranscript of the record of all the proceedings in the case is brought\r\nbefore this court, and is open to its inspection and revision.\r\n\r\n2. When a plea to the jurisdiction, in abatement, is overruled by the\r\ncourt upon demurrer, and the defendant pleads in bar, and upon these\r\npleas the final judgment of the court is in his favor--if the plaintiff\r\nbrings a writ of error, the judgment of the court upon the plea in\r\nabatement is before this court, although it was in favor of the\r\nplaintiff--and if the court erred in overruling it, the judgment must be\r\nreversed, and a mandate issued to the Circuit Court to dismiss the case\r\nfor want of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n3. In the Circuit Courts of the United States, the record must show that\r\nthe case is one in which by the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, the court had jurisdiction--and if this does not appear, and the\r\ncourt gives judgment either for plaintiff or defendant, it is error, and\r\nthe judgment must be reversed by this court--and the parties cannot by\r\nconsent waive the objection to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.\r\n\r\n4. A free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to\r\nthis country and sold as slaves, is not a \"citizen\" within the meaning\r\nof the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n5. When the Constitution was adopted, they were not regarded in any of\r\nthe States as members of the community which constituted the State, and\r\nwere not numbered among its \"people or citizens.\" Consequently, the\r\nspecial rights and immunities guaranteed to citizens do not apply to\r\nthem. And not being \"citizens\" within the meaning of the Constitution,\r\nthey are not entitled to sue in that character in a court of the United\r\nStates, and the Circuit Court has not jurisdiction in such a suit.\r\n\r\n6. The only two clauses in the Constitution which point to this race,\r\ntreat them as persons whom it was morally lawful to deal in as articles\r\nof property and to hold as slaves.\r\n\r\n7. Since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, no State\r\ncan by any subsequent law make a foreigner or any other description of\r\npersons citizens of the United States, nor entitle them to the rights\r\nand privileges secured to citizens by that instrument.\r\n\r\n8. A State, by its laws passed since the adoption of the Constitution,\r\nmay put a foreigner or any other description of persons upon a footing\r\nwith its own citizens, as to all the rights and privileges enjoyed by\r\nthem within its dominion, and by its laws. But that will not make him a\r\ncitizen of the United States, nor entitle him to sue in its courts, nor\r\nto any of the privileges and immunities of a citizen in another State.\r\n\r\n9. The change in public opinion and feeling in relation to the African\r\nrace, which has taken place since the adoption of the Constitution,\r\ncannot change its construction and meaning, and it must be construed and\r\nadministered now according to its true meaning and intention when it was\r\nformed and adopted.\r\n\r\n10. The plaintiff having admitted, by his demurrer to the plea in\r\nabatement, that his ancestors were imported from Africa and sold as\r\nslaves, he is not a citizen of the State of Missouri according to the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and was not entitled to sue in that\r\ncharacter in the Circuit Court.\r\n\r\n11. This being the case, the judgment of the court below, in favor of\r\nthe plaintiff on the plea in abatement, was erroneous.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1. But if the plea in abatement is not brought up by this writ of error,\r\nthe objection to the citizenship of the plaintiff is still apparent on\r\nthe record, as he himself, in making out his case, states that he is of\r\nAfrican descent, was born a slave, and claims that he and his family\r\nbecame entitled to freedom by being taken by their owner to reside in a\r\nterritory where slavery is prohibited by act of Congress--and that, in\r\naddition to this claim, he himself became entitled to freedom by being\r\ntaken to Rock Island, in the State of Illinois--and being free when he\r\nwas brought back to Missouri, he was by the laws of that State a\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n2. If, therefore, the facts he states do not give him or his family a\r\nright to freedom, the plaintiff is still a slave, and not entitled to\r\nsue as a \"citizen,\" and the judgment of the Circuit Court was erroneous\r\non that ground also, without any reference to the plea in abatement.\r\n\r\n3. The Circuit Court can give no judgment for plaintiff or defendant in\r\na case where it has not jurisdiction, no matter whether there be a plea\r\nin abatement or not. And unless it appears upon the face of the record,\r\nwhen brought here by writ of error, that the Circuit Court had\r\njurisdiction, the judgment must be reversed.\r\n\r\nThe case of Capron _v._ Van Noorden (2 Cranch, 126) examined, and the\r\nprinciples thereby decided, reaffirmed.\r\n\r\n4. When the record, as brought here by writ of error, does not show that\r\nthe Circuit Court had jurisdiction, this court has jurisdiction to\r\nrevise and correct the error, like any other error in the court below.\r\nIt does not and cannot dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction here;\r\nfor that would leave the erroneous judgment of the court below in full\r\nforce, and the party injured without remedy. But it must reverse the\r\njudgment, and, as in any other case of reversal, send a mandate to the\r\nCircuit Court to conform its judgment to the opinion of this court.\r\n\r\n5. The difference of the jurisdiction in this court in the cases of\r\nwrits of error to State courts and to Circuit Courts of the United\r\nStates, pointed out; and the mistakes made as to the jurisdiction of\r\nthis court in the latter case, by confounding it with its limited\r\njurisdiction in the former.\r\n\r\n6. If the court reverses a judgment upon the ground that it appears by a\r\nparticular part of the record that the Circuit Court had not\r\njurisdiction, it does not take away the jurisdiction of this court to\r\nexamine into and correct, by a reversal of the judgment, any other\r\nerrors, either as to the jurisdiction or any other matter, where it\r\nappears from other parts of the record that the Circuit Court had fallen\r\ninto error. On the contrary, it is the daily and familiar practice of\r\nthis court to reverse on several grounds, where more than one error\r\nappears to have been committed. And the error of a Circuit Court in its\r\njurisdiction stands on the same ground, and is to be treated in the same\r\nmanner as any other error upon which its judgment is founded.\r\n\r\n7. The decision, therefore, that the judgment of the Circuit Court upon\r\nthe plea in abatement is erroneous, is no reason why the alleged error\r\napparent in the exception should not also be examined, and the judgment\r\nreversed on that ground also, if it discloses a want of jurisdiction in\r\nthe Circuit Court.\r\n\r\nIt is often the duty of this court, after having decided that a\r\nparticular decision of the Circuit Court was erroneous, to examine into\r\nother alleged errors, and to correct them if they are found to exist.\r\nAnd this has been uniformly done by this court, when the questions are\r\nin any degree connected with the controversy, and the silence of the\r\ncourt might create doubts which would lead to further and useless\r\nlitigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n1. The facts upon which the plaintiff relies did not give him his\r\nfreedom, and make him a citizen of Missouri.\r\n\r\n2. The clause in the Constitution authorizing Congress to make all\r\nneedful rules and regulations for the government of the territory and\r\nother property of the United States, applies only to territory within\r\nthe chartered limits of some one of the States when they were colonies\r\nof Great Britain, and which was surrendered by the British Government to\r\nthe old Confederation of the States, in the treaty of peace. It does not\r\napply to territory acquired by the present Federal Government, by treaty\r\nor conquest, from a foreign nation.\r\n\r\nThe case of the American and Ocean Insurance Companies _v._ Canter (1\r\nPeters, 511) referred to and examined, showing that the decision in this\r\ncase is not in conflict with that opinion, and that the court did not,\r\nin the case referred to, decide upon the construction of the clause of\r\nthe Constitution above mentioned, because the case before them did not\r\nmake it necessary to decide the question.\r\n\r\n3. The United States, under the present Constitution, cannot acquire\r\nterritory to be held as a colony, to be governed at its will and\r\npleasure. But it may acquire territory which, at the time, has not a\r\npopulation that fits it to become a State, and may govern it as a\r\nTerritory until it has a population which, in the judgment of Congress,\r\nentitles it to be admitted as a State of the Union.\r\n\r\n4. During the time it remains a Territory, Congress may legislate over\r\nit within the scope of its constitutional powers in relation to citizens\r\nof the United States--and may establish a Territorial Government--and\r\nthe form of this local Government must be regulated by the discretion of\r\nCongress, but with powers not exceeding those which Congress itself, by\r\nthe Constitution, is authorized to exercise over citizens of the United\r\nStates, in respect to their rights of persons or rights of property.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n1. The territory thus acquired, is acquired by the people of the United\r\nStates for their common and equal benefit, through their agent and\r\ntrustee, the Federal Government. Congress can exercise no power over the\r\nrights of person or property of a citizen in the Territory which is\r\nprohibited by the Constitution. The Government and the citizen, whenever\r\nthe Territory is open to settlement, both enter it with their respective\r\nrights defined and limited by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n2. Congress has no right to prohibit the citizens of any particular\r\nState or States from taking up their home there, while it permits\r\ncitizens of other States to do so. Nor has it a right to give privileges\r\nto one class of citizens which it refuses to another. The territory is\r\nacquired for their equal and common benefit--and if open to any, it must\r\nbe open to all upon equal and the same terms.\r\n\r\n3. Every citizen has a right to take with him into the Territory any\r\narticle of property which the Constitution of the United States\r\nrecognizes as property.\r\n\r\n4. The Constitution of the United States recognizes slaves as property,\r\nand pledges the Federal Government to protect it. And Congress cannot\r\nexercise any more authority over property of that description than it\r\nmay constitutionally exercise over property of any other kind.\r\n\r\n5. The act of Congress, therefore, prohibiting a citizen of the United\r\nStates from taking with him his slaves when he removes to the Territory\r\nin question to reside, is an exercise of authority over private property\r\nwhich is not warranted by the Constitution--and the removal of the\r\nplaintiff, by his owner, to that Territory, gave him no title to\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n1. The plaintiff himself acquired no title to freedom by being taken, by\r\nhis owner, to Rock Island, in Illinois, and brought back to Missouri.\r\nThis court has heretofore decided that the _status_ or condition of a\r\nperson of African descent depended on the laws of the State in which he\r\nresided.\r\n\r\n2. It has been settled by the decisions of the highest court in\r\nMissouri, that by the laws of that State, a slave does not become\r\nentitled to his freedom, where the owner takes him to reside in a State\r\nwhere slavery is not permitted, and afterwards brings him back to\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nConclusion. It follows that it is apparent upon the record that the\r\ncourt below erred in its judgment on the plea in abatement, and also\r\nerred in giving judgment for the defendant, when the exception shows\r\nthat the plaintiff was not a citizen of the United States. And as the\r\nCircuit Court had no jurisdiction, either in the case stated in the plea\r\nin abatement, or in the one stated in the exception, its judgment in\r\nfavor of the defendant is erroneous, and must be reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nFUGITIVE SLAVE LAW.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nREV. CHARLES HODGE, D.D.\r\n\r\nOF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n          NOTE.--We have affixed, by way of comment to \"the\r\n          decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott\r\n          case,\" the following able paper from the pen of\r\n          Prof. Hodge. It lucidly explains the source and\r\n          sanction of Civil Government, and deduces\r\n          therefrom the duties and responsibilities of the\r\n          governed.--ED.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          Alleged Immorality of the Law answered--Duty of\r\n          Obedience--Government a Divine Institution--The\r\n          Warrant of Government is not the consent of the\r\n          governed--Infidel Doctrines--Deductions from this\r\n          Doctrine--Decision of the Supreme\r\n          Court--Objections answered--Conscience and the\r\n          Law--Duty of Executive Officers--Duty of Private\r\n          Citizens--Objections answered--Right of\r\n          Revolution--Summary application of these\r\n          principles to the Fugitive Slave Law--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is no more obvious duty, at the present time, resting on American\r\nChristians, ministers and people, than to endeavor to promote kind\r\nfeelings between the South and the North. All fierce addresses to the\r\npassions, on either side, are fratricidal. It is an offense against the\r\ngospel, against our common country, and against God. Every one should\r\nendeavor to diffuse right principles, and thus secure right feeling and\r\naction, under the blessing of God in every part of the land. If the\r\nSouth has no such grounds of complaint as would justify them before God\r\nand the human race, whose trustees in one important sense they are, in\r\ndissolving the Union, how is it with the North? Are they justifiable in\r\nthe violent resistance to the fugitive slave bill, which has been\r\nthreatened or attempted? This opposition in a great measure has been\r\nconfined to the abolitionists as a party, and as such they are a small\r\nminority of the people. They have never included in their ranks either\r\nthe controlling intellect or moral feeling at the North. Their\r\nfundamental principle is anti-scriptural and therefore irreligious.\r\nThey assume that slaveholding is sinful. This doctrine is the life of\r\nthe sect. It has no power over those who reject that principle, and\r\ntherefore it has not gained ascendency over those whose faith is\r\ngoverned by the word of God.\r\n\r\nWe have ever maintained that the proper method of opposing this party,\r\nand of counteracting its pernicious influence, was to exhibit clearly\r\nthe falsehood of its one idea, viz: that slaveholding is a sin against\r\nGod. The discussion has now taken a new turn. It is assumed that the\r\nfugitiue slave law of the last Congress, (1850) is unconstitutional, or\r\nif not contrary to the Constitution, contrary to the law of God. Under\r\nthis impression many who have never been regarded as abolitionists, have\r\nentered their protest against the law, and some in their haste have\r\ninferred from its supposed unconstitutionality or immorality that it\r\nought to be openly resisted. It is obvious that the proper method of\r\ndealing with the subject in this new aspect, is to demonstrate that the\r\nlaw in question is according to the Constitution of the land; that it is\r\nnot inconsistent with the divine law; or, admitting its\r\nunconstitutionality or immorality, that the resistance recommended is\r\nnone the less a sin against God. We do not propose to discuss either of\r\nthe two former of these propositions. The constitutionality of the law\r\nmay safely be left in the hands of the constituted authorities. It is\r\nenough for us that there is no flagrant and manifest inconsistency\r\nbetween the law and the constitution; that the first legal authorities\r\nin the land pronounce them perfectly consistent; and that there is no\r\ndifference in principle between the present law and that of 1793 on the\r\nsame subject, in which the whole country has acquiesced for more than\r\nhalf a century. We would also say that after having read some of the\r\nmost labored disquisitions designed to prove that the fugitive slave\r\nbill subverts the fundamental principles of our federal compact, we have\r\nbeen unable to discover the least force in the arguments adduced.\r\n\r\nAs to the immorality of the law, so far as we can discover, the whole\r\nstress of the argument in the affirmative rests on two assumptions.\r\nFirst, that the law of God in Deuteronomy, expressly forbids the\r\nrestoration of a fugitive slave to his owner; and secondly, that slavery\r\nitself being sinful, it must be wrong to enforce the claims of the\r\nmaster to the service of the slave. As to the former of these\r\nassumptions, we would simply remark, that the venerable Prof. Stuart in\r\nhis recent work, \"Conscience and the Constitution,\" has clearly proved\r\nthat the law in Deuteronomy has no application to the present case. The\r\nthing there forbidden is the restoration of a slave who had fled from a\r\nheathen master and taken refuge among the worshipers of the true God.\r\nSuch a man was not to be forced back into heathenism. This is the\r\nobvious meaning and spirit of the command. That it has no reference to\r\nslaves who had escaped from Hebrew masters, and fled from one tribe or\r\ncity to another, is plain from the simple fact that the Hebrew laws\r\nrecognized slavery. It would be a perfect contradiction if the law\r\nauthorized the purchase and holding of slaves, and yet forbid the\r\nenforcing the right of possession. There could be no such thing as\r\nslavery, in such a land as Palestine, if the slave could recover his\r\nliberty by simply moving from one tribe to another over an imaginary\r\nline, or even from the house of his master to that of his next neighbor.\r\nBesides, how inconsistent is it in the abolitionists in one breath to\r\nmaintain that the laws of Moses did not recognize slavery, and in the\r\nnext, that the laws about the restoration of slaves referred to the\r\nslaves of Hebrew masters. According to their doctrine, there could be\r\namong the Israelites no slaves to restore. They must admit either that\r\nthe law of God allowed the Hebrews to hold slaves, and then there is an\r\nend to their arguments against the sinfulness of slaveholding; or\r\nacknowledge that the law representing the restoration of slaves referred\r\nonly to fugitives from the heathen, and then there is an end to their\r\nargument from this enactment against the law under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe way in which abolitionists treat the Scriptures makes it evident\r\nthat the command in Deuteronomy is urged not so much out of regard to\r\nthe authority of the word of God, as an argumentum ad hominem. Wherever\r\nthe Scriptures either in the Old or New Testament recognize the\r\nlawfulness of holding slaves, they are tortured without mercy to force\r\nfrom them a different response; and where, as in this case, they appear\r\nto favor the other side of the question, abolitionists quote them rather\r\nto silence those who make them the rule of their faith, than as the\r\nground of their own convictions. Were there no such law as that in\r\nDeuteronomy in existence, or were there a plain injunction to restore a\r\nfugitive from service to his Hebrew master, it is plain from their\r\nprinciples that they would none the less fiercely condemn the law under\r\nconsideration. Their opposition is not founded on the scriptural\r\ncommand. It rests on the assumption that the master's claim is\r\niniquitous and ought not to be enforced.[258] Their objections are not\r\nto the mode of delivery, but to the delivery itself. Why else quote the\r\nlaw in Deuteronomy, which apparently forbids such surrender of the\r\nfugitive to his master? It is clear that no effective enactment could be\r\nframed on this subject which would not meet with the same opposition. We\r\nare convinced, by reading the discussions on this subject, that the\r\nimmorality attributed to the fugitive slave law resolves itself into the\r\nassumed immorality of slaveholding. No man would object to restoring an\r\napprentice to his master; and no one would quote Scripture or search for\r\narguments to prove it sinful to restore a fugitive slave, if he believed\r\nslaveholding to be lawful in the sight of God. This being the case, we\r\nfeel satisfied that the mass of people at the North, whose conscience\r\nand action are ultimately determined by the teachings of the Bible, will\r\nsoon settle down into the conviction that the law in question is not in\r\nconflict with the law of God.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the reverse to be the fact; suppose it clearly made out that\r\nthe law passed by Congress in reference to fugitive slaves is contrary\r\nto the Constitution or to the law of God, what is to be done? What is\r\nthe duty of the people under such circumstances? The answers given to\r\nthis question are very different, and some of them so portentous that\r\nthe public mind has been aroused and directed to the consideration of\r\nthe nature of civil government and of the grounds and limits of the\r\nobedience due to the laws of the land. As this is a subject not merely\r\nof general interest at this time, but of permanent importance, we\r\npurpose to devote to its discussion the few following pages.\r\n\r\nOur design is to state in few words in what sense government is a divine\r\ninstitution, and to draw from that doctrine the principles which must\r\ndetermine the nature and limits of the obedience which is due the laws\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nThat the Bible, when it asserts that all power is of God, or the powers\r\nthat be are ordained of God, does not teach that any one form of civil\r\ngovernment has been divinely appointed as universally obligatory, is\r\nplain because the Scriptures contain no such prescription. There are no\r\ndirections given as to the form which civil governments shall assume.\r\nAll the divine commands on this subject, are as applicable under one\r\nform as another. The direction is general; obey the powers that be. The\r\npropsition is unlimited; all power is of God; i. e., government,\r\nwhatever its form, is of God. He has ordained it. The most pointed\r\nscriptural injunctions on this subject were given during the usurped or\r\ntyrannical reign of military despots. It is plain that the sacred\r\nwriters did not, in such passages, mean to teach that a military\r\ndespotism was the form of government which God had ordained as of\r\nperpetual and universal obligation. As the Bible enjoins no one form, so\r\nthe people of God in all ages, under the guidance of his Spirit, have\r\nlived with a good conscience, under all the diversities of organization\r\nof which human government is susceptible.\r\n\r\nAgain, as no one form of government is prescribed, so neither has God\r\ndetermined preceptively who are to exercise civil power. He has not\r\nsaid that such power must be hereditary, and descend on the principle of\r\nprimogeniture. He has not determined whether it shall be confined to\r\nmales to the exclusion of females; or whether all offices shall be\r\nelective. These are not matters of divine appointment, and are not\r\nincluded in the proposition that all power is of God. Neither is it\r\nincluded in this proposition that government is in such a sense ordained\r\nof God that the people have no control in the matter. The doctrine of\r\nthe Bible is not inconsistent with the right of the people, as we shall\r\nendeavor to show in the sequel, to determine their own form of\r\ngovernment and to select their own rulers.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said government is of God, we understand the Scriptures to\r\nmean, first, that it is a divine institution and not a mere social\r\ncompact. It does not belong to the category of voluntary associations\r\nsuch as men form for literary, benevolent, or commercial purposes. It is\r\nnot optional with men whether government shall exist. It is a divine\r\nappointment, in the same sense as marriage and the church are divine\r\ninstitutions. The former of these is not a mere civil contract, nor is\r\nthe church as a visible spiritual community a mere voluntary society.\r\nMen are under obligation to recognize its existence, to join its ranks\r\nand submit to its laws. In like manner it is the will of God that civil\r\ngovernment should exist. Men are bound by his authority to have civil\r\nrulers for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that\r\ndo well. This is the scriptural doctrine, as opposed to the deistical\r\ntheory of a social compact as the ultimate ground of all human\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this view of the subject that obedience to the laws of\r\nthe land is a religious duty, and that disobedience is of the specific\r\nnature of sin; this is a principle of vast importance. It is true that\r\nthe law of God is so broad that it binds a man to every thing that is\r\nright, and forbids every thing that is wrong; and consequently that\r\nevery violation even of a voluntary engagement is of the nature of an\r\noffense against God. Still there is a wide difference between\r\ndisobedience to an obligation voluntarily assumed, and which has no\r\nother sanction than our own engagement, and disregard of an obligation\r\ndirectly imposed of God. St. Peter recognizes this distinction when he\r\nsaid to Annanias, Thou hast not lied unto men but unto God. All lying is\r\nsinful, but lying to God is a higher crime than lying to men. There is\r\ngreater irreverence and contempt of the divine presence and authority,\r\nand a violation of an obligation of a higher order. Every man feels that\r\nthe marriage vows have a sacred character which could not belong to\r\nthem, if marriage was merely a civil contract. In like manner the divine\r\ninstitution of government elevates it into the sphere of religion, and\r\nadds a new and higher sanction to the obligations which it imposes.\r\nThere is a specific difference, more easily felt than described, between\r\nwhat is religious and what is merely moral; between disobedience to man\r\nand resistance to an ordinance of God.\r\n\r\nA third point included in the scriptural doctrine on this subject is,\r\nthat the actual existence of any government creates the obligation of\r\nobedience. That is, the obligation does not rest either on the origin or\r\nthe nature of the government, or on the mode in which it is\r\nadministered. It may be legitimate or revolutionary, despotic or\r\nconstitutional, just or unjust, so long as it exists it is to be\r\nrecognized and obeyed within its proper sphere. The powers that be are\r\nordained of God in such sense that the possession of power is to be\r\nreferred to his providence. It is not by chance, nor through the\r\nuncontrolled agency of men, but by divine ordination that any government\r\nexists. The declaration of the apostle just quoted was uttered under the\r\nreign of Nero. It is as true of his authority as of that of the Queen of\r\nEngland, or that of our own President, that it was of God. He made Nero\r\nEmperor. He required all within the limits of the Roman empire to\r\nrecognize and obey him so long as he was allowed to occupy the throne.\r\nIt was not necessary for the early Christians to sit in judgment on the\r\ntitle of every new emperor, whenever the pretorian guards chose to put\r\ndown one and put up another; neither are God's people now in various\r\nparts of the world called upon to discuss the titles and adjudicate the\r\nclaims of their rulers. The possession of civil power is a providential\r\nfact, and is to be regarded as such. This does not imply that God\r\napproves of every government which he allows to exist. He permits\r\noppressive rulers to bear sway, just as he permits famine or pestilence\r\nto execute his vengeance. A good government is a blessing, a bad\r\ngovernment is a judgment; but the one as much as the other is ordained\r\nof God, and is to be obeyed not only for fear but also for conscience\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nA fourth principle involved in the proposition that all power is of God\r\nis, that the magistrate is invested with a divine right. He represents\r\nGod. His authority is derived from Him. There is a sense in which he\r\nrepresents the people and derives from them his power; but in a far\r\nhigher sense he is the minister of God. To resist him is to resist God,\r\nand \"they that resist shall receive unto themselves damnation.\" Thus\r\nsaith the Scriptures. It need hardly be remarked that this principle\r\nrelates to the nature, and not to the extent, of the power of the\r\nmagistrate. It is as true of the lowest as of the highest; of a justice\r\nof the peace as of the President of the United States; of a\r\nconstitutional monarch as of an absolute sovereign. The principle is\r\nthat the authority of rulers is divine, and not human, in its origin.\r\nThey exercise the power which belongs to them of divine right. The\r\nreader, we trust, will not confound this doctrine with the old doctrine\r\nof \"the divine right of kings.\" The two things are as different as day\r\nand night. We are not for reviving a defunct theory of civil government;\r\na theory which perished, at least among Anglo-Saxons, at the expulsion\r\nof James II. from the throne of England. That monarch took it with him\r\ninto exile, and it lies entombed with the last of the Stuarts. According\r\nto that theory God had established the monarchical form of government as\r\nuniversally obligatory. There could not consistently with his law be any\r\nother. The people had no more right to renounce that form of government\r\nthan the children of a family have to resolve themselves into a\r\ndemocracy. In the second place, it assumed that God had determined the\r\nlaw of succession as well as the form of government. The people could\r\nnot change the one any more than the other; or any more than children\r\ncould change their father, or a wife her husband. And thirdly, as a\r\nnecessary consequence of these principles, it inculcated in all cases\r\nthe duty of passive obedience. The king holding his office immediately\r\nfrom God, held it entirely independent of the will of the people, and\r\nhis responsibility was to God alone. He could not forfeit his throne by\r\nany injustice however flagrant. The people, if in any case they could\r\nnot obey, were obliged to submit; resistance or revolution was treason\r\nagainst God. We have already remarked that the scriptural doctrine is\r\nopposed to every one of these principles. The Bible does not prescribe\r\nany one form of government; it does not determine who shall be\r\ndepositories of civil power; and it clearly recognizes the right of\r\nrevolution. In asserting, therefore, the divine right of rulers, we are\r\nnot asserting any doctrine repudiated by our forefathers, or\r\ninconsistent with civil liberty in its widest rational extent.\r\n\r\nSuch, as we understand it, is the true nature of civil government. It is\r\na divine institution and not a mere voluntary compact. Obedience to the\r\nmagistrate and laws is a religious duty; and disobedience is a sin\r\nagainst God. This is true of all forms of government. Men living under\r\nthe Turkish Sultan are bound to recognize his authority, as much as the\r\nsubjects of a constitutional monarch, or the fellow-citizens of an\r\nelective president, are bound to recognize their respective rulers. All\r\npower is of God, and the powers that be are ordained of God, in such\r\nsense that all magistrates are to be regarded as his ministers, acting\r\nin his name and with his authority, each within his legitimate sphere;\r\nbeyond which he ceases to be a magistrate.\r\n\r\nThat this is the doctrine of the Scriptures on this subject can hardly\r\nbe doubted. The Bible never refers to the consent of the governed, the\r\nsuperiority of the rulers, or to the general principles of expediency,\r\nas the ground of our obligation to the higher powers. The obedience\r\nwhich slaves owe their masters, children their parents, wives their\r\nhusbands, people their rulers, is always made to rest on the divine will\r\nas its ultimate foundation. It is part of the service which we owe to\r\nGod. We are required to act, in all these relations, not as\r\nmen-pleasers, but as the servants of God. All such obedience terminates\r\non our Master who is in heaven. This gives the sublimity of spiritual\r\nfreedom even to the service of a slave. It is not in the power of man to\r\nreduce to bondage those who serve God, in all the service they render\r\ntheir fellow-men. The will of God, therefore, is the foundation of our\r\nobligation to obey the laws of the land. His will, however, is not an\r\narbitrary determination; it is the expression of infinite intelligence\r\nand love. There is the most perfect agreement between all the precepts\r\nof the Bible and the highest dictates of reason. There is no command in\r\nthe word of God of permanent and universal obligation, which may not be\r\nshown to be in accordance with the laws of our own higher nature. This\r\nis one of the strongest collateral arguments in favor of the divine\r\norigin of the Scriptures. In appealing therefore to the Bible in support\r\nof the doctrine here advanced, we are not, on the one hand appealing to\r\nan arbitrary standard, a mere statute book, a collection of laws which\r\ncreate the obligations they enforce; nor, on the other hand, to \"the\r\nreason and nature of things\" in the abstract, which after all is only\r\nour own reason; but we are appealing to the infinite intelligence of a\r\npersonal God, whose will, because of his infinite excellence, is\r\nnecessarily the ultimate ground and rule of all moral obligation. This,\r\nhowever, being the case, whatever the Bible declares to be right is\r\nfound to be in accordance with the constitution of nature and our own\r\nreason. All that the Scriptures, for example, teach of the subordination\r\nof children to their parents, of wives to their husbands, has not its\r\nfoundation, but its confirmation, in the very nature of the relation of\r\nthe parties. Any violation of the precepts of the Bible, on these\r\npoints, is found to be a violation of the laws of nature, and certainly\r\ndestructive. In like manner it is clear from the social nature of man,\r\nfrom the dependence of men upon each other, from the impossibility of\r\nattaining the end of our being in this world, otherwise than in society\r\nand under an ordered government, that it is the will of God that such\r\nsociety should exist. The design of God in this matter is as plain as in\r\nthe constitution of the universe. We might as well maintain that the\r\nlaws of nature are the result of chance, or that marriage and parental\r\nauthority have no other foundation than human law, as to assert that\r\ncivil government has no firmer foundation than the will of man or the\r\nquicksands of expediency. By creating men social beings, and making it\r\nnecessary for them to live in society, God has made his will as thus\r\nrevealed the foundation of all civil government.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is but one aspect of the comprehensive doctrine of Theism,\r\na doctrine which teaches the existence of a personal God, a Spirit\r\ninfinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power,\r\njustice, holiness, goodness, and truth; a God who is everywhere present\r\nupholding and governing all his creatures and all their actions. The\r\nuniverse is not a machine left to go of itself. God did not at first\r\ncreate matter and impress upon it certain laws and then leave it to\r\ntheir blind operation. He is everywhere present in the material world,\r\nnot superseding secondary causes, but so upholding and guiding their\r\noperations, that the intelligence evinced is the omnipresent\r\nintelligence of God, and the power exercised is the _potestas ordinata_\r\nof the Great First Cause. He is no less supreme in his control of\r\nintelligent agents. They indeed are free, but not independent. They are\r\ngoverned in a manner consistent with their nature; yet God turns them as\r\nthe rivers of waters are turned. All events depending on human agency\r\nare under his control. God is in history. Neither chance nor blind\r\nnecessity determine the concatenation or issues of things. Nor is the\r\nworld in the hands of its inhabitants. God has not launched our globe on\r\nthe ocean of space and left its multitudinous crew to direct its course\r\nwithout his interference. He is at the helm. His breath fills the sails.\r\nHis wisdom and power are pledged for the prosperity of the voyage.\r\nNothing happens, even to the falling of a sparrow, which is not ordered\r\nby him. He works all things after the counsel of his will. It is by him\r\nthat kings reign and princes decree justice. He puts down one, and\r\nraises up another. As he leads out the stars by night, marshaling them\r\nas a host, calling each one by its name, so does he order all human\r\nevents. He raises up nations and appoints the bounds of their\r\nhabitation. He founds the empires of the earth and determines their form\r\nand their duration. This doctrine of God's universal providence is the\r\nfoundation of all religion. If this doctrine be not true, we are without\r\nGod in the world. But if it is true, it involves a vast deal. God is\r\neverywhere in nature and in history. Every thing is a revelation of his\r\npresence and power. We are always in contact with him. Every thing has a\r\nvoice, which speaks of his goodness or his wrath; fruitful seasons\r\nproclaim his goodness, famine and pestilence declare his displeasure.\r\nNothing is by chance. The existence of any particular form of government\r\nis as much his work, as the rising of the sun or falling of the rain. It\r\nis something he has ordained for some wise purpose, and it is to be\r\nregarded as his work. If all events are under God's control, if it is by\r\nhim that kings reign, then the actual possession of power is as much a\r\nrevelation of his will that it should be obeyed, as the possession of\r\nwisdom or goodness is a manifestation of his will that those endowed\r\nwith those gifts, should be reverenced and loved. It follows, therefore,\r\nfrom the universal providence of God, that \"the powers that be are\r\nordained of God.\" We have no more right to refuse obedience to an\r\nactually existing government because it is not to our taste, or because\r\nwe do not approve of its measures, than a child has the right to refuse\r\nto recognize a wayward parent; or a wife a capricious husband.\r\n\r\nThe religious character of our civil duties flows also from the\r\ncomprehensive doctrine that the will of God is the ground of all moral\r\nobligation. To seek that ground either in \"the reason and nature of\r\nthings,\" or in expediency, is to banish God from the moral world, as\r\neffectually as the mechanical theory of the universe banishes him from\r\nthe physical universe and from history. Our allegiance on that\r\nhypothesis is not to God but to reason or to society. This theory of\r\nmorals therefore, changes the nature of religion and of moral\r\nobligation. It modifies and degrades all religious sentiment and\r\nexercises; it changes the very nature of sin, of repentance and\r\nobedience, and gives us, what is a perfect solecism, a religion without\r\nGod. According to the Bible, our obligation to obey the laws of the land\r\nis not founded on the fact that the good of society requires such\r\nobedience, or that it is a dictate of reason, but on the authority of\r\nGod. It is part of the service which we owe to him. This must be so if\r\nthe doctrine is true that God is our moral governor, to whom we are\r\nresponsible for all our acts, and whose will is both the ground and the\r\nrule of all our obligations.\r\n\r\nWe need not, however, dwell longer on this subject. Although it has long\r\nbeen common to look upon civil government as a human institution, and to\r\nrepresent the consent of the governed as the only ground of the\r\nobligation of obedience, yet this doctrine is so notoriously of infidel\r\norigin, and so obviously in conflict with the teachings of the Bible,\r\nthat it can have no hold on the convictions of a Christian people. It is\r\nno more true of the state than it is of the family, or of the church.\r\nAll are of divine institution. All have their foundation in his will.\r\nThe duties belonging to each are enjoined by him and are enforced by his\r\nauthority. Marriage is indeed a voluntary covenant. The parties select\r\neach other, and the state may make laws regulating the mode in which the\r\ncontract shall be ratified; and determining its civil effects. It is,\r\nhowever, none the less an ordinance of God. The vows it includes are\r\nmade to God; its sanction is found in his law; and its violation is not\r\na mere breach of contract or disobedience to the civil law, but a sin\r\nagainst God. So with regard to the church, it is in one sense a\r\nvoluntary society. No man can be forced by other men to join its\r\ncommunion. If done at all it must be done with his own consent, yet\r\nevery man is under the strongest moral obligation to enter its fold. And\r\nwhen enrolled in the number of its members his obligation to obedience\r\ndoes not rest on his consent; it does not cease should that consent be\r\nwithdrawn. It rests on the authority of the church as a divine\r\ninstitution. This is an authority no man can throw off. It presses him\r\neverywhere and at all times with the weight of a moral obligation. In a\r\nsense analogous to this the state is a divine institution. Men are bound\r\nto organize themselves into a civil government. Their obligation to obey\r\nits laws does not rest upon their compact in this case, any more than in\r\nthe others above referred to. It is enjoined by God. It is a religious\r\nduty, and disobedience is a direct offense against him. The people have\r\nindeed the right to determine the form of the government under which\r\nthey are to live, and to modify it from time to time to suit their\r\nchanging condition. So, though to a less extent, or within narrower\r\nlimits, they have a right to modify the form of their ecclesiastical\r\ngovernments, a right which every church has exercised, but the ground\r\nand nature of the obligation to obedience remains unchanged. This is not\r\na matter of mere theory. It is of primary practical importance and has\r\nan all-pervading influence on national character. Every thing indeed\r\nconnected with this subject depends on the answer to the question, Why\r\nare we obliged to obey the laws? If we answer because we made them; or\r\nbecause we assent to them, or framed the government which enacts them;\r\nor because the good of society enjoins obedience, or reason dictates it,\r\nthen the state is a human institution; it has no religious sanction; it\r\nis founded on the sand; it ceases to have a hold on the conscience and\r\nto commend itself as a revelation of God to be reverenced and obeyed as\r\na manifestation of his presence and will. But, on the other hand, if we\r\nplace the state in the same category with the family and the church, and\r\nregard it as an institution of God, then we elevate it into a higher\r\nsphere; we invest it with religious sanctions and it become pervaded by\r\na divine presence and authority, which immeasurably strengthens, while\r\nit elevates its power. Obedience for conscience' sake is as different\r\nfrom obedience from fear, or from voluntary consent, or regard to human\r\nauthority, as the divine from the human.\r\n\r\nSuch being, as we conceive, the true doctrine concerning the nature of\r\nthe state, it is well to inquire into the necessary deductions from this\r\ndoctrine. If government be a divine institution, and obedience to the\r\nlaws a matter resting on the authority of God, it might seem to follow\r\nthat in no case could human laws be disregarded with a good conscience.\r\nThis, as we have seen, is in fact the conclusion drawn from these\r\npremises by the advocates of the doctrine \"of passive obedience.\" The\r\ncommand, however, to be subject to the higher powers is not more\r\nunlimited in its statement than the command, \"children obey your parents\r\nin all things.\" From this latter command no one draws the conclusion\r\nthat unlimited obedience is due from children to their parents. The true\r\ninference doubtless is, in both cases, that obedience is the rule, and\r\ndisobedience the exception. If in any instance a child refuse compliance\r\nwith the requisition of the parent, or a citizen with the law of the\r\nland, he must be prepared to justify such disobedience at the bar of\r\nGod. Even divine laws may in some cases be dispensed with. Those which\r\nindeed are founded on the nature of God, such as the command to love Him\r\nand our neighbor, are necessarily immutable. But those which are founded\r\non the present constitution of things, though permanent as general rules\r\nof action, may on adequate grounds, be violated without sin. The\r\ncommands, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Remember the\r\nsabbath day to keep it holy, are all of permanent authority; and yet\r\nthere may be justifiable homicide, and men may profane the sabbath and\r\nbe blameless. In like manner the command to obey the laws, is a divine\r\ninjunction, and yet there are cases in which disobedience is a duty. It\r\nbecomes then of importance to determine what these cases are; or to\r\nascertain the principles which limit the obedience which we owe to the\r\nstate. It follows from the divine institution of government that its\r\npower is limited by the design of God in its institution, and by the\r\nmoral law. The family, the church and the state are all divine\r\ninstitutions, designed for specific purposes. Each has its own sphere,\r\nand the authority belonging to each is necessarily confined within its\r\nown province. The father appears in his household as its divinely\r\nappointed head. By the command of God all the members of that household\r\nare required to yield him reverence and obedience. But he can not carry\r\nhis parental authority into the church or the state; nor can he appear\r\nin his family as a magistrate or church officer. The obedience due to\r\nhim is that which belongs to a father, and not to a civil or\r\necclesiastical officer, and his children are not required to obey him\r\nin either of those capacities. In like manner the officers of the\r\nchurch have within their sphere a divine right to rule, but they can not\r\nclaim civil authority on the ground of the general command to the people\r\nto obey those who have the care of souls. Heb. xiii: 17. As the church\r\nofficer loses his power when he enters the forum; so does the civil\r\nmagistrate when he enters the church. His right to rule is a right which\r\nbelongs to him as representing God in the state--he has no commission to\r\nrepresent God either in the family or the church; and therefore, he is\r\nentitled to no obedience if he claims an authority which does not belong\r\nto him. This is a very obvious principle, and is of wide application. It\r\nnot only limits the authority of civil officers to civil affairs, but\r\nlimits the extent due to the obedience to be rendered even in civil\r\nmatters to the officers of the state. A justice of the peace has no\r\nclaim to the obedience due to a governor of a state; nor a governor of a\r\nstate to that which belongs to the President of the Union; nor the\r\nPresident of the Union to that which may be rightfully claimed by an\r\nabsolute sovereign. A military commander has no authority over the\r\ncommunity as a civil magistrate, nor can he exercise such authority even\r\nover his subordinates. This principle applies in all its force to the\r\nlaw-making power. The legislature can not exercise any power which does\r\nnot belong to them. They can not act as judges or magistrates unless\r\nsuch authority has been actually committed to them. They are to be\r\nobeyed as legislators; and in any other capacity their decisions or\r\ncommands do not bind the conscience. And still further, their\r\nlegislative enactments have authority only when made in the exercise of\r\ntheir legitimate powers. In other words, an unconstitutional law is no\r\nlaw. If our Congress, for example, were to pass a bill creating an order\r\nof nobility, or an established church, or to change the religion of the\r\nland, or to enforce a sumptuary code, it would have no more virtue and\r\nbe entitled to no more deference than a similar enactment intended to\r\nbind the whole country passed by a town council. This we presume will\r\nnot be denied. God has committed unlimited power to no man and to no set\r\nof men, and the limitation which he has assigned to the power conferred,\r\nis to be found in the design for which it was given. That design is\r\ndetermined in the case of the family, the church and the state, by the\r\nnature of these institutions, by the general precepts of the Bible, or\r\nby the providence of God determining the peculiar constitution under\r\nwhich these organizations are called to act. The power of a parent was\r\ngreater under the old dispensation than it is now; the legitimate\r\nauthority of the church is greater under some modes of organization than\r\nunder others; and the power of the state as represented in its\r\nconstituted authorities is far more extensive in some countries than in\r\nothers. The theory of the British government is that the parliament is\r\nthe whole state in convention, and therefore it exercises powers which\r\ndo not belong to our Congress, which represents the state only for\r\ncertain specified purposes. These diversities, however, do not alter the\r\ngeneral principle, which is, that rulers are to be obeyed in the\r\nexercise of their legitimate authority; that their commmands or\r\nrequirements beyond their appropriate spheres are void of all binding\r\nforce. This is a principle which no one can dispute.\r\n\r\nA second principle is no less plain. No human authority can make it\r\nobligatory on us to commit sin. If all power is of God it can not be\r\nlegitimately used against God. This is a dictate of natural conscience,\r\nand is authenticated by the clearest teachings of the word of God. The\r\napostles when commanded to abstain from preaching Christ refused to\r\nobey, and said: \"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto\r\nyou more than unto God, judge ye.\" No human law could make it binding on\r\nthe ministers of the gospel, in our day, to withhold the message of\r\nsalvation from their fellow-men. It requires no argument to prove that\r\nmen can not make it right to worship idols, to blaspheme God, to deny\r\nChrist. It is sheer fanaticism thus to exalt the power of the government\r\nabove the authority of God. This would be to bring back upon us some of\r\nthe worst doctrines of the middle ages as to the power of the pope and\r\nof earthly sovereigns. Good men in all ages of the world have always\r\nacted on the principle that human laws can not bind the conscience when\r\nthey are in conflict with the law of God. Daniel openly, in the sight of\r\nhis enemies, prayed to the God of heaven in despite of the prohibition\r\nof his sovereign. Shadrach, Mesheck and Abednego refused to bow down, at\r\nthe command of the king, to the golden image. The early Christians\r\ndisregarded all those laws of Pagan Rome requiring them to do homage to\r\nfalse gods. Protestants with equal unanimity refused to submit to the\r\nlaws of their papal sovereigns enjoining the profession of Romish\r\nerrors. That these men were right no man, with an enlightened\r\nconscience, can deny; but they were right only on the principle that the\r\npower of the state and of the magistrate is limited by the law of God.\r\nIt follows then from the divine institution of government, that its\r\npower to bind the conscience to obedience is limited by the design of\r\nits appointment and the moral law. All its power being from God, it must\r\nbe subordinate to him. This is a doctrine which, however, for a time and\r\nin words, it may be denied, is too plain and too important not to be\r\ngenerally recognized. It is a principle too which should at all times be\r\npublicly avowed. The very sanctity of human laws requires it. Their real\r\npower and authority lie in their having a divine sanction. To claim for\r\nthem binding force when destitute of such sanction, is to set up a mere\r\nsemblance for a reality, a suit of armor with no living man within. The\r\nstability of human government and the authority of civil laws require\r\nthat they should be kept within the sphere where they repose on God, and\r\nare pervaded by his presence and power. Without him nothing human can\r\nstand. All power is of God; and if of God, divine; and if divine, in\r\naccordance with his holy law.\r\n\r\nBut who are the judges of the application of these principles? Who is to\r\ndetermine whether a particular law is unconstitutional or immoral? So\r\nfar as the mere constitutionality of a law is concerned, it may be\r\nremarked, that there is in most states, as in our own, for example, a\r\nregular judicial tribunal to which every legislative enactment can be\r\nsubmitted, and the question of its conformity to the constitution\r\nauthoritatively decided. In all ordinary cases, that is, in all cases\r\nnot involving some great principle or some question of conscience, such\r\ndecisions must be held to be final, and to bind all concerned not only\r\nto submission but obedience. A law thus sanctioned becomes instinct with\r\nall the power of the state, and further opposition brings the recusants\r\ninto conflict with the government; a conflict in which no man for light\r\nreasons can with a good conscience engage. Still it can not be denied,\r\nand ought not to be concealed, that the ultimate decision must be\r\nreferred to his own judgment. This is a necessary deduction from the\r\ndoctrine that obedience to law is a religious duty. It is a primary\r\nprinciple that the right of private judgment extends over all questions\r\nof faith and morals. No human power can come between God and the\r\nconscience. Every man must answer for his own sins, and therefore every\r\nman must have the right to determine for himself what is sin. As he can\r\nnot transfer his responsibility, he can not transfer his right of\r\njudgment. This principle has received the sanction of good men in every\r\nage of the world. Daniel judged for himself of the binding force of the\r\ncommand not to worship the true God. So did the apostles when they\r\ncontinued to preach Christ, in opposition to all the constituted\r\nauthorities. The laws passed by Pagan Rome requiring the worship of\r\nidols had the sanction of all the authorities of the empire, yet on the\r\nground of their private judgment the Christians refused to obey them.\r\nProtestants in like manner refused to obey the laws of Papal Rome,\r\nthough sustained by all the authority both of the church and state. In\r\nall these cases the right of private judgment can not be disputed. Even\r\nwhere no question of religion or morality is directly concerned, this\r\nright is undeniable. Does any one now condemn Hampden for refusing to\r\npay \"ship-money?\" Does any American condemn our ancestors for resisting\r\nthe stamp-act, though the authorities of St. Stephen's and Westminster\r\nunited in pronouncing the imposition constitutional? However this\r\nprinciple may be regarded when stated in the abstract, every individual\r\ninstinctively acts upon it in his own case. Whenever a command is issued\r\nby one in authority over us, we immediately and almost unconsciously\r\ndetermine for ourselves, first, whether he had a right to give the\r\norder; and secondly, whether it can with a good conscience be obeyed. If\r\nthis decision is clearly in the negative, we at once determine to refuse\r\nobedience on our own responsibility. Let any man test this point by an\r\nappeal to his own consciousness. Let him suppose the President of the\r\nUnited States to order him to turn Romanist or Pagan; or Congress to\r\npass a bill requiring him to blaspheme God; or a military superior to\r\ncommand him to commit treason or murder--does not his conscience tell\r\nhim he would on the instant refuse? Would he, or could he wait until the\r\nconstitutionality of such requisitions had been submitted to the courts?\r\nor if the courts should decide against him, would that at all alter the\r\ncase? Men must be strangely oblivious of the relation of the soul to\r\nGod, the instinctive sense which we possess of our allegiance to him,\r\nand of the self-evidencing power with which his voice reaches the reason\r\nand the conscience, to question the necessity which every man is under\r\nto decide all questions touching his duty to God for himself.\r\n\r\nIt may indeed be thought that this doctrine is subversive of the\r\nauthority of government. A moment's reflection is sufficient to dispel\r\nthis apprehension. The power of laws rests on two foundations, fear and\r\nconscience. Both are left by this doctrine in their integrity. The\r\nformer, because the man refuses obedience at his peril. His private\r\nconviction that the law is unconstitutional or immoral does not abrogate\r\nit, or impede its operation. If arraigned for its violation, he may\r\nplead in his justification his objections to the authority of the law.\r\nIf these objections are found valid by the competent authorities, he is\r\nacquitted; if otherwise, he suffers the penalty. What more can the state\r\nask? All the power the state, as such, can give its laws, lies in their\r\npenalty. A single decision by the ultimate authority in favor of a law,\r\nis a revelation to the whole body of the people that it can not be\r\nviolated with impunity. The sword of justice hangs over every\r\ntransgressor. The motive of fear in securing obedience, is therefore, as\r\noperative under this view of the subject, as it can be under any other.\r\nWhat, however, is of far more consequence, the power of conscience is\r\nleft in full force. Obedience to the law is a religious duty, enjoined\r\nby the word of God and enforced by conscience. If, in any case, it be\r\nwithheld, it is under a sense of responsibility to God; and under the\r\nconviction that if this conscientious objection be feigned, it\r\naggravates the guilt of disobedience as a sin against God an hundred\r\nfold; and if it be mistaken, it affords no palliation of the offense.\r\nPaul was guilty in persecuting the church, though he thought he was\r\ndoing God service. And the man, who by a perverted conscience, is led to\r\nrefuse obedience to a righteous law, stands without excuse at the bar of\r\nGod. The moral sanction of civil laws, which gives them their chief\r\npower, and without which they must ultimately become inoperative, cannot\r\npossibly extend further than this. For what is that moral sanction? It\r\nis a conviction that our duty to God requires our obedience; but how can\r\nwe feel that duty to God requires us to do what God forbids? In other\r\nwords, a law which we regard as immoral, can not present itself to the\r\nconscience as having divine authority. Conscience, therefore, is on the\r\nside of the law wherever and whenever this is possible from the nature\r\nof the case. It is a contradiction to say that conscience enforces what\r\nconscience condemns. This then is all the support which the laws of the\r\nland can possibly derive from our moral convictions. The allegiance of\r\nconscience is to God. It enforces obedience to all human laws consistent\r\nwith that allegiance; further than this it can not by possibility go.\r\nAnd as the decisions of conscience are, by the constitution of our\r\nnature, determined by our own apprehensions of the moral law, and not by\r\nauthority, it follows of necessity that every man must judge for\r\nhimself, and on his own responsibility, whether any given law of man\r\nconflicts with the law of God or not.\r\n\r\nWe would further remark on this point that the lives and property of men\r\nhave no greater protection than that which, on this theory, is secured\r\nfor the laws of the state. The law of God says: Thou shalt not kill. Yet\r\nevery man does, and must judge when and how far this law binds his\r\nconscience. It is admitted, on all hands, that there are cases in which\r\nits obligation ceases. What those cases are each man determines for\r\nhimself, but under his two fold responsibility to his country and to\r\nGod. If, through passion or any other cause, he errs as to what\r\nconstitutes justifiable homicide, he must bear the penalty attached to\r\nmurder, by the law of God and man. It is precisely so in the case before\r\nus. God has commanded us to obey the magistrate as his minister and\r\nrepresentative. If we err in our judgment as to the cases in which the\r\ncommand ceases to be binding, we fall into the hands of justice, both\r\nhuman and divine. Can more than this be necessary? Can any thing be\r\ngained by trying to make God require us to break his own commands? Can\r\nconscience be made to sanction the violation of the moral law? Is not\r\nthis the way to destroy all moral distinctions, and to prostrate the\r\nauthority of conscience, and with it the very foundation of civil\r\ngovernment? Is not all history full of the dreadful consequences of the\r\ndoctrine that human laws can make sin obligatory, and that those in\r\nauthority can judge for the people what is sin? What more than this is\r\nneeded to justify all the persecutions for righteousness' sake since the\r\nworld began? What hope could there be, on this ground, for the\r\npreservation of religion or virtue, in any nation on the earth? If the\r\nprinciple be once established, that the people are bound to obey all\r\nhuman laws, or that they are not to judge for themselves when their duty\r\nto God requires them to refuse such obedience, then there is not only an\r\nend of all civil and religious liberty, but the very nature of civil\r\ngovernment, as a divine institution, is destroyed. It becomes first\r\natheistical, and then diabolical. Then the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew's, the decrees of the French National Assembly, and the laws\r\nof Pagan Rome against Christians, and of its Papal successor against\r\nProtestants, were entitled to reverent obedience. Then, too, may any\r\ninfidel party which gains the ascendency in a state, as has happened of\r\nlate in Switzerland, render it morally obligatory upon all ministers to\r\nclose their churches, and on the people to renounce the gospel. This is\r\nnot an age or state of the world in which to advance such doctrines.\r\nThere are too many evidences of the gathering powers of evil, to render\r\nit expedient to exalt the authority of man above that of God, or\r\nemancipate men from subjection to their Master in heaven, that they may\r\nbecome more obedient to their masters on earth. We are advocating the\r\ncause of civil government, of the stability and authority of human laws,\r\nwhen we make every thing rest on the authority of God, and when we limit\r\nevery human power by subordinating it to him. We hold, therefore, that\r\nit is not only one of the plainest principles of morals, that no immoral\r\nlaw can bind the conscience, and that every man must judge of its\r\ncharacter for himself, and on his own responsibility; but that this\r\ndoctrine is essential to all religious liberty, and to the religious\r\nsanction of civil government. If you deny this principle, you thereby\r\ndeny that government is a divine institution, and denying that, you\r\ndeprive it of its vital energy, and send it tottering to a dishonored\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nBut here the great practical question arises, What is to be done when\r\nthe law of the land comes into conflict with the law of God--or, which\r\nis to us the same thing, with our convictions of what that law demands?\r\nIn answer to this question we would remark, in the first place, that in\r\nmost cases, the majority of the people have nothing to do, except\r\npeaceably to use their influence to have the law repealed. The mass of\r\nthe people have nothing actively to do with the laws. Very few\r\nenactments of the government touch one in a thousand in the population.\r\nWe may think a protective tariff not only inexpedient, but unequal and\r\ntherefore unjust. But we have nothing to do with it. We are not\r\nresponsible for it, and are not called upon to enforce it. The remark\r\napplies even to laws of a higher character, such, _e. g._ as a law\r\nproclaiming an unjust war; forbidding the introduction of the Bible into\r\npublic schools; requiring homage or sanction to be given to idolatrous\r\nservices by public officers, etc., etc. Such laws do not touch the mass\r\nof the people. They do not require them either to do or abstain from\r\ndoing, any thing which conscience forbids or enjoins; and therefore\r\ntheir duty in the premises may be limited to the use of legitimate means\r\nto have laws of which they disapprove repealed.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, those executive officers who are called upon to\r\ncarry into effect a law which requires them to do what their conscience\r\ncondemns, must resign their office, if they would do their duty to God.\r\nSome years since, General Maitland (if we remember the name correctly)\r\nof the Madras Presidency, in India, resigned a lucrative and honorable\r\npost, because he could not conscientiously give the sanction to the\r\nHindoo idolatry required by the British authorities. And within the last\r\nfew months, we have seen hundreds of Hessian officers throw up their\r\ncommissions rather than trample on the constitution of their country. On\r\nthe same principles the non-conformists in the time of Charles II. and\r\nthe ministers of the Free Church of Scotland, in our day, gave up their\r\nstipends and their positions, because they could not with a good\r\nconscience carry into effect the law of the land. It is not intended\r\nthat an executive officer should, in all cases, resign his post rather\r\nthan execute a law which in his private judgment he may regard as\r\nunconstitutional or unjust. The responsibility attaches to those who\r\nmake, and not to those who execute the laws. It is only when the act,\r\nwhich the officer is called upon to perform, involves personal\r\ncriminality, that he is called upon to decline its execution. Thus in\r\nthe case of war; a military officer is not the proper judge of its\r\njustice. That is not a question between him and the enemy, but between\r\nhis government and the hostile nation. On the supposition that war\r\nitself is not sinful, the act which the military officer is called upon\r\nto perform is not criminal, and he may with a good conscience carry out\r\nthe commands of his government, whatever may be his private opinion of\r\nthe justice of the war. All such cases no doubt are more or less\r\ncomplicated, and must be decided each on its own merits. The general\r\nprinciple, however, appears plain, that it is only when the act required\r\nof an executive officer involves personal criminality, that he is called\r\nupon to resign. This is a case that often occurs. In Romish countries,\r\nas Malta, for example, British officers have been required to do homage\r\nto the host, and on their refusal have been cashiered. An instance of\r\nthis kind occurred a few years ago, and produced a profound sensation in\r\nEngland. This was clearly a case of great injustice. The command was an\r\nunrighteous one. The duty of the officer was to resign rather than obey.\r\nHad the military authorities taken a fair view of the question, they\r\nmust have decided that the command to bow to the host, was not\r\nobligatory, because _ultra vires_. But if such an order was insisted\r\nupon, the conscientious Protestant must resign his commission.\r\n\r\nThe next question is, What is the duty of private citizens in the case\r\nsupposed, _i. e._, when the civil law either forbids them to do what God\r\ncommands, or commands them to do what God forbids? We answer, their duty\r\nis not obedience, but submission. These are different things. A law\r\nconsists of two parts, the precept and the penalty. We obey the one, and\r\nsubmit to the other. When we are required by the law to do what our\r\nconscience pronounces to be sinful, we can not obey the precept, but we\r\nare bound to submit without resistance to the penalty. We are not\r\nauthorized to abrogate the law, nor forcibly to resist its execution, no\r\nmatter how great its injustice or cruelty. On this principle holy men\r\nhave acted in all ages. The apostles did not obey the precept of the\r\nJewish laws forbidding them to preach Christ, but neither did they\r\nresist the execution of the penalty attached to the violation of those\r\nlaws. Thus it was with all the martyrs; they would not offer incense to\r\nidols, but refused not to be led to the stake. Had Cranmer, on the\r\nground of the iniquity of the law condemning him to death, killed the\r\nofficers who came to carry it into effect, he would have been guilty of\r\nmurder. Here is the great difference which is often overlooked. The\r\nright of self-defense is appealed to as justifying resistance even to\r\ndeath, against all attempts to deprive us of our liberty. We have this\r\nright in reference to unauthorized individuals, but not in reference to\r\nthe officers of the law. Had men without authority entered Cranmer's\r\nhouse, and attempted to take his life, his resistance, even if attended\r\nwith the loss of life, would have been justifiable. But no man has the\r\nright to resist the execution of the law. What could be more iniquitous\r\nthan the laws condemning men to death for the worship of God. Yet to\r\nthese laws Christians and Protestants yielded unresisting submission.\r\nThis is an obvious duty, flowing from the divine institution of\r\ngovernment. There is no power but of God, and the powers that be are\r\nordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power resisteth the\r\nordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves\r\ndamnation. Thus Paul reasoned. If the power is of God, it can not be\r\nrightfully resisted; it must be obeyed or submitted to. Are wicked,\r\ntyrannical, Pagan powers of God? Certainly they are. Does not he order\r\nall things? Does any man become a king without God's permission granted\r\nin mercy or in judgment? Was not Nero to be recognized as emperor? Would\r\nit not be a sin to refuse submission to Nicholas of Russia, or to the\r\nSultan of Turkey? Are rulers to be obeyed only for their goodness? Is it\r\nonly kind and reasonable masters, parents, or husbands, who are to be\r\nrecognized as such? It is no doubt true, that in no case is unlimited\r\nauthority granted to men; and that obedience to the precepts of our\r\nsuperiors is limited by the nature of their office, and by the moral\r\nlaw; but this leaves their authority untouched, and the obligation to\r\nsubmission where we can not obey, unimpaired.\r\n\r\nHave we then got back to the old doctrine of \"passive obedience\" by\r\nanother route? Not at all. The scriptural rule above recited relates to\r\nindividuals. It prescribes the duty of submission even to unjust and\r\nwicked laws, on the part of men in their separate capacity; but it does\r\nnot deny the right of revolution as existing in the community. What the\r\nScriptures forbid, is that any man should undertake to resist the law.\r\nThey do not forbid either change in the laws or change in the\r\ngovernment. There is an obvious difference between these two things,\r\nviz: the right of resistance on the part of individuals, and the right\r\nof revolution on the part of the people. This latter right we argue from\r\nthe divine institution of government itself. God has revealed his will\r\nthat government should exist, but he has not prescribed the form which\r\nit shall assume. In other words, he has commanded men to organize such\r\ngovernment, but has left the form to be determined by themselves. This\r\nis a necessary inference. It follows from the mere silence of Scripture\r\nand nature on this subject, that it is left free to the determination of\r\nthose to whom the general command is given. In the next place, this\r\nright is to be inferred from the design of civil government. That design\r\nis the welfare of the people. It is the promotion of their physical and\r\nmoral improvement; the security of life and property; the punishment of\r\nevil doers, and the praise of those who do well. If such is the end\r\nwhich God designs government to answer, it must be his will that it\r\nshould be made to accomplish that purpose, and consequently that it may\r\nbe changed from time to time, so as to secure that end. No one form of\r\ngovernment is adapted to all states of society, any more than one suit\r\nof clothes is proper to all stages of life. The end for which clothing\r\nis designed, supposes the right to adapt it to that end. In like manner\r\nthe end government is intended to answer, supposes the right to modify\r\nit whenever such modification is necessary. If God commands men to\r\naccomplish certain ends, and does not prescribe the means, he does\r\nthereby leave the choice of the means to their discretion. And any\r\ninstitution which fails to accomplish the end intended by it, if it has\r\nnot a divine sanction as to its form, may lawfully be so changed as to\r\nsuit the purpose for which it was appointed. We hold, therefore, that\r\nthe people have, by divine right, the authority to change, not only\r\ntheir rulers, but their form of government, whenever the one or the\r\nother, instead of promoting the well-being of the community, is unjust\r\nor injurious. This is a right which, like all other prerogatives, may be\r\nexercised unwisely, capriciously, or even unjustly, but still it is not\r\nto be denied. It has been recognized and exercised in all ages of the\r\nworld, and with the sanction of the best of men. It is as unavoidable\r\nand healthful as the changes in the body to adapt it to the increasing\r\nvigor of the mind, in its progress from infancy to age. The progress of\r\nsociety depends on the exercise of this right. It is impossible that its\r\npowers should be developed, if it were to be forever wrapt up in its\r\nswaddling clothes, or coffined as a mummy. The early Christians\r\nsubmitted quietly to the unjust laws of their Pagan oppressors, until\r\nthe mass of the community became Christians, and then they\r\nrevolutionized the government. Protestants acted in the same way with\r\ntheir papal rulers. So did our forefathers, and so may any people whose\r\nform of government no longer answers the end for which God has commanded\r\ncivil government to be instituted. The Quakers are now a minority in all\r\nthe countries in which they exist, and furnish an edifying example of\r\nsubmission to the laws which they can not conscientiously obey. But\r\nshould they come, in any political society, to be the controlling\r\npower, it is plain they would have the right to conduct it on their own\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThe right of revolution therefore is really embedded in the right to\r\nserve God. A government which interferes with that service, which\r\ncommands what God forbids, or forbids what he commands, we are bound by\r\nour duty to him to change as soon as we have the power. If this is not\r\nso, then God has subjected his people to the necessity of always\r\nsubmitting to punishment for obeying his commands, and has cut them off\r\nfrom the only means which can insure their peaceful and secure enjoyment\r\nof the liberty to do his will. No one, however, in our land, or of the\r\nrace to which we belong, will be disposed to question the right of the\r\npeople to change their form of government. Our history forbids all\r\ndiversity of sentiment on this subject. We are only concerned to show\r\nthat the scriptural doctrine of civil government is perfectly consistent\r\nwith that right; or rather that the right is one of the logical\r\ndeductions from that doctrine.\r\n\r\nWe have thus endeavored to prove that government is a divine\r\ninstitution; that obedience to the laws is a religious duty; that such\r\nobedience is due in all cases in which it can be rendered with a good\r\nconscience; that when obedience can not be yielded without sinning\r\nagainst God, then our duty as individuals is quietly to submit to the\r\ninfliction of the penalty attached to disobedience; and that the right\r\nof resistance or of revolution rests only in the body of people for\r\nwhose benefit government is instituted.\r\n\r\nThe application of these principles to the case of the fugitive slave\r\nlaw is so obvious, as hardly to justify remark. The great body of the\r\npeople regard that law as consistent with the constitution of the\r\ncountry and the law of God. Their duty, therefore, in the premises,\r\nwhether they think it wise or unwise, is perfectly plain. Those who take\r\nthe opposite view of the law, having in the great majority of cases,\r\nnothing to do with enforcing it, are in no measure responsible for it.\r\nTheir duty is limited to the use of peaceable and constitutional means\r\nto get it repealed. A large part of the people of this country thought\r\nthe acquisition of Louisiana; the admission of Texas into the Union by a\r\nsimple resolution; the late Mexican war; were either unjust or\r\nunconstitutional, but there was no resistance to these measures. None\r\nwas made, and none would have been justifiable. So in the present case,\r\nas the people generally are not called upon either to do, or to forbear\r\nfrom doing, any thing their conscience forbids, all resistance to the\r\noperation of this law on their part must be without excuse. With regard\r\nto the executive officers, whose province it is to carry the law into\r\neffect, though some of them may disapprove of it as unwise, harsh, or\r\noppressive, still they are bound to execute it, unless they believe the\r\nspecific act which they are called upon to perform involves personal\r\ncriminality, and then their duty is the resignation of their office, and\r\nnot resistance to the law. There is the most obvious difference between\r\nan officer being called upon, for example, to execute a decision of a\r\ncourt, which in his private opinion he thinks unjust, and his being\r\ncalled upon to blaspheme, or commit murder. The latter involves personal\r\nguilt, the former does not. He is not the judge of the equity or\r\npropriety of the decision which he is required to carry into effect. It\r\nis evident that the wheels of society would be stopped, if every officer\r\nof the government, and every minister of justice should feel that he is\r\nauthorized to sit in judgment on the wisdom or righteousness of any law\r\nhe was called upon to execute. He is responsible for his own acts, and\r\nnot for the judgments of others, and therefore when the execution of a\r\nlaw or of a command of a superior does not require him to sin, he is\r\nfree to obey.\r\n\r\nAgain, in those cases in which we, as private individuals, may be called\r\nupon to assist in carrying the fugitive slave law into effect, if we can\r\nnot obey, we must do as the Quakers have long done with regard to our\r\nmilitary laws, _i. e._ quietly submit. We have no right to resist, or in\r\nany way to impede the operation of the law. Whatever sin there is in it,\r\ndoes not rest on us, any more than the sin of our military system rests\r\non the Quakers.[259]\r\n\r\nAnd finally as regards the fugitives themselves, their obvious duty is\r\nsubmission. To them the law must appear just as the laws of the Pagans\r\nagainst Christians, or of Romanists against Protestants, appeared to\r\nthose who suffered from them. And the duty in both cases is the same.\r\nHad the martyrs put to death the officers of the law, they would in the\r\nsight of God and man have been guilty of murder. And any one who teaches\r\nfugitive slaves to resort to violence even to the sacrifice of life, in\r\nresisting the law in question, it seems to us, is guilty of exciting men\r\nto murder. As before remarked, the principle of self-defense does not\r\napply in this case. Is there no difference between a man who kills an\r\nassassin who attempts his life on the highway, and the man who, though\r\nknowing himself to be innocent of the crime for which he has been\r\ncondemned to die, should kill the officers of justice? The former is a\r\ncase of justifiable homicide, the other is a case of murder. The\r\nofficers of justice are not the offenders. They are not the persons\r\nresponsible for the law or the decision. That responsibility rests on\r\nthe government. Private vengeance can not reach the state. And if it\r\ncould, such vengeance is not the remedy ordained by God for such evils.\r\nThey are to be submitted to, until the government can be changed. How\r\ndid our Lord act when he was condemned by an oppressive judgment, and\r\nwith wicked hands crucified and slain? Did he kill the Roman soldiers?\r\nHas not he left us an example that we should follow his steps: who did\r\nno sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who, when he was reviled,\r\nreviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed\r\nhimself unto him that judgeth righteously. On this principle did all his\r\nholy martyrs act; and on this principle are we bound to act in\r\nsubmitting to the laws of the land, even when we deem them oppressive or\r\nunjust.\r\n\r\nThe principles advocated in this paper appear to us so elementary, that\r\nwe feel disposed to apologize for presenting them in such a formal\r\nmanner. But every generation has to learn the alphabet for itself. And\r\nthe mass of men are so occupied with other matters, that they do not\r\ngive themselves time to discriminate. Their judgments are dictated, in\r\nmany cases, by their feelings, or their circumstances. One man simply\r\nlooks to the hardship of forcing a slave back to bondage, and he\r\nimpulsively counsels resistance unto blood. Another looks to the evils\r\nwhich follow from resistance to law, and he asserts that human laws are\r\nin all cases to be obeyed. Both are obviously wrong. Both would\r\noverthrow all government. The one by justifying every man's taking the\r\nlaw into his own hands; and the other by destroying the authority of\r\nGod, which is the only foundation on which human government can rest. It\r\nis only by acting on the direction of the Divine Wisdom incarnate:\r\n\"Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things\r\nthat are God's,\" that these destructive extremes are to be avoided.\r\nGovernment is a divine institution; obedience to the laws is commanded\r\nby God; and yet like all other divine commands of the same class, there\r\nare cases in which it ceases to be obligation. Of these cases every one\r\nmust judge for himself on his own responsibility to God and man; but\r\nwhen he cannot obey, his duty is to submit. The divinely appointed\r\nremedy for unjust or oppressive legislation is not private or tumultuous\r\nopposition, but the repeal of unrighteous enactments, or the\r\nreorganization of the government.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, we have had most at heart in the preparation of this\r\narticle, is the exhibition of the great principle that all authority\r\nreposes on God; that all our obligations terminate on him; that\r\ngovernment is not a mere voluntary compact, and obedience to law an\r\nobligation which rests on the consent of the governed. We regard this as\r\na matter of primary importance. The character of men and of communities\r\ndepends, to a great extent on their faith. The theory of morals which\r\nthey adopt determines their moral charactcter. If they assume that\r\nexpediency is the rule of duty, that a thing is right because it\r\nproduces happiness, or wrong because it produces misery, that this\r\ntendency is not merely the test between right and wrong, but the ground\r\nof the distinction, then, the specific idea of moral excellence and\r\nobligation is lost. All questions of duty are merged into a calculation\r\nof profit and loss. There is no sense of God; reason or society takes\r\nhis place, and an irreligious, calculating cast of character is the\r\ninevitable result. This is counteracted, in individuals and the\r\ncommunity by various causes, for neither the character of a man nor that\r\nof a society is determined by any one opinion; but its injurious\r\ninfluence may nevertheless be most manifest and deplorable. No man can\r\nfail to see the deteriorating influence of this theory of morals on\r\npublic character both in this country and in England. If we would make\r\nmen religious and moral, instead of merely cute, let us place God before\r\nthem; let us teach them that his will is the ground of their\r\nobligations; that they are responsible to him for all their acts; that\r\ntheir allegiance as moral agents is not to reason or to society, but to\r\nthe heart-searching God; that the obligation to obey the laws of the\r\nland does not rest on their consent to them, but to the fact government\r\nis of God; that those who resist the magistrate, resist the ordinance of\r\nGod, and that they who resist, shall receive unto themselves damnation.\r\nThis is the only doctrine which can give stablity either to morals or to\r\ngovernment. Man's allegiance is not to reason in the abstract, nor to\r\nsociety, but to a personal God, who has power to destroy both soul and\r\nbody in hell. This is a law revealed in the constitution of our nature,\r\nas well as by the lips of Christ. And to no other sovereign can the soul\r\nyield rational obedience. We might as well attempt to substitute some\r\nmechanical contrivance of our own, for the law of gravitation, as a\r\nmeans of keeping the planets in their orbits, as to expect to govern men\r\nby any thing else than the fear of an Infinite God.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[258] In the _New York Independent_ for January 2, 1851, there is a\r\nsermon delivered by Rev. Richard S. Storrs, Jr., of Brooklyn, Dec. 12,\r\n1850, in which his opposition to the fugitive slave bill is expressly\r\nplaced on the injustice of slavery. He argues the matter almost\r\nexclusively on that ground. \"To what,\" he asks, \"am I required to send\r\nthis man [the slave] back? To a system which . . . no man can contemplate\r\nwithout shuddering.\" Again, \"Why shall I send the man to this unjust\r\nbondage? The fact that he has suffered it so long already is a reason\r\nwhy I should NOT. . . . . Why shall I not HELP him, in his struggle for\r\nthe rights which God gave him indelibly, when he made him a man? There\r\nis nothing to prevent, but the simple requirement of my equals in the\r\nState; the parchment of the law, which they have written.\" This is an\r\nargument against the Constitution and not against the fugitive slave\r\nlaw. It is an open refusal to comply with one of the stipulations of our\r\nnational compact. If it has any force, it is in favor of the dissolution\r\nof the Union. Nay, if the argument is sound it makes the dissolution of\r\nthe Union inevitable and obligatory. It should, therefore, in all\r\nfairness be presented in that light, and not as an argument against the\r\nlaw of Congress. Let it be understood that the ground now assumed is\r\nthat the Constitution can not be complied with. Let it be seen that the\r\nmoralists of our day have discovered that the compact framed by our\r\nfathers, which all our public men in the general and state governments\r\nhave sworn to support, under which we have lived sixty years, and whose\r\nfruits we have so abundantly enjoyed, is an immoral compact, and must be\r\nrepudiated out of duty to God. This is the real doctrine constantly\r\npresented in the abolition prints; and if properly understood we should\r\nsoon see to what extent it commends itself to the judgment and\r\nconscience of the people.\r\n\r\n[259] The doctrine that the executive officers of a government are not\r\nthe responsible judges of the justice of its decisions, is perfectly\r\nconsistent with the principle advanced above, viz: that every man has\r\nthe right to judge for himself whether any law or command is obligatory.\r\nThis latter principle relates to acts for which we are personally\r\nresponsible. If a military officer is commanded to commit treason or\r\nmurder, he is bound to refuse; because those acts are morally wrong. But\r\nif commanded to lead an army against an enemy he is bound to obey, for\r\nthat is not morally wrong. He is the judge of his own act, but not of\r\nthe act of the government in declaring the war. So a sheriff, if he\r\nthinks all capital punishment a violation of God's law, he can not carry\r\na sentence of death into effect, because the act itself is sinful in his\r\nview. But he is not the judge of the justice of any particular sentence\r\nhe is called on to execute. He may judge of his own part of the\r\ntransaction: but he is not responsible for the act of the judge and the\r\njury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIBLE ARGUMENT ON SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n          BY CHARLES HODGE, D.D.,\r\n                         OF PRINCETON, N.

It is now the most exciting topic of\r\ndiscussion. Nor is the excitement in society confined to discussion\r\nalone. Designs and plans, of the most reprehensible character, are\r\nboldly avowed and defended. What has produced this lamentable state of\r\nthings? No doubt many circumstances have combined in its production. We\r\nthink, however, that all impartial observers must acknowledge, that by\r\nfar the most prominent cause is the conduct of the abolitionists. . . . .\r\nNor is it by argument that the abolitionists have produced the present\r\nunhappy excitement. Argument has not been the characteristic of their\r\npublications. Denunciations of slaveholding, as manstealing, robbery,\r\npiracy, and worse than murder; consequent vituperation of slaveholders\r\nas knowingly guilty of the worst of crimes; passionate appeals to the\r\nfeelings of the inhabitants of the Northern States; gross exaggerations\r\nof the moral and physical condition of the slaves, have formed the\r\nstaple of their addresses to the public.[260] We do not mean to say\r\nthat there has been no calm and Christian discussion of the subject. We\r\nmean merely to state what has, to the best of our knowledge, been the\r\npredominent character of the anti-slavery publications. There is one\r\ncircumstance which renders the error and guilt of this course of conduct\r\nchargeable, in a great measure, on the abolitionists as a body, and even\r\nupon those of their number who have pursued a different course. We refer\r\nto the fact that they have upheld the most extreme publications, and\r\nmade common cause with the most reckless declaimers. The wildest ravings\r\nof the _Liberator_ have been constantly lauded; agents have been\r\ncommissioned whose great distinction was a talent for eloquent\r\nvituperation; coincidence of opinion as to the single point of immediate\r\nemancipation has been sufficient to unite men of the most discordant\r\ncharacter. There is in this conduct such a strange want of adaptation\r\nbetween the means and the end which they profess to have in view, as to\r\nstagger the faith of most persons in the sincerity of their professions,\r\nwho do not consider the extremes to which even good men may be carried,\r\nwhen they allow one subject to take exclusive possession of their minds.\r\nWe do not doubt their sincerity, but we marvel at their delusion. They\r\nseem to have been led by the mere impulse of feeling, and a blind\r\nimitation of their predecessors in England, to a course of measures,\r\nwhich, though rational under one set of circumstances, is the hight of\r\ninfatuation under another. The English abolitionists addressed\r\nthemselves to a community, which, though it owned no slaves, had the\r\npower to abolish slavery, and was therefore responsible for its\r\ncontinuance. Their object was to rouse that community to immediate\r\naction. For this purpose they addressed themselves to the feelings of\r\nthe people; they portrayed in the strongest colors the misery of the\r\nslaves; they dilated on the gratuitous crime of which England was guilty\r\nin perpetuating slavery, and did all they could to excite the passions\r\nof the public. This was the course most likely to succeed, and it did\r\nsucceed. Suppose, however, that the British parliament had no power over\r\nthe subject; that it rested entirely with the colonial Assemblies to\r\ndecide whether slavery should be abolished or not. Does any man believe\r\nthe abolitionists would have gained their object? Did they in fact make\r\nconverts of the planters? Did they even pretend that such was their\r\ndesign? Every one knows that their conduct produced a state of almost\r\nfrantic excitement in the West India Islands; that so far from the\r\npublic feeling in England producing a moral impression upon the planters\r\nfavorable to the condition of the slaves, its effect was directly the\r\nreverse. It excited them to drive away the missionaries, to tear down\r\nthe chapels, to manifest a determination to rivet still more firmly the\r\nchains on their helpless captives, and to resist to the utmost all\r\nattempts for their emancipation or even improvement. All this was\r\nnatural, though it was all, under the circumstances, of no avail, except\r\nto rouse the spirit of the mother country, and to endanger the result of\r\nthe experiment of emancipation, by exasperating the feelings of the\r\nslaves. Precisely similar has been the result of the efforts of the\r\nAmerican abolitionists as regards the slaveholders of America. They have\r\nproduced a state of alarming exasperation at the South, injurious to the\r\nslave and dangerous to the country, while they have failed to enlist the\r\nfeelings of the North. This failure has resulted, not so much from\r\ndiversity of opinion on the abstract question of slavery; or from want\r\nof sympathy among Northern men in the cause of human rights, as from the\r\nfact, that the common sense of the public has been shocked by the\r\nincongruity and folly of hoping to effect the abolition of slavery in\r\none country, by addressing the people of another. We do not expect to\r\nabolish despotism in Russia, by getting up indignation meetings in New\r\nYork. Yet for all the purposes of legislation on this subject, Russia is\r\nnot more a foreign country to us than South Carolina. The idea of\r\ninducing the Southern slaveholder to emancipate his slaves by\r\ndenunciation, is about as rational as to expect the sovereigns of Europe\r\nto grant free institutions, by calling them tyrants and robbers. Could\r\nwe send our denunciations of despotism among the subjects of those\r\nmonarchs, and rouse the people to a sense of their wrongs and a\r\ndetermination to redress them, there would be some prospect of success.\r\nBut our Northern abolitionists disclaim, with great earnestness, all\r\nintention of allowing their appeals to reach the ears of the slaves. It\r\nis, therefore, not to be wondered at, that the course pursued by the\r\nanti-slavery societies, should produce exasperation at the South,\r\nwithout conciliating sympathy at the North. The impolicy of their\r\nconduct is so obvious, that men who agree with them as to all their\r\nleading principles, not only stand aloof from their measures, but\r\nunhesitatingly condemn their conduct. This is the case with Dr.\r\nChanning. Although his book was written rather to repress the feeling of\r\nopposition to these societies, than to encourage it, yet he fully admits\r\nthe justice of the principal charges brought against them. We extract a\r\nfew passages on the subject. \"The abolitionists have done wrong, I\r\nbelieve; nor is their wrong to be winked at, because done fanatically,\r\nor with good intentions; for how much mischief may be wrought with good\r\ndesigns! They have fallen into the common error of enthusiasts, that of\r\nexaggerating their object, of feeling as if no evil existed but that\r\nwhich they opposed, and as if no guilt could be compared with that of\r\ncountenancing and upholding it. The tone of their newspapers, as far as\r\nI have seen them, has often been fierce, bitter, and abusive.\" p. 133.\r\n\"Another objection to their movements is, that they have sought to\r\naccomplish their object by a system of agitation; that is, by a system\r\nof affiliated societies gathered, and held together, and extended, by\r\npassionate eloquence.\" \"The abolitionists might have formed an\r\nassociation; but it should have been an elective one. Men of strong\r\nprinciples, judiciousness, sobriety, should have been carefully sought\r\nas members. Much good might have been accomplished by the co-operation\r\nof such philanthropists. Instead of this, the abolitionists sent forth\r\ntheir orators, some of them transported with fiery zeal, to sound the\r\nalarm against slavery through the land, to gather together young and\r\nold, pupils from schools, females hardly arrived at years of discretion,\r\nthe ignorant, the excitable, the impetuous, and to organize these into\r\nassociations for the battle against oppression. Very unhappily they\r\npreached their doctrine to the colored people, and collected these into\r\nsocieties.[261] To this mixed and excitable multitude, minute,\r\nheartrending descriptions of slavery were given in the piercing tones of\r\npassion; and slaveholders were held up as monsters of cruelty and\r\ncrime.\" p. 136. \"The abolitionists often speak of Luther's vehemence as\r\na model to future reformers. But who, that has read history, does not\r\nknow that Luther's reformation was accompanied by tremendous miseries\r\nand crimes, and that its progress was soon arrested? and is there not\r\nreason to fear, that the fierce, bitter, persecuting spirit, which he\r\nbreathed into the work, not only tarnished its glory, but limited its\r\npower? One great principle which we should lay down as immovably true,\r\nis, that if a good work can not be carried on by the calm,\r\nself-controlled, benevolent spirit of Christianity, then the time for\r\ndoing it has not come. God asks not the aid of our vices. He can\r\noverrule them for good, but they are not to be chosen instruments of\r\nhuman happiness.\" p. 138. \"The adoption of the common system of\r\nagitation by the abolitionists has proved signally unsuccessful. From\r\nthe beginning it created alarm in the considerate, and strengthened the\r\nsympathies of the free States with the slaveholder. It made converts of\r\na few individuals, but alienated multitudes. Its influence at the South\r\nhas been evil without mixture.[262] It has stirred up bitter passions\r\nand a fierce fanaticism, which have shut every ear and every heart\r\nagainst its arguments and persuasions. These effects are the more to be\r\ndeplored, because the hope of freedom to the slaves lies chiefly in the\r\ndispositions of his master. The abolitionist indeed proposed to convert\r\nthe slaveholders; and for this end he approached them with vituperation,\r\nand exhausted on them the vocabulary of abuse! And he has reaped as he\r\nsowed.\" p. 142.\r\n\r\nUnmixed good or evil, however, in such a world as ours, is a very rare\r\nthing. Though the course pursued by the abolitionists has produced a\r\ngreat preponderance of mischief, it may incidentally occasion no little\r\ngood. It has rendered it incumbent on every man to endeavor to obtain,\r\nand, as far as he can, to communicate definite opinions and correct\r\nprinciples on the whole subject. The community are very apt to sink down\r\ninto indifference to a state of things of long continuance, and to\r\ncontent themselves with vague impressions as to right and wrong on\r\nimportant points, when there is no call for immediate action. From this\r\nstate the abolitionists have effectually roused the public mind. The\r\nsubject of slavery is no longer one on which men are allowed to be of no\r\nmind at all. The question is brought up before all of our public bodies,\r\ncivil and religious. Almost every ecclesiastical society has in some\r\nway been called to express an opinion on the subject; and these calls\r\nare constantly repeated. Under these circumstances, it is the duty of\r\nall in their appropriate sphere, to seek for truth, and to utter it in\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\"The first question,\" says Dr. Channing, \"to be proposed by a rational\r\nbeing, is not what is profitable, but what is right. Duty must be\r\nprimary, prominent, most conspicuous, among the objects of human thought\r\nand pursuit. If we cast it down from its supremacy, if we inquire first\r\nfor our interests and then for our duties we shall certainly err. We can\r\nnever see the right clearly and fully, but by making it our first\r\nconcern. . . . Right is the supreme good, and includes all other goods.\r\nIn seeking and adhering to it, we secure our true and only happiness.\r\nAll prosperity, not founded on it, is built on sand. If human affairs\r\nare controlled, as we believe, by almighty rectitude and impartial\r\ngoodness, then to hope for happiness from wrong doing is as insane as to\r\nseek health and prosperity by rebelling against the laws of nature, by\r\nsowing our seed on the ocean, or making poison our common food. There is\r\nbut one unfailing good; and that is, fidelity to the everlasting law\r\nwritten on the heart, and re-written and re-published in God's word.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever places this faith in the everlasting law of rectitude must, of\r\ncourse, regard the question of slavery, first, and chiefly, as a moral\r\nquestion. All other considerations will weigh little with him compared\r\nwith its moral character and moral influences. The following remarks,\r\ntherefore, are designed to aid the reader in forming a just moral\r\njudgment of slavery. Great truths, inalienable rights, everlasting\r\nduties, these will form the chief subjects of this discussion. There are\r\ntimes when the assertion of great principles is the best service a man\r\ncan render society. The present is a moment of bewildering excitement,\r\nwhen men's minds are stormed and darkened by strong passions and fierce\r\nconflicts; and also a moment of absorbing worldliness, when the moral\r\nlaw is made to bow to expediency, and its high and strict requirements\r\nare decried or dismissed as metaphysical abstractions, or impracticable\r\ntheories. At such a season to utter great principles without passion,\r\nand in the spirit of unfeigned and universal good will, and to engrave\r\nthem deeply and durably on men's minds, is to do more for the world,\r\nthan to open mines of wealth, or to frame the most successful schemes of\r\npolicy.\"\r\n\r\nNo man can refuse assent to these principles. The great question,\r\ntherefore, in relation to slavery is, what is right? What are the moral\r\nprinciples which should control our opinions and conduct in regard to\r\nit? Before attempting an answer to this question, it is proper to\r\nremark, that we recognize no authoritative rule of truth and duty but\r\nthe word of God. Plausible as may be the arguments deduced from general\r\nprinciples to prove a thing to be true or false, right and wrong, there\r\nis almost always room for doubt and honest diversity of opinion. Clear\r\nas we may think the arguments against despotism, there ever have been\r\nthousands of enlightened and good men, who honestly believe it to be of\r\nall forms of government the best and most acceptable to God. Unless we\r\ncan approach the consciences of men, clothed with some more imposing\r\nauthority than that of our own opinions and arguments, we shall gain\r\nlittle permanent influence. Men are too nearly upon a par as to their\r\npowers of reasoning, and ability to discover truth, to make the\r\nconclusions of one mind an authoritative rule for others. It is our\r\nobject, therefore, not to discuss the subject of slavery upon abstract\r\nprinciples, but to ascertain the scriptural rule of judgment and conduct\r\nin relation to it. We do not intend to enter upon any minute or extended\r\nexamination of scriptural passages, because all that we wish to assume,\r\nas to the meaning of the word of God, is so generally admitted as to\r\nrender the labored proof of it unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt is on all hands acknowledged that, at the time of the advent of Jesus\r\nChrist, slavery in its worst forms prevailed over the whole world. The\r\nSaviour found it around him in Judea; the apostles met with it in Asia,\r\nGreece and Italy. How did they treat it? Not by the denunciation of\r\nslaveholding as necessarily and universally sinful. Not by declaring\r\nthat all slaveholders were men-stealers and robbers, and consequently to\r\nbe excluded from the church and the kingdom of heaven. Not by insisting\r\non immediate emancipation. Not by appeals to the passions of men on the\r\nevils of slavery, or by the adoption of a system of universal agitation.\r\nOn the contrary, it was by teaching the true nature, dignity, equality\r\nand destiny of men; by inculcating the principles of justice and love;\r\nand by leaving these principles to produce their legitimate effects in\r\nameliorating the condition of all classes of society. We need not stop\r\nto prove that such was the course pursued by our Saviour and his\r\napostles, because the fact is in general acknowledged, and various\r\nreasons are assigned, by the abolitionists and others, to account for\r\nit. The subject is hardly alluded to by Christ in any of his personal\r\ninstructions. The apostles refer to it, not to pronounce upon it as a\r\nquestion of morals, put to prescribe the relative duties of masters and\r\nslaves. They caution those slaves who have believing or Christian\r\nmasters, not to despise them because they were on a perfect religious\r\nequality with them, but to consider the fact that their masters were\r\ntheir brethren, as an additional reason for obedience. It is remarkable\r\nthat there is not even an exhortation to masters to liberate their\r\nslaves, much less is it urged as an imperative and immediate duty. They\r\nare commanded to be kind, merciful and just; and to remember that they\r\nhave a Master in heaven. Paul represents this relation as of\r\ncomparatively little account: \"Let every man abide in the same calling\r\nwherein he was called. Art thou called being a servant (or slave), care\r\nnot for it; though, should the opportunity of freedom be presented,\r\nembrace it. These external relations, however, are of little importance,\r\nfor every Christian is a freeman in the highest and best sense of the\r\nword, and at the same time is under the strongest bonds to Christ,\" 1\r\nCor. vii: 20-22. It is not worth while to shut our eyes to these facts.\r\nThey will remain, whether we refuse to see them and be instructed by\r\nthem or not. If we are wiser, better, more courageous than Christ and\r\nhis apostles, let us say so; but it will do no good, under a paroxysm of\r\nbenevolence, to attempt to tear the Bible to pieces, or to exhort, by\r\nviolent exegesis, a meaning foreign to its obvious sense. Whatever\r\ninferences may be fairly deducible from the fact, the fact itself can\r\nnot be denied that Christ and his inspired followers did treat the\r\nsubject of slavery in the manner stated above. This being the case, we\r\nought carefully to consider their conduct in this respect, and inquire\r\nwhat lessons that conduct should teach us.\r\n\r\nWe think no one will deny that the plan adopted by the Saviour and his\r\nimmediate followers must be the correct plan, and therefore obligatory\r\nupon us, unless it can be shown that their circumstances were so\r\ndifferent from ours, as to make the rule of duty different in the two\r\ncases. The obligation to point out and establish this difference, rests\r\nof course upon those who have adopted a course diametrically the reverse\r\nof that which Christ pursued. They have not acquitted themselves of\r\nthis obligation. They do not seem to have felt it necessary to\r\nreconcile their conduct with his; nor does it appear to have occurred to\r\nthem, that their violent denunciations of slaveholding and of\r\nslaveholders is an indirect reflection on his wisdom, virtue, or\r\ncourage. If the present course of the abolitionists is right, then the\r\ncourse of Christ and the apostles were wrong. For the circumstances of\r\nthe two cases are, as far as we can see, in all essential particulars,\r\nthe same. They appeared as teachers of morality and religion, not as\r\npoliticians. The same is the fact with our abolitionists. They found\r\nslavery authorized by the laws of the land. So do we. They were called\r\nupon to receive into the communion of the Christian Church, both slave\r\nowners and slaves. So are we. They instructed these different classes of\r\npersons as to their respective duties. So do we. Where then is the\r\ndifference between the two cases? If we are right in insisting that\r\nslaveholding is one of the greatest of all sins; that it should be\r\nimmediately and universally abandoned as a condition of church\r\ncommunion, or admission into heaven, how comes it that Christ and his\r\napostles did not pursue the same course? We see no way of escape from\r\nthe conclusion that the conduct of the modern abolitionists, being\r\ndirectly opposed to that of the authors of our religion, must be wrong\r\nand ought to be modified or abandoned.\r\n\r\nAn equally obvious deduction from the fact above referred to, is, that\r\nslaveholding is not necessarily sinful. The assumption of the contrary\r\nis the great reason why the modern abolitionists have adopted their\r\npeculiar course. They argue thus: slaveholding is under all\r\ncircumstances sinful, it must, therefore, under all circumstances, and\r\nat all hazards, be immediately abandoned. This reasoning is perfectly\r\nconclusive. If there is error any where, it is in the premises, and not\r\nin the deduction. It requires no argument to show that sin ought to be\r\nat once abandoned. Every thing, therefore, is conceded which the\r\nabolitionists need require, when it is granted that slaveholding is in\r\nitself a crime. But how can this assumption be reconciled with the\r\nconduct of Christ and the apostles? Did they shut their eyes to the\r\nenormities of a great offence against God and man? Did they temporize\r\nwith a henious evil, because it was common and popular? Did they abstain\r\nfrom even exhorting masters to emancipate their slaves, though an\r\nimperative duty, from fear of consequences? Did they admit the\r\nperpetrators of the greatest crimes to the Christian communion? Who\r\nwill undertake to charge the blessed Redeemer and his inspired followers\r\nwith such connivance at sin, and such fellowship with iniquity? Were\r\ndrunkards, murderers, liars, and adulterers thus treated? Were they\r\npassed over without even an exhortation to forsake their sins? Were they\r\nrecognized as Christians? It can not be that slaveholding belongs to the\r\nsame category with these crimes; and to assert the contrary, is to\r\nassert that Christ is the minister of sin.\r\n\r\nThis is a point of so much importance, lying as it does at the very\r\nfoundation of the whole subject, that it deserves to be attentively\r\nconsidered. The grand mistake, as we apprehend, of those who maintain\r\nthat slaveholding is itself a crime, is, that they do not discriminate\r\nbetween slaveholding in itself considered, and its accessories at any\r\nparticular time or place. Because masters may treat their slaves\r\nunjustly, or governments make oppressive laws in relation to them, is no\r\nmore a valid argument against the lawfulness of slaveholding, than the\r\nabuse of parental authority, or the unjust political laws of certain\r\nstates, is an argument against the lawfulness of the parental relation,\r\nor of civil government. This confusion of points so widely distinct,\r\nappears to us to run through almost all the popular publications on\r\nslavery, and to vitiate their arguments. Mr. Jay, for example, quotes\r\nthe second article of the constitution of the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, which declares that \"slaveholding is a heinous crime in the\r\nsight of God,\" and then, to justify this declaration, makes large\r\ncitations from the laws of the several Southern States, to show what the\r\nsystem of slavery is in this country, and concludes by saying, \"This is\r\nthe system which the American Anti-Slavery Society declares to be\r\nsinful, and ought therefore to be immediately abolished.\" There is,\r\nhowever, no necessary connection between his premises and conclusion. We\r\nmay admit all those laws which forbid the instruction of slaves; which\r\ninterfere with their marital or parental rights; which subject them to\r\nthe insults and oppression of the whites, to be in the highest degree\r\nunjust, without at all admitting that slaveholding itself is a crime.\r\nSlavery may exist without any one of these concomitants. In pronouncing\r\non the moral character of an act, it is obviously necessary to have a\r\nclear idea of what it is; yet how few of those who denounce slavery,\r\nhave any well-defined conception of its nature. They have a confused\r\nidea of chains and whips, of degradation and misery, of ignorance and\r\nvice, and to this complex conception they apply the name slavery, and\r\ndenounce it as the aggregate of all moral and physical evil. Do such\r\npersons suppose that slavery, as it existed in the family of Abraham,\r\nwas such as their imaginations thus picture to themselves? Might not\r\nthat patriarch have had men purchased with his silver who were well\r\nclothed, well instructed, well compensated for their labor, and in all\r\nrespects treated with parental kindness? Neither inadequate\r\nremuneration, physical discomfort, intellectual ignorance, moral\r\ndegradation, is essential to the condition of a slave. Yet if all these\r\nideas are removed from the commonly received notion of slavery, how\r\nlittle will remain. All the ideas which necessarily enter into the\r\ndefinition of slavery are deprivation of personal liberty, obligation of\r\nservice at the discretion of another, and the transferable character of\r\nthe authority and claim of service of the master.[263] The manner in\r\nwhich men are brought into this condition; its continuance, and the\r\nmeans adopted for securing the authority and claim of masters, are all\r\nincidental and variable. They may be reasonable or unreasonable, just or\r\nunjust, at different times and places. The question, therefore, which\r\nthe abolitionists have undertaken to decide, is not whether the laws\r\nenacted in the slaveholding States in relation to this subject are just\r\nor not, but whether slaveholding, in itself considered, is a crime. The\r\nconfusion of these two points has not only brought the abolitionists\r\ninto conflict with the Scriptures, but it has, as a necessary\r\nconsequence, prevented their gaining the confidence of the North, or\r\npower over the conscience of the South. When Southern Christians are\r\ntold that they are guilty of a heinous crime, worse than piracy,\r\nrobbery, or murder, because they hold slaves, when they know that Christ\r\nand his apostles never denounced slaveholding as a crime, never called\r\nupon men to renounce it as a condition of admission into the church,\r\nthey are shocked and offended, without being convinced. They are sure\r\nthat their accusers can not be wiser or better than their divine Master,\r\nand their consciences are untouched by denunciations which they know,\r\nif well founded, must affect not them only, but the authors of the\r\nreligion of the Bible.\r\n\r\nThe argument from the conduct of Christ and his immediate followers,\r\nseems to us decisive on the point, that slaveholding, in itself\r\nconsidered, is not a crime. Let us see how this argument has been\r\nanswered. In the able \"Address to the Presbyterians of Kentucky,\r\nproposing a plan for the instruction and emancipation of their slaves,\r\nby a committee of the Synod of Kentucky,\" there is a strong and extended\r\nargument to prove the sinfulness of slavery, _as it exists among us_, to\r\nwhich we have little to object. When, however, the distinguished\r\ndraughter of that address comes to answer the objection, \"God's word\r\nsanctions slavery, and it can not, therefore, be sinful,\" he forgets the\r\nessential limitation of the proposition which he had undertaken to\r\nestablish, and proceeds to prove that the Bible condemns slaveholding,\r\nand not merely the kind or system of slavery which prevails in this\r\ncountry. The argument drawn from the Scriptures, he says, needs no\r\nelaborate reply. If the Bible sanctions slavery, it sanctions the kind\r\nof slavery which then prevailed; the atrocious system which authorized\r\nmasters to starve their slaves, to torture them, to beat them, to put\r\nthem to death, and to throw them into their fish ponds. And he justly\r\nasks, whether a man could insult the God of heaven worse than by saying\r\nhe does not disapprove of such a system? Dr. Channing presents strongly\r\nthe same view, and says, that an infidel would be laboring in his\r\nvocation in asserting that the Bible does not condemn slavery. These\r\ngentlemen, however, are far too clear-sighted not to discover, on a\r\nmoment's reflection, that they have allowed their benevolent feelings to\r\nblind them to the real point at issue. No one denies that the Bible\r\ncondemns all injustice, cruelty, oppression, and violence. And just so\r\nfar as the laws then existing authorized these crimes, the Bible\r\ncondemned them. But what stronger argument can be presented, to prove\r\nthat the sacred writers did not regard slaveholding as in itself sinful,\r\nthan that while they condemn all unjust or unkind treatment (even\r\nthreatening), on the part of masters towards their slaves, they did not\r\ncondemn slavery itself? While they required the master to treat his\r\nslave according to the law of love, they did not command him to set him\r\nfree. The very atrocity, therefore, of the system which then prevailed,\r\ninstead of weakening the argument, gives it tenfold strength. Then, if\r\never, when the institution was so fearfully abused, we might expect to\r\nhear the interpreters of the divine will, saying that a system which\r\nleads to such results is the concentrated essence of all crimes, and\r\nmust be instantly abandoned, on pain of eternal condemnation. This,\r\nhowever, they did not say, and we can not now force them to say it. They\r\ntreated the subject precisely as they did the cruel despotism of the\r\nRoman emperors. The licentiousness, the injustice, the rapine and\r\nmurders of those wicked men, they condemned with the full force of\r\ndivine authority; but the mere extent of their power, though so liable\r\nto abuse, they left unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAnother answer to the argument in question is, that \"The New Testament\r\ndoes condemn slaveholding, as _practiced among us_, in the most explicit\r\nterms furnished by the language in which the sacred penman wrote.\" This\r\nassertion is supported by saying that God has condemned slavery, because\r\nhe has specified the parts which compose it and condemned them, one by\r\none, in the most ample and unequivocal form.[264] It is to be remarked\r\nthat the saving clause \"slaveholding _as it exists among us_,\" is\r\nintroduced into the statement, though it seems to be lost sight of in\r\nthe illustration and confirmation of it which follow. We readily admit,\r\nthat if God does condemn all the parts of which slavery consists, he\r\ncondemns slavery itself. But the draughter of the address has made no\r\nattempt to prove that this is actually done in the sacred Scriptures.\r\nThat many of the attributes of the system as established by law in this\r\ncountry, are condemned, is indeed very plain; but that slaveholding in\r\nitself is condemned, has not been and can not be proved. The writer,\r\nindeed, says, \"The Greek language had a word corresponding exactly, in\r\nsignification, with our word servant, but it had none which answered\r\nprecisely to our term slave. How then was an apostle writing in Greek,\r\nto condemn our slavery? How can we expect to find in Scripture, the\r\nwords 'slavery is sinful,' when the language in which it is written\r\ncontained no term which expressed the meaning of our word slavery?\" Does\r\nthe gentleman mean to say the Greek language could not express the idea\r\nthat slaveholding is sinful? Could not the apostles have communicated\r\nthe thought that it was the duty of masters to set their slaves free?\r\nWere they obliged from paucity of words to admit slaveholders into the\r\nChurch? We have no doubt the writer himself could, with all ease, pen a\r\ndeclaration in the Greek language void of all ambiguity, proclaiming\r\nfreedom to every slave upon earth, and denouncing the vengeance of\r\nheaven upon every man who dared to hold a fellow creature in bondage. It\r\nis not words we care for. We want evidence that the sacred writers\r\ntaught that it was incumbent on every slaveholder, as a matter of duty,\r\nto emancipate his slaves (which no Roman or Greek law forbade), and that\r\nhis refusing to do so was a heinous crime in the sight of God. The Greek\r\nlanguage must be poor indeed if it can not convey such ideas.\r\n\r\nAnother answer is given by Dr. Channing. \"Slavery,\" he says, \"in the age\r\nof the apostle, had so penetrated society, was so intimately interwoven\r\nwith it, and the materials of servile war were so abundant, that a\r\nreligion, preaching freedom to its victims, would have armed against\r\nitself the whole power of the State. Of consequence Paul did not assail\r\nit. He satisfied himself with spreading principles, which, however\r\nslowly, could not but work its destruction.\" To the same effect, Dr.\r\nWayland says, \"The gospel was designed, not for one race or one time,\r\nbut for all men and for all times. It looked not at the abolition of\r\nthis form of evil for that age alone, but for its universal abolition.\r\nHence the important object of its author was to gain it a lodgment in\r\nevery part of the known world; so that, by its universal diffusion among\r\nall classes of society, it might quietly and peacefully modify and\r\nsubdue the evil passions of men; and thus, without violence, work a\r\nrevolution in the whole mass of mankind. In this manner alone could its\r\nobject, a universal moral revolution, be accomplished. For if it had\r\nforbidden the _evil_ without subduing the _principle_, if it had\r\nproclaimed the unlawfulness of slavery, and taught slaves to _resist_\r\nthe oppression of their masters, it would instantly have arrayed the two\r\nparties in deadly hostility throughout the civilized world; its\r\nannouncement would have been the signal of a servile war; and the very\r\nname of the Christian religion would have been forgotten amidst the\r\nagitations of universal bloodshed. The fact, under these circumstances,\r\nthat the gospel does not forbid slavery, affords no reason to suppose\r\nthat it does not mean to prohibit it, much less does it afford ground\r\nfor belief that Jesus Christ intended to authorize it.\"[265]\r\n\r\nBefore considering the force of this reasoning, it may be well to notice\r\none or two important admissions contained in these extracts. First,\r\nthen, it is admitted by these distinguished moralists, that the apostles\r\ndid not preach a religion proclaiming freedom to slaves; that Paul did\r\nnot assail slavery; that the gospel did not proclaim the unlawfulness of\r\nslaveholding; it did not forbid it. This is going the whole length that\r\nwe have gone in our statement of the conduct of Christ and his apostles,\r\nSecondly, these writers admit that the course adopted by the authors of\r\nour religion was the only wise and proper one. Paul satisfied himself,\r\nsays Dr. Channing, with spreading principles, which, however slowly,\r\ncould not but work its destruction. Dr. Wayland says, that if the\r\napostles had pursued the opposite plan of denouncing slavery as a crime,\r\nthe Christian religion would have been ruined; its very name would have\r\nbeen forgotten. Then how can the course of the modern abolitionists,\r\nunder circumstances so nearly similar, or even that of these reverend\r\ngentlemen themselves be right? Why do not they content themselves with\r\ndoing what Christ and his apostles did? Why must they proclaim the\r\nunlawfulness of slavery? Is human nature so much altered, that a course,\r\nwhich would have produced universal bloodshed, and led to the very\r\ndestruction of the Christian religion, in one age, wise and Christian in\r\nanother?\r\n\r\nLet us, however, consider the force of the argument as stated above. It\r\namounts to this: Christ and his apostles thought slaveholding a great\r\ncrime, but they abstained from saying so, for fear of the consequences.\r\nThe very statement of the argument, in its naked form, is its\r\nrefutation. These holy men did not refrain from condemning sin from a\r\nregard to consequences. They did not hesitate to array against the\r\nreligion which they taught, the strongest passions of men. Nor did they\r\ncontent themselves with denouncing the general principles of evil; they\r\ncondemned its special manifestations. They did not simply forbid\r\nintemperate sensual indulgence, and leave it to their hearers to decide\r\nwhat did or what did not come under that name. They declared that no\r\nfornicator, no adulterer, no drunkard could be admitted into the kingdom\r\nof heaven. They did not hesitate, even when a little band, a hundred and\r\ntwenty souls, to place themselves in direct and irreconcilable\r\nopposition to the whole polity, civil and religious, of the Jewish\r\nState. It will hardly be maintained that slavery was, at that time,\r\nmore intimately interwoven with the institutions of society than\r\nidolatry was. It entered into the arrangements of every family; of every\r\ncity and province, and of the whole Roman empire. The emperor was the\r\nPontifex Maximus; every department of the State, civil and military, was\r\npervaded by it. It was so united with the fabric of the government that\r\nit could not be removed without effecting a revolution in all its parts.\r\nThe apostles knew this. They knew that to denounce polytheism, was to\r\narray against them the whole power of the State. Their divine Master had\r\ndistinctly apprized them of the result. He told them that it would set\r\nthe father against the son, and the son against the father; the mother\r\nagainst the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; and that a\r\nman's enemies should be those of his own household. He said that he came\r\nnot to bring peace, but a sword, and that such would be the opposition\r\nto his followers, that whosoever killed them, would think he did God\r\nservice. Yet in view of these certain consequences, the apostles did\r\ndenounce idolatry, not merely in principle, but by name. The result was\r\nprecisely what Christ had foretold. The Romans, tolerant of every other\r\nreligion, bent the whole force of their wisdom and arms to extirpate\r\nChristianity. The scenes of bloodshed, which century after century\r\nfollowed the introduction of the gospel, did not induce the followers of\r\nChrist to keep back or modify the truth. They adhered to their\r\ndeclaration, that idolatry was a heinous crime. And they were right. We\r\nexpect similar conduct of our missionaries. We do not expect them to\r\nrefrain from denouncing the institutions of the heathen, as sinful,\r\nbecause they are popular, or intimately interwoven with society. The\r\nJesuits, who adopted this plan, forfeited the confidence of Christendom,\r\nwithout making converts of the heathen. It is, therefore, perfectly\r\nevident that the authors of our religion were not withheld by these\r\nconsiderations, from declaring slavery to be unlawful. If they did\r\nabstain from this declaration, as is admitted, it must have been because\r\nthey did not consider it as in itself a crime. No other solution of\r\ntheir conduct is consistent with their truth or fidelity.\r\n\r\nAnother answer to the argument from Scripture is given by Dr. Channing\r\nand others. It is said that it proves too much; that it makes the Bible\r\nsanction despotism, even the despotism of Nero. Our reply to this\r\nobjection shall be very brief. We have already pointed out the fallacy\r\nof confounding slaveholding itself with the particular system of slavery\r\nprevalent at the time of Christ, and shown that the recognition of\r\nslaveholders as Christians, though irreconcilable with the assumption\r\nthat slavery is a heinous crime, gives no manner of sanction to the\r\natrocious laws and customs of that age, in relation to that subject.\r\nBecause the apostles admitted the masters of slaves to the communion of\r\nthe church, it would be a strange inference that they would have given\r\nthis testimony to the Christian character of the master who oppressed,\r\nstarved, or murdered his slaves. Such a master would have been rejected\r\nas an oppressor, or murderer, however, not as a slaveholder. In like\r\nmanner, the declaration that government is an ordinance of God, that\r\nmagistrates are to be obeyed within the sphere of their lawful\r\nauthority; that resistance to them, when in the exercise of that\r\nauthority, is sinful,[266] gives no sanction to the oppression of the\r\nRoman emperors, or to the petty vexations of provincial officers. The\r\nargument urged from Scripture in favor of passive submission, is not so\r\nexactly parallel with the argument for slavery, as Dr. Channing\r\nsupposes. They agree in some points, but they differ in others. The\r\nformer is founded upon a false interpretation of Rom. xiii: 1-3; it\r\nsupposes that passage to mean what it does not mean, whereas the latter\r\nis founded upon the sense which Dr. C. and other opponents of slavery,\r\nadmit to be the true sense. This must be allowed to alter the case\r\nmaterially. Again, the argument for the lawfulness of slaveholding, is\r\nnot founded on the mere injunction, \"Slaves, obey your masters,\"\r\nanalagous to the command, \"Let every soul be subject to the higher\r\npowers,\" but on the fact that the apostles did not condemn slavery; that\r\nthey did not require emancipation, and that they recognized slaveholders\r\nas Christian brethren. To make Dr. Channing's argument of any force, it\r\nmust be shown that Paul not only enjoined obedience to a despotic\r\nmonarch, but that he recognized Nero as a Christian. When this is done,\r\nthen we shall admit that our argument is fairly met, and that it is just\r\nas true that he sanctioned the conduct of Nero, as that he acknowledged\r\nthe lawfulness of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe two cases, however, are analogous as to one important point. The\r\nfact that Paul enjoins obedience under a despotic government, is a valid\r\nargument to prove, not that he sanctioned the conduct of the reigning\r\nRoman emperor, but that he did not consider the possession of despotic\r\npower a crime. The argument of Dr. C. would be far stronger, and the two\r\ncases more exactly parallel, had one of the emperors become a penitent\r\nbeliever during the apostolic age, and been admitted to the Christian\r\nchurch by inspired men, notwithstanding the fact that he retained his\r\noffice and authority. But even without this latter decisive\r\ncircumstance, we acknowledge that the mere holding of despotic power is\r\nproved not to be a crime by the fact that the apostles enjoined\r\nobedience to those who exercised it. Thus far the arguments are\r\nanalogous; and they prove that both political despotism and domestic\r\nslavery, belong in morals to the _adiaphora_, to things indifferent.\r\nThey may be expedient or inexpedient, right or wrong, according to\r\ncircumstances. Belonging to the same class, they should be treated in\r\nthe same way. Neither is to be denounced as necessarily sinful, and to\r\nbe abolished immediately under all circumstances and at all hazards.\r\nBoth should be left to the operation of those general principles of the\r\ngospel, which have peacefully ameliorated political institutions, and\r\ndestroyed domestic slavery throughout the greater part of Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe truth on this subject is so obvious that it sometimes escapes\r\nunconsciously from the lips of the most strenuous abolitionists. Mr.\r\nBirney says: \"He would have retained the power and authority of an\r\nemperor; yet his oppressions, his cruelties would have ceased; the very\r\ntemper that prompted them, would have been suppressed; his power would\r\nhave been put forth for good and not for evil.\"[267] Here every thing is\r\nconceded. The possession of despotic power is thus admitted not to be a\r\ncrime, even when it extends over millions of men, and subjects their\r\nlives as well as their property and services to the will of an\r\nindividual. What becomes then of the arguments and denunciations of\r\nslaveholding, which is despotism on a small scale? Would Mr. Birney\r\ncontinue in the deliberate practice of a crime worse than robbery,\r\npiracy, or murder? When he penned the above sentiment, he must have seen\r\nthat neither by the law of God nor of reason is it necessarily sinful to\r\nsustain the relation of master over our fellow creatures; that if this\r\nunlimited authority be used for the good of those over whom it extends\r\nand for the glory of God, its possessor may be one of the best and most\r\nuseful of men. It is the abuse of this power for base and selfish\r\npurposes which constitutes criminality, and not its simple possession.\r\nHe may say that the tendency to abuse absolute power is so great that it\r\nought never to be confided to the hands of men. This, as a general rule,\r\nis no doubt true, and establishes the inexpediency of all despotic\r\ngovernments, whether for the state or the family. But it leaves the\r\nmorality of the question just where it was, and where it was seen to be,\r\nwhen Mr. Birney said he could with a good conscience be a Roman emperor,\r\n_i. e._ the master of millions of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the Old Testament economy leads us to the same\r\nconclusion on this subject. It is not denied that slavery was tolerated\r\namong the ancient people of God. Abraham had servants in his family who\r\nwere \"bought with his money,\" Gen. xvii: 13. \"Abimeleck took sheep and\r\noxen and men servants and maid servants and gave them unto Abraham.\"\r\nMoses, finding this institution among the Hebrews and all surrounding\r\nnations, did not abolish it. He enacted laws directing how slaves were\r\nto be treated, on what conditions they were to be liberated, under what\r\ncircumstances they might and might not be sold; he recognizes the\r\ndistinction between slaves and hired servants, (Deut. xv: 18); he speaks\r\nof the way by which these bondmen might be procured; as by war, by\r\npurchase, by the right of creditorship, by the sentence of a judge, by\r\nbirth; but not by seizing on those who were free, an offense punished by\r\ndeath.[268] The fact that the Mosaic institutions recognized the\r\nlawfulness of slavery is a point too plain to need proof, and is almost\r\nuniversally admitted. Our argument from this acknowledged fact is, that\r\nif God allowed slavery to exist, if he directed how slaves might be\r\nlawfully acquired, and how they were to be treated, it is in vain to\r\ncontend that slaveholding is a sin, and yet profess reverence for the\r\nScriptures. Every one must feel that if perjury, murder, or idolatry had\r\nbeen thus authorized, it would bring the Mosaic institutions into\r\nconflict with the eternal principles of morals, and that our faith in\r\nthe divine origin of one or the other must be given up.\r\n\r\nDr. Channing says, of this argument also, that it proves too much. \"If\r\nusages, sanctioned under the Old Testament and not forbidden under the\r\nNew, are right, then our moral code will undergo a sad deterioration.\r\nPolygamy was allowed to the Israelites, was the practice of the holiest\r\nmen, and was common and licensed in the age of the apostles. But the\r\napostles no where condemn it, nor was the renunciation of it made an\r\nessential condition of admission into the Christian Church.\" To this we\r\nanswer, that so far as polygamy and divorce were permitted under the old\r\ndispensation, they were lawful, and became so by that permission; and\r\nthey ceased to be lawful when the permission was withdrawn, and a new\r\nlaw given. That Christ did give a new law on this subject is abundantly\r\nevident.[269] With regard to divorce, it is as explicit as language can\r\nmake it; and with regard to polygamy it is so plain as to have secured\r\nthe assent of every portion of the Christian churches in all ages. The\r\nvery fact that there has been no diversity of opinion or practice among\r\nChristians with regard to polygamy, is itself decisive evidence that the\r\nwill of Christ was clearly revealed on the subject. The temptation to\r\ncontinue the practice was as strong, both from the passions of men, and\r\nthe sanction of prior ages, as in regard to slavery. Yet we find no\r\ntraces of the toleration of polygamy in the Christian church, though\r\nslavery long continued to prevail. There is no evidence that the\r\napostles admitted to the fellowship of Christians, those who were guilty\r\nof this infraction of the law of marriage. It is indeed possible that in\r\ncases where the converts had already more than one wife, the connection\r\nwas not broken off. It is evident this must have occasioned great evil.\r\nIt would lead to the breaking up of families, the separation of parents\r\nand children, as well as husbands and wives. Under these circumstances\r\nthe connection may have been allowed to continue. It is however very\r\ndoubtful whether even this was permitted. It is remarkable that among\r\nthe numerous cases of conscience connected with marriage, submitted to\r\nthe apostles, this never occurs.\r\n\r\nDr. Channing uses language much too strong when he says that polygamy\r\nwas common and licensed in the days of the apostles. It was contrary\r\nboth to Roman and Grecian laws and usages until the most degenerate\r\nperiods of the history of those nations. It was very far from being\r\ncustomary among the Jews, though it might have been allowed. It is\r\nprobable that it was, therefore, comparatively extremely rare in the\r\napostolic age. This accounts for the fact that scarcely any notice is\r\ntaken of, the practice in the New Testament. Wherever marriage is spoken\r\nof, it seems to be taken for granted, as a well understood fact, that it\r\nwas a contract for life between one man and one woman; compare Rom. vii:\r\n2, 3. 1 Cor. vii: 1, 2, 39. It is further to be remarked on this\r\nsubject, that marriage is a positive institution. If God had ordained\r\nthat every man should have two or more wives, instead of one, polygamy\r\nwould have been lawful. But slaveholding is denounced as a _malum in\r\nse_; as essentially unjust and wicked. This being the case, it could at\r\nno period of the world receive the divine sanction, much less could it\r\nhave continued in the Christian church under the direction of inspired\r\nmen, when there was nothing to prevent its immediate abolition. The\r\nanswer then of Dr. Channing is unsatisfactory, first, because polygamy\r\ndoes not belong to the same category in morals as that to which\r\nslaveholding is affirmed to belong; and secondly, because it was so\r\nplainly prohibited by Christ and his apostles as to secure the assent of\r\nall Christians in all ages of the church.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, argued that slavery must be sinful because it interferes\r\nwith the inalienable rights of men. We have already remarked, that\r\nslavery, in itself considered, is a state of bondage, and nothing more.\r\nIt is the condition of an individual who is deprived of his personal\r\nliberty, and is obliged to labor for another, who has the right to\r\ntransfer this claim of service, at pleasure. That this condition\r\ninvolves the loss of many of the rights which are commonly and properly\r\ncalled natural, because belonging to men, as men, is readily admitted.\r\nIt is, however, incumbent on those who maintain that slavery is, on this\r\naccount, necessarily sinful, to show that it is criminal, under all\r\ncircumstances, to deprive any set of men of a portion of their natural\r\nrights. That this broad proposition can not be maintained is evident.\r\nThe very constitution of society supposes the forfeiture of a greater or\r\nless amount of these rights, according to its peculiar organization.\r\nThat it is not only the privilege, but the duty of men to live together\r\nin a regularly organized society, is evident from the nature which God\r\nhas given us; from the impossibility of every man living by and for\r\nhimself, and from the express declarations of the word of God. The\r\nobject of the formation of society is the promotion of human virtue and\r\nhappiness; and the form in which it should be organized, is that which\r\nwill best secure the attainment of this object. As, however, the\r\ncondition of men is so very various, it is impossible that the same form\r\nshould be equally conducive to happiness and virtue under all\r\ncircumstances. No one form, therefore, is prescribed in the Bible, or is\r\nuniversally obligatory. The question which form is, under given\r\ncircumstances, to be adopted, is one of great practical difficulty, and\r\nmust be left to the decision of those who have the power to decide, on\r\ntheir own responsibility. The question, however, does not depend upon\r\nthe degree in which these several forms may encroach upon the natural\r\nrights of men. In the patriarchal age, the most natural, the most\r\nfeasible, and perhaps the most beneficial form of government was by the\r\nhead of the family. His power by the law of nature, and the necessity of\r\nthe case, extended without any other limit than the general principles\r\nof morals, over his children, and in the absence of other regular\r\nauthority, would not terminate when the children arrived at a particular\r\nage, but be continued during life. He was the natural umpire between his\r\nadult offspring, he was their lawgiver and leader. His authority would\r\nnaturally extend over his more remote descendants, as they continued to\r\nincrease, and on his death, might devolve on the next oldest of the\r\nfamily. There is surely nothing in this mode of constituting society\r\nwhich is necessarily immoral. If found to be conducive to the general\r\ngood, it might be indefinitely continued. It would not suffice to render\r\nits abrogation obligatory, to say that all men are born free and equal;\r\nthat the youth of twenty-one had as good a right to have a voice in the\r\naffairs of the family as the aged patriarch; that the right of\r\nself-government is indefeasible, etc. Unless it could be shown that the\r\ngreat end of society was not attainable by this mode of organization,\r\nand that it would be more securely promoted by some other, it would be\r\nan immorality to require or to effect the change. And if a change\r\nbecame, in the course of time, obviously desirable, its nature and\r\nextent would be questions to be determined by the peculiar circumstances\r\nof the case, and not by the rule of abstract rights. Under some\r\ncircumstances it might be requisite to confine the legislative power to\r\na single individual; under others to the hands of a few; and under\r\nothers to commit it to the whole community. It would be absurd to\r\nmaintain, on the ground of the natural equality of men, that a horde of\r\nignorant and vicious savages, should be organized as a pure democracy,\r\nif experience taught that such a form of government was destructive to\r\nthemselves and others. These different modes of constituting civil\r\nsociety are not necessarily either just or unjust, but become the one or\r\nthe other according to circumstances; and their morality is not\r\ndetermined by the degree in which they encroach upon the natural rights\r\nof men, but on the degree in which they promote or retard the progress\r\nof human happiness and virtue. In this country we believe that the\r\ngeneral good requires us to deprive the whole female sex of the right of\r\nself-government. They have no voice in the formation of the laws which\r\ndispose of their persons and property. When married, we despoil them\r\nalmost entirely of a legal existence, and deny them some of the most\r\nessential rights of property. We treat all minors much in the same way,\r\ndepriving them of many personal and almost all political rights, and\r\nthat too though they may be far more competent to exercise them aright\r\nthan many adults. We, moreover, decide that a majority of one may make\r\nlaws for the whole community, no matter whether the numerical majority\r\nhave more wisdom or virtue than the minority or not. Our plea for all\r\nthis is, that the good of the whole is thereby most effectually\r\npromoted. This plea, if made out, justifies the case. In England and\r\nFrance they believe that the good of the whole requires that the right\r\nof governing, instead of being restricted, to all adult males, as we\r\narbitrarily determine, should be confined to that portion of the male\r\npopulation who hold a given amount of property. In Prussia and Russia,\r\nthey believe with equal confidence, that public security and happiness\r\ndemand that all power should be in the hands of the king. If they are\r\nright in their opinion, they are right in their practice. The principle\r\nthat social and political organizations are designed for the general\r\ngood, of course requires they should be allowed to change, as the\r\nprogress of society may demand. It is very possible that the feudal\r\nsystem may have been well adapted to the state of Europe in the middle\r\nages. The change in the condition of the world, however, has gradually\r\nobliterated almost all its features. The villein has become the\r\nindependent farmer; the lord of the manor, the simple landlord; and the\r\nsovereign leige, in whom, according to the fiction of the system, the\r\nfee of the whole country vested, has become a constitutional monarch. It\r\nmay be that another series of changes may convert the tenant into an\r\nowner, the lord into a rich commoner, and the monarch into a president.\r\nThough these changes have resulted in giving the people the enjoyment of\r\na larger amount of their rights than they formerly possessed, it is not\r\nhence to be inferred that they ought centuries ago to have been\r\nintroduced suddenly or by violence. Christianity \"operates as\r\nalterative.\" It was never designed to tear up the institutions of\r\nsociety by the roots. It produces equality not by prostrating trees of\r\nall sizes to the ground, but by securing to all the opportunity of\r\ngrowing, and by causing all to grow, until the original disparity is no\r\nlonger perceptible. All attempts, by human wisdom, to frame society, of\r\na sudden, after a pattern cut by the rule of abstract rights, have\r\nfailed; and whether they had failed or not, they can never be urged as a\r\nmatter of moral obligation. It is not enough, therefore, in order to\r\nprove the sinfulness of slaveholding, to show that it interferes with\r\nthe natural rights of a portion of the community. It is in this respect\r\nanalagous to all other social institutions. They are all of them\r\nencroachments on human rights, from the freest democracy to the most\r\nabsolute despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be remarked, that all these rights suppose\r\ncorresponding duties, and where there is an incompetence for the duty,\r\nthe claim to exercise the right ceases. No man can justly claim the\r\nexercise of any right to the injury of the community of which he is a\r\nmember. It is because females and minors are judged (though for\r\ndifferent reasons), incompetent to the proper discharge of the duties of\r\ncitizenship, that they are deprived of the right of suffrage. It is on\r\nthe same principle that a large portion of the inhabitants of France and\r\nEngland are deprived of the same privilege. As it is acknowledged that\r\nthe slaves may be justly deprived of political rights, on the ground of\r\ntheir incompetency to exercise them without injury to the community, it\r\nmust be admitted, by parity of reason, that they may be justly deprived\r\nof personal freedom, if incompetent to exercise it with safety to\r\nsociety. If this be so, then slavery is a question of circumstances, and\r\nnot a _malum in se_. It must be borne in mind that the object of these\r\nremarks is not to prove that the American, the British, or the Russian\r\nform of society, is expedient or otherwise; much less to show that the\r\nslaves in this country are actually unfit for freedom, but simply to\r\nprove that the mere fact that slaveholding interferes with natural\r\nrights, is not enough to justify the conclusion that it is necessarily\r\nand universally sinful.\r\n\r\nAnother very common and plausible argument on this subject is, that a\r\nman can not be made a matter of property. He can not be degraded into a\r\nbrute or chattel, without the grossest violation of duty and propriety;\r\nand that as slavery confers this right of property in human beings, it\r\nmust, from its very nature, be a crime. We acknowledge the correctness\r\nof the principle on which this argument is founded, but deny that it is\r\napplicable to the case in hand. We admit that it is not only an\r\nenormity, but an impossibility, that a man should be made a thing, as\r\ndistinguished from a rational and moral being. It is not within the\r\ncompass of human law to alter the nature of God's creatures. A man must\r\nbe regarded and treated as a rational being, even in his greatest\r\ndegradation. That he is, in some countries and under some institutions,\r\ndeprived of many of the rights and privileges of such a being, does not\r\nalter his nature. He must be viewed as a man under the most atrocious\r\nsystem of slavery that ever existed. Men do not arraign and try on\r\nevidence, and punish on conviction, either things or brutes. Yet slaves\r\nare under a regular system of laws which, however unjust they may be,\r\nrecognize their character as accountable beings. When it is inferred\r\nfrom the fact that the slave is called the property of his master, that\r\nhe is thereby degraded from his rank as a human being, the argument\r\nrests on the vagueness of the term _property_. Property is the right of\r\npossession and use, and must of necessity vary according to the nature\r\nof the objects to which it attaches. A man has property in his wife, in\r\nhis children, in his domestic animals, in his fields and in his forests.\r\nThat is, he has the right to the possession and use of these several\r\nobjects, according to their nature. He has no more right to use a brute\r\nas a log of wood, in virtue of the right of property, than he has to use\r\na man as a brute. There are general principles of rectitude, obligatory\r\non all men, which require them to treat all the creatures of God\r\naccording to the nature which he has given them. The man who should burn\r\nhis horse because he was his property, would find no justification in\r\nthat plea, either before God or man. When, therefore, it is said that\r\none man is the property of another, it can only mean that the one has a\r\nright to use the other _as a man_, but not as a brute, or as a thing. He\r\nhas no right to treat him as he may lawfully treat his ox, or a tree. He\r\ncan convert his person to no use to which a human being may not, by the\r\nlaws of God and nature, be properly applied. When this idea of property\r\ncomes to be analyzed, it is found to be nothing more than a claim of\r\nservice either for life or for a term of years. This claim is\r\ntransferable, and is of the nature of property, and is consequently\r\nliable for the debts of the owner, and subject to his disposal by will\r\nor otherwise. It is probable that the slave is called the property of\r\nhis master in the statute books, for the same reason that children are\r\ncalled the servants of the parents, or that wives are said to be the\r\nsame person with their husbands, and to have no separate existence of\r\ntheir own. These are mere technicalities, designed to facilitate certain\r\nlegal processes. Calling a child a servant, does not alter his relation\r\nto his father; and a wife is still a woman, though the courts may rule\r\nher out of existence. In like manner, where the law declares, that a\r\nslave shall be deemed and adjudged to be a chattel personal in the hands\r\nof his master, it does not alter his nature, nor does it confer on the\r\nmaster any right to use him in a manner inconsistent with that nature.\r\nAs there are certain moral principles which direct how brutes are to be\r\nused by those to whom they belong, so there are fixed principles which\r\ndetermine how a man may be used. These legal enactments, therefore, are\r\nnot intended to legislate away the nature of the slave, as a human\r\nbeing; they serve to facilitate the transfer of the master's claim of\r\nservice, and to render that claim the more readily liable for his debts.\r\nThe transfer of authority and claim of service from one master to\r\nanother, is, in principle, analagous to transfer of subjects from one\r\nsovereign to another. This is a matter of frequent occurrence. By the\r\ntreaty of Vienna, for example, a large part of the inhabitants of\r\ncentral Europe changed masters. Nearly half of Saxony was transferred to\r\nPrussia; Belgium was annexed to Holland. In like manner, Louisiana was\r\ntransferred from France to the United States. In none of these cases\r\nwere the people consulted. Yet in all, a claim of service more or less\r\nextended, was made over from one power to another. There was a change of\r\nmasters. The mere transferable character of the master's claim to the\r\nslave, does not convert the latter into a thing, or degrade him from his\r\nrank as a human being. Nor does the fact that he is bound to serve for\r\nlife, produce this effect. It is only property in his time for life,\r\ninstead of for a term of years. The nature of the relation is not\r\ndetermined by the period of its continuance.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been argued that the slave is the property of his\r\nmaster, not only in the sense admitted above, but in the sense assumed\r\nin the objection, because his children are under the same obligation of\r\nservice as the parent. The hereditary character of slavery, however,\r\ndoes not arise out of the idea of the slave as a chattel or thing, a\r\nmere matter of property, it depends on the organization of society. In\r\nEngland one man is born a peer, another a commoner; in Russia one man is\r\nborn a noble, another a serf; here, one is born a free citizen, another\r\na disfranchised outcast (the free colored man), and a third a slave.\r\nThese forms of society, as before remarked, are not necessarily, or in\r\nthemselves, either just or unjust; but become the one or the other,\r\naccording to circumstances. Under a state of things in which the best\r\ninterests of the community would be promoted by the British or Russian\r\norganization, they would be just and acceptable to God; but under\r\ncircumstances in which they would be injurious, they would be unjust. It\r\nis absolutely necessary, however, to discriminate between an\r\norganization essentially vicious, and one which, being in itself\r\nindifferent, may be right or wrong, according to circumstances. On the\r\nsame principle, therefore, that a human being in England is deprived, by\r\nthe mere accident of birth, of the right of suffrage, and in Russia has\r\nthe small portion of liberty which belongs to a commoner, or the still\r\nsmaller belonging to a serf, in this country one class is by birth\r\ninvested with all the rights of citizenship, another (females) is\r\ndeprived all political and many personal rights, and a third of even\r\ntheir personal liberty. Whether this organization be right or wrong, is\r\nnot now the question. We are simply showing that the fact that the\r\nchildren of slaves become by birth slaves, is not to be referred to the\r\nidea of the master's property in the body and soul of the parent, but\r\nresults from the form of society, and is analagous to other social\r\ninstitutions, as far as the principle is concerned, that children take\r\nthe rank, or the political or social condition of the parent.\r\n\r\nWe prefer being chargeable with the sin of wearisome repetition, to\r\nleaving any room for the misapprehension of our meaning. We, therefore,\r\nagain remark that we are discussing the mere abstract morality of these\r\nforms of social organization, and not their expediency. We have in view\r\nthe vindication of the character of the inspired writings and inspired\r\nmen from the charge of having overlooked the blackest of human crimes,\r\nand of having recognized the worst of human beings as Christians. We\r\nsay, therefore, that an institution which deprives a certain portion of\r\nthe community of their personal liberty, places them under obligation of\r\nservice to another portion, is no more necessarily sinful than one which\r\ninvests an individual with despotic power (such as Mr. Birney would\r\nconsent to hold); or than one which limits the right of government to a\r\nsmall portion of the people, or restricts it to the male part of the\r\ncommunity. However inexpedient, under certain circumstances, any one of\r\nthese arrangements may be, they are not necessarily immoral, nor do they\r\nbecome such, from the fact that the accident of birth determines the\r\nrelation in which one part of the community is to stand to the other. In\r\nancient Egypt, as in modern India, birth decided the position and\r\nprofession of every individual. One was born a priest, another a\r\nmerchant, another a laborer, another a soldier. As there must always be\r\nthese classes, it is no more necessarily immoral, to have them all\r\ndetermined by hereditary descent, than it was among the Israelites to\r\nhave all the officers of religion from generation to generation thus\r\ndetermined; or that birth should determine the individual who is to fill\r\na throne, or occupy a seat in parliament.\r\n\r\nAgain, Dr. Wayland argues, if the right to hold slaves be conceded,\r\n\"there is of course conceded all other rights necessary to insure its\r\npossession. Hence, inasmuch as the slave can be held in this condition\r\nonly while he remains in the lowest state of mental imbecility, it\r\nsupposes the master to have the right to control his intellectual\r\ndevelopment just as far as may be necessary to secure entire\r\nsubjection.\"[270] He reasons in the same way, to show that the religious\r\nknowledge and even eternal happiness of the slave are as a matter of\r\nright conceded to the power of the master, if the right of slaveholding\r\nis admitted. The utmost force that can be allowed to this argument is,\r\nthat the right to hold slaves includes the right to exercise all\r\n_proper_ means to insure its possession. It is in this respect on a par\r\nwith all other rights of the same kind. The right of parents to the\r\nservice of their children, of husbands to the obedience of their wives,\r\nof masters over their apprentices, of creditors over their debtors, of\r\nrulers over their subjects, all suppose the right to adopt proper means\r\nfor their secure enjoyment. They, however, give no sanction to the\r\nemployment of any and every means which cruelty, suspicion, or jealousy\r\nmay choose to deem necessary, nor of any which would be productive of\r\ngreater general evil than the forfeiture of the rights themselves.\r\nAccording to the ancient law even among the Jews, the power of life and\r\ndeath was granted to the parent; we concede only the power of\r\ncorrection. The old law gave the same power to the husband over the\r\nwife. The Roman law confided the person and even life of the debtor to\r\nthe mercy of the creditor. According to the reasoning of Dr. Wayland,\r\nall these laws must be sanctioned if the rights which they were deemed\r\nnecessary to secure, are acknowledged. It is clear, however, that the\r\nmost unrighteous means may be adopted to secure a proper end, under the\r\nplea of necessity. The justice of the plea must be made out on its own\r\ngrounds, and can not be assumed on the mere admission of the propriety\r\nof the end aimed at. Whether the slaves of this country may be safely\r\nadmitted to the enjoyments of personal liberty, is a matter of dispute;\r\nbut that they could not, consistently with the public welfare, be\r\nintrusted with the exercise of political power, is in on all hands\r\nadmitted. It is, then, the acknowledged right of the state to govern\r\nthem by laws in the formation of which they have no voice. But it is the\r\nuniversal plea of the depositaries of irresponsible power, sustained too\r\nby almost universal experience, that men can be brought to submit to\r\npolitical despotism only by being kept in ignorance and poverty. Dr.\r\nWayland, then, if he concedes the right of the state to legislate for\r\nthe slaves, must, according to his own reasoning, acknowledge the right\r\nto adopt all the means necessary for the security of this irresponsible\r\npower, and of consequence, that the state has the right to keep the\r\nblacks in the lowest state of degradation. If he denies the validity of\r\nthis argument in favor of political despotism, he must renounce his own\r\nagainst the lawfulness of domestic slavery. Dr. Wayland himself would\r\nadmit the right of the Emperor of Russia to exercise a degree of power\r\nover his present half civilized subjects, which could not be maintained\r\nover an enlightened people, though he would be loth to acknowledge his\r\nright to adopt all the means necessary to keep them in their present\r\ncondition. The acknowledgment, therefore, of the right to hold slaves,\r\ndoes not involve the acknowledgment of the right to adopt measures\r\nadapted and intended to perpetuate their present mental and physical\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\nWe have entered much more at length into the abstract argument on this\r\nsubject than we intended. It was our purpose to confine our remarks to\r\nthe scriptural view of the question. But the consideration of the\r\nobjections derived from the general principles of morals, rendered it\r\nnecessary to enlarge our plan. As it appears to us too clear to admit of\r\neither denial or doubt, that the Scriptures do sanction slaveholding;\r\nthat under the old dispensation it was expressly permitted by divine\r\ncommand, and under the New Testament is nowhere forbidden or denounced,\r\nbut on the contrary, acknowledged to be consistent with the Christian\r\ncharacter and profession (that is, consistent with justice, mercy,\r\nholiness, love to God and love to man), to declare it to be a heinous\r\ncrime, is a direct impeachment of the word of God. We, therefore, felt\r\nit incumbent upon us to prove, that the sacred Scriptures are not in\r\nconflict with the first principles of morals; that what they sanction is\r\nnot the blackest and basest of all offenses in the sight of God. To do\r\nthis, it was necessary to show what slavery is, to distinguish between\r\nthe relation itself, and the various cruel or unjust laws which may be\r\nmade either to bring men into it, or to secure its continuance; to show\r\nthat it no more follows from the admission that the Scriptures sanction\r\nthe right of slaveholding, that it, therefore, sanctions all the\r\noppressive slave laws of any community, than it follows from the\r\nadmission of the propriety of parental, conjugal, or political\r\nrelations, that it sanctions all the conflicting codes by which these\r\nrelations have at different periods and in different countries been\r\nregulated.\r\n\r\nWe have had another motive in the preparation of this article. The\r\nassumption that slaveholding is itself a crime, is not only an error,\r\nbut it is an error fraught with evil consequences. It not merely brings\r\nits advocates into conflict with the Scriptures, but it does much to\r\nretard the progress of freedom; it embitters and divides the members of\r\nthe community, and distracts the Christian church. Its operation in\r\nretarding the progress of freedom is obvious and manifold. In the first\r\nplace, it directs the battery of the enemies of slavery to the wrong\r\npoint. It might be easy for them to establish the injustice or cruelty\r\nof certain slave laws, where it is not in their power to establish the\r\nsinfulness of slavery itself.[271] They, therefore, waste their\r\nstrength. Nor is this the least evil. They promote the cause of their\r\nopponents. If they do not discriminate between slaveholding and the\r\nslave laws, it gives the slaveholder not merely an excuse but an\r\noccasion and a reason for making no such distinction. He is thus led to\r\nfeel the same conviction in the propriety of the one that he does in\r\nthat of the other. His mind and conscience may be satisfied that the\r\nmere act of holding slaves is not a crime. This is the point, however,\r\nto which the abolitionist directs his attention. He examines their\r\narguments, and becomes convinced of their inconclusiveness, and is not\r\nonly thus rendered impervious to their attacks, but is exasperated by\r\nwhat he considers their unmerited abuse. In the mean time his attention\r\nis withdrawn from far more important points;--the manner in which he\r\ntreats his slaves, and the laws enacted for the security of his\r\npossession. These are points on which his judgment might be much more\r\nreadily convinced of error, and his conscience of sin.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, besides fortifying the position and strengthening\r\nthe purpose of the slaveholder, the error in question divides and\r\nweakens the friends of freedom. To secure any valuable result by public\r\nsentiment, you must satisfy the public mind and rouse the public\r\nconscience. Their passions had better be allowed to rest in peace. As\r\nthe anti-slavery societies declare it to be their object to convince\r\ntheir fellow-citizens that slaveholding is necessarily a heinous crime\r\nin the sight of God, we consider their attempt as desperate, so long as\r\nthe Bible is regarded as the rule of right and wrong. They can hardly\r\nsecure either the verdict of the public mind or of the public conscience\r\nin behalf of this proposition. Their success hitherto has not been very\r\nencouraging, and is certainly not very flattering, if Dr. Channing's\r\naccount of the class of persons to whom they have principally addressed\r\ntheir arguments, is correct. The tendency of their exertions, be their\r\nsuccess great or small, is not to unite, but to divide. They do not\r\ncarry the judgment or conscience of the people with them. They form,\r\ntherefore, a class by themselves. Thousands who earnestly desire to see\r\nthe South convinced of the injustice and consequent impolicy of their\r\nslave laws, and under this conviction, of their own accord, adopting\r\nthose principles which the Bible enjoins, and which tend to produce\r\nuniversal intelligence, virtue, liberty and equality, without violence\r\nand sudden change, and which thus secure private and public prosperity,\r\nstand aloof from the abolitionists, not merely because they disapprove\r\nof their spirit and mode of action, but because they do not admit their\r\nfundamental principle.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the error in question prevents the adoption of the\r\nmost effectual means of extinguishing slavery. These means are not the\r\nopinions or feelings of the non-slaveholding States, nor the\r\ndenunciations of the holders of slaves, but the improvement,\r\nintellectual and moral, of the slaves themselves. Slavery has but two\r\nnatural and peaceful modes of death. The one is the increase of the\r\nslave population until it reaches the point of being unproductive. When\r\nthe number of slaves becomes so great that the master can not profitably\r\nemploy them, he manumits them in self-defense. This point would probably\r\nhave been reached long ago, in many of the Southern States, had not the\r\nboundless extent of the south-western section of the Union presented a\r\nconstant demand for the surplus hands. Many planters in Virginia and\r\nMaryland, whose principles or feelings revolt at the idea of selling\r\ntheir slaves to the South, find that their servants are gradually\r\nreducing them to poverty, by consuming more than they produce. The\r\nnumber, however, of slaveholders who entertain these scruples is\r\ncomparatively small. And as the demand for slave labor in the still\r\nunoccupied regions of the extreme south-west is so great, and is likely\r\nto be so long continued, it is hopeless to think of slavery dying out by\r\nbecoming a public burden. The other natural and peaceful mode of\r\nextinction, is the gradual elevation of the slaves in knowledge, virtue,\r\nand property to the point at which it is no longer desirable or possible\r\nto keep them in bondage.[272] Their chains thus gradually relax, until\r\nthey fall off entirely. It is in this way that Christianity has\r\nabolished both political and domestic bondage, whenever it has had free\r\nscope. It enjoins a fair compensation for labor; it insists on the moral\r\nand intellectual improvement of all classes of men; it condemns all\r\ninfractions of marital or parental rights; in short, it requires not\r\nonly that free scope should be allowed to human improvement, but that\r\nall suitable means should be employed for the attainment of that end.\r\nThe feudal system, as before remarked, has, in a great measure, been\r\nthus outgrown in all the European states. The third estate, formerly\r\nhardly recognized as having an existence, is becoming the controlling\r\npower in most of those ancient communities. The gradual improvement of\r\nthe people rendered it impossible, and undesirable to deprive them of\r\ntheir just share in the government. And it is precisely in those\r\ncountries where this improvement is most advanced that the feudal\r\ninstitutions are the most completely obliterated, and the general\r\nprosperity the greatest. In like manner the gospel method of\r\nextinguishing slavery is by improving the condition of the slave. The\r\ngrand question is, How is this to be done? The abolitionist answers, by\r\nimmediate emancipation. Perhaps he is right, perhaps he is wrong; but\r\nwhether right or wrong, it is not the practical question for the North.\r\nAmong a community which have the power to emancipate, it would be\r\nperfectly proper to urge that measure on the ground of its being the\r\nbest means of promoting the great object of the advancement of human\r\nhappiness and virtue. But the error of the abolitionists is, that they\r\nurge this measure from the wrong quarter, and upon the wrong ground.\r\nThey insist upon immediate abolition because slavery is a sin, and its\r\nextinction a duty. If, however, slaveholding is not in itself sinful,\r\nits abolition is not necessarily a duty. The question of duty depends\r\nupon the effects of the measure, about which men may honestly differ.\r\nThose who believe that it would advance the general good, are bound to\r\npromote it; while those who believe the reverse, are equally bound to\r\nresist it. The abolitionists, by insisting upon one means of\r\nimprovement, and that on untenable ground, are most effectually working\r\nagainst the adoption of any other means, by destroying the disposition\r\nand power to employ them. It is in this way that the error to which we\r\nhave referred throughout this article, is operating most\r\ndisadvantageously for the cause of human liberty and happiness. The fact\r\nis, that the great duty of the South is not emancipation; but\r\nimprovement.[273] The former is obligatory only as a means to an end,\r\nand, therefore, only under circumstances where it would promote that\r\nend. In like manner the great duty of despotic governments is not the\r\nimmediate granting of free institutions, but the constant and assiduous\r\ncultivation of the best interests (knowledge, virtue, and happiness) of\r\nthe people. Where free institutions would conduce to this object, they\r\nwould be granted, and just so far and so fast as this becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nAgain, the opinion that slaveholding is itself a crime, must operate to\r\nproduce the disunion of the States, and the division of all the\r\necclesiastical societies in this country. The feelings of the people may\r\nbe excited violently for a time, but the transport soon passes away. But\r\nif the conscience is enlisted in the cause, and becomes the controlling\r\nprinciple, the alienation between the North and the South must become\r\npermanent. The opposition to Southern institutions will become calm,\r\nconstant, and unappeasable. Just so far as this opinion operates, it\r\nwill lead those who entertain it to submit to any sacrifices to carry it\r\nout, and give it effect. We shall become two nations in feeling, which\r\nmust soon render us two nations in fact. With regard to the church, its\r\noperation will be more summary. If slaveholding is a heinous crime,\r\nslaveholders must be excluded from the church. Several of our\r\njudicatories have already taken this position. Should the General\r\nAssembly adopt it, the church is ipso facto, divided. If the opinion in\r\nquestion is correct, it must be maintained, whatever are the\r\nconsequences. We are no advocates of expediency in morals. We have no\r\nmore right to teach error in order to prevent evil, than we have a right\r\nto do evil to promote good. On the other hand, if the opinion is\r\nincorrect, its evil consequences render it a duty to prove and exhibit\r\nits unsoundness. It is under the deep impression that the primary\r\nassumption of the abolitionists is an error, that its adoption tends to\r\nthe distraction of the country, and the division of the church; and that\r\nit will lead to the longer continuance and greater severity of slavery,\r\nthat we have felt constrained to do what little we could towards its\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\nWe have little apprehension that any one can so far mistake our object,\r\nor the purport of our remarks, as to suppose either that we regard\r\nslavery as a desirable institution, or that we approve of the slave laws\r\nof the Southern States. So far from this being the case, the extinction\r\nof slavery, and the amelioration of those laws are as sincerely desired\r\nby us, as by any of the abolitionists. The question is not about the\r\ncontinuance of slavery, and of the present system, but about the proper\r\nmethod of effecting the removal of the evil. We maintain, that it is not\r\nby denouncing slaveholding as a sin, or by universal agitation at the\r\nNorth, but by the improvement of the slaves. It no more follows that\r\nbecause the master has a right to hold slaves, he has a right to keep\r\nthem in a state of degradation in order to perpetuate their bondage,\r\nthan that the Emperor of Russia has a right to keep his subjects in\r\nignorance and poverty, in order to secure the permanence and quiet\r\npossession of his power. We hold it to be the grand principle of the\r\ngospel, that every man is bound to promote the moral, intellectual, and\r\nphysical improvement of his fellow men. Their civil or political\r\nrelations are in themselves matters of indifference. Monarchy,\r\naristocracy, democracy, domestic slavery, are right or wrong as they\r\nare, for the time being, conducive to this great end, or the reverse.\r\nThey are not objects to which the improvement of society is to be\r\nsacrificed; nor are they strait-jackets to be placed upon the public\r\nbody to prevent its free development. We think, therefore, that the\r\ntrue method for Christians to treat this subject, is to follow the\r\nexample of Christ and his apostles in relation both to despotism and\r\nslavery. Let them enforce as moral duties the great principles of\r\njustice and mercy, and all the specific commands and precepts of the\r\nScriptures. If any set of men have servants, bond or free, to whom they\r\nrefuse a proper compensation for their labor, they violate a moral duty\r\nand an express command of Scripture. What that compensation should be,\r\ndepends upon a variety of circumstances. In some cases the slaveholder\r\nwould be glad to compound for the support of his slaves by giving the\r\nthird or the half of the proceeds of his estate. Yet this at the North\r\nwould be regarded as a full remuneration for the mere labor of\r\nproduction. Under other circumstances, however, a mere support, would be\r\nvery inadequate compensation; and when inadequate, it is unjust. If the\r\ncompensation be more than a support, the surplus is the property of the\r\nlaborer, and can not morally, whatever the laws may be, be taken from\r\nhim. The right to accumulate property is an incident to the right of\r\nreward for labor. And we believe there are few slaveholding countries in\r\nwhich the right is not practically acknowledged, since we hear so\r\nfrequently of slaves purchasing their own freedom. It is very common for\r\na certain moderate task[274] to be assigned as a day's work, which may\r\nbe regarded as the compensation rendered by the slave for his support.\r\nThe residue of the day is at his own disposal, and may be employed for\r\nhis own profit. We are not now, however, concerned about details. The\r\nprinciple that \"the laborer is worthy of his hire\" and should enjoy it,\r\nis a plain principle of morals and command of the Bible, and can not be\r\nviolated with impunity.\r\n\r\nAgain, if any man has servants or others whom he forbids to marry, or\r\nwhom he separates after marriage, he breaks as clearly a revealed law as\r\nany written on the pages of inspiration, or on the human heart. If he\r\ninterferes unnecessarily with the authority of parents over their\r\nchildren, he again brings himself into collision with his Maker. If any\r\nman has under his charge, children, apprentices, servants, or slaves,\r\nand does not teach them, or cause them to be taught, the will of God;\r\nif he deliberately opposes their intellectual, moral, or religious\r\nimprovement, he makes himself a transgressor. That many of the laws of\r\nthe slaveholding States are opposed to these simple principles of\r\nmorals, we fully believe; and we do not doubt that they are sinful and\r\nought to be rescinded. If it be asked what would be the consequence of\r\nthus acting on the principles of the gospel, of following the example\r\nand obeying the precepts of Christ? We answer, the gradual elevation of\r\nthe slaves in intelligence, virtue, and wealth; the peaceable and speedy\r\nextinction of slavery; the improvement in general prosperity of all\r\nclasses of society, and the consequent increase in the sum of human\r\nhappiness and virtue. This has been the result of acting on these\r\nprinciples in all past ages; and just in proportion as they have been\r\nfaithfully observed. The degradation of most eastern nations, and of\r\nItaly, Spain and Ireland, are not more striking examples of the\r\nconsequences of their violation, than Scotland, England, and the\r\nnon-slaveholding States are of the benefits, of their being even\r\nimperfectly obeyed. Men can not alter the laws of God. It would be as\r\neasy for them to arrest the action of the force of gravity, as to\r\nprevent the systematic violation of the principles of morals being\r\nproductive of evil.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[260] See Cheever's \"God against Slavery,\" and Wendell Phillips' Speech\r\non Harper's Ferry, &c., &c.--ED.\r\n\r\n[261] Their object, evidently, has been to prevent the free people of\r\ncolor from emigrating to Liberia, and to retain them in this country as\r\na cat's paw to work out their own designs.--ED.\r\n\r\n[262] But for this, a large proportion of our slaves, instead of being\r\ninstructed orally, would have been taught to read the Scriptures for\r\nthemselves.--ED.\r\n\r\n[263] Paley's definition is still more simple, \"I define,\" he says,\r\n\"slavery to be an obligation to labor for the benefit of the master,\r\nwithout the contract or consent of the servant.\" Moral Philosophy, book\r\niii, ch. 3.\r\n\r\n[264] Address, etc., p. 20.\r\n\r\n[265] Elements of Moral Science, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[266] It need hardly be remarked, that the command to obey magistrates,\r\nas given in Rom. xiii: 1-3, is subject to the limitation stated above.\r\nThey are to be obeyed as magistrates; precisely as parents are to be\r\nobeyed as parents, husbands as husbands.

CARTWRIGHT, M.D.,\r\n\r\nOF LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n          NOTE.--This article of Dr. Cartwright's was\r\n          designed by the Editor to follow \"Cotton is King,\"\r\n          but the copy was not received until the\r\n          stereotyping had progressed nearly to\r\n          completion.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          It has long been a favorite argument of the\r\n          abolitionists to assert that slave labor is\r\n          unproductive, that the prevalence of slavery tends\r\n          to diminish not only the productions of a country,\r\n          but also the value of the lands. On this ground,\r\n          appeals are constantly made to the\r\n          non-slaveholders of the South, to induce them to\r\n          abolish slavery; assigning as a reason, that their\r\n          lands would rise in value so as to more than\r\n          compensate the loss of the slaves.\r\n\r\n          That we may be able to ascertain how much truth\r\n          there is in this assertion, let us refer to\r\n          _figures_ and _facts_. The following deductions\r\n          from the Report of the Auditor of Public Accounts\r\n          of the State of Louisiana, speak in a language too\r\n          plain to be misunderstood by any one, and prove\r\n          conclusively, that, so far at least as the slave\r\n          States are concerned, a dense slave population\r\n          gives the highest value and greatest\r\n          productiveness to every species of property.\r\n          Similar deductions might he drawn from the\r\n          Auditors' Reports of every slave State in the\r\n          Union EDITOR.\r\n\r\n          1. _Annual Report of the Auditor of Public\r\n          Accounts of the State of Louisiana._ Baton Rouge,\r\n          1859.\r\n\r\n          2. _Annual Report of the Superintendent of Public\r\n          Education._ Baton Rouge, 1859.\r\n\r\n          3. _Les Lois concernant, les Ecoles Publique dons\r\n          l'Etat de la Louisiane_, 1849.\r\n\r\n          4. _Agricultural Productions of Louisiana._ By\r\n          Edward J.

American civilization is founded upon the laws\r\nof nature and upon moral virue. \"Honesty is the best policy,\" says\r\nWashington, its founder. The laws of nature are discovered by\r\nobservation and experience. A practical direction is given to them by\r\nthat species of knowedge, which is derived from handling the objects of\r\nsense and working upon the materials the earth produces. Moral virtue\r\nputs a bridle on the evil passions of the heart, and, at the same time,\r\ninfuses into it an invincible courage in demanding what is right. A\r\nknowledge of nature enables its possessor to bridle the natural forces\r\nof air, earth, fire, and water--to hold the reins and drive ahead. With\r\nits rail-roads and telegraphs, American civilization is waging war with\r\ntime and space, and, by its moral power and Christian example, with sin\r\nand evil. With its labor-saving machiney, its thirty millions do more\r\nwork for God and man than three hundred millions of such people as\r\ninhabit Asia, Africa, Central, and South America, and Mexico. Its thirty\r\nmillions are equal to any hundred millions of most of the governments of\r\nEurope. It is far ahead of the most enlightened nations of Europe,\r\nbecause its people are in the possession of all the blessings and\r\ncomforts that heaven, through nature's laws, accord to earth's\r\ninhabitants, while three-fourths of the two hundred and fifty millions\r\nof Europe are writhing in an artificially created purgatory--deprived of\r\nall the good things of earth. Whoever would catch up with the annals of\r\nAmerican progress, fall into line with American policy, and get within\r\nthe influence of the guiding spirit of American policy, must not depend\r\nupon libraries for information, or he will be left far behind the age in\r\nwhich he lives; must look to the statistics of the churches, to the\r\nreports of legislative and commercial bodies, and to the monthly reviews\r\nrecording the principal transactions of the busy world around him. If he\r\nwants to keep pace with the exploits of mankind under European\r\ncivilization, in cutting one another's throats, sacking cities,\r\ndestroying commerce, and laying waste the smiling fields of agriculture,\r\nthe daily press will give the required information; but he can not rely\r\nupon it for these statistical details and stubborn facts which tell what\r\nthe Caucasian in America, aided by his black man, Friday, is doing for\r\nChristianity, for liberty, for civilization, and for the good of the\r\nworld. Some of these details are regarded as too dry and uninteresting,\r\nand others too long for admission in the daily press. Much is written\r\nand said about the benefits of education. The rudiments are alike\r\nimportant in both kinds of civilization, American and European. But\r\nafter acquiring the rudimentary knowledge, the paths of education in the\r\ntwo hemispheres diverge from each other at right angles. The further the\r\nAmerican travels in the labyrinths of that system of education, so\r\nfashionable in Europe, purposely designed to bury active minds in the\r\nrubbish of past ages, or tangle them in metaphysical abstractions and\r\nhide from them the beauty of truth and the matter-of-fact world around\r\nthem, the less he is qualified to appreciate the blessings and benefits\r\nof republican institutions, and the more apt he is to be found in\r\nopposition to American policy. By hard studies on subjects of no\r\npractical importance, physical or moral, the European system of\r\neducation drives independence out of the mind, and virtue out of the\r\nheart, as a pre-requisite qualification for obedience to governments\r\nresting upon diplomacy, falsehood, artificial and unnatural distinctions\r\namong men. But in the United States, the various State governments being\r\nfounded on moral truths and nature's laws, and not on the opinions of a\r\nprivileged order, our system of education should be in harmony with our\r\nsystem of government; our youth should be taught to love virtue for\r\nvirtue's sake; to study nature, bow to her truths, and to give all the\r\nhomage that the crowned heads receive in Europe, to nature and to truth.\r\nOur government sets up no religious creed or standard of morals, but\r\nleaves every one perfectly free in religion and morals, to be governed\r\nby the Bible as _he understands it_, provided he does not trespass upon\r\nthe rights of others. The principal books in our libraries give little\r\nor no aid in qualifying our youth for public office or to direct the\r\nlegislation or policy of a government resting upon natural laws. The\r\npractical operation of our system is scarcely anywhere else recorded\r\nthan in church history, gospel triumph, legislative reports, reviews,\r\nand pamphlets. There the facts may be found, but they are isolated and\r\ndisconnected, teaching nothing; but could be made a most potent means,\r\nnot only of instruction in the practical operation of our system of\r\ngovernment, but of developing the human faculties, if introduced into\r\nour schools. They are full of objects for comparison. By comparison the\r\nmind is taught the difference between things; comparisons are at the\r\nbottom of all useful and practical knowledge. \"They are suggestive,\"\r\nsays Prof. Agassiz, \"of further comparisons. When the objects of nature\r\nare the subjects of comparison, the mind is insensibly led to make new\r\ninquiries, is filled with delight at every step of progress it makes in\r\nnature's ever young and blooming fields, and study becomes a pleasure.\r\nNo American knows what a good country he has got until he visits Europe\r\nand draws comparisons between the condition of the laboring classes\r\nthere and those at home. Even in London, about half the people have\r\nneither church-room nor school-room.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Annual Report of the Auditor of Public accounts of the State of\r\nLouisiana_ abounds with objects which have only to be compared in their\r\nvarious relations to one another to give the mind a clear perception of\r\nthe operation and practical working of some of the most important\r\nnatural laws and moral truths lying at the bottom of American\r\ncivilization and progress. Without comparisons they are like\r\nhieroglyphical characters telling nothing. Comparisons will decipher\r\nthem and make them speak a language full of instruction, which every one\r\ncan understand.\r\n\r\nThe more thorough the education in European colleges, or in American\r\nschools on a similar model, the more there will be to _unlearn_ before\r\nAmerican institutions can be understood or their value appreciated, and\r\nthe less will the American citizen be qualified to vote understandingly\r\nat the polls. The reason is, that the system of education which directs\r\nthe policy of goverments founded upon artificial distinctions, is from\r\nnecessity inimical to a government founded upon natural distinctions and\r\nmoral truth. Education on the British model has set the North against\r\nthe South, and has waylaid every step of American progress, from the\r\nacquisition of Louisiana to the last foot of land acquired from Mexico\r\nor the Indians, and it now stands across the path of the all-conquering\r\nmarch of American civilization into Cuba, Central America, and Mexico.\r\nThe vicious system of education founded upon the European model has\r\nalmost reconquered Massachusetts and several other Northern States,\r\nconverting them, in many essential particulars, into British provinces.\r\nThe people of the North are virtuous and democratic at heart; but they\r\nhave been turned against their own country and the sentiments which\r\nexperience teaches to be truths, the obvious benefits of negro slavery,\r\nfor instance, by an education essentially monarchical. To sustain\r\nitself, American policy should have its own schools, to guide and direct\r\nit. Heretofore it has been guided and directed almost entirely by the\r\nlight and knowledge derived from the great school of experience, in\r\nwhich the democratic masses are taught without the aid of other books\r\nthan the Bible and hymn book. In that school they learned that the negro\r\nwas not a white man with a black skin, but a different being, intended\r\nby nature to occupy a subordinate place in society; that school made\r\nknown that the only place which nature has qualified him to fill was the\r\nplace of a servant. That place was accordingly assigned him in the new\r\norder of civilization called American civilization, founded upon moral\r\nvirtue and natural distinctions, and not upon artifice and fraud; upon\r\nnature's laws and God's truths, and not upon the fallacies of human\r\nreason, as that of Europe. They had not even the assistance of book\r\neducation to tell them that the white man bore the name of Japheth in\r\nthe Bible, and the negro that of Canaan; and that the negro's servile\r\nnature was expressed in his Hebrew name. American theologians had not\r\npaid sufficient attention to the Hebrew, and could not inform the\r\nAmerican reader that both the Hebrew Bible and its Greek translation,\r\ncalled the Septuagint, plainly, and in direct terms, recognize two\r\nclasses or races of mankind, one having a black skin, and the other\r\nbeing fair or white; and that, besides these two races, it recognizes a\r\nthird race under the term Shem, a name which has no reference to color;\r\nbut as the other two were plainly designated as _whites_ and _blacks_,\r\nthe inference is, that the third class was red or yellow, or of an\r\nintermediate color. In the Septuagint (the Bible which our Saviour\r\nquotes), _Æthiop_ is the term used to designate the sons of Ham, a term\r\nsynonymous with the Latin word _niger_, from which the Spanish word\r\n_negro_ is derived. The Bible tells in unmistakable terms that Japheth,\r\nor the white race, was to be _enlarged_. The discovery of the western\r\nhemisphere opened a wide field for the _enlargement_ of the white race,\r\npent up for thousands of years in a little corner of the eastern\r\nhemisphere. The new hemisphere was found to be inhabited by nomads of\r\nthe race of Shem, neither white nor black. The historical fact is, that\r\nthe white race is every year _enlarging_ itself by dispossessing the\r\nnomadic sons of Shem, found on the American continent, of their tents,\r\nand dwelling in them; and that the black race are its servants. Thus\r\nliterally, in accordance with the prophecy, \"_Japheth will be enlarged,\r\nhe shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan_ (the negro) _shall be\r\nhis servant_.\" The prophecy is not fulfilled, but only in process of\r\nfulfillment. It clearly points to a new order of civilization, in a\r\nwider world for enlargement than the old, in which the black race was to\r\nserve the white. The will of God that such a new order of civilization\r\nshould be established, in which the negro and white man should mutually\r\naid each other, and supply each other's deficiencies, is not only\r\nrevealed in Hebrew words, written thousands of years ago, but revealed\r\nalso in the laws of nature, and revealed by _Ethiop nowhere else but in\r\nour slaveholding States, stretching forth her arms to God_. American\r\ncivilization, founded upon revealed truth and nature's laws, puts the\r\nnegro in his natural position, that of subordination to the white man.\r\n\r\nThe observation and experience of those who founded a government resting\r\non the basis of moral truth and natural, instead of artificial\r\ndistinctions, revealed to them the necessity of consigning to the negro\r\nan inferior position, in order to carry out that democratic principle\r\nwhich demands a place for every thing, and every thing in its place.\r\nWhat are called the free States have provided no place for the poor\r\nnegro. He is an outcast and a wanderer, hurtful instead of helpful to\r\nsociety. Mexico, Central and South America, in catching at the shadow,\r\nlost the substance of republicanism. Republican government has utterly\r\nfailed with them, because they fell into the error of supposing that all\r\nmen of all races are naturally equal to one another. The white race in\r\nthose countries, acting upon that error, emancipated the inferior negro\r\nrace, and amalgamated with that and with the Indian race. This disregard\r\nof the distinctions made by nature, between the white, black, and Indian\r\nraces, was fatal to American civilization in those countries.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson never meant to say that negroes were equal to white men;\r\nbut that white men, whether born in England or America were equal to one\r\nanother. Our fathers contended for their own equality among Englishmen,\r\nwhich not being granted to them, they declared their independence. But\r\nscarcely had their swords won that independence, when the governing\r\nclasses of Great Britain began to teach the rising generation, through\r\nthe medium of books, schools, and colleges, that the democratic\r\ndoctrine, which declared all white men equal to one another, _included\r\nnegroes_. Thus making the learned world believe that democracy and negro\r\nslavery are incompatible--that there can be no such thing as a\r\ndemocracy, or a government where the people rule, so long as black\r\npeople are held in slavery. The schools not only taught the doctrine\r\nthat negro slavery is anti-republican, but that it is a moral, social\r\nand political evil, and soon it was denounced from the pulpit as _sin\r\nagainst God_!\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of such an education, imported from Europe, the\r\nAmerican people, even in the South, began to regard negro slavery as an\r\nevil--not from any thing they saw, but from what they had been taught.\r\nThence all manner of experiments were made with the negro to make his\r\ncondition better out of slavery than in it. All of which proving a\r\nfailure, the South took issue with Old and New England on the question\r\nof negro slavery being an evil, social, political, or moral, and called\r\nfor the proof. No proof could be given except that drawn from England,\r\nfrom hearsay evidence, and from theoretical teaching of that system of\r\neducation designed to support European despotisms, and to destroy\r\nAmerican republicanism. This has opened the eyes of the South to the\r\nnecessity of establishing schools and colleges of its own to uphold\r\nAmerican civilization. The address of the commissioners for the raising\r\nof the endowment of the University of the South commends it to the\r\nattention of the American people, not as a sectional or Southern\r\nuniversity, but as an American university, to be the house and home of\r\nthe spirit of American civilization--a dwelling-place not lighted with\r\nfox-fire tapers or artificial lights to disguise nature, as the\r\ninstitutions of learning in Europe are, but with the light inherent in\r\nnature's truths and in the revealed word of God, honestly translated and\r\ninterpreted. Some schools to aid American civilization have already been\r\nestablished, but there is a sad outcry for the proper kind of school\r\nbooks; those of Old and New England being rotten to the core with\r\nabolitionism and with that false democracy which would make the rising\r\ngeneration believe that the heroes of the American Revolution fought for\r\nruining the negro by giving him liberty, fought to annul God's decrees,\r\nwhich made him a servant of servants, instead of fighting for the\r\nprinciple asserting their own equality with the lords of England and the\r\ncrowned heads of Europe. Fortunately the work before us, the _Report of\r\nthe Auditor of the Public Accounts of Louisiana_, will answer very well\r\nto supply the want of a proper kind of school book to indoctrinate\r\nbeginners in the mysteries of the political institutions of their own\r\ncountry, and at the same time to discipline and expand their minds. It\r\nis only one of the numerous books of its class, which might be\r\nadvantageously pressed into the service of the schools for a similar\r\npurpose. The statistics of the United States Census, and De Bow's\r\n_Industrial Resources_, and the _Minutes of the Progress of the\r\nAmerican Churches_, would prove a very good beginning of a high school\r\nand college library. Comparisons being the basis of all useful and\r\npractical knowledge, in the works just referred to, and in the auditor's\r\nreport and others of its class, will be found ample materials for\r\ncomparison. Comparison will infuse a soul into the dry bones of the\r\nfacts and figures of our religious and political institutions, and make\r\nthem declare the hidden truths of nature which lie at the bottom of\r\nAmerican republicanism, Christianity, prosperity, and progress. The task\r\nof comparing will be highly instructive to the youthful mind, and at the\r\nsame time agreeable and interesting. As an example, here is the way a\r\nbeginning is recommended, for a comparison in secular affairs.\r\n\r\nLESSON NO. 1.--Let Lesson No. 1 consist in comparing the counties (or\r\nparishes, as they are called in Louisiana) having the largest white\r\npopulation and the fewest negroes, with those counties having the\r\nheaviest negro population and the fewest white people.\r\n\r\nThere are five parishes, or counties, found in the report of the auditor\r\nof public accounts, in which the white population exceeds the negro\r\nslaves three to one. Let these parishes be compared with five others in\r\nwhich the slave population exceeds the white seven to one.\r\n\r\nTable I, represents the first class of parishes, and Table II, the\r\nsecond.

Here lesson\r\n1 ends, by proving that there is not as great a demand for land, by\r\nnearly one half, where the population consists of one white man and\r\nseven negroes. By referring to a map of Louisiana, it will be seen that\r\nthe territorial extent of the parishes in table I is much greater than\r\nthose in table II. Hence it is not for the want of territory, that a\r\npopulation consisting of three whites to one negro, owns less land by\r\nnearly one half, than a population consisting of seven negroes to one\r\nwhite man.\r\n\r\nLESSON NO. 2.--Lesson No. I requires the value of the land per acre, in\r\ntables I and II, to be ascertained and compared, with a view of solving\r\nthe important problem: \"_Which gives the most value to land, a dense\r\nwhite population with a few negroes, or a dense slave population with a\r\nfew white people?_\"\r\n\r\nBy referring to the report of the auditor of accounts of Louisiana, it\r\nwill be seen that the assessed value of the lands of the parishes in\r\ntable I amounts to $1,642,073, or $5 49 per acre; while that of table II\r\namounts to $23,446,654, or $16 46 per acre. A population consisting of\r\nseven negro slaves to one white man, makes land three times as valuable\r\nas a population of three white men to one negro. The comparison drawn in\r\nthis lesson, puts a soul in the dry bones of the facts and figures\r\ncontained in the report of the auditor of public accounts, and makes\r\nthem tell what it is which gives value to Southern land.\r\n\r\nLESSON NO. 3.--Let this lesson be devoted to drawing comparisons to\r\nascertain: \"_Which pays the most taxes to the State, five parishes\r\ncontaining 17,524 whites with a few negroes, or five parishes containing\r\nless than half the whites (8,326) with a great many negroes?_\" By\r\nreferring to the report of the auditor it will be seen, that the 17,524\r\nwhites of the five parishes in table I pay the State only $25,487,93, or\r\nless than $1 50 each, while the 8,326 whites in the five parishes in\r\ntable II pay the State $169,900 per annum, or upward of $20 each. The\r\naggregate population of the parishes in table I pay only $1 06 each,\r\nwhile the aggregate population of the parishes in table II pay $2 66\r\neach. Every three whites and twenty negroes pay the State $61 18. By\r\nmaking a calculation it will appear that it will require forty-three\r\nwhites and fifteen negroes of the parishes in table I, to pay the State\r\nas much as three whites and twenty negroes pay in the parishes in table\r\nII.\r\n\r\nCOROLLARY.--Three white men with twenty negroes, financially considered,\r\nare worth as much to the State as forty-three white men with fifteen\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\nThis strange truth meets a steady explanation in the fact found in\r\nLesson No. 2, that in those parishes where every three white inhabitants\r\nown twenty negroes, the land is more than three times as valuable as in\r\nthe parishes, where every forty-three of the white population possess\r\nonly fifteen negroes.\r\n\r\nLESSON NO. 4.--In the last lesson the truth was brought out that\r\nforty-three white men and fifteen negroes are worth no more to the\r\nState, financially considered, than three white men and twenty negroes.\r\nLet this lesson examine the question: \"_Whether forty-three white men in\r\ncommand of fifteen negroes are worth AS MUCH to the State,\r\nagriculturally and commercially considered, as three white men in\r\ncommand of twenty negroes?_\" This is a bold question and requires some\r\ncalculations. In making the calculations to base the comparisons upon,\r\nsugar will be estimated at $60 per hogshead; molasses at $7 per barrel;\r\ncorn at $1 per bushel, and cotton at $40 dollars per bale. At these\r\nrates the value of the agricultural productions in the five parishes,\r\nwhere the white population is nearly three times as great as the negro,\r\namounts to $446,550, in a population of 17,524 whites, 6,038 negro\r\nslaves, and 343 free negroes--the aggregate population 23,905, which\r\ngives to each inhabitant $18 68.\r\n\r\nThe value of the agricultural productions in the five parishes, viz:\r\nCarroll, Concordia, Madison, Tensas, and West Feliciana, where the negro\r\nslaves are nearly seven times as numerous as the white population,\r\namounts to $8,854,770. In other words, 55,035 negroes under the command\r\nof 8,326 whites, in an aggregate population of 63,768 (407 being added\r\nfor free negroes), produced $8,854,770 worth of agricultural products in\r\none year, estimating cotton at $40 per bale, sugar $60 per hogshead, and\r\ncorn at $1 a bushel; this amount divided by the aggregate population\r\ngives each individual, black and white, old and young, $138 87. Three\r\nwhites in command of twenty negroes produce $3,194 worth of agricultral\r\nproducts. This lesson was to solve the question whether forty-three\r\nwhite men in command of fifteen negroes are worth as much to the State,\r\nagriculturally and commercially considered, as three white men in\r\ncommand of twenty negroes? It has been proved that in those five\r\nparishes where the whites nearly treble the negroes, each inhabitant\r\nonly produces $18 68. This would give to forty-three white and fifteen\r\nnegroes only $1,081 70 as their share of the value of the agricultural\r\nproductions--whereas, the share of three whites and twenty negroes, in\r\nthose parishes where the negro population is nearly seven to one of the\r\nwhite, has been ascertained to be $3,194. The student of political\r\neconomy is now prepared to solve another question: \"What number of\r\ninhabitants are required in those parishes where labor is isolated or\r\ndisassociated, to produce as much as three white and twenty negroes\r\nproduce in those parishes where labor is associated? The answer is 171;\r\nviz: 113 whites and 58 negroes. The question is proved to be correctly\r\nsolved by multiplying 171 by $18.68 which gives $1,394 25, the exact\r\namount and a quarter over, that twenty negroes and three whites produce\r\nin those parishes where labor is associated, or where the slave\r\npopulation is nearly seven times more numerous than the white.\r\n\r\nLESSON NO. 5.--Let two more lots of parishes be compared; one in which\r\nthe white population is not quite double that of the negro slaves, and\r\nthe other in which the negro slaves are not quite double the number of\r\nthe whites.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III.\r\n\r\n_Parishes where whites exceed negroes less than two to one._\r\n\r\n                Whites.

This is a considerable improvement on the five parishes in\r\ntable I, where the whites exceed the negroes nearly three to one, the\r\naverage to each inhabitant being only $18 68, instead of $48 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.\r\n\r\n_Parishes where negroes exceed whites less than two to one._\r\n\r\n                Whites.

In table\r\nII the aggregate population was 63,768, nearly seven negroes to one\r\nwhite man; the value of the agricultural products divided, gave each\r\n$138 07, instead of $83 25. The parishes of table II, with an aggregate\r\npopulation of 63,768, seven sixths of whom were slaves, produced\r\n$8,854,770 worth of agricultural products; whereas, the parishes of\r\ntable IV, containing a population of 68,168, the slaves being less than\r\ndouble the number of whites, produced three millions less of\r\nagricultural products than a smaller aggregate population produced in\r\nthose parishes where the negroes outnumbered the whites nearly seven to\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe report of the auditor of public accounts for the year 1859, does not\r\ncontain the necessary data for making comparisons in the parishes on the\r\nlower stem of the Mississippi river, by reason of crevasses and other\r\ndisastrous causes. The valuable pamphlet of Edward J. Forstale, on the\r\nagricultural products of Louisiana, will supply that deficiency, though\r\nof a much older date. It appears from Mr. Forstale, that, so far back as\r\n1844, \"on well conducted estates, the average value of sugar and\r\nmolasses, per slave, was $237 50, estimating sugar at 4 cents, and\r\nmolasses at 15 cents,\" while the general average in the sugar district,\r\nper slave, was, in the year 1844, only $150 31, from which he deducted\r\n$75 for expenses. By examining his Monograph, it will be seen that the\r\ngreat bulk of the sugar and molasses was produced in those parishes\r\nhaving the heaviest negro population in proportion to the white. Thus,\r\nSt. Martin's, with a total population more than three times as large as\r\nSt. Charles, and with a negro population more than twice as numerous,\r\nproduced, in 1844, only 5,000 hogsheads, while St. Charles produced\r\nupward of 12,000. The white population of St. Charles is only 883, while\r\nthat of the slaves is 3,769. The white population of St. Martin is\r\n6,400, and the negro population 8,200. Assumption and Ascension are\r\nadjoining parishes. Assumption contains more than three thousand whites,\r\nand three hundred slaves over and above the population of Ascension. It\r\nhas more land than Ascension, yet it pays $2,200 less taxes on lands\r\nthan Ascension, and its gross taxes are $1,500 less than Ascension. The\r\nvalue of its agricultural products is likewise less.\r\n\r\nThese lessons by comparison might be indefinitely extended, by dropping\r\nthe report of the auditor of public accounts of Louisiana, and taking up\r\nthe statistics of the churches, and the last United States census. The\r\nstatistics of the American churches prove that the slaveholding States\r\ncontain more Christian communicants, in proportion to the population,\r\nincluding black and white, than the non-slaveholding--South Carolina\r\nmore than Massachusetts, Virginia more than Pennsylvania, Kentucky more\r\nthan Ohio. The report proves that in the cotton and sugar region, the\r\nwhite people who have few or no negroes, are poor and helpless, but when\r\nsupplied with seven times their own number of negroes, they are the\r\nrichest and most powerful agricultural people on the earth. The census\r\nwill prove that the landed property of those who are thus supplied with\r\nfrom three to seven times their own number of negroes, if sold at its\r\nassessed value, and the proceeds of sales divided equally among all the\r\ninhabitants, black and white, each individual would have a larger sum\r\nthan any Pennsylvanian, New Yorker, or New Englander, would have, if the\r\nland in the richest counties were sold at its assessed value, and the\r\nproceeds of sales divided equally among the inhabitants of the said\r\ncounty. For instance, if the land in some of the richest counties of\r\nPennsylvania, say Adams, Berks, Centre, Chester, and Washington, were\r\nall sold, and the proceeds divided among the inhabitants, each\r\nindividual would have only about half as much as each negro and white\r\nman would have, if the lands of Carroll, Madison, Concordia, and Tensas,\r\nwhere the negroes outnumber the whites seven to one, were all sold, and\r\nthe proceeds equally divided among blacks and whites.\r\n\r\nComparisons, instituted upon the data furnished by the United States\r\ncensus, will show that what Virginia wants _is more negroes_, and what\r\nPennsylvania wants is _more white laborers_. In some counties in\r\nPennsylvania, Cambria and Carbon for instance, the land, if sold and\r\nproceeds divided, would not give each inhabitant $75 a piece, the most\r\nof the land being uncultivated for want of laborers. Ohio, Wyoming, and\r\nNicholas counties, in Virginia, with an aggregate population exceeding\r\nthirty thousand, have only 222 negro slaves. The land, if sold and\r\ndivided, would not give each inhabitant one hundred dollars. In Accomac,\r\nAlbemarle, York, Prince Edward, and Prince George, the negro population\r\nis about equal to the white. The land, if sold and equally divided,\r\nwould give each individual from $150 to $220, which is nearly as much as\r\nthe inhabitants of the best counties of Pennsylvania would have from the\r\nproceeds of sales of these lands. Land, per acre, is cheaper in Virginia\r\nthan in Pennsylvania, because much the largest portion of the Virginia\r\nlands are unimproved for the want of laborers, while the largest portion\r\nof the Pennsylvania lands are under cultivation. The cotton States and\r\nLouisiana are sucking the life-blood out of Virginia by draining that\r\nnoble old State of her agricultural laborers. The high price of negroes\r\nis ruining Virginia. In Sussex, Southampton, Northampton, and many other\r\ncounties, which send most negroes to the cotton States, the inhabitants\r\nhave lost more in the fall in the price of their land, than they have\r\ngained in the high price they got for their negroes. The land, if sold\r\nand divided, would give each individual only fifty-seven dollars, less\r\nthan three dollars an acre. Oxford is Great Britain's eye, or rather the\r\ntelescope which is used to see afar off, to direct British policy. Mr.\r\nJefferson saw the importance of a university of the first class, to be\r\nused as a telescope to look into the distance, to direct Virginia, or\r\nwhat ought to be the same thing, American policy, as Oxford directs\r\nBritish policy. Hence he devoted the latter years of his life to\r\nestablishing an institution for that very purpose.\r\n\r\nLong before the West India emancipation act was passed, it was known by\r\nthe learned graduates and fellows of Oxford, that negroes would not work\r\nas free laborers; and that their emancipation would ruin the British\r\nWest Indies. British policy, however, to build up India, imperatively\r\ndemanded the sacrifice to be made, as Russian policy demanded the\r\nsacrifice of Moscow. The African race furnished the only laborers, who\r\ncould compete with the Mongolian race in producing the rich products of\r\ntropical agriculture. Great Britain had a hundred and fifty millions of\r\nthe bronze and yellow-skin Asiatics under her command, and only wanted\r\nthe black-skin Africans out of the way, to monopolize tropical\r\nagriculture. To carry out the British policy of becoming, not only\r\nmistress of the seas, but mistress of the boundless wealth of tropical\r\nand tropicoid climates, the learned graduates of Oxford and Cambridge\r\nraised a hue and cry against the inhumanity of the _middle passage_. So\r\nlittle truth was there in it, that when the committee of the United\r\nStates Senate, appointed to consider the causes of the mortality\r\nprevailing on emigrant ships from Europe to this country, and the means\r\nfor the better protection of the health of the passengers, did me the\r\nhonor in 1854 to request my views on the subject, I replied (see\r\n\"_Report of the Select Committee of U. S. Senate on the Sickness and\r\nMortality on Emigrant Ships_,\" pages 119-144--Washington, 1854),\r\nrecommending certain rules to be adopted to preserve the health and\r\nameliorate the condition of emigrants on shipboard, which appeared to me\r\nto be the best. But, subsequently, a little volume fell into my hands\r\ncontaining the rules of the African slave-traders, half a century ago,\r\nwhich were so much better than those I had recommended, I called the\r\nattention of the chairman of the Senate's committee, the Hon. Hamilton\r\nFish, to them, advising him by all means to adopt the African\r\nslave-traders' rules, if he had any regard for the health and comfort of\r\nthe European emigrants. In the latter part of the last century no one\r\npretended, as now, that the negro lost any thing by exchanging slavery\r\nin Africa for the more benign system of slavery in America. But it was\r\nthe imaginary sufferings on the middle passage, which brought humanity\r\nwith her eyes shut to lend to British policy a helping hand to close\r\nAfrica and prevent her sable sons from exchanging their barbarous\r\nmasters for civilized ones. America consented to that policy. The\r\nSouthern tobacco-planters, believing they had as many negroes as the\r\ncultivation of tobacco required, had petitioned the king before the\r\nRevolution, to close the African slave trade. He did not do it. After\r\nthe Revolution it was not only closed, but declared to be piracy, by the\r\nfederal government. The policy which closed it may have been good policy\r\nor bad at that time. It soon gave the non-slaveholding States the\r\nascendency in the Union. The question, whether they shall retain that\r\nascendency, will depend very much upon whether they continue to abuse\r\nthe power they acquired over the South by cutting off the supply of\r\nSouthern laborers. Having ascertained that the negro would not work as a\r\nfree man, the next move of British policy was, to set those free who\r\nwere already in America. All parties in England, some by one artifice\r\nand some by another, were ultimately led to promote the British policy\r\nof negro abolitionism. From England it was brought over to the United\r\nStates, took root and grew so rapidly as soon to become a most\r\ndisturbing element in both church and state. We had no colleges at the\r\nNorth, and scarcely any churches which knew the advantages humanity and\r\nChristianity derived from the mutual aid the black and white races\r\nafford each other. The most of them are and were virtually European\r\ncolleges located in America. This has enabled those learned men in Great\r\nBritain, who guide and direct British policy, to make a nose of wax of\r\nthe great body of the educated classes in the United States. The\r\nprominence given to the Latin language, to the neglect of the Greek and\r\nHebrew, in our schools and colleges, has greatly tended to fill the\r\nheads of the students with monarchical ideas, and to prevent them from\r\nunderstanding and appreciating the institutions of their own country.\r\nThe study of Homer and the Greek classics favors genuine republicanism,\r\nby fostering a high-toned moral virtue, and by creating a love for\r\nnature and for political institutions founded upon her laws; while the\r\nstudy of Virgil, and other Latin text-books, used in our schools and\r\ncolleges, has a strong tendency to lead to a sickly sentimental\r\nadmiration for nominal instead of real freedom, and for governments\r\nfounded upon usurpations and artificial distinctions, as that of the\r\nCæsars was, and as that of Great Britain is. There is as much difference\r\nbetween Homer and Virgil as between nature and art. The Latin, being a\r\nderivative language, and of very little use, would long since have been\r\nbanished from the schools, but for the aid monarchy derives from its\r\nbinding men of letters, as Virgil bound the Muses, to the footstool of\r\nthrones, to flatter the frail humanity thereon with the incense of\r\ndivine honors. Homer's Muses, like true Americans, pay no higher honors\r\nto the diadem on the king's head than to the gaudy plumage of the\r\npeacock's tail. Young America would derive great advantages from an\r\nintimate acquaintance with Homer. He wrote in a language which gives to\r\nall the arts and sciences their technical terms. Hence, the previous\r\nstudy of the Greek makes the acquaintance of the various sciences\r\ncomparatively easy to the learner. The Greek and Hebrew being original\r\nlanguages, can be acquired in much less time than the Latin, which is a\r\nderivative language. It is to be hoped that the great University of the\r\nSouth, about to be established on the cool and salubrious plateau of the\r\nCumberland Mountains, if it does not banish Latin, will at least give a\r\ngreater degree of prominence to the Greek and Hebrew, the two languages\r\nin which the Scriptures were originally written. By comparing \"_The\r\nAnnual Report of the Superintendent of Public Education_, 1859, with\r\n\"_Les Lois concernant les Ecoles Publique dans l'Etat de la Louisiane_,\r\n1849,\" it will be perceived, that the New England system of public\r\neducation is not adapted to Louisiana and the South. The laws are\r\nexcellent, if the system itself was in conformity to the spirit of our\r\npolitical institutions. After ten years' trial, we learn from the Report\r\nof the Superintendent, that they can not be carried out, as no laws can\r\nbe, which are theoretical, burdensome, troublesome, expensive, and void\r\nof practical benefits. If a law were passed by the State of Louisiana\r\nappropriating three hundred thousand dollars per annum to furnishing\r\nevery family with a loaf of bread every day, it could not be executed.\r\nMore than half the families would not accept the bread. The Report of\r\nthe Superintendent of Public Education proves that more than half the\r\nfamilies in Louisiana will not accept of the mental food the State\r\noffers to their children. Some parishes will not receive any of it.\r\nTensas, for instance, which is taxed $16,000 for the support of public\r\nschools, has \"not a single public school,\" says the Report, \"in it, yet\r\nnearly every planter has a school in his own house.\" The truth is, that\r\ngovernment does more harm than good by interfering with the domestic\r\nconcerns of our people. If let alone, they would not need governmental\r\naid in furnishing food for either the body or the mind. The South would\r\nhave been far ahead in education, manufactures, and internal\r\nimprovements, if the federal government had not interfered, to shut out\r\nthe only kind of laborers who can labor in the cane and cotton field and\r\nlive. The system of public education, all admit, has failed in the\r\ncountry, but, it is asserted, has succeeded very well in New Orleans. If\r\nthe tree be judged by its fruits it is poisonous instead of salutary, to\r\nrepublican institutions, in our great cities. If the boys whom it has\r\ntaught to read novels, had been put to trades, they could not have been\r\ndriven away from the polls after they had grown to be men. There has\r\nbeen virtually no election in New Orleans, and in many of our large\r\ncities, for the last five or six years; whether from fear or\r\nindifference, it proves that the system of education is defective.\r\nAmerica wants a University to raise the standard of morals, manners, and\r\nlearning, so high, that every individual will be as secure from personal\r\nviolence at the sacred ballot-box, as at the church altar. America wants\r\nschools to raise the standard of moral virtue so high, that every\r\nAmerican citizen, naturalized or native, may confidently rely upon\r\ngovernment putting forth its whole power to protect him in all the\r\nrights and privileges of an American citizen, both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[275] Report of 1857, for the land in this parish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\nBY THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING thus finished our labors, and embodied in this work a range of\r\ndiscussion on slavery, occupying the whole ground, we have a word to say\r\nto those who are engaged in fomenting these mad schemes of the\r\nabolitionists. We ask you candidly and dispassionately to compare the\r\nspirit, tone, and style of argument in the work before you, with the\r\nwritings and speeches of the anti-slavery propagandists, such as\r\nCheever, Channing, Wendell Phillips, and _Sherman's protege_. In\r\nunsparing and vituperative denunciation they certainly excel; but are\r\nthey not filled with the most gross exaggerations and misrepresentations,\r\nnot to say willful falsehoods. Nowhere do you find that Christian candor\r\nand fairness of argument, that should characterize the search after\r\ntruth, but in their stead only positive assertions, and inflammatory\r\nappeals to the most vindictive passions of human nature.\r\n\r\nIn this crusade of the North against the South, there is a most\r\nunwarrantable and impertinent interference with the concerns of others,\r\nthat ought to be most sternly rebuked; and it is one of the encouraging\r\nsigns of the times, that the Southern people are at last roused from\r\ntheir inaction, and are vigorously engaged in adopting means of\r\nself-protection. Many, however, in the North are engaged in this crusade\r\nin order to divert attention from their own plague-spot--AGRARIANISM. We\r\nall recollect the Patroon of Albany and the Van Rensellaer mobs,--the\r\nFourerism and Socialism of the free States, and the ever-active\r\nantagonism of labor and capital. They are like the fleeing burglar, who,\r\nmore loudly than his pursuers, cries stop thief! For the time perhaps\r\nthey have succeeded in hounding on the rabble in full cry after the\r\nSouth, and in diverting attention from themselves. But how will they\r\nfare in the end? It is said of a certain animal, that when once it has\r\ntasted human blood it never relinquishes the chase; so when the mob\r\nshall have tasted the sweets of plunder and rapine in their raids upon\r\nthe South, will they spare the hoarded millions of the money-princes and\r\nnabobs of the North? Are there not thousands of needy and thriftless\r\nadventurers, or of starving and vicious poor, in the free States and\r\ncities of the North, who look with ill-concealed envy, or with gloating\r\nrapacity, on the prosperity and wealth of the aristocrats, as they term\r\nthem, of the spindle and loom, and of the counting-house? Ye\r\ncapitalists, ye merchant princes, ye master manufacturers, you may\r\nexcite to frenzy your Jacobin clubs, you may demoralize their minds of\r\nall ideas of right and wrong, but remember! the gullotine is suspended\r\nover your own necks!! The agrarian doctrines will ere long be applied to\r\nyourselves, for with whatsoever measure ye mete, it shall be measured to\r\nyou again.\r\n\r\nYe who profess to be the ministers of the Prince of peace, yet are\r\nengaged in preaching Sharp's rifles, or Brown's pikes; who teach that\r\nmurder is no crime, if committed by a slave upon his best friend, his\r\nmaster; that midnight incendiarism is meritorious; that the breach of\r\nevery command in the decalogue is commendable, if perpetrated under the\r\nguise of abolition philanthropy; who claim to possess a \"higher law\"\r\nthan the law of God; in fine, who preach every thing except Jesus\r\nChrist, and him crucified; how shall you escape the sentence of holy\r\nwrit: \"If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him\r\nall the plagues that are written in this book; and if any man shall take\r\naway from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away\r\nhis part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the\r\nthings which are written in this book.\"\r\n\r\nYe politicians, who, for the sake of place, power, and the spoils of\r\noffice, are engaged in alienating the feelings of both sections of our\r\nUnion; in producing division in our national councils; whose course is\r\nfast bringing about the dissolution of our Union; to whose skirts will\r\ncling the blood of the martyrs of liberty, so vainly shed?\r\n\r\nYe people of the North, our brothers by blood, by political\r\nassociations, by a community of interest; why will ye be led away by a\r\ncruel and misguided philanthropy, or by designing demagogues? why will\r\nye strive to inflict the most irreparable injury upon the objects of\r\nyour misplaced sympathy? reduce to ruins this fair fabric of liberty,\r\nand this happy land to desolation? Your own leaders acknowledge that,\r\nhitherto, your agitation, far from bettering the condition of the\r\nslaves, has only made it worse; and in some respects this is true. So\r\nlong as you confine yourselves to making or hearing abolition speeches,\r\nor forming among yourselves anti-slavery societies; so long as you\r\nconfine the agitation to yourselves, you neither injure nor benefit the\r\nslaves; your exuberant philanthropy escapes through the safety-valve in\r\nthe shape of gas. But when you attempt to circulate among them\r\nincendiary documents, intended to render them unhappy, and discontented\r\nwith their lot, it becomes our duty to protect them against your\r\nmachinations. This is the sole reason why most, if not all the slave\r\nStates, have forbidden the slaves to be taught to read. But for your\r\ninterference, most of our slaves would now have been able to read the\r\nword of God for themselves, instead of being dependent, as they now are,\r\non that _oral_ instruction, which is now so generally afforded them.\r\nWhen emissaries come among them, to give them _oral_ instruction\r\ndifferent from that contained in the word of God, instead of abridging\r\nthe privileges of the slave, we deal directly with the emissary, and\r\njustly, too; for we are acting not only in self-defense, but we are\r\nguarding this dependent race, committed by God to our care, from those\r\nmalign influences which would work evil, not only to us, but to\r\nthemselves, also. Could you succeed in your efforts--which you will find\r\nto be impossible--as the red republicans did in St. Domingo, or as the\r\nEnglish abolitionists did in Jamaica and Barbadoes, so far from having\r\nbettered the condition of the blacks, you would have inflicted on them\r\nan irreparable injury. But of this you will soon have an opportunity of\r\nsatisfying yourselves. We have among us a few hundred thousand of this\r\nrace, who have been emancipated through a mistaken philanthropy, and\r\nwho, though not injurious, are almost useless to us; these we have\r\nconcluded to colonize among you, that your lecturers, while lauding the\r\nblack man as being far superior to the white race, may never be in want\r\nof a specimen of the genuine article, to point to, as a proof of the\r\ntruth of their arguments. Some of the slave States--and most, if not all\r\nof them, will pursue the same policy--have already passed laws for the\r\nremoval of the free blacks from their borders, but allowing them the\r\noption of remaining, by choosing their masters, and returning to a state\r\nof servitude; and strange as you may think it, many have already done\r\nso, in preference to going among their friends, the abolitionists. This\r\nis done, not so much because we wish to be rid of this heterogeneous\r\nelement of our population, for at worst, they are, _with us_, only a\r\nkind of harmless dead weight, but because we wish to send them North as\r\nmissionaries, to convert the abolitionists and free soilers. If we may\r\njudge from the census and votes in the different counties in Ohio, the\r\nexperiment will be entirely successful, as those counties having the\r\nlargest black population, voted, in 1859, against the anti-slavery\r\nticket; whilst those which voted for it, possess but a meagre black\r\npopulation. Is this because an intimate acquaintance with the negro,\r\nconvinces the community that freedom is not the normal or proper\r\ncondition for him; or is it because he prefers to reside amongst those\r\nwho make least pretensions of friendship for him? The anti-slavery men\r\nmay take either horn of the dilemma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION BY THE EDITOR.                                      8\r\n\r\n\r\n  COTTON IS KING.\r\n\r\n    Preface to the Third Edition.                                 19\r\n    Preface to the Second Edition.                                26\r\n    Preface to the First Edition.                                 31\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    INTRODUCTORY STATEMENTS.\r\n\r\n         Character of the Slavery controversy in the United\r\n         States; In Great Britain; Its influence in\r\n         modifying the policy of Anti-Slavery men in\r\n         America; Course of the Churches; Political Parties;\r\n         Result, COTTON IS KING; Necessity of reviewing the\r\n         policy in relation to the African race; Topics\r\n         embraced in the discussion.                              33\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    THE EARLY MOVEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY; THE\r\n    CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE COLONIZATION SOCIETY TOOK\r\n    ITS RISE; THE RELATIONS IT SUSTAINED TO SLAVERY AND TO\r\n    THE SCHEMES PROJECTED FOR ITS ABOLITION; THE ORIGIN OF\r\n    THE ELEMENTS WHICH HAVE GIVEN TO AMERICAN SLAVERY ITS\r\n    COMMERCIAL VALUE AND CONSEQUENT POWERS OF EXPANSION;\r\n    AND THE FUTILITY OF THE MEANS USED TO PREVENT THE\r\n    EXTENSION OF THE INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n         Emancipation in the United States begun; First\r\n         Abolition Society organized; Progress of\r\n         Emancipation; First Cotton Mill; Exclusion of\r\n         Slavery from N.
