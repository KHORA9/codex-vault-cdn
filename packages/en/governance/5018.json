We are in the\r\nenjoyment of all the blessings of civil and religious liberty, with\r\nunexampled means of education, knowledge, and improvement. Through the year\r\nwhich is now drawing to a close peace has been in our borders and plenty in\r\nour habitations, and although disease has visited some few portions of the\r\nland with distress and mortality, yet in general the health of the people\r\nhas been preserved, and we are all called upon by the highest obligations\r\nof duty to renew our thanks and our devotion to our Heavenly Parent, who\r\nhas continued to vouchsafe to us the eminent blessings which surround us\r\nand who has so signally crowned the year with His goodness. If we find\r\nourselves increasing beyond example in numbers, in strength, in wealth, in\r\nknowledge, in everything which promotes human and social happiness, let us\r\never remember our dependence for all these on the protection and merciful\r\ndispensations of Divine Providence.\r\n\r\nSince your last adjournment Alexander McLeod, a British subject who was\r\nindicted for the murder of an American citizen, and whose case has been the\r\nsubject of a correspondence heretofore communicated to you, has been\r\nacquitted by the verdict of an impartial and intelligent jury, and has\r\nunder the judgment of the court been regularly discharged.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain having made known to this Government that the expedition\r\nwhich was fitted out from Canada for the destruction of the steamboat\r\nCaroline in the winter of 1837, and which resulted in the destruction of\r\nsaid boat and in the death of an American citizen, was undertaken by orders\r\nemanating from the authorities of the British Government in Canada, and\r\ndemanding the discharge of McLeod upon the ground that if engaged in that\r\nexpedition he did but fulfill the orders of his Government, has thus been\r\nanswered in the only way in which she could be answered by a government the\r\npowers of which are distributed among its several departments by the\r\nfundamental law. Happily for the people of Great Britain, as well as those\r\nof the United States, the only mode by which an individual arraigned for a\r\ncriminal offense before the courts of either can obtain his discharge is by\r\nthe independent action of the judiciary and by proceedings equally familiar\r\nto the courts of both countries.\r\n\r\nIf in Great Britain a power exists in the Crown to cause to be entered a\r\nnolle prosequi, which is not the case with the Executive power of the\r\nUnited States upon a prosecution pending in a State court, yet there no\r\nmore than here can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from custody\r\nwithout an order of the proper tribunal directing his discharge. The\r\nprecise stage of the proceedings at which such order may be made is a\r\nmatter of municipal regulation exclusively, and not to be complained of by\r\nany other government. In cases of this kind a government becomes\r\npolitically responsible only when its tribunals of last resort are shown to\r\nhave rendered unjust and injurious judgments in matters not doubtful. To\r\nthe establishment and elucidation of this principle no nation has lent its\r\nauthority more efficiently than Great Britain. Alexander McLeod, having his\r\noption either to prosecute a writ of error from the decision of the supreme\r\ncourt of New York, which had been rendered upon his application for a\r\ndischarge, to the Supreme Court of the United States, or to submit his case\r\nto the decision of a jury, preferred the latter, deeming it the readiest\r\nmode of obtaining his liberation; and the result has fully sustained the\r\nwisdom of his choice. The manner in which the issue submitted was tried\r\nwill satisfy the English Government that the principles of justice will\r\nnever fail to govern the enlightened decision of an American tribunal. I\r\ncan not fail, however, to suggest to Congress the propriety, and in some\r\ndegree the necessity, of making such provisions by law, so far as they may\r\nconstitutionally do so, for the removal at their commencement and at the\r\noption of the party of all such cases as may hereafter arise, and which may\r\ninvolve the faithful observance and execution of our international\r\nobligations, from the State to the Federal judiciary. This Government, by\r\nour institutions, is charged with the maintenance of peace and the\r\npreservation of amicable relations with the nations of the earth, and ought\r\nto possess without question all the reasonable and proper means of\r\nmaintaining the one and preserving the other. While just confidence is felt\r\nin the judiciary of the States, yet this Government ought to be competent\r\nin itself for the fulfillment of the high duties which have been devolved\r\nupon it under the organic law by the States themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September a party of armed men from Upper Canada invaded\r\nthe territory of the United States and forcibly seized upon the person of\r\none Grogan, and under circumstances of great harshness hurriedly carried\r\nhim beyond the limits of the United States and delivered him up to the\r\nauthorities of Upper Canada. His immediate discharge was ordered by those\r\nauthorities upon the facts of the case being brought to their knowledge--a\r\ncourse of procedure which was to have been expected from a nation with whom\r\nwe are at peace, and which was not more due to the rights of the United\r\nStates than to its own regard for justice. The correspondence which passed\r\nbetween the Department of State and the British envoy, Mr. Fox, and with\r\nthe governor of Vermont, as soon as the facts had been made known to this\r\ndepartment, are herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nI regret that it is not in my power to make known to you an equally\r\nsatisfactory conclusion in the case of the Caroline steamer, with the\r\ncircumstances connected with the destruction of which, in December, 1837,\r\nby an armed force fitted out in the Province of Upper Canada, you are\r\nalready made acquainted. No such atonement as was due for the public wrong\r\ndone to the United States by this invasion of her territory, so wholly\r\nirreconcilable with her rights as an independent power, has yet been made.\r\nIn the view taken by this Government the inquiry whether the vessel was in\r\nthe employment of those who were prosecuting an unauthorized war against\r\nthat Province or was engaged by the owner in the business of transporting\r\npassengers to and from Navy Island in hopes of private gain, which was most\r\nprobably the case, in no degree alters the real question at issue between\r\nthe two Governments. This Government can never concede to any foreign\r\ngovernment the power, except in a case of the most urgent and extreme\r\nnecessity, of invading its territory, either to arrest the persons or\r\ndestroy the property of those who may have violated the municipal laws of\r\nsuch foreign government or have disregarded their obligations arising under\r\nthe law of nations. The territory of the United States must be regarded as\r\nsacredly secure against all such invasions until they shall voluntarily\r\nacknowledge their inability to acquit themselves of their duties to others.\r\nAnd in announcing this sentiment I do but affirm a principle which no\r\nnation on earth would be more ready to vindicate at all hazards than the\r\npeople and Government of Great Britain. If upon a full investigation of all\r\nthe facts it shall appear that the owner of the Caroline was governed by a\r\nhostile intent or had made common cause with those who were in the\r\noccupancy of Navy Island, then so far as he is concerned there can be no\r\nclaim to indemnity for the destruction of his boat which this Government\r\nwould feel itself bound to prosecute, since he would have acted not only in\r\nderogation of the rights of Great Britain, but in clear violation of the\r\nlaws of the United States; but that is a question which, however settled,\r\nin no manner involves the higher consideration of the violation of\r\nterritorial sovereignty and jurisdiction. To recognize it as an admissible\r\npractice that each Government in its turn, upon any sudden and unauthorized\r\noutbreak which, on a frontier the extent of which renders it impossible for\r\neither to have an efficient force on every mile of it, and which outbreak,\r\ntherefore, neither may be able to suppress in a day, may take vengeance\r\ninto its own hands, and without even a remonstrance, and in the absence of\r\nany pressing or overruling necessity may invade the territory of the other,\r\nwould inevitably lead to results equally to be deplored by both. When\r\nborder collisions come to receive the sanction or to be made on the\r\nauthority of either Government general war must be the inevitable result.\r\nWhile it is the ardent desire of the United States to cultivate the\r\nrelations of peace with all nations and to fulfill all the duties of good\r\nneighborhood toward those who possess territories adjoining their own, that\r\nvery desire would lead them to deny the right of any foreign power to\r\ninvade their boundary with an armed force. The correspondence between the\r\ntwo Governments on this subject will at a future day of your session be\r\nsubmitted to your consideration; and in the meantime I can not but indulge\r\nthe hope that the British Government will see the propriety of renouncing\r\nas a rule of future action the precedent which has been set in the affair\r\nat Schlosser.\r\n\r\nI herewith submit the correspondence which has recently taken place between\r\nthe American minister at the Court of St. James, Mr. Stevenson, and the\r\nminister of foreign affairs of that Government on the right claimed by that\r\nGovernment to visit and detain vessels sailing under the American flag and\r\nengaged in prosecuting lawful commerce in the African seas. Our commercial\r\ninterests in that region have experienced considerable increase and have\r\nbecome an object of much importance, and it is the duty of this Government\r\nto protect them against all improper and vexatious interruption. However\r\ndesirous the United States may be for the suppression of the slave trade,\r\nthey can not consent to interpolations into the maritime code at the mere\r\nwill and pleasure of other governments. We deny the right of any such\r\ninterpolation to any one or all the nations of the earth without our\r\nconsent. We claim to have a voice in all amendments or alterations of that\r\ncode, and when we are given to understand, as in this instance, by a\r\nforeign government that its treaties with other nations can not be executed\r\nwithout the establishment and enforcement of new principles of maritime\r\npolice, to be applied without our consent, we must employ a language\r\nneither of equivocal import or susceptible of misconstruction. American\r\ncitizens prosecuting a lawful commerce in the African seas under the flag\r\nof their country are not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that\r\nflag by others; nor can they rightfully on account of any such alleged\r\nabuses be interrupted, molested, or detained while on the ocean, and if\r\nthus molested and detained while pursuing honest voyages in the usual way\r\nand violating no law themselves they are unquestionably entitled to\r\nindemnity. This Government has manifested its repugnance to the slave trade\r\nin a manner which can not be misunderstood. By its fundamental law it\r\nprescribed limits in point of time to its continuance, and against its own\r\ncitizens who might so far forget the rights of humanity as to engage in\r\nthat wicked traffic it has long since by its municipal laws denounced the\r\nmost condign punishment. Many of the States composing this Union had made\r\nappeals to the civilized world for its suppression long before the moral\r\nsense of other nations had become shocked by the iniquities of the traffic.\r\nWhether this Government should now enter into treaties containing mutual\r\nstipulations upon this subject is a question for its mature deliberation.\r\nCertain it is that if the right to detain American ships on the high seas\r\ncan be justified on the plea of a necessity for such detention arising out\r\nof the existence of treaties between other nations, the same plea may, be\r\nextended and enlarged by the new stipulations of new treaties to which the\r\nUnited States may not be a party. This Government will not cease to urge\r\nupon that of Great Britain full and ample remuneration for all losses,\r\nwhether arising from detention or otherwise, to which American citizens\r\nhave heretofore been or may hereafter be subjected by the exercise of\r\nrights which this Government can not recognize as legitimate and proper.\r\nNor will I indulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of Great Britain\r\nwill constrain her to make retribution for any wrong or loss which any\r\nAmerican citizen engaged in the prosecution of lawful commerce may have\r\nexperienced at the hands of her cruisers or other public authorities. This\r\nGovernment, at the same time, will relax no effort to prevent its citizens,\r\nif there be any so disposed, from prosecuting a traffic so revolting to the\r\nfeelings of humanity. It seeks to do no more than to protect the fair and\r\nhonest trader from molestation and injury; but while the enterprising\r\nmariner engaged in the pursuit of an honorable trade is entitled to its\r\nprotection, it will visit with condign punishment others of an opposite\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to existing laws for the suppression of the African\r\nslave trade, and recommend all such alterations as may give to them greater\r\nforce and efficacy. That the American flag is grossly abused by the\r\nabandoned and profligate of other nations is but too probable. Congress has\r\nnot long since had this subject under its consideration, and its importance\r\nwell justifies renewed and anxious attention.\r\n\r\nI also communicate herewith the copy of a correspondence between Mr.\r\nStevenson and Lord Palmerston upon the subject, so interesting to several\r\nof the Southern States, of the rice duties, which resulted honorably to the\r\njustice of Great Britain and advantageously to the United States.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the last annual session the President informed Congress\r\nof the progress which had then been made in negotiating a convention\r\nbetween this Government and that of England with a view to the final\r\nsettlement of the question of the boundary between the territorial limits\r\nof the two countries. I regret to say that little further advancement of\r\nthe object has been accomplished since last year, but this is owing to\r\ncircumstances no way indicative of any abatement of the desire of both\r\nparties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion and to settle the\r\nquestion in dispute as early as possible. In the course of the session it\r\nis my hope to be able to announce some further degree of progress toward\r\nthe accomplishment of this highly desirable end.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed by this Government for the exploration and survey\r\nof the line of boundary separating the States of Maine and New Hampshire\r\nfrom the conterminous British Provinces is, it is believed, about to close\r\nits field labors and is expected soon to report the results of its\r\nexaminations to the Department of State. The report, when received, will be\r\nlaid before Congress.\r\n\r\nThe failure on the part of Spain to pay with punctuality the interest due\r\nunder the convention of 1834 for the settlement of claims between the two\r\ncountries has made it the duty of the Executive to call the particular\r\nattention of that Government to the subject. A disposition has been\r\nmanifested by it, which is believed to be entirely sincere, to fulfill its\r\nobligations in this respect so soon as its internal condition and the state\r\nof its finances will permit. An arrangement is in progress from the result\r\nof which it is trusted that those of our citizens who have claims under the\r\nconvention will at no distant day receive the stipulated payments.\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium was concluded and signed\r\nat Washington on the 29th of March, 1840, and was duly sanctioned by the\r\nSenate of the United States. The treaty was ratified by His Belgian\r\nMajesty, but did not receive the approbation of the Belgian Chambers within\r\nthe time limited by its terms, and has therefore become void.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence assumes the graver aspect from the consideration that in\r\n1833 a treaty negotiated between the two Governments and ratified on the\r\npart of the United States failed to be ratified on the part of Belgium. The\r\nrepresentative of that Government at Washington informs the Department of\r\nState that he has been instructed to give explanations of the causes which\r\noccasioned delay in the approval of the late treaty by the legislature, and\r\nto express the regret of the King at the occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the convention with Texas to ascertain the true\r\nboundary between the two countries has concluded its labors, but the final\r\nreport of the commissioner of the United States has not been received. It\r\nis understood, however, that the meridian line as traced by the commission\r\nlies somewhat farther east than the position hitherto generally assigned to\r\nit, and consequently includes in Texas some part of the territory which had\r\nbeen considered as belonging to the States of Louisiana and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThe United States can not but take a deep interest in whatever relates to\r\nthis young but growing Republic. Settled principally by emigrants from the\r\nUnited States, we have the happiness to know that the great principles of\r\ncivil liberty are there destined to flourish under wise institutions and\r\nwholesome laws, and that through its example another evidence is to be\r\nafforded of the capacity of popular institutions to advance the prosperity,\r\nhappiness, and permanent glory of the human race. The great truth that\r\ngovernment was made for the people and not the people for government has\r\nalready been established in the practice and by the example of these United\r\nStates, and we can do no other than contemplate its further exemplification\r\nby a sister republic with the deepest interest.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the independent States of this hemisphere, formerly\r\nunder the dominion of Spain, have not undergone any material change within\r\nthe past year. The incessant sanguinary conflicts in or between those\r\ncountries are to be greatly deplored as necessarily tending to disable them\r\nfrom performing their duty as members of the community of nations and\r\nrising to the destiny which the position and natural resources of many of\r\nthem might lead them justly to anticipate, as constantly giving occasion\r\nalso, directly or indirectly, for complaints on the part of our citizens\r\nwho resort thither for purposes of commercial intercourse, and as retarding\r\nreparation for wrongs already committed, some of which are by no means of\r\nrecent date.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Congress of Ecuador to hold a session at the time\r\nappointed for that purpose, in January last, will probably render abortive\r\na treaty of commerce with that Republic, which was signed at Quito on the\r\n13th of June, 1839, and had been duly ratified on our part, but which\r\nrequired the approbation of that body prior to its ratification by the\r\nEcuadorian Executive.\r\n\r\nA convention which has been concluded with the Republic of Peru, providing\r\nfor the settlement of certain claims of citizens of the United States upon\r\nthe Government of that Republic, will be duly submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens against the Brazilian Government originating\r\nfrom captures and other causes are still unsatisfied. The United States\r\nhave, however, so uniformly shown a disposition to cultivate relations of\r\namity with that Empire that it is hoped the unequivocal tokens of the same\r\nspirit toward us which an adjustment of the affairs referred to would\r\nafford will be given without further avoidable delay.\r\n\r\nThe war with the Indian tribes on the peninsula of Florida has during the\r\nlast summer and fall been prosecuted with untiring activity and zeal. A\r\nsummer campaign was resolved upon as the best mode of bringing it to a\r\nclose. Our brave officers and men who have been engaged in that service\r\nhave suffered toils and privations and exhibited an energy which in any\r\nother war would have won for them unfading laurels. In despite of the\r\nsickness incident to the climate, they have penetrated the fastnesses of\r\nthe Indians, broken up their encampments, and harassed them unceasingly.\r\nNumbers have been captured, and still greater numbers have surrendered and\r\nhave been transported to join their brethren on the lands elsewhere\r\nallotted to them by the Government, and a strong hope is entertained that\r\nunder the conduct of the gallant officer at the head of the troops in\r\nFlorida that troublesome and expensive war is destined to a speedy\r\ntermination. With all the other Indian tribes we are enjoying the blessings\r\nof peace. Our duty as well as our best interests prompts us to observe in\r\nall our intercourse with them fidelity in fulfilling our engagements, the\r\npractice of strict justice, as well as the constant exercise of acts of\r\nbenevolence and kindness. These are the great instruments of civilization,\r\nand through the use of them alone can the untutored child of the forest be\r\ninduced to listen to its teachings.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, on whom the acts of Congress have devolved the duty\r\nof directing the proceedings for the taking of the sixth census or\r\nenumeration of the inhabitants of the United States, will report to the two\r\nHouses the progress of that work. The enumeration of persons has been\r\ncompleted, and exhibits a grand total of 17,069,453, making an increase\r\nover the census of 1830 of 4,202,646 inhabitants, and showing a gain in a\r\nratio exceeding 32 1/2 per cent for the last ten years.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of the Treasury you will be informed of\r\nthe condition of the finances. The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of\r\nJanuary last, as stated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nsubmitted to Congress at the extra session, was $987,345.03. The receipts\r\ninto the Treasury during the first three quarters of this year from all\r\nsources amount to $23,467,072.52; the estimated receipts for the fourth\r\nquarter amount to $6,943,095.25, amounting to $30,410,167.77, and making\r\nwith the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last $31,397,512.80.\r\nThe expenditures for the first three quarters of this year amount to\r\n$24,734,346.97. The expenditures for the fourth quarter as estimated will\r\namount to $7,290,723.73, thus making a total of $32,025,070.70, and leaving\r\na deficit to be provided for on the 1st of January next of about\r\n$627,557.90.\r\n\r\nOf the loan of $12,000,000 which was authorized by Congress at its late\r\nsession only $5,432,726.88 have been negotiated. The shortness of time\r\nwhich it had to run has presented no inconsiderable impediment in the way\r\nof its being taken by capitalists at home, while the same cause would have\r\noperated with much greater force in the foreign market. For that reason the\r\nforeign market has not been resorted to; and it is now submitted whether it\r\nwould not be advisable to amend the law by making what remains undisposed\r\nof payable at a more distant day.\r\n\r\nShould it be necessary, in any view that Congress may take of the subject,\r\nto revise the existing tariff of duties, I beg leave to say that in the\r\nperformance of that most delicate operation moderate counsels would seem to\r\nbe the wisest. The Government under which it is our happiness to live owes\r\nits existence to the spirit of compromise which prevailed among its\r\nframers; jarring and discordant opinions could only have been reconciled by\r\nthat noble spirit of patriotism which prompted conciliation and resulted in\r\nharmony. In the same spirit the compromise bill, as it is commonly called,\r\nwas adopted at the session of 1833. While the people of no portion of the\r\nUnion will ever hesitate to pay all necessary taxes for the support of\r\nGovernment, yet an innate repugnance exists to the imposition of burthens\r\nnot really necessary for that object. In imposing duties, however, for the\r\npurposes of revenue a right to discriminate as to the articles on which the\r\nduty shall be laid, as well as the amount, necessarily and most properly\r\nexists; otherwise the Government would be placed in the condition of having\r\nto levy the same duties upon all articles, the productive as well as the\r\nunproductive. The slightest duty upon some might have the effect of causing\r\ntheir importation to cease, whereas others, entering extensively into the\r\nconsumption of the country, might bear the heaviest without any sensible\r\ndiminution in the amount imported. So also the Government may be justified\r\nin so discriminating by reference to other considerations of domestic\r\npolicy connected with our manufactures. So long as the duties shall be laid\r\nwith distinct reference to the wants of the Treasury no well-rounded\r\nobjection can exist against them. It might be esteemed desirable that no\r\nsuch augmentation of the taxes should take place as would have the effect\r\nof annulling the land-proceeds distribution act of the last session, which\r\nact is declared to be inoperative the moment the duties are increased\r\nbeyond 20 per cent, the maximum rate established by the compromise act.\r\nSome of the provisions of the compromise act, which will go into effect on\r\nthe 30th day of June next, may, however, be found exceedingly inconvenient\r\nin practice under any regulations that Congress may adopt. I refer more\r\nparticularly to that relating to the home valuation. A difference in value\r\nof the same articles to some extent will necessarily exist at different\r\nports, but that is altogether insignificant when compared with the\r\nconflicts in valuation which are likely to arise from the differences of\r\nopinion among the numerous appraisers of merchandise. In many instances the\r\nestimates of value must be conjectural, and thus as many different rates of\r\nvalue may be established as there are appraisers. These differences in\r\nvaluation may also be increased by the inclination which, without the\r\nslightest imputation on their honesty, may arise on the part of the\r\nappraisers in favor of their respective ports of entry. I recommend this\r\nwhole subject to the consideration of Congress with a single additional\r\nremark. Certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy are\r\nin all respects eminently desirable, but more particularly is this true in\r\nall that affects trade and commerce, the operations of which depend much\r\nmore on the certainty of their returns and calculations which embrace\r\ndistant periods of time than on high bounties or duties, which are liable\r\nto constant fluctuations.\r\n\r\nAt your late session I invited your attention to the condition of the\r\ncurrency and exchanges and urged the necessity of adopting such measures as\r\nwere consistent with the constitutional competency of the Government in\r\norder to correct the unsoundness of the one and, as far as practicable, the\r\ninequalities of the other. No country can be in the enjoyment of its full\r\nmeasure of prosperity without the presence of a medium of exchange\r\napproximating to uniformity of value. What is necessary as between the\r\ndifferent nations of the earth is also important as between the inhabitants\r\nof different parts of the same country. With the first the precious metals\r\nconstitute the chief medium of circulation, and such also would be the case\r\nas to the last but for inventions comparatively modern, which have\r\nfurnished in place of gold and silver a paper circulation. I do not propose\r\nto enter into a comparative analysis of the merits of the two systems. Such\r\nbelonged more properly to the period of the introduction of the paper\r\nsystem. The speculative philosopher might find inducements to prosecute the\r\ninquiry, but his researches could only lead him to conclude that the paper\r\nsystem had probably better never have been introduced and that society\r\nmight have been much happier without it. The practical statesman has a very\r\ndifferent task to perform. He has to look at things as they are, to take\r\nthem as he finds them, to supply deficiencies and to prune excesses as far\r\nas in him lies. The task of furnishing a corrective for derangements of the\r\npaper medium with us is almost inexpressibly great. The power exerted by\r\nthe States to charter banking corporations, and which, having been carried\r\nto a great excess, has filled the country with, in most of the States, an\r\nirredeemable paper medium, is an evil which in some way or other requires a\r\ncorrective. The rates at which bills of exchange are negotiated between\r\ndifferent parts of the country furnish an index of the value of the local\r\nsubstitute for gold and silver, which is in many parts so far depreciated\r\nas not to be received except at a large discount in payment of debts or in\r\nthe purchase of produce. It could earnestly be desired that every bank not\r\npossessing the means of resumption should follow the example of the late\r\nUnited States Bank of Pennsylvania and go into liquidation rather than by\r\nrefusing to do so to continue embarrassments in the way of solvent\r\ninstitutions, thereby augmenting the difficulties incident to the present\r\ncondition of things. Whether this Government, with due regard to the rights\r\nof the States, has any power to constrain the banks either to resume specie\r\npayments or to force them into liquidation, is an inquiry which will not\r\nfail to claim your consideration. In view of the great advantages which are\r\nallowed the corporators, not among the least of which is the authority\r\ncontained in most of their charters to make loans to three times the amount\r\nof their capital, thereby often deriving three times as much interest on\r\nthe same amount of money as any individual is permitted by law to receive,\r\nno sufficient apology can be urged for a long-continued suspension of\r\nspecie payments. Such suspension is productive of the greatest detriment to\r\nthe public by expelling from circulation the precious metals and seriously\r\nhazarding the success of any effort that this Government can make to\r\nincrease commercial facilities and to advance the public interests.\r\n\r\nThis is the more to be regretted and the indispensable necessity for a\r\nsound currency becomes the more manifest when we reflect on the vast amount\r\nof the internal commerce of the country. Of this we have no statistics nor\r\njust data for forming adequate opinions. But there can be no doubt but that\r\nthe amount of transportation coastwise by sea, and the transportation\r\ninland by railroads and canals, and by steamboats and other modes of\r\nconveyance over the surface of our vast rivers and immense lakes, and the\r\nvalue of property carried and interchanged by these means form a general\r\naggregate to which the foreign commerce of the country, large as it is,\r\nmakes but a distant approach.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any controlling power over this subject, which, by\r\nforcing a general resumption of specie payments, would at once have the\r\neffect of restoring a sound medium of exchange and would leave to the\r\ncountry but little to desire, what measure of relief falling within the\r\nlimits of our constitutional competency does it become this Government to\r\nadopt? It was my painful duty at your last session, under the weight of\r\nmost solemn obligations, to differ with Congress on the measures which it\r\nproposed for my approval, and which it doubtless regarded as corrective of\r\nexisting evils. Subsequent reflection and events since occurring have only\r\nserved to confirm me in the opinions then entertained and frankly\r\nexpressed. I must be permitted to add that no scheme of governmental policy\r\nunaided by individual exertions can be available for ameliorating the\r\npresent condition of things. Commercial modes of exchange and a good\r\ncurrency are but the necessary means of commerce and intercourse, not the\r\ndirect productive sources of wealth. Wealth can only be accumulated by the\r\nearnings of industry and the savings of frugality, and nothing can be more\r\nill judged than to look to facilities in borrowing or to a redundant\r\ncirculation for the power of discharging pecuniary obligations. The country\r\nis full of resources and the people fall of energy, and the great and\r\npermanent remedy for present embarrassments must be sought in industry,\r\neconomy, the observance of good faith, and the favorable influence of time.\r\nIn pursuance of a pledge given to you in my last message to Congress, which\r\npledge I urge as an apology for adventuring to present you the details of\r\nany plan, the Secretary of the Treasury will be ready to submit to you,\r\nshould you require it, a plan of finance which, while it throws around the\r\npublic treasure reasonable guards for its protection and rests on powers\r\nacknowledged in practice to exist from the origin of the Government, will\r\nat the same time furnish to the country a sound paper medium and afford all\r\nreasonable facilities for regulating the exchanges. When submitted, you\r\nwill perceive in it a plan amendatory of the existing laws in relation to\r\nthe Treasury Department, subordinate in all respects to the will of\r\nCongress directly and the will of the people indirectly, self-sustaining\r\nshould it be found in practice to realize its promises in theory, and\r\nrepealable at the pleasure of Congress. It proposes by effectual restraints\r\nand by invoking the true spirit of our institutions to separate the purse\r\nfrom the sword, or, more properly to speak, denies any other control to the\r\nPresident over the agents who may be selected to carry it into execution\r\nbut what may be indispensably necessary to secure the fidelity of such\r\nagents, and by wise regulations keeps plainly apart from each other private\r\nand public funds. It contemplates the establishment of a board of control\r\nat the seat of government, with agencies at prominent commercial points or\r\nwherever else Congress shall direct, for the safe-keeping and disbursement\r\nof the public moneys and a substitution at the option of the public\r\ncreditor of Treasury notes in lieu of gold and silver. It proposes to limit\r\nthe issues to an amount not to exceed $15,000,000 without the express\r\nsanction of the legislative power. It also authorizes the receipt of\r\nindividual deposits of gold and silver to a limited amount, and the\r\ngranting certificates of deposit divided into such sums as may be called\r\nfor by the depositors. It proceeds a step further and authorizes the\r\npurchase and sale of domestic bills and drafts resting on a real and\r\nsubstantial basis, payable at sight or having but a short time to run, and\r\ndrawn on places not less than 100 miles apart, which authority, except in\r\nso far as may be necessary for Government purposes exclusively, is only to\r\nbe exerted upon the express condition that its exercise shall not be\r\nprohibited by the State in which the agency is situated. In order to cover\r\nthe expenses incident to the plan, it will be authorized to receive\r\nmoderate premiums for certificates issued on deposits and on bills bought\r\nand sold, and thus, as far as its dealings extend, to furnish facilities to\r\ncommercial intercourse at the lowest possible rates and to subduct from the\r\nearnings of industry the least possible sum. It uses the State banks at a\r\ndistance from the agencies as auxiliaries without imparting any power to\r\ntrade in its name. It is subjected to such guards and restraints as have\r\nappeared to be necessary. It is the creature of law and exists only at the\r\npleasure of the Legislature. It is made to rest on an actual specie basis\r\nin order to redeem the notes at the places of issue, produces no dangerous\r\nredundancy of circulation, affords no temptation to speculation, is\r\nattended by no inflation of prices, is equable in its operation, makes the\r\nTreasury notes (which it may use along with the certificates of deposit and\r\nthe notes of specie-paying banks) convertible at the place where collected,\r\nreceivable in payment of Government dues, and without violating any\r\nprinciple of the Constitution affords the Government and the people such\r\nfacilities as are called for by the wants of both. Such, it has appeared to\r\nme, are its recommendations, and in view of them it will be submitted,\r\nwhenever you may require it, to your consideration.\r\n\r\nI am not able to perceive that any fair and candid objection can be urged\r\nagainst the plan, the principal outlines of which I have thus presented. I\r\ncan not doubt but that the notes which it proposes to furnish at the\r\nvoluntary option of the public creditor, issued in lieu of the revenue and\r\nits certificates of deposit, will be maintained at an equality with gold\r\nand silver everywhere. They are redeemable in gold and silver on demand at\r\nthe places of issue. They are receivable everywhere in payment of\r\nGovernment dues. The Treasury notes are limited to an amount of one-fourth\r\nless than the estimated annual receipts of the Treasury, and in addition\r\nthey rest upon the faith of the Government for their redemption. If all\r\nthese assurances are not sufficient to make them available, then the idea,\r\nas it seems to me, of furnishing a sound paper medium of exchange may be\r\nentirely abandoned.\r\n\r\nIf a fear be indulged that the Government may be tempted to run into excess\r\nin its issues at any future day, it seems to me that no such apprehension\r\ncan reasonably be entertained until all confidence in the representatives\r\nof the States and of the people, as well as of the people themselves, shall\r\nbe lost. The weightiest considerations of policy require that the\r\nrestraints now proposed to be thrown around the measure should not for\r\nlight causes be removed. To argue against any proposed plan its liability\r\nto possible abuse is to reject every expedient, since everything dependent\r\non human action is liable to abuse. Fifteen millions of Treasury notes may\r\nbe issued as the maximum, but a discretionary power is to be given to the\r\nboard of control under that sum, and every consideration will unite in\r\nleading them to feel their way with caution. For the first eight years of\r\nthe existence of the late Bank of the United States its circulation barely\r\nexceeded $4,000,000, and for five of its most prosperous years it was about\r\nequal to $16,000,000; furthermore, the authority given to receive private\r\ndeposits to a limited amount and to issue certificates in such sums as may\r\nbe called for by the depositors may so far fill up the channels of\r\ncirculation as greatly to diminish the necessity of any considerable issue\r\nof Treasury notes. A restraint upon the amount of private deposits has\r\nseemed to be indispensably necessary from an apprehension, thought to be\r\nwell founded, that in any emergency of trade confidence might be so far\r\nshaken in the banks as to induce a withdrawal from them of private deposits\r\nwith a view to insure their unquestionable safety when deposited with the\r\nGovernment, which might prove eminently disastrous to the State banks. Is\r\nit objected that it is proposed to authorize the agencies to deal in bills\r\nof exchange? It is answered that such dealings are to be carried on at the\r\nlowest possible premium, are made to rest on an unquestionably sound basis,\r\nare designed to reimburse merely the expenses which would otherwise devolve\r\nupon the Treasury, and are in strict subordination to the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court in the case of the Bank of Augusta against Earle, and other\r\nreported cases, and thereby avoids all conflict with State jurisdiction,\r\nwhich I hold to be indispensably requisite. It leaves the banking\r\nprivileges of the States without interference, looks to the Treasury and\r\nthe Union, and while furnishing every facility to the first is careful of\r\nthe interests of the last. But above all, it is created by law, is\r\namendable by law, and is repealable by law, and, wedded as I am to no\r\ntheory, but looking solely to the advancement of the public good, I shall\r\nbe among the very first to urge its repeal if it be found not to subserve\r\nthe purposes and objects for which it may be created. Nor will the plan be\r\nsubmitted in any overweening confidence in the sufficiency of my own\r\njudgment, but with much greater reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of\r\nCongress. I can not abandon this subject without urging upon you in the\r\nmost emphatic manner, whatever may be your action on the suggestions which\r\nI have felt it to be my duty to submit, to relieve the Chief Executive\r\nMagistrate, by any and all constitutional means, from a controlling power\r\nover the public Treasury. If in the plan proposed, should you deem it\r\nworthy of your consideration, that separation is not as complete as you may\r\ndesire, you will doubtless amend it in that particular. For myself, I\r\ndisclaim all desire to have any control over the public moneys other than\r\nwhat is indispensably necessary to execute the laws which you may pass.\r\n\r\nNor can I fail to advert in this connection to the debts which many of the\r\nStates of the Union have contracted abroad and under which they continue to\r\nlabor. That indebtedness amounts to a sum not less than $200,000,000, and\r\nwhich has been retributed to them for the most part in works of internal\r\nimprovement which are destined to prove of vast importance in ultimately\r\nadvancing their prosperity and wealth. For the debts thus contracted the\r\nStates are alone responsible. I can do not more than express the belief\r\nthat each State will feel itself bound by every consideration of honor as\r\nwell as of interest to meet its engagements with punctuality. The failure,\r\nhowever, of any one State to do so should in no degree affect the credit of\r\nthe rest, and the foreign capitalist will have no just cause to experience\r\nalarm as to all other State stocks because any one or more of the States\r\nmay neglect to provide with punctuality the means of redeeming their\r\nengagements. Even such States, should there be any, considering the great\r\nrapidity with which their resources are developing themselves, will not\r\nfail to have the means at no very distant day to redeem their obligations\r\nto the uttermost farthing; nor will I doubt but that, in view of that\r\nhonorable conduct which has evermore governed the States and the people of\r\nthe Union, they will each and all resort to every legitimate expedient\r\nbefore they will forego a faithful compliance with their obligations.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of War and other reports accompanying it\r\nyou will be informed of the progress which has been made in the\r\nfortifications designed for the protection of our principal cities,\r\nroadsteads, and inland frontier during the present year, together with\r\ntheir true state and condition. They will be prosecuted to completion with\r\nall the expedition which the means placed by Congress at the disposal of\r\nthe Executive will allow.\r\n\r\nI recommend particularly to your consideration that portion of the\r\nSecretary's report which proposes the establishment of a chain of military\r\nposts from Council Bluffs to some point on the Pacific Ocean within our\r\nlimits. The benefit thereby destined to accrue to our citizens engaged in\r\nthe fur trade over that wilderness region, added to the importance of\r\ncultivating friendly relations with savage tribes inhabiting it, and at the\r\nsame time of giving protection to our frontier settlements and of\r\nestablishing the means of safe intercourse between the American settlements\r\nat the mouth of the Columbia River and those on this side of the Rocky\r\nMountains, would seem to suggest the importance of carrying into effect the\r\nrecommendations upon this head with as little delay as may be practicable.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy will place you in possession of the\r\npresent condition of that important arm of the national defense. Every\r\neffort will be made to add to its efficiency, and I can not too strongly\r\nurge upon you liberal appropriations to that branch of the public service.\r\nInducements of the weightiest character exist for the adoption of this\r\ncourse of policy. Our extended and otherwise exposed maritime frontier\r\ncalls for protection, to the furnishing of which an efficient naval force\r\nis indispensable. We look to no foreign conquests, nor do we propose to\r\nenter into competition with any other nation for supremacy on the ocean;\r\nbut it is due not only to the honor but to the security of the people of\r\nthe United States that no nation should be permitted to invade our waters\r\nat pleasure and subject our towns and villages to conflagration or pillage.\r\nEconomy in all branches of the public service is due from all the public\r\nagents to the people, but parsimony alone would suggest the withholding of\r\nthe necessary means for the protection of our domestic firesides from\r\ninvasion and our national honor from disgrace. I would most earnestly\r\nrecommend to Congress to abstain from all appropriations for objects not\r\nabsolutely necessary; but I take upon myself, without a moment of\r\nhesitancy, all the responsibility of recommending the increase and prompt\r\nequipment of that gallant Navy which has lighted up every sea with its\r\nvictories and spread an imperishable glory over the country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General will claim your particular attention,\r\nnot only because of the valuable suggestions which it contains, but because\r\nof the great importance which at all times attaches to that interesting\r\nbranch of the public service. The increased expense of transporting the\r\nmail along the principal routes necessarily claims the public attention,\r\nand has awakened a corresponding solicitude on the part of the Government.\r\nThe transmission of the mail must keep pace with those facilities of\r\nintercommunication which are every day becoming greater through the\r\nbuilding of railroads and the application of steam power, but it can not be\r\ndisguised that in order to do so the Post-Office Department is subjected to\r\nheavy exactions. The lines of communication between distant parts of the\r\nUnion are to a great extent occupied by railroads, which, in the nature of\r\nthings, possess a complete monopoly, and the Department is therefore liable\r\nto heavy and unreasonable charges. This evil is destined to great increase\r\nin future, and some timely measure may become necessary to guard against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI feel it my duty to bring under your consideration a practice which has\r\ngrown up in the administration of the Government, and which, I am deeply\r\nconvinced, ought to be corrected. I allude to the exercise of the power\r\nwhich usage rather than reason has vested in the Presidents of removing\r\nincumbents from office in order to substitute others more in favor with the\r\ndominant party. My own conduct in this respect has been governed by a\r\nconscientious purpose to exercise the removing power only in cases of\r\nunfaithfulness or inability, or in those in which its exercise appeared\r\nnecessary in order to discountenance and suppress that spirit of active\r\npartisanship on the part of holders of office which not only withdraws them\r\nfrom the steady and impartial discharge of their official duties, but\r\nexerts an undue and injurious influence over elections and degrades the\r\ncharacter of the Government itself, inasmuch as it exhibits the Chief\r\nMagistrate as being a party through his agents in the secret plots or open\r\nworkings of political parties.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the exercise of this power nothing should be left to\r\ndiscretion which may safely be regulated by law, and it is of high\r\nimportance to restrain as far as possible the stimulus of personal\r\ninterests in public elections. Considering the great increase which has\r\nbeen made in public offices in the last quarter of a century and the\r\nprobability of further increase, we incur the hazard of witnessing violent\r\npolitical contests, directed too often to the single object of retaining\r\noffice by those who are in or obtaining it by those who are out. Under the\r\ninfluence of these convictions I shall cordially concur in any\r\nconstitutional measure for regulating and, by regulating, restraining the\r\npower of removal.\r\n\r\nI suggest for your consideration the propriety of making without further\r\ndelay some specific application of the funds derived under the will of Mr.\r\nSmithson, of England, for the diffusion of knowledge, and which have\r\nheretofore been vested in public stocks until such time as Congress should\r\nthink proper to give them a specific direction. Nor will you, I feel\r\nconfident, permit any abatement of the principal of the legacy to be made\r\nshould it turn out that the stocks in which the investments have been made\r\nhave undergone a depreciation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I commend to your care the interests of this District, for\r\nwhich you are the exclusive legislators. Considering that this city is the\r\nresidence of the Government and for a large part of the year of Congress,\r\nand considering also the great cost of the public buildings and the\r\npropriety of affording them at all times careful protection, it seems not\r\nunreasonable that Congress should contribute toward the expense of an\r\nefficient police.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJohn Tyler\r\nDecember 6, 1842\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nWe have continued reason to express our profound gratitude to the Great\r\nCreator of All Things for numberless benefits conferred upon us as a\r\npeople. Blessed with genial seasons, the husbandman has his garners filled\r\nwith abundance, and the necessaries of life, not to speak of its luxuries,\r\nabound in every direction. While in some other nations steady and\r\nindustrious labor can hardly find the means of subsistence, the greatest\r\nevil which we have to encounter is a surplus of production beyond the home\r\ndemand, which seeks, and with difficulty finds, a partial market in other\r\nregions. The health of the country, with partial exceptions, has for the\r\npast year been well preserved, and under their free and wise institutions\r\nthe United States are rapidly advancing toward the consummation of the high\r\ndestiny which an overruling Providence seems to have marked out for them.\r\nExempt from domestic convulsion and at peace with all the world, we are\r\nleft free to consult as to the best means of securing and advancing the\r\nhappiness of the people. Such are the circumstances under which you now\r\nassemble in your respective chambers and which should lead us to unite in\r\npraise and thanksgiving to that great Being who made us and who preserves\r\nus as a nation.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the happy change in the aspect of\r\nour foreign affairs since my last annual message. Causes of complaint at\r\nthat time existed between the United States and Great Britain which,\r\nattended by irritating circumstances, threatened most seriously the public\r\npeace. The difficulty of adjusting amicably the questions at issue between\r\nthe two countries was in no small degree augmented by the lapse of time\r\nsince they had their origin. The opinions entertained by the Executive on\r\nseveral of the leading topics in dispute were frankly set forth in the\r\nmessage at the opening of your late session. The appointment of a special\r\nminister by Great Britain to the United States with power to negotiate upon\r\nmost of the points of difference indicated a desire on her part amicably to\r\nadjust them, and that minister was met by the Executive in the same spirit\r\nwhich had dictated his mission. The treaty consequent thereon having been\r\nduly ratified by the two Governments, a copy, together with the\r\ncorrespondence which accompanied it, is herewith communicated. I trust that\r\nwhilst you may see in it nothing objectionable, it may be the means of\r\npreserving for an indefinite period the amicable relations happily existing\r\nbetween the two Governments. The question of peace or war between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain is a question of the deepest interest, not\r\nonly to themselves, but to the civilized world, since it is scarcely\r\npossible that a war could exist between them without endangering the peace\r\nof Christendom. The immediate effect of the treaty upon ourselves will be\r\nfelt in the security afforded to mercantile enterprise, which, no longer\r\napprehensive of interruption, adventures its speculations in the most\r\ndistant seas, and, freighted with the diversified productions of every\r\nland, returns to bless our own. There is nothing in the treaty which in the\r\nslightest degree compromits the honor or dignity of either nation. Next to\r\nthe settlement of the boundary line, which must always be a matter of\r\ndifficulty between states as between individuals, the question which seemed\r\nto threaten the greatest embarrassment was that connected with the African\r\nslave trade.\r\n\r\nBy the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it was expressly declared\r\nthat--\r\n\r\nWhereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of\r\nhumanity and justice, and whereas both His Majesty and the United States\r\nare desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition,\r\nit is hereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best\r\nendeavors to accomplish so desirable an object.\r\n\r\nIn the enforcement of the laws and treaty stipulations of Great Britain a\r\npractice had threatened to grow up on the part of its cruisers of\r\nsubjecting to visitation ships sailing under the American flag, which,\r\nwhile it seriously involved our maritime rights, would subject to vexation\r\na branch of our trade which was daily increasing, and which required the\r\nfostering care of Government. And although Lord Aberdeen in his\r\ncorrespondence with the American envoys at London expressly disclaimed all\r\nright to detain an American ship on the high seas, even if found with a\r\ncargo of slaves on board, and restricted the British pretension to a mere\r\nclaim to visit and inquire, yet it could not well be discerned by the\r\nExecutive of the United States how such visit and inquiry could be made\r\nwithout detention on the voyage and consequent interruption to the trade.\r\nIt was regarded as the right of search presented only in a new form and\r\nexpressed in different words, and I therefore felt it to be my duty\r\ndistinctly to declare in my annual message to Congress that no such\r\nconcession could be made, and that the United States had both the will and\r\nthe ability to enforce their own laws and to protect their flag from being\r\nused for purposes wholly forbidden by those laws and obnoxious to the moral\r\ncensure of the world. Taking the message as his letter of instructions, our\r\nthen minister at Paris felt himself required to assume the same ground in a\r\nremonstrance which he felt it to be his duty to present to Mr. Guizot, and\r\nthrough him to the King of the French, against what has been called the\r\n\"quintuple treaty;\" and his conduct in this respect met with the approval\r\nof this Government. In close conformity with these views the eighth article\r\nof the treaty was framed; which provides \"that each nation shall keep\r\nafloat in the African seas a force not less than 80 guns, to act separately\r\nand apart, under instructions from their respective Governments, and for\r\nthe enforcement of their respective laws and obligations.\" From this it\r\nwill be seen that the ground assumed in the message has been fully\r\nmaintained at the same time that the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent\r\nare to be carried out in good faith by the two countries, and that all\r\npretense is removed for interference with our commerce for any purpose\r\nwhatever by a foreign government. While, therefore, the United States have\r\nbeen standing up for the freedom of the seas, they have not thought proper\r\nto make that a pretext for avoiding a fulfillment of their treaty\r\nstipulations or a ground for giving countenance to a trade reprobated by\r\nour laws. A similar arrangement by the other great powers could not fail to\r\nsweep from the ocean the slave trade without the interpolation of any new\r\nprinciple into the maritime code. We may be permitted to hope that the\r\nexample thus set will be followed by some if not all of them. We thereby\r\nalso afford suitable protection to the fair trader in those seas, thus\r\nfulfilling at the same time the dictates of a sound policy and complying\r\nwith the claims of justice and humanity.\r\n\r\nIt would have furnished additional cause for congratulation if the treaty\r\ncould have embraced all subjects calculated in future to lead to a\r\nmisunderstanding between the two Governments. The Territory of the United\r\nStates commonly called the Oregon Territory, lying on the Pacific Ocean\r\nnorth of the forty-second degree of latitude, to a portion of which Great\r\nBritain lays claim, begins to attract the attention of our fellow-citizens,\r\nand the tide of population which has reclaimed what was so lately an\r\nunbroken wilderness in more contiguous regions is preparing to flow over\r\nthose vast districts which stretch from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific\r\nOcean. In advance of the acquirement of individual rights to these lands,\r\nsound policy dictates that every effort should be resorted to by the two\r\nGovernments to settle their respective claims. It became manifest at an\r\nearly hour of the late negotiations that any attempt for the time being\r\nsatisfactorily to determine those rights would lead to a protracted\r\ndiscussion, which might embrace in its failure other more pressing matters,\r\nand the Executive did not regard it as proper to waive all the advantages\r\nof an honorable adjustment of other difficulties of great magnitude and\r\nimportance because this, not so immediately pressing, stood in the way.\r\nAlthough the difficulty referred to may not for several years to come\r\ninvolve the peace of the two countries, yet I shall not delay to urge on\r\nGreat Britain the importance of its early settlement. Nor will other\r\nmatters of commercial importance to the two countries be overlooked, and I\r\nhave good reason to believe that it will comport with the policy of\r\nEngland, as it does with that of the United States, to seize upon this\r\nmoment, when most of the causes of irritation have passed away, to cement\r\nthe peace and amity of the two countries by wisely removing all grounds of\r\nprobable future collision.\r\n\r\nWith the other powers of Europe our relations continue on the most amicable\r\nfooting. Treaties now existing with them should be rigidly observed, and\r\nevery opportunity compatible with the interests of the United States should\r\nbe seized upon to enlarge the basis of commercial intercourse. Peace with\r\nall the world is the true foundation of our policy, which can only be\r\nrendered permanent by the practice of equal and impartial justice to all.\r\nOur great desire should be to enter only into that rivalry which looks to\r\nthe general good in the cultivation of the sciences, the enlargement of the\r\nfield for the exercise of the mechanical arts, and the spread of\r\ncommerce--that great civilizer--to every land and sea. Carefully abstaining\r\nfrom interference in all questions exclusively referring themselves to the\r\npolitical interests of Europe, we may be permitted to hope an equal\r\nexemption from the interference of European Governments in what relates to\r\nthe States of the American continent.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of April last the commissioners on the part of the United States\r\nunder the convention with the Mexican Republic of the 11th of April, 1839,\r\nmade to the proper Department a final report in relation to the proceedings\r\nof the commission. From this it appears that the total amount awarded to\r\nthe claimants by the commissioners and the umpire appointed under that\r\nconvention was $2,026,079.68. The arbiter having considered that his\r\nfunctions were required by the convention to terminate at the same time\r\nwith those of the commissioners, returned to the board, undecided for want\r\nof time, claims which had been allowed by the American commissioners to the\r\namount of $928,620.88. Other claims, in which the amount sought to be\r\nrecovered was $3,336,837.05, were submitted to the board too late for its\r\nconsideration. The minister of the United States at Mexico has been duly\r\nauthorized to make demand for payment of the awards according to the terms\r\nof the convention and the provisions of the act of Congress of the 12th of\r\nJune, 1840. He has also been instructed to communicate to that Government\r\nthe expectations of the Government of the United States in relation to\r\nthose claims which were not disposed of according to the provisions of the\r\nconvention, and all others of citizens of the United States against the\r\nMexican Government. He has also been furnished with other instructions, to\r\nbe followed by him in case the Government of Mexico should not find itself\r\nin a condition to make present payment of the amount of the awards in\r\nspecie or its equivalent.\r\n\r\nI am happy to be able to say that information which is esteemed favorable\r\nboth to a just satisfaction of the awards and a reasonable provision for\r\nother claims has been recently received from Mr. Thompson, the minister of\r\nthe United States, who has promptly and efficiently executed the\r\ninstructions of his Government in regard to this important subject.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the United States who accompanied the late Texan expedition\r\nto Santa Fe, and who were wrongfully taken and held as prisoners of war in\r\nMexico, have all been liberated.\r\n\r\nA correspondence has taken place between the Department of State and the\r\nMexican minister of foreign affairs upon the complaint of Mexico that\r\ncitizens of the United States were permitted to give aid to the inhabitants\r\nof Texas in the war existing between her and that Republic. Copies of this\r\ncorrespondence are herewith communicated to Congress, together with copies\r\nof letters on the same subject addressed to the diplomatic corps at Mexico\r\nby the American minister and the Mexican secretary of state.\r\n\r\nMexico has thought proper to reciprocate the mission of the United States\r\nto that Government by accrediting to this a minister of the same rank as\r\nthat of the representative of the United States in Mexico. From the\r\ncircumstances connected with his mission favorable results are anticipated\r\nfrom it. It is so obviously for the interest of both countries as neighbors\r\nand friends that all just causes of mutual dissatisfaction should be\r\nremoved that it is to be hoped neither will omit or delay the employment of\r\nany practicable and honorable means to accomplish that end.\r\n\r\nThe affairs pending between this Government and several others of the\r\nStates of this hemisphere formerly under the dominion of Spain have again\r\nwithin the past year been materially obstructed by the military revolutions\r\nand conflicts in those countries.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the treaty between the United States and the Republic\r\nof Ecuador of the 13th of June, 1839, have been exchanged, and that\r\ninstrument has been duly promulgated on the part of this Government. Copies\r\nare now communicated to Congress with a view to enable that body to make\r\nsuch changes in the laws applicable to our intercourse with that Republic\r\nas may be deemed requisite.\r\n\r\nProvision has been made by the Government of Chile for the payment of the\r\nclaim on account of the illegal detention of the brig Warrior at Coquimbo\r\nin 1820. This Government has reason to expect that other claims of our\r\ncitizens against Chile will be hastened to a final and satisfactory close.\r\n\r\nThe Empire of Brazil has not been altogether exempt from those convulsions\r\nwhich so constantly afflict the neighboring republics. Disturbances which\r\nrecently broke out are, however, now understood to be quieted. But these\r\noccurrences, by threatening the stability of the governments, or by causing\r\nincessant and violent changes in them or in the persons who administer\r\nthem, tend greatly to retard provisions for a just indemnity for losses and\r\ninjuries suffered by individual subjects or citizens of other states. The\r\nGovernment of the United States will feel it to be its duty, however, to\r\nconsent to no delay not unavoidable in making satisfaction for wrongs and\r\ninjuries sustained by its own citizens. Many years having in some cases\r\nelapsed, a decisive and effectual course of proceeding will be demanded of\r\nthe respective governments against whom claims have been preferred.\r\n\r\nThe vexatious, harassing, and expensive war which so long prevailed with\r\nthe Indian tribes inhabiting the peninsula of Florida has happily been\r\nterminated, whereby our Army has been relieved from a service of the most\r\ndisagreeable character and the Treasury from a large expenditure. Some\r\ncasual outbreaks may occur, such as are incident to the close proximity of\r\nborder settlers and the Indians, but these, as in all other cases, may be\r\nleft to the care of the local authorities, aided when occasion may require\r\nby the forces of the United States. A sufficient number of troops will be\r\nmaintained in Florida so long as the remotest apprehensions of danger shall\r\nexist, yet their duties will be limited rather to the garrisoning of the\r\nnecessary posts than to the maintenance of active hostilities. It is to be\r\nhoped that a territory so long retarded in its growth will now speedily\r\nrecover from the evils incident to a protracted war, exhibiting in the\r\nincreased amount of its rich productions true evidences of returning wealth\r\nand prosperity. By the practice of rigid justice toward the numerous Indian\r\ntribes residing within our territorial limits and the exercise of a\r\nparental vigilance over their interests, protecting them against fraud and\r\nintrusion, and at the same time using every proper expedient to introduce\r\namong them the arts of civilized life, we may fondly hope not only to wean\r\nthem from their love of war, but to inspire them with a love for peace and\r\nall its avocations. With several of the tribes great progress in civilizing\r\nthem has already been made. The schoolmaster and the missionary are found\r\nside by side, and the remnants of what were once numerous and powerful\r\nnations may yet be preserved as the builders up of a new name for\r\nthemselves and their posterity.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January, 1842, exclusive of the\r\namount deposited with the States, trust funds, and indemnities, was\r\n$230,483.68. The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters\r\nof the present year from all sources amount to $26,616,593.78, of which\r\nmore than fourteen millions were received from customs and about one\r\nmillion from the public lands. The receipts for the fourth quarter are\r\nestimated at nearly eight millions, of which four millions are expected\r\nfrom customs and three millions and a half from loans and Treasury notes.\r\nThe expenditures of the first three quarters of the present year exceed\r\ntwenty-six millions, and those estimated for the fourth quarter amount to\r\nabout eight millions; and it is anticipated there will be a deficiency of\r\nhalf a million on the 1st of January next, but that the amount of\r\noutstanding warrants (estimated at $800,000) will leave an actual balance\r\nof about $224,000 in the Treasury. Among the expenditures of this year are\r\nmore than eight millions for the public debt and about $600,000 on account\r\nof the distribution to the States of the proceeds of sales of the public\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe present tariff of duties was somewhat hastily and hurriedly passed near\r\nthe close of the late session of Congress. That it should have defects can\r\ntherefore be surprising to no one. To remedy such defects as may be found\r\nto exist in any of its numerous provisions will not fail to claim your\r\nserious attention. It may well merit inquiry whether the exaction of all\r\nduties in cash does not call for the introduction of a system which has\r\nproved highly beneficial in countries where it has been adopted. I refer to\r\nthe warehousing system. The first and most prominent effect which it would\r\nproduce would be to protect the market alike against redundant or deficient\r\nsupplies of foreign fabrics, both of which in the long run are injurious as\r\nwell to the manufacturer as the importer. The quantity of goods in store\r\nbeing at all times readily known, it would enable the importer with an\r\napproach to accuracy to ascertain the actual wants of the market and to\r\nregulate himself accordingly. If, however, he should fall into error by\r\nimporting an excess above the public wants, he could readily correct its\r\nevils by availing himself of the benefits and advantages of the system thus\r\nestablished. In the storehouse the goods imported would await the demand of\r\nthe market and their issues would be governed by the fixed principles of\r\ndemand and supply. Thus an approximation would be made to a steadiness and\r\nuniformity of price, which if attainable would conduce to the decided\r\nadvantage of mercantile and mechanical operations.\r\n\r\nThe apprehension may be well entertained that without something to\r\nameliorate the rigor of cash payments the entire import trade may fall into\r\nthe hands of a few wealthy capitalists in this country and in Europe. The\r\nsmall importer, who requires all the money he can raise for investments\r\nabroad, and who can but ill afford to pay the lowest duty, would have to\r\nsubduct in advance a portion of his funds in order to pay the duties, and\r\nwould lose the interest upon the amount thus paid for all the time the\r\ngoods might remain unsold, which might absorb his profits. The rich\r\ncapitalist, abroad as well as at home, would thus possess after a short\r\ntime an almost exclusive monopoly of the import trade, and laws designed\r\nfor the benefit of all would thus operate for the benefit of a few--a\r\nresult wholly uncongenial with the spirit of our institutions and\r\nantirepublican in all its tendencies. The warehousing system would enable\r\nthe importer to watch the market and to select his own time for offering\r\nhis goods for sale. A profitable portion of the carrying trade in articles\r\nentered for the benefit of drawback must also be most seriously affected\r\nwithout the adoption of some expedient to relieve the cash system. The\r\nwarehousing system would afford that relief, since the carrier would have a\r\nsafe recourse to the public storehouses and might without advancing the\r\nduty reship within some reasonable period to foreign ports. A further\r\neffect of the measure would be to supersede the system of drawbacks,\r\nthereby effectually protecting the Government against fraud, as the right\r\nof debenture would not attach to goods after their withdrawal from the\r\npublic stores.\r\n\r\nIn revising the existing tariff of duties, should you deem it proper to do\r\nso at your present session, I can only repeat the suggestions and\r\nrecommendations which upon several occasions I have heretofore felt it to\r\nbe my duty to offer to Congress. The great primary and controlling interest\r\nof the American people is union--union not only in the mere forms of\r\ngovernment, forms which may be broken, but union rounded in an attachment\r\nof States and individuals for each other. This union in sentiment and\r\nfeeling can only be preserved by the adoption of that course of policy\r\nwhich, neither giving exclusive benefits to some nor imposing unnecessary\r\nburthens upon others, shall consult the interests of all by pursuing a\r\ncourse of moderation and thereby seeking to harmonize public opinion, and\r\ncausing the people everywhere to feel and to know that the Government is\r\ncareful of the interests of all alike. Nor is there any subject in regard\r\nto which moderation, connected with a wise discrimination, is more\r\nnecessary than in the imposition of duties on imports. Whether reference be\r\nhad to revenue, the primary object in the imposition of taxes, or to the\r\nincidents which necessarily flow from their imposition, this is entirely\r\ntrue. Extravagant duties defeat their end and object, not only by exciting\r\nin the public mind an hostility to the manufacturing interests, but by\r\ninducing a system of smuggling on an extensive scale and the practice of\r\nevery manner of fraud upon the revenue, which the utmost vigilance of\r\nGovernment can not effectually suppress. An opposite course of policy would\r\nbe attended by results essentially different, of which every interest of\r\nsociety, and none more than those of the manufacturer, would reap important\r\nadvantages. Among the most striking of its benefits would be that derived\r\nfrom the general acquiescence of the country in its support and the\r\nconsequent permanency and stability which would be given to all the\r\noperations of industry. It can not be too often repeated that no system of\r\nlegislation can be wise which is fluctuating and uncertain. No interest can\r\nthrive under it. The prudent capitalist will never adventure his capital in\r\nmanufacturing establishments, or in any other leading pursuit of life, if\r\nthere exists a state of uncertainty as to whether the Government will\r\nrepeal to-morrow what it has enacted to-day. Fitful profits, however high,\r\nif threatened with a ruinous reduction by a vacillating policy on the part\r\nof Government, will scarcely tempt him to trust the money which he has\r\nacquired by a life of labor upon the uncertain adventure. I therefore, in\r\nthe spirit of conciliation, and influenced by no other desire than to\r\nrescue the great interests of the country from the vortex of political\r\ncontention, and in the discharge of the high and solemn duties of the place\r\nwhich I now occupy, recommend moderate duties, imposed with a wise\r\ndiscrimination as to their several objects, as being not only most likely\r\nto be durable, but most advantageous to every interest of society.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the War Department exhibits a very full and\r\nsatisfactory account of the various and important interests committed to\r\nthe charge of that officer. It is particularly gratifying to find that the\r\nexpenditures for the military service are greatly reduced in amount--that a\r\nstrict system of economy has been introduced into the service and the\r\nabuses of past years greatly reformed. The fortifications on our maritime\r\nfrontier have been prosecuted with much vigor, and at many points our\r\ndefenses are in a very considerable state of forwardness. The suggestions\r\nin reference to the establishment of means of communication with our\r\nterritories on the Pacific and to the surveys so essential to a knowledge\r\nof the resources of the intermediate country are entitled to the most\r\nfavorable consideration. While I would propose nothing inconsistent with\r\nfriendly negotiations to settle the extent of our claims in that region,\r\nyet a prudent forecast points out the necessity of such measures as may\r\nenable us to maintain our rights. The arrangements made for preserving our\r\nneutral relations on the boundary between us and Texas and keeping in check\r\nthe Indians in that quarter will be maintained so long as circumstances may\r\nrequire. For several years angry contentions have grown out of the\r\ndisposition directed by law to be made of the mineral lands held by the\r\nGovernment in several of the States. The Government is constituted the\r\nlandlord, and the Citizens of the States wherein lie the lands are its\r\ntenants. The relation is an unwise one, and it would be much more conducive\r\nof the public interest that a sale of the lands should be made than that\r\nthey should remain in their present condition. The supply of the ore would\r\nbe more abundantly and certainly furnished when to be drawn from the\r\nenterprise and the industry of the proprietor than under the present\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Secretary in regard to the improvements of the\r\nWestern waters and certain prominent harbors on the Lakes merit, and I\r\ndoubt not will receive, your serious attention. The great importance of\r\nthese subjects to the prosperity of the extensive region referred to and\r\nthe security of the whole country in time of war can not escape\r\nobservation. The losses of life and property which annually occur in the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi alone because of the dangerous obstructions\r\nin the river make a loud demand upon Congress for the adoption of efficient\r\nmeasures for their removal.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy will bring you acquainted with that\r\nimportant branch of the public defenses. Considering the already vast and\r\ndaily increasing commerce of the country, apart from the exposure to\r\nhostile inroad of an extended seaboard, all that relates to the Navy is\r\ncalculated to excite particular attention. Whatever tends to add to its\r\nefficiency without entailing unnecessary charges upon the Treasury is well\r\nworthy of your serious consideration. It will be seen that while an\r\nappropriation exceeding by more than a million the appropriations of the\r\ncurrent year is asked by the Secretary, yet that in this sum is proposed to\r\nbe included $400,000 for the purchase of clothing, which when once expended\r\nwill be annually reimbursed by the sale of the clothes, and will thus\r\nconstitute a perpetual fund without any new appropriation to the same\r\nobject. To this may also be added $50,000 asked to cover the arrearages of\r\npast years and $250,000 in order to maintain a competent squadron on the\r\ncoast of Africa; all of which when deducted will reduce the expenditures\r\nnearly within the limits of those of the current year. While, however, the\r\nexpenditures will thus remain very nearly the same as of the antecedent\r\nyear, it is proposed to add greatly to the operations of the marine, and in\r\nlieu of only 25 ships in commission and but little in the way of building,\r\nto keep with the same expenditure 41 vessels afloat and to build 12 ships\r\nof a small class.\r\n\r\nA strict system of accountability is established and great pains are taken\r\nto insure industry, fidelity, and economy in every department of duty.\r\nExperiments have been instituted to test the quality of various materials,\r\nparticularly copper, iron, and coal, so as to prevent fraud and\r\nimposition.\r\n\r\nIt will appear by the report of the Postmaster-General that the great point\r\nwhich for several years has been so much desired has during the current\r\nyear been fully accomplished. The expenditures of the Department for\r\ncurrent service have been brought within its income without lessening its\r\ngeneral usefulness. There has been an increase of revenue equal to $166,000\r\nfor the year 1842 over that of 1841, without, as it is believed, any\r\naddition having been made to the number of letters and newspapers\r\ntransmitted through the mails. The post-office laws have been honestly\r\nadministered, and fidelity has been observed in accounting for and paying\r\nover by the subordinates of the Department the moneys which have been\r\nreceived. For the details of the service I refer you to the report.\r\n\r\nI flatter myself that the exhibition thus made of the condition of the\r\npublic administration will serve to convince you that every proper\r\nattention has been paid to the interests of the country by those who have\r\nbeen called to the heads of the different Departments. The reduction in the\r\nannual expenditures of the Government already accomplished furnishes a sure\r\nevidence that economy in the application of the public moneys is regarded\r\nas a paramount duty.\r\n\r\nAt peace with all the world, the personal liberty of the citizen sacredly\r\nmaintained and his rights secured under political institutions deriving all\r\ntheir authority from the direct sanction of the people, with a soil fertile\r\nalmost beyond example and a country blessed with every diversity of climate\r\nand production, what remains to be done in order to advance the happiness\r\nand prosperity of such a people? Under ordinary circumstances this inquiry\r\ncould readily be answered. The best that probably could be done for a\r\npeople inhabiting such a country would be to fortify their peace and\r\nsecurity in the prosecution of their various pursuits by guarding them\r\nagainst invasion from without and violence from within. The rest for the\r\ngreater part might be left to their own energy and enterprise. The chief\r\nembarrassments which at the moment exhibit themselves have arisen from\r\noveraction, and the most difficult task which remains to be accomplished is\r\nthat of correcting and overcoming its effects. Between the years 1833 and\r\n1838 additions were made to bank capital and bank issues, in the form of\r\nnotes designed for circulation, to an extent enormously great. The question\r\nseemed to be not how the best currency could be provided, but in what\r\nmanner the greatest amount of bank paper could be put in circulation. Thus\r\na vast amount of what was called money--since for the time being it\r\nanswered the purposes of money--was thrown upon the country, an overissue\r\nwhich was attended, as a necessary consequence, by an extravagant increase\r\nof the prices of all articles of property, the spread of a speculative\r\nmania all over the country, and has finally ended in a general indebtedness\r\non the part of States and individuals, the prostration of public and\r\nprivate credit, a depreciation in the market value of real and personal\r\nestate, and has left large districts of country almost entirely without any\r\ncirculating medium. In view of the fact that in 1830 the whole bank-note\r\ncirculation within the United States amounted to but $61,323,898, according\r\nto the Treasury statements, and that an addition had been made thereto of\r\nthe enormous sum of $88,000,000 in seven years (the circulation on the 1st\r\nof January, 1837, being stated at $149,185,890), aided by the great\r\nfacilities afforded in obtaining loans from European capitalists, who were\r\nseized with the same speculative mania which prevailed in the United\r\nStates, and the large importations of funds from abroad--the result of\r\nstock sales and loans--no one can be surprised at the apparent but\r\nunsubstantial state of prosperity which everywhere prevailed over the land;\r\nand as little cause of surprise should be felt at the present prostration\r\nof everything and the ruin which has befallen so many of our\r\nfellow-citizens in the sudden withdrawal from circulation of so large an\r\namount of bank issues since 1837--exceeding, as is believed, the amount\r\nadded to the paper currency for a similar period antecedent to 1837--it\r\nceases to be a matter of astonishment that such extensive shipwreck should\r\nhave been made of private fortunes or that difficulties should exist in\r\nmeeting their engagements on the part of the debtor States; apart from\r\nwhich, if there be taken into account the immense losses sustained in the\r\ndishonor of numerous banks, it is less a matter of surprise that insolvency\r\nshould have visited many of our fellow-citizens than that so many should\r\nhave escaped the blighting influences of the times.\r\n\r\nIn the solemn conviction of these truths and with an ardent desire to meet\r\nthe pressing necessities of the country, I felt it to be my duty to cause\r\nto be submitted to you at the commencement of your last session the plan of\r\nan exchequer, the whole power and duty of maintaining which in purity and\r\nvigor was to be exercised by the representatives of the people and the\r\nStates, and therefore virtually by the people themselves. It was proposed\r\nto place it under the control and direction of a Treasury board to consist\r\nof three commissioners, whose duty it should be to see that the law of its\r\ncreation was faithfully executed and that the great end of supplying a\r\npaper medium of exchange at all times convertible into gold and silver\r\nshould be attained. The board thus constituted was given as much permanency\r\nas could be imparted to it without endangering the proper share of\r\nresponsibility which should attach to all public agents. In order to insure\r\nall the advantages of a well-matured experience, the commissioners were to\r\nhold their offices for the respective periods of two, four, and six years,\r\nthereby securing at all times in the management of the exchequer the\r\nservices of two men of experience; and to place them in a condition to\r\nexercise perfect independence of mind and action it was provided that their\r\nremoval should only take place for actual incapacity or infidelity to the\r\ntrust, and to be followed by the President with an exposition of the causes\r\nof such removal, should it occur. It was proposed to establish subordinate\r\nboards in each of the States, under the same restrictions and limitations\r\nof the power of removal, which, with the central board, should receive,\r\nsafely keep, and disburse the public moneys. And in order to furnish a\r\nsound paper medium of exchange the exchequer should retain of the revenues\r\nof the Government a sum not to exceed $5,000,000 in specie, to be set apart\r\nas required by its operations, and to pay the public creditor at his own\r\noption either in specie or Treasury notes of denominations not less than $5\r\nnor exceeding $100, which notes should be redeemed at the several places of\r\nissue, and to be receivable at all times and everywhere in payment of\r\nGovernment dues, with a restraint upon such issue of bills that the same\r\nshould not exceed the maximum of $15,000,000. In order to guard against all\r\nthe hazards incident to fluctuations in trade, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury was invested with authority to issue $5,000,000 of Government\r\nstock, should the same at any time be regarded as necessary in order to\r\nplace beyond hazard the prompt redemption of the bills which might be\r\nthrown into circulation; thus in fact making the issue of $15,000,000 of\r\nexchequer bills rest substantially on $10,000,000, and keeping in\r\ncirculation never more than one and one-half dollars for every dollar in\r\nspecie. When to this it is added that the bills are not only everywhere\r\nreceivable in Government dues, but that the Government itself would be\r\nbound for their ultimate redemption, no rational doubt can exist that the\r\npaper which the exchequer would furnish would readily enter into general\r\ncirculation and be maintained at all times at or above par with gold and\r\nsilver, thereby realizing the great want of the age and fulfilling the\r\nwishes of the people. In order to reimburse the Government the expenses of\r\nthe plan, it was proposed to invest the exchequer with the limited\r\nauthority to deal in bills of exchange (unless prohibited by the State in\r\nwhich an agency might be situated) having only thirty days to run and\r\nresting on a fair and bona fide basis. The legislative will on this point\r\nmight be so plainly announced as to avoid all pretext for partiality or\r\nfavoritism. It was furthermore proposed to invest this Treasury agent with\r\nauthority to receive on deposit to a limited amount the specie funds of\r\nindividuals and to grant certificates therefor to be redeemed on\r\npresentation, under the idea, which is believed to be well founded, that\r\nsuch certificates would come in aid of the exchequer bills in supplying a\r\nsafe and ample paper circulation. Or if in place of the contemplated\r\ndealings in exchange the exchequer should be authorized not only to\r\nexchange its bills for actual deposits of specie, but, for specie or its\r\nequivalent, to sell drafts, charging therefor a small but reasonable\r\npremium, I can not doubt but that the benefits of the law would be speedily\r\nmanifested in the revival of the credit, trade, and business of the whole\r\ncountry. Entertaining this opinion, it becomes my duty to urge its adoption\r\nupon Congress by reference to the strongest considerations of the public\r\ninterests, with such alterations in its details as Congress may in its\r\nwisdom see fit to make.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that this proposed alteration and amendment of the laws\r\nestablishing the Treasury Department has encountered various objections,\r\nand that among others it has been proclaimed a Government bank of fearful\r\nand dangerous import. It is proposed to confer upon it no extraordinary\r\npower. It purports to do no more than pay the debts of the Government with\r\nthe redeemable paper of the Government, in which respect it accomplishes\r\nprecisely what the Treasury does daily at this time in issuing to the\r\npublic creditors the Treasury notes which under law it is authorized to\r\nissue. It has no resemblance to an ordinary bank, as it furnishes no\r\nprofits to private stockholders and lends no capital to individuals. If it\r\nbe objected to as a Government bank and the objection be available, then\r\nshould all the laws in relation to the Treasury be repealed and the\r\ncapacity of the Government to collect what is due to it or pay what it owes\r\nbe abrogated.\r\n\r\nThis is the chief purpose of the proposed exchequer, and surely if in the\r\naccomplishment of a purpose so essential it affords a sound circulating\r\nmedium to the country and facilities to trade it should be regarded as no\r\nslight recommendation of it to public consideration. Properly guarded by\r\nthe provisions of law, it can run into no dangerous evil, nor can any abuse\r\narise under it but such as the Legislature itself will be answerable for if\r\nit be tolerated, since it is but the creature of the law and is susceptible\r\nat all times of modification, amendment, or repeal at the pleasure of\r\nCongress. I know that it has been objected that the system would be liable\r\nto be abused by the Legislature, by whom alone it could be abused, in the\r\nparty conflicts of the day; that such abuse would manifest itself in a\r\nchange of the law which would authorize an excessive issue of paper for the\r\npurpose of inflating prices and winning popular favor. To that it may be\r\nanswered that the ascription of such a motive to Congress is altogether\r\ngratuitous and inadmissible. The theory of our institutions would lead us\r\nto a different conclusion. But a perfect security against a proceeding so\r\nreckless would be found to exist in the very nature of things. The\r\npolitical party which should be so blind to the true interests of the\r\ncountry as to resort to such an expedient would inevitably meet with final\r\noverthrow in the fact that the moment the paper ceased to be convertible\r\ninto specie or otherwise promptly redeemed it would become worthless, and\r\nwould in the end dishonor the Government, involve the people in ruin and\r\nsuch political party in hopeless disgrace. At the same time, such a view\r\ninvolves the utter impossibility of furnishing any currency other than that\r\nof the precious metals; for if the Government itself can not forego the\r\ntemptation of excessive paper issues what reliance can be placed in\r\ncorporations upon whom the temptations of individual aggrandizement would\r\nmost strongly operate? The people would have to blame none but themselves\r\nfor any injury that might arise from a course so reckless, since their\r\nagents would be the wrongdoers and they the passive spectators.\r\n\r\nThere can be but three kinds of public currency--first, gold and silver;\r\nsecond, the paper of State institutions; or, third, a representative of the\r\nprecious metals provided by the General Government or under its authority.\r\nThe subtreasury system rejected the last in any form, and as it was\r\nbelieved that no reliance could be placed on the issues of local\r\ninstitutions for the purposes of general circulation it necessarily and\r\nunavoidably adopted specie as the exclusive currency for its own use; and\r\nthis must ever be the case unless one of the other kinds be used. The\r\nchoice in the present state of public sentiment lies between an exclusive\r\nspecie currency on the one hand and Government issues of some kind on the\r\nother. That these issues can not be made by a chartered institution is\r\nsupposed to be conclusively settled. They must be made, then, directly by\r\nGovernment agents. For several years past they have been thus made in the\r\nform of Treasury notes, and have answered a valuable purpose. Their\r\nusefulness has been limited by their being transient and temporary; their\r\nceasing to bear interest at given periods necessarily causes their speedy\r\nreturn and thus restricts their range of circulation, and being used only\r\nin the disbursements of Government they can not reach those points where\r\nthey are most required. By rendering their use permanent, to the moderate\r\nextent already mentioned, by offering no inducement for their return and by\r\nexchanging them for coin and other values, they will constitute to a\r\ncertain extent the general currency so much needed to maintain the internal\r\ntrade of the country. And this is the exchequer plan so far as it may\r\noperate in furnishing a currency.\r\n\r\nI can not forego the occasion to urge its importance to the credit of the\r\nGovernment in a financial point of view. The great necessity of resorting\r\nto every proper and becoming expedient in order to place the Treasury on a\r\nfooting of the highest respectability is entirely obvious. The credit of\r\nthe Government may be regarded as the very soul of the Government itself--a\r\nprinciple of vitality without which all its movements are languid and all\r\nits operations embarrassed. In this spirit the Executive felt itself bound\r\nby the most imperative sense of duty to submit to Congress at its last\r\nsession the propriety of making a specific pledge of the land fund as the\r\nbasis for the negotiation of the loans authorized to be contracted. I then\r\nthought that such an application of the public domain would without doubt\r\nhave placed at the command of the Government ample funds to relieve the\r\nTreasury from the temporary embarrassments under which it labored. American\r\ncredit has suffered a considerable shock in Europe from the large\r\nindebtedness of the States and the temporary inability of some of them to\r\nmeet the interest on their debts. The utter and disastrous prostration of\r\nthe United States Bank of Pennsylvania had contributed largely to increase\r\nthe sentiment of distrust by reason of the loss and ruin sustained by the\r\nholders of its stock, a large portion of whom were foreigners and many of\r\nwhom were alike ignorant of our political organization and of our actual\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nIt was the anxious desire of the Executive that in the effort to negotiate\r\nthe loan abroad the American negotiator might be able to point the money\r\nlender to the fund mortgaged for the redemption of the principal and\r\ninterest of any loan he might contract, and thereby vindicate the\r\nGovernment from all suspicion of bad faith or inability to meet its\r\nengagements. Congress differed from the Executive in this view of the\r\nsubject. It became, nevertheless, the duty of the Executive to resort to\r\nevery expedient in its power to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter a failure in the American market a citizen of high character and\r\ntalent was sent to Europe, with no better success; and thus the mortifying\r\nspectacle has been presented of the inability of this Government to obtain\r\na loan so small as not in the whole to amount to more than one-fourth of\r\nits ordinary annual income, at a time when the Governments of Europe,\r\nalthough involved in debt and with their subjects heavily burthened with\r\ntaxation, readily obtained loans of any amount at a greatly reduced rate of\r\ninterest. It would be unprofitable to look further into this anomalous\r\nstate of things, but I can not conclude without adding that for a\r\nGovernment which has paid off its debts of two wars with the largest\r\nmaritime power of Europe, and now owing a debt which is almost next to\r\nnothing when compared with its boundless resources--a Government the\r\nstrongest in the world, because emanating from the popular will and firmly\r\nrooted in the affections of a great and free people, and whose fidelity to\r\nits engagements has never been questioned--for such a Government to have\r\ntendered to the capitalists of other countries an opportunity for a small\r\ninvestment in its stock, and yet to have failed, implies either the most\r\nunfounded distrust in its good faith or a purpose to obtain which the\r\ncourse pursued is the most fatal which could have been adopted. It has now\r\nbecome obvious to all men that the Government must look to its own means\r\nfor supplying its wants, and it is consoling to know that these means are\r\naltogether adequate for the object. The exchequer, if adopted, will greatly\r\naid in bringing about this result. Upon what I regard as a well-rounded\r\nsupposition that its bills would be readily sought for by the public\r\ncreditors and that the issue would in a short time reach the maximum of\r\n$15,000,000, it is obvious that $10,000,000 would thereby be added to the\r\navailable means of the Treasury without cost or charge. Nor can I fail to\r\nurge the great and beneficial effects which would be produced in aid of all\r\nthe active pursuits of life. Its effects upon the solvent State banks,\r\nwhile it would force into liquidation those of an opposite character\r\nthrough its weekly settlements, would be highly beneficial; and with the\r\nadvantages of a sound currency the restoration of confidence and credit\r\nwould follow with a numerous train of blessings. My convictions are most\r\nstrong that these benefits would flow from the adoption of this measure;\r\nbut if the result should be adverse there is this security in connection\r\nwith it--that the law creating it may be repealed at the pleasure of the\r\nLegislature without the slightest implication of its good faith.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress to take into consideration the propriety of\r\nreimbursing a fine imposed on General Jackson at New Orleans at the time of\r\nthe attack and defense of that city, and paid by him. Without designing any\r\nreflection on the judicial tribunal which imposed the fine, the remission\r\nat this day may be regarded as not unjust or inexpedient. The voice of the\r\ncivil authority was heard amidst the glitter of arms and obeyed by those\r\nwho held the sword, thereby giving additional luster to a memorable\r\nmilitary achievement. If the laws were offended, their majesty was fully\r\nvindicated; and although the penalty incurred and paid is worthy of little\r\nregard in a pecuniary point of view, it can hardly be doubted that it would\r\nbe gratifying to the war-worn veteran, now in retirement and in the winter\r\nof his days, to be relieved from the circumstances in which that judgment\r\nplaced him. There are cases in which public functionaries may be called on\r\nto weigh the public interest against their own personal hazards, and if the\r\ncivil law be violated from praiseworthy motives or an overruling sense of\r\npublic danger and public necessity punishment may well be restrained within\r\nthat limit which asserts and maintains the authority of the law and the\r\nsubjection of the military to the civil power. The defense of New Orleans,\r\nwhile it saved a city from the hands of the enemy, placed the name of\r\nGeneral Jackson among those of the greatest captains of the age and\r\nillustrated one of the brightest pages of our history. Now that the causes\r\nof excitement existing at the time have ceased to operate, it is believed\r\nthat the remission of this fine and whatever of gratification that\r\nremission might cause the eminent man who incurred and paid it would be in\r\naccordance with the general feeling and wishes of the American people.\r\n\r\nI have thus, fellow-citizens, acquitted myself of my duty under the\r\nConstitution by laying before you as succinctly as I have been able the\r\nstate of the Union and by inviting your attention to measures of much\r\nimportance to the country. The executive will most zealously unite its\r\nefforts with those of the legislative department in the accomplishment of\r\nall that is required to relieve the wants of a common constituency or\r\nelevate the destinies of a beloved country.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJohn Tyler\r\nDecember 1843\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nIf any people ever had cause to render up thanks to the Supreme Being for\r\nparental care and protection extended to them in all the trials and\r\ndifficulties to which they have been from time to time exposed, we\r\ncertainly are that people. From the first settlement of our forefathers on\r\nthis continent, through the dangers attendant upon the occupation of a\r\nsavage wilderness, through a long period of colonial dependence, through\r\nthe War of the Revolution, in the wisdom which led to the adoption of the\r\nexisting forms of republican government, in the hazards incident to a war\r\nsubsequently waged with one of the most powerful nations of the earth, in\r\nthe increase of our population, in the spread of the arts and sciences, and\r\nin the strength and durability conferred on political institutions\r\nemanating from the people and sustained by their will, the superintendence\r\nof an overruling Providence has been plainly visible. As preparatory,\r\ntherefore, to entering once more upon the high duties of legislation, it\r\nbecomes us humbly to acknowledge our dependence upon Him as our guide and\r\nprotector and to implore a continuance of His parental watchfulness over\r\nour beloved country. We have new cause for the expression of our gratitude\r\nin the preservation of the health of our fellow-citizens, with some partial\r\nand local exceptions, during the past season, for the abundance with which\r\nthe earth has yielded up its fruits to the labors of the husbandman, for\r\nthe renewed activity which has been imparted to commerce, for the revival\r\nof trade in all its departments, for the increased rewards attendant on the\r\nexercise of the mechanic arts, for the continued growth of our population\r\nand the rapidly reviving prosperity of the whole country. I shall be\r\npermitted to exchange congratulations with you, gentlemen of the two Houses\r\nof Congress, on these auspicious circumstances, and to assure you in\r\nadvance of my ready disposition to concur with you in the adoption of all\r\nsuch measures as shall be calculated to increase the happiness of our\r\nconstituents and to advance the glory of our common country.\r\n\r\nSince the last adjournment of Congress the Executive has relaxed no effort\r\nto render indestructible the relations of amity which so happily exist\r\nbetween the United States and other countries. The treaty lately concluded\r\nwith Great Britain has tended greatly to increase the good understanding\r\nwhich a reciprocity of interests is calculated to encourage, and it is most\r\nardently to be hoped that nothing may transpire to interrupt the relations\r\nof amity which it is so obviously the policy of both nations to cultivate.\r\nA question of much importance still remains to be adjusted between them.\r\nThe territorial limits of the two countries relation to what is commonly\r\nknown as the Oregon Territory still remain in dispute. The United States\r\nwould be at all times indisposed to aggrandize itself at the expense of any\r\nother nation; but while they would be restrained by principles of honor,\r\nwhich should govern the conduct of nations as well as that of individuals,\r\nfrom setting up a demand for territory which does not belong to them, they\r\nwould as unwillingly sent to a surrender of their rights. After the most\r\nrigid and, as far as practicable, unbiased examination of the subject, the\r\nUnited States have always contended that their rights appertain to the\r\nentire region of country lying on the Pacific and embraced within 42°\r\nand 54° 40' of north latitude. This claim being controverted by Great\r\nBritain, those who have preceded the present Executive--actuated, no doubt,\r\nby an earnest desire to adjust the matter upon terms mutually satisfactory\r\nto both countries--have caused to be submitted to the British Government\r\npropositions for settlement and final adjustment, which, however, have not\r\nproved heretofore acceptable to it. Our minister at London has, under\r\ninstructions, again brought the subject to the consideration of that\r\nGovernment, and while nothing will be done to compromise the rights or\r\nhonor of the United States, every proper expedient will be resorted to in\r\norder to bring the negotiation now in the progress of resumption to a\r\nspeedy and happy termination. In the meantime it is proper to remark that\r\nmany of our citizens are either already established in the Territory or are\r\non their way thither for the purpose of forming permanent settlements,\r\nwhile others are preparing to follow; and in view of these facts I must\r\nrepeat the recommendation contained in previous messages for the\r\nestablishment of military posts at such places on the line of travel as\r\nwill furnish security and protection to our hardy adventurers against\r\nhostile tribes of Indians inhabiting those extensive regions. Our laws\r\nshould also follow them, so modified as the circumstances of the case may\r\nseem to require. Under the influence of our free system of government new\r\nrepublics are destined to spring up at no distant day on the shores of the\r\nPacific similar in policy and in feeling to those existing on this side of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and giving a wider and more extensive spread to the\r\nprinciples of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that the cases which have from time to time arisen\r\nof the detention of American vessels by British cruisers on the coast of\r\nAfrica under pretense of being engaged in the slave trade have been placed\r\nin a fair train of adjustment. In the case of the William and Francis full\r\nsatisfaction will be allowed. In the cases of the Tygris and Seamew the\r\nBritish Government admits that satisfaction is due. In the case of the\r\nJones the sum accruing from the sale of that vessel and cargo will be paid\r\nto the owners, while I can not but flatter myself that full indemnification\r\nwill be allowed for all damages sustained by the detention of the vessel;\r\nand in the case of the Douglas Her Majesty's Government has expressed its\r\ndetermination to make indemnification. Strong hopes are therefore\r\nentertained that most, if not all, of these cases will be speedily\r\nadjusted. No new cases have arisen since the ratification of the treaty of\r\nWashington, and it is confidently anticipated that the slave trade, under\r\nthe operation of the eighth article of that treaty, will be altogether\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nThe occasional interruption experienced by our fellow-citizens engaged in\r\nthe fisheries on the neighboring coast of Nova Scotia has not failed to\r\nclaim the attention of the Executive. Representations upon this subject\r\nhave been made, but as yet no definitive answer to those representations\r\nhas been received from the British Government.\r\n\r\nTwo other subjects of comparatively minor importance, but nevertheless of\r\ntoo much consequence to be neglected, remain still to be adjusted between\r\nthe two countries. By the treaty between the United States and Great\r\nBritain of July, 1815, it is provided that no higher duties shall be levied\r\nin either country on articles imported from the other than on the same\r\narticles imported from any other place. In 1836 rough rice by act of\r\nParliament was admitted from the coast of Africa into Great Britain on the\r\npayment of a duty of 1 penny a quarter, while the same article from all\r\nother countries, including the United States, was subjected to the payment\r\nof a duty of 20 shillings a quarter. Our minister at London has from time\r\nto time brought this subject to the attention of the British Government,\r\nbut so far without success. He is instructed to renew his representations\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nSome years since a claim was preferred against the British Government on\r\nthe part of certain American merchants for the return of export duties paid\r\nby them on shipments of woolen goods to the United States after the duty on\r\nsimilar articles exported to other countries had been repealed, and\r\nconsequently in contravention of the commercial convention between the two\r\nnations securing to us equality in such cases. The principle on which the\r\nclaim rests has long since been virtually admitted by Great Britain, but\r\nobstacles to a settlement have from time to time been interposed, so that a\r\nlarge portion of the amount claimed has not yet been refunded. Our minister\r\nis now engaged in the prosecution of the claim, and I can not but persuade\r\nmyself that the British Government will no longer delay its adjustment.\r\n\r\nI am happy to be able to say that nothing has occurred to disturb in any\r\ndegree the relations of amity which exist between the United States and\r\nFrance, Austria, and Russia, as well as with the other powers of Europe,\r\nsince the adjournment of Congress. Spain has been agitated with internal\r\nconvulsions for many years, from the effects of which, it is hoped, she is\r\ndestined speedily to recover, when, under a more liberal system of\r\ncommercial policy on her part, our trade with her may again fill its old\r\nand, so far as her continental possessions are concerned, its almost\r\nforsaken channels, thereby adding to the mutual prosperity of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Germanic Association of Customs and Commerce, which since its\r\nestablishment in 1833 has been steadily growing in power and importance,\r\nand consists at this time of more than twenty German States, and embraces a\r\npopulation of 27,000,000 people united for all fire purposes of commercial\r\nintercourse with each other and with foreign states, offers to the latter\r\nthe most valuable exchanges on principles more liberal than are offered in\r\nthe fiscal system of any other European power. From its origin the\r\nimportance of the German union has never been lost sight of by the United\r\nStates. The industry, morality, and other valuable qualities of the German\r\nnation have always been well known and appreciated. On this subject I\r\ninvite the attention of Congress to the report of the Secretary of State,\r\nfrom which it will be seen that while our cotton is admitted free of duty\r\nand the duty on rice has been much reduced (which has already led to a\r\ngreatly increased consumption), a strong disposition has been recently\r\nevinced by that great body to reduce, upon certain conditions, their\r\npresent duty upon tobacco. This being the first intimation of a concession\r\non this interesting subject ever made by any European power, I can not but\r\nregard it as well calculated to remove the only impediment which has so far\r\nexisted to the most liberal commercial intercourse between us and them. In\r\nthis view our minister at Berlin, who has heretofore industriously pursued\r\nthe subject, has been instructed to enter upon the negotiation of a\r\ncommercial treaty, which, while it will open new advantages to the\r\nagricultural interests of the United States and a more free and expanded\r\nfield for commercial operations, will affect injuriously no existing\r\ninterest of the Union. Should the negotiation be crowned with success, its\r\nresults will be communicated to both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith certain dispatches received from our minister at\r\nMexico, and also a correspondence which has recently occurred between the\r\nenvoy from that Republic and the Secretary of State. It must but be\r\nregarded as not a little extraordinary that the Government of Mexico, in\r\nanticipation of a public discussion (which it has been pleased to infer\r\nfrom newspaper publications as likely to take place in Congress, relating\r\nto the annexation of Texas to the United States), should have so far\r\nanticipated the result of such discussion as to have announced its\r\ndetermination to visit any such anticipated decision by a formal\r\ndeclaration of war against the United States. If designed to prevent\r\nCongress from introducing that question as a fit subject for its calm\r\ndeliberation and final judgment, the Executive has no reason to doubt that\r\nit will entirely fail of its object. The representatives of a brave and\r\npatriotic people will suffer no apprehension of future consequences to\r\nembarrass them in the course of their proposed deliberations, nor will the\r\nexecutive department of the Government fail for any such cause to discharge\r\nits whole duty to the country.\r\n\r\nThe war which has existed for so long a time between Mexico and Texas has\r\nsince the battle of San Jacinto consisted for the most part of predatory\r\nincursions, which, while they have been attended with much of suffering to\r\nindividuals and have kept the borders of the two countries in a state of\r\nconstant alarm, have failed to approach to any definitive result. Mexico\r\nhas fitted out no formidable armament by land or by sea for the subjugation\r\nof Texas. Eight years have now elapsed since Texas declared her\r\nindependence of Mexico, and during that time she has been recognized as a\r\nsovereign power by several of the principal civilized states. Mexico,\r\nnevertheless, perseveres in her plans of reconquest, and refuses to\r\nrecognize her independence. The predatory incursions to which I have\r\nalluded have been attended in one instance with the breaking up of the\r\ncourts of justice, by the seizing upon the persons of the judges, jury, and\r\nofficers of the court and dragging them along with unarmed, and therefore\r\nnoncombatant, citizens into a cruel and oppressive bondage, thus leaving\r\ncrime to go unpunished and immorality to pass unreproved. A border warfare\r\nis evermore to be deprecated, and over such a war as has existed for so\r\nmany years between these two States humanity has had great cause to lament.\r\nNor is such a condition of things to be deplored only because of the\r\nindividual suffering attendant upon it. The effects are far more extensive.\r\nThe Creator of the Universe has given man the earth for his resting place\r\nand its fruits for his subsistence. Whatever, therefore, shall make the\r\nfirst or any part of it a scene of desolation affects injuriously his\r\nheritage and may be regarded as a general calamity. Wars may sometimes be\r\nnecessary, but all nations have a common interest in bringing them speedily\r\nto a close. The United States have an immediate interest in seeing an end\r\nput to the state of hostilities existing between Mexico and Texas. They are\r\nour neighbors, of the same continent, with whom we are not only desirous of\r\ncultivating the relations of amity, but of the most extended commercial\r\nintercourse, and to practice all the rites of a neighborhood hospitality.\r\nOur own interests are involved in the matter, since, however neutral may be\r\nour course of policy, we can not hope to escape the effects of a spirit of\r\njealousy on the part of both of the powers. Nor can this Government be\r\nindifferent to the fact that a warfare such as is waged between those two\r\nnations is calculated to weaken both powers and finally to render them--and\r\nespecially the weaker of the two--the subjects of interference on the part\r\nof stronger and more powerful nations, who, intent only on advancing their\r\nown peculiar views, may sooner or later attempt to bring about a compliance\r\nwith terms as the condition of their interposition alike derogatory to the\r\nnation granting them and detrimental to the interests of the United States.\r\nWe could not be expected quietly to permit any such interference to our\r\ndisadvantage. Considering that Texas is separated from the United States by\r\na mere geographical line; that her territory, in the opinion of many, down\r\nto a late period formed a portion of the territory of the United States;\r\nthat it is homogeneous in its population and pursuits with adjoining\r\nStates, makes contributions to the commerce of the world in the same\r\narticles with them, and that most of her inhabitants have been citizens of\r\nthe United States, speak the same language, and live under similar\r\npolitical institutions with ourselves, this Government is bound by every\r\nconsideration of interest as well as of sympathy to see that she shall be\r\nleft free to act, especially in regard to her domestic affairs, unawed by\r\nforce and unrestrained by the policy or views of other countries. In full\r\nview of all these considerations, the Executive has not hesitated to\r\nexpress to the Government of Mexico how deeply it deprecated a continuance\r\nof the war and how anxiously it desired to witness its termination. I can\r\nnot but think that it becomes the United States, as the oldest of the\r\nAmerican Republics, to hold a language to Mexico upon this subject of an\r\nunambiguous character. It is time that this war had ceased. There must be a\r\nlimit to all wars, and if the parent state after an eight years' struggle\r\nhas failed to reduce to submission a portion of its subjects standing out\r\nin revolt against it, and who have not only proclaimed themselves to be\r\nindependent, but have been recognized as such by other powers, she ought\r\nnot to expect that other nations will quietly look on, to their obvious\r\ninjury, upon a protraction of hostilities. These United States threw off\r\ntheir colonial dependence and established independent governments, and\r\nGreat Britain, after having wasted her energies in the attempt to subdue\r\nthem for a less period than Mexico has attempted to subjugate Texas, had\r\nthe wisdom and justice to acknowledge their independence, thereby\r\nrecognizing the obligation which rested on her as one of the family of\r\nnations. An example thus set by one of the proudest as well as most\r\npowerful nations of the earth it could in no way disparage Mexico to\r\nimitate. While, therefore, the Executive would deplore any collision with\r\nMexico or any disturbance of the friendly relations which exist between the\r\ntwo countries, it can not permit that Government to control its policy,\r\nwhatever it may be, toward Texas, but will treat her--as by the recognition\r\nof her independence the United States have long since declared they would\r\ndo--as entirely independent of Mexico. The high obligations of public duty\r\nmay enforce from the constituted authorities of the United States a policy\r\nwhich the course persevered in by Mexico will have mainly contributed to\r\nproduce, and the Executive in such a touting they will with confidence\r\nthrow itself upon the patriotism of the people to sustain the Government in\r\nits course of action.\r\n\r\nMeasures of an unusual character have recently been adopted by the Mexican\r\nGovernment, calculated in no small degree to affect the trade of other\r\nnations with Mexico and to operate injuriously to the United States. All\r\nforeigners, by a decree of the 23d day of September, and after six months\r\nfrom the day of its promulgation, are forbidden to carry on the business of\r\nselling by retail any goods within the confines of Mexico. Against this\r\ndecree our minister has not failed to remonstrate.\r\n\r\nThe trade heretofore carried on by our citizens with Santa Fe, in which\r\nmuch capital was already invested and which was becoming of daily\r\nincreasing importance, has suddenly been arrested by a decree of virtual\r\nprohibition on the part of the Mexican Government. Whatever may be the\r\nright of Mexico to prohibit any particular course of trade to the citizens\r\nor subjects of foreign powers, this late procedure, to say the least of it,\r\nwears a harsh and unfriendly aspect.\r\n\r\nThe installments on the claims recently settled by the convention with\r\nMexico have been punctually paid as they have fallen due, and our minister\r\nis engaged in urging the establishment of a new commission in pursuance of\r\nthe convention for the settlement of unadjusted claims.\r\n\r\nWith the other American States our relations of amity and good will have\r\nremained uninterrupted. Our minister near the Republic of New Granada has\r\nsucceeded in effecting an adjustment of the claim upon that Government for\r\nthe schooner By Chance, which had been pending for many years. The claim\r\nfor the brig Morris, which had its origin during the existence of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, and indemnification for which since the dissolution\r\nof that Republic has devolved upon its several members, will be urged with\r\nrenewed zeal.\r\n\r\nI have much pleasure in saying that the Government of Brazil has adjusted\r\nthe claim upon that Government in the case of the schooner John S. Bryan,\r\nand that sanguine hopes are entertained that the same spirit of justice\r\nwill influence its councils in arriving at an early decision upon the\r\nremaining claims, thereby removing all cause of dissension between two\r\npowers whose interests are to some extent interwoven with each other.\r\n\r\nOur minister at Chili has succeeded in inducing a recognition by that\r\nGovernment of the adjustment effected by his predecessor of the first claim\r\nin the case of the Macedonian. The first installment has been received by\r\nthe claimants in the United States.\r\n\r\nNotice of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty with Peru, which will\r\ntake place at Lima, has not yet reached this country, but is shortly\r\nexpected to be received, when the claims upon that Republic will doubtless\r\nbe liquidated and paid.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a misunderstanding between this Government and that of\r\nBuenos Ayres, occurring several years ago, this Government has remained\r\nunrepresented at that Court, while a minister from it has been constantly\r\nresident here. The causes of irritation have in a great measure passed\r\naway, and it is in contemplation, in view of important interests which have\r\ngrown up in that country, at some early period during the present session\r\nof Congress, with the concurrence of the Senate, to restore diplomatic\r\nrelations between the two countries.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of an act of Congress of the last session a minister\r\nwas dispatched from the United States to China in August of the present\r\nyear, who, from the latest accounts we have from him, was at Suez, in\r\nEgypt, on the 25th of September last, on his route to China.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Indian tribes residing within our jurisdictional limits,\r\nthe greatest vigilance of the Government has been exerted to preserve them\r\nat peace among themselves and to inspire them with feelings of confidence\r\nin the justice of this Government and to cultivate friendship with the\r\nborder inhabitants. This has happily succeeded to a great extent, but it is\r\na subject of regret that they suffer themselves in some instances to be\r\nimposed upon by artful and designing men and this notwithstanding all\r\nefforts of the Government to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the calendar year 1843, exclusive of\r\nloans, were little more than $ 18,000,000, and the expenditures, exclusive\r\nof the payments on the public debt, will have been about $23,000,000. By\r\nthe act of 1842 a new arrangement of the fiscal year was made, so that it\r\nshould commence on the 1st day of July in each year. The accounts and\r\nestimates for the current fiscal year will show that the loans and Treasury\r\nnotes made and issued before the close of the last Congress to meet the\r\nanticipated deficiency have not been entirely adequate. Although on the 1st\r\nof October last there was a balance in the Treasury, in consequence of the\r\nprovisions thus made, of $3,914,082.77, yet the appropriations already made\r\nby Congress will absorb that balance and leave a probable deficiency of\r\n$2,000,000 at the close of the present fiscal year. There are outstanding\r\nTreasury notes to about the amount of $4,600,000, and should they be\r\nreturned upon the Treasury during the fiscal year they will require\r\nprovision for their redemption. I do not, however, regard this as probable,\r\nsince they have obviously entered into the currency of the country and will\r\ncontinue to form a portion of it if the system now adopted be continued.\r\nThe loan of 1841, amounting to $5,672,976.88, falls due on the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, 1845, and must be provided for or postponed by a new loan; and\r\nunless the resources of revenue should be materially increased by you there\r\nwill be a probable deficiency for the service of the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1845, of upward of $4,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe delusion incident to an enormously excessive paper circulation, which\r\ngave a fictitious value to everything and stimulated adventure and\r\nspeculation to an extravagant extent, has been happily succeeded by the\r\nsubstitution of the precious metals and paper promptly redeemable in\r\nspecie; and thus false values have disappeared and a sounder condition of\r\nthings has been introduced. This transition, although intimately connected\r\nwith the prosperity of the country, has nevertheless been attended with\r\nmuch embarrassment to the Government in its financial concerns. So long as\r\nthe foreign importers could receive payment for their cargoes in a currency\r\nof greatly less value than that in Europe, but fully available here in the\r\npurchase of our agricultural productions (their profits being immeasurably\r\naugmented by the operation), the shipments were large and the revenues of\r\nthe Government became superabundant. But the change in the character of the\r\ncirculation from a nominal and apparently real value in the first stage of\r\nits existence to an obviously depreciated value in its second, so that it\r\nno longer answered the purposes of exchange or barter, and its ultimate\r\nsubstitution by a sound metallic and paper circulation combined, has been\r\nattended by diminished importations and a consequent falling off in the\r\nrevenue. This has induced Congress, from 1837, to resort to the expedient\r\nof issuing Treasury notes, and finally of funding them, in order to supply\r\ndeficiencies. I can not, however, withhold the remark that it is in no way\r\ncompatible with the dignity of the Government that a public debt should be\r\ncreated in time of peace to meet the current expenses of the Government, or\r\nthat temporary expedients should be resorted to an hour longer than it is\r\npossible to avoid them. The Executive can do no more than apply the means\r\nwhich Congress places in its hands for the support of Government, and,\r\nhappily for the good of the country and for the preservation of its\r\nliberties, it possesses no power to levy exactions on the people or to\r\nforce from them contributions to the public revenue in any form. It can\r\nonly recommend such measures as may in its opinion be called for by the\r\nwants of the public service to Congress, with whom alone rests the power to\r\n\"lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\" This duty has upon\r\nseveral occasions heretofore been performed. The present condition of\r\nthings gives flattering promise that trade and commerce are rapidly\r\nreviving, and, fortunately for the country, the sources of revenue have\r\nonly to be opened in order to prove abundant.\r\n\r\nWhile we can anticipate no considerable increase in the proceeds of the\r\nsales of the public lands, for reasons perfectly obvious to all, for\r\nseveral years to come, yet the public lands can not otherwise than be\r\nregarded as the foundation of the public credit. With so large a body of\r\nthe most fertile lands in the world under the control and at the disposal\r\nof this Government, no one can reasonably doubt the entire ability to meet\r\nits engagements under every emergency. In seasons of trial and difficulty\r\nsimilar to those through which we are passing the capitalist makes his\r\ninvestments in the Government cut stocks with the most assured confidence\r\nof ultimate reimbursement; and whatever may be said of a period of great\r\nfinancial prosperity, such as existed for some years after 1833, I should\r\nregard it as suicidal in a season of financial embarrassment either to\r\nalienate the lands themselves or the proceeds arising from their sales. The\r\nfirst and paramount duty of those to whom may be intrusted the\r\nadministration of public affairs is to guard the public credit. In\r\nreestablishing the credit of this central Government the readiest and most\r\nobvious mode is taken to restore the credit of the States. The extremities\r\ncan only be made sound by producing a healthy action in the central\r\nGovernment, and the history of the present day fully establishes the fact\r\nthat an increase in the value of the stocks of this Government will in a\r\ngreat majority of instances be attended by an increase in the value of the\r\nstocks of the States. It should therefore be a matter of general\r\ncongratulation that amidst all the embarrassments arising from surrounding\r\ncircumstances the credit of the Government should have been so fully\r\nrestored that it has been enabled to effect a loan of $7,000,000 to redeem\r\nthat amount of Treasury notes on terms more favorable than any that have\r\nbeen offered for many years. And the 6 per cent stock which was created in\r\n1842 has advanced in the hands of the holders nearly 20 per cent above its\r\npar value. The confidence of the people in the integrity of their\r\nGovernment has thus been signally manifested. These opinions relative to\r\nthe public lands do not in any manner conflict with the observance of the\r\nmost liberal policy toward those of our fellow-citizens who press forward\r\ninto the wilderness and are the pioneers in the work of its reclamation. In\r\nsecuring to all such their rights of preemption the Government performs but\r\nan act of retributive justice for sufferings encountered and hardships\r\nendured, and finds ample remuneration in the comforts which its policy\r\ninsures and the happiness which it imparts.\r\n\r\nShould a revision of the tariff with a view to revenue become necessary in\r\nthe estimation of Congress, I doubt not you will approach the subject with\r\na just and enlightened regard to the interests of the whole Union. The\r\nprinciples and views which I have heretofore had occasion to submit remain\r\nunchanged. It can, however, never be too often repeated that the prominent\r\ninterest of every important pursuit of life requires for success permanency\r\nand stability in legislation. These can only be attained by adopting as the\r\nbasis of action moderation in all things, which is as indispensably\r\nnecessary to secure the harmonious action of the political as of the animal\r\nsystem. In our political organization no one section of the country should\r\ndesire to have its supposed interests advanced at the sacrifice of all\r\nothers, but union, being the great interest, equally precious to all,\r\nshould be fostered and sustained by mutual concessions and the cultivation\r\nof that spirit of compromise from which the Constitution itself proceeded.\r\n\r\nYou will be informed by the report from the Treasury Department of the\r\nmeasures taken under the act of the last session authorizing the reissue of\r\nTreasury notes in lieu of those then outstanding. The system adopted in\r\npursuance of existing laws seems well calculated to save the country a\r\nlarge amount of interest, while it affords conveniences and obviates\r\ndangers and expense in the transmission of funds to disbursing agents. I\r\nrefer you also to that report for the means proposed by the Secretary to\r\nincrease the revenue, and particularly to that portion of it which relates\r\nto the subject of the warehousing system, which I earnestly urged upon\r\nCongress at its last session and as to the importance of which my opinion\r\nhas undergone no change.\r\n\r\nIn view of the disordered condition of the currency at the time and the\r\nhigh rates of exchange between different parts of the country, I felt it to\r\nbe incumbent on me to present to the consideration of your predecessors a\r\nproposition conflicting in no degree with the Constitution or with the\r\nrights of the States and having the sanction (not in detail, but in\r\nprinciple) of some of the eminent men who have preceded me in the Executive\r\noffice. That proposition contemplated the issuing of Treasury notes of\r\ndenominations of not less than $5 nor more than $100, to be employed in the\r\npayment of the obligations of the Government in lieu of gold and silver at\r\nthe option of the public creditor, and to an amount not exceeding\r\n$15,000,000. It was proposed to make them receivable everywhere and to\r\nestablish at various points depositories of gold and silver to be held in\r\ntrust for the redemption of such notes, so as to insure their\r\nconvertibility into specie. No doubt was entertained that such notes would\r\nhave maintained a par value with gold and silver, thus furnishing a paper\r\ncurrency of equal value over the Union, thereby meeting the just\r\nexpectations of the people and fulfilling the duties of a parental\r\ngovernment. Whether the depositories should be permitted to sell or\r\npurchase bills under very limited restrictions, together with all its other\r\ndetails, was submitted to the wisdom of Congress and was regarded as of\r\nsecondary importance. I thought then and think now that such an arrangement\r\nwould have been attended with the happiest results. The whole matter of the\r\ncurrency would have been placed where by the Constitution it was designed\r\nto be placed--under the immediate supervision and control of Congress. The\r\naction of the Government would have been independent of all corporations,\r\nand the same eye which rests unceasingly on the specie currency and guards\r\nit against adulteration would also have rested on the paper currency, to\r\ncontrol and regulate its issues and protect it against depreciation. The\r\nsame reasons which would forbid Congress from parting with the power over\r\nthe coinage would seem to operate with nearly equal force hi regard to any\r\nsubstitution for the precious metals in the form of a circulating medium.\r\nPaper when substituted for specie constitutes a standard of value by which\r\nthe operations of society are regulated, and whatsoever causes its\r\ndepreciation affects society to an extent nearly, if not quite, equal to\r\nthe adulteration of the coin. Nor can I withhold the remark that its\r\nadvantages contrasted with a bank of the United States, apart from the fact\r\nthat a bank was esteemed as obnoxious to the public sentiment as well on\r\nthe score of expediency as of constitutionality, appeared to me to be\r\nstriking and obvious. The relief which a bank would afford by an issue of\r\n$15,000,000 of its notes, judging from the experience of the late United\r\nStates Bank, would not have occurred in less than fifteen years, whereas\r\nunder the proposed arrangement the relief arising from the issue of\r\n$15,000,000 of Treasury notes would have been consummated in one year, thus\r\nfurnishing in one-fifteenth part of the time in which a bank could have\r\naccomplished it a paper medium of exchange equal in amount to the real\r\nwants of the country at par value with gold and silver. The saving to the\r\nGovernment would have been equal to all the interest which it has had to\r\npay on Treasury notes of previous as well as subsequent issues, thereby\r\nrelieving the Government and at the same time affording relief to the\r\npeople. Under all the responsibilities attached to the station which I\r\noccupy, and in redemption of a pledge given to the last Congress at the\r\nclose of its first session, I submitted the suggestion to its consideration\r\nat two consecutive sessions. The recommendation, however, met with no favor\r\nat its hands. While I am free to admit that the necessities of the times\r\nhave since become greatly ameliorated and that there is good reason to hope\r\nthat the country is safely and rapidly emerging from the difficulties and\r\nembarrassments which everywhere surrounded it in 1841, yet I can not but\r\nthink that its restoration to a sound and healthy condition would be\r\ngreatly expedited by a resort to the expedient in a modified form.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury now rest upon the act of 1789 and the\r\nresolution of 1816, and those laws have been so administered as to produce\r\nas great a quantum of good to the country as their provisions are capable\r\nof yielding. If there had been any distinct expression of opinion going to\r\nshow that public sentiment is averse to the plan, either as heretofore\r\nrecommended to Congress or in a modified form, while my own opinion in\r\nregard to it would remain unchanged I should be very far from again\r\npresenting it to your consideration. The Government has originated with the\r\nStates and the people, for their own benefit and advantage, and it would be\r\nsubversive of the foundation principles of the political edifice which they\r\nhave reared to persevere in a measure which in their mature judgments they\r\nhad either repudiated or condemned. The will of our constituents clearly\r\nexpressed should be regarded as the light to guide our footsteps, the true\r\ndifference between a monarchical or aristocratical government and a\r\nrepublic being that in the first the will of the few prevails over the will\r\nof the many, while in the last the will of the many should be alone\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War will bring you acquainted with the\r\ncondition of that important branch of the public service. The Army may be\r\nregarded, in consequence of the small number of the rank and file in each\r\ncompany and regiment, as little more than a nucleus around which to rally\r\nthe military force of the country in case of war, and yet its services in\r\npreserving the peace of the frontiers are of a most important nature. In\r\nall cases of emergency the reliance of the country is properly placed in\r\nthe militia of the several States, and it may well deserve the\r\nconsideration of Congress whether a new and more perfect organization might\r\nnot be introduced, looking mainly to the volunteer companies of the Union\r\nfor the present and of easy application to the great body of the militia in\r\ntime of war.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the War Department have been considerably reduced in\r\nthe last two years. Contingencies, however, may arise which would call for\r\nthe filling up of the regiments with a full complement of men and make it\r\nvery desirable to remount the corps of dragoons, which by an act of the\r\nlast Congress was directed to be dissolved.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary for information in\r\nrelation to the Navy of the United States. While every effort has been and\r\nwill continue to be made to retrench all superfluities and lop off all\r\nexcrescences which from time to time may have grown up, yet it has not been\r\nregarded as wise or prudent to recommend any material change in the annual\r\nappropriations. The interests which are involved are of too important a\r\ncharacter to lead to the recommendation of any other than a liberal policy.\r\nAdequate appropriations ought to be made to enable the Executive to fit out\r\nall the ships that are now in a course of building or that require repairs\r\nfor active service in the shortest possible time should any emergency arise\r\nwhich may require it. An efficient navy, while it is the cheapest means of\r\npublic defense, enlists in its support the feelings of pride and confidence\r\nwhich brilliant deeds and heroic valor have heretofore served to strengthen\r\nand confirm.\r\n\r\nI refer you particularly to that part of the Secretary's report which has\r\nreference to recent experiments in the application of steam and in the\r\nconstruction of our war steamers, made under the superintendence of\r\ndistinguished officers of the Navy. In addition to other manifest\r\nimprovements in the construction of the steam engine and application of the\r\nmotive power which has rendered them more appropriate to the uses of ships\r\nof war, one of those officers has brought into use a power which makes the\r\nsteamship most formidable either for attack or defense. I can not too\r\nstrongly recommend this subject to your consideration and do not hesitate\r\nto express my entire conviction of its great importance.\r\n\r\nI call your particular attention also to that portion of the Secretary's\r\nreport which has reference to the act of the late session of Congress which\r\nprohibited the transfer of any balance of appropriation from other heads of\r\nappropriation to that for building, equipment, and repair. The repeal of\r\nthat prohibition will enable the Department to give renewed employment to a\r\nlarge class of workmen who have been necessarily discharged in consequence\r\nof the want of means to pay them--a circumstance attended, especially at\r\nthis season of the year, with much privation and suffering.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pain to announce to you the loss of the steamship the\r\nMissouri by fire in the Bay of Gibraltar, where she had stopped to renew\r\nher supplies of coal on her voyage to Alexandria, with Mr. Cushing, the\r\nAmerican minister to China, on board. There is ground for high commendation\r\nof the officers and men for the coolness and intrepidity and perfect\r\nsubmission to discipline evinced under the most trying circumstances.\r\nSurrounded by a raging fire, which the utmost exertions could not subdue,\r\nand which threatened momentarily the explosion of her well-supplied\r\nmagazines, the officers exhibited no signs of fear and the men obeyed every\r\norder with alacrity. Nor was she abandoned until the last gleam of hope of\r\nsaving her had expired. It is well worthy of your consideration whether the\r\nlosses sustained by the officers and crew in this unfortunate affair should\r\nnot be reimbursed to them.\r\n\r\nI can not take leave of this painful subject without adverting to the aid\r\nrendered upon the occasion by the British authorities at Gibraltar and the\r\ncommander, officers, and crew of the British ship of the line the Malabar,\r\nwhich was lying at the time in the bay. Everything that generosity or\r\nhumanity could dictate was promptly performed. It is by such acts of good\r\nwill by one to another of the family of nations that fraternal feelings are\r\nnourished and the blessings of permanent peace secured.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General will bring you acquainted with the\r\noperations of that Department during the past year, and will suggest to you\r\nsuch modifications of the existing laws as in your opinion the exigencies\r\nof the public service may require. The change which the country has\r\nundergone of late years in the mode of travel and transportation has\r\nafforded so many facilities for the transmission of mail matter out of the\r\nregular mail as to require the greatest vigilance and circumspection in\r\norder to enable the officer at the head of the Department to restrain the\r\nexpenditures within the income. There is also too much reason to fear that\r\nthe franking privilege has run into great abuse. The Department,\r\nnevertheless, has been conducted with the greatest vigor, and has attained\r\nat the least possible expense all the useful objects for which it was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIn regard to all the Departments, I am quite happy in the belief that\r\nnothing has been left undone which was called for by a true spirit of\r\neconomy or by a system of accountability rigidly enforced. This is in some\r\ndegree apparent from the fact that the Government has sustained no loss by\r\nthe default of any of its agents. In the complex, but at the same time\r\nbeautiful, machinery of our system of government, it is not a matter of\r\nsurprise that some remote agency may have failed for an instant to fulfill\r\nits desired office; but I feel confident in the assertion that nothing has\r\noccurred to interrupt the harmonious action of the Government itself, and\r\nthat, while the laws have been executed with efficiency and vigor, the\r\nrights neither of States nor individuals have been trampled on or\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the country has been steadily advancing in all that\r\ncontributes to national greatness. The tide of population continues\r\nunbrokenly to flow into the new States and Territories, where a refuge is\r\nfound not only for our native-born fellow-citizens, but for emigrants from\r\nall parts of the civilized world, who come among us to partake of the\r\nblessings of our free institutions and to aid by their labor to swell the\r\ncurrent of our wealth and power.\r\n\r\nIt is due to every consideration of public policy that the lakes and rivers\r\nof the West should receive all such attention at the hands of Congress as\r\nthe Constitution will enable it to bestow. Works in favorable and proper\r\nsituations on the Lakes would be found to be as indispensably necessary, in\r\ncase of war, to carry on safe and successful naval operations as\r\nfortifications on the Atlantic seaboard. The appropriation made by the last\r\nCongress for the improvement of the navigation of the Mississippi River has\r\nbeen diligently and efficiently applied.\r\n\r\nI can not close this communication, gentlemen, without recommending to your\r\nmost favorable consideration the interests of this District. Appointed by\r\nthe Constitution its exclusive legislators, and forming in this particular\r\nthe only anomaly in our system of government--of the legislative body being\r\nelected by others than those for whose advantage they are to legislate--you\r\nwill feel a superadded obligation to look well into their condition and to\r\nleave no cause for complaint or regret. The seat of Government of our\r\nassociated republics can not but be regarded as worthy of your parental\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nIn connection with its other interests, as well as those of the whole\r\ncountry, I recommend that at your present session you adopt such measures\r\nin order to carry into effect the Smithsonian bequest as in your judgment\r\nwill be best calculated to consummate the liberal intent of the testator.\r\n\r\nWhen, under a dispensation of Divine Providence, I succeeded to the\r\npresidential office, the state of public affairs was embarrassing and\r\ncritical. To add to the irritation consequent upon a long-standing\r\ncontroversy with one of the most powerful nations of modern times,\r\ninvolving not only questions of boundary (which under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances are always embarrassing), but at the same time important and\r\nhigh principles of maritime law, border controversies between the citizens\r\nand subjects of the two countries had engendered a state of feeling and of\r\nconduct which threatened the most calamitous consequences. The hazards\r\nincident to this state of things were greatly heightened by the arrest and\r\nimprisonment of a subject of Great Britain, who, acting (as it was alleged)\r\nas a part of a military force, had aided in the commission of an act\r\nviolative of the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and\r\ninvolving the murder of a citizen, of the State of New York. A large amount\r\nof claims against the Government of Mexico remained unadjusted and a war of\r\nseveral years' continuance with the savage tribes of Florida still\r\nprevailed, attended with the desolation of a large portion of that\r\nbeautiful Territory and with the sacrifice of many valuable lives. To\r\nincrease the embarrassments of the Government, individual and State credit\r\nhad been nearly stricken down and confidence in the General Government was\r\nso much impaired that-loans of a small amount could only be negotiated at a\r\nconsiderable sacrifice. As a necessary consequence of the blight which had\r\nfallen on commerce and mechanical industry, the ships of the one were\r\nthrown out of employment and the operations of the other had been greatly\r\ndiminished. Owing to the condition of the currency, exchanges between\r\ndifferent parts of the country had become ruinously high and trade had to\r\ndepend on a depreciated paper currency in conducting its transactions. I\r\nshall be permitted to congratulate the country that under an overruling\r\nProvidence peace was preserved without a sacrifice of the national honor;\r\nthe war in Florida was brought to a speedy termination; a large portion of\r\nthe claims on Mexico have been fully adjudicated and are in a course of\r\npayment, while justice has been rendered to us in other matters by other\r\nnations; confidence between man and man is in a great measure restored and\r\nthe credit of this Government fully and perfectly reestablished; commerce\r\nis becoming more and more extended in its operations and manufacturing and\r\nmechanical industry once more reap the rewards of skill and labor honestly\r\napplied; the operations of trade rest on a sound currency and the rates of\r\nexchange are reduced to their lowest amount.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of things I have felt it to be my duty to bring to your\r\nfavorable consideration matters of great interest in their present and\r\nultimate results; and the only desire which I feel in connection with the\r\nfuture is and will continue to be to leave the country prosperous and its\r\ninstitutions unimpaired.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJohn Tyler\r\nDecember 3, 1844\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nWe have continued cause for expressing our gratitude to the Supreme Ruler\r\nof the Universe for the benefits and blessings which our country, under His\r\nkind providence, has enjoyed during the past year. Notwithstanding the\r\nexciting scenes through which we have passed, nothing has occurred to\r\ndisturb the general peace or to derange the harmony of our political\r\nsystem. The great moral spectacle has been exhibited of a nation\r\napproximating in number to 20,000,000 people having performed the high and\r\nimportant function of electing their Chief Magistrate for the term of four\r\nyears without the commission of any acts of violence or the manifestation\r\nof a spirit of insubordination to the laws. The great and inestimable right\r\nof suffrage has been exercised by all who were invested with it under the\r\nlaws of the different States in a spirit dictated alone by a desire, in the\r\nselection of the agent, to advance the interests of the country and to\r\nplace beyond jeopardy the institutions under which it is our happiness to\r\nlive. That the deepest interest has been manifested by all our countrymen\r\nin the result of the election is not less true than highly creditable to\r\nthem. Vast multitudes have assembled from time to time at various places\r\nfor the purpose of canvassing the merits and pretensions of those who were\r\npresented for their suffrages, but no armed soldiery has been necessary to\r\nrestrain within proper limits the popular zeal or to prevent violent\r\noutbreaks. A principle much more controlling was found in the love of order\r\nand obedience to the laws, which, with mere individual exceptions,\r\neverywhere possesses the American mind, and controls with an influence far\r\nmore powerful than hosts of armed men. We can not dwell upon this picture\r\nwithout recognizing in it that deep and devoted attachment on the part of\r\nthe people to the institutions under which we live which proclaims their\r\nperpetuity. The great objection which has always prevailed against the\r\nelection by the people of their chief executive officer has been the\r\napprehension of tumults and disorders which might involve in ruin the\r\nentire Government. A security against this is found not only in the fact\r\nbefore alluded to, trot in the additional fact that we live under a\r\nConfederacy embracing already twenty-six States, no one of which has power\r\nto control the election. The popular vote in each State is taken at the\r\ntime appointed by the laws, and such vote is announced by the electoral\r\ncollege without reference to the decision of other States. The right of\r\nsuffrage and the mode of conducting the election are regulated by the laws\r\nof each State, and the election is distinctly federative in all its\r\nprominent features. Thus it is that, unlike what might be the results under\r\na consolidated system, riotous proceedings, should they prevail, could only\r\naffect the elections in single States without disturbing to any dangerous\r\nextent the tranquillity of others. The great experiment of a political\r\nconfederation each member of which is supreme as to all matters\r\nappertaining to its local interests and its internal peace and happiness,\r\nwhile by a voluntary compact with others it confides to the united power of\r\nall the protection of its citizens in matters not domestic has been so far\r\ncrowned with complete success. The world has witnessed its rapid growth in\r\nwealth and population, and under the guide and direction of a\r\nsuperintending Providence the developments of the past may be regarded but\r\nas the shadowing forth of the mighty future. In the bright prospects of\r\nthat future we shall find, as patriots and philanthropists, the highest\r\ninducements to cultivate and cherish a love of union and to frown down\r\nevery measure or effort which may be made to alienate the States or the\r\npeople of the States in sentiment and feeling from each other. A rigid and\r\nclose adherence to the terms of our political compact and, above all, a\r\nsacred observance of the guaranties of the Constitution will preserve union\r\non a foundation which can not be shaken, while personal liberty is placed\r\nbeyond hazard or jeopardy. The guaranty of religious freedom, of the\r\nfreedom of the press, of the liberty of speech, of the trial by jury, of\r\nthe habeas corpus, and of the domestic institutions of each of the States,\r\nleaving the private citizen in the full exercise of the high and ennobling\r\nattributes of his nature and to each State the privilege (which can only be\r\njudiciously exerted by itself) of consulting the means best calculated to\r\nadvance its own happiness--these are the great and important guaranties of\r\nthe Constitution which the lovers of liberty must cherish and the advocates\r\nof union must ever cultivate. Preserving these and avoiding all\r\ninterpolations by forced construction under the guise of an imagined\r\nexpediency upon the Constitution, the influence of our political system is\r\ndestined to be as actively and as beneficially felt on the distant shores\r\nof the Pacific as it is now on those of the Atlantic Ocean. The only\r\nformidable impediments in the way of its successful expansion (time and\r\nspace) are so far in the progress of modification by the improvements of\r\nthe age as to render no longer speculative the ability of representatives\r\nfrom that remote region to come up to the Capitol, so that their\r\nconstituents shall participate in all the benefits of Federal legislation.\r\nThus it is that in the progress of time the inestimable principles of civil\r\nliberty will be enjoyed by millions yet unborn and the great benefits of\r\nour system of government be extended to now distant and uninhabited\r\nregions. In view of the vast wilderness yet to be reclaimed, we may well\r\ninvite the lover of freedom of every land to take up his abode among us and\r\nassist us in the great work of advancing the standard of civilization and\r\ngiving a wider spread to the arts and refinements of cultivated life. Our\r\nprayers should evermore be offered up to the Father of the Universe for His\r\nwisdom to direct us in the path of our duty so as to enable us to\r\nconsummate these high purposes.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest objections which has been urged against confederacies\r\nby writers on government is the liability of the members to be tampered\r\nwith by foreign governments or the people of foreign states, either in\r\ntheir local affairs or in such as affected the peace of others or\r\nendangered the safety of the whole confederacy. We can not hope to be\r\nentirely exempt from such attempts on our peace and safety. The United\r\nStates are becoming too important in population and resources not to\r\nattract the observation of other nations. It therefore may in the progress\r\nof time occur that opinions entirely abstract in the States which they may\r\nprevail and in no degree affecting their domestic institutions may be\r\nartfully but secretly encouraged with a view to undermine the Union. Such\r\nopinions may become the foundation of political parties, until at last the\r\nconflict of opinion, producing an alienation of friendly feeling among the\r\npeople of the different States, may involve in general destruction the\r\nhappy institutions under which we live. It should ever be borne in mind\r\nthat what is true in regard to individuals is equally so in regard to\r\nstates. An interference of one in the affairs of another is the fruitful\r\ncause of family dissensions and neighborhood disputes, and the same cause\r\naffects the peace, happiness, and prosperity of states. It may be most\r\ndevoutly hoped that the good sense of the American people will ever be\r\nready to repel all such attempts should they ever be made.\r\n\r\nThere has been no material change in our foreign relations since my last\r\nannual message to Congress. With all the powers of Europe we continue on\r\nthe most friendly terms. Indeed, it affords me much satisfaction to state\r\nthat at no former period has the peace of that enlightened and important\r\nquarter of the globe ever been, apparently, more firmly established. The\r\nconviction that peace is the true policy of nations would seem to be\r\ngrowing and becoming deeper amongst the enlightened everywhere, and there\r\nis no people who have a stronger interest in cherishing the sentiments and\r\nadopting the means of preserving and giving it permanence than those of the\r\nUnited States. Amongst these, the first and most effective are, no doubt,\r\nthe strict observance of justice and the honest and punctual fulfillment of\r\nall engagements. But it is not to be forgotten that in the present state of\r\nthe world it is no less necessary to be ready to enforce their observance\r\nand fulfillment in reference to ourselves than to observe and fulfill them\r\non our part in regard to others.\r\n\r\nSince the close of your last session a negotiation has been formally\r\nentered upon between the Secretary of State and Her Britannic Majesty's\r\nminister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary residing at Washington\r\nrelative to the rights of their respective nations in and over the Oregon\r\nTerritory. That negotiation is still pending. Should it during your session\r\nbe brought to a definitive conclusion, the result will be promptly\r\ncommunicated to Congress. I would, however, again call your attention to\r\nthe recommendations contained in previous messages designed to protect and\r\nfacilitate emigration to that Territory. The establishment of military\r\nposts at suitable points upon the extended line of land travel would enable\r\nour citizens to emigrate in comparative safety to the fertile regions below\r\nthe Falls of the Columbia, and make the provision of the existing\r\nconvention for the joint occupation of the territory by subjects of Great\r\nBritain and the citizens of the United States more available than\r\nheretofore to the latter. These posts would constitute places of rest for\r\nthe weary emigrant, where he would be sheltered securely against the danger\r\nof attack from the Indians and be enabled to recover from the exhaustion of\r\na long line of travel. Legislative enactments should also be made which\r\nshould spread over him the aegis of our laws, so as to afford protection to\r\nhis person and property when he shall have reached his distant home. In\r\nthis latter respect the British Government has been much more careful of\r\nthe interests of such of her people as are to be found in that country than\r\nthe United States. She has made necessary provision for their security and\r\nprotection against the acts of the viciously disposed and lawless, and her\r\nemigrant reposes in safety under the panoply of her laws. Whatever may be\r\nthe result of the pending negotiation, such measures are necessary. It will\r\nafford me the greatest pleasure to witness a happy and favorable\r\ntermination to the existing negotiation upon terms compatible with the\r\npublic honor, and the best efforts of the Government will continue to be\r\ndirected to this end.\r\n\r\nIt would have given me the highest gratification in this my last annual\r\ncommunication to Congress to have been able to announce to you the complete\r\nand entire settlement and adjustment of other matters in difference between\r\nthe United States and the Government of Her Britannic Majesty, which were\r\nadverted to in a previous message. It is so obviously the interest of both\r\ncountries, in respect to the large and valuable commerce which exists\r\nbetween them, that all causes of complaint, however inconsiderable, should\r\nbe with the greatest promptitude removed that it must be regarded as cause\r\nof regret that any unnecessary delays should be permitted to intervene. It\r\nis true that in a pecuniary point of view the matters alluded to are\r\naltogether insignificant in amount when compared with the ample resources\r\nof that great nation, but they nevertheless, more particularly that limited\r\nclass which arise under seizures and detentions of American ships on the\r\ncoast of Africa upon the mistaken supposition indulged in at the time the\r\nwrong was committed of their being engaged in the slave trade, deeply\r\naffect the sensibilities of this Government and people. Great Britain,\r\nhaving recognized her responsibility to repair all such wrongs by her\r\naction in other cases, leaves nothing to be regretted upon the subject as\r\nto all cases arising prior to the treaty of Washington than the delay in\r\nmaking suitable reparation in such of them as fall plainly within the\r\nprinciple of others which she has long since adjusted. The injury inflicted\r\nby delays in the settlement of these claims falls with severity upon the\r\nindividual claimants and makes a strong appeal to her magnanimity and sense\r\nof justice for a speedy settlement. Other matters arising out of the\r\nconstruction of existing treaties also remain unadjusted, and will continue\r\nto be urged upon her attention.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the joint commission appointed by the two Governments to run\r\nthe dividing line established by the treaty of Washington were,\r\nunfortunately, much delayed in the commencement of the season by the\r\nfailure of Congress at its last session to make a timely appropriation of\r\nfunds to meet the expenses of the American party, and by other causes. The\r\nUnited States commissioner, however, expresses his expectation that by\r\nincreased diligence and energy the party will be able to make up for lost\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe continue to receive assurances of the most friendly feelings on the part\r\nof all the other European powers, with each and all of whom it is so\r\nobviously our interest to cultivate the most amicable relations; nor can I\r\nanticipate the occurrence of any event which would be likely in any degree\r\nto disturb those relations. Russia, the great northern power, under the\r\njudicious sway of her Emperor, is constantly advancing in the road of\r\nscience and improvement, while France, guided by the counsels of her wise\r\nSovereign, pursues a course calculated to consolidate the general peace.\r\nSpain has obtained a breathing spell of some duration from the internal\r\nconvulsions which have through so many years marred her prosperity, while\r\nAustria, the Netherlands, Prussia, Belgium, and the other powers of Europe\r\nreap a rich harvest of blessings from the prevailing peace.\r\n\r\nI informed the two Houses of Congress in my message of December last that\r\ninstructions had been given to Mr. Wheaton, our minister at Berlin, to\r\nnegotiate a treaty with the Germanic States composing the Zollverein if it\r\ncould be done, stipulating, as far as it was practicable to accomplish it,\r\nfor a reduction of the heavy and onerous duties levied on our tobacco and\r\nother leading articles of agricultural production, and yielding in return\r\non our part a reduction of duties on such articles the product of their\r\nindustry as should not come into competition, or but a limited one, with\r\narticles the product of our manufacturing industry. The Executive in giving\r\nsuch instructions considered itself as acting in strict conformity with the\r\nwishes of Congress as made known through several measures which it had\r\nadopted, all directed to the accomplishment of this important result. The\r\ntreaty was therefore negotiated, by which essential reductions were secured\r\nin the duties levied by the Zollverein on tobacco, rice, and lard,\r\naccompanied by a stipulation for the admission of raw cotton free of duty;\r\nin exchange for which highly important concessions a reduction of duties\r\nimposed by the laws of the United States on a variety of articles, most of\r\nwhich were admitted free of all duty under the act of Congress commonly\r\nknown as the compromise law, and but few of which were produced in the\r\nUnited States, was stipulated for on our part. This treaty was communicated\r\nto the Senate at an early day of its last session, but not acted upon until\r\nnear its close, when, for the want (as I am bound to presume) of full time\r\nto consider it, it was laid upon the table. This procedure had the effect\r\nof virtually rejecting it, in consequence of a stipulation contained in the\r\ntreaty that its ratifications should be exchanged on or before a day which\r\nhas already passed. The Executive, acting upon the fair inference that the\r\nSenate did not intend its absolute rejection, gave instructions to our\r\nminister at Berlin to reopen the negotiation so far as to obtain an\r\nextension of time for the exchange of ratifications. I regret, however, to\r\nsay that his efforts in this respect have been unsuccessful. I am\r\nnevertheless not without hope that the great advantages which were intended\r\nto be secured by the treaty may yet be realized.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that Belgium has, by an \"arrete royale\" issued in\r\nJuly last, assimilated the flag of the United States to her own, so far as\r\nthe direct trade between the two countries is concerned. This measure will\r\nprove of great service to our shipping interest, the trade having\r\nheretofore been carried on chiefly in foreign bottoms. I flatter myself\r\nthat she will speedily resort to a modification of her system relating to\r\nthe tobacco trade, which would decidedly benefit the agriculture of the\r\nUnited States and operate to the mutual advantage of both countries.\r\n\r\nNo definitive intelligence has yet been received from our minister of the\r\nconclusion of a treaty with the Chinese Empire, but enough is known to\r\ninduce the strongest hopes that the mission will be crowned with success.\r\n\r\nWith Brazil our relations continue on the most friendly footing. The\r\ncommercial intercourse between that growing Empire and the United States is\r\nbecoming daily of greater importance to both, and it is to the interest of\r\nboth that the firmest relations of amity and good will should continue to\r\nbe cultivated between them.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of New Granada still withholds, notwithstanding the most\r\npersevering efforts have been employed by our charge d'affaires, Mr.\r\nBlackford, to produce a different result, indemnity in the case of the brig\r\nMorris; and the Congress of Venezuela, although an arrangement has been\r\neffected between our minister and the minister of foreign affairs of that\r\nGovernment for the payment of $18,000 in discharge of its liabilities in\r\nthe same case, has altogether neglected to make provision for its payment.\r\nIt is to be hoped that a sense of justice will soon induce a settlement of\r\nthese claims.\r\n\r\nOur late minister to Chili, Mr. Pendleton, has returned to the United\r\nStates without having effected an adjustment in the second claim of the\r\nMacedonian, which is delayed on grounds altogether frivolous and untenable.\r\nMr. Pendleton's successor has been directed to urge the claim in the\r\nstrongest terms, and, in the event of a failure to obtain a prompt\r\nadjustment, to report the fact to the Executive at as early a day as\r\npossible, so that the whole matter may be communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nAt your last session I submitted to the attention of Congress the\r\nconvention with the Republic of Peru of the 17th March, 1841, providing for\r\nthe adjustment of the claims of citizens of the United States against that\r\nRepublic, but no definitive action was taken upon the subject. I again\r\ninvite to it your attention and prompt action.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I felt it to be my duty to make known to\r\nCongress, in terms both plain and emphatic, my opinion in regard to the war\r\nwhich has so long existed between Mexico and Texas which since the battle\r\nof San Jacinto has consisted altogether of predatory incursions, attended\r\nby circumstances revolting to humanity. I repeat now what I then said, that\r\nafter eight years of feeble and ineffectual efforts to reconquer Texas it\r\nwas time that the war should have ceased. The United States have a direct\r\ninterest in the question. The contiguity of the two nations to our\r\nterritory was but too well calculated to involve our peace. Unjust\r\nsuspicions were engendered in the mind of one or the other of the\r\nbelligerents against us, and as a necessary consequence American interests\r\nwere made to suffer and our peace became daily endangered; in addition to\r\nwhich it must have been obvious to all that the exhaustion produced by the\r\nwar subjected both Mexico and Texas to the interference of other powers,\r\nwhich, without the interposition of this Government, might eventuate in the\r\nmost serious injury to the United States. This Government from time to time\r\nexerted its friendly offices to bring about a termination of hostilities\r\nupon terms honorable alike to both the belligerents. Its efforts in this\r\nbehalf proved unavailing. Mexico seemed almost without an object to\r\npersevere in the war, and no other alternative was left the Executive but\r\nto take advantage of the well-known dispositions of Texas and to invite her\r\nto enter into a treaty for annexing her territory to that of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSince your last session Mexico has threatened to renew the war, and has\r\neither made or proposes to make formidable preparations for invading Texas.\r\nShe has issued decrees and proclamations, preparatory to the commencement\r\nof hostilities, full of threats revolting to humanity, and which if carried\r\ninto effect would arouse the attention of all Christendom. This new\r\ndemonstration of feeling, there is too much reason to believe, has been\r\nproduced in consequence of the negotiation of the late treaty of annexation\r\nwith Texas. The Executive, therefore, could not be indifferent to such\r\nproceedings, and it felt it to be due as well to itself as to the honor of\r\nthe country that a strong representation should be made to the Mexican\r\nGovernment upon the subject. This was accordingly done, as will be seen by\r\nthe copy of the accompanying dispatch from the Secretary of State to the\r\nUnited States envoy at Mexico. Mexico has no right to jeopard the peace of\r\nthe world by urging any longer a useless and fruitless contest. Such a\r\ncondition of things would not be tolerated on the European continent. Why\r\nshould it be on this? A war of desolation, such as is now threatened by\r\nMexico, can not be waged without involving our peace and tranquillity. It\r\nis idle to believe that such a war could be looked upon with indifference\r\nby our own citizens inhabiting adjoining States; and our neutrality would\r\nbe violated in despite of all efforts on the part of the Government to\r\nprevent it. The country is settled by emigrants from the United States\r\nunder invitations held out to them by Spain and Mexico. Those emigrants\r\nhave left behind them friends and relatives, who would not fail to\r\nsympathize with them in their difficulties, and who would be led by those\r\nsympathies to participate in their struggles, however energetic the action\r\nof the Government to prevent it. Nor would the numerous and formidable\r\nbands of Indians--the most warlike to be found in any land--which\r\noccupy the extensive regions contiguous to the States of Arkansas and\r\nMissouri, and who are in possession of large tracts of country within the\r\nlimits of Texas, be likely to remain passive. The inclinations of those\r\nnumerous tribes lead them invariably to war whenever pretexts exist.\r\n\r\nMexico had no just ground of displeasure against this Government or people\r\nfor negotiating the treaty. What interest of hers was affected by the\r\ntreaty? She was despoiled of nothing, since Texas was forever lost to her.\r\nThe independence of Texas was recognized by several of the leading powers\r\nof the earth. She was free to treat, free to adopt her own line of policy,\r\nfree to take the course which she believed was best calculated to secure\r\nher happiness.\r\n\r\nHer Government and people decided on annexation to the United States, and\r\nthe Executive saw in the acquisition of such a territory the means of\r\nadvancing their permanent happiness and glory. What principle of good\r\nfaith, then, was violated? What rule of political morals trampled under\r\nfoot? So far as Mexico herself was concerned, the measure should have been\r\nregarded by her as highly beneficial. Her inability to reconquer Texas had\r\nbeen exhibited, I repeat, by eight (now nine) years of fruitless and\r\nruinous contest. In the meantime Texas has been growing in population and\r\nresources. Emigration has flowed into her territory from all parts of the\r\nworld in a current which continues to increase in strength. Mexico requires\r\na permanent boundary between that young Republic and herself. Texas at no\r\ndistant day, if she continues separate and detached from the United States,\r\nwill inevitably seek to consolidate her strength by adding to her domain\r\nthe contiguous Provinces of Mexico. The spirit of revolt from the control\r\nof the central Government has heretofore manifested itself in some of those\r\nProvinces, and it is fair to infer that they would be inclined to take the\r\nfirst favorable opportunity to proclaim their independence and to form\r\nclose alliances with Texas. The war would thus be endless, or if cessations\r\nof hostilities should occur they would only endure for a season. The\r\ninterests of Mexico, therefore, could in nothing be better consulted than\r\nin a peace with her neighbors which would result in the establishment of a\r\npermanent boundary. Upon the ratification of the treaty the Executive was\r\nprepared to treat with her on the most liberal basis. Hence the boundaries\r\nof Texas were left undefined by the treaty. The Executive proposed to\r\nsettle these upon terms that all the world should have pronounced just and\r\nreasonable. No negotiation upon that point could have been undertaken\r\nbetween the United States and Mexico in advance of the ratification of the\r\ntreaty. We should have had no right, no power, no authority, to have\r\nconducted such a negotiation, and to have undertaken it would have been an\r\nassumption equally revolting to the pride of Mexico and Texas and\r\nsubjecting us to the charge of arrogance, while to have proposed in advance\r\nof annexation to satisfy Mexico for any contingent interest she might have\r\nin Texas would have been to have treated Texas not as an independent power,\r\nbut as a mere dependency of Mexico. This assumption could not have been\r\nacted on by the Executive without setting at defiance your own solemn\r\ndeclaration that that Republic was an independent State. Mexico had, it is\r\ntrue, threatened war against the United States in the event the treaty of\r\nannexation was ratified. The Executive could not permit itself to be\r\ninfluenced by this threat. It represented in this the spirit of our people,\r\nwho are ready to sacrifice much for peace, but nothing to intimidation. A\r\nwar under any circumstances is greatly to be deplored, and the United\r\nStates is the last nation to desire it; but if, as the condition of peace,\r\nit be required of us to forego the unquestionable right of treating with an\r\nindependent power of our own continent upon matters highly interesting to\r\nboth, and that upon a naked and unsustained pretension of claim by a third\r\npower to control the free will of the power with whom we treat, devoted as\r\nwe may be to peace and anxious to cultivate friendly relations with the\r\nwhole world, the Executive does not hesitate to say that the people of the\r\nUnited States would be ready to brave all consequences sooner than submit\r\nto such condition. But no apprehension of war was entertained by the\r\nExecutive, and I must express frankly the opinion that had the treaty been\r\nratified by the Senate it would have been followed by a prompt settlement,\r\nto the entire satisfaction of Mexico, of every matter in difference between\r\nthe two countries. Seeing, then, that new preparations for hostile invasion\r\nof Texas were about to be adopted by Mexico, and that these were brought\r\nabout because Texas had adopted the suggestions of the Executive upon the\r\nsubject of annexation, it could not passively have folded its arms and\r\npermitted a war, threatened to be accompanied by every act that could mark\r\na barbarous age, to be waged against her because she had done so.\r\n\r\nOther considerations of a controlling character influenced the course of\r\nthe Executive. The treaty which had thus been negotiated had failed to\r\nreceive the ratification of the Senate. One of the chief objections which\r\nwas urged against it was found to consist in the fact that the question of\r\nannexation had not been submitted to the ordeal of public opinion in the\r\nUnited States. However untenable such an objection was esteemed to be, in\r\nview of the unquestionable power of the Executive to negotiate the treaty\r\nand the great and lasting interests involved in the question, I felt it to\r\nbe my duty to submit the whole subject to Congress as the best expounders\r\nof popular sentiment. No definitive action having been taken on the subject\r\nby Congress, the question referred itself directly to the decision of the\r\nStates and people. The great popular election which has just terminated\r\nafforded the best opportunity of ascertaining the will of the States and\r\nthe people upon it. Pending that issue it became the imperative duty of the\r\nExecutive to inform Mexico that the question of annexation was still before\r\nthe American people, and that until their decision was pronounced any\r\nserious invasion of Texas would be regarded as an attempt to forestall\r\ntheir judgment and could not be looked upon with indifference. I am most\r\nhappy to inform you that no such invasion has taken place; and I trust that\r\nwhatever your action may be upon it Mexico will see the importance of\r\ndeciding the matter by a resort to peaceful expedients in preference to\r\nthose of arms. The decision of the people and the States on this great and\r\ninteresting subject has been decisively manifested. The question of\r\nannexation has been presented nakedly to their consideration. By the treaty\r\nitself all collateral and incidental issues which were calculated to divide\r\nand distract the public councils were carefully avoided. These were left to\r\nthe wisdom of the future to determine. It presented, I repeat, the isolated\r\nquestion of annexation, and in that form it has been submitted to the\r\nordeal of public sentiment. A controlling majority of the people and a\r\nlarge majority of the States have declared in favor of immediate\r\nannexation. Instructions have thus come up to both branches of Congress\r\nfrom their respective constituents in terms the most emphatic. It is the\r\nwill of both the people and the States that Texas shall be annexed to the\r\nUnion promptly and immediately. It may be hoped that in carrying into\r\nexecution the public will thus declared all collateral issues may be\r\navoided. Future Legislatures can best decide as to the number of States\r\nwhich should be formed out of the territory when the time has arrived for\r\ndeciding that question. So with all others. By the treaty the United States\r\nassumed the payment of the debts of Texas to an amount not exceeding\r\n$10,000,000, to be paid, with the exception of a sum falling short of\r\n$400,000, exclusively out of the proceeds of the sales of her public lands.\r\nWe could not with honor take the lands without assuming the full payment of\r\nall incumbencies upon them.\r\n\r\nNothing has occurred since your last session to induce a doubt that the\r\ndispositions of Texas remain unaltered. No intimation of an altered\r\ndetermination on the part of her Government and people has been furnished\r\nto the Executive. She still desires to throw herself under the protection\r\nof our laws and to partake of the blessings of our federative system, while\r\nevery American interest would seem to require it. The extension of our\r\ncoastwise and foreign trade to an amount almost incalculable, the\r\nenlargement of the market for our manufactures, a constantly growing market\r\nfor our agricultural productions, safety to our frontiers, and additional\r\nstrength and stability to the Union--these are the results which would\r\nrapidly develop themselves upon the consummation of the measure of\r\nannexation. In such event I will not doubt but that Mexico would find her\r\ntrue interest to consist in meeting the advances of this Government in a\r\nspirit of amity. Nor do I apprehend any serious complaint from any other\r\nquarter; no sufficient ground exists for such complaint. We should\r\ninterfere in no respect with the rights of any other nation. There can not\r\nbe gathered from the act any design on our part to do so with their\r\npossessions on this continent. We have interposed no impediments in the way\r\nof such acquisitions of territory, large and extensive as many of them are,\r\nas the leading powers of Europe have made from time to time in every part\r\nof the world. We seek no conquest made by war. No intrigue will have been\r\nresorted to or acts of diplomacy essayed to accomplish the annexation of\r\nTexas. Free and independent herself, she asks to be received into our\r\nUnion. It is a question for our own decision whether she shall be received\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nThe two Governments having already agreed through their respective organs\r\non the terms of annexation, I would recommend their adoption by Congress in\r\nthe form of a joint resolution or act to be perfected and made binding on\r\nthe two countries when adopted in like manner by the Government of Texas.\r\n\r\nIn order that the subject may be fully presented in all its bearings, the\r\ncorrespondence which has taken place in reference to it since the\r\nadjournment of Congress between the United States, Texas, and Mexico is\r\nherewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe amendments proposed by the Senate to the convention concluded between\r\nthe United States and Mexico on the 20th of November, 1843, have been\r\ntransmitted through our minister for the concurrence of the Mexican\r\nGovernment, but, although urged thereto, no action has yet been had on the\r\nsubject, nor has any answer been given which would authorize a favorable\r\nconclusion in the future.\r\n\r\nThe decree of September, 1843, in relation to the retail trade, the order\r\nfor the expulsion of foreigners, and that of a more recent date in regard\r\nto passports--all which are considered as in violation of the treaty of\r\namity and commerce between the two countries--have led to a correspondence\r\nof considerable length between the minister for foreign relations and our\r\nrepresentatives at Mexico, but without any satisfactory result. They remain\r\nstill unadjusted, and many and serious inconveniences have already resulted\r\nto our citizens in consequence of them.\r\n\r\nQuestions growing out of the act of disarming a body of Texan troops under\r\nthe command of Major Snively by an officer in the service of the United\r\nStates, acting under the orders of our Government, and the forcible entry\r\ninto the custom-house at Bryarlys Landing, on Red River, by certain\r\ncitizens of the United States, and taking away therefrom the goods seized\r\nby the collector of the customs as forfeited under the laws of Texas, have\r\nbeen adjusted so far as the powers of the Executive extend. The\r\ncorrespondence between the two Governments in reference to both subjects\r\nwill be found amongst the accompanying documents. It contains a full\r\nstatement of all the facts and circumstances, with the views taken on both\r\nsides and the principles on which the questions have been adjusted. It\r\nremains for Congress to make the necessary appropriation to carry the\r\narrangement into effect, which I respectfully recommend.\r\n\r\nThe greatly improved condition of the Treasury affords a subject for\r\ngeneral congratulation. The paralysis which had fallen on trade and\r\ncommerce, and which subjected the Government to the necessity of resorting\r\nto loans and the issue of Treasury notes to a large amount, has passed\r\naway, and after the payment of upward of $7,000,000 on account of the\r\ninterest, and in redemption of more than $5,000,000 of the public debt\r\nwhich falls due on the 1st of January next, and setting apart upward of\r\n$2,000,000 for the payment of outstanding Treasury notes and meeting an\r\ninstallment of the debts of the corporate cities of the District of\r\nColumbia, an estimated surplus of upward of $7,000,000 over and above the\r\nexisting appropriations will remain in the Treasury at the close of the\r\nfiscal year. Should the Treasury notes continue outstanding as heretofore,\r\nthat surplus will be considerably augmented. Although all interest has\r\nceased upon them and the Government has invited their return to the\r\nTreasury, yet they remain outstanding, affording great facilities to\r\ncommerce, and establishing the fact that under a well-regulated system of\r\nfinance the Government has resources within itself which render it\r\nindependent in time of need, not only of private loans, but also of bank\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining subject of regret is that the remaining stocks of the\r\nGovernment do not fall due at an earlier day, since their redemption would\r\nbe entirely within its control. As it is, it may be well worthy the\r\nconsideration of Congress whether the law establishing the sinking fund\r\n(under the operation of which the debts of the Revolution and last war with\r\nGreat Britain were to a great extent extinguished) should not, with proper\r\nmodifications, so as to prevent an accumulation of surpluses, and limited\r\nin amount to a specific sum, be reenacted. Such provision, which would\r\nauthorize the Government to go into the market for a purchase of its own\r\nstock on fair terms, would serve to maintain its credit at the highest\r\npoint and prevent to a great extent those fluctuations in the price of its\r\nsecurities which might under other circumstances affect its credit. No\r\napprehension of this sort is at this moment entertained, since the stocks\r\nof the Government, which but two years ago were offered for sale to\r\ncapitalists at home and abroad at a depreciation, and could find no\r\npurchasers, are now greatly above par in the hands of the holders; but a\r\nwise and prudent forecast admonishes us to place beyond the reach of\r\ncontingency the public credit.\r\n\r\nIt must also be a matter of unmingled gratification that under the existing\r\nfinancial system (resting upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816)\r\nthe currency of the country has attained a state of perfect soundness; and\r\nthe rates of exchange between different parts of the Union, which in 1841\r\ndenoted by their enormous amount the great depreciation and, in fact,\r\nworthlessness of the currency in most of the States, are now reduced to\r\nlittle more than the mere expense of transporting specie from place to\r\nplace and the risk incident to the operation. In a new country like that of\r\nthe United States, where so many inducements are held out for speculation,\r\nthe depositories of the surplus revenue, consisting of banks of any\r\ndescription, when it reaches any considerable amount, require the closest\r\nvigilance on the part of the Government. All banking institutions, under\r\nwhatever denomination they may pass, are governed by an almost exclusive\r\nregard to the interest of the stockholders. That interest consists in the\r\naugmentation of profits in the form of dividends, and a large surplus\r\nrevenue intrusted to their custody is but too apt to lead to excessive\r\nloans and to extravagantly large issues of paper. As a necessary\r\nconsequence prices are nominally increased and the speculative mania very\r\nsoon seizes upon the public mind. A fictitious state of prosperity for a\r\nseason exists, and, in the language of the day, money becomes plenty.\r\nContracts are entered into by individuals resting on this unsubstantial\r\nstate of things, but the delusion speedily passes away and the country is\r\noverrun with an indebtedness so weighty as to overwhelm many and to visit\r\nevery department of industry with great and ruinous embarrassment. The\r\ngreatest vigilance becomes necessary on the part of Government to guard\r\nagainst this state of things. The depositories must be given distinctly to\r\nunderstand that the favors of the Government will be altogether withdrawn,\r\nor substantially diminished, if its revenues shall be regarded as additions\r\nto their banking capital or as the foundation of an enlarged circulation.\r\n\r\nThe Government, through its revenue, has at all times an important part to\r\nperform in connection with the currency, and it greatly depends upon its\r\nvigilance and care whether the country be involved in embarrassments\r\nsimilar to those which it has had recently to encounter, or, aided by the\r\naction of the Treasury, shall be preserved in a sound and healthy\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe dangers to be guarded against are greatly augmented by too large a\r\nsurplus of revenue. When that surplus greatly exceeds in amount what shall\r\nbe required by a wise and prudent forecast to meet unforeseen\r\ncontingencies, the Legislature itself may come to be seized with a\r\ndisposition to indulge in extravagant appropriations to objects many of\r\nwhich may, and most probably would, be found to conflict with the\r\nConstitution. A fancied expediency is elevated above constitutional\r\nauthority, and a reckless and wasteful extravagance but too certainly\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe important power of taxation, which when exercised in its most\r\nrestricted form is a burthen on labor and production, is resorted to under\r\nvarious pretexts for purposes having no affinity to the motives which\r\ndictated its grant, and the extravagance of Government stimulates\r\nindividual extravagance until the spirit of a wild and ill-regulated\r\nspeculation involves one and all in its unfortunate results. In view of\r\nsuch fatal consequences, it may be laid down as an axiom rounded in moral\r\nand political truth that no greater taxes should be imposed than are\r\nnecessary for an economical administration of the Government, and that\r\nwhatever exists beyond should be reduced or modified. This doctrine does in\r\nno way conflict with the exercise of a sound discrimination in the\r\nselection of the articles to be taxed, which a due regard to the public\r\nweal would at all times suggest to the legislative mind. It leaves the\r\nrange of selection undefined; and such selection should always be made with\r\nan eye to the great interests of the country. Composed as is the Union of\r\nseparate and independent States, a patriotic Legislature will not fail in\r\nconsulting the interests of the parts to adopt such course as will be best\r\ncalculated to advance the harmony of the whole, and thus insure that\r\npermanency in the policy of the Government without which all efforts to\r\nadvance the public prosperity are vain and fruitless.\r\n\r\nThis great and vitally important task rests with Congress, and the\r\nExecutive can do no more than recommend the general principles which should\r\ngovern in its execution.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of War for an exhibition of the\r\ncondition of the Army, and recommend to you as well worthy your best\r\nconsideration many of the suggestions it contains. The Secretary in no\r\ndegree exaggerates the great importance of pressing forward without delay\r\nin the work of erecting and finishing the fortifications to which he\r\nparticularly alludes. Much has been done toward placing our cities and\r\nroadsteads in a state of security against the hazards of hostile attack\r\nwithin the last four years; but considering the new elements which have\r\nbeen of late years employed in the propelling of ships and the formidable\r\nimplements of destruction which have been brought into service, we can not\r\nbe too active or vigilant in preparing and perfecting the means of defense.\r\nI refer you also to his report for a full statement of the condition of the\r\nIndian tribes within our jurisdiction. The Executive has abated no effort\r\nin carrying into effect the well-established policy of the Government which\r\ncontemplates a removal of all the tribes residing within the limits of the\r\nseveral States beyond those limits, and it is now enabled to congratulate\r\nthe country at the prospect of an early consummation of this object. Many\r\nof the tribes have already made great progress in the arts of civilized\r\nlife, and through the operation of the schools established among them,\r\naided by the efforts of the pious men of various religious denominations\r\nwho devote themselves to the task of their improvement, we may fondly hope\r\nthat the remains of the formidable tribes which were once masters of this\r\ncountry will in their transition from the savage state to a condition of\r\nrefinement and cultivation add another bright trophy to adorn the labors of\r\na well-directed philanthropy.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy will explain to you\r\nthe situation of that branch of the service. The present organization of\r\nthe Department imparts to its operations great efficiency, but I concur\r\nfully in the propriety of a division of the Bureau of Construction,\r\nEquipment, Increase, and Repairs into two bureaus. The subjects as now\r\narranged are incongruous, and require to a certain extent information and\r\nqualifications altogether dissimilar.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the squadron on the coast of Africa have been conducted\r\nwith all due attention to the object which led to its origination, and I am\r\nhappy to say that the officers and crews have enjoyed the best possible\r\nhealth under the system adopted by the officer in command. It is believed\r\nthat the United States is the only nation which has by its laws subjected\r\nto the punishment of death as pirates those who may be engaged in the slave\r\ntrade. A similar enactment on the part of other nations would not fail to\r\nbe attended by beneficial results.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the difficulties which have existed in the way of\r\nsecuring titles for the necessary grounds, operations have not yet been\r\ncommenced toward the establishment of the navy-yard at Memphis. So soon as\r\nthe title is perfected no further delay will be permitted to intervene. It\r\nis well worthy of your consideration whether Congress should not direct the\r\nestablishment of a ropewalk in connection with the contemplated navy-yard,\r\nas a measure not only of economy, but as highly useful and necessary. The\r\nonly establishment of the sort now connected with the service is located at\r\nBoston, and the advantages of a similar establishment convenient to the\r\nhemp-growing region must be apparent to all.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary presents other matters to your consideration of\r\nan important character in connection with the service.\r\n\r\nIn referring you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General it\r\naffords me continued cause of gratification to be able to advert to the\r\nfact that the affairs of the Department for the last four years have been\r\nso conducted as from its unaided resources to meet its large expenditures.\r\nOn my coming into office a debt of nearly $500,000 existed against the\r\nDepartment, which Congress discharged by an appropriation from the\r\nTreasury. The Department on the 4th of March next will be found, under the\r\nmanagement of its present efficient head, free of debt or embarrassment,\r\nwhich could only have been done by the observance and practice of the\r\ngreatest vigilance and economy. The laws have contemplated throughout that\r\nthe Department should be self-sustained, but it may become necessary, with\r\nthe wisest regard to the public interests, to introduce amendments and\r\nalterations in the system.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong desire manifested in many quarters so to alter the tariff\r\nof letter postage as to reduce the amount of tax at present imposed. Should\r\nsuch a measure be carried into effect to the full extent desired, it can\r\nnot well be doubted but that for the first years of its operation a\r\ndiminished revenue would be collected, the supply of which would\r\nnecessarily constitute a charge upon the Treasury. Whether such a result\r\nwould be desirable it will be for Congress in its wisdom to determine. It\r\nmay in general be asserted as true that radical alterations in any system\r\nshould rather be brought about gradually than by sudden changes and by\r\npursuing this prudent policy in the reduction of letter postage the\r\nDepartment might still sustain itself through the revenue which would\r\naccrue by the increase of letters. The state and condition of the public\r\nTreasury has heretofore been such as to have precluded the recommendation\r\nof any material change. The difficulties upon this head have, however,\r\nceased, and a larger discretion is now left to the Government.\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly urge the policy of authorizing the establishment of\r\na line of steamships regularly to ply between this country and foreign\r\nports and upon our own waters for the transportation of the mail. The\r\nexample of the British Government is well worthy of imitation in this\r\nrespect. The belief is strongly entertained that the emoluments arising\r\nfrom the transportation of mail matter to foreign countries would operate\r\nof itself as an inducement to cause individual enterprise to undertake that\r\nbranch of the task, and the remuneration of the Government would consist in\r\nthe addition readily made to our steam navy in case of emergency by the\r\nships so employed. Should this suggestion meet your approval, the propriety\r\nof placing such ships under the command of experienced officers of the Navy\r\nwill not escape your observation. The application of steam to the purposes\r\nof naval warfare cogently recommends an extensive steam marine as important\r\nin estimating the defenses of the country. Fortunately this may be obtained\r\nby us to a great extent without incurring any large amount of expenditure.\r\nSteam vessels to be engaged in the transportation of the mails on our\r\nprincipal water courses, lakes, and ports of our coast could also be so\r\nconstructed as to be efficient as war vessels when needed, and would of\r\nthemselves constitute a formidable force in order to repel attacks from\r\nabroad.. We can not be blind to the fact that other nations have already\r\nadded large numbers of steamships to their naval armaments and that this\r\nnew and powerful agent is destined to revolutionize the condition of the\r\nworld. It becomes the United States, therefore, looking to their security,\r\nto adopt a similar policy, and the plan suggested will enable them to do so\r\nat a small comparative cost.\r\n\r\nI take the greatest pleasure in bearing testimony to the zeal and untiring\r\nindustry which has characterized the conduct of the members of the\r\nExecutive Cabinet. Each in his appropriate sphere has rendered me the most\r\nefficient aid in carrying on the Government, and it will not, I trust,\r\nappear out of place for me to bear this public testimony. The cardinal\r\nobjects which should ever be held in view by those intrusted with the\r\nadministration of public affairs are rigidly, and without favor or\r\naffection, so to interpret the national will expressed in the laws as that\r\ninjustice should be done to none, justice to all. This has been the rule\r\nupon which they have acted, and thus it is believed that few cases, if any,\r\nexist wherein our fellow-citizens, who from time to time have been drawn to\r\nthe seat of Government for the settlement of their transactions with the\r\nGovernment, have gone away dissatisfied. Where the testimony has been\r\nperfected and was esteemed satisfactory their claims have been promptly\r\naudited, and this in the absence of all favoritism or partiality. The\r\nGovernment which is not just to its own people can neither claim their\r\naffection nor the respect of the world. At the same time, the Closest\r\nattention has been paid to those matters which relate more immediately to\r\nthe great concerns of the country. Order and efficiency in each branch of\r\nthe public service have prevailed, accompanied by a system of the most\r\nrigid responsibility on the part of the receiving and disbursing agents.\r\nThe fact, in illustration of the truth of this remark, deserves to be\r\nnoticed that the revenues of the Government, amounting in the last four\r\nyears to upward of $120,000,000, have been collected and disbursed through\r\nthe numerous governmental agents without the loss by default of any amount\r\nworthy of serious commentary.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations made by Congress for the improvement of the rivers of\r\nthe West and of the harbors on the Lakes are in a course of judicious\r\nexpenditure under suitable agents, and are destined, it is to be hoped, to\r\nrealize all the benefits designed to be accomplished by Congress. I can\r\nnot, however, sufficiently impress upon Congress the great importance of\r\nwithholding appropriations from improvements which are not ascertained by\r\nprevious examination and survey to be necessary for the shelter and\r\nprotection of trade from the dangers of stores and tempests. Without this\r\nprecaution the expenditures are but too apt to inure to the benefit of\r\nindividuals, without reference to the only consideration which can render\r\nthem constitutional--the public interests and the general good.\r\n\r\nI can not too earnestly urge upon you the interests of this District, over\r\nwhich by the Constitution Congress has exclusive jurisdiction. It would be\r\ndeeply to be regretted should there be at any time ground to complain of\r\nneglect on the part of a community which, detached as it is from the\r\nparental care of the States of Virginia and Maryland, can only expect aid\r\nfrom Congress as its local legislature. Amongst the subjects which claim\r\nyour attention is the prompt organization of an asylum for the insane who\r\nmay be found from time to time sojourning within the District. Such course\r\nis also demanded by considerations which apply to branches of the public\r\nservice. For the necessities in this behalf I invite your particular\r\nattention to the report of the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nI have thus, gentlemen of the two Houses of Congress, presented you a true\r\nand faithful picture of the condition of public affairs, both foreign and\r\ndomestic. The wants of the public service are made known to you, and\r\nmatters of no ordinary importance are urged upon your consideration. Shall\r\nI not be permitted to congratulate you on the happy auspices under which\r\nyou have assembled and at the important change in the condition of things\r\nwhich has occurred in the last three years? During that period questions\r\nwith foreign powers of vital importance to the peace of our country have\r\nbeen settled and adjusted. A desolating and wasting war with savage tribes\r\nhas been brought to a close. The internal tranquillity of the country,\r\nthreatened by agitating questions, has been preserved. The credit of the\r\nGovernment, which had experienced a temporary embarrassment, has been\r\nthoroughly restored. Its coffers, which for a season were empty, have been\r\nreplenished. A currency nearly uniform in its value has taken the place of\r\none depreciated and almost worthless. Commerce and manufactures, which had\r\nsuffered in common with every other interest, have once more revived, and\r\nthe whole country exhibits an aspect of prosperity and happiness. Trade and\r\nbarter, no longer governed by a wild and speculative mania, rest upon a\r\nsolid and substantial footing, and the rapid growth of our cities in every\r\ndirection bespeaks most strongly the favorable circumstances by which we\r\nare surrounded. My happiness in the retirement which shortly awaits me is\r\nthe ardent hope which I experience that this state of prosperity is neither\r\ndeceptive nor destined to be short lived, and that measures which have not\r\nyet received its sanction, but which I can not but regard as closely\r\nconnected with the honor, the glory, and still more enlarged prosperity of\r\nthe country, are destined at an early day to receive the approval of\r\nCongress. Under these circumstances and with these anticipations I shall\r\nmost gladly leave to others more able than myself the noble and pleasing\r\ntask of sustaining the public prosperity. I shall carry with me into\r\nretirement the gratifying reflection that as my sole object throughout has\r\nbeen to advance the public good I may not entirely have failed in\r\naccomplishing it; and this gratification is heightened in no small degree\r\nby the fact that when under a deep and abiding sense of duty I have found\r\nmyself constrained to resort to the qualified veto it has neither been\r\nfollowed by disapproval on the part of the people nor weakened in any\r\ndegree their attachment to that great conservative feature of our\r\nGovernment.",
