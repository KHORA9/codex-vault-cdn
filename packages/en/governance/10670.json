A. V.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Printed in 'The Star' on the morrow of M. Zola's condemnation in Paris]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PREFACE\r\n\r\nAll that I claim for this little book, reprinted from the columns of 'The\r\nEvening News,' is the quality of frankness. I do not desire to check or\r\ndisarm criticism, but I have a right to point out that I have performed\r\nmy work rapidly and have largely subordinated certain literary\r\nconsiderations to a desire to write my story naturally and simply, in\r\nmuch the same way as I should have told it in conversation with a friend.\r\nVery rarely, I think, have I departed from this rule.\r\n\r\nThe book supplies an accurate account of Emile Zola's exile in this\r\ncountry; but some matters I have treated briefly because he himself\r\nproposes to give the world--probably in diary form--some impressions of\r\nhis sojourn in England with a record of his feelings day by day whilst\r\nthe great campaign in favour of the unfortunate Alfred Dreyfus was in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, M. Zola intends to collect in a volume all his published\r\ndeclarations, articles and letters on the Affair. Secondly, he will\r\nrecount in another volume his trials at Paris and Versailles; and only in\r\na third volume will he be able to deal with his English experiences. The\r\nlast work can scarcely be ready before the end of 1900, and possibly it\r\nmay not appear until the following year. And this is one of the reasons\r\nwhich have induced me to offer to all who are interested in the great\r\nFrench writer this present narrative of mine. Should the master's\r\npromised record duly appear, my own will sink into oblivion; but if, for\r\none or another reason, M. Zola is prevented from carrying out his plans,\r\nhere, then, will at least be found some account of one of the most\r\ncurious passages in his life. And then, perchance, my narrative may\r\nattain to the rank of _memoire pour servir_.\r\n\r\nI have said that I claim for my book the quality of frankness. In this\r\nconnection I may point out that I have made in it a full confession of\r\ncertain delinquencies which were forced on me by circumstances. I trust,\r\nhowever, that my brother-journalists will forgive me if I occasionally\r\nled them astray with regard to M. Zola's presence in England; for I did\r\nso purely and simply in the interests of the illustrious friend who had\r\nplaced himself in my hands.\r\n\r\nThat M. Zola should have applied to me directly he arrived in London will\r\nsurprise none of those who are aware of the confidence he has for several\r\nyears reposed in me. A newspaper referring to our connection recently\r\ncalled the great novelist 'my employer.' But there has never been any\r\nquestion of employer or employed between Mr. Zola and me. I should\r\ncertainly never think of accepting remuneration for any little service I\r\nmight have been able to render him; nor would he dream of hurting my\r\nfeelings by offering it. No. The simple truth is that for some years now\r\nI have translated M. Zola's novels into English, and that I have taken my\r\nshare of the proceeds of the translations. For the rest our intercourse\r\nhas been purely and simply that of friends.\r\n\r\nIt is because, I believe, I know and understand Emile Zola so well, that\r\nI never once lost confidence in him throughout the events which led to\r\nhis exile in England. That exile, curiously enough, I foreshadowed in a\r\nletter addressed to the 'Star' some months before it actually began.\r\nWhen, however, one has been intimate with the French for thirty years or\r\nso it is not, to my thinking, so very difficult to tell what is likely to\r\nhappen in a given French crisis. The unexpected has to be reckoned with,\r\nof course; and much depends on ability to estimate the form which the\r\nunexpected may take. Here experience, familiarity with details of\r\ncontemporary French history, and personal knowledge of the men concerned\r\nin the issue, become indispensable.\r\n\r\nOn January 16, 1898, three days after M. Zola's famous 'J'accuse' letter\r\nappeared in 'L'Aurore,' and two days before the French Government\r\ninstructed the Public Prosecutor to proceed against its author, I wrote\r\nto the 'Westminster Gazette' a long letter dealing with M. Zola's\r\nposition. In this letter, which appeared in the issue of the 19th, I\r\nbegan by establishing a comparison between Zola and Voltaire, whose\r\naction with regard to the memory of Jean Calas I briefly epitomised.\r\nCuriously enough at that moment M. Zola, as I afterwards learnt, was\r\ntelling the Paris correspondent of the 'Daily Chronicle' that the\r\nopposition offered to his advocacy of the cause of Alfred Dreyfus was\r\nidentical with that encountered by Voltaire in his championship of Calas.\r\nThis was a curious little coincidence, for I wrote my letter without\r\nhaving any communication with M. Zola respecting it. It contained some\r\npasses which I here venture to quote. In a book dealing with the great\r\nnovelist these passages may not be out of place, as they serve to\r\nillustrate his general attitude towards the Dreyfus case.\r\n\r\n'Truth,' I wrote, 'has been the one passion of Emile Zola's life.* \"May\r\nall be revealed so that all may be cured\" has been his sole motto in\r\ndealing with social problems. \"Light, more light!\"--the last words gasped\r\nby Goethe on his death-bed--has ever been his cry. Holding the views he\r\nholds, he could not do otherwise than come forward at this crisis in\r\nFrench history as the champion of truth and justice. Silence on his part\r\nwould have been a denial of all his principles, all his past life. . . .\r\nAgainst him are marshalled all the Powers of Darkness, all the energy of\r\nthose who prefer concealment to light, all the enmity of the military\r\nhierarchy which has never forgotten \"La Debacle,\" all the hatred of the\r\nRoman hierarchy which will never forgive \"Lourdes\" and \"Rome.\" And the\r\nfetish of Patriotism is brandished hither and thither, rallying even\r\nfree-thinkers to the cause of concealment, while each and every appeal\r\nfor light and truth is met by the clamorous cry: \"Down with the dirty\r\nJews!\"\r\n\r\n  * He himself wrote these very words seventeen months later in\r\n    his article 'Justice,' published in Paris on his return from\r\n    exile.\r\n\r\n'For even as Jean Calas was guilty of being a Protestant so is Alfred\r\nDreyfus guilty of being a Jew, and at the present hour unhappily there\r\nare millions of French people who can no more believe in a Jew's\r\ninnocence than their forerunners could believe a Protestant to be\r\nguiltless. Zola, for his part, is no Jew, nor can he even be called a\r\nfriend of the Jews--in several of his books he has attacked them somewhat\r\nviolently for certain tendencies shown by some of their number--but most\r\nassuredly does he regard them as fellow-men and not as loathsome animals.\r\nIn the same way Voltaire wrote pungent pages against the narrow practices\r\nof Calvinism and yet espoused the causes of Calas and Sirven, even as\r\nZola has espoused that of Dreyfus. The only remaining question is whether\r\nZola will prove as successful as his famous forerunner. [Nearly the whole\r\nof the European press was at that stage expressing doubt on this point.]\r\nIn this connection I may say that I regard Zola as a man of very calm,\r\nmethodical, judicial mind. He is no ranter, no lover of words for words'\r\nsake, no fiery enthusiast. Each of his books is a most laborious,\r\npainstaking piece of work. If he ever brings forward a theory he bases it\r\non a mountain of evidence, and he invariably subordinates his feeling to\r\nhis reason. I therefore venture to say that if he has come forward so\r\nprominently in this Dreyfus case it is not because he _feels_ that wrong\r\nhas been done, but because he is absolutely _convinced_ of it. Doubtless\r\nmany of the expressions in his recent letter to President Faure have come\r\nfrom his heart, but they were in the first place dictated by his reason.\r\nIt is not for me here and at the present hour to speak of proofs, however\r\ngreat may be public curiosity; but most certainly Zola has not taken up\r\nthis case without what he considers to be abundant proof. I do not say he\r\nwill be able to prove each and every item of his great indictment, but\r\nwhen you wish to bring everything to light it is often necessary to cast\r\nyour net so wide that none shall escape it, none linger in concealment\r\nwith their actions unexplained. And I take it that whatever be the\r\nverdict of Zola's countrymen, whether or not Alfred Dreyfus be again and\r\nthis time absolutely proved guilty . . . Zola himself will have done good\r\nwork in striving to bring the whole truth to light so that it shall be as\r\nevident to one and all as the very sun itself. And this, when all is\r\nsaid, is really Zola's one great object in this terrible business.\r\n\r\n'I may add that he is risking far more than his great predecessor risked\r\nin favour of Calas. Voltaire pleaded from his retirement on the Swiss\r\nfrontier; Zola pleads the cause he has adopted on the very spot, on the\r\nvery scene of all the agitation. Anonymous assassins threaten him with\r\ndeath in letters and postcards. Fanatical Jew-baiters march through the\r\nstreets anxious for an opportunity to wreck his house and murder not only\r\nhimself but his wife also in the sacred name of Patriotism.* Should their\r\nmenaces be escaped there remains the Assize Court with a jury that will\r\nneed to be brave indeed if it is to resist all the pressure of a\r\ndeliberately organised \"terror.\" At the end possibly lie imprisonment,\r\nfine, disgrace, ruin. How jubilantly some are already rubbing their hands\r\nin the bishops' palaces, the parsonages, the sacristies of France! Ah! no\r\nstone will be kept unturned to secure a conviction! But Emile Zola does\r\nnot waver. It may be the truth, the whole truth will only be known to the\r\nworld in some distant century; but he, anxious to hasten its advent and\r\nprevent the irreparable, courageously stakes all that he has, person,\r\nposition, fame, affections, and friendships. . . . And this he does for\r\nno personal object whatsoever, but in the sole cause of truth and\r\njustice, ever repeating the cry common to both Goethe and himself:\r\n\"Light, more light!\"\r\n\r\n  * There is not the slightest doubt that M. Zola incurred the\r\n    greatest personal danger between January and April 1898.\r\n    M. Ranc, the old and tried Republican, who knows what danger\r\n    is, has lately pointed this out in forcible terms in the\r\n    Paris journal _Le Matin_.\r\n\r\n'Ah! to all the true hearts that have followed and loved him through\r\nyears of mingled blame and praise, hard-earned victory and unmerited\r\nreviling, he is at this hour dearer even than he was before; for he has\r\nnow put the seal upon his principles, and to the force of precept has\r\nadded that of the most courageous personal example.'\r\n\r\nThis then is what I wrote immediately after the publication of Zola's\r\nletter 'J'accuse,' basing myself simply on my knowledge of the master's\r\ncharacter, of the passions let loose in France, and of a few matters\r\nconnected with the Dreyfus case, then kept secret but now public\r\nproperty. And had I to write anything of the kind at the present time, I\r\nshould, I think, have but few words to alter beyond substituting the past\r\nfor the present or future tense. In one respect I was mistaken. I did not\r\nimagine the truth to be quite so near at hand. Since January 1898,\r\nhowever, nine-tenths of it have been revealed and the rest must now soon\r\nfollow. And I hold, as all hold who know the inner workings of l'Affaire\r\nDreyfus, that M. Zola's exile, like his letter to President Faure and his\r\nrepeated trials for libel, has in a large degree contributed to this\r\nvictory of truth. For by going into voluntary banishment, he kept not\r\nonly his own but also Dreyfus's case 'open,' and thus helped to foil the\r\nlast desperate attempts that were being made to prevent the truth from\r\nbeing discovered.\r\n\r\nI should add that in the following pages I deal very slightly with\r\nl'Affaire Dreyfus, on which so many books have already been written.\r\nIndeed, as a rule, I have only touched on those incidents which had any\r\nmarked influence on M. Zola during his sojourn in this country.\r\n\r\n                                              E. A. V.\r\n\r\nMERTON, SURREY.\r\n  June 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WITH ZOLA IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 I\r\n\r\n                         ZOLA LEAVES FRANCE\r\n\r\nFrom the latter part of the month of July 1898, down to the end of the\r\nensuing August, a frequent heading to newspaper telegrams and paragraphs\r\nwas the query, 'Where is Zola?' The wildest suppositions concerning the\r\neminent novelist's whereabouts were indulged in and the most\r\ncontradictory reports were circulated. It was on July 18 that M. Zola was\r\ntried by default at Versailles and sentenced to twelve months'\r\nimprisonment on the charge of having libelled, in his letter 'J'accuse,'\r\nthe military tribunal which had acquitted Commandant Esterhazy. On the\r\nevening of the 19th his disappearance was signalled by various telegrams\r\nfrom Paris. Most of these asserted that he had gone on a tour to Norway,\r\na course which the 'Daily News' correspondent declared to be very\r\nsensible on M. Zola's part, given the tropical heat which then prevailed\r\nin the French metropolis.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, however, the telegrams gave out that Zola had left Paris on\r\nthe previous evening by the 8.35 express for Lucerne, being accompanied\r\nby his wife and her maid. Later, the same day, appeared a graphic account\r\nof how he had dined at a Paris restaurant and thence despatched a waiter\r\nto the Eastern Railway Station to procure tickets for himself and a\r\nfriend. The very numbers of these tickets were given!\r\n\r\nYet a further telegram asserted that he had been recognised by a\r\nfellow-passenger, had left the train before reaching the Swiss frontier,\r\nand had gaily continued his journey on a bicycle. But another newspaper\r\ncorrespondent treated this account as pure invention, and pledged his\r\nword that M. Zola had gone to Holland by way of Brussels.\r\n\r\nOn July 21 his destination was again alleged to be Norway; but--so\r\ndesperate were the efforts made to reconcile all the conflicting\r\nrumours--his route was said to lie through Switzerland, Luxemburg, and\r\nthe Netherlands. His wife (so the papers reported) was with him, and they\r\nwere bicycling up hill and down dale through the aforenamed countries.\r\nTwo days later it was declared that he had actually been recognised at a\r\ncafe in Brussels whence he had fled in consequence of the threats of the\r\ncustomers, who were enraged 'by the presence of such a traitor.' Then he\r\nrepaired to Antwerp, where he was also recognised, and where he promptly\r\nembarked on board a steamer bound for Christiania.\r\n\r\nHowever, on July 25, the 'Petit Journal' authoritatively asserted that\r\nall the reports hitherto published were erroneous. M. Zola, said the\r\nParis print, was simply hiding in the suburbs of Paris, hoping to reach\r\nLe Havre by night and thence sail for Southampton. But fortunately the\r\nPrefecture of Police was acquainted with his plans, and at the first\r\nmovement he might make he would be arrested.\r\n\r\nThat same morning our own 'Daily Chronicle' announced M. Zola's presence\r\nat a London hotel, and on the following day the 'Morning Leader' was in a\r\nposition to state that the hotel in question was the Grosvenor. Both\r\n'Chronicle' and 'Leader' were right; but as I had received pressing\r\ninstructions to contradict all rumours of M. Zola's arrival in London, I\r\ndid so in this instance through the medium of the Press Association. I\r\nhere frankly acknowledge that I thus deceived both the Press and the\r\npublic. I acted in this way, however, for weighty reasons, which will\r\nhereafter appear.\r\n\r\nAt this point I would simply say that M. Zola's interests were, in my\r\nestimation, of far more consequence than the claims of public curiosity,\r\nhowever well meant and even flattering its nature.\r\n\r\nOne effect of the Press Association's contradiction was to revive the\r\nNorway and Switzerland stories. Several papers, while adhering to the\r\nstatement that M. Zola had been in London, added that he had since left\r\nEngland with his wife, and that Hamburg was their immediate destination.\r\nAnd thus the game went merrily on. M. Zola's arrival at Hamburg was duly\r\nreported. Then he sailed on the 'Capella' for Bergen, where his advent\r\nwas chronicled by Reuter. Next he was setting out for Trondhiem, whence\r\nin a few days he would join his friend Bjornstjerne Bjornson, the\r\nnovelist, at the latter's estate of Aulestad in the Gudbrandsdalen.\r\nBjornson, as it happened, was then at Munich, in Germany, but this\r\ncircumstance did not weigh for a moment with the newspapers. The Norway\r\nstory was so generally accepted that a report was spread to the effect\r\nthat M. Zola had solicited an audience of the Emperor William, who was in\r\nNorway about that time, and that the Kaiser had peremptorily refused to\r\nsee him, so great was the Imperial desire to do nothing of a nature to\r\ngive umbrage to France.\r\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, the only true reports (so far as London was\r\nconcerned) were those of two English newspapers, but even they were\r\ninaccurate in several matters of detail. For instance, the lady currently\r\nspoken of as Mme. Zola was my own wife, who, it so happens, is a\r\nFrenchwoman. At a later stage the 'Daily Mail' hit the nail on the head\r\nby signalling M. Zola's presence at the Oatlands Park Hotel; but so many\r\nreports having already proved erroneous, the 'Mail' was by no means\r\ncertain of the accuracy of its information, and the dubitative form in\r\nwhich its statement was couched prevented the matter from going further.\r\n\r\nAt last a period of comparative quiet set in, and though gentlemen of the\r\nPress were still anxious to extract information from me, nothing further\r\nappeared in print as to M. Zola's whereabouts until the 'Times' Paris\r\ncorrespondent, M. de Blowitz, contributed to his paper, early in the\r\npresent year, a most detailed and amusing account of M. Zola's flight\r\nfrom France and his subsequent movements in exile. In this narrative one\r\nfound Mme. Zola equipping her husband with a nightgown for his perilous\r\njourney abroad, and secreting bank notes in the lining of his garments.\r\nThen, carrying a slip of paper in his hand, the novelist had been passed\r\non through London from policeman to policeman, until he took train to a\r\nvillage in Warwickshire, where the little daughter of an innkeeper had\r\nrecognised him from seeing his portrait in one of the illustrated\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nThere was something also about his acquaintance with the vicar of the\r\nlocality and a variety of other particulars, all of which helped to make\r\nup as pretty a romance as the 'Times' readers had been favoured with for\r\nmany a day. But excellent as was M. de Blowitz's narrative from the\r\nromantic standpoint his information was sadly inaccurate. Of his _bona\r\nfides_ there can be no doubt, but some of M. Zola's friends are rather\r\npartial to a little harmless joking, and it is evident that a trap was\r\nlaid for the shrewd correspondent of the 'Times,' and that he, in an\r\nunguarded moment, fell into it.\r\n\r\nOn the incidents which immediately preceded M. Zola's departure from\r\nFrance I shall here be brief; these incidents are only known to me by\r\nstatements I have had from M. and Mme. Zola themselves. But the rest is\r\nwell within my personal knowledge, as one of the first things which M.\r\nZola did on arriving in England was to communicate with me and in certain\r\nrespects place himself in my hands.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is a plain unvarnished narrative--firstly, of the steps that\r\nI took in the matter, in conjunction with a friend, who is by profession\r\na solicitor; and, secondly, of the principal incidents which marked M.\r\nZola's views on some matters of interest, as imparted by him to me at\r\nvarious times. But, ultimately, M. Zola will himself pen his own private\r\nimpressions, and on these I shall not trespass. It is because, according\r\nto his own statements to me, his book on his English impressions (should\r\nhe write it) could not possibly appear for another twelve months, that I\r\nhave put these notes together.\r\n\r\nThe real circumstances, then, of M. Zola's departure from France are\r\nthese: On July 18, the day fixed for his second trial at Versailles, he\r\nleft Paris in a livery-stable brougham hired for the occasion at a cost\r\nof fifty francs. His companion was his _fidus Achates_, M. Fernand\r\nDesmoulin, the painter, who had already acted as his bodyguard at the\r\ntime of the great trial in Paris. Versailles was reached in due course,\r\nand the judicial proceedings began under circumstances which have been\r\nchronicled too often to need mention here. When M. Zola had retired from\r\nthe court, allowing judgment to go against him by default, he was joined\r\nby Maitre Labori, his counsel, and the pair of them returned to Paris in\r\nthe vehicle which had brought M. Zola from the city in the morning. M.\r\nDesmoulin found a seat in another carriage.\r\n\r\nThe brougham conveying Messrs. Zola and Labori was driven to the\r\nresidence of M. Georges Charpentier, the eminent publisher, in the Avenue\r\ndu Bois de Boulogne, and there they were presently joined by M. Georges\r\nClemenceau, Mme. Zola, and a few others. It was then that the necessity\r\nof leaving France was pressed upon M. Zola, who, though he found the\r\nproposal little to his liking, eventually signified his acquiescence.\r\n\r\nThe points urged in favour of his departure abroad were as follows: He\r\nmust do his utmost to avoid personal service of the judgment given\r\nagainst him by default, as the Government was anxious to cast him into\r\nprison and thus stifle his voice. If such service were effected the law\r\nwould only allow him a few days in which to apply for a new trial, and as\r\nhe could not make default a second time, and could not hope at that stage\r\nfor fresh and decisive evidence in his favour, or for a change of tactics\r\non the part of the judges, this would mean the absolute and irrevocable\r\nloss of his case.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, by avoiding personal service of the judgment he would\r\nretain the right to claim a new trial at any moment he might find\r\nconvenient; and thus not only could he prevent his own case from being\r\nclosed against him and becoming a _chose jugee_, but he would contribute\r\npowerfully towards keeping the whole Dreyfus affair open, pending\r\nrevelations which even then were foreseen. And, naturally, England which\r\nso freely gives asylum to all political offenders, was chosen as his\r\nproper place of exile.\r\n\r\nThe amusing story of the nightgown tucked under his arm and the bank\r\nnotes sewn up in his coat is, of course, pure invention. A few toilet\r\narticles were pressed upon him, and his wife emptied her own purse into\r\nhis own. That was all. Then he set out for the Northern Railway Station,\r\nwhere he caught the express leaving for Calais at 9 P.M. Fortunately\r\nenough he secured a first-class compartment which had no other occupant.\r\n\r\nM. Clemenceau had previously suggested to him that on his arrival at\r\nLondon he might well put up at the Grosvenor Hotel, and it is quite\r\npossible that the same gentleman handed him--as stated in the 'Times'\r\nnarrative--a slip of paper bearing the name of that noted hostelry. But,\r\nat all events, this paper was never used by M. Zola. He has an excellent\r\nmemory, and when he reached Victoria Station at forty minutes past five\r\no'clock on the morning of July 19, the name of the hotel where he had\r\narranged to fix his quarters for a few days came readily enough to his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one thing that he did not know, and that was the\r\nclose proximity of this hotel to the railway station. So, having secured\r\na hansom, he briefly told the Jehu to drive him to the Grosvenor. At\r\nthis, cabby looked down from his perch in sheer astonishment. Then,\r\ndoubtless, in a considerate and honest spirit--for there are still some\r\nconsiderate and honest cabbies in London--he tried to explain matters. At\r\nall events he spoke at length. But M. Zola failed to understand him.\r\n\r\n'Grosvenor Hotel,' repeated the novelist; and then, seeing that the cabby\r\nseemed bent on further expostulation, he resolutely took his seat in the\r\nvehicle. This driver, doubtless after the fashion of certain of his Paris\r\ncolleagues, must be trying to play some trick in order to avoid a long\r\njourney. It was as well, therefore, to teach him to refrain from trifling\r\nwith his 'fares.'\r\n\r\nHowever, cabby said no more, or if he did his words failed to reach M.\r\nZola. The reins were jerked, the scraggy night-horse broke into a\r\nspasmodic trot turned out of the station, and pulled up in front of the\r\ncaravansary which an eminent butcher has done so much to immortalise.\r\n\r\nZola was astonished at reaching his destination with such despatch, and\r\nsuddenly became conscious of the cabby's real motive in expostulating\r\nwith him. However, he ascended the steps, entered the hotel, produced one\r\nof the few hundred-franc notes which his purse contained, and asked first\r\nfor change and afterwards for a bedroom. English money was handed to him\r\nfor his note, and the night porter carried cabby the regulation shilling\r\nfor the journey of a few yards which had been made.\r\n\r\nThen, as M. Zola had no luggage with him, he was requested to deposit a\r\nsovereign with the hotel clerk and to inscribe his name in the register.\r\nThis he did, and the tell-tale signature of 'M. Pascal, Paris,' still\r\nremains as a token of the accuracy of this narrative.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the way in which M. Zola travelled across London,\r\nobligingly passed on from policeman to policeman, and carrying a slip of\r\npaper--a 'way-bill,' as it were--in his hand! As the above account was\r\ngiven to me by himself, it will probably be deemed more worthy of credit\r\nthan the amusing romance which was so successfully palmed off on M. de\r\nBlowitz of the 'Times.'\r\n\r\nOf his journey from Paris that night, he reclining alone in his\r\ncompartment as the Calais express rushed across the plains of Picardy\r\nunder a star-lit sky; of his embarking on board the little Channel boat\r\namidst the glimmer of lanterns, his transference to a fresh train at\r\nDover, followed by another and even faster rush on to London; of his\r\ngloomy thoughts at this sudden severance from one and all, at speeding in\r\nthis lonely fashion into exile, and returning surreptitiously, as it\r\nwere, to the city where but a few years previously he had been received\r\nas one of the kings of literature, he will ever retain a keen impression.\r\n\r\nIt was at Victoria that his journey ended, even as it had ended in 1893;\r\nbut how changed the scene! He finds the station gaunt and well-nigh\r\ndeserted; the few passengers are gliding away like phantoms into the\r\nmorning air; the porters loiter around, and the Customs officers\r\ndischarge their duties in a perfunctory, sleepy way. No crowd of Pressmen\r\nand sightseers is present; there are no delegates and address, and\r\nflowers, and cheers as of yore. Only cabby, who expostulates, and who\r\ndoubtless thinks this Frenchman a bit of a crank to insist upon being\r\ndriven just around the corner!\r\n\r\nAnd at the hotel no army of servants appears to marshal the master to the\r\nbest suite of rooms on the principal floor. In lieu thereof comes a\r\ndoubtful greeting and a demand for a deposit of money, for fear lest he\r\nshould be some vulgar bilker. Then, once he is in the lift, he goes up\r\nand up without stopping, until the very topmost floor is reached. And\r\nafterwards he is marched along interminable passages, with walls painted\r\na crude, hideous shade of blue, so offensive to all artistic instinct as\r\nverily to make one's gorge rise. Then at last he finds himself in a room\r\nwhich, high as it is situated, is of lowly, common aspect. Yet he is only\r\ntoo glad to reach it, and throw himself on the bed to rest awhile, and to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nNew experiences are awaiting him. He is far away from the mob that pelted\r\nhis windows with stones and yelled 'Conspuez! Conspuez!' whenever he left\r\nhis house. Here there is no hostility. Here quietude prevails, save for\r\nthe shrill whistles of arriving or departing trains. Yet he is also far\r\nfrom the great majority of his affections and friendships. But at this\r\nremembrance a fresh thought comes to him; he takes one of his visiting\r\ncards from his pocket-book, pencils a few lines on it, and encloses it in\r\nan envelope ready to be posted. Then he again lies down; tired as he is,\r\nafter his exciting day at Versailles and his wearisome night journey, he\r\nsoon falls soundly asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 II\r\n\r\n                             IN LONDON\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, July 19, I went to London on business, and did not return to\r\nmy home in the south-western suburbs until nearly seven o'clock in the\r\nevening. My wife immediately placed in my hands an envelope addressed to\r\nme in the handwriting of M. Zola. At first, having noticed neither the\r\nstamp nor the postmark, I imagined that the communication had come from\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nOn opening the envelope, however, I found that it contained a card on\r\nwhich was written in French and in pencil:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  'My dear confrere,--Tell nobody in the world, and particularly\r\n  no newspaper, that I am in London. And oblige me by coming to\r\n  see me to-morrow, Wednesday, at eleven o'clock, at Grosvenor\r\n  Hotel. You will ask for M. Pascal. And above all, absolute\r\n  Silence, for the most serious interests are at stake.\r\n\r\n                                        'Cordially,\r\n                                             'EMILE ZOLA.'\r\n\r\n\r\nI was for a moment amazed and also somewhat affected by this message, the\r\nfirst addressed by M. Zola to anybody after his departure from France.\r\nSince the publication of his novel 'Paris,' which had followed his first\r\ntrial, I had not seen him, and we had exchanged but few letters. I had\r\nwritten to express my sympathy over the outcome of the proceedings at\r\nVersailles, but owing to his sudden flitting my note had failed to reach\r\nhim. And now here he was in London--in exile, as, curiously enough, I\r\nmyself had foretold as probable some time before in a letter to one of\r\nthe newspapers.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to hurry to the Grosvenor immediately, but I\r\nreflected that I might not find him there, and that even if I did I might\r\ninconvenience him, as he had appointed the following day for my call. So\r\nI contented myself with telegraphing as follows: 'Pascal, Grosvenor\r\nHotel.--Rely on me, tomorrow, eleven o'clock.' And, as a precautionary\r\nmeasure, I signed the telegram merely with my Christian name.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I afterwards learnt, M. Zola had spent that day companionless, walking\r\nabout the Mall and St. James's Park, and purchasing a shirt, a collar,\r\nand a pair of socks at a shop in or near Buckingham Palace Road, where,\r\nknowing no English, he explained his requirements by pantomime. He had\r\nfurther studied several street scenes, and had given some time to\r\nwondering what purpose might be served by a certain ugly elongated\r\nbuilding, overlooking a drive and a park. There was a sentry at the gate,\r\nbut the place had such a gaunt, clumsy, and mournful aspect, that M. Zola\r\ncould not possibly picture it as the London palace of her most Gracious\r\nMajesty the Queen.\r\n\r\nHowever, evening found him once more in his room at the Grosvenor; and\r\nfeeling tired and feverish he lay down and dozed. When he awoke between\r\nnine and ten o'clock he perceived a buff envelope on the carpet near by\r\nhim. It had been thrust under the door during his sleep, and its presence\r\ngreatly astonished him, for he expected neither letter nor telegram. For\r\na moment, as he has told me, he imagined this to be some trap; wondered\r\nif he had been watched and followed to London, and almost made up his\r\nmind to leave the hotel that night. But when, after a little hesitation,\r\nhe had opened the envelope and read my telegram, he realised how\r\ngroundless had been his alarm.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, when I reached the Grosvenor and inquired at the office\r\nthere for M. Pascal, I was asked my name, on giving which I received a\r\nnote from M. Zola saying that he unexpectedly found himself obliged to go\r\nout, but would return at 2.30 P.M. As I stood reading this note, I espied\r\na couple of individuals scrutinising me in what I deemed a most\r\nsuspicious manner. Both were Frenchmen evidently; they wore billycock\r\nhats and carried stout sticks; and one of them, swarthy and almost\r\nbrigandish of aspect, had the ribbon of the Legion of Honour in his\r\nbuttonhole. It was easy to take these individuals for French detectives,\r\nand I hastily jumped to the conclusion that they were on 'M. Pascal's'\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nTo make matters even more suspicious, when, after placing Zola's note in\r\nmy pocket, I began to cross the vestibule, the others deliberately\r\nfollowed me, and in all likelihood I should have fled never to return if\r\na well-known figure in a white billycock and grey suit had not suddenly\r\nadvanced towards us from the direction of the staircase. In another\r\nmoment I had exchanged greetings with M. Zola, and my suspicious\r\nscrutinisers had been introduced to me as friends. One of them was none\r\nother than M. Fernand Desmoulin. They had arrived from Paris that\r\nmorning, and were about to sally forth with M. Zola in search of Mr.\r\nFletcher Moulton, Q.C., to whom they had brought a letter of introduction\r\nfrom Maitre Labori.\r\n\r\nHence the note which M. Zola had already deposited for me at the hotel\r\noffice. Had I been a moment later I should have found them gone.\r\n\r\nMy arrival led to a change in the programme. It was resolved to begin\r\nmatters with lunch at the hotel itself, to postpone the quest for Mr.\r\nFletcher Moulton until the afternoon. I made, at the time, a note of our\r\nmenu. The 'bitter bread of exile' consisted on this occasion of an\r\nomelet, fried soles, fillet of beef, and potatoes. To wash down this\r\nanchoretic fare M. Desmoulin and myself ordered Sauterne and Apollinaris;\r\nbut the contents of the water bottle sufficed for M. Zola and the other\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nWith waiters moving to and fro, nearly always within hearing, there was\r\nlittle conversation at table, but we afterwards chatted in all freedom in\r\nM. Zola's room just under the roof. Ah! that room. I have already\r\nreferred to the dingy aspect which it presented. Around Grosvenor Hotel,\r\nencompassing its roof, runs a huge ornamental cornice, behind which are\r\nthe windows of rooms assigned, I suppose, to luggageless visitors. From\r\nthe rooms themselves there is nothing to be seen unless you throw back\r\nyour head, when a tiny patch of sky above the top line of the cornice\r\nbecomes visible. You are, as it were, in a gloomy well. The back of the\r\ncornice, with its plaster stained and cracked, confronts your eyes; and\r\nwith a little imagination you can easily fancy yourself in a dungeon\r\nlooking into some castle moat.\r\n\r\n'_Le fosse de Vincennes_,' so M. Zola suggested, and that summed up\r\neverything. Yet it seemed to him very appropriate to his circumstances,\r\nand he absolutely refused to exchange rooms with M. Desmoulin, who was\r\nsomewhat more comfortably lodged.\r\n\r\nThe appointments of M. Zola's chamber were, I remember, of a summary\r\ndescription. There were few chairs, and so one of us sat on the bed. We\r\nsucceeded in procuring some black coffee, though the chambermaid regarded\r\nthis as a most unusual 'bedroom order' at that hour of the day; and when\r\nM. Desmoulin had lighted a cigar, his friend a pipe, and myself a\r\ncigarette, a regular Council of War was held. [N.B.--M. Zola gave up\r\ntobacco in his young days, when it was a question of his spending\r\ntwopence per diem on himself, or of allowing his mother the wherewithal\r\nto buy an extra pound of bread.]\r\n\r\nThe council dealt mainly with two points--first, what was M. Zola to do\r\nin England? Should he go into the country, or to the seaside, or settle\r\ndown in the London suburbs? Since he wished to avoid recognition, it\r\nwould be foolish for him to remain in London, particularly at an hotel\r\nlike the Grosvenor. Then, for my benefit, the legal position was set\r\nforth, as well as the object of taking Maitre Labori's letter to Mr.\r\nFletcher Moulton.\r\n\r\nThe chief point was, Could the French Government in any way signify the\r\njudgment of the Versailles Court to M. Zola personally while he remained\r\nin Great Britain? If the French officials could legally do nothing of\r\nthat kind, there would be less necessity for M. Zola to court retirement.\r\n\r\nAfter the hurly-burly of _l'affaire Dreyfus_, he certainly needed some\r\nrest and privacy, but the question was whether retirement would be a\r\nnecessity or a mere matter of convenience. Now the choice of a place of\r\nsojourn depended on the answer to the second question, and it was\r\nresolved, _nem. con._, that M. Desmoulin, who spoke a little English and\r\nknew something of London, should forthwith drive to Mr. Fletcher\r\nMoulton's house in Onslow Square, S.W., in accordance with the address\r\ngiven on M. Labori's letter. M. Desmoulin's friend, on his side, was to\r\nreturn to Paris that afternoon by the Club train. So, the council over,\r\nboth these gentlemen went off, leaving M. Zola and myself together.\r\n\r\nWe had a long and desultory chat, now on the Dreyfus affair generally,\r\nnow on M. Zola's personal position, the probable duration of his exile,\r\nand so forth. He himself did not think that he would remain abroad beyond\r\nOctober at the latest, and as there might be a delay if not a difficulty\r\nin getting any clothes sent to him from Paris, he proposed to make a few\r\npurchases.\r\n\r\nIt was then that he told me how he had already bought a shirt, collar,\r\nand socks on the previous day.\r\n\r\n'I had nothing but what I was wearing,' said he. 'I had been to\r\nVersailles and had sat perspiring in the crowded court; then I had spent\r\nthe night travelling. I looked dirty, and I felt abominably\r\nuncomfortable. So I go out, yesterday morning, and see a shop with\r\nshirts, neckties, collars, and socks in the window. I go in; I take hold\r\nof my collar, I pull down my cuffs, I tap my shirt front. The shopman\r\nsmiles; he understands me. He measures my neck; he gives me a shirt and\r\nsome collars. But then we come to the socks, and I pull up my trousers\r\nand point to those I am wearing. He understands immediately. He is very\r\nintelligent. He climbs his steps and pulls parcels and boxes from his\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\n'Here are socks of all colours, dark and light, spotted, striped, in\r\nmixtures, in cotton, in wool, some ribbed and some with silk clockings.\r\nBut they are huge! I look at one pair; it is too big; he shows me another\r\nand another; they are still of a larger size. Then, impatient, and\r\nperhaps rather abruptly, I hold out my fist for the man to measure it,\r\nand thus gauge the length of my foot as is done in Paris. But he does not\r\nunderstand me. He draws back close to the shelves as if he imagines that\r\nI want to box him. And when I again lift my foot to call his attention to\r\nits size, he shows even greater concern. Fortunately an idea comes to me.\r\nI take one of the mammoth socks that are lying on the counter and fold\r\nparts of it neatly back, so as to make it appear very much smaller than\r\nit is. Then the shopman suddenly brightens, taps his forehead, climbs his\r\nsteps again, and pulls yet more boxes and parcels from his shelves. And\r\nhere at last are the small socks! So I choose a pair, and pay the bill.\r\nAnd the man bows his thanks, well pleased, it seems, to find that in\r\nthrusting out my fist and raising my foot I had been actuated by no\r\ndesire to injure him.'\r\n\r\nI was still chuckling over M. Zola's anecdote when M. Desmoulin returned\r\nfrom his journey to Onslow Square. He had there interviewed a smart boy\r\nin buttons, who had informed him that his learned master was out of town\r\nelectioneering, and might not be home again for a week or two. Desmoulin\r\nhad, therefore, retained possession of Maitre Labori's note of\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nI now remembered what I ought to have recalled before--namely that Mr.\r\nFletcher Moulton was at that moment a candidate for the parliamentary\r\nrepresentation of the Launceston division of Cornwall. Under such\r\ncircumstances it was unlikely that his advice would be available for some\r\nlittle time to come. And so all idea of applying to him was abandoned. It\r\nmay be that this narrative, should it meet the learned gentleman's eye,\r\nwill for the first time acquaint him with what was intended by M. Zola,\r\nacting under Maitre Labori's advice.\r\n\r\nM. Zola, I should add, remained most anxious to secure an English legal\r\nopinion on his position, and I therefore suggested to him that I should\r\nthat evening consult a discreet and reliable friend of mine, a solicitor.\r\nWe, of course, well knew that there could be no extradition, but it was a\r\npoint whether a copy of the Versailles judgment might not be legally be\r\nplaced in M. Zola's hands, under such conventions as might exist between\r\nFrance and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThis, I thought, could be ascertained within the next forty-eight hours,\r\nand meantime M. Zola might remain where he was, for I could not well\r\noffer him an asylum in my little home. My connection with him as his\r\nEnglish translator being so widely known, newspaper reporters were\r\ncertain to call upon me, and what ever precautions I might take, his\r\npresence in my house would speedily be discovered. On the other hand, M.\r\nDesmoulin wished to go to Brighton or Hastings, but, in my estimation,\r\nboth those places, crowded with holiday-makers, were not desirable spots.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Grosvenor, the three of us discussed these matters while\r\nstrolling up Buckingham Palace Road. It was a warm sunshiny afternoon,\r\nand the street was full of people. All at once a couple of ladies passed\r\nus, and one of them, after turning her head in our direction, made a\r\nremark to her companion.\r\n\r\n'Did you hear that?' Desmoulin eagerly inquired. 'She spoke in French!'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' I replied. 'What did she say?'\r\n\r\n'\"Why,\" she exclaimed, \"there's M. Zola!\" Our secret is as good as gone\r\nnow! It will be all over London by to-morrow!'\r\n\r\nWe felt somewhat alarmed. Who could those ladies be? For my part I had\r\nscarcely noticed them. Desmoulin opined, however, that they might\r\nperchance be French actresses, members possibly of Madame Sarah\r\nBernhardt's company, which was then in London. And again he urged the\r\nnecessity of immediate departure. They must go to Hastings, Brighton,\r\nRamsgate--some place at all events where the author of 'J'accuse' would\r\nincur less chance of recognition.\r\n\r\nTo me it seemed that some quiet, retired country village would be most\r\nsuitable. In any town M. Zola would incur great risk of being identified.\r\nMoreover his appearance was conspicuous, his white billycock, his\r\nglasses, his light grey suit, his rosette of the Legion of Honour, his\r\nmany characteristic gestures all attracted attention. If anything was to\r\nbe done he must begin by Anglicising his appearance. But whatever I might\r\nurge I found him stubborn on that point; and, as for departure from\r\nLondon, he preferred to postpone this until I should have seen my friend\r\nthe solicitor.\r\n\r\n'Everything is as good as lost!' cried M. Desmoulin. 'How foolish, too,\r\nof Clemenceau to have sent you to a swell hotel in a fashionable\r\nneighbourhood! I am certain there are other French people staying at the\r\nGrosvenor--I heard somebody talking French there this morning.'\r\n\r\nThis again might lead to unpleasantness, and I could see that the master\r\nwas gradually growing anxious. By this time, however, we had reached St.\r\nJames's Park, and there, as we seated ourselves on some chairs beside the\r\nornamental water, I led the conversation into another channel by\r\nproducing an evening newspaper, and reading therefrom successive\r\nnarratives of how M. Zola had sailed for Norway, how he had taken train\r\nat the Eastern Terminus in Paris, and how he had been bicycling through\r\nthe Oberland on his way to some mysterious Helvetian retreat. Then we\r\nlaughed--ah! those journalists!--and fears were at an end.\r\n\r\nThe ducks paddled past us, the drooping foliage of the island trees\r\nstirred in the warm breeze. On a bench near at hand a couple of vagrants\r\nsat dozing, with their toes protruding through their wretched footgear.\r\nThen a soldier, smart and pert, strolled up, a flower between his lips\r\nand a good-looking girl beside him. Away in front of us were the top\r\nwindows and the roofs of St. Anne's Mansions. Farther, on the left, the\r\nclock tower of Westminster glinted in the sun-rays.\r\n\r\n'Fine ducks!' said M. Zola.\r\n\r\n'A pretty corner,' added Desmoulin, waving his hand towards some branches\r\nthat drooped to the water's edge. And suddenly I remembered and told them\r\nof another French exile, the epicurean St. Evremond, whose needs were\r\nrelieved by Charles II. appointing him governor of yonder Duck Island at\r\na salary of three hundred pounds a year.\r\n\r\n'Well, I have little money in my pocket,' quoth Zola, 'but I don't think\r\nI shall come to that. I hope that my pen alone will always yield me the\r\nlittle I require.'\r\n\r\nBut Big Ben struck the hour. It was six o'clock. So we separated, Messrs.\r\nZola and Desmoulin to retire to the dungeon at the Grosvenor, and I to go\r\nin search of my friend the solicitor at his private house at Wimbledon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                III\r\n\r\n                           DANGER SIGNALS\r\n\r\nThat evening, I called upon my friend--Mr. F. W. Wareham, of Wimbledon,\r\nand Ethelburge House, Bishopsgate Street--and laid before him the legal\r\npoints. I afterwards arranged to see him on the following morning in\r\ntown, when I hoped to fix a meeting between him and M. Zola. My first\r\ncall on Thursday, July 21, was made to the Grosvenor Hotel, where I found\r\nboth the master and M. Desmoulin in a state of anxiety. M. Zola, for his\r\npart, felt altogether out of his element. After the excitement of his\r\ntrial and his journey to England, and the novelty of finding himself\r\nstranded in a strange city, a kind of reaction had set in and he was\r\nextremely depressed.\r\n\r\nM. Desmoulin on his side, having procured several morning newspapers, had\r\nexplored their columns to ascertain whether the ladies by whom the master\r\nhad been recognised in the street on the previous day, had by any chance\r\nnoised the circumstance abroad. However, the Press was still on the\r\nNorway and Holland scents, and as yet not a paper so much as suggested M.\r\nZola's presence in England.\r\n\r\n'There has hardly been time,' said Desmoulin to me, 'but there will\r\nprobably be something fresh this afternoon. Those actresses are certain\r\nto tell people, and we shall have to make ourselves scarce.'\r\n\r\nI tried to cheer and tranquillise both him and M. Zola, and then arranged\r\nthat Wareham should come to the hotel at 2 P.M. Meantime, said I,\r\nwhatever M. Desmoulin might do, it would be as well for M. Zola to remain\r\nindoors. Several commissions were entrusted to me, and I went off,\r\npromising to return about noon.\r\n\r\nI betook myself first to Messrs. Chatto and Windus's in St. Martin's\r\nLane, where I arrived a few minutes before ten o'clock. Neither Mr.\r\nChatto nor his partner, Mr. Percy Spalding, had as yet arrived, and I\r\ntherefore had to wait a few minutes. When Mr. Spalding made his\r\nappearance he greeted me with a smile, and while leading the way to his\r\nprivate room exclaimed, 'So our friend Zola is in London!'\r\n\r\nTo describe my amazement is beyond my powers. I could only gasp, 'How do\r\nyou know that?'\r\n\r\n'Why, my wife saw him yesterday in Buckingham Palace Road.'\r\n\r\nI was confounded. For my part I had scarcely glanced at the ladies whom\r\nDesmoulin had conjectured to be French actresses--simply because they\r\nwere young, prepossessing, and spoke French!--and certainly I should not\r\nreadily have recognised Mrs. Spalding, whom I had only met once some\r\nyears previously. It now seemed to me rather fortunate that she should be\r\nthe person who had recognised M. Zola, since she would naturally be\r\ndiscreet as soon as the situation should be made clear to her.\r\n\r\nAfter I had explained the position, I ascertained that the only person\r\nbesides herself who knew anything so far were her husband and the lady\r\nfriend who had accompanied her on the previous day.\r\n\r\n'I will telegraph to my wife at once,' said Mr. Spalding, 'and you may be\r\nsure that the matter will go no further. We certainly had a hearty laugh\r\nat breakfast this morning when we read in the \"Telegraph\" of Zola\r\nbicycling over the Swiss frontier; but, of course, as from what you tell\r\nme, the matter is serious, neither my wife nor myself will speak of it.'\r\n\r\n'And her friend?' I exclaimed, 'she knows nothing of the necessity for\r\nsecrecy, and may perhaps gossip about it.'\r\n\r\n'She is going to Hastings to-day.'\r\n\r\n'Hastings!' said I, 'why M. Desmoulin, Zola's companion, does nothing but\r\ntalk of going to Hastings! I am glad I know this. Hastings is barred for\r\ngood, so far as Zola is concerned.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I will arrange for my wife to see her friend this morning before\r\nshe starts,' Mr. Spalding rejoined, 'and in this way we may be sure that\r\nher friend will say nothing.'\r\n\r\nThis excellent suggestion was acted upon immediately. Mr. Spalding\r\ntelegraphed full instructions to his wife, and later in the day I learnt\r\nthat everything had been satisfactorily arranged. But for this timely\r\naction, following upon my lucky call at Messrs. Chatto and Windus's\r\nestablishment, it is virtually certain that the meeting in the Buckingham\r\nPalace Road would have been talked about and the game of 'Where is Zola?'\r\nbrought to an abrupt conclusion. As it happened, both ladies, being duly\r\nwarned, preserved absolute secrecy.\r\n\r\nAfter going to Bishopsgate Street to see Wareham, and executing several\r\nminor commissions, I returned to the Grosvenor, where Zola and Desmoulin\r\nwere much amused when I told them of the outcome of the previous day's\r\nfright.\r\n\r\n'It was a remarkable coincidence certainly,' said M. Zola. 'At a low\r\ncalculation I daresay a thousand women passed me in the streets\r\nyesterday; just one of them recognised me, and she, you say, was Mrs.\r\nSpalding. Shortsighted as I am, not having seen her, too, since I was in\r\nEngland, a few years ago, I had no notion she was the person who turned\r\nas she passed along, and said, \"There's Monsieur Zola.\"\r\n\r\n'But the curious part of it is that you should have had to go to\r\nChatto's, and should have learnt the lady's name so promptly from her\r\nhusband! Mathematically there were untold chances that this lady who\r\nrecognised me might be some stranger's wife, and that we might never more\r\nhear anything of her! Yet you discover her identity at once. This is the\r\nkind of thing which occasionally occurs in novels, but which critics say\r\nnever happens in real life. Well, now we know the contrary.'\r\n\r\nAnd he added gaily, 'You see it is another instance of my good luck,\r\nwhich still attends me in spite of all the striving of those who bear me\r\ngrudges.'\r\n\r\nSo far as the ladies were concerned things were, indeed, very\r\nsatisfactory. But the same could hardly be said of the position at the\r\nGrosvenor. Neither M. Zola nor M. Desmoulin could leave the hotel or\r\nreturn to it without being scrutinised. They had also noticed many a\r\nglance in their direction at meal-time in the dining-room; and they had\r\ncome to the conclusion that departure was imperative. I did not gainsay\r\nthem, for I shared their views, and, in fact, I had already discussed the\r\nmatter with Wareham. I explained, however, that one must have a few hours\r\nto devise suitable plans.\r\n\r\nSeaside places were dangerous at that time of the year, and the best\r\ncourse would probably be to take a furnished house in the country.\r\nMeantime, said I, Wareham had kindly offered to accommodate M. Zola at\r\nhis residence at Wimbledon, while M. Desmoulin might sleep close by at\r\nthe house of Mr. Everson (Wareham's managing clerk), who also disposed of\r\na spare bedroom. Further discussion of these matters was postponed,\r\nhowever, until Wareham's arrive at the Grosvenor in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nAs Zola and Desmoulin both distrusted the inquisitive glances of the\r\nvisitors and the attendants at the hotel, we lunched, I remember, at a\r\nrestaurant in or near Victoria Street--a deep, narrow place, crowded with\r\nlittle tables. And here again M. Zola, in his light garments, with the\r\nrosette of the Legion of Honour showing brightly in his buttonhole,\r\nbecame the observed of all observers.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, so conspicuous, so characteristic a figure that, looking\r\nbackward and remembering how repeatedly the illustrated papers had\r\nportrayed him and how many photographs of him were to be seen in shop\r\nwindows, I often wonder how it happened that he was not recognised a\r\nhundred times during those few days spent in London. It may be that many\r\ndid recognise him, but held their tongues. As yet, certainly, there was\r\nnot a word in the newspapers to set his adversaries upon his track.\r\n\r\nIt was in a corner of the smoking-room at the Grosvenor, a hot gloomy\r\napartment overlooking Victoria Station, that I introduced Wareham to the\r\nnovelist. The former had already formed some opinion, but a few points\r\nremained for consideration. The chief of these, as Wareham explained, was\r\nhow far the French Republic might claim jurisdiction over Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nIn matters of process some countries asserted a measure of authority over\r\ntheir subjects wherever they might be; and the question was, what might\r\nbe the law of France in that respect? Of course M. Zola could not be\r\nextradited. The offence for which he had been sentenced did not come\r\nwithin the purview of the Extradition Act. Again (in reply to a query\r\nfrom M. Zola), there was no diplomatic channel through which a French\r\ncriminal libel judgment could be signified in England. But suppose that\r\nFrench detectives should discover M. Zola's whereabouts, and suppose a\r\nFrench process-server should quietly come to England with a couple of\r\nwitnesses, and by some craft or good luck should succeed in placing a\r\ncopy of the Versailles judgment in M. Zola's hands?\r\n\r\nUnless a breach of the Queen's peace were committed, it might be\r\ndifficult for the English authorities to interfere. There appeared to be\r\nno case or precedent in England applying to such a matter. In Germany a\r\nforeign process-server would be liable to penal servitude. But, of\r\ncourse, that was not to the point. Again, although the service by a\r\nforeigner might not hold good in English law, that had nothing to do with\r\nit. The process-server and his witnesses would immediately return to\r\nFrance; they would there prove to the satisfaction of their employers\r\nthat they had served the judgment on M. Zola personally, and they would\r\nbe able to snap their fingers at English lawyers should the latter\r\ncomplain that the thrusting of a document into a man's hand under such\r\ncircumstances was a technical assault. They would have gained their\r\npoint. Judgment would have been served, and in accordance with French law\r\nM. Zola would be called upon to enter an appearance against it at\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\n'Things must largely depend,' concluded Wareham, 'on whether French law\r\nallows process to be served on a subject out of the jurisdiction. And\r\nthat is a point rather for French legal advisers than for me. Still I\r\nshall look into the matter further; and if at the same time Maitre Labori\r\ncan be communicated with and can supply his opinion on the question, so\r\nmuch the better. I now raise the point because it seems the crux of the\r\nwhole matter, and if it goes against us it is certain that M. Zola ought\r\nto remain in close retirement. For the present it is as well that he\r\nshould run as little risk as possible.'\r\n\r\nM. Zola acquiesced in the suggestion of writing to his French counsel on\r\nthe point which had been raised; and the conversation then went on in the\r\nsame low tone that had been preserved from the outset.\r\n\r\nOn entering the smoking-room we had found it deserted, but whilst Wareham\r\nwas speaking a couple of gentlemen had come in. One, I remember, was an\r\nelderly, florid man, with mutton-chop whiskers and a buff waistcoat, who\r\ntook his stand beside the fireplace at the further end of the room and\r\npuffed away at a big cigar. He looked inoffensive enough, and paid no\r\nattention to us. But the other, a middle-aged individual, tall and slim,\r\nwith military moustaches, eyed us very keenly, changed his position two\r\nor three times, and finally installed himself in a chair, whence, while\r\ntrifling with a cigarette, he commanded a good view of M. Zola's face.\r\nDesmoulin, I think, was the first to notice this, and to call the\r\nnovelist's attention to it. Zola then shifted his position, and the\r\nmilitary looking gentleman soon did the same. At last, doubtless having\r\nsatisfied his curiosity, he left the room, not, however, without a sharp,\r\ncomprehensive survey of our party as he passed us on his way out.\r\n\r\nI do not now exactly remember how it happened that Wareham was not\r\nreceived in the 'dungeon,' instead of the smoking-room. The choice of the\r\nlatter apartment was unfortunate. I have no doubt that, if some of the\r\nnewspapers were, a day or two afterwards, able to state that M. Zola was\r\nstaying at the Grosvenor Hotel, it was through certain remarks made by\r\nthe inquisitive military looking gentleman to whom I have referred.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand his curiosity exercised decisive influence over M.\r\nZola's subsequent movements. He had hitherto been rather chary of\r\naccepting Wareham's hospitality, for fear lest he should inconvenience\r\nhim. But the offer now being renewed was promptly accepted, and it was\r\nagreed that I should take both Messrs. Zola and Desmoulin to Wimbledon\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\nAs it was to be expected that several letters from Paris would arrive at\r\nthe hotel, addressed to M. Pascal, I arranged to call or send for them.\r\nThe same course was adopted with regard to a few articles which M. Zola\r\nhad given to be washed and which had not yet been returned to him. Some\r\nof these things were significantly marked with the letter 'Z,' and for\r\nthis reason it was desirable that they should be recovered. Here I may\r\nmention that during the next few days my wife repeatedly called at the\r\nGrosvenor for M. Zola's correspondence, a circumstance which doubtless\r\ngave rise to the rumour that Mme. Zola had joined her husband in London.\r\n\r\nThe exodus from the hotel was not particularly imposing. M. Desmoulin had\r\noriginally intended to stay but one day in London, and thus merely had a\r\ndressing-case with him. As for M. Zola, his few belongings (inclusive of\r\na small bottle of ink, which he would not part with) were stuffed into\r\nhis pockets, or went towards the making of a peculiarly shaped newspaper\r\nparcel, tied round with odd bits of string. Dressing-case and parcel were\r\nduly brought down into the grand vestibule, where the hotel servants\r\nsmiled on them benignly. There was, indeed, some little humour in the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe novelist, with his gold pince-nez and gold watch-chair, his red\r\nrosette, and a large and remarkably fine diamond sparking on one of his\r\nlittle fingers, looked so eminently respectable that it was difficult to\r\nassociate him with the wretched misshapen newspaper parcel--his only\r\nluggage!--which he eyed so jealously. However, as the attendants were all\r\nliberally fee'd, they remained strictly polite even if they felt amused.\r\nI ordered a hansom to be called, and we just contrived to squeeze\r\nourselves and the precious newspaper parcel inside it. The dressing-case\r\nwas hoisted aloft. Then the hotel porter asked me, 'Where to, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Charing Cross Station,' I replied, and the next moment we were bowling\r\nalong Buckingham Palace Road.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a minute elapsed before I tapped the cab-roof with my walking\r\nstick. On cabby looking down at me, I said, 'Did I tell you Charing Cross\r\njust now, driver? Ah! well, I made a mistake. I meant Waterloo.'\r\n\r\n'Right, sir,' rejoined cabby; and on we went.\r\n\r\nIt was a paltry device, perhaps, this trick of giving one direction in\r\nthe hearing of the hotel servants, and then another when the hotel was\r\nout of sight. But, as the reader must know, this kind of thing is always\r\ndone in novels--particularly in detective stories.\r\n\r\nAnd recollections had come to me of some of Gaboriau's tales which long\r\nago I had helped to place before the English public. It might be that the\r\nrenowned Monsieur Lecoq or his successor, or perchance some English\r\n_confrere_ like Mr. Sherlock Holmes, would presently be after us, and so\r\nit was just as well to play the game according to the orthodox rules of\r\nromance. After all, was it not in something akin to a romance that I was\r\nliving?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\n                        A CHANGE OF QUARTERS\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that the departure of Messrs. Zola and Desmoulin\r\nfrom the Grosvenor Hotel took place almost immediately after Wareham had\r\nreturned to his office. We were not to meet our friend the solicitor\r\nagain until the evening at Wimbledon, but the hotel being apparently a\r\ndangerous spot, it was thought best to quit it forthwith.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Waterloo the dressing-case and the newspaper parcel were\r\ndeposited at one of the cloak-rooms; and after making the round of the\r\nstation, we descended into the Waterloo Road. At first we sauntered\r\ntowards the New Cut, and of course M. Zola could not help noticing the\r\ncontrast between the dingy surroundings amidst which he now found himself\r\nand the stylish shops and roads he had seen in the Buckingham Palace\r\nRoad. The vista was not cheering, so I proposed that we should retrace\r\nour steps and go as far as Waterloo Bridge.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be little risk in doing so, for, as usual hereabouts in\r\nthe middle of the afternoon, there were few people to be seen. The great\r\nsuccessive rush of homeward-bound employers, clerks, and workpeople had\r\nnot yet set in. And, moreover, there was plenty of time; for Wareham,\r\nhaving important business in town that day, could not possibly be at\r\nWimbledon till half-past six at the earliest.\r\n\r\nWe reached the bridge--'that monument,' as a famous Frenchman once put\r\nin, 'worthy of Sesostris and the Caesars'--and went about half-way\r\nacross. It was splendid weather, and the Thames was aglow with the\r\ncountless reflections of the sunbeams that fell from the hot, whitening\r\nsky. London was before us, 'with her palaces down to the water'; and M.\r\nZola stopped short, gazing intently at the scene.\r\n\r\n'Up-stream the view was spoilt,' said he, 'by the hideous Hungerford\r\nBridge, unworthy alike of the city and the river'--an erection such as no\r\nParis municipality would have tolerated for four and twenty hours. It was\r\nthe more obtrusive and aggravating, since beyond it one discerned but\r\nlittle of the towers of Westminster. 'Admitting,' added the novelist,\r\n'that a bridge is needed at that point for railway traffic, surely there\r\nis no reason why it should be so surprisingly ugly. However, from all I\r\nsee, it seems more and more evident that you English people are very much\r\nin the habit of sacrificing beauty to utility, forgetting that with a\r\nlittle artistic sense it is easy to combine the two.'\r\n\r\nThen, however, he turned slightly, and looked down-stream where the\r\nVictoria Embankment spreads past the Temple to Blackfriars. The\r\ncolonnades of Somerset House showed boldly and with a certain majesty in\r\nthe foreground, whilst in the distance, high over every roof, arose the\r\nleaden dome of St. Paul's. This vista was rather to M. Zola's liking.\r\nClose beside us, on the bridge, was one of the semi-circular embrasures\r\ngarnished with stone seats. A pitiful-looking vagrant was lolling there;\r\nbut this made no difference to M. Zola. He installed himself on the seat\r\nwith Desmoulin on one hand and myself on the other, and there we remained\r\nfor some little time looking about us and chatting.\r\n\r\n'This was the only thing wanted,' said Desmoulin, who generally had some\r\nhumorous remark in readiness for every situation. 'Yesterday at the\r\nGrosvenor we were in the _fosse de Vincennes_, and now, as they say in\r\nthe melodrama of \"The Knights of the Fog\" (\"Les Chevaliers du\r\nBrouillard\"*), we are \"homeless wanderers stranded on the bridges of\r\nLondon.\"'\r\n\r\n  * The French dramatic adaptation of Ainsworth's 'Jack Sheppard.'\r\n\r\nThe allusion to the fog roused M. Zola from his contemplation.\r\n\r\n'But where is the Savoy Hotel, where I stayed in '93?' he inquired. 'It\r\nmust be very near here.'\r\n\r\nI pointed it out to him, and he was astonished. 'Why, no--that cannot be!\r\nIt is so large a place, and now it looks so small. What is that huge\r\nbuilding beside it?'\r\n\r\n'The Hotel Cecil,' I replied.\r\n\r\nThen again he shook his head in disapproval. From an artistic standpoint\r\nhe strongly objected to the huge caravansary on which builder Hobbs and\r\npious Jabez Balfour spent so much of other people's money. Soaring\r\nmassively and pretentiously into the sky it dwarfed everything around;\r\nand thus, in his opinion, utterly spoilt that part of the Embankment.\r\n\r\n'To think, too,' said he, 'that you had such a site, here, along the\r\nriver, and allowed it to be used for hotels and clubs, and so forth.\r\nThere was room for a Louvre here, and you want one badly; for your\r\nNational Gallery, which I well remember visiting in '93, is a most\r\nwretched affair architecturally.'\r\n\r\n'But I want to see rather more of the south side of the river,' he added,\r\nafter a pause. 'I should like to ascertain if my lion is still there. I\r\nrecollect that there was some fog about on the morning after my arrival\r\nat the Savoy in '93; and when I went to the window of my room I noticed\r\nthe mist parting--one mass of vapour ascending skyward, while the other\r\nstill hovered over the river. And, in the rent between, I espied a lion,\r\npoised in mid air. It amused me vastly; and I called my wife, saying to\r\nher, \"Come and see. Here's the British lion waiting to bid us good-day.\"'\r\n\r\nWe went to the end of the bridge and thence espied the lion which\r\nsurmounts the brewery of that name. M. Zola recognised it immediately.\r\nDesmoulin would then have led us Strandward; but the Strand, said I, was\r\nabout the most dangerous thoroughfare in all London for those who wished\r\nto escape recognition; so we went back over the bridge and again down the\r\nWaterloo road.\r\n\r\n'I should like very much to send a line to Paris to-day to stop letters\r\nfrom going to the Grosvenor,' said M. Zola. 'Is there any place\r\nhereabouts where I could write a note?'\r\n\r\nThis question perplexed me, for the numerous facilities for\r\nletter-writing which are supplied by the cafes of Paris are conspicuously\r\nabsent in London; and this I explained to M. Zola. A postage stamp may\r\noften be procured at a public-house, but only now and again can one there\r\nobtain ink and paper. However, I thought we might as well try the saloon\r\nbar of the York Hotel, which abuts on the famous 'Poverty Corner,' so\r\nmuch frequented by ladies and gentlemen of the 'halls,' when, sorely\r\nagainst their inclinations, they are 'resting.'\r\n\r\nIt was Thursday afternoon; still there were several disconsolate-looking\r\nindividuals lounging about the corner; and in the saloon bar we found\r\nsome fourteen or fifteen loudly dressed men and women typical of the\r\nspot. I forget what I ordered for Desmoulin and myself, but M. Zola, I\r\nknow imbibed, mainly for the good of the house, 'a small lemon plain.'\r\nThen we ascertained that the young lady at the bar had neither stamps,\r\nnor paper, nor envelopes, and so we were again in a quandary. Fortunately\r\nI recollected a little stationer's shop in the York Road, and leaving the\r\nothers in the saloon bar, I went in search of the requisite materials.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned I found the master an object of general attention. His\r\nextremely prosperous appearance, his white billycock, his jewellery, and\r\nso forth, coupled with the circumstance that he conversed in French with\r\nDesmoulin, had led some of those present to imagine that he was a\r\nContinental music-hall director on the look out for English 'artists.'\r\n\r\nAgain and again I noticed, as it were, a 'hungry' glance in his\r\ndirection; and when, after procuring an inkstand from over the bar, I had\r\nensconced him in a corner, where he was able after a fashion to pen his\r\ncorrespondence, a vivacious and, it seemed to me, somewhat bibulous\r\ngentleman in a check suit sidled up to where I stood and introduced\r\nhimself in that easy way which repeated 'drops' of 'Mountain Dew' are apt\r\nto engender.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said he, after a few pointless remarks, 'your friend is over here\r\non business, eh? Right thing, splendid thing. It's only by looking round\r\nthat one can get real tip-top novelties. Oh! I know Paree and the\r\nbouleywards well enough. I was on at the Follee Bergey only a few years\r\nago myself. A good place that--pays well, eh? I shouldn't at all mind\r\ntaking a trip across the water again. There's nothing like a change, you\r\nknow. Sets a man up, eh?'\r\n\r\nThen mysteriously--lifting his forefinger and lowering his voice, 'Now\r\nyour friend wants \"talent,\" eh? Real, genuine \"talent\"! I could put him\r\nin the way----'\r\n\r\nBut I interposed: 'You've applied to the wrong shop,' I said by way of a\r\njoke; 'my friend has all the talent he requires. He's quite full up.'\r\n\r\nA sorrowful look came over the angular features of the gentleman in the\r\ncheck suit. 'It's like my luck,' said he; 'there was a fellow over from\r\nAmsterdam the other day, but he'd only take girls. I think the\r\nContinental line's pretty nigh played out.'\r\n\r\nHe heaved a sigh and glanced in the direction of his empty glass. Then,\r\nseeing that the novelist and Desmoulin were rising to join me, he\r\nwhispered hurriedly, _'I say, guv'nor, you haven't got a tanner you could\r\nspare, have you?'_\r\n\r\nI had foreseen the request; nevertheless I pressed a few coppers into his\r\nhand and then hurried out after my wards.\r\n\r\nThough it was still early we decided to start at once for Wimbledon. The\r\nmaster, I thought, might like to see a little of the place pending\r\nWareham's arrival.\r\n\r\nThe journey through Lambeth, Vauxhall, and Queen's Road is not calculated\r\nto give the intelligent foreigner a particularly favourable impression of\r\nLondon. Still M. Zola did not at first find the surroundings very much\r\nworse than those one observes on leaving Paris by the Northern or Eastern\r\nlines. But as the train went on and on and much the same scene appeared\r\non either hand he began to wonder when it would all end.\r\n\r\nOn approaching Clapham Junction a sea of roofs is to be seen on the right\r\nstretching away through Battersea to the Thames; while on the left a huge\r\nwave of houses ascends the acclivity known, I believe, as Lavender Hill.\r\nAnd at the sight of all the mean, dusty streets, lined with little houses\r\nof uniform pattern, each close pressed to the other--at the frequently\r\nrecurring glimpses of squalor and shabby gentility--M. Zola exploded.\r\n\r\n'It is awful!' he said.\r\n\r\nWe were alone in our compartment, and he looked first from one window and\r\nthen from the other. Next came a torrent of questions: Why were the\r\nhouses so small? Why were they all so ugly and so much alike? What\r\nclasses of people lived in them? Why were the roads so dusty? Why was\r\nthere such a litter of fragments of paper lying about everywhere? Where\r\nthose streets never watered? Was there no scavengers' service? And then a\r\nremark: 'You see that house, it looks fairly clean and neat in front. But\r\nthere! Look at the back-yard--all rubbish and poverty! One notices that\r\nagain and again!'\r\n\r\nWe passed Clapham Junction, pursuing our journey through the cutting\r\nwhich intersects Wandsworth Common. 'Well,' I said, 'you may take it\r\nthat, except as regards the postal and police services, you are now out\r\nof London proper.'\r\n\r\nPresently, indeed, we emerged from the cutting, and fields were seen on\r\neither hand. One could breathe at last. But as we approached Earlsfield\r\nStation all M. Zola's attention was given to a long row of low-lying\r\nhouses whose yards and gardens extend to the railway line. Now and again\r\na trim patch of ground was seen; here, too, there was a little\r\nglass-house, there an attempt at an arbour. But litter and rubbish were\r\nonly too often apparent.\r\n\r\n'This, I suppose,' said the novelist, 'is what you call a London slum\r\ninvading the country? You tell me that only a part of the bourgeoisie\r\ncares for flats, and that among the lower middle class and the working\r\nclass each family prefers to rent its own little house. Is this for the\r\nsake of privacy? If so, I see no privacy here. Leaving out the question\r\nof being overlooked from passing trains, observe the open four-foot\r\nfences which separate one garden or yard from the other. There is no\r\nprivacy at all! To me the manner in which your poorer classes are housed\r\nin the suburbs, packed closely together in flimsy buildings, where every\r\nsound can be heard, suggests a form of socialism--communism, or perhaps\r\nrather the phalansterian system.'\r\n\r\nBut Earlsfield was already passed, and we were reaching Wimbledon. Here\r\nM. Zola's impressions changed. True, he did not have occasion to\r\nperambulate what he would doubtless have called the 'phalansterian'\r\nstreets of new South Wimbledon. I spared him the sight of the chess-board\r\nof bricks and mortar into which the speculative builder has turned acre\r\nafter acre north of Merton High Street. But the Hill Road, the Broadway,\r\nthe Worple Road, and the various turnings that climb towards the Ridgeway\r\npleased him. And he commented very favourably on the shops in the\r\nBroadway and the Hill Road, which in the waning sunshine still looked gay\r\nand bright. At every moment he stopped to examine something. Such\r\ndisplays of fruit, and fish, poultry, meat, and provisions of all kinds;\r\nthe drapers' windows all aglow with summer fabrics, and those of the\r\njewellers coruscating with gold and gems. Then the public-houses\r\n--dignified by the name of hotels, though I explained that they had\r\nno hotel accommodation--bespoke all the wealth of a powerful trade.\r\n\r\nThere was an imposing bank, too, and a stylish carriage builder's, with\r\nfurniture shops, stationers, pastrycooks, hairdressers, ironmongers, and\r\nso forth, whose displays testified to the prosperity of the town. Again\r\nand again did M. Zola express the opinion that these Wimbledon shops were\r\nby far superior to such as one would find in a French town of\r\ncorresponding size and at a similar distance from the capital.\r\n\r\nWe sauntered up and down the Hill Road, looking in at the Free Library on\r\nour way. Then, on passing the Alexandra Road, I explained to Desmoulin\r\nthat he would sleep there, at No. 20, where Wareham has a local office\r\nand where his managing clerk, Everson by name, resides.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement with Wareham had been concluded so precipitately that, to\r\nspare him unnecessary trouble at home, we had arranged to dine that\r\nevening at a local restaurant--in fact, the only restaurant possessed by\r\nWimbledon. Wareham was to join us there. The proprietor, Mr. Genoni, is\r\nof foreign origin, but Wareham knowing him personally had assured me that\r\neven should he suspect our friend's identity his discretion might readily\r\nbe relied upon. And so the sequel proved. During our repast, however, I\r\nfelt a little doubtful about one of the waiters who know French, and I\r\ntherefore cautioned M. Zola and M. Desmoulin to be as reticent as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we adjourned to Wareham's house in Prince's Road, where Mrs.\r\nWareham gave the travellers the most cordial of welcomes. The\r\nconversation was chiefly confined to the question of finding some\r\nsuitable place where M. Zola might settle down for his term of exile. He,\r\nhimself, was so taken with what he had seen of Wimbledon that he\r\nsuggested renting a furnished house there. This seemed a trifle\r\ndangerous, both to Wareham and myself; but the novelist was not to be\r\ngainsaid; and as Wareham, in anticipation of his services being required,\r\nhad made special arrangements to give M. Zola most of his time on the\r\nmorrow, we arranged to see some house agents, engage a landau, and drive\r\nround to visit such places as might seem suitable.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly half-past eleven when I left Wareham's to escort Desmoulin\r\nto the Alexandra Road. I there left him in charge of his host, Mr.\r\nEverson, and then turning (by way of a short cut) into the Lover's Walk,\r\nwhich the South Western Railway Company so considerately provides for\r\namorous Wimbledonians, I hurried homeward, wondering what the morrow\r\nwould bring forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\n                        WIMBLEDON--OATLANDS\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious to all readers of this narrative that from the moment\r\nM. Zola left Paris, and throughout his sojourn in London and its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, there was little if any skill shown in the\r\nmatter of keeping his movements secret. In point of fact, blunder upon\r\nblunder was committed. A first mistake was made in going to an hotel like\r\nthe Grosvenor; a second in openly promenading some of the most frequented\r\nof the London streets; and a third in declining to make the slightest\r\nalteration with regard to personal appearance. Again, although press of\r\ncircumstances rendered departure for Wimbledon a necessity, as it was\r\nimperative to get M. Zola out of London at once, this change of quarters\r\nwas in the end scarcely conducive to secrecy. A good many Wimbledonians\r\nwere aware of my connection with M. Zola, and even if he were not\r\npersonally recognised by them, the circumstance of a French gentleman of\r\nstriking appearance being seen in my company was fated to arouse\r\nsuspicion. My home is but a mile or so from the centre of Wimbledon, and\r\nM. Zola's proposal to make that locality his place of sojourn seemed to\r\nme such a dangerous course that when I returned to Wareham's house on the\r\nmorning of Friday, July 22, I was determined to oppose it, in the\r\nmaster's own interests, as vigorously as might be possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, I found Messrs. Zola and Desmoulin ready to start for an\r\ninspection of such furnished houses as might seem suitable for their\r\naccommodation; and nothing urged either by Wareham or by myself could\r\nturn them from their purpose. So the four of us took our seats in the\r\nlandau which had been ordered, and were soon driving in the direction of\r\nWimbledon Park, where stood the first of the eligible residences entered\r\nin the books of a local house agent. The terms for these houses varied,\r\nif I recollect rightly, from four to seven guineas a week. Some we did\r\nnot trouble to enter; others, however, were carefully inspected.\r\n\r\nNothing in the way of a terrace house would suit; for M. Zola was not yet\r\na phalansterian. And in like way he objected to the semi-detached villas.\r\nHe wished to secure a somewhat retired place, girt with foliage and thus\r\nscreened from the observation of neighbours and passers-by. The low\r\ngarden railings and fences usually met with were by no means to his\r\ntaste. The flimsy party walls of the semi-detached villas, through which\r\nevery sound so swiftly passes, were equally objectionable to him. And I\r\nmust say that I viewed with some little satisfaction his dislike for\r\nseveral of the houses which we visited; for this made it easier to\r\ndissuade him from his plan of fixing his abode in Wimbledon, where,\r\nunless he should rigidly confine himself within doors, it was certain\r\nthat his presence would be known before a week was over.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, some houses which the master found to his liking;\r\nand here he lingered awhile, inspecting the rooms, taking stock of the\r\nfurniture, examining the engravings and water-colours on the walls, and\r\nviewing the trim gardens with visible satisfaction. One place, a large\r\nhouse in one of the precipitous roads leading from the Ridgeway to the\r\nWorple Road, was, perhaps, rather too open for his requirements, but its\r\nappointments were perfect, and at his bidding I plied the lady of the\r\nhouse with innumerable questions about plate, linen, and garden produce,\r\nthe servants she offered to leave behind her, and so forth. She was a\r\ntall and stately dame, with silver hair and a soft musical voice--a\r\nperfect type of the old marquise, such as one sees portrayed at times on\r\nthe boards of the Comedie Francaise, and after I had acted as interpreter\r\nfor a quarter of an hour or so, she suddenly turned upon the master and,\r\nto the surprise of all of us, addressed him in perfect French. It was\r\nthis which broke the spell. Though M. Zola was taken aback, he responded\r\npolitely enough, and the conversation went on in French for some minutes,\r\nbut I could already tell that he had renounced his intention of renting\r\nthe house. When we drove away, after promising the lady a decisive answer\r\nwithin a day or two, he said to me:\r\n\r\n'That would never do. The lady's French was too good. She looked at me\r\nrather suspiciously too. She would soon discover my identity. She has\r\nprobably heard of me already.'\r\n\r\n'Who hasn't?' I responded with a laugh. And once again I brought forward\r\nthe objections that occurred to me with respect to the plan of remaining\r\nat Wimbledon. It was a centre of Roman Catholic activity. There was a\r\nJesuit college there, numbering both French professors and French pupils.\r\nMoreover, several French families resided in Wimbledon, and with some of\r\nthem I was myself acquainted. Then also the population included a good\r\nmany literary men, journalists, and others who took an interest in the\r\nDreyfus case. And, finally, the town was far too near to London to be in\r\nanywise a safe hiding-place.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, M. Zola only abandoned his intentions with regret. In that\r\nbright sunshiny weather there was an attractive _je ne sais quoi_ about\r\nWimbledon which charmed him. Not that it was in his estimation an ideal\r\nplace. The descents from the hill and the Ridgeway (though he admired the\r\nbeautiful views they afforded, stretching as far as Norwood) appalled him\r\nfrom certain practical standpoints, and he was never weary of expatiating\r\non the pluck of the girls who cycled so boldly and gracefully from the\r\nhill crest to the lower parts of the town. Here it may be mentioned that\r\nM. Zola has become reconciled to the skirt as a cycling garment. Once\r\nupon a time he was an uncompromising partisan of 'rationals' and\r\n'bloomers,' a warm adherent of the views which Lady Harberton and her\r\nfriends uphold. But sojourn in England has changed all that--at least so\r\nfar as the English type of girl is concerned. Those who have read his\r\nnovel, 'Paris,' may remember that he therein ascribed the following\r\nremarks to his heroine--Marie: 'Ah! there is nothing like rationals! To\r\nthink that some women are so foolish and obstinate as to wear skirts when\r\nthey cycle! . . . To think that women have a unique opportunity of\r\nputting themselves at their ease and releasing their limbs from prison,\r\nand yet won't do so! If they fancy they look the prettier in short\r\nskirts, like schoolgirls, they are vastly mistaken. . . . Skirts are rank\r\nheresy.'\r\n\r\nWell, so far as Englishwomen are concerned, M. Zola himself has become a\r\nheretic. 'Rationals,' he has more than once said to me of recent times,\r\n'are not suited to the lithe and somewhat spare figure of the average\r\nEnglish girl. Moreover, I doubt if there is a costumier in England who\r\nknows how to cut \"rationals\" properly. Such women as I have seen in\r\nrationals in England looked to me horrible. They had not the proper\r\nfigure for the garment, and the garment itself was badly made. For\r\nrationals to suit a woman, her figure should be of the happy medium,\r\nneither too slim nor over-developed. Now the great bulk of your girls are\r\nextremely slim, and appear in skirts to advantage. In cycling, moreover,\r\nthey carry themselves much better than the majority of Frenchwomen do.\r\nThey sit their machines gracefully, and the skirt, instead of being a\r\nmere bundle of stuff, falls evenly and fittingly like a necessary\r\nadjunct--the drapery which is needed to complete and set off the\r\nensemble.'\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the master does not cry 'haro' on the 'bloomer.' It is\r\nadmirably suited, he maintains, to the average Frenchwoman, who is more\r\ninclined to a reasonable plumpness than her English sister. 'The skirt to\r\nEngland,' says he, 'the bloomer to France.' The whole question is one of\r\nphysique and latitude. The Esquimaux lady would look ungainly and feel\r\nuncomfortable if she exchanged her moose furs for the wisp of calico\r\nwhich is patronised by the lady of Senegal; and in the like way the\r\nEnglishwoman is manifestly ungainly and uncomfortable when she borrows\r\nthe breeches of the Parisienne.\r\n\r\nThis digression may seem to carry one away from Wimbledon, but I should\r\nmention that many of the points enunciated were touched upon by M. Zola\r\nfor the first time, while we postponed further house-hunting to drive\r\nover Wimbledon Common. The historic mill and Caesar's Camp, and the\r\npicturesque meres were all viewed before the horses' heads were turned to\r\nthe town once more.\r\n\r\nBy this time the master had come to the conclusion that however pleasant\r\nWimbledon might be, it was no fit place for him, and that his best course\r\nwould be to pitch his tent 'far from gay cities and the ways of men.'\r\nWithin a few hours I had some proof of the wisdom of his decision, and a\r\nweek had not elapsed before I found that M. Zola's sojourn at Wimbledon\r\nhad become known to a variety of people. Mr. Genoni, the restaurateur,\r\nhad been one of the first to identify him; but, as he explained to me, he\r\nwas no spy or betrayer, and whatever he might think of the Dreyfus\r\nbusiness--he was a reader of that anti-Revisionist print the 'Petit\r\nJournal'--M. Zola's secret was, he assured me, quite safe in his hands.\r\nBut, independently of Mr. Genoni, the secret soon became _le secret de\r\nPolichinelle_. A French resident in Wimbledon recognised M. Zola as he\r\nstood one day by the railway bridge admiring some fair cyclists. Then a\r\ngentleman connected with the local Petty Sessions court espied him in my\r\ncompany, and shrewdly guessed his identity. Subsequently a local\r\nhairdresser, an Englishman, but one well acquainted with Paris and\r\nParisian matters, 'spotted' him in the Hill Road. Others followed suit,\r\nand at last one afternoon a member of the 'Globe' staff called upon me\r\nand supplied me with such circumstantial particulars that I could not\r\npossibly deny the accuracy of his information. But M. Zola had then left\r\nWimbledon, and thus I was able to fence with my visitor and inform him\r\nthat, even if the novelist had ever been in the town, he was not there at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that some of the leading London house agents should\r\nbe written to, with the view of securing some secluded country house,\r\npreferably in Surrey, and on the South Western line; but the question\r\nwas, where, in the meantime, could M. Zola be conveniently installed?\r\nHaving left England in the year 1865, and apart from a few brief sojourns\r\nin London, having remained abroad till 1886, my knowledge of my native\r\nland is very slight indeed. Years spent in foreign countries have made me\r\na stay-at-home--one who nowadays buries himself in his little London\r\nsuburb, going to town as seldom as possible, and without need of country\r\nor seaside trip, since at Merton, where I live, there are green fields\r\nall around one and every vivifying breeze that can be wished for. Thus I\r\nwas the worst person in the world to take charge of M. Zola and pilot him\r\nsafely to a haven of refuge.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Mr. Wareham knows his way about, as the saying goes, and his\r\ncycling experience proved very useful. He suggested that until a house\r\ncould be secured, M. Zola should be installed at a country hotel; and he\r\nmentioned two or three places which seemed to him of the right character.\r\nOne of these was Oatlands Park; and Wareham, who, although a solicitor,\r\nclaims to have some little poetry in his nature, waxed so enthusiastic\r\nover the charms of Oatlands and neighbouring localities, that both M.\r\nZola and M. Desmoulin, fervent admirers of scenery as they are, became\r\ncurious to visit this leafy district of Surrey, where, as will be\r\nremembered, King Louis Philippe spent his last years of life and exile.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, then, I started with Messrs. Zola and Desmoulin for\r\nWalton, from which station the Oatlands Park Hotel is most conveniently\r\nreached. A Gladstone bag had now replaced the master's newspaper parcel,\r\nand as M. Desmoulin's dressing-case was as large as a valise, there was\r\nat least some semblance of luggage. I fully realised that it was hardly\r\nthe correct thing to present oneself at Oatlands Park and ask for rooms\r\nthere _ex abrupto_; as with hostelries of that class it is usual for one\r\nto write and secure accommodation beforehand. However, there was no time\r\nfor this; and we decided to run the risk of finding the hotel 'full up,'\r\nparticularly as Wareham had informed us that in such a case we might\r\nsecure a temporary billet at one or another of the smaller hotels of\r\nWalton or Weybridge. Thus we went our way at all hazards, and during the\r\njourney I devised a little story for the benefit of the manager at\r\nOatlands Park.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman, as I had surmised, was a trifle astonished at our\r\nappearance. But I told him that my friends were a couple of French\r\nartists, who had been spending a few weeks in London 'doing the lions'\r\nthere, and who had heard of the charming scenery around Oatlands, and\r\nwished to view it, and possibly make a few sketches. And, at the same\r\ntime, a solicitor's recommendation being of some value, since it might\r\nmean a good many future customers, I handed the manager one of Wareham's\r\ncards. There was, I remember, some little difficulty at first in\r\nobtaining rooms, for the hotel was nearly full; but everything ended\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nI may mention, perhaps, that in describing Messrs. Zola and Desmoulin as\r\nFrench artists, I had at least told half the truth. M. Fernand Desmoulin\r\nis, of course, well known in the French art world; and, moreover, he had\r\nalready spoken to me of purchasing a water-colour outfit for the very\r\npurpose of sketching, as I had stated. Then, too, M. Zola first\r\ndistinguished himself in literature as an art critic, the defender of\r\nManet, the champion of the school of the 'open air.' And if he made no\r\nsketches whilst he remained at Oatlands he at least took several\r\nphotographs. Sapient critics will stop me here with the oft-repeated\r\ndictum that photography is not art. But however that may be, so many\r\npainters nowadays have recourse to the assistance of photography that M.\r\nZola's 'snap-shotting' largely helped to bear out the account which I had\r\ngiven of him at the hotel.\r\n\r\nOatlands Park is a large pile standing on the site of a magnificent\r\npalace built by Henry VIII. Anne of Denmark, wife of James I., resided\r\nthere, and Henrietta Maria there gave birth to the Duke of Gloucester,\r\nthe brother of our second Charles and second James. The palace was almost\r\nentirely destroyed during the Civil Wars, and subsequently the property\r\npassed in turn to Jermyn, Earl of St. Albans; Herbert, the admiral, first\r\nEarl of Torrington; and Henry, seventh Earl of Lincoln. A descendant of\r\nthe last-named sold the estate to Frederick, Duke of York, the son of\r\nGeorge III. and Commander-in-Chief of the British army. Soon afterwards\r\nthe house at Oatlands was destroyed by fire, and the prince erected a new\r\nbuilding, some portions of which are incorporated in the present\r\nhostelry. A pathetic interest attaches to those remains of York House.\r\nWithin those walls were spent many of the honeymoon hours of a fair and\r\nvirtuous princess, one whose early death plunged England into the deepest\r\ngrief it had known for centuries; there she conceived the child who in\r\nthe ordinary course of nature might have become King of Great Britain.\r\nBut the babe, so anxiously awaited by the whole nation (there was no\r\nPrincess Victoria at that time) proved stillborn; and of the unhappy\r\n'mother of the moment,' Byron wrote in immortal lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Of sackcloth was thy wedding garment made;\r\n       Thy bridal's fruit is ashes; in the dust\r\n     The fair-hair'd Daughter of the Isles is laid,\r\n     The love of millions!\r\n\r\n\r\nI am bound to add that the tragic story of the Princess Charlotte was not\r\nthat which most appealed to M. Zola's feelings at Oatlands Park. Nor was\r\nhe particularly impressed by the far-famed grotto which the hotel\r\nhandbook states 'has no parallel in the world.' The grotto, an artificial\r\naffair, the creation of which is due to a Duke of Newcastle, whom it cost\r\n40,000 pounds, besides giving employment to three men for twenty years,\r\nconsists of numerous chambers and passages, whose walls are inlaid with\r\ncoloured spars, shells, coral, ammonites, and crystals. This work is\r\ningenious enough, but when one enters a bath-room and finds a stuffed\r\nalligator there, keeping company with a statue of Venus and a terra-cotta\r\nof the infant Hercules, one is apt to remember how perilously near the\r\nridiculous is to the sublime.\r\n\r\nRidiculous also to some minds may seem the Duchess of York's dog and\r\nmonkey cemetery, in which half a hundred of that lady's canine and simian\r\npets lie buried with headstones to their tombs commemorating their\r\nvirtues. This cemetery, however, greatly commended itself to M. Zola,\r\nwho, as some may know, is a rare lover of animals. Among the various\r\ndistinctions accorded to him in happier times by his compatriots there is\r\nnone that he has ever prized more highly than the diploma of honour he\r\nreceived from the French 'Society for the Protection of Animals,' and I\r\nbelieve that one of the happiest moments he ever knew was when, as\r\nGovernment delegate at a meeting of that society, he fastened a gold\r\nmedal on the bosom of a blushing little shepherdess, a certain Mlle.\r\nCamelin, of Trionne, in Upper Burgundy, a girl of sixteen, who, at the\r\nperil of her life, had engaged a ravenous wolf in single combat, killed\r\nhim, and thereby saved her flock.\r\n\r\nAnd M. Zola's books teem with his love of animals. During his long exile\r\none of the few requests addressed to him from France, to which he\r\ninclined a favourable ear, was an appeal on behalf of a new journal\r\ndevoted to the interests of the animal world. To this he could not refuse\r\nhis patronage, and he gave it enthusiastically, well knowing how much\r\nremains to be accomplished in inculcating among the masses such affection\r\nand patience as are rightful with regard to those dumb creatures who\r\nserve man so well.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of York's cemetery reminded him of his own. Below his house\r\nat Medan a green islet rises from the Seine. This he purchased some years\r\nago, and there all his favourites have since been buried: an old horse, a\r\ngoat, and several dogs. During his exile a fresh interment took place in\r\nthis island cemetery, that of his last canine favourite, the poor\r\n'Chevalier de Perlinpinpin,' who, after vainly fretting for his absent\r\nmaster, died at last of sheer grief and loneliness. Those only can\r\nunderstand Emile Zola who have seen him as I saw him then, bowed down\r\nwith sorrow, distraught, indifferent to all else, both the weightiest\r\npersonal interests and the very triumph of the cause he had championed;\r\nand this because his pet dog had pined away for him, and was beyond all\r\npossibility of succour. It was of course a passing weakness with him;\r\nsuch weakness as may fall upon a man of kindly heart. In Zola's case it\r\ncame, however, almost like a last blow amidst the sorrow and loneliness\r\nof the exile which he was enduring in silence for the sake of his\r\nmuch-loved country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VI\r\n\r\n                         STILL AT OATLANDS\r\n\r\nFor a time, at all events, Messrs. Zola and Desmoulin found themselves in\r\nfairly pleasant quarters; they could stroll about the gardens at Oatlands\r\nor along the umbrageous roads of Walton, or beside the pretty reaches of\r\nthe Thames, amidst all desirable quietude. After all his worries the\r\nmaster needed complete mental rest, and he laughed at his friend's\r\nrepeated appeals for newspapers.\r\n\r\nAt that period I procured a few French journals every time I went to town\r\nand posted them to Oatlands, where they were eagerly conned by M.\r\nDesmoulin, on whom the Dreyfus fever was as strong as ever. But M. Zola\r\nduring the first fortnight of his exile did not once cast eyes upon a\r\nnewspaper, and the only information he obtained respecting passing events\r\nwas such as Desmoulin or myself imparted to him. And in this he evinced\r\nlittle interest. Half of it, he said, was absolutely untrue, and the\r\nother half was of no importance. There is certainly much force and truth\r\nin this curtly-worded opinion as applied to the contents of certain Paris\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nHowever, communications were now being opened up between the master and\r\nhis Paris friends, and every few days Wareham or myself had occasion to\r\ngo to Oatlands. There were sundry false alarms, too, through strangers\r\ncalling at Wareham's office, and now and again my sudden appearance at\r\nthe hotel threw Messrs. Zola and Desmoulin into anxiety. In other\r\nrespects their life was quiet enough. The people staying at Oatlands\r\nwere, on the whole, a much less inquisitive class than those whom one had\r\nfound at the Grosvenor. There were various honeymoon-making couples, who\r\nwere far too busy feasting their eyes on one another to pay much\r\nattention to two French artists. Then, also, the family people gave time\r\nto the superintendence of their sons and daughters; whilst the old folks\r\nonly seemed to care for a leisurely stroll about the grounds, followed by\r\nlong spells of book or newspaper reading, under the shelter of tree or\r\nsunshade.\r\n\r\nMoreover the exiles saw little of the other inmates of the hotel,\r\nexcepting at the table d'hote dinner. M. Zola then brought his faculties\r\nof observation into play, and after a lapse of a few days he informed me\r\nthat he was astonished at the ease and frequency with which some English\r\ngirls raised their wine-glasses to their lips. It upset all his idea of\r\npropriety to see young ladies of eighteen tossing off their Moselle and\r\ntheir champagne as to the manner born. In France the daughter who is\r\nproperly trained contents herself with water just coloured by the\r\naddition of a little Bordeaux or Burgundy. And the contrast between this\r\ncustom and incidents which M. Zola noticed at Oatlands--and to which he\r\nonce or twice called my attention--made a deep impression on him.\r\n\r\nThe people staying at the hotel were certainly all of a good class. There\r\nwere several well-known names in the register; and knowing how much has\r\nbeen written on the happy decrease of drinking habits 'in the upper\r\nmiddle-class of England,' I was myself slightly surprised at what was\r\npointed out to me. When M. Zola discovered, too, that sundry\r\ngentlemen--leaving wine to their wives and daughters--were addicted to\r\ndrinking whisky with their meals, he was yet more astonished, for he\r\nclaims that in France nowadays, greatly as the consumption of alcohol has\r\nincreased among the masses, it has declined almost to vanishing point\r\namong people with any claim to culture. On this matter, however, I\r\nreminded him that wine was often expensive in England, that beer\r\ndisagreed with many people, and that some who felt the need of a\r\nstimulant were thus driven to whisky and water.\r\n\r\nWhen the master and Desmoulin wandered down to the Thames towing-path,\r\nthey found fresh food for observation and comment among the boating\r\nfraternity. With some gay parties were damsels whose disregard for\r\ndecorum was strongly reminiscent of Asnieres and Joinville-le-Pont; and\r\nit was slightly embarrassing to stroll near the river in the evening,\r\nwhen at every few yards one found young couples exchanging kisses in the\r\nshadows of the trees. After all it was surprise rather than embarrassment\r\nwhich the exiles experienced, for they had scarcely imagined that English\r\ntraining was conducive to such public endearments.\r\n\r\nAt a later stage a bicycle was procured for the master, and he was then\r\nable to extend his sphere of observation; but in the earlier days at\r\nOatlands his rambles were confined to the vicinity of Walton and\r\nWeybridge. At the latter village he laid in a fresh stock of linen, and\r\nwas soon complaining of the exiguous proportions of English shirts. The\r\nFrenchman, it should be remembered, is a man of many gestures, and\r\ndesires all possible freedom of action for his arms. His shirt is cut\r\naccordingly, and a superabundance rather than a deficiency of material in\r\nlength as well as breadth is the result. But the English shirt-maker\r\nproceeds upon different lines; he always seems afraid of wasting a few\r\ninches of longcloth, and thus if the ordinary ready-made shirt on sale at\r\nshops of the average class is dressy-looking enough, it is also often\r\nsupremely uncomfortable to those who like their ease. Such, at least, was\r\nthe master's experience; and in certain respects, said he, the English\r\nshirt was not only uncomfortable, but indecorous as well. This astonished\r\nhim with a nation which claimed to show so much regard for the\r\nproprieties.\r\n\r\nThe desire to clothe himself according to his wont became so keen that M.\r\nDesmoulin decided to make an expedition to Paris. All this time Mme. Zola\r\nhad remained alone at the house in the Rue de Bruxelles, outside which,\r\nas at Medan (where the Zolas have their country residence), detectives\r\nwere permanently stationed. Mme. Zola was shadowed wherever she went, the\r\nidea, of course, being that she would promptly follow her husband abroad.\r\nShe had, however, ample duties to discharge in Paris. At the same time\r\nshe much wished to send her husband a trunkful of clothes as well as the\r\nmaterials for a new book he had planned, in order that he might have some\r\noccupation in his sorrow and loneliness.\r\n\r\nMost people are by this time aware that M. Zola's gospel is work. In\r\ndiligent study and composition he finds some measure of solace for every\r\ntrouble. At times it is hard for him to take up the pen, but he forces\r\nhimself to do so, and an hour later he has largely banished sorrow and\r\nanxiety, and at times has even dulled physical pain. He himself, heavy\r\nhearted as he was when the first novelty of his strolls around Oatlands\r\nhad worn off, felt that he must have something to do, and was therefore\r\nwell pleased at the prospect of receiving the materials for his new book,\r\n'Fecondite.'\r\n\r\nAt that date he certainly did not imagine that the whole of this work\r\nwould be written in England, that his exile would drag on month after\r\nmonth till winter would come and spring return, followed once more by\r\nsummer. In those days we used to say: 'It will all be over in a\r\nfortnight, or three weeks, or a month at the latest;' and again and again\r\ndid our hopes alternately collapse and revive. Thus the few chapters of\r\n'Fecondite,' which he thought he might be able to pen in England,\r\nmultiplied and multiplied till they at last became thirty--the entire\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIt was M. Desmoulin who brought the necessary materials--memoranda,\r\ncuttings, and a score of scientific works--from Paris. And at the same\r\ntime he had a trunk with him full of clothes which had been smuggled in\r\nsmall parcels out of M. Zola's house, carried to the residence of a\r\nfriend, and there properly packed. Desmoulin also brought a hand camera,\r\nwhich likewise proved very acceptable to the master, and enabled him to\r\ntake many little photographs--almost a complete pictorial record of his\r\nEnglish experiences.\r\n\r\nDuring Desmoulin's absence the master remained virtually alone at\r\nOatlands, and as he still cared nothing for newspapers I sent him a few\r\nbooks from my shelves, and, among others, Stendhal's 'La Chartreuse de\r\nParme.' He wrote me afterwards; 'I am very grateful to you for the books\r\nyou sent. Now that I am utterly alone they enabled me to spend a pleasant\r\nday yesterday. I am reading \"La Chartreuse.\" I am without news from\r\nFrance. If you hear of anything really serious pray let me know about\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nBy this time proper arrangements had been made with regard to M. Zola's\r\ncorrespondence. His exact whereabouts were kept absolutely secret even\r\nfrom his most intimate friends. Everybody, his wife and Maitre Labori\r\nalso, addressed their letters to Wareham's office in Bishopsgate Street.\r\nHere the correspondence was enclosed in a large envelope and redirected\r\nto Oatlands. With regard to visitors Wareham and I had decided to give\r\nthe master's address to none. Wareham intended to take their cards,\r\nascertain their London address, and then refer the matter through me to\r\nM. Zola. Later on, a regular supply of French newspapers was arranged,\r\nand those journals were re-transmitted to the master by Wareham or\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I usually addressed M. Zola's letters for him to the\r\nhouse of a trusty friend in Paris. This precaution was a necessary one,\r\nas M. Zola's handwriting is so extremely characteristic and so well known\r\nin France. And thus we were convinced that any letter arriving in Paris\r\naddressed by him would immediately be sent to the 'Cabinet Noir,' where\r\nall suspicious correspondence is opened by certain officials, who\r\nimmediately report the contents to the Government.\r\n\r\nIt has been pretended that of recent years this secret service has been\r\nabolished; but such is by no means the case. It flourishes to-day in the\r\nsame way as it flourished under the Second Empire, when Napoleon III.\r\nmade a point of acquainting himself with the private correspondence of\r\nhis own relatives, his ministers, and his generals. After the revolution\r\nof September 1870, hundreds of copies of more or less compromising\r\nletters, covert attacks on or criticisms of the Imperial Government,\r\n_billets-doux_ also between Imperial princes and their mistresses, and so\r\nforth, were found at the Palace of the Tuilleries; and some of them were\r\neven published by a commission nominated by the Republican Government.\r\n\r\nMuch of the same kind of thing goes on to-day, and M. Zola, when in Paris\r\nduring the earlier stages of the Dreyfus case, had made it a point to\r\ntrust no letter of the slightest importance to the Postal Service. On one\r\noccasion, a short time after his arrival in England, we had reason to\r\nfear that a letter addressed by me to Paris had gone astray, and all\r\ncorrespondence on M. Zola's side was thereupon suspended for several\r\ndays. However, the missing letter turned up at last, and from that time\r\ntill the conclusion of the master's exile the arrangements devised\r\nbetween him, Wareham, and myself worked without a hitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                VII\r\n\r\n                       EXCURSIONS AND ALARUMS\r\n\r\nAlready at the time of M. Zola's arrival in London I had received a\r\nsummons to serve upon the jury at the July Sessions of the Central\r\nCriminal court. I had been excused from service on a previous occasion,\r\nbut this time I had no valid excuse to offer, and it followed that I must\r\neither serve or else pay such a fine as the Common Serjeant might direct.\r\nThere is always a certain element of doubt in these matters; and while I\r\nmight perhaps luckily escape service after a day or two, on the other\r\nhand, I might be kept at the Old Bailey for more than a week. At any\r\nother time I should have accepted my fate without a murmur; but I was\r\ngreatly worried as to what might befall M. Zola during my absence in\r\nLondon, and I more than once thought of defaulting and 'paying up.' But\r\nthe master would not hear of it. He was now located at Oatlands, and felt\r\nsure that he would have no trouble there. Moreover, said he, it would\r\nalways be possible for me to run down now and again of an evening, dine\r\nwith him, and attend to such little matters as might require my help.\r\n\r\nSo, on the Monday morning when the sessions opened, I duly repaired to\r\ntown; and on the journey up, I saw in the 'Daily Chronicle' the\r\nannouncement of M. Zola's recent presence at the Grosvenor Hotel. This\r\ngave me quite a shock. So the Press was on the right track at last!\r\nStarting from the Grosvenor Hotel, might not the reporters trace the\r\nmaster to Wimbledon, and thence to his present retreat? I had no time for\r\nhesitation. My instructions, moreover, were imperative. For the benefit\r\nof M. Zola personally, and for the benefit of the whole Dreyfus cause, I\r\nhad orders to deny everything. So I drove to the Press Association\r\noffices, sent up a contradiction of the 'Daily Chronicle's' statement,\r\nand then hurried up Ludgate Hill to the Court, where my name was soon\r\nafterwards called.\r\n\r\nI found myself on the second or third jury got together, and that day I\r\nwas not empanelled. But on the morrow I was required to do duty; and\r\nbetween then and the latter part of the week I sat upon four or five\r\ncases--all crimes of violence, and one described in the indictment as\r\nmurder. This position was the more unpleasant for me, as I am, by strong\r\nconviction, an adversary of capital punishment. I absolutely deny the\r\nright of society to put any man or any woman to death, whatever be his or\r\nher crime. My proper course then seemed to lie in the direction of a\r\npublic statement, which would have created, I suppose, some little\r\nsensation or scandal; but happily the prosecuting counsel in his very\r\nfirst words abandoned the count of murder for that of manslaughter, and I\r\nwas thereby relieved from my predicament.\r\n\r\nThe cases on which I sat, and those to which I listened while I remained\r\nin attendance, need not be particularised. I will merely mention that\r\nthey were nearly all due to drink. Mr. Justice Lawrance, who sat upon the\r\nbench, was visibly impressed by the circumstance, to which he more than\r\nonce alluded in his summings up. In one case he was so good as to refer\r\nto a question, put by me from the jury box, as a proper and pertinent\r\none, at which I naturally felt vastly complimented. On the second or\r\nthird day, either before the proceedings began or when the Court rose for\r\nluncheon--I do not exactly remember which--a gentleman approached me, and\r\nintroduced himself as a member of the Press. Said he, 'I have been asking\r\nMr. Avory for you. You are Mr. Vizetelly, I believe?'\r\n\r\n'That is my name,' I answered.\r\n\r\n'Well, I have come to speak to you about M. Zola's presence in England.'\r\n\r\nI should here mention that, in spite of my contradiction of the\r\n'Chronicle' story, there remained some people who had reason to believe\r\nit. Moreover, it had been more or less confirmed by the 'Morning Leader,'\r\nand some editors, rightly surmising that if M. Zola were in London he\r\nwould very likely be in communication with his usual translator, had\r\ndespatched reporters to my house, where my wife had seen them. On\r\nlearning that I was quietly during jury service at the Old Bailey, some\r\nhad apparently concluded that I was not concerned in M. Zola's movements,\r\nwhich, so it happened, was the very conclusion I had desired them to\r\narrive at. One gentleman, however, not content with his repulse at my\r\nhouse, had followed me to the Court.\r\n\r\nI answered his inquiries with a variety of suggestions. Zola in England,\r\nand in London too! Well, we had heard that before, said I. But was it a\r\nprobable course for the novelist to take? He knew no English, and had but\r\nfew personal friends in England. His portraits, however, were in several\r\nshops and in many newspapers. And only a few years previously he had been\r\nseen by a thousand English pressmen and others. So would he not be liable\r\nto recognition almost immediately? Now, the only modern language besides\r\nFrench of which M. Zola had any knowledge was Italian. And if I were in\r\nhis place, I said, I should go to Italy--for instance, to one of the\r\nlittle towns in the North, whence, if needful, one could cross over into\r\nSwitzerland; though, of course, there was little likelihood that the\r\nItalian Government would ever surrender the distinguished writer to his\r\npersecutors.\r\n\r\nContinuing in this strain I gave my interviewer material for a very\r\nplausible article, which I remember was duly published, and which thus\r\nhelped to divert attention from the right scent.\r\n\r\nAt the week-end, having given considerable time to jury duties, I was\r\ncompelled to spend Saturday morning in London on business, and in the\r\nafternoon I allowed myself a few hours' relaxation. Reaching Wimbledon\r\nabout eight in the evening I called on Wareham, who received me with a\r\ngreat show of satisfaction; for, said he, my services had been required\r\nfor some hours past and nobody had known where I might be. That day, it\r\nseemed, just before Wareham had left his Bishopsgate Street office, he\r\nhad received a visit from a most singular-looking little Frenchman, who\r\nhad presented one of Maitre Labori's visiting cards and requested an\r\ninterview with M. Zola. Questioned as to his business, the only\r\nexplanation he would give was that he had with him a document in a sealed\r\nenvelope which he must place in M. Zola's own hands. Wareham had wired to\r\nme on the matter, but owing to my absence from home had of course\r\nreceived no reply. Then, on reaching Wimbledon, he had called on me and\r\nfound me out. And, finally, he had gone down to Oatlands and had there\r\nseen M. Zola, who had handed him a note authorising Maitre Labori's\r\nmessenger to call at the hotel on the morrow. However, the messenger and\r\nhis manners had seemed very suspicious to Wareham--as, indeed, they\r\nafterwards seemed to me--and the question arose, was he a genuine envoy,\r\nwas the writing on Maitre Labori's card perchance a forgery, and what was\r\nthe document in a sealed envelope which was to be handed to nobody but M.\r\nZola himself? Well, said I at a guess, perhaps it is a copy of the\r\nVersailles judgment, and this is simply an impudent attempt to serve it.\r\n\r\nWareham still had Zola's note in his possession, and we resolved to go to\r\ntown that evening to interview the messenger and extract from him some\r\ndecisive proof of his bona fides before allowing matters to go any\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nThe envoy's address was the Salisbury Hotel, Salisbury Court, Fleet\r\nStreet, which I thought a curious one, being in the very centre of the\r\nLondon newspaper district; and all the way up to town my suspicions of\r\nhaving to do with a 'plant' steadily increased. It was quite ten o'clock\r\nwhen we reached the hotel, and on inquiring for our party found that he\r\nhad gone to bed.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Wareham, sharply, 'he must be roused. We must see him at\r\nonce.'\r\n\r\nI spoke to the same effect, and the hotel servants looked rather\r\nsurprised. I have an idea that they fancied we had come to arrest the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes he was brought downstairs. His appearance was most\r\nunprepossessing. He was very short, with a huge head and a remarkable\r\nshock of coal-black hair. Having hastily risen from bed, he had retained\r\nhis pyjamas, but a long frock-coat hung nearly to his slippers, and in\r\none hand he carried a pair of gloves, and in the other a huge eccentric\r\nsilk hat of the true chimney-pot type. These were details, and one might\r\nhave passed them over. But the man's face was sadly against him. He had\r\nthe slyest eyes I have ever seen; that peculiar shifty glance which\r\ninvariably sets one against an individual. And thus I became more and\r\nmore convinced that we had to deal with some piece of trickery.\r\n\r\nWe entered the smoking-room where the gas was burning low. A gentleman\r\nstopping at the hotel was snoring in solitary state in one of the arm\r\nchairs. Reaching a table near a window we sat down and at once engaged in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n'I have not brought you a definite answer,' said Wareham to the envoy,\r\n'but this gentleman is in M. Zola's confidence, and wishes further proof\r\nof your bona fides before allowing you to see M. Zola.'\r\n\r\nThen I took up the tale, now in French, now in English, for the envoy\r\nspoke both languages. Who was he? I asked. Did he claim to have received\r\nLabori's card from Labori himself? What was the document in the envelope\r\nwhich he would only deliver to M. Zola in person? And he replied that he\r\nwas a diamond-broker. Did I know So-and-So and So-and-So of Hatton\r\nGarden? They knew him well, they did business with him; they could vouch\r\nfor his honorability. But no, I was not acquainted with So-and-So and\r\nSo-and-So. I never bought diamonds. Besides, it was ten o'clock on\r\nSaturday night, and the parties mentioned were certainly not at their\r\noffices for me to refer to them.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the little envoy began to speak of his family connections and\r\nhis Paris friends, mentioning various well-known names. But the proofs I\r\ndesired were not forth-coming; and when he finally admitted that he had\r\nnot received Maitre Labori's card from that gentleman himself, all my\r\nsuspicions revived. True he added that it had been given him by a\r\nwell-known Revisionist leader to whom Maitre Labori, in a moment of\r\nemergency, having nobody of his own whom he could send abroad, had handed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut what was in the envelope? That was the great question. The envoy\r\ncould or would not answer it. He knew nothing certain on that point. Then\r\nwe--Wareham and I--brought forward our heavy artillery. We could not\r\nallow a document to be handed to M. Zola under such mysterious\r\nconditions. We must see it. But no, the envoy had strict instructions to\r\nthe contrary; he could not show it to us. In that case, we rejoined, he\r\nmight take it back to Paris. He had produced no proof of any of his\r\nassertions; for all we knew he might have told us a fairy tale, and the\r\nmysterious document might simply be a copy of the much dreaded judgment\r\nof Versailles. This suggestion produced a visible impression on the\r\nlittle man, and for half an hour we sat arguing the point. Finally he\r\nbegan to compliment us: 'Oh! you guard him well!' he said. 'I shall tell\r\nthem all about it when I get back to Paris. But you do wrong to distrust\r\nme; I am honourable. I am well known in Hatton Gardens. I have done\r\nbusiness there, ten, twelve years with So-and-So and So-and-So. I speak\r\nthe truth: you may believe me.'\r\n\r\nWe shrugged our shoulders. For my part, I could not shake off the bad\r\nimpression which the envoy had made on me. The gleams of craft and\r\ntriumph which now and again I had detected in his eyes were not to my\r\nliking. Assuredly few men are responsible for any physical repulsiveness;\r\nwe cannot all be 'Belvedere' Apollos; but then the envoy was not only of\r\nthe ugly, but also the cunning-looking class. Yet a more honourable man\r\nnever breathed. He at once thrust one hand into the depths of a capacious\r\ninner pocket, produced the mysterious envelope, and opened it in our\r\npresence. It contained simply a long letter from Maitre Labori,\r\naccompanied by a document concerning the prosecution which had been\r\ninstituted with reference to the infamous articles that Ernest Judet, of\r\nthe 'Petit Journal,' had recently written, accusing Zola's father of\r\ntheft and embezzlement whilst he was a wardrobe officer in the French\r\nForeign Legion in Algeria. It was needful that Zola should see this\r\ndocument, and return it by messenger to Paris immediately.\r\n\r\nThe affair in question is still _sub judice_, and I must therefore speak\r\nof it with some reticence. But all who are interested in M. Zola's origin\r\nand career will do well to read the admirable volume written by M.\r\nJacques Dhur, and entitled 'Le Pere d'Emile Zola,' which the Societe\r\nLibre d'Edition des Gens de Lettres (30, Rue Laffitte, Paris) published a\r\nshort time ago. This will show them how strong are the presumptions that\r\nthe documents cited by Judet in proof of his abominable charges are rank\r\nforgeries--similar to those of Henry and Lemercier-Picard! In this\r\nconnection it afforded me much pleasure to be able to supply certain\r\nextracts from Francesco Zola's works at the British Museum, showing how\r\nsubsequent to the date at which the novelist's father is alleged to have\r\npurloined State money he was received with honour by King Louis-Philippe,\r\nthe Prince de Joinville, the Minister of War, and other high personages\r\nof the time--incidents which all tend to establish the falsity of the\r\naccusations by which Judet, in his venomous spite and malignity, hoped to\r\ncast opprobrium on the parentage of my dear master and friend.\r\n\r\nBut I must return to Maitre Labori's envoy. When I had seen the contents\r\nof his envelope I heartily apologised to him for the suspicions which I\r\nhad cast upon his good faith. At this he smiled more maliciously and\r\ntriumphantly than ever, and then candidly remarked: 'Well, if you have\r\ntested me, I have tested you, and I shall be able to tell all our friends\r\nin Paris that M. Zola is in safe hands.'\r\n\r\nAccording to our previous agreement we re-sealed the envelope, writing\r\nacross it that it had been opened in the presence of Wareham and myself.\r\nAnd afterwards our reconciliation also was 'sealed' over a friendly\r\nglass. Nevertheless the envoy never saw M. Zola. M. Desmoulin luckily\r\nturned up on the morrow, and, armed with a fresh note from the master,\r\npersuaded our little French friend to hand him the documents.\r\n\r\nWe left the Salisbury Hotel, Wareham and I, well pleased to find that our\r\nsuspicions had been unfounded. Nevertheless the whole conversation of the\r\nlast hour had left its mark on us; and, for my part, I was in much the\r\nsame state of mind as in the old days of the siege of Paris, when the spy\r\nmania led to so many amusing incidents. Thus, the circumstance of finding\r\ntwo persons at the corner of Salisbury Square as we left it--two persons\r\nwho were speaking in French and who eyed us very suspiciously--revived my\r\nalarm. They even followed us along Fleet Street towards the Ludgate\r\nCircus, and though we dodged them through the cavernous Ludgate Hill\r\nRailway Station, across sundry courts and past the stores of Messrs.\r\nSpiers and Pond, we again found them waiting for us on our return towards\r\nthe embankment, determined, so it seemed, to convoy us home. We hastened\r\nour steps and they hastened theirs. We loitered, they loitered also. At\r\nlast Wareham made me dive into a side street and thence into a maze of\r\ncourts, and though the others seemed bent on following us, we at last\r\nmanaged to give them the slip.\r\n\r\nI never saw these men again, but I have retained a strong suspicion that\r\nno mere question of coincidence could explain that seeming pursuit. I\r\ntake it that the individuals had come over to England on the track of the\r\nlittle French envoy; for it was after he had bidden us good-night outside\r\nthe Salisbury Hotel that they had turned to follow us. He had told us,\r\ntoo, that earlier in the evening he had spent a hour smoking and\r\nstrolling about Salisbury Court whilst anxiously awaiting Wareham's\r\narrival with his promised answer. Whether these men were French police\r\nspies, whether they were simply members of some swell mob who know that\r\nthe little gentleman with the huge head and the coal-black hair sometimes\r\njourneyed to London with a fortune in diamonds in his possession, must\r\nremain a mystery. As for Wareham and myself, when we had again reached\r\nFleet Street we hailed a passing hansom and drove away to Waterloo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                VIII\r\n\r\n                     OTHER PERSONAL ADVENTURES\r\n\r\nI had another alarm a few days later. Returning one evening by train from\r\nWaterloo, I was followed into the compartment I selected by a party of\r\nfive men, two of whom I recognised. One was the landlord of the Raynes\r\nPark Hotel, now deceased, and the other his son. Their companions proved\r\nto be Frenchmen, which somehow struck me as a curious circumstance. This\r\nwas the time when a letter addressed by me to Paris for M. Zola appeared\r\nto have gone astray, and when we were therefore rather apprehensive of\r\nsome action on the part of the French authorities. Could it be that the\r\ntwo Frenchmen who had followed me into the railway carriage in the\r\ncompany of a local licensed victualler were actually staying at Raynes\r\nPark, within half a mile of my home? And, if so, what could be their\r\npurpose?\r\n\r\nI remained silent in my corner of the carriage, pretending to read a\r\nnewspaper; but on glancing up every now and then I fancied that I\r\ndetected one or another of the Frenchmen eyeing me suspiciously. They\r\nconversed in French, either together or with the landlord's son--who\r\nspoke their language, I found--on a variety of commonplace topics until\r\nwe had passed Earlsfield and were fast approaching Wimbledon. Then, all\r\nat once, one of them inquired of the other: 'Shall we get out at\r\nWimbledon or Raynes Park?'\r\n\r\n'We'll see,' replied the other; and at the same time it seemed to me that\r\nhe darted a very expressive glance in my direction.\r\n\r\nI now began to feel rather nervous. It was my own intention to alight at\r\nWimbledon, as I had an important message from M. Zola to communicate to\r\nWareham that evening. But it now occurred to me that the best policy\r\nmight be to go straight home. If these men were French detectives, or\r\nFrench newspaper men of the anti-Dreyfusite party, who by shadowing me\r\nhoped to discover M. Zola's retreat, it would be most unwise for me to go\r\nto Wareham's. If once the latter's name and address should be ascertained\r\nby detectives, communications between M. Zola and his friends would be\r\njeopardised. On the other hand, of course, I might be mistaken with\r\nregard to the men; and before all else I ought to make sure whether they\r\nreally had any hostile intentions. So I resolved to leave the train at\r\nWimbledon, as I had originally proposed doing, and then shape my course\r\nby theirs.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the train pulled up I rose to alight, and at that same moment\r\nthe Frenchman who had said 'We'll see,' exclaimed to his companion:\r\n'Well, I think we will got out here.'\r\n\r\nI waited to hear no more. I rushed off, threw my ticket to an inspector,\r\nclimbed the steps from the platform, descended another flight into the\r\nstation-yard, hurried into the Hill Road, and did not pause until I\r\nreached the first turning on the right. This happened to be the Alexandra\r\nRoad, in which Wareham's local office is situated.\r\n\r\nThen I turned round and, sure enough, I saw the two Frenchmen, the\r\nlicensed victualler and his son, deliberately coming towards me.\r\nForthwith, under cover of a passing vehicle, I crossed the street to the\r\ncorner of St. George's Road, which offered a convenient, shady retreat.\r\nThen I awaited developments. To my great relief the party of four went\r\nstraight on up the Hill Road.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this might only be a feint, and I hesitated about going to\r\nWareham's immediately. Before anything, I had better let those suspicious\r\nFrenchmen get right away. So I retraced my steps towards the station, and\r\nentered the saloon bar of the South-Western Hotel. There I found a\r\nforeign gentleman, whether French or Italian I do not know, whom I had\r\npreviously met about Wimbledon on various occasions. A short, rather\r\nstout, and elderly man, formerly, I believe, in business in London, and\r\nnow living on his income, he had more than once spoken to me of the\r\nDreyfus case, Zola, Esterhazy, and all the others. And on this particular\r\nevening he approached me with a smile, and inquired if there were any\r\ntruth in the reports he had heard to the effect that M. Zola had lately\r\nbeen seen in Wimbledon.\r\n\r\nNervous as I was at that moment, I was about to give him a sharp reply,\r\nwhen the door of the saloon bar opened, and to my intense alarm in\r\nmarched the two Frenchmen who had already inspired me with so much\r\ndistrust. Their friends were behind them; and I could only conclude that\r\nmy movements had somehow been observed by them, and that now I was\r\nvirtually caught, like a rat in a trap.\r\n\r\nI was the more startled, too, when my foreign acquaintance (about whom I\r\nreally knew very little) abruptly quitted me to accost the new comers.\r\nBut this gave me breathing time. The door was free, and so, leaving the\r\nrefreshment I had ordered untouched, I bolted out of the house in much\r\nthe same way as a thief might have done, and ran, as if for my life,\r\nright down the Alexandra Road until I reached Wareham's office. And there\r\nI seized the knocker in a frenzy, and made such a racket as might have\r\nawakened the dead. The door suddenly opened, and I fell into the arms of\r\nEverson, Wareham's managing clerk.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!' said he. 'What is the matter? You've nearly brought the\r\nhouse down!'\r\n\r\n'Shut the door!' I replied. 'Shut the door!'\r\n\r\n'But what has happened to you?'\r\n\r\nI had seated myself on the stairs, and a full minute went by before I\r\ncould begin my story. Then I told Everson all that had befallen me. Some\r\nFrenchmen were on Zola's track; they must be the very same men who had\r\nshadowed Wareham and myself from the Salisbury Hotel some nights\r\npreviously; and now they were in Wimbledon, having heard, no doubt, that\r\nM. Zola had been seen there. Wareham must be warned of it. Every\r\nprecaution must be taken; we must remove our charge from Oatlands, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nEverson puffed away at his pipe and listened meditatively. At last he\r\nremarked, 'Well, it is a curious business if what you say is true. What\r\nwere these Frenchmen like?'\r\n\r\nForthwith I began to describe them as accurately as I could. The first\r\nlikeness I sketched must have been a faithful one, for Everson started,\r\nand exclaimed, 'And the other. Was he not so-and-so and so-and-so?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he was. But how do you know that?' I rejoined, with considerable\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n'Why, because I know who the men are! Although you saw them with Mr.\r\nSavage of the Raynes Park Hotel, it doesn't follow that they are staying\r\nat Raynes Park. As a matter of fact they live here in this very road.\r\nThey have been here I daresay, eight or nine months now. And as for being\r\ndetectives, my dear sir, they are musicians!'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean it!'\r\n\r\nI collapsed again. To think that out of a mere chain of chance\r\ncoincidences I should have forged a perfect melodramatic intrigue! To\r\nthink that I should have let my fancy run away with me in such a fashion,\r\nand have worked myself into such a state of nervousness and alarm! I\r\ncould not help feeling a trifle ashamed. 'Well,' I pleaded, 'for my part,\r\nI had never seen the men before, either in Wimbledon or elsewhere. Of\r\ncourse, I am short-sighted, and my eyes sometimes play me tricks;\r\nhowever, as you are sure--'\r\n\r\n'Sure!' repeated Everson; and again he described the men in such a way as\r\nto convince me that there was no mistake in the matter. 'Moreover,' he\r\nadded, 'I saw them go past the house this very morning when they went up\r\nto town.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' I rejoined, 'I suppose I am losing my head. Ten minutes ago I\r\ncould have sworn that those men were after me.'\r\n\r\n'Your statement that you never saw them before,' said Everson, 'does not\r\nsurprise me. As a rule they go to town every morning, and as you are\r\nseldom in Wimbledon in the evening you can't very well meet one another.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you regard me as a bit of a fool?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no. The circumstances were curious enough, and in your place I might\r\nhave drawn the same conclusions. Only I don't think I should have hurried\r\noff to a friend's house and have nearly \"knocked\" it down.'\r\n\r\nWe both laughed, and then I apologised.\r\n\r\n'As a matter of fact,' said I, 'all this is the natural outcome of\r\nevents. The beginning was long ago. I have a secret which I find haunting\r\nme when I get up in the morning; all day long it occupies my mind; at\r\nnight it clings to me and follows me through my sleep. And I grow more\r\nand more suspicious; it seems as if everybody I meet has designs upon my\r\nsecret. Every Frenchman I don't know is a detective or a process server\r\nwith a copy of the Versailles judgment in his pockets. And thus I shall\r\nsoon become a monomaniac if I do not discover some remedy. I think I\r\nshall try the shower-bath system.'\r\n\r\nThen I recalled experiences dating from long prior to M. Zola's arrival\r\nin England. First mysterious offers of important documents bearing on the\r\nDreyfus case--documents forged a la Lemercier-Picard, hawked about by\r\nadventurers who tried to dispose of them, now in Paris, now in Brussels,\r\nand now in London. Needless to say that I, like others, had rejected them\r\nwith contempt. Then had come an incident that Everson already know of: a\r\nstranger with divers aliases beseeching me for private interviews in M.\r\nZola's interest, a request which I ultimately granted, and which led to a\r\nrather curious experience. I had declined to see my correspondent alone,\r\nand had given him the address of Wareham, who had been present at the\r\ninterview. And at first the stranger, a tall and energetic looking man,\r\nwith sunburnt face and heavy moustaches, had refused to disclose his\r\nbusiness in Wareham's presence. If at last he did so, it was solely\r\nbecause I told him that before coming to any decision in the matters\r\nwhich he might have to submit to me I should certainly lay them before my\r\nsolicitor. So the result would be the same, whether he spoke out before\r\nWareham or not. And Wareham very properly added that a solicitor was, in\r\na measure, a confessor bound to observe professional secrecy.\r\n\r\nAt last the man told us his business, and it proved to be a scheme for\r\nrescuing Dreyfus from Devil's Island and carrying him to an American\r\nport. Neither Wareham nor myself was able to take the matter seriously,\r\nbut our visitor spoke with great earnestness, as though he already saw\r\nthe suggested feat accomplished. He had a ship at his disposal, and a\r\ncrew also. He gave particulars about both. If I remember rightly, the\r\nship lay at Bristol. He knew Cayenne and Devil's Island, and Royal\r\nIsland, and so forth. He was convinced of the practicability of the\r\nventure, he had weighed all the _pros_ and _cons_, and it rested with\r\nDreyfus's friends and relatives to decide whether or no he (the prisoner)\r\nshould be a free man within another six weeks.\r\n\r\nWareham laughed. He was thinking of 'Captain Kettle,' and said so. But\r\nthe would-be rescuer protested that all this was no romancing. Oh! he was\r\nnot a philanthropist, he should expect to be well paid for his services;\r\nbut the Dreyfus family was rich, and M. Zola, too, was a man of means. So\r\nsurely they would not begrudge the necessary funds to release the unhappy\r\nprisoner from bondage.\r\n\r\nBut I replied that though the Dreyfus family and M. Zola also were\r\nanxious to see Dreyfus free, they were yet more anxious to prove his\r\ninnocence. Personally I knew nothing of the Dreyfus family, and could\r\ngive no letter of introduction to any member of it, such as I was asked\r\nfor. And, as regards M. Zola, I was sufficiently acquainted with his\r\ncharacter to say that he would never join in any such enterprise. He\r\nintended to pursue his campaign by legal means alone, and it was useless\r\nto refer the matter to him.\r\n\r\nThen the interview ended rather abruptly. A French client of Wareham's\r\nhappened to call at that very moment, and was heard speaking in French in\r\nthe hall. This seemed to alarm the stranger, who ceased pressing his\r\nrequest that I should give him letters of introduction to prominent\r\nDreyfusites. He rose abruptly, saying that the time would come when we\r\nshould probably regret having refused to entertain his proposals, and\r\nhurrying past the waiting French client he ran off down the Alexandra\r\nRoad in much the same way as I myself subsequently ran off from the\r\nFrench 'detectives' who were simply harmless disciples of St. Cecilia.\r\n\r\nTo this day I do not know whether the man was a lunatic, an imposter\r\nseeking money, or an _agent provocateur_, that is, one who imagined that\r\nhe might through me inveigle M. Zola into an illegal act which would lead\r\nto prosecution and imprisonment. The last-mentioned status that I have\r\nascribed to my interviewer is by no means an impossible one, considering\r\nthe many dastardly attempts made to discredit and ruin M. Zola. And yet,\r\nsuspicious and abrupt as was the man's leave-taking when he heard French\r\nbeing spoken outside Wareham's private room (where the interview took\r\nplace), I nowadays think it more charitable to assume that he was a\r\ntrifle crazy. One thing is certain, he had come to the wrong person in\r\napplying to me to aid and abet him in the foolhardy enterprise he spoke\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I have told this anecdote in any detail; but at\r\nthe period when the incident occurred I spoke of it casually to a few\r\nfriends, to which circumstance I am inclined to attribute the earlier\r\nparagraphs which appeared in the newspapers about American schemes for\r\ndelivering Dreyfus. The person whom I saw was, I believe, a\r\nGerman-American.\r\n\r\nWell, this incident, preposterous as it may appear (but truth, remember,\r\nis quite as fantastic as fiction), had proved another link in the chain\r\nof suspicious occurrences in which I had been mixed up prior to M. Zola's\r\nexile. Other curious little incidents had followed, and thus for many\r\nmonths I had been living--even as we lived long ago in besieged Paris--in\r\ndistrust of all strangers, and the climax had come with my foolish fears\r\nrespecting a couple of French musicians. The story I have told goes\r\nagainst me, but the man who cannot tell a story against himself when he\r\nthinks it a good one can have, I think, little grit in his composition.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of my adventure with the French musicians I steeled myself\r\nagainst excessive fears whilst remaining duly vigilant. On one point I\r\nwas still anxious, which was that M. Zola should be able to settle down\r\nin a convenient retreat where him himself would enjoy all necessary\r\nquietude; whilst we, Wareham and I, knowing him to be well screened from\r\nhis enemies, would be less liable to those 'excursions and alarums' which\r\nhad hitherto troubled us. As the next chapter will show, this\r\nconsummation was near at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IX\r\n\r\n                  A QUIET HOME AND A HAUNTED HOUSE\r\n\r\nIt was M. Zola himself who, after some stay at Oatlands, discovered, in\r\nthe course of his excursions with M. Desmoulin, a retreat to his liking.\r\nIt was a house in that part of Surrey belonging to a city merchant, who\r\nwas willing to let it furnished for a limited period. The owner met M.\r\nZola on various occasions and showed himself both courteous and discreet.\r\n\r\nThe details of the 'letting' were arranged between him and Mr. Wareham;\r\nand my wife hastily procured servants for the new establishment. These\r\nservants, however, did not speak French, and I settled with M. Zola that\r\nmy eldest daughter, Violette, should stay with him to act in some measure\r\nas his housekeeper and interpreter. This was thrusting a young girl, not\r\nquite sixteen, into a position of considerable responsibility, but I\r\nthought that Violette would be equal to the task, provided she followed\r\nthe instructions and advice of her mother; and as she was then at home\r\nfor the summer holidays she was sent down to M. Zola's without more ado.\r\n\r\nI shall have occasion to speak of her hereafter in some detail, in\r\nconnection with a very curious incident which marked M. Zola's exile.\r\nHere I will merely mention that a Parisienne by birth and speaking French\r\nfrom her infancy, it was easy for her to understand and explain the\r\nmaster's requirements.\r\n\r\nLike M. Zola, she was provided with a bicycle, and the pair of them\r\noccasionally spent an afternoon speeding along leafy Surrey lanes and\r\nvisiting quaint old villages. The mornings, however, were devoted to\r\nwork, for it was now that M. Zola started on his novel, 'Fecondite,' the\r\nfirst of a series of four volumes, which will be, he considers, his\r\nliterary testament.\r\n\r\nThese books, indeed, are to embody what he regards as the four cardinal\r\nprinciples of human life. First Fruitfulness, as opposed to\r\nneo-Malthusianism, which he holds to be the most pernicious of all\r\ndoctrines; next Work, as opposed to the idleness of the drones, whom he\r\nwould sweep away from the human community; then Truth, as opposed to\r\nfalsehood, hypocrisy, and convention; and, finally, Justice to one and\r\nall, in lieu of charity to some, oppression to others, and favours for\r\nthe privileged few.\r\n\r\nAll four books--'Fruitfulness,' 'Work,' 'Truth,' and 'Justice'--are to be\r\nstories; for years ago M. Zola arrived at the conclusion that mere essays\r\non sociology, though they may work good in time among people of culture,\r\nfail to reach and impress the masses in the same way as a story may do.\r\nIt is, I take it, largely on this account that Emile Zola has become a\r\nnovelist. He has certainly written essays, but he knows how\r\ninconsiderable have been their sales in comparison with those of his\r\nworks embodying precisely the same principles, but placed before the\r\nworld in the form of novels. To criticise him as a mere story-teller is\r\narrant absurdity.\r\n\r\nHe himself put the whole case in a nutshell when he remarked, 'My novels\r\nhave always been written with a higher aim than merely to amuse. I have\r\nso high an opinion of the novel as a means of expression that I have\r\nchosen it as the form in which to present to the world what I wish to say\r\non the social, scientific, and psychological problems that occupy the\r\nminds of thinking men. I might have said what I wanted to say to the\r\nworld in another form. But the novel has to-day risen from the place\r\nwhich it held in the last century at the banquet of letters. It was then\r\nthe idle pastime of the hour, and sat low down between the fable and the\r\nidyll. To-day it contains, or may be made to contain, everything; and it\r\nis because that is my creed that I am a novelist. I have, to my thinking,\r\ncertain contributions to make to the thought of the world on certain\r\nsubjects, and I have chosen the novel as the best means of communicating\r\nthese contributions to the world.'\r\n\r\nIf critics in reviewing one or another of M. Zola's books would only bear\r\nthese declarations of the author in mind, the reading public would often\r\nbe spared many irrelevant and foolish remarks.\r\n\r\nM. Zola's device is _Nulla dies sine linea_, and even before the\r\nmaterials for 'Fecondite' were brought to him from France he had given an\r\nhour or two each day to the penning of notes and impressions for\r\nsubsequent use. With the arrival of his books and memoranda, work began\r\nin a more systematic way. At half-past eight every morning he partook of\r\na cup of coffee and a roll and butter, no more, and shortly after nine he\r\nwas at his table in a small room overlooking the garden of the house he\r\nhad rented. And there he remained regularly, hard at work, until the\r\nluncheon hour, covering sheet after sheet of quarto paper with serried\r\nlines of his firm, characteristic handwriting.\r\n\r\nM. Zola has retained possession of the MSS. of almost every work written\r\nby him, and I know that these MSS. often differ largely from the books\r\nactually given to the world. The 'copy' is not only extremely clear, but\r\nremarkably free from erasures and interpolations. But when his first\r\nproofs reach him M. Zola revises them with the greatest care. He will\r\nstrike out whole passages in the most drastic manner, and alter others\r\nuntil they are almost unrecognisable.\r\n\r\nHe will even at the last moment change some character's name, and I know\r\nall the inconvenience that arises on certain occasions from having had to\r\nprepare portions of my translations from first proofs, through lack of\r\ntime to wait for the corrected matter.\r\n\r\nThis was notably the case with my version of 'Paris.' While that work was\r\npassing through the Press M. Zola was already in all the throes of the\r\nDreyfus affair, and somehow, as he has acknowledged to me with regret, he\r\nforgot to tell me that at the last moment he had changed the names of\r\nseveral personages in the story. Thus Duthil (as originally written and\r\ngiven in my translation) became Dutheil in the French book; Sagnier was\r\nchanged to Sanier; the Princess de Horn was renamed Harn and finally\r\nHarth, and young Lord George Eliott became Elson.\r\n\r\nOf course some of the reviewers of my translations attacked me virulently\r\nfor my unwarrantable presumption in changing the very names of M. Zola's\r\ncharacters; they were unaware that the names given by me were those first\r\nselected by the author, who had afterwards altered them and forgotten to\r\ntell me of it.\r\n\r\nComing back to 'Fecondite,' I should say that M. Zola wrote an average of\r\nthree pages per day of that book during his exile in England. Work ceased\r\nat the luncheon hour, as I have said, and consequently he could dispose\r\nof his afternoons.\r\n\r\nBut it will be remembered that the summer of 1898 was exceptionally hot,\r\nso hot indeed that M. Zola, though many years of his childhood were spent\r\nunder the scorching sun of Provence, found a siesta absolutely necessary\r\nafter the midday meal. It was only later that he ventured out on foot or\r\non his bicycle, often taking his hand camera with him.\r\n\r\nAt some distance from the house where he was residing, in the midst of\r\nlarge deserted grounds, overrun with grass and weeds, there stood a\r\nmournful-looking, unoccupied private residence of some architectural\r\npretensions, on the building of which a considerable sum had evidently\r\nbeen expended. The place took M. Zola's fancy the first time he passed it\r\non his bicycle. The iron entrance gate was broken, and he was able to\r\nenter the garden and peep through the ground-floor windows.\r\n\r\nAll spoke of decay and abandonment; and when, through my daughter, M.\r\nZola began to make inquiries about the place, he was told a fantastic\r\ntragic story. A murder, it was said, had been committed there many years\r\npreviously; a poor little girl had been killed by her stepmother, and her\r\nremains had been buried beneath a scullery floor.\r\n\r\nThere was also talk of the child's father, who at night drove up to the\r\nhouse in a phantom carriage drawn by ghostly horses, and hammered at the\r\ndoor of the mansion and shouted aloud for his dead child!\r\n\r\nThe story was alleged to be well known, and it was said that not a girl\r\nfrom Chertsey to Esher, from Walton to Byfleet, would have dared to pass\r\nthat house after nightfall, when harrowing voices rang out through the\r\ntrees, and the shadowy horses of the ghostly carriage trotted swiftly and\r\nsilently over the gravel.\r\n\r\nThe story not only impressed my daughter Violette, but it greatly\r\ninterested M. Zola, on whose behalf I made various inquiries. For\r\ninstance, I closely questioned an old gardener who had known the district\r\nfor long years. All he could tell me, however, was that there were\r\ncertainly some strange rumours abroad among the womenfolk, but that for\r\nhis own part he had never heard of any crime and had never seen any\r\nghost.\r\n\r\nAnd at last others told me quite a different story of the house's\r\nabandonment, and this I here venture to give, though I certainly cannot\r\nvouch for its accuracy. The place had been built, it seemed, some forty\r\nyears previously by a retired and wealthy London pawnbroker, a gaunt,\r\nshrivelled old man, who, mounted on a white mare, had in his declining\r\nyears been a familiar figure on the roads of the district.\r\n\r\nExtremely eccentric, he had largely furnished and decorated the house\r\nwith unredeemed articles that had been pledged with him. There was\r\nnothing _en suite_. Old chairs of divers patterns were mingled with odd\r\ntables and sideboards and sofas; there were also innumerable daubs\r\n'ascribed' to old masters, and a wonderful display of Wardour-street\r\n_bric-a-brac_. But, indeed, one has only to look at an average\r\npawnbroker's shop to picture what kind of articles the house must have\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the old fellow in question had three daughters, whom he\r\nkept more or less imprisoned on his recently-acquired property, though\r\nthey were charming girls well worthy of being sought in marriage; and the\r\nstory I heard was that three officers sojourning in the district had one\r\nday espied the three forlorn damsels over the garden hedge, and had\r\nforthwith begun to court them, much to the ire of the misanthropic,\r\nretired pawnbroker. That stern old gentleman ordered his daughters into\r\nthe house, and then kept them in stricter confinement than ever.\r\n\r\nBut love laughs at locksmiths, and the amorous officers eventually\r\ncarried the place by storm, and beat down all parental resistance. Three\r\nweddings followed on the same day, and all ended for a time as in a fairy\r\ntale. But the old pawnbroker subsequently married again to relieve his\r\nsolitude, and after his death his will was attacked, and an interminable\r\nlawsuit ensued, with the result that the property was left unoccupied.\r\nNow, it appeared, it was for sale, and before long would probably be cut\r\nup into building plots.\r\n\r\nWhatever romantic element there might be in the story of the pawnbroker\r\nand his daughters, M. Zola much preferred the popular and gruesome legend\r\nof the little girl murdered in the scullery; and, some time later, when\r\nhe consented to write a short story for 'The Star,' it was this legend\r\nwhich he took as his basis, building thereon the pathetic sketch of\r\n'Angeline,' the scene of which he transferred to France.\r\n\r\nHe has stated in his article 'Justice,' published in Paris on his return\r\nfrom exile, that during most of the time he spent in England he was\r\nvirtually in a desert. There were people about him of course; but he\r\nretired into himself as it were, communing with his own thoughts, and\r\nseeking no intercourse with strangers. This is true of the period to\r\nwhich I am now referring. Still he did not complain of solitude. In fact\r\nhe knew that quiet was essential for his work. Only once or twice did\r\nanything happen of a nature to cause any anxiety. Neither Wareham nor\r\nmyself was much troubled at this period; there was a lull even in the\r\nperiodical visits which gentlemen of the Press kindly favoured me.\r\n\r\nStill we had taken our precautions by admitting a mutual friend, Mr. A.\r\nW. Pamplin, into our confidence. If M. Zola's communications with Paris,\r\nthrough Wareham and myself, should be threatened, Mr. Pamplin was to take\r\nupon himself the duty of re-establishing them.\r\n\r\nAt M. Zola's house there was, so far as I am aware, but one brief\r\n_alerte_. This occurred one afternoon, when a servant came to my daughter\r\nwith the tidings that there was a French hunchback at the door. Violette\r\nimpulsively rushed off to tell M. Zola of it; but when in her turn she\r\nwent to the door to see who the person might be, she found that he was an\r\nEnglishman, a traveller for some county directory, who had merely\r\nperformed his legitimate work in requesting to know the name of the\r\noccupier of the house. Of course the only name given was that of the\r\nowner, then absent at the seaside.\r\n\r\nThus the hot days sped by peacefully enough. M. Zola had at least found\r\noccupation and quietude, though it was naturally impossible that he\r\nshould feel content with his lot. Each day brought more and more home to\r\nhim the consciousness that he was in exile, and that contumely had been\r\nhis reward for seeking to save France from the shame of a great crime.\r\n\r\nI have previously mentioned that during the first week or so of his\r\nsojourn in England he had refused to look at newspapers and--at least so\r\nit seemed to me--had sought to banish the Dreyfus affair and his own\r\ntroubles from his mind, much as one might seek to drive away a hateful\r\nnightmare. But before long he again fell under the spell and followed the\r\ncourse of events with the keenest interest. And again and again, reading\r\nof the great battle being waged in France, he longed to return home, and\r\ngrew restless and impatient.\r\n\r\nMoreover a complaint from which he has suffered on and off for some years\r\ntroubled him on more than one occasion. He always rallied, however, and\r\nreturned to his work with renewed energy. 'Fecondite' was already taking\r\nshape in the leafy solitude in which he dwelt. And undoubtedly the steady\r\ntask of creation, resumed morning by morning, greatly helped him to quiet\r\nthe anguish of heart which the course of events in France would otherwise\r\nhave rendered intolerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE.--While this work was appearing serially in the 'Evening\r\n  News' I received numerous letters from readers interested in\r\n  various matters mentioned by me. With respect to the foregoing\r\n  chapter, a lady living at Staines wrote saying that she was\r\n  looking out for 'a cheap haunted house,' and asking for the\r\n  address of the one I had mentioned. I was unable to comply with\r\n  her request, as personally I do not believe the house was haunted\r\n  at all. Moreover, to prevent the sale or letting of any particular\r\n  house by asserting it to be haunted would be an offence under the\r\n  libel laws. As I could not tell what course my lady-correspondent\r\n  might take in the matter, I preferred not to answer her. May she\r\n  forgive me my impoliteness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 X\r\n\r\n                        'LE REVE': THE DREAM\r\n\r\nWhen the owner of the house which M. Zola had rented desired to resume\r\npossession, it became necessary to find new quarters of a similar\r\ncharacter for the master. And so he was transferred to another Surrey\r\ncountry house where the arrangements remained much the same as\r\npreviously: work every morning, resting or bicycling in the afternoon,\r\nfollowed by newspaper reading and letter-writing in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of M. Zola's new retreat were very extensive, and in part\r\nvery shady, which last circumstance proved extremely welcome to the\r\nnovelist, who on coming to 'cold, damp, foggy England,' as the French put\r\nit, had never imagined that he would have to endure a temperature\r\napproaching that of the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe heat deprived him of appetite, and, moreover, he did not particularly\r\nrelish some of the dishes provided for him by a new cook who had lately\r\nbeen engaged. We all know how great is the servant difficulty even under\r\nthe best of circumstances; and when cooks and maids have to be secured in\r\nhot haste an entirely satisfactory result is hardly to be expected.\r\nMoreover, many servants refuse to live in country retirement, far away\r\nfrom their 'followers,' and thus one has at times to take such as one can\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nAs for the cookery to which M. Zola was at certain periods treated, he\r\nbeheld it with wonder and repulsion. His tastes are simple, but to him\r\nthe plain, boiled, watery potato and the equally watery greens were\r\nabominations. Plum tart, though served hot (why not cold, like the French\r\n_tarte_?) might be more or less eatable; but, surely, apple pudding--the\r\ninveterate breeder of indigestion--was the invention of a savage race.\r\nAnd why, when a prime steak was grilled, should the cook water it in\r\norder to produce 'gravy,' instead of applying to it a little butter and\r\nchopped parsley? This, Dundreary-wise, was one of those things which\r\nnobody, not even M. Zola, could understand.\r\n\r\nHowever, a visit to a fishmonger's shop had made him acquainted with the\r\nhaddock, the kipper, and likewise the humble bloater; and occasionally, I\r\nbelieve, when his appetite needed a stimulant he turned to the smoked\r\nfish, which seemed so novel to his palate. The cook, of course, was\r\nmightily incensed thereat. For her part, she most certainly would not eat\r\nhaddock or kippers for dinner; she had too much self-respect to do such a\r\nthing, so she boiled or roasted a leg of mutton for her own repast and\r\nthe maids'. I do not say that she was wrong; and, indeed, M. Zola never\r\nforced people to eat what they did not care for.\r\n\r\nBut in the same way he wished for something that he himself could eat,\r\nand he was weary of the perpetual joint and the vegetables _a l'eau_. One\r\nday, when in a jocular spirit he was talking to me on this subject, I\r\ntold him that we English had a saying to the effect that 'God sent us\r\nfood, but the devil invented cooks.'\r\n\r\n'You are quite right,' he replied, 'only as a Frenchman I should put it\r\nthis way: \"God sent us food, but the devil invented English cooks.\"'\r\n\r\nTowards the end of August he again became very dispirited. The 'cause'\r\ndid not at that time appear to be prospering in France, where so many\r\npeople remained under the spell of the deceptive declarations and\r\ndocuments which had been made public in the Chamber of Deputies by War\r\nMinister Cavaignac early in July.\r\n\r\nOf course the Revisionists were still hard at work, but in the face of M.\r\nCavaignac's speech, placarded throughout the 36,000 townships of France,\r\nthey seemed to have a very uphill task before them. The anti-Dreyfusites\r\non their side were more arrogant than ever, and although M. Zola never\r\nonce lost faith in the justice of his cause and its ultimate triumph, he\r\ndid, on more than one occasion, question whether that triumph would come\r\nin a peaceful way.\r\n\r\nFelix Faure was then still President of the Republic, and I am abusing, I\r\nthink, no confidence in saying that M. Zola regarded that vain, showy man\r\nas one of the great obstacles to the victory of truth and justice. Faure,\r\nhe said to me, had undoubtedly at one time enjoyed well-deserved\r\npopularity; he, Zola, had been received by him and in the most cordial\r\nmanner. But the President's intercourse with crowned heads, and his\r\nintimacy with arrogant general officers, coupled with all the flummery of\r\nthe Protocole, all the pomp and display observed whenever he stirred from\r\nthe Palace of the Elysee, had virtually turned his head. He was in the\r\nhands of those military men who opposed revision, and he shielded them\r\nbecause their downfall would mean his own. He was bent on the hushing-up\r\ncourse lest his Presidency should become synonymous with a great judicial\r\ncrime; he feared that he might be forced to resign even before his term\r\nof office was over, or, at all events, that he might have to abandon all\r\nhope of re-election.\r\n\r\nAnd thus with the President and the more prominent generals opposed to\r\nrevision, M. Zola, though confident in the final issue, more than once\r\nsaid to me that there might be serious trouble before all was over.\r\n\r\nHe was now kept very well informed of all that took place in France;\r\nintelligence often reached him before it appeared in the newspapers; and\r\nnow and again he told me what was brewing. Going backward, too, he\r\nconfided to me some curious particulars of the genesis of the Revisionist\r\ncampaign. But he will himself some day tell all this in a book of his\r\nown, and I must not anticipate him. I will only say that various\r\nimportant things he mentioned to me in the autumn of 1898 have since\r\nbecome well-known, acknowledged facts, and I have every reason to believe\r\nthat time will duly show the accuracy of those which have not as yet been\r\npublicly revealed.\r\n\r\nThere is one point to which I must refer at more length. In his\r\ndeclaration 'Justice,' published on the expiration of his exile, M. Zola\r\nstated that he had long suspected Colonel Henry, though he had possessed\r\nno actual proof of that officer's guilt. This is so true, that I well\r\nrecollect listening to a conversation between him and M. Desmoulin during\r\nthe first days of their sojourn in England, when they compared notes with\r\nrespect to their impressions of Henry, whom they had particularly noticed\r\nat Versailles on the occasion of M. Zola's sentence by default.\r\n\r\nThey had then observed how nervous and crestfallen the colonel\r\nlooked--the very picture, indeed, of a man who dreads the discovery of\r\nhis guilt. This was the more remarkable, as Henry's confident arrogance\r\nat the earlier trial in Paris had been so conspicuous. The man had a\r\nskeleton in his cupboard--to Zola and Desmoulin that was certain.\r\n\r\nM. Zola is a good physiognomist, and his friend (as a portraitist) is\r\nscarcely less gifted in that respect, and they felt equally certain of\r\nHenry's culpability. As yet they could not say that it was he who had\r\nactually forged that famous 'absolute proof' of Dreyfus's guilt, which\r\nthey knew to have been forged by some one, but that time would prove him\r\nguilty of some abominable machination was to them a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nOne day, it must have been I suppose the 31st of August, a rather strange\r\ntelegram in French reached me for transmission to M. Zola. It came from\r\nParis, and was, so far as I remember, to this effect: 'Be prepared for a\r\ngreat success.'\r\n\r\nA name I was acquainted with followed; but what the telegram might mean I\r\nknew not. There was absolutely nothing in the newspapers with reference\r\nto any great success achieved at that moment by the Revisionist party;\r\nbut possibly the message might refer to one or another of M. Zola's\r\nlawsuits, such as that with the 'Petit Journal' or that with the\r\nhandwriting experts. I re-telegraphed it to M. Zola, and that day, at all\r\nevents, I thought no more of the matter.\r\n\r\nBut I afterwards learnt that the telegram had perplexed him quite as much\r\nas it perplexed me. A great success? What could it be? He racked his mind\r\nin vain. He reviewed all the phases and aspects of the Dreyfus case,\r\nwondering whether this or that had happened, but not suspecting the\r\npublic revelations which were then impending, the tragedy which was being\r\nenacted.\r\n\r\nFor a while he walked up and down, feverish and anxious (he was at the\r\ntime in poor health), and then he would fling himself on a sofa, still\r\nand ever indulging in his surmises. With that kind of prescience which he\r\nhad so frequently displayed in the Dreyfus affair, he felt certain that\r\nsomething very important had occurred, for otherwise such a mysterious\r\ntelegram would never have been sent him. This lasted the whole evening.\r\n\r\nMy daughter Violette was with him at the time, and his feverishness\r\ndoubtless gained on her. At last she retired to rest, while M. Zola,\r\naccording to his wont, carried a lamp into his own room to sit there a\r\nwhile and read some French newspapers which had reached him, via Wareham,\r\nby the evening delivery. There was nothing in them of a nature to explain\r\nthe mysterious telegram; still he read on and on in the hope, as it were,\r\nof quieting himself.\r\n\r\nIt was, I believe, between eleven o'clock and midnight when he rose to go\r\nto bed, and as he did so he heard some loud exclamations, followed by a\r\ncry. At first he fancied that the calls came from one of the servants'\r\nrooms, and he paused on the landing. Then, however, as they were\r\nrepeated, he found that they came from my daughter's apartment. With\r\nfatherly solicitude he waited and listened. Violette was calling in her\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nPractical enough in matters of everyday life, this girl of mine has\r\nliterary partialities of a somewhat gruesome kind, and her avowed\r\nambition (I quote her own words) is to write, some day, stories full of\r\nwitches and wizards, that shall make people's flesh creep. For this\r\nreason I keep such of Anne Radcliffe's uncanny novels as I possess\r\ncarefully locked up.\r\n\r\nI can well remember my daughter telling me at times of strange things\r\ndreamt by her in her sleep; but not of being of a romantic or a mystical\r\nturn myself, I have usually pooh-poohed all this as nonsense. And such I\r\nbelieve is the course which fathers usually adopt if their daughters'\r\nimaginations begin to run riot.\r\n\r\nAs for M. Zola, when he heard Violette calling in her sleep, his first\r\nimpulse was to rouse her, but all suddenly became still again. The girl\r\nhad probably sunk into a more peaceful slumber. And so, after waiting a\r\nfew minutes longer, he thought it best to leave her as she was.\r\n\r\nNothing further disturbed M. Zola that night; but on the following\r\nmorning, when he met Violette downstairs, he asked her how she felt, and\r\ntold her that he had heard her calling in her sleep. He had probably\r\nformed the same opinion as I should have formed under the circumstances,\r\nnamely, that it was a case of indigestion or a little excitement.\r\n\r\nBut she turned to him and replied, 'Oh! I had such a frightful dream. . .\r\nI was in a big black place, and there was a man on the ground covered\r\nwith blood, and people were crowding round him, talking with great\r\nexcitement. And I saw you, Monsieur Zola, and you came up looking like a\r\ngiant and waved your arms again and again, and seemed well pleased.'\r\n\r\nM. Zola was dumbfounded. He could make nothing of it. A man in a pool of\r\nblood and others round him; and he, Zola, waving his arms and looking\r\nwell pleased! It was nonsense; and he was disposed to laugh at the girl\r\nand chide her. But a little later, with the arrival of some morning\r\nnewspapers, the position suddenly changed.\r\n\r\nHere I should mention that as the Paris journals only reached M. Zola\r\nwith a delay of twelve or four-and-twenty hours, it had just been\r\narranged that he should be supplied with two or three London papers every\r\nmorning, and that he and Violette between them should put the telegrams\r\nconcerning the Dreyfus business into French.\r\n\r\nHe opened one of these English newspapers--which it was I do not\r\nrecollect--and there he saw a whole column dealing with the arrest and\r\nconfession of Colonel Henry. The heading to the telegrams, the very words\r\n'arrest' and 'confession,' made everything intelligible to M. Zola; and\r\nbeneath all this came a brief wire headed, I think, 'Paris, midnight,'\r\nand worded much to this effect: 'Colonel Henry has been found dead in his\r\ncell at Mont Valerien.'\r\n\r\nSo that was the man whom Violette, in her dream, had seen weltering in a\r\npool of blood, surrounded by his custodians, who had rushed in full of\r\nexcitement! M. Zola's presence in that vision was, so to say, symbolical.\r\n'He had waved his arms and had seemed well pleased'--so the girl had put\r\nit in her frank, artless way. 'Well pleased' may perhaps appear to be\r\nscarcely the correct expression. At all events, it needs to be\r\ninterpreted. Most certainly Zola never desired the death of a sinner;\r\nbut, on the other hand, he could only feel some satisfaction at knowing\r\nthat Henry's crime was at last divulged to the world.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is how my daughter dreamt Henry's death. I do not wish to\r\ninsist unduly on the incident, and I have no intention of appealing to\r\nthe Psychical Research Society to test, corroborate, or disprove the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThere was one rather curious feature that I have not yet mentioned. My\r\ndaughter has assured me that during the same night she dreamt the same\r\nthing over and over again. She tried to banish the vision, but ever and\r\never it returned, as if to impress itself indelibly upon her mind. And\r\never did she see M. Zola waving his arms as he hovered round the scene.\r\n\r\nAt that time the girl knew nothing of Colonel Henry; she understood very\r\nlittle about the Dreyfus case; and all she had to go upon was the\r\nenigmatical telegram and M. Zola's talk during the evening, when he was\r\nexpressing his thoughts aloud. But at that moment he had foreseen no\r\ndeath, murder, or suicide, and if the possibility of any arrest had\r\noccurred to him it was that of M. du Paty de Clam, which the Revisionist\r\npapers were then demanding.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in infancy my daughter had often seen Mont Valerien, as I\r\nlived for some years at Boulogne-sur-Seine, and the hill and fortress\r\ntowering across the river were then familiar objects to us all. But the\r\ngirl was little more than a baby at the time, and so this circumstance\r\ncan have exercised no influence upon her. Moreover, she has told me that\r\nshe had no notion as to what might be the actual scene of her dream; it\r\nmerely appeared to her that she was in France, because the people she saw\r\nraised ejaculations in French.\r\n\r\nPassing from this incident, I may point out that the telegram sent to M.\r\nZola through me was explained by the news in the English newspapers. It\r\nwas evident that the 'great success' referred to in the message was the\r\ndiscovery of Henry's forgery and possibly his arrest.\r\n\r\nDirectly I saw the news in a London newspaper I hurried off to M. Zola's,\r\nand when I reached his abode about noon I found him expecting me. We then\r\nwent over matters together, the press telegrams, my daughter's dream and\r\nthe probable outcome of the whole affair.\r\n\r\nAs was natural, M. Zola was quite excited. First, the document which\r\nHenry had confessed to having forged was the very one that General de\r\nPellieux had imported into the Zola trial in Paris as convincing proof of\r\nDreyfus's guilt. At that time already its effect had been very great; it\r\nhad destroyed all chance of M. Zola's acquittal. Then, too, it had been\r\nsolemnly brought forward in the Chamber of Deputies by War Minister\r\nCavaignac, who had vouched for its authenticity. And now, as previously\r\nalleged by Colonel Picquart, it was shown to be a forgery of the\r\nclumsiest kind.\r\n\r\nHere at least was 'a new fact' warranting the revision of the whole\r\nDreyfus case. Surely the blindest bigot could not resist such evidence of\r\nthe machinations of those who had sent Dreyfus to Devil's Island; truth\r\nand justice would speedily triumph, and in a week or two he, Zola, would\r\nbe able to return to France again.\r\n\r\nBut he did not take sufficient account of human obstinacy and vileness.\r\nHis friends, to whom he appealed on the subject of his return, urged him\r\nto remain where he was, for the battle, they said, was by no means over,\r\nand his name was still like the red scarf of the matador that goads the\r\nbull to fury. The advice proved good, for again were passions stirred.\r\nHenry, the ignoble forger, was raised to the position of martyr, and\r\nCavaignac and Zurlinden and Chanoine in turn strove to impede the course\r\nof justice. 'Hope deferred maketh the heart sick,' and thus M. Zola,\r\nfinding so many difficulties in the way of his return, abandoned for a\r\ntime all work and fell into brooding melancholy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XI\r\n\r\n                         THROUGH THE AUTUMN\r\n\r\nImportant events were now taking place in Paris. Cavaignac resigned the\r\nposition of War Minister and was succeeded by Zurlinden; Du Paty de Clam\r\nwas turned out of the army; Esterhazy, who had likewise been 'retired,'\r\nfled from France, Mme. Dreyfus addressed to the Minister of Justice a\r\nformal application for the revision of her unfortunate husband's case;\r\nand that application was in the first instance referred to a Commission\r\nof judges and functionaries. Then General Zurlinden resigned his\r\nMinisterial office, and again becoming Governor of Paris, apprehended the\r\ngallant Picquart on a ridiculous charge of forgery, and cast him into\r\nclose confinement in a military prison. There was talk, too, of a\r\nmilitary plot in Paris, and again and again were attempts made to prevent\r\nthe granting of Revision.\r\n\r\nThroughout those days of alternate hope and fear M. Zola suffered keenly.\r\nIt was, too, about this time that he heard of the death of his favourite\r\ndog--an incident to which I have previously referred as coming like a\r\nblow of fate in the midst of all his anxiety.\r\n\r\nWhen he rallied he spoke to me of his desire to familiarise himself in\r\nsome degree with the English language, with the object principally of\r\narriving at a more accurate understanding of the telegrams from Paris\r\nwhich he found in the London newspapers. A dictionary, a conversation\r\nmanual, and an English grammar for French students were then obtained;\r\nand whenever he felt that he needed a little relaxation, he took up one\r\nor another of these books and read them, as he put it to me, 'from a\r\nphilosophical point of view.'\r\n\r\nLater I procured him a set of Messrs. Nelson's 'Royal Readers' for\r\nchildren, when he greatly praised, declaring them to be much superior to\r\nthe similar class of work current in France. Afterwards he himself\r\npurchased a prettily illustrated edition of the classic 'Vicar of\r\nWakefield' (the work to which all French young ladies are put when\r\nlearning our language), but he found portions difficult to understand,\r\nand a French friend then procured him an edition in which the text is\r\nprinted in French and English on alternate pages.\r\n\r\nOne day when he had been dipping into English papers and books he tackled\r\nme on rather a curious point. 'Why is it,' said he, 'that the Englishman\r\nwhen he writes of himself should invariably use a capital letter? That\r\ntall \"I\" which recurs so often in a personal narrative strikes me as\r\nbeing very arrogant. A Frenchman, referring to himself, writes _je_ with\r\na small _j_; a German, though he may gratify all his substantives with\r\ncapital letters, employs a small _i_ in writing _ich_; a Spaniard, when\r\nhe uses the personal pronoun at all, bestows a small _y_ on his _yo_,\r\nwhile he honours the person he addresses with a capital _V_. I believe,\r\nindeed--though I am not sufficiently acquainted with foreign languages to\r\nspeak with certainty on the point--that the Englishman is the only person\r\nin the world who applies a capital letter to himself. That \"I\" strikes me\r\nas the triumph of egotism. It is tall, commanding, and so brief! \"I\"--and\r\nthat suffices. How did it originate?'\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to answer M. Zola on the point; I am a very poor\r\nscholar in such a matter, and I could find nothing on the subject in any\r\nwork of reference I had by me. I surmised, however, that the capital I,\r\nas a personal pronoun, was a survival of the time when English, whether\r\nwritten or printed, was studded with capitals, even as German is to-day.\r\nIf I am wrong, perhaps some one who knows better will correct me. One\r\nthing I have often noticed is that a child's first impulse is to write\r\n'i,' and that it is only after admonition that the aggressive and\r\negotistical 'I' supplants the humbler form of the letter. This did not\r\nsurprise M. Zola, since vanity, like most other vices, is acquired, not\r\ninherent in our natures. But in a chaffing way he suggested that one\r\nmight write a very humorous essay on the English character by taking as\r\none's text that tall, stiff, and self-assertive letter 'I.'\r\n\r\nHow far M. Zola actually carried his study of English I could hardly say,\r\nbut during the last months of his exile he more than once astonished me\r\nby his knowledge of an irregular verb or of the correct comparative and\r\nsuperlative of an adjective. And if he seldom attempted to speak English,\r\nhe at least made considerable progress in reading it. By the time he\r\nreturned to France he could always understand any Dreyfus news in the\r\nEnglish papers. Of course the language in which the news was couched was\r\nof great help to him, as in three instances out of four it was simply\r\ndirect translation from the French.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, while praising many features of the English Press, M.\r\nZola more than once expressed to me his surprise that so much of the\r\nParis news printed in London should be simply taken from Paris journals.\r\nSome correspondents, said he, never seemed to go anywhere or to see\r\nanybody themselves. They purely and simply extracted everything from\r\nnewspapers. This he was able to check by means of the many Paris prints\r\nwhich he received regularly.\r\n\r\n'Here,' he would say, 'this paragraph is taken verbatim from \"Le Figaro\";\r\nthis other appeared in \"Le Temps,\" this other in \"Le Siecle,\"' and so\r\nforth. And he was not alluding to extracts from editorials, but to\r\ndescriptive matter--accounts of demonstrations and ceremonies,\r\nfashionable weddings and other social functions, interviews, and so\r\nforth. The practice upset all his ideas of a foreign correspondent's\r\nduties, which should be to obtain first-hand and not second-hand\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIn principle this is of course correct, but a correspondent cannot be\r\neverywhere at the same time; and nowadays, moreover, English journalists\r\nin Paris do not enjoy quite the same facilities as formerly. As regards\r\nmore particularly the Dreyfus business, the French, with a sensitiveness\r\nthat can be understood, have all along deprecated anything in the way of\r\nforeign interference, and the English Pressman of inquiring mind on the\r\nsubject has more than once met with a rebuff from those in a position to\r\ngive information. Again, the political difficulties between the two\r\ncountries of recent years have often placed the Paris correspondents in a\r\nvery invidious position.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the Fashoda trouble, which arose last autumn while M.\r\nZola was still in his country retreat. The great novelist's enemies have\r\noften alleged that he was no true Frenchman; but for my part, after\r\nthirty years' intimacy with the French, I would claim for him that his\r\ncountry counts no better patriot. He is on principle opposed to warfare,\r\nbut there is a higher patriotism than that which consists in perpetually\r\nbeating the big drum, and that higher patriotism is Zola's.\r\n\r\nThe Fashoda difficulties troubled him sorely, and directly it seemed\r\nlikely that the situation might become serious he told me that it would\r\nbe impossible for him to remain in England. The progress of the\r\nnegotiations between France and Great Britain was watched with keen\r\nvigilance, and M. Zola was ready to start at the first sign of those\r\nnegotiations collapsing. As all his friends were opposed to his return to\r\nFrance (they had again virtually forbidden it late in September when the\r\nBrisson Ministry finally submitted the case for revision to the Criminal\r\nChamber of the Cour de Cassation), he would probably have gone to\r\nBelgium, but I doubt whether he would have remained long in that country.\r\n\r\nI have said that M. Zola is opposed to warfare on principle. His views in\r\nthis respect have long been shared by me. Life's keenest impressions are\r\nthose acquired in childhood and youth. And in my youth--I was but\r\nseventeen, though already acting as a war correspondent, the youngest, I\r\nsuppose, on record--I witnessed war attended by every horror:--A city,\r\nParis, starved by the foreigner and subsequently in part fired by some of\r\nits own children. And between those disasters, having passed through the\r\nhostile lines, I saw an army of 125,000 men with 350 guns, that of\r\nChanzy, irretrievably routed after battling in a snowstorm of three days'\r\nduration, cast into highways and byways, with thousands of barefooted\r\nstragglers begging their bread, with hundreds of farmers bewailing their\r\ncrops, their cattle, and their ruined homesteads, with mothers\r\ninnumerable weeping for their sons, and fair girls in the heyday of their\r\nyouth lamenting the lads to whom their troth was plighted. And in that\r\n'Retraite Infernale,' as one of its historians has called it, I saw want,\r\nhunger, cupidity, cruelty, disease, stalking beside the war fiend; so no\r\nwonder that, like Zola, I regard warfare as the greatest of abominations\r\nthat fall upon the world. I often regret that, short of actual war itself\r\nand its disaster and misery, there should be no means of bringing the\r\nwhole horror of the thing home to those silly, arm-chair, jingo\r\njournalists of many countries, our own included, who, viewing war simply\r\nas a means of imposing the will of the stronger upon the weaker, and\r\nlosing sight of all that attends it, save martial pomp and individual\r\nheroism, ever clamour for the exercise of force as soon as any difficulty\r\narises between two governments.\r\n\r\nTies of affection, bonds of marriage, as well as long years of intimacy,\r\nlink me moreover to the French people; and more keenly, perhaps, than\r\neven the master himself, did I realise what war between France and\r\nEngland might mean; thus we both had an anxious time during the Fashoda\r\ntrouble. Fortunately for the general peace hostilities were averted, and\r\nM. Zola was thus able to remain in his secluded English home, and to\r\ncontinue the writing of his novel.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still very fine, and now and again he ventured upon a\r\nlittle excursion. The principal one was to Virginia Water, where he\r\nstrolled round the lake, then drove through part of the Great Park, and\r\nthence on to Windsor Castle, where he saw all the sights, the State\r\napartments, St. George's Hall and Chapel, the Albert Memorial Chapel, and\r\nso forth. And, as he had brought his hand camera with him, he was able to\r\ntake a few snapshots of what he saw. I was not present on that occasion;\r\nhis companions were a French gentleman, a very intimate friend, and my\r\ndaughter, but I was pleased to hear that he had, at all events, seen\r\nWindsor. As a rule, it was extremely difficult to induce him to emerge\r\nfrom his solitude. When he took a walk or a bicycle ride his destination\r\nwas simply some sleepy Surrey village or deserted common.\r\n\r\nHe appreciated English scenery. Around Oatlands he had been much struck\r\nby the beauty of the trees, and was greatly astonished to find such lofty\r\nand perfect hedges of holly running at times for a mile almost without a\r\nbreak on either side of the roads. I suppose that some of the finest\r\nholly hedges in England are to be found in that district. Then, too, the\r\nrookeries surprised and interested him. There was one he could see from\r\nhis window at the last half of his country residences, and many an idle\r\nhalf-hour was spent by him in watching the flight of the birds or their\r\noccasional parliaments.\r\n\r\nNobody recognised him on his rambles. I even doubt if people, generally,\r\nthought him a foreigner. He had long ceased to wear his rosette of the\r\nLegion of Honour, and he had replaced his white billycock by an English\r\nstraw hat. Towards the close of the fine weather he purchased a 'bowler,'\r\nwhich greatly altered his appearance. Indeed, there is nothing like a\r\n'bowler' to make a foreigner look English.\r\n\r\nWareham and I had now quite ceased to fear that any attempt would be made\r\nto serve the Versailles judgment on M. Zola. We were only troubled by\r\ngentlemen of the Press, both French and English, for since Esterhazy had\r\nfled from France and the case for revision had been formally referred to\r\nthe Cour de Cassation, several newspapers had become desirous of\r\nascertaining M. Zola's views on the course of events. My instructions\r\nremained, however, the same as formerly: I was to tell every applicant\r\nthat M. Zola declined to make any public statement, and that he would\r\nreceive nobody. I was occasionally inclined to fancy that some of those\r\nwho called on me imagined that these instructions were of my own\r\ninvention, and that I was simply keeping M. Zola _au secret_ for purposes\r\nof my own. But nothing was further from the truth.\r\n\r\nPersonally, at certain moments, when the revision proceedings began, when\r\nM. Brisson fell from office, when M. Dupuy, listening to the clamour of a\r\npack of jackals, transferred the revision inquiry from the Criminal\r\nChamber to the entire Court of Cassation, I thought that it might really\r\nbe advisable for him to speak out. But, anxious though he was, disgusted,\r\nindignant, too, at times, he would do nothing to add fuel to the flame.\r\nPassions were roused to a high enough pitch already, and he had no desire\r\nto inflame them more.\r\n\r\nBesides the cause was in very good hands; Clemenceau and Vaughan, Yves\r\nGuyot and Reinach, Jaures and Gerault-Richard, Pressense, Cornely, and\r\nscores of others were fighting admirably in the Press, and his\r\nintervention was not required. Many a man circumstanced as M. Zola was\r\nwould have rushed into print for the mere sake of notoriety, but he\r\ncondemned himself to silence, stifling the words which rose from his\r\nthrobbing heart. And, after all, was not that course more worthy, more\r\ndignified?\r\n\r\nThus I could only return one answer to the newspaper men who wrote to me\r\nor called at my house. Late in autumn there was an average of three\r\napplications a week. One or two gentlemen, I believe, imagined that M.\r\nZola was staying very near me, and, failing to learn anything at my\r\nplace, they tried to question one or two tradesmen in the neighbourhood.\r\nOne of these, a grocer, became so irate at the frequent inquiries as to\r\nwhether a Frenchman, who wrote books and had a grey beard, and wore\r\nglasses, was not staying in the vicinity, that he ended by receiving the\r\nreporters with far more energy than politeness, not only ordering them\r\nout of his shop at the double quick, but pursuing them with his\r\nvituperative eloquence. 'Taking one consideration with another, a\r\nreporter's lot, at times, is not a happy one.'\r\n\r\nA climax was reached when one gentleman, after communicating with M. Zola\r\nby letter through various channels and receiving no answer from him,\r\nascertained my address and called there. As servants are not always to be\r\ndepended upon, we had made it virtually a rule at home that whenever a\r\nstranger was seen at the front door my wife herself should, if possible,\r\nanswer it. And she did so in the instance I am referring to.\r\n\r\nWell, the gentleman first asked for me, and on learning that I was\r\nabsent, he explained that he was a friend, a private friend of M. Zola,\r\nwhom he wished to see on an important private matter. Could she, my wife,\r\noblige him with M. Zola's address? No, she could not; he had better\r\nwrite, and his letter would be duly forwarded by me. Then the applicant\r\nstarted on another story. It was no use his writing, he must see me.\r\nShould I be at home on the morrow? The matter was of great importance, it\r\nwould mean a large sum of money for myself and so on. My wife had not\r\nmuch confidence in what was told her, but she requested the visitor to\r\nleave his name and address in order that I might make an appointment with\r\nhim, should I think such a course advisable.\r\n\r\nShe was, at the moment, far more amazed and amused than indignant. She\r\nbade the gentleman keep his money, and then showed him to the door. To me\r\nthat evening she did not mention the incident, and, indeed, I only heard\r\nof it after I had taken the trouble to communicate with M. Zola\r\nrespecting the gentleman's urgent private business, which (so it turned\r\nout) was purely and simply connected with journalism, my visitor having\r\nacted on behalf of the owner of a well-known London newspaper.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether his principal had any knowledge of his impudent\r\nattempt at bribery. For my own part I much regret that my wife (I suppose\r\nin the interests of peace) should have kept it from me at that time as\r\nshe did, for the gentleman might otherwise have experienced, as he\r\ndeserved, a rather unpleasant ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                XII\r\n\r\n                      THE FINAL RESTING-PLACE\r\n\r\nAt last the time arrived when it became necessary to remove M. Zola from\r\nhis country quarters, and by his desire Wareham and I then looked around\r\nus for a suitable suburban hotel. The autumn was now far spent and M.\r\nZola felt confident that he would be back in Paris by the end of the\r\nyear. Had he foreseen that his exile would prove so long, he would\r\ncertainly have sent for a couple of his French servants, and have set up\r\na quiet establishment in some other furnished house. But for another\r\nmonth or two he considered that hotel accommodation would well suffice.\r\n\r\nThe place selected for him by Wareham and myself was the Queen's Hotel,\r\nUpper Norwood, and there he remained from late in the autumn of 1898\r\nuntil his departure from England.\r\n\r\nA glance at the Queen's Hotel shows one that it is composed of what were\r\nonce separate houses, now connected together by buildings of one storey\r\nonly. Each of these houses, or, as one may perhaps call them, pavilions,\r\nhas a separate entrance and staircase; and the advantage of this, to one\r\ncircumstanced as M. Zola was, must be obvious. A person lodging in one of\r\nthe pavilions can come and go freely. There is no vast hall to cross,\r\nwith a dozen servants standing around, ready to scrutinise you as you\r\npass in and out. You have your suite of rooms in one or another pavilion,\r\nyou take your meals there in your own dining-room, and you can shut\r\nyourself off, as it were, from the greater part of the establishment and\r\nenjoy privacy and quiet. This, no doubt, is the reason why so many\r\nwell-to-do people, who dislike the stir and bustle of the ordinary hotel,\r\npatronise the hostelry at Upper Norwood.\r\n\r\nThere at one time--when consulting Sir Morell Mackenzie, I\r\nbelieve--stayed the unfortunate Emperor Frederick; and now it may add to\r\nits list of patrons the most famous Frenchman of his day.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Wareham and me that the Queen's Hotel would, under the\r\ncircumstances, prove an ideal retreat for M. Zola. Moreover, Upper\r\nNorwood stands on very high ground, and it was probable therefore that he\r\nwould largely escape the winter fogs. Of course the Crystal Palace was\r\ncomparatively near, but it was not very largely patronised in the winter,\r\nand, besides, if M. Zola wished to escape a crowd, he had only to take\r\nhis walks in another direction.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's Hotel stands back from the road; but, in the first instance,\r\nas a precautionary measure it was thought best to select for M. Zola a\r\nsuite of rooms overlooking the extensive gardens. As time went on,\r\nhowever, the trees lost their last leaves, the vista from these rooms,\r\ncharming enough in summer, became very cheerless. So the master's\r\nquarters were shifted to a larger suite on the ground floor, with the\r\nwindows of the two communicating sitting-rooms overlooking both the road\r\nand the garden.\r\n\r\nThe two sitting-rooms were an advantage, particularly during the time\r\nthat Mme. Zola stayed at the Queen's Hotel (for she joined her husband on\r\nand off), as he could devote one of them entirely to his work. But when\r\nMme. Zola finally left England (in a very ailing state, after a terrible\r\ncold had kept her within doors for some weeks) her husband moved once\r\nagain, and installed himself on the second floor, where the rooms were\r\nsmaller and therefore easier to warm. It was then mid-winter.\r\n\r\nThe various rooms M. Zola occupied and in which he spent from seven to\r\neight months--that is by far the greater portion of his exile--were all\r\npart of the same house or pavilion, this being the last of the pavilions\r\nconstituting the hotel proper. Adjoining is a lower building, belonging\r\nto the same proprietary as the hotel, but, in a measure, distinct from\r\nit. Most of M. Zola's tenancy was spent in the topmost rooms. After\r\nbringing the master up from the country, I took him one morning down to\r\nNorwood, and he cordially approved of the arrangements which had been\r\nmade for him. There was only one thing amiss. Wareham and I had been\r\npromised that he should have a waiter speaking French to attend on him;\r\nand the one provided knew perhaps just a few words of that language.\r\nHowever, he was very intelligent, very discreet, very willing to\r\noblige--a pattern waiter of the good old English school. And when I had\r\nexplained to him exactly what would be required, he took due note of\r\neverything, and for many months the arrangements that were made worked\r\nvirtually without a hitch.\r\n\r\nIf M. Zola's surroundings had altered, the routine of his life remained\r\nthe same as formerly. With regard to his novel 'Fecondite' he had, as the\r\nsaying goes, 'warmed to his work,' which he pursued at the Queen's Hotel\r\nwith unflagging energy.\r\n\r\nKnowing his habits I never (unless under exceptional circumstances)\r\nvisited him till he had finished his daily quantum of 'copy,' that was\r\nabout the luncheon hour. Then we would talk business, communicate to one\r\nanother such news as might be necessary, and at times exchange\r\nimpressions with regard to the incidents of the day.\r\n\r\nAmong other matters often discussed were the English birth-rate and the\r\nrearing of English children, points which deeply interested M. Zola, as\r\nthey were germane to the subject of 'Fecondite.' I could at first only\r\ngive him general information, but the Rev. R. Ussher, vicar of Westbury,\r\nBucks, the able author of 'Neo-Malthusianism,' very kindly sent me a copy\r\nof his exhaustive work, which contained many particulars on the points\r\nthat principally interested M. Zola. Moreover, Mr. George P. Brett, the\r\nPresident of the Macmillan Company of New York (M. Zola's American\r\npublishers), supplied him with some interesting information respecting\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nWith regard to England, M. Zola had been much struck by certain\r\nproceedings instituted during his exile against medical men, midwives,\r\nand others, proceedings which seemed to point to the existence in this\r\ncountry of a state of affairs much akin to that prevailing in France. The\r\naffair of the brothers Chrimes, who first sold bogus medicines and then\r\nproceeded to blackmail the women who had purchased them, was, in Zola's\r\nestimation, particularly significant, for here were hundreds and hundreds\r\nof Englishwomen applying to those men for the means of accomplishing the\r\ngreatest crime against Nature there could be.\r\n\r\nOn that point M. Zola spoke in no uncertain language. He understood well\r\nenough that the authorities could not justly single out a few of those\r\nhundreds of women for prosecution and punishment: but he censured the\r\nwomen quite as much as he censured the convicted men, who were, after\r\nall, but common scoundrels.\r\n\r\nAnd he was amazed to find that so few English newspapers ventured to\r\nspeak out on the matter. There were plenty of leaderettes on the cunning\r\nshown by the men, but the alacrity of the women to purchase the bogus\r\nmedicines was, as a rule, lightly passed over; and great as is M. Zola's\r\nadmiration for the English Press in many respects, he could but regard\r\nits attitude towards the Chrimes case as lamentably inadequate and\r\nlacking in moral courage.\r\n\r\n'A great responsibility,' said he, 'rests with those who, possessing\r\ncommanding influence, refrain from requisite action, and who, instead of\r\nseeking to cure proved and acknowledged evils, connive at driving them\r\nbeneath the surface, where, in secret, they steadily grow and expand.'\r\nAnd all this for the sake of the 'young person,' to whose mythical\r\ninnocence the welfare of a whole nation is often sacrificed. M. Zola's\r\nviews are summed up in the words: 'Let all be exposed and discussed, in\r\norder that all may be cured!'\r\n\r\nHe regards Neo-Malthusianism and its practices as abominable, and when he\r\nhad learnt more of the actual situation in England he was emphatically of\r\nopinion that his book 'Fecondite,' though applied to France alone, might\r\nwell, with little alteration, be applied to this country also.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations in the English birth-rate from 1872 to 1897 were to him\r\nfull of meaning. At a certain period, for instance, they showed all the\r\nharm wrought by the abominable Bradlaugh-Besant campaign. But what he\r\ndwelt on still more was the absolute physical incapacity of so many\r\nEnglish mothers to suckle their own offspring. Circumstances are much the\r\nsame both in France and the United States, at least among the older\r\nColonial families. In three or four generations the women of a family in\r\nwhich the practice of suckling has ceased, are altogether unable to give\r\nthe breast; and the 'bottle' ensues, with its thousand evils and a\r\ngradual deterioration of the race.\r\n\r\nOn the last occasion when James Russell Lowell came to England he was\r\nasked what change, if any, he remarked since his last visit, among the\r\npeople he met, and he replied that he was most struck by the falling off\r\nin height, and breadth of shoulders, of the average man in the London\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThough matters have not yet reached such a point as in France and\r\nelsewhere, it is I think incontestable that the English race, like many\r\nanother, is physically deteriorating. Athletics tend to improve the\r\nstandard, but there must be proper material to work upon, and M. Zola, I\r\nfound, held the view that for a race to be healthy its womenfolk should\r\nbe willing and able to discharge the primary duties of Nature. When he\r\ndiscovered that so many Englishwomen would not or could not suckle their\r\nbabes, he remarked that England had started on the same downward course\r\nas France.\r\n\r\nHe often watched the troops of nursemaids and children whom he met during\r\nhis afternoon strolls. He noticed and told me how many of the former\r\nneglected their charges, standing about, flirting or gossiping, or\r\nlooking into shop windows, while the baby in the bassinette or the\r\nmail-cart sucked away at that vile invention the bone and gutta-percha\r\n'soother,' and he was astonished that ladies should apparently consider\r\nit beneath them to accompany baby on the promenade. Indeed the invariable\r\nabsence of the mothers gave him a rather bad opinion of them: for surely\r\nthey must know that many of the nurse-girls neglected the infants and yet\r\nthey exercised no supervision. 'Of course,' said he, 'they are visiting\r\nor receiving, or reading novels, or bicycling or playing lawn tennis. Ah!\r\nwell, that is hardly my conception of a mother's duty towards her infant,\r\nwhatever be her station in life.'\r\n\r\nNow and again at intervals I accompanied him on his afternoon walks.\r\nThese generally took a semi-circular form. We descended from the plateau\r\nof Upper Norwood on one side to climb to it again on another. Sometimes\r\nwe passed by way of Beulah Spa, then round by some fields and a\r\nrecreation ground, with the name of which I am not acquainted. There were\r\nseveral shapely oak trees thereabouts, which he greatly admired and even\r\nphotographed.\r\n\r\n'Do you know,' he remarked to me one afternoon, 'when I come out all\r\nalone for my usual constitutional, and want to shake off some worrying\r\nthoughts, I often amuse myself by counting the number of hairpins which I\r\nsee lying on the foot-pavement. Oh! you need not laugh, it is very\r\ncurious, I assure you. I already had ideas for two essays--one on the\r\ncapital \"I\" in its relation to the English character, and another on the\r\nphysiology of the English \"guillotine\" window and the forms it affects,\r\nnot forgetting the circumstance that whenever an architect introduces a\r\nFrench window into an English house, it invariably opens outwardly so as\r\nto be well buffeted by the wind, instead of into the room as it should\r\ndo. Well, now I am beginning to think that I might write something on the\r\ncarelessness of Englishwomen in fastening up their hair, and the\r\nphenomenal consumption of hairpins in England. For the consumption must\r\nbe enormous since the loss is so great, as I will show you.'\r\n\r\nThen he proceeded to ocular demonstration. As we walked on for half an\r\nhour or so, principally along roads bordered by the umbrageous gardens of\r\nvilla residences, we counted all the hairpins we could see. There were\r\nabout four dozen. And he was careful to point out that we had chiefly\r\nfollowed a route where there was but a moderate amount of traffic.\r\n\r\nNot one man in a thousand probably would have thought of counting the\r\nlost hairpins in the streets; but then M. Zola is an observer, and if I\r\ntell this anecdote, which some may think puerile, it is by way of\r\nillustrating his powers of observation and the length to which he\r\noccasionally carries them.\r\n\r\nOn one point, I told him, he was rather in the wrong. The great loss of\r\nhairpins did not proceed so much from the carelessness of women in\r\nfastening their hair, as from their 'pennywise and pound-foolish' system\r\nof buying cheap hairpins with few and inefficient 'twists.' These cheap\r\nhairpins never 'caught' properly in their coiled-up tresses. The women\r\nwent out, walked rapidly, tossed their heads perchance, and one at least\r\nof their hairpins fell to the ground. Supposing one hundred women passed\r\nalong a certain road or street in the course of the day, it would not be\r\nsurprising to find that at least thirty hairpins were lost there. And I\r\nconcluded by saying that, to the best of my belief, the aforesaid\r\nhairpins were 'made in Germany.'\r\n\r\nAnother thing which amused and interested M. Zola when he took his walks\r\naround Norwood was to note the often curious and often high-sounding\r\nnames bestowed on villa residences. As a rule the smaller the place the\r\nmore grandiose the appellation bestowed on it. Some of the names M. Zola,\r\nhaving now made progress with his English, could readily understand;\r\nothers, too, were virtually French, such as Bellevue, Beaumont, and so\r\nforth; but there were several that I had to interpret, such as Oakdene,\r\nThornbrake, Beechcroft, Hillbrow, Woodcote, Fernside, Fairholme,\r\nInglenook, etc. And there was one name that I could not explain to him at\r\nall--an awful name, which I fancied might be Gaelic or Celtic, though I\r\nappealed in vain to Scottish, Irish, and Welsh friends for an\r\ninterpretation of its meaning. It was written thus: 'Ly-ee-Moon.'\r\n\r\nNobody of my acquaintance was able to explain it to me. M. Zola wrote it\r\ndown in his memorandum-book as an abstruse puzzle. However, while this\r\nnarrative was appearing in the 'Evening News,' several correspondents\r\nkindly informed me that Ly-ee-Moon (at times written 'Lai-Mun') was\r\nChinese, being the name of a narrow passage or strait between the island\r\nof Hong-Kong and the mainland of China (now transferred to Great\r\nBritain), at the eastern entrance to the harbour of the city of Victoria\r\non the island.\r\n\r\nIt seems also that Ly-ee-Moon is a name often given to ships sailing in\r\nthe China seas. And in the case of the Norwood house, built by a retired\r\nshipowner and sea captain, the name was taken from a vessel plying on the\r\nAustralian coast for many years, and ultimately wrecked with great loss\r\nof life. The owner of the Norwood house had an engraving of the ship\r\nexecuted on a plate-glass window of this hall. Until these explanations\r\nreached me both M. Zola and myself were quite as much at sea (with regard\r\nto 'Ly-ee-Moon') as ever its owner and captain was.\r\n\r\nWhen I spent an afternoon at Norwood with M. Zola we generally returned\r\nto the hotel about half-past four for a cup of tea. And on the way back\r\n(particularly during the last months) I frequently purchased postage\r\nstamps for him at the chief post-office. He might, of course, have bought\r\nthem himself, and as a matter of fact he did at times do so. But he was\r\naware, I think, that he was regarded with some suspicion by the young\r\nlady clerks under the control of the Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nAt certain periods, Christmas time and the New Year, for instance, M.\r\nZola's correspondence became extensive, and on the first occasion when he\r\nentered the Upper Norwood post-office and asked for fifty 2 1_2 d. stamps\r\nhe was looked at with surprise. When, a couple of days later, he applied\r\nfor another fifty, the young ladies eyed him as if he were a genuine\r\ncuriosity. A hundred 2 1_2 d. stamps in four days! What could he do with\r\nthem? Nobody could tell. When, shortly afterwards, he returned for\r\nanother supply of the same kind, the Norwood post-office was convulsed.\r\nAnd I doubt if even now some of the young ladies have quite got over that\r\nbrief but extraordinary run on the so-called 'foreign stamp.'\r\n\r\nI hope they do not imagine that M. Zola was hungry, and bought those\r\nstamps to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               XIII\r\n\r\n                            WINTER DAYS\r\n\r\nThe winter was hardly a cold one, but it proved very tempestuous, and\r\nUpper Norwood, standing high as it does, felt the full force of the\r\ngales. Christmas found M. Zola alone; still, this did not particularly\r\naffect him, as Christmas, save as a religious observance, is but little\r\nkept up in France, where festivity and holiday-making are reserved for\r\nthe New Year. In M. Zola's rooms the only token of the season was a huge\r\nbranch of mistletoe hanging over the chimney-piece. This he had bought\r\nhimself, after I had told him of the privileges attached to mistletoe in\r\nEngland. There were, however, no young ladies to kiss, and, if I remember\r\nrightly, Mme. Zola, who had been absent in Paris, did not return to\r\nNorwood until a day or two before the New Year.\r\n\r\nWhile her husband formed a fairly favourable opinion of England, its\r\ncustoms and its climate, Mme. Zola, I fear, was scarcely pleased with\r\nthis country. At all events, she finally left it vowing that she would\r\nnever return. But then for three or four weeks bronchitis and kindred\r\nailments had kept her absolutely imprisoned in her room--her illness\r\nlasting the longer, perhaps, because she was unwilling to place herself\r\nin the hands of any medical man.\r\n\r\nThe New Year was but a day or two old, when one of the London morning\r\nnewspapers announced with a great show of authority that an application\r\nfor the extradition of M. Zola was imminent. Somebody, moreover, informed\r\nthe same journal that he had recognised and interviewed M. Zola an\r\nevening or two previously, to which statement was appended a brief\r\naccount of some of M. Zola's views. All this amazed me the more as on the\r\nvery day mentioned in the newspaper I had been with the master till nine\r\nP.M. and I could hardly believe than anybody had interviewed him after\r\nthat hour. Moreover, my wife had since seen him, and he had said nothing\r\nto her of any visit or interview. Nevertheless, as other papers proceeded\r\nto copy the statements to which I have referred, I thought it well to\r\ncommunicate with our exile on the subject.\r\n\r\nThrough the carelessness of one of M. Zola's friends, Wareham's name and\r\naddress had lately been given to an English journalist usually resident\r\nin Paris, and this journalist had then come to London to try to discover\r\nthe master's whereabouts. It was therefore possible that there might be\r\nsome truth in the story. But M. Zola promptly wired to me that such was\r\nnot the case, and followed up his telegram with a note in which he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n'My dear confrere and friend,--I have just telegraphed to you that the\r\nwhole story of a journalist having interviewed me is purely and simply a\r\nfalsehood. I have seen nobody. Again, there can be no question of\r\nextradition in my case; all that could be done would be to serve me with\r\nthe judgment of the Assize Court. Those people don't even know what they\r\nwrite about.\r\n\r\n'As for -----'s indiscretion, this is to be regretted. I am writing to\r\nhim. For the sake of our communications, I have always desired that\r\nWareham's name and address should be known only to those on whom one can\r\ndepend. Tell him that he must remain on his guard and _never_ acknowledge\r\nthat he knows my address. Persevere in that course yourself. I will wait\r\na few days to see if anything occurs before deciding whether the\r\ncorrespondence arrangements should be altered. It would be a big affair;\r\nand I should afterwards regret a change if it were to prove uncalled for.\r\nLet us wait.'\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing through the many memoranda and notes I received from M. Zola during\r\nhis exile, I also find this, dated February: 'You did right to refuse Mr.\r\n----- my address. I absolutely decline to see anybody. No matter who may\r\ncall on you, under whatever pretext it be, preserve the silence of the\r\ntomb. Less than ever am I disposed to let people disturb me.'\r\n\r\nAgain, a little later: 'No; I will see neither the gentleman nor the\r\nlady. Tell them so distinctly, in order that they may worry you no more.'\r\n\r\nWith the New Year, it will be remembered, had come a succession of\r\nstartling events which kept M. Zola in a state of acute anxiety. The\r\nviolent attacks of the anti-Revisionists on the Criminal Chamber of the\r\nCour de Cassation culminated in the resignation of Q. de Beaurepaire, in\r\nan inquiry into the Criminal Chamber's methods of investigation, and\r\nfinally in the passing of a law which transferred the task of the\r\nCriminal Chamber to the whole of the Supreme Court. On the many intrigues\r\nof that period I often conversed with M. Zola, who was particularly\r\nangered by the blind opposition of President Faure and the impudent\r\nduplicity of Prime Minister Dupuy. These two were undoubtedly doing their\r\nutmost to impede the course of justice.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, on February 17, came a thunderbolt. Faure had died on the\r\nprevious evening, and by his death one of the greatest obstacles to the\r\ntriumph of truth was for ever removed. We talked of the defunct president\r\nat some length, M. Zola adhering to the opinions that he had expressed\r\nduring the summer.\r\n\r\nBut the great question was who would succeed M. Faure. When M. Brisson\r\nhad fallen from office after initiating the Revision proceedings, M. Zola\r\nhad said to me: 'Brisson's present fall does not signify; it was bound to\r\ncome. But hereafter he will reap his reward for his courage in favouring\r\nrevision. Brisson will be Faure's successor as President of the\r\nRepublic.'\r\n\r\nIn expressing this opinion M. Zola had imagined that Faure would live to\r\ncomplete his full term of office. His death in the very midst of the\r\nbattle entirely changed the position. M. Brisson's time had not come, and\r\nconsidering his age it indeed now seemed as if he might never attain to\r\nthe supreme magistracy. The future looked blank; but M. Loubet was\r\nelected President, and a feeling of great relief followed.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that M. Zola regards the death of President\r\nFaure as the crucial turning-point in the whole Dreyfus business. Had\r\nFaure lived every means would still have been employed to shield the\r\nguilty; all the influence of the Elysee would, as before, have been\r\nbrought to bear against the unhappy prisoner of Devil's Island.\r\n\r\nDuring those January and February days M. Zola was an eager reader of the\r\nnewspapers. Rumours of all kinds were in circulation, and once again in\r\nM. Zola's mind did despondency alternate with hopefulness. I must say,\r\nhowever, that he was not particularly impressed by Paul Deroulede's\r\nattempt to induce General Roget to march on the Elysee. He regards\r\nDeroulede as a scarcely sane individual, and holds views on Parisian\r\ndemonstrations which may surprise some of those who believe everything\r\nthey read in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nThese views may be epitomised as follows: The Government can always put\r\ndown trouble in the streets when it desires to do so. If trouble occurs\r\nit is because the Government allows it. Three-fourths of the\r\n'demonstrations' that have taken place in Paris during the last year or\r\ntwo have been simply 'got up' by professional agitators. The men who\r\nstart the shouting and the marching are paid for their services, the\r\ntariff being as a rule two francs per demonstration. With 500 francs,\r\nthat is 20 l., one can get 250 men together. These are joined by as many\r\nfools and a small contingent of enthusiasts, and then you have a rumpus\r\non the boulevards, and half the newspapers in Europe announcing on the\r\nmorrow: 'Serious Disturbances in Paris. Impending Revolution.' Some\r\npeople may ask, Where does the money for many of these demonstrations\r\ncome from? The answer is that it comes largely from much the same sources\r\nas those whence General Boulanger's funds were derived--that is, from the\r\nOrleanist party.\r\n\r\nAs for military insubordination, plotting, or anything of that kind, M.\r\nZola often pointed out to me that no general could effect a revolution,\r\nfor the simple reason that he could not rely on his men to follow him in\r\nan illegal attempt. It was quite possible that now and again other\r\ngenerals besides Boulanger had dreamt of overturning the Republic, but\r\nthey had not the means to do so. It was as likely as not that the officer\r\nfoolhardy enough to make the attempt would be shot in the back by some of\r\nthe Socialists among the rank and file. Boulanger no doubt could have\r\ncounted on a good many men and 'non-coms.,' as he was popular with them,\r\nbut few if any officers above the rank of captain would have followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTo-day, moreover, intense jealousy still reigns among the French general\r\nofficers. There is not one among them of sufficient pre-eminence and\r\npopularity to gather round him a large contingent of military men of high\r\nrank for any political purpose. And this, of course--quite apart from the\r\nopinions of the masses--largely makes for a continuance of the Republican\r\nregime.\r\n\r\nWith a weak Government in office, one with a policy of drift, everything\r\nmay become possible; but, so long as foresight and vigilance are shown,\r\nthe Republic remains impregnable. If military malcontents become\r\nobstreperous it is only necessary to treat them as General Boulanger was\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nI recollect hearing M. Yves Guyot, who was a member of the Cabinet which\r\nput down 'the brave general on the black horse,' and who was also one of\r\nthe few French friends who visited M. Zola during his exile, give a brief\r\naccount of some of the decisive steps which were taken to stop the\r\nBoulangist agitation. The Prefect of Police of that time was summoned to\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior, where two or three members of the\r\nGovernment awaited his arrival. Amongst other orders given him was one\r\n(if I remember rightly) for the dissolution of M. Deroulede's 'League of\r\nPatriots,' which then, as more recently, was at the bottom of much of the\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect hesitated; he was afraid to execute his orders. 'Very well,\r\nthen,' said M. Constans, M. Guyot, and others, 'you may regard your\r\nresignation as accepted; you are not the man for the situation; if you\r\nare afraid, there are plenty who are not; and we shall immediately\r\nreplace you.'\r\n\r\nThe threat of the loss of office wrought an immediate change in the\r\nPrefect. He became as brave as he had been timorous, and with all due\r\nenergy he proceeded to carry out his instructions. Boulangism was crushed\r\nand held up to public opprobrium and ridicule; and but for the culpable\r\nweakness and connivance of M. Felix Faure and his favourite Prime\r\nMinister, M. Meline, it would never have revived in its varied forms of\r\nanti-Semitism, anti-Dreyfusism, etc.\r\n\r\nFrench functionaries, those of the Civil Service, are, as a rule, a\r\ndocile set; but every now and again a Government finding some laxity\r\namong prefects and sub-prefects makes a few examples. Three or four\r\nprefects of departments are transferred in disgrace to less important\r\ntowns; two or three are cashiered, and the same method is followed with\r\nsome of the sub-prefects. Thereupon, all the others, prefects and 'subs,'\r\nthroughout the eighty and odd departments of France, hasten to show\r\nthemselves vigilant and, if need be, energetic. Taking one consideration\r\nwith another, this system of frightening the prefects into obedience and\r\nvigilance has, so far as the maintenance of public order is concerned,\r\nanswered admirably well whenever it has been applied during the last\r\nfifty years. It has undoubtedly been adopted at times for the furtherance\r\nof purely despotic or arbitrary aims; but if ever it was justified such\r\nwas the case during the Dreyfus agitation. If the Government had not\r\nconnived, for purposes of its own, at the proceedings of what the French\r\ncall the 'militarist' party, there would have been no turmoil at all.\r\n\r\nBut those in power desired to shield culprits of high rank and to defend\r\nthe effete organisation of the French War-office. And those who thus\r\nmisused the power they held, who sacrificed the national interests, who\r\ntrampled truth and justice under foot, and rendered their country an\r\nobject of amazement, distrust, and ridicule throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of Europe (Russia not excepted) will be censured and condemned in\r\nno uncertain voice by the France of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nBut I am forgetting the prefects and sub-prefects. I mentioned them\r\npartly because M. Zola himself might have been one of them. It is not\r\ngenerally known, I believe, that at the time of the Franco-German war he\r\nin some degree assisted one of the sub-prefects in the discharge of his\r\nduties, and (had he only so chosen) might even have become a sub-prefect\r\nhimself. He had been an opposition, a Republican journalist, before the\r\nfall of the Empire, and M. Gambetta, during his virtual dictatorship\r\nthroughout the latter part of the Franco-German war, was very fond of\r\nappointing journalists of that description to office, both in the army\r\nand the Civil Service. M. Zola, then, might have become a sub-prefect to\r\nbegin with; and, later, a full-blown prefect. Picture him in a cocked hat\r\nand a uniform bedizened with gold lace, and with a slender sword dangling\r\nby his side. That, at all events, was how sub-prefects and prefects used\r\nto array themselves when 'in the exercise of their functions.'\r\n\r\nI doubt of M. Zola would ever have made a good functionary. His character\r\nis too independent, and in all likelihood he would have resigned the very\r\nfirst time that he happened to have 'a few words' with his Minister. But\r\npolitics having caught him in their grasp he would doubtless (like the\r\nfew functionaries of independent views who throw up their posts in\r\nFrance) have next come forward as a candidate for the Chamber or the\r\nSenate. And then--why not? He might have been an Under-Secretary of\r\nState, later a Minister, and finally President of the Republic. True, as\r\nhe himself knows, and readily admits, he is no orator; but then orators\r\nare not always the men who get on in France. Thiers was a ready and\r\nfluent speaker, but MacMahon could scarcely say (or learn by heart)\r\ntwenty consecutive words. Grevy, it is true, could be long-winded, prosy,\r\nand didactic; but the powers of elocution which Carnot and Felix Faure\r\npossessed were infinitesimal. And so the idea of Emile Zola, President of\r\nthe Republic, may not be so far-fetched after all, particularly when one\r\nremembers Zola's great powers of observation, analysis, and foresight.\r\n\r\nHad he taken to politics in his younger days he would at least have made\r\nhis mark in the career thus chosen. And it may be that, in some respects,\r\nFrench public life might then have been healthier than it has proved\r\nduring the last quarter of a century. Perchance, too, on the other hand,\r\nmany old maids and young persons, not to mention ecclesiastics and\r\nvigilance societies, would have been spared manifold pious ejaculations\r\nand gasps of horror. Again, my poor father--imprisoned, ruined, and\r\nhounded to his death--might still have been alive.\r\n\r\nUnless some other courageous man had arisen to tear the veil away from\r\nbefore human life, such as it is in so-called civilised communities, and\r\nshow society its own self in all its rottenness, foulness, and\r\nhypocrisy--so that on more than one occasion, shrinking guiltily from its\r\nown image, it has denounced the plain unvarnished truth as libel--there\r\nwould have been no 'Nana' and no 'Pot Bouille,' no 'Assommoir,' and no\r\n'Germinal.' And no 'La Terre.' 'La Debacle,' and 'Lourdes,' and 'Rome,'\r\n'Paris,' and 'Fecondite,' and all the other books that have flowed from\r\nEmile Zola's busy pen would have remained unwritten. But for my own part\r\nI would rather that the world should possess those books than that Zola\r\nwhen tempted, as he was, should have cast literature aside to plunge into\r\nthe abominable and degrading vortex of politics.\r\n\r\nLike all men of intellect he certainly has his views on important\r\npolitical questions, and again and again he has enunciated them in the\r\nface of fierce opposition. In the Dreyfus case, however, he has been no\r\npolitician, but simply the indignant champion of an innocent man. And his\r\ntask over, truth and justice vindicated, he asks no reward, no office; he\r\nsimply desires to take up his pen once more and revert to his life\r\nwork:--The delineation and exposure of the crimes, follies, and\r\nshort-comings of society as now constituted, in order that those who\r\n_are_ in politics, who control human affairs, may, in full knowledge of\r\nexisting evils, do their utmost to remedy them and prepare the way for a\r\nbetter and a happier world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                XIV\r\n\r\n                     'WAITING FOR THE VERDICT'\r\n\r\nI can still see before me the sitting-room on the second floor of the\r\nQueen's Hotel, in which M. Zola spent so much of his time and wrote so\r\nmany pages of 'Fecondite' during the last six months or so of his exile.\r\nA spacious room it was, if a rather low one, with three windows\r\noverlooking the road which passes the hotel.\r\n\r\nA very large looking-glass in a gilt frame surmounted the mantelpiece, on\r\nwhich stood two or three little blue vases. Paper of a light colour and a\r\nlarge flowing arabesque pattern with a broad frieze covered the walls.\r\nThere was not a single picture of any kind in the room, neither steel\r\nengraving, nor lithograph, nor chromo; and remembering what pictures\r\nusually are, even in the best of hotels, it was perhaps just as well that\r\nthere should have been none in that room at the Queen's. Yet during the\r\nmany hours I spent there the bareness of the walls often worried me.\r\n\r\nAgainst the one that faced the fireplace stood a small sideboard. Then on\r\nanother side was a sofa, and here and there were half a dozen chairs. The\r\nroom was rich in tables, it counted no fewer than five. On a folding\r\ncard-table in one corner M. Zola's stock of letter and 'copy' paper, his\r\nweighing scales for letters, his envelopes, pens, and pencils, were duly\r\nset out. Then in front of the central window was the table at which he\r\nworked every morning. It was of mahogany, little more than three feet\r\nlong and barely two feet wide. Whenever he raised his eyes from his\r\nwriting, he could see the road below him, and the houses across the way.\r\nOn a similar table at another of the windows he usually kept such books\r\nand reviews as reached him from France.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the room, under the electric lights--which, however,\r\nwere only fitted towards the end of M. Zola's sojourn at the hotel, so\r\nthat throughout the winter a paraffin lamp supplied the necessary\r\nillumination--stood the table at which one lunched and dined. It was\r\nround and would just accommodate four persons. Finally, beside M. Zola's\r\nfavourite arm-chair, near the fireplace, was a little gipsy table, on\r\nwhich he usually kept the day's newspapers, and perchance the volume he\r\nwas reading at the time.\r\n\r\nA doorway on the same side as the fireplace gave ingress to the\r\nbedchamber, which was smaller than the sitting-room, and adequately, but\r\nby no means luxuriously furnished.\r\n\r\nOn the little writing-table near the middle window were first a small\r\ninkstand belonging to the hotel, then a few paper-weights covering\r\nmemoranda jotted down on little square pieces of paper, about three\r\ninches long either way, together with an old yellowish newspaper which\r\ndid duty as a blotting pad; and a pen with a 'j' nib and a very heavy\r\nivory handle, so heavy, indeed, that though the master often offered it\r\nto me I could never write with it. With this pen, however, he himself did\r\nall his work. That work he generally cleared away before lunch, and\r\nlocked up in his bedroom wardrobe, so that by the time a visitor arrived\r\nthere was never any litter in the sitting-room.\r\n\r\nThe road, viewed from the writing-table window, was at times fairly\r\nlively. Nursemaids and children, bicyclists and others passed constantly\r\nto and fro. Stylish carriages also rolled by during the afternoon, and at\r\nintervals a little green omnibus went its way at a slow jog-trot. The\r\ndetached villa residences on the other side of the road were, however,\r\nsingularly lifeless. One day M. Zola remarked to me: 'I have never seen a\r\nsoul in those houses during all the months I have been here. They are\r\noccupied certainly, for the window blinds are pulled up every morning and\r\nlowered every evening, but I can never detect who does this; and I have\r\nnever seen anybody leave the houses or enter them.'\r\n\r\nAt last one afternoon he told me that one of these villas had woke up,\r\nfor on the previous day he had espied a lady in the garden watering some\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nRather lower down the road there was a livelier house, one which had a\r\nbalconied window, which was almost invariably open, and here servants and\r\nchildren were often to be seen. 'That,' said M. Zola, 'is the one little\r\ncorner of life and gaiety, amidst all the other silence and lack of life.\r\nWhenever I feel dull or worried I look over there.'\r\n\r\nAs a rule the Queen's Hotel itself is, as I have already mentioned, a\r\nvery quiet place; but now and again a wedding breakfast was given there.\r\nBroughams and landaus would then roll over the gravel sweep, and M. Zola\r\nand I would at times lean out of the windows and exchange opinions with\r\nrespect to the bridal pair and the guests. What surprised and amused him,\r\non one occasion when a wedding party came to the hotel, was to notice\r\nthat all the coachmen of the carriages wore yellow flowers and favours;\r\nfor in France yellow is not only associated with jealousy, but also with\r\nconjugal faithlessness.\r\n\r\n'If those flowers ware to be taken as an omen,' said M. Zola to me, 'that\r\nhappy pair will soon be in the Divorce Court.'\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of his stay at Norwood, when the door between his\r\nbedroom and sitting-room remained open, one could see on a chest of\r\ndrawers in the former apartment a pair of life-size porcelain cats,\r\ncoloured a purplish maroon, with sparkling yellow glass eyes, and an\r\nabundance of fantastic yellow spots. These cats had been bought by him as\r\na souvenir of England and English art, for he was much struck by their\r\noddity. He had been offered others--for instance, white ones with little\r\ncoloured landscapes printed all over their backs and sides--surely as\r\nidiotic an embellishment as any insane potter could devise--but although\r\nthese had sorely tempted him he had finally decided in favour of the\r\nmaroon and yellow abominations.\r\n\r\nA little girl of mine, who found herself face to face with these cats one\r\nday in his room, was quite startled by them, and has since expressed the\r\nopinion that Sir John Tenniel ought to have seen them before he drew the\r\nCheshire cat for 'Alice in Wonderland.' For my own part I can imagine the\r\nlaughter and the jeers of M. Zola's artistic friends when those choice\r\nspecimens of British art are shown to them in Paris.\r\n\r\nAt intervals during his long sojourn at the Queen's Hotel M. Zola\r\nreceived a few brief visits from French friends, chiefly literary men and\r\npoliticians, whose names need not be mentioned, but who have identified\r\nthemselves with the cause of Revision. At times these gentlemen found\r\nthemselves in London on other matters, and profited by the opportunity to\r\nrun down to Norwood. On other occasions they made the journey from France\r\nfor the especial purpose of quieting M. Zola's impatience, and telling\r\nhim that he must not yet think of returning home. Again, M. Fasquelle,\r\nthe French publisher, came over four or five times, now on business and\r\nnow in a friendly way.\r\n\r\nI think that during the seven or eight months that M. Zola stayed at the\r\nQueen's Hotel, he received altogether some ten visits from compatriots,\r\nwhich visits were often of only an hour or two's duration. Thus, Mme.\r\nZola having returned to France, he was frequently very much alone.\r\n\r\nDuring the last months of his exile my wife fell seriously ill, and I\r\ncould not then go so often to Norwood. Afterwards ague caught me in its\r\ngrip, and my visits ceased for two or three successive weeks. All I could\r\ndo in an emergency was to place my eldest daughter or my son at M. Zola's\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nThe foreign visitors he received--by foreign I mean non-French--were\r\n(apart from the Warehams, myself and family) very few in number. I think\r\nthat an eminent Russian _publiciste_ who happened to be a personal friend\r\n(M. Zola has long been popular in Russia, where even the Emperor has read\r\nmany of his books) saw him on one occasion. Then, when M. Yves Guyot\r\ncalled, he brought with him an English friend who was pledged to secrecy.\r\n\r\nA well-known English novelist and art critic, M. Zola's oldest English\r\nfriend, and his earliest champion in this country, likewise saw him.\r\nFurther, in a friendly capacity he received an English journalist for\r\nwhom he has much regard, and who came to see him quite apart from any\r\njournalistic matters. To this list I will add the names of Mr. Andrew\r\nChatto and Mr. Percy Spalding of Messrs. Chatto and Windus, and Mr.\r\nGeorge P. Brett, of the Macmillan Company of New York.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were M. Zola's visitors and guests--say, apart from the\r\nWarehams, myself and family, less than a score of persons, the total\r\nduration of whose visits added together amounted perhaps to a hundred and\r\ntwenty hours spread over many long and trying months.\r\n\r\nAt times when we chatted together, M. Zola and myself, and mention was\r\nmade of his friends--of persons occasionally whom we both knew--he\r\nreferred to the many estrangements caused by the divergence of views on\r\nthe Dreyfus affair. Friends of twenty and thirty years' standing, men who\r\nhad laboured sided by side often in pursuit of the same ideal, had not\r\nonly quarrelled and parted but had assailed each other with the greatest\r\nvirulence in the Press and at public meetings.\r\n\r\nMany whom he himself had regarded as close and sincere friends had\r\ntrodden upon all the past and attacked him abominably, as though he were\r\nthe veriest scum of the earth. Some in the earlier stages of the affair\r\nhad hypocritically feigned sympathy, in order to provoke his confidence,\r\nand had then turned round to hold him up to execration and ridicule. One\r\nor two had behaved so badly that he had refused ever to receive them at\r\nhis house again.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to me of an eminent French _litterateur_ who at the outset of\r\nthe agitation on behalf of Dreyfus had immediately promised his help, and\r\nhad even prepared articles and appeals on behalf of the prisoner of\r\nDevil's Island. But this _litterateur_ had of recent years been lapsing\r\ninto mysticism, and at the behests of the reverend father his confessor,\r\nhe had abruptly destroyed what he had written, and gone over to the other\r\nside to wage desperate warfare upon the cause he had promised to help.\r\n\r\nThe writer in question (one who will probably leave a name in French\r\nliterature) was tortured by the everlasting fear that he might go to hell\r\nwhen he died, and he was the more timorous, the more easily influenced by\r\ncertain persons, as he suffered from a horrible, incurable complaint, and\r\nfeared that his medical man--a bigoted Romanist--might abandon him to all\r\nthe pangs of sudden death if he did not comply with the injunctions of\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nThen there was a friend of many years' standing, a Minister in successive\r\nCabinets, who feigned that by remaining in office he would be able to\r\nfavour the cause, and who, instead of that, did his utmost against it. A\r\nplaywright wrote: 'I am heartily with you, but for God's sake don't say\r\nit, for my plays might be hissed.'* Another prominent man started on a\r\nlong journey to avoid having to express any opinion. Nearly all the baser\r\npassions of humanity were made manifest in some degree--treachery,\r\nrancour, jealousy, and moral and physical cowardice.\r\n\r\n  * Apropos of the stage, it is a curious circumstance that\r\n    nine-tenths of 'the profession' in France are ardent Dreyfusards.\r\n    Nearly every actor and actress and vocalist of note has been\r\n    on the same side as M. Zola from the outset.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, there was another and a brighter side to the picture.\r\nThere were men of high intellect and courage who had not hesitated to\r\nstate their views and plead for truth and justice, men who, when in\r\noffice, had been arbitrarily suspended and removed. There were many who\r\nhad risked their futures, many too who, after years of labour, were well\r\nentitled to rest and retirement, yet had come forward with all the ardour\r\nof youth to do battle for great principles and save their country from\r\nthe shame of a cruel crime.\r\n\r\nAdversity makes one acquainted with strange bedfellows, and M. Zola was\r\nmore than once struck by the heterogeneous nature of the Revisionist\r\narmy. He found men of such varied political and social views banded\r\ntogether for the cause. It all helped to remove sundry old-time\r\nprejudices of his.\r\n\r\nFor instance, he said to me one day: 'I never cared much for the French\r\nProtestants; I regarded them as people of narrow minds, fanatics of a\r\nkind, far less tolerant and human than the great mass of the Catholics.\r\nBut they have behaved splendidly in this battle of ours, and shown\r\nthemselves to be real men.'\r\n\r\nAll through the spring M. Zola eagerly followed the inquiry which the\r\nCour de Cassation was conducting, and when M. Ballot-Beaupre was\r\nappointed reporter to the Court, there came a fresh spell of anxiety. M.\r\nBallot-Beaupre is a man of natural piety, and the anti-Revisionist\r\nnewspapers, basing themselves on his religious views, at first made\r\ncertain that he would show no mercy to the Jew Dreyfus, but would report\r\nstrongly in favour of the prisoner's guilt. Certain Dreyfusite journals,\r\non the other hand, bitterly attacked the learned judge for his supposed\r\nclerical leanings; and indeed so much was insinuated that M. Zola for a\r\nshort time half believed it possible that M. Ballot-Beaupre might show\r\nhimself hostile to revision.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw M. Zola he repeatedly expressed to me his feelings of\r\ndisquietude. Then everything suddenly changed. Certain newspapers\r\ndiscovered that M. Ballot-Beaupre, if pious, was by no means a fanatic,\r\nand, further, that he was a very sound lawyer, much respected by his\r\ncolleagues. This cleared the atmosphere, for it seemed impossible that\r\nany man of rectitude and judgment could pass over the damning revelations\r\nwhich the Cour de Cassation's inquiry, as published in 'Le Figaro,' had\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nTime went on, and at last the issue, so frequently postponed, so\r\nlongingly awaited, came in sight. The week before the public proceedings\r\nof the Cour de Cassation opened M. Zola said to me: 'I shall have\r\nfinished the last chapter of \"Fecondite\" by Saturday or Sunday, so I\r\nshall have my hands quite free and be able to give all my attention to\r\nwhat takes place at the Courts. I am hopeful, yes, very hopeful, and yet\r\nat moments some horrid doubt will spring up to torture me. But no! you'll\r\nsee, our cause will gain the day, revision will be granted, and justice\r\nwill be done.'\r\n\r\nAnd at last came the fateful week which was to prove the accuracy of his\r\nsurmises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XV\r\n\r\n                        LAST DAYS--DEPARTURE\r\n\r\nI spent the afternoon of Saturday, May 27, with M. Zola, and we then\r\nspoke of the proceedings impending before the Cour de Cassation. All our\r\ninformation pointed to the conclusion that the Court would give judgment\r\non the Saturday following, and it was decided that M. Zola should return\r\nto France a few days afterwards. The date ultimately agreed upon was\r\nTuesday, June 6, and the train selected was that leaving Charing Cross\r\nfor Folkestone at 2.45 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThough according to every probability the Court's judgment would be in\r\nfavour of revision, M. Zola was resolved to return home whatever might be\r\nthe issue, and such were his feelings on the matter that nothing any\r\nfriend might have urged would have prevented him from doing so. As a\r\nmatter of fact one friend did regard the return as somewhat unwise, and\r\nintimated it both by telegram and letter. This compelled me to see M.\r\nZola again on the following Tuesday (May 30), but the objections were\r\noverruled by him, and the arrangements which had been planned were\r\nadhered to.\r\n\r\nM. Zola had now drafted the declaration which he proposed issuing on the\r\nmorrow of his return home, and this he gave me to read. It was the\r\narticle 'Justice,' published in 'L'Aurore,' to which I have occasionally\r\nreferred in the course of the present narrative.\r\n\r\nI left M. Zola rather late that Tuesday night in the expectation that\r\neverything which had been arranged would follow in due course. As the\r\nwriting of 'Fecondite' was now finished he had time on his hands, and a\r\npart of this he proposed to devote to taking a few final snapshots of\r\nNorwood, the Crystal Palace, and surrounding scenery. He needed something\r\nto do, for he could not sit hour by hour in his room at the Queen's Hotel\r\nanxiously waiting for news of the proceedings at the Paris Palais de\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\nFor my part I had begun to prepare the present narrative, and as he would\r\nnot listen to my repeated offers to take him to the Derby, it was\r\narranged that I should not see him again until the end of the week. On\r\nFriday, however, reports were already in circulation to the effect that\r\nM. Fasquelle (M. Zola's French publisher) had come to London for the\r\npurpose of escorting him home.\r\n\r\nThis was true, and I foresaw that the rumours might lead to some\r\nmodifications of our programme; for M. Zola did not wish his return to\r\nhave any public character. He had forbidden all the demonstrations which\r\nhis friends in Paris were anxious to arrange in his honour, declaring\r\nthat he desired to go back quietly and privately, and then at once place\r\nhimself at the disposal of the public prosecutor.\r\n\r\nOn Friday I sent my daughter Violette to Norwood with a parcel of M.\r\nZola's photographs, received by Messrs. Chatto and Windus from Miss Loie\r\nFuller, who being greatly interested in the Clarence Ward of St. Mary's\r\nHospital, particularly wished M. Zola to sign these portraits in order\r\nthat they might be sold at a bazaar which was to be held for the benefit\r\nof the hospital referred to. I told my daughter that I should myself go\r\ndown to the Queen's Hotel on the morrow, and she brought me back a\r\nmessage to the effect that I really must go, as complications had arisen,\r\nand M. Zola particularly desired to see me.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Saturday, I therefore betook myself to Norwood with\r\na parcel of M. Zola's books, which I had received from Messrs. Macmillan\r\n& Co. on behalf of the Countess of Bective, who (prompted by the same\r\nspirit as Miss Loie Fuller) wished to sell these volumes at the\r\n'Bookland' stall on the occasion of the Charing Cross Hospital Bazaar.\r\nAnd when I arrived I found indeed that it was most desirable that the\r\nprogramme of M. Zola's departure should be modified.\r\n\r\nHe had already seen M. and Mme. Fasquelle, the former of whom was much\r\nannoyed at the reports of his presence in London, and thought it most\r\nadvisable to precipitate the departure. Delay might, indeed, be harmful\r\nif it was desired to avoid demonstrations. Besides, why should he wait\r\nuntil the ensuing Tuesday? Why not return the very next night--that of\r\nSunday, June 4--by the Dover and Calais route? Mme. Fasquelle had\r\ndeclared that she in no way objected to travelling at night time; and so\r\nfar as the departure from London was concerned, there would be few people\r\nabout on a Sunday evening, which was another point to be considered. I\r\ncordially assented, for now that the imminence of M. Zola's return to\r\nParis had been reported in the newspapers it was certain that delay meant\r\na possibility of demonstrations both for and against him. In spite of his\r\nprohibition, many of his friends still wished to greet him like a\r\nconquering hero on his arrival at the Northern Railway Station in Paris.\r\nAnd the other side would unfailingly send out its recruiting agents to\r\nassemble a contingent of loafers at two francs per demonstration, who\r\nwould be duly instructed to yell 'Conspuez,' and 'A bas les juifs.' Then\r\na brawl would inevitably follow.\r\n\r\nNow M. Zola (as I have already mentioned) did not wish for a homecoming\r\nof that kind. There was no question of refusing to 'face the music,' of\r\nshunning a hostile crowd, and so forth. It was purely and simply a matter\r\nof dignity and of doing nothing that might lead to a disturbance of the\r\npublic peace. The triumph of justice was undoubtedly imminent, and it\r\nmust not be followed by disorder.\r\n\r\nWhen I had expressed my concurrence in the views held by M. Zola and M.\r\nFasquelle, M. Zola and I attended to business. First came the question of\r\nLady Bective's books, in each of which a suitable inscription was\r\ninserted. Afterwards, in a friend's birthday book M. Zola inscribed his\r\nfamous, epoch-making phrase, 'Truth is on the march, and nothing will be\r\nable to stop it.' Finally, a few brief notes were written and posted, and\r\nwork was over.\r\n\r\nFor a little while we chatted together. Some notable incidents connected\r\nwith the interminable Affair had occurred during the last few days.\r\nColonel du Paty de Clam, for whose arrest the Revisionist journals had\r\nclamoured so long and so pertinaciously, had at last been cast into\r\nprison. In M. Zola's estimation, the Colonel's arrest had been merely a\r\nquestion of time ever since the day when one had learnt that he had\r\ndisguised himself with a false beard and blue glasses when he went to\r\nmeet the notorious Esterhazy.\r\n\r\n'A man may be guilty of any misdeed and may yet find forgiveness and even\r\nfavour,' M. Zola had then said to me, 'but he must not make himself, his\r\nprofession, and his cause ridiculous. In France, as you know, \"ridicule\r\nkills.\" The false beard and the blue spectacles, following the veiled\r\nlady, are decisive. One need scarcely trouble any further about M. du\r\nPaty de Clam. His fate is as good as sealed.'\r\n\r\nAnd now that the Colonel had at last been arrested, the master remarked,\r\n'The military party is throwing him over to us as a kind of sop; it would\r\nbe delighted to make him the general scapegoat, and thereby save all the\r\nother culprits. But it won't do. There are men higher placed than Du Paty\r\nwho must bear their share of censure and, if need be, punishment.'\r\n\r\nThen we spoke of Esterhazy, 'that fine type for a melodrama or a novel of\r\nthe romantic school,' as M. Zola often remarked. The Commandant had just\r\nacknowledged to the 'Times' and the 'Daily Chronicle' that the famous\r\n_bordereau_ had been penned by him, and we laughed at the remembrance of\r\nhis squabbles on this subject with the proprietress of another newspaper.\r\nHow indignantly he had then denied having ever acknowledged the\r\nauthorship of the _bordereau_, and how complacently he now admitted it!\r\nAs for the circumstances under which he asserted the document to have\r\nbeen written, M. Zola could make nothing of them. 'So far, the\r\nexplanations explain nothing,' said he; 'take them whichever way you\r\nwill, there is no sense, no plausibility even, in them. Hitherto I always\r\nthought Esterhazy a very shrewd and clever man, but after reading his\r\nstatements in the \"Times\" and the \"Chronicle\" I no longer know what to\r\nthink. Still, one point is gained; he admits having written the\r\n_bordereau_, and others hereafter will tell us the exact circumstances\r\nunder which he did so. Colonel Sandherr, at whose bidding he says he\r\nwrote it, is dead; but others who know a great deal about him are still\r\nalive.'\r\n\r\nWhile M. Zola thus expressed himself, we sat face to face, he in his\r\nfavourite arm chair on one side of the fireplace, and I on the other, in\r\nthe familiar room, with its three windows overlooking the lively road,\r\nwhile all around curvetted the scrolls and arabesques of the light\r\nfawn-tinted wall paper. And after chatting about Du Paty and Esterhazy we\r\ngradually lapsed into silence. It was a fateful hour. There were\r\nninety-nine probabilities out of a hundred that the decision of the Cour\r\nde Cassation would be given that same afternoon; and whatever that\r\ndecision might be we felt certain that before it was made public by any\r\nnewspaper in London we should be apprised of it. We knew that five\r\nminutes after judgment should have been pronounced a telegram would be\r\nspeeding through the wires to the Queen's Hotel, Norwood.\r\n\r\nM. Zola did not tell me his thoughts, yet I could guess them. We can\r\ngenerally guess the thoughts of those we love. But the hours went by and\r\nnothing came. How long they were, those judges! Whatever could be the\r\ncause of their delay? Surely--trained, practised men that they were, men\r\nwho had spent their lives in seeking and proclaiming the truth--surely no\r\nelement of doubt could have penetrated their minds at the final, the\r\nsupreme moment.\r\n\r\nAh! the waiter entered, and there on his salver lay a buff envelope,\r\nwithin which must surely be the ardently awaited message that would tell\r\nus of victory or defeat. M. Zola could scarcely tear that envelope open;\r\nhis hands trembled violently. And then came an anti-climax. The wire was\r\nfrom M. Fasquelle, who announced that he and his wife were inviting\r\nthemselves to dinner at Norwood that evening.\r\n\r\nIt was welcome news, but not the news so impatiently expected. And, at\r\nlast, suspense become intolerable, I resolved to go out and try to\r\npurchase some afternoon newspapers.\r\n\r\nThere had been rumours to the effect that as each individual judge might\r\npreface his decision by a declaration of the reasons which prompted it,\r\nthe final judgment might after all be postponed until Monday. Both M.\r\nZola and I had thought this improbable; still, there was a possibility of\r\nsuch delay, and perhaps it was on account of a postponement of the kind\r\nthat the telegram we awaited had not arrived.\r\n\r\nI scoured Upper Norwood for afternoon papers. There was, however, nothing\r\nto the point at that hour (about five P.M.) in 'The Evening News,' the\r\n'Globe,' the 'Echo,' the 'Star,' the 'Sun,' the three 'Gazettes.' They,\r\nlike we, were 'waiting for the verdict.' I went as far as the lower level\r\nstation in the hope of finding some newspaper that might give an inkling\r\nof the position, and I found nothing at all. It was extremely warm, and I\r\nwas somewhat excited. Thus I was perspiring terribly by the time I\r\nreturned to the hotel, to learn that no telegram had come as yet, that\r\nthings were still _in statu quo_.\r\n\r\nThen all at once the waiter came up again with another buff envelope\r\nlying on his plated salver. And this time our anticipations were\r\nrealised; here at last was the expected news. M. Zola read the telegram,\r\nthen showed it to me.\r\n\r\nIt was brief, but sufficient. 'Cheque postponed,' it said; and Zola knew\r\nwhat those words meant. 'Cheque paid' would have signified that not only\r\nhad revision been granted, but that all the proceedings against Dreyfus\r\nwere quashed, and that he would not even have to be re-tried by another\r\ncourt-martial. And in a like way 'cheque unpaid' would have meant that\r\nrevision had been refused by the Court. 'Cheque postponed' implied the\r\ngranting of revision and a new court-martial.\r\n\r\nThe phraseology of this telegram, as of previous ones, had long since\r\nbeen arranged. For months many seemingly innocent 'wires' had been full\r\nof meaning. There had been no more enigmatical telegrams, as at the time\r\nof Henry's arrest and death, but telegrams drafted in accordance with M.\r\nZola's instructions and each word of which was perfectly intelligible to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt often happened that the newspaper correspondents 'were not in it.'\r\nThings were known to M. Zola and at times to myself hours--and even\r\ndays--before there was any mention of them in print. The blundering\r\nanti-Dreyfusites have often if not invariably overlooked the fact that\r\ntheir adversaries number men of acumen, skill, and energy. Far from it\r\nbeing true that money has played any role in the affair, everything has\r\nvirtually been achieved by brains and courage. In fact, from first to\r\nlast, the Revisionist agitation, whilst proving that the Truth must\r\nalways ultimately conquer, has likewise shown the supremacy of true\r\nintellect over every other force in the world, whether wealth, or\r\ninfluence, or fanaticism.\r\n\r\nBut I must return to M. Zola. He now knew all he wished to know. As there\r\nhad been no postponement of the Court's decision there need be none of\r\nhis return. A telegram to Paris announcing his departure from London was\r\nhastily drafted and I hurried with it to the post-office, meeting on my\r\nway M. and Mme. Fasquelle, who were walking towards the Queen's Hotel.\r\n\r\nWe had a right merry little dinner that evening. We were all in the best\r\nof humours. M. Zola's face was radiant. A great victory had been won; and\r\nthen, too, he was going home!\r\n\r\nHe recalled the more amusing incidents of his exile; it seemed to him,\r\nsaid he, as if for months and months he had been living in a dream.\r\n\r\nAnd M. Fasquelle broke in with a reminder that M. Zola must be very\r\ncareful when he reached his house, and must in no wise damage the\r\nhistoric table for which he, Fasquelle, had given such a pile of money at\r\nthe memorable auction in the Rue de Bruxelles.\r\n\r\nAh, that table! We were in a mood to laugh about anything, and we laughed\r\nat the thought of the table; at the thought, too, of all the\r\nsimple-minded folk who had imagined that they would be able to purchase\r\n'souvenirs' at the auction so abruptly brought to an end.\r\n\r\nThen the Fasquelles, having been to the Oaks on the previous day, began\r\nto talk of Epsom, and the scene, unique in the whole world, which the\r\nfamous racecourse presents during Derby week. M. Zola half regretted that\r\nhe had missed going. 'But I will go everywhere and see everything,' he\r\nrepeated, 'the next time I come to England. I shall then be able to do so\r\nopenly, without any playing at hide and seek. Oh, it won't be till after\r\nthe Paris Exhibition, that is certain, but I have written an oratorio for\r\nwhich Bruneau has composed the music, and if it is sung in London, as I\r\nhope, I shall come over and spend a month going about everywhere. But, of\r\ncourse,' he added, with a twinkle in his eyes, 'I have about two years'\r\nimprisonment to do as things stand, so I must make no positive promises.'\r\n\r\nThe rest is soon told. Final arrangements were made, and we came away, M.\r\nand Mme. Fasquelle and myself, about ten o'clock. 'It is your last night\r\nof exile,' I said to M. Zola as I pressed his hand, 'and it will soon be\r\nover. You must try to sleep well.'\r\n\r\n'Sleep!' he replied. 'Oh, there is no sleep for me to-night. From this\r\nmoment I shall be counting the hours, the very minutes.'\r\n\r\n'It will make a change for you, Vizetelly,' said M. Fasquelle, as he,\r\nMme. Fasquelle, and myself walked towards the railway station. 'You will\r\nbe missing him now.'\r\n\r\nThis was true. All the routine, all the _alertes_, the meetings, the\r\nmissions of those eleven months were about to cease abruptly. What had at\r\nfirst seemed to me novel had with time become confirmed habit, and for\r\nthe first few days after M. Zola's departure I felt my occupation gone.\r\n\r\nThat departure took place, as arranged, on Sunday evening, June 4. It was\r\nthe day when President Loubet was cowardly assailed at a race-meeting by\r\nthe friends and partisans of the foolish Duke of Orleans; but of all that\r\nwe remained (_pro tem._) in blissful ignorance. The Fasquelles went down\r\nto Norwood and brought M. Zola to Victoria. I was busy during the day\r\npreparing for the 'Westminster Gazette' an English epitome of the\r\ndeclaration which 'L'Aurore' was to publish on the morrow. That work\r\naccomplished, I met the others on their arrival in town. Wareham had been\r\nwarned of the change in the programme on the previous night, and came up\r\nfrom Wimbledon with my wife. There was a hasty scramble of a dinner at a\r\nrestaurant near Victoria. We were served, I remember, by a very amusing\r\nand familiar waiter, who, addressing M. Zola by preference (I wonder if\r\nhe recognised him?), kept on repeating that he was a 'citizen of the most\r\nnoble Helvetian Confederation,' and assured us that potatoes for two\r\nwould be ample, and that chicken for three would be as much as we should\r\ncare to eat. 'Take this,' said he, 'it's to-day's. Don't have that, it\r\nwas cooked yesterday.' And all this made us extremely merry. 'It seems to\r\nme more than ever that I am living in a dream,' said M. Zola after a\r\nfinal laugh. 'That waiter has given the finishing touch to my illusion.'\r\n\r\nThe train started at nine P.M., and we had a full quarter of an hour at\r\nour disposal for our leave-takings in the dimly-lighted station. There\r\nwere few passengers travelling that night, and few loiterers about. We\r\nmade M. Zola take his seat in a compartment, and stood on guard before it\r\ntalking to him. Only one gentleman, a short dapper individual with\r\nmutton-chop whiskers (Wareham suggested that he looked like a barrister),\r\npaid any attention to the master, and, it may be, recognised him. For the\r\nrest, all went well. There were _au revoirs_ and handshakes all round,\r\nand messages, too, for one and another. And M. Zola would have his little\r\njoke. 'If you should come across Esterhazy,' he said to me, 'tell him\r\nthat I've gone back, and ask him when he's coming.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' I replied, 'he will probably want another safe-conduct before\r\nanswering that question.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think that a safe-conduct to take Dreyfus's place would suit\r\nhim?' was M. Zola's retort.\r\n\r\nBut the clock was now on the stroke of the hour, the carriage doors were\r\nhastily closed, and the signal for departure was given.\r\n\r\n'Au revoir, au revoir!' A last handshake, and the train started. For\r\nanother half-minute we could see our dear and illustrious friend at his\r\ncarriage window waving his arm to us. And then he was gone. The\r\nresponsibility which had so long rested on Wareham and myself was ended;\r\nEmile Zola's exit was virtually over: shortly after five o'clock on the\r\nfollowing morning he would once more be in Paris, ready to take his part\r\nin the final, crowning act of one of the greatest dramas that the world\r\nhas ever witnessed. Truth was still marching on, and assuredly nothing\r\nwould be able to stop it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's With Zola in England, by Ernest Alfred Vizetelly",
