He found some documents which did not refer exactly to the\r\nsubject of 'Polemical Mathematics;' but knowing the truth of the Hindoo\r\nproverb, 'The words of the wise are precious, and never to be\r\ndisregarded,' and feeling sure that this Lady Professor of Girtham\r\nCollege was entitled to that appellation, he ventured to include them in\r\nthis volume, and felt confident that in so doing he would be carrying\r\nout the intention of the Authoress, had she expressed any wishes on the\r\nsubject. In fact, as he valued the interests of the State and his own\r\npeace of mind, he dared not withhold any particle of that which he\r\nconceived would confer a lasting benefit on mankind.\r\n\r\nInternal evidence seems to show that the earlier portion of the MS. was\r\nwritten during the period when the authoress was still _in statu\r\npupillari_; but her learning was soon recognised by the Collegiate\r\nAuthorities, and she was speedily elected to a Professorship. Her\r\nlectures were principally devoted to the abstruse subject of Scientific\r\nPolitics, and are worthy of the attention of all those whose high duty\r\nit is to regulate the affairs of the State.\r\n\r\nThe Editor has been able to gather from the varied contents of the desk\r\nsome details of the Author's life, which increase the interest which her\r\nwords excite; and he ventures to hope that the public will appreciate\r\nthe wisdom which created such a profound impression upon those whose\r\nhigh privilege it was to hear the lectures for the first time in the\r\nHall of Girtham College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PAPER                                                             PAGE\r\n    I.

Its unfinished condition tends to show that it was\r\nprobably evolved during moments of relaxation from severer studies,\r\nwithout any idea of subsequent publication._]\r\n\r\nOh, why should I be doomed to the degradation of bearing such a foolish\r\nappellation! A Girtham Girl! I suppose we have to thank that fiend of\r\ninvention who is responsible for most of the titular foibles and follies\r\nof mankind--artful Alliteration. The two _G_'s, people imagine, run so\r\nwell together; and it is wonderful that they do not append some other\r\ndelectable title, such as 'The Gushing Girl of Girtham,' or 'The Glaring\r\nGirl of Glittering Girtham.' O Alliteration! Alliteration! what crimes\r\nhave been wrought in thy name! Little dost thou think of the mischief\r\nthou hast done, flooding the world with meaningless titles and absurd\r\nphrases. How canst thou talk of 'Lyrics of Loneliness,' 'Soliloquies of\r\nSong,' 'Pearls of the Peerage'? Why dost thou stay thine hand? We long\r\nfor thee to enrich the world with 'Dreams of a Dotard,' the 'Dog\r\nDoctor's Daughters,' and other kindred works. Exercise thine art on\r\nthese works of transcendent merit, but cease to style thy humble, but\r\nrebellious, servant a Girtham Girl!\r\n\r\nBut what's in a name? Let the world's tongue wag. I am a student, a\r\nhard-working, book-devouring, never-wearied student, who burns her\r\nmidnight oil, and drinks the strong bohea, to keep her awake during the\r\nlong hours of toil, like any Oxford or Cambridge undergraduate. I often\r\nwonder whether these mighty warriors in the lists--the class lists, I\r\nmean--really work half so hard as we poor unfortunate 'Girls of\r\nGirtham.' Now that I am writing in strict confidence, so that not even\r\nthe walls can hear the scratchings of my pen, or understand the meaning\r\nof all this scribbling, I beg to state that I have my serious doubts\r\nupon the subject; and when last I attended a soiree of the\r\nAnthropological Society, sounds issued forth from the windows of the\r\nsnug college rooms, which could not be taken as evidences of profound\r\nand undisturbed study.\r\n\r\nSometimes I glance at the examination papers set for these hard-working\r\nstudents, in order that they may attain the glorious degree of B.A., and\r\nastonish their sisters, cousins, and aunts by the display of these magic\r\nletters and all-resplendent hood. And again I say in strict confidence\r\nthat if this same glorious hood does not adorn the back of each\r\nindividual son of Alma Mater, he ought to be ashamed of himself, and not\r\nto fail to assume a certain less dignified, but expressive,\r\nthree-lettered qualification. But before those Tripos Papers I bow my\r\nhead in humble adoration. They sometimes take my breath away even to\r\nread the terrible excruciating things, which seem to turn one's brain\r\nround and round, and contort the muscles of one's face, and stop the\r\npulsation of one's heart, when one tries to grasp the horrid things.\r\n\r\nHere is a fair example of the ingenuity of the hard-hearted examiners,\r\nwho resemble the inquisitors presiding over the tortures of the rack,\r\nand giving the hateful machine just one turn more by way of bestowing a\r\nparting benediction on their miserable victims:\r\n\r\n'A uniform rod' (it is a marvellous act of mercy that the examiner\r\ninvented it _uniform_; it is strange that its thickness did not vary in\r\nsome complicated manner, and become a veritable birch-rod!) 'of length\r\n_2c_, rests in stable equilibrium' (stable! another act of leniency!),\r\n'with its lower end at the vertex of a cycloid whose plane is vertical'\r\n(why not incline it at an angle of 30 degrees?) 'and vertex downwards,\r\nand passes through a small, smooth, fixed ring situated in the axis at a\r\ndistance _b_ from the vertex. Show that if the equilibrium be slightly\r\ndisturbed, the rod will perform small oscillations with its lower end on\r\nthe arc of the cycloid in the time\r\n\r\n           +---------------------\r\n           | a{c^2 + 3(b - c)^2}\r\n    4[pi]\\ | ------------------- ,\r\n          \\|    3g(b^2 - 4ac)\r\n\r\nwhere _2a_ is the length of the axis of the cycloid.'\r\n\r\nA sweet pretty problem, truly! And there are hundreds of the same\r\nkind--birch-rods for every back! How the examiner must have rejoiced\r\nwhen he invented this diabolical rod, with its equilibrium, its\r\noscillations, its cycloid, and other tormenting accessories. And yet, I\r\nsuppose, before my days of studentship are over, I shall be called upon\r\nto attack some such impregnable fortresses of mathematics, when I hope\r\nto be declared equal to some twentieth wrangler, if I escape the\r\nmisfortune of sharing a portion of the 'wooden spoon.'\r\n\r\nAh, you male sycophants! You would prevent us from competing with you;\r\nyou would separate yourselves on your island of knowledge, and sink the\r\npunt which would bear us over to your privileged shore. Of all the\r\ntwaddle--forgive me, male sycophants!--that the world has ever heard, I\r\nthink the greatest is that which you have talked about female education.\r\nAnd the best of it is, you are so anxious about our welfare; you are so\r\nafraid that we should injure our health by overmuch mental exertion; you\r\nprofess to think that our brains are not calculated to stand the strain\r\nof continued mental exercise; you think that competition is not good for\r\nthe female mind; that we are too competitive by nature--too ambitious!\r\nYes, we are so ambitious that we would enter the lists with those who\r\nare asked in Public Examinations to find the simple interest on 1,000\r\npounds for 5 years at 6-1/4 per cent.; so ambitious that we would\r\ncompete with those who are requested to disclose the first aorist middle\r\nof [Greek: tupto]. Oh, think of the mental strain involved in such\r\nquestions! How it must ruin your health to find out how many times a\r\nwheel of radius 6 feet will turn round between York and London, a\r\ndistance of 200 miles! It is quite wonderful how your brains, my dear\r\nmale sycophants, can stand such fearful demands upon your intelligence\r\nand industry!\r\n\r\nBut you are so kind to us, so afraid of our health! Really, we are much\r\nobliged to you. If you married one of us, or became our guardian, or\r\nleft us a legacy, we should then recognise your interest in us, and be\r\nvery grateful to you for your good advice. But as matters stand, we are\r\nquite capable of taking care of ourselves. We will promise not to work\r\ntoo hard, if you will promise not to weary us with your paternal\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nBut, male sycophants, I want a word with you. Why do you object to our\r\ntaking degrees, or going in for examinations in order to qualify\r\nourselves for our duties in life? You need not speak out loud if you\r\nwould rather not. Are you not just a little afraid that we might eclipse\r\nyou? And it is not pleasant to be beaten by a woman, is it? And then you\r\nprofess to think that we ought to be all housewives and cooks, and\r\nknitters of stockings, and sewers-on of our husbands' buttons; but what\r\nif we have no husbands, no buttons to sew? And is it not a little\r\nselfish, my dear male sycophant, to wish to keep us all to yourself? to\r\nattend upon the wants of the lords of creation, who often distinguish\r\nthemselves so much in the domain of science?\r\n\r\nNow, look me straight in the face (no shirking, sir!). Is it not\r\njealousy--green-eyed, false-tongued jealousy--which saps your generous\r\ninstincts, and makes you talk rubbish and nonsense about strains, and\r\nbrains, and ambition, and the like? And if that is not hypocritical, I\r\ndo not know what is.\r\n\r\nWell, good-day to you, male sycophant! I really have not time to indulge\r\nmyself in scolding you any more. You are a good creature, no doubt; and\r\nwhen you have shown us what you can do, and can estimate the capacity of\r\nthe female brain, and take a common-sense view of things, we will\r\nrecognise your privilege to speak; and when I am the presiding genius of\r\nGirtham College, I will grant you the use of our hall for the purpose of\r\nlecturing to us on 'Women's Rights,' or, as you may prefer to entitle\r\nyour discourse, 'Men's Wrongs.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOh, this is shameful! I really am very sorry. Here have I been wasting a\r\ngood half-hour in dreaming, and slaying an imaginary enemy with\r\nenvenomed words and frequent dabs of ink. If I cannot concentrate my\r\nmind more on these mathematical researches, I fear a dreadful 'plough'\r\nwill harrow my feelings at the end of my sojourn in these halls of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nConcentration! How many of our words and ideas and thoughts are derived\r\nfrom that primal fount of all arts and sciences--mathematics! Here is\r\none which owes its origin to the mathematically trained mind of some\r\nearly philological professor, who had learnt to apply his scientific\r\nknowledge to the enrichment of his native tongue. He quoted to himself\r\nthe words of the Roman poet:\r\n\r\n            'Ego cur, acquirere pauca\r\n    Si possum, invideor, cum lingua Catonis et Enni\r\n    Sermonem patrium ditaverit, et nova rerum\r\n    Nomina protulerit? Licuit, semperque licebit.'\r\n\r\nHis mind conceived endless figures of circles and ellipses scattered\r\npromiscuously over the page, defying the attempts of the student to\r\nreduce them to order. What must he do before he can apply his formulae\r\nand equations, determine their areas, or describe their eccentric\r\nmotion? He must reduce them to a common centre, and then he can proceed\r\nto calculate the abstruse problems in connection with the figures\r\ndescribed. They may be the complex motions of double-star orbits, or the\r\nresults of the impact of various projectiles on the tranquil surface of\r\na pool. It matters not--the principle is the same; he must concentrate,\r\nand reduce to a common centre.\r\n\r\nThis is the great defect of those who have no accurate mathematical\r\nknowledge; they cannot concentrate their minds with the same degree of\r\nintensity upon the work which lies before them. Their thoughts fly off\r\nat a tangent, as mine do very often; but then I have not been classed\r\nyet in the Tripos; and, O male poetical sycophant, you may be right\r\nafter all when you say:\r\n\r\n   'O woman! in our hours of ease\r\n    Uncertain, coy and hard to please,\r\n    As variable as the noon-day shade.'\r\n\r\nYes, as variable as the most variable quantities _x_, _y_, _z_. I, a\r\nstudent of Girtham College, blush to own that my thoughts very often fly\r\noff at a tangent.\r\n\r\n'Fly off at a tangent!' All hail to thee, most noble mathematical\r\nphrase! Here is another fine mathematical expression, plainly\r\nexemplifying the action of centrifugal force. The faster the wheel\r\nturns, the greater is the velocity of the discarded particles which fly\r\noff along the line, perpendicular to the radius of the circle. The world\r\ntravels very fast now; the increased velocity of the transit of earthly\r\nbodies, the rate at which they live, the multiplicity of engagements,\r\netc., have made the social world revolve so fast that the speed would\r\nhave startled the torpid life of the last century. And what is the\r\nresult? Men's thoughts fly off at a tangent; they are unable to\r\nconcentrate their minds on any given subject; they are content with\r\nhasty generalisms, with short magazine articles on important subjects,\r\nwhich really require large volumes and patient study to elucidate them\r\nfully.\r\n\r\nWhat we want to do is to increase the attractive force, in order to\r\nprevent this tangential motion--to increase the _force of gravity_.\r\n\r\n'Well,' says the young lady who loves to revel in the 'Ghastly Secret of\r\nthe Moated Dungeon,' or the 'Mysteries of Footlight Fancy,' 'you are\r\n_grave_ enough. Pray don't increase your gravity!'\r\n\r\nThank you, gentle critic. I will, in turn, ask you one favour. Leave for\r\nonce the 'Mysteries of Footlight Fancy;' seek to know no more 'ghastly\r\nsecrets,' and increase _your gravity_--your mental weight; and hence\r\nyour attraction in the eyes of all who are worth attracting will be\r\nmarvellously increased, by understanding a little about Newton's law of\r\nuniversal gravitation, and don't fly off at a tangent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of this portion of the MS. the editor of these papers\r\ndiscovered a photograph which, from subsequent inquiry, proved to be\r\nthat of the accomplished authoress of the above reflections. The face\r\nis one of considerable beauty, with eyes as clear, steadfast, and open\r\nas the day. There is a degree of firmness about the mouth, but it is a\r\nsweet and pretty one notwithstanding; and a smile, half scornful, half\r\nplayful, can be detected lurking about the corners of the lips, which do\r\nnot seem altogether fitted for pronouncing hard mathematical terms and\r\nabstruse scientific problems. This photograph might have been the\r\nidentical one which nearly brought an enamoured youth into grave\r\ndifficulties by its secretion in the folds of his blotting-paper during\r\nexamination. The said enamoured youth had evidently placed it there for\r\nthe sake of its inspiring qualities; and it was said that all his hopes\r\nof gaining the hand of the fair original depended upon his passing that\r\nsame examination. But the wakeful eye of a stern examiner had watched\r\nhim as he turned again and again to consult the sweet face which beamed\r\nfrom beneath his blotting-paper; and he narrowly escaped expulsion from\r\nthe Senate-house on the charge of 'cribbing.' Certainly he took a mean\r\nadvantage of his fellow-sufferers, if this were the identical\r\nphotograph, for it portrays a most inspiring face. Forgive us, lenient\r\nreader; one moment! There--thank you--we have done. And now we will\r\nproceed to disclose the researches and original problems which the MS.\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nEvidently the collegiate authorities were not slow in recognising the\r\ntalents of the assiduous student, and elected her without much delay to\r\na Professorship of Girtham. In this capacity the learned lady delivered\r\nseveral lectures, of which the second MS. contains the first of the\r\nseries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER II.\r\n\r\nLECTURE ON THE THEORY OF BRAIN WAVES AND THE TRANSMIGRATION\r\nAND POTENTIALITY OF MENTAL FORCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessors and Students of the University of Girtham, my Lords, Ladies,\r\nand Gentlemen,--I have the honour to bring before you this evening some\r\noriginal conceptions and discoveries which have been formulated by me\r\nduring my researches in the boundless field of mathematical knowledge;\r\nand though you may be inclined at first to pronounce them as somewhat\r\nhastily conceived hypotheses, I hope to be able to demonstrate the\r\nactual truth of the propositions which I shall now endeavour to\r\nenunciate. It is with some feelings of diffidence that I stand before so\r\naugust an assembly as the present; and if I were not actually convinced\r\nof the accuracy of my calculations, I should never have presumed to\r\nappear before you in the character of a lecturer. But '_Magna est\r\nveritas, et praevalebit_.' I cast aside maiden timidity; I clothe myself\r\nin the professorial robe which you have bestowed upon me, and sacrifice\r\nmy own feelings on the altar of Truth.\r\n\r\nI have been engaged, as you are doubtless aware, for some years in the\r\npursuit of mathematical research, exploring the mines of science, which\r\nhave of late been worked very persistently, but often, like the black\r\ndiamond mines, at a loss. Concurrently with these researches, I have\r\nspeculated on the great social problems which perplex the minds of men,\r\nboth individually and collectively. And I have come to the conclusion\r\nthat the same laws hold good in both spheres of work; that methods of\r\nmathematical procedure are applicable to the grand social problems of\r\nthe day and to the regulation of the mutual relations which exist\r\nbetween man and man. Take, for example, the Force of public opinion. Of\r\nwhat is it composed? It is the Resultant of all the forces which act\r\nupon that which is generally designated the 'Social System.' Public\r\nopinion is a compromise between the many elements which make up human\r\nsociety; and compromise is a purely mechanical affair, based on the\r\nprinciple of the Parallelogram of Forces. Sometimes disturbing forces\r\nexert their influence upon the action of Public Opinion, causing the\r\nsystem to swerve from its original course, and precipitating society\r\ninto a course of conduct inconsistent with its former behaviour; and it\r\nis the duty of the Governing Body to eliminate as far as possible such\r\ndisturbing forces, in order that society may pursue the even tenor of\r\nits way.\r\n\r\nProfessors, we have one great problem to solve; and all questions\r\nsocial, political, scientific, or otherwise, are only fragments of that\r\ngreat problem. All truths are but different aspects of different\r\napplications of one and the same truth; and although they may appear\r\nopposed, they are not really so; and resemble lines which run in\r\nvarious directions, but lovingly meet in one centre.\r\n\r\nNow, let us take for our consideration the secret influence which men\r\nexert upon each other, apart from that produced by the power of speech\r\n(although that would come under the same general law). As\r\nmathematicians, you are aware that the undulatory theory of light and\r\nheat and sound are now accepted by scientific men as the only sure basis\r\nof accurate calculation. We know that the rays of light travel in waves,\r\nand the equation representing the waves is\r\n\r\n         a       2[pi]\r\n    y = --- sin ------ (vt - r),\r\n         r     [lambda]\r\n\r\nwhere _y_ is the disturbance of the ether, _a_ the initial amplitude,\r\n_r_ the distance from the starting-point, [lambda] the wave-length, and\r\n_v_ the velocity of light. Sound and heat likewise have much the same\r\nform of equation. Now, I maintain that the waves of thought are governed\r\nby the same laws, and can be determined by an equation of the same form.\r\nYou are aware that in all these equations a certain quantity denoted by\r\n[lambda] appears, and varies for the different media through which the\r\nsound, or light, or heat passes, and which must be determined by\r\nexperiment Now, in my equation for brain waves, the same quantity\r\n[lambda] appears which must be determined by the same method--by\r\n_experiment_. But how is this to be done? After mature deliberation and\r\nmuch careful thought, I have discovered the method for finding [lambda].\r\nThis method is _mesmerism_. We find the ratio of brain to brain--the\r\nrelative strength which one bears to another; and then by an application\r\nof our formula we can actually determine the wave of thought, and read\r\nthe minds of our fellow-creatures. An unbounded field for reflection and\r\nspeculation is here suggested. Like all great discoveries, the elements\r\nof the problem have unconsciously been utilized by many who are unable\r\nto account for their method of procedure. For example, thought-readers,\r\nmesmerists, and the like, have unconsciously been working on this\r\nprinciple, although lack of mathematical training has prevented them\r\nfrom fully mastering the details of the problem. Hence in popular minds\r\na kind of mystery has hung about the actions of such people, and excited\r\nthe curiosity of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe development of this theory of brain waves may be of great practical\r\nutility to the world. It shows that great care ought to be exercised in\r\nthe domain of thought, as well as that of speech. For example: A man has\r\nmade a startling discovery, from which he expects to receive\r\nconsiderable worldly advantage. He would be careful not to disclose his\r\ndiscovery in speech to his acquaintances until his plans are\r\nsufficiently matured, lest they should impart it to the world, patent\r\nhis device, and reap the reward. But while he is endeavouring to talk\r\ncarelessly about it, the wave of thought may be travelling from brain to\r\nbrain, suggesting the existence of the discovery; and if the conditions\r\nare favourable, and [lambda] sufficiently small, it is possible that the\r\nidea itself may be conveyed. Of course the more complicated the\r\ndiscovery, the less likely would the wave convey the conception. Or\r\nsuppose that one of the learned professorial body of our sister\r\nuniversity should conceive an attachment for a lady-student of Girtham\r\nCollege (of course a very improbable supposition!), and the infatuated\r\n_savant_ became somewhat jealous of another learned lecturer of the same\r\ncollege (another improbability!), the fact of his jealousy would be\r\nimparted to the latter by a wave of thought, and might cause\r\nconsiderable confusion in the serene course of love or science. The fact\r\nof the existence of the wave is indisputable. What do all the stories of\r\nimpressions and double-sight teach us? How could the intelligence of the\r\ndeath of Professor Steele have been conveyed to his friend and\r\nfellow-student, Professor Tait--the one at Cambridge, the other at\r\nEdinburgh--were it not for the existence of some wave, which, like that\r\nof electricity, wings its rapid flight unobserved by human eyes? Are all\r\nthe records of the Psychical Society only myths and legends bred of\r\nsuperstitious fancy? It were hard to suppose so.\r\n\r\nBut if, gentlemen, and ladies especially, you wish to keep your secret\r\ndiscoveries to yourselves, watch over your thoughts as well as your\r\nwords; for my researches prove, and the universal experience of mankind\r\ncorroborates the fact, that some portion of your inmost thoughts and\r\nsecret desires are understood by your neighbours (especially when\r\n[lambda] is small!); that they travel along the waves which I have\r\nattempted to indicate; and if you would desire to extend your influence\r\nin the world, probe the secret instincts of mankind, and prevent\r\nyourself from being deceived and wronged--study the art and science of\r\nBrain Waves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following verses of rather doubtful merit were found in connection\r\nwith the previous MS.

The\r\napplication of mathematics to the study of Social Science and Political\r\nGovernment has curiously enough escaped the attention of those who ought\r\nto be most conversant with these matters. I shall endeavour to prove in\r\nthe present lecture that the relations between individuals and the\r\nGovernment are similar to those which mathematical knowledge would lead\r\nus to postulate, and to explain on scientific principles the various\r\nconvulsions which sometimes agitate the social and political world.\r\n\r\nIndeed, by this method we shall be able to prophesy the future of states\r\nand nations, having given certain functions and peculiarities\r\nappertaining to them, just as easily as we can foretell the exact day\r\nand hour of an eclipse of the moon or sun. In order to do this, we must\r\nfirst determine the _social properties of a conic section_.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of the unlearned and ignorant, I will first state that a\r\ncone is a solid figure described by the revolution of a right-angled\r\ntriangle about one of the sides containing the right angle, which\r\nremains fixed. The fixed side is called the axis of the cone. Conic\r\nsections are obtained by cutting the cone by planes. It may easily be\r\nproved that if the angle between the cutting plane and the axis be equal\r\nto the angle between the axis and the revolving side of the triangle\r\nwhich generates the cone, the section described on the surface of the\r\ncone is a parabola; if the former angle be greater than the latter, the\r\ncurve will be an ellipse; and if less, the section will be a hyperbola.\r\n\r\nBut the simplest conic section is, of course, a circle, which is formed\r\nby a plane at right angles to the axis of the cone; and the simplest\r\ncircle is that formed by a plane passing through the apex of the cone.\r\nAll this is simple mathematics; and let beginners consult more\r\nelementary treatises than this one to satisfy themselves on these\r\npoints. But if they will assume these things to be true, they will know\r\nquite enough for our present purpose. The simplest conic section of all\r\nhas been proved to be a _point_. Now, this represents the simplest and\r\noriginal form of society, a _single family_. 'It is not good for man to\r\nbe alone' was the first observation made by the wise Creator upon the\r\nrational creature whom He had introduced into Paradise as its lord.\r\nMarriage is the rudiment of all social life, from which all others\r\nspring, out of which all others are developed. Around the parents'\r\nknees soon cluster a group of children, and in their relation to each\r\nother we discern the earliest forms of law and discipline--the bonds by\r\nwhich society is held together. When the children grow up, separate\r\nhouseholds are formed; and then the multiplication of families, the\r\ncongregating of men together for purposes of security and mutual\r\nadvantages in division of labour; and thus is gradually formed a state,\r\nwhich is only the development of the family--the king representing the\r\nparent, and ruling on the same principle.\r\n\r\nMathematically speaking, our plane no longer passes through the apex.\r\nThe point represented the single family; but keeping the plane\r\nhorizontal, we move it along the axis, the sections will become\r\n_circles_, which represent mathematically the next simplest form of\r\nsociety, where the centre is the seat of government, which is connected\r\nwith each individual member of the social circle by equal radii. The\r\nsocial property of a circle is that of a monarchical government in its\r\npurest and simplest form. The larger the circle becomes (_i.e._, the\r\nfurther you move the plane from the apex), the greater the distance\r\nbetween the individual and the monarch. Therefore, the more independent\r\nthe monarchy becomes, and the less influence do individuals possess over\r\nthe ruling power. Hence, we may infer that as years roll on, the\r\ngovernment will become more despotic; but the stability of the country\r\ndiminished, and probably some individual particle, when sufficiently\r\nwithdrawn from the attraction of the central head, will begin to revolve\r\non its own account, and spontaneously generate a government of its own.\r\nWe may, therefore, conclude from mathematical reasoning that an\r\nunlimited monarchy, though advantageous for small states, is not a safe\r\nform of government for a large or populous country, inasmuch as the\r\npeople do not derive much benefit from the sovereign; the mutual\r\nattraction, which ought to exist in a flourishing state between the\r\nruler and the ruled, is weakened; and the isolation of the monarch\r\ntends to make him still more despotic. As a practical example of the\r\ntruth of the foregoing statement, I may mention the present condition of\r\nRussia, which shows that the result of an unlimited monarchy, in a large\r\nand unwieldy social circle, is such as we should have reasonably\r\nexpected from mathematical investigations.\r\n\r\nInvariably, under the circumstances which I have described, the country\r\nwill become disorganized; the sovereign will cease to have any power\r\nover the people, and the country will become a chaos, without order,\r\ninfluence, or power.\r\n\r\nWhen the centre of a conic section moves along the axis of the curve to\r\ninfinity, banished by the mutual consent of the individual particles\r\nwhich compose the curve, or the nation, a figure is formed, called a\r\n_parabola_. This is the curve which the most erratic bodies in the\r\nuniverse describe in space, as they rush along at a speed inconceivable\r\nto human minds, and are supposed to produce all kinds of mischief and\r\ninjury to the worlds whose courses they wend their way among.\r\n\r\nThis curve, then, represents the position which the nation assumes when\r\nthe constituted monarchy, the centre of the system, has been _banished\r\nto infinity_. A revolution has occurred; the monarch has been dethroned;\r\nand it is not hard to see that the same erratic course which the comet\r\npursues in its flight, is observable with respect to the social system\r\nwhich is represented by a parabola. We observe with eager scrutiny the\r\nwanderings of these erratic comets. They appear suddenly with their\r\nvapoury tails; sometimes they shine upon us with their soft, silvery\r\nlight, brilliant as another moon; sometimes they stand afar off in the\r\ndistant skies, and deign not to approach our steady-going earth, which\r\npursues its regular course day by day, and year by year. Then, after a\r\nfew days' coy inspection of our planet from different points of view,\r\nthey fly to other remote parts of the universe, and do not condescend to\r\nshow themselves again for a hundred years or so. Such is the erratic\r\nconduct of a heavenly body whose course is regulated by a parabolic\r\ncurve.\r\n\r\nWe may look for similar eccentric behaviour on the part of a community,\r\nnation, or state, whose centre is at infinity, whose constitution has\r\nbeen violently disturbed, and whose monarchy is situated in the far-off\r\nregions of unlimited space. The erratic course of Republican rule is\r\nproverbial. There is no stability, no regularity. To-day we may observe\r\nits brilliancy, which seems to laugh at and eclipse the sombre shining\r\nof more steady and enduring worlds; but ere to-morrow's moon has risen,\r\nit may have vanished into the regions of eternal night, and we look for\r\nits bright shining light in the councils of the nations, but it has\r\nceased to shed its rays, and we are disappointed. Sometimes it is asked,\r\nwith fear and trembling: 'What would be the effect if our earth were to\r\ncome in contact with the tail of a comet? Should we be destroyed by the\r\ncollision, and our ponderous world cease to be?' But we are assured\r\nthat no such disastrous results would follow. We have already passed\r\nthrough the tails of many comets, but we have not discovered any\r\ninconvenient change in our ordinary mode of procedure. It is probable\r\nthat the comet's tail is composed of no solid substance.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore infer by analogy that a Republican State would not\r\noffer any powerful resistance if it were to come into collision with a\r\nnation possessing a more settled form of government. A shower of\r\nmeteoric stones, like passing fireworks, might take place; but beyond\r\nthat nothing would occur to excite the fear, or arouse the energies of\r\nthe more favoured nation. As an example of the weakness of a Republican\r\nState I may mention France. There we see an industrious race of people,\r\nendowed with many natural gifts and graces, a country rich and\r\nproductive; and yet, owing to the unsettled nature of its government,\r\nall these natural advantages are neutralized; its course amongst the\r\nnations is erratic in the extreme, a spectacle of feeble\r\nadministration; and it would offer no more resistance to a colliding\r\nPower than the empty vacuum of a comet's tail. This example will\r\ndemonstrate to you the truth of our theory with regard to the\r\ninstability of a social system which is geometrically represented by a\r\nparabolic curve.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn from this picture of insecurity and unrest to another\r\nfigure which possesses most advantageous social properties. I refer to\r\nthe ellipse. An ellipse is a curve formed by the section of a cone by a\r\nplane surface inclined at an angle to the vertical axis of the cone,\r\ngreater than the angle between the axis and the generating line.\r\n\r\nNow, this is a curve which possesses most attractive properties. It is\r\nthe curve which the earth and other planetary orbs describe around the\r\ncentre of the solar system, as if nature intended that we should take\r\nthis figure as a guide in choosing the most advantageous social system.\r\nIt possesses a centre, C, in view of all the particles which compose the\r\ncurve, and connected with them by close ties. It has two foci, S and\r\nS', fixed points, by the aid of which we may trace the curve.\r\n\r\nIn the interpretation of this figure, the centre of the curve represents\r\nthe throne of monarchy. There is no tendency here to revolutionize the\r\nState, to banish the ruling power, and institute a Republican form of\r\ngovernment; but inasmuch as we saw the weakness of an absolute monarchy\r\nin large and populous States, as represented by the circle, the wisdom\r\nof an elliptical social system has ordained that there shall be two\r\nfoci, or houses of representatives of the people, who shall assist in\r\nregulating the progress of the nation. Here we have a limited monarchy;\r\nthe throne is supported by the representatives of the people; and the\r\nnearer these foci of the nation are to the centre (_i.e._, in\r\nmathematical language, the less the _eccentricity_ of the curve), the\r\nmore perfect the system becomes--the greater the happiness of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the _eccentricity_ becomes very great, the beauty of the\r\ncurve is destroyed, and ultimately the ellipse is merged into one\r\nstraight line. Most learned Professors, here we have a terrible warning\r\nof the awful result of too much eccentricity. Whether we regard the life\r\nof the nation or of the individual, let all bear in mind this alarming\r\nfact, that eccentricity of thought, habit, or behaviour may result, as\r\nin the case of this unfortunate ellipse, which once presented such fair\r\nand promising proportions to the student's admiring gaze, in the\r\n'sinister effacement of a man,' or the gradual absorption of a State\r\ninto an uninteresting thing 'which lies evenly between its extreme\r\npoints.'\r\n\r\nThe great examples of Bacon, of Milton, of Newton, of Locke, and of\r\nothers, happen to be directly opposed to the popular inference that\r\neccentricity and thoughtlessness of conduct are the necessary\r\naccompaniments of talent, and the sure indications of genius. I am\r\nindebted to Lacon for that reflection. You may point to Byron, or\r\nSavage, or Rousseau, and say, 'Were not these eccentric people\r\ntalented?' 'Certainly,' I answer; 'but would they not have been better\r\nand greater men if they had been less eccentric--if they had restrained\r\ntheir caprice, and controlled their passions?' Do not imagine, my young\r\nstudents of this university, that by being eccentric you will therefore\r\nbecome great men and women of genius. The world will not give you credit\r\nfor being brilliant because you affect the extravagances which sometimes\r\naccompany genius. Some of you ladies, I perceive, have adopted a\r\npeculiar form of dress, half male, half female; or, to be more correct,\r\nthree-fourths male, and one-fourth female. Do not imagine that you will\r\nthus attain to the highest honours in this university by your\r\neccentricity, unless your talents are hid beneath your short-cut hair,\r\nand brains are working hard under your college head-gear. As well might\r\nwe expect to find that all females who wear sage-green and extravagant\r\naesthetic costumes are really born artists and future Royal Academicians.\r\nIt is apparent that many aspirers to fame and talent are eager to\r\nexhibit their eccentricities to the gaze of the world, in order that\r\nthey may persuade the multitude that they possess the genius of which\r\neccentricity is falsely supposed to be the outward sign.\r\n\r\nI may remark in passing that the eccentricity of a parabolic curve is\r\nalways _unity_. What does this prove? You will remember that a\r\nRepublican State is represented by a parabola. Therefore, however such a\r\nnation may strive to alter its condition, and secure a settled form of\r\ngovernment, its eccentricity will always remain the same. It will always\r\nbe erratic, peculiar, unsettled; and this conclusion substantiates our\r\nprevious proposition with regard to the condition of a social system\r\nrepresented by a parabola.\r\n\r\nWith regard to other advantages afforded by an elliptical social system,\r\nwe will defer the consideration of this important subject until my next\r\nlecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL PROPERTIES OF A CONIC SECTION,\r\nAND THE THEORY OF POLEMICAL MATHEMATICS--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nMost learned Professors and Students of this University,--You have\r\nalready gathered from my preceding lecture my method of procedure in the\r\ninvestigation of the corresponding properties of curves and States. You\r\nhave perceived that we have here the elements of a new science, which\r\nmay be extended indefinitely, and applied to the various departments of\r\nself-government and State control. This new science of polemical\r\nmathematics is in itself an extension of the _principle of continuity_,\r\nfor the discovery of which Poncelet is so justly renowned. We can prove\r\nby geometry that the properties of one figure may be derived from those\r\nof another which corresponds to it; and the new science teaches us that\r\nif we can represent, by projection or otherwise, a society of particles\r\nor individuals on a plane surface, the properties of the State so\r\nrepresented are analogous to the properties of the curve with which it\r\ncorresponds. It is only possible for me to touch upon the elements of\r\nthe science in these lectures, but I hope to arouse an interest in these\r\nsomewhat unusual complications and curious problems, that you may\r\nhereafter make further discoveries in this unexplored region of\r\nknowledge, and that the world may reap the benefit of your labours and\r\nabstruse studies. I have already, in my previous lecture, touched upon\r\nthe social properties of the parabola, and examined the constitution of\r\nerratic curves and eccentric nations. It is my intention to-day to speak\r\nof similar problems which arise with reference to elliptical States.\r\n\r\nBut, first, let me answer an objection which may have occurred to your\r\nminds. Am I wrong in my calculations in attributing too much to the\r\npower and usefulness of forms of government? Does the well-being and\r\nhappiness of a nation depend on the government, or upon the individuals\r\nwho compose the nation? Most assuredly, I assert, they rest upon the\r\nformer. Men love their country when the good of every particular man is\r\ncomprehended in the public prosperity; they undertake hazard and labour\r\nfor the government when it is justly administered. When the welfare of\r\nevery citizen is the care of the ruling power, men do not spare their\r\npersons or their purses for the sake of their country and the support of\r\ntheir sovereign. But where selfish aims are manifest in Court or\r\nParliament, the people care not for State officials who are indifferent\r\nto their country's weal; they become selfish too; Liberty hides her\r\nhead, and shakes off the dust of her feet ere she leaves that doomed\r\nland, and the stability, welfare, and prosperity of that country cease.\r\n\r\nI might refer you to many a stained page of national history in order to\r\nprove this. Compare the closing chapters of the life of the Roman empire\r\nwith the record of the brave deeds of its ancient warriors and valorous\r\nstatesmen. Grecian preeminence and virtue died when liberty expired. I\r\nagree with Sidney when he writes that it is absurd to impute this to the\r\nchange of times; for time changes nothing, and nothing was changed in\r\nthose times but the government, and that changed all things. These are\r\nhis words: 'As a man begets a man, and a beast a beast, that society of\r\nmen which constitutes a government upon the foundation of justice,\r\nvirtue, and the common good, will always have men to promote those ends;\r\nand that which intends the advancement of one man's desires and vanity\r\nwill abound in those that will foment them.' I may not, therefore, be\r\naltogether wrong in attributing the prosperity and well-being of a\r\nnation to the form of government which it possesses.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to the consideration of the social advantages which\r\nan elliptical State affords. This is the form of government and social\r\nposition which we, as a nation, at present enjoy; and from mathematical\r\nconsiderations I am of opinion that it is the best, and hope that no\r\nchange will ever be made in our constitution. You may remember that I\r\nhave previously stated that an ellipse has a centre and two foci, in\r\nview of all the particles which compose the curve, and connected with\r\nthem by close ties. The centre, in the projected figure, represents the\r\nmonarchy, which is limited; and the government is carried on by the aid\r\nof the two houses of representatives of the people, depicted in the\r\nprojection by the two foci.\r\n\r\nNow the social advantages of the ellipse are given by the fact that the\r\nsum of the distances of any point from the foci is always constant. No\r\nparticle is left out in the cold; no one does not possess the advantages\r\nof a social government. Though his distance may be far from the Upper\r\nHouse, he has the advantage of nearness to the Lower, and _vice versa_.\r\nThe sum of the distances is constant. The extinction of one focus, the\r\nHouse of Lords, for example, would create a complete disorganization of\r\nthe whole system: the other focus would set up a powerful magnetic\r\nattraction, and a curious bulb-shaped curve would be evolved, very\r\ndifferent from the beautiful symmetrical form which the original figure\r\npresented to the eye. The centre of the system would be disturbed; and\r\nit is probable that ere long it would disappear along the axis and be\r\nvanished to infinity. Thus the curve would become a parabola. This is\r\nthe alarming result of the extinction of one focus. Abolish the House of\r\nLords, and you will soon find that the Throne will be disturbed; the\r\nState will become disorganized; the nation will become confused by the\r\nmagnetic force of the Lower House, uncounteracted by any other\r\nattraction; and very soon a complete revolution of the whole system\r\nwill set in: the monarch will be dethroned, and a Republican form of\r\ngovernment, with all the eccentricities of a parabolic course, will take\r\nthe place of a more orderly and settled constitution. This is a plain\r\ndeduction from our mathematical investigations; and it behoves all our\r\nstatesmen, our philosophers and great men, our fellow-citizens and the\r\nhumblest artisans in our manufacturing towns, to weigh well this\r\nalarming result of the abolition of that House which has been threatened\r\nwith destruction; and to ascertain for themselves the truths upon which\r\nmy proposition and reasoning rest.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that the fact that the earth's orbit and that of\r\nother planets are in the form of ellipses; that the curvature of the\r\nearth is nearly the same, ought to guide us in choosing this particular\r\ncurve as a model of the projection of a complete and most advantageous\r\nsocial system.\r\n\r\nThe circle described on the major axis of an ellipse, is called the\r\n_auxiliary circle_, and affords much assistance in the investigation of\r\nthe properties of an ellipse. As we have already shown, the circle\r\nrepresents the simplest form of monarchical government. Hence, if we\r\ncompare the form of government represented by an ellipse (_i.e._, such\r\nas we now enjoy) with that of a system where the king is the only\r\ngoverning power, we may obtain great assistance in solving complicated\r\npolitical problems.\r\n\r\nIn all conics there is a straight line called the 'directrix,' which\r\nrepresents in social or polemical science the laws of the nation, and\r\nplays a prominent part in the mutual relations of the individual\r\nparticles. For instance, in the case of the parabola, the distance of\r\nany particle from the directrix is equal to its distance from the focus.\r\n\r\nFrom this we may conclude that if an individual deviates at all from the\r\npath which the laws (or, directrix) indicate, if he does not show true\r\nrespect to the decrees of the focal government, and preserve the true\r\nposition between them, directly he is found deviating from his course,\r\nhe is quickly banished to a less enlightened sphere. In an ellipse there\r\nis less likelihood of his straying away from the course which the\r\ndirectrix points out, on account of the two-fold guidance which he\r\nreceives from the two foci.\r\n\r\nThe following curious problem may be noticed. If a parabola roll on\r\nanother parabola, their vertices coinciding, the focus of the first\r\ntraces out the directrix of the second.\r\n\r\nHere we come to the consideration of the international relationship of\r\nStates. Two nations have the same form of government (in this example\r\nthis form is Republican); their policies coincide: we may conclude from\r\nthis proposition that the course which the government of one nation will\r\npursue, will be that which is prescribed by the laws of the other.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the contact of curves presents many interesting problems\r\nwith reference to Polemical Science, and may be extended indefinitely.\r\nIt is well known that there are different orders of contact, which are\r\ndesignated as the _first_, _second_, or _third_ order. This last order\r\nmay be termed the 'marriage of curves,' cemented by the osculating\r\ncircle, or 'wedding-ring;' and when two nations have contact of the\r\nthird order, they have formed a very close alliance, and by calculation\r\nwe can obtain the _radius of curvature_, or size of the wedding-ring, by\r\nmeans of which they may be united.\r\n\r\nThe theory and nature of contact constitute a branch of our newly\r\ndiscovered science which we commend to the careful consideration of\r\nthose who have undertaken the difficult and perplexing study of\r\ninternational law. Alas! too many States refuse this friendly contact,\r\nand, consequently, _cut_ each other, instead of blending in sweet\r\naccord. Their peace is at best an armed neutrality; and if they have\r\ncontact of only the _first_ or _second_ order, we can prove\r\nmathematically that they are sure to intersect in some other point or\r\npoints; and divergence of policy and disturbed relations are the\r\nresults. Contact of the _third, or highest, order_ is the only safe\r\nposition for two allied, or contiguous, States.\r\n\r\nWith your permission I will add a few words to those I have already\r\nuttered with regard to the directrix. As necessary as the directrix is\r\nto the curve, so are the corresponding laws to the State. I will prove\r\nthis fact by a few examples. English people have laws, and know how to\r\nobey them; therefore their numbers increase; they thrive and are\r\nprosperous. A friendly critic of another nation has said that the reason\r\nwhy Englishmen rule the world, is because they know how to obey. On the\r\nother hand, the gipsies have no laws; hence they become fewer and less\r\npowerful. What is the condition of all tribes and nations which are not\r\ngoverned by laws? They invariably remain poor and miserable. They are in\r\nwant of a directrix; and if we could supplement the gift with foci and\r\ncentre, they would soon emerge from their savage condition, and become\r\nmore civilized.\r\n\r\nI have omitted to mention the hyperbolic form of government. The curve\r\nformed by the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane will be\r\na hyperbola, when the inclination of the cutting plane to the axis of\r\nthe cone is less than the constant angle which the generating line forms\r\nwith the axis. It is manifest that the plane will thus intersect the\r\nhigher cone, and produce the figure which is known to mathematicians as\r\nthe hyperbola.\r\n\r\nWe may hence deduce the following property of the corresponding\r\nhyperbolic State. We take cognizance of that higher cone with which the\r\nmundane affairs of the lower cone are closely connected. As an example\r\nof this system we may mention the vast temporal rule and power of the\r\nPapal Throne, which formerly exercised such marvellous sway over the\r\nnations of Europe. By an appeal to a Higher Authority than that of\r\nearthly kings and potentates was this rule exercised; but its hyperbolic\r\nform is fast passing away, and degenerating into that of a circle with\r\nindefinitely small radius. We shall not, therefore, discuss the complex\r\npolemical problems which a hyperbolic State suggests.\r\n\r\nI will now mention a few problems which are easily capable of proof, and\r\ndeduce from them the necessary conclusions which must follow when we\r\napply our newly discovered principles of polemical science.\r\n\r\n1. 'If from any point in a straight line a pair of tangents be drawn to\r\nan ellipse, the chords of contact will pass through a fixed point.'\r\n\r\nI will not trouble you with the proof of this proposition, as it is\r\nevident to all mathematicians, and can easily be demonstrated. But mark\r\nwell the deductions, when we interpret this mathematical language in\r\ncorrect polemical terms. A State, through various convulsions of its\r\nown, has merged into a condition represented by a straight line, having\r\nlost its symmetry, its beauty, its curvilinear proportion. An individual\r\nunhappily situated in this unfortunate community regards with longing\r\neyes the prosperous condition of those who enjoy the social advantages\r\nof a settled form of government, and other blessings which accompany\r\nelliptical jurisdiction and laws. [Two tangents are drawn to an\r\nellipse.] No matter where the individual may be in the unhappy envious\r\nstraight line, the result of his reflection will be the same.\r\nSympathetic chords are drawn, joining the points of contact of the\r\ntangents with the curve; they all pass through a fixed point. All these\r\nconclusions of the various individuals on the straight line will be the\r\nsame. All are of opinion that the elliptical form is the best; and they\r\nmourn in secret over the sad events which have occurred in their own\r\nnational life, their eccentricity, their lawlessness, when they see the\r\nadvantages which their more staid and sober-minded neighbours so freely\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\n2. The normal at any point of an ellipse bisects the angle between the\r\nfocal distances of that point.\r\n\r\nThe normal is the perpendicular from the point on the major axis; it is\r\nthe line of thought directed by the observance of just laws and rules.\r\nHence this proposition shows that the individual citizen, when guided by\r\nsound judgment, regards with equal favour and entire approval the\r\nexistence of both foci, or Houses of Legislature. He considers that both\r\nare necessary to his comfort, and the right regulation of the State's\r\nwelfare. He cares not for the _abnormal_ condition of those who talk as\r\nif the existence of either House were unnecessary to his country's weal,\r\nand bestows a pitying glance on those wandering lights, or disturbed\r\nerratic governments, which do not possess the advantages which from\r\nexperience he has learned to love and to respect. No matter what his\r\ncondition may be, the same opinions are held by all classes, all ranks\r\nand degrees; and if a self-opinionated particle think otherwise, he ought\r\nto be transferred to a less enlightened sphere, and migrate to a\r\nparabolic state, or uninteresting straight line. And when he has changed\r\nhis location, he will look back on his old home and old surroundings\r\nwith longing eyes and an aching heart, thinking of the blessings he has\r\nlost by his own rash act. This can be proved mathematically. He looks\r\nfor an ideal state of society, leaps after the shadow his fancy has\r\ndepicted; and when he finds himself outside his former state, he looks\r\nback with longing eyes at the once-scorned focus. What is the focus of a\r\nperpendicular on the tangent of an ellipse from any external point? Can\r\nit not be proved to be a _circle_? That is to say, he will be more\r\nconservative than ever. He would like to return to a primitive form of\r\ngovernment. Farewell to his wild schemes and revolutionary measures!\r\nFarewell to his disestablishments, abolitions, and suppressions! The\r\nthrone and government have new attractions in his eyes; loyalty, a new\r\nfeeling, asserts its benign influence; and if he could return to his\r\nformer position, his normal conduct would be straighter than ever, for\r\nby sad experience he has learned the value of those things which he once\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nBut we need not depend upon one proof alone. Exactly the same result may\r\nbe obtained from the well-known proposition which states that 'the angle\r\nbetween the tangent from any external point and the focal distance is\r\nequal to the angle between the other tangent and the focal distance.'\r\n\r\n3. The same opinions are often held by individuals in quite different\r\nwalks and classes of life. Let these individuals be represented by\r\npoints on an ellipse. Join these, and we have a system of parallel\r\nchords. Draw a straight line through the middle points of these chords,\r\nand lo! it will always pass through the centre. This shows that the\r\ncentral thought of all people is directed to the sovereign--that\r\n_loyalty_ is inherent in the hearts of those who recognise elliptical\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this lecture with a few remarks on the nature and\r\nproperties of the _radical axis_. This name was first given, I believe,\r\nby M. Gaultier, of Tours, and for a full account of its nature I refer\r\nyou to the _Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique_, xvi., 1813. The radical\r\naxis of two circles is the line perpendicular to the line joining the\r\ncentres, from any point of which the tangents to the circles are equal.\r\nLet us suppose that one circle becomes a point, and that this point is\r\nsituated on the circumference of the first circle. What is the result?\r\nThe radical axis becomes the tangent to the circle. Hence we may\r\nconclude that in a social system of monarchical government the radical\r\naxis is perpendicular to the line attaching the individual with the\r\nmonarch. Therefore we may conclude that the radical axis indicates a\r\ntendency of particles, or individuals, to fly off at a tangent, at right\r\nangles to the connecting-link between the individual and the king. When\r\nany motion takes place, this is evident, and this tendency is called\r\ncentrifugal force. Sad is it for the State when this force is called\r\ninto play, and the radical axis is a standing menace to the stability of\r\nStates and nations. The only way to counteract its baneful, disturbing\r\ninfluence is to increase the attraction of the monarch on the\r\nindividual, which nullifies the former force, and prevents further\r\nmischief. This is the method which nature itself adopts in the motions\r\nof the planetary worlds; the attraction of the sun prevents any\r\ndisturbance which might be caused in the course of the planets by the\r\naction of centrifugal force, and nature suggests this plan for our\r\nadoption. Increase the attraction of the Throne; rigidly connect each\r\nindividual by the strong chords of affection, advantage and utility with\r\nthe ruling power; and then, though the radical axis may be there, it\r\nwill cease to indicate any motion along it, it will not prevail over the\r\ncounteracting influence of loyalty, and the stability of the social\r\nsystem and the happiness of the individuals will be the results.\r\n\r\n                 'I would serve my King,\r\n    Serve him with all my fortune here at home,\r\n    And serve him with my person in the wars;\r\n    Watch for him, fight for him, bleed for him, die for him,\r\n    As every true-born subject ought.'\r\n\r\nThis, most noble professors, is the language of true patriotic loyalty.\r\nLet the monarch be loved and loving, let the laws be just and equal,\r\nhappy will be the people, prosperous the realm. There are those who\r\ncounsel different things, and preach sedition and the breaking-up of\r\nlaws; but those who advocate such doctrines lack that judicial\r\nmathematical training which we, students and professors of Girtham\r\nCollege, have acquired. If polemical mathematics, the science of the\r\nfuture, should become more widely studied; if its results were\r\ndisseminated far and wide; above all, if the proper position which women\r\nought to occupy in the counsels of the nation were assigned to them, we\r\nshould hear less of these wild schemes and foolish theories, and the\r\ninfluence of women would tend greatly to promote the stability and\r\nsecurity of the State.\r\n\r\nWhy, let me ask, should woman be excluded from that position which is so\r\njustly hers? from those duties which she can discharge so faithfully? It\r\nhas been said that if we wish to know the political and moral condition\r\nof a State, we must ask what rank women hold in it. We are told that\r\nwomen have more strength in their looks than men have in their laws.\r\nWhy, then, do men debar her from those fields of occupation wherein she\r\nmay labour for the nation's good, and use her influence, which they\r\nacknowledge to be great, in those callings wherein she may most easily\r\nbenefit the State, and the country she so ardently loves?\r\n\r\nAt some future time I hope to speak more fully on this subject; and in\r\nconcluding this lecture, I will remark that English politics need a\r\nleavening influence which will counteract the evil tendencies and\r\ncorrupt theories which, in spite of our advantageous social system, at\r\npresent exist; and this leavening influence will be best produced by\r\nthe admission of those into the counsels of the nation who are\r\nacknowledged to have a benign and healthy influence--the women of\r\nEngland. Let women have their proper share in the government of the\r\ncountry, and I have no fear lest we shall preserve our elliptical\r\nconstitution, and all the advantages which we at present enjoy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Editorial Note.]--In the bundle of papers which contained the foregoing\r\nlectures, some letters of great interest were found, which show that the\r\nfame of the learned Lady Professor of Girtham College had already gone\r\nabroad, and attracted the attention of the leading statesmen of the day.\r\nIt is to be regretted that the answers to these letters are not\r\nforthcoming, as it might be proved from them that the science of\r\npolemical mathematics has already influenced the minds of our\r\nlegislators in their conduct of affairs at home and abroad. The\r\nfollowing letter is of unique interest, and may be taken as evidence of\r\nthe favourable impression which this new science has made on the mind of\r\none of our greatest thinkers and statesmen:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Downing Street,\r\n                            May, 18--\r\n\r\nMy dear Lady Professor,--The report of the amazing results of your\r\nscientific researches has reached me, and I congratulate you most\r\nheartily on the originality and acumen which you have displayed in your\r\ninvestigations. A new light has dawned upon our country. Instead of\r\ngroping in the darkness of political warfare, ensnared by party ties and\r\njealousies, the statesmen of the future will be able to calculate and\r\ndetermine the correct course with mathematical precision and perfect\r\naccuracy. No one can dispute the truth of a proposition in Euclid, or\r\nthe genuineness of Newton's laws; and if your method enables men to\r\ncalculate and determine the correct political course of action, to solve\r\npolitical problems as easily as exponential equations, why--then adieu\r\nto the bickerings of party, the querulous complaints of the Opposition!\r\nNay, joy to the Ministry! There will be no Opposition! Our statesmen\r\nwill be able to guide the great ship of the State by means of charts\r\nwhich know no error; and they will resemble an association of savants\r\nmet together to determine the exact moment of the transit of Venus, or\r\nto examine the degree of density of a comet's tail.\r\n\r\nThis condition of Parliamentary procedure is much to be desired; you\r\nhave shown how such an ideal state of things may be obtained. In the\r\nname of the Government I thank you for your endeavours on behalf of your\r\ncountry's welfare, and look forward to a further development of your\r\nadmirably conceived system. As in the domain of ordinary science there\r\nare complex questions which defy the acumen of the philosopher; so in\r\npolemical science there may be questions which present the same\r\ndifficulties and complications. But as the first are daily yielding\r\nbefore the persevering attacks of the mathematician, so I doubt not\r\npolemical science will soon overcome the various problems which may\r\narise.\r\n\r\nBut it is mainly on my own account that I venture to address you. I\r\ndesire to consult you with regard to certain matters--political\r\ncomplications--which have recently occupied the attention of Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers. By the help of your new science, can you aid us\r\nin our deliberations? Of course, I am writing to you in _strict\r\nconfidence_, and beg that you will keep this communication profoundly\r\nsecret. I fear that would be a hard task for many of your sex, who do\r\nnot possess your knowledge and powers of mind; but I have great\r\nconfidence in your discretion.\r\n\r\nThese are the problems which are presented to us for solution:\r\n\r\n1. Some members of the Cabinet are secretly in favour of Protection, and\r\nthe country is rather stirred by the question. Can you, from your\r\nknowledge of the contact of curves and nations, help us to determine\r\nwhat course we ought to take with regard to Spain, for example? Are the\r\nprinciples of Adam Smith mathematically correct?\r\n\r\n2. I observe that England is represented mathematically by an ellipse.\r\nAre we right in assuming that Ireland is a portion of that ellipse? Or,\r\non the other hand, in our chart of nations, must we describe that\r\ntroublesome country as a rotating parabola, or complex figure,\r\naltogether outside our more favoured State?\r\n\r\n3. Do you consider, from your minute observation of our social system,\r\nthat the form of our elliptical government is gradually undergoing a\r\nchange, and that a revolutionary parabolic tendency is observable in the\r\naction of individual particles?\r\n\r\n4. Is it not possible that the differences in the policy of the various\r\nnations of Europe; the difficulties which beset the carrying out of\r\ninternational law; the jealousies, quarrels, and rivalries of States\r\nmight disappear, if the same form of government (_i.e._, elliptical)\r\nwere adopted in each?\r\n\r\nIf you will kindly favour Her Majesty's Ministers with your opinion on\r\nthese questions, they will owe you a debt of gratitude, which they, as\r\nrepresentatives of the nation, will do their utmost to repay.\r\n\r\nWith every good wish for your further success in the regions of\r\npolemical science,\r\n\r\n          I beg to remain,\r\n              My dear Lady Professor,\r\n                  Your faithful servant,\r\n                        +----------------------+\r\n                        |                      |\r\n                        |         [4]          |\r\n                        |                      |\r\n                        +----------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n[Editorial Note.]--The next letter is not of quite the same pleasing\r\nnature as the foregoing, and shows that it is impossible to please\r\neveryone, even if that happy consummation were desirable. This letter\r\nwas evidently called forth by some remarks which the learned Lady\r\nProfessor had made in her third lecture with reference to eccentricity\r\nin dress. Our readers will recollect that the professor pointed out that\r\nan extravagant 'bloomer' costume--half male, half female--was no more a\r\nsign of genius than aesthetic dresses, always betokened the artist.[5]\r\nThis latter statement evidently gave great offence to the members of a\r\nsociety which called itself the 'Aesthetic and Dress Improvement\r\nAssociation,' and the following letter is the result of one of their\r\nsolemn conclaves:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Oscar Villa, South Kensington,\r\n                            June, 18--.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Aesthetic and Dress Improvement Association presents\r\nhis compliments to the Lady Professor of Girtham College, and begs to\r\ncontradict emphatically her statements with regard to a subject upon\r\nwhich she is evidently in entire and lamentable ignorance, and to\r\nprotest against her aspersions upon the artistic studies of this and\r\nkindred societies. He begs to state that true aesthetes are _not_\r\neccentric (they leave that to lady professors and her Philistine\r\nfollowers); that to dress becomingly is one of the principal objects of\r\nlife, and that true greatness is achieved as much by the study of the\r\nart of dress as by any other noble pursuit or graceful accomplishment.\r\nAre not Horatio Postlethwaite, Leonara Saffronia Gillan, Vandyke\r\nSmithson entitled to greatness? And yet their laurels have been won\r\nsolely by the art of dress. Perhaps the lady professor has never read\r\n'Sartor Resartus'! In conclusion, he would ask the Lady Professor to\r\nrefrain from casting obloquy upon the work of the Association which he\r\nhas the honour to represent; to prevail upon her pupils to abandon the\r\nunfeminine attire which some of them have assumed, contrary to the first\r\nprinciples of art; to array themselves in flowing robes of sage-green\r\nand other choice colours (patterns enclosed), and to study art, instead\r\nof absurd mathematics, which no one can understand, and do no one any\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n     (Approved by the Committee of the Aesthetic and Dress\r\n      Improvement Association.)\r\n      June, 18--.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Editorial Note.]--The next letter, written by a pupil of the Lady\r\nProfessor, requires no explanation, and speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Jesus College, Cambridge,\r\n                            March, 18--.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tutor,\r\n\r\nYou will be glad to hear that after superhuman exertions I have at last\r\nsucceeded in passing my Little-go, and I am eternally grateful to you\r\nfor all you have done for me. I should never have got through if it had\r\nnot been for you. All the coaches in Cambridge would never have managed\r\nit, but you drove me through in a canter. And why? I never could make up\r\nmy mind to work for them; but when I coached with you, you made me like\r\nit. I almost revelled in the Binomial when you wrote it out for me; and\r\nthen I could not help listening to you; and you looked so grieved when I\r\nwould not learn, and made me feel such a brute; so somehow or other you\r\ndrove some mathematics into my head, and I pulled through. By-the-bye, I\r\nthink you must have tried the 'brain wave' dodge with the examiners, as\r\nfive out of the six propositions in Euclid, which you told me to get up\r\nspecially, were set! I wish I could read people's thoughts; can you read\r\nmine? If I were a Don, or a Fellow, or something, I would advise the\r\nUniversity to have some lady professors like you to teach the men,\r\ninstead of some of these sleepy old tutors. It would be a great\r\nimprovement, and I am sure we should get through a great deal more work.\r\n\r\nThey have given me a place in the Jesus Eight, which I shall take now\r\nthat I am released from your professorial ban, and have time for rowing.\r\nBut I don't half like giving up mathematics. You see, I have grown fond\r\nof the study. Do you think you could make a wrangler of me? At any rate,\r\nI should like to come to your lectures again. May I?\r\n\r\n                    Your Grateful Pupil.\r\n                         *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n  [4] It is to be regretted that this letter has evidently fallen\r\n      into the hands of some autograph collector, who has ruthlessly\r\n      cut off the signature; but the reader will easily determine,\r\n      after careful perusal of the document, from whose pen it emanated.\r\n\r\n  [5] Cf. page 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER V.\r\n\r\nA LECTURE UPON SOCIAL FORCES, WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF POLEMICAL KINEMATICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost noble Professors and Students of Girtham College,--Since last 'I\r\nwandered 'twixt the pole and heavenly hinges, 'mongst encentricals,\r\ncentres, concentricks, circles, and epicycles,' like the great\r\nAlbumazar, and found them full of life and wisdom for the guidance of\r\nour States and laws, I have turned my attention to the Applied\r\nMathematics, in order to determine what other truths this shaft may\r\nyield.\r\n\r\nThe strength of all sciences, according to Bacon, consists in their\r\nharmony; and it is truly marvellous how perfect this harmony is, if our\r\nears are tuned aright to hear it. We have observed how the beautiful\r\nand regular laws of curves and cones correspond to the social laws of\r\nStates and nations, guiding them as if by word of counsel, admonishing\r\nthem on what principle they ought to regulate their governments and\r\ninter-relations. We have seen that the laws which govern thought and\r\nlight and sound are almost identical, and that harmony pervades not\r\nmerely the ordinary sciences, but extends her benign influence over\r\nthese newly discovered fields of scientific research, which I claim to\r\nhave discovered.\r\n\r\nAll this may appear at first sight surprising; but the real philosopher,\r\nwho knows that all kinds of truth are intimately connected, will receive\r\nsuch revelations of science with satisfaction rather than astonishment;\r\nfor this new science, which has opened itself out before me, is only an\r\nextension of other well-known laws and discoveries which have come down\r\nto us from the remote past.\r\n\r\nIf my investigations should appear to you, most noble professors,\r\nsomewhat novel and imaginary, remember the maxim of the sage, that in\r\nthe infancy of science there is no speculation which does not merit\r\ncareful examination; and the most remote and fanciful explanations of\r\nfacts have often been found the true ones. Perhaps some\r\n'self-opinionated particle' (I speak mathematically) may have been\r\ninclined to laugh at our theories and discoveries, as the wise fools of\r\nthe day laughed at Kepler and his laws; but time has changed the world's\r\nlaughter into praise, and a century hence our discoveries may rank among\r\nthe achievements of modern science. As Cicero says, 'Time obliterates\r\nthe fictions of opinions, but confirms the decisions of nature.'\r\n\r\nI have not shunned, most noble professors, to enlist Imagination under\r\nthe banner of Geometry; for I am fully persuaded that it is a powerful\r\norgan of knowledge, and is as much needed by the mathematician as by the\r\npoet or novelist. It is, I fear, often banished with too much haste from\r\nthe fields of intellectual research by those who take upon themselves to\r\ngive laws to philosophy. We need imagination to form an hypothesis; and\r\nwithout hypotheses science would soon become a lifeless and barren\r\nstudy, a horse-in-the-mill affair ever strolling round and round,\r\nunconscious of the grinding corn. In my previous investigations my\r\nimagination pictured the symmetry of curves and States; the hypothesis\r\nfollowed that the laws which regulated them were identical, and you have\r\nobserved how the supposition was confirmed by our subsequent\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture I propose to examine some of the forces which exist in\r\nour social system, and shall endeavour to estimate them by methods of\r\nmathematical procedure and analogical reasoning. We will begin with the\r\nold definition of Force as _that which puts matter into motion, or which\r\nstops, or changes, a motion once commenced_. When a mass is in motion,\r\nit has a capacity for doing work, which is called _Energy_; and when\r\nthis energy is caused by the motion of a body it is called Kinetic\r\nEnergy (in mathematical language KE = 1/2 MV^2). Another form of kinetic\r\nenergy is called Potential Energy, which is in reality the capacity of a\r\nbody for doing work _owing to its position_. For example we may take an\r\nordinary eight-day clock. When the weights are wound up, they have a\r\ncertain amount of potential energy stored up, which will counteract the\r\nfriction of the wheels and the resistance of the air on the pendulum.\r\nOr, again, we have the example of a water-wheel: first the water in the\r\nreservoir, being higher than the wheel, has an amount of potential\r\nenergy. This is converted into kinetic energy in striking against the\r\npaddles, and after this we have potential energy again produced by the\r\naction of the fly-wheel.\r\n\r\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, if we consider the whole\r\nuniverse, not our planet alone (for its heat and energy are continually\r\ndiminished to some slight degree), we find that _no energy is lost_.\r\n\r\nForce is recognised as acting in two ways: in _Statics_, so as to compel\r\nrest, or to prevent change of motion; and in _Kinetics_, so as to\r\nproduce or to change motion; and the whole science which investigates\r\nthe action of force is called _Dynamics_.\r\n\r\nAll this is of course pure mathematics, and I have made these elementary\r\nobservations for the benefit of my younger hearers, the students of this\r\nUniversity. My grave and reverend seniors will pardon, I am sure, the\r\nrepetition of facts well known to them for the sake of those who are\r\nless informed than themselves.\r\n\r\nNow before I proceed further, I will endeavour to point out that these\r\nelementary truths of physical science hold good in our social system.\r\nEach individual is a mass, acted on by numerous forces, capable of\r\n'doing work,' which work can be measured and his velocity calculated.\r\nSome individuals have a vast _potential energy_; that is to say, from\r\ntheir position and station in the social system, they have a power which\r\nis capable of producing work which a less exalted individual has not.\r\nLike the weights in an eight-day clock, or the water in a reservoir,\r\nthey have a capacity for doing work, owing to the position to which\r\nthey have been raised. How vast the influence of a Primate or a Premier,\r\na General or a King! And yet their power is chiefly potential energy,\r\narising from the position they occupy, not from the individuals\r\nthemselves. Schiller has described this in poetical language, which,\r\nstrange to say, is mathematically correct:\r\n\r\n   'Yes, there's a patent of nobility\r\n      Above the meanness of our common state;\r\n    With what they _do_ the vulgar natures buy\r\n      Their titles; and with what they _are_, the _great_.'\r\n\r\nOther forces may have raised these men to their exalted positions; but\r\ntheir influence is due to their height, their potential energy. Placed\r\non a lower level, they would cease to have that power. How calm the\r\ndignity of this potential rank! The water in the reservoir is scarcely\r\nruffled or disturbed, as if unconscious of its power; when it has lost\r\nits force it rushes along with a sullen murmur and a roar, howling and\r\nhissing and boiling in endless torture, until--\r\n\r\n   'It gains a safer bed, and steals at last\r\n    Along the mazes of the quiet vale.'\r\n\r\nSo the vulgar crowd rushes on, with plenty of kinetic force, making\r\nnoise enough and looking very busy; while those who seem to sleep in\r\ncalm forgetfulness, exercise their potential energy, and do the real\r\nwork of turning the great engine of the State.\r\n\r\nThere are attractive and repulsive forces (more commonly the latter, the\r\ncynic will say) in our social system, but each individual is the centre\r\nof various forces acting upon him. In nature all matter possesses the\r\nforce of gravity, and whatever the size of two particles may be, they\r\nmutually attract each other. The earth attracts the moon; the moon\r\nattracts the earth. A stone thrown up into the air exercises an\r\ninfinitesimal force upon the earth; so in the social system every\r\nindividual, however small and insignificant he may be, exercises some\r\nattractive force upon his neighbour. There is no one in the world who\r\ndoes not exercise some influence for good or for evil upon his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe force of _cohesion_ is manifest in society as in nature, that force,\r\nI mean, which resists the separation of a body's particles. Different\r\nbodies possess different powers of cohesion, _e.g._, the cohesion of\r\nchalk is far less than that of flint embedded in it; even the same body\r\npossesses different powers of cohesion in different directions, _e.g._,\r\nit is easier to split wood in the direction of the fibres than\r\nperpendicular to them. If by our old principle of continuity we change\r\nthe words 'bodies' into 'States' or 'individuals,' we shall see that the\r\nsame laws hold good in social science as in natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nThese are a few analogous laws which I have taken almost at random; but\r\nit must strike the most casual listener to my remarks that it is\r\nwondrous strange that men, regarded as social beings, should possess the\r\nsame qualities, and be governed by the same laws, as the rest of\r\n_matter_. As Bishop Butler says, 'the force of analogy consists in the\r\nfrequency of the supposed analogous facts, and the real resemblance of\r\nthe things compared.' It appeals to the reasoning faculty, and may form\r\na solid argument. Hence, if we can prove the similarity of various laws\r\nand conditions, we may not be wrong in assuming by analogy the identity\r\nof those laws and conditions.\r\n\r\nI have stated my case in this manner in order to convince the\r\ngainsayers, if any such there be, and to banish any doubts or\r\nquestionings which may have arisen in your minds. I will now proceed\r\nwith some further investigations, full of the most profound interest\r\nand importance.\r\n\r\nDoubtless many of the lady-students present are in the habit of\r\nwelcoming peaceful evening in with a potent draught of 'the cup which\r\ncheers but not inebriates;' and as men are great flatterers (for\r\nimitation is the greatest flattery), I believe the male portion of my\r\naudience have been known to follow that excellent example. Some perhaps\r\nare in the habit of burning the midnight oil, and keep their eyes open\r\nby means of this fruit of the hermit's pious zeal, endowed by high\r\nomnipotence with the power of hindering sleep;[6] but that practice I\r\ndo not advise, as that delicate portion of our system, the nerves,\r\nespecially of women, often becomes injured by such stimulating doses.\r\nHowever, you will have observed (if you do not follow the modern\r\npernicious fashion of taking tea without sugar) that numerous bubbles\r\nare formed upon the surface of the liquid. After a few moments these\r\nunite into one central mass of bubbles by the force of mutual\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nIt appears from considerations which are detailed in works on physical\r\nastronomy, that two particles of matter placed at any sensible distance\r\napart attract each other with a force directly proportional to the\r\nproduct of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of\r\ntheir distance.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that we have a number of circular masses situated upon a\r\nplane surface, they will attract each other with a force which may be\r\ndetermined with exactitude; and the greater the masses the greater the\r\nforce. We will now apply this to polemical science. The agricultural\r\nsettlement is the first stage in the civilization and formation of a\r\nState. How did this arise? First, a single family immigrated to some\r\nuncultivated parts of the country, perhaps accompanied by others, who\r\nformed a little colony. Other settlements were made in other parts of\r\nthe land; and thus the country became overspread with these detached and\r\nseparate communities. An eminent writer declares that these settlements\r\ncan be traced in the beginnings of every race which has made progress;\r\nthat they were characteristic of those races in Greece and Italy, in\r\nAsia and Africa, which grew into the opulent and famous cities in which\r\nso much in the early history of civilization was developed. The colonies\r\nof England have been formed in the same way, just as in olden time\r\nEngland itself was occupied when the Roman power ceased.\r\n\r\nThese settlements correspond to the circular masses situated on the\r\nplane surface; they were quite separate from each other, each having its\r\nown laws, its own headman or ruler, its own assembly or parish council.\r\nBut as time elapsed, the force of mutual attraction set in; by degrees\r\nthese separate settlements were drawn together by force which increased\r\nin proportion as the settlements increased; until at last one united\r\nkingdom was formed under one king, governed by uniform laws and\r\nregulations. The bubbles have blended, the circles have come together,\r\nand one large circle or other curve is the result. This may be called\r\nthe _Law of Social Attraction_. In accordance with the results of one\r\nof my previous lectures, I have taken the circle as representing the\r\nsimplest form of government, which figure, in the case of the elementary\r\nsettlements, must have been small.\r\n\r\nMany of you, most noble professors, are doubtless accustomed to make\r\nexperiments with the microscope. I will suggest a simple one, which\r\nillustrates very forcibly what I am endeavouring to show you. Take some\r\nparticles of copper, and scatter them at intervals over the surface of\r\nan object-glass, and pour some sulphuric acid upon the glass. Now, what\r\nis the result? A beautiful network of apparently golden texture spreads\r\nitself gradually over the whole area of the glass. Steadily it pursues\r\nits way, and the result is beautiful to behold. The minute particles of\r\ncopper were the original settlements scattered over the land; the\r\nsulphuric acid the civilizing agent; and the final picture of a united\r\ncivilized homogeneous nation is well represented by the progressive and\r\nfinally glorious network of gold. This example is of course outside our\r\npresent subject, but it serves as a beautiful illustration.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the attractive force exercised by small communities\r\nupon each other, I may mention the united kingdom of Germany, which is\r\ncomposed of numerous small States and nations, which have been drawn\r\ntogether by the power of mutual attraction. Until recently they were\r\neach self-contained, separate constitutions, with their own kings and\r\nforms of government; but the attracting force, assisted by forces from\r\nwithout, has proved too much for them, and the great and powerful united\r\nkingdom of Germany is the result.\r\n\r\nBut why, you may ask, have not the people in Hindustan united in the\r\nsame way? There the agricultural settlements remain as they did ages\r\nago; separate petty chieftains rule under the all-governing power of\r\nEngland. Why have they not united?\r\n\r\nTo this objection I reply that there is in social science, as in Nature,\r\na _vis inertia_; that is to say, there is a tendency in matter to remain\r\nat rest if unmoved by any external agency, and also of persisting to\r\nmove, after it has once been set in motion. The _vis inertia_ of some\r\nbodies is greater than that of others, and depends upon their weight\r\nand density. Now it so happens that the moral _vis inertia_ of the\r\nHindustani is very great, hence their tendency to amalgamation is\r\nsmall. They remain in the state in which they happen to be.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the inertia of Englishmen is small, of Englishwomen\r\nsmaller, and therefore their power of combining is greater. Here let me\r\nobserve that the quality of inertia is one which ought to be removed as\r\nfar as possible from each social system. Inertia was regarded as a\r\ncapital crime by the Egyptians. Solon ordained that inert persons should\r\nbe put to death, and not contaminate the community. As savages bury\r\nliving men, so does inertia practise the same barbarous custom upon\r\nStates and individuals. Observe the putrid state of inert water, the\r\nclear and sparkling beauty of the moving stream, bearing away by the\r\nforce of its own motion aught that might contaminate it. Men more often\r\nresemble the stagnant water than the rivulet. A healthy social state\r\nenforces labour by natural laws, and banishes inertia as much as\r\npossible from the system. If the principles of some noisy English\r\npoliticians were fully carried out, and all things made '_free_,'\r\ninertia would be increased, and listless indolence pervade the masses of\r\nour countrymen. I may say that inertia is not entirely unknown in our\r\nsister University of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe existence of social forces is supported by the testimony of Dr.\r\nTyndall, who plainly recognises their power, though he does not attempt\r\nto expound their origin. 'Thoughtful minds are driven to seek, in the\r\ninteraction of social forces, the genesis and development of man's moral\r\nnature. If they succeed in their search--and I think they are sure to\r\nsucceed--social duty would be raised to a higher level of significance,\r\nand the deepening sense of social duty would, it is to be hoped, lessen,\r\nif not obliterate, the strife and heart-burnings which now beset and\r\ndisguise our social life.' I accept with gratification Dr. Tyndall's\r\nconclusions: to determine, examine, trace, calculate these social forces\r\nwhich exercise such a powerful influence on our characters, our lives,\r\nour customs, which produce the greatness of the State, or drag it down\r\nwith irresistible strength from its pinnacle of glory to an abyss of\r\ndegradation; to estimate such forces is the great and noble object of\r\nour lectures and researches in this University. Prosecute, most noble\r\nprofessors, your studies in this direction with all the energy of your\r\nenlightened intellects, and there is yet hope that this new science,\r\nwhich I have endeavoured to sketch out, however feebly, may be the means\r\nof saving our beloved nation from degradation and ruin, and raising her\r\nto a higher level of glory and honour. I hope to continue the subject of\r\nsocial forces in my next lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [6] A Chinese legend relates that a pious hermit, who in his\r\n      watchings and prayers had often been overtaken by sleep, so\r\n      that his eyelids closed, in holy wrath against the weakness\r\n      of the flesh, cut them off, and threw them on the ground. But\r\n      a god caused a tea-shrub to spring out of them, the leaves of\r\n      which exhibit the form of an eyelid bordered with lashes, and\r\n      possess the gift of hindering sleep.--Dr. Ure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER VI.\r\n\r\nON SOCIAL FORCES (_continued_)--POLEMICAL STATICS AND DYNAMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost Noble Professors and Students of Girtham,--We have embarked upon\r\na stormy sea of speculation, on a voyage of grand discovery, and the\r\ndangerous waves of adverse criticism, and the deceptive under-current of\r\nprejudice, often make the steersman's lot by no means an enviable one.\r\nBut our vessel is sound and perfectly equipped, and therefore I do not\r\nfear to guide her across the great unknown.\r\n\r\nIt may have occurred to you that the problems which present themselves\r\nfor solution in social science are far more difficult and complicated\r\nthan those which arise in ordinary mathematics. That is undoubtedly the\r\ncase; but this extra degree of difficulty is due to the fact that we\r\nmake no assumptions; we take the things as they really are, not as they\r\nare assumed to be. In physical science, if we take into consideration\r\nthe resistance of the air, the curvature of the earth, the rigid\r\nconnection which exists between particles in the same body, and a host\r\nof other things which are often conveniently neglected in elementary\r\nworks, how complicated the various problems become! So we must not be\r\nsurprised at some of the difficulties which occur in social science, as\r\nnothing is neglected; the whole problem is before us, and having solved\r\nit we need not make allowances for any falsely assumed _data_.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that other professors of this science may come to\r\nslightly different conclusions to those which I have arrived at. That\r\nis only to be expected, because their original observations may have\r\nslightly varied. But in physical science allowances are made for\r\ndifferent observers. In astronomy, for example, we find the value of the\r\n'Personal Equation.' One observer on looking through the telescope may\r\ntake the meridian of a star rather differently from another watcher of\r\nthe heavenly bodies, and the _personal equation_ is used to make\r\nallowances for this quickness, or slowness, of observation. So in social\r\nscience there must be a personal equation too, and our object ought to\r\nbe, in the ordinary affairs of life as well as in the higher duties of\r\nscientific action, to make our personal equation as small as possible.\r\nBut until the old proverb, '_Quot homines, tot sententiae_,' has ceased\r\nto have any meaning, there will be abundant need of this most useful aid\r\nto accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe close connection which exists between social forces and material\r\nforces is plainly shown by the doctrine of the conservation of energy.\r\n'This doctrine,' says Dr. Tyndall, 'recognises in the material universe\r\na constant sum of power made up of items among which the most Protean\r\nfluctuations are incessantly going on. It is as if the body of nature\r\nwere alive, the thrill and interchange of its energies resembling those\r\nof an organism. The parts of the stupendous whole shift and change,\r\naugment and diminish, appear and disappear; while the total of which\r\nthey are the parts remains quantitatively immutable, _plus_ accompanies\r\n_minus_, gain accompanies loss, no item varying in the slightest degree\r\nwithout an absolutely equal change of some other item in the opposite\r\ndirection.' So do the forces in the social world ebb and flow, rise and\r\nfall, carrying on the same universal law which regulates the energy of\r\nmaterial force.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to enumerate some of those forces which exercise such\r\na powerful influence on society.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us take the force of _Public Opinion_, which seems to\r\nexercise a relentless sway over the minds and manners of men. This is a\r\nvery subtle and secret force, which is most difficult to trace, and\r\nresembles electricity in the science of physics. We cannot see it, but\r\nare only able to judge of its power by its results. Its point of\r\napplication is not in the individual, but in the collection of\r\nindividuals who make up the social system; and it is, in reality, the\r\nresultant of, or the compromise between, the various elementary forces\r\nwhich make up human society. Yes, compromise is a purely mechanical\r\naffair, based on the principle of the parallelogram of forces; and as\r\npublic opinion is the result of a compromise, we may calculate its\r\nforce. For example: 'It is required to know the state of public opinion\r\nin the matter of politics, when the results of a General Election show\r\nthat the Conservatives are to the Liberals as 10 : 9.'\r\n\r\nLet OC be the direction of the Conservative force.\r\n\r\nLet OL be that of the Liberal.\r\n\r\nThen by _data_ OC : OL :: 10 : 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nComplete the parallelogram, and join OP.\r\n\r\nThen OP represents the force of public opinion in magnitude and\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nN.B.--The direction of OL is determined by the amount of deviation of\r\nthe policy of the Liberals from that of the Conservatives.\r\n\r\nAs in physical, so in social science, impulsive forces sometimes act,\r\nand effectually disturb our system and our calculations. Public opinion\r\nis very liable to the action of disturbing forces. Panic is an impulsive\r\nforce, which defies the power of the most learned professors of social\r\nscience to determine its magnitude and direction. Some strange\r\nunforeseen catastrophe--the fascination caused by a brilliant and\r\nunscrupulous orator, a cruel wrong, a blind revenge for real or\r\nimaginary injustice--will sometimes rouse one element of passion latent\r\nin the vast body of public opinion; so that it breaks with all that\r\nhitherto restrained and balanced it, and precipitates society into a\r\ncourse of conduct inconsistent with its former behaviour, and bloodshed,\r\nrevolution, the breaking-up of laws, are the terrible results of panic\r\nor revengeful passion.\r\n\r\nSociety is, as it were, split up by the terrible action of such\r\nimpulsive forces, just as wood is split up by the repeated blows of the\r\nhatchet. It is, therefore, the duty of statesmen to increase the power\r\nor force of cohesion, to strengthen the fibres of the State, so that the\r\nforce of such impulsive blows may not be felt, nor disturb the\r\ncontinuity of the framework of the State. If such measures had been\r\nadopted in the neighbouring country of France, much misery might have\r\nbeen avoided, and the terrible revolutions which have so frequently\r\nconvulsed her social system entirely prevented.\r\n\r\n_Friction_ is another disturbing element in our calculations, and\r\nalthough it may be made a useful servant, it is a bad master in\r\nmathematics, as in polemics. Without the aid of friction, progress would\r\nbe impossible. For example: Take the case of a man with perfectly smooth\r\nskates on perfectly hard, smooth ice; he would be unable to reach the\r\nland unless he had provided himself with some stones, by throwing which\r\nhe would just be able to get to his destination by a backward motion.\r\nThe engine would be unable to proceed on its iron road if it were not\r\nfor friction. The same is true in polemical science: the government of\r\nthe country would not be able to be carried on under our present\r\nconditions if it were not for _party friction_. But suppose it increased\r\nindefinitely, party friction becomes party _obstruction_; and the engine\r\nof the State would no longer proceed smoothly and evenly along its\r\nappointed course at the rate of sixty miles an hour, but would resemble\r\nan old-fashioned coach, up to its axle-trees in mud, its motion\r\naltogether stopped by the action of party friction.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that forces have two ways of acting: that of compelling\r\nrest and that of producing motion. In statics forces act so as to\r\nprevent any change of motion, or disturb the body's original position.\r\nIn kinetics, on the contrary, the power is recognised as acting so as to\r\nproduce or change a body's motion. Now, in polemical science we have\r\nthese two ways of considering the action of forces. There is the\r\n_statical_ or _conservative_ force, which compels rest, which seeks\r\nsecurity, stability, and peace, and is not ardently devoted to change.\r\nIt reduces the system to equilibrium. There are, of course, two kinds of\r\nequilibrium--_stable_ and _unstable_--according as the social and\r\npolitical system is in a healthy or unhealthy state. If a body is in\r\nstable equilibrium, and any slight motion takes place, the body will\r\nreturn immediately to its former position; but if in unstable, it will\r\ndecline further and further away from its original position, and be\r\nentirely upset. So a healthy and sound conservative equilibrium is not\r\ndisturbed by outside forces, and the State will resume its former\r\nposition of stability and rest when the opposing force is withdrawn. But\r\nan unhealthy and insecure conservatism is as easily disturbed as an egg\r\nbalanced on its narrow end.\r\n\r\nThe kinetics of society, that is to say the Radical way of estimating\r\nforce, is the party of motion, generally supposed to be the 'party of\r\nprogress.' It has therefore many attractions in the eyes of those who\r\ndelight in motion, speed, and rushing about. To run at full speed, to\r\nfeel the keen air upon one's face, to experience the delightful\r\nsensation of freedom of will, and limb, are joys which cannot be denied.\r\nSuch exercise is beneficial to the system, bodily or political. Motion\r\nis the life of all things; it is characteristic of nature; it adores\r\nnature; because it is an emblem and characteristic of life. The\r\nceaseless rolling of the ocean waves, the swaying of the trees, the\r\nbending of the flowers, the waving of the corn, all these fill us with\r\npleasure; whereas a flat uninteresting plain, unrelieved by the motion\r\nof terrestrial objects, is depressing to the spirit. So there is much to\r\nbe said in favour of motion, and Carlyle has defined progress as 'living\r\nmovement.' And men love this 'living movement,' and take up the\r\nLaureate's cry:\r\n\r\n               'Forward, forward, let us range,\r\n    Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing\r\n                Grooves of change.'\r\n\r\nBut, after all, there is a danger in this everlasting motion. We cannot\r\ntell whither this progress may lead. It may be along a safe sure road;\r\nbut perchance a precipice may open out before us; and rejoicing in the\r\nacceleration of our velocity, with eyes intent upon some distant heights\r\nof glory and ambition, we may not discover our danger until it is too\r\nlate to stop, and a terrible plunge into an unknown abyss of turmoil and\r\ntumultuous waves is the alarming result of an unguarded policy of\r\nunrestrained 'progress.' I recall to my mind the quaint words of Holmes\r\nwhich aptly illustrate my contention.\r\n\r\n   'If the wild filly, \"Progress\", thou would'st ride,\r\n    Have young companions ever at thy side;\r\n    But wouldst thou stride the staunch old mare, \"Success,\"\r\n    Go with thine elders, though they please thee less.'\r\n\r\nProgress and success do not always go together hand in hand; and while\r\nmotion is essential to life, it is not always safe to urge a country\r\nforward at too great a speed; and security and stability are quite as\r\nimportant to the nation's life as actual progress.\r\n\r\nThere are other impulsive forces which act occasionally in the sphere\r\nof politics, and which baffle all our calculations, and exclude\r\nscientific considerations of the polemical problems which arise.\r\n_Ambition_ is such an impulsive force, and when the rulers of the people\r\nare actuated by it, and struggle for money, place, and power, politics\r\nis degraded from its position as a science, and it becomes impossible to\r\nestimate the result of forces so generated.\r\n\r\nIn my next lecture I propose to treat the important subject of the Laws\r\nwhich govern States and Governments, and which regulate, generate, and\r\ncontrol the social forces which we have seen at work in the body\r\npolitic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER VII.\r\n\r\nLAWS OF POLITICAL MOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the last time I had the honour of addressing you on polemical\r\nmatters, I have met with a passage in the writings of M. Auguste Comte\r\nwhich afforded me much pleasure. It seemed to be the one word for which\r\nI had been waiting, and confirmed many of my own impressions and\r\nspeculations. He lays down two propositions: first, that the\r\nconstructive politics of the future must be based on the history of the\r\npast; and second, that political science is a composite study, and\r\npresupposes the complete apprehension of every branch of science,\r\nbeginning with the physical, such as astronomy, and ending with the\r\nmoral, such as ethics and sociology. M. Comte evidently does not regard\r\nas a vain dream and imaginative speculation the theory that it will be\r\npossible for statesmen to calculate a policy, and to determine a course\r\nof action by purely scientific considerations. May I entertain the hope\r\nthat in this university, where all branches of physical science have\r\nfound a home, and are studied by most able and learned professors, the\r\nscience of politics may be pursued under most favourable circumstances?\r\nI trust that each professor will bring before me the results of their\r\ndeliberations, and contribute to the growth of this particular science\r\nfor which our university has already become deservedly famous.\r\n\r\nMy present lecture is devoted to the important consideration of _Law_.\r\nAt first sight it may appear to you that the wills and passions of\r\nmankind are so diverse and unknowable, that it would be absurd to\r\nsuppose that they can be calculated, or rendered amenable to any law.\r\nBut Professor Amos has pointed out that in proportion as we examine\r\nhistory, and compare the actions present and past of different nations\r\nand states, the more uniform does human nature appear; the more\r\ncalculable the actions, sentiments, and emotions of large masses of\r\npeople. As we have already stated, the difficulties of the study are not\r\nlikely to deter the professors of Girtham College from the pursuit of\r\nany particular branch of science.\r\n\r\n_A priori_ we might suppose from analogy that these polemical laws\r\nexisted, as there is no department of nature which is not governed by\r\nlaw. It is an essential feature in nature, and also in government. What\r\nis political economy but the study of certain laws of nature? These were\r\nfirst discovered by Adam Smith, and have since been traced and estimated\r\nby such men as Ricardo, the two Mills, Professor Cairnes, Jevons, and\r\nmany others. Moreover, our physical constitutions are governed by laws,\r\nwhich physicians have determined, and which it is perilous to resist.\r\nOur moral constitution is also governed by laws, which evidently exist,\r\nalthough it is difficult to find them out. But the nation is only an\r\nassemblage of individuals; and since individuals are so governed, it is\r\nonly natural to suppose that the nation, composed of individuals, is so\r\nconstituted and controlled. And not only is that true, but we shall see\r\nthat polemical laws are as permanent and universal, as invariable and\r\nirreversible, as the laws of nature which regulate the courses of the\r\nheavenly bodies, and raise the tides, or depress the sandstone hills.\r\n\r\nWe may notice first the preponderant impulse observable in a nation's\r\nlife in favour of supporting existing facts and institutions; and every\r\nreformer has discovered the difficulty and danger of changing or\r\nopposing the customs and habits of the people. As a wheel will travel\r\nmost smoothly along a well-worn groove, whereby friction is diminished,\r\nso there is a natural national tendency always to run along those paths\r\nwith which the habits and customs of the people have made them familiar.\r\nThis law is nothing else than Newton's first law of motion, which is\r\nquite as applicable to human masses as to lifeless matter. The tendency\r\nof matter to remain at rest, if unmoved by any external agency, and of\r\npersisting to move after it has once been set in motion, is a\r\nconservative tendency; and is as true in political science as in any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe special branch of our science, which we may call the _Biology of\r\nPolitics_, shows how absolute is the domain of law in polemical matters.\r\nThe law of human life is that men are born, grow, become strong and\r\nvigorous, and then decay and die. This is the law of life, to which we\r\nmust all yield an enforced obedience. This same law is observed to be at\r\nwork in the heavenly bodies; and astronomy shows us that planets are\r\nborn, flourish, and at length die, just as our human bodies do. The moon\r\nis, as you may have observed, a dead planet, such as our earth may be\r\nsome day. The same growth and decay are also manifest in national life.\r\nFirst, there is the birth of the nation, which sometimes lies a long\r\ntime in a dormant state, and then wakes up to life and energy. China and\r\nRussia are examples of dormant States, just waking from a long sleep of\r\nchildishness and ignorance. The next stage is the strong an healthy\r\nperiod of its existence, which England is at present enjoying; and then,\r\nafter various stages of gradual decline, we come to the senile period of\r\nnational life, when every energy and faculty, every national feeling and\r\npower of invention, are completely exhausted. As an example of this\r\ndepressing condition, we may mention Turkey and several of the effete\r\nStates of South America. Sometimes, when life is nearly extinct in the\r\nhuman body, physicians have made use of the power of galvanism, in order\r\nto revive the dying energies. This process of galvanizing a State into\r\nlife was tried by Lord Palmerston and others on the worn-out frame of\r\nTurkey. But such attempts can only meet with partial and transitory\r\nsuccess; and where the loss of national power and faculty betokens the\r\nsenile period of the nation's existence, it is vain to attempt to\r\nrestore its former life and energy. The study of the biology of\r\npolitics presents many interesting and important details in this special\r\nbranch of knowledge; and I commend this part of our subject to the\r\nspecial attention of the professor of physiology. The law of development\r\nis observable in nations as in nature. Recent scientific discoveries\r\nhave tended to take away all ideas of _chance_ in the workings of\r\nnature, and have substituted _law_ instead of it. It would be\r\nunscientific and incorrect to speak of the world being formed by the\r\n'fortuitous concourse of atoms.' So we cannot speak of a State being\r\ngenerated in this manner. Laws--economical, geographical,\r\nnatural--preside over the formation of States and nations, and produce\r\ntheir further development.\r\n\r\nThe laws of political motion occupy the same prominent place in our new\r\nscience as Newton's laws do in ordinary dynamics. These are very\r\nimportant in calculating the positions which various States will occupy\r\nin the future. First, we have the _doctrine of nationality_, which\r\nprevented the progress of Austria into Italy, and of the Bourbons in\r\nNaples, and produced the amalgamation of the small German States in the\r\ngreat empire of Germany. The second law of political motion is the\r\ndoctrine of the _independence_ of all true States, and the equality of\r\nall States to each other. This had its growth in feudalism; and all the\r\nchief wars of modern times have been the result of the efforts of nature\r\nto establish this law of independence. The doctrine of intervention is a\r\nmodification of the preceding law, and is applicable when the law of\r\nnecessity demands its use, such as the restoration of order after\r\nprotracted anarchy, the abolition of slave trade, etc. The third law is\r\nthe _law of morality_. Just as for each man there exists a _right_ and a\r\n_wrong_; just as _duty_ and _conscience_ are certain elements in his\r\ndaily motion, which dictate his course of action, although he may chose\r\nto neglect them; so a nation is bound by the same moral laws which\r\ngovern the individual; and a nation errs if it transgresses them.\r\nChristianity is the agent which has produced so powerful an influence\r\nin making men obey the dictates of conscience and walk in the path of\r\nduty; and I read with thankfulness the conclusion of Mr. Amos, that\r\nChristianity has triumphed quite as much in moralizing secular politics\r\nas it has in the sphere of individual life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese are some of the principal laws of motion which I have observed at\r\nwork in various States and nations. Inasmuch as political science\r\nembraces, in addition to the physical sciences, all those branches which\r\nare contained in ethics, economics, jurisprudence, sociology and others,\r\nthe laws of each are generally applicable to the whole grand subject of\r\nwhich my lectures treat. Other general laws may be deduced, and have\r\nbeen enumerated in my previous lectures, from the social properties of\r\ncurves and conics; and when our researches are complete we may hope to\r\nproduce a code of laws for the guidance of our statesmen which maybe of\r\nimmense use in determining the policies of the future. Already there is\r\nstrong evidence that the affairs of this country are being conducted on\r\nsound scientific principles, rather than by any species of guess-work or\r\nhaphazard contrivances. The use of history is recognised as extremely\r\nimportant in determining a future line of conduct; and statesmen are in\r\nthe habit of endeavouring to find from their study of the past what is\r\nthe logical sequence of events. Just as mathematicians endeavour to\r\ndetermine the law of a series of figures, and having found the law, can\r\nwrite down the next, and the next, _ad infinitum_; so scientific\r\npoliticians may be able soon to establish the various laws of a series\r\nof events, and calculate their course of actions. That there is\r\nconsiderable progress in this direction is manifest by the value which\r\nthey place upon statistics, and their continued use of this important\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThere are a few great evils in our present system which are strongly\r\nopposed to any scientific methods in politics; and in the interests of\r\nthe country as well as those of science they ought to be removed. One\r\ngreat evil is the want of political and scientific knowledge on the part\r\nof the electors, who are in the habit of choosing their representatives\r\non personal grounds, or party considerations, rather than on sound\r\nprinciples of political science. All this is opposed to any idea of law.\r\nOwing to the ignorance of the electors they fall an easy prey to\r\nadventurers and unprincipled politicians, who make all kinds of specious\r\npromises, tempt them with all manner of baits, and make self-interest\r\ninstead of the welfare of the State the principle of voting. Selfishness\r\nis the ruin of social life and intercourse, the destroyer of all\r\nhappiness, peace, and mutual trust in family life or in society. It is\r\nthe root of most of the faults, vices, and crimes in the individual; and\r\nwho can tell the endless disasters which will befall the State, where\r\nselfishness is the chief motive-power of the electors and the elected? A\r\nselfish statesman, one who goes into Parliament to gain his own ends and\r\nforward his own personal interests, is a disgrace to society--\r\n\r\n   'Feeling himself, his own low self, the whole,\r\n    When he by sacred sympathy might make\r\n    The whole one self. Self, that no alien knows!\r\n    Self, far diffused as fancy's wing can travel!\r\n    Self, spreading still, oblivious of its own,\r\n    Yet all of all possessing!'\r\n\r\nI have said that the ignorance of the electorate makes them an easy prey\r\nto such men; and until they have learnt to detect the false from the\r\ntrue, until they become acquainted with the elements of political\r\nscience, and have been taught that their own selfish interests are not\r\nthe highest aims of social government, it is vain to hope for a\r\nreasonable method of regulating the affairs of the nation, based upon\r\nlogical laws and scientific principles.\r\n\r\nAnd how is this work of educating the electors to be accomplished? Not,\r\nI maintain, by furious speeches and rhetorical displays; not by bribery,\r\nbaits and banter; but by patient, never-ceasing labour, by lectures on\r\nhistory and science, by individual instruction, is the great work to be\r\naccomplished upon which the security and stability of the country\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\nThen we may hope that the 'Reign of Law' in polemical science may be\r\nushered in with the joyful acclamations of an enlightened and united\r\npeople, and its benign influence extend from the throne of the monarch\r\nand the council-chamber of his ministers to the hearth of the cottager.\r\nPoliticians will rule by law; policies be calculated by laws; people\r\nvote by law; and then methinks I see in my mind (to use the words of the\r\nblind old poet) a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like a\r\nstrong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks; methinks I see\r\nher as an eagle, renewing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled\r\neyes at the full mid-day beam; purging and unsealing her long-abused\r\nsight at the fountain itself of heavenly radiance; while the whole noise\r\nof timorous and flocking birds flutter about amazed at what she means.\r\nSuch is the glorious vision of the 'Reign of Law.' Let it be the\r\nbusiness of every Englishman and Englishwoman to arrange the framework\r\nof our social and political system, that law may have an uninterrupted\r\nsway; then shall we be a united, prosperous, and contented people, and\r\nthe reign of lawless agitators, bribery-mongers, and counterfeit\r\nstatesmen will have passed away into the oblivion and obscurity of a\r\nmore suitable but less favoured region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER VIII.\r\n\r\nON THE PRINCIPLE OF POLEMICAL COHESION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my previous lectures I have had occasion to mention the principle of\r\ncohesion; but it plays so vital a part in the constitution of States and\r\ntheir relations to each other that I consider it advisable to devote\r\nthis lecture entirely to it.\r\n\r\nThis is a large and comprehensive subject, and embraces such principles\r\nas the Centralization of States; the Co-operation of States; Monogamic\r\nMarriage; Unions; Free Trade, and many others equally important. We have\r\nalready noticed that cohesion is a well-known property of matter; that\r\nits influence is not confined to the regions of physical sciences; and\r\nthat it is the manifest duty of all governments to increase the force\r\nof cohesion.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been tried to accomplish this purpose. The\r\nprinciple of Feudalism was one of the earliest attempts to produce the\r\ncohesion of the nation; and, in an elementary condition of society, it\r\nwas partly successful. The theories of 'Divine Right' and 'Social\r\nContract' were other methods which have been adopted; and the unity of\r\nthe Christian Church has been the great means of producing the cohesion\r\nof the State in olden times; and its aid may be again required for the\r\nsame beneficent object in future complications and social disruptions.\r\n\r\nBut it is always advantageous in scientific pursuits to go back to first\r\nprinciples; and we will adopt that method in our present investigations.\r\nThe social unit is the family; the multiplication of families makes the\r\ntribe; the multiplication of tribes makes the State; and, therefore, we\r\nshall not be far wrong if we consider the family tie as the first\r\nprinciple of political cohesion. I am in agreement with several learned\r\nthinkers upon this subject when I say that marriage is a most important\r\npolitical factor; and as marriage cannot take place without women, it is\r\nevident that women play a very important part in promoting the cohesion\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nThis prominent position was duly assigned to women by one of our\r\ngreatest political philosophers, M. Auguste Comte, who strongly opposed\r\nthe fatal fallacy of ancient political systems, which greatly\r\noverestimated the powers of men, and depreciated those of women. If the\r\nsuperiority of bodily strength be the sole cause of greatness in\r\npolitical and intellectual pursuits, then, most noble lords of creation,\r\nwe yield to you the palm--you are our masters in this respect. But if,\r\non the other hand, it can be shown that physical strength is not a\r\nrequisite for great achievements in these occupations; if the powers of\r\nendurance, elasticity, adaptability, nervous energy, and patience are\r\nquite as needful as mere animal strength; then we women are quite as\r\ncapable, and indeed more capable than men, for achieving political\r\ngreatness. In the 'good old days,' when the law of might was right, and\r\nthe strongest arm was the most powerful machinery in the government of\r\nthe country, women were compelled naturally to occupy a less prominent\r\nposition in the conduct of the affairs of the nation; and for centuries\r\nthey have been degraded by a dominating tradition, and supposed\r\nincapable of performing duties for which they were mentally well suited.\r\nBut those militant days are past. Animal strength and brute force are no\r\nlonger needed in the councils of the nation; and the time has arrived\r\nwhen women should cease to be oppressed by the disparaging, illogical\r\ndeductions of former generations, and when their assistance ought to be\r\ninvoked in the great work of promoting the nation's welfare.\r\n\r\nI have stated that marriage is an important political factor; and,\r\ntherefore, women have always occupied a primary, though obscure, part in\r\npolitical affairs. The cohesion of the State has been produced by the\r\nsecret influence of family life. But it may be asked, What kind of\r\nmarriage is most conducive to national cohesion? This question has been\r\ncarefully and conclusively answered by a learned scientific writer, who\r\nshows that polygamic marriage never exists in an advanced state, as\r\ninstanced by the history of Judaism and Mohammedanism; that a strict\r\nform of monogamic marriage is essential to political greatness and true\r\nprogress in civilization. The cohesion of the State is destroyed by\r\npolygamy, and by any system which relaxes the binding nature of the\r\nmarriage tie. 'Domestic disorganization is a sure augury of political\r\ndisruption.'\r\n\r\nCohesion, the essential property of all rightly constituted nations, is\r\noften in danger of being lost when the State is geographically very\r\nlarge, or when local interests have greater power than the attractive\r\nforce of the central government. To obviate this evil, the method of\r\ncentralization has been adopted with satisfactory results, as in the\r\ncase of the United States of America, and Germany.\r\n\r\nBy this means the local authorities are brought into close relationship\r\nwith the central head, and the centrifugal influences of independent\r\ninterests and customs are counteracted by the force of central\r\nattraction. Centralization increases the importance of the whole body,\r\nand, like the pendulum of a clock, regulates the movements of the whole\r\nState. In some cases it tends to make the government despotic, when the\r\nlocal governments are entirely under the control of the central; and\r\nevery enactment, and scheme, and plan checked and supervised by the\r\nchief officers of the State. Such was the system adopted in France by\r\nNapoleon III. But cohesion without the enforcement of a hard and rigid\r\nconnection, a general supervision without severe tyrannical\r\njurisdiction, are the best methods of securing the unity of composite\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBut the force of cohesion is evidently at work in the nation apart from\r\ncentralization. Men who have a community of interests unite together\r\nfor the purposes of strength and mutual assistance. They combine for the\r\nsake of securing means of support in sickness, and form benefit\r\nsocieties, such as the Order of Oddfellows or Foresters. This force of\r\ncohesion has produced trade unions, and similar institutions which exist\r\nfor the purpose of protecting a common interest, and giving expression\r\nto the concurrent opinions of the members. These have their legitimate\r\nuse in every civilized State, in spite of some of the disadvantages\r\nwhich follow in their train. There are, of course, opposed interests in\r\nevery community: _attractive_ forces, which produce trade unions,\r\nguilds, corporations, companies, and the like; and _repulsive_ forces,\r\nwhich result from the opposed interests of employers and employed,\r\nlandlords and tenants, and similar pairs of different classes in the\r\ncommunity. As time goes on, and the State advances with it, these forces\r\nwill gain in strength; the cohesion of classes will become greater;\r\nassociation will grow as naturally as the bubbles form on the surface\r\nof our evening beverage. It is a law of nature, and therefore cannot be\r\nresisted. But the repulsive forces will be no less strong, and to\r\ncalculate the resultant of these contending interests will be the\r\nproblem for practical statesmen to solve.\r\n\r\nThe force of cohesion is also evidently at work, not only in individual\r\nStates, but also amongst the nations of Europe, and of the world. That\r\nis to say, there is an evident desire for co-operation on the part of\r\nthose nations who have attained to the highest degree of civilization\r\nand internal cohesion. International law is based on the principle of\r\ncohesion, and every day it is gaining power and favour in the eyes of\r\nour leading statesmen. The doctrine of Free Trade, which, if universally\r\nadopted, would be of the greatest service to mankind, results from a\r\ndesire for co-operation; and whatever evils may result from one-sided\r\nFree Trade in this country at the present time, there can be no doubt\r\nthat ultimately the complete system will be adopted.\r\n\r\nSad is the fate of a nation when the force of cohesion is weakened. The\r\nfirst revolution in France is a proof of this assertion; there was no\r\ncohesion, no common faith, or loyalty to the throne and Government; and\r\nindeed the Government, which was rotten to the core, was hardly likely\r\nto awake any feelings of loyalty and respect; and therefore the social\r\ndisruption which followed was only a natural sequence of events, and was\r\nprophesied with the accuracy with which an astronomer can foretell an\r\neclipse. But that is not all; when the cohesion of the State is\r\ndestroyed, it takes a long time to restore the action of the force; and,\r\nas in the case of France, further disruption is sure to take place.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture I have already enumerated some of the ways in which this\r\nforce acts; there are doubtless others which will suggest themselves to\r\nyou. But I contend that the prosperity of the State, and the peace of\r\nthe world, depend upon cohesion. Let this be your work, most noble\r\nprofessors, to promote the action of this helpful and life-giving\r\nforce. Promote, as far as in you lies, the sacred union of family life.\r\nEncourage the generous feelings of true loyalty and patriotism amongst\r\nthe people of this realm of England; counsel our statesmen with regard\r\nto the primary necessity of national cohesion, and the advantages of\r\ninternational co-operation; and your work will be blessed; your names\r\nwill rank with those heroes of the sword and of the pen who have raised\r\nour beloved country to her present pinnacle of greatness and prosperity;\r\nand your memory will live in the hearts of your grateful countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Editorial Note.]--We regret to state that the various MSS. in the\r\nsealed desk are nearly exhausted, and are therefore compelled to present\r\nthe series of lectures on polemical studies in an incomplete form. But\r\nwe had the good fortune to light upon a brief diary which discloses some\r\ninteresting information with regard to the Author's life and\r\noccupations. We append a few extracts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracts from the Author's Diary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 3rd_.--Arnold called again to-day--the fifth time during the last\r\nfortnight! His attention is rather overpowering, and wastes much of my\r\nvaluable time. He says he hates science--the heathen!--and wants me to\r\nlecture in classics. He affirms that mathematics are dry and hard--too\r\nhard for women, and tend to make them unsympathetic and critically\r\nsevere. I am afraid I was rather severe with him. But really he is very\r\ntrying, and always seems to talk like a Greek chorus in the most\r\nprofound platitudes. Arnold is a classical tutor at Clare College. My\r\nold pupil is getting on famously. Poor fellow! he seems quite oppressed\r\nwith his work. But he is making great progress, and sticks to his books\r\nlike--a student of Girtham College!\r\n\r\n_June 4th_.--Lectured on the Scientific Basis of Blackstone's\r\nCommentaries; afterwards received pupils until 1 p.m. Really Blanch\r\nS---- is more tiresome than ever. It appears that she has taken up with\r\na young undergraduate of King's, and there is no prospect of any\r\nimprovement in her work unless this nonsense is terminated. How foolish\r\nsome of my sex are, in spite of their improved opportunities! I blush\r\nfor them! Arnold has sent me a copy of Robert Browning's 'Belaustion,'\r\nin order to make me like classics, and give up science. Misguided young\r\nman! He has written some tolerable verses on the fly-leaf; but I have no\r\nintention of playing Belaustion to his 'entranced youth.' These are his\r\nverses:\r\n\r\n   'My lady dear, if I may call you so,\r\n    For you are dearer than all else beside,\r\n    I know the love you bear to golden verse,\r\n    To golden thoughts enshrined in classic lore,\r\n    To all that's beautiful; so here I send\r\n    Some echoes of the songs of ancient days,\r\n    Attuned and chanted by an English bard,\r\n    Who fires one's old love for the rolling lines\r\n    Of youthful Hellas; may your cultured ear\r\n    Receive, and gladly welcome his sweet song.\r\n    And while we revel in the poet's dream,\r\n    And hear his actors speak, we'll play our parts.\r\n    You, sweet Belaustion on the temple-steps,\r\n    Taking your captors captive by your voice;\r\n    And I, the youth who, more entranced than all,\r\n    Was bound by fetters that he would not loose;\r\n    And so we'll play our part. What say you, dear?'\r\n\r\n_June 6th_.--Have just seen our new Professor of Physics, Amelia\r\nCordial, who is an excellent woman, and well suited for the high office\r\nwhich she holds. She has told me of the foolish conduct of Lady Mary,\r\nwho is evidently of opinion that the professorial mantle ought to have\r\nfallen on her shoulders. Really, this jealousy in the ranks of the\r\nlearned is most disgraceful; and the bickerings which arise from\r\ndisappointed ambition, the envyings and silly quarrels, are the weak\r\nplaces in our female collegiate system.\r\n\r\nSuch good news! The wrangler list is just out, and my hard-working pupil\r\nis _bracketed twelfth!_ This is really delightful, and abundantly repays\r\nus for all our hard toil. But really I have not found working with him\r\ndistasteful; he is such an excellent pupil, so painstaking and eager,\r\nthat I have quite looked forward to his coming, and found him much more\r\ninteresting than some of these foolish maidens. But I almost dread\r\nseeing him. He will be so elated and overpoweringly grateful, whereas I\r\nought to be grateful to him for all his work for me; for I am sure he\r\nwould never have gone in for the Tripos if I had not persuaded him.\r\nWell, I wonder why he does not come to tell me of his triumph.\r\n\r\n_June 7th_.--_It_ has come! and I half expected it. My eager pupil\r\nwrites with all the energy and love of his noble nature to ask me to be\r\nhis wife! He says _that_ is all he cares for, and only values his\r\nHonours as a step to a higher honour and dignity, that of gaining my\r\nlove and being my husband. All this is very nice to read; but a terribly\r\ndifficult problem is placed before me for solution. I do indeed love\r\nthis dear, good fellow--no one could help doing so, I am sure; but do I\r\nnot love science more? There is a stringent regulation in this\r\nUniversity that no one shall occupy the position of professor who is\r\nbound by any domestic ties or cares. All married women are excluded. If\r\nI say 'Yes,' I must resign my high position, leave this beloved college,\r\ngive no more lectures to entranced audiences. In the interests of\r\nscience, ought I to refuse, and sacrifice my heart's affections for the\r\ncause of mathematics? But if I say 'No,' I must give up--_him_;\r\nsacrifice his happiness too, and blight his life. Was ever anyone so\r\nperplexed? Science, aid thine obedient servant! May I not determine this\r\nvital question by thine all-pervading light?...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Editorial Note.]--We had just arrived at this exciting moment in the\r\nlife of the learned and accomplished lady whose writings form the\r\nsubject of these pages--a moment when love and science were trembling in\r\nthe balance--when a footstep was heard upon the stairs leading to our\r\nstudy, and ere we could secrete our MS. the door was opened, and a\r\nwell-known voice exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'I do not know why you should have become so studious lately, Ernest,\r\nand why you should refuse to take me into your confidence. You spend\r\nhours and hours in this room all by yourself, writing away, and never\r\nsay a word to me about the subject of your literary work. There was a\r\ntime when things were different, and you were not so slow in availing\r\nyourself of my help, and asking my advice.'\r\n\r\nWe murmured something about taking up the pen which had been laid aside\r\nby a far abler hand, and our deep gratitude for past assistance in our\r\nwork, which could never be forgotten.\r\n\r\n'And do you think that I cannot help you now?' our visitor replied, in a\r\nvery injured tone of voice. 'Is the old power dead, because it has not\r\nrecently been used? Ernest, I think you very ungrateful not to confide\r\nin me. Come, tell me what you are writing.'\r\n\r\nA suggestion about the proverbial curiosity of women rose to our lips,\r\nbut died away without utterance. In the meantime, her eyes wandered over\r\nour study-table strewed with papers, and lighted upon the well-worn\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n'Why, Ernest, where did you find this? My dear old desk, which has been\r\nlost ever so long! I do believe you have been ransacking its contents!\r\nWhy did you not tell me that you had found it? What are you doing with\r\nmy papers, sir?'\r\n\r\nThe mischief was out! We tried to explain that the world ought not to be\r\ndeprived of that which would benefit mankind; that the peace and\r\nprosperity of the country might be sacrificed if it were deprived of\r\nthese discoveries of science, which were calculated to secure such\r\nbeneficial results.\r\n\r\nAt length we gained our point, and obtained the full sanction of the\r\nlate Lady Professor of Girtham College to publish her papers. Thus her\r\nobedient pupil is enabled to repay his late instructress for all her\r\nkindness to him, and in some measure to compensate the scientific and\r\npolitical world for the loss of one of its most original investigators\r\nin the regions of polemical studies, which, not without a struggle, she\r\nresigned when she deigned to become his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elliot Stock, Paternoster Row, London._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Romance of Mathematics, by P.
