Lock in his introduction to _The Man of Taste_ (ARS\r\n171). For our present purposes, we need only add that Bramston seems to\r\nhave been acquainted with Pope, who saw _The Art of Politicks_ before\r\nit was printed and thought it \"pretty\".[A] Bramston quite likely met\r\nPope through John Caryll, whose Sussex estate, Lady-Holt, was in the\r\nneighborhood of Bramston's parishes.\r\n\r\n_The Art of Politicks_, Bramston's first English poem, was published\r\nanonymously in 1729 and advertised in the Monthly Chronicle of 8\r\nDecember. Several reimpressions followed, as did another London\r\nedition, one from Edinburgh, and two from Dublin, all dated 1729, and a\r\nLondon edition of 1731.[B] It was reprinted in Robert Dodsley's\r\n_Collection of Poems, by Several Hands_ (1748), where it was attributed\r\nto Bramston, and in John Bell's _Classical Arrangement of Fugitive\r\nPoetry_, Volume 5 (1789), with a few notes.[C] Horace Walpole's copy of\r\nDodsley's _Collection_, with a few rather uninformative manuscript\r\nnotes, is now in the British Library (C.117.aa.16).\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the poem was completed in the summer of 1729. The\r\nmost recent events that Bramston alludes to are Thomas Woolston's trial\r\nfor blasphemy of 4 March (p. 27) and Sir Paul Methuen's resignation as\r\nTreasurer of the King's Household, which was reported in May (p.\r\n13).[D]\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHorace's _Ars Poetica_ was one of the most fertile sources for\r\neighteenth-century imitations and adaptations. Some were completely\r\nserious attempts to marry one art to another or to show that all arts\r\nshare the same fundamental principles; an example of this type is John\r\nGwynn's _Art of Architecture_ (1742; ARS 144). Others, like William\r\nKing's _Art of Cookery_ (1708) are downright burlesques.\r\n\r\nBramston's usual method falls somewhere between these extremes. He\r\noften uses the dignity of poetry to show up the indignity of politics\r\nor political writing, as on pp. 5-6 where Horace's advice on choice of\r\nsubject is transformed into advice to \"_Weekly Writers_ of seditious\r\n_News_,\" or on page 7, where the rise and fall of South Sea stock fills\r\nthe place of Horace's famous comparison of archaic and new-coined words\r\nto the leaves of the forest. But Bramston's poem more often aspires to\r\nthe same level as its model; in this respect it resembles _Absalom and\r\nAchitophel_ more than _Mac Flecknoe_.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors help to bring _Ars Poetica_ and _The Art of Politicks_\r\ntogether. Perhaps most important, Bramston conceives of politics\r\nprimarily as a verbal art, the use of speech to persuade others to a\r\ncourse of action. Bribes and other crasser incentives appear in the\r\npoem, of course, but they are clearly the result of declining\r\nstandards. For Bramston, rhetoric should govern politics; the House of\r\nCommons is a reincarnation of a Roman senate or courtroom. Bramston's\r\ninclusion of political writing as well as politics itself in his poem\r\nalso helps to keep him in Horace's orbit. On Horace's side, his\r\nconception of poetry is basically rhetorical and persuasive; it should\r\ninstruct and delight, move to laughter or tears. Horace's readiness to\r\ndigress into literary history gives Bramston many opportunities to\r\nbring in political history. The _Ars Poetica_ is very much concerned\r\nwith the world of men; poets are seen in their social roles, and\r\nHorace's standards of literary decorum are usually based on social\r\nnorms: young men in plays should behave the way young men are observed\r\nto behave in real life. The _Ars Poetica_ also contains several sharp\r\nsatiric darts; Horace's contrast between the eloquence of ancient\r\nGreece and the commercial arithmetic of modern Rome slides easily into\r\na contrast between Elizabethan learning and Hanoverian place-hunting\r\n(pp.32-33). Finally, Horace's urbane and chatty style is as suitable\r\nfor other subjects as it is for poetry. To appreciate Horace's\r\nadaptability, one need only imagine the difficulty of writing an art of\r\npolitics in imitation of Archibald MacLeish's \"Ars Poetica\" or\r\nAristotle's _Poetics_.\r\n\r\nThough he does not pretend to Pope's image of himself as a new Horace\r\nbringing the whole weight of Roman tradition to bear on contemporary\r\nsociety, Bramston is very clever on the local level at transposing\r\nHorace for his own purposes. Horace recounts the increasing complexity\r\nand sophistication of theatrical music, Bramston the increasingly\r\nelaborated musical celebrations of victorious candidates (pp. 22-23),\r\nand Horace's implication that the sophistication of taste is really a\r\ndecline--\"an impetuous style brought in an unwonted diction\"\r\n(217)--constitutes an unspoken comment on Bramston's subject.[E]\r\nBramston's page 27 corresponds to Horace's brief history of the\r\ntheatre, from Thespis's tragedies that he staged on wagons to the\r\nsilencing of the excessively outspoken chorus of Old Comedy (275-84).\r\nBramston replaces Thespis with Defoe, and the wagon-mounted stage with\r\nthe cart and pillory. Instead of deploring the silencing of the chorus,\r\nBramston applauds the silencing of Woolston. The contrast between\r\nThespis and Defoe is clearly mock-heroic, but Bramston implies that\r\nWoolston's similarity to an ancient satyr is a decline from the\r\ncharacter expected of a modern clergyman.\r\n\r\nSometimes the mere fact of changing from a poetic to a political\r\ncontext produces the satire or humour. What is praiseworthy in a\r\npoet--the ability to mingle fact and fiction skillfully (151)--becomes\r\nhighly ironic when applied to a politician who\r\n\r\n   In Falsehood Probability imploys,\r\n   Nor his old Lies with newer Lies destroys. (p. 16)\r\n\r\nHorace's \"ut pictura poesis\" (361) produces this bland but destructive\r\ncouplet:\r\n\r\n   Not unlike Paintings, Principles appear,\r\n   Some best at distance, some when we are near. (p. 36)\r\n\r\nMore humourous than satirical is the relation between Horace's\r\ndeclaration that there's no place for a mediocre poet (372-73) and\r\nBramston's\r\n\r\n   The Middle way the best we sometimes call.\r\n   But 'tis in Politicks no way at all.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   There is no Medium: for the term in vogue\r\n   On either side is, Honest Man, or Rogue. (pp. 37-38)\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the poem involves a somewhat more complex\r\ntransformation. Horace closes with a humourously self-deprecating\r\ndescription of the \"poetic itch\": the afflicted poet stumbles into\r\nditches as he babbles his verses aloud; people flee from him, and with\r\ngood reason; if he catches anyone, he hangs on like a leech and reads\r\nhis victim to death. Bramston describes another \"sort of itch,\"\r\nparliamenteering. Sir Harry Clodpole knows better than to make speeches\r\nto the electors; he solicits their votes by feasting them, and they run\r\n_towards_ him (or his table), not away. They, not he, are the leeches;\r\n\"they never leave him while he's worth a groat\" (p. 45).\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBramston--it seems an excessive refinement to speak of a persona or\r\nnarrator--presents himself as a rather simple, naive political observer\r\nwho yearns for clear-cut distinctions between parties; he wants to know\r\nwhere politicians stand on issues. The confusion, the blurring of old\r\nparty lines, in present-day England is like the monster in the\r\nfrontispiece. Though simple, he is also well informed. He seems to have\r\na good knowledge of British history since the Restoration, referring\r\ncasually to the Exclusion Crisis of 1680-81 (p. 15), the Kentish\r\nPetition of 1701 (p. 10), and the South Sea Bubble of 1720 (p. 7). All\r\nthese past events are used to reinforce present lessons. He is\r\nup-to-date, as shown by his reference to the recent events in the\r\ncareers of Methuen and Woolston. He professes familiarity with the\r\ncharacters of the leading politicians and also knows something about\r\nwhat is going on in the constituencies. He knows, or claims to know,\r\nhow different kinds of listeners will react to different kinds of\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\nFor a son of Christ Church, one of the most Tory Colleges of Tory\r\nOxford, he seems remarkably non-partisan, though his Opposition biases\r\ndo show through. When he says that \"Addison's immortal Page\" shows us\r\nhow \"to screen good Ministers from Publick rage\" (p. 9), he is clearly\r\naiming at Walpole, known as the \"Screenmaster General\" since his\r\nsuccess in shielding many of the perpetrators of the South Sea Bubble\r\nin 1720. (I have not been able to discover the passage of Addison that\r\nBramston had in mind.) When the aspiring orator is urged not to \"join\r\nwith silver Tongue a brazen Face\" (p. 24), Walpole is again present by\r\ninnuendo, for \"brazen-face\" was another of his nicknames. On the other\r\nhand, Bramston also makes fun of the \"everlasting Fame\" that results\r\nfrom quibbling on Sir Robert's name (p. 6). Bramston perhaps has it\r\nboth ways here; while ridiculing commonplace puns, he also invites us\r\nto remember that \"Robin\" does indeed sound very much like \"robbing.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes he is more subtle and ironic. This subtlety caused difficulty\r\nfor at least one contemporary reader, and may do the same for us.\r\nConsider the following passage, which parallels Horace's advice always\r\nto show Achilles wrathful, Orestes mourning, and the like:\r\n\r\n     To _Likelihood_ your _Characters_ confine;\r\n   Don't turn _Sir Paul_ out, let _Sir Paul_ resign.\r\n   In _Walpole_'s Voice (if Factions Ill intend)\r\n   Give the two _Universities_ a Friend;\r\n   Give _Maidston_ Wit, and Elegance refin'd;\r\n   To both the _Pelhams_ give the _Scipios_ Mind;\r\n   To _Cart'ret_, Learning, Eloquence, and Parts;\r\n   To _George_ the _Second_, give all _English_ Hearts. (p. 13)\r\n\r\nOne of Bramston's early readers found his poem very faulty, and many of\r\nhis complaints were directed against the passage just quoted.\r\n\r\n   Such artless art did ever mortal see,\r\n   Or politicks so void of policy?\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   What bard but this could Pelham's train compare\r\n   To Roman Scipio's thunder-bolts of war?\r\n   Did e'er their wars enrich their native isle,\r\n   With foreign treasures and with Spanish spoil?\r\n   But hark! and stare with all your ears and eyes!\r\n   Walpole is friend to Universities!\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Hail politician bard! we ask not whether\r\n   A whig or tory; thou art both and neither.\r\n   Poultney and Walpole each adorn thy lays,\r\n   Which one for love, and one for money praise.\r\n   Alike are mention'd, equally are sung\r\n   Will. Shippen staunch, and slight Sir Wm. Young.\r\n   Bromley and Wyndham share the motley strain,\r\n   With Cart'ret, Maidstone, and the Pelhams twain.[F]\r\n\r\nThis critic finds two main faults in the poem: misinformation and\r\nconfusion about particular individuals and, more generally, an\r\ninability to distinguish Whigs from Tories and give each their due.\r\nThis last complaint of course mocks Bramston's lament at the beginning\r\nof the poem about the current lack of distinction between parties.\r\n\r\nTo what extent is this critique justified? What is Bramston trying to\r\ndo in this passage? There is no problem with the second line: Sir Paul\r\nMethuen did indeed resign his office, and one gets the impression from\r\nHervey (pp. 101-2, 250) that he never let anyone forget that he\r\nresigned. Thus we have here the most conventional of truisms. Walpole\r\nis more difficult. He was certainly no friend of the universities,\r\nwhich were Tory hotbeds. On the other hand, he was reluctant to try to\r\nreduce their privileges or bring them more closely under government\r\ncontrol, for fear of rousing them to keener opposition. Nowhere else\r\ndid he follow so faithfully his policy of letting sleeping dogs lie.[G]\r\nIn a certain sense, then, he might be called a friend of the\r\nuniversities. I have been unable to determine whom Bramston means by\r\n\"Maidston\"--perhaps one of the Finches, the most prominent family in\r\nthe area of Maidstone, Kent. Bramston's critic is certainly right about\r\nthe Pelhams: they have nothing whatever in common with the Scipios.\r\nScipio Africanus Major (236-184/3) was one of the most illustrious\r\nRoman heroes, consul during the Second Punic War and an outstanding\r\nmilitary tactician. Scipio Africanus Minor (c. 185-129) was not only a\r\nconsul and a military hero but a great patron of letters whom Cicero\r\nconsidered the greatest Roman of them all.[H] Thomas Pelham-Holles,\r\nDuke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1693-1768), Walpole's chief election\r\nmanager, was notoriously muddle-headed, nervous, embarrassed, swamped\r\nin petty detail, suspicious, fretful, pompous, and indecisive.[I] His\r\nbrother, Henry Pelham (1695?-1754), was much less well known; reserved\r\nand withdrawn, he preferred to work in the background, and his tactical\r\nand organizational abilities were not recognized until considerably\r\nlater.[J] As far as their public image was concerned, then, no two men\r\ncould be less like the Scipios. Most contemporaries agreed with\r\nBramston's praise of John Carteret, Earl Granville (1690-1763), though\r\nmany of them also mention other, less admirable traits.[K] As for\r\nGeorge II, it depends on whose hearts you consult. An anonymous\r\njournalist:\r\n\r\n    What an Assurance has the Kingdom already given of an\r\n    unfeigned Affection to their Majesties Persons and\r\n    Government? How do the People shew that none are acceptable\r\n    to them, but those that are so to their Majesties? How can\r\n    Subjects give stronger Proofs of the high Esteem they have\r\n    their Sovereign in, for Penetration and Wisdom, than those\r\n    who entirely rely upon the Royal Discerning, and regulate\r\n    their Conduct by the King's Direction?[L]\r\n\r\nWilliam Pultney:\r\n\r\n    The Queen is hated, the King despised, their son both the\r\n    one and the other, and such a spirit of disaffection to the\r\n    family and general discontent with the present Government is\r\n    spread all over the Kingdom, that it is absolutely\r\n    impossible for things to go on in the track they are now\r\n    in.[M]\r\n\r\nBy now Bramston's method should be clear: he is praising everyone, but\r\nthe praise fits the Opposition (such as Carteret) much better than it\r\ndoes the Government (the Pelhams). There is perhaps room for doubt\r\nabout Walpole and George II, but Bramston's critic's failure to see the\r\nirony in the comparison of Pelhams to Scipios must be the result of\r\nsheer obtuseness. The rationale for Bramston's technique becomes\r\nclearer if we look again at Horace and recall that the basis of his\r\nadvice is to follow conventional opinion. The conventional opinions\r\nthat Bramston is by implication urging his pupil to follow are those of\r\nthe politician's supporters and dependents. It just happens that\r\nBramston has chosen his examples so that the Opposition conventions are\r\ncloser to reality than the Government conventions.[N]\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll this is fun, but it is quite inoffensive. There's no animus, no\r\nvehemence, no bite. Politics do not really engage any of Bramston's\r\nstrong convictions. The self-portrait he offers us on pages 29-30 would\r\nbe for many political satirists of the period a transparent facade of\r\nmock-innocence, but it seems to fit Bramston very accurately:\r\n\r\n   Alas Poor Me, you may my fortune guess:\r\n   I write, and yet Humanity profess:\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   I love the King, the Queen, and Royal Race:\r\n   I like the Government, but want no Place:\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Was never in a Plot, my Brain's not hurt;\r\n   I Politicks to Poetry convert.\r\n\r\nBy contrast to the increasing acrimony of most political satire of the\r\nlate 1720's, this attitude is at least refreshing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO _THE ART OF POLITICKS_\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the topical nature of _The Art of Politicks_, the best use of my\r\nremaining space is probably to annotate the poem. From what I have\r\nlearned about its background--and many mysteries remain--I have tried\r\nto choose what seems most relevant. In the interests of saving space,\r\nand since full annotation is not possible anyway, I have kept\r\ndocumentation to a minimum, especially where the information comes from\r\neasily available sources like the DNB or, conversely, has been pieced\r\ntogether from several sources. Some works are occasionally referred to\r\nby abbreviation or author's name; the ones not mentioned in the Notes\r\nto the Introduction are the following:[O]\r\n\r\nCobbett: William Cobbett, _The Parliamentary History of England from\r\nthe Earliest Period to the Year 1803_ (London: T. C. Hansard, 1806-20).\r\n\r\nEllis: Jonathan Swift, _A Discourse of the Contests and Dissentions\r\nbetween the Nobles and Commons in Athens and Rome_, ed. Frank H. Ellis\r\n(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967).\r\n\r\nGrey: Anchitel Grey, _Debates of the House of Commons from the Year\r\n1667 to the Year 1694_ (London, 1763).\r\n\r\nThomas: Peter D. G. Thomas, _The House of Commons in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury_ (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971).\r\n\r\nRealey: Charles B. Realey, _The Early Opposition to Sir Robert Walpole\r\n1720-1727_ (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1931).\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 1, line 1. Sir James: Sir James Thornhill (c. 1675-1734). As MP for\r\nWeymouth and Melcombe Regis (1722-34) and Serjeant Painter to the King\r\n(1720-32), he embodies the parallel between art and politics that\r\nunderlies Bramston's poem. His best-known works were the dome of St.\r\nPaul's and the paintings in Greenwich Hospital. Hogarth married his\r\ndaughter in 1729.\r\n\r\nP. 2, line 4. Cf. Hervey's comment on Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London,\r\nwho \"affected to conciliate in himself both characters of Whig and\r\nTory, declaring himself always a Whig in the State and a Tory in the\r\nChurch\" (pp. 90-91). Gibson's attitude can be traced back at least as\r\nfar as Swift's _Sentiments of a Church of England Man_ (1711).\r\n\r\n      line 11. Patriots: the self-awarded designation of the major\r\n group of Walpole's opponents.\r\n\r\nP. 3, line 6. Parliament devoted considerable time to fixing turnpike\r\ntolls.\r\n\r\nFleury: André Hercule de (1653-1743). Created a cardinal in 1726, he\r\nwas chief adviser to Louis XV of France from that date till his death,\r\nand therefore a person of great interest to England. His guiding\r\nprinciple was to keep France at peace with the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nP. 4, lines 2-3. \"Tory\" originally meant an Irish outlaw, and \"Whig\" a\r\nScottish rebel. For other theories of the origin of \"Whig\" that were\r\ncurrent in 1729, see OED.\r\n\r\n      line 12. Repetition Day: a day on which schoolboys recite\r\n memorized lessons.\r\n\r\nP. 5, line 7. The human face in Bramston's frontispiece has been said\r\nto resemble Heidegger, but it does not seem to match his reputation for\r\nextreme ugliness. See _TE_, 5, 92, 290, 443-44.\r\n\r\nP. 6, lines 3-4. Ridpath: George Ridpath (d. 1726), Whig journalist.\r\nAbel Roper (1665-1726), publisher of the _Tory Post Boy_.\r\n\r\nP. 7, line 10. Pinkethman: William Pinkethman (or Penkethman) (d.\r\n1725), a comic actor said to have once eaten three chickens in two\r\nseconds. See TE, 4, 220, 377.\r\n\r\n      line 12. Maypole: This remarkable barometer of intellectual\r\nhistory was razed by the Puritan parliament in 1644. A new one, 134\r\nfeet tall, was set up at the Restoration; it, or a successor, had\r\ndecayed to a height of twenty feet in 1717 when Sir Isaac Newton\r\nacquired it and presented it to James Pound to use as a telescope\r\nmount.\r\n\r\nP. 8, line 2. Newer Square: Cavendish Square, according to Horace\r\nWalpole's annotation.\r\n\r\n      line 6. The bridge at Putney Ferry was completed in 1729.\r\n\r\nP. 9, lines 4-5. Thomas Tickell's poetical _Epistle from a Lady in\r\nEngland to a Gentleman at Avignon_ went through five editions in 1717.\r\n\r\n      lines 6-7. \"Caleb D'Anvers\" was the pseudonym under which\r\nappeared _The Craftsman_, the opposition journal directed by\r\nBolingbroke and Pultney. Bramston's expression of ignorance must\r\nbe ironic.\r\n\r\nP. 10, lines 1-2. Arthur Onslow, who became Speaker in 1728, insisted\r\nthat all members bow to the Speaker's Chair when entering or leaving\r\nthe House (Thomas, p. 356).\r\n\r\n      line 12. The \"Kentish Petition\" was presented to the\r\nTory-controlled Parliament on 8 May 1701 by five gentlemen of Kent.\r\nIt urged Parliament to grant speedily to King William the subsidies\r\nthat would enable him to pursue his European wars against Louis XIV.\r\nParliament did not consider its words soft; it voted the petition\r\nseditious, scandalous, and insolent, and arrested the five gentlemen,\r\nwho thereupon became popular heroes, at least among the Whigs. See\r\nDefoe's _History of the Kentish Petition_ (1701) and Ellis,\r\npp. 53-56, 65-66.\r\n\r\nP. 11, lines 3-8. Pultney: William Pultney (1684-1764), later Earl of\r\nBath. The leader of the \"Patriot\" opposition to Walpole in the House of\r\nCommons. Hervey reluctantly concedes that his abilities were\r\noutstanding (pp. 790-91).\r\n\r\nP. 12, line 4. the Rod: that is, the rod of the Serjeant-at-Arms, the\r\nofficer responsible for keeping order in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n      line 6. the Bar: The Bar marked the outer limit of the House,\r\nand, as the lines imply, was where offenders stood to be reprimanded.\r\n\r\n      lines 11-12. The \"one cause\" is presumably Walpole's patronage.\r\nThe Cornish constituencies were notoriously corrupt even by\r\neighteenth-century standards, and Walpole cultivated the Scots\r\nassiduously. A Scottish \"laird\" is a landowner, not a \"lord\" in the\r\nEnglish sense.\r\n\r\nP. 13, line 12. Flying-Squadron: apparently a group which claimed to\r\nvote by principle rather than from attachment to any party. Sir Joseph\r\nJekyll was considered its leader. See Sedgwick, _House of Commons_, 2,\r\n175; Realey, p. 54; and OED, \"Squadron 7,\" \"Squadrone b.,\" and\r\n\"Squadronist.\"\r\n\r\nP. 15, lines 2ff. The famous speech of Colonel Silius Titus (7 Jan.\r\n1681) was widely reported in two slightly different versions; see Grey,\r\n8, 279 and Cobbett, 4, 1291. In both these versions the question is\r\nwhether to keep the lion out or to let him in and chain him. Bramston\r\nmay have been following an independent tradition or merely exercising\r\npoetic license. The lion is, of course, James, Duke of York, the Roman\r\nCatholic heir to the throne.\r\n\r\nLane: Sir Richard Lane (c. 1667-1756), MP for Worcester 1727-34. He was\r\na merchant, sugar baker, and salt trader, and a consistent supporter of\r\nthe administration. For examples of his indecorous use of biblical\r\nallusions see Sedgwick, 2, 197-98 (the \"bantering speech\" mentioned\r\nthere used the Book of Revelation to prove that merchants were the best\r\npeople on earth); and Knatchbull, p. 137.\r\n\r\nP. 16, line 5. Rufus: King William II, son of William the Conqueror,\r\nknown as William Rufus, was often evoked as an example of tyranny, as\r\nin Pope's _Windsor-Forest_.\r\n\r\nP. 17, lines 9-10. Prince William: younger son of George II, eight\r\nyears old in 1729; Louisa: youngest daughter of King George, then five.\r\n\r\nP. 18, line 4. William Shippen (1673-1743) was an extreme Tory, noted\r\nfor his outspoken attacks on the Walpole ministry, one of which landed\r\nhim in the Tower. Sir William Yonge (c. 1693-1755) was notorious, at\r\nleast among the opposition, for voluble but empty speeches in support\r\nof Walpole, \"melodious nothings\" as one satirist put it. See also\r\nHervey, p. 36, and TE, 4, 394. The attack on _The Art of Politicks_\r\nquoted above complains that Shippen and Yonge should be mentioned in\r\nthe same breath, but Bramston's point obviously is that the young MP\r\ncares nothing for either side.\r\n\r\nP. 20, line 8. Polly Peachum is of course the heroine of Gay's\r\n_Beggar's Opera_. The role was played by Lavinia Fenton, who\r\nimmediately became the toast of London. \"Old Sir John\" may be Sir John\r\nHobart (1693-1756), although he was only fifteen years older than Miss\r\nFenton (see Sedgwick, 2, 142). His name was sometimes spelled\r\n\"Hubbard,\" and the following stanza appears in \"A New Ballad Inscrib'd\r\nto Polly Peachum\" (British Library C-116.i.4 #38), the cavalier\r\ntypography of which perhaps indicates hasty composition:\r\n\r\n       Then came Sir J---- H----\r\n       Thundring at thy Cubboard:\r\n   But you cast them like a Lubboard\r\n   And did soon dispatch him.\r\n\r\nWhoever he was, Sir John lost out to Charles Paulet, third Duke of\r\nBolton, who kept Miss Fenton faithfully as his mistress, had three\r\nchildren by her, and married her on the death of his wife in 1751.\r\n\r\nP. 21, line 10. The House of Commons had used St. Stephen's Chapel as\r\nits meeting place since the mid-sixteenth century. Dover-Court is \"a\r\nproverbial term for a company, in which all are speakers and none\r\nhearers\" (Bell).\r\n\r\nP. 23, line 2. Waits: \"a small body of wind instrumentalists maintained\r\nby a city or town at the public charge\" (OED).\r\n\r\n       line 10. To sell bargains is to return indecent answers to\r\ncivil questions.\r\n\r\nP. 24, line 6. Mother Needham was a prominent bawd, notorious for her\r\nfoul language. See TE, 4, 374-75, and 5, 293-94.\r\n\r\n       lines 7-8. \"Oldfieldismus\" and \"Kibberismus\" refer respectively\r\nto the styles of Anne Oldfield, a well-known actress, and Colley Cibber,\r\nplaywright, stage manager, and hero of the _Dunciad_. Mrs. Oldfield was\r\ngenerally respected, but Pope, like Bramston, seems to have disliked\r\nher (TE, 4, 375).\r\n\r\n       line 11. Tallboy was a booby young lover in Richard Brome's\r\ncomedy _The Jovial Crew_ (1641), popular throughout the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nP. 26, line 12. Mist: Nathaniel Mist, Tory journalist. See TE, 5, 448.\r\nEusden: Laurence Eusden, Poet Laureate 1718-30, often ridiculed by\r\nPope.\r\n\r\n       line 14. Cibber's opera is _Love in a Riddle_ (1729), designed\r\nto capitalize on the craze for ballad opera created by _The Beggar's\r\nOpera_.\r\n\r\nP. 27, line 5. Censor: Sir Richard Steele as Isaac Bickerstaffe, the\r\nnominal author of _The Tatler_.\r\n\r\nP. 29, line 6. Where Edmund Curll stood was in the pillory.\r\n\r\nP. 31, line 3. Hugo Grotius's classic of political science, _De jure\r\nbelli ac pacis_, was published in 1625 and translated in 1654.\r\n\r\nP. 32, line 1. Wickfort: Abraham de Wicquefort, _l'Ambassadeur et ses\r\nfonctions_ (La Haye, 1680). It was summarized in _The Craftsman_ of 23\r\nSept. 1727.\r\n\r\n       line 4. John Banks was the author of _The Unhappy Favourite; or\r\nthe Earl of Essex_ (1681) and of _The Island Queens, or the Death of\r\nMary, Queen of Scotland_ (prohibited in 1684; a revision was produced\r\nin 1704). Bell says that although \"written in the most contemptible\r\nlanguage, yet they never fail to melt the audience into tears, merely\r\nby the force of judicious and well-arranged plots and incidents.\"\r\n\r\nP. 33, line 1. Arch-Bishop: William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nsince 1716. He was 72 in 1729. Master of the Rolls: Sir Joseph Jekyll,\r\nwho had held the office since 1717, was about 66 in 1729.\r\n\r\n       line 12. Spence: Thomas Spence (d. 1737), Serjeant-at-Arms.\r\n\r\nP. 34, line 3. Toft: In 1726 one Mary Toft claimed to have given birth\r\nto seventeen live rabbits, and some who should have known better\r\nbelieved her. See Pope's poem on her, _TE_, 6, 259, and Hogarth's\r\nengraving.\r\n\r\nthrows: i.e., throes, labor pains.\r\n\r\n       line 8: Bromley and Hanmer: William Bromley (?1663-1732),\r\nMP for Oxford 1701-32, Speaker 1710-13; Sir Thomas Hanmer (1677-1746),\r\nwho represented several constituencies from 1701-27 and was Speaker\r\n1714-15. They were Tory heroes, at least to Atterbury, for having\r\nrefused the places offered them by George I in 1715 (Foord, p. 51).\r\n\r\nP. 35, line 1. Tonson: Jacob Tonson, prominent bookseller.\r\n\r\n       line 9. Cler. Dom. Com.: \"Clerk of the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\nP. 36, line 2. Die Martis is Tuesday; Thursday is Die Jovis.\r\n\r\nline 6. Wyndham: Sir William Wyndham, MP for Somerset 1710-40,\r\nprominent opposition leader from the 1720s. See Sedgwick, 2, 562-64,\r\nfor his reputation. Hervey believed that his high reputation was partly\r\ndue to Walpole's henchmen, who inflated it in order to deflate\r\nPultney's (p. 21).\r\n\r\nP. 44, line 4. Sir Robert Fagg was better known for horse-racing and\r\nwenching than for politics; he appears in Hogarth's painting of _The\r\nBeggar's Opera_ admiring Lavinia Fenton and in the ballad cited in my\r\nnote to p. 20, line 8. Running for Parliament in the borough of\r\nSteyning, Sussex, in 1722, he came in third in a five-man race with\r\nnineteen votes. He also ran third in 1727; the vote is not recorded,\r\nunless Bramston's \"two Voices\" is to be taken literally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversité de Montréal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] Letter to John Caryll, 6 Feb. 1731. _Correspondence_, ed.

He never succeeded in paying his fine of £100\r\n(Pope, _Poems_ (Twickenham Edition, genl. ed. John Butt; London:\r\nMethuen, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1939-69), 5, 459). Hereafter\r\nreferred to as _TE_.\r\n\r\nMethuen's resignation is erroneously dated in 1730 in _DNB_ and in\r\nRomney Sedgwick, _The House of Commons 1715-1754_ (New York: Oxford\r\nUniversity Press, 1970), 2, 254.

Romney\r\nSedgwick (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1931), pp. 101-02.

a Human Face Sir _James_ should draw\r\n    A Gelding's Mane, and Feathers of Maccaw,\r\n    A Lady's Bosom, and a Tail of Cod,\r\n    Who could help laughing at a Sight so odd?\r\n    Just such a Monster, Sirs, pray think before ye,\r\n    When you behold one Man both _Whig_ and _Tory_.\r\n    Not more extravagant are Drunkard's Dreams,\r\n    Than _Low-Church_ Politicks with _High-Church_ Schemes.\r\n      Painters, you'll say, may their own Fancies use,\r\n    And Freeborn _Britons_ may their _Party_ chuse;\r\n    That's true, I own: but can one Piece be drawn\r\n    For Dove and Dragon, Elephant and Fawn?\r\n\r\n    [2] Speakers profess'd, who Gravity pretend,)\r\n    With motley Sentiments their Speeches blend:)\r\n    Begin like Patriots, and like Courtiers end.)\r\n

against importing _Irish Cattle_.\r\n    But you, from what e'er Side you take your Name,\r\n    Like _Anna_'s _Motto_, always be the same.\r\n\r\n    [3] Outsides deceive, 'tis hard the Truth to

the _Strand_?\r\n    Pease, Cabbages, and Turnips once grew, where\r\n    Now stands new _Bond-street_, and a newer Square;\r\n    Such Piles of Buildings now rise up and down;\r\n    London itself

  Can there be any trusting to our Words.\r\n\r\n    [6] To screen good Ministers from Publick rage,)\r\n    And how with Party Madness to engage,)\r\n    We learn from _Addison_'s immortal Page.)\r\n    The _Jacobite_'s ridiculous Opinion\r\n    Is seen from _Tickel_'s Letter to _Avignon_.\r\n    But who puts _Caleb_'s _Country-Craftsman_ out,\r\n    Is still a secret, and the World's in doubt.\r\n\r\n    [7] Not long since _Parish-Clerks_, with saucy airs,\r\n    Apply'd _King David_'s _Psalms_ to _State-Affairs_.\r\n    Some certain _Tunes_ to Politicks belong,\r\n    On both Sides Drunkards love a Party-Song.\r\n\r\n    [8] If full a-cross the Speaker's Chair I go,\r\n    Can I be said the _Rules_ o'th' _House_ to know?\r\n    I'll ask, nor give offence without intent,\r\n    Nor through meer Sheepishness be impudent.\r\n\r\n    [9] In _Acts of Parliament_ avoid Sublime,\r\n    Nor e'er Address his Majesty in Rhime;\r\n    An _Act of Parliament_'s a serious thing,\r\n    Begins with Year of Lord and Year of King;\r\n    Keeps close to Form, in every word is strict,\r\n    When it would _Pains_ and _Penalties_ inflict.\r\n    Soft Words suit best _Petitioners_ intent;\r\n    Soft Words, O ye _Petitioners_ of Kent!\r\n\r\n    [10] Who e'er harangues before he gives his Vote,\r\n    Should send sweet Language from a tuneful Throat.\r\n    _Pultney_ the coldest Breast with Zeal can fire,\r\n    And _Roman Thoughts_ by _Attick Stile_ inspire;\r\n    He knows from tedious Wranglings to beguile\r\n    The serious _House_ into a chearful Smile;\r\n    When the great Patriot paints his anxious Fears\r\n    For _England_'s Safety, I am lost in Tears.\r\n    But when dull Speakers strive to move compassion,\r\n    I pity their poor Hearers, not the Nation:\r\n    Unless young _Members_ to the purpose speak,\r\n    I fall a laughing, or I fall asleep.\r\n\r\n    [11] Can Men their inward Faculties controul?\r\n    Is not the Tongue an Index to the Soul?\r\n    Laugh not in time of _Service_ to your God,\r\n    Nor bully, when in _Custody_ o'th' _Rod_;\r\n    Look Grave, and be from Jokes and Grinning far,\r\n    When brought to sue for Pardon at the _Bar_.\r\n    If then you let your ill-tim'd Wit appear,\r\n    Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses will sneer.\r\n\r\n    [12] For Land, or Trade, not the same Notions sire\r\n    The _City-Merchant_, and the _Country-Squire_;\r\n    Their Climes are distant, tho' one Cause unites\r\n    The _Lairds_ of _Scotland_, and the _Cornish Knights_.\r\n\r\n    [13] To _Likelihood_ your _Characters_ confine;\r\n    Don't turn _Sir Paul_ out, let _Sir Paul_ resign.\r\n    In _Walpole_'s Voice (if Factions Ill intend)\r\n    Give the Two _Universities_ a Friend;\r\n    Give _Maidston_ Wit, and Elegance refin'd;\r\n    To both the _Pelhams_ give the _Scipios_ Mind;\r\n    To _Cart'ret_, Learning, Eloquence, and Parts;\r\n    To _George_ the _Second_, give all _English_ Hearts.\r\n\r\n    [14] Sometimes fresh Names in Politicks produce,\r\n    And Factions yet unheard of introduce;\r\n    And if you dare attempt a thing so new,\r\n    Make to itself the _Flying-Squadron_ true.\r\n\r\n    [15] To speak is free, no _Member_ is debarr'd:\r\n    But _Funds_ and _National Accounts_ are hard:\r\n    Safer on common Topicks to discourse,\r\n    The _Malt-Tax_, and a _Military Force_.\r\n    On these each Coffee-House will lend a hint,\r\n    Besides a thousand things that are in Print.\r\n    But steal not Word for Word, nor Thought for Thought:\r\n    For you'll be teaz'd to death, if you are caught.\r\n    When Factious Leaders boast increasing strength,\r\n    Go not too far, nor follow ev'ry Length:\r\n    Leave room for Change, turn with a grace about,\r\n    And swear you left 'em, when you found 'em out,\r\n\r\n    [16] With Art and Modesty your Part maintain:\r\n    And talk like _Col'nel Titus_, not like _Lane_;\r\n    The Trading-Knight with Rants his Speech begins,\r\n    Sun, Moon, and Stars, and Dragons, Saints, and Kings:\r\n    But _Titus_ said, with his uncommon Sense,\r\n    When the _Exclusion-Bill_ was in suspense,\r\n    I hear a Lyon in the Lobby roar;\r\n    Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the door\r\n    And keep him there, or shall we let him in\r\n    To try if we can turn him out again?\r\n\r\n    [17] Some mighty Blusterers _Impeach_ with noise,\r\n    And call their Private Cry, the Nation's Voice;\r\n\r\n    [18] From Folio's of Accounts they take their handles,\r\n    And the whole Ballance proves a pound of Candles;\r\n    As if _Paul_'s Cupola were brought to bed,\r\n    After hard Labour, of a small Pin's Head.\r\n\r\n    [19] Some _Rufus_, some the _Conqueror_ bring in,\r\n    And some from _Julius Cæsar_'s days begin.\r\n    A cunning Speaker can command his chaps,\r\n    And when the _House_ is not in humour, stops;\r\n    In Falsehood Probability imploys,\r\n    Nor his old Lies with newer Lies destroys.\r\n\r\n    [20] If when you speak, you'd hear a Needle fall,\r\n    And make the frequent _hear-hims_ rend the wall,\r\n    In matters suited to your Taste engage,\r\n    Remembring still your Quality and Age.\r\n    Thy task be this, young Knight, and hear my Song\r\n    What Politicks to ev'ry Age belong.\r\n\r\n    [21] When _Babes_ can speak, _Babes_ should be taught to say,\r\n    _King George the Second_'s Health, Huzza, Huzza!\r\n    _Boys_ should learn _Latin_ for _Prince William_'s sake,\r\n    And Girls _Louisa_ their Example make.\r\n\r\n    [22] More loves the _Youth_, just come to his Estate,\r\n    To range the fields, than in the _House_ debate;\r\n    More he delights in fav'rite Jowler's Tongue,\r\n    Than in _Will Shippen_, or _Sir William Yong_:\r\n    If in one Chase he can two Horses kill,\r\n    He cares not twopence for the Land-Tax Bill:\r\n    Loud in his Wine, in Women not o'er nice,\r\n    He damns his Uncles if they give advice;\r\n    Votes as his Father did, when there's a _Call_,\r\n    But had much rather, never Vote at all.\r\n\r\n    [23] We take a diff'rent Turn at _Twenty-six_,\r\n    And lofty thoughts on some Lord's Daughter fix;\r\n    With Men in Pow'r strict Friendship we persue,\r\n    With some considerable Post in view.\r\n     A Man of _Forty_ fears to change his Note,\r\n    One way to Speak, and t'other way to Vote;\r\n    Careful his Tongue in Passion to command,\r\n    Avoids the Bar, and Speaker's Reprimand.\r\n\r\n    [24] In Bags the _Old Man_ lets his Treasure rust,\r\n    Afraid to use it, or the Funds to trust;\r\n    When Stocks are low, he wants the heart to buy,\r\n    And through much caution sees 'em rise too high;\r\n    Thinks nothing rightly done since _Seventy-eight_,\r\n    Swears present _Members_ do not talk, but prate:\r\n    In _Charles the Second_'s days, says he, ye Prigs,\r\n    _Torys_ were _Torys_ then, and _Whigs_ were _Whigs_.\r\n    Alas! this is a lamentable Truth,\r\n    We lose in age, as we advance in youth:\r\n    I laugh, when twenty will like eighty talk,\r\n    And old _Sir John_ with _Polly Peachum_ walk.\r\n\r\n    [25] Now as to _Double_, or to _False Returns_,\r\n    When pockets suffer, and when anger burns,\r\n    O Thing surpassing faith! Knight strives with Knight,\r\n    When both have brib'd, and neither's in the right.\r\n    The Bayliff's self is sent for in that case,\r\n    And all the Witnesses had face to face.\r\n    Selected _Members_ soon the fraud unfold,\r\n    In full Committee of the _House_ 'tis told;\r\n    Th' incredible Corruption is destroy'd,\r\n    The Chairman's angry, and th' Election void.\r\n\r\n    [26] Those who would captivate the well-bred throng,\r\n    Should not too often speak, nor speak too long:\r\n    Church, nor Church Matters ever turn to Sport,\r\n    Nor make _St. Stephen's Chappel_, _Dover-Court_.\r\n\r\n    [27] The _Speaker_, when the Commons are assembl'd,\r\n    May to the _Græcian Chorus_ be resembl'd;\r\n    'Tis his the Young and Modest to espouse,\r\n    And see none draw, or challenge in the _House_:\r\n    'Tis his Old Hospitality to use,\r\n    And three good Printers for the _House_ to chuse;\r\n    To let each Representative be heard,\r\n    And take due care the _Chaplain_ be preferr'd,\r\n    To hear no _Motion_ made that's out of joint,\r\n    And where he spies his _Member_, make his point.\r\n\r\n    [28] To Knights new chosen in old time would come\r\n    The _County Trumpet_, and perhaps a _Drum_;\r\n    Now when a Burgess new Elect appears,\r\n    Come Trainbands, Horseguards, Footguards, Grenadeers;\r\n    When the majority the Town-clerk tells,\r\n    His Honour pays the Fiddles, Waits, and Bells:\r\n    Harangues the _Mob_, and is as wise and great,\r\n    As the most Mystic Oracle of State.\r\n\r\n    [29] When the Duke's Grandson for the County stood,\r\n    His Beef was fat, and his October good;\r\n    His Lordship took each Ploughman by the fist,\r\n    Drunk to their Sons, their Wives and Daughters kiss'd;\r\n    But when strong Beer their Freeborn Hearts inflames,\r\n    They sell him Bargains, and they call him Names.\r\n    Thus is it deem'd in _English_ Nobles wise\r\n    To stoop for no one reason but to rise.\r\n\r\n    [30] Election matters shun with cautious awe,\r\n    O all ye Judges Learned in the Law;\r\n    A Judge by Bribes as much himself degrades,\r\n    As Dutchess Dowager by Masquerades.\r\n\r\n    [31] Try not with Jests obscene to force a Smile,\r\n    Nor lard your Speech with Mother _Needham_'s Stile:\r\n    Let not your tongue to =Ôldphieldismus= run,\r\n    And =Kibberismus= with abhorrence shun;\r\n    Let not your looks affected words disgrace,\r\n    Nor join with silver Tongue a brazen Face;\r\n    Let not your hands, like Tallboys, be employ'd,\r\n    And the mad rant of Tragedy avoid.\r\n    Just in your Thoughts, in your Expression clear,\r\n    Neither too modest, nor too bold appear.\r\n\r\n    [32] Others in vain a like Success will boast,\r\n    He speaks most easy, who has study'd most.\r\n\r\n    [33] A Peer's pert Heir has to the Commons spoke\r\n    A vile Reflection, or a Bawdy Joke;\r\n    Call'd to the House of Lords, of this beware,\r\n    'Tis what the _Bishops Bench_ will never bear.\r\n    Amongst the _Commons_ is such freedom shown,\r\n    They lash each other, and attack the Throne:\r\n    Yet so unskilful or so fearful some,\r\n    For nine that speak there's nine-and-forty dumb.\r\n\r\n    [34] When _James_ the _first_, at great _Britannia_'s helm,\r\n    Rul'd this word-clipping and word-coining Realm,\r\n    No words to Royal favour made pretence,\r\n    But what agreed in sound and clash'd in sense.\r\n    Thrice happy he! how great that Speaker's praise,\r\n    Whose ev'ry Period look'd an hundred ways.\r\n    What then? we now with just abhorrence shun\r\n    The trifling Quibble, and the School-boys Pun;\r\n    Tho' no great Connoisseur, I make a shift\r\n    Just to find out a _Durfey_ from a _Swift_;\r\n    I can discern with half an eye, I hope,\r\n    _Mist_ from _Jo Addison_, from _Eusden Pope_:\r\n    I know a Farce from one of _Congreve_'s Plays,\r\n    And _Cibber_'s Opera from _Johnny Gay_'s.\r\n\r\n    [35] When pert _Defoe_ his sawcy Papers writ,\r\n    He from a Cart was Pillor'd for his Wit:\r\n    By Mob was pelted half a Morning's space,\r\n    And rotten Eggs besmear'd his yellow face;\r\n    The _Censor_ then improv'd the list'ning Isle,\r\n    And held both Parties in an artful Smile.\r\n    A Scribbling Crew now pinching Winter brings,)\r\n    That spare no earthly nor no heav'nly things,)\r\n    Nor Church, nor State, nor Treasurers, nor Kings.)\r\n    But Blasphemy displeases all the Town;)\r\n    And for defying Scripture, Law, and Crown,)\r\n    _Woolston_ should pay his Fine, and lose his Gown,)\r\n\r\n    [36] It must be own'd the _Journals_ try all ways\r\n    To merit their respective Party's praise:\r\n    They jar in every Article from _Spain_;\r\n    A War these threaten, those a Peace maintain:\r\n    Tho' Lye they will, to give 'em all their due,\r\n    In Foreign matters, and Domestick too.\r\n    Whoe'er thou art that would'st a _Postman_ write,\r\n    Enquire all day, and hearken all the night.\r\n    Sure, _Gazetteers_ and Writers of _Courants_\r\n    Might soon exceed th' Intelligence of _France_:\r\n    To be out-done old _England_ should refuse,\r\n    As in her Arms, so in her Publick News;\r\n    But Truth is scarce, the Scene of Action large,\r\n    And Correspondence an excessive Charge.\r\n\r\n    [37] There are who say, no Man can be a Wit\r\n    Unless for _Newgate_ or for _Bedlam_ fit;\r\n    Let Pamphleteers abusive Satyr write,\r\n    To shew a Genius is to shew a Spite:\r\n    That Author's Works will ne'er be reckon'd good\r\n    Who has not been where _Curl_ the Printer stood.\r\n\r\n    [38] Alass Poor Me, you may my fortune guess:\r\n    I write, and yet Humanity profess;\r\n    (Tho' nothing can delight a modern Judge,\r\n    Without ill-nature and a private Grudge)\r\n    I love the King, the Queen, and Royal Race:\r\n    I like the Government, but want no Place:\r\n    Too low in Life to be a _Justice_ I,\r\n    And for a Constable, thank God, too high;\r\n    Was never in a Plot, my Brain's not hurt;\r\n    I Politicks to Poetry convert.\r\n\r\n    [39] A Politician must (as I have read)\r\n    Be furnish'd, in the first place, with a _Head_:\r\n    A _Head_ well fill'd with _Machiavelian_ Brains,\r\n    And stuff'd with Precedents of former Reigns:\r\n    Must Journals read, and _Magna Charta_ quote;\r\n    But acts still wiser, if he speaks by _Note_:\r\n    Learns well his Lesson, and ne'er fears mistakes:\r\n    For Ready Money Ready Speakers makes;\r\n    He must Instructions and Credentials draw,\r\n    Pay well the Army, and protect the Law:\r\n    Give to his Country what's his Country's due,\r\n    But first help _Brothers_, _Sons_, and _Cousins_ too.\r\n    He must read _Grotius_ upon War and Peace,\r\n    And the twelve Judges Salary encrease.\r\n    He must oblige old Friends and new Allies,\r\n    And find out _Ways and Means_ for fresh _Supplies_.\r\n    He must the Weavers Grievances redress,\r\n    And Merchants wants in Merchants words express.\r\n\r\n    [40] Dramatick Poets that expect the Bays,\r\n    Should cull our Histories for Party Plays;\r\n    _Wickfort's Embassador_ should fill their head,\r\n    And the _State-Tryals_ carefully be read:\r\n    For what is _Dryden_'s Muse and _Otway_'s Plots\r\n    To th' _Earl of Essex_ or the _Queen of Scots_?\r\n\r\n    [41] 'Tis said that _Queen Elizabeth_ could speak,\r\n    At twelve years old, right _Attick_ full-mouth'd _Greek_;\r\n    Hence was the Student forc'd at _Greek_ to drudge,\r\n    If he would be a Bishop, or a Judge.\r\n    Divines and Lawyers now don't think they thrive,\r\n    'Till promis'd places of men still alive:\r\n    How old is such an one in such a Post?\r\n    The answer is, he's seventy-five almost:\r\n    Th' Arch-Bishop, and the Master of the Rolls?\r\n    Neither is young, and one's as old as _Paul_'s.\r\n    Will Men, that ask such Questions, publish books\r\n    Like learned _Hooker_'s or _Chief Justice Cook_'s?\r\n\r\n    [42] On Tender Subjects with discretion touch,\r\n    And never say too little, or too much.\r\n    On Trivial Matters Flourishes are wrong,\r\n    Motions for Candles never should be long:\r\n    Or if you move, in case of sudden Rain,\r\n    To shut the Windows, speak distinct and plain.\r\n    Unless you talk good _English_ downright Sense,\r\n    Can you be understood by Serjeant _Spence_?\r\n\r\n    [43] New Stories always should with Truth agree\r\n    Or Truth's half-Sister, Probability:\r\n    Scarce could _Toft_'s Rabbits and pretended throws\r\n    On half the Honourable _House_ impose.\r\n\r\n    [44] When _Cato_ speaks, young _Shallow_ runs away,\r\n    And swears it is so dull he cannot stay:\r\n    When Rakes begin on Blasphemy to border,\r\n    _Bromley_ and _Hanmer_ cry aloud---- _To Order_.\r\n    The point is this, with manly Sense and ease\r\n    T' inform the Judgment, and the Fancy please.\r\n    Praise it deserves, nor difficult the thing,\r\n    At once to serve one's Countrey and one's King.\r\n    Such Speeches bring the wealthy _Tonson_'s gain,)\r\n    From Age to Age they minuted remain,)\r\n    As Precedents for George the twentieth's Reign.)\r\n\r\n    [45] Is there a Man on earth so perfect found,\r\n    Who ne'er mistook a word in Sense or Sound?\r\n    Not Blund'ring, but persisting is the fault;\r\n    No mortal Sin is _Lapsus Linguæ_ thought:\r\n    Clerks may mistake; consid'ring who 'tis from,\r\n    I pardon little Slips in _Cler. Dom. Com._\r\n    But let me tell you I'll not take his part,\r\n    If ev'ry _Thursday_ he date _Die Mart_.\r\n    Of Sputt'ring mortals 'tis the fatal curse,\r\n    By mending Blunders still to make 'em worse.\r\n    Men sneer when---- gets a lucky Thought,\r\n    And stare if _Wyndham_ should be nodding caught.\r\n    But sleeping's what the wisest men may do,\r\n    Should the Committee chance to sit 'till Two.\r\n\r\n    [46] Not unlike Paintings, Principles appear,\r\n    Some best at distance, some when we are near.\r\n    The love of Politicks so vulgar's grown,\r\n    My Landlord's Party from his Sign is known:\r\n    Mark of _French_ wine, see _Ormond_'s Head appear,\r\n    While _Marlb'rough_'s Face directs to Beer and Beer:\r\n    Some _Buchanan_'s, the _Pope_'s Head some like best,\r\n    The _Devil Tavern_ is a standing jest.\r\n\r\n    [47] Whoe'er you are that have a Seat secure,\r\n    Duly return'd, and from _Petition_ sure,\r\n    Stick to your Friends in whatsoe'er you say;\r\n    With strong aversion shun the Middle way:\r\n    The Middle way the best we sometimes call,\r\n    But 'tis in Politicks no way at all.\r\n    A _Trimmer_'s what both Parties turn to sport,\r\n    By Country hated, and despis'd at Court.\r\n    Who would in earnest to a Party come,\r\n    Must give his Vote, not whimsical, but plumb.\r\n    There is no Medium: for the term in vogue\r\n    On either side is, Honest Man, or Rogue.\r\n    Can it be difficult our Minds to show,\r\n    Where all the Difference is, Yes, or No?\r\n\r\n    [48] In all Professions, Time and Pains give Skill,\r\n    Without hard Study, dare Physicians kill?\r\n    Can he that ne'er read Statutes or Reports,\r\n    Give Chamber-Counsel, or urge Law in Courts?\r\n    But ev'ry Whipster knows Affairs of State,\r\n    Nor fears on nicest Subjects to debate.\r\n    A Knight of eighteen hundred pounds a year--\r\n    Who minds his Head, if his Estate be clear?\r\n    Sure he may speak his mind, and tell the _House_,\r\n    He matters not the Government a Louse.\r\n    Lack-learning Knights, these things are safely said\r\n    To Friends in private, at the _Bedford-Head_:\r\n    But in the _House_, before your Tongue runs on,\r\n    Consult _Sir James_, _Lord William_'s dead and gone.\r\n    Words to recall is in no Member's power,\r\n    One single word may send you to the _Tower_.\r\n\r\n    [49] The wrong'd to help, the lawless to restrain,\r\n    Thrice ev'ry Year, in ancient _Egbert_'s Reign,\r\n    The _Members_ to the _Mitchelgemot_ went,\r\n    In after Ages call'd the _Parliament_;\r\n    Early the _Mitchelgemot_ did begin\r\n    T' enroll their Statutes, on a Parchment Skin:\r\n    For impious Treason hence no room was left,\r\n    For Murder, for Polygamy, or Theft:\r\n    Since when the Senates power both Sexes know\r\n    From Hops and Claret, Soap and Callico.\r\n    Now wholesom Laws young Senators bring in\r\n    'Gainst _Goats_, _Attornies_, _Bribery_, and _Gin_.\r\n    Since such the nature of the _British_ State,\r\n    The power of _Parliament_ so old and great,\r\n    Ye 'Squires and _Irish_ Lords, 'tis worth your care)\r\n    To be return'd for City, Town, or Shire,)\r\n    By Sheriff, Bailiff, Constable, or Mayor.)\r\n\r\n    [50] Some doubt, which to a Seat has best Pretence,\r\n    A man of Substance, or a man of Sense:\r\n    But never any Member feats will do,\r\n    Without a Head-piece and a Pocket too;\r\n    Sense is requir'd the depth of Things to reach,\r\n    And Money gives Authority to Speech.\r\n\r\n    [51] A Man of Bus'ness won't 'till ev'ning dine;\r\n    Abstains from Women, Company, and Wine:\r\n    From _Fig_'s new Theatre he'll miss a Night,\r\n    Tho' Cocks, and Bulls, and _Irish_ Women fight:\r\n    Nor sultry Sun, nor storms of soaking Rain,\r\n    The Man of Bus'ness from the _House_ detain:\r\n    Nor speaks he for no reason but to say,\r\n    I am a _Member_, and I spoke to day.\r\n    I speak sometimes, you'll hear his Lordship cry,\r\n    Because Some speak that have less Sense than I.\r\n\r\n    [52] The Man that has both Land and Money too\r\n    May wonders in a Trading Borough do:\r\n    They'll praise his Ven'son, and commend his Port,)\r\n    Turn their two former Members into Sport,)\r\n    And, if he likes it, Satyrize the Court.)\r\n    But at a Feast 'tis difficult to know\r\n    From real Friends an undiscover'd Foe;\r\n    The man that swears he will the Poll secure,\r\n    And pawns his Soul that your Election's sure,\r\n    Suspect that man: beware, all is not right,\r\n    He's, ten to one, a Corporation-Bite.\r\n\r\n    [53] Alderman _Pond_, a downright honest Man,\r\n    Would say, I cannot help you, or I can:\r\n    To spend your Money, Sir, is all a jest;\r\n    Matters are settled, set your heart at rest:\r\n    We've made a Compromise, and, Sir, you know,\r\n    That sends one Member _High_, and t'other _Low_.\r\n    But if his good Advice you would not take,\r\n    He'd scorn your Supper, and your Punch forsake:\r\n    Leave you of mighty Interest to brag,\r\n    And poll two Voices like _Sir Robert Fag_.\r\n\r\n    [54] _Parliamenteering_ is a sort of Itch,\r\n    That will too oft unwary Knights bewitch.\r\n    Two good Estates Sir _Harry Clodpole_ spent;\r\n    Sate thrice, but spoke not once, in Parliament:\r\n    Two good Estates are gone--Who'll take his word?\r\n    Oh! should his Uncle die, he'd spend a third:\r\n    He'd buy a House, his happiness to crown,\r\n    Within a mile of some good _Borough-Town_;\r\n    Tag, Rag, and Bobtail to Sir _Harry_'s run,\r\n    Men that have Votes, and Women that have none:\r\n    Sons, Daughters, Grandsons, with his Honour dine;\r\n    He keeps a Publick-House without a Sign.\r\n    Coolers and Smiths extol th' ensuing Choice,\r\n    And drunken Taylors boast their right of Voice.\r\n    Dearly the free-born neighbourhood is bought,\r\n    They never leave him while he's worth a groat:\r\n    So Leeches stick, nor quit the bleeding wound,\r\n    Till off they drop with Skinfuls to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _FINIS_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1] Humano capiti cervicem Pictor equinam\r\n      Jungere si velit, & varias inducere plumas,\r\n      Undiq; collatis membris, ut turpiter atrum\r\n      Desinat in piscem
