P. PUTNAM'S SONS\r\nNEW YORK AND LONDON\r\nThe Knickerbocker Press\r\n1921\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1921\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nG.P. PUTNAM'S SONS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed in the United States of America_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHERS' NOTE\r\n\r\nAmerica and England have worked and fought together and have brought to\r\na successful conclusion the great war in defence of civilization against\r\na military imperialism which was threatening to dominate the world. They\r\nhave now responsibilities together in connection with the measures\r\nneeded to assure the continued peace of the world and to secure,\r\nparticularly for the smaller states and for communities not in a\r\nposition to become independent nations, the protection of their\r\nliberties, to which they have as assured a right as that asserted by a\r\nstate of first importance which can support its claims with great\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nIn this work of helping to adjust the present urgent problems of the\r\nworld, England is demanding cooperation from America. America could not\r\nif she would, and would not if she could, escape her responsibilities,\r\nas the strongest nation in the world, a nation standing for the rights\r\nof men, for leadership in the family of nations. With these joint\r\nresponsibilities resting upon England and America, the personalities of\r\nthe men who have during the past few years had in their hands the\r\ndirection of the affairs of the United Kingdom and of the great British\r\nCommonwealth must possess an assured interest for every intelligent\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nThe clever author of _The Mirrors of Downing Street_ has brought\r\ntogether a series of critical and biographical studies, presented as\r\n\"reflections\" from the mirror in the Imperial council chamber, of\r\nthirteen typical Britons who have done noteworthy work during the years\r\nof the war and who are now grappling with the problems of the peace. The\r\nname of the author is not given, but he is evidently one who has had\r\nintimate personal association with the statesmen and administrators\r\nwhose characters he presents. These analyses are not always sympathetic,\r\nand we are not prepared to say that they will be accepted as final. They\r\nare, however, based upon full knowledge of the conditions and a close\r\npersonal study of the men. Intelligent Americans will be interested in\r\nthe opinions held by a clear-headed, capable English writer of the\r\ncharacters of leaders like Mr. Asquith, Lloyd George, Mr. Balfour, Lord\r\nRobert Cecil, Winston Churchill, and others, and they will find in these\r\npages first-hand information and clever and incisive studies of\r\nnoteworthy men whose influence has counted, and is still to count, in\r\nshaping the history of Britain and of the world.\r\n\r\nG.H.P.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, December, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me say that I hope I have not betrayed any confidences in these\r\nsketches.\r\n\r\nPublic men must expect criticism, and no criticism is so good for them,\r\nand therefore for the State, as criticism of character; but their\r\nposition is difficult, and they may justly complain when those to whom\r\nthey have spoken in the candour of private conversation make use of such\r\nconfidences for a public purpose.\r\n\r\nIf here and there I have in any degree approached this offence, let me\r\nurge two excuses. First, inspired by a pure purpose I might very easily\r\nhave said far more than I have said: and, second, my purpose is neither\r\nto grind my own axe (as witness my anonymity) nor to inflict personal\r\npain (as witness my effort to be just in all cases), but truly to raise\r\nthe tone of our public life.\r\n\r\nIt is the conviction that the tone of our public life is low, and that\r\nthis low tone is reacting disastrously in many directions, which has set\r\nme about these studies in political personality.\r\n\r\nThere is too much dust on the mirrors of Downing Street for our public\r\nmen to see themselves as others see them. Some of that dust is from the\r\nwar; some of it is the old-fashioned political dust intended for the\r\neyes of the public; but I think that the worst of all hindrances to true\r\nvision is breathed on the mirrors by those self-regarding public men in\r\nwhom principle is crumbling and moral earnestness is beginning to\r\nmoulder. One would wipe away those smears.\r\n\r\nMy duster is honest cotton; the hand that holds it is at least clean;\r\nand the energy of the rubbing is inspired solely by the hope that such\r\nlabour may be of some benefit to my country.\r\n\r\nI think our statesmen may be better servants of the great nation they\r\nhave the honour to serve if they see themselves as others see\r\nthem--others who are not political adversaries, and who are more\r\ninterested in the moral and intellectual condition of the State than in\r\nthe fortunes of its parties.\r\n\r\nNo man can ever be worthy of England; but we must be anxious when the\r\nheart and centre of public service are not an earnest desire to be as\r\nworthy of her as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                            PAGE\r\n\r\nPUBLISHER'S NOTE                      v\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                        vii\r\n\r\nI.--MR.

LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n     Born, Manchester, 1863; son of the late Wm. George, Master of the\r\n     Hope Street Unitarian Schools, Liverpool. Educated in a Welsh\r\n     Church School and under tutors. By profession a solicitor.\r\n     President of the Board of Trade, 1905-8; Chancellor of the\r\n     Exchequer, 1908-15; Minister of Munitions, 1915-16; Secretary for\r\n     War, 1916; Prime Minister, 1916-20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMR. LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n     _\"And wars, like mists that rise against the sun,\r\n     Made him but greater seem, not greater grow.\"_\r\n\r\n     DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, no one since Napoleon has appeared on the earth\r\nwho attracts so universal an interest as Mr. Lloyd George. This is a\r\nrather startling thought.\r\n\r\nIt is significant, I think, how completely a politician should\r\novershadow all the great soldiers and sailors charged with their\r\nnation's very life in the severest and infinitely the most critical\r\nmilitary struggle of man's history.\r\n\r\nA democratic age, lacking in colour, and antipathetic to romance,\r\nsomewhat obscures for us the pictorial achievement of this remarkable\r\nfigure. He lacks only a crown, a robe, and a gilded chair easily to\r\noutshine in visible picturesqueness the great Emperor. His achievement,\r\nwhen we consider what hung upon it, is greater than Napoleon's, the\r\nnarrative of his origin more romantic, his character more complex. And\r\nyet who does not feel the greatness of Napoleon?--and who does not\r\nsuspect the shallowness of Mr. Lloyd George?\r\n\r\nHistory, it is certain, will unmask his pretensions to grandeur with a\r\nrough, perhaps with an angry hand; but all the more because of this\r\nunmasking posterity will continue to crowd about the exposed hero\r\nasking, and perhaps for centuries continuing to ask, questions\r\nconcerning his place in the history of the world. \"How came it, man of\r\nstraw, that in Armageddon there was none greater than you?\"\r\n\r\nThe coldest-blooded amongst us, Mr. Massingham of _The Nation_ for\r\nexample, must confess that it was a moment rich in the emotion which\r\nbestows immortality on incident when this son of a village schoolmaster,\r\nwho grew up in a shoemaker's shop, and whose boyish games were played in\r\nthe street of a Welsh hamlet remote from all the refinements of\r\ncivilization and all the clangours of industrialism, announced to a\r\nbreathless Europe without any pomposity of phrase and with but a brief\r\nand contemptuous gesture of dismissal the passing away from the world's\r\nstage of the Hapsburgs and Hohenzollerns--those ancient, long glorious,\r\nand most puissant houses whose history for an æon was the history of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nSuch topsy-turvydom, such historical anarchy, tilts the figure of Mr.\r\nLloyd George into a salience so conspicuous that for a moment one is\r\ntempted to confuse prominence with eminence, and to mistake the slagheap\r\nof upheaval for the peaks of Olympus.\r\n\r\nBut how is it that this politician has attained even to such\r\nsuper-prominence?\r\n\r\nAnother incident of which the public knows nothing, helps one, I think,\r\nto answer this question. Early in the struggle to get munitions for our\r\nsoldiers a meeting of all the principal manufacturers of armaments was\r\nheld in Whitehall with the object of persuading them to pool their trade\r\nsecrets. For a long time this meeting was nothing more than a succession\r\nof blunt speeches on the part of provincial manufacturers, showing with\r\nan unanswerable commercial logic that the suggestion of revealing these\r\nsecrets on which their fortunes depended was beyond the bounds of\r\nreason. All the interjected arguments of the military and official\r\ngentlemen representing the Government were easily proved by these\r\nhard-headed manufacturers, responsible to their workpeople and\r\nshareholders for the prosperity of their competing undertakings, to be\r\nimpracticable if not preposterous.\r\n\r\nAt a moment when the proposal of the Government seemed lost, Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge leant forward in his chair, very pale, very quiet, and very\r\nearnest. \"Gentlemen,\" he said in a voice which produced an extraordinary\r\nhush, \"have you forgotten that your sons, at this very moment, are being\r\nkilled--killed in hundreds and thousands? They are being killed by\r\nGerman guns for want of British guns. Your sons, your brothers--boys at\r\nthe dawn of manhood!--they are being wiped out of life in thousands!\r\nGentlemen, give me guns. Don't think of your trade secrets. Think of\r\nyour children. Help them! Give me those guns.\"\r\n\r\nThis was no stage acting. His voice broke, his eyes filled with tears,\r\nand his hand, holding a piece of notepaper before him, shook like a\r\nleaf. There was not a man who heard him whose heart was not touched, and\r\nwhose humanity was not quickened. The trade secrets were pooled. The\r\nsupply of munitions was hastened.\r\n\r\nThis is the secret of his power. No man of our period, when he is\r\nprofoundly moved, and when he permits his genuine emotion to carry him\r\naway, can utter _an appeal to conscience_ with anything like so\r\ncompelling a simplicity. His failure lies in a growing tendency to\r\ndiscard an instinctive emotionalism for a calculated astuteness which\r\ntoo often attempts to hide its cunning under the garb of honest\r\nsentiment. His intuitions are unrivalled: his reasoning powers\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lloyd George first came to London he shared not only a room in\r\nGray's Inn, but the one bed that garret contained with a\r\nfellow-countryman. They were both inconveniently poor, but Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge the poorer in this, that as a member of Parliament his expenses\r\nwere greater. The fellow-lodger, who afterwards became private secretary\r\nto one of Mr. Lloyd George's rivals, has told me that no public speech\r\nof Mr. Lloyd George ever equalled in pathos and power the speeches which\r\nthe young member of Parliament would often make in those hungry days,\r\nseated on the edge of the bed, or pacing to and fro in the room,\r\nspeeches lit by one passion and directed to one great object, lit by the\r\npassion of justice, directed to the liberation of all peoples oppressed\r\nby every form of tyranny.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of the intuitional reformer, who feels cruelty and wrong\r\nlike a pain in his own blood, is still present in Mr. Lloyd George, but\r\nit is no longer the central passion of his life. It is, rather, an\r\naside: as it were a memory that revives only in leisure hours. On\r\nseveral occasions he has spoken to me of the sorrows and sufferings of\r\nhumanity with an unmistakable sympathy. I remember in particular one\r\noccasion on which he told me the story of his boyhood: it was a moving\r\nnarrative, for never once did he refer to his own personal deprivations,\r\nnever once express regret for his own loss of powerful encouragements in\r\nthe important years of boyhood. The story was the story of his widowed\r\nmother and of her heroic struggle, keeping house for her shoemaking\r\nbrother-in-law on the little money earned by the old bachelor's village\r\ncobbling, to save sixpence a week--sixpence to be gratefully returned to\r\nhim on Saturday night. \"That is the life of the poor!\" he exclaimed\r\nearnestly. Then he added with bitterness, \"And when I try to give them\r\nfive shillings a week in their old age I am called the 'Cad of the\r\nCabinet'!\"\r\n\r\nNothing in his life is finer than the struggle he waged with the Liberal\r\nCabinet during his days as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The private\r\nopposition he encountered in Downing Street, the hatred and contempt of\r\nsome of his Liberal colleagues, was exceeded on the other side of\r\npolitics only in the violent mind of Sir Edward Carson. Even the gentle\r\nJohn Morley was troubled by his hot insistences. \"I had better go,\" he\r\nsaid to Mr. Lloyd George; \"I am getting old: I have nothing now for you\r\nbut criticism.\" To which the other replied, \"Lord Morley, I would sooner\r\nhave your criticism than the praise of any man living\"--a perfectly\r\nsincere remark, sincere, I mean, with the emotionalism of the moment.\r\nHis schemes were disordered and crude; nevertheless the spirit that\r\ninformed them was like a new birth in the politics of the whole world. A\r\nfriend of mine told me that he had seen pictures of Mr. Lloyd George on\r\nthe walls of peasants' houses in the remotest villages of Russia.\r\n\r\nBut those days have departed and taken with them the fire of Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge's passion. The laboured peroration about the hills of his\r\nancestors, repeated to the point of the ridiculous, is all now left of\r\nthat fervid period. He has ceased to be a prophet. Surrounded by\r\nsecond-rate people, and choosing for his intimate friends mainly the new\r\nrich, and now thoroughly liking the game of politics for its amusing\r\nadventure, he has retained little of his original genius except its\r\nquickness.\r\n\r\nHis intuitions are amazing. He astonished great soldiers in the war by\r\nhis premonstrations. Lord Milner, a cool critic, would sit by the sofa\r\nof the dying Dr. Jameson telling how Mr. Lloyd George was right again\r\nand again when all the soldiers were wrong. Lord Rhondda, who disliked\r\nhim greatly and rather despised him, told me how often Mr. Lloyd George\r\nput heart into a Cabinet that was really trembling on the edge of\r\ndespair. It seems true that he never once doubted ultimate victory,\r\nand, what is much more remarkable, never once failed to read the\r\nGerman's mind.\r\n\r\nI think that the doom that has fallen upon him comes in some measure\r\nfrom the amusement he takes in his mental quickness, and the reliance he\r\nis sometimes apt to place upon it. A quick mind may easily be a\r\ndisorderly mind. Moreover quickness is not one of the great qualities.\r\nIt is indeed seldom a partner with virtue. Morality appears on the whole\r\nto get along better without it. According to Landor, it is the talent\r\nmost open to suspicion:\r\n\r\n     Quickness is among the least of the mind's properties, and belongs\r\n     to her in almost her lowest state: nay, it doth not abandon her\r\n     when she is driven from her home, when she is wandering and insane.\r\n     The mad often retain it; the liar has it; the cheat has it: we find\r\n     it on the racecourse and at the card-table: education does not give\r\n     it, and reflection takes away from it.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider what Mr. Lloyd George might have done with the fortunes\r\nof humanity we are able to see how great is his distance from the\r\nheights of moral grandeur.\r\n\r\nHe entered the war with genuine passion. He swept thousands of\r\nhesitating minds into those dreadful furnaces by the force of that\r\npassion. From the first no man in the world sounded so ringing a trumpet\r\nnote of moral indignation and moral aspiration. Examine his earlier\r\nspeeches and in all of them you will find that his passion to destroy\r\nPrussian militarism was his passion to recreate civilization on the\r\nfoundations of morality and religion. He was Peace with a sword. Germany\r\nhad not so much attempted to drag mankind back to barbarism as opened a\r\ngate through which mankind might march to the promised land. Lord Morley\r\nwas almost breaking his heart with despair, and to this day regards\r\nGreat Britain's entrance into the war as a mistake. Sir Edward Grey was\r\nagonizing to avert war; but Mr. Lloyd George was among the first to see\r\nthis war as the opportunity of a nobler civilization. Destroy German\r\nmilitarism, shatter the Prussian tradition, sweep away dynastic\r\nautocracies, and what a world would result for labouring humanity!\r\n\r\nThis was 1914. But soon after the great struggle had begun the note\r\nchanged. Hatred of Germany and fear for our Allies' steadfastness\r\noccupied the foremost place in his mind. Victory was the objective and\r\nhis definition of victory was borrowed from the prize-ring. A better\r\nworld had to wait. He became more and more reckless. There was a time\r\nwhen his indignation against Lord Kitchener was almost uncontrollable.\r\nFor Mr. Asquith he never entertained this violent feeling, but gradually\r\nlost patience with him, and only decided that he must go when\r\nprocrastination appeared to jeopardize \"a knock-out blow.\"\r\n\r\nAnyone who questioned the cost of the war was a timid soul. What did it\r\nmatter what the war cost so long as victory was won? Anyone who\r\nquestioned the utter recklessness which characterized the Ministry of\r\nMunitions was a mere fault-finder. I spoke to him once of the unrest in\r\nfactories, where boys could earn £15 and £16 a week by merely watching a\r\nmachine they knew nothing about, while the skilled foremen, who alone\r\ncould put those machines right, and who actually invented new tools to\r\nmake the new machines of the inventors, were earning only the fixed wage\r\nof fifty shillings a week. I thought this arrangement made for unrest\r\nand must prove dangerous after the war. So eager, so hot was his mind on\r\nthe end, that he missed the whole point of my remark. \"What does it\r\nmatter,\" he exclaimed impatiently, \"what we pay those boys as long as we\r\nwin the war?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the end of it was the humiliation of the General Election in 1918.\r\nWhere was the new world, then? He was conscious only of Lord\r\nNorthcliffe's menace. Germany must pay and the Kaiser must be tried!\r\nThere was no trumpet note in those days, and there has been no trumpet\r\nnote since. Imagine how Gladstone would have appealed to the conscience\r\nof his countrymen! Was there ever a greater opportunity in\r\nstatesmanship? After a victory so tremendous, was there any demand on\r\nthe generosity of men's souls which would not gladly have been granted?\r\nThe long struggle between capital and labour, which tears every state in\r\ntwo, might have been ended: the heroism and self-sacrifice of the war\r\nmight have been carried forward to the labours of reconstruction: the\r\nwounds of Europe might have been healed by the charities of God almost\r\nto the transfiguration of humanity.\r\n\r\nGermany must pay for the war!--and he knew that by no possible means\r\ncould Germany be made to pay that vast account without the gravest\r\ndanger of unemployment here and Bolshevism in Central Europe! The Kaiser\r\nmust be tried!--and he knew that the Kaiser never would be tried!\r\n\r\nMillennium dipped below the horizon, and the child's riding-whip which\r\nLord Northcliffe cracks when he is overtaken by a fit of Napoleonic\r\nindigestion assumed for the Prime Minister the proportions of the\r\nDamoclesian sword. He numbered himself among the Tououpinambos, those\r\npeople who \"have no name for God and believe that they will get into\r\nParadise by practising revenge and eating up their enemies.\"\r\n\r\nI can see nothing sinister in what some people regard as his plots\r\nagainst those who disagree with him. He tries, first of all, to win them\r\nto his way of thinking: if he fails, and if they still persist in\r\nattacking him, he proceeds to destroy them. It is all part of life's\r\nbattle! But one would rather that the Prime Minister of Great Britain\r\nwas less mixed up in journalism, less afraid of journalism, and less\r\noccupied, however indirectly, in effecting, or striving to effect,\r\neditorial changes. His conduct in the last months of the war and during\r\nthe election of 1918 was not only unworthy of his position but marked\r\nhim definitely as a small man. He won the election, but he lost the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is a great thing to have won the war, but to have won it only at the\r\ncost of more wars to come, and with the domestic problems of\r\nstatesmanship multiplied and intensified to a degree of the gravest\r\ndanger, this is an achievement which cannot move the lasting admiration\r\nof the human race.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Mr. Lloyd George has gradually lost in the world of\r\npolitical makeshift his original enthusiasm for righteousness. He is not\r\na bad man to the exclusion of goodness; but he is not a good man to the\r\nexclusion of badness. A woman who knows him well once described him to\r\nme in these words: \"He is clever, and he is stupid; truthful and\r\nuntruthful; pure and impure; good and wicked; wonderful and commonplace:\r\nin a word, he is everything.\" I am quite sure that he is perfectly\r\nsincere when he speaks of high aims and pure ambition; but I am equally\r\nsure that it is a relief to him to speak with amusement of trickery,\r\ncleverness, and the tolerances or the cynicisms of worldliness.\r\n\r\nSomething of the inward man may be seen in the outward. Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge--I hope I may be pardoned by the importance and interest of the\r\nsubject for pointing it out--is curiously formed. His head is unusually\r\nlarge, and his broad shoulders and deep chest admirably match his quite\r\nnoble head; but below the waist he appears to dwindle away, his legs\r\nseeming to bend under the weight of his body, so that he waddles rather\r\nthan walks, moving with a rolling gait which is rather like a seaman's.\r\nHe is, indeed, a giant mounted on a dwarf's legs.\r\n\r\nSo in like manner one may see in him a soul of eagle force striving to\r\nrise above the earth on sparrow's wings.\r\n\r\nThat he is attractive to men of a high order may be seen from the\r\ndevotion of Mr. Philip Kerr; that he is able to find pleasure in a far\r\nlower order of men may be seen from his closer friendships. It is\r\nimpossible to imagine Mr. Gladstone enjoying the society of Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge's most constant companion although that gentleman is a far better\r\ncreature than the cause of his fortunes; and one doubts if Lord\r\nBeaconsfield would have trusted even the least frank of his private\r\nnegotiations to some of the men who enjoy the Prime Minister's political\r\nconfidence. Nor can Mr. Lloyd George retort that he makes use of all\r\nkinds of energy to get his work done, for one knows very well that he is\r\nfar more at his ease with these third-rate people than with people of a\r\nhigher and more intellectual order. For culture he has not the very\r\nleast of predilections; and the passion of morality becomes more and\r\nmore one of the pious memories of his immaturity.\r\n\r\nDr. Clifford would be gladly, even beautifully, welcomed; but after an\r\nhour an interruption by Sir William Sutherland would be a delightful\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nM. Clemenceau exclaimed of him, lifting up amazed hands, \"I have never\r\nmet so ignorant a man as Lloyd George!\" A greater wit said of him, \"I\r\nbelieve Mr. Lloyd George _can_ read, but I am perfectly certain he never\r\ndoes.\"\r\n\r\nI detect in him an increasing lethargy both of mind and body. His\r\npassion for the platform, which was once more to him than anything else,\r\nhas almost gone. He enjoys well enough a fight when he is in it, but to\r\nget him into a fight is not now so easy as his hangers-on would wish.\r\nThe great man is tired, and, after all, evolution is not to be hurried.\r\nHe loves his arm-chair, and he loves talking. Nothing pleases him for a\r\nlonger spell than desultory conversation with someone who is content to\r\nlisten, or with someone who brings news of electoral chances. Of course\r\nhe is a tired man, but his fatigue is not only physical. He mounted up\r\nin youth with wings like an eagle, in manhood he was able to run without\r\nweariness, but the first years of age find him unable to walk without\r\nfaintness--the supreme test of character. If he had been able to keep\r\nthe wings of his youth I think he might have been almost the greatest\r\nman of British history. But luxury has invaded, and cynicism; and now a\r\ncigar in the depths of an easy-chair, with Miss Megan Lloyd George on\r\nthe arm, and a clever politician on the opposite side of the hearth,\r\nthis is pleasanter than any poetic vapourings about the millennium.\r\n\r\nIf only he could rise from that destroying chair, if only he could fling\r\noff his vulgar friendships, if only he could trust himself to his\r\nvision, if only he could believe once again passionately in truth, and\r\njustice, and goodness, and the soul of the British people!\r\n\r\nOne wonders if the angels in heaven will ever forgive his silence at a\r\ntime when the famished children of Austria, many of them born with no\r\nbones, were dying like flies at the shrivelled breasts of their starving\r\nmothers. One wonders if the historian sixty years hence will be able to\r\nforgive him his rebuff to the first genuine democratic movement in\r\nGermany during the war. His responsibility to God and to man is enormous\r\nbeyond reckoning. Only the future can decide his place here and\r\nhereafter. It is a moral universe, and, sooner or later, the judgments\r\nof God manifest themselves to the eyes of men.\r\n\r\nOne seems to see in him an illustrious example both of the value and\r\nperils of emotionalism. What power in the world is greater, controlled\r\nby moral principle? What power so dangerous, when moral earnestness\r\nceases to inspire the feelings?\r\n\r\nBefore the war he did much to quicken the social conscience throughout\r\nthe world; at the outbreak of war he was the very voice of moral\r\nindignation; and during the war he was the spirit of victory; for all\r\nthis, great is our debt to him. But he took upon his shoulders a\r\nresponsibility which was nothing less than the future of civilization,\r\nand here he trusted not to vision and conscience but to compromise,\r\nmakeshift, patches, and the future of civilization is still dark indeed.\r\n\r\nThis I hope may be said on his behalf when he stands at the bar of\r\nhistory, that the cause of his failure to serve the world as he might\r\nhave done, as Gladstone surely would have done, was due rather to a\r\nvulgarity of mind for which he was not wholly responsible than to any\r\ndeliberate choice of a cynical partnership with the powers of darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD CARNOCK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD CARNOCK, 1ST BARON (ARTHUR NICOLSON, 11TH BART.)\r\n\r\n     Born, 1849. Educ.: Rugby and Oxford; in Foreign Office, 1870-74;\r\n     Secretary to Earl Granville, 1872-74; Embassy at Berlin, 1874-76;\r\n     at Pekin, 1876-78; Chargé, Athens, 1884-85; Teheran, 1885-88;\r\n     Consul-General, Budapest, 1888-93; Embassy, Constantinople, 1894;\r\n     Minister, Morocco, 1895-1904; Ambassador, Madrid, 1904-5;\r\n     Ambassador, Russia, 1905-10; Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs,\r\n     1910-16. Author of the _History of the German Constitution_, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD CARNOCK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLORD CARNOCK\r\n\r\n     _\"Usually the greatest boasters are the smallest workers. The deep\r\n     rivers pay a larger tribute to the sea than shallow brooks, and yet\r\n     empty themselves with less noise.\"_--SECKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening in London I mentioned to a man well versed in foreign\r\naffairs that I was that night meeting Lord Carnock at dinner. \"Ah!\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"the man who made the war.\"\r\n\r\nI mentioned this remark to Lord Carnock. He smiled and made answer,\r\n\"What charming nonsense!\" I asked him what he thought was in my friend's\r\nmind. \"Oh, I see what he meant,\" was the answer; \"but it is a wild mind\r\nthat would say any one man made the war.\" Later, after some remarks\r\nwhich I do not feel myself at liberty to repeat, he said: \"Fifty years\r\nhence I think a historian will find it far more difficult than we do now\r\nto decide who made the war.\"\r\n\r\nIf Lord Carnock were to write his memoirs, not only would that volume\r\nhelp the historian to follow the immediate causes of the war to one\r\nintelligible origin, but it would also afford the people of England an\r\nopportunity of seeing the conspicuous difference between a statesman of\r\nthe old school and a politician of these latter days.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of this most amiable and cultivated person, and compare his\r\nway of looking at the evolution of human life with Mr. Lloyd George's\r\nway of reading the political heavens, a sentence in Bagehot's essay on\r\nCharles Dickens comes into my mind: \"There is nothing less like the\r\ngreat lawyer, acquainted with broad principles and applying them with\r\ndistinct deduction, than the attorney's clerk who catches at small\r\npoints like a dog biting at flies.\"\r\n\r\nNo one could be less like the popular politician of our very noisy days\r\nthan this slight and gentle person whose refinement of mind reveals\r\nitself in a face almost ascetic, whose intelligence is of a wide,\r\ncomprehensive, and reflecting order, and whose manner is certainly the\r\nlast thing in the world that would recommend itself to the mind of an\r\nadvertising agent. But there is no living politician who watched so\r\nintelligently the long beginnings of the war or knew so certainly in the\r\ndays of tension that war had come, as this modest and gracious gentleman\r\nwhose devotion to principle and whose quiet faith in the power of simple\r\nhonour had outwitted the chaotic policy and the makeshift diplomacy of\r\nthe German long before the autumn of 1914.\r\n\r\nThis may be said without revealing any State secret or breaking any\r\nprivate confidence:\r\n\r\nAs Sir Arthur Nicolson, our Ambassador at St. Petersburg, Lord Carnock\r\nwon for England, as no other man had done before him, the love of\r\nRussia. The rulers of Russia trusted him. He was their friend in a\r\ndarkness which had begun to alarm them, a darkness which made them\r\nconscious of their country's weakness, and which brought to their ears\r\nagain and again the rumbles of approaching storm. Lord Carnock,\r\nsincerely loving these people, received their confidence as one friend\r\nreceives the confidence of another. His advice was honourable advice. He\r\ncounselled these friends to set their house in order and to stand firm\r\nin the conviction of their strength. Their finances were a chaos, their\r\narmy was disorganized; let them begin in those quarters; let them bring\r\norder into their finances and let them reorganize their army.\r\n\r\nWhile he was at St. Petersburg, after a wide experience in other\r\ncountries, he twice saw Russia humiliated by Germany. Twice he witnessed\r\nthe agony of his Russian friends in having to bow before the threats of\r\nPrussia. Remember that the rulers of Russia in those days were the most\r\ncharming and cultivated people in the world, whereas the Prussian as a\r\ndiplomatist was the same Prussian whom, even as an ally of ours in 1815,\r\nCroker found \"very insolent, and hardly less offensive to the English\r\nthan to the French.\"[1] The Russians felt those humiliations as a\r\ngentleman would feel the bullying of an upstart.\r\n\r\nLord Carnock was at the Foreign Office in July, 1914. He alone knew that\r\nRussia would fight. For the rest of mankind, certainly for the German\r\nKaiser, it was to be another bloodless humiliation of the Russian Bear.\r\nAdmiral von Tirpitz wanted war: Bethmann-Hollweg did not. The great\r\nmajority of the German people, in whom a genuine fear of Russia had\r\nincreased under the astute propaganda of the War Party, hoped that the\r\nsword had only to be flashed in Russia's face for that vast barbarian to\r\ncower once again. Few statesmen in Europe thought otherwise. Sir Edward\r\nGrey, I have good reason to think, did not consider that Russia would\r\nfight. He erred with that great number of educated Germans who thought\r\nthe sword had only to be rattled a little more loudly in the scabbard\r\nfor Russia to weaken, and for Germany to gain, without cost, the supreme\r\nobject of her policy--_an increasing ascendancy in the Balkans_. But\r\nthis time Russia was ready, and this time Lord Carnock knew Russia would\r\nfight. I am not sure that Lord Carnock was not the only statesman in\r\nEurope who possessed this knowledge--the knowledge on which everything\r\nhung.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for thoughtless people, either in their hatred or love of\r\nBolshevism, to forget that the old Russia saved France from destruction\r\nand made a greater sacrifice of her noblest life than any other nation\r\nin the great struggle. The first Russian armies, composed of the very\r\nflower of her manhood, fought with a matchless heroism, and, so\r\nfighting, delivered France from an instant defeat.\r\n\r\nLord Carnock may justly be said to have prepared Russia for this\r\nordeal--for a true friend helps as well as gives good advice. But it\r\nwould be a total misjudgment of his character which saw in this great\r\nwork a clever stroke of diplomatic skill.\r\n\r\nLord Carnock was inspired by a moral principle. He saw that Russia was\r\ntempting the worst passions of Germany by her weakness. He felt this\r\nweakness to be unworthy of a country whose intellectual achievements\r\nwere so great as Russia's. He had no enmity at all against the Germans.\r\nHe saw their difficulties, but regretted the spirit in which they were\r\nattempting to deal with those difficulties--a spirit hateful to a nature\r\nso gentle and a mind so honourable.\r\n\r\nHe had studied for many years the Balkan problem. He knew that as\r\nAustria weakened, Germany would more and more feel the menace of Russia.\r\nHe saw, over and over again, the diplomacy of the Germans thrusting\r\nAustria forward to a paramount position in the Balkans, and with his own\r\neyes he saw the Germans in Bulgaria and Turkey fastening their hold upon\r\nthose important countries. If Russia weakened, Germany would be master\r\nof the world. A strong Russia might alarm Germany and precipitate a\r\nconflict, but it was the world's chief fortress against Prussian\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of Russia he worked for Russia, loving her people and yet\r\nseeing the dangers of the Russian character; hoping that a\r\nself-respecting Russia might save mankind from the horrors of war and,\r\nif war came, the worse horrors of a German world-conquest. This work of\r\nhis, which helped so materially to save the world, was done with clean\r\nhands. It was never the work of a war-monger. No foreigner ever\r\nexercised so great an influence in Russia, and this influence had its\r\npower in his moral nature. I had this from M. Sazonoff himself.\r\n\r\nSuch a man as Lord Carnock could not make any headway in English\r\npolitical life. It is worth our while to reflect that the intelligence\r\nof such men is lost to us in our home government. They have no taste for\r\nthe platform, the very spirit of the political game is repellent to\r\nthem, and they recoil from the self-assertion which appears to be\r\nnecessary to political advancement in the House of Commons. No doubt the\r\nintelligence of men like Mr. J.H. Thomas or Mr. William Brace, certainly\r\nof Mr. Clynes, is sufficient for the crudest of our home needs,\r\nsufficient for the daily bread of our political life; but who can doubt\r\nthat English politics would be lifted into a higher and altogether purer\r\nregion if men like Lord Carnock were at the head of things, to provide\r\nfor the spirit of man as well as for his stomach?\r\n\r\nMore and more, I think, gentlemen will stand aloof from politics--I\r\nmean, gentlemen who have received in their blood and in their training\r\nthose notions of graciousness, sweetness, and nobleness which flow from\r\ncenturies of piety and learning. Only here and there will such a man\r\naccept the odious conditions of our public life, inspired by a sense of\r\nduty, and prepared to endure the intolerable ugliness and dishonesty of\r\npolitics for the sake of a cause which moves him with all the force of a\r\ngreat affection. But on the whole it is probable that the political\r\nfortunes of this great and beautiful country are committed for many\r\nyears to hands which are not merely over-rough for so precious a charge,\r\nbut not near clean enough for the sacredness of the English cause.\r\n\r\nOnly by indirect action, only by a much more faithful energy on the part\r\nof Aristocracy and the Church, and a far nobler realization of its\r\nresponsibilities by the Press, can the ancient spirit of England make\r\nitself felt in the sordid lists of Westminster. Till then he who crows\r\nloudest will rule the roost.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Croker writes from Paris of a visit to St. Cloud, where he found\r\nBlücher and his staff in possession: \"The great hall was a common\r\nguard-house, in which the Prussians were drinking, spitting, smoking,\r\nand sleeping in all directions.\" Denon complained greatly of the\r\nPrussians and said he was \"malheureux to have to do with a bête féroce,\r\nun animal indécrottable, le Prince Blücher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON FISHER, ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET (JOHN ARBUTHNOT FISHER)\r\n\r\n     Born, 1841; entered Navy, 1854; took part in 1860 in the Capture of\r\n     Canton and the Peiho Forts; Crimean War, 1855; China War, 1859-60;\r\n     Egyptian War and Bombardment of Alexandria, 1882; Lord of the\r\n     Admiralty, 1892-97; Commander-in-Chief, North American Station,\r\n     1897-99; Mediterranean Station, 1899-02; Commander-in-Chief,\r\n     1903-1904; 1st Sea Lord, 1904-10; 1914-15; died, 1920.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARON FISHER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLORD FISHER\r\n\r\n     _\"Look for a tough wedge for a tough log.\"_\r\n\r\n     PUBLIUS SYRUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man I have met ever gave me so authentic a feeling of originality as\r\nthis dare-devil of genius, this pirate of public life, who more than any\r\nother Englishman saved British democracy from a Prussian domination.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to regard him as a very simple soul mastered by one\r\ntremendous purpose and by that purpose exalted to a most valid\r\ngreatness. If this purpose be kept steadily in mind, one may indeed see\r\nin Lord Fisher something quite childlike. At any rate it is only when\r\nthe overmastering purpose is forgotten that he can be seen with the eyes\r\nof his enemies, that is to say as a monster, a scoundrel, and an\r\nimbecile.\r\n\r\nHe was asked on one occasion if he had been a little unscrupulous in\r\ngetting his way at the Admiralty. He replied that if his own brother had\r\ngot in front of him when he was trying to do something for England he\r\nwould have knocked that brother down and walked over his body.\r\n\r\nHere is a man, let us be quite certain, of a most unusual force, a man\r\nconscious in himself of powers greater than the kindest could discern in\r\nhis contemporaries, a man possessed by a dæmon of inspiration.\r\nFortunately for England this dæmon drove him in one single direction: he\r\nsought the safety, honour, and glory of Great Britain. If his\r\ncontemporaries had been travelling whole-heartedly in the same direction\r\nI have no doubt that he might have figured in the annals of the\r\nAdmiralty as something of a saint. But unhappily many of his associates\r\nwere not so furiously driven in this direction, and finding his urgings\r\ninconvenient and vexatious they resisted him to the point of\r\nexasperation: then came the struggle, and, the strong man winning, the\r\nweaker went off to abuse him, and not only to abuse him, but to vilify\r\nhim and to plot against him, and lay many snares for his feet. He will\r\nnever now be numbered among the saints, but, happily for us, he was not\r\ndestined to be found among the martyrs.\r\n\r\nHe has said that in the darkest hours of his struggle he had no one to\r\nsupport him save King Edward. Society was against him; half the\r\nAdmiralty was crying for his blood; the politicians wavered from one\r\nside to the other; only the King stood fast and bade him go on with a\r\ngood heart. When he emerged from this tremendous struggle his hands may\r\nnot have been as clean as the angels could have wished; but the British\r\nNavy was no longer scattered over the pleasant waters of the earth, was\r\nno longer thinking chiefly of its paint and brass, was no longer a\r\npretty sight from Mediterranean or Pacific shores--it was almost the\r\ndirtiest thing to be seen in the North Sea, and quite the deadliest\r\nthing in the whole world as regards gunnery.\r\n\r\nThis was Lord Fisher's superb service. He foresaw and he prepared. Not\r\nmerely the form of the Fleet was revolutionized under his hand, but its\r\nspirit. The British Navy was baptized into a new birth with the pea-soup\r\nof the North Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen this great work was accomplished he ordered a ship to be built\r\nwhich should put the Kiel Canal out of business for many years. That\r\ndone, and while the Germans were spending the marks which otherwise\r\nwould have built warships in widening and deepening this channel to the\r\nNorth Sea, Lord Fisher wrote it down that war with Germany would come in\r\n1914, and that Captain Jellicoe would be England's Nelson.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment he lost something of the hard and almost brutal\r\nexpression which had given so formidable a character to his face. He\r\ngave rein to his natural humour. He let himself go; quoted more freely\r\nfrom the Bible, asserted more positively that the English people are the\r\nlost tribes of Israel, and waited for Armageddon with a humorous eye on\r\nthe perturbed face of Admiral Tirpitz.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1914, he was out of office. A telegram came to him from Mr.\r\nWinston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, requesting to see him\r\nurgently. Lord Fisher refused to see him, believing that Mr. Churchill\r\nhad jockeyed Mr. Reginald McKenna out of the Admiralty--Mr. McKenna who\r\nhad most bravely, nay heroically, stood by the naval estimates in face\r\nof strong Cabinet opposition. On this ground he refused to meet Mr.\r\nChurchill. But a telegram from Mr. McKenna followed, urging him to grant\r\nthis interview, and the meeting took place, a private meeting away from\r\nLondon. Mr. Churchill informed Lord Fisher of the facts of the European\r\nsituation, and asked him for advice. The facts were sufficient to\r\nconvince Lord Fisher that the tug-o'-war between Germany and England had\r\nbegun. He told Mr. Churchill that he must do three things, and do them\r\nall by telegram before he left that room: he must mobilize the Fleet, he\r\nmust buy the Dreadnoughts building for Turkey, and he must appoint\r\nAdmiral Jellicoe Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet. To do either of\r\nthe first two was a serious breach of Cabinet discipline; to do the last\r\nwas to offend a string of Admirals senior to Admiral Jellicoe. Mr.\r\nChurchill hesitated. Lord Fisher insisted. \"What does it matter,\" he\r\nsaid, \"whom you offend?--the fate of England depends on you. Does it\r\nmatter if they shoot you, or hang you, or send you to the Tower, so long\r\nas England is saved?\" And Mr. Churchill did as he was bidden--the\r\ngreatest act in his life, and perhaps one of the most courageous acts in\r\nthe history of statesmanship. Lord Fisher said afterwards, \"You may not\r\nlike Winston, but he has got the heart of a lion.\"\r\n\r\nThus was England saved, and Germany doomed. Before war was declared the\r\nBritish Fleet held the seas, and in command of that Fleet was the\r\nquickest working brain in the Navy.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, during the dark days of the war, I was lunching at the\r\nAdmiralty with Lord Fisher, who had then been recalled to office. He\r\nappeared rather dismal, and to divert him I said, \"I've got some good\r\nnews for you--we are perfectly safe and Germany is beaten.\" He looked up\r\nfrom his plate and regarded me with lugubrious eyes. I then told him\r\nthat Lord Kitchener had been down at Knole with the Sackvilles and had\r\nspent a whole day in taking blotting-paper impressions of the beautiful\r\nmouldings of the doors for his house at Broome. \"Does that make you feel\r\nsafe?\" he demanded; and then, pointing to a maidservant at the\r\nsideboard, he added, \"See that parlourmaid?--well, she's leaving;\r\nyesterday I spent two hours at Mrs. Hunt's registry office interviewing\r\nparlourmaids. Now, do you feel safe?\"\r\n\r\nHis return to the Admiralty brought him no happiness--save when he sent\r\nAdmiral Sturdee to sea to avenge the death of Admiral Cradock. He was\r\nperhaps too insistent on victory, a crushing and overwhelming victory,\r\nfor a Fleet on which hung the whole safety of the Allies, and a Fleet\r\nwhich had experienced the deadly power of the submarine. He was\r\ncertainly not too old for work. To the last, looking as if he was bowed\r\ndown to the point of exhaustion by his labours, he outworked all his\r\nsubordinates. As for energy, he would have hanged I know not how many\r\nadmirals if he had been in power during the last stages of the war.\r\n\r\nHis experience of Downing Street filled him up to the brim with contempt\r\nfor politicians. It was not so much their want of brains that troubled\r\nhim, but their total lack of character. Only here and there did he come\r\nacross a man who had the properties of leadership in even a minor\r\ndegree: for the most part they had no eyes for the horizon or for the\r\nhills whence cometh man's salvation; they were all ears, and those ears\r\nwere leaned to the ground to catch the rumbles of political emergencies.\r\n\r\nTo find men at the head of so great a nation with no courage in the\r\nheart, with no exaltation of captaincy in the soul, without even the\r\ndecency to make sacrifices for principle, made him bitterly\r\ncontemptuous. At first he could scarcely bridle his rage, but as years\r\nwent on he used to say that the politicians had deepened his faith in\r\nProvidence. God was surely looking after England or she would have\r\nperished years agone. In his old age he ceaselessly quoted the lines of\r\nWilliam Watson:\r\n\r\n  \"Time, and the Ocean, and some fostering star\r\n  In high cabal have made us what we are\";\r\n\r\nand damned the politician with all the vigour of the Old Testament\r\nvernacular.\r\n\r\nI have often listened to a minister's confidential gossip about Lord\r\nFisher; nothing in these interesting confidences struck me so much as\r\nthe self-satisfaction of the little minister in treating the man of\r\ndestiny as an amusing lunatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ASQUITH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RT. HON. HERBERT HENRY ASQUITH\r\n\r\n     Born at Morley, Yorkshire, 1852. Educ.: City of London School;\r\n     Balliol College, Oxford; gained 1st class, Lit.

ASQUITH\r\n\r\n     _\"Not to mention loss of time, the tone of their feelings is\r\n     lowered: they become less in earnest about those of their opinions\r\n     respecting which they must remain silent in the society they\r\n     frequent: they come to look upon their most elevated objects as\r\n     unpractical, or at least too remote from realization to be more\r\n     than a vision or a theory: and if, more fortunate than most, they\r\n     retain their higher principles unimpaired, yet with respect to the\r\n     persons and affairs of their own day, they insensibly adopt the\r\n     modes of feeling and judgment in which they can hope for sympathy\r\n     from the company they keep.\"_--JOHN STUART MILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing in Mr. Asquith's career is more striking than his fall from\r\npower: it was as if a pin had dropped.\r\n\r\nGreat men do not at any time fall in so ignominious a fashion, much less\r\nwhen the fate of a great empire is in the balance.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Mr. Asquith possesses all the appearance of greatness\r\nbut few of its elements. He has dignity of presence, an almost\r\nunrivalled mastery of language, a trenchant dialectic, a just and\r\nhonourable mind; but he is entirely without creative power and has\r\noutgrown that energy of moral earnestness which characterized the early\r\nyears of his political life.\r\n\r\nHe has never had an idea of his own. The \"diffused sagacity\" of his mind\r\nis derived from the wisdom of other men. He is a cistern and not a\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\nHis scholarship has made no difference to scholarship. His moral\r\nearnestness has made no difference to morality. He acquired scholarship\r\nby rote, politics by association, and morality by tradition. To none of\r\nthese things did he bring the fire of original passion. The force in his\r\nyouth was ambition, and the goal of his energy was success. No man ever\r\nlaboured harder to judge between the thoughts of conflicting schools;\r\nfew men so earnest for success ever laboured less to think for\r\nthemselves. He would have made a noble judge; he might have been a\r\npowerful statesman; he could never have been a great man as Mazzini,\r\nBismarck, and Gladstone were great men.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons for suspecting his moral qualities. When he allowed\r\nLord Haldane to resign from the Cabinet at the shout of a few ignorant\r\njournalists he sacrificed the oldest of his friends to political\r\nexigencies. This was bad enough; but what made it worse was the\r\nappearance of heroic courage he assumed in paddling to Lord Haldane's\r\nrescue long after the tide of abuse had fallen. During the time he\r\nshould have spoken to the whole nation, during the time he should have\r\nbeen standing sword in hand at the side of his friend, he was in\r\nnegotiation with Sir Edward Carson.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to say that he brought England into the war. England\r\ncarried Mr. Asquith into the war. The way in which politicians speak of\r\nMr. Asquith as having \"preserved the unity of the nation\" in August,\r\n1914, is index enough of the degraded condition of politics. A House of\r\nCommons that had hesitated an hour after the invasion of Belgium would\r\nhave been swept out of existence by the wrath and indignation of the\r\npeople. Mr. Asquith was the voice of England in that great moment of her\r\ndestiny, a great and sonorous voice, but by no means her heart. He kept\r\nfaction together at a moment when it was least possible for it to break\r\napart; but he did not lead the nation into war. It was largely because\r\nhe seemed to lack assurance that Lord Haldane was sacrificed. The Tories\r\nfelt that Mr. Asquith would not make war whole-heartedly: they looked\r\nabout for a scapegoat; Lord Haldane was chosen for this purpose by the\r\nstupidest of the Tory leaders; and the bewildered Prime Minister, with\r\nno mind of his own, and turning first to this counsellor and then to\r\nthat, sacrificed the most intellectual of modern War Ministers, called\r\nSir Edward Carson, to his side, and left the British war machine to Lord\r\nKitchener.\r\n\r\nWe must make allowance for the time. No minister in our lifetime was\r\nconfronted by such a gigantic menace. Moreover, the Cabinet was not\r\nunited. Mr. Asquith came out of that tremendous ordeal creditably, but\r\nnot, I think, as a great national hero. As for his conduct of the war,\r\nit was dutiful, painstaking, dignified, wise; but it lacked the\r\nimpression of a creative original mind. He did not so much direct policy\r\nand inspire a nation as keep a Cabinet together. One seemed to see in\r\nhim the decorative chairman of a board of directors rather than the\r\nliving spirit of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nWhen the historian comes to inquire into the trivial consequences of Mr.\r\nAsquith's fall from power he will be forced, I think, to lift that veil\r\nwhich Mr. Asquith has so jealously drawn across the privacy of his\r\ndomestic life. For although he ever lacked the essentials of greatness,\r\nMr. Asquith once possessed nearly all those qualities which make for\r\npowerful leadership. Indeed it was said in the early months of the war\r\nby the most able of his political opponents that it passed the wit of\r\nman to suggest any other statesman at that juncture for the office of\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\nHis judicial temperament helped him to compose differences and to find a\r\nworkable compromise. His personal character won the respect of men who\r\nare easily influenced by manner. There was something about him superior\r\nto a younger generation of politicians--a dignity, a reticence, a proud\r\nand solid self-respect. With the one exception of Mr. Alfred Spender, a\r\nman of honour and the noblest principles, he had no acquaintance with\r\njournalism. He never gave anybody the impression of being an\r\noffice-seeker, and there was no one in Parliament who took less pains to\r\nsecure popularity. Above all things, he never plotted behind closed\r\ndoors; never descended to treason against a rival.\r\n\r\nSearch as men may among the records of his public life they will fail to\r\ndiscover any adequate cause of his fall from power. He was diligent in\r\noffice; he took always the highest advice in every military dispute;\r\nsettled the chief difficulty at the War Office without offence to Lord\r\nKitchener; he gave full rein to the fiery energy of Mr. Lloyd George; he\r\nwas in earnest, but he was never excited; he was beset on every side,\r\nbut he never failed to maintain the best traditions of English public\r\nlife; he was trusted and respected by all save a clique. Even in the\r\nhumiliation of the Paisley campaign he was so noble a figure that the\r\nindulgence with which he appeared to regard the rather violent aid of a\r\nwitty daughter was accepted by the world as touchingly paternal--the old\r\nman did not so much lean upon the arm of his child as smile upon her\r\nhigh-spirited antics.\r\n\r\nOne must trespass upon the jealously guarded private life to discover\r\nthe true cause of his bewildering collapse. Mr. Asquith surrendered some\r\nyears ago the rigid Puritanism of early years to a domestic circle which\r\nwas fatal to the sources of his original power. Anyone who compares the\r\nphotographs of Mr. Asquith before and after the dawn of the twentieth\r\ncentury may see what I mean. In the earlier photographs his face is\r\nkeen, alert, powerful, austere; you will read in it the rigidity of his\r\nNonconformist upbringing, the seriousness of his Puritan inheritance,\r\nall the moral earnestness of a nobly ambitious character. In the later\r\nphotographs one is struck by an increasing expression of festivity, not\r\nby any means that beautiful radiance of the human spirit which in\r\nanother man was said to make his face at the age of seventy-two \"a\r\nthanksgiving for his former life and a love-letter to all mankind,\" but\r\nrather the expression of a mental chuckle, as though he had suddenly\r\nseen something to laugh at in the very character of the universe. The\r\nface has plumped and reddened, the light-coloured eye has acquired a\r\ntwinkle, the firm mouth has relaxed into a sportive smile. You can\r\nimagine him now capping a \"_mot_\" or laughing deeply at a daring jest;\r\nbut you cannot imagine him with profound and reverend anxiety striving\r\nlike a giant to make right, reason, and the will of God prevail.\r\n\r\nLike Mr. Lloyd George, his supplanter, he has lost the earnestness which\r\nbrought him to the seats of power. A domestic circle, brilliant with the\r\nmodern spirit and much occupied in sharpening the wits with epigram and\r\naudacity, has proved too much for his original stoicism. He has found\r\nrecreation in the modern spirit. After the day's work there has been\r\nnothing so diverting for him as the society of young people; chatter\r\nrather than conversation has been as it were prescribed for him, and\r\nwhen he should have been thinking or sleeping he has been playing cards.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to argue that this complete change from the worries of\r\nthe day's work has been right and proper, and that his health has been\r\nthe better for it; but physical well-being can be secured by other\r\nmeans, and no physical well-being is worth the loss of moral power.\r\nThere are some natures to whom easy-going means a descent. There are\r\nsome men, and those the strongest sons of nature, for whom the kindest\r\ncommandment is, \"Uphill all the way.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith, both by inheritance and temperament, was designed for a\r\nstrenuous life, a strenuous moral life. He was never intended for\r\nanything in the nature of a _flâneur_. If he had followed his star, if\r\nhe had rigorously pursued the path marked out for him by tradition and\r\nhis own earliest propensities, he might have been an unpleasant person\r\nfor a young ladies' tea-party and an unsympathetic person to a gathering\r\nof decadent artists; he might indeed have become as heavy as Cromwell\r\nand as inhuman as Milton; but he would never have fallen from Olympus\r\nwith the lightness of thistledown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD NORTHCLIFFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD NORTHCLIFFE, FIRST VISCOUNT (ALFRED CHARLES WILLIAM HARMSWORTH)\r\n\r\n     Born, 1865, in Dublin. Educ.: in Trade Schools; trained as a\r\n     book-seller, and worked in the establishment of George Newnes;\r\n     LL.D., Rochester Univ., U.S.A.; Proprietor of the London _Times,\r\n     Daily Mail_, and a number of other journals; Cr. Bart. in 1904;\r\n     Viscount, 1917; Chairman of the British War Mission to the United\r\n     States, 1917; Director of the Aerial Transport Committee, 1917;\r\n     Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries, 1918.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD NORTHCLIFFE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLORD NORTHCLIFFE\r\n\r\n     _\" ... We cannot say that they have a great nature, or strong, or\r\n     weak, or light; it is a swift and imperious imagination which\r\n     reigns with sovereign power over all their beings, which subjugates\r\n     their genius, and which prescribes for them in turn those fine\r\n     actions and those faults, those heights and those littlenesses,\r\n     those flights of enthusiasm and those fits of disgust, which we are\r\n     wrong in charging either with hypocrisy or\r\n     madness.\"_--VAUVENARGUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great surgeon tells me he has no doubt that Carlyle suffered all his\r\nlife from a duodenal ulcer. \"One may speculate,\" he says, \"on the\r\ndifference there would have been in his writings if he had undergone the\r\noperation which to-day is quite common.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark occurs to me when I think about Lord Northcliffe.\r\n\r\nThere is something wrong with his health. For a season he is almost\r\nboyish in high spirits, not only a charming and a most considerate host,\r\nbut a spirit animated by the kindliest, broadest, and cheerfullest\r\nsympathies. Then comes a period of darkness. He seems to imagine that he\r\nmay go blind, declares that he cannot eat this and that, shuts himself\r\nup from his friends, and feels the whole burden of the world pressing on\r\nhis soul.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to judge him as one would judge a perfectly healthy\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous thing in his character is its transilience. One is\r\naware in him of an anacoluthic quality, as if his mind suddenly stopped\r\nleaping in one direction to begin jumping in a quite contrary direction.\r\nIt cannot be said that his mind _works_ in any direction. It is not a\r\ntrained mind. It does not know how to think and cannot support the\r\nburden of trying to think. It springs at ideas and goes off with them in\r\nhaste too great for reflection. He drops these ideas when he sees an\r\nexcuse for another leap. Sequence to Lord Northcliffe is a synonym for\r\nmonotony. He has no _esprit de suite_. But he has leaps of real genius.\r\nAn admirable title for his biography would be, \"The Fits and Starts of a\r\nDiscontinuous Soul.\" There is something of St. Vitus in his psychology.\r\nYou might call him the Spring-Heeled Jack of Journalism.\r\n\r\nA story told of one of his journalists illustrates the difficulty of\r\ndealing with so uncertain a person. Lord Northcliffe invited this\r\njournalist, let us call him Mr. H., to luncheon. They approached the\r\nlift of Carmelite House, and Lord Northcliffe drew back to let his guest\r\nenter before him--he has excellent manners and, when he is a host, is\r\nscrupulously polite to the least of people in his employment. Mr. H.\r\napproached the lift, and raising his hat and making a profound bow to\r\nthe boy in charge of it, passed in before Lord Northcliffe. Nothing was\r\nsaid during the descent. On leaving the lift Mr. H. again raised his\r\nhat and bowed low to the boy. When they were out of earshot Lord\r\nNorthcliffe remonstrated with him on his behaviour. \"You shouldn't\r\njoke,\" he said, \"with these boys, it makes discipline difficult.\"\r\n\"Joke!\" exclaimed Mr. H., \"good heavens, I wasn't joking; how do I know\r\nthat to-morrow he will not be the editor of the _Daily Mail_?\"\r\n\r\nThis story has a real importance. It emphasizes a remarkable\r\ncharacteristic of Lord Northcliffe's variability. It emphasizes the\r\nromantic quality of his mind. Nothing would please him more than to\r\ndiscover in one of his office boys an editor for _The Times_. His own\r\nlife has given him almost a novelette's passion for romance. He lives in\r\nthat atmosphere. Few men I have known are so free from snobbishness or\r\nso indifferent to the petty conventions of society. The dull life of the\r\nworld is hateful to him. He would make not only the journalism of the\r\nsuburbs sensational, he would make the history of mankind a fairy-story.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand his power in the world. He is not the\r\ngreat organizer that people suppose; all the organization of his\r\nbusiness has been done by Lord Rothermere, a very able man of business;\r\nnor is he the inspirational genius one is so often asked to believe. Mr.\r\nKennedy Jones is largely responsible for the journalistic fortunes of\r\nLord Northcliffe.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to think that it is the romantic quality of his mind which\r\nis the source of his power. All the men about him are unimaginative\r\nrealists. He is the artist in command of the commercial mind, the poet\r\nflogging dull words into a kind of wild music. Mr. Kennedy Jones could\r\nhave started any of his papers, but he could never have imparted to them\r\nthat living spirit of the unexpected which has kept them so effectually\r\nfrom dulness. Carmelite House could give the news of the world without\r\nLord Northcliffe's help, but without his passion for the twists and\r\nturns of the fairy-story it could never have presented that news so that\r\nit catches the attention of all classes.\r\n\r\nI have never been conscious of greatness in Lord Northcliffe, but I have\r\nnever failed to feel in his mind something unusual and remarkable. He is\r\nnot an impressive person, but he is certainly an interesting person. One\r\nfeels that he has preserved by some magic of temperament, not to be\r\nanalyzed by the most skilful of psychologists, the spirit of boyhood.\r\nYou may notice this spirit quite visibly in his face. The years leave\r\nfew marks on his handsome countenance. He loves to frown and depress his\r\nlips before the camera, for, like a child, he loves to play at being\r\nsomebody else, and somebody else with him is Napoleon--I am sure that he\r\nchose the title of Northcliffe so that he might sign his notes with the\r\ninitial N--but when he is walking in a garden, dressed in white\r\nflannels, and looking as if he had just come from a Turkish bath, he has\r\nall the appearance of a youth. It is a tragedy that a smile so agreeable\r\nshould give way at times to a frown as black as midnight; that the\r\nfreshness of his complexion should yield to an almost jaundiced yellow;\r\nand that the fun and frolic of the spirit should flee away so suddenly\r\nand for such long periods before the witch of melancholy.\r\n\r\nOf his part in the history of the world no historian will be able to\r\nspeak with unqualified approval. His political purpose from beginning to\r\nend, I am entirely convinced, has been to serve what he conceives to be\r\nthe highest interests of his country. I regard him in the matter of\r\nintention as one of the most honourable and courageous men of the day.\r\nBut he is reckless in the means he employs to achieve his ends. I should\r\nsay he has no moral scruples in a fight, none at all; I doubt very much\r\nif he ever asks himself if anything is right or wrong. I should say that\r\nhe has only one question to ask of fate before he strips for a fight--is\r\nthis thing going to be Success or Failure?\r\n\r\nIn many matters of great importance he has been right, so right that we\r\nare apt to forget the number of times he has been wrong. Whether he may\r\nnot be charged in some measure at least with the guilt of the war,\r\nwhether he is not responsible for the great bitterness of international\r\nfeelings which characterized Europe during the last twenty years, is a\r\nquestion that must be left to the historian. But it is already apparent\r\nthat for want of balance and a moral continuity in his direction of\r\npolicy Lord Northcliffe has done nothing to elevate the public mind and\r\nmuch to degrade it. He has jumped from sensation to sensation. The\r\nopportunity for a fight has pleased him more than the object of the\r\nfight has inspired him. He has never seen in the great body of English\r\npublic opinion a spirit to be patiently and orderly educated towards\r\nnoble ideals, but rather a herd to be stampeded of a sudden in the\r\ndirection which he himself has as suddenly conceived to be the direction\r\nof success.\r\n\r\nThe true measure of his shortcomings may be best taken by seeing how a\r\nman exercising such enormous power, power repeated day by day, and\r\nalmost at every hour of the day, might have prepared the way for\r\ndisarmament and peace, might have modified the character of modern\r\ncivilization, might have made ostentation look like a crime, might have\r\nbrought capital and labour into a sensible partnership, and might have\r\ngiven to the moral ideals of the noblest sons of men if not an\r\nintellectual impulse at least a convincing advertisement.\r\n\r\nThe moral and intellectual condition of the world, a position from which\r\nonly a great spiritual palingenesis can deliver civilization, is a\r\ncharge on the sheet which Lord Northcliffe will have to answer at the\r\nseat of judgment. He has received the price of that condition in the\r\nmultitudinous pence of the people; consciously or unconsciously he has\r\ntraded on their ignorance, ministered to their vulgarities, and inflamed\r\nthe lowest and most corrupting of their passions: if they had had\r\nanother guide his purse would be empty.\r\n\r\nAll the same, it is the greatest mistake for his enemies to declare\r\nthat he is nothing better than a cynical egoist trading on the enormous\r\nignorance of the English middle-classes. He is a boy, full of adventure,\r\nfull of romance, and full of whims, seeing life as the finest fairy-tale\r\nin the world, and enjoying every incident that comes his way, whether it\r\nbe the bitterest and most cruel of fights or the opportunity for doing\r\nsomeone a romantic kindness.\r\n\r\nYou may see the boyishness of his nature in the devotion with which he\r\nthrew himself first into bicycling, then into motoring, and then into\r\nflying. He loves machinery. He loves every game which involves physical\r\nrisk and makes severe demands on courage. His love of England is not his\r\nlove of her merchants and workmen, but his love of her masculine youth.\r\n\r\nHe has been generosity itself to his brothers, with all of whom he does\r\nnot, unfortunately, get on as well as one could wish. The most beautiful\r\nthing in his life is the love he cherishes for his mother, and nothing\r\ndelights him so much as taking away her breath by acts of astonishing\r\ndevotion. A man so generous and so boyish may make grave mistakes, but\r\nhe cannot be a deliberately bad man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ARTHUR BALFOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RT. HON.

HON. ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMR. ARTHUR BALFOUR\r\n\r\n     _\"A sceptre once put into the hand, the grip is instinctive; and he\r\n     who is firmly seated in authority soon learns to think security and\r\n     not progress, the highest lesson of statecraft.\"_--J.R. LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the _Tales_ Crabbe introduces to us a young lady, Arabella by\r\nname, who read Berkeley, Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke and was such a prodigy\r\nof learning that she became the wonder of the fair town in which, as he\r\ntells us, she shone like a polished brilliant. From that town she\r\nreaped, and to that town she gave, renown:\r\n\r\n  And strangers coming, all were taught t'admire\r\n  The learned Lady, and the lofty Spire.\r\n\r\nOne feels that in Mr. Balfour there is something of both the learned\r\nLady and the lofty Spire. He is at once spinsterish and architectural. I\r\nmean that he is a very beautiful object to look at, and at the same time\r\na frustrated and perverse nature. Moreover his learning partakes of a\r\ndrawing-room character, while his loftiness dwindles away to a point\r\nwhich affords no foothold for the sons of man. One may look up to him\r\nnow and again, but a constant regard would be rewarded by nothing more\r\nserviceable to the admirer than a stiff neck. He points upward indeed,\r\nbut to follow his direction is to discover only the void of etheric\r\nvacancy. Like his learning, which may astonish the simple, but which\r\nhardly illuminates the student, his virtues leave one cold. Someone who\r\nknows him well said to me once, \"He is no Sir Galahad. Week-ending and\r\nLondon society have deteriorated his fibre.\"\r\n\r\nHe began life well, but he has slackness in his blood and no vital\r\nenthusiasm in his heart. His career has been a descent. He has taken\r\nthings--ethically and industrially--easily, too easily.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that Nature forgot to bestow upon him those domestic\r\nmotions of the heart which humanize the mind and beautify character, for\r\nin many ways he was fitted to play a great part in affairs of State and\r\nwith real emotion in his nature would have made an ideal leader of the\r\nnation during the struggle with Germany. He is a conspicuous example of\r\nthe value of sensibility, for lacking this one quality he has entirely\r\nfailed to reach the greatness to which his many gifts entitled him.\r\n\r\nFew men can be so charming: no man can be more impressive. His handsome\r\nappearance, his genial manner, his distinguished voice, his eagerness\r\nand playfulness in conversation, all contribute to an impression of\r\npersonality hardly equalled at the present time. He might easily pass\r\nfor the perfect ideal of the gentleman. In a certain set of society he\r\nremains to this day a veritable prince of men. And his tastes are pure,\r\nand his life is wholesome.\r\n\r\nA lady of my acquaintance was once praising to its mother a robust and\r\nhandsome infant who could boast a near relationship with Mr. Arthur\r\nBalfour. \"Yes,\" said the mother, with criticism in her eyes and voice,\r\n\"I think he is a nice child, but we rather fear he lacks the Balfourian\r\nmanner.\" Even in childhood!\r\n\r\nThis Balfourian manner, as I understand it, has its roots in an attitude\r\nof mind--an attitude of convinced superiority which insists in the first\r\nplace on complete detachment from the enthusiasms of the human race, and\r\nin the second place on keeping the vulgar world at arm's length.\r\n\r\nIt is an attitude of mind which a critic or a cynic might be justified\r\nin assuming, for it is the attitude of one who desires rather to observe\r\nthe world than to shoulder any of its burdens; but it is a posture of\r\nexceeding danger to anyone who lacks tenderness or sympathy, whatever\r\nhis purpose or office may be, for it tends to breed the most dangerous\r\nof all intellectual vices, that spirit of self-satisfaction which\r\nDostoievsky declares to be the infallible mark of an inferior mind.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Arthur Balfour this studied attitude of aloofness has been fatal,\r\nboth to his character and to his career. He has said nothing, written\r\nnothing, done nothing, which lives in the heart of his countrymen. To\r\nlook back upon his record is to see a desert, and a desert with no altar\r\nand with no monument, without even one tomb at which a friend might\r\nweep. One does not say of him, \"He nearly succeeded there,\" or \"What a\r\ntragedy that he turned from this to take up that\"; one does not feel for\r\nhim at any point in his career as one feels for Mr. George Wyndham or\r\neven for Lord Randolph Churchill; from its outset until now that career\r\nstretches before our eyes in a flat and uneventful plain of successful\r\nbut inglorious and ineffective self-seeking.\r\n\r\nThere is one signal characteristic of the Balfourian manner which is\r\nworthy of remark. It is an assumption in general company of a most\r\nurbane, nay, even a most cordial spirit. I have heard many people\r\ndeclare at a public reception that he is the most gracious of men, and\r\nseen many more retire from shaking his hand with a flush of pride on\r\ntheir faces as though Royalty had stooped to inquire after the measles\r\nof their youngest child. Such is ever the effect upon vulgar minds of\r\ngeniality in superiors: they love to be stooped to from the heights.\r\n\r\nBut this heartiness of manner is of the moment only, and for everybody;\r\nit manifests itself more personally in the circle of his intimates and\r\nis irresistible in week-end parties; but it disappears when Mr. Balfour\r\nretires into the shell of his private life and there deals with\r\nindividuals, particularly with dependents. It has no more to do with his\r\nspirit than his tail-coat and his white tie. Its remarkable impression\r\ncomes from its unexpectedness; its effect is the shock of surprise. In\r\npublic he is ready to shake the whole world by the hand, almost to pat\r\nit on the shoulder; but in private he is careful to see that the world\r\ndoes not enter even the remotest of his lodge gates.\r\n\r\n\"The truth about Arthur Balfour,\" said George Wyndham, \"is this: he\r\nknows there's been one ice-age, and he thinks there's going to be\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nLittle as the general public may suspect it, the charming, gracious, and\r\ncultured Mr. Balfour is the most egotistical of men, and a man who would\r\nmake almost any sacrifice to remain in office. It costs him nothing to\r\nserve under Mr. Lloyd George; it would have cost him almost his life to\r\nbe out of office during a period so exciting as that of the Great War.\r\nHe loves office more than anything this world can offer; neither in\r\nphilosophy nor music, literature nor science, has he ever been able to\r\nfind rest for his soul. It is profoundly instructive that a man with a\r\nreal talent for the noblest of those pursuits which make solitude\r\ndesirable and retirement an opportunity should be so restless and\r\ndissatisfied, even in old age, outside the doors of public life.\r\n\r\nThe most serious effect upon his character of this central selfishness\r\nmay be seen in his treatment of George Wyndham. Mr. Balfour has had only\r\none friend in his parliamentary life, Alfred Lyttelton, but George\r\nWyndham came nearer to his affections than any other man in the Unionist\r\nParty, and was at one time Mr. Balfour's devoted admirer. Nevertheless,\r\nin the hour of his tragedy, in the hour which broke his heart and\r\ndestroyed his career, Mr. Balfour, who should have championed him\r\nagainst the wolves of the Party, and might, I verily believe, have saved\r\nboth him and Ireland, turned away his face and rendered homage to\r\npolitical opportunism. Wyndham's grave and the present condition of\r\nIreland stand as sorrowful reminders of that unworthy act.\r\n\r\nWyndham was by no means a first-rate politician, but he was a sincere\r\nman, something too of a genius, and I think there was genuine\r\ninspiration in his method of solving the Irish question.\r\n\r\nThis incident reveals in Mr. Balfour a capacity for meanness which\r\nrather darkens his good qualities. It prevents one from believing that\r\nhis conduct has always been guided by noble and disinterested motives.\r\nThe historian might have said that although he mistook astuteness and\r\nadroitness in parliamentary debate for statesmanship, and although he\r\naccomplished nothing for the good of his country, he yet lent a certain\r\ndignity and nobleness to public life at a time when it was besieged by\r\nnew forces in democracy having no reverence for tradition and little\r\nrespect for good manners; but when the full truth of the Wyndham\r\nincident is related it will be difficult for the historian to avoid a\r\nsomewhat harsh judgment on Mr. Balfour's character.\r\n\r\nNor does the Wyndham incident stand alone. His treatment of Mr. Ritchie\r\nand Lord George Hamilton was very bad. Then there was the case of Joseph\r\nChamberlain, who had good reason never to forgive him. Some day Mr.\r\nAsquith (or will it be Mrs. Asquith) may tell the story of dealings with\r\nMr. Balfour which were not of a handsome character. The more these\r\nthings are revealed the worse I think it will be for Mr. Balfour's\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nBut such is the personal effect of the man that even those whom he has\r\ntreated badly never bring any public charge against him. With the\r\nexception of Mr. Asquith, and Joseph Chamberlain, all forgave him, and\r\neven sought to find excuses for his inexplicable lapse. But I am\r\ninclined to think that this indicates weakness on the part of the victim\r\nrather than grace on the part of the victimizer.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways in which his lack of sensibility manifests itself\r\nin an unpleasant fashion. He is so self-absorbed that he appears to be\r\nwholly unaware of those who minister to his comfort. Of his servants he\r\nnever knows the least detail, not even their names, and even a devoted\r\nsecretary who has served him faithfully for many years may find himself\r\ntreated almost as a stranger in a moment of need. I fear it must be said\r\nthat in financial matters Mr. Balfour is as close-fisted as any miser,\r\nalthough I believe that this meanness has its rise, not so much in\r\navariciousness as in a total incapacity to realize the importance of\r\nmoney to other people.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the whole history of philosophical thought is an\r\nattempt to separate the object and the subject. Mr. Balfour appears to\r\nhave made this separation complete. For him there is no object. His mind\r\nhas embraced his subjective self, and has not merely refused the\r\nfruitless effort of attempting to stand outside its functions in order\r\nto perceive its own perceptions, but, abandoning the unperceived\r\nperceptions and the inactive activities of ultimate reality, it has\r\ncanonized its own functions and deified its own subjective universe. So\r\ncomplete, indeed, is this separation that he can scarcely be called\r\nselfish, since for him there exists no objective field for the operation\r\nof unselfishness.\r\n\r\nI lament this self-absorption of Mr. Balfour as much as I lament in his\r\ncousin Lord Robert Cecil the lack of the fighting qualities of\r\nleadership. To no man of the Unionist Party after the death of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield and Lord Salisbury have more hopeful opportunities\r\npresented themselves for creative statesmanship. He might have settled\r\nthe Irish Question. He might have avoided the Boer War, in the conduct\r\nof which he behaved with real nobleness at the beginning. He might have\r\nsaved Germany from her own war-mongers. In any case he might have led\r\nthe Unionist Party towards construction and so have prevented the\r\nslap-dash methods at reform set going by Mr. Lloyd George after a long\r\nand irritating period of Tory pottering. For few men in modern times\r\nhave exercised so great a fascination over that curious and easily\r\nsatisfied body, the House of Commons, and no man in the public life of\r\nour times has enjoyed a more powerful prestige in the constituencies.\r\nIndeed, he stood for many years as the most dignified and honourable\r\nfigure in the public life of Great Britain, and his influence in\r\npolitics during the first part of that period was without serious\r\nrivalry.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, too, that in the days of \"bloody Balfour\" he\r\nwas not merely chivalrous, but even Quixotic, in taking upon himself the\r\nmistakes and misdoings of his subordinates in Ireland. He certainly had\r\nthe makings of a chivalrous figure, and perhaps even a great man. One\r\nthinks that he began his descent unconsciously, and that carelessness\r\nrather than any inherent badness led gradually to an egoism which has\r\nproved fatal to his powers and to his character.\r\n\r\nTo the self-absorbed, vision is impossible. Mr. Balfour, unable to\r\npenetrate the future, has lived from day to day, enjoying the game of\r\npolitics for the fun of confounding critics and managing colleagues,\r\nenjoying too the privilege and dignity of power, but never once feeling\r\nthe call of the future, or experiencing one genuine desire to leave the\r\nworld better than he found it. And now he ends his political career\r\nclinging to a decorative office under the leadership of Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his Gifford Lectures, after an argument which induced one\r\nof his listeners to say that he had _a stammer in his thoughts_, Mr.\r\nBalfour announced his faith in God. One may recall Pascal's exclamation,\r\n\"How far it is from believing in God to loving Him!\"\r\n\r\nI have always thought it significant of his true nature that Mr.\r\nBalfour should be one of the worst offenders in that unlovely Front\r\nBench habit of putting his feet up on the Clerk's table. The last time I\r\nwas in the House of Commons Mr. J.H. Thomas was lying back on the\r\nOpposition Front Bench with his legs in the air and his muddy boots\r\ncrossed on the table. The boorishness of this attitude struck my\r\ncompanion very sharply. But I pointed out to him that the difference\r\nbetween Mr. Thomas, the Labour member, and Mr. Balfour, the great\r\ngentleman, was merely a size in boots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD KITCHENER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD KITCHENER OF KHARTOUM\r\n\r\n     Born, 1846; entered Army, 1866; Colonel, 1899; Burmah Campaign,\r\n     1891; Viscount, 1914; Baron, 1914; Earl, 1914; Sec'y for War, 1914;\r\n     died, 1917.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD KITCHENER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLORD KITCHENER\r\n\r\n     _\"I never knew a man so fixed upon doing what he considered his\r\n     duty.\"_--CROKER PAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after he had taken his chair at the War Office, Lord Kitchener\r\nreceived a call from Mr. Lloyd George. The politician had come to urge\r\nthe appointment of denominational chaplains for all the various sects\r\nrepresented in the British Army.\r\n\r\nLord Kitchener was opposed to the idea, which seemed to him irregular,\r\nunnecessary, and expensive, involving a waste of transport, rations, and\r\nclerks' labour. But Mr. Lloyd George stuck to his sectarian guns, and\r\nwas so insistent, especially in respect of Presbyterians, that at last\r\nthe Secretary of State for War yielded in this one case. He took up his\r\npen rather grudgingly and growled out, \"Very well: you shall have a\r\nPresbyterian.\" Then one of his awkward smiles broke up the firmness of\r\nhis bucolic face. \"Let's see,\" he asked; \"Presbyterian?--how do you\r\nspell it?\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of his earliest adventures with politicians, and he ended\r\nit with a sly cut at unorthodoxy. A little later came another political\r\nexperience which afforded him real insight into this new world of Party\r\nfaction, one of those experiences not to be lightly dismissed with a\r\njest.\r\n\r\nHe discovered at the War Office that preparations had been made for just\r\nsuch an emergency as had now occurred. The thoughtfulness and\r\nthoroughness of this work struck him with surprise, and he inquired the\r\nname of its author. He was told that Lord Haldane had made these\r\npreparations. \"Haldane!\" he exclaimed; \"but isn't he the man who is\r\nbeing attacked by the newspapers?\"\r\n\r\nA chivalrous feeling which does not seem to have visited the bosoms of\r\nany of Lord Haldane's colleagues visited the bosom of this honest\r\nsoldier. Someone about him who had enjoyed personal relations with\r\nvarious editors was dispatched to one of the most offending editors\r\nconducting the campaign against Lord Haldane with the object of stopping\r\nthis infamous vendetta.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you say is true,\" replied this editor, \"and I regret the\r\nattack as much as Lord Kitchener does; but I have received my orders and\r\nthey come from so important a quarter that I dare not disobey them.\" He\r\ngave Lord Kitchener's emissary the name of a much respected leader of\r\nthe Unionist Party.\r\n\r\nThus early in his career at the War Office Lord Kitchener learnt that\r\nthe spirit of the public school does not operate in Westminster and that\r\npolitics are a dirty business.\r\n\r\nAt no time in his life was Lord Kitchener \"a racehorse amongst cows,\"\r\nas the Greeks put it, being, even in his greatest period, of a slow,\r\nheavy, and laborious turn of mind; but when he entered Mr. Asquith's\r\nCabinet he was at least an honest man amongst lawyers. He was a great\r\nman; wherever he sat, to borrow a useful phrase, was the head of the\r\ntable; but this greatness of his, not being the full greatness of a\r\ncomplete man, and having neither the support of a keen intellect nor the\r\nfoundations of a strong moral character, wilted in the atmosphere of\r\npolitics, and in the end left him with little but the frayed cloak of\r\nhis former reputation.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that his administration of the War Office was not a\r\nsuccess. In all important matters of strategy he shifted his ground from\r\nobstinacy to sulkiness, yielding where he should not have yielded at\r\nall, and yielding grudgingly where to yield without the whole heart was\r\nfatal to success: in the end he was among the drifters, \"something\r\nbetween a hindrance and a help,\" and the efforts to get rid of him were\r\nperhaps justified, although Mr. Asquith's policy of curtailing his\r\nautocracy on the occasions when he was abroad had the greater wisdom.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble to correct the popular idea of Lord Kitchener's\r\ncharacter beyond saying that he was the last man in the world to be\r\ncalled a machine, and that he solemnly distrusted the mechanism of all\r\norganizations. He was first and last an out-and-out individualist, a\r\nbeliever in men, a hater of all systems. As Sir Ian Hamilton has said,\r\nwherever he saw organization his first instinct was to smash it. I think\r\nhis autocracy at the War Office might have been of greater service to\r\nthe country if all the trained thinkers of the Army, that small body of\r\nbrilliant men, had not been in France. Even in his prime Lord Kitchener\r\nwas the most helpless of men without lieutenants he could trust to do\r\nhis bidding or to improve upon it in the doing.\r\n\r\nIt will better serve the main purpose of this book to suggest in what\r\nparticulars the real greatness of this once glorious and finally\r\npathetic figure came to suffer shipwreck at the hands of the\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nLord Kitchener's greatness was the indefinable greatness of personality.\r\nHe was not a clever man. He had no gifts of any kind. In the society of\r\nscholars he was mum and among the lovers of the beautiful he cut an\r\nawkward figure. At certain moments he had curious flashes of\r\ninspiration, but they came at long intervals and were seldom to be had\r\nin the day of drudgery, when his mind was not excited. On the whole his\r\nintelligence was of a dull order, plodding heavily through experience,\r\nmapping the surface of life rather than penetrating any of its\r\nmysteries, making slowly quite sure of one or two things rather than\r\ngrasping the whole problem at a stroke.\r\n\r\nBut there was one movement in his character which developed greatness\r\nand by its power brought him to wonderful success and great honour;\r\nthis was a deep, an unquestioning, a religious sense of duty.\r\n\r\nHe started life with a stubborn ambition. As he went along he felt the\r\nlightness of duty, and married his ambition to this Spartan virtue. He\r\nremained in most respects as selfish a man as ever lived, as selfish as\r\na greedy schoolboy; nevertheless by the power of his single virtue, to\r\nwhich he was faithful up to his last moments on this earth, he was able\r\nto sacrifice his absorbing self-interest to the national welfare even in\r\na political atmosphere which sickened him at every turn.\r\n\r\nYou may see what I mean by considering that while he longed for nothing\r\nso much in later life as the possession of Broome Park, and that while\r\nhis selfishness stopped hardly at anything to enrich that house with\r\npictures, china, and furniture, and that while he would shamelessly hint\r\nfor things in the houses of the people who were entertaining him, even\r\nin the houses of his own subordinates, until the weaker or the more\r\ntimorous gave him the object of his covetousness, nevertheless for the\r\nsake of his country he clung to the uncongenial chair in Whitehall, not\r\nmerely working like a cart-horse for what he considered to be his\r\nnation's good, but suffering without public complaint of any kind, and\r\nscarcely a private grumble, all the numerous humiliations that came his\r\nway either from his own colleagues in the Cabinet or from a powerful\r\nsection of the newspapers outside.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing from the late Mr. John Bonner, a most admirable\r\nartist in many fields, an amusing account of an interview with Lord\r\nKitchener which illustrates the Field-Marshal's passion for his Kentish\r\nhome, and also sheds a telling light on the æsthetic side of his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonner had been recommended to Lord Kitchener, who wanted amorini\r\nscattered about the leafy gardens at Broome. Drawings were made and\r\napproved: a few months afterwards the amorini were set up in the\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nSoon came a summons to the presence of the great man. Mr. Bonner found\r\nhim a terrible object in a terrible rage. In his late years, be it\r\nremembered, Lord Kitchener was not good to look upon. He appeared a\r\ncoarse, a top-heavy person; and in anger, his cross-eyes could be\r\npainfully disconcerting.\r\n\r\nLord Kitchener forgot that Mr. Bonner was not only an artist of a\r\nsingularly beautiful spirit, but a gentleman. He blazed at him. What did\r\nhe mean by sticking up those ridiculous little figures in Broome?--what\r\ndid he mean by it?--with an unpleasant reference to the account.\r\n\r\nThe poor artist, terribly affrighted, said that he thought Lord\r\nKitchener had seen his drawings and approved of them. \"Yes, the\r\ndrawings!--but you can't see the figures when they're up! What's the\r\ngood of something you can't see?\"\r\n\r\nThe great man, it appeared at last, wanted amorini the size of giants; a\r\nrather Rosherville taste.\r\n\r\n\"He had knowledge,\" said Lady Sackville, from whose beautiful house he\r\nborrowed many ideas for Broome, and would have liked to have carried off\r\nmany of its possessions, particularly a William the Fourth drum which he\r\nfound in his bedroom as a waste-paper receptacle; \"he had knowledge but\r\nno taste.\"\r\n\r\nHer daughter said to me on one occasion, \"Every chair he sits in becomes\r\na throne,\" referring to the atmosphere of power and dignity which\r\nsurrounded him.\r\n\r\nIt is instructive, I think, to remark how a single virtue passionately\r\nheld--held, I mean, with a religious sense of its seriousness--can carry\r\neven a second-class mind to genuine greatness, a greatness that can be\r\nfelt if not defined. In every sense of the word greatness, as we apply\r\nit to a saint, a poet, or a statesman, Lord Kitchener was a second-class\r\nand even a third-class person; but so driving was his sense of duty that\r\nit carried him to the very forefront of national life, and but for the\r\npolitical atmosphere in which he had to work for the last few years of\r\nhis distinguished service to the State he might have easily become one\r\nof the great and shining heroes of British history. He had no taste; but\r\nthe impression he made on those who had was the impression of a great\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHow was it that his greatness, that is to say his greatness of\r\npersonality, made so pitiable an end? What was lacking that this\r\nindubitable greatness should have been so easily brayed in the mortar of\r\npolitics?\r\n\r\nThe answer I think is this: a single virtue can bestow greatness, and\r\nthe greatness may never fail when it has time and space in which to\r\nexpress itself; but many virtues of intellect and character are\r\nnecessary when time is of the essence of the contract, and more\r\nespecially in a situation of shared responsibility.\r\n\r\nLord Kitchener knew many of his own failings. He was by no means a vain\r\nman. Indeed he suffered considerable pain from the knowledge that he was\r\nnot the tremendous person of the popular imagination. This knowledge\r\nrobbed him of self-assurance. He tried to live up to the legendary\r\nKitchener, and so long as he could find men as brave as himself, but of\r\nswifter and more adaptable intelligence, to do his bidding, he\r\nsucceeded: many of the public, indeed, believed in the legendary\r\nKitchener up to the day of his tragic death--death, that unmistakable\r\nreality, meeting him on a journey, the object of which was to impress\r\nRussia with the legendary Kitchener. But more and more, particularly in\r\nconsultation with the quick wits of politicians, he found it impossible\r\nto impersonate his reputation.\r\n\r\nI have been told by more than one Cabinet Minister that it was\r\nimpressive to see how the lightning intellects of Mr. Lloyd George and\r\nMr. Winston Churchill again and again reduced the gigantic soldier to a\r\nstupefied and sulking silence.\r\n\r\nA proposal would be made by a minister, and Mr. Asquith would turn to\r\nLord Kitchener for his opinion. Lord Kitchener would say, \"It's\r\nimpossible,\" and close his lips firmly. At this Mr. Lloyd George would\r\nattack him, pointing out the reasonableness of this proposal in swift\r\nand persuasive phrases. Lord Kitchener, shifting on his chair, would\r\nrepeat, \"It's impossible.\" Then in question after question Mr. Churchill\r\nwould ask why it was impossible. \"It's impossible,\" Lord Kitchener would\r\nmumble at the end of these questions. Finally, when nearly everybody had\r\nattempted to extract from him the reason for his refusal to countenance\r\nthis proposal, he would make an impatient side movement of his head,\r\nunfold his arms, bend over the papers on the table before him, and grunt\r\nout, sometimes with a boyish smile of relief, \"Oh, all right, have it\r\nyour own way.\"\r\n\r\nHe lacked almost every grace of the spirit. There was nothing amiable in\r\nhis character. Very few men liked him a great deal, and none I should\r\nsay loved him. I do not think he was brutal by nature, although his\r\nnature was not refined; but he cultivated a brutal manner. He had the\r\nhappiness of three or four friendships with cultivated and good women,\r\nbut the beautiful creature whom he loved hungrily and doggedly, and to\r\nwhom he proposed several times, could never bring herself to marry him.\r\nI think there was no holy of holies in his character, no sanctuaries for\r\nthe finer intimacies of human life. As Sainte-Beuve said of Rousseau,\r\n\"he has at times a little goître in his voice.\" One sees the fulness of\r\nhis limitations by comparing him with such great figures of Indian\r\nhistory as the Lawrences and Nicholson: in that comparison he shrinks\r\nat once to the dimensions of a colour-sergeant.\r\n\r\nBut in attempting to study a man of this nature, for our own learning,\r\nwe should rather observe how notable a victory he achieved in making so\r\nmuch of so little than vociferate that he was not this thing or that.\r\n\r\nHe began life with no gifts from the gods; it was not in his horoscope\r\nto be either a saint or a hero; no one was less likely to create\r\nenthusiasm or to become a legend; and yet by resolutely following the\r\nroad of duty, by earnestly and stubbornly striving to serve his\r\ncountry's interests, and by never for one moment considering in that\r\nservice the safety of his own life or the making of his own fortune,\r\nthis rough and ordinary man bred in himself a greatness which, magnified\r\nby the legend itself created, helped his country in one of the darkest\r\nhours, perhaps the very darkest, of its long history.\r\n\r\nOne could wish that behind this formidable greatness of personality\r\nthere had been greatness of mind, greatness of character, greatness of\r\nheart, so that he might have been capable of directing the whole war and\r\nholding the politicians in leash to the conclusion of a righteous peace.\r\nBut these things he lacked, and the end was what it was.\r\n\r\n\"Character,\" says Epicharmus, \"is destiny to man.\" Lord Kitchener, let\r\nus assert, was faithful to his destiny. And he was something more than\r\nfaithful, for he sanctified this loyalty to his own character by a\r\ndevotion to his country which was pure and incorruptible. Certainly he\r\ncan never be styled \"the son of Cronos and Double-dealing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD ROBERT CECIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD ROBERT CECIL\r\n\r\n(EDGAR ALGERNON CECIL)\r\n\r\n     Born, 1864. Educ.: at Eton and Oxford. Private Secretary to his\r\n     father, the late Marquis of Salisbury, 1886-88; called to the Bar,\r\n     1887; M.P. for East Marylebone, 1906-10; for Hitchin Division of\r\n     Herts, 1912; Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, 1915-16;\r\n     Assistant Secretary for Foreign Affairs, 1918; Manager of Blockade,\r\n     1916-18. Author of _Principles of Commercial Law_ and _Our National\r\n     Church_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD ROBERT CECIL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLORD ROBERT CECIL\r\n\r\n     _\"Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.\"_--EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a novelist take for his hero an educated gentleman who expresses\r\ncontempt for the licence and indecencies of modern life, it is ten to\r\none that the critics, who confess themselves on other occasions as sick\r\nof prurient tales, will pronounce this hero to be a prig. In like\r\nmanner, let a politician evince concern for the moral character of the\r\nnation and it is ten to one his colleagues in the House of Commons and\r\nhis critics in the Press, and everywhere the very men most in despair of\r\npolitics, will declare him to be a fanatic.\r\n\r\nThis has been the unfortunate fate of Lord Robert Cecil. He is regarded\r\nby his countrymen as unpractical. Men speak well of him, and confess\r\nwillingly that he is vastly superior in character and intellect to the\r\nruck of politicians, but nevertheless wind up their panegyrics with the\r\nregretful judgment that, alas, he is a fanatic.\r\n\r\nIt is a thousand pities, I think, that he is not a fanatic. It is for\r\nthe very reason he is not fanatical that his progress in politics has\r\nbeen in the suburbs of the second rank. He has every quality for the\r\nfirst rank, and for the foremost place in that rank, save the one urging\r\npassion of enthusiasm. It is a sense of humour, an engaging sense of\r\ndiffidence, a continual deviation towards a mild and gentle cynicism, it\r\nis this spirit--the very antithesis of a fanatical temper--which keeps\r\nhim from leadership.\r\n\r\nThe nation has reason on its side for suspecting Lord Robert Cecil. In\r\nthe mind of the British people nothing is more settled than the\r\nconviction that the conquering qualities of a great captain are courage\r\nand confidence. He has given no sign of these qualities. Nature, it\r\nwould seem, has fashioned him neither pachydermatous nor pugilistic. He\r\nappears upon the platform as a gentleman makes his entrance into a\r\ndrawing-room, not as a toreador leaps into the bull ring. He expresses\r\nhis opinions as a gentleman expresses his views at a dinner-table, not\r\nas an ale-house politician airs his dogmatisms in the tap-room. The very\r\nqualities which give such a grace and power to his personality, being\r\nspiritual qualities, prevent him from capturing the loud and grateful\r\nloyalty of a political party.\r\n\r\nNow, while a man like Mr. Lloyd George can only affirm his own essence\r\nby the exercise of what we may call brute force, and by making use of\r\nvulgar methods from which a person of Lord Robert Cecil's quality would\r\nnaturally shrink, it is nevertheless not at all necessary for a man of\r\nnoble character and greater power to employ the same means in order to\r\nearn the confidence of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nWhat is necessary in this case is not brute force but fanaticism, and by\r\nfanaticism I mean that spirit which in Cromwell induced Hume to call him\r\n\"this fanatical hypocrite,\" and which Burke adequately defined in saying\r\nthat when men are fanatically fond of an object _they will prefer it to\r\ntheir own peace_.\r\n\r\nLord Robert Cecil need not adopt the tricks of a mountebank to achieve\r\nleadership of the British nation, but he must contract so entire a faith\r\nin the sacred character of his mission that all the inhibiting\r\ndiffidencies of his modest nature will henceforth seem to him like the\r\nwhisperings of temptation. He must cease to watch the shifts of public\r\nopinion. He must cease merely to recommend the probable advantage of\r\nrather more idealism in the politics of Europe. He must act. He must\r\nlearn to know that a man cannot give a great idea to the world without\r\ngiving himself along with it. The cause must consume the person.\r\nIndividual peace must be sacrificed for world's peace.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the War Lord Robert Cecil perceived that the\r\nneed of the nation was not for a great political leader, but for a great\r\nmoral leader. He told me so with an unforgettable emphasis, well aware\r\nthat under the public show of our national life the heart of the British\r\npeople was famishing for such guidance. He numbered himself among those\r\nanxiously scanning the horizon for such a leader. He should have been\r\ninstead answering the inarticulate cry of the people for that leader.\r\n\r\nNo good man of my acquaintance is more powerfully convinced of the\r\ngoodness of British nature. He watches the British people with an\r\nabiding affection. He believes that they possess, even those of them who\r\nappear most degraded and sordid, the foundational virtues of Christian\r\ncharacter--a love of justice, an instinct for kindness, and faith in\r\ntruth. He knows that they are more capable than any other people in\r\nEurope of generous self-sacrifice, and that any absence of grace in\r\ntheir manner which must distress the superficial observer comes rather\r\nof a passion for honesty than a lack of beauty. And this knowledge of\r\nhis goes with the conviction that no man will ever appeal to the British\r\nnation in vain who bases his appeal on justice, fair play, and charity.\r\nWhat a nation to lead! What an inspiration for a true leader!\r\n\r\nHe is convinced that no moral appeal has ever been made to the British\r\npeople in vain. And yet he has never made that appeal. With grief and\r\nsorrow he watches the stampeding of the nation he so deeply admires into\r\nmurderous and indiscriminate hatred of our enemies in the late war. He\r\nsaw the majority of the British people's war-like mood degraded and\r\nvulgarized by the propaganda of hate. But he made no move to save the\r\nnational honour. The better part, and as I firmly believe the greater\r\npart, of the nation was waiting for moral leadership: particularly were\r\nthe young men of the nation who marched to death with the purest flame\r\nof patriotism in their hearts hungering for such leadership; but Lord\r\nRobert Cecil, the one man in Parliament who might have sounded that\r\nnote, was silent. The voice that should have made Britain's glory\r\narticulate, the voice that might have brought America into the War in\r\n1914 and rendered Germany from the outset a house divided against\r\nitself, was never heard. Lord Robert Cecil looked on, and Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge sprang into the prize-ring with his battle-cry of the knock-out\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nI wonder if even the sublimest humility can excuse so fatal a silence.\r\nGreat powers have surely great responsibilities.\r\n\r\nI remember speaking to Lord Robert on one occasion of the shooting of\r\nMiss Cavell--a brutal act which distressed him very deeply. I said I\r\nthought we weakened our case against Germany by speaking of that\r\natrocious act as a \"murder,\" since by the rules of war, as she herself\r\nconfessed, Miss Cavell incurred the penalty of death. He replied: \"What\r\nstrikes me as most serious in that act is not so much that the Germans\r\nshould think it no crime to shoot a woman, but that they should be\r\nwholly incapable of realizing how such an atrocious deed would shock the\r\nconscience of the world. They were surprised--think of it!--by the\r\nworld's indignation!\"\r\n\r\nIn this remark you may see how far deeper his reflections take him than\r\nwhat passes for reflection among the propagandists of hate. Abuse of\r\nGermany never occupied his mind, which was sorrowfully engaged in\r\nstriving to comprehend the spiritual conditions of the German people: he\r\nrealized, that is to say, that we were not fighting an enemy who could\r\nbe shouted down or made ashamed by abusive epithets, but that we were\r\nopposing a spirit whose anger and temper were entirely different from\r\nour own, and therefore a spirit which must be understood if we were to\r\nconquer it. It was not merely the armies of Germany which must be\r\ndefeated, it was the soul of Germany which had to be converted. He saw\r\nthis clearly: he never ceased to work to that end; but he failed to take\r\nthe nation into his confidence and the public never understood what he\r\nwas after. A fanatic would have left the nation in no doubt of his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then he has half let the nation see what was in his mind.\r\nFor example, he has taken those illuminating, those surely inspired,\r\nwords of Edith Cavell as the text for more than one address--_Patriotism\r\nis not enough_. But beautiful and convincing as these addresses have\r\nbeen, their spirit has always had the wistful and _piano_ tones of\r\nphilosophy, never the consuming fervour of fanaticism. He knows, as few\r\nother men know, that without a League of Nations the future of\r\ncivilization is in peril, even the future of the white races; but he has\r\nnever made the world feel genuine alarm for this danger or genuine\r\nenthusiasm for the sole means that can avert it. He has not preached\r\nthe League of Nations as a way of salvation; he has only recommended it\r\nas a legal tribunal.\r\n\r\nIt is apparently difficult for a politician, however statesmanlike his\r\nqualities, to realize that politics cannot be even divorced from\r\nmorality, much less to comprehend that morality is the very sinew of\r\npolitics, being in truth nothing more than the conscience of a nation\r\nstriving to express itself in State action. Because of this politics\r\nbecome degraded and sink to the lowest levels of a mere factional\r\nmanoeuvring for place. They engage the attention of the attorney, and\r\nearn nothing but the contempt of the wise. They become like the\r\nperversions of art in the hands of those who assert that art has nothing\r\nto do with morals; they interest only a handful of experts.\r\n\r\nBut a man like Lord Robert Cecil does surely apprehend that the essence\r\nof politics is morality and, therefore, his unwillingness to use moral\r\nweapons in the political arena is hard to understand. He debates where\r\nhe should appeal; he criticizes where he should denounce; and he accepts\r\na compromise where he should lead a revolt. He is also altogether too\r\ncivil for the rogues with whom he has to do.\r\n\r\nI remember being in the House of Commons on an afternoon when Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge was expected to make an important speech. Lord Robert Cecil sat\r\nin a corner seat on the back benches; his brother, Lord Hugh, occupied\r\nthe corner seat on the front bench below the gangway. During the Prime\r\nMinister's speech, which was a succession of small scoring points\r\nagainst the Labour Party delivered with that spirit of cocksureness\r\nwhich has grown with him in the last few years, I noticed Lord Robert\r\nmake a pencilled note on a slip of paper and pass it across the gangway\r\nwith a nod of his head toward Lord Hugh. I watched the journey of this\r\nlittle paper and watched to see its effect. Lord Hugh unfolded the slip\r\nof paper, read it, smiled very boyishly all over his face, and, folding\r\nit up again, slowly turned his head and looked back towards his brother.\r\nThe smile they exchanged was a Cecilian biography. One saw in the light\r\nof that instant and whole-hearted smile the danger of a keen sense of\r\nironical humour. Both these men have the making of creative fanatics; in\r\nboth of them there is an intense moral earnestness and in both great\r\nintellectual power; but nature has mixed up with these gifts, which were\r\nintended for mankind, a drollery of spirit, only amusing in the\r\nconfidence of private life which they have allowed to weaken their\r\nsincerities. Humanity may be thankful that St. Paul was without a sense\r\nof humour.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, as Minister of Blockade, Lord Robert Cecil rendered\r\nservices of the greatest magnitude to his countrymen: he kept Sweden out\r\nof the war when the Russian Foreign Office could hardly breathe for\r\nanxiety on this point, and at a time when many British newspapers were\r\ndoing their best to facilitate the great desire of Germany to march an\r\narmy through Sweden and Finland to the thus easily reached Russian\r\ncapital. His work, too, at the Peace Conference in Paris entitles him to\r\nthe gratitude of the nation: he kept the idea of the League of Nations\r\nalive in an atmosphere that was charged with war. He prevented these\r\nconferences from making \"a Peace to end Peace.\" But on the whole I feel\r\nthat he is rather the shadow of great statesmanship leaning diffidently\r\nover the shoulder of political brute force than the living spirit of\r\ngreat statesmanship leading the moral conscience of the world away from\r\nbarbarism towards nobler reason and less partial truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR.

HON. WINSTON CHURCHILL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMR. WINSTON CHURCHILL\r\n\r\n     _\"He was not free from that careless life-contemning desperation,\r\n     which sometimes belongs to forcible natures.... He was too heedless\r\n     of his good name and too blind to the truth that though right and\r\n     wrong may be near neighbours, yet the line that separates them is\r\n     of an awful sacredness.\"_--JOHN MORLEY (of Danton).\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Winston Churchill was one of its most interesting figures in the\r\nParliament which included Joseph Chamberlain, Charles Dilke, and George\r\nWyndham. With the fading exception of Mr. Lloyd George, he is easily the\r\nmost interesting figure in the present House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThere still clings to his career that element of great promise and\r\nunlimited uncertainty which from his first entrance into politics has\r\ninterested both the public and the House of Commons. He has disappointed\r\nhis admirers on several occasions, but not yet has he exhausted their\r\npatience or destroyed their hopes.\r\n\r\nHis intellectual gifts are considerable, his personal courage is of a\r\nquality that makes itself felt even in the bosom of hate, and he\r\npossesses in a unique degree the fighting qualities of the born\r\npolitician. No man is more difficult to shout down, and no man responds\r\nmore gratefully to opposition of the fiercer kind. If on several\r\noccasions he has disappointed his friends, also on several occasions he\r\nhas confounded his enemies.\r\n\r\nFrom his youth up Mr. Churchill has loved with all his heart, with all\r\nhis mind, with all his soul, and with all his strength, three\r\nthings--war, politics, and himself. He loved war for its dangers, he\r\nloves politics for the same reason, and himself he has always loved for\r\nthe knowledge that his mind is dangerous--dangerous to his enemies,\r\ndangerous to his friends, dangerous to himself. I can think of no man I\r\nhave ever met who would so quickly and so bitterly eat his heart out in\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\nHe was once asked if politics were more to him than any other pursuit of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\"Politics,\" he replied, \"are almost as exciting as war, and quite as\r\ndangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even with the new rifle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in war,\" he answered, \"you can only be killed once, but in\r\npolitics many times.\"\r\n\r\nUnhappily for himself, and perhaps for the nation, since he has many of\r\nthe qualities of real greatness, Mr. Churchill lacks the unifying spirit\r\nof _character_ which alone can master the discrepant or even\r\nantagonistic elements in a single mind, giving them not merely force,\r\nwhich is something, but direction, which is much more. He is a man of\r\ntruly brilliant gifts, but you cannot depend upon him. His love for\r\ndanger runs away with his discretion; his passion for adventure makes\r\nhim forget the importance of the goal. Politics may be as exciting and\r\nas dangerous as war, but in politics there is no V.C.\r\n\r\nI am not enamoured of the logic of consistency. It seems a rather\r\nludicrous proceeding for an impecunious young man to join a very\r\nstrictly political club with the idea in his mind that he will always be\r\nin favour of that particular party's programmes. Most of us, I think,\r\nwill agree that a man who never changes his opinion is a stupid person,\r\nand that one who boasts in grave and hoary age of his lifelong political\r\nconsistency is merely confessing that he has learnt nothing in the\r\nschool of experience. One sees the danger of this state of mind when he\r\nthinks of the theologians who burned men of science at the stake rather\r\nthan be false to their Christian dogmas.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, illogical and ridiculous as consistency may appear,\r\namounting in truth to nothing more than either inability to see the\r\nother side of an argument or a deliberate refusal to acknowledge an\r\nintellectual mistake, who can doubt that this quality of the mind\r\ncreates confidence? On the other hand, who can doubt that one who\r\nappears at this moment fighting on the left hand, and at the next moment\r\nfighting just as convincingly on the right, creates distrust in both\r\narmies?\r\n\r\nA newspaper which says at one time, \"France must be rolled in mud and\r\nblood, her colonies must be taken from her and given to Germany, she has\r\nno sense of honour\"; and at another time describes every German as a\r\nHun and hails France as the glory of civilization, does not encourage\r\nthe judicious reader to look for guidance in its editorial\r\npronouncements. But the newspaper which felt itself obliged to offer\r\nFrance a respectful admonition on one occasion and even to oppose French\r\npolicy with firmness and to express sympathy with the Germans might\r\nafterwards acclaim the great virtues of France and oppose itself to the\r\nGerman nation without any loss of our respect. In the one case the\r\ninconsistency arises from hysterical and immoral passion, in the other\r\nfrom a moral principle.\r\n\r\nThere is only one region in which consistency has the great sanction of\r\nan indubitable virtue: it is the region of moral character. A good man,\r\na man who makes us feel that righteousness is the breath of his\r\nnostrils, may change his intellectual opinions many times without losing\r\nour confidence, deeply as we may deplore his change. Goodness has an\r\neffect on men's minds which can hardly be exaggerated. Conduct is the\r\none sphere in which consistency has an absolute merit. A man whose whole\r\nlife is governed by moral principle has a constituency in the judgment\r\nof all honest people and may be said to represent mankind rather than a\r\nparty. Even a cynical opportunist like Lord Beaconsfield had to confess,\r\n\"So much more than the world imagines is done by personal influence.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill has not convinced the world of this possession. He carries\r\ngreat guns, but his navigation is uncertain, and the flag he flies is\r\nnot a symbol which stirs the blood. His effect on men is one of\r\ninterest and curiosity, not of admiration and loyalty. His power is the\r\npower of gifts, not character. Men watch him, but do not follow him. He\r\nbeguiles the reason, but never warms the emotions. You may see in him\r\nthe wonderful and lightning movements of the brain, but never the\r\nbeating of a steadfast heart. He has almost every gift of statesmanship,\r\nand yet, lacking the central force of the mind which gives strength and\r\npower to character, these gifts are for ever at the sport of\r\ncircumstance. His inconsistencies assume the appearance of shifts and\r\ndodges.\r\n\r\nThere is one particular way in which I think his inconsistencies have\r\nbeen dangerous to his career. They have brought him too often into\r\ninferior company.\r\n\r\nLord Northcliffe, with all his faults, is a man to whom statesmen may\r\nspeak their minds without loss of influence, but there are other\r\nnewspaper proprietors, financiers of commercialized journalism, with\r\nwhom a man of Mr. Churchill's power and position should hold no personal\r\nrelations. His is a mind which stands in need of constant communion with\r\nmen of culture and refinement. He knows the world by this time well\r\nenough, what he does not know are the heights. His character suffers, I\r\nthink, from association with second-rate people. He is too heedless of\r\nhis good name.\r\n\r\nIs it too late for him to acquire strength of character? His faults are\r\nchiefly the effects of a forcible and impetuous temperament: they may be\r\nexpected to diminish as age increases and experience moulds. But\r\ncharacter does not emerge out of the ashes of temperament. It is not to\r\nbe thought that Mr. Churchill is growing a character which will\r\npresently emerge and create devotion in his countrymen. Character for\r\nhim must lie in those very qualities which are now chiefly responsible\r\nfor his defects--his ardour, his affectibility, his vehemence, his\r\nimpetuous rashness, his unquestioned courage. One thing only can convert\r\nthose qualities into terms of character, it is a new direction.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps only one other man in the present House of Commons who\r\ncould do more than Mr. Churchill for his country and the world. All Mr.\r\nChurchill needs is the direction in his life of a great idea. He is a\r\nSaul on the way to Damascus. Let him swing clean away from that road of\r\ndestruction and he might well become Paul on his way to immortality.\r\nThis is to say, that to be saved from himself Mr. Churchill must be\r\ncarried away by enthusiasm for some great ideal, an ideal so much\r\ngreater than his own place in politics that he is willing to face death\r\nfor its triumph, even the many deaths of political life.\r\n\r\nAt present he is but playing with politics. Even in his most earnest\r\nmoments he is only \"in politics\" as a man is \"in business.\" But politics\r\nfor Mr. Churchill, if they are to make him, if they are to fulfil his\r\npromise, must be a religion. They must have nothing to do with Mr.\r\nChurchill. They must have everything to do with the salvation of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nIt is time, high time, he hitched his waggon to a star.\r\n\r\nEver since I first met him, when he was still in the twenties, Mr.\r\nChurchill has seemed to me one of the most pathetic and misunderstood\r\nfigures in public life. People have got it into their heads that he is a\r\nnoisy, shameless, truculent, and pushing person, a sort of intellectual\r\nHoratio Bottomley of the upper classes. Nothing could be further from\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill is one of the most sensitive of prominent politicians, and\r\nit is only by the exercise of his remarkable courage that he has\r\nmastered this element of nervousness. Ambition has driven him onward,\r\nand courage has carried him through, but more often than the public\r\nthinks he has suffered sharply in his progress. The impediment of\r\nspeech, which in his very nervous moments would almost make one think\r\nhis mouth was roofless, would have prevented many men from even\r\nattempting to enter public life; it has always been a handicap to Mr.\r\nChurchill, but he has never allowed it to stop his way, and I think it\r\nis significant both of his courage and the nervousness of his\r\ntemperament that while at the beginning of a speech this thickness of\r\nutterance is most noticeable, the speaker's pale face showing two\r\npatches of fiery pink in his cheeks, the utterance becomes almost clear,\r\nthe face shows no sign of self-consciousness, directly he has\r\nestablished sympathy with his audience. It is interesting to notice an\r\naccent of brutality in his speaking, so different from the suave and\r\ncharming tones of Mr. Balfour; this accent of brutality, however, is\r\nnot the note of a brutal character, but of a highly strung temperament\r\nfighting its own sensibilities for mastery of its own mind. Mr.\r\nChurchill is more often fighting himself than his enemies.\r\n\r\nHis health has been against him: his heart and his lungs have not given\r\nhim the support he needs for his adventurous and stormy career. At\r\ntimes, when every man's hand has seemed to be against him, he has had to\r\nfight desperately with both body and mind to keep his place in the\r\nfiring line. Some of his friends have seen him in a state of real\r\nweakness, particularly of physical weakness, and for myself I have never\r\nonce found him in a truculent or self-satisfied frame of mind. I believe\r\nhe is at heart a modest man, and I am quite certain he is a delicate and\r\na suffering man. But for the devotion of his wife I think he could not\r\nhave held his place so long.\r\n\r\nFate, too, has opposed him. His enemies are never tired of shouting the\r\ntwo names of Antwerp and Gallipoli. They are convenient terms of abuse:\r\nI suppose they would have destroyed most politicians; certainly they are\r\nmore deadly than such a phrase as \"spiritual home,\" for although the\r\nworld may be ignorant of the fact, every honest, educated man must\r\nacknowledge a debt of gratitude to the thinkers of ancient Germany,\r\nwhile to be associated with operations which involve the suffering, the\r\ndeath, and the defeat of British troops is in every way more fatal to\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, both these strokes of military strategy were sound in\r\nconception. I doubt indeed if the military historian of the future, with\r\nall the documents before him, will not chiefly condemn the Allies for\r\ntheir initial failure to make Antwerp a sea-fed menace to the back of\r\nthe German Armies; while even in our own day no one doubts that if Lord\r\nKitchener, in one of his obstinate moods, had not refused to send more\r\ndivisions to Gallipoli we should have taken Constantinople. The fault of\r\nthose operations lay not in attempting them but in not adequately\r\nsupporting them.\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill has had bad luck in these matters, but even here it is the\r\nlack of character which has served him most ill. He never impressed Lord\r\nKitchener as a man of power, although that sullen temperament grew in\r\nthe end to feel an amused affection for him. He did excellent work at\r\nthe Admiralty, work of the highest kind both before and at the outbreak\r\nof war, but his colleagues in the Cabinet never realized the importance\r\nof this work, judging it merely as \"one of Winston's new crazes,\"\r\nMinisters speak of him in their confidences with a certain amount of\r\naffection, but never with real respect. Many of them, of course, fear\r\nhim, for he is a merciless critic, and has an element of something very\r\nlike cruelty in his nature; but even those who do not fear him, or on\r\nthe whole rather like him, will never tell you that he is a man to whom\r\nthey turn in their difficulties, or a man to whom the whole Cabinet\r\nlooks for inspiration.\r\n\r\nGeneral William Booth of the Salvation Army once told Mr. Churchill\r\nthat he stood in need of \"conversion,\" That old man was a notable judge\r\nof character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD HALDANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD HALDANE\r\n\r\n     The Rt. Hon. Richard Burdon Haldane was born in 1856. Graduate of\r\n     Edinburgh University; Professor of Philosophy, St. Andrew's\r\n     University; Barrister, 1879; Q.C., 1890; created 1st Viscount,\r\n     1911; M.P. from Haddingtonshire, 1885-1911; Sec'y for War, 1905-12;\r\n     Rector of Edinburgh Univ.; Chancellor, Univ. of Bristol; Author of\r\n     various philosophical works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RT. HON. RICHARD BURDON HALDANE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nLORD HALDANE\r\n\r\n     _\"He is Attic in the sense that he has no bombast, and does not\r\n     strive after affect, and that he can speak interestingly on many\r\n     subjects 'without raising his voice.'\"_--GILBERT MURRAY (on\r\n     Xenophon).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf for nothing else, the nation owes Lord Haldane a debt of gratitude\r\nfor the example he has given it in behaviour. No man so basely deserted\r\nby his colleagues and so scandalously traduced by his opponents ever\r\nfaced the world with a greater calm or a more untroubled smile.\r\n\r\nLessing said of grief in sculpture that it may writhe but it must not\r\nscream. Lord Haldane has not even writhed. When a member of the House of\r\nLords asked him what he proposed doing with the two sacks crammed full\r\nof abusive letters addressed to him there by correspondents who thus\r\nobeyed a vulgar editor's suggestion, Lord Haldane replied with very good\r\nhumour, \"I have an oyster-knife in my kitchen and an excellent\r\nscullery-maid in my establishment: I shall see only my personal\r\nletters.\"\r\n\r\nIn the darkest hour of his martyrdom, when the oldest and staunchest of\r\nhis political friends maintained an absolute silence, he gave no sign of\r\nsuffering and uttered no single word either of surprise or bitterness.\r\nHe seemed to some of us in those days almost wanting in sensibility,\r\nalmost inhuman in his serenity. Newspaper articles which made most of us\r\neither wince or explode with anger did nothing more to the subject of\r\ntheir vilification than to set him off laughing--a comfortable,\r\nsoft-sounding, and enjoying laughter which brought a light into his face\r\nand gently shook his considerable shoulders. He loved to produce at\r\nthose moments the encomiums pronounced on his work at the War Office by\r\nthose very newspapers only a few years before at the hour of his\r\ntriumphant retirement.\r\n\r\nThis tranquillity of spirit owed nothing to an unimpressionable mind or\r\na thick skin. One came to see that it was actually that miracle of\r\npsychology, a philosophic temperament in action. I believe he could have\r\nthe toothache without a grimace. He has not only studied philosophy, he\r\nhas become a philosopher, and not merely a philosopher in theory but a\r\nphilosopher in soul--a practising philosopher. He might stagger for a\r\nmoment under the shock of a tremendous sorrow to one whom he loved, but\r\nnot all the shovings of all the halfpenny editors of our commercialized\r\njournalism, not even the most contemptible desertion of his friends,\r\ncould move his equilibrium by a hair's breadth.\r\n\r\nAfter the noble tributes paid to him by Lord Haig and Lord French I need\r\nnot trouble the reader by dealing with the accusations brought against\r\nthe greatest of our War Ministers by the gutter-press or by the baser\r\nkind of politicians. It is now acknowledged in all circles outside of\r\nBedlam that Lord Haldane prepared a perfect instrument of war which,\r\nshot like an arrow from its bow, saved the world from a German victory,\r\nand among the intellectual soldiers it is generally held that if France\r\nand Russia had been as well prepared to fulfil their engagements as we\r\nwere to fulfil ours the war would have ended in an almost immediate\r\nvictory for the Allies.[2]\r\n\r\nIt will be more instructive to ask how a man who never made an enemy in\r\nhis life, and for whom many of our greatest men have a deep affection,\r\ncame of a sudden to be the target of such general and overwhelming\r\nabuse. I think I can do something to clear up this mystery.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw that the great conflict was inevitable, Lord Haldane\r\nsuggested to Mr. Asquith, then acting as War Secretary, that he should\r\ngo down to the War Office, where he was still well known and very\r\npopular with the intellectual generals, and mobilize his own machine for\r\nwar. The harassed and overburdened Mr. Asquith gratefully accepted this\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Lord Haldane went down to the War Office, and knowing that\r\nspeed was the one thing to save us from a German avalanche, began to\r\nmobilize the Expeditionary Force. Some of the generals were alarmed. War\r\nwas not yet declared. The cost of mobilization ran into millions.\r\nSuppose war did not come after all, how were those millions to be met?\r\nLord Haldane brushed aside every consideration of this kind.\r\nMobilization was to be pushed on, cost what it might. He had not studied\r\nhis Moltke to no profit.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the War Office that same day, after having mobilized the\r\nBritish Army, he went across to the Foreign Office and was there stopped\r\nby a certain soldier who asked him how many divisions he was sending to\r\nFrance. Lord Haldane very naturally rebuked this person for asking such\r\na question, telling him that war was not yet declared and that therefore\r\nperhaps no divisions at all would go to France.\r\n\r\nNever was a just reproof more fatal to him who administered it.\r\n\r\nI believe this soldier went straight off to an important Civil Servant\r\nwith the sensational news that Lord Haldane was holding back the\r\nExpeditionary Force, and afterwards carried the same false news to one\r\nof the most violent anti-German publicists in London, a frenzied person\r\nwho enjoys nevertheless a certain power in Unionist circles. In a few\r\nhours it was all over London that the Liberals were going to desert\r\nFrance, that Lord Haldane, a friend of the German Kaiser, had got back\r\nto the War Office, and that he was preventing mobilization.\r\n\r\nI am quite willing to believe that the snubbed soldier honestly thought\r\nhe was spreading a true story: I am sure that the frenzied publicist\r\nbelieved this story with all the lunatic fervour of his utterly\r\nuntrained and utterly intemperate mind; but what I cannot bring myself\r\nto believe for a moment is that the Unionist statesman to whom this\r\nstory was taken, and who there and then gave orders for a campaign\r\nagainst Lord Haldane, was inspired by any motive less immoral, less\r\ncynical, and less disgraceful to a man of honour than a desire for\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nHe saw the opportunity of discrediting the Liberal Government through\r\nLord Haldane and took it. The Cabinet was to fall under suspicion\r\nbecause one of its members could be accused of pro-Germanism. Lord\r\nHaldane, against whom his friend Lord Morley now brings the sorrowful\r\ncharge that he was responsible for the war; Lord Haldane, against whom\r\nall the German writers have brought charges of stealing their War Office\r\nsecrets and of defeating their diplomacy, was to be called a\r\npro-German--a man actually doing Germany's work in the British War\r\nOffice. And this for a Party purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Balfour, by nature the most selfish of men and also an\r\nintemperate lover of office, would never have stooped to such dishonour;\r\nbut among the leaders of the Unionist Party there was to be found a man\r\nwho saw in a lie the opportunity for a Party advantage and took it.\r\n\r\nIn these matters a statesman need not show himself. A word to one or two\r\nnewspaper proprietors is sufficient. Nor need he hunt up any arguments.\r\nThe newspaper reporter will not leave a dust-bin unsearched. One word,\r\nnay, the merest hint is sufficient. So stupid, so supine, is the public,\r\nthat Fleet Street will undertake to destroy a man's reputation in a week\r\nor two.\r\n\r\nIt was in this fashion that Lord Haldane fell.\r\n\r\n     \"You have killed me,\" says Socrates, \"because you thought to escape\r\n     from giving an account of your lives. But you will be disappointed.\r\n     There are others to convict you, accusers whom I held back when you\r\n     knew it not, they will be harsher inasmuch as they are younger, and\r\n     you will wince the more.\"\r\n\r\nOne day the full truth of this scandalous story will be told, and the\r\nhistorian will then pronounce a judgment which will leave an indelible\r\nstain on the reputation of some who with a guilty conscience now sun\r\nthemselves in the prosperity of public approval. Their children will not\r\nread that judgment without bitter shame.\r\n\r\nI condemn in this matter not only the man who gave the order for calumny\r\nand slander to set to work but, first, the friends of Lord Haldane who\r\nkept silence, and, second, the democracy of these islands which allowed\r\nitself to be deceived and exploited by the lowest kind of newspapers.\r\n\r\nWhy was Sir Edward Grey silent? He was living in Lord Haldane's house\r\nat the time, and, agonizing over the abhorrent prospect of European\r\nslaughter and striving to the point of a nervous collapse to avert this\r\ncalamity, was devotedly served and strengthened by his host. Why was he\r\nsilent?\r\n\r\nWhy was Mr. Asquith silent? He knew that Lord Haldane had delivered the\r\nWar Office from chaos and had given to this country for the first time\r\nin its history a coherent and brilliantly efficient weapon for this very\r\npurpose of a war with Germany. He spoke when it was too late. Why did he\r\nnot speak when the hounds were in full cry?\r\n\r\nAnd why were Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston Churchill silent? Could\r\nthey not have told the nation that they had grudged Lord Haldane his\r\nArmy estimates, and that they had even suggested another and less\r\nexpensive scheme of national defence--a scheme that was actually\r\nexamined by the War Office experts and condemned?\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Lloyd George look back. If he had had his way with the War\r\nOffice could Germany have been stopped from reaching Paris and seizing\r\nthe Channel ports? Moreover, if he had had his way, could he himself\r\nhave hoped to escape hanging on a lamp-post? Is it not true to say that\r\nin saving France from an overwhelming and almost immediate destruction\r\nthe British Expeditionary Force also saved his neck, the neck of Mr.\r\nWinston Churchill, and the necks of all the Cabinet? But if this is so,\r\nand his own conscience shall be the judge, how is it that he said no\r\nword to the nation which might have saved Lord Haldane from martyrdom?\r\n\r\nThe nation, I think, does not know what it loses in allowing its\r\njudgment to be stampeded by unconscionable journalism. Lord Haldane is\r\nno political dilettante. Few men in modern times have brought to\r\npolitics a mind so trained in right thinking, or a spirit so full of\r\nthat impressive quality, as Morley calls it, the presentiment of the\r\neve: \"a feeling of the difficulties and interests that will engage and\r\ndistract mankind on the morrow.\" Long ago he foresaw the need in our\r\nindustrial life of the scientific spirit, and in our democracy of a\r\ndeeper and more profitable education. \"Look at Scotland, the best\r\neducated nation; and at Ireland, the worst!\" For these things he\r\nprepared. Long ago, too, he thought out a better and a complete system\r\nof Cabinet government. Long ago he had seen that the enmity between\r\nCapital and Labour must be brought to an end and an entirely new\r\nrelation brought into existence, identifying the prosperity of the one\r\nwith the other. For this, too, he had a scheme. These things were the\r\nchief concern of his life, and only for these things did he remain in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe nation would have been in a healthier condition if Lord Haldane's\r\nreasoned policy had been acted upon and Mr. Lloyd George's talent for\r\noratory had been employed to explain that reasoned policy to the less\r\neducated sections of the public, instead of used to arouse an angry\r\nopposition to the unreasoned and disconnected reforms of his own\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nBut what a topsy-turvy world! Mr. Lloyd George is \"the man who won the\r\nwar,\" he who did nothing to prepare for it, and suggested some things\r\nthat might have made it difficult to be won; while Lord Haldane, who did\r\nprepare for it, and whose work did save the whole world, is cast out of\r\noffice. And when the war is won, and Lord Haldane's position has been\r\npublicly and nobly vindicated by Lord Haig, Mr. Lloyd George as Prime\r\nMinister of England has a portfolio for Mr. Austen Chamberlain and\r\nanother for Dr. Macnamara, but none for this man to whom more than to\r\nany other politician he owes his place and perhaps his life.\r\n\r\nLord Haldane is not what Prodicus used to call \"a Boundary Stone, half\r\nphilosopher and half practical statesman.\" His philosophy is his\r\nstatesmanship, and his statesmanship is his philosophy. He has brought\r\nto the study of human life a profound mind and a trained vision. His\r\nsearch after truth has destroyed in him all pettiness of personal\r\nambition. He desires, because he regards it as the highest kind of life,\r\nto further the work of creative evolution, to be always on the side of\r\nspiritual forces, and never to be deceived by transitory materialism.\r\nDemocracy has need of these qualities, and a great empire without such\r\nqualities in its statesmen can hardly endure the test of time.\r\n\r\nHis faults are a too generous confidence in the good sense of democracy\r\nand a lack of impassioned energy. He is too much a thinker, too little a\r\nwarrior. Unhappily he is not an effective speaker, and his writing is\r\nnot always as clear as his ideas. He is at his best in conversation with\r\nmen whom he likes.\r\n\r\nHis activity is enormous, but it is the activity of the scholar. He\r\nworks far into the night, takes little or no exercise, and avoids \"that\r\ndance of mimes\"--the life of society. By hard reading he keeps himself\r\nabreast of knowledge in almost every one of its multitudinous\r\ndepartments and will go a long journey to hear a scientific lecture or\r\nto take part in a philosophical discussion. He is the friend of\r\nphilosophers, theologians, men of science, men of letters, and many a\r\nhumble working man. He was never privately deserted in the long months\r\nof his martyrdom. His charming London house, so refined and so dignified\r\nin its simplicity, was the frequent meeting-place of many even in those\r\nbad days when the door outside was daubed with paint, the windows\r\nbroken, and a police-man stood on guard. A few of us wished he took his\r\nill-treatment with a fiercer spirit; but looking back now I think that\r\neven the youngest of us perceives that he was unconsciously teaching us\r\nby his behaviour one of the noblest lessons to be learned in the school\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nLet his fate teach democracy that when it has found a leader whom it can\r\ntrust, it must be prepared to fight for him as well as to follow him. No\r\nstatesman is safe from the calumny of newspapers, and no statesman\r\nviolently and persistently attacked in a crisis can depend upon the\r\nloyalty of his colleagues. It is not in our politics as it is in our\r\ngames.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] It is well known that Lord Haig regards Lord Haldane as the greatest\r\nSecretary of State for War that England ever had; he has expressed his\r\ngratitude again and again for the manner in which Lord Haldane organized\r\nthe military forces of Great Britain for a war on the Continent. Lord\r\nFrench has said: \"He got nothing but calumny and abuse; but the reward\r\nto such a man does not come in the ordinary way. I had proved the value\r\nof his great work and that is all the reward he ever wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD RHONDDA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD RHONDDA OF LLANWERN (DAVID ALFRED THOMAS MACKWORTH)\r\n\r\n     First Baron, 1916. Born, in Aberdare, Wales, 1856; died, 1919.\r\n     Educated with tutors, and later at Caius College, Cambridge;\r\n     Scholar also, of Jesus; President South Wales Liberal Federation,\r\n     1893-97; M.P. for Merthyr, 1888-1910; for Cardiff, 1910; Food\r\n     Controller, 1917-1919.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD RHONDDA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLORD RHONDDA\r\n\r\n     _\"Whereof what better witness can ye expect I should produce than\r\n     one of your own now sitting in Parliament.\"_--MILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Merry Passages and Jests_ of old Sir Nicholas Lestrange record\r\nis made of the following witty definition: \"Edm. Gurney used to say that\r\na mathematitian is like one that goes to markett to buy an axe to break\r\nan egg.\"\r\n\r\nThis perhaps had been the fate of Lord Rhondda, for he was by nature of\r\na true mathematical turn, had not the circumstances of his economic life\r\nforced him to apply this natural tendency to the practical affairs of\r\ncommerce. But nature herself had given him with this aptitude for\r\nmathematics another quality which must eventually, one would suppose,\r\nhave saved him from the unfruitful fate of a theorist--he was a man of\r\nrare imagination. And so this mathematician, who was also a poet,\r\nbrought a unique mind to the affairs of commerce and there scored a\r\nsuccess which attracted attention in both hemispheres.\r\n\r\nI do not know a better example to illustrate the main thesis of this\r\nbook than the case of Lord Rhondda. No doubt the case of a greater man,\r\nLord Leverhulme, would lend itself to a far stronger illustration of\r\nthat thesis, but, unfortunately for my argument and for the nation, Lord\r\nLeverhulme has never had an opportunity of vindicating in office those\r\nqualities which the House of Commons neglected or overlooked during the\r\nyears in which, like Lord Rhondda, he sat humbly on its back benches.\r\n\r\nFor the best part of his manhood Lord Rhondda was a political failure.\r\nThe House of Commons, which prides itself on its judgment of men,\r\ntreated him as a person of no importance. He represented one of the\r\nlargest industrial constituencies in the country, was always returned by\r\nan overwhelming majority, and was known to be in his own district an\r\nadministrator of far-reaching talent; but because he could not speak\r\neffectually, and because the House of Commons--that most self-satisfied\r\nassembly of mediocrities--did not take to him, he was never offered by\r\nhis political leaders during all the long years of his patient service\r\neven an under-secretaryship.\r\n\r\nThis was the man who saved the nation from one of its greatest perils\r\nduring perhaps the most critical period of the war.\r\n\r\nAs one examines Lord Rhondda's administration of the Ministry of Food\r\none discovers an interesting and surely an important fact in the\r\npsychology of our public life.\r\n\r\nHis triumph, which was one of the greatest in the war, lay almost\r\nentirely in the region of personality. For his gravest difficulties were\r\nnot so much in the office of the Ministry as in the great and grumbling\r\nworld outside, where toiling men and women stood outside provision shops\r\nfor hours in the rain and cold only to be told in the vast majority of\r\ncases when their turn came that supplies were exhausted for that day.\r\n\r\nBy the power of his imagination Lord Rhondda saw that the first step\r\ntowards saving a very perilous situation was to convince this vast world\r\nof seething discontent that absolute justice should characterize the\r\nadministration of his office. To this end, satisfied that those about\r\nhim were men of devoted zeal and real talent, he set himself to the\r\ncreation of a public opinion favourable to the discharge of his duties.\r\nAnd by a stroke of inspiration he saw that to achieve this tranquillity\r\nof the public mind he must give his own personality to the world. His\r\ncharacter must become a public possession. A man, and not an office,\r\nmust stand for Food Control. The instinct of the Briton for justice and\r\nfair play must receive assurance from a moral personality.\r\n\r\nTherefore no member of the Government was more accessible, or more ready\r\nto be interviewed and photographed, than the Food Controller. It was not\r\nvanity, but foreseeing statesmanship, which opened his door to the\r\nhumblest newspaper reporter who visited the Ministry. His personality--a\r\nmoral, just, fearless, and confident personality--had to be conveyed to\r\nthe mind of the public, and every interview he gave to the Press had\r\nthis important objective for its reason. He saw the morals of an\r\neconomic situation, and he solved those economics very largely by making\r\na moral impression on the public mind.\r\n\r\nThe work of his office was carried to victory by Sir William Beveridge,\r\nCaptain Tallents, Professor Gonner, and other very able men in charge of\r\nrationing; but this work must have failed had it not been for public\r\nconfidence in Lord Rhondda's integrity; and, moreover, Lord Rhondda's\r\ncharacter played no small part in firing that work with a zeal and\r\npassion which were excelled by no other department of public service.\r\nMen not only worked hard for him, they worked for him affectionately.\r\n\r\nHis choice of Mr. J.H. Clynes was inspired by the same idea. He had\r\nheard this labour member speak, and had been impressed by the moral\r\nqualities of his oratory; he knew that in choosing him to represent the\r\nFood Ministry in the House of Commons he might be sure of the confidence\r\nof Labour, both there and in the circles of trade unionism. He was not\r\ndeceived. Mr. Clynes was the most loyal and impressive of lieutenants,\r\nwho, on one occasion in particular, saved a difficult situation.\r\n\r\nLord Rhondda realized the moral qualities of statesmanship. He appealed\r\nto the highest instincts of his countrymen. This was his greatest\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nHe was in many ways a lovable man. The quality which chiefly drew\r\npeople to him was his extreme boyishness. The remarkable beauty of his\r\nface always seemed to me an expression of this delightful\r\nboyishness--his smile deepening this effect in a most charming manner.\r\nHe loved life with a boy's fervour, regarding it always as an\r\nopportunity for winning success. The difficulties of work, like the\r\ndifficulties of a mathematical problem called out the athletic qualities\r\nof an otherwise shy and almost effeminate nature. He loved to pit his\r\nbrains against other men, rejoiced to discover obstacles in his path,\r\nnever despaired when things went against him, and infinitely preferred\r\nthe battle for success to the success itself. In this, too, he was a\r\nboy; he had to win a fight fairly and honourably to enjoy the victory. I\r\nbelieve him to have been one of the most honest and straightforward men\r\nthat ever made a fortune in business.\r\n\r\nThere was no man less embittered by failure and disappointment. He seems\r\nto have had reason to believe that Mr. Lloyd George frustrated his early\r\nefforts as a politician, indeed he told me more than once that Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge had deliberately set himself to that end; and yet it was at Mr.\r\nLloyd George's earnest beseeching that he accepted the office of Food\r\nController, and once a member of his Cabinet, he seldom spoke of this\r\nold opponent without the warmest admiration. \"You can't trust him a\r\nyard,\" he said to me on one occasion laughing very good-naturedly; \"but\r\nthere is not a man in the Government who can hold a candle to him for\r\ncourage and inspiration. I know very well that I could never have done\r\nwhat he has done. More than any man in the country he has pulled us\r\nthrough the critical days of the war. He is wonderful--nothing short of\r\nwonderful--and sometimes I feel almost fond of him, for he has many\r\nlikeable sides to his character; all the same, I know very well he is\r\nnot to be trusted. I took office on certain conditions, not one of which\r\nhas he observed. He is one of those men with whom you cannot deal\r\nconfidently.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the bitterest thing I ever heard him say of his former enemy.\r\nAs regards the old days in the House of Commons, he told me that there\r\nwas room for only one leader in Wales, and that, while Mr. Lloyd George\r\ncould speak, he couldn't, and so Mr. Lloyd George, who was consumed by\r\npersonal ambition, had won the battle. In saying this he smiled like a\r\nboy, and only grew serious when he added of those wasted years, \"The\r\nbother is I had a lot of useful things I wanted to do for the country.\"\r\n\r\nHe was convinced that he could have paid off the whole of the National\r\nDebt during those years.\r\n\r\nA good judge of statesmen said of Lord Rhondda that he would have made\r\nthe greatest Chancellor of the Exchequer these islands had ever\r\npossessed. I do not think there can be any doubt of this, for his genius\r\nlay in figures and he had extraordinary swiftness in seeing his way\r\nthrough expensive chaos to economical order. His mind was constructive,\r\nif not positively creative. He was never happier--except when\r\nbirds'-nesting or romping with young people--than when he was in an\r\narm-chair working out with pencil and paper some problem of\r\nadministration which involved enormous figures. He would sit up to the\r\nsmall hours of the morning over his work, and would come down to\r\nbreakfast radiant with happiness, bursting with energy, exclaiming, \"I\r\nhad a glorious time last night!\" Certainly he would have brought to the\r\nTreasury an original mind, and a mind, moreover, profoundly acquainted\r\nwith the activities of trade and commerce--those important factors in\r\nnational finance which appear to cut so small a figure in the minds of\r\nbankers and officials.\r\n\r\nAlthough a rather dull speaker, few men of my acquaintance were more\r\nlucid and convincing in conversation, particularly when he addressed a\r\nsympathetic mind. This was notably the case when he was unfolding his\r\nideas on the conflicting theories of Individualism and Socialism. If his\r\nconversations on this head could be printed in a book they would make\r\ndifficult work even for the most ingenious apologists of Socialism. He\r\nwas persuaded that no theory of Socialism could be put into successful\r\npractice without involving the loss of personal freedom, and that\r\nwithout Individualism there would be no initiative, no audacity, and no\r\ncreative energy in the development of an industry. Whenever he was in\r\nconflict with Socialists he would say to them, \"Why don't you buy me out\r\nand run the mines yourselves? You have plenty of money in your unions,\r\nand I am quite willing to sell.\"\r\n\r\nThere were several strange and interesting movements in his otherwise\r\nquite simple and boyish nature. For example, he had no religious faith\r\nworth speaking about, certainly no dogmatic faith of any kind; but he\r\nalways said his prayers. Then he held the theory that old age was a form\r\nof disease, and so avoided, as much as possible, the society of old\r\npeople, fearing contagion; the young people with whom he loved to\r\nsurround himself, and on whom he delighted to play many practical jokes,\r\nhe called his \"young germs.\"\r\n\r\nHe was entirely free from all forms of snobbishness, and would make fun\r\nof titles and honours and ridicule aristocratic pretensions; yet he went\r\nsomewhat painfully out of his way to get a title from his Party when he\r\nretired from the House of Commons, and was justly indignant at the way\r\nthis bargain was broken by the Liberal leaders of that day. I think he\r\nwanted a title at that time chiefly to prove to his constituents that he\r\nhad faithfully done his duty by them.\r\n\r\nHe seldom read a book of any account after he came down from Cambridge,\r\nbut hardly a day of his life passed that he did not learn by heart a\r\nnumber of fine sayings which appealed to him in a book of quotations.\r\nThese quotations he would fire off at his family till they cried for\r\nmercy, or another set.\r\n\r\nHe was far happier among his Herefords at Llanwern than in London or in\r\nCardiff, but he was for ever postponing the day of his retirement from\r\npublic life. He kept all his boy's love for birds and animals, and had\r\nreal feeling for beautiful things in nature; but the game of life drew\r\nhim always towards the city.\r\n\r\nAt one time he smoked a prodigious number of cigars and drank a bottle\r\nof port every night, but about twenty years before his death he gave up\r\nboth habits on the challenge of a friend and never reverted to them\r\nagain. Mr. William Brace, the miners' leader, said to me one day,\r\n\"Rhondda has the income of a duke and the tastes of a peasant, whereas I\r\nhave the income of a peasant and the tastes of a duke.\" I told Lord\r\nRhondda this, and he smiled quietly over the remark, saying, \"He's a\r\nvery pleasant fellow, Brace: fond of pictures, and a good judge of them,\r\ntoo. Yes, I suppose my tastes are rather simple when you come to look at\r\nthem, but I don't find them cheap.\" He was on excellent terms with\r\nLabour politicians, knew many of the old miners with real intimacy, and\r\ncould handle large bodies of men with consummate tact.\r\n\r\nI do not think for a moment that he was a very great man, but I can\r\nthink of few Cabinet ministers during the last thirty years who were\r\nanything like so well-fitted to render the nation real and lasting\r\nservice. Lord Rhondda had genius, and though a boyish egoist in his\r\nprivate life he was earnestly and most eagerly anxious to sacrifice all\r\nhe possessed for the good of the State. That he came so late and for so\r\nbrief a period to power I regard, if not as a national misfortune, at\r\nany rate as a striking condemnation of our methods of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD INVERFORTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD INVERFORTH 1ST BARON OF SOUTHGATE (ANDREW WEIR)\r\n\r\n     Born, 1865. Head of firm of Andrew Weir and Co. shipowners of\r\n     Glasgow, Surveyor General of Supplies, 1917-19; Minister of\r\n     Munitions, 1919.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD INVERFORTH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLORD INVERFORTH\r\n\r\n     _\"Gratitude is a fruit of great cultivation; you do not find it\r\n     among gross people.\"_--DR. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are keeping up Voltaire's idea of our English character. Instead of\r\nonly admirals, however, we are now hanging all sorts and descriptions of\r\nour public servants, but whether to encourage the others or to pay off a\r\ngrudge, who shall determine?\r\n\r\nLord Inverforth takes his hanging very well. One might go so far as to\r\nsay that he is not merely unaware of the noose round his neck but so\r\nperverse as to think he is still alive. His sense of humour is as good\r\nto him as a philosophic temperament.\r\n\r\nI like his sense of humour. It manifests itself very quietly and with a\r\nflash of unexpectedness. One day at luncheon he was speaking of Lord\r\nLeverhulme, whose acquaintance he had made only a week or two before.\r\nSomeone at the table said, \"What I like about Leverhulme is his\r\nsimplicity. In spite of all his tremendous undertakings he preserves the\r\nheart of a boy.\" With a twinkle in his eyes, and in a soft inquiring\r\nvoice, \"Have you ever tried to buy glycerine from him?\" asked Lord\r\nInverforth.\r\n\r\nThis story has a sequel. I mentioned it to Lord Leverhulme. \"One day\r\ntwo Englishmen,\" he replied at once, \"were passing the Ministry of\r\nMunitions. They saw Lord Inverforth going in. One who did not recognize\r\nhim said, 'Anyone can tell that man; he's a Scotsman.' To which the\r\nother, who did recognize him, replied, 'Yes, but you couldn't tell\r\n_that_ Scotsman anything else.' You might repeat that story to Lord\r\nInverforth the next time you meet him.\"\r\n\r\nI did, and the Minister of Munitions accepted the compliment with a good\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nIt is a fortunate thing for this country that a man of so remarkable a\r\ngenius for organization as Lord Inverforth should be found willing to\r\nserve the national interests in spite of an almost daily campaign of\r\nabuse directed against his administration. I sometimes wish he would\r\nbring an action for libel against one of these critics. It would be an\r\namusing case. He might claim damages of, let us say, £7,000,000 or even\r\n£10,000,000, for he is a man of gigantic interests, claiming these\r\ndamages on the score that his alleged libellers have injured his\r\nreputation as a man of business in all quarters of the world. They would\r\nhave him the craziest muddler and the most easily swindled imbecile\r\noutside Fleet Street--where alone wisdom is to be found. How one would\r\nenjoy a verbatim report of the cross-examination of these critics _in\r\ntheir own newspapers_.\r\n\r\nI will endeavour to show that Lord Inverforth is not quite so consummate\r\nan ass as his critics would have the public to believe, but rather one\r\nof the very greatest men, in his own particular line, who ever came to\r\nthe rescue of a chaotic Government.\r\n\r\nLet me not be supposed to insist that a great man of business is a great\r\nman. I regard Lord Inverforth as an exceedingly great man of business,\r\none of the very greatest in the world, and this fact I hope to make\r\nclear in a few lines, but I do not regard him as a national hero in the\r\nwider sense of that term. He has too many lacks for that, and some of\r\nthem essential to true and catholic greatness.\r\n\r\nHe could never fire the imagination of a people, nor does he convey a\r\nwarm and generous feeling to the heart. His enthusiasms are all of a\r\nsubdued nature. The driving force in his character which has made him so\r\npowerful a man of business, owes little to the higher virtues. He has\r\nfound the plain of life too full of absorbing interest and too crowded\r\nwith abounding opportunities for getting on to raise his eyes to the\r\nmountains. This is not to say that he is a man of no ideals, but to say\r\nthat his ideals are of too practical and prosaic a kind ever to stir the\r\npulses with excitement.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I regard him as a born statesman, and could wish that the\r\nconditions of political life made it more easy for a man of his gifts to\r\nserve the country than men with the gifts of, let us say, Dr. Macnamara\r\nor Sir Hamar Greenwood.\r\n\r\nThe world knows so little of him that perhaps I may begin my political\r\nreflections in this case with a brief summary of his career, such\r\ndetails of a business man's biography as may contribute to an\r\nunderstanding of his character.\r\n\r\nAndrew Weir, as he was in those days, went to school at Kirkcaldy, where\r\nhe was chiefly notable for seeking information on more subjects than\r\ncame under the jurisdiction of his pedagogue's ferule. A benign Rosa\r\nDartle might have been his godmother. He was for ever consulting\r\nencyclopædias and books of reference. However badly he knew his Greek\r\nverbs or his Latin syntax he had a very shrewd and curious knowledge of\r\nthe world when he left school at fifteen to enter the local branch of\r\nthe Commercial Bank of Scotland.\r\n\r\nAt school he had wanted to own ships. This ambition still lodged in his\r\nbrain. His thoughts were all at sea. There was no romance in the world\r\nso pleasing to his soul as the romance of the merchant marine. He had a\r\nreal passion for harbours. He loved the idea of far voyages. The smells\r\nof cargoes and warehouses composed a sea-bouquet for him which he\r\nesteemed sweeter than all the scents of hedges and wood. If there was a\r\nbig man for him in the world it was the sailor.\r\n\r\nI don't think he had so profound a feeling for bankers. Not quite so\r\ndownright as Lord Leverhulme in stating his opinion of bankers, Lord\r\nInverforth nevertheless regards them on the whole as lacking in courage\r\nand imagination. He said to himself on his banker's stool, \"I will learn\r\nall I can, but I won't stay here; I'll be a shipowner.\"\r\n\r\nIn his twentieth year he bought a sailing ship. This was at Glasgow in\r\nthe year 1885. He called himself Andrew Weir and Co. He had the feeling\r\nthat sailing ships, engaged in coastwise trade, might be bigger. He\r\nannounced his intention of building a large coasting ship. People\r\ninformed him, with an almost evangelical anxiety as to his commercial\r\nsalvation, that he was a lunatic. But the big ship was a success. He\r\nbuilt more and bigger. Then, in 1896 he said to himself, \"Why shouldn't\r\nsteam be used in the coasting trade?\" and he went into steam. Again\r\nthere were inquiries after his mental health, but the steamer flourished\r\nlike the big sailing ship. At the beginning of what the curate called\r\n\"this so-called twentieth century\" the firm of Andrew Weir and Co. flew\r\nits flag in all the ports under heaven, and controlled the largest fleet\r\nof sailing ships in the world.\r\n\r\nThere is this fact to be noticed in particular. Mr. Andrew Weir's\r\ninquisitive mind had not merely mastered the grammar of shipowning but\r\nhad crammed the cells of his brain with the whole encyclopædia of\r\ncommercial geography. He knew each season what the least of the islands\r\nof the world was producing, and the crops, manufactures, and financial\r\ncondition of every country across the sea. He knew, also, the way in\r\nwhich the various nations conducted the business of transport. From his\r\noffice in Glasgow he could see the whole vast labours of industrious and\r\nmercantile man, that Brobdingnagian ant of this revolving globe, merely\r\nby closing his eyes. The map of the world's commerce was cinematographed\r\nupon his brain.\r\n\r\nOne thing more remains to be said. Mr. Andrew Weir inherited the moral\r\ntraditions of Scotch industry. He grew rich, but not ostentatious. His\r\nincreasing fortune went back and back into trade. He never dreamed\r\neither of cutting a figure in plutocratic society or making himself a\r\npublic character. A quiet, rather shy, and not often articulate person,\r\nhe lived a frugal life, loving his business because it occupied all his\r\ntime and satisfied nearly every curiosity of his inquiring mind.\r\n\r\nWar came, and Mr. Weir was busier than ever with his ships. Not until\r\n1917 did it occur to the Government that the work of buying supplies for\r\nits gigantic armies was something only to be mastered by a man of\r\nbusiness. The nation may be grateful to Mr. Lloyd George for having\r\ndiscovered in Glasgow perhaps the one man in the British Isles who knew\r\neverything there was to know about commercial geography.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrew Weir entered the War Office in March, 1917, as Surveyor\r\nGeneral of Supply. The position was not merely difficult in its nature,\r\nbut difficult in its circumstances. Soldiers are jealous animals, and\r\nnot easily does the War Office take to the black-coated man of business.\r\nMr. Weir was tact itself. For some weeks the soldiers were hardly aware\r\nof his presence, then they learned that the quiet Scotsman in the black\r\ncoat was saying the most laudatory things about their organization;\r\nthen they found themselves marvellously improving this organization\r\nmerely by acting on the most modestly given suggestions from the smooth\r\ncivilian; and finally the very greatest of them discovered that somehow\r\nor another Supply had now got a wonderful \"move on,\" and that among\r\nother things this wonderful \"move on\" had brought the civilian on top of\r\nthem--still smooth and modest, still in the background, but absolute\r\nmaster of the whole machinery.\r\n\r\nLord Inverforth's work soon involved not merely the care of the British\r\nArmies but the care of the Allied nations. What did he do? Besieged by\r\nthe unconscionable rascals of the world, fawning or blustering to get\r\ncontracts at extraordinary prices, Lord Inverforth struck a master blow\r\nat this international cupidity by obtaining control of the principal raw\r\nmaterials and instituting the system of costing. Manufacturers got their\r\ncontracts on a fixed basis of profits. Lord Inverforth knew the exact\r\ncost of every stage in the manufacture of each article he bought, and he\r\nsaw that the manufacturer received from the taxpayer only a small\r\npercentage of profit on that cost.\r\n\r\nThe greatest thing he did at that time, and the bravest, for he did it\r\nwithout authorization and at a cost of £250,000,000, was to buy up the\r\nAustralasian wool-clip from 1917 to 1920. In this way Germany was doomed\r\nto defeat. England, so to speak, had the clothing of humanity in her\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Inverforth also controlled flax, hemp, leather, and jute, so\r\nthat the enemy's case was as hopeless as our own was secure.\r\n\r\nThese gigantic operations involved an expenditure of over £500,000,000.\r\nThey brought an actual profit to the British Government of over\r\n£20,000,000, saved the taxpayer Heaven only knows how many millions, and\r\nwere conducted at an administrative cost of three shillings for every\r\n£100.\r\n\r\nNothing like it had ever been done before in the world.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1919 Lord Inverforth was asked to clear up war's rubbish-heap.\r\nHe became Minister of Munitions. Within twenty-four hours his body of\r\nexpert buyers had become the Disposal Board--a body of expert sellers.\r\n\r\nThe property of the British taxpayer was scattered over four continents,\r\nand in all manner of places in those four continents. It was composed of\r\n350,000 different kinds of things.\r\n\r\nAt once Lord Inverforth was again besieged by the rascals. There was an\r\narmy of them, composed of many \"rings,\" seeking to buy up these \"waste\r\nproducts of war\" at a knock-down price. At the same time came the\r\nblustering contractor, cheated by peace of his contract, with a claim\r\nfor millions on one ground or another.\r\n\r\nLord Inverforth made it clear, first, that the stores were to be sold at\r\na commercial value, and, second, that he would protect the taxpayer\r\nagainst extortionate claims on the part of contractors. As regards this\r\nsecond difficulty, pressure was brought against him from the very\r\nhighest political quarters to admit certain claims and to avoid legal\r\naction. His reply was, \"I will resign before I initial those claims.\"\r\n\r\nHe fought them all, and he beat them all. He saved the taxpayer millions\r\nof pounds.\r\n\r\nAs for the disposal of stores, he has already brought to the Exchequer\r\nover £500,000,000, and before these pages are printed that sum may be\r\nincreased to something like £800,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe least imaginative reader will perceive from this brief statement\r\nthat a veritable Napoleon of Commerce has presided over the business\r\nside of the war. Where there was every opportunity for colossal waste,\r\nthere has been the most scientific economy; where there was every\r\nlikelihood of wholesale corruption, there has been an unsleeping\r\nvigilance of honesty; and where, at the end, there might have been a\r\ntired carelessness resulting in ruinous loss, there has been up to the\r\nvery last moment an unremitting enthusiasm for the taxpayers' interest\r\nwhich has resulted in a credit contribution to the national balance\r\nsheet of £800,000,000.\r\n\r\nI have left to the last this not unworthy feature of Lord Inverforth's\r\nlabours. Those labours have been given to the nation. He, at the head of\r\nthings, and the chiefs of the Disposal Board under him, have refused to\r\naccept any financial reward. One and all they deserted their businesses\r\nand slaved from morning to night in the national interests, and one and\r\nall they gave their services to the State.\r\n\r\nWhat has been Lord Inverforth's reward from the public? From first to\r\nlast he has been attacked by a considerable section of the Press, and\r\nhas been accused in Parliament of incredible waste and incorrigible\r\nstupidity. Let it be supposed (I do not grant it for a moment) that he\r\nmade mistakes, even very great mistakes, still, on the total result of\r\nhis gigantic labours, does not the public owe him a debt of gratitude?\r\nHas he not been an honest man at the head of a department where\r\ndishonesty had its chief opportunity? Did he not strike a death blow at\r\nGermany when he secured, with a suddenness which ruined his rivals in\r\nthe field, the wool-clip of the world? Is there one man in these islands\r\nwho thought for a moment that the overplus of stores would fetch a sum\r\nof £800,000,000?\r\n\r\nI will say a word about Slough, which is still the favourite cry of Lord\r\nInverforth's critics, who have held their peace about the \"dumps\" since\r\nthe publication of the White Paper describing the sale of stores.\r\n\r\nSlough was the work of the War Office. It was begun badly. Mistakes of a\r\nserious kind were made. It might have been a financial disaster. But\r\nLord Inverforth is a chivalrous man. He has never disclosed the fact\r\nthat he inherited Slough. In the face of violent criticism he has\r\nmaintained a dignified silence, letting the world think that he was the\r\nparent of the idea, and bending all his energies to make it a success.\r\nHe has had his reward. Slough has been sold and the transaction shows a\r\nprofit for the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of his administration I saw a good deal of Lord\r\nInverforth. He was anxious to get back to his own work. He asked again\r\nand again to be relieved of his duties--the machinery he had set up\r\nbeing in excellent running order. But the Prime Minister begged him to\r\nstay, and he has stayed, against his will and against his own interests,\r\nand all the time he has been subjected to a stream of malignant\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nLet the reader ask himself whether the case of Lord Inverforth is likely\r\nto encourage the best brains in the country to come to the political\r\nservice of the nation. Is there not a danger that we may fall into the\r\nAmerican position, and have our great men in commerce and our\r\nsecond-rate men in politics?\r\n\r\nI regard Lord Inverforth as one of the few very great men in commerce\r\nwho have the qualities of genuine statesmanship. I am not at liberty to\r\ngive my chief grounds for this belief, but before long the world may\r\nknow from Lord Inverforth's commercial activities on the Continent that\r\nmore than any other man in these islands he has seen the way and taken\r\nthe step to reconstruct the shattered civilization of Europe.\r\n\r\nOn many occasions I have discussed with him the future of mankind. I\r\nhave found him the least anxious and always the most self-possessed\r\nobserver of events. Quiet, patient, practical, and imaginative, inspired\r\ntoo by humane motives, he cherishes the unshakable faith that Great\r\nBritain is destined to lead civilization into the future as far as human\r\neye can see. He places his faith in British character. Rivalry on the\r\npart of powerful nations, even when it is directed against our key\r\nindustries, does not disturb him in the least. While others are crying,\r\n\"How shall we save ourselves?\" he is pushing the fortunes of the British\r\nrace in every quarter of the world. And where British trade goes, on the\r\nwhole there goes too the highest civilizing power in the world--British\r\ncharacter. It is significant of his faith that he has ever worked to get\r\nthe British mercantile marine manned by men of the British race, and to\r\nthis end has led the way in improving the conditions of the British\r\nseaman's life.\r\n\r\n\"All the fallacies and wild theories of revolutionary minds,\" he once\r\nsaid to me, \"break ultimately on the rock of industrial fact. The more\r\nfreely nations trade together the more clearly will it be seen that\r\nhumanity must work out its salvation within the limits of economic law.\r\nAnd the way to a smooth working out of that salvation is by recognizing\r\nthe claims of the moral law. We are men before we are merchants. There\r\nis no reason why mistrust should exist between management and labour.\r\nThe economic law by no means excludes, but rather demands, humaneness. I\r\nbelieve that a system of profit sharing can be devised which will bring\r\nmanagement and labour into a sensible partnership. Selfishness on the\r\npart of capital is as bad as selfishness on the part of labour. Both\r\nmust be unselfish, both must think of the general community, and both\r\nmust work hard. The two chief enemies of mankind are moral slackness and\r\nphysical slackness.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no man living who would make a better Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer than this merchant prince who, however, has had enough of\r\npolitics and is going back very gladly to his desk in the City. He is\r\nnot in the least soured by the public ingratitude, and rightly judges it\r\nto be rather the voice of unscrupulous and stunt-seeking journalism than\r\nthe considered judgment of the nation. But he has a very poor opinion of\r\nthe way in which the Government of the country conducts its business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD LEVERHULME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD LEVERHULME, 1ST BARON (WILLIAM HESKETH LEVER)\r\n\r\n     Born 1851, Lancashire. Educ.: Bolton Church Institute; Chairman of\r\n     Lever Bros., Port Sunlight; High Sheriff, Lancaster, 1917.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD LEVERHULME]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLORD LEVERHULME\r\n\r\n     _\"Dullness is so much stronger than genius because there is so much\r\n     more of it, and it is better organized and more naturally cohesive_\r\n     inter se. _So the Arctic volcano can do nothing against Arctic\r\n     ice.\"_--SAMUEL BUTLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may properly wonder to find the figure of Lord Leverhulme\r\nbrought before the mirrors of Downing Street.\r\n\r\nBut let me explain why I introduce this industrial Triton into the\r\nsociety of our political minnows.\r\n\r\nLord Leverhulme rejected politics only when politics rejected him. He is\r\nof that distinguished company to whom the House of Commons has turned\r\nboth a deaf ear and a cold shoulder. He failed where Mr. Walter Long\r\nsucceeded, and fell where Dr. Macnamara rose.\r\n\r\nI once asked a Cabinet Minister how it was that a man of such\r\nconspicuous quality had failed to win office. \"I really cannot tell\r\nyou,\" he replied with complacency, \"but I remember very well that the\r\nHouse of Commons never took to him. It is curious how many men who do\r\nwell outside the House of Commons fail to make good inside.\"\r\n\r\nCurious indeed! But more curious still, we may surely say, that the\r\nHouse of Commons should continue, in the light of this knowledge, to\r\nenjoy so good an opinion of itself.\r\n\r\nI suppose that nobody will now dispute that Lord Leverhulme is easily\r\nthe foremost industrialist, not merely in the British Isles, but in the\r\nworld. I can think of no one who approaches him in the creative faculty.\r\nNot even America, the country of big men and big businesses, has\r\nproduced a man of this truly colossal stature. Mr. Rockefeller is a name\r\nfor a committee. Mr. Carnegie was pushed to fortune by his more resolute\r\nhenchmen. But Lord Leverhulme, as is very well known in America, has\r\nbeen the sole architect of his tremendous fortunes, and in all his\r\nnumerous undertakings exercises the power of an unquestioned autocrat.\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd George once remarked to me that the trouble with Lord\r\nLeverhulme is that he cannot work with other men. But this is only true\r\nin part. Lord Leverhulme can work very well with men who are not fools.\r\nWhen I told him of Mr. Lloyd George's remark, \"Well, I don't know,\" he\r\nreplied, \"I have been working with other men all my life!\" Yes, but\r\nthis, too, expresses only part of the truth. He has been working with\r\nthese other men as an accepted master.\r\n\r\nIt is not so in politics. There a man of power cannot pick and choose\r\nhis colleagues. He must work with fools as well as men of ability. And\r\nnever can he work as a master. Always at the Cabinet table he will find\r\na cabal of deadheads opposed to the exercise of his authority, and in\r\nthe department over which he is set to rule a bunch of traditional\r\nBarnacles, without one spark of imagination between them, who will fight\r\nhis new ideas at every turn.\r\n\r\nThe essence of politics and government is mediocrity. The good sense of\r\nthe House of Commons is a conspiracy to resist genius and to enthrone\r\nthe average man. A department of the State is well governed only when\r\nits chief Civil Servant, by the grace of God, chances to be a man of\r\nstatesmanlike capacity.\r\n\r\nLike Lord Rhondda, Lord Leverhulme was approached by the Government\r\nduring the numerous crises of the war to render service to the State.\r\nHis experience in this respect confirmed his judgment that our system of\r\ngovernment is a chaos which would hardly be tolerated in a business\r\nestablishment of the second class. I will give an incident.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of grave urgency to the Government that margarine should\r\nbe manufactured in this country. A Cabinet Minister begged Lord\r\nLeverhulme, on the score of patriotism, to set up such a factory. Lord\r\nLeverhulme expressed his willingness to take up the project, but said\r\nthat he must go to the public for a certain sum of money to carry it\r\nout. The Cabinet Minister made no demur to this very natural proposal,\r\nbut suggested that it might be well if Lord Leverhulme would call at the\r\nTreasury and inform them of his purpose.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the great industrialist, able as was no other man in this\r\nparticular to serve his country's need, called humbly at the Treasury\r\nfor permission to ask the public for capital. He was received by an\r\nofficial who refused point-blank to listen to such a proposition. Lord\r\nLeverhulme mentioned again the name of the Cabinet Minister who had\r\nrequested him to embark on this venture. This was nothing to the\r\nofficial. He had nothing to do with other departments. His business was\r\nto see that the public's money came to the Treasury; he was certainly\r\nnot going to countenance the raising of money for an industrial purpose.\r\n\r\nYou could no more have got into this gentleman's head than you could\r\nhave got into the head of a rabbit the idea that money invested in an\r\nessential industrial undertaking pays the State far better than money\r\nadvanced to it at the cost of five per cent.\r\n\r\nNot to weary the reader with an incident, however telling, the end of\r\nthis affair was that after going backwards and forwards between a\r\nCabinet Minister and a Treasury official, Lord Leverhulme was at last\r\npermitted to ask the public for a small sum of money which he himself\r\nconsidered inadequate for the Government's purpose.\r\n\r\nI have never heard him speak bitterly of his political experiences, but\r\nI have never heard him express anything but an amused contempt for the\r\nantiquated machinery which passes amongst politicians for a system of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n     The English [he says] have pushed their fortunes, never by the aid\r\n     of Government, but on the contrary almost always in the teeth of\r\n     Government opposition. There is no man so lacking in imagination as\r\n     a Government official, and no man, unless it is a banker, so\r\n     wanting in courage as a Cabinet Minister. The wealth of England is\r\n     the creation of her industrial population. The brains, the faith,\r\n     the energy of the capitalist, and the brains, the loyalty, the\r\n     strength of labour, these have made us the first nation of the\r\n     world. There has been only one real obstacle in our path. Not\r\n     foreign competition, for that is an incentive, but the cowardice\r\n     and stupidity of Governments. We possess an empire unrivalled in\r\n     its opportunities for trade and commerce, an empire which, you\r\n     would surely think, could not fail to inspire a statesman with\r\n     great ideas. But what happens? We have a Government which thinks it\r\n     has exhausted statesmanship by crippling industry at home in order\r\n     to pay off our war debt as quickly as possible. Instead of setting\r\n     itself to create more wealth, with the wealth of the world lying at\r\n     its feet, it sets itself to dry up the sources of wealth at the\r\n     centre of the empire. But it is no use talking. One thing a\r\n     Government in this country cannot stand is imagination; and another\r\n     is courage. The British Empire is in the hands of a lot of\r\n     clerks--and timid clerks at that. We must do our best to get along\r\n     without statesmanship at the head.\r\n\r\nThe reader may not remember that some years before Mr. Lloyd George\r\nplunged into a disordered series of social reforms, Lord Leverhulme,\r\nsitting in the House of Commons, introduced Bills of a reasonable and\r\nconnected character to ensure workmen against unemployment and to set up\r\na system of old age pensions. He did not enter Parliament for his own\r\nglorification. He had nothing to gain, but much to lose, by devoting\r\nhimself to the business of Westminster. But he believed that he could\r\nbenefit the State as a legislator, and he entered Parliament with the\r\ndefinite intention of introducing order into what was self-evidently a\r\ncondition of dangerous chaos. He had a remedy for slums, a remedy for\r\nunemployment, a remedy for the poverty of the workman in old age, and a\r\nremedy for the educational deadlock. Further, he cherished the hope that\r\nhe might do something towards developing the wealth and power of the\r\nBritish Empire, without impairing the spirit of individualism which, in\r\nhis faith, is the driving power of British fortune.\r\n\r\nHow many men who entered the House of Commons with no ideas at all have\r\nbeen taken to the friendly bosom of that assembly? Moreover, can the\r\nreader name with confidence one Cabinet Minister in the past twenty\r\nyears who can fairly be compared in creative genius with this remarkable\r\nman to whom the House of Commons refused the least of its rewards?\r\n\r\nI saw Lord Leverhulme on several occasions at the end of the war. He\r\nspoke to me with great freedom of his ideas in the hope that I might\r\ncarry them with effect to the Prime Minister. He proved to me that it\r\nwas the nonsense of a schoolboy to talk of making Germany pay for the\r\nwar, and suggested that the Prime Minister's main appeal to the nation\r\nat the General Election of 1918 should be a moral appeal for unity in\r\nthe industrial world. He had one master word for that great moment in\r\nour history. It was the word \"Production.\"\r\n\r\nI found this word unpopular in Downing Street. Mr. Lloyd George was more\r\nmindful of Lord Northcliffe than of one \"who cannot work with other\r\nmen.\" And so the word went forth to the British peoples: Germany must\r\npay for the war and the Kaiser must be tried. At the eleventh hour\r\nbefore the election there was no equivocation. Germany _should_ pay for\r\nthe war. The Kaiser _should_ be tried. Instead of a great moral appeal,\r\nwhich might have prevented all the disastrous conflicts in industry, and\r\nmight have preserved the spirit of loyalty which had united the people\r\nduring the war, the Prime Minister put himself at the head of a\r\ndisreputable mob calling for revenge.\r\n\r\n\"One disadvantage of the democratic system,\" says Mr. Birrell, \"is that\r\na Prime Minister no longer feels himself responsible for good\r\ngovernment. He awaits a 'mandate' from a mob who are watching a football\r\nmatch.\"\r\n\r\nWe have only to compare this order of mind with a mind like Lord\r\nLeverhulme's to perceive how it is that politics in our country tend\r\nmore and more in the American direction. The big men are outside.\r\nPolitics are little more than a platform for a pugilistic kind of\r\nrhetoric. He who can talk glibly and with occasional touches of such\r\nsentimentalism as one finds in a Penny Reciter is assured of the ear of\r\nthe House of Commons, and may fairly count on one day becoming a\r\nMinister of State. But the field for the constructive, imaginative, and\r\ncreative minds is the field of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe danger of the State from this condition of things is, unhappily, not\r\nonly the loss of creative statesmanship at the head of the\r\nnation--serious as that is. The danger is greater. Small men are more\r\nlikely to fall into dishonest ways than big men. There lies, I think,\r\nour greatest danger. It seems to me, observing our public life with some\r\ndegree of intimacy, that there is a growing tendency for the gentleman\r\nto fall out of the political ranks and for his place to be filled by the\r\nprofessional politician, who in many cases appears to be almost entirely\r\nwithout moral principle. What can become of such a movement save\r\neventual corruption? At present our politics are stupid but fairly\r\nhonest. There are still representatives of the old school in the House\r\nof Commons. But the conquering advance is from the ranks of\r\nprofessionalism.\r\n\r\nI would not have the reader to suppose that I consider Lord Leverhulme a\r\nheaven-sent genius of statesmanship. The British constitution is twelve\r\nmen in a box, and the very spirit of that arrangement is distrust of the\r\nexpert. Moreover, there is wisdom in the Eastern legend which says that\r\nin making genius the fairies left out one essential gift--the knowledge\r\nof when to stop.\r\n\r\nWhether Lord Leverhulme would have made a better statesman than, let us\r\nsay, Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman or Mr. Bonar Law it is surely certain,\r\nI think, that a true statesman would have made every conceivable use of\r\nhis unusual mind. This, as I look at things, is the ideal method of\r\ngovernment. I do not believe in the business man as statesman. I believe\r\nin the trained, cultured, and incorruptible gentleman as statesman, and\r\nthe business man as his adviser.\r\n\r\nBut until our politics are of a higher order we can hardly expect the\r\nbest minds in the nation to feel any attraction to a political career.\r\nMore and more the professional politician, the narrow man, the man of\r\nthe loud voice and the one idea, the man who has few instincts of\r\nhonesty in his mind and no movement of high and disinterested patriotism\r\nin his soul, will press himself upon the attention of democracy and by\r\nintimidating his leaders and brow-beating his opponents force his way\r\nonward to office.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of this grave peril to the moral character of our\r\npublic life brings me to my brief conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n     _\"While the advances made by objective science and its industrial\r\n     applications are palpable and undeniable all around us, it is a\r\n     matter of doubt and dispute if our social and moral advance towards\r\n     happiness and virtue has been great or any.\"_--MARK PATTISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all, a nation gets the politics that it deserves. The fault is not\r\nin our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings. If the tone of\r\npublic life is a low one it is because the tone of society is not a high\r\none. The remedy, then, is not \"Sack the lot,\" but rather, \"Repent, lest\r\na worse thing befall thee.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that a beginning in moral and social reformation might be\r\nmade if aristocracy could be encouraged to affirm its ancient rights by\r\nthe performance of its inherent duties.\r\n\r\nWe are a nation without standards, kept in health rather by memories\r\nwhich are fading than by examples which are compelling. We still march\r\nto the dying music of great traditions but there is no captain of\r\ncivilization at the head of our ranks. We have indeed almost ceased to\r\nbe an army marching with confidence towards the enemy, and have become a\r\nmob breaking impatiently loose from the discipline and ideals of our\r\npast.\r\n\r\nAristocracy, it must be boldly said, has played traitor to England. It\r\nhas ceased to lead, and not because it has been thrust from its rightful\r\nplace by the rude hand of democracy, but because it has deliberately\r\npreferred the company of the vulgar. No one has pulled it down, it has\r\nitself descended. It has lost its respect for learning, it has grown\r\ncareless of manners, it has abandoned faith in its duty, it is conscious\r\nof no solemn obligations, it takes no interest in art, it is indifferent\r\nto science, it is sick of effort, it has surrendered gladly and\r\ngratefully to the materialism of plutocracy.\r\n\r\nIf it could have lost itself in plutocracy the harm would not have been\r\nso great; but it still remains for the multitude a true aristocracy, and\r\nlooking up to that aristocracy for its standards--an aristocracy whose\r\nprivate life is now public property--the multitude has become\r\nmaterialistic, throwing Puritanism to the dogs, and pushing as heartily\r\nforward to the trough as any full-fed glutton in the middle or the upper\r\nranks of life.\r\n\r\nThe standards set by the privileged classes at this time are the same\r\nstandards as ruled in France before the Revolution. There is no example\r\nof modesty, earnestness, restraint, thrift, duty, or culture. Everything\r\nis sensual and ostentatious, and shamefacedly sensual and ostentatious.\r\n\r\nIt is time for the best people in aristocracy to set their faces against\r\nthis wanton and destructive spirit. It is time a halt was called to\r\nluxury and profligacy; time that the door was shut in the face of\r\ninvading vulgarity. Creation has not agonized in bloody sweat through\r\ncountless ages of suffering and achievement that those who possess the\r\nhighest opportunities for doing good should pervert those opportunities\r\ninto a mere platform for the display of a harmful badness. Evolution was\r\nnot aiming at Belgravia when it set out on its long journey from the\r\nflaming mist of the nebula. We cannot suppose that Nature is content\r\nwith the egoism of the social butterfly. The very blood of dead humanity\r\ncries out for a higher creature.\r\n\r\nAristocracy, one sees, is too apt to regard itself as the spoilt child\r\nof material fortune, instead of humbly and with a sense of deepest\r\nresponsibility accepting the heavy duties of moral leadership imposed\r\nupon it by the labours of evolution.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the children of the present generation of\r\naristocracy may grow up with no taste for the betting ring, the card\r\nroom, and the night club, or, at any rate, that a certain number of them\r\nmay find their highest happiness in knowledge and wisdom rather than in\r\namateur theatricals and fancy-dress balls. The human mind, after all,\r\ncannot find rest in triviality, and after so long a period of the most\r\nsordid and vulgar self-indulgence it is reasonable to hope that our\r\naristocracy may experience a reaction.\r\n\r\nIf men would ask themselves, before they rush out to seek her, What is\r\nPleasure? and consult the past history of humanity as well as their own\r\nsenses and inclinations they could hardly fail, except in the case of\r\nthe most degenerate, to discover that the highest happiness is not of\r\nthe nursery or the kitchen, but rather of the living spirit.\r\n\r\nObservation of nature, love of beautiful things, delight in noble\r\nliterature, gratitude for the highest forms of wit and humour, sympathy\r\nwith all sorts and conditions of men, reverence for the majesty of the\r\nuniverse, kindness to all, love of children, and devotion to the home,\r\nthese operations of the human spirit bring peace to the heart of man and\r\ncontinue their ministrations to his happiness with an increasing power\r\nof joy as his personality enlarges itself to receive the highest\r\nrevelations of Life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomething far greater than she is now doing might be done by the Church\r\nto restore the sanctions which once ruled human conduct and gave a\r\nliving force to public opinion. Religion in these days is obviously too\r\ncomplaisant. To watch the Church in the world is to be reminded of a\r\npoor relation from the provinces sitting silent and overawed in the\r\ngilded drawing-room of a parvenu. There is no sound of confidence in her\r\nvoice. She whines for the world's notice instead of denouncing its very\r\nobvious sins. She is too much in this world, and too little in the\r\nother. She is too careful not to offend Dives, and too self-conscious to\r\nbe seen openly in the company of Lazarus. It is impossible not to think\r\nthat a coarse world has shaken her faith in Christian virtue. She clings\r\nto her traditions and her doctrines, but she has lost the vigorous faith\r\nin spiritual life which gave beauty to those traditions and has ceased\r\nto set that example of entire self-sacrifice which rendered her\r\ndoctrines less difficult of interpretation by the instructed. She has\r\nceased to preach, even with the dying embers of conviction, that a man\r\nmay gain the whole world and yet lose his soul alive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA responsibility hardly to be exceeded by that of aristocracy rests upon\r\nthe leaders of Labour. Every voice raised to encourage the economic\r\ndelusions of Socialism is a voice on the side of vulgarity and\r\nirreligion. Most of the leaders of Labour know perfectly well that\r\neconomic Socialism is impossible, but by not saying so with honest\r\ncourage they commit a grave sin, a sin not only against society but\r\nagainst God. For democracy in England, once the most sensible and\r\nkind-hearted democracy in Europe, is placing its faith more and more in\r\nthe power of wages to buy happiness, turning away with more and more\r\nimpatience from the divine truth that the Kingdom of Heaven is within\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIt is a grievous thing to corrupt the mind of the simple. Democracy in\r\nEngland has been the chief representative of veritable Englishness up to\r\nthese days. It was never Latinized or Frenchified. The cottage garden\r\nrefused to follow the bad example of the \"carpet-bedder.\" The poor have\r\nalways been racy of the soil. They have laughed at the absurdities of\r\nfashion and seen through the pretensions of wealth. They have believed\r\nin heartiness and cheerfulness. All their proverbs spring out of a keen\r\nsense of virtue. All their games are of a manly character. To\r\nmaterialize this glorious people, to commercialize and mammonize it, to\r\nmake it think of economics instead of life, to make it bitter,\r\ndiscontented, and tyrannous, this is to strike at the very heart of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBut though the leaders of Labour are guilty of this corruption, there is\r\nno doubt that the ugliness of spirit in democracy is the reflection of\r\nthe ugly life led by the privileged classes. There is no reproach for\r\nthis democracy when it looks upward. It sees nothing but the reckless\r\nand useless display of wealth, nothing in the full sunshine of\r\nprosperity but a Bacchanalian horde of irresponsible sensualists,\r\nnothing there but a ramp of unashamed hedonism, and a hedonism of the\r\nlowest order.\r\n\r\nDemocracy, nursing what it deems to be its economic wrongs, and not\r\nunnaturally regarding the wealthy classes with bitter anger, has yet to\r\nlearn that capital was largely the creation of the Puritan character,\r\nand that the prosperity of these British Islands was laid in no small\r\nmeasure by the thrift and temperance of those who lived simply because\r\nthey thought deeply. Capital, without which Labour could have done\r\nlittle, is not a contrivance of the noisy rich, but the deliberate\r\ncreation of virtuous men. Capital, now regarded as an enemy, was once\r\nthe visible best friend of Labour.\r\n\r\nWhere is there now among the possessing classes an example even of\r\nsimplicity in dress, modesty in behaviour, temperance in conduct, and\r\nthrift in living? As for any higher example--an example of wisdom, duty,\r\nself-sacrifice, and moral earnestness--it is nowhere visible in our\r\nnational life to those who look upward.\r\n\r\nUntil we recover this ancient spirit our politics must continue their\r\ndescent to the abyss, and democracy will listen to the corrupting\r\ndelusions of the economic Socialist.\r\n\r\nWe need the Puritan element in our characters, the Hellenic element in\r\nour minds, and the Christian element in our souls. We must set a higher\r\nvalue on moral qualities, on intellectual qualities, and on Christian\r\nqualities. We must learn to see, not gloomily and heavily, but with joy\r\nand thanksgiving, that our world is set in the midst of an infinite\r\nuniverse, that it has a purpose in the scheme of things, that we are all\r\nmembers one of another, and that there is no grandeur of character,\r\nmind, or soul which can ever be worthy of creation's purpose.\r\n\r\nLess flippancy in the world would lead to more seriousness, more\r\nseriousness would lead to greater intelligence, and greater intelligence\r\nwould lead to nobler living.\r\n\r\n\"The cure for us,\" said George Sand, \"is far more simple than we will\r\nbelieve. All the better natures amongst us see it and feel it. It is a\r\ngood direction given by ourselves to our hearts and consciences.\"\r\n\r\nLet each man ask himself, Is my direction worthy of man's past and\r\nhopeful for his future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_An instantaneous success_\"\r\n\r\n+Mirrors of Washington+\r\n\r\n+Anonymous+\r\n\r\n_Octavo.
