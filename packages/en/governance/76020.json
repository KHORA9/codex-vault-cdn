No business community\r\ncan permanently succeed if the average member of it does not possess\r\na certain quantity of high ideals; and, gentlemen, there is not a\r\nbusiness man of large experience here who will not agree with me when I\r\nsay that. Permanent success will come to the business community where\r\nthe average man’s word can be trusted, where the average man himself\r\ncan be trusted in dealing with his fellows. Just as that is true of the\r\naverage business community, so it is true of the Nation as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe Nation must act in a spirit which gives full recognition to the\r\nnational demands, which is not in the least Quixotic, which sees the\r\nneed of working for the interests of the average individual of the\r\nNation, but in a spirit which recognizes duties as well as rights,\r\nwhich recognizes this in our internal affairs, which recognizes it in\r\nour external affairs.\r\n\r\nThis leads me up to a subject concerning which I wish not merely to\r\ncongratulate, but on behalf of the Nation to thank those present;\r\nthe part played by the Merchants’ Club in initiating, and with the\r\naid of the Commercial Club in carrying to a successful conclusion,\r\nthe movement which resulted in the establishment of a naval training\r\nstation here on Lake Michigan. I need not say to those of you who know\r\nanything at all about me that I believe in a big navy; and I hope I\r\nneed not say that I believe in it not as a provocative to war, but as a\r\nguarantee of peace. I want to see every section of this country realize\r\nthat the navy stands for the whole country, and that the people of\r\nthe seacoast are not a particle more interested in it than the people\r\nof the Mississippi Valley. There were two sides to the establishment\r\nof that naval station here, where it was established. In the first\r\nplace, we get, as perhaps some of you know, a peculiarly valuable class\r\nof recruit for the navy from the Mississippi Valley and the region\r\nadjoining the Great Lakes. In the next place, I wanted to see part\r\nof the establishment of the navy have its local habitation and name\r\nhere in the great West. So I feel that this organization conferred\r\na favor not only upon the city of Chicago, but an advantage to the\r\nwhole country in what it did toward securing the establishment of that\r\nstation here where it has been established.\r\n\r\nI do not think that it is now very necessary to make an argument for\r\nan efficient navy. We are so fortunate that in this country we can\r\nget along with a very small army, an army which relatively to the\r\npopulation of the country is smaller than the police force of many of\r\nour great cities. With the navy the case is different We have not the\r\nchoice, gentlemen, as to whether or not this country will play a great\r\npart in the world. We can not help playing a great part. All we can\r\ndecide is whether we shall play it well or ill. That is the decision we\r\nhave to make. We can decide whether we will do badly or well, but we\r\ncan not decide whether the part is to be played. We have got to play\r\nit. We can not abandon our position on the Monroe Doctrine. We can not\r\nabandon the Panama Canal. We can not abandon the duties that have come\r\nto us from the mere fact of our growth as a Nation, from the growth of\r\nour commercial interests in the East and in the West, on the Atlantic\r\nand in the Pacific. I earnestly hope that with the added responsibility\r\nwill come not merely a growth of power to meet that responsibility,\r\nbut a growth of mental attitude on our part toward these new duties.\r\nIf there is one thing that ought to be more offensive to every good\r\nAmerican than almost anything else it is the habit of speaking with a\r\nloose tongue, speaking offensively about foreign nations, or adopting\r\nan ill-considered and irritating attitude toward any one of them. In\r\nprivate life there is no one to whom we rightly object more than to the\r\nman who is continually offending and insulting his neighbors; except\r\nto the man who in addition to doing that then fails to make good. I\r\nhope to see our foreign policy conducted always in a spirit not merely\r\nof scrupulous regard for the rights of others, but of scrupulous\r\ncourtesy toward others; and at the same time to see us keep prepared\r\nso that there is no position that we take in either hemisphere that\r\nonce taken we can not stand on. With this in order not only is it\r\nimportant that the Government officials should behave themselves, but\r\nit is also important that private citizens should. The public speaker,\r\nthe writer in the press, the legislator, the public servant, all owe\r\nit to this country to behave with the courtesy toward others which we\r\nwould like to have extended toward us; but to behave with that courtesy\r\nwhether it is extended in return or not. Outsiders can not hurt us by\r\nbeing insolent so long as we behave ourselves. What they say is of no\r\nconsequence to us compared to what we say to them. Hard words will\r\nnot hurt us if we will only disregard them. Let them say anything;\r\nbut let us go on and build up the navy. That will be a much greater\r\nprovocative to friendship and respect than any amount of recrimination.\r\nI have a right to appeal to the men here before me, to the men who\r\nin so many different walks take the lead in this great city, to aid\r\nin consistently building up just that type of foreign policy, a\r\nforeign policy under which we shall make the name of the United States\r\nGovernment a symbol on the one hand, as it ought to be, for the just\r\nand proper insistence upon its own rights, but also a symbol for a\r\ndisinterested and generous willingness to treat all other nations, all\r\nother powers, with just and with frank courtesy and good-will, and to\r\nmake it evident that in this country’s foreign policy it recognizes\r\nits duty toward the weak just as much as its responsibility to the\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET OF THE IROQUOIS CLUB, CHICAGO, ILL., MAY 10, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. President, Mr. Toastmaster, and you, my Hosts_:\r\n\r\nOur country is governed, and under existing circumstances can only be\r\ngoverned, under the party system, and that should mean, and that will\r\nmean, when we have a sufficient number of people who take the point of\r\nview that Judge Dickinson takes, that there shall be a frank and manly\r\nopposition of party to party, of party man to party man, combined with\r\nan equally frank refusal to conduct a party contest in any such way as\r\nto give good Americans cause for regret because of what is said before\r\nelection, when compared with what is said after election. The frankest\r\nopposition to a given man or a given party on questions of public\r\npolicy not only can be, but almost always should be, combined with\r\nthe frankest recognition of the infinitely greater number of points\r\nof agreement than of the points of difference. I have accepted your\r\nkind and generous invitation to come before you this evening, because\r\nthe longer I am in public life the more firmly I am convinced that the\r\ngreat bulk of the questions of most importance before us as a people\r\nare questions which we can best decide not from the standpoint of\r\nrepublicanism or democracy, but from the standpoint of the interests\r\nof the average American citizen, whether Republican or Democrat.\r\n\r\nThis is true of both foreign and domestic questions. Our political\r\ndifferences should, and in the great majority of cases do, disappear at\r\nthe water’s edge. When I had to choose a man to represent to a peculiar\r\ndegree the interests of this Government in one of the most important\r\nforeign negotiations of recent years—that concerning the Alaskan\r\nboundary—I chose the best lawyer, one of the ablest public men, and one\r\nof the most fair-minded patriots that could be found in the country;\r\nand the fact that he was of opposite political faith did not interfere\r\nwith Judge Dickinson’s doing that work well. That was a question that\r\nconcerned the United States—all of the United States. Most questions\r\nthat come up in Washington are questions that go much deeper than\r\nparty, are questions that affect the whole country, and the man would\r\nbe indeed unfit for the position of President who did not feel that\r\nwhen he held that office he held it in the most emphatic sense as the\r\nrepresentative of all the people.\r\n\r\nOne of the works that Uncle Sam has on hand just at present is digging\r\nthe Panama Canal; and it is going to be dug. It is going to be dug\r\nhonestly and as cheaply as is compatible with efficiency; but with the\r\nefficiency first. I wanted Congress to give me power to remodel the\r\ncommission. It did not do it. So I remodeled it anyhow, purely in the\r\nexercise of my executive functions. I made up my mind this time that\r\nI was not going to make the slightest effort to represent different\r\nsections of the country on that commission, that I was going to have\r\nthe whole country represented, by putting the best man I could get in\r\nany given position, without the slightest regard to where he came from;\r\nand while it was an accident, still I may mention it as a fortunate\r\naccident that the two most important positions were filled from\r\nIllinois—Shonts and Wallace are both from Illinois.\r\n\r\nThese are external questions, as regards which the interests of the\r\nwhole country and not the interests of any party or any section of the\r\ncountry must be considered by the President. So it is with certain of\r\nour great internal policies.\r\n\r\nAmong the vital questions that have come up for solution, because of\r\nthe extraordinary industrial development of this country, as of all the\r\nmodern world, are the questions affecting capital and labor as regards\r\neach other, and the questions resulting from the effect upon the public\r\nof the organization into great masses of both capital and labor. I\r\nbelieve thoroughly in each kind of organization, but I recognize that\r\nif either kind of organization does what is wrong, the increase in its\r\npower for efficiency that has resulted from the combination means the\r\nincrease in its power to do harm; and that, therefore, corporation—that\r\nis, organized capital—and union—that is, organized labor—must alike be\r\nheld to a peculiar responsibility to the public at large, and that from\r\neach alike we have the right to demand not only obedience to the law,\r\nbut service to the public.\r\n\r\nThere are two sides to what I have said, and we are very apt to hear\r\nonly insistence upon one side—sometimes insistence upon one side,\r\nsometimes insistence upon the other, but not as often as we should\r\ninsistence upon both sides.\r\n\r\nI take up first the question of organized capital. When this Nation was\r\ncreated, such a thing as a modern corporation not only did not exist,\r\nbut could not be imagined. This is especially true of the great modern\r\ncorporations engaged in interstate commerce. A century ago the highways\r\nof commerce were exactly such as they had been from the days of the\r\ndawn of civilization on the banks of the Nile and in Mesopotamia. All\r\nthat could be done by waterways and by roads for wheeled vehicles\r\ndrawn by animal power had been developed to a very marked degree; but\r\nsails, oars, wheeled vehicles and beasts of burden were, as they had\r\nbeen for many thousands of years, the only means of commerce, the\r\nonly methods by which individuals or corporations engaged in commerce\r\ncould act. Under such circumstances the fathers and founders of this\r\nRepublic could not foresee, and therefore, doubly, could not provide\r\nfor, the conditions of the present day. We now have the great highways\r\nof commerce of an entirely different kind. The waterway, the road for\r\nwheeled vehicles, have sunk into absolute insignificance compared\r\nwith the railway. We therefore have for the first time in history a\r\nhighway for the commerce of all the people under the control of a\r\nprivate individual or private corporation. Now, gentlemen, let me in\r\nthe first place insist upon this fact, that we should keep ever before\r\nus that the men who have built up the great railroad systems of this\r\ncountry, like the men who have built up the other great industries of\r\nthis country, have as a rule (there are exceptions, but as a rule)\r\nmade their fortunes as incidents to benefiting and not to harming the\r\ncountry. As a rule benefit and not harm has come from their efforts,\r\nand in making fortunes for themselves they have done good to all of\r\nus. We have all benefited by the talents of the great captains of\r\nindustry. I am speaking, as I say, as a rule, with full knowledge of\r\nthe exceptions to what I say, but disregarding those exceptions in\r\nmaking a general statement. We can not afford to do damage to those\r\nmen or to those corporations, because in the first place we can not\r\nafford to do injustice to any man, rich or poor; in the next place,\r\nbecause to do such damage to them would mean widespread damage among\r\nthe wage-workers and among the general public. All of this that I have\r\nsaid I wish kept in mind steadily in appreciating what I am about to\r\nsay; for while acknowledging in the frankest manner the benefits that\r\nhave come from the development of these great industrial enterprises, I\r\nalso feel that we must recognize that the time has now come when it is\r\nessential in the interests of the public that there should be, and be\r\nexercised, an effective power of supervision and regulation over them\r\nin the interests of the public.\r\n\r\nThe State can properly deal with the corporations doing business within\r\nits own limits. The State can not deal at all with corporations doing\r\nbusiness in many different States, and it is an absurdity at once\r\nludicrous and harmful to leave it in the power of one State to create a\r\ncorporation of gigantic size which shall do all its work in a number of\r\nother States, and perhaps with the scantiest regard for their laws.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that the Federal Government must take an\r\nincreasing control over corporations. It is better that that control\r\nshould increase by degrees than that it should be assumed all at\r\nonce. But there should be, and I trust will be, no halt in the steady\r\nprogress of assuming such national control. The first step toward it\r\nshould be the adoption of a law conferring upon some executive body the\r\npower of increased supervision and regulation of the great corporations\r\nengaged primarily in interstate commerce of the railroads. My views\r\non that subject could not have been better expressed than they were\r\nexpressed yesterday by Secretary Taft in Washington, and as they were\r\nexpressed by the Attorney-General in his communication to the Senate\r\nCommittee a couple of weeks ago. I believe that the representatives\r\nof the Nation—that is, the representatives of all the people—should\r\nlodge in some executive body the power to establish a maximum rate,\r\nthe power to have that rate go into effect practically immediately,\r\nand the power to see that the provisions of the law apply in full to\r\ncompanies owning private cars and private tracks, just as much as the\r\nrailroads themselves. The courts will retain, and should retain, no\r\nmatter what the Legislature does, the power to interfere and upset\r\nany action that is confiscatory in its nature. I am well aware that\r\nthe action of such a body as I have spoken of may stop far short of\r\nconfiscation, and yet do great damage. In other words, I am well aware\r\nthat to give this power means the possibility that the power may be\r\nabused. That possibility we must face. Any power strong enough, any\r\npower which could be granted sufficiently great to be efficient, would\r\nbe sufficiently great to be harmful if abused. That is true of the\r\npower of taxation. It is perfectly possible for the body that has the\r\npower of taxation intrusted to it to use it viciously and harmfully\r\nagainst certain interests or certain classes. Nevertheless, the power\r\nmust exist. The power must be lodged in the representatives of the\r\npeople. So it is with the power of which I speak. It must exist; it\r\nmust be lodged in some body which is to give expression to the needs of\r\nthe people as a whole. The fact that it is possible that the power may\r\nbe abused is not, and can not be, an argument against placing it where\r\nwe shall have a right to expect that it will be used fairly toward all.\r\n\r\nOne thing I wish definitely understood. If the power is granted me to\r\ncreate such a board, such a commission, or to continue in power, if I\r\nso desire, a commission or board with increased powers, I shall strive\r\nto appoint and retain men who will do exactly the same justice to the\r\nrailroads as they will exact from the railroads. False hopes are always\r\nraised by any measure of reform, because there are always people who\r\nexpect the impossible. If the measure which I advocate is enacted into\r\nlaw, a good many people will expect that it will bring the millennium\r\nconsiderably nearer than will prove to be the case. The men whom I\r\nappoint to execute that law will be, so far as my ability to choose\r\nthem exists, men who will no more be frightened by an even sincere\r\npopular clamor into doing an act of injustice to any great corporation\r\nthan they will be frightened, on the other hand, into refraining from\r\ndoing an act of justice because it is against the interests of some\r\ngreat corporation. In other words, I shall strive to see that that\r\nbranch of the Government with its increased power is administered as\r\nevery branch of the Government ought to be administered—that is, in a\r\nspirit of striving to do exact justice to the men of great means just\r\nas much as, and no more than, to the man of small means.\r\n\r\nNow for the other side of the question. There have been a great many\r\nrepublics before our time, and again and again these republics have\r\nsplit upon the rock of disaster. The greatest and most dangerous rock\r\nin the course of any republic is the rock of class hatred. Sometimes\r\nin the past the republic became a republic in which one class grew to\r\ndominate over another class, so that for loyalty to the republic was\r\nsubstituted loyalty to a class. The result was in such case inevitable.\r\nIt meant disaster and ultimately the downfall of the republic, and it\r\nmattered not one whit which class became dominant; it mattered not\r\none whit whether the poor plundered the rich or the rich exploited\r\nthe poor. In either case, just as soon as the republic became one in\r\nwhich one class substituted loyalty to that class for loyalty to the\r\nrepublic, the end of the republic was at hand. No true patriot will\r\nfail to do everything in his power to prevent the growth of any such\r\nspirit in this country.\r\n\r\nThis Government is not and never shall be a government of a plutocracy.\r\nThis Government is not, and never shall be, a Government of a mob. I\r\nbelieve in corporations. They are indispensable instruments of our\r\nmodern industrialism; but I believe that they should be so supervised\r\nand regulated that they shall act for the interest of the community as\r\na whole. So I believe in unions. I am proud of the fact that I am an\r\nhonorary member of one union. But I believe that the union, like the\r\nindividual, must be held to a strict accountability to the power of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nMr. Mayor, as President of the United States, and therefore as\r\nrepresentative of the people of this country, I give you, as a matter\r\nof course, my hearty support in upholding the law, in keeping order, in\r\nputting down violence, whether by a mob or by an individual. There need\r\nnot be the slightest apprehension in the heart of the most timid that\r\never the mob spirit will triumph in this country. Those immediately\r\nresponsible for dealing with the trouble must, as I know you feel,\r\nexhaust every effort in so dealing with it before a call is made upon\r\nany outside body. But if ever the need arises, back of the city stands\r\nthe State, and back of the State stands the Nation.\r\n\r\nThere, gentlemen, is a point upon which all good Americans are one.\r\nThey are all one in the conviction, in the firm determination that\r\nthis country shall remain in the future as it has been in the past, a\r\ncountry of liberty and justice expressed through the forms of law; a\r\ncountry in which the will of the people is supreme, but in which that\r\nwill finds its expression as provided for in the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and of the several States that go to make up our Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO STRIKERS’ COMMITTEE, CHICAGO, ILL., MAY 10, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Shea_:\r\n\r\nWe are here as a committee to present to you a statement stating our\r\nposition in this controversy between the Employers’ Association and the\r\nTeamsters’ Association. We have understood that they had asked your aid\r\nfor bringing troops into Chicago. We want to present our position to\r\nyou. Mr. Quinn has the memorial.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Quinn_:\r\n\r\nIt will take about ten minutes to read this. Perhaps we had better\r\nleave it with you.\r\n\r\n_The President_, after reading the memorial:\r\n\r\nMr. Shea, Mr. Quinn, and Gentlemen:\r\n\r\nI have read the petition you have presented to me, the conclusion of\r\nwhich is a request for a hearing before any action be taken by the\r\nFederal President, relating to the Chicago strike situation. As yet no\r\nsuggestion of any kind has come to me from any source that I should\r\ntake any action. Of the merits of the case I am wholly ignorant. I have\r\nno knowledge of what the situation is, or of what steps should properly\r\nbe taken to end it. I feel, however, that in view of one statement, or\r\nseries of statements, in your letter, I ought to say this: I regret\r\nthat you should have in the letter spoken at all of the use of the\r\nFederal army as you have there spoken. No request has been made to me\r\nfor action by the Federal Government, but at the same time, Mr. Shea,\r\nas you have in this communication to me brought up that fact, I want to\r\nsay one thing with all the emphasis in my power. In upholding law and\r\norder, in doing what he is able to do to suppress mob violence in any\r\nshape or way, the Mayor of Chicago, Mayor Dunne, has my hearty support.\r\nI am glad to be able to say this to you gentlemen before I say it to\r\nany other body. Now let me repeat that I know nothing of the facts of\r\nthe situation. I know nothing of the rights or wrongs of the points at\r\nissue. What I have to say is based purely upon what I regard as the\r\nunfortunate phrasing of a letter presented to the President of the\r\nUnited States. I have not been called upon to interfere in any way,\r\nbut you must not misunderstand my attitude. In every effort of Mayor\r\nDunne to prevent violence by mobs or individuals, to see that the laws\r\nare obeyed and that order is preserved, he has the hearty support of\r\nthe President of the United States, and in my judgment he should have\r\nthat of every good citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, it has been a great pleasure to see you, and I am glad\r\nto have had the chance to say this to you.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Quinn_:\r\n\r\nMr. President, what prompted us to come to you with this statement is\r\nthat for the past two or three weeks there has been a continual howl\r\nfor the Federal army. I have known you long enough to know that you\r\nwould not respond to a one-sided demand, that you will not respond\r\nuntil you have thoroughly investigated the case.\r\n\r\n_The President_:\r\n\r\nMr. Quinn, as yet the Mayor has not made any appeal to the Governor,\r\nand therefore, of course, the Governor has made none to me; and as yet\r\nnothing in the situation has demanded action by me.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Shea_:\r\n\r\nLet me explain that. The Governor has been requested by the committee\r\nof the employers to demand Federal troops. The statement has been made\r\nin the papers. I immediately telegraphed Governor Deneen that we would\r\nallow him to appoint a commission.\r\n\r\nRegardless of that I want to make our position known to you in regard\r\nto mob violence. Every time a mob congregates, every act of violence\r\nperformed by either a union man or a sympathizer, it reacts to our\r\ndetriment. I believe that we are skilled workmen enough in our\r\nparticular craft to demonstrate to our business men of Chicago that\r\nit is to their interest to employ us. There is nothing at stake but\r\nthe re-employment of citizens of Chicago who have been forced out of\r\ntheir positions. Acts of violence meet with the condemnation of the\r\nofficials, both local and national, of our organization. It does not\r\nmeet with the sympathies of our organization. I simply want to say that\r\nwe want to be fair, to preserve the business interests of Chicago,\r\nrealizing that the prosperity of our employers is our prosperity.\r\n\r\n_The President_:\r\n\r\nMr. Shea, I can only repeat what I have said. I am a believer in\r\nunions. I am an honorary member of one union. But the union must obey\r\nthe law just as the corporation must obey the law, just as every man,\r\nrich or poor, must obey the law. As yet no action whatever has been\r\ncalled for by me, and most certainly if action is called for by me I\r\nshall try to do exact justice under the law to every man, so far as\r\nI have power. But the first essential is the preservation of law and\r\norder, the suppression of violence by mobs or individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE UNVEILING OF THE STATUE OF GENERAL HENRY W. SLOCUM,\r\n  BROOKLYN, N. Y., MAY 30, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mayor, Mr. Commissioner, and you, my Fellow Citizens, and, above\r\n  all, you who took part in the great war in which the man whose statue\r\n  is raised to-day won for himself and his country renown and honor_:\r\n\r\nDay before yesterday I listened to a sermon in which the preacher,\r\ndwelling upon the exercises to be held throughout the Union to-day,\r\npreached on the text which tells of the altar raised by command of\r\nMoses to commemorate the victory gained by the children of Israel over\r\nthe wild tribes of the desert who sought to bar their march toward\r\nthe promised land. Amalek came out against Israel and they fought all\r\nday, while Aaron and Hur upheld the hands of Moses until as night fell\r\nthe sun went down on Israel’s triumph. Then they raised an altar to\r\n“Jehovah is my banner”; to Jehovah, who stood as the exponent of the\r\nprinciple for which Israel warred. They raised it to the principle of\r\nrighteousness, which alone can justify any war or any struggle. Mr.\r\nMayor, that is the thought that you developed in the excellent address\r\nto which we have just listened; that we meet to-day to commemorate\r\na great victory, the triumph of the cause of union and liberty, not\r\nprimarily because it was a mere victory, but because it was a victory\r\nfor righteousness and for the peace and liberty and eternal spiritual\r\nwelfare of mankind.\r\n\r\nI see before me here men who won high honor serving as comrades in arms\r\nof General Slocum, and I know that there exists in the Union no men who\r\nwill appreciate more the fact that now, forty years after the war, the\r\ncrowning triumph of what they did is to be found in the fact that we\r\nhave a genuinely reunited country, a country in which the man who wore\r\nthe blue stretches out the hand of loyal friendship to his erstwhile\r\nfoe, his now devoted friend and fellow-countryman, the man who wore\r\nthe gray. A short while ago I passed through the great State of Texas.\r\nWherever I stopped in that great State I was greeted by representatives\r\nof the Grand Army marching side by side with or intermingled with men\r\nclad in the gray uniform that showed that they had fought in the armies\r\nof the Confederacy. They had tested one another’s worth on the stricken\r\nfields, they knew each that the other had been ready when the hour of\r\nsupreme appeal came to show his truth by his endeavors. Now these men,\r\nnow you and those like you, now the men in blue and the men in gray,\r\nknow that they leave to their children and their children’s children as\r\na heritage of honor forever the memory of the great deeds done alike by\r\nthose who fought under Grant and by those who fought under Lee; for we,\r\nbecause of the very fact that the Union triumphed now have the right\r\nto feel a like pride in the valor and devotion of those who valiantly\r\nfought against the stars in their courses, no less than of those who\r\nfinally saw their efforts and their sufferings crowned by triumph.\r\n\r\nThink of it, my fellow-countrymen! Think of what a thrice-blessed\r\nfortune is ours, that the greatest war that the nineteenth century\r\nsaw after the close of the Napoleonic struggles has left, not as most\r\nwars inevitably do and must leave, memories of bitterness and anger\r\nand shame to offset the memories of glory, memories which make the men\r\nof one side hang their heads because the men of the other side walk\r\nexultingly; that it has left not such dreadful memories, but instead\r\nto victor and vanquished alike, after the temporary soreness is over,\r\nthe same right to feel the proudest satisfaction in the fact that the\r\nUnion was saved, and the utmost pride in the honor, the gallantry, the\r\ndevotion to the right as each side had given it the light to see the\r\nright, shown alike by those who warred under one banner and by those\r\nwho warred under the other.\r\n\r\nI congratulate the people of Brooklyn, not primarily upon raising\r\nthis statue, because that they ought to do, but upon the opportunity,\r\nupon the chance of having it to raise. I congratulate them upon the\r\ngood fortune of having a fellow-citizen who in war and in peace alike\r\nserved his people so well as to make it their duty, not so much to\r\nhim as to themselves, to erect this statue that it might serve as a\r\nlesson for the generations to come. And, my fellow-citizens, I am sure\r\nwe all realize the peculiar appropriateness of having the statue of\r\nGeneral Slocum received on behalf of the city of New York by its chief\r\nmagistrate, whose father was General Slocum’s illustrious commander.\r\n\r\nSurely there is need for me to say but little in emphasis of what has\r\nbeen set forth before I began to speak as to the prime significance\r\nof General Slocum’s career. He was a fine soldier, a gallant and able\r\ncommander. Once the war was over he turned as whole-heartedly to\r\nthe pursuits of peace as he had during the war turned to the strife\r\nof arms. General Slocum was one of those men on whose career we are\r\nfortunately able to dwell in its entirety. We do not have to dwell\r\nwith emphasis on part of it because we do not care to speak of another\r\npart of it. We are able to point to General Slocum as the type of what\r\na decent American citizen should be, as a man who was an example in\r\nhis family life, an example in his business relations, an honest and\r\nupright public servant, no less than a tried and fearless soldier.\r\n\r\nNow I want our people to remember the two sides of the lesson taught\r\nby General Slocum’s life. A successful war for unrighteousness is the\r\nmost dreadful of all things; it is the thing that sets back more than\r\naught else the course of civilization. But no people worth preserving\r\never existed or will exist that was not able to fight well if the\r\nneed arose. So it is with the individual. The man who possesses great\r\nability and great courage unaccompanied by the moral sense, a courage\r\nand ability unguided by the stern purpose to do what is just and\r\nupright, that man is rendered by the very fact of his courage and\r\nability only so much the greater menace to the community in which he\r\nunfortunately dwells. We can not afford as a people ever to forget for\r\none moment that ability, farsightedness, iron resolution, perseverance,\r\nwillingness to do and dare, are qualities to be admired only if they\r\nare put at the service of the right, at the service of decency and of\r\njustice. The man who possesses those qualities and does not shape his\r\ncourse by a fundamental and underlying moral principle is a menace to\r\neach and all of us; and thrice foolish, thrice wicked is the other man\r\nwho condones his moral shortcomings because of his intellectual or\r\nphysical strength and prowess.\r\n\r\nBut it is equally important to remember that no amount of good\r\nintention, no amount of sweetness and light, no amount of appreciation\r\nof decency avails in the least in the rough work of the world as we\r\nfind it, unless back of the honesty of purpose, back of the decency\r\nof life and thought, lies the power that makes a man a man. This is\r\ntrue of the individual and it is true of the Nation. It is absolutely\r\nessential that this Nation, if it is to hold the position in the future\r\nthat it has held in the past, must act not only within but without\r\nits own borders in a spirit of justice and of large generosity toward\r\nall other peoples. We owe this as an obligation to ourselves, we owe\r\nit as an obligation to all mankind. More and more as we increase in\r\nstrength I hope to see a corresponding increase in the sober sense\r\nof responsibility which shall prevent us either injuring or insulting\r\nany other people. You may notice that I said “insulting” as well as\r\n“injuring.” If there is one quality sometimes shown among us which\r\nis not commendable it is the habit of speaking loosely about foreign\r\npowers, foreign races. You do not need any of you to be told that\r\nin private life you will often resent an insult quite as much as an\r\ninjury; and our public speakers and writers need to steadily keep\r\nbefore their minds the thought that no possible good can come to us by\r\nspeaking offensively of any one else; while trouble may come.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that the surest way for a nation to invite\r\ndisaster is to be opulent, aggressive, and unarmed. Now, we are\r\nopulent, and I hope we shall remain so. I trust that we shall never be\r\naggressive unless aggression is not merely justified, but demanded;\r\ndemanded either by our own self-respect or by the interests of mankind.\r\nBut above all, let us remember that to be aggressive in speech or act,\r\nand not to be armed, invites not merely disaster, but the contempt of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nBrooklyn not only furnished valiant soldiers to the Civil War, but it\r\nfurnished in time of peace a most excellent Secretary of the Navy of\r\nthe United States, General Tracy. If our navy is good enough, we have\r\na long career of peace before us. The only likelihood of trouble ever\r\ncoming to us as a nation will arise if we let our navy become too small\r\nor inefficient. A first-class navy—first-class in point of size, above\r\nall first-class in point of efficiency of the individual units acting\r\nas units and in combination—is the surest and the cheapest guarantee\r\nof peace. I should think that any man looking at what is happening and\r\nwhat has happened abroad and in our own history during the past few\r\nyears, must be indeed blind if he can not read that lesson clearly.\r\n\r\nGeneral Slocum did his first great public service when the crisis\r\ncalled not primarily for the softer and milder, but for the sterner and\r\nharder virtues; and we can not afford in this day of material luxury,\r\nin this day when civilization tends to make life easy, to ignore those\r\nhard and stern virtues. In the workaday world as it is, not only in\r\nwar, but in private life and in public life alike, a man has to have\r\ntoughness of fibre or he can not put into effect even the best of\r\nintentions. We can not afford to let the generation that is coming grow\r\nup with the feeling that any quality will serve as a substitute for the\r\nold, essential qualities of manliness in a man and womanliness in a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nMuch, very much, has been done in this country by education. No one\r\ncan overstate the debt that this country is under to the educators;\r\nbut in taking advantage of all the improved methods let us not forget\r\nthat there are certain qualities which are not new, which are eternal\r\nbecause they are eternally true, the failure to develop which will\r\ncause a loss that can not be offset by any merely intellectual or\r\nmental gain. A sound body is a first-class thing, a sound mind is\r\nan even better thing, but the thing that counts for most in the\r\nindividual as in the Nation is character—the sum of those qualities\r\nwhich make a man a good man and a woman a good woman. You men of the\r\nCivil War, you men to whom this country owes more than to any others,\r\nno matter how great the service of those others may be (because to you\r\nthis country owes its life), you won the place you did, you won for\r\nthis country its salvation, because you had in you those qualities\r\nwhich in the aggregate we know by the name of character, the qualities\r\nwhich made you put material gain, material well-being, not merely\r\nbelow, but immeasurably below devotion to an ideal, when the crisis\r\ncalled for showing your manhood.\r\n\r\nYou went to the war leaving those behind who would make more money, but\r\ncarrying with you in your hearts the honor and the future of a mighty\r\nNation. You had, in the first place, the right spirit, and then you had\r\nthe quality of making that spirit evident in the time of need. If you\r\nhad not had patriotism, devotion to the country and to the flag, you\r\ncould have done nothing. But you could not have done much more if your\r\npatriotism, your devotion to the flag, had not been backed up by the\r\npower to show that your metal rang true in battle.\r\n\r\nYou showed in times that tried men’s souls what this country has a\r\nright to expect from its sons. You had the supreme good fortune to test\r\nyour manhood in one of the two great crises of the Nation’s history,\r\nthe great crisis in which the Nation was born in the days of 1776, and\r\nthe no less great crisis in which the Nation was saved by the men of\r\n1861. You have left us not merely a reunited country, but you have\r\nleft us the glorious heritage of the memory of the exploits, of the\r\nqualities by which the country was left reunited.\r\n\r\nOur days have fallen, for our good fortune, in times of peace. We have\r\nnot had to show the qualities that you showed in the dark years that\r\nclosed in the sunburst of Appomattox; but if we are to leave undimmed\r\nto our children the heritage that you left to us, we must show in\r\npeace, and, should the need ever arise, in war also, the qualities that\r\nyou showed; the qualities that make it now the pleasantest of all tasks\r\nfor a public servant who appreciates the greatness of America to come\r\non an occasion like this and see the people of a great city dedicate\r\na monument in honor of a great citizen, who, at every point of his\r\ncareer, illustrated what the name American should be when it is used in\r\nits highest, its deepest, and its best significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE NAVAL BRANCH, Y. M. C. A., BROOKLYN, N. Y., MAY 30, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Officers and Enlisted Men of the United States Navy; and you, Friends\r\n  of the Navy, for if you are good Americans, you can be nothing else_:\r\n\r\nI made up my mind to-day that, although there were very many\r\ninvitations extended to me in addition to that because of which I first\r\nagreed to come here, there was just one which I could not refuse, and\r\nthat was to come to this building and meet you here. I do not have\r\nto tell you that I believe in the navy of the United States with all\r\nmy heart, and that I believe in that which counts most in the navy,\r\nthe officers and enlisted men, the man behind the gun; the man in the\r\nconning tower, in the gun turret, in the engine room, the man, wherever\r\nhe is, if he is doing his duty.\r\n\r\nWe owe a peculiar debt of gratitude to those who have taken the lead\r\nin securing this building. The people of the United States should make\r\nit their especial duty to see to the welfare, moral even more than\r\nphysical, of the men upon whose exertions, upon whose skill, training,\r\nand prowess, upon whose character in time of crisis the honor of the\r\nentire Nation will depend. All respect is due to those who, led by Miss\r\nGould, have erected this building, who have given expression to the\r\nspirit which lies behind the building up of everything of this nature.\r\nIt shows that we are fortunately past the period when we are afraid\r\nthat if we make a man too decent he will not fight well enough.\r\n\r\nI have had a good deal of experience in civil life, and I have never\r\nyet found any job in civil life to which, other things being equal, I\r\ndid not prefer to appoint a man who had seen service in the navy or\r\narmy of the United States; because he has learned, if he is worth his\r\nsalt, certain qualities which double and treble his value in whatever\r\nposition he may be put. Therefore, not only for his sake do we owe it\r\nto him to see that he has every chance to lead a wholesome and manly\r\nlife, but we owe it to ourselves, we owe it to the Nation of which we\r\nare all part, to see that that man’s capacities for good are given the\r\nfullest chance for development. And much though I believe in the Y. M.\r\nC. A., and in kindred organizations generally, I believe in them most\r\nwhen they take such shape as this.\r\n\r\nNow, a special word to you upon whom so heavy a responsibility rests;\r\nbecause it depends upon the way you do your duty in peace as to whether\r\nor not, should ever the need for war arise, our flag will receive\r\ncredit or discredit at your hands, or at the hands of your successors.\r\nI can not too often say, in speaking to civilians, what every naval man\r\nknows, that in battle those win who have prepared best for the battle\r\nbeforehand. I have seen to-day men who fought at Manila and men who\r\nfought off Santiago. In both places we won, and we won hands down. We\r\nwon because the shots that hit were those that counted; because the men\r\non our ships knew how to handle them alone and in squadron, knew how\r\nto get the best speed out of them, and how to do decent shooting with\r\nthem. I want you to notice I said decent shooting. I did not say it was\r\nfirst-class. I think most of you are doing first-class shooting now;\r\nand I would be mightily ashamed of you if you did not do better than\r\nwas done seven years ago; and I shall be ashamed of you if you don’t do\r\neven better in the future.\r\n\r\nNothing has given Americans a better right to satisfaction than the\r\nway in which the target practice of the average American ship has\r\nimproved, until I think we can fairly say that there are certain gun\r\ncrews and certain individual gun pointers who have reached as high a\r\ndegree of excellence as it is possible for any man to reach. The gun\r\ncrew counts for more than its individual pointer. You might have all\r\nthe individual shots you could gather, and they would not be worth\r\na rap if they could not act together, if they did not act so as to\r\nsubordinate in the mind of each man the success of that particular man\r\nto the success for which they all stood.\r\n\r\nMore and more our people are waking up to the need of a navy. I think\r\nin view of events now happening all over the world that we can count\r\nupon having Congress continue to build up our navy. It is all-important\r\nthat we should have ships, the best in hull, the best in armor, the\r\nbest in armament, of any nation in the world. But there is something\r\nthat is more important still, and that is the character of you men to\r\nwhom I am speaking here, and of your comrades in the navy. You can\r\ndo nothing without the proper training, but the training will not do\r\nvery much if there is not the right stuff in you to train. I wish a\r\nbig navy; but I wish still more a navy first class for its size. Every\r\nwarship which is not first class in efficiency becomes in battle not a\r\nhelp to the Nation, but a menace to the national honor. If the officers\r\nand enlisted men are not trained to the highest point, then the best\r\nships are useless; and it is better to have none than to have useless\r\nships.\r\n\r\nI believe in the navy of the United States, primarily because I\r\nbelieve in the intelligence, the patriotism, and the fighting edge of\r\nthe average man of the navy. Often it needs a tragedy to bring out\r\nthe qualities that are in a man. You remember the dreadful accident\r\naboard the battleship “Missouri” a year ago. Lamentable and terrible\r\nthough it was, there were things connected with it that should make\r\nevery American feel a sense of proud confidence in the officers and\r\nenlisted men in whom Uncle Sam confides his honor. When that accident\r\noccurred in the turret there were some twenty minutes when every man\r\nof that ship knew that any moment the ship might sink. But there was\r\nnot a touch of nervousness among the crew. The men went quietly to\r\ntheir quarters and stayed there and waited, cool and resolute, to meet\r\nwhatever was in store for them; while those whose duty had put them in\r\nthe turret, or called them thither, showed genuine heroism. Each man\r\nshowed the quality which makes us reasonably confident that in war the\r\nmen at the quickfire guns can hit a torpedo boat; and which makes me\r\nreasonably confident that the greater the punishment suffered on the\r\nship, the straighter you would shoot back. In other words, I believe\r\nyou have the coolness, the courage, the endurance, the fighting edge.\r\nWhen the accident occurred on the “Missouri” it was the turn of the\r\n“Texas” to go out to target practice. The “Texas” sent her boats over\r\nto find out if the “Missouri” needed help, and found that she did not;\r\nthen she steamed out to target practice and made the best record at\r\ntarget practice that had been made by any ship in our fleet at that\r\ntime. The men aboard her were not rattled; what had happened merely\r\nkeyed them to a higher pitch of effort.\r\n\r\nI feel that too much can not be said to impress upon you the\r\nall-importance of the work that you are doing. Even if you yourselves\r\nnever go into battle, you create the spirit which makes those who come\r\nafter you on the ships able to do their duty in battle. The time of\r\npeace is the time when we must make ready for war, should war come. I\r\ndo not think we will have any war if we have a good enough navy; and\r\nI could appeal to any peace society in the land for support upon the\r\nground that every first-class record of target practice in the American\r\nnavy is a positive provocative of peace and not of war. I am speaking\r\nto the men who, more than any others in this country, do most for\r\npeace. You are doing it and you will continue to do it only by fitting\r\nyourselves in every way to be ready for war, if war should come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE GRADUATING EXERCISES OF THE COLLEGIATE DEPARTMENT OF CLARK\r\n  UNIVERSITY, WORCESTER, MASS., JUNE 21, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is incumbent upon every citizen of this country to do the\r\nbest that is in him, not only for his own sake, and the sake of\r\nthose immediately connected with him, but for the sake of the people\r\nas a whole, it is especially incumbent upon the graduates of such\r\nan institution of learning as this. Every man that graduates here\r\nhas received something, and something big, for which he has made no\r\nreturn, and for which he can never make any return to the men giving\r\nit. It is given in part by those who are dead and in part by those\r\nwho are living, but who can not ever receive any reward for that they\r\nhave themselves done. You graduates can not pay back directly to\r\nthe founder, to the trustees, to the president, to the professors,\r\nwhat they have done in money and effort for you. There is just one\r\nway and only one way in which you can give back to the college, to\r\nthe university, what you have received from the college, from the\r\nuniversity, and that is by so leading your lives in point of purpose\r\nand in point of efficiency as to reflect honor upon those who did so\r\nmuch for you, to show that they were right in doing what they did, and\r\nthat their effort was not wasted when they gave you this great chance.\r\nEvery college man owes a debt of gratitude to his college, which he can\r\npay in but one way, and that is by the way in which through his life he\r\nmakes that college stand in the estimation of the public.\r\n\r\nIt is true of the Nation, as of the individual, that the greatest doer\r\nmust also be a great dreamer. Of course, if the dream is not followed\r\nby action, then it is a bubble; it has merely served to divert the man\r\nfrom doing something. But great action, action that is really great,\r\ncan not take place if the man has it not in his brain to think great\r\nthoughts, to dream great dreams. As has been so well pointed out\r\nto-day, the marvelous rise of Germany in the world of industry and of\r\ncommerce, no less than of art and of letters, has been due to the fact\r\nthat the German is trained to have high ideals, and yet to treat these\r\nideals in practical fashion. I was immensely struck, as I think all of\r\nus must have been struck, by the way in which, a few weeks ago, our\r\nfellow-citizens of German birth or descent took part in commemorating\r\nthe life and writings of Schiller. I feel strongly, as the president\r\nof Amherst has phrased it, that here in this country, where we are\r\namalgamating into one people many different peoples of many different\r\ntongues, one of the great works to which we should devote our attention\r\nis trying to keep what each of these peoples can give of value to our\r\ncomposite national life. Each race that comes here, each element, can\r\ncontribute something of value, can usually contribute very much of\r\nvalue; and it would be a good thing for all of our people if we should\r\nshape our development so that it would seem as natural to us as it does\r\nto the people of Germany to recognize the incalculable debt of a nation\r\nto a writer like Schiller, to a man who has done work for the public,\r\nfor the nation, for all mankind, upon which no price can be put. From\r\nGermany this country has learned much. Germany has contributed a great\r\nelement to the blood of our people, and it has given the most marked\r\ntrend ever given to our scholastic and university system, to the whole\r\nsystem of training students and scholars. In taking what we should\r\nfrom Germany, from this great kindred nation, I wish that we could take\r\nespecially the idealism which renders it natural to them to celebrate\r\nsuch an event as Schiller’s life and writings; and also the keen,\r\npractical common-sense which enables them to turn their idealistic\r\nspirit into an instrument for producing the most perfect military and\r\nindustrial organizations that this world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nMr. Mabie has said that character counts most; of course it counts\r\nmost. I believe in a sound body, I believe in a sound mind. I believe\r\nin character a great deal more than in either; and I believe in both\r\nthe body and the mind chiefly as the foundation for the character.\r\nI remember when I was Governor, and had some correspondence with\r\nPresident Hall, I found to my great pleasure that he took the views\r\nthat I did on the subject of boxing, he feeling as strongly as I felt\r\nthat we did not want to produce in institutions of learning a race of\r\nnice, clever, well-bred young men, who can not hold their own in the\r\nrough work of the world. I do not give a snap of my finger for the\r\nyoung fellow who is afraid of being hurt physically, or in any other\r\nway; he is not going to amount to anything in after life. Each of you\r\nas you lead your lives will be hurt a good deal; if you have any pluck\r\nin you at all you will face the punishment, take it, and win out in\r\nspite of it. I want to see the physical development, more because of\r\nits moral side than for any other reason. I want to see the intellect\r\ndeveloped only in so far as it is controlled by conscience, by a sense\r\nof right and wrong. The better educated a man is the more dangerous he\r\nis if he has no conscience. In these universities the benefit comes\r\nfrom the education of a man’s character as well as of his intellect.\r\n\r\nI hope most earnestly for the day when we shall see peace prevail among\r\nthe nations of mankind; and peace, industrial as well as military,\r\nprevail within the nations themselves. No man in public position can,\r\nunder penalty of forfeiting the right to the respect of those whose\r\nregard he most values, fail as the opportunity comes to do all that\r\nin him lies for peace. But peace of a valuable type comes not to the\r\nman who craves it because he is afraid, but to the man who demands it\r\nbecause it is right. The peace granted contemptuously to the weakling\r\nand the coward is but a poor boon after it has been granted.\r\n\r\nWe must keep our minds upon the essentials and not upon the\r\nnon-essentials. In 1861 there were people who cried peace, peace,\r\nwho said that any peace, no matter how shameful, was preferable to\r\nthe worst of all wars—a fratricidal war; and if those people had had\r\ntheir way we should now be hanging our heads in shame. We should now\r\nbe feeling that the country founded by Washington, the country that at\r\nthat time was perpetuated by Lincoln, had gone down in the wreck of\r\nirretrievable disaster. We got peace then, peace forever, as I believe,\r\nin this country, because there were a sufficient number of men who felt\r\nas President Wright felt and went to the war to fight for permanent\r\npeace. I have scant patience with the brawler, the quarreler, the\r\nswashbuckler, and I have a little less for the anæmic person, either of\r\nbody or soul, who believes that a nation any more than an individual\r\ncan afford to put peace before justice. Put justice first; it will\r\ngenerally lead to peace; but follow it wherever it leads.\r\n\r\nIn closing, let me say just one more thing. The same homely virtues\r\napply in managing the life of a nation as in managing an individual’s\r\nlife. All the statesman needs to do is to exercise common-sense and\r\nstick as close to the Decalogue and the Golden Rule as imperfect human\r\nnature will permit. In other words, he needs to carry himself in\r\npublic life as he would in private life, and never permit the mistake\r\nbeing made of divorcing public from private morality any more than of\r\ndivorcing domestic from business morality. The man is a poor citizen,\r\nno matter how high he stands in the church, whose allegiance to the\r\nteachings of the church is limited to his home and to Sunday, and is\r\nnot carried into his work or his business. The man is a poor citizen\r\nwho does not do his best to see that the affairs of his country, both\r\nas regards the country’s attitude to other nations, and as regards\r\nthe country’s dealings with matters vital to its own citizens within\r\nits limits, are managed along the same lines—the old simple lines of\r\nhonesty, courage, and common-sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT HOLY CROSS COLLEGE, WORCESTER, MASS., JUNE 21, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Father, Bishop, Alumni of Holy Cross, and you, My Fellow-Citizens, men\r\n  and women of Worcester, of Massachusetts_:\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to me to be the guest of Holy Cross. It is eminently\r\ncharacteristic of your State, and of all our Nation, that we should\r\nhave institutions of learning like this, in which the effort is\r\nconstant to train not merely the body and the mind, but the soul of the\r\nman, so that he may be a good American, a good citizen of our great\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn this country of ours we are developing a new type of nationality,\r\na type kin to each of the various Old World races from which it in\r\npart springs, and yet separate from all. Each stock that comes here\r\ncan furnish something of permanent value to the country as a whole;\r\nand from each stock we have the right to expect the furnishing of that\r\nelement. Here in Holy Cross College I want to say one word spoken I\r\ntrust to ears willing to hear it. During the last three years I have\r\nhappened, by chance, to grow peculiarly interested in the great subject\r\nof Celtic literature, and I feel that it is not a creditable thing to\r\nthe American Republic, which has in its citizenship so large a Celtic\r\nelement, that we should leave it to the German scholars and students\r\nto be our instructors in Celtic literature. I want to see in Holy\r\nCross, in Harvard, in all the other universities where we can get the\r\nchairs endowed, chairs for the study of Celtic literature. A century\r\nand over ago the civilized world, which had been looking down upon old\r\nNorse poetry as the production of a barbarous race, suddenly awoke\r\nto the wealth of beauty contained in the Scandinavian sagas. If I am\r\nnot greatly in error we are now about to see a similar awakening to\r\nthe wealth of beauty contained in the Celtic sagas; and I wish to see\r\nAmerican institutions of learning take the lead in that awakening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT WILLIAMS COLLEGE, WILLIAMSTOWN, MASS., JUNE 22, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. President, and you of Williams_:\r\n\r\nIt is a high honor that I have received at your hands, and I deeply\r\nappreciate it. I appreciate it particularly because it is my good\r\nfortune to find on the platform with me so many men to whom I am knit\r\nby the bonds of personal friendship and of work for a common end. I\r\nhave listened with real pleasure to the three discourses to-day; and of\r\ncourse the first was in my line of business.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of what I had intended to say here to-day, I want to\r\nsay a word just suggested by that address on “idealism in politics.” I\r\nwish to see every graduate of this college, and every graduate of every\r\nother college in the land, feel (and I thank the speaker for the way he\r\nemphasized it) the need of ideals in business and in law, quite as much\r\nas in politics. I wish to see every graduate do all that in him lies to\r\nuphold a standard of practical idealism in after life. I was struck\r\nand amused by the sentence in which the speaker said that at present if\r\nyou spoke of ideals, you met with the answer, “Oh, yes, that is very\r\npretty in theory, but it won’t work in Troy!” There are two sides to\r\nthat. In the first place, it is a bad thing for Troy if Troy will not\r\nstand idealism; and in the next place it is a poor type of ideal that\r\nis of no use in Troy. I want you to remember the last just as much as\r\nthe first. I want you to have high ideals, but practical ideals. I do\r\nnot want you ever to get into a frame of mind which we see pretty often\r\nin the world at large, which believes that you can only have either\r\nhigh or fantastic ideals, or else low and practical ones. If you have\r\nto choose, of course I would a great deal rather see you choose high\r\nand fantastic ideals than low and practical ones, because the last are\r\na detriment to the Nation at large, while the first are merely of no\r\nearthly consequence. If you have to choose between being noxious and\r\nbeing merely harmless, of course, choose to be harmless. But do not\r\nexpect very great gratitude from any person interested in the country\r\nif you choose merely to be harmless. If you choose to have high ideals\r\nso fantastic that they are of no use when you try to apply them in\r\npractical life, do not for one moment delude yourself into the belief\r\nthat to have these fantastic ideals shows that you are more virtuous\r\nthan the man who has not got them. It merely shows that you are more\r\nfoolish. Have a high ideal and try to realize it, measurably, within\r\nyour powers, as, immeasurably and with tremendous power, Abraham\r\nLincoln and George Washington strove to realize their ideals. Have\r\nhigh ideals, and then try to realize them in practical shape. I do not\r\nwant to see you go out of this institution of learning with an ideal\r\nimpossible to put into effect, because I am afraid if you leave it with\r\nsuch an ideal and find that this ideal does not work, then instead of\r\nrealizing that the fault lies in you for having chosen that kind of an\r\nideal, you will think it lies with idealism itself, and will abandon\r\nidealism. What I desire to see you feel is that you must have a high\r\nideal; that you must also apply that ideal in practice; and above all\r\nthings to avoid the state of mind in which you preach an impossible\r\nidealism, and make amends for it by not practicing any idealism at all.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true that you want to avoid improper compromises,\r\nbut you will not get any other, if you are not able to compromise in\r\nnon-essential matters. I do not suppose there is one of these men\r\non this platform—Mr. Root, Mr. Choate, Senator Crane—who has not\r\ndisagreed with me on some pretty important points, ranging from the\r\nnavy to corporations. But we have been able to come to a working\r\nagreement. We have been able to establish a basis for common action,\r\nnot by surrendering on matters of principle, but by agreeing each to\r\nsubordinate his views on certain points, so that we could secure the\r\nefficiency of action that can only come from united effort. I want you\r\nto feel that to accomplish anything in after life, you men who are\r\njust going out into the great world, you must keep ever before your\r\nminds both the desire to work for betterment, and the power to work in\r\ncombination with your fellows (who will not on all points agree with\r\nyou) practically to achieve that betterment.\r\n\r\nIn striving to solve the immediate governmental problems that are\r\nbefore us, we have a right to expect leadership from the men who come\r\nout of Williams, who come out of the other colleges and universities of\r\nthe land; we have a right to expect that leadership to be shown with\r\npractical efficiency, in seeing that this Nation does its duty abroad\r\nand at home. I wish to see this Nation not merely talk for peace and\r\nrighteousness, but act for peace and righteousness; but I wish to see\r\nthis Nation stand for righteousness first and then for peace. I wish to\r\nsee the Nation stand for the peace of justice, for the righteousness in\r\nthe attainment of which peace is normally a potent instrument, but for\r\nwhich we must stand, whether peace comes or not. In 1861, there were\r\nmen who cried peace, peace, when there was no peace; and we have peace\r\nnow combined with righteousness, and have secured it, as I believe,\r\nfor ages to come on this continent, because men then dared to draw the\r\nsword for righteousness. We have no such terrible crisis as that of\r\n1861 facing us now. On the contrary, we have a series of rather humdrum\r\nlittle crises which it is sometimes exasperating to have to face, but\r\nwhich we must.\r\n\r\nThe particular small crisis of which I am thinking is that in Santo\r\nDomingo last year. I had done everything that in me lay to prevent\r\nthat crisis coming. All I asked, on behalf of the people of the United\r\nStates, of Santo Domingo was that it should be good and happy. Without\r\nentering into the ethical question, I shall merely say that it was not\r\nhappy. Finally affairs grew into such shape down there that it was\r\nevident that the bonds of society were on the point of dissolution;\r\nand the Government of Santo Domingo made an earnest appeal to the\r\nGovernment of the United States and asked that this Nation, out of the\r\nabundance of its strength, should strive to help a weaker brother. Now\r\ndo not forget that that was the appeal, and that it was because of\r\nthis appeal that we took action. There were of course two motives that\r\ninfluenced us. One was the desire to help the people of Santo Domingo\r\nfor their own sakes, and the other, and a legitimate one, was to try\r\nto fend off the possibility of trouble coming to Santo Domingo, which\r\nmight bring the United States itself into trouble. The debts of Santo\r\nDomingo were so great and the impossibility of paying all those debts\r\nso patent that there was a threat of imminent interference by foreign\r\nnations to collect the debts due their own citizens. And as the only\r\nway of guaranteeing the collection of those debts was to seize the\r\ncustom-houses, it inevitably meant the seizure nominally, temporarily,\r\nof a certain amount of Santo Domingo territory, which would almost\r\ninevitably produce a conflict between us and those foreign governments.\r\nSo, in the interest of the peace of the world, and in the interest of\r\njustice to Santo Domingo, we yielded to Santo Domingo’s request and\r\nhave started to try to help her so to carry on her finances that she\r\nmay be able to pay all that she can of what she justly owes. In taking\r\nthat action the Government has proceeded upon the theory that you\r\ncan not formulate a right, individual or national, without impliedly\r\nformulating a responsibility and obligation to go with that right.\r\n\r\nWe say that in our own interest and in the interest of the peoples\r\nof the Western Hemisphere we adhere to the Monroe Doctrine. With the\r\npromulgation of that doctrine must go the responsibility that ought by\r\nright to accompany it. We can not say that other peoples shall not do\r\nwhat ought to be done, unless we do it ourselves. People answer that\r\ntrouble and bother will come if we do it. If this Nation refuses to do\r\nits duty because it thinks the duty will necessitate encountering some\r\ntrouble, some bother, then let this Nation cease to claim to be great.\r\nI demand that the Nation do its duty, and accept the responsibility\r\nthat must go with greatness. I ask that the Nation dare to be great,\r\nand that in daring to be great it show that it knows how to do justice\r\nto the weak no less than to exact justice from the strong. In order to\r\ntake such a position of being a great Nation, the one thing that we\r\nmust not do is to bluff. It is perhaps defensible, although I think\r\nimproper, to say that we will not try to be a big Nation, will not try\r\nto play the part of a big Nation or act as such in the world. But the\r\nunpardonable thing is to say we will act as a big Nation and then\r\ndecline to take the necessary steps to make the words good. Therefore,\r\ngentlemen, see to it that the navy is built up, and kept at the highest\r\npoint of efficiency. I ask that, not in the interest of war, but as a\r\nguarantee of peace. I believe in the Monroe Doctrine; I believe in the\r\nbuilding and maintaining as an open highway for the nations of mankind\r\nthe Panama Canal. But I had a great deal rather see this country\r\nabandon the Monroe Doctrine and give up all thought of building the\r\nPanama Canal than to see it attempt to maintain the one and construct\r\nthe other while refusing to provide the means which can alone render\r\nour attitude as a Nation worthy of the respect of the other nations\r\nof mankind. Keep on building and maintaining at the highest point of\r\nefficiency the United States navy, or quit trying to be a big Nation.\r\nDo one or the other.\r\n\r\nNow for our internal affairs. I am particularly glad to speak to\r\nan audience like this, because I do not know that I shall have the\r\nunqualified assent of everybody here. If I address an audience merely\r\nof men of very small means or wage-workers, then what I want to tell\r\nthem, as the most important thing for them to learn, is to avoid an\r\nattitude of rancorous envy or hostility toward men of wealth, and above\r\nall to remember that the well-being of our social structure rests upon\r\nobedience to the law, upon the immediate suppression of mob violence,\r\nmob rule, in any form. There can be and must be no paltering with any\r\nmanifestation of that spirit. Any attempt to override the law by action\r\nof individuals or by the action of mobs, whether the attempt comes in\r\nconnection with labor difficulties or in any other way, must in the\r\ninterest of the Nation be met fearlessly at the earliest opportunity,\r\nand the lawlessness put down.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, just as we must never allow this Government to be\r\nchanged into government by a mob, so we must never allow it to be\r\nchanged into government by a plutocracy. The growth of our modern\r\nindustrialism has resulted in an altogether disproportionate reward to\r\nthe man who goes into money-making as his only career. Two evil results\r\nfollow. One is the result to himself, for, unless he is a man of very\r\nstrong character, there almost inevitably comes a certain arrogance, or\r\nat least a certain carelessness toward the rights of others. The other\r\nresult is to breed in the minds of poor people an attitude of sullen\r\nenvy toward men of wealth, which is infinitely more damaging to the\r\npeople who hold it than any action of the man of wealth could be.\r\n\r\nThere must be a closer supervision by the Government of great\r\nindustrial combinations, for of course wealth at present finds its\r\nexpression through these great industrial combinations. I think it\r\nhas been a mistake to act on the theory which has shaped most of our\r\nlegislation, National and State, for the last thirty years, that it is\r\npossible to turn back the hands of the clock, to forbid combinations\r\nand to restore business to conditions which have absolutely passed\r\naway. That can not be done. What we can do is to exercise an efficient\r\nsupervision over the combinations, so as to see as far as possible\r\nthat they are used in the interest of and not against the interest\r\nof the general public. I do not believe that such supervision can\r\ncome effectively through the State, nor that it can effectively come\r\nthrough the municipality. Ultimately in the great majority of cases to\r\nbe effective it must be exercised by the National Government. I trust\r\nthat in the end means will be found by which the exercise of such\r\ncontrol over all the great industrial corporations which are really\r\nengaged in and doing an interstate business will be lodged in the\r\nhands of the National Government. As the first step to that I hope to\r\nsee the passage of legislation which will give as an executive, not\r\nas a judicial function, to the National Government the supervision of\r\nthe railroads of the United States which are engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce, with the power, when a rate is complained of as improper and\r\nunjust, to examine that rate, and if the rate should be changed to\r\nchange it to a given rate, and to have that given rate take practically\r\nimmediate effect. Now, I am perfectly well aware that there are\r\nobjections to the proposed change, but in my judgment they are far\r\noutweighed by the objections attendant upon not making the change. The\r\nfear expressed by excellent people, who no doubt feel it genuinely,\r\nthat we could not get a commission who would fix all the rates of the\r\nrailroads of the country, is to my mind much as if they should express\r\nfear that you could not get Supreme Court Justices who would be able\r\nto fix all the laws. I expect that the commission will be able to pass\r\nupon a given rate brought before it, just as the Supreme Court passes\r\nupon a given question of law brought before it; and one will prove to\r\nbe as feasible as the other has proved feasible. That system should\r\nbe, and in my judgment will be introduced. I believe it will work a\r\nmeasurable betterment for the public. Listen to what I say—a measurable\r\nbetterment for the public. I do not believe that it will produce\r\nthe millennium, or anything approaching it; and I am quite certain\r\nthat some of its most ardent advocates will be disappointed with the\r\nresults. But I think measurable good will come. It can only come if the\r\nofficers intrusted with the administration of the law remember that it\r\nis exactly as much their duty to protect the railroad from the public\r\nas to protect the public from the railroad; to remember that when we\r\nsay we want justice from the railroad we must, if we are honest, add\r\nalso a pledge to do justice to the railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, JUNE 28, 1905\r\n\r\nTHE HARVARD SPIRIT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Lawrence, Brothers, Men of Harvard_:\r\n\r\nWe have just heard from a Harvard man speaking in behalf of the class\r\nof ’55. I now speak to you in behalf of the class of ’80. Mr. Choate,\r\nyou can afford to be generous. A man whose life has been passed in\r\npublic service such as yours can freely praise those who come after\r\nhim. I speak in behalf of the younger men here present when I say\r\nthat we shall count ourselves more than happy if in the future we can\r\napproach the service of the men of Harvard in the past. I trust that\r\nif any great crisis come again—may Heaven forbid its coming—if ever a\r\ngreat crisis like that of ’61 should come, may the men of that day who\r\nhave been brought up in Harvard rise level to it as you of the years\r\nfrom ’55 onward rose level to meet the crisis of your day. We heard\r\nfrom Mr. Agassiz what the class of his day did, how many of them went\r\ninto the Union Army, how some of them went into the gallant Confederate\r\nArmy, one of the members of which, the great justice from Louisiana,\r\nMr. Justice White, has to-day become an adopted son of Harvard. In\r\nKentucky, a number of years ago, I had a good friend, a man much older\r\nthan I was, Colonel John Mason Brown. He came back from a trip to the\r\nRocky Mountains just after Sumter had been fired on. His mother brought\r\nhim the sword that his father had worn with honor in the Mexican War,\r\nand said to him, “My son, war has come, and you must draw this sword;\r\nI hope you will draw it for the flag under which your father fought;\r\nbut draw it for one side or the other you must.” We Americans of to-day\r\nhave the right to feel the same pride in the valor, the devotion, the\r\nfealty to the right as it was given them to see the right, of those who\r\nwore the gray no less than of those who wore the blue.\r\n\r\nIn Bishop Lawrence’s introduction—an introduction which touched me\r\ndeeply, not only because of the words used, but because of the high\r\nvalue which I put upon the friendship of the man using them—he spoke of\r\nthe effort that I am making for peace throughout the world. Of course\r\nI am for peace. Of course every President who is fit to be President\r\nmust be for peace. But I am for one thing before peace; I am for\r\nrighteousness first, and then peace. I am for peace, because normally\r\npeace is the best instrument wherewith to obtain righteousness. But,\r\nMr. Agassiz, when you and those like you faced 1861, you had to win\r\npeace by war, and you rendered us forever your debtors, because when\r\nthe choice was between what was peaceful and what was right you chose\r\nwhat was right.\r\n\r\nA great university like this has two especial functions. The first is\r\nto produce a small number of scholars of the highest rank, a small\r\nnumber of men who, in science and literature, or in art, will do\r\nproductive work of the first class. The second is to send out into the\r\nworld a very large number of men who never could achieve, and who ought\r\nnot to try to achieve, such a position in the field of scholarship, but\r\nwhose energies are to be felt in every other form of activity; and who\r\nshould go out from our doors with the balanced development of body, of\r\nmind, and above all of character, which shall fit them to do work both\r\nhonorable and efficient.\r\n\r\nMuch of the effort to accomplish the first function, that of developing\r\nmen capable of productive scholarship, as distinguished from merely\r\nimitative, annotative, or pedagogic scholarship, must come through the\r\ngraduate school. The law school and medical school do admirable work in\r\nfitting men for special professions, but they in no shape or way supply\r\nany shortcomings in the graduate school any more than does the college\r\nproper, the college of the undergraduates. The ideal for the graduate\r\nschool and for those undergraduates who are to go into it must be the\r\nideal of high scholarly production, which is to be distinguished in\r\nthe sharpest fashion from the mere transmittal of ready-made knowledge\r\nwithout adding to it. If America is to contribute its full share to\r\nthe progress not alone of knowledge, but of wisdom, then we must put\r\never-increasing emphasis on university work done along the lines of the\r\ngraduate school. We can best help the growth of American scholarship\r\nby seeing that as a career it is put more on a level with the other\r\ncareers open to our young men. The general opinion of the community\r\nis bound to have a very great effect even upon its most vigorous and\r\nindependent minds. If in the public mind the career of the scholar\r\nis regarded as of insignificant value when compared with that of a\r\nglorified pawnbroker, then it will with difficulty be made attractive\r\nto the most vigorous and gifted of our American young men. Good\r\nteachers, excellent institutions, and libraries are all demanded in a\r\ngraduate school worthy of the name. But there is an even more urgent\r\ndemand for the right sort of student. No first-class science, no\r\nfirst-class literature or art, can ever be built up with second-class\r\nmen. The scholarly career, the career of the man of letters, the man of\r\narts, the man of science, must be made such as to attract those strong\r\nand virile youths who now feel that they can only turn to business,\r\nlaw, or politics. There is no one thing which will bring about this\r\ndesired change, but there is one thing which will materially help in\r\nbringing it about, and that is to secure to scholars the chance of\r\ngetting one of a few brilliant positions as prizes if they rise to the\r\nfirst rank in their chosen career. Every such brilliant position should\r\nhave as an accompaniment an added salary, which shall help indicate how\r\nhigh the position really is; and it must be the efforts of the alumni\r\nwhich can alone secure such salaries for such positions.\r\n\r\nAs a people I think we are waking up to the fact that there must be\r\nbetter pay for the average man and average woman engaged in the work\r\nof education. But I am not speaking of this now; I am not speaking of\r\nthe desirability, great though that is, of giving better payment to\r\nthe average educator, I am speaking of the desirability of giving to\r\nthe exceptional man the chance of winning an exceptional prize, just\r\nas he has the chance to do in law and business. In business at the\r\npresent day nothing could be more healthy than an immense reduction\r\nin the money value of the exceptional prizes thus to be won; but in\r\nscholarship what is needed is the reverse. In this country we rightly\r\ngo upon the theory that it is more important to care for the welfare\r\nof the average man than to put a premium upon the exertions of the\r\nexceptional. But we must not forget that the establishment of such a\r\npremium for the exceptional, though of less importance, is nevertheless\r\nof very great importance. It is important even to the development of\r\nthe average man, for the average of all of us is raised by the work of\r\nthe great masters.\r\n\r\nIt is, I trust, unnecessary to say that I appreciate to the full the\r\nfact that the highest work of all will never be affected one way or\r\nthe other by any question of compensation. And much of the work which\r\nis really best for the Nation must from the very nature of things be\r\nnon-remunerative as compared with the work of the ordinary industries\r\nand vocations. Nor would it ever be possible or desirable that the\r\nrewards of transcendent success in scholarship should even approximate,\r\nfrom a monetary standpoint, the rewards in other vocations. But it is\r\nalso true that the effect upon ambitious minds can not but be bad if\r\nas a people we show our very slight regard for scholarly achievement\r\nby making no provision at all for its reward. The chief use of the\r\nincreased money value of the scholar’s prize would be the index thereby\r\nafforded of the respect in which it was popularly held. The American\r\nscientist, the American scholar, should have the chance at least of\r\nwinning such prizes as are open to his successful brother in Germany,\r\nEngland, or France, where the rewards paid for first-class scholarly\r\nachievement are as much above those paid in this country as our\r\nrewards for first-class achievement in industry or law are above those\r\npaid abroad.\r\n\r\nBut of course what counts infinitely more than any possible outside\r\nreward is the spirit of the worker himself. The prime need is to\r\ninstil into the minds of the scholars themselves a true appreciation\r\nof real as distinguished from sham success. In productive scholarship,\r\nin the scholarship which adds by its work to the sum of substantial\r\nachievement with which the country is to be credited, it is only\r\nfirst-class work that counts. In this field the smallest amount of\r\nreally first-class work is worth all the second-class work that can\r\npossibly be produced; and to have done such work is in itself the\r\nfullest and amplest reward to the man producing it. We outsiders should\r\naccording to our ability aid him in every way to produce it. Yet all\r\nthat we can do is but little compared to what he himself can and must\r\ndo. The spirit of the scholar is the vital factor in the productive\r\nscholarship of the country.\r\n\r\nSo much for the first function of the university, the sending forth of\r\na small number of scholars of the highest rank who will do productive\r\nwork of the first class. Now turn to the second, and what may be called\r\nthe normal function of the college, the function of turning out each\r\nyear many hundreds of men who shall possess the trained intelligence,\r\nand especially the character, that will enable them to hold high the\r\nrenown of this ancient seat of learning by doing useful service for\r\nthe Nation. It is not my purpose to discuss at length what should be\r\ndone in Harvard to produce the right spirit among the men who go\r\nout of Harvard, but rather to speak of what this spirit should be.\r\nNor shall I speak of the exceptions, the men to whom college life is\r\na disadvantage. Randolph of Roanoke, he of the biting tongue, once\r\nremarked of an opponent that he reminded him of certain tracts of land\r\n“which were almost worthless by nature, and became entirely so by\r\ncultivation.” Of course, if, in any individual, university training\r\nproduces a taste for refined idleness, a distaste for sustained effort,\r\na barren intellectual arrogance, or a sense of supercilious aloofness\r\nfrom the world of real men who do the world’s real work, then it has\r\nharmed that individual; but in such case there remains the abiding\r\ncomfort that he would not have amounted to much anyway. Neither a\r\ncollege training nor anything else can do much good to the man of weak\r\nfibre or to the man with a twist in his moral or intellectual makeup.\r\nBut the average undergraduate has enough robustness of nature, enough\r\ncapacity for enthusiasm and aspiration, to make it worth while to turn\r\nto account the stuff that is in him.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two points in the undergraduate life of Harvard\r\nabout which I think we have a right to feel some little concern. One\r\nis the growth of luxury in the university. I do not know whether\r\nanything we can say will have much effect on this point, but just so\r\nfar as the alumni have weight I hope to see that weight felt in serious\r\nand sustained effort against the growing tendency to luxury, and in\r\nfavor of all that makes for democratic conditions. One of our number,\r\nthe one whom I think the rest of us most delight to honor—Colonel\r\nHigginson—has given to our Alma Mater the Harvard Union, than which no\r\nbetter gift, no gift meeting a more vital need, could have been given\r\nto the university. It is neither possible nor desirable to try to take\r\naway all social differences from the student life; but it is a good\r\nthing to show how unimportant these differences are compared to the\r\ndifferences of real achievement, and compared also to the bonds which\r\nshould unite together all the men who are in any degree capable of such\r\nreal achievement; bonds, moreover, which should also knit these capable\r\nmen to their brethren who need their help.\r\n\r\nThe second point upon which I wish to speak is the matter of sport.\r\nNow I shall not be suspected of a tendency unduly to minimize the\r\nimportance of sport. I believe heartily in sport. I believe in outdoor\r\ngames, and I do not mind in the least that they are rough games, or\r\nthat those who take part in them are occasionally injured. I have no\r\nsympathy whatever with the overwrought sentimentality which would keep\r\na young man in cotton wool, and I have a hearty contempt for him if\r\nhe counts a broken arm or collar bone as of serious consequence when\r\nbalanced against the chance of showing that he possesses hardihood,\r\nphysical address, and courage. But when these injuries are inflicted\r\nby others, either wantonly or of set design, we are confronted by\r\nthe question, not of damage to one man’s body, but of damage to the\r\nother man’s character. Brutality in playing a game should awaken the\r\nheartiest and most plainly shown contempt for the player guilty of\r\nit; especially if this brutality is coupled with a low cunning in\r\ncommitting it without getting caught by the umpire. I hope to see both\r\ngraduate and undergraduate opinion come to scorn such a man as one\r\nguilty of base and dishonorable action, who has no place in the regard\r\nof gallant and upright men.\r\n\r\nIt is a bad thing for any college man to grow to regard sport as the\r\nserious business of life. It is a bad thing to permit sensationalism\r\nand hysteria to shape the development of our sports. And finally it\r\nis a much worse thing to permit college sport to become in any shape\r\nor way tainted by professionalism, or by so much as the slightest\r\nsuspicion of money-making; and this is especially true if the\r\nprofessionalism is furtive, if the boy or man violates the spirit\r\nof the rule while striving to keep within the letter. Professional\r\nsport is all right in its way. I am glad to say that among my friends\r\nI number professional boxers and wrestlers, oarsmen, and baseball\r\nmen, whose regard I value, and whom in turn I regard as thoroughly\r\ngood citizens. But the college undergraduate who, in furtive fashion,\r\nbecomes a semi-professional is an unmitigated curse, and that not\r\nalone to university life and to the cause of amateur sport; for the\r\ncollege graduate ought in after years to take the lead in putting the\r\nbusiness morality of this country on a proper plane, and he can not do\r\nit if in his own college career his code of conduct has been warped\r\nand twisted. Moreover, the spirit which puts so excessive a value upon\r\nhis work as to produce this semi-professional is itself unhealthy. I\r\nwish to see Harvard win a reasonable proportion of the contests in\r\nwhich it enters, and I should be heartily ashamed of every Harvard\r\nathlete who did not spend every ounce there was in him in the effort\r\nto win, provided only he does it in honorable and manly fashion. But\r\nI think our effort should be to minimize rather than to increase that\r\nkind of love of athletics which manifests itself, not in joining in\r\nthe athletic sports, but in crowding by tens of thousands to see other\r\npeople indulge in them. It is a far better thing for our colleges to\r\nhave the average student interested in some form of athletics than to\r\nhave them all gather in a mass to see other people do their athletics\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nSo much for the undergraduates. Now for the alumni, the men who are\r\nat work out in the great world. Of course the man’s first duty is to\r\nhimself and to those immediately dependent upon him. Unless he can pull\r\nhis own weight he must be content to remain a passenger all his life.\r\nBut we have a right to expect that the men who come out of Harvard will\r\ndo something more than merely pull their own weight. We have a right to\r\nexpect that they will count as positive forces for the betterment of\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen; and they can thus count only if they combine\r\nthe power of devotion to a lofty ideal with practical common-sense in\r\nstriving to realize this ideal.\r\n\r\nThis Nation never stood in greater need than now of having among its\r\nleaders men of lofty ideals, which they try to live up to and not\r\nmerely to talk of. We need men with these ideals in public life, and\r\nwe need them just as much in business and in such a profession as the\r\nlaw. We can by statute establish only those exceedingly rough lines of\r\nmorality the overpassing of which means that the man is in jeopardy\r\nof the constable or the sheriff. But the Nation is badly off if in\r\naddition to this there is not a very much higher standard of conduct,\r\na standard impossible effectively to establish by statute, but one\r\nupon which the community as a whole, and especially the real leaders\r\nof the community, insist. Take such a question as the enforcement of\r\nthe law. It is, of course, elementary to say that this is the first\r\nrequisite in any civilization at all. But a great many people in the\r\nranks of life from which most college men are drawn seem to forget that\r\nthey should condemn with equal severity those men who break the law by\r\ncommitting crimes of mob violence and those who evade the law, or who\r\nactually break it, but so cunningly that they can not be discovered,\r\nthe crimes they commit being not those of physical outrage, but those\r\nof greed and craft on the largest scale. The very rich man who conducts\r\nhis business as if he believed that he were a law unto himself thereby\r\nimmensely increases the difficulty of the task of upholding order when\r\nthe disorder is a menace to men of property; for if the community feels\r\nthat rich men disregard the law where it affects themselves, then\r\nthe community is apt to assume the dangerous and unwholesome attitude\r\nof condoning crimes of violence committed against the interests which\r\nin the popular mind these rich men represent. This last attitude is\r\nwholly evil; but so is the attitude which produces it. We have a\r\nright to appeal to the alumni of Harvard, and to the alumni of every\r\ninstitution of learning in this land, to do their part in creating a\r\npublic sentiment which shall demand of all men of means, and especially\r\nof the men of vast fortune, that they set an example to their less\r\nfortunate brethren, by paying scrupulous heed not only to the letter\r\nbut to the spirit of the laws, and by acknowledging in the heartiest\r\nfashion the moral obligations which can not be expressed in law, but\r\nwhich stand back of and above all laws. It is far more important that\r\nthey should conduct their business affairs decently than that they\r\nshould spend the surplus of their fortunes in philanthropy. Much has\r\nbeen given to these men and we have the right to demand much of them in\r\nreturn. Every man of great wealth who runs his business with cynical\r\ncontempt for those prohibitions of the law which by hired cunning he\r\ncan escape or evade is a menace to our community; and the community is\r\nnot to be excused if it does not develop a spirit which actively frowns\r\non and discountenances him. The great profession of the law should be\r\nthat profession whose members ought to take the lead in the creation of\r\njust such a spirit. We all know that, as things actually are, many of\r\nthe most influential and most highly remunerated members of the bar\r\nin every centre of wealth make it their special task to work out bold\r\nand ingenious schemes by which their very wealthy clients, individual\r\nor corporate, can evade the laws which are made to regulate in the\r\ninterest of the public the use of great wealth. Now, the great lawyer\r\nwho employs his talent and his learning in the highly remunerative task\r\nof enabling a very wealthy client to override or circumvent the law\r\nis doing all that in him lies to encourage the growth in this country\r\nof a spirit of dumb anger against all laws and of disbelief in their\r\nefficacy. Such a spirit may breed the demand that laws shall be made\r\neven more drastic against the rich, or else it may manifest itself in\r\nhostility to all laws. Surely Harvard has the right to expect from her\r\nsons a high standard of applied morality, whether their paths lead them\r\ninto public life, into business, or into the great profession of the\r\nlaw, whose members are so potent in shaping the growth of the national\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to having high ideals it can not too often be said to\r\na body such as is gathered here to-day, that together with devotion\r\nto what is right must go practical efficiency in striving for what is\r\nright. This is a rough, workaday, practical world, and if in it we\r\nare to do the work best worth doing, we must approach that work in a\r\nspirit remote from that of the mere visionary, and above all remote\r\nfrom that of the visionary whose aspirations after good find expression\r\nonly in the shape of scolding and complaining. It shall not help us if\r\nwe avoid the Scylla of baseness of motive, only to be wrecked on the\r\nCharybdis of wrong-headedness, of feebleness and inefficiency. There\r\ncan be nothing worse for the community than to have the men who profess\r\nlofty ideals show themselves so foolish, so narrow, so impracticable,\r\nas to cut themselves off from communion with the men who are actually\r\nable to do the work of governing, the work of business, the work of\r\nthe professions. It is a sad and evil thing if the men with a moral\r\nsense group themselves as impractical zealots, while the men of action\r\ngradually grow to discard and laugh at all moral sense as an evidence\r\nof impractical weakness. Macaulay, whose eminently sane and wholesome\r\nspirit revolted not only at weakness, but at the censorious folly which\r\nmasquerades as virtue, describes the condition of Scotland at the end\r\nof the seventeenth century in a passage which every sincere reformer\r\nshould keep constantly before him.\r\n\r\n“It is a remarkable circumstance that the same country should have\r\nproduced in the same age the most wonderful specimens of both extremes\r\nof human nature. Even in things indifferent the Scotch Puritan would\r\nhear of no compromise; and he was but too ready to consider all who\r\nrecommended prudence and charity as traitors to the cause of truth. On\r\nthe other hand, the Scotchmen of that generation who made a figure in\r\nParliament were the most dishonest and unblushing time-servers that the\r\nworld has ever seen. Perhaps it is natural that the most callous and\r\nimpudent vice should be found in the near neighborhood of unreasonable\r\nand impracticable virtue. Where enthusiasts are ready to destroy or\r\nbe destroyed for trifles magnified into importance by a squeamish\r\nconscience, it is not strange that the very name of conscience should\r\nbecome a byword of contempt to cool and shrewd men of business.”\r\n\r\nThe men who go out from Harvard into the great world of American life\r\nbear a heavy burden of responsibility. The only way they can show\r\ntheir gratitude to their Alma Mater is by doing their full duty to the\r\nNation as a whole; and they can do this full duty only if they combine\r\nthe high resolve to work for what is best and most ennobling with the\r\nno less resolute purpose to do their work in such fashion that when\r\nthe end of their days comes they shall feel that they have actually\r\nachieved results and not merely talked of achieving them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION, OCEAN GROVE, N. J.,\r\n  JULY 7, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Maxwell; Members of the National Educational Association_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the chance of greeting the National Educational\r\nAssociation; for in all this democratic land there is no more genuinely\r\ndemocratic association than this. It is truly democratic, because here\r\neach member meets every other member as his peer without regard to\r\nwhether he is the president of one of the great universities or the\r\nnewest recruit to that high and honorable profession which has in its\r\ncharge the upbringing and training of those boys and girls who in a few\r\nshort years will themselves be settling the destinies of this Nation.\r\nIt is not too much to say that the most characteristic work of the\r\nRepublic is that done by the educators, for whatever our shortcomings\r\nas a Nation may be, we have at least firmly grasped the fact that\r\nwe can not do our part in the difficult and all-important work of\r\nself-government, that we can not rule and govern ourselves, unless we\r\napproach the task with developed minds and trained characters. You\r\nteachers make the whole world your debtor. If you did not do your work\r\nwell this Republic would not endure beyond the span of the generation.\r\nMoreover, as an incident to your avowed work, you render some wellnigh\r\nunbelievable services to the country. For instance, you render to\r\nthe Republic the prime, the vital service of amalgamating into one\r\nhomogeneous body the children alike of those who are born here and of\r\nthose who come here from so many different lands abroad. You furnish\r\na common training and common ideals for the children of all the mixed\r\npeoples who are here being fused into one nationality. It is in no\r\nsmall degree due to you and your efforts that we are one people instead\r\nof a group of jarring peoples.\r\n\r\nMoreover, where altogether too much prominence is given to the mere\r\npossession of wealth, the country is under heavy obligations to such\r\na body as this, which substitutes for the ideal of accumulating\r\nmoney the infinitely loftier, non-materialistic ideal of devotion to\r\nwork worth doing simply for that work’s sake. I do not in the least\r\nunderestimate the need of having material prosperity as the basis of\r\nour civilization, but I most earnestly insist that if our civilization\r\ndoes not build a lofty superstructure on this basis, we can never\r\nrank among the really great peoples. A certain amount of money is of\r\ncourse a necessary thing, as much for the Nation as for the individual;\r\nand there are few movements in which I more thoroughly believe than\r\nin the movement to secure better remuneration for our teachers. But,\r\nafter all, the service you render is incalculable, because of the very\r\nfact that by your lives you show that you believe ideals to be worth\r\nsacrifice, and that you are splendidly eager to do non-remunerative\r\nwork if this work is of good to your fellow-men.\r\n\r\nTo furnish in your lives such a realized high ideal is to do a great\r\nservice to the country. The chief harm done by the men of swollen\r\nfortune to the community is not the harm that the demagogue is apt to\r\ndepict as springing from their actions, but the fact that their success\r\nsets up a false standard, and so serves as a bad example for the rest\r\nof us. If we did not ourselves attach an exaggerated importance to\r\nthe rich man who is distinguished only by his riches, this rich man\r\nwould have a most insignificant influence over us. It is generally\r\nour own fault if he does damage to us, for he damages us chiefly by\r\narousing our envy or by rendering us sour and discontented. In his\r\nactual business relations he is much more apt to benefit than harm the\r\nrest of us; and though it is eminently right to take whatever steps\r\nare necessary in order to prevent the exceptional members of his class\r\nfrom doing harm, it is wicked folly to let ourselves be drawn into any\r\nattack upon the man of wealth merely as such. Moreover, such an attack\r\nis in itself an exceptionally crooked and ugly tribute to wealth, and\r\ntherefore the proof of an exceptionally ugly and crooked state of\r\nmind in the man making the attack. Venomous envy of wealth is simply\r\nanother form of the spirit which in one of its manifestations takes the\r\nshape of cringing servility toward wealth, and in another the shape\r\nof brutal arrogance on the part of certain men of wealth. Each one of\r\nthese states of mind, whether it be hatred, servility, or arrogance,\r\nis in reality closely akin to the other two; for each of them springs\r\nfrom a fantastically twisted and exaggerated idea of the importance\r\nof wealth as compared to other things. The clamor of the demagogue\r\nagainst wealth, the snobbery of the social columns of the newspapers\r\nwhich deal with the doings of the wealthy, and the misconduct of those\r\nmen of wealth who act with brutal disregard of the rights of others,\r\nseem superficially to have no fundamental relation; yet in reality they\r\nspring from shortcomings which are fundamentally the same; and one of\r\nthese shortcomings is the failure to have proper ideals.\r\n\r\nThis failure must be remedied in large part by the actions of you and\r\nyour fellow-teachers, your fellow-educators throughout this land. By\r\nyour lives, no less than by your teachings, you show that while you\r\nregard wealth as a good thing, you regard other things as still better.\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to earn a certain amount of money; it is a\r\nman’s first duty to those dependent upon him to earn enough for their\r\nsupport; but after a certain point has been reached money-making can\r\nnever stand on the same plane with other and nobler forms of effort.\r\nThe roll of American worthies numbers men like Washington and Lincoln,\r\nGrant and Farragut, Hawthorne and Poe, Fulton and Morse, St. Gaudens\r\nand MacMonnies; it numbers statesmen and soldiers, men of letters,\r\nartists, sculptors, men of science, inventors, explorers, roadmakers,\r\nbridge builders, philanthropists, moral leaders in great reforms; it\r\nnumbers men who have deserved well in any one of countless fields of\r\nactivity; but of rich men it numbers only those who have used their\r\nriches aright, who have treated wealth not as an end, but as a means,\r\nwho have shown good conduct in acquiring it and not merely lavish\r\ngenerosity in disposing of it.\r\n\r\nThrice fortunate are you to whom it is given to lead lives of resolute\r\nendeavor for the achievement of lofty ideals, and, furthermore, to\r\ninstil, both by your lives and by your teachings, these ideals into the\r\nminds of those who in the next generation will, as the men and women of\r\nthat generation, determine the position which this Nation will hold in\r\nthe history of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I want to speak to you of how certain things, some of which\r\nhave happened, and some of which have been suggested to me by what has\r\nhappened, in the past week, emphasize what I have said to you as to the\r\nimportance to this country of having within its limits men who put the\r\nrealization of high ideals above any form of money-making.\r\n\r\nWithin a week this country has lost a great statesman, who was also a\r\ngreat man of letters; a man who occupied a peculiar and unique position\r\nin our country; a man of whose existence we could each of us be proud;\r\nfor the United States as a whole was better because John Hay lived.\r\nJohn Hay entered the public service as a young man just come of age,\r\nas the secretary of President Lincoln. He served in the war and was a\r\nmember of the Loyal Legion. He was trusted by and was intimate with\r\nLincoln as hardly any other man was. He then went on rendering service\r\nafter service; yet always able (this was one of his great advantages\r\nand great merits) at any moment to go back to private life unless\r\nhe could continue in public life on his own terms. As the climax\r\nof his career he served as Secretary of State under two successive\r\nadministrations, and by what he did and by what he was he contributed\r\nin no small degree to achieving for this Republic the respect of the\r\nnations of mankind. Such service as that could not have been rendered\r\nsave by a man who had before him ideals as far apart as the poles from\r\nthose ideals which have in them any taint of what is base or sordid.\r\n\r\nNow I wished to secure as John Hay’s successor the man whom I regarded\r\nas of all the men in the country that one best fitted to be such\r\nsuccessor. In asking him to accept the position of Secretary of State\r\nI was asking him to submit to a very great pecuniary sacrifice; and I\r\nnever even thought of that aspect of the question, for I knew he would\r\nnot either. I knew that whatever other considerations he had to weigh\r\nfor and against taking the position, the consideration of how it would\r\naffect his personal fortune would not be taken into account by Elihu\r\nRoot; and he has accepted.\r\n\r\nI am not speaking of Hay and Root as solitary exceptions. On the\r\ncontrary, I am speaking of them as typical of a large class of men in\r\npublic life. When we hear so much criticism of certain aspects of our\r\npublic life and of certain of our public servants, criticism which\r\nI regret to state is in many cases deserved, it is well for us to\r\nremember also the other side of the picture, to remember that here in\r\nAmerica we have and always have had at the command of the Nation in any\r\ncrisis, in any emergency, the very best ability to be found within the\r\nNation; and this ability has been given with the utmost freedom, given\r\nlavishly and generously, although at great pecuniary loss to the man\r\ngiving it.\r\n\r\nThere is not in my Cabinet a man to whom it is not a financial\r\ndisadvantage to stay in the Cabinet. There is not in my Cabinet a man\r\nwho does not have to give up something substantial, often very much\r\nthat is substantial, sometimes what it is a very real hardship for him\r\nto give up, in order that he may continue in the service of the Nation;\r\nand the only reward for which he looks or for which he cares is the\r\nconsciousness of doing service worth rendering. I hope to see more and\r\nmore throughout this Nation the spirit grow which makes such service\r\npossible. I hope more and more to see the sentiment of the country as\r\na whole become such that each man shall feel borne in on him, whether\r\nhe is in public life or in private life (and, mind you, some of the\r\ngreatest public services can be best rendered by those who are not in\r\npublic life), that the chance to do good work is the greatest chance\r\nthat can come to any man or any woman in our generation or in any other\r\ngeneration. Let each man feel that if such work can be well done it is\r\nin itself the amplest reward and the amplest prize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LONG ISLAND MEDICAL SOCIETY, AT OYSTER BAY, N. Y., JULY 12, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. President, Members of the Association, Friends and Neighbors_:\r\n\r\nI needed no invitation to come before you to-day. All I needed was\r\npermission. As soon as I learned that this association was to meet in\r\nour village I felt that I must take advantage of the opportunity to say\r\na word of greeting to you in person.\r\n\r\nOf course it is almost needless to say that there is not and can not\r\nbe any other lay profession the members of which occupy such a dual\r\nposition, each side of which is of such importance—for the doctor has\r\non the one hand to be the most thoroughly educated man in applied\r\nscience that there is in the country, and on the other hand, as\r\nevery layman knows, and as doubtless many a layman in the circle of\r\nacquaintance of each of you would gladly testify, the doctor gradually\r\nbecomes the closest friend to more people than would be possible in\r\nany other profession. The feelings that a man has toward the one human\r\nbeing to whom he turns, either in time of sickness for himself, or,\r\nwhat is far more important, in the time of sickness of those closest\r\nand dearest to him, can not but be of a peculiar kind. He can not but\r\nhave a feeling for him such as he has for no other man. The doctor\r\nmust, therefore, to the greatest degree develop his nature along the\r\ntwo sides of his duties, although in the case of any other man you\r\nwould call him a mighty good citizen if he developed only on one side.\r\nThe scientific man who is really a first-class scientific man has a\r\nclaim upon the gratitude of all the country; and the man who is a\r\nfirst-class neighbor, and is always called in in time of trouble by his\r\nneighbors, has an equal claim upon society at large. But the doctor has\r\nboth claims. Yet in addition to filling both of those functions he may\r\nfill many other functions. He may have served in the Civil War; he may\r\nhave rendered the greatest possible service to the community along any\r\none of a dozen different lines.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, just what is being done in one of the great works\r\nof this country at the present time—the digging of the Panama Canal.\r\nThat is a work that only a big nation could undertake or that a big\r\nnation could do, and it is a work for all mankind. The condition\r\nprecedent upon success in that work is having the proper type of\r\nmedical work as a preliminary, as a basis. That is the first condition,\r\nupon the meeting of which must depend our success in solving the\r\nengineering and administrative problems of the work itself. I am happy\r\nto say that the work is being admirably done, and I am particularly\r\nglad to have this chance of saying it. Now and then some alarmist\r\nreport will come from Panama. Just a couple of weeks ago there seemed\r\nto be a succession of people coming up from Panama, each one of whom\r\nhad some tale of terror to tell. You will always find in any battle,\r\neven if it is a victorious battle, that in the rear you will meet\r\na number of gentlemen who are glad that they are not at the front;\r\nwho, if they have unfortunately gotten at the front, have come away,\r\nand who justify their absence from the front by telling tales of how\r\neverything has gone wrong there. Now the people that flee from Panama\r\nwill carry up here just such stories as the people that flee from the\r\nforefront of a battle carry to the rear with them. The people to whom\r\nthis country owes and will owe much are those who stay down there and\r\ndo not talk, but do their work, and do it well. Of course, in doing\r\na great work like that in the tropics, in a region which until this\r\nGovernment took hold of it was accounted to be a region exceptionally\r\nunhealthy, we are going to have trouble, have some yellow fever, have a\r\ngood deal of malarial fever, and suffer more from the latter than from\r\nthe yellow fever, although we will hear nothing like the talk about it.\r\nWe will have every now and then trouble as regards hygiene, just as we\r\nwill have trouble in the engineering problems, just as occasionally we\r\nwill have troubles in the administrative work. Whenever any of those\r\ntroubles come there will be a large number of excellent but timid men\r\nwho will at once say what an awful calamity it is, and express the\r\ndeepest sorrow and concern, and be rather inclined to the belief that\r\nthe whole thing is a failure. It will not be a failure. It will be a\r\nsuccess; and it will be a success because we shall treat every little\r\ncheck, not as a reason for abandoning the work, but as a reason for\r\naltering and bettering our plans so as to make it impossible that that\r\nparticular check shall happen again.\r\n\r\nWhat is being done in Panama is but a sample of the things that this\r\ncountry has done during the last few years, of the things in which\r\nyour profession has borne so prominent a part. Take what we did in\r\nCuba, where we tried the experiment which had not been tried for four\r\nhundred years—of cleaning the cities. One of the most important items\r\nof the work done by our Government in Cuba was the work of hygiene,\r\nthe work of cleaning and disinfecting the cities so as to minimize the\r\nchance for yellow fever, so as to do away with as many as possible of\r\nthe conditions that told for disease. This country has never had done\r\nfor it better work, that is, work that reflected more honor upon the\r\ncountry, or for humanity at large, than the work done for it in Cuba.\r\nAnd the man who above all others was responsible for doing that work\r\nso well was a member of your profession, who when the call to arms\r\ncame himself went as a soldier to the field—the present Major-General\r\nLeonard Wood. Leonard Wood did in Cuba just the kind of work that,\r\nfor instance, Lord Cromer has done in Egypt. We have not been able to\r\nreward Wood in anything like the proportion in which services such as\r\nhis would have been rewarded in any other country of the first rank;\r\nand there have been no meaner and more unpleasant manifestations\r\nin all our public history than the feelings of envy and jealousy\r\nmanifested toward Wood. And the foul assaults and attacks made upon\r\nhim, gentlemen, were largely because they grudged the fact that this\r\nadmirable military officer should have been a doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT WILKESBARRE, PA., AUGUST 10, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\nI am particularly glad to speak to this audience of miners and their\r\nwives and children, and especially to speak under the auspices of this\r\ngreat temperance society. In our country the happiness of all the rest\r\nof our people depends most of all upon the welfare of the wage-worker\r\nand the welfare of the farmer. If we can secure the welfare of these\r\ntwo classes we can be reasonably certain that the community as a\r\nwhole will prosper. And we must never forget that the chief factor\r\nin securing the welfare alike of wage-worker and of farmer, as of\r\neverybody else, must be the man himself.\r\n\r\nThe only effective way to help anybody is to help him help himself.\r\nThere are exceptional times when any one of us needs outside help, and\r\nthen it should be given freely; but normally each one of us must depend\r\nupon his own exertions for his own success. Something can be done by\r\nwise legislation and by wise and honest administration of the laws;\r\nthat is, something can be done by our action taken in our collective\r\ncapacity through the State and the Nation.\r\n\r\nSomething more can be done by combination and organization among\r\nourselves in our private capacities as citizens, so long as this\r\ncombination or organization is managed with wisdom and integrity, with\r\ninsistence upon the rights of those benefited and yet with just regard\r\nfor the rights of others.\r\n\r\nBut in the last analysis the factor most influential in determining any\r\nman’s success must ever be the sum of that man’s own qualities, of his\r\nknowledge, foresight, thrift, and courage. Whatever tends to increase\r\nhis self-respect, whatever tends to help him overcome the temptations\r\nwith which all of us are surrounded, is of benefit not only to him, but\r\nto the whole community.\r\n\r\nNo one society can do more to help the wage-worker than such a\r\ntemperance society as that which I am now addressing. It is of\r\nincalculable consequence to the man himself that he should be sober\r\nand temperate, and it is of even more consequence to his wife and his\r\nchildren; for it is a hard and cruel fact that in this life of ours the\r\nsins of the man are often visited most heavily upon those whose welfare\r\nshould be his one especial care.\r\n\r\nFor the drunkard, for the man who loses his job because he can not\r\ncontrol or will not control his desire for liquor and for vicious\r\npleasure, we have a feeling of anger and contempt mixed with our pity;\r\nbut for his unfortunate wife and little ones we feel only pity, and\r\nthat of the deepest and tenderest kind.\r\n\r\nEverything possible should be done to encourage the growth of that\r\nspirit of self-respect, self-restraint, self-reliance, which if it only\r\ngrows enough is certain to make all those in whom it shows itself move\r\nsteadily upward toward the highest standard of American citizenship.\r\nIt is a proud and responsible privilege to be citizens of this great\r\nself-governing Nation; and each of us needs to keep steadily before\r\nhis eyes the fact that he is wholly unfit to take part in the work of\r\ngoverning others unless he can first govern himself. He must stand up\r\nmanfully for his own rights; he must respect the rights of others;\r\nhe must obey the law, and he must try to live up to those rules of\r\nrighteousness which are above and behind all laws.\r\n\r\nThis applies just as much to the man of great wealth as to the man\r\nof small means; to the capitalist as to the wage-worker. And as one\r\npractical point, let me urge that in the event of any difficulty,\r\nespecially if it is what is known as a labor trouble, both sides show\r\nthemselves willing to meet, willing to consult, and anxious each to\r\ntreat the other reasonably and fairly, each to look at the other’s side\r\nof the case and to do the other justice. If only this course could\r\nbe generally followed, the chance of industrial disaster would be\r\nminimized.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, I want to read you an extract from a letter I have\r\njust received from a Catholic priest whom I know well and whom I know\r\nto be as stanch a friend of the laboring man as there is to be found in\r\nthis country. Now and then—not too often—it is a good thing for all of\r\nus to hear what is not perhaps altogether palatable, provided only that\r\nthe person who tells the truth is our genuine friend, knows what he is\r\ntalking about (even though he may not see all sides of the case), and\r\ntells us what he has to say, not with a desire to hurt our feelings,\r\nbut with the transparent purpose to do us good. With this foreword,\r\nhere is a part of the letter:\r\n\r\n“I would humbly recommend that you lend your entire weight to the cause\r\nwhich the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America represents, and\r\nespecially so in its relation to the working classes of this country,\r\nfor whom it is doing so much good. You know that the temperance\r\nmovement is a potent auxiliary to the institutions of our country\r\nin building up a better manhood and a truer Christianity among our\r\ncitizens. It played a very important part in the two coal strikes\r\nof 1900 and 1902, respectively, by keeping the men sober, and thus\r\nremoving the danger of riotous and unbecoming conduct. There is one\r\ndiscouraging feature connected with the upward tendency of the wage\r\nscale among the workmen of this country. The higher the wages, the\r\nmore money they spend in saloons. The shorter the hours, the more they\r\nare inclined to absent themselves from home. An apparent disregard for\r\nfamily ties is growing among the poorer classes which will eventually\r\nlead to a disregard for the blessings our country affords them. Hence,\r\nwith an increase of wages a corresponding movement for better manhood,\r\nnobler citizenship, and truer Christianity should be set on foot.\r\nThe dignity of labor should be maintained, which can be done only\r\nthrough the love that a man should have for his work, and through the\r\nintelligence which he puts into it. A steady hand and sober mind are\r\nnecessary for this. Hence, the necessity of the temperance cause and of\r\nthe efforts which organized abstainers are putting into the movement.”\r\n\r\nNow, in what is here written this priest does not mean that the\r\ntendency is to grow worse; but he means that with shorter hours and\r\nincreased wages there is a tendency to go wrong which must be offset by\r\nmovements such as this great temperance movement and similar efforts\r\nfor social and civic betterment, or else the increase in leisure and\r\nmoney will prove a curse instead of a blessing. I strive never to tell\r\nany one what I do not thoroughly believe, and I shall not say to you\r\nthat to be honest, and temperate, and hardworking, and thrifty will\r\nalways bring success.\r\n\r\nThe hand of the Lord is sometimes heavy upon the just as well as upon\r\nthe unjust, and in the life of labor and effort which we must lead on\r\nthis earth it is not always possible either by work, by wisdom, or by\r\nupright behavior to ward off disaster. But it is most emphatically true\r\nthat the chance for leading a happy and prosperous life is immensely\r\nimproved if only the man is decent, sober, industrious, and exercises\r\nforesight and judgment. Let him remember above all that the performance\r\nof duty is the first essential to right living, and that a good type\r\nof average family life is the cornerstone of national happiness and\r\ngreatness. No man can be a good citizen, can deserve the respect of his\r\nfellows, unless first of all he is a good man in his own family, unless\r\nhe does his duty faithfully by his wife and children.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe in trades unions wisely and justly handled, in\r\nwhich the rightful purpose to benefit those connected with them is not\r\naccompanied by a desire to do injustice or wrong to others. I believe\r\nit the duty of capitalist and wage-worker to try to seek one another\r\nout, to understand each the other’s point of view, and to endeavor to\r\nshow broad and kindly human sympathy one with the other.\r\n\r\nI believe in the work of these great temperance organizations, of all\r\nkindred movements like the Young Men’s and Young Women’s Christian\r\nAssociations, in short in every movement which strives to help a man\r\nby teaching him how to help himself. But most of all I believe in the\r\nefficacy of the man himself striving continually to increase his own\r\nself-respect by the way in which he does his duty to himself and to his\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT CHAUTAUQUA, N. Y., AUGUST 11, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day I wish to speak to you on one feature of our national foreign\r\npolicy and one feature of our national domestic policy.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine is not a part of international law. But it is the\r\nfundamental feature of our entire foreign policy so far as the Western\r\nHemisphere is concerned, and it has more and more been meeting with\r\nrecognition abroad. The reason why it is meeting with this recognition\r\nis because we have not allowed it to become fossilized, but have\r\nadapted our construction of it to meet the growing, changing needs of\r\nthis hemisphere. Fossilization, of course, means death, whether to an\r\nindividual, a government, or a doctrine.\r\n\r\nIt is out of the question to claim a right and yet shirk the\r\nresponsibility for exercising that right. When we announce a policy\r\nsuch as the Monroe Doctrine we thereby commit ourselves to accepting\r\nthe consequences of the policy, and these consequences from time to\r\ntime alter.\r\n\r\nLet us look for a moment at what the Monroe Doctrine really is. It\r\nforbids the territorial encroachment of non-American powers on American\r\nsoil. Its purpose is partly to secure this Nation against seeing great\r\nmilitary powers obtain new footholds in the Western Hemisphere, and\r\npartly to secure to our fellow-republics south of us the chance to\r\ndevelop along their own lines without being oppressed or conquered\r\nby non-American powers. As we have grown more and more powerful our\r\nadvocacy of this doctrine has been received with more and more respect;\r\nbut what has tended most to give the doctrine standing among the\r\nnations is our growing willingness to show that we not only mean what\r\nwe say and are prepared to back it up, but that we mean to recognize\r\nour obligations to foreign peoples no less than to insist upon our own\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nWe can not permanently adhere to the Monroe Doctrine unless we succeed\r\nin making it evident in the first place that we do not intend to treat\r\nit in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at\r\nthe expense of the republics to the south of us; second, that we do not\r\nintend to permit it to be used by any of these republics as a shield to\r\nprotect that republic from the consequences of its own misdeeds against\r\nforeign nations; third, that inasmuch as by this doctrine we prevent\r\nother nations from interfering on this side of the water, we shall\r\nourselves in good faith try to help those of our sister republics,\r\nwhich need such help, upward toward peace and order.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first point we must recognize the fact that in some\r\nSouth American countries there has been much suspicion lest we\r\nshould interpret the Monroe Doctrine in some way inimical to their\r\ninterests. Now let it be understood once for all that no just and\r\norderly government on this continent has anything to fear from us.\r\nThere are certain of the republics south of us which have already\r\nreached such a point of stability, order, and prosperity that they are\r\nthemselves, although as yet hardly consciously, among the guarantors\r\nof this doctrine. No stable and growing American republic wishes to\r\nsee some great non-American military power acquire territory in its\r\nneighborhood. It is the interest of all of us on this continent that\r\nno such event should occur, and in addition to our own Republic there\r\nare now already republics in the regions south of us which have reached\r\na point of prosperity and power that enables them to be considerable\r\nfactors in maintaining this doctrine which is so much to the advantage\r\nof all of us. It must be understood that under no circumstances will\r\nthe United States use the Monroe Doctrine as a cloak for territorial\r\naggression. Should any of our neighbors, no matter how turbulent, how\r\ndisregardful of our rights, finally get into such a position that the\r\nutmost limits of our forbearance are reached, all the people south of\r\nus may rest assured that no action will ever be taken save what is\r\nabsolutely demanded by our self-respect; that this action will not take\r\nthe form of territorial aggrandizement on our part, and that it will\r\nonly be taken at all with the most extreme reluctance and not without\r\nhaving exhausted every effort to avert it.\r\n\r\nAs to the second point, if a republic to the south of us commits a\r\ntort against a foreign nation, such, for instance, as wrongful action\r\nagainst the persons of citizens of that nation, then the Monroe\r\nDoctrine does not force us to interfere to prevent punishment of the\r\ntort, save to see that the punishment does not directly or indirectly\r\nassume the form of territorial occupation of the offending country.\r\nThe case is more difficult when the trouble comes from the failure to\r\nmeet contractual obligations. Our own Government has always refused to\r\nenforce such contractual obligations on behalf of its citizens by the\r\nappeal to arms. It is much to be wished that all foreign governments\r\nwould take the same view. But at present this country would certainly\r\nnot be willing to go to war to prevent a foreign government from\r\ncollecting a just debt or to back up some one of our sister republics\r\nin a refusal to pay just debts; and the alternative may in any case\r\nprove to be that we shall ourselves undertake to bring about some\r\narrangement by which so much as is possible of the just obligations\r\nshall be paid. Personally I should always prefer to see this country\r\nstep in and put through such an arrangement rather than let any foreign\r\ncountry undertake it.\r\n\r\nI do not want to see any foreign power take possession permanently or\r\ntemporarily of the custom-houses of an American republic in order to\r\nenforce its obligations, and the alternative may at any time be that\r\nwe shall be forced to do so ourselves.\r\n\r\nFinally, and what is in my view really the most important thing of\r\nall, it is our duty, so far as we are able, to try to help upward our\r\nweaker brothers. Just as there has been a gradual growth of the ethical\r\nelement in the relations of one individual to another, so that with all\r\nthe faults of our Christian civilization it yet remains true that we\r\nare, no matter how slowly, more and more coming to recognize the duty\r\nof bearing one another’s burdens, similarly I believe that the ethical\r\nelement is by degrees entering into the dealings of one nation with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nUnder strain of emotion caused by sudden disaster this feeling is very\r\nevident. A famine or a plague in one country brings much sympathy and\r\nsome assistance from other countries. Moreover, we are now beginning\r\nto recognize that weaker peoples have a claim upon us, even when the\r\nappeal is made, not to our emotions by some sudden calamity, but to our\r\nconsciences by a long-continuing condition of affairs.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that nations have more than begun to approach the\r\nproper relationship one to another, and I fully recognize the folly\r\nof proceeding upon the assumption that this ideal condition can now\r\nbe realized in full—for, in order to proceed upon such an assumption,\r\nwe would first require some method of forcing recalcitrant nations to\r\ndo their duty, as well as of seeing that they are protected in their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of justice, it is as necessary to exercise the police\r\npower as to show charity and helpful generosity. But something can\r\neven now be done toward the end in view. That something, for instance,\r\nthis Nation has already done as regards Cuba, and is now trying to do\r\nas regards Santo Domingo. There are few things in our history in which\r\nwe should take more genuine pride than the way in which we liberated\r\nCuba, and then, instead of instantly abandoning it to chaos, stayed in\r\ndirection of the affairs of the island until we had put it on the right\r\npath, and finally gave it freedom and helped it as it started on the\r\nlife of an independent republic.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo has now made an appeal to us to help it in turn, and\r\nnot only every principle of wisdom but every generous instinct within\r\nus bids us respond to the appeal. The conditions in Santo Domingo\r\nhave for a number of years grown from bad to worse until recently all\r\nsociety was on the verge of dissolution. Fortunately just at this time\r\na wise ruler sprang up in Santo Domingo, who, with his colleagues,\r\nsaw the dangers threatening their beloved country, and appealed to\r\nthe friendship of their great and powerful neighbor to help them. The\r\nimmediate threat came to them in the shape of foreign intervention. The\r\nprevious rulers of Santo Domingo had recklessly incurred debts, and\r\nowing to her internal disorders she had ceased to be able to provide\r\nmeans of paying the debts. The patience of her foreign creditors had\r\nbecome exhausted, and at least one foreign nation was on the point of\r\nintervention and was only prevented from intervening by the unofficial\r\nassurance of this Government that it would itself strive to help Santo\r\nDomingo in her hour of need. Of the debts incurred some were just,\r\nwhile some were not of a character which really renders it obligatory\r\non, or proper for, Santo Domingo to pay them in full. But she could not\r\npay any of them at all unless some stability was assured.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Executive Department of our Government negotiated\r\na treaty under which we are to try to help the Dominican people to\r\nstraighten out their finances. This treaty is pending before the\r\nSenate, whose consent to it is necessary. In the meantime we have made\r\na temporary arrangement which will last until the Senate has had time\r\nto take action upon the treaty. Under this arrangement we see to the\r\nhonest administration of the custom-houses, collecting the revenues,\r\nturning over forty-five per cent to the Government for running expenses\r\nand putting the other fifty-five per cent into a safe deposit for\r\nequitable division among the various creditors, whether European or\r\nAmerican, accordingly as, after investigation, their claims seem just.\r\n\r\nThe custom-houses offer wellnigh the only sources of revenue in\r\nSanto Domingo, and the different revolutions usually have as their\r\nreal aim the obtaining possession of these custom-houses. The mere\r\nfact that we are protecting the custom-houses and collecting the\r\nrevenue with efficiency and honesty has completely discouraged all\r\nrevolutionary movement, while it has already produced such an increase\r\nin the revenues that the Government is actually getting more from the\r\nforty-five per cent that we turn over to it than it got formerly when\r\nit took the entire revenue. This is enabling the poor harassed people\r\nof Santo Domingo once more to turn their attention to industry and to\r\nbe free from the curse of interminable revolutionary disturbance. It\r\noffers to all bona fide creditors, American and European, the only\r\nreally good chance to obtain that to which they are justly entitled,\r\nwhile it in return gives to Santo Domingo the only opportunity of\r\ndefence against claims which it ought not to pay—for now if it meets\r\nthe views of the Senate we shall ourselves thoroughly examine all\r\nthese claims, whether American or foreign, and see that none that are\r\nimproper are paid. Indeed, the only effective opposition to the treaty\r\nwill probably come from dishonest creditors, foreign and American, and\r\nfrom the professional revolutionists of the island itself. We have\r\nalready good reason to believe that some of the creditors who do not\r\ndare expose their claims to honest scrutiny are endeavoring to stir up\r\nsedition in the island, and are also endeavoring to stir up opposition\r\nto the treaty both in Santo Domingo and here, trusting that in one\r\nplace or the other it may be possible to secure either the rejection of\r\nthe treaty or else its amendment in such fashion as to be tantamount to\r\nrejection.\r\n\r\nUnder the course taken, stability and order and all the benefits of\r\npeace are at last coming to Santo Domingo, all danger of foreign\r\nintervention has ceased, and there is at last a prospect that all\r\ncreditors will get justice, no more and no less. If the arrangement is\r\nterminated, chaos will follow; and if chaos follows, sooner or later\r\nthis Government may be involved in serious difficulties with foreign\r\ngovernments over the island, or else may be forced itself to intervene\r\nin the island in some unpleasant fashion. Under the present arrangement\r\nthe independence of the island is scrupulously respected, the danger of\r\nviolation of the Monroe Doctrine by the intervention of foreign powers\r\nvanishes, and the interference of our Government is minimized, so that\r\nwe only act in conjunction with the Santo Domingo authorities to secure\r\nthe proper administration of the customs, and therefore to secure the\r\npayment of just debts and to secure the Santo Dominican Government\r\nagainst demands for unjust debts. The present method prevents there\r\nbeing any need of our establishing any kind of protectorate over the\r\nisland and gives the people of Santo Domingo the same chance to move\r\nonward and upward which we have already given to the people of Cuba.\r\nIt will be doubly to our discredit as a Nation if we fail to take\r\nadvantage of this chance; for it will be of damage to ourselves, and,\r\nabove all, it will be of incalculable damage to Santo Domingo. Every\r\nconsideration of wise policy, and, above all, every consideration of\r\nlarge generosity, bids us meet the request of Santo Domingo as we are\r\nnow trying to meet it.\r\n\r\nSo much for one feature of our foreign policy. Now for one feature\r\nof our domestic policy. One of the main features of our national\r\ngovernmental policy should be the effort to secure adequate and\r\neffective supervisory and regulatory control over all great\r\ncorporations doing an interstate business. Much of the legislation\r\naimed to prevent the evils connected with the enormous development\r\nof these great corporations has been ineffective, partly because it\r\naimed at doing too much, and partly because it did not confer on the\r\nGovernment a really efficient method of holding any guilty corporation\r\nto account. The effort to prevent all restraint of competition, whether\r\nharmful or beneficial, has been ill-judged; what is needed is not so\r\nmuch the effort to prevent combination as a vigilant and effective\r\ncontrol of the combinations formed, so as to secure just and equitable\r\ndealing on their part alike toward the public generally, toward their\r\nsmaller competitors, and toward the wage-workers in their employ.\r\n\r\nUnder the present laws we have in the last four years accomplished\r\nmuch that is of substantial value; but the difficulties in the way\r\nhave been so great as to prove that further legislation is advisable.\r\nMany corporations show themselves honorably desirous to obey the law;\r\nbut, unfortunately, some corporations, and very wealthy ones at that,\r\nexhaust every effort which can be suggested by the highest ability,\r\nor secured by the most lavish expenditure of money, to defeat the\r\npurposes of the laws on the statute books.\r\n\r\nNot only the men in control of these corporations, but the business\r\nworld generally, ought to realize that such conduct is in every way\r\nperilous, and constitutes a menace to the Nation generally, and\r\nespecially to the people of great property.\r\n\r\nI earnestly believe that this is true of only a relatively small\r\nportion of the very rich men engaged in handling the largest\r\ncorporations in the country; but the attitude of these comparatively\r\nfew men does undoubtedly harm the country, and above all harm the\r\nmen of large means, by the just, but sometimes misguided, popular\r\nindignation to which it gives rise. The consolidation, in the form of\r\nwhat are popularly called trusts, of corporate interests of immense\r\nvalue has tended to produce unfair restraints of trade of an oppressive\r\ncharacter, and these unfair restraints tend to create great artificial\r\nmonopolies. The violations of the law known as the anti-trust law,\r\nwhich was meant to meet the conditions thus arising, have more and\r\nmore become confined to the larger combinations, the very ones against\r\nwhose policy of monopoly and oppression the policy of the law was\r\nchiefly directed. Many of these combinations by secret methods and\r\nby protracted litigation are still unwisely seeking to avoid the\r\nconsequences of their illegal action. The Government has very properly\r\nexercised moderation in attempting to enforce the criminal provisions\r\nof the statute; but it has become our conviction that in some cases,\r\nsuch as that of at least certain of the beef packers recently indicted\r\nin Chicago, it is impossible longer to show leniency. Moreover, if the\r\nexisting law proves to be inadequate, so that under established rules\r\nof evidence clear violations may not be readily proved, defiance of\r\nthe law must inevitably lead to further legislation. This legislation\r\nmay be more drastic than I would prefer. If so, it must be distinctly\r\nunderstood that it will be because of the stubborn determination of\r\nsome of the great combinations in striving to prevent the enforcement\r\nof the law as it stands, by every device, legal and illegal. Very many\r\nof these men seem to think that the alternative is simply between\r\nsubmitting to the mild kind of governmental control we advocate and the\r\nabsolute freedom to do whatever they think best. They are greatly in\r\nerror. Either they will have to submit to reasonable supervision and\r\nregulation by the national authorities, or else they will ultimately\r\nhave to submit to governmental action of a far more drastic type.\r\nPersonally, I think our people would be most unwise if they let any\r\nexasperation due to the acts of certain great corporations drive them\r\ninto drastic action, and I should oppose such action. But the great\r\ncorporations are themselves to blame if by their opposition to what is\r\nlegal and just they foster the popular feeling which calls for such\r\ndrastic action.\r\n\r\nSome great corporations resort to every technical expedient to render\r\nenforcement of the law impossible, and their obstructive tactics and\r\nrefusal to acquiesce in the policy of the law have taxed to the utmost\r\nthe machinery of the Department of Justice. In my judgment Congress may\r\nwell inquire whether it should not seek other means for carrying into\r\neffect the law. I believe that all corporations engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce should be under the supervision of the National Government. I\r\ndo not believe in taking steps hastily or rashly, and it may be that\r\nall that is necessary in the immediate future is to pass an interstate\r\ncommerce bill conferring upon some branch of the executive government\r\nthe power of effective action to remedy the abuses in connection\r\nwith railway transportation. But in the end, and in my judgment at a\r\ntime not very far off, we shall have to, or at least we shall find\r\nthat we ought to, take further action as regards all corporations\r\ndoing interstate business. The enormous increase in interstate trade,\r\nresulting from the industrial development of the last quarter of a\r\ncentury, makes it proper that the Federal Government should, so far as\r\nmay be necessary to carry into effect its national policy, assume a\r\ndegree of administrative control of these great corporations.\r\n\r\nIt may well be that we shall find that the only effective way of\r\nexercising this supervision is to require all corporations engaged\r\nin interstate commerce to produce proof satisfactory, say, to the\r\nDepartment of Commerce, that they are not parties to any contract or\r\ncombination or engaged in any monopoly in interstate trade in violation\r\nof the anti-trust law, and that their conduct on certain other\r\nspecified points is proper; and, moreover, that these corporations\r\nshall agree, with a penalty of forfeiture of their right to engage in\r\nsuch commerce, to furnish any evidence of any kind as to their trade\r\nbetween the States whenever so required by the Department of Commerce.\r\n\r\nIt is the almost universal policy of the several States, provided\r\nby statute, that foreign corporations may lawfully conduct business\r\nwithin their boundaries only when they produce certificates that they\r\nhave complied with the requirements of their respective States; in\r\nother words, that corporations shall not enjoy the privileges and\r\nimmunities afforded by the State governments without first complying\r\nwith the policy of their laws. Now the benefits which corporations\r\nengaged in interstate trade enjoy under the United States Government\r\nare incalculable; and in respect of such trade the jurisdiction of the\r\nFederal Government is supreme when it chooses to exercise it.\r\n\r\nWhen, as is now the case, many of the great corporations consistently\r\nstrain the last resources of legal technicality to avoid obedience\r\nto a law for the reasonable regulation of their business, the only\r\nway effectively to meet this attitude on their part is to give to the\r\nExecutive Department of the Government a more direct and therefore more\r\nefficient supervision and control of their management.\r\n\r\nIn speaking against the abuses committed by certain very wealthy\r\ncorporations or individuals, and of the necessity of seeking so far as\r\nit can safely be done to remedy these abuses, there is always danger\r\nlest what is said may be misinterpreted as an attack upon men of means\r\ngenerally. Now it can not too often be repeated in a Republic like ours\r\nthat the only way by which it is possible permanently to benefit the\r\ncondition of the less able and less fortunate is so to shape our policy\r\nthat all industrious and efficient people who act decently may be\r\nbenefited; and this means, of course, that the benefit will come even\r\nmore to the more able and more fortunate. If, under such circumstances,\r\nthe less fortunate man is moved by envy of his more fortunate brother\r\nto strike at the conditions under which they have both, though\r\nunequally, prospered, he may rest assured that while the result may be\r\ndamaging to the other man, it will be even more damaging to himself.\r\nOf course, I am now speaking of prosperity that comes under normal and\r\nproper conditions.\r\n\r\nIn our industrial and social system the interests of all men are\r\nso closely intertwined that in the immense majority of cases the\r\nstraight-dealing man who by ingenuity and industry benefits himself\r\nmust also benefit others. The man of great productive capacity who gets\r\nrich through guiding the labor of hundreds or thousands of other men\r\ndoes so, as a rule, by enabling their labor to produce more than it\r\nwould without his guidance, and both he and they share in the benefit,\r\nso that even if the share be unequal it must never be forgotten that\r\nthey too are really benefited by his success.\r\n\r\nA vital factor in the success of any enterprise is the guiding\r\nintelligence of the man at the top, and there is need in the interest\r\nof all of us to encourage rather than to discourage the activity of the\r\nexceptional men who guide average men so that their labor may result\r\nin increased production of the kind which is demanded at the time.\r\nNormally we help the wage-worker, we help the man of small means, by\r\nmaking conditions such that the man of exceptional business ability\r\nreceives an exceptional reward for that ability.\r\n\r\nBut while insisting with all emphasis upon this, it is also true that\r\nexperience has shown that when there is no governmental restraint or\r\nsupervision, some of the exceptional men use their energies, not in\r\nways that are for the common good, but in ways which tell against this\r\ncommon good; and that by so doing they not only wrong smaller and less\r\nable men—whether wage-workers or small producers and traders—but force\r\nother men of exceptional abilities themselves to do what is wrong under\r\npenalty of falling behind in the keen race for success. There is need\r\nof legislation to strive to meet such abuses. At one time or in one\r\nplace this legislation may take the form of factory laws and employers’\r\nliability laws. Under other conditions it may take the form of dealing\r\nwith the franchises which derive their value from the grant of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people. It may be aimed at the manifold abuses,\r\nfar-reaching in their effects, which spring from overcapitalization.\r\nOr it may be necessary to meet such conditions as those with which\r\nI am now dealing and to strive to procure proper supervision and\r\nregulation by the National Government of all great corporations engaged\r\nin interstate commerce or doing an interstate business.\r\n\r\nThere are good people who are afraid of each type of legislation; and\r\nmuch the same kind of argument that is now advanced against the effort\r\nto regulate big corporations has been again and again advanced against\r\nthe effort to secure proper employers’ liability laws or proper factory\r\nlaws with reference to women and children; much the same kind of\r\nargument was advanced but five years ago against the franchise-tax law\r\nenacted in this State while I was Governor.\r\n\r\nOf course there is always the danger of abuse if legislation of this\r\ntype is approached in a hysterical or sentimental spirit, or, above\r\nall, if it is approached in a spirit of envy and hatred toward men of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nWe must not try to go too fast, under penalty of finding that we may\r\nbe going in the wrong direction; and, in any event, we ought always to\r\nproceed by evolution and not by revolution. The laws must be conceived\r\nand executed in a spirit of sanity and justice, and with exactly as\r\nmuch regard for the rights of the big man as for the rights of the\r\nlittle man—treating big man and little man exactly alike.\r\n\r\nOur ideal must be the effort to combine all proper freedom for\r\nindividual effort with some guarantee that the effort is not exercised\r\nin contravention of the eternal and immutable principles of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COLORED INDUSTRIAL ASSOCIATION,\r\n  RICHMOND, VA., OCTOBER 18, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI want to congratulate you upon the showing your school-children\r\nhave made, and further I wish as an American to congratulate the\r\nrepresentatives of the colored race who have shown such progress in\r\ndirecting the industrial interests of this city. All they have done\r\nin that way means a genuine progress for the race. I am glad as an\r\nAmerican for what you are doing. The standing of the bank which in\r\nthis city is managed by colored men should give genuine pride to all\r\nthe colored men of this country. Its record is an enviable one. You\r\ncolored men who show in business life both ability and a high order of\r\nintegrity are real benefactors not only of your race but of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT CAPITOL SQUARE, RICHMOND, VA., OCTOBER 18, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI trust I need hardly say how great is my pleasure at speaking in this\r\nhistoric capital of your historic State—the State than which no other\r\nhas contributed a larger proportion to the leadership of the nation;\r\nfor on the honor roll of those American worthies whose greatness is not\r\nonly for the age but for all time, not only for one nation but for all\r\nthe world, on this honor roll Virginia’s name stands above all others.\r\nAnd in greeting all of you, I know that no one will grudge my saying a\r\nspecial word of acknowledgment to the veterans of the Civil War. A man\r\nwould indeed be but a poor American who could without a thrill witness\r\nthe way in which, in city after city in the North as in the South, on\r\nevery public occasion, the men who wore the blue and the men who wore\r\nthe gray now march and stand shoulder to shoulder, giving tangible\r\nproof that we are all now in fact as well as in name a reunited people,\r\na people infinitely richer because of the priceless memories left to\r\nall Americans by you men who fought in the great war. Last Memorial\r\nDay I spoke in Brooklyn, at the unveiling of the statue of a Northern\r\ngeneral, under the auspices of the Grand Army of the Republic, and that\r\ngreat audience cheered every allusion to the valor and self-devotion of\r\nthe men who followed Lee as heartily as they cheered every allusion to\r\nthe valor and self-devotion of the men who followed Grant. The wounds\r\nleft by the great civil war have long healed, but its memories remain.\r\nThink of it, oh, my countrymen, think of the good fortune that is\r\nours! That whereas every other war of modern times has left feelings\r\nof rancor and bitterness to keep asunder the combatants, our great war\r\nhas left to the sons and daughters of the men who fought, on whichever\r\nside they fought, the same right to feel the keenest pride in the\r\ngreat deeds alike of the men who fought on one side and of the men who\r\nfought on the other. The proud self-sacrifice, the resolute and daring\r\ncourage, the high and steadfast devotion to the right as each man\r\nsaw it, whether Northerner or Southerner, these qualities render all\r\nAmericans forever the debtors of those who in the dark days from ’61 to\r\n’65 proved their truth by their endeavor. Here around Richmond, here\r\nin your own State, there lies battlefield after battlefield, rendered\r\nforever memorable by the men who counted death as but a little thing\r\nwhen weighed in the balance against doing their duty as it was given\r\nthem to see it. These men have left us of the younger generation not\r\nmerely the memory of what they did in war, but of what they did in\r\npeace. Foreign observers predicted that when such a great war closed\r\nit would be impossible for the hundreds of thousands of combatants to\r\nreturn to the paths of peace. They predicted ceaseless disorder, wild\r\nturbulence, the alternation of anarchy and despotism. But the good\r\nsense and self-restraint of the average American citizen falsified\r\nthese prophecies. The great armies disbanded and the private in the\r\nranks, like the officer who had commanded him, went back to take up the\r\nthreads of his life where he had dropped them when the call to arms\r\ncame. It was a wonderful, a marvelous thing, in a country consecrated\r\nto peace with but an infinitesimal regular army, to develop so quickly\r\nthe huge hosts which confronted one another between the James and\r\nthe Potomac and along the Mississippi and its tributaries. But it was\r\nan even more wonderful, an even more marvelous thing, how these great\r\nhosts, once their work done, resolved themselves into the general\r\nfabric of the Nation.\r\n\r\nGreat though the meed of praise is which is due the South for the\r\nsoldierly valor her sons displayed during the four years of war, I\r\nthink that even greater praise is due to her for what her people\r\nhave accomplished in the forty years of peace which followed. For\r\nforty years the South has made not merely a courageous, but at times\r\na desperate struggle, as she has striven for moral and material\r\nwell-being. Her success has been extraordinary, and all citizens of\r\nour common country should feel joy and pride in it; for any great\r\ndeed done or any fine qualities shown by one group of Americans of\r\nnecessity reflects credit upon all Americans. Only a heroic people\r\ncould have battled successfully against the conditions with which the\r\npeople of the South found themselves face to face at the end of the\r\nCivil War. There had been utter destruction and disaster, and wholly\r\nnew business and social problems had to be faced with the scantiest\r\nmeans. The economic and political fabric had to be readjusted in the\r\nmidst of dire want, of grinding poverty. The future of the broken,\r\nwar-swept South seemed beyond hope, and if her sons and daughters had\r\nbeen of weaker fibre there would in very truth have been no hope. But\r\nthe men and the sons of the men who had faced with unfaltering front\r\nevery alternation of good and evil fortune from Manassas to Appomattox,\r\nand the women, their wives and mothers, whose courage and endurance\r\nhad reached an even higher heroic level—these men and these women\r\nset themselves undauntedly to the great task before them. For twenty\r\nyears the struggle was hard and at times doubtful. Then the splendid\r\nqualities of your manhood and womanhood told, as they were bound to\r\ntell, and the wealth of your extraordinary natural resources began to\r\nbe shown. Now the teeming riches of mine and field and factory attest\r\nthe prosperity of those who are all the stronger because of the trials\r\nand struggles through which this prosperity has come. You stand loyally\r\nto your traditions and memories; you also stand loyally for our great\r\ncommon country of to-day and for our common flag, which symbolizes all\r\nthat is brightest and most hopeful for the future of mankind; you face\r\nthe new age in the spirit of the age. Alike in your material and in\r\nyour spiritual and intellectual development you stand abreast of the\r\nforemost in the world’s progress.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my fellow-citizens, my fellow-Americans, exactly as all of\r\nus, whether we live in the East or the West, in the North or the\r\nSouth, have the right merely as Americans to feel pride in every\r\ngreat deed done by any American in the past, and exactly as we are\r\nknit together by this common heritage of memories, so we are knit\r\ntogether, by the bond of our common duties in the present, our common\r\ninterest in the future. Many and great problems lie before us. If we\r\ntreat the mighty memories of the past merely as excuses for sitting\r\nlazily down in the present, or for standing aside from the rough\r\nwork of the world, then these memories will prove a curse instead of\r\na blessing. But if we treat them as I believe we shall treat them,\r\nnot as excuses for inaction, but as incentives to make us show that\r\nwe are worthy of our fathers and of our fathers’ fathers, then in\r\ntruth the deeds of the past will not have been wasted, for they shall\r\nbring forth fruit a hundred-fold in the present generation. We of\r\nthis Nation, we, the citizens of this mighty and wonderful Republic,\r\nstretching across a continent between the two greatest oceans, enjoy\r\nextraordinary privileges, and as our opportunity is great, therefore\r\nour responsibility is great. We have duties to perform both abroad and\r\nat home, and we can not shirk either set of duties and fully retain our\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs we must make up our minds that, whether we wish it\r\nor not, we are a great people and must play a great part in the world.\r\nIt is not open to us to choose whether we will play that great part or\r\nnot. We have to play it; all we can decide is whether we shall play it\r\nwell or ill. And I have too much confidence in my countrymen to doubt\r\nwhat the decision will be. Our mission in the world should be one of\r\npeace, but not the peace of cravens, the peace granted contemptuously\r\nto those who purchase it by surrendering the right. No! Our voice\r\nmust be effective for peace because it is raised for righteousness\r\nfirst and for peace only as the handmaiden of righteousness. We must be\r\nscrupulous in respecting the rights of the weak, and no less careful to\r\nmake it evident that we do not act through fear of the strong. We must\r\nbe scrupulous in doing justice to others and scrupulous in exacting\r\njustice for ourselves. We must beware equally of that sinister and\r\ncynical teaching which would persuade us to disregard ethical standards\r\nin international relations, and of the no less hurtful folly which\r\nwould stop the whole work of civilization by a well-meant but silly\r\npersistency in trying to apply to peoples unfitted for them those\r\ntheories of government and of national action which are only suited\r\nfor the most advanced races. In particular, we must remember that in\r\nundertaking to build the Panama Canal we have necessarily undertaken\r\nto police the seas at either end of it; and this means that we have\r\na peculiar interest in the preservation of order in the coasts and\r\nislands of the Caribbean. I firmly believe that by a little wise and\r\ngenerous aid we can help even the most backward of the peoples in\r\nthese coasts and islands forward along the path of orderly liberty so\r\nthat they can stand alone. If we decline to give them such help the\r\nresult will be bad both for them and for us; and will in the end in all\r\nprobability cause us to face humiliation or bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe problems that face us abroad are important, but the problems that\r\nface us at home are even more important. The extraordinary growth\r\nof industrialism during the last half century brings every civilized\r\npeople face to face with the gravest social and economic questions.\r\nThis is an age of combination among capitalists and combination among\r\nwage-workers. It is idle to try to prevent such combinations. Our\r\nefforts should be to see that they work for the good and not for the\r\nharm of the body politic. New devices of law are necessary from time to\r\ntime in order to meet the changed and changing conditions. But after\r\nall we will do well to remember that, although the problems to be\r\nsolved change from generation to generation, the spirit in which their\r\nsolution must be attempted remains forever the same. It is in peace\r\nas it is in war. Tactics change and weapons change. The Continental\r\ntroops in their blue and buff, who fought under Washington and Greene\r\nand Wayne, differed entirely in arms and in training from those who\r\nin blue or gray faced one another in the armies of Grant and of Lee,\r\nof Sherman and of Johnston. And now the sons of these same Union and\r\nConfederate veterans, who serve in our gallant little army of to-day,\r\nwear a different uniform, carry a different weapon, and practice\r\ndifferent tactics. But the soul of the soldier has remained the same\r\nthroughout, and the qualities which drove forward to victory or to\r\ndeath the men of ’76 and the men of ’61 are the very qualities which\r\nthe men of to-day must keep unchanged if in the hour of need the honor\r\nof the Nation is to be kept untarnished. So it is in civil life. This\r\nGovernment was formed with as its basic idea the principle of treating\r\neach man on his worth as a man, of paying no heed to whether he was\r\nrich or poor, no heed to his creed or his social standing, but only to\r\nthe way in which he performed his duty to himself, to his neighbor, to\r\nthe state. From this principle we can not afford to vary by so much as\r\na hand’s breadth. Many republics have risen in the past, and some of\r\nthem flourished long, but sooner or later they fell; and the cause most\r\npotent in bringing about their fall was in almost all cases the fact\r\nthat they grew to be governments in the interest of a class instead of\r\ngovernments in the interest of all. It made no difference as to which\r\nclass it was that thus wrested to its own advantage the governmental\r\nmachinery. It was ultimately as fatal to the cause of freedom whether\r\nit was the rich who oppressed the poor or the poor who plundered the\r\nrich. The crime of brutal disregard of the rights of others is as much\r\na crime when it manifests itself in the shape of greed and brutal\r\narrogance on the one side, as when it manifests itself in the shape of\r\nenvy and lawless violence on the other. Our aim must be to deal justice\r\nto each man; no more and no less. This purpose must find its expression\r\nand support not merely in our collective action through the agencies of\r\nthe Government, but in our social attitude. Rich man and poor man must\r\nalike feel that on the one hand they are protected by law and that on\r\nthe other hand they are responsible to the law; for each is entitled\r\nto be fairly dealt with by his neighbor and by the State; and if we as\r\ncitizens of this Nation are true to ourselves and to the traditions of\r\nour forefathers such fair measure of justice shall always be dealt to\r\neach man; so that as far as we can bring it about each shall receive\r\nhis dues, each shall be given the chance to show the stuff there is\r\nin him, shall be secured against wrong, and in turn prevented from\r\nwronging others. More than this no man is entitled to, and less than\r\nthis no man shall have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE LUNCHEON AT RICHMOND, VA., OCTOBER 18, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mayor, Governor, and you, my Hosts_:\r\n\r\nOne among the very many great Virginians at the time when this Nation\r\nwas born—Patrick Henry—said: “We are no longer New Yorkers or New\r\nEnglanders, Pennsylvanians or Virginians, we are Americans.” And\r\nsurely, Mr. Mayor, the man would be but a poor American who was not\r\ntouched and stirred to the depths by the reception that I have met\r\nwith to-day in this great historic city of America. Coming to-day\r\nby the statue of Stonewall Jackson, in the city of Lee, I felt what\r\na privilege it is that I, as an American, have in claiming that you\r\nyourselves have no more right of kinship in Lee and Jackson than I\r\nhave. I can claim to be a middling good American, because my ancestry\r\nwas half Southern and half Northern; I was born in the East and I have\r\nlived a good while in the West—so long in fact that I do not admit that\r\nany man can be a better Westerner than I am. In short, gentlemen, I\r\nclaim to be neither Northerner nor Southerner, neither Easterner nor\r\nWesterner, but a good American, pure and simple.\r\n\r\nNext only to a man’s having worn the blue comes the fact of the man’s\r\nhaving worn the gray, as entitling him to honor in my sight. Last year\r\nI told General Fitzhugh Lee that I wanted to add to my collection of\r\nautograph letters of great Americans—Lincoln, Grant, Clay, Jefferson\r\n(turning to the Governor), your namesake, Andrew Jackson—that of\r\nGeneral Lee, with his photograph. I got from General Fitzhugh Lee a\r\nletter of General Lee and a photograph of him, handed to me after\r\nGeneral Fitzhugh Lee’s death. I was not able to thank my old and valued\r\nfriend, the father, but I put the son on my staff; and now I have the\r\ngrandson of General Grant and the grandnephew of General Lee and the\r\nson of Phil Sheridan on my staff.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the statue of Stonewall Jackson had been raised as a\r\ngift by certain Englishmen. The best biography of General Jackson\r\nwas by an Englishman, Colonel Henderson. It is a curious and rather\r\nlamentable fact that he died just as he was about to undertake another\r\nbiography which I had earnestly asked him to undertake. I had written\r\nhim urging that he should finish his very remarkable military study of\r\nStonewall Jackson by writing a military biography of General Lee, and\r\nhe had written me back that he intended to do so. Shortly afterward I\r\nlearned of his death.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I can not sufficiently express to you my deep appreciation\r\nof the way in which you have greeted me here to-day. You can not be\r\nnearly as glad to see me as I am to see you. Let me say once more what\r\nI said in my more formal address. Think of the good fortune that is\r\nours, think of the good fortune that is ours as a people in having,\r\neach of us, whether we in our own persons or through our ancestors,\r\nwore the blue or the gray, the proud right to challenge as our own all\r\nof the valor, all of the self-devotion, all of the steadfast adherence\r\nto right as God gave to each man to see the right, shown alike by the\r\nman who wore the blue and by the man who wore the gray in the great\r\ncontest that was waged from ’61 to ’65.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT RALEIGH, N. C., OCTOBER 19, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI am glad here at the capital of North Carolina to have a chance to\r\ngreet so many of the sons and daughters of your great State. North\r\nCarolina’s part in our history has ever been high and honorable.\r\nIt was in North Carolina that the Mecklenburg Declaration of\r\nIndependence foreshadowed the course taken in a few short months by the\r\nrepresentatives of the thirteen colonies assembled in Philadelphia.\r\nNorth Carolina can rightfully say that she pointed us the way which\r\nled to the formation of the new Nation. In the Revolution she did\r\nmany memorable deeds; and the battle of King’s Mountain marked the\r\nturning point of the Revolutionary War in the South. But I congratulate\r\nyou not only upon your past, but upon your present. I congratulate\r\nyou upon the great industrial activity shown in your Commonwealth—an\r\nindustrial activity which, to mention but one thing, has placed this\r\nState second only to one other in the number of its textile factories.\r\nYou are showing in practical fashion your realization of the truth that\r\nthere must be a foundation of material well-being in order that any\r\ncommunity may make real and rapid progress. And I am happy to say that\r\nyou are in addition showing in practical fashion your understanding\r\nof the great truth that this material well-being, though necessary as\r\na foundation, can only be the foundation, and that upon it must be\r\nraised the superstructure of a higher life, if the Commonwealth is\r\nto stand as it should stand. More and more you are giving care and\r\nattention to education; and education means the promotion not only of\r\nindustry, but of that good citizenship which rests upon individual\r\nrights and upon the recognition by each individual that he has duties\r\nas well as rights—in other words, of that good citizenship which\r\nrests upon moral integrity and intellectual freedom. The man must be\r\ndecent in his home life, his private life, of course; but this is\r\nnot by itself enough. The man who fails to be honest and brave both\r\nin his political franchise and in his private business contributes\r\nto political and social anarchy. Self-government is not an easy\r\nthing. Only those communities are fit for it in which the average\r\nindividual practices the virtue of self-command, of self-restraint,\r\nof wise disinterestedness combined with wise self-interest; where the\r\nindividual possesses common-sense, honesty, and courage.\r\n\r\nAnd now I want to say a word to you on a special subject in which all\r\nthe country is concerned, but in which North Carolina has a special\r\nconcern. The preservation of the forests is vital to the welfare of\r\nevery country. China and the Mediterranean countries offer examples of\r\nthe terrible effect of deforestation upon the physical geography, and\r\ntherefore ultimately upon the national well-being, of the nations. One\r\nof the most obvious duties which our generation owes to the generations\r\nthat are to come after us is to preserve the existing forests. The\r\nprime difference between civilized and uncivilized peoples is that\r\nin civilized peoples each generation works not only for its own\r\nwell-being, but for the well-being of the generations yet unborn, and\r\nif we permit the natural resources of this land to be destroyed so that\r\nwe hand over to our children a heritage diminished in value we thereby\r\nprove our unfitness to stand in the forefront of civilized peoples.\r\nOne of the greatest of these heritages is our forest wealth. It is the\r\nupper altitudes of the forested mountains that are most valuable to the\r\nNation as a whole, especially because of their effects upon the water\r\nsupply. Neither State nor Nation can afford to turn these mountains\r\nover to the unrestrained greed of those who would exploit them at the\r\nexpense of the future. We can not afford to wait longer before assuming\r\ncontrol, in the interest of the public, of these forests; for if we do\r\nwait, the vested interests of private parties in them may become so\r\nstrongly intrenched that it may be a most serious as well as a most\r\nexpensive task to oust them. If the Eastern States are wise, then from\r\nthe Bay of Fundy to the Gulf we will see, within the next few years, a\r\npolicy set on foot similar to that so fortunately carried out in the\r\nhigh Sierras of the West by the National Government. All the higher\r\nAppalachians should be reserved, either by the States or by the Nation.\r\nI much prefer that they should be put under National control, but it\r\nis a mere truism to say that they will not be reserved either by the\r\nStates or by the Nation unless you people of the South show a strong\r\ninterest therein.\r\n\r\nSuch reserves would be a paying investment, not only in protection\r\nto many interests, but in dollars and cents to the Government. The\r\nimportance to the Southern people of protecting the Southern mountain\r\nforests is obvious. These forests are the best defence against the\r\nfloods which in the recent past have, during a single twelvemonth,\r\ndestroyed property officially valued at nearly twice what it would\r\ncost to buy the Southern Appalachian Reserve. The maintenance of your\r\nSouthern water powers is not less important than the prevention of\r\nfloods, because if they are injured your manufacturing interests will\r\nsuffer with them. The perpetuation of your forests, which have done so\r\nmuch for the South, should be one of the first objects of your public\r\nmen. The two Senators from North Carolina have taken an honorable part\r\nin this movement. But I do not think that the people of North Carolina\r\nor of any other Southern State have quite grasped the importance of\r\nthis movement to the commercial development and prosperity of the South.\r\n\r\nThe position of honor in your parade to-day is held by the Confederate\r\nveterans. They by their deeds reflect credit upon their descendants and\r\nupon all Americans, both because they did their duty in war and because\r\nthey did their duty in peace. Now if the young men, their sons, will\r\nnot only prove that they possess the same power of fealty to an ideal,\r\nbut will also show the efficiency in the ranks of industrial life that\r\ntheir fathers, the Confederate veterans, showed that they possessed in\r\nthe ranks of war, the industrial future of this great and typically\r\nAmerican Commonwealth is assured.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary development of industrialism during the last half\r\ncentury has been due to several causes, but above all to the revolution\r\nin the methods of transportation and communication; that is, to steam\r\nand to electricity, to the railroad and the telegraph.\r\n\r\nWhen this Government was founded commerce was carried on by essentially\r\nthe same instruments that had been in use not only among civilized,\r\nbut among barbarian, nations, ever since history dawned; that is, by\r\nwheeled vehicles drawn by animals, by pack trains, and by sailing\r\nships and rowboats. On land this meant that commerce went in slow,\r\ncumbrous, and expensive fashion over highways open to all. Normally\r\nthese highways could not compete with water transportation, if such was\r\nfeasible between the connecting points.\r\n\r\nAll this has been changed by the development of the railroads. Save\r\non the ocean or on lakes so large as to be practically inland seas,\r\ntransport by water has wholly lost its old position of superiority\r\nover transport by land, while instead of the old highways open to\r\nevery one on the same terms, but of a very limited usefulness, we have\r\nnew highways—railroads—which are owned by private corporations and\r\nwhich are practically of unlimited, instead of limited, usefulness.\r\nThe old laws and old customs which were adequate and proper to meet\r\nthe old conditions need radical readjustment in order to meet these\r\nnew conditions. The cardinal features in these changed conditions\r\nare, first, the fact that the new highway, the railway, is, from\r\nthe commercial standpoint, of infinitely greater importance in our\r\nindustrial life than was the old highway, the wagon road; and, second,\r\nthat this new highway, the railway, is in the hands of private owners,\r\nwhereas the old highway, the wagon road, was in the hands of the\r\nState. The management of the new highway, the railroad, or rather of\r\nthe intricate web of railroad lines which cover the country, is a\r\ntask infinitely more difficult, more delicate, and more important than\r\nthe primitively easy task of acquiring or keeping in order the old\r\nhighway; so that there is properly no analogy whatever between the two\r\ncases. I do not believe in government ownership of anything which can\r\nwith propriety be left in private hands, and in particular I should\r\nmost strenuously object to government ownership of railroads. But I\r\nbelieve with equal firmness that it is out of the question for the\r\nGovernment not to exercise a supervisory and regulatory right over the\r\nrailroads; for it is vital to the well-being of the public that they\r\nshould be managed in a spirit of fairness and justice toward all the\r\npublic. Actual experience has shown that it is not possible to leave\r\nthe railroads uncontrolled. Such a system, or rather such a lack of\r\nsystem, is fertile in abuses of every kind, and puts a premium upon\r\nunscrupulous and ruthless cunning in railroad management; for there are\r\nsome big shippers and some railroad managers who are always willing to\r\ntake unfair advantage of their weaker competitors, and they thereby\r\nforce other big shippers and big railroad men who would like to do\r\ndecently into similar acts of wrong and injustice, under penalty of\r\nbeing left behind in the race for success. Government supervision is\r\nneeded quite as much in the interest of the big shipper and of the\r\nrailroad man who want to do right as in the interest of the small\r\nshipper and the consumer.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the present laws are defective and need\r\namendment. The effort to prohibit all restraint of competition, whether\r\nreasonable or unreasonable, is unwise. What we need is to have some\r\nadministrative body with ample power to forbid combination that is\r\nhurtful to the public, and to prevent favoritism to one individual\r\nat the expense of another. In other words, we want an administrative\r\nbody with the power to secure fair and just treatment as among all\r\nshippers who use the railroads—and all shippers have a right to use\r\nthem. We must not leave the enforcement of such a law merely to the\r\nDepartment of Justice; it is out of the question for the law department\r\nof the Government to do what should be purely administrative work.\r\nThe Department of Justice is to stand behind and co-operate with the\r\nadministrative body, but the administrative body itself must be given\r\nthe power to do the work and then held to a strict accountability for\r\nthe exercise of that power. The delays of the law are proverbial, and\r\nwhat we need in this matter is reasonable quickness of action.\r\n\r\nThe abuses of which we have a genuine right to complain take many\r\nshapes. Rebates are not now often given openly. But they can be given\r\njust as effectively in covert form; and private cars, terminal tracks,\r\nand the like must be brought under the control of the commission or\r\nadministrative body which is to exercise supervision by the Government.\r\nBut in my judgment the most important thing to do is to give to this\r\nadministrative body power to make its findings effective, and this can\r\nbe done only by giving it power, when complaint is made of a given rate\r\nas being unjust or unreasonable, if it finds the complaint proper, then\r\nitself to fix a maximum rate which it regards as just and reasonable,\r\nthis rate to go into effect practically at once, that is within a\r\nreasonable time, and to stay in effect unless reversed by the courts.\r\nI earnestly hope that we shall see a law giving this power passed by\r\nCongress. Moreover, I hope that by law power will be conferred upon\r\nrepresentatives of the Government capable of performing the duty of\r\npublic accountants carefully to examine into the books of railroads\r\nwhen so ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which should\r\nitself have power to prescribe what books, and what books only, should\r\nbe kept by railroads. If there is in the minds of the Commission any\r\nsuspicion that a certain railroad is in any shape or way giving rebates\r\nor behaving improperly, I wish the Commission to have power as a matter\r\nof right, not as a matter of favor, to make a full and exhaustive\r\ninvestigation of the receipts and expenditures of the railroad, so\r\nthat any violation or evasion of the law may be detected. This is not\r\na revolutionary proposal on my part, for I only wish the same power\r\ngiven in reference to railroads that is now exercised as a matter\r\nof course by the national bank examiners as regards national banks.\r\nMy object in giving these additional powers to the administrative\r\nbody representing the Government—the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nor whatever it may be—is primarily to secure a real and not a sham\r\ncontrol to the Government representatives. The American people abhor a\r\nsham, and with this abhorrence I cordially sympathize. Nothing is more\r\ninjurious from every standpoint than a law which is merely sound and\r\nfury, merely pretence, and not capable of working out tangible results.\r\nI hope to see all the power that I think it ought to have granted to\r\nthe Government; but I would far rather see only some of it granted, but\r\nreally granted, than see a pretence of granting all in some shape that\r\nreally amounts to nothing.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood, as a matter of course, that if this power\r\nis granted it is to be exercised with wisdom and caution and\r\nself-restraint. The Interstate Commerce Commissioner or other\r\nGovernment official who failed to protect a railroad that was in the\r\nright against any clamor, no matter how violent, on the part of the\r\npublic, would be guilty of as gross a wrong as if he corruptly rendered\r\nan improper service to the railroad at the expense of the public. When\r\nI say a square deal I mean a square deal; exactly as much a square deal\r\nfor the rich man as for the poor man; but no more. Let each stand on\r\nhis merits, receive what is due him, and be judged according to his\r\ndeserts. To more he is not entitled, and less he shall not have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN PRESENTING THE PATTERSON MEMORIAL CUP TO MR. JOHN CHARLES\r\n  McNEILL, IN THE SENATE CHAMBER, RALEIGH, N. C., OCTOBER 19, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. McNeill_:\r\n\r\nI feel, and I am sure all good Americans must feel, that it is far\r\nfrom enough for us to develop merely a great material prosperity. I\r\nappreciate, and all of us must, that it is indispensable to have the\r\nmaterial prosperity as a foundation, but if we think the foundation\r\nis the entire building, we never shall rank as among the nations of\r\nthe world; and therefore, it is with peculiar pleasure that I find\r\nmyself playing a small part in a movement, such as this, by which one\r\nof the thirteen original States, one of our great States, marks its\r\nsense of proper proportion in estimating the achievements of life,\r\nthe achievements of which the Commonwealth has a right to be proud.\r\nIt is a good thing to have the sense of historic continuity with the\r\npast, which we largely get through the efforts of just such historic\r\nsocieties as this, through which this cup is awarded to you. It is an\r\neven better thing to try to do what we can to show our pleasure in and\r\napproval of productive literary work in the present. Mr. McNeill, I\r\ncongratulate you and North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT DURHAM, N. C., OCTOBER 19, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mayor, People of Durham, and Undergraduates and Graduates of\r\n  Trinity College_:\r\n\r\nI know that the citizens of Durham will not begrudge my making a\r\nspecial address to the representatives of a great typical Southern\r\ncollege, which, because it is a typical Southern college, is a typical\r\nAmerican college. In speaking to-day to you undergraduates and\r\ngraduates of Trinity (and when I speak to the graduates of Trinity, I\r\nspeak to both the United States Senators of North Carolina—a pretty\r\ngood showing for one college—) I speak not only to you, but through you\r\nto the college men of the South. I have been more impressed than I can\r\nwell express by the first article in the constitution of Trinity—the\r\narticle that sets forth the aims of the college. Not for your sake (for\r\nyou are familiar with it), but for the sake of all college men, North\r\nand South, I am going to read that article:\r\n\r\n“The aims of Trinity College are to assert a faith in the eternal union\r\nof knowledge and religion set forth in the teachings and character\r\nof Jesus Christ, the Son of God; to advance learning in all lines of\r\ntruth; to defend scholarship against all false notions and ideals; to\r\ndevelop a Christian love of freedom and truth; to educate a sincere\r\nspirit of tolerance; to discourage all partisan and sectarian strife,\r\nand to render the largest permanent service to the individual, the\r\nState, the Nation, and the Church. Unto these ends shall the affairs of\r\nthis college always be administered.”\r\n\r\nI know of no other college which has so nobly set forth as the object\r\nof its being the principles to which every college should be devoted,\r\nin whatever portion of this Union it may be placed. You stand for all\r\nthose things for which the scholar must stand if he is to render real\r\nand lasting service to the state. You stand for academic freedom, for\r\nthe right of private judgment, for the duty, more incumbent upon the\r\nscholar than upon any other man, to tell the truth as he sees it, to\r\nclaim for himself and give to others the largest liberty in seeking\r\nafter the truth. There must be no coercion of opinion if collegiate\r\ntraining is to bring forth its full fruit. You men of this college, you\r\nmen throughout the South, who have had collegiate training, you men\r\nthroughout the Union, who have had collegiate training, bear a peculiar\r\nburden of responsibility. I want you to have a good time, and I believe\r\nyou do. I believe in play with all my heart. Play when you play, but\r\nwork when you work; and remember that your having gone through college\r\ndoes not so much confer a special privilege as it imposes a special\r\nobligation on you. We have a right to expect a special quality of\r\nleadership from the men to whom much has been given in the way of a\r\ncollegiate education. You are not entitled to any special privilege,\r\nbut you are entitled to be held to a peculiar accountability; you have\r\nearned the right to be held peculiarly responsible for what you do.\r\nEach one of you, if he is worth his salt, wishes, when he graduates, to\r\npay some portion of the debt due to his alma mater. You have received\r\nfrom her, during your years of attendance in her halls, certain\r\nprivileges in the way of scholarship, in the way of companionship,\r\nwhich makes it incumbent upon you to repay what you have been given.\r\nYou can not repay that to the college save in one way: by the quality\r\nof your citizenship as displayed in the actual affairs of life you can\r\nmake it an honor to the college to have sent you forth into the great\r\nworld. That is the only way in which you can repay to the college what\r\nthe college has done for you. I earnestly hope and believe that you and\r\nthose like you in all the colleges of this land will make it evident\r\nto the generation that is rising that you are fit to take leadership,\r\nthat the training has not been wasted, that you are ready to render to\r\nthe state the kind of service which is invaluable, because it can not\r\nbe bought, because there is no price that can be put upon it. We have\r\nthe right to expect from college men not merely disinterested service,\r\nbut intelligent service. The free peoples who exercise self-government\r\nalways have to war not merely against the knavish man who deliberately\r\ndoes what he knows to be wrong, but against the foolish man, who may\r\nmean very well, but who in actual fact turns out the ally of the other\r\nman who does not mean well; and we must depend upon you men who have\r\nbeen given special facilities in education to guide our people aright\r\nso that they shall neither fall into the pit of folly nor into the pit\r\nof knavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT GREENSBORO, N. C., OCTOBER 19, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nNo man could fail to be made a better American by traveling through\r\nthis great historic State of yours, where, throughout his journey,\r\nhe sees place after place associated with the historic past, such as\r\nthis city of yours near the Guilford battleground, commemorating by\r\nits name one of Washington’s great generals. North Carolina’s history\r\nhas ever been high and honorable. It is right that we should remember\r\nthat the mighty deeds of our forefathers are not to serve to us as\r\nexcuses for inaction on our part, but as spurs to drive us forward to\r\ndoing our duty in our turn. We respect the son of a worthy father if\r\nhe feels that the fact that his father did well makes it incumbent\r\nupon him to strive to do better. We despise the boy who treats the\r\nfact that his father counted for something as being an excuse for his\r\ncounting for nothing. So I am glad to note the care that you in this\r\nState are giving to education. The greatness of the country in the\r\ntime immediately to come will depend upon the way in which the young\r\ngeneration of to-day is trained to citizenship in the future. I am\r\nsorry to say that there is probably no one here who is not acquainted\r\nwith some kindly, well-meaning, and most foolish father or mother\r\nwho, because life has been hard with him or her in the past, takes the\r\nview that the children are not to have to face any difficulties. The\r\nworst thing that you can do for a child is to bring up him or her to\r\ndodge difficulties. The children who will rise up to call their parents\r\nblessed are those whom the parents have trained to meet difficulties,\r\nnot to shirk them; to overcome obstacles, not to get out of the way for\r\nthem. Neither the individual nor the community is worth anything if it\r\nseeks after that which is easy. The thing to do is to find out what is\r\nworth doing and do it—to show the manly quality that allows of this\r\nbeing done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT CHARLOTTE, N. C., OCTOBER 19, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed more than I can say passing through this great State\r\nto-day. I entered your borders a pretty good American, and I leave\r\nthem a better American. I have rejoiced in the symptoms of your\r\nabounding material prosperity. I am here in a great centre of cotton\r\nmanufacturing. Within a radius of a hundred miles of this city probably\r\nhalf of the cotton manufacturing of the United States is done. I\r\nrealize to the full, as every good citizen should realize, that there\r\nmust be a foundation of material prosperity upon which to build the\r\nwelfare of State or Nation; but I realize also, as every good citizen\r\nshould, that material prosperity, material well-being, can never be\r\nanything but the foundation. It is the indispensable foundation; but\r\nif we do not raise upon it the superstructure of a higher citizenship\r\nthen we fail in bringing this country to the level to which it shall\r\nand will be brought.\r\n\r\nSo, though I congratulate you upon what you have done in the way of\r\nmaterial growth, I congratulate you even more upon the great historic\r\nmemories of your State. It is not so far from here that the Mecklenburg\r\nDeclaration of Independence was made; the declaration that pointed out\r\nthe path along which the thirteen united colonies trod but a few months\r\nlater. As I got off the train here I was greeted by one citizen of\r\nNorth Carolina (and I know that neither the Governor, the Mayor, nor\r\nthe Senators will blame me for what I am going to say) whose greeting\r\npleased and touched me more than the greeting of any man could have\r\ntouched me. I was greeted by the widow of Stonewall Jackson. We, of\r\nthis united country, have a right to challenge, as part of the heritage\r\nof honor and glory of each American, the renown bought by all Americans\r\nwho fought in the Civil War, whether they wore the blue or whether they\r\nwore the gray. The valor shown alike by the men of the North and by\r\nthe men of the South, as they battled for the right as God gave them\r\nto see the right, is now part of what we all of us keep with pride. It\r\nwas my good fortune to appoint to West Point the grandson of Stonewall\r\nJackson. As I came up your streets I saw a monument raised to a\r\nfellow-soldier of mine who fell in the Spanish War at Santiago—Shipp,\r\nof North Carolina. We, who went to war in ’98, had the opportunity only\r\nto fight in a small war, and all that we would claim is that we hope we\r\nshowed a spirit not entirely unworthy of the men who faced the mighty\r\nand terrible days from ’61 to ’65. If there again comes a war I know I\r\ncan count on the men of the National Guard, like my escort, because the\r\nmemory of what your fathers did will make you ashamed not to rise level\r\nto the demands of the new time as they rose level to the demands of\r\ntheir time.\r\n\r\nIn civil life each generation has its problems. The tremendous\r\nindustrial development of the past half century, the very development\r\nwhich has produced cities such as this, has brought great problems\r\nwith it; problems connected with corporations; problems connected\r\nwith labor; problems connected with both the accumulation and the\r\ndistribution of wealth. The problems are new, but the spirit in which\r\nwe must approach their solution is old. We must face the work we have\r\nto do as our fathers faced their work, if we wish to be successful.\r\nThis is an age of organization, the organization of capital, the\r\norganization of labor. Each type of organization should be welcomed\r\nwhen it does good, and fearlessly opposed when it does evil. Our aim\r\nshould be to strive to keep the reign of justice alive in this country\r\nso that we shall above all things avoid the chance of ever dividing on\r\nthe lines that separate one class from another, one occupation from\r\nanother. The man who would preach to either wage-worker or capitalist\r\nthat the other was his foe is a bad citizen and faithless American.\r\nWe can afford to divide along lines that represent honest difference\r\nof opinion, but we can not afford to divide on the fundamental lines\r\nof cleavage that separate good citizens from bad citizens. We must\r\nremember, if we intend to keep this Republic in its position of\r\nheadship among the nations of mankind, that we can never afford to\r\ndeviate from the old American doctrine of treating each man on his\r\nworth as a man, of paying heed, not to whether he is rich or poor, but\r\nonly to whether he acts as a decent citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT ROSWELL, GA., OCTOBER 20, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Senator Clay; and you, My Friends, whom it is hard for me not to call\r\n  My Neighbors, for I feel as if you were_:\r\n\r\nYou can have no idea of how much it means to me to come back to\r\nRoswell, to the home of my mother and of my mother’s people, and to see\r\nthe spot which I already know so well from what my mother and my aunt\r\ntold me. It has been exactly as if I were revisiting some old place of\r\nmy childhood.\r\n\r\nI hardly like to say how deeply my heart is moved by coming back\r\nhere among you. Among the earliest recollections I have as a child\r\nis hearing from my mother and my aunt (Miss Annie Bulloch, she then\r\nwas) about Roswell; of how the Pratts, and Kings, and Dunwoodys, and\r\nBullochs came here first to settle; about the old homestead, the\r\nhouse on the hill; about the Chattahoochee; about all kinds and sorts\r\nof incidents that would not interest you, but interested me a great\r\ndeal when I was a child. I wish I could spend hours here to look all\r\nthrough and see the different places about which I have heard all\r\nkinds of incidents. All those anecdotes, looking back now, I can see\r\ntaught me an enormous amount, perhaps all the more because they were\r\nnot intended to teach anything. I think we are very apt to learn most\r\nwhen neither we nor the people talking to us intend to teach anything.\r\nAll those stories of the life of those days taught me what a real home\r\nlife, a real neighbor life, was and should be. Looking back now at\r\nwhat I learned through those stories of the childhood of my mother,\r\nmy aunts, my uncles, I can understand why the boys and girls of the\r\nRoswell of that time grew up to be men and women who were good servants\r\nof the community, who were good husbands, good fathers, good wives and\r\nmothers; how it was that they learned to do their duty aright in peace\r\nand in war also.\r\n\r\nIt is my very great good fortune to have the right to claim that my\r\nblood is half Southern and half Northern; and I would deny the right of\r\nany man here to feel a greater pride in the deeds of every Southerner\r\nthan I feel. Of the children, the brothers and sisters of my mother who\r\nwere born and brought up in that house on the hill over there, my two\r\nuncles afterward entered the Confederate service, and served in the\r\nConfederate Navy. One, the younger man, served on the “Alabama” as the\r\nyoungest officer aboard her. He was captain of one of her broadside\r\n32-pounders in her final fight, and when at the very end the “Alabama”\r\nwas sinking, and the “Kearsarge” passed under her stern and came up\r\nalong the side that had not been engaged hitherto, my uncle, Irving\r\nBulloch, shifted his gun from one side to the other and fired the\r\nlast two shots fired from the “Alabama.” The other, the elder, James\r\nDunwoody Bulloch, was an admiral in the Confederate service. Of all the\r\npeople whom I have ever met he was the one that came nearest to that\r\nbeautiful creation of Thackeray—Colonel Newcome.\r\n\r\nMen and women, don’t you think that I have the ancestral right to claim\r\na proud kinship with those who showed their devotion to duty as they\r\nsaw the duty, whether they wore the gray or whether they wore the blue?\r\nAll Americans who are worthy the name feel an equal pride in the valor\r\nof those who fought on one side or the other, provided only that each\r\ndid with all his strength and soul and mind his duty as it was given\r\nhim to see his duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT PIEDMONT PARK, ATLANTA, GA., OCTOBER 20, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governor; Mr. Mayor; and you, My Valued Friend, Senator Clay; and\r\n  you, Men and Women of Georgia; Men and Women of my Mother’s State;\r\n  My Fellow-Citizens and Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly express the feeling of gratitude I have for the\r\nreception given to me to-day. I want to give you a word of explanation\r\nas to what the Senator last said. The Senator said quite truly that\r\nwhen I was in doubt as to the capacity or honesty of any man I was\r\nseeking to appoint, or the wisdom of any policy, I was in the habit\r\nof going to him. I will tell you why: because the Senator does what I\r\nhope I try to do and what I have preached. Whenever I go to the Senator\r\nI know I get a square deal. As I said once before to-day, the Senator\r\ncomes in that group of men upon whose advice I, like every other\r\nAmerican President who wishes to do what is best for the people, must\r\nrely. If you will come down to bed-rock fact, the party differences\r\nare mighty small compared to the common interests that all of us have\r\nas Americans. On the great majority of questions, on almost all the\r\nimportant questions that come up, what you want in public life is to\r\nfind the public man who cares for the interests of the people, and\r\nwho not only cares for them, but has the sense to know how to make\r\nthat care effective. I have found that I could consult Senator Clay\r\nwith absolute freedom and absolute confidence in his good faith and\r\nsincere desire to do what was best for our people. All I had to do\r\nwas to convince him that I was right. I was not always successful in\r\nconvincing him; but if I did convince him I knew he would stand up for\r\nwhat he thought right.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking to all of you here together let me say just one word\r\nsuggested by the generous and unexpected gift presented to me by the\r\nrepresentatives of organized labor here in Atlanta. I am speaking\r\nin this mighty city, an industrial centre of the Union, in a great\r\nagricultural State. It is of course a mere truism to say that if the\r\nmen who till the soil and the wage-workers are well off the rest of\r\nthe people will be well off; and it is the part of wise statesmanship\r\nto try primarily to do all that can be done for the farmers, the men\r\nwho live on the land, who work on the land, and for the wage-workers,\r\nthe men who actually do the work with their hands. It has been my good\r\nfortune to be an honorary member of a union of wage-workers. There\r\nare few honors that I have ever had of which I am prouder than that.\r\nI believe in organized labor; and I will do all that in me lies for\r\nthe wage-worker, except to do wrong, and if I was willing to do that I\r\nwould not be his true friend or any one else’s.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken to the farmer and the wage-worker, let me say just one\r\nword to the men of the great Civil War, to the men who fought from\r\n’61 to ’65. I am sure that you would be pleased if you could hear the\r\napplause that greets, in any audience in the North, any allusion to\r\nthe valor, the self-devotion, the fealty to right as God gave them to\r\nsee the right, of the men who wore the gray in the great contest forty\r\nyears ago. We are indeed thrice fortunate as a people; because to us it\r\nhas been given alone among peoples in modern times to pass through one\r\nof the most terrible contests of history; and, now that the bitterness\r\nhas died away, to cherish as our most precious heritage the memories\r\nbequeathed to us alike by the men in blue and the men in gray, alike by\r\nthose who followed Grant and those who followed Lee, because each man\r\nshowed his readiness to sacrifice all, to sacrifice life itself, upon\r\nthe altar of duty as he saw it.\r\n\r\nIt is eminently appropriate that the representatives of organized labor\r\nshould be called upon to play a part in any ceremonies in a great\r\nindustrial city like this; and that incident alone would justify my\r\nchoice of subjects to-day.\r\n\r\nHere in this great industrial centre, in this city which is a typical\r\nSouthern city, and therefore a typical American city, it is natural\r\nto consider certain phases of the many-sided industrial problem which\r\nthis generation has to solve. In this world of ours it is practically\r\nimpossible to get success of any kind on a large scale without paying\r\nsomething for it. The exceptions to the rule are too few to warrant\r\nour paying heed to them; and as a rule it may be said that something\r\nmust be paid as an offset for everything we get and for everything\r\nwe accomplish. This is notably true of our industrial life. The\r\nproblems which we of America have to face to-day are very serious,\r\nbut we will do well to remember that after all they are only part of\r\nthe price which we have to pay for the triumphs we have won, for the\r\nhigh position to which we have attained. If we were a backward and\r\nstationary country we would not have to face these problems at all; but\r\nI think that most of us are agreed that to be backward and stationary\r\nwould be altogether too heavy a price to pay for the avoidance of the\r\nproblems in question. There are no labor troubles where there is no\r\nwork to be done by labor. There are no troubles about corporations\r\nwhere the poverty of the community is such that it is not worth while\r\nto form corporations. There is no difficulty in regulating railroads\r\nwhere the resources of a region are so few that it does not pay to\r\nbuild railroads. There are many excellent people who shake their heads\r\nover the difficulties that as a nation we now have to face; but their\r\nmelancholy is not warranted save in a very partial degree, for most of\r\nthe things of which they complain are the inevitable accompaniments of\r\nthe growth and greatness of which we are proud.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not for one moment mean\r\nto say that there are not many and serious evils with which we have to\r\ngrapple, or that there are not unhealthy signs in the body social and\r\npolitic; but I do mean to say that while we must not show a foolish\r\noptimism we must no less beware of a mere blind pessimism. There is\r\nevery reason why we should be vigilant in searching out what is wrong\r\nand unflinchingly resolute in striving to remedy it. But at the same\r\ntime we must not blind ourselves to what has been accomplished for\r\ngood, and above all we must not lose our heads and become either\r\nhysterical or rancorous in grappling with what is bad.\r\n\r\nTake such a question, for instance, as the question, or rather the\r\ngroup of questions, connected with the growth of corporations in this\r\ncountry. This growth has meant, of course, the growth of individual\r\nfortunes. Undoubtedly the growth of wealth in this country has had some\r\nvery unfortunate accompaniments, but it seems to me that much the worst\r\ndamage that people of wealth can do the rest of us is not any actual\r\nphysical harm, but the awakening in our breasts of either the mean vice\r\nof worshiping mere wealth, and the man of mere wealth, for the wealth’s\r\nsake, or the equally mean vice of viewing with rancorous envy and\r\nhatred the men of wealth merely because they are men of wealth. Envy\r\nis, of course, merely a kind of crooked admiration; and we often see\r\nthe very man who in public is most intemperate in his denunciation of\r\nwealth, in his private life most eager to obtain wealth, in no matter\r\nwhat fashion, and at no matter what moral cost.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there is need of regulation by the Government, in the\r\ninterest of the public, of these great corporations which in\r\nmodern life have shown themselves to be the most efficient business\r\nimplements, and which are, therefore, the implements commonly employed\r\nby the owners of large fortunes. The corporation is the creature of the\r\nState. It should always be held accountable to some sovereign, and this\r\naccountability should be real and not sham. Therefore, in my judgment,\r\nall corporations doing an interstate business, and this means the great\r\nmajority of the largest corporations, should be held accountable to the\r\nFederal Government, because their accountability should be coextensive\r\nwith their field of action. But most certainly we should not strive to\r\nprevent or limit corporate activity. We should strive to secure such\r\neffective supervision over it, such power of regulation over it, as\r\nto enable us to guarantee that its activity will be exercised only in\r\nways beneficial to the public. The unwisdom of any well-meaning but\r\nmisguided effort to check corporate activity has been shown in striking\r\nfashion in recent years by our experience in the Philippines and in\r\nPorto Rico. Our national legislators very properly determined that the\r\nislands should not be exploited by adventurers without regard to the\r\ninterests of the people of the islands themselves. But unfortunately in\r\ntheir zeal to prevent the islands from being improperly exploited they\r\ntook measures of such severity as to seriously, and in some respects\r\nvitally, to hamper and retard the development of the islands. There is\r\nnothing that the islands need more than to have their great natural\r\nresources developed, and these resources can be developed only by\r\nthe abundant use of capital, which, of course, will not be put into\r\nthem unless on terms sufficiently advantageous to offer prospects of\r\ngood remuneration. We have made the terms not merely hard, but often\r\nprohibitory, with the result that American capital goes into foreign\r\ncountries, like Mexico, and is there used with immense advantage to\r\nthe country in its development, while it can not go into our own\r\npossessions or be used to develop the lands under our own flag. The\r\nchief sufferers by this state of things are the people of the islands\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible too strongly to insist upon what ought to be the\r\npatent fact, that it is not only in the interest of the people of\r\nwealth themselves, but in our interest, in the interest of the public\r\nas a whole, that they should be treated fairly and justly; that if they\r\nshow exceptional business ability they should be given exceptional\r\nreward for that ability. The tissues of our industrial fabric are\r\ninterwoven in such complex fashion that what strengthens or weakens\r\npart also strengthens or weakens the whole. If we penalize industry\r\nwe will ourselves in the end have to pay a considerable part of the\r\npenalty. If we make conditions such that the men of exceptional ability\r\nare able to secure marked benefits by the exercise of that ability,\r\nthen we shall ourselves benefit somewhat. It is our interest no less\r\nthan our duty to treat them fairly. On the other hand, it is no less\r\ntheir interest to treat us fairly—by “us” I mean the great body of\r\nthe people, the men of moderate or small fortunes, the farmers, the\r\nwage-workers, the smaller business men and professional men. The man\r\nof great means who achieves fortune by crooked methods does wrong to\r\nthe whole body politic. But he not merely does wrong to, he becomes a\r\nsource of imminent danger to, other men of great means; for his ill-won\r\nsuccess tends to arouse a feeling of resentment, which if it becomes\r\ninflamed fails to differentiate between the men of wealth who have done\r\ndecently and the men of wealth who have not done decently.\r\n\r\nThe conscience of our people has been deeply shocked by the revelations\r\nmade of recent years as to the way in which some of the great fortunes\r\nhave been obtained and used, and there is, I think, in the minds of the\r\npeople at large a strong feeling that a serious effort must be made\r\nto put a stop to the cynical dishonesty and contempt for right which\r\nhave thus been revealed. I believe that something, and I hope that a\r\ngood deal, can be done by law to remedy the state of things complained\r\nof. But when all that can be has thus been done, there will yet remain\r\nmuch which the law can not touch, and which must be reached by the\r\nforce of public opinion. There are men who do not divide actions merely\r\ninto those that are honest and those that are not, but create a third\r\nsubdivision—that of law honesty; of that kind of honesty which consists\r\nin keeping clear of the penitentiary. It is hard to reach astute men\r\nof this type save by making them feel the weight of an honest public\r\nindignation. But this indignation, if it is to be effective, must be\r\nintelligent. It is, of course, to the great advantage of dishonest\r\nmen of wealth if they are denounced, not for being dishonest, but for\r\nbeing wealthy, and if they are denounced in terms so overstrained and\r\nhysterical as to invite a reaction in their favor. We can not afford in\r\nthis country to draw the distinction as between rich man and poor man.\r\nThe distinction upon which we must insist is the vital, deep-lying,\r\nunchangeable distinction between the honest man and the dishonest\r\nman, between the man who acts decently and fairly by his neighbor and\r\nwith a quick sense of his obligations, and the man who acknowledges\r\nno internal law save that of his own will and appetite. Above all we\r\nshould treat with a peculiarly contemptuous abhorrence the man who in\r\na spirit of sheer cynicism debauches either our business life or our\r\npolitical life. There are men who use the phrase “practical politics”\r\nas merely a euphemism for dirty politics, and it is such men who have\r\nbrought the word “politician” into discredit. There are other men\r\nwho use the noxious phrase “business is business” as an excuse and\r\njustification for every kind of mean and crooked work; and these men\r\nmake honest Americans hang their heads because of some of the things\r\nthey do. It is the duty of every honest patriot to rebuke in emphatic\r\nfashion alike the politician who does not understand that the only kind\r\nof “practical politics” which a nation can with safety tolerate is\r\nthat kind which we know as clean politics, and that we are as severe\r\nin our condemnation of the business trickery which succeeds as of the\r\nbusiness trickery which fails. The scoundrel who fails can never by\r\nany possibility be as dangerous to the community as the scoundrel who\r\nsucceeds; and of all the men in the country, the worst citizens, those\r\nwho should excite in our minds the most contemptuous abhorrence, are\r\nthe men who have achieved great wealth, or any other form of success,\r\nin any save a clean and straightforward manner.\r\n\r\nSo much for the general subject of industrialism. Now, just a word\r\nin reference to one of the great staples of this country, which is\r\npeculiarly a staple of the Southern States. Of course I mean cotton. I\r\nam glad to see diversifications of industry in the South, the growth\r\nof manufactures as well as the growth of agriculture, and the growing\r\ngrowth of diversification of crops in agriculture. Nevertheless, it\r\nwill always be true that in certain of the Southern States cotton will\r\nbe the basis of the wealth, the mainstay of prosperity in the future\r\nas in the past. The cotton crop is of enormous consequence to the\r\nentire country. It was the cotton crop of the South that brought four\r\nhundred million dollars of foreign gold into the United States last\r\nyear, turning the balance of trade in our favor. The soil and climate\r\nof the South are such that she enjoys a practical monopoly in the\r\nproduction of raw cotton. No other clothing material can be accepted\r\nas a substitute for cotton. I welcome the action of the planters in\r\nforming a cotton association, and every assistance shall be given them\r\nthat can be given them by the National Government. Moreover, we must\r\nnot forget that the work of the manufacturer in the South supplements\r\nthe work of the planter. It is an advantage to manufacture the raw\r\nmaterial here and sell to the world the finished goods. Under proper\r\nmethods of distribution it may well be doubted whether there can be\r\nsuch a thing as overproduction of cotton. Last year’s crop was nearly\r\nfourteen million bales, and yet the price was sufficiently high to give\r\na handsome profit to the planter. The consumption of cotton increases\r\neach year, and new uses are found for it.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to a matter of our foreign relations which directly\r\nconcerns the cotton planter. At present our market for cotton is\r\nlargely in China. The boycott of our goods in China during the past\r\nyear was especially injurious to the cotton manufacturers. This\r\nGovernment is doing, and will continue to do, all it can to put a stop\r\nto the boycott. But there is one measure to be taken toward this end\r\nin which I shall need the assistance of the Congress. We must insist\r\nfirmly on our rights; and China must beware of persisting in a course\r\nof conduct to which we can not honorably submit. But we in our turn\r\nmust recognize our duties exactly as we insist upon our rights. We can\r\nnot go into the international court of equity unless we go in with\r\nclean hands. We can not expect China to do us justice unless we do\r\nChina justice. The chief cause in bringing about the boycott of our\r\ngoods in China was undoubtedly our attitude toward the Chinese who come\r\nto this country. This attitude of ours does not justify the action of\r\nthe Chinese in the boycott, and especially some of the forms which that\r\naction has taken. But the fact remains that in the past we have come\r\nshort of our duty toward the people of China. It is our clear duty,\r\nin the interest of our own wage-workers, to forbid all Chinese of the\r\ncoolie class—that is, laborers, skilled or unskilled—from coming here.\r\nThe greatest of all duties is national self-preservation, and the\r\nmost important step in national self-preservation is to preserve in\r\nevery way the well-being of the wage-worker. I am convinced that the\r\nwell-being of our wage-workers demands the exclusion of the Chinese\r\ncoolies, and it is therefore our duty to exclude them, just as it would\r\nbe the duty of China to exclude American laboring men if they became\r\nin any way a menace to China by entering into her country. The right\r\nis reciprocal, and in our last treaty with China it was explicitly\r\nrecognized as inhering in both nations. But we should not only operate\r\nthe law with as little harshness as possible, but we should show every\r\ncourtesy and consideration and every encouragement to all Chinese who\r\nare not of the laboring class to come to this country. Every Chinese\r\ntraveler or student, business man or professional man, should be given\r\nthe same right of entry to, and the same courteous treatment in, this\r\ncountry as are accorded to the student or traveler, the business man\r\nor professional man, of any other nation. Our laws and treaties should\r\nbe so framed as to guarantee to all Chinamen, save of the excepted\r\ncoolie class, the same right of entry to this country and the same\r\ntreatment while here as is guaranteed to citizens of any other nation.\r\nBy executive action I am as rapidly as possible putting a stop to the\r\nabuses which have grown up during many years in the administration\r\nof this law. I can do a good deal, and will do a good deal, even\r\nwithout the action of the Congress; but I can not do all that should\r\nbe done unless such action is taken, and that action I most earnestly\r\nhope will be taken. It is needed in our own interest, and especially\r\nin the interest of the Pacific Slope and of the South Atlantic and\r\nGulf States; for it is short-sighted indeed for us to permit foreign\r\ncompetitors to drive us from the great markets of China. Moreover, the\r\naction I ask is demanded by considerations that are higher than mere\r\ninterest, for I ask it in the name of what is just and right. America\r\nshould take the lead in establishing international relations on the\r\nsame basis of honest and upright dealing which we regard as essential\r\nas between man and man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE LUNCHEON OF THE PIEDMONT CLUB, ATLANTA, GA., OCTOBER 20, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Graves, and My Hosts_:\r\n\r\nSurely it must be almost unnecessary for me to say not alone how I\r\nhave enjoyed to-day, but how deeply touched and moved I have been\r\nat your reception of me, at Georgia’s reception of its descendant.\r\nI told the Governor I had a kind of ancestral reversionary right to\r\nhis chair; because the first revolutionary President of Georgia was\r\nmy great-great-grandfather, Archibald Bulloch, after whom one of my\r\nboys is named. No man could meet with such a reception as you have\r\ngiven me to-day, no man could see your city, could see your people,\r\ncould address such an audience as I have addressed, and not be a\r\nbetter citizen afterward. It means a great deal to me to meet all of\r\nyou personally, with all that you gentlemen typify in the world of\r\npolitics, the world of business, and that world of ethical effort which\r\ncan alone render either business or politics noble.\r\n\r\nNow, I am going to very illy repay the courtesy with which I have been\r\ngreeted, by causing for a minute or two acute discomfort to a man of\r\nwhom I am very fond—Uncle Remus. Presidents may come and Presidents may\r\ngo; but Uncle Remus “stays put.” Georgia has done a great many things\r\nfor the Union; but she has never done more than when she gave Mr. Joel\r\nChandler Harris to American literature. I suppose he is one of those\r\nliterary people who insist that art should have nothing to do with\r\nmorals, and will condemn me as a Philistine for not agreeing with them;\r\nbut I want to say that one of the great reasons why I like what he has\r\nwritten is because after reading it I rise up with the purpose of being\r\na better man, a man who is bound to strive to do what is in him for\r\nthe cause of decency and for the cause of righteousness. Gentlemen,\r\nI feel too strongly to indulge in any language of mere compliment, of\r\nmere flattery. Where Mr. Harris seems to me to have done one of his\r\ngreatest services is that he has written what exalts the South in the\r\nmind of every man who reads it, and yet what has not even a flavor of\r\nbitterness toward any other part of the Union. There is not an American\r\nanywhere who can read Mr. Harris’s stories—I am not speaking at the\r\nmoment of his wonderful folk tales, but of his stories—who does not\r\nrise up a better citizen for having read them, who does not rise up\r\nwith a more earnest desire to do his part in solving American problems\r\naright. I can not too strongly express the obligations I am under to\r\nMr. Harris; and one of those obligations is to feel as a principle that\r\nit is my duty (which if I have transgressed, I have not transgressed\r\nknowingly) never as an American to say anything that could be construed\r\ninto an attack upon any portion of our common country.\r\n\r\nLet me say one word on something entirely different, suggested by our\r\ntalk here to-day. In speaking over with several of the gentlemen round\r\nabout me their experiences in the Georgia Legislature and some of my\r\nexperiences in the New York Legislature, the thing that struck me the\r\nmost was the truth of Abraham Lincoln’s saying that “there is a deal\r\nof human nature in mankind.” The enemies we have to fight, the friends\r\nupon whom we have to rely, are substantially the same, in whatever\r\npart of the Union we live. We have to war against the same evil\r\ntendencies in our own souls; we have to strive to give expression to\r\nthe same aspirations toward righteousness, toward honor. In doing this\r\nthere are two things that are necessary above all others. In the first\r\nplace, the fearless condemnation of what is wrong; the standing up for\r\nwhat is decent, for what is straight; the refusing to palter with the\r\neternal principles of truth; refusing to pardon any man who for any\r\nreason lapses from the law that teaches that the man who is to be of\r\nservice must obey the great rule of truth, of courage, and of honor. In\r\nthe second place, to remember that second only in iniquity, second only\r\nin the injury done to the Republic, to the wrong of the man who acts\r\ncorruptly, comes the wrong of the man who wantonly accuses the honest\r\nman of corruption. Thief is an ugly name, because it denotes an ugly\r\nthing; liar is as ugly a name as thief and as little to be desired by\r\nany right-thinking man; and either to steal or to lie marks the man as\r\nunfit for association with decent men and an enemy of all that is best\r\nand most upright in our political life. Too often we have seen public\r\nsentiment condoning the acts both of the thief and the liar (I am using\r\nugly words, gentlemen, and I am using them because I wish to denote\r\nin the sharpest and in the most ugly fashion ugly attributes), when\r\nthese acts are shifted a little so that they can be hidden under other\r\nnames. The man who in political life, the man who in business life,\r\nby chicanery or by corruption in any shape or form, does or achieves\r\nwhat could not be done or achieved save by or through chicanery or\r\ncorruption, stands on the same level with the man who in court is\r\nconvicted of theft. The man who on no grounds, or on insufficient\r\ngrounds, attacks the honest and upright man, whether in public or\r\nprivate life, as corrupt; who seeks to persuade men to believe that\r\nhe is corrupt; who accuses him of corruption; this man stands on the\r\nsame evil eminence of infamy with the corruptionist himself; and he\r\nis himself the greatest ally of the corruptionist he professes to\r\ndenounce. The Republic will go down, our democratic institutions will\r\nbe a failure, if the moral sense of the people grows so blunted that\r\nthey will accept anything else, whether brilliancy or loyalty of party\r\nservice, or any other deed or quality, as an offset to corruption. The\r\nminute that there arises a question of corruption in public life, if\r\nwe have any sense of loyalty to the Union and its institutions, all\r\npolitical lines vanish at once. We can afford to consider in a public\r\nservant nothing but the question of his honesty or dishonesty when once\r\nthat question is raised.\r\n\r\nThe surest way of blunting the public conscience in dealing with\r\ncorruption is to confuse the public mind as to who is corrupt and who\r\nis not. There are plenty of men with whom we differ radically, plenty\r\nof men of whom we radically disapprove, as to whom it is right and\r\nnecessary that we should express that disapprobation; but beware of\r\nexpressing it in terms that imply moral reprobation. When we express\r\nmoral reprobation let us be sure that we know the facts and then that\r\nwe say only exactly what is true. To accuse an honest man of being a\r\nthief is to gladden the heart of every thief in the Nation. In our\r\nlegislative bodies, in our National Congress, if you find that any man\r\nis corrupt, you are not to be excused if you do not hunt him out of\r\npublic life, whether he is of one party or whether he is of another.\r\nBut if you accuse, either specifically or in loose general declamation,\r\nall men of being corruptionists, you by just so much weaken your own\r\nstrength when it becomes necessary to assail the genuine corruptionist.\r\nSo far from asking that you be lenient in your judgment of any public\r\nman, I hold that you are recreant to duty if you are thus lenient. Do\r\nnot be lenient, but do be just. If you dislike a man’s policy, say so.\r\nIf you think he is acting in a way so misguided that he will bring ruin\r\nto the State or Nation, say so. But do not accuse him of corruption\r\nunless you know that he is corrupt; and if you know that he is corrupt,\r\nif you have good reason to believe that he is corrupt, then refuse\r\nunder any plea of party expediency, under any consideration, to refrain\r\nfrom smiting him with the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT JACKSONVILLE, FLA., OCTOBER 21, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nHere in Florida, the first of the Gulf States which I have visited upon\r\nthis trip, I wish to say a special word about the Panama Canal. I\r\nbelieve that the canal will be of great benefit to all of our people,\r\nbut most of all to the States of the South Atlantic, the Gulf and the\r\nPacific Slope. When completed the canal will stand as a monument to\r\nthis Nation; for it will be the greatest engineering feat ever yet\r\naccomplished in the world. It will be a good thing for the world as a\r\nwhole, and for the people of the Isthmus and of the northern portions\r\nof South America in particular. Because of our especial interest in\r\nit, and because of the position we occupy on this hemisphere, it is a\r\nmatter of especial pride to us that our Nation, the American Nation,\r\nshould have undertaken the performance of this world duty. A body of\r\nthe most eminent engineers in the world, both Americans and foreigners,\r\nhas been summoned to advise as to the exact type of canal which should\r\nbe built. At no distant date I hope to be able to announce what their\r\nadvice is, and also the action taken upon their advice. Meanwhile\r\nthe work is already well under way, and has advanced sufficiently\r\nfar to enable me to announce with certainty that it can surely be\r\naccomplished, and probably at rather less expense than was anticipated.\r\nBut upon the last point, as well as upon the question of time, no\r\npositive statement can be made until the report of the commission of\r\nengineers as to the exact type of canal has been received. The work is\r\nas difficult as it is important; and it is of course inevitable that\r\nfrom time to time difficulties will occur and checks be encountered.\r\nWhenever such is the case the men of little faith at home will lose\r\nthat little faith, and the critics who confound hysteria with emphasis\r\nwill act after their kind. But our people as a whole possess not only\r\nfaith, but resolution, and are of too virile fibre to be swept one\r\nway or the other by mere sensationalism. No check that may come will\r\nbe of more than trivial and passing consequence, will inflict any\r\npermanent damage, or cause any serious delay. The work can be done, is\r\nbeing done, and will be done. What has already been accomplished is a\r\nguaranty as to the future.\r\n\r\nWhen any such work is undertaken there are always many mere adventurers\r\nwho flock to where it is going on, and many men who think they are\r\nadventurers, but who are in reality either weak or timid, follow in\r\ntheir footsteps. Some of the first class will now and then cause\r\ntrouble in one way or another. But every care will be taken to detect\r\nany misdeed on their part and to punish them as soon as the misdeed is\r\ndetected. As for the second class, they will cause trouble chiefly by\r\nlosing heart, returning home, or writing home, and raising a cry that\r\nthey are not happy, and that the conditions of life are not easy, or\r\nthat the work is not being done as they think it ought to be done. Now\r\nthese men stand just as the stragglers and laggards stand who are ever\r\nto be found in the rear of even a victorious army. The veterans of the\r\nCivil War who are here present will tell you that the very rear of an\r\narmy, even when it is victorious, is apt to look and behave as if\r\nthe victory were defeat. And just the same thing is true in any great\r\nenterprise in civil life; there are always weaklings who get trampled\r\ndown or lose heart, and there are always people who listen to their\r\ncomplaints. They amount to nothing one way or the other, so far as\r\nachieving results is concerned; and their complaints and outcries need\r\nnever detain us.\r\n\r\nI call your attention specifically to the matter of health on the\r\nIsthmus. The climate was supposed to be deadly, and yellow fever,\r\nin especial, was supposed to be epidemic. Yet since we have assumed\r\ncontrol there has been far less yellow fever than in our own country.\r\nThe administration is steadily becoming better and more effective,\r\nfrom the hygienic as well as from every other standpoint. The work\r\nof building the canal is a great American work, in which the whole\r\nAmerican people are interested. It has nothing to do with parties\r\nor partisanship, and is being carried on with absolute disregard to\r\nall merely political considerations; with regard only to efficiency,\r\nhonesty, and economy.\r\n\r\nThe digging of the canal will, of course, greatly increase our interest\r\nin the Caribbean Sea. It will be our duty to police the canal, both\r\nin the interest of other nations and in our own interest. To do this\r\nit is, of course, indispensable to have an efficient navy (and I am\r\nhappy to say that we are well on our way toward having one), and also\r\nto possess, as we already possess, certain strategic points to control\r\nthe approach to the canal. In addition it is urgently necessary that\r\nthe insular and continental countries within or bordering upon the\r\nCaribbean Sea should be able to secure fair dealing and orderly liberty\r\nwithin their own borders. I need not say that the United States not\r\nonly has no purpose of aggression upon any republic, continental or\r\ninsular, to the south of us, but has the friendliest feeling toward\r\nthem, and desires nothing save their progress and prosperity. We do not\r\nwish another foot of territory; and I think our conduct toward Cuba\r\nis a guaranty that this is our genuine attitude toward all our sister\r\nrepublics. If ever we should have to interfere in the affairs of any\r\nof our neighbors it would only be when we found it impossible longer\r\nto refrain from doing so without serious damage following; and even in\r\nsuch case it would only be with the sincere and effective purpose to\r\nmake our interference beneficial to the peoples concerned. Of course,\r\noccupying the position we do, occasions may now and then arise when we\r\ncan not refrain from such interference, save under penalty of seeing\r\nsome other strong nation undertake the duty which we neglect; and such\r\nneglect would be unfortunate from more than one standpoint. Wherever\r\npossible we should gladly give any aid we can to a weaker sister\r\nrepublic which is endeavoring to achieve stability and prosperity. It\r\nis an ungenerous thing for us to refuse such aid; and it is foolish not\r\nto give it in a way that will make it really effective, and therefore\r\nof direct benefit to the people concerned—and of indirect benefit to\r\nus, simply because it is a benefit to them. In the last resort, and\r\nonly in the last resort, it may occasionally be necessary to interfere\r\nby exercising what is virtually an international police power, if only\r\nto avoid seeing some European power forced to exercise it. In short,\r\nwhile we must interfere always cautiously, and never wantonly, yet,\r\non rare occasions, where the need is great, it may be necessary to\r\ninterfere, unless we are willing to confess ourselves too feeble for\r\nthe task that we have undertaken, and to avow that we are willing to\r\nsurrender it into stronger hands; and such confession and avowal I know\r\nmy countrymen too well to believe that they will ever make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE FLORIDA BAPTIST COLLEGE, JACKSONVILLE, FLA., OCTOBER 21, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Councilman; Mr. Principal; and you, My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIt is a very great pleasure to be here this afternoon and say a few\r\nwords of greeting to you. Let me by way of beginning say a word of\r\nspecial greeting to my comrades of the Grand Army. I had a colored\r\ncavalry regiment in my brigade at Santiago, and they did well.\r\n\r\nMy friends, let me say what a pleasure it has been in driving along the\r\nstreets to have the Governor and the Mayor point out to me house after\r\nhouse owned by colored citizens, who by their own industry, energy, and\r\nthrift had accumulated a small fortune honestly and were spending it\r\nwisely. Every good American must be interested in seeing every other\r\nAmerican citizen rise, help himself upward, so as to be better able to\r\ndo his duty by himself and those dependent upon him and by the State at\r\nlarge. It seems to me that it is true of all of us that our duties are\r\neven more important than our rights. If we do our duties faithfully in\r\nspite of all difficulties, then sooner or later the rights will take\r\ncare of themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat I say to this body of my colored fellow-citizens is just exactly\r\nwhat I would say to any body of my white fellow-citizens. What we\r\nneed in this country is typified by what I have been shown to-day as\r\nhaving been done by people of your race. We need education, morality,\r\nindustry; we need intelligence, clean living, and the power to work\r\nhard and effectively. No man interested, as every President must be,\r\nin the welfare of all his fellow-Americans, could be otherwise than\r\ndeeply pleased, not only at the evidences of thrift and prosperity\r\namong what must be evidently many hundreds of your number here in this\r\ncity, as shown by the homes that I have seen, but interested also in\r\nseeing an educational institute like this carried on as this institute\r\nevidently is carried on. The costliest crop for any community is the\r\ncrop of ignorance. It is perfectly true that education in mind alone\r\nwon’t make a good citizen; but it is equally true that you can not get\r\nthe best citizen without education. We need to have our people of every\r\nrace educated, as the Principal said in his words of introduction,\r\nin heart, mind, and hand; educated so that head and hand can do their\r\nseveral tasks, and so that there shall be behind head and hand also the\r\nheart, the conscience, the sense of clean and just living, which make\r\nthe foundation of all good citizens. This is just as true for the white\r\nman as for the colored man. It is true of every man.\r\n\r\nI want to say a special word of acknowledgment to the school teachers,\r\nmen and women alike, who are doing the work of education; and in saying\r\nthat word I also want to point out this: it is absolutely essential\r\nthat we should have people do well in the professions; but there is\r\nonly a limited amount of room in the professions and there is almost an\r\nunlimited amount of room in agriculture and in the mechanical trades.\r\nDo your very best to develop good teachers, good doctors, to develop\r\ngood preachers—preachers who shall preach to the colored man as it\r\nshould be preached to the white man, that “by their fruits you shall\r\nknow them,” and that the truly religious man is the man who is decent\r\nand clean in his private life; who is orderly and law-abiding; the\r\nman who hunts down the criminal and does all he can to stop crime and\r\nwrong-doing; the man who treats his neighbor well; who is a good man in\r\nhis own family and therefore a good man in the state. That is what we\r\nhave a right to expect from the Christian leadership of the churches.\r\nAll honor to the teacher, to the doctor, to the preacher; but remember\r\nthat it is impossible that the bulk of any people shall be teachers,\r\nor doctors, or lawyers, or preachers. The bulk have got to be men\r\nengaged in the trades, as mechanics, as wage-workers, as farmers. Every\r\nman who is a good farmer, a thrifty, progressive, saving mechanic, who\r\nowns his own house, who is free from debt, and able to bring up his\r\nchildren well, and to keep his wife as she should be kept, is not only\r\na first-class citizen, but is doing a mighty work in helping to uplift\r\nhis race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT MOBILE, ALA., OCTOBER 23, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mayor; My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI know that the rest of you will not grudge my saying that most of\r\nall I am touched by the sight of the men who wore the gray in the\r\ngreat war, parading here to-day. I have just been presented by Judge\r\nSemmes with this beautiful badge. I passed by the statue of Admiral\r\nSemmes as we drove up hither. Admiral Semmes had under him on the\r\n“Alabama” one of my uncles, and it was another uncle that built the\r\n“Alabama.” The Judge’s sister, the Admiral’s daughter, is the wife of\r\nthat distinguished ex-Confederate who by his rule as Governor of the\r\nPhilippines has held aloft the record of American rule for integrity,\r\nefficiency, and firmness.\r\n\r\nIn speaking before the citizens of this great seaport of the Gulf I\r\nnaturally wish to say a word about the Panama Canal. I hold that as\r\na matter of public policy whatever helps part of our country helps\r\nthe whole; and I did my best to bring about the construction of the\r\ncanal in the interest of all our people; but if there is any one\r\nsection to be most benefited by it, it is the section that includes the\r\nGulf States. Originally I had been for the Nicaragua canal; but when\r\nCongress acted I abode by the decision of Congress. It became evident\r\nthat we should either have no canal or the Panama Canal; and I am for\r\na canal. If we had not acted as we have, all chance of building that\r\ncanal would have vanished for half a century to come; and as it is we\r\nnow are assured of having that canal within a comparatively short time.\r\nGentlemen, I want to warn you not to be misled by interested clamor.\r\nEvery man who had to do with bringing about the construction of the\r\ncanal knows that for decades it was opposed and successfully opposed\r\nby great commercial interests which did not wish to see it completed,\r\nwhich did not wish to see a canal speedily dug through the Isthmus and\r\ncommunication between the Atlantic and Pacific established. It seems to\r\nme evident from certain things I see in a portion of the daily press\r\nthat those enemies are still active, and that they are going to try\r\nto becloud the issue, with the hope of putting off for ten or fifteen\r\nyears or over the digging of that canal. Their weapons will be and are\r\nevery form of misrepresentation. But, gentlemen, they will fail. You\r\nneed not have the slightest alarm. Uncle Sam has started to dig that\r\ncanal and it will be dug, and soon. The people who, largely by the\r\ncirculation of false rumors and by direct misstatement, are seeking\r\nto create confusion such as will defer the building of the canal\r\nwill be disappointed. We have as a people the right to feel genuine\r\nsatisfaction with the progress that has already been made. Let me point\r\nout something of which you here will appreciate the significance: the\r\nsanitation of the Isthmus. Do you remember that a couple of years ago\r\nmen said that you could not dig that canal because yellow fever was\r\nepidemic there? We are digging it, and with a cleaner bill of mortality\r\nthan the Isthmus has ever known before. I am happy to be able to tell\r\nyou that from information received this very day, I find that those who\r\nhave just returned from the Isthmus are not only pleased but astonished\r\nat the excellent trim in which the project is; that it is going on\r\nwell, and that it will go along even better in the future.\r\n\r\nOf all the things said about me to-day in the over-kind allusions to\r\nme, I was especially pleased by what the Colonel said as to my attitude\r\ntoward crooked public servants. I will take advice about appointing\r\nmen; but if I find they are crooked I do not take any advice at all\r\nabout removing them. We have Scriptural authority for saying that\r\n“offences must come”; but the Good Book adds, “woe to them through whom\r\nthey come.” I can not guarantee, and no human being can, that there\r\nwill not be an occasional man of an improper kind appointed, or an\r\noccasional well-meaning man who after being appointed goes wrong; but I\r\ncan say that every effort within the power of the Government will be\r\nmade to hunt such a man out of the public service and to punish him to\r\nthe full extent of the law.\r\n\r\nHere in this seaboard city I want to say another word, and that is\r\nabout the United States Navy. Again, Judge Semmes, in passing by the\r\nmonument of your illustrious father I felt the thrill of pride that\r\nall Americans must feel that the names of the combatants in that\r\nfamous ship duel are commemorated in the names of the “Kearsarge” and\r\n“Alabama” in the United States Navy now, and that if ever they have\r\nto go into action they will go into action side by side, manned by\r\nAmericans, against a common foe. I know that an audience composed as\r\nthis audience is of men who either themselves fought or whose fathers\r\nfought in the Civil War, appreciate to the full the sound national\r\npolicy (if I may use the vernacular) of never bluffing unless you\r\nmean to make good. We undertook to build the Panama Canal because we\r\nsaid that owing to our position and interest and standing we were the\r\nonly nation that could or should do it. That means that we have got\r\nto protect it and police it ourselves. We do not ask anybody else to\r\nhelp us do the work we have allotted to ourselves. We must therefore\r\nbring up and keep up our navy to the highest point of efficiency. We\r\ncan afford to have a small army; although we must insist upon its being\r\nkept up to the high point of efficiency that I am glad to say our\r\nregular army in its individual units has now attained. In the event of\r\nwar, however, which I hope will never come, the American people in\r\nthe future as in the past must on land rely mainly upon its volunteer\r\nsoldiery. But while it is a comparatively simple task to turn a man of\r\nthe proper character, physique and intelligence into a good soldier,\r\nyou can not improvise either a battleship or the crew of a battleship.\r\nAt sea the battle has to be fought with the ships and the crews that\r\nhave been prepared before the war begins; and we wish to profit by the\r\nlessons of history by seeing that our navy is always kept adequate\r\nto our needs. It is not necessary to have a very large navy; but it\r\nis necessary that ship for ship it should be just a little the most\r\nefficient navy in the world. In battle the shots that count are the\r\nshots that hit. There are plenty of gallant fellows who will go down\r\nwith their ships. That is all right; if there is nothing else to be\r\ndone, go down with the ships rather than surrender. But try to make the\r\nother fellow’s ship go down first! I want our people to feel that in\r\nassuming to dig the Isthmian canal, in assuming the position we have\r\nassumed as regards this Western Hemisphere and in the Oriental seas,\r\nwe bind ourselves to keep our navy at such a point of efficiency that\r\nthere shall be no chance of humiliation at the hands of any foreign foe.\r\n\r\nI appreciate immensely this mighty outpouring of people. The Mayor\r\nin his most gratifying and touching speech spoke of the fact of\r\nour agreement on the fundamental questions, without regard to our\r\ndifferences on what are really matters only of political detail. The\r\nthings that count are the things upon which we are all agreed and must\r\nbe all agreed in our civic life. Whether President, Governor, Mayor,\r\nCongressman, or State Legislator, there are certain basic principles to\r\nwhich we must prove true if we are to make this country what it shall\r\nbe made. We can perfectly well afford to differ about the currency or\r\nthe tariff; but we can not afford to differ about such questions as\r\nhonesty in public life, decency and cleanliness in private life. Those\r\nqualities and others like them go to the root of the whole question of\r\ncitizenship. I believe in the future of this country; I believe that\r\nthis great self-governing Republic will rise to a height never even\r\ndreamed of by any other nation, because I believe that the average\r\nAmerican citizen, North or South, East or West, has the right stuff\r\nin him; that the average American citizen has the three fundamental\r\nvirtues of honesty, courage, and common-sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE ALABAMA CONFERENCE FEMALE COLLEGE, TUSKEGEE, ALA.,\r\n  OCTOBER 24, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mayor; and you, My Friends and Fellow Americans_:\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a peculiar pleasure to be here this morning and be greeted\r\nas you have greeted me. Mr. Mayor, I feel that those gathered here to\r\ngreet me symbolize what we most like to think of as typically American\r\nin our national life. When you brought me here, Mr. Mayor, I was met\r\non the platform by the pastors of the Methodist and Baptist churches\r\nin the shade of an institution of the higher learning, in the presence\r\nof these students and of the children of the public schools; while\r\nat the same time I see the industries of the nation typified both\r\nby cotton being picked as I came up and also by the fact that I am\r\nspeaking on the most valuable platform I have ever spoken on (cotton\r\nbales); and finally, I have as a guard of honor members of the National\r\nGuard, whom, as I look at, I feel to be my own comrades, for they\r\nare just the type I had in my own regiment in the Spanish war. These\r\nelements, as I say, typify what we hope and believe are the elements\r\nrepresenting what is most vital in American life: the deep religious\r\nfeeling of our people, the understanding of our people that material\r\nprosperity amounts to nothing if behind it and under it there is not\r\nthe spiritual sense, the sense of moral obligation, the fealty to an\r\nideal; the realization that in addition we must have, as the foundation\r\nof national prosperity, industry, energy, and thrift, and their fruits.\r\nThere must be devotion to the arts and practices of peace, devotion\r\nto civic duty, and yet the readiness of the man who does his duty in\r\ncivil life to do it in military life if ever the need arises; and\r\nfinally the recognition of the fact that though a great many crops are\r\nimportant, the most important crop is the crop of children; and the one\r\nthing that this Nation can not afford to neglect is the education of\r\nthe nation of the future. The Nation of the future will rise higher or\r\nnot just as the boys and girls of the present are or are not trained\r\nto do their duty as men and as women. So I take a particular pleasure\r\nin being here and greeting the children of the public schools and\r\nthose past childhood who are studying in this college itself. The one\r\nall-essential thing in America, the thing that underlies everything\r\nelse, is to have the average American a good man or a good woman. If\r\nthere is any one thing that I respect more than a good man it is a good\r\nwoman. I think she is just a trifle more useful, and she has a harder\r\ntime in life; and so she is a little more entitled to our respect\r\nthan even the best man; and there is not a man here who is worth his\r\nsalt who does not agree with me. Of course it is a mere truism to say\r\nthat the ultimate factor in determining the welfare of the nation is\r\nthe life of the home; that is, the way in which the ordinary man,\r\nthe ordinary woman, performs his or her ordinary duties of the most\r\nsacred and intimate kind. If the man is a good father, a good husband;\r\nif he is decent and clean in his domestic life; if he does his duty\r\nby his neighbor; if he is the kind of a man whom we are glad to have\r\nas a neighbor and to do business with, that man is a good citizen.\r\nIt is just the same with the woman. If the woman is a good wife and\r\nmother, she is a good citizen; and not merely a good citizen, but she\r\nis the very best kind of citizen that this country can produce. What\r\nwe need is not merely desire to perform heroic feats under altogether\r\nexceptional circumstances; but the steadfast determination to perform\r\nthe rather commonplace duties of every day, day by day, as they arise.\r\nSpeaking broadly, the man who does that is the man whom you can trust\r\nif the need for heroism arises. Each of you boys here should remember\r\nthat the way to fit yourself to be of the utmost possible use is so\r\nto act that your family likes to have you at home, instead of feeling\r\na relief when you are gone; and it is the same way with the girl. We\r\nall of us know an occasional foolish mother who says, “I have had to\r\nwork hard; I have had a pretty hard time, my daughter shall not have\r\nto work.” That is not kindness to the daughter. It is doing the very\r\nworst thing that can be done for her. Do not bring up your boys and\r\ngirls to be useless, to avoid trouble, to get around trouble, to shirk\r\nwork. The man or the woman who counts in life is the man or the woman,\r\nnot who flinches from a task, but who does the task, who overcomes the\r\nobstacle. The boy or girl won’t turn out that kind of a man or woman if\r\nnot brought up in that spirit from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT TUSKEGEE INSTITUTE, TUSKEGEE, ALA., OCTOBER 24, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Washington; Friends, and Pupils of Tuskegee Institute_:\r\n\r\nTo the white population as well as to the black, it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that the negro be encouraged to make himself a citizen\r\nof the highest type of usefulness. It is to the interest of the\r\nwhite people that this policy be conscientiously pursued, and to the\r\ninterest of the colored people that they clearly realize that they\r\nhave opportunities for economic development here in the South not\r\nnow offered elsewhere. Within the last twenty years the industrial\r\noperations of the South have increased so tremendously that there is a\r\nscarcity of labor almost everywhere; so that it is the part of wisdom\r\nfor all who wish the prosperity of the South to help the negro to\r\nbecome in the highest degree useful to himself, and therefore to the\r\ncommunity in which he lives. The South has always depended, and now\r\ndepends, chiefly upon her native population for her work. Therefore\r\nin view of the scarcity not only of common labor, but of skilled\r\nlabor, it becomes doubly important to train every available man to\r\nbe of the utmost use, by developing his intelligence, his skill, and\r\nhis capacity for conscientious effort. Hence the work of the Tuskegee\r\nNormal and Industrial Institute is a matter of the highest practical\r\nimportance to both the white man and the black man, and well worth\r\nthe support of both races alike in the South and in the North. Your\r\nfifteen hundred students are not only being educated in head and heart,\r\nbut also trained to industrial efficiency, for from the beginning\r\nTuskegee has placed especial emphasis upon the training of men and\r\nwomen in agriculture, mechanics, and household duties, Training in\r\nthese three fundamental directions does not embrace all that the negro,\r\nor any other race, needs, but it does cover in a very large degree\r\nthe field in which the negro can at present do most for himself and\r\nbe most helpful to his white neighbors. Every black man who leaves\r\nthis institute better able to do mechanical or industrial work adds\r\nby so much to the wealth of the whole community and benefits all\r\npeople in the community. The professional and mercantile avenues to\r\nsuccess are overcrowded; for the present the best chance of success\r\nawaits the intelligent worker at some mechanical trade or on a farm;\r\nfor this man will almost certainly achieve industrial independence. I\r\nam pleased, but not in the least surprised, to learn that many among\r\nthe men and women trained at Tuskegee find immediate employment as\r\nleaders and workers among their own people, and that their services\r\nare eagerly sought by white people for various kinds of industrial\r\nwork, the demand being much greater than the supply. Viewed from any\r\nangle, ignorance is the costliest crop that can be raised in any part\r\nof this Union. Every dollar put into the education of either white man\r\nor black man, in head, in hand, and in heart, yields rich dividends to\r\nthe entire community. Merely from the economic standpoint it is of the\r\nutmost consequence to all our citizens that institutions such as this\r\nat Tuskegee should be a success. But there are other and even higher\r\nreasons that entitle it to our support. In the interest of humanity, of\r\njustice, and of self-protection, every white man in America, no matter\r\nwhere he lives, should try to help the negro to help himself. It is in\r\nthe interest and for the protection of the white man to see that the\r\nnegro is educated. It is not only the duty of the white man, but it is\r\nto his interest, to see that the negro is protected in property, in\r\nlife, and in all his legal rights. Every time a law is broken, every\r\nindividual in the community has the moral tone of his life lowered.\r\nLawlessness in the United States is not confined to any one section;\r\nlynching is not confined to any one section; and there is perhaps no\r\nbody of American citizens who have deserved so well of the entire\r\nAmerican people as the public men, the publicists, the clergymen,\r\nthe countless thousands of high-minded private citizens, who have\r\ndone such heroic work in the South in arousing public opinion against\r\nlawlessness in all its forms, and especially against lynching. I very\r\nearnestly hope that their example will count in the North as well as\r\nin the South, for there are just as great evils to be warred against\r\nin one region of our country as in another, though they are not in all\r\nplaces the same evils. And when any body of men in any community stands\r\nbravely for what is right, these men not merely serve a useful purpose\r\nin doing the particular task to which they set themselves, but give a\r\nlift to the cause of good citizenship throughout the Union. I heartily\r\nappreciate what you have done at Tuskegee; and I am sure you will not\r\ngrudge my saying that it could not possibly have been done save for the\r\nloyal support you have received from the white people round about; for\r\nduring the twenty-five years of effort to educate the black man here\r\nin the midst of a white community of intelligence and culture, there\r\nhas never been an outbreak between the races, or any difficulty of any\r\nkind. All honor is due to the white men of Alabama, to the white men\r\nof Tuskegee, for what they have done. And right here let me say that\r\nif in any community a misunderstanding between the races arises, over\r\nany matter, infinitely the best way out is to have a prompt, frank\r\nand full conference and consultation between representatives of the\r\nwise, decent, cool-headed men among the whites and the wise, decent,\r\ncool-headed colored men. Such a conference will always tend to bring\r\nabout a better understanding, and will be a great help all round.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have spoken chiefly of the obligations existing on the part\r\nof the white man. Now let you remember on the other hand that no help\r\ncan permanently avail you save as you yourselves develop capacity for\r\nself-help. You young colored men and women educated at Tuskegee must\r\nby precept and example lead your fellows toward sober, industrious,\r\nlaw-abiding lives. You are in honor bound to join hands in favor of\r\nlaw and order and to war against all crime, and especially against\r\nall crime by men of your own race; for the heaviest wrong done by the\r\ncriminal is the wrong to his own race. You must teach the people of\r\nyour race that they must scrupulously observe any contract into which\r\nthey in good faith enter, no matter whether it is hard to keep or not.\r\nIf you save money, secure homes, become taxpayers, and lead clean,\r\ndecent, modest lives, you will win the respect of your neighbors of\r\nboth races. Let each man strive to excel his fellows only by rendering\r\nsubstantial service to the community in which he lives. The colored\r\npeople have many difficulties to pass through, but these difficulties\r\nwill be surmounted if only the policy of reason and common-sense is\r\npursued. You have made real and great progress. According to the census\r\nthe colored people of this country own and pay taxes upon something\r\nlike three hundred million dollars’ worth of property, and have blotted\r\nout over fifty per cent of their illiteracy. What you have done in the\r\npast is an indication of what you will be able to accomplish in the\r\nfuture under wise leadership. Moral and industrial education is what is\r\nmost needed, in order that this progress may continue. The race can not\r\nexpect to get everything at once. It must learn to wait and bide its\r\ntime; to prove itself worthy by showing its possession of perseverance,\r\nof thrift, of self-control. The destiny of the race is chiefly in its\r\nown hands, and must be worked out patiently and persistently along\r\nthese lines. Remember also that the white man who can be of most use\r\nto the colored man is that colored man’s neighbor. It is the Southern\r\npeople themselves who must and can solve the difficulties that exist\r\nin the South; of course what help the people of the rest of the Union\r\ncan give them must and will be gladly and cheerfully given. The hope\r\nof advancement for the colored man in the South lies in his steady,\r\ncommon-sense effort to improve his moral and material condition, and\r\nto work in harmony with the white man in upbuilding the Commonwealth.\r\nThe future of the South now depends upon the people of both races\r\nliving up to the spirit and letter of the laws of their several States\r\nand working out the destinies of both races, not as races, but as\r\nlaw-abiding American citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CAPITOL BUILDING, MONTGOMERY, ALA., OCTOBER 24, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governor; Colonel Wiley; My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nMy friends and fellow-citizens, think what a privilege ours is; think\r\nwhat it means for this nation; that there is no place in this Union\r\nwhere the President of the Union can feel more at home, can feel more\r\nthat he is indeed the President of all the Union, of a reunited and\r\nindissoluble Union, than here under the shadow of the first capitol of\r\nthe Confederacy. Poor indeed would be the soul of the man who did not\r\nleave Montgomery a better American than he came into it, after being\r\nreceived as I have been received to-day.\r\n\r\nIn speaking to all of you I know that the younger—those of my own age\r\nand younger still—will not grudge my saying a special word of greeting\r\nto the veterans of the great war. Here again think how fortunate we\r\nare. There is no other people of which history tells, which, having\r\npassed through such a war as we passed through, after forty years finds\r\nnot only that the flag which had been rent in sunder is once again\r\nwhole without a seam; finds all the people challenging as theirs the\r\nright to claim their part in the heritage of glory bequeathed to every\r\nAmerican, alike by the Americans who wore the blue and the Americans\r\nwho wore the gray in the great Civil War. In coming to your mighty\r\nand beautiful State, with its wealth of agriculture, its wealth of\r\nmanufactures, I am more than ever impressed by the solidarity of our\r\ninterests as a people. As the Governor pointed out, the greatest and\r\nmost important single export of our people is the export of cotton; and\r\nthe whole nation is concerned in the welfare of the cotton growers.\r\nIt is not only important for Alabama and the rest of the Gulf States;\r\nit is important for the entire Union, because it is the cotton crop\r\nwhich determines the balance of trade as being in favor of this Nation.\r\nThe business of any part of this Nation is the business of the entire\r\nNation; and the National Government is bound to do everything it can\r\nin the interest of the cotton growers; to preserve your markets; to do\r\neverything that can possibly be done to see that the natural demand for\r\ncotton abroad is kept up and is met here under fair conditions by our\r\nown people. Perhaps no State in the Union is more interested than this\r\nin the performance of what is to be the greatest engineering feat the\r\nworld has yet seen—the building of the Isthmian canal. The cotton crop\r\nlargely goes to Asia. The canal will of course immensely shorten the\r\nwater route to Asia. Our influence in the Orient must be kept at such\r\na pitch as will ensure our being able to guarantee fair treatment to\r\nour merchants and manufacturers by China. We must insist upon having\r\nfair treatment; and as a step toward getting it we must give fair\r\ntreatment in return. I would demand that on ethical grounds alone; I\r\nwould demand it also on grounds of self-interest.\r\n\r\nNow I want to say a word about the children. Nothing pleases me more\r\nthan to see the care you are devoting to education in this State; and\r\namong the many splendidly heroic deeds credited to the Southern people\r\nin peace as well as in war is the fact of having to face, as they\r\ndid, the future in the midst of a broken and war-swept country, they\r\nnot only built up their industrial prosperity, but they have provided\r\nsteadily for the education of the coming generation.\r\n\r\nThe successful performance of political duty depends absolutely upon\r\nthe successful performance of domestic, of social, duty. There never\r\ncan be, there never will be a good government in which the average\r\ncitizen is not a decent man in private life. It is a contradiction in\r\nterms to speak of a good government if the good government does not\r\nrest upon cleanliness and decency in the home, respect of husband and\r\nwife for one another, tenderness of the man for those dependent upon\r\nhim, performance of duty by woman and by man, and the proper education\r\nof the children who are to make the next generation. The vital things\r\nin life are the things that foolish people look upon as commonplace.\r\nThe vital deeds of life are those things which it lies within the\r\nreach of each of us to do, and the failure to perform which means the\r\ndestruction of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT BIRMINGHAM, ALA., OCTOBER 24, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Rhodes; and you, My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI wish to say that I am stirred most deeply by this magnificent\r\nreception from what Mr. Rhodes has so well called the Magic City of\r\nthe South. Alabama has made a wonderful record. At the close of the\r\nwar, shattered, war-swept, it seemed that it was impossible for her\r\npeople, in the grip of poverty as they were, to rally; and any people\r\nless strong than you of Alabama would have failed; but you had the\r\nstuff in you and you succeeded. About the year 1880 the tide turned,\r\nand the last quarter of a century has seen in Alabama a progress that\r\nwould have been absolutely impossible in any other age or in any other\r\nnation than ours. The agriculture of the State went upward by leaps\r\nand bounds; but even more marvelous was your mechanical and industrial\r\nsuccess. You have in this State coal and iron, the two basic elements\r\nin modern industrialism, and you have also a wealth of water power only\r\npartially used; and given that amount of natural resources and the\r\nright type of man to use them, the result will be what we have seen.\r\nBut there is something that is ahead of any kind of natural resources,\r\nand that is the citizenship of the man on the soil. Proud though I am\r\nof your extraordinary industrial prosperity, I am prouder yet of the\r\nmen who have achieved it.\r\n\r\nThink what it means for our nation to have the President of the United\r\nStates greeted as he has been to-day, with on his right and his left\r\nhand as the guard of honor the veterans of the Civil War, the men who\r\nwore the blue, the men who wore the gray, united forever.\r\n\r\nAs I came up the street nothing pleased me as much as the sight of the\r\nschool-children drawn up alongside the line of march. Remember that we\r\nshall leave this country in the hands of the children of to-day, and\r\nthat the American of to-morrow will be what we train the boy or girl\r\nto be. If the children are not well educated, if they are not brought\r\nup as they should be, the State will go down. We of this generation\r\nhave received a splendid heritage from you men of the years of ’60 to\r\n’65. Honor to us if we treat your great deeds as spurring us onward;\r\nand shame to us if we treat your great deeds as excuses for our own\r\nidleness or folly. When I speak of education I do not mean only\r\neducation in intelligence. That counts tremendously; but education in\r\ncharacter counts more. It is character that determines the Nation’s\r\nprogress in the long run.\r\n\r\nIn the organizations of veterans after the Civil War each hails\r\nthe other as comrade. It makes no difference whether the man was a\r\nlieutenant-general or whether he was the youngest recruit that served\r\nat the very end of the war. All that is asked is, did he do his duty in\r\nthe place in which he was. If he did, you are for him. If he did not,\r\nyou have no comradeship with him. I ask that the same lesson that you\r\nof the Civil War applied practically in your own persons during and\r\nsince that war be applied by the rest of us in civil life. I ask that\r\nwe scorn alike the base arrogance of the rich man who would look down\r\non his poorer brother and the equally base envy of the poor man who\r\nwould hate his richer brother; and that you apply to every citizen of\r\nthis Republic just this one test—the test that gauges his worth as a\r\nman. Does he do his duty fairly by himself, his family, his neighbor,\r\nand the State and the Nation? If he does, be for him, whether he is\r\nrich or poor, because if you do not you are recreant in the spirit of\r\nAmericanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON BEING PRESENTED WITH TWO CONFEDERATE BADGES, AT\r\n  BIRMINGHAM, ALA., OCTOBER 24, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladies; General_:\r\n\r\nI accept the two badges in the spirit in which they are offered; for\r\nyour spirit here is that we are now indeed and forever reunited under\r\nthe flag of the indissoluble Union; and that henceforth the only\r\nrivalry between the man whose father fought in the Union army and the\r\nman whose father fought in the Confederate army will be the generous\r\nrivalry of seeing who can do most for our common country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT CITY PARK, LITTLE ROCK, ARK., OCTOBER 25, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governor; Judge Trieber, and you, My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI am fortunate enough to have spoken all over the Union, and I have\r\nnever said in any State or any section what I would not have said\r\nin any other State or in any other section. I am fortunate in being\r\nPresident of a nation where you do not have to praise one State by\r\nrunning down any other State. Arkansas, the New England States, the\r\nWestern, the Eastern, the Northern, the Southern—they are all good\r\nStates and I am for them all. The thing that has impressed me most as\r\nI have gone through this country from the Atlantic to the Pacific,\r\nfrom the Canadian border to the Gulf, has been not the superficial\r\ndifferences of our people, but the essential likenesses of our\r\npeople. The average American is a pretty good fellow; and all that is\r\nnecessary, as you men of the honor guard, you men of the blue and gray\r\nknow, is that he should know the other average American and they will\r\nget on all right. That is true as regards locality and locality, and\r\ntrue as regards occupation and occupation. Thank heaven, we are free\r\nnow from all danger of sectional antagonism! We must now see that there\r\nnever comes any spirit of class antagonism in this country, any spirit\r\nof hostility between capitalist and wage-worker, between employer\r\nand employed; and we can avoid the upgrowth of any such feeling by\r\nremembering always to treat each man on his worth as a man. Do not hold\r\nit for him or against him that he is either rich or poor. If he is a\r\ncrooked man and rich, hold it against him, not because he is rich, but\r\nbecause he is crooked. If he is not a rich man and crooked, hold it\r\nagainst him, still because he is crooked. If he is a square man, no\r\nmatter how much or how little money he has, stand by him because he is\r\na square man. Distrust more than any other man in this Republic the man\r\nwho would try to teach Americans to substitute loyalty to any class for\r\nloyalty to the whole American people. Republics have flourished before\r\nnow, and have fallen; and they have usually fallen because there arose\r\nwithin them parties that represented either the unscrupulous rich or\r\nthe unscrupulous poor, and that persuaded the majority of the people\r\nto substitute loyalty to the one class for loyalty to the people as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nRemember that the rancorous envy that hates the rich is only one side\r\nof the shield whose obverse is the insolence and arrogance that looks\r\ndown on the poor. The two qualities are fundamentally the same. They\r\nonly differ in their manifestations because it happens that the man\r\nshowing one is in a different position from the man showing the other.\r\nYou show me a rich man who is arrogant and insolent in his disregard\r\nof the man of less means, and I tell you that same man, if he loses\r\nhis wealth, will want to plunder every rich man. In the same way the\r\nman who preaches the gospel of hate and envy toward his fellows who\r\nare better off, if he becomes better off will oppress the men whom he\r\nonce championed. Distrust the man who would persuade you that he would\r\ndo you good by trying to do any other man harm. The man who is true to\r\nyou will ultimately be the man who is true to the great fundamental\r\nprinciples of righteousness. In public life the man who seeks to\r\npersuade you that he will benefit you by wronging any one else, if the\r\nchance arises, will surely try to benefit himself by wronging you. What\r\nas a nation we need is to stand by the eternal, immutable principles\r\nof right and decency, the principle of fair dealing as between man and\r\nman, the principles that teach us to regard virtue with respect and\r\nvice with abhorrence wherever either the virtue or the vice may be\r\nfound. If we substitute for the line that divides the decent man from\r\nthe man who is not decent, the line dividing the rich man from the poor\r\nman, or the line making any other artificial division, we will have\r\ndone irreparable wrong to the Nation itself.\r\n\r\nGovernor, you spoke of a hideous crime that is often hideously avenged.\r\nThe worst enemy of the negro race is the negro criminal, and, above\r\nall, the negro criminal of that type; for he has committed not only\r\nan unspeakably dreadful and infamous crime against the victim, but he\r\nhas committed a hideous crime against the people of his own color; and\r\nevery reputable colored man, every colored man who wishes to see to the\r\nuplifting of his race, owes it as his first duty to himself and to\r\nthat race to hunt down that criminal with all his soul and strength.\r\nNow for the side of the white man. To avenge one hideous crime by\r\nanother hideous crime is to reduce the man doing it to the bestial\r\nlevel of the wretch who committed the bestial crime. The horrible\r\neffects of lynch law are shown in the fact that three-fourths of the\r\nlynchings are not for that crime at all, but for other crimes. And\r\nabove all other men, Governor, you and I and all who are exponents and\r\nrepresentatives of the law, owe it to our people, owe it to the cause\r\nof civilization and humanity, to do everything in our power, officially\r\nand unofficially, directly and indirectly, to free the United States\r\nfrom the menace and reproach of lynch law.\r\n\r\nWe can afford to be divided on questions of mere partisanship; they\r\ndo not make any real difference compared to other questions. The\r\nquestions of currency or the tariff are of no consequence compared to\r\nthe fundamental questions, the questions upon which all good Americans\r\nshould be one—the questions of decency in the life of the home and of\r\nhonesty in public life. It makes very little difference in the long run\r\nwhether it is a Democrat or a Republican who is President, compared\r\nto the importance of honesty and broad patriotism; it makes all the\r\ndifference in the world that we shall have all our public officials\r\nhonest, clean men, earnest to serve their countrymen wherever they may\r\nlive. The candidate is the candidate of a party; but if the President\r\nis worth his salt he is the President of the whole people. Remember,\r\nthe stream does not rise any higher than its source. You can not have\r\ngood public life unless you have as a basis good private life. The\r\ncountry is going to be all right if the average man is decent and clean\r\nin his home life; if he is a good husband, a good father, a good son;\r\nif he does his duty by his neighbor; if he is the kind of a man you are\r\nglad to have as a neighbor and glad to do business with. If that man is\r\nthe average American, America is going to continue to be all right; and\r\nif the average goes below that you can not make the country right.\r\n\r\nI have great respect for a good man. There is only one person I respect\r\nmore, and that is a good woman; and if there is any man here who\r\ndoes not agree with me I do not think much of him. The foundation of\r\nour happiness and well-being lies in the preservation of the typical\r\nAmerican home, the kind of home in which you veterans of the Civil War\r\nwere raised, so that when you went to battle, on whichever side you\r\nfought, you had the memory of what your fathers and mothers had taught\r\nyou to rest upon and to live up to. We of the younger generation—my\r\ncomrades of the National Guard here and all of our time—inherited from\r\nthese older men of the heroic days, these men of the great Civil War,\r\nthis splendid country of ours; we inherited our position in the world.\r\nLet us see to it that we leave to our children unimpaired and improved\r\nthe heritage we received from our fathers. Shame to us if we treat\r\nthe great deeds of the men of the past as excuses for laziness, or\r\nidleness, or shirking of duty on our part. Let us treat these great\r\ndeeds as an incentive, as a spur; let us feel that we should hang our\r\nheads if we do not prove ourselves worthy representatives of the men\r\nwho are before us—you men of the South here, whose heroism and valor\r\nfor four years of war have been wellnigh surpassed by the heroism and\r\nvalor you have displayed in the forty years of peace following it. Let\r\nus go on with the work of the material upbuilding of this country;\r\nand at the same time remember that, vital though it is to have a good\r\nfoundation of material well-being, yet it is only the foundation and\r\nupon it must be built the superstructure of the moral and spiritual\r\nhigher life of the Nation. We all honor you men of the Civil War here,\r\nyou men of the blue and men of the gray. We honor you because when the\r\ncall to arms came you treated material considerations as dross to be\r\ncast aside, not to be for one moment weighed in the balance, compared\r\nto the proud privilege of laying down everything, life itself, on the\r\naltar of your duty as light was given you to see your duty. Let us have\r\nthat same spirit deep in our heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE LUNCHEON AT LITTLE ROCK, ARK., OCTOBER 25, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Toastmaster; Judge Rose; My Hosts_:\r\n\r\nLet me at the outset say a word of thanks to the Arkansas Consistory\r\nfor its generous hospitality, and say how much I appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI want to say just one word suggested by the fact that Judge Rose was\r\nPresident of the American Bar Association and stands to-day as one of\r\nthat group of eminent American citizens, eminent for their services to\r\nthe whole country, whom we know as the leaders of the American bar.\r\nI want to speak as a layman about certain services that the learned\r\nprofession, of which Judge Rose is so eminent a member, can render to\r\nan even greater degree than they now render to the American people. I\r\nknow that there is a good deal of distrust, rightly, for the layman\r\nwho speaks of law or of theology. But I am going to say just a few\r\nwords on a matter that concerns good citizenship, in which the layman\r\nhas a right to expect leadership both from lawyer and from theologian.\r\nVery naturally in any profession there come to be men who treat the\r\nprofession as an end instead of as a means (I am not now speaking\r\nfrom the standpoint of the individual, but from the standpoint of\r\nthe Nation, of the State). Just as we have a right to judge the man\r\nof religious profession by the output that comes as a result of that\r\nprofession, so we have a right to expect from the great profession of\r\nthe law, from that which is perhaps the leading among the liberal lay\r\nprofessions, a peculiar quantity and quality of service to the public.\r\nThere are certain abuses in connection with our whole system of law\r\nto-day which the laymen can not remedy, but which I earnestly hope that\r\nthe men of the law will themselves remedy. I speak merely to my fellow\r\nlaymen and invite correction. I am speaking before Gamaliel, and\r\nshall expect correction from Gamaliel if I go wrong. But our law comes\r\ndown from the time when the state, the government, was all-powerful as\r\ncompared to the individual; when the government acted as a plaintiff\r\nand it was necessary that every possible safeguard should be thrown\r\naround the defendant, that he should be given every chance, and the\r\nfear of injustice was a synonym for fear of injustice to the private\r\ncitizen against whom the state proceeded. It comes from a time, if\r\nmy memory of history is right, when about five per cent of any given\r\nnumber of children born in England were punished by hanging, when\r\npeople were hanged for the most trivial offences, and when all the\r\nmachinery of the law was in the hands of the government and directed\r\nagainst the individual; so that the one thing that had to be done was\r\nto protect the individual. Circumstances in the past three or four\r\ncenturies have wholly changed; but the law has not changed nearly as\r\nrapidly or completely. At present there is not the slightest question\r\nas to the individual’s rights being preserved. They are amply guarded.\r\nOf course there is the possibility of error in every human affair; but\r\nspeaking generally, the man accused of criminal wrong, especially the\r\nman accused of criminal wrong against the public, has every possible\r\nchance secured him; but the public has by no means the chance it ought\r\nto have. No greater service is being rendered the American public\r\nto-day than by those members of the legal profession whose great\r\ngood fortune it has been to stand forth as prominently identified\r\nwith the prosecution of crimes against the state. When I say crimes\r\nagainst the state I not only refer to crimes like those of bribery\r\nand corruption committed by any public official, but I mean such a\r\ncrime as murder, as any similar hideous misdeed, where the offence is\r\nnot merely against the individual, but against the entire community.\r\nIt is right to remember the interests of the individual, but it is\r\nright also to remember the interests of that great mass of individuals\r\nembodied in the public, in the government. It is unfortunate that\r\nwe have permitted practices that were necessary three hundred years\r\nago for the protection of innocent people to be elaborated, to be\r\nperverted, so that they become a means for allowing criminals to\r\nescape the punishment of their criminality. We urgently need in this\r\ncountry methods for expediting punishment, methods for doing away with\r\ndelay, methods which will secure to the public an even chance with the\r\ncriminal. I do not ask any more; if we can get an average of just fifty\r\nper cent of the criminals we will be pretty nearly all right; for that\r\nwill give the public an even chance with the criminal whose offence\r\nis against the public. At present the right of appeal is in certain\r\ncases so abused as to make it a matter of the utmost difficulty to\r\nultimately punish a man sufficiently rich or sufficiently influential\r\nto command really good legal talent. I am speaking of what I know,\r\nfor I am speaking with very keenly in my mind experiences during the\r\npast three years in trying to get at certain public offenders who\r\nhave been indicted, and some of whom it has been almost impossible to\r\nget into the jurisdiction of the courts in Washington in order to try\r\nthem. There are others whose cases are still on appeal who profit by\r\ninterminable delays. I feel that the man who offends against the state\r\noccupies a position rather worse than that of any other criminal, from\r\nthe very fact that he is a man who attacks everybody instead of just\r\none person, so that it is not the special business of any one to get\r\nat him. In consequence, if he can keep the forces of justice at bay\r\nlong enough—if he can secure one or two mistrials—gradually the popular\r\ninterest evaporates and the criminal gets off.\r\n\r\nAs the Judge has so well said, the minute a man becomes President\r\nhe ceases being the President of a party and is the President of\r\nevery man, woman, and child within the confines of the Nation. But I\r\npermit myself one particular bit of party discrimination. I am just\r\na trifle more intent on punishing the Republican offender than the\r\nDemocrat; because he is my own scoundrel, and I feel a certain sense of\r\nresponsibility for him, and I intend to discharge that responsibility\r\nif I can. Of course, as we all know, offences must come; but I have\r\nendeavored to carry out the Scriptural injunction and to make it a\r\nmatter of woe unto him by whom they come. I am happy to say that we\r\nhave a reasonable proportion of the offenders in question with stripes\r\non; but not up to the fifty per cent average that I would like; and I\r\nwant to go a little further than we have yet gone.\r\n\r\nIf the law is reasonably speedy and reasonably sure it takes away one\r\ngreat excuse for lawlessness. If some horrible crime is committed\r\nand the people feel that under the best circumstances there will be\r\nan indefinite delay in the punishment of the criminal, and that the\r\npunishment will be uncertain even when the time for administering it\r\ncomes, then a premium is put upon that kind of law-breaking which\r\nmore than any other is a menace to the law. Long delays of justice,\r\nabuses of the pardoning power, the sluggishness with which either court\r\nor attorney moves; all of those things count in bringing about the\r\ncondition of affairs which produces lynch law.\r\n\r\nNow, a layman can do but little more than to give utterance to the\r\nfeeling that so many laymen have. I earnestly hope that the bench and\r\nthe bar of the United States will in all proper ways see to it that the\r\ncustoms—for some of these things of which I complain are merely customs\r\nand not laws—inherited from the past when conditions were totally\r\ndifferent, shall not be perverted so as to wrong the whole public by\r\ngiving the criminal an advantage to which he is not entitled, and that\r\nsome substantial improvement shall be made in the direction of securing\r\ngreater expedition and greater certainty in the administration of\r\njustice, and especially in the administration of criminal justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A DELEGATION OF THE GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC, AT NEW ORLEANS, LA.,\r\n  OCTOBER 26, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comrades_:\r\n\r\nI want to thank you for coming here to greet me. I can not say how\r\nmuch it means to me to be greeted as I have been greeted by the men\r\nwho wore the blue and the men who wore the gray in this trip through\r\nthe Southland. At Little Rock my escort was composed of Union and\r\nConfederate soldiers, riding side by side, in pairs.\r\n\r\nAs I said at Richmond, second only to the man who wore the blue, I hold\r\nthe man who wore the gray, and we should indeed consider ourselves\r\nfortunate as a Nation that, forty years after the Civil War, we find\r\nall of our people can challenge as the possession of all every memory\r\nof valor left by both sides in the great contest. Now we know but one\r\nrivalry—the rivalry to see which of us can do most for the flag of a\r\nunited country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A DELEGATION OF CONFEDERATE VETERANS, AT NEW ORLEANS, LA.,\r\n  OCTOBER 26, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen: Rather, if you will allow one who took part in a very small\r\nwar to call you so, Comrades_:\r\n\r\nI accept your gift with pleasure. Although sometimes we have\r\ndifficulties in this country that we have to battle against, and\r\nsometimes things that we are not quite satisfied with, yet we are\r\npretty good people. I have felt this almost as never before during the\r\npast weeks. Now think what it means in a Nation for the President of\r\nthat Nation, forty years after one of the greatest wars of all time,\r\nto be able to come and speak as I spoke in the capital of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, and to feel that I was addressing a people as loyal to the\r\nflag of our reunited country as can be found in this broad land of ours.\r\n\r\nI passed in the shadow of the monument of Admiral Semmes in\r\nMobile—under whom one of my uncles fired the last gun that was\r\ndischarged from the “Alabama,” which another uncle built. The daughter\r\nof that admiral is now the wife of our Governor in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this is an honor I appreciate. I thank you not only for the\r\ngift and the words which accompany it, but for the spirit which lies\r\nbehind the words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE LUNCHEON, NEW ORLEANS, LA., OCTOBER 26, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governor; Mr. Mayor; and You, My Hosts_:\r\n\r\nLet me, at the outset, express through you my profound gratitude, my\r\ndeeply moved appreciation of the way in which the people of New Orleans\r\nand of Louisiana have greeted me to-day. Gentlemen, no President of\r\nthe United States could be greeted as I have been greeted to-day and\r\nnot go back to take up the duties of his office with a stronger and\r\nmore earnest purpose to try faithfully to represent all the people\r\nwhom he serves. And, Governor, as you have so well said, when a man\r\nis President, when he holds any public office, questions of a merely\r\npartisan character sink into absolute insignificance compared with the\r\nmighty questions upon which all good Americans should be united.\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen, as you have greeted me so well, you have given me\r\nthe opportunity to indulge myself in a luxury. There have been moments\r\nin the past when I was afraid of saying how well I thought of the\r\nSenators and Representatives in the National Congress from Louisiana\r\nfor fear I might damage them! I did not know but that, may be, the\r\nbest service I could do them was to keep still about my feeling for\r\nthem. Now, I am emboldened by your generous kindness and confidence\r\nto say that it has been indeed a pleasure to deal with Louisiana’s\r\nrepresentatives in the Senate and in the Lower House of Congress,\r\nbecause whenever I had to do with a great question of national\r\nimportance I could go to them, convinced that if I could show them that\r\nit was really for the good of the Nation they would stand for it. That\r\nis all I ask of any man. I do not want any Senator or any Congressman\r\nto vote for anything I favor just because I favor it; but I do not\r\nwant him to vote against it just because I favor it. There have been\r\ncertain very worthy men in both Houses of Congress among the colleagues\r\nof the Louisiana representatives who instantly strove to prevent the\r\nrealization of their most cherished projects as soon as I strove to\r\nbring it about! Now, from the representatives of Louisiana I was sure\r\nof support in such matters, whether it was a question of building up\r\nand keeping at a high point of efficiency the United States Navy, or\r\nwhether it was a question of building the Panama Canal. And mind you,\r\ngentlemen, the two things go together. One thing that, as President of\r\nthis country, I will not do, is to make a bluff that I can not make\r\ngood. I do not intend, on behalf of the Nation, to take any position\r\nuntil I have carefully thought out whether that position will be\r\nadvantageous to the Nation, but if I take it I am going to keep it, and\r\nI am going to keep it no matter what outsider goes the other way. And\r\nI am sure that you, gentlemen, know that it has been an utter mistake\r\nto think of me as a man desirous of seeing this Nation quarrelsome;\r\nthis Nation eager to get into trouble. I have no respect either for the\r\nnation or for the individual that brawls, that invites trouble. I want\r\nto see this Nation do as the individual men in the Nation, who respect\r\nthemselves, should do, that is be scrupulously regardful of the rights\r\nof others and honestly endeavor to avoid all cause of difficulty with\r\nany one. But I want, on behalf of this Nation, the peace that comes,\r\nnot to the coward who cringes for it, but to the just man armed who\r\nasks it as a right.\r\n\r\nListening to the greeting of the Governor and the Mayor this afternoon,\r\nI felt at once very proud and very humble. I have been greeted with\r\nwords far above my worth, far above what is merited by what I have\r\ndone. (Cries of “No, No!”) I did not say that for the purpose of\r\nasking your dissent from it. I do not say anything unless I mean it,\r\nand I do not say anything to flatter any audience or speak well of them\r\nunless I think well of them, and would speak well of them anywhere.\r\n\r\nI come down to see you of this State and city with a heart full of\r\ngratitude to you for having displayed, through the trials of the\r\nhard summer that has passed, those qualities of heroism which we\r\nlike to think of as distinctly American. Gentlemen, in coming among\r\nyou this afternoon, I have the feeling of a man who, having been at\r\nheadquarters, but not in action, goes to see a regiment that has been\r\nin action. I know that you understand, gentlemen, that the Governor\r\nand Mayor, at any time during the past summer, had but to request my\r\npresence, and I would have come down here at once, at any time when I\r\ncould have been of the slightest assistance to you in the magnificent\r\nstruggle you were waging. I wish to express the profound appreciation\r\nand gratitude of all Americans toward you, our fellow-Americans, who\r\nhave borne the heat and burden of the contest during the long day that\r\nis now passing. In actual war there can be no greater or more effective\r\nheroism than was shown by those who stayed here at their posts; by\r\nthose who, being away, came back; and by those who, having planned to\r\ngo away, instantly gave up going away and stayed here to aid in the\r\nfight for their fellows in distress. You have had your martyrs, among\r\nthem my lamented friend, Archbishop Chappelle; but you have also your\r\nproud memories of service rendered, and the thrill that comes with the\r\nvictory you have already won. I have been both amused and irritated\r\nat the criticisms sometimes made on you, by people who lived in other\r\ncommunities that were not in danger. Among the younger men here are\r\nsome who when younger still have played football, and they will\r\nremember how very much easier it was to play the game from the side\r\nlines than on the field. Now, Louisiana and New Orleans, this summer,\r\ndid what, so far as I remember, has never before been done in the case\r\nof a similar epidemic of yellow fever in the United States. They took\r\nhold of it after it had started and when it had got well under way,\r\nand they controlled and conquered it without waiting for the frost to\r\ncome. The highest gratitude is due to the officials of the State, to\r\nthe officials of the city, and to the private individuals, clergymen,\r\neducators, philanthropists, and business men, who have spent their time\r\nand money and risked their lives freely in organizing and achieving\r\nsuccess. It was the greatest privilege to me to contribute what I\r\nwas able to the work. Mr. Mayor, Governor, you can hardly realize\r\nthe pleasure I felt when a request was made upon me that gave me the\r\nchance of doing something for you; and I am glad to find how well you\r\nthink of the work that was done by the United States Public Health and\r\nMarine Hospital Service under Dr. White. It gives me pleasure now to\r\nannounce that in response to the request of the Governor and Mayor I\r\nhave told them that Dr. White shall be detailed down here just as long\r\nas his services are needed. Now, just one word of warning to you, Dr.\r\nWhite. We have excellent Scriptural authority for the statement that\r\nit is well to beware when all men speak well of you; because it is an\r\nunfortunate feature of human nature that when they have appreciated a\r\nman up to the very last limit, they tend to go a little bit the other\r\nway, after a while. The time when one is praised very much is the time\r\none should walk guardedly and carefully and work with all one’s soul\r\nand strength. Gentlemen, that applies to Presidents quite as much as to\r\ndoctors!\r\n\r\nThe Governor spoke of the Panama Canal. It is a very big work, and it\r\nis only a very big nation that can do that kind of work. I expect soon\r\nto have a report from the engineers as to the exact shape the work will\r\ntake. I will then be able to make more definite forecasts as to the\r\ntime, but of this I can assure you, the work will be done well, it will\r\nbe done as speedily as possible, and it will absolutely and surely be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nOne more point: New Orleans and Louisiana are vitally interested in the\r\nlevee system. The Mississippi, which flows through the State, drains\r\nportions of twenty odd other States, and the control of that river\r\nmust, in my opinion, be, in good part, a national object. The National\r\nGovernment now does something toward the erection and care of the\r\nlevees. In my judgment it should do not only more, but very much more.\r\n\r\nI was greeted to-day by your school-children, clustered around the\r\nmonument erected to that pure and upright man and mighty General,\r\nRobert E. Lee; and as we drove away from the square in which his statue\r\nstands we passed by a house in this old Confederate city in which there\r\nwas prominently displayed a picture of Abraham Lincoln, and underneath\r\nit the words, “With malice toward none, with charity toward all.” I\r\nhave been greeted by a special guard of honor, composed of men who, in\r\nthe great war, wore the Confederate uniform. I have also been greeted\r\nby men who, in that war, wore the blue. I saw before me many of my\r\ncomrades of the lesser war. I had in my own regiment, from Louisiana\r\nas well as from many other States, men whose fathers had worn the\r\ngray, just as I had other men whose fathers had worn the blue, all\r\nunited forever in loyalty to one indissoluble union, and acknowledging\r\nonly the rivalry of trying to see which could do the most for the\r\nflag of our common country. Oh, my fellow-countrymen, think what a\r\nfortune is ours, that we belong to this Nation, which, having fought\r\none of the mightiest wars of all times, is now reunited forever, in\r\nan indissoluble union, under one flag; so that we claim as ours the\r\nheritage of honor and glory, left by every man who, on whichever side\r\nhe stood, when the days came which tried men’s souls, did all that in\r\nhim lay—did his whole duty—according to the light that was given him to\r\nsee that duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH TO THE OFFICERS AND CREW OF THE U. S. FLAGSHIP “WEST VIRGINIA,”\r\n  AT SEA, OCTOBER 29, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Admiral, Captain, Officers and Ship’s Company of the “West Virginia”_:\r\n\r\nIt is a privilege for any President to come on board a squadron of\r\nAmerican warships such as these, not alone to see the ships, but to\r\nsee the men who handle them. From the admiral down through the entire\r\nship’s company, every American should be proud of what I have seen\r\naboard this ship; the discipline, the ready subordination of each man,\r\nwhether officer or enlisted man, to duty; the care taken of the men,\r\nand in return the eager, intelligent, self-respecting zeal of each\r\nman in doing his work. What must impress especially any observer is\r\nhow essential it is that every individual on a ship like this should\r\ndo his whole duty, and in any crisis more than his duty. The result\r\nas I see it in this ship is a triumph not only of organization and\r\ndiscipline, but of the ready zeal with which each individual performs\r\nhis allotted task. At any time some emergency may arise in which the\r\nsafety of the entire ship will depend upon the vigilance, intelligence,\r\nand cool courage of some one man among you, perhaps an officer, perhaps\r\nan enlisted man. Any man in the whole ship’s company who does his full\r\nduty can claim as his own the honor and repute of the ship and has the\r\nright to feel a personal pride in all she does. You and your fellows\r\nin the Navy and in its sister service, the Army, occupy a position\r\ndifferent from that of any other set of men in our country. Going\r\nthrough the ship yesterday, in the engine rooms, storerooms, turrets,\r\neverywhere the thing that impressed me most was the all-importance of\r\neach man in his place: the all-importance of that man both knowing his\r\nwork and feeling it a matter of keen personal pride to do it as well as\r\nit could possibly be done. All through the ship I have seen the same\r\npurpose, the purpose to learn exactly what the duty to be done was and\r\nthen to do it; and the power to do presupposes the possession by each\r\nof you of intelligence, courage, and physical address. I believe that\r\nthis attitude of yours is typical of the attitude of the men of our\r\nNavy generally and of the Army also. Now on the one hand this should\r\nmake our country feel toward Uncle Sam’s men in the Army and in the\r\nNavy a sense of obligation and gratitude such as they feel toward no\r\nothers; and on the other hand it should make you feel that no other\r\nAmericans rest under so great an obligation to do their duty well;\r\nfor in your hands lies the credit, the honor, and the interest of the\r\nentire Nation. You are doing your duty well and faithfully in peace.\r\nRemember that if ever, which may Heaven forbid, war comes, it will\r\ndepend upon you and those like you whether the people of this country\r\nare to hold their heads even higher or to hang them in shame. I hope\r\nthat no such crisis will ever occur, but I have entire faith that if it\r\never does occur, you will rise level to any demand that may be made\r\nupon you, and that by the way you train yourselves and are trained in\r\ntime of peace, you will fit yourselves to do well should war arise.\r\n\r\nNow a special word to the officers. Captain Arnold, as a boy you\r\nwitnessed a great fight of the “Merrimac” when she came out to Hampton\r\nRoads, sank the “Congress” and the “Cumberland,” and the next day met\r\nher match in the “Monitor.” That was a fight fraught with great honor\r\nfor our people. The “Cumberland” sank with her flags flying and her\r\nguns firing while her decks were awash, and as the water was shallow,\r\nher flag still floated from the mast above them after she had gone\r\ndown. The captain of the “Congress” met his death in the fight, winning\r\nan epitaph which deserves to be remembered forever in the American\r\nNavy. His name was Joe Smith, and his father, an old naval officer, was\r\nin Washington. When word was brought to him that his son’s ship had\r\nsurrendered, he answered simply: “Then Joe is dead.” To have earned\r\nthe right to have his death assumed as a matter of course in such\r\nconditions is of itself enough to crown any life, and every American\r\nofficer should keep ever before him all that is implied therein. Let\r\neach of you officers remember, in the event of war, that while a\r\nsurrender must always be justifiable, yet that a surrender must always\r\nbe explained, while it is never necessary to explain the fact that you\r\ndon’t surrender, no matter what the conditions may be.\r\n\r\nA tragedy occurred this morning. A man was lost from the “Colorado.”\r\nSuch cases are from time to time inevitable in a service like ours.\r\nUnder such circumstances, everything must always be done, as in this\r\ninstance everything was done, for the rescue of the man. But you men\r\nare fitted for fighting because you have the fighting edge. This means\r\nthat you are willing at all times to face death in the performance of\r\nyour duty. The man who died this morning was an excellent seaman who\r\nhad done his duty faithfully and who died in the performance of that\r\nduty. Therefore he died in the service of his country exactly as much\r\nas if he had died in battle, and deserves as much honor.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said so far applies to the whole Navy. Now a word\r\nespecially to this squadron and to this ship. No other nation can boast\r\nof a better squadron, a squadron composed of more formidable vessels.\r\nIn the matter of the officers and men, we have no cause to shrink from\r\ncomparison with any other nation. So far, the “Colorado” has been the\r\none ship that has had the chance to show what she could do in gunnery\r\npractice, and her record has been so astonishingly good that the other\r\nships of the squadron will have to do their level best if they expect\r\neven to equal it. I need not tell you to remember that battles are\r\ndecided by gunfire, and that the only shots that count are the shots\r\nthat hit.\r\n\r\nMen, I am glad to have seen you, and I don’t think that anywhere under\r\nour flag there could be found a better set of clean-cut, vigorous,\r\nself-respecting American citizens of the very type that makes one\r\nproudest to be an American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO A DELEGATION OF RAILWAY EMPLOYEES’ ORDERS—EXECUTIVE OFFICE,\r\n  WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 14, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI have just a word that I want to say to you. In the first place, I\r\ntrust I need hardly say that no delegation will ever be more welcome\r\nat the White House than such a delegation as this. The interests of\r\nthe wage-worker and the interests of the tiller of the soil must be\r\npeculiarly close to all American public men; among other reasons for\r\nthe reason that if they prosper all other classes will prosper likewise\r\nas a matter of course. As I said the other day to the representatives\r\nof organized labor at Atlanta, I shall do everything in my power for\r\nthe laboring man except to do anything wrong; for the man who will\r\ndo anything wrong in the nominal interest of another man will also\r\ndo wrong against this same other man if ever it becomes to his own\r\ninterest to do so. Your associations deserve peculiar regard because\r\nyou have developed to a marked degree the very qualities that all\r\nbodies of wage-workers should develop: the intelligence, the regard for\r\nthe future, the self-respect mingled with the respect for others, the\r\npower of self-restraint, which are absolutely essential to any body\r\nof men which is to move upward and onward. Remember always that every\r\nman of us must in some shape or other have his passions and appetites\r\ngoverned; and the less of that government there is from within the\r\nmore there will have to be from without.\r\n\r\nWith most of the general statements that you make I agree, but I am\r\nnot sure that I agree with your application of them. There has been\r\ncomparatively little complaint to me of the railroad rates being\r\nas a whole too high. The most serious complaints that have been\r\nmade to me have been of improper discrimination in railroad rates.\r\nFor instance, in two recent cases affecting great corporations the\r\ncomplaints that have been made to me have been that they are too low\r\nas regards certain big shippers; the complaint in both these cases is\r\nabout the differential, the difference of treatment of two sets of\r\nusers of the railways, the difference in favor of one set of shippers\r\nas against another set of shippers. Whether this is just or not I am\r\nnot prepared to say. I very deeply appreciate and sympathize with the\r\nfeeling you express as to the community of interest between the man\r\nwho actually does the handling of the trains, at the brakes, in the\r\nengine cab, as a fireman, as a conductor, and the man who has to do,\r\nas a capitalist or as the higher employee of the capitalist, with the\r\ngeneral management of the road. I feel that one of the lessons that can\r\nnot be overinculcated is the lesson of the identity of interest among\r\nour people as a whole. I do not have to tell a body like this something\r\nthat I do have to tell some other bodies, and that is if you have not\r\ngot at the head of a railroad a man who can make a success of it, the\r\nwage-workers on that railroad can not prosper. You must have at the\r\nhead the type of ability which can do well; just as you, comrade of\r\nthe Civil War (turning to an engineer who wore the button of the Grand\r\nArmy) needed a general who knew his business, or your valor did not\r\navail. You remember that the valor of the best enlisted man that ever\r\nwas (of course he was the basis of everything; the man who carried the\r\ngun and made the army; and you could not get the right stuff out of\r\nhim if it was not in him) was of no value if there was not a directing\r\npower to see that the valor was used aright. The Union Army could have\r\naccomplished nothing if the feeling of the enlisted men had been the\r\nwish to down Grant and Sherman instead of supporting them heartily in\r\nachieving the common work for which all in common were striving.\r\n\r\nIf you will look at my Raleigh speech and my other recent utterances\r\nyou will see my principles clearly set forth. I have said again and\r\nagain that I would not tolerate for one moment any injustice to a\r\nrailroad any more than I would tolerate any injustice by a railroad.\r\nI have said again and again that I would remove a public official who\r\nimproperly yielded to any public clamor against a railroad, no matter\r\nhow popular that clamor might be, just as quickly as I would remove\r\na public official who rendered an improper service to the railroad\r\nat the expense of the public. But I am convinced that there must\r\nbe an increased regulatory and supervisory power exercised by the\r\nGovernment over the railways. Indeed, I would like it exercised to a\r\nmuch greater extent than I have any idea of pressing at the moment.\r\nFor instance, I would greatly like to have it exercised in the matter\r\nof overcapitalization. I am convinced that the “wages fund” would be\r\nlarger if there was no fictitious capital upon which dividends had\r\nto be paid. I need hardly say that this does not mean hostility to\r\nwealth. If you gentlemen here, in whom I believe so strongly, were all\r\na unit in demanding that some improper action should be taken against\r\ncertain men of wealth, then, no matter whether I did or did not like\r\nthose same men of wealth, I would defend them against you, no matter\r\nhow much I cared for you; and in so doing I would really be acting in\r\nyour own interest. I would be false to your interest if I failed to do\r\njustice to the capitalist as much as to the wage-worker. But I shall\r\nact against the abuses of wealth just as against all other abuses. The\r\noutcry against rate regulation is of much the same character as that\r\nI encountered when I was engaged in putting through that car-coupling\r\nbusiness; or in endeavoring to secure certain legislation in which you\r\nhave all been interested, such as the employers’ liability law.\r\n\r\nMost certainly I will join with you in resisting to the uttermost\r\nany movement to hurt or damage any railroads which act decently, for\r\nI would hold that such damage was not merely to the capitalist, not\r\nmerely to the wage-worker engaged on the railroads, but to all the\r\ncountry. My aim is to secure the just and equal treatment of the\r\npublic by those (I trust and believe a limited number) who do not want\r\nto give it, just as much as by the larger number who do want to give\r\nit. All I want in any rate legislation is to give the Government an\r\nefficient supervisory power which shall be exercised as scrupulously to\r\nprevent injustice to the railroads as to prevent their doing injustice\r\nto the public. Our endeavor is to see that those big railroad men and\r\nbig shippers who are not responsive to the demands of justice are\r\nrequired to do what their fellows who are responsive to the demands of\r\njustice would be glad to do of their own accord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE COMMUNICATED TO THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF\r\n  THE FIRST SESSION OF THE FIFTY-NINTH CONGRESS, DECEMBER 5, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity.\r\nUndoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb\r\nand flow will be felt more or less by all members of the community,\r\nboth by the deserving and the undeserving. Against the wrath of the\r\nLord the wisdom of man can not avail; in times of flood or drought\r\nhuman ingenuity can but partially repair the disaster. A general\r\nfailure of crops would hurt all of us. Again, if the folly of man mars\r\nthe general well-being, then those who are innocent of the folly will\r\nhave to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of\r\nthe folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the\r\nbusiness community would hurt the whole business community. But such\r\nstoppage of welfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting.\r\nIn the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of\r\nthe country is the high individual character of the average American\r\nworker, the average American citizen, no matter whether his work be\r\nmental or manual, whether he be farmer or wage-worker, business man or\r\nprofessional man.\r\n\r\nIn our industrial and social system the interests of all men are\r\nso closely intertwined that in the immense majority of cases a\r\nstraight-dealing man who by his efficiency, by his ingenuity and\r\nindustry, benefits himself must also benefit others. Normally the man\r\nof great productive capacity who becomes rich by guiding the labor\r\nof many other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they\r\ncould produce without his guidance; and both he and they share in the\r\nbenefit, which comes also to the public at large. The superficial\r\nfact that the sharing may be unequal must never blind us to the\r\nunderlying fact that there is this sharing, and that the benefit comes\r\nin some degree to each man concerned. Normally the wage-worker, the\r\nman of small means, and the average consumer, as well as the average\r\nproducer, are all alike helped by making conditions such that the man\r\nof exceptional business ability receives an exceptional reward for\r\nhis ability. Something can be done by legislation to help the general\r\nprosperity; but no such help of a permanently beneficial character\r\ncan be given to the less able and less fortunate, save as the results\r\nof a policy which shall inure to the advantage of all industrious and\r\nefficient people who act decently; and this is only another way of\r\nsaying that any benefit which comes to the less able and less fortunate\r\nmust of necessity come even more to the more able and more fortunate.\r\nIf, therefore, the less fortunate man is moved by envy of his more\r\nfortunate brother to strike at the conditions under which they have\r\nboth, though unequally, prospered, the result will assuredly be that\r\nwhile damage may come to the one struck at, it will visit with an even\r\nheavier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole, we must\r\nall go up or go down together.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet, while not merely admitting, but insisting upon this, it is also\r\ntrue that where there is no governmental restraint or supervision some\r\nof the exceptional men use their energies not in ways that are for\r\nthe common good, but in ways which tell against this common good. The\r\nfortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, and\r\nvest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of\r\nnecessity to give to the sovereign—that is, to the Government, which\r\nrepresents the people as a whole—some effective power of supervision\r\nover their corporate use. In order to ensure a healthy social and\r\nindustrial life, every big corporation should be held responsible by,\r\nand be accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to control its\r\nconduct. I am in no sense hostile to corporations. This is an age of\r\ncombination, and any effort to prevent all combination will be not only\r\nuseless, but in the end vicious, because of the contempt for law which\r\nthe failure to enforce law inevitably produces. We should, moreover,\r\nrecognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected\r\nby corporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth of\r\nintellect, energy, and fidelity devoted to their service, and therefore\r\nnormally to the service of the public, by their officers and directors.\r\nThe corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come to\r\nstay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so\r\nlong as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it acts\r\nagainst law and justice.\r\n\r\nSo long as the finances of the Nation are kept upon an honest basis\r\nno other question of internal economy with which the Congress has\r\nthe power to deal begins to approach in importance the matter of\r\nendeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which the\r\nindividuals—and especially the great corporations—doing an interstate\r\nbusiness are to act. The makers of our National Constitution provided\r\nespecially that the regulation of interstate commerce should come\r\nwithin the sphere of the General Government. The arguments in favor\r\nof their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are\r\nfar stronger to-day, in view of the enormous development of great\r\nbusiness agencies, usually corporate in form. Experience has shown\r\nconclusively that it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation\r\nand supervision of these great corporations by State action. Such\r\nregulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a\r\nsovereign whose jurisdiction is coextensive with the field of work of\r\nthe corporations—that is, by the National Government. I believe that\r\nthis regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of\r\nlaw by the Congress. If this proves impossible, it will certainly be\r\nnecessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon the\r\nNational Government by a proper amendment of the Constitution. It would\r\nobviously be unwise to endeavor to secure such an amendment until it\r\nis certain that the result can not be obtained under the Constitution\r\nas it now is. The laws of the Congress and of the several States\r\nhitherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often in\r\nshowing that the States have no power in the matter than that the\r\nNational Government has power; so that there at present exists a very\r\nunfortunate condition of things, under which these great corporations\r\ndoing an interstate business occupy the position of subjects without\r\na sovereign, neither any State government nor the National Government\r\nhaving effective control over them. Our steady aim should be by\r\nlegislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely\r\npersevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the National Government by\r\naffirmative action.\r\n\r\nThis is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely a\r\nrestoration; for from the earliest time such regulation of industrial\r\nactivities has been recognized in the action of the lawmaking bodies;\r\nand all that I propose is to meet the changed conditions in such manner\r\nas will prevent the Commonwealth abdicating the power it has always\r\npossessed, not only in this country but also in England before and\r\nsince this country became a separate Nation.\r\n\r\nIt has been a misfortune that the national laws on this subject have\r\nhitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmative\r\nkind, and still more that they have in part sought to prohibit what\r\ncould not be effectively prohibited, and have in part in their\r\nprohibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not be\r\nallowed. It is generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint on\r\ncompetition, whether this restraint be reasonable or unreasonable; and\r\nwhere it is not useless it is generally hurtful. Events have shown\r\nthat it is not possible adequately to secure the enforcement of any\r\nlaw of this kind by incessant appeal to the courts. The Department\r\nof Justice has for the last four years devoted more attention to the\r\nenforcement of the anti-trust legislation than to anything else. Much\r\nhas been accomplished; particularly marked has been the moral effect\r\nof the prosecutions; but it is increasingly evident that there will be\r\na very insufficient beneficial result in the way of economic change.\r\nThe successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately\r\ndevelops another device to accomplish the same purpose. What is needed\r\nis not sweeping prohibition of every arrangement, good or bad, which\r\nmay tend to restrict competition, but such adequate supervision and\r\nregulation as will prevent any restriction of competition from being to\r\nthe detriment of the public, as well as such supervision and regulation\r\nas will prevent other abuses in no way connected with restriction of\r\ncompetition. Of these abuses, perhaps the chief, although by no means\r\nthe only one, is overcapitalization—generally itself the result of\r\ndishonest promotion—because of the myriad evils it brings in its train;\r\nfor such overcapitalization often means an inflation that invites\r\nbusiness panic; it always conceals the true relation of the profit\r\nearned to the capital actually invested, and it creates a burden of\r\ninterest payments which is a fertile cause of improper reduction in or\r\nlimitation of wages; it damages the small investor, discourages thrift,\r\nand encourages gambling and speculation; while perhaps worst of all is\r\nthe trickiness and dishonesty which it implies—for harm to morals is\r\nworse than any possible harm to material interests, and the debauchery\r\nof politics and business by great dishonest corporations is far worse\r\nthan any actual material evil they do the public. Until the National\r\nGovernment obtains, in some manner which the wisdom of the Congress may\r\nsuggest, proper control over the big corporations engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce—that is, over the great majority of the big corporations—it\r\nwill be impossible to deal adequately with these evils.\r\n\r\nI am well aware of the difficulties of the legislation that I am\r\nsuggesting, and of the need of temperate and cautious action in\r\nsecuring it. I should emphatically protest against improperly radical\r\nor hasty action. The first thing to do is to deal with the great\r\ncorporations engaged in the business of interstate transportation. As I\r\nsaid in my Message of December 6 last, the immediate and most pressing\r\nneed, so far as legislation is concerned, is the enactment into law of\r\nsome scheme to secure to the agents of the Government such supervision\r\nand regulation of the rates charged by the railroads of the country\r\nengaged in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively\r\nprevent the imposition of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must include\r\nputting a complete stop to rebates in every shape and form. This power\r\nto regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world,\r\nshould be exercised with moderation, caution, and self-restraint; but\r\nit should exist, so that it can be effectively exercised when the need\r\narises.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should be\r\naffirmative and should be given to some administrative body created by\r\nthe Congress. If given to the present Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nor to a reorganized Interstate Commerce Commission, such commission\r\nshould be made unequivocally administrative. I do not believe in the\r\nGovernment interfering with private business more than is necessary.\r\nI do not believe in the Government undertaking any work which can with\r\npropriety be left in private hands. But neither do I believe in the\r\nGovernment flinching from overseeing any work when it becomes evident\r\nthat abuses are sure to obtain therein unless there is governmental\r\nsupervision. It is not my province to indicate the exact terms of the\r\nlaw which should be enacted; but I call the attention of the Congress\r\nto certain existing conditions with which it is desirable to deal. In\r\nmy judgment the most important provision which such law should contain\r\nis that conferring upon some competent administrative body the power\r\nto decide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rate\r\nprescribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, and if it is found\r\nto be unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investigation of the\r\ncomplaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be\r\nlawful to go—the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly called—this\r\ndecision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from\r\nthence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens\r\nat present, not that a rate is too high but that a favored shipper\r\nis given too low a rate. In such case the Commission would have the\r\nright to fix this already established minimum rate as the maximum;\r\nand it would need only one or two such decisions by the Commission to\r\ncure railroad companies of the practice of giving improper minimum\r\nrates. I call your attention to the fact that my proposal is not to\r\ngive the Commission power to initiate or originate rates generally,\r\nbut to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by the roads, upon\r\ncomplaint and after investigation. A heavy penalty should be exacted\r\nfrom any corporation which fails to respect an order of the Commission.\r\nI regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential\r\nto any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway regulation.\r\nThe first necessity is to secure it; and unless it is granted to the\r\nCommission there is little use in touching the subject at all.\r\n\r\nIllegal transactions often occur under the forms of law. It has often\r\noccurred that a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to buy a\r\nlarge quantity of some commodity and then after it has been bought an\r\nopen reduction is made in the rate to take effect immediately, the\r\narrangement resulting to the profit of the one shipper and the one\r\nrailroad and to the damage of all their competitors; for it must not\r\nbe forgotten that the big shippers are at least as much to blame as\r\nany railroad in the matter of rebates. The law should make it clear so\r\nthat nobody can fail to understand that any kind of commission paid on\r\nfreight shipments, whether in this form or in the form of fictitious\r\ndamages, or of a concession, a free pass, reduced passenger rate, or\r\npayment of brokerage, is illegal. It is worth while considering whether\r\nit would not be wise to confer on the Government the right of civil\r\naction against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value\r\nof the rebate; this would help stop what is really blackmail. Elevator\r\nallowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent\r\nthat they are demoralizing and are used as rebates.\r\n\r\nThe best possible regulation of rates would, of course, be that\r\nregulation secured by an honest agreement among the railroads\r\nthemselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, for\r\ninstance, at once put a stop to the efforts of any one big shipper or\r\nbig railroad to discriminate against or secure advantages over some\r\nrival; and such agreement would make the railroads themselves agents\r\nfor enforcing the law. The power vested in the Government to put a stop\r\nto agreements to the detriment of the public should, in my judgment,\r\nbe accompanied by power to permit, under specified conditions and\r\ncareful supervision, agreements clearly in the interest of the public.\r\nBut, in my judgment, the necessity for giving this further power is\r\nby no means as great as the necessity for giving the Commission or\r\nadministrative body the other powers I have enumerated above; and it\r\nmay well be inadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power in the\r\nCommission or other administrative body until it already possesses and\r\nis exercising what I regard as by far the most important of all the\r\npowers I recommend—as indeed the vitally important power—that to fix a\r\ngiven maximum rate, which rate, after the lapse of a reasonable time,\r\ngoes into full effect, subject to review by the courts.\r\n\r\nAll private-car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the\r\nlike should be expressly put under the supervision of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission or some similar body so far as rates, and\r\nagreements practically affecting rates, are concerned. The private-car\r\nowners and the owners of industrial railroads are entitled to a fair\r\nand reasonable compensation on their investment, but neither private\r\ncars nor industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized as\r\ndevices for securing preferential rates. A rebate in icing charges,\r\nor in mileage, or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges\r\nis just as pernicious as a rebate in any other way. No lower rate\r\nshould apply on goods imported than actually obtains on domestic goods\r\nfrom the American seaboard to destination except in cases where water\r\ncompetition is the controlling influence. There should be publicity\r\nof the accounts of common carriers; no common carrier engaged in\r\ninterstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those\r\nreported pursuant to law or regulation, and these books or memoranda\r\nshould be open to the inspection of the Government. Only in this way\r\ncan violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of\r\nexamination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that\r\nnow conducted into the national banks by the bank examiners; a few\r\nfirst-class railroad accountants, if they had proper direction and\r\nproper authority to inspect books and papers, could accomplish much\r\nin preventing wilful violations of the law. It would not be necessary\r\nfor them to examine into the accounts of any railroad unless for\r\ngood reasons they were directed to do so by the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission. It is greatly to be desired that some way might be found\r\nby which an agreement as to transportation within a State intended to\r\noperate as a fraud upon the Federal interstate commerce laws could be\r\nbrought under the jurisdiction of the Federal authorities. At present\r\nit occurs that large shipments of interstate traffic are controlled by\r\nconcessions on purely State business, which of course amounts to an\r\nevasion of the law. The Commission should have power to enforce fair\r\ntreatment by the great trunk lines of lateral and branch lines.\r\n\r\nI urge upon the Congress the need of providing for expeditious action\r\nby the Interstate Commerce Commission in all these matters, whether\r\nin regulating rates for transportation or for storing or for handling\r\nproperty or commodities in transit. The history of the cases litigated\r\nunder the present commerce act shows that its efficacy has been to\r\na great degree destroyed by the weapon of delay, almost the most\r\nformidable weapon in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violate\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nLet me most earnestly say that these recommendations are not made\r\nin any spirit of hostility to the railroads. On ethical grounds, on\r\ngrounds of right, such hostility would be intolerable; and on grounds\r\nof mere national self-interest we must remember that such hostility\r\nwould tell against the welfare not merely of some few rich men, but\r\nof a multitude of small investors, a multitude of railway employees,\r\nwage-workers; and most severely against the interest of the public as\r\na whole. I believe that on the whole our railroads have done well and\r\nnot ill; but the railroad men who wish to do well should not be exposed\r\nto competition with those who have no such desire, and the only way to\r\nsecure this end is to give to some Government tribunal the power to\r\nsee that justice is done by the unwilling exactly as it is gladly done\r\nby the willing. Moreover, if some Government body is given increased\r\npower the effect will be to furnish authoritative answer on behalf\r\nof the railroad whenever irrational clamor against it is raised, or\r\nwhenever charges made against it are disproved. I ask this legislation\r\nnot only in the interest of the public, but in the interest of the\r\nhonest railroad man and the honest shipper alike, for it is they who\r\nare chiefly jeoparded by the practices of their dishonest competitors.\r\nThis legislation should be enacted in a spirit as remote as possible\r\nfrom hysteria and rancor. If we of the American body politic are true\r\nto the traditions we have inherited we shall always scorn any effort\r\nto make us hate any man because he is rich, just as much as we should\r\nscorn any effort to make us look down upon or treat contemptuously any\r\nman because he is poor. We judge a man by his conduct—that is, by his\r\ncharacter—and not by his wealth or intellect. If he makes his fortune\r\nhonestly, there is no just cause of quarrel with him. Indeed, we have\r\nnothing but the kindliest feelings of admiration for the successful\r\nbusiness man who behaves decently, whether he has made his success\r\nby building or managing a railroad or by shipping goods over that\r\nrailroad. The big railroad men and big shippers are simply Americans of\r\nthe ordinary type who have developed to an extraordinary degree certain\r\ngreat business qualities. They are neither better nor worse than their\r\nfellow-citizens of smaller means. They are merely more able in certain\r\nlines and therefore exposed to certain peculiarly strong temptations.\r\nThese temptations have not sprung newly into being; the exceptionally\r\nsuccessful among mankind have always been exposed to them; but they\r\nhave grown amazingly in power as a result of the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of industrialism along new lines, and under these new\r\nconditions, which the lawmakers of old could not foresee and therefore\r\ncould not provide against, they have become so serious and menacing\r\nas to demand entirely new remedies. It is in the interest of the best\r\ntype of railroad man and the best type of shipper no less than of the\r\npublic that there should be governmental supervision and regulation\r\nof these great business operations, for the same reason that it is in\r\nthe interest of the corporation which wishes to treat its employees\r\naright that there should be an effective employers’ liability act, or\r\nan effective system of factory laws to prevent the abuse of women and\r\nchildren. All such legislation frees the corporation that wishes to do\r\nwell from being driven into doing ill, in order to compete with its\r\nrival, which prefers to do ill. We desire to set up a moral standard.\r\nThere can be no delusion more fatal to the Nation than the delusion\r\nthat the standard of profits, of business prosperity, is sufficient in\r\njudging any business or political question—from rate legislation to\r\nmunicipal government. Business success, whether for the individual or\r\nfor the Nation, is a good thing only so far as it is accompanied by and\r\ndevelops a high standard of conduct—honor, integrity, civic courage.\r\nThe kind of business prosperity that blunts the standard of honor, that\r\nputs an inordinate value on mere wealth, that makes a man ruthless and\r\nconscienceless in trade and weak and cowardly in citizenship, is not a\r\ngood thing at all, but a very bad thing for the Nation. This Government\r\nstands for manhood first and for business only as an adjunct of manhood.\r\n\r\nThe question of transportation lies at the root of all industrial\r\nsuccess, and the revolution in transportation which has taken place\r\nduring the last half century has been the most important factor in\r\nthe growth of the new industrial conditions. Most emphatically we do\r\nnot wish to see the man of great talents refused the reward for his\r\ntalents. Still less do we wish to see him penalized; but we do desire\r\nto see the system of railroad transportation so handled that the strong\r\nman shall be given no advantage over the weak man. We wish to ensure\r\nas fair treatment for the small town as for the big city; for the\r\nsmall shipper as for the big shipper. In the old days the highway of\r\ncommerce, whether by water or by road on land, was open to all; it\r\nbelonged to the public and the traffic along it was free. At present\r\nthe railway is this highway, and we must do our best to see that it is\r\nkept open to all on equal terms. Unlike the old highway it is a very\r\ndifficult and complex thing to manage, and it is far better that it\r\nshould be managed by private individuals than by the Government. But it\r\ncan only be so managed on condition that justice is done the public.\r\nIt is because, in my judgment, public ownership of railroads is highly\r\nundesirable and would probably in this country entail far-reaching\r\ndisaster, that I wish to see such supervision and regulation of them\r\nin the interest of the public as will make it evident that there is\r\nno need for public ownership. The opponents of Government regulation\r\ndwell upon the difficulties to be encountered and the intricate and\r\ninvolved nature of the problem. Their contention is true. It is a\r\ncomplicated and delicate problem, and all kinds of difficulties are\r\nsure to arise in connection with any plan of solution, while no plan\r\nwill bring all the benefits hoped for by its more optimistic adherents.\r\nMoreover, under any healthy plan, the benefits will develop gradually\r\nand not rapidly. Finally, we must clearly understand that the public\r\nservants who are to do this peculiarly responsible and delicate work\r\nmust themselves be of the highest type both as regards integrity and\r\nefficiency. They must be well paid, for otherwise able men can not in\r\nthe long run be secured; and they must possess a lofty probity which\r\nwill revolt as quickly at the thought of pandering to any gust of\r\npopular prejudice against rich men as at the thought of anything even\r\nremotely resembling subserviency to rich men. But while I fully admit\r\nthe difficulties in the way, I do not for a moment admit that these\r\ndifficulties warrant us in stopping in our effort to secure a wise and\r\njust system. They should have no other effect than to spur us on to the\r\nexercise of the resolution, the even-handed justice, and the fertility\r\nof resource, which we like to think of as typically American, and which\r\nwill in the end achieve good results in this as in other fields of\r\nactivity. The task is a great one and underlies the task of dealing\r\nwith the whole industrial problem. But the fact that it is a great\r\nproblem does not warrant us in shrinking from the attempt to solve it.\r\nAt present we face such utter lack of supervision, such freedom from\r\nthe restraints of law, that excellent men have often been literally\r\nforced into doing what they deplored because otherwise they were left\r\nat the mercy of unscrupulous competitors. To rail at and assail the men\r\nwho have done as they best could under such conditions accomplishes\r\nlittle. What we need to do is to develop an orderly system; and such a\r\nsystem can only come through the gradually increased exercise of the\r\nright of efficient Government control.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my annual Message to the Fifty-eighth Congress, at its third\r\nsession, I called attention to the necessity for legislation requiring\r\nthe use of block signals upon railroads engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce. The number of serious collisions upon unblocked roads that\r\nhave occurred within the past year adds force to the recommendation\r\nthen made. The Congress should provide, by appropriate legislation,\r\nfor the introduction of block signals upon all railroads engaged in\r\ninterstate commerce at the earliest practicable date, as a measure of\r\nincreased safety to the traveling public.\r\n\r\nThrough decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and the\r\nlower Federal courts in cases brought before them for adjudication\r\nthe safety-appliance law has been materially strengthened, and the\r\nGovernment has been enabled to secure its effective enforcement in\r\nalmost all cases, with the result that the condition of railroad\r\nequipment throughout the country is much improved and railroad\r\nemployees perform their duties under safer conditions than heretofore.\r\nThe Government’s most effective aid in arriving at this result has been\r\nits inspection service, and that these improved conditions are not\r\nmore general is due to the insufficient number of inspectors employed.\r\nThe inspection service has fully demonstrated its usefulness, and in\r\nappropriating for its maintenance the Congress should make provision\r\nfor an increase in the number of inspectors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe excessive hours of labor to which railroad employees in train\r\nservice are in many cases subjected is also a matter which may well\r\nengage the serious attention of the Congress. The strain, both mental\r\nand physical, upon those who are engaged in the movement and operation\r\nof railroad trains under modern conditions is perhaps greater than that\r\nwhich exists in any other industry, and if there are any reasons for\r\nlimiting by law the hours of labor in any employment, they certainly\r\napply with peculiar force to the employment of those upon whose\r\nvigilance and alertness in the performance of their duties the safety\r\nof all who travel by rail depends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my annual Message to the Fifty-seventh Congress, at its second\r\nsession, I recommended the passage of an Employers’ Liability Law\r\nfor the District of Columbia and in our navy yards. I renewed that\r\nrecommendation in my Message to the Fifty-eighth Congress, at its\r\nsecond session, and further suggested the appointment of a commission\r\nto make a comprehensive study of employers’ liability, with a view to\r\nthe enactment of a wise and constitutional law covering the subject,\r\napplicable to all industries within the scope of the Federal power.\r\nI hope that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speedily as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe National Government has as a rule but little occasion to deal\r\nwith the formidable group of problems connected more or less directly\r\nwith what is known as the labor question, for in the great majority\r\nof cases these problems must be dealt with by the State and municipal\r\nauthorities and not by the National Government. The National\r\nGovernment has control of the District of Columbia, however, and it\r\nshould see to it that the City of Washington is made a model city\r\nin all respects, both as regards parks, public playgrounds, proper\r\nregulation of the system of housing so as to do away with the evils\r\nof alley tenements, a proper system of education, a proper system\r\nof dealing with truancy and juvenile offenders, a proper handling\r\nof the charitable work of the District. Moreover, there should be\r\nproper factory laws to prevent all abuses in the employment of women\r\nand children in the District. These will be useful chiefly as object\r\nlessons, but even this limited amount of usefulness would be of real\r\nnational value.\r\n\r\nThere has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue\r\ninjunctions in labor disputes. Such special limitation of the equity\r\npowers of our courts would be most unwise. It is true that some judges\r\nhave misused this power; but this does not justify a denial of the\r\npower any more than an improper exercise of the power to call a strike\r\nby a labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The\r\nremedy is to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give due\r\nnotice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing\r\nto be _ex parte_ if the adverse party does not appear at the time and\r\nplace ordered. What is due notice must depend upon the facts of the\r\ncase: it should not be used as a pretext to permit violation of the\r\nlaw, or the jeopardizing of life or property. Of course, this would\r\nnot authorize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any\r\ncase in which it is not already authorized by existing law.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation I made in my last annual Message for an\r\ninvestigation by the Department of Commerce and Labor of general\r\nlabor conditions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions\r\nof child labor and child-labor legislation in the several States.\r\nSuch an investigation should take into account the various problems\r\nwith which the question of child labor is connected. It is true that\r\nthese problems can be actually met in most cases only by the States\r\nthemselves, but it would be well for the Nation to endeavor to secure\r\nand publish comprehensive information as to the conditions of the labor\r\nof children in the different States, so as to spur up those that are\r\nbehindhand, and to secure approximately uniform legislation of a high\r\ncharacter among the several States. In such a Republic as ours the one\r\nthing that we can not afford to neglect is the problem of turning out\r\ndecent citizens. The future of the Nation depends upon the citizenship\r\nof the generations to come; the children of to-day are those who\r\nto-morrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we can not afford\r\nto neglect them. The Legislature of Colorado has recommended that the\r\nNational Government provide some general measure for the protection\r\nfrom abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States.\r\nI lay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Commerce and Labor should also make a thorough\r\ninvestigation of the conditions of women in industry. Over five million\r\nAmerican women are now engaged in gainful occupations; yet there is\r\nan almost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trustworthy\r\nconclusions as regards a subject as important as it is vast and\r\ncomplicated. There is need of full knowledge on which to base action\r\nlooking toward State and municipal legislation for the protection of\r\nworking women. The introduction of women into industry is working\r\nchange and disturbance in the domestic and social life of the Nation.\r\nThe decrease in marriage, and especially in the birth rate, has been\r\ncoincident with it. We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment\r\nto factory conditions must be made; but surely it can be made with less\r\nfriction and less harmful effects on family life than is now the case.\r\nThis whole matter in reality forms one of the greatest sociological\r\nphenomena of our time; it is a social question of the first importance,\r\nof far greater importance than any merely political or economic\r\nquestion can be; and to solve it we need ample data, gathered in a sane\r\nand scientific spirit in the course of an exhaustive investigation.\r\n\r\nIn any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employee\r\ninterested, but also a third party—the general public. Every\r\nconsiderable labor difficulty in which interstate commerce is involved\r\nshould be investigated by the Government and the facts officially\r\nreported to the public.\r\n\r\nThe question of securing a healthy, self-respecting, and mutually\r\nsympathetic attitude as between employer and employee, capitalist\r\nand wage-worker, is a difficult one. All phases of the labor problem\r\nprove difficult when approached. But the underlying principles, the\r\nroot principles, in accordance with which the problem must be solved\r\nare entirely simple. We can get justice and right dealing only if we\r\nput as of paramount importance the principle of treating a man on his\r\nworth as a man rather than with reference to his social position,\r\nhis occupation, or the class to which he belongs. There are selfish\r\nand brutal men in all ranks of life. If they are capitalists their\r\nselfishness and brutality may take the form of hard indifference to\r\nsuffering, greedy disregard of every moral restraint which interferes\r\nwith the accumulation of wealth, and cold-blooded exploitation of the\r\nweak; or, if they are laborers, the form of laziness, of sullen envy of\r\nthe more fortunate, and of willingness to perform deeds of murderous\r\nviolence. Such conduct is just as reprehensible in one case as in\r\nthe other, and all honest and far-seeing men should join in warring\r\nagainst it wherever it becomes manifest. Individual capitalist and\r\nindividual wage-worker, corporation and union, are alike entitled to\r\nthe protection of the law, and must alike obey the law. Moreover, in\r\naddition to mere obedience to the law, each man, if he be really a\r\ngood citizen, must show broad sympathy for his neighbor and genuine\r\ndesire to look at any question arising between them from the standpoint\r\nof that neighbor no less than from his own; and to this end it is\r\nessential that capitalist and wage-worker should consult freely one\r\nwith the other, should each strive to bring closer the day when both\r\nshall realize that they are properly partners and not enemies. To\r\napproach the questions which inevitably arise between them solely from\r\nthe standpoint which treats each side in the mass as the enemy of the\r\nother side in the mass is both wicked and foolish. In the past the most\r\ndireful among the influences which have brought about the downfall of\r\nrepublics has ever been the growth of the class spirit, the growth of\r\nthe spirit which tends to make a man subordinate the welfare of the\r\npublic as a whole to the welfare of the particular class to which he\r\nbelongs, the substitution of loyalty to a class for loyalty to the\r\nNation. This inevitably brings about a tendency to treat each man not\r\non his merits as an individual, but on his position as belonging to\r\na certain class in the community. If such a spirit grows up in this\r\nRepublic it will ultimately prove fatal to us, as in the past it has\r\nproved fatal to every community in which it has become dominant. Unless\r\nwe continue to keep a quick and lively sense of the great fundamental\r\ntruth that our concern is with the individual worth of the individual\r\nman, this Government can not permanently hold the place which it has\r\nachieved among the nations. The vital lines of cleavage among our\r\npeople do not correspond, and indeed run at right angles, to the lines\r\nof cleavage which divide occupation from occupation, which divide\r\nwage-workers from capitalists, farmers from bankers, men of small means\r\nfrom men of large means, men who live in the towns from men who live in\r\nthe country; for the vital line of cleavage is the line which divides\r\nthe honest man who tries to do well by his neighbor from the dishonest\r\nman who does ill by his neighbor. In other words, the standard we\r\nshould establish is the standard of conduct, not the standard of\r\noccupation, of means, or of social position. It is the man’s moral\r\nquality, his attitude toward the great questions which concern all\r\nhumanity, his cleanliness of life, his power to do his duty toward\r\nhimself and toward others, which really count; and if we substitute for\r\nthe standard of personal judgment which treats each man according to\r\nhis merits, another standard in accordance with which all men of one\r\nclass are favored and all men of another class discriminated against,\r\nwe shall do irreparable damage to the body politic. I believe that our\r\npeople are too sane, too self-respecting, too fit for self-government,\r\never to adopt such an attitude. This Government is not and never shall\r\nbe government by a plutocracy. This Government is not and never shall\r\nbe government by a mob. It shall continue to be in the future what it\r\nhas been in the past, a government based on the theory that each man,\r\nrich or poor, is to be treated simply and solely on his worth as a man,\r\nthat all his personal and property rights are to be safeguarded, and\r\nthat he is neither to wrong others nor to suffer wrong from others.\r\n\r\nThe noblest of all forms of government is self-government; but it is\r\nalso the most difficult. We who possess this priceless boon, and who\r\ndesire to hand it on to our children and our children’s children,\r\nshould ever bear in mind the thought so finely expressed by Burke:\r\n“Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their\r\ndisposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites; in proportion\r\nas they are disposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good\r\nin preference to the flattery of knaves. Society can not exist unless\r\na controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and\r\nthe less of it there be within the more there must be without. It is\r\nordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate\r\nminds can not be free. Their passions forge their fetters.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great insurance companies afford striking examples of corporations\r\nwhose business has extended so far beyond the jurisdiction of the\r\nStates which created them as to preclude strict enforcement of\r\nsupervision and regulation by the parent States. In my last annual\r\nMessage I recommended “that the Congress carefully consider whether\r\nthe power of the Bureau of Corporations can not constitutionally be\r\nextended to cover interstate transactions in insurance.” Recent events\r\nhave emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration\r\nof this question, to see whether it is not possible to furnish better\r\nsafeguards than the several States have been able to furnish against\r\ncorruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. It has been\r\nonly too clearly shown that certain of the men at the head of these\r\nlarge corporations take but small note of the ethical distinction\r\nbetween honesty and dishonesty; they draw the line only this side of\r\nwhat may be called law-honesty, the kind of honesty necessary in order\r\nto avoid falling into the clutches of the law. Of course the only\r\ncomplete remedy for this condition must be found in an aroused public\r\nconscience, a higher sense of ethical conduct in the community at\r\nlarge, and especially among business men and in the great profession of\r\nthe law, and in the growth of a spirit which condemns all dishonesty,\r\nwhether in rich man or in poor man, whether it takes the shape of\r\nbribery or of blackmail. But much can be done by legislation which\r\nis not only drastic but practical. There is need of a far stricter\r\nand more uniform regulation of the vast insurance interests of this\r\ncountry. The United States should in this respect follow the policy of\r\nother nations by providing adequate national supervision of commercial\r\ninterests which are clearly national in character. My predecessors have\r\nrepeatedly recognized that the foreign business of these companies\r\nis an important part of our foreign commercial relations. During the\r\nAdministrations of Presidents Cleveland, Harrison, and McKinley the\r\nState Department exercised its influence, through diplomatic channels,\r\nto prevent unjust discrimination by foreign countries against American\r\ninsurance companies. These negotiations illustrated the propriety of\r\nthe Congress recognizing the national character of insurance, for in\r\nthe absence of Federal legislation the State Department could only give\r\nexpression to the wishes of the authorities of the several States,\r\nwhose policy was ineffective through want of uniformity.\r\n\r\nI repeat my previous recommendation that the Congress should also\r\nconsider whether the Federal Government has any power or owes any duty\r\nwith respect to domestic transactions in insurance of an interstate\r\ncharacter. That State supervision has proved inadequate is generally\r\nconceded. The burden upon insurance companies, and therefore their\r\npolicy-holders, of conflicting regulations of many States, is\r\nunquestioned, while but little effective check is imposed upon any able\r\nand unscrupulous man who desires to exploit the company in his own\r\ninterest at the expense of the policy-holders and of the public. The\r\ninability of a State to regulate effectively insurance corporations\r\ncreated under the laws of other States and transacting the larger part\r\nof their business elsewhere is also clear. As a remedy for this evil\r\nof conflicting, ineffective, and yet burdensome regulations there has\r\nbeen for many years a widespread demand for Federal supervision. The\r\nCongress has already recognized that interstate insurance may be a\r\nproper subject for Federal legislation, for in creating the Bureau of\r\nCorporations it authorized it to publish and supply useful information\r\nconcerning interstate corporations, “including corporations engaged in\r\ninsurance.” It is obvious that if the compilation of statistics be the\r\nlimit of the Federal power, it is wholly ineffective to regulate this\r\nform of commercial intercourse between the States, and as the insurance\r\nbusiness has outgrown in magnitude the possibility of adequate State\r\nsupervision, the Congress should carefully consider whether further\r\nlegislation can be had. What is said above applies with equal force\r\nto fraternal and benevolent organizations which contract for life\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal\r\nperfection in the methods of raising revenue; and the shock and strain\r\nto the business world certain to attend any serious change in these\r\nmethods render such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is\r\nnot possible to lay down any general rule by which to determine the\r\nmoment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a\r\nchange. Much must depend, not merely on the needs, but on the desires,\r\nof the people as a whole; for needs and desires are not necessarily\r\nidentical. Of course no change can be made on lines beneficial to, or\r\ndesired by, one section or one State only. There must be something\r\nlike a general agreement among the citizens of the several States, as\r\nrepresented in the Congress, that the change is needed and desired\r\nin the interest of the people as a whole; and there should then be a\r\nsincere, intelligent, and disinterested effort to make it in such\r\nshape as will combine, so far as possible, the maximum of good to the\r\npeople at large with the minimum of necessary disregard for the special\r\ninterests of localities or classes. But in time of peace the revenue\r\nmust on the average, taking a series of years together, equal the\r\nexpenditures, or else the revenues must be increased. Last year there\r\nwas a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues\r\nthen our revenue laws must be readjusted. It is as yet too early to\r\nattempt to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for it\r\nis as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It should\r\nbe considered whether it is not desirable that the tariff laws should\r\nprovide for applying as against or in favor of any other nation maximum\r\nand minimum tariff rates established by the Congress, so as to secure a\r\ncertain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves.\r\nHaving in view even larger considerations of policy than those of a\r\npurely economic nature, it would, in my judgment, be well to endeavor\r\nto bring about closer commercial connections with the other peoples of\r\nthis continent. I am happy to be able to announce to you that Russia\r\nnow treats us on the most-favored-nation basis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend to the Congress the need of economy and to this\r\nend of a rigid scrutiny of appropriations. As examples merely, I\r\ncall your attention to one or two specific matters. All unnecessary\r\noffices should be abolished. The Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice recommends the abolishment of the office of receiver of public\r\nmoneys for United States land offices. This will effect a saving of\r\nabout a quarter of a million dollars a year. As the business of the\r\nNation grows it is inevitable that there should be from time to time a\r\nlegitimate increase in the number of officials, and this fact renders\r\nit all the more important that when offices become unnecessary they\r\nshould be abolished. In the public printing also a large saving of\r\npublic money can be made. There is a constantly growing tendency to\r\npublish masses of unimportant information. It is probably not unfair to\r\nsay that many tens of thousands of volumes are published at which no\r\nhuman being ever looks and for which there is no real demand whatever.\r\n\r\nYet, in speaking of economy, I must in no wise be understood\r\nas advocating the false economy which is in the end the worst\r\nextravagance. To cut down on the Navy, for instance, would be a crime\r\nagainst the Nation. To fail to push forward all work on the Panama\r\nCanal would be as great a folly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my Message of December 2, 1902, to the Congress I said:\r\n\r\n“Interest rates are a potent factor in business activity, and in\r\norder that these rates may be equalized to meet the varying needs\r\nof the seasons and of widely separated communities, and to prevent\r\nthe recurrence of financial stringencies which injuriously affect\r\nlegitimate business, it is necessary that there should be an element\r\nof elasticity in our monetary system. Banks are the natural servants\r\nof commerce, and upon them should be placed, as far as practicable,\r\nthe burden of furnishing and maintaining a circulation adequate to\r\nsupply the needs of our diversified industries and of our domestic and\r\nforeign commerce; and the issue of this should be so regulated that a\r\nsufficient supply should be always available for the business interests\r\nof the country.”\r\n\r\nEvery consideration of prudence demands the addition of the element\r\nof elasticity to our currency system. The evil does not consist in an\r\ninadequate volume of money, but in the rigidity of this volume, which\r\ndoes not respond as it should to the varying needs of communities and\r\nof seasons. Inflation must be avoided; but some provision should be\r\nmade that will ensure a larger volume of money during the fall and\r\nwinter months than in the less active seasons of the year; so that\r\nthe currency will contract against speculation, and will expand for\r\nthe needs of legitimate business. At present the Treasury Department\r\nis at irregularly recurring intervals obliged, in the interest of the\r\nbusiness world—that is, in the interest of the American public—to\r\ntry to avert financial crises by providing a remedy which should be\r\nprovided by Congressional action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt various times I have instituted investigations into the organization\r\nand conduct of the business of the Executive Departments. While none\r\nof these inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant final\r\nconclusions, they have already confirmed and emphasized the general\r\nimpression that the organization of the Departments is often faulty\r\nin principle and wasteful in results, while many of their business\r\nmethods are antiquated and inefficient. There is every reason why our\r\nexecutive governmental machinery should be at least as well planned,\r\neconomical, and efficient as the best machinery of the great business\r\norganizations, which at present is not the case. To make it so is\r\na task of complex detail and essentially executive in its nature;\r\nprobably no legislative body, no matter how wise and able, could\r\nundertake it with reasonable prospect of success. I recommend that the\r\nCongress consider this subject with a view to provide by legislation\r\nfor the transfer, distribution, consolidation, and assignment of duties\r\nand executive organizations or parts of organizations, and for the\r\nchanges in business methods, within or between the several Departments,\r\nthat will best promote the economy, efficiency, and high character of\r\nthe Government work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my last annual Message I said:\r\n\r\n“The power of the Government to protect the integrity of the elections\r\nof its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed\r\nby repeated declarations of the Supreme Court. There is no enemy of\r\nfree government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption\r\nof the electorate. No one defends or excuses corruption, and it would\r\nseem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measures to eradicate\r\nit. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and\r\ncorruption in Federal elections. The details of such a law may be\r\nsafely left to the wise discretion of the Congress, but it should go\r\nas far as under the Constitution it is possible to go, and should\r\ninclude severe penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe\r\nintended to influence his act or opinion as an elector; and provisions\r\nfor the publication not only of the expenditures for nominations and\r\nelections of all candidates, but also of all contributions received and\r\nexpenditures made by political committees.”\r\n\r\nI desire to repeat this recommendation. In political campaigns in a\r\ncountry as large and populous as ours it is inevitable that there\r\nshould be much expense of an entirely legitimate kind. This, of course,\r\nmeans that many contributions, and some of them of large size, must\r\nbe made, and, as a matter of fact, in any big political contest such\r\ncontributions are always made to both sides. It is entirely proper\r\nboth to give and receive them, unless there is an improper motive\r\nconnected with either gift or reception. If they are extorted by any\r\nkind of pressure or promise, express or implied, direct or indirect,\r\nin the way of favor or immunity, then the giving or receiving becomes\r\nnot only improper but criminal. It will undoubtedly be difficult as\r\na matter of practical detail to shape an act which shall guard with\r\nreasonable certainty against such misconduct; but if it is possible\r\nto secure by law the full and verified publication in detail of all\r\nthe sums contributed to and expended by the candidates or committees\r\nof any political parties the result can not but be wholesome. All\r\ncontributions by corporations to any political committee or for any\r\npolitical purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be\r\npermitted to use stockholders’ money for such purposes; and, moreover,\r\na prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective\r\nmethod of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts. Not\r\nonly should both the National and the several State legislatures forbid\r\nany officer of a corporation from using the money of the corporation in\r\nor about any election, but they should also forbid such use of money in\r\nconnection with any legislation save by the employment of counsel in\r\npublic manner for distinctly legal services.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first Conference of Nations held at The Hague in 1899, being unable\r\nto dispose of all the business before it, recommended the consideration\r\nand settlement of a number of important questions by another conference\r\nto be called subsequently and at an early date. These questions\r\nwere the following: (1) The rights and duties of neutrals; (2) the\r\nlimitation of the armed forces on land and sea, and of military\r\nbudgets; (3) the use of new types and calibres of military and naval\r\nguns: (4) the inviolability of private property at sea in times of war;\r\n(5) the bombardment of ports, cities, and villages by naval forces. In\r\nOctober, 1904, at the instance of the Interparliamentary Union, which,\r\nat a conference held in the United States and attended by the lawmakers\r\nof fifteen different nations, had reiterated the demand for a second\r\nConference of Nations, I issued invitations to all the Powers signatory\r\nto The Hague Convention to send delegates to such a conference\r\nand suggested that it be again held at The Hague. In its note of\r\nDecember 16, 1904, the United States Government communicated to the\r\nrepresentatives of foreign governments its belief that the conference\r\ncould be best arranged under the provisions of the present Hague treaty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom all the Powers acceptance was received, coupled in some cases\r\nwith the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then\r\nwaging between Russia and Japan. The Emperor of Russia, immediately\r\nafter the treaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, in a\r\nnote presented to the President on September 13, through Ambassador\r\nRosen, took the initiative in recommending that the conference be now\r\ncalled. The United States Government in response expressed its cordial\r\nacquiescence and stated that it would, as a matter of course, take\r\npart in the new conference and endeavor to further its aims. We assume\r\nthat all civilized governments will support the movement, and that the\r\nconference is now an assured fact. This Government will do everything\r\nin its power to secure the success of the conference to the end that\r\nsubstantial progress may be made in the cause of international peace,\r\njustice, and good-will.\r\n\r\nThis renders it proper at this time to say something as to the general\r\nattitude of this Government toward peace. More and more war is coming\r\nto be looked upon as in itself a lamentable and evil thing. A wanton\r\nor useless war, or a war of mere aggression—in short, any war begun\r\nor carried on in a conscienceless spirit—is to be condemned as a\r\npeculiarly atrocious crime against all humanity. We can, however, do\r\nnothing of permanent value for peace unless we keep ever clearly in\r\nmind the ethical element which lies at the root of the problem. Our aim\r\nis righteousness. Peace is normally the handmaiden of righteousness;\r\nbut when peace and righteousness conflict then a great and upright\r\npeople can never for a moment hesitate to follow the path which leads\r\ntoward righteousness, even though that path also leads to war. There\r\nare persons who advocate peace at any price; there are others who,\r\nfollowing a false analogy, think that because it is no longer necessary\r\nin civilized countries for individuals to protect their rights with a\r\nstrong hand, it is therefore unnecessary for nations to be ready to\r\ndefend their rights. These persons would do irreparable harm to any\r\nnation that adopted their principles, and even as it is they seriously\r\nhamper the cause which they advocate by tending to render it absurd\r\nin the eyes of sensible and patriotic men. There can be no worse foe\r\nof mankind in general, and of his own country in particular, than\r\nthe demagogue of war, the man who in mere folly or to serve his own\r\nselfish ends continually rails at and abuses other nations, who seeks\r\nto excite his countrymen against foreigners on insufficient pretexts,\r\nwho excites and inflames a perverse and aggressive national vanity,\r\nand who may on occasions wantonly bring on conflict between his nation\r\nand some other nation. But there are demagogues of peace just as there\r\nare demagogues of war, and in any such movement as this for The Hague\r\nconference it is essential not to be misled by one set of extremists\r\nany more than by the other. Whenever it is possible for a nation or an\r\nindividual to work for real peace, assuredly it is failure of duty not\r\nso to strive; but if war is necessary and righteous, then either the\r\nman or the nation shrinking from it forfeits all title to self-respect.\r\nWe have scant sympathy with the sentimentalist who dreads oppression\r\nless than physical suffering, who would prefer a shameful peace to\r\nthe pain and toil sometimes lamentably necessary in order to secure a\r\nrighteous peace. As yet there is only a partial and imperfect analogy\r\nbetween international law and internal or municipal law, because there\r\nis no sanction of force for executing the former, while there is in the\r\ncase of the latter. The private citizen is protected in his rights by\r\nthe law, because the law rests in the last resort upon force exercised\r\nthrough the forms of law. A man does not have to defend his rights with\r\nhis own hand, because he can call upon the police, upon the sheriff’s\r\nposse, upon the militia, or in certain extreme cases upon the Army, to\r\ndefend him. But there is no such sanction of force for international\r\nlaw. At present there could be no greater calamity than for the free\r\npeoples, the enlightened, independent, and peace-loving peoples, to\r\ndisarm while yet leaving it open to any barbarism or despotism to\r\nremain armed. So long as the world is as unorganized as now, the armies\r\nand navies of those peoples who on the whole stand for justice offer\r\nnot only the best, but the only possible, security for a just peace.\r\nFor instance, if the United States alone, or in company only with\r\nthe other nations that on the whole tend to act justly, disarmed, we\r\nmight sometimes avoid bloodshed, but we would cease to be of weight\r\nin securing the peace of justice—the real peace for which the most\r\nlaw-abiding and high-minded men must at times be willing to fight. As\r\nthe world is now, only that nation is equipped for peace that knows how\r\nto fight and that will not shrink from fighting if ever the conditions\r\nbecome such that war is demanded in the name of the highest morality.\r\n\r\nSo much it is emphatically necessary to say in order both that the\r\nposition of the United States may not be misunderstood, and that\r\na genuine effort to bring nearer the day of the peace of justice\r\namong the nations may not be hampered by a folly which, in striving\r\nto achieve the impossible, would render it hopeless to attempt the\r\nachievement of the practical. But while recognizing most clearly\r\nall above set forth, it remains our clear duty to strive in every\r\npracticable way to bring nearer the time when the sword shall not be\r\nthe arbiter among nations. At present the practical thing to do is to\r\ntry to minimize the number of cases in which it must be the arbiter,\r\nand to offer, at least to all civilized powers, some substitute for\r\nwar which will be available in at least a considerable number of\r\ninstances. Very much can be done through another Hague conference in\r\nthis direction, and I most earnestly urge that this Nation do all in\r\nits power to try to further the movement and to make the result of the\r\ndecisions of The Hague conference effective. I earnestly hope that the\r\nconference may be able to devise some way to make arbitration between\r\nnations the customary way of settling international disputes in all\r\nsave a few classes of cases, which should themselves be as sharply\r\ndefined and rigidly limited as the present governmental and social\r\ndevelopment of the world will permit. If possible, there should be a\r\ngeneral arbitration treaty negotiated among all the nations represented\r\nat the conference. Neutral rights and property should be protected at\r\nsea as they are protected on land. There should be an international\r\nagreement to this purpose and a similar agreement defining contraband\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century there has been a distinct diminution in the\r\nnumber of wars between the most civilized nations. International\r\nrelations have become closer, and the development of The Hague tribunal\r\nis not only a symptom of this growing closeness of relationship, but is\r\na means by which the growth can be furthered. Our aim should be from\r\ntime to time to take such steps as may be possible toward creating\r\nsomething like an organization of the civilized nations, because as\r\nthe world becomes more highly organized the need for navies and armies\r\nwill diminish. It is not possible to secure anything like an immediate\r\ndisarmament, because it would first be necessary to settle what peoples\r\nare on the whole a menace to the rest of mankind, and to provide\r\nagainst the disarmament of the rest being turned into a movement which\r\nwould really chiefly benefit these obnoxious peoples; but it may be\r\npossible to exercise some check upon the tendency to swell indefinitely\r\nthe budgets for military expenditure. Of course, such an effort could\r\nsucceed only if it did not attempt to do too much; and if it were\r\nundertaken in a spirit of sanity as far removed as possible from a\r\nmerely hysterical pseudo-philanthropy. It is worth while pointing out\r\nthat since the end of the insurrection in the Philippines this Nation\r\nhas shown its practical faith in the policy of disarmament by reducing\r\nits little army one-third. But disarmament can never be of prime\r\nimportance; there is more need to get rid of the causes of war than of\r\nthe implements of war.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt much on the dangers to be avoided by steering clear of any\r\nmere foolish sentimentality because my wish for peace is so genuine and\r\nearnest; because I have a real and great desire that this second Hague\r\nconference may mark a long stride forward in the direction of securing\r\nthe peace of justice throughout the world. No object is better worthy\r\nthe attention of enlightened statesmanship than the establishment of a\r\nsurer method than now exists of securing justice as between nations,\r\nboth for the protection of the little nations and for the prevention\r\nof war between the big nations. To this aim we should endeavor not\r\nonly to avert bloodshed, but, above all, effectively to strengthen the\r\nforces of right. The Golden Rule should be, and as the world grows in\r\nmorality it will be, the guiding rule of conduct among nations as among\r\nindividuals; though the Golden Rule must not be construed, in fantastic\r\nmanner, as forbidding the exercise of the police power. This mighty and\r\nfree Republic should ever deal with all other states, great or small,\r\non a basis of high honor, respecting their rights as jealously as it\r\nsafeguards its own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most effective instruments for peace is the Monroe Doctrine\r\nas it has been and is being gradually developed by this Nation and\r\naccepted by other nations. No other policy could have been as efficient\r\nin promoting peace in the Western Hemisphere and in giving to each\r\nnation thereon the chance to develop along its own lines. If we had\r\nrefused to apply the Doctrine to changing conditions it would now be\r\ncompletely outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present\r\nday, and indeed would probably by this time have sunk into complete\r\noblivion. It is useful at home, and is meeting with recognition abroad\r\nbecause we have adapted our application of it to meet the growing and\r\nchanging needs of the Hemisphere. When we announce a policy, such as\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine, we thereby commit ourselves to the consequences of\r\nthe policy, and those consequences from time to time alter. It is out\r\nof the question to claim a right and yet shirk the responsibility for\r\nits exercise. Not only we, but all American Republics who are benefited\r\nby the existence of the Doctrine, must recognize the obligations each\r\nnation is under as regards foreign peoples no less than its duty to\r\ninsist upon its own rights.\r\n\r\nThat our rights and interests are deeply concerned in the maintenance\r\nof the Doctrine is so clear as hardly to need argument. This is\r\nespecially true in view of the construction of the Panama Canal. As a\r\nmere matter of self-defence we must exercise a close watch over the\r\napproaches to this canal; and this means that we must be thoroughly\r\nalive to our interests in the Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nThere are certain essential points which must never be forgotten\r\nas regards the Monroe Doctrine. In the first place, we must as a\r\nnation make it evident that we do not intend to treat it in any shape\r\nor way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the expense\r\nof the republics to the south. We must recognize the fact that in\r\nsome South American countries there has been much suspicion lest we\r\nshould interpret the Monroe Doctrine as in some way inimical to their\r\ninterests, and we must try to convince all the other nations of this\r\ncontinent once and for all that no just and orderly government has\r\nanything to fear from us. There are certain republics to the south of\r\nus which have already reached such a point of stability, order, and\r\nprosperity that they themselves, though as yet hardly consciously, are\r\namong the guarantors of this Doctrine. These republics we now meet\r\nnot only on a basis of entire equality, but in a spirit of frank and\r\nrespectful friendship, which we hope is mutual. If all the republics to\r\nthe south of us will only grow as those to which I allude have already\r\ngrown, all need for us to be the especial champions of the Doctrine\r\nwill disappear, for no stable and growing American Republic wishes to\r\nsee some great non-American military power acquire territory in its\r\nneighborhood. All that this country desires is that the other republics\r\non this Continent shall be happy and prosperous; and they can not be\r\nhappy and prosperous unless they maintain order within their boundaries\r\nand behave with a just regard for their obligations toward outsiders.\r\nIt must be understood that under no circumstances will the United\r\nStates use the Monroe Doctrine as a cloak for territorial aggression.\r\nWe desire peace with all the world, but perhaps most of all with the\r\nother peoples of the American Continent. There are of course limits to\r\nthe wrongs which any self-respecting nation can endure. It is always\r\npossible that wrong actions toward this Nation, or toward citizens of\r\nthis Nation, in some state unable to keep order among its own people,\r\nunable to secure justice from outsiders, and unwilling to do justice to\r\nthose outsiders who treat it well, may result in our having to take\r\naction to protect our rights; but such action will not be taken with a\r\nview to territorial aggression, and it will be taken at all only with\r\nextreme reluctance and when it has become evident that every other\r\nresource has been exhausted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we must make it evident that we do not intend to permit\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine to be used by any nation on this Continent as a\r\nshield to protect it from the consequences of its own misdeeds against\r\nforeign nations. If a republic to the south of us commits a tort\r\nagainst a foreign nation, such as an outrage against a citizen of that\r\nnation, then the Monroe Doctrine does not force us to interfere to\r\nprevent punishment of the tort, save to see that the punishment does\r\nnot assume the form of territorial occupation in any shape. The case\r\nis more difficult when it refers to a contractual obligation. Our own\r\nGovernment has always refused to enforce such contractual obligations\r\non behalf of its citizens by an appeal to arms. It is much to be wished\r\nthat all foreign governments would take the same view. But they do not;\r\nand in consequence we are liable at any time to be brought face to face\r\nwith disagreeable alternatives. On the one hand, this country would\r\ncertainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from\r\ncollecting a just debt; on the other hand, it is very inadvisable to\r\npermit any foreign power to take possession, even temporarily, of the\r\ncustom-houses of an American Republic in order to enforce the payment\r\nof its obligations; for such temporary occupation might turn into\r\na permanent occupation. The only escape from these alternatives may\r\nat any time be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about some\r\narrangement by which so much as possible of a just obligation shall be\r\npaid. It is far better that this country should put through such an\r\narrangement, rather than allow any foreign country to undertake it. To\r\ndo so ensures the defaulting republic from having to pay debts of an\r\nimproper character under duress, while it also ensures honest creditors\r\nof the republic from being passed by in the interest of dishonest or\r\ngrasping creditors. Moreover, for the United States to take such a\r\nposition offers the only possible way of ensuring us against a clash\r\nwith some foreign power. The position is, therefore, in the interest\r\nof peace as well as in the interest of justice. It is of benefit to\r\nour people; it is of benefit to foreign peoples; and most of all it is\r\nreally of benefit to the people of the country concerned.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to what should be one of the fundamental objects of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine. We must ourselves in good faith try to help upward\r\ntoward peace and order those of our sister republics which need such\r\nhelp. Just as there has been a gradual growth of the ethical element\r\nin the relations of one individual to another, so we are, even though\r\nslowly, more and more coming to recognize the duty of bearing one\r\nanother’s burdens, not only as among individuals, but also as among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo, in her turn, has now made an appeal to us to help her,\r\nand not only every principle of wisdom but every generous instinct\r\nwithin us bids us respond to the appeal. It is not of the slightest\r\nconsequence whether we grant the aid needed by Santo Domingo as an\r\nincident to the wise development of the Monroe Doctrine, or because\r\nwe regard the case of Santo Domingo as standing wholly by itself,\r\nand to be treated as such, and not on general principles or with any\r\nreference to the Monroe Doctrine. The important point is to give the\r\nneeded aid, and the case is certainly sufficiently peculiar to deserve\r\nto be judged purely on its own merits. The conditions in Santo Domingo\r\nhave for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago\r\nall society was on the verge of dissolution. Fortunately, just at this\r\ntime a ruler sprang up in Santo Domingo, who, with his colleagues, saw\r\nthe dangers threatening their country and appealed to the friendship\r\nof the only great and powerful neighbor who possessed the power and,\r\nas they hoped, also the will to help them. There was imminent danger\r\nof foreign intervention. The previous rulers of Santo Domingo had\r\nrecklessly incurred debts, and owing to her internal disorders she had\r\nceased to be able to provide means of paying the debts. The patience of\r\nher foreign creditors had become exhausted, and at least two foreign\r\nnations were on the point of intervention, and were only prevented from\r\nintervening by the unofficial assurance of this Government that it\r\nwould itself strive to help Santo Domingo in her hour of need. In the\r\ncase of one of these nations, only the actual opening of negotiations\r\nto this end by our Government prevented the seizure of territory in\r\nSanto Domingo by a European power. Of the debts incurred some were\r\njust, while some were not of a character which really renders it\r\nobligatory on, or proper for, Santo Domingo to pay them in full. But\r\nshe could not pay any of them unless some stability was assured her\r\nGovernment and people.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Executive Department of our Government negotiated\r\na treaty under which we are to try to help the Dominican people to\r\nstraighten out their finances. This treaty is pending before the\r\nSenate. In the meantime a temporary arrangement has been made which\r\nwill last until the Senate has had time to take action upon the treaty.\r\nUnder this arrangement the Dominican Government has appointed Americans\r\nto all the important positions in the customs service, and they are\r\nseeing to the honest collection of the revenues, turning over 45 per\r\ncent to the Government for running expenses and putting the other 55\r\nper cent into a safe depositary for equitable division in case the\r\ntreaty shall be ratified, among the various creditors, whether European\r\nor American.\r\n\r\nThe custom-houses offer wellnigh the only sources of revenue in Santo\r\nDomingo, and the different revolutions usually have as their real aim\r\nthe obtaining possession of these custom-houses. The mere fact that the\r\ncollectors of customs are Americans, that they are performing their\r\nduties with efficiency and honesty, and that the treaty is pending in\r\nthe Senate, gives a certain moral power to the Government of Santo\r\nDomingo which it has not had before. This has completely discouraged\r\nall revolutionary movement, while it has already produced such an\r\nincrease in the revenues that the Government is actually getting more\r\nfrom the 45 per cent that the American collectors turn over to it than\r\nit got formerly when it took the entire revenue. It is enabling the\r\npoor harassed people of Santo Domingo once more to turn their attention\r\nto industry and to be free from the curse of interminable revolutionary\r\ndisturbance. It offers to all bonâ fide creditors, American and\r\nEuropean, the only really good chance to obtain that to which they are\r\njustly entitled, while it in return gives to Santo Domingo the only\r\nopportunity of defence against claims which it ought not to pay, for\r\nnow if it meets the views of the Senate we shall ourselves thoroughly\r\nexamine all these claims, whether American or foreign, and see that\r\nnone that are improper are paid. There is, of course, opposition to\r\nthe treaty from dishonest creditors, foreign and American, and from\r\nthe professional revolutionists of the island itself. We have already\r\nreason to believe that some of the creditors who do not dare expose\r\ntheir claims to honest scrutiny are endeavoring to stir up sedition\r\nin the island and opposition to the treaty. In the meantime I have\r\nexercised the authority vested in me by the joint resolution of the\r\nCongress to prevent the introduction of arms into the island for\r\nrevolutionary purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder the course taken, stability and order and all the benefits\r\nof peace are at last coming to Santo Domingo, danger of foreign\r\nintervention has been suspended, and there is at last a prospect\r\nthat all creditors will get justice, no more and no less. If the\r\narrangement is terminated by the failure of the treaty chaos will\r\nfollow; and if chaos follows, sooner or later this Government may be\r\ninvolved in serious difficulties with foreign governments over the\r\nisland, or else may be forced itself to intervene in the island in\r\nsome unpleasant fashion. Under the proposed treaty the independence\r\nof the island is scrupulously respected, the danger of violation of\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine by the intervention of foreign powers vanishes,\r\nand the interference of our Government is minimized, so that we shall\r\nonly act in conjunction with the Santo Domingo authorities to secure\r\nthe proper administration of the customs, and therefore to secure the\r\npayment of just debts and to secure the Dominican Government against\r\ndemands for unjust debts. The proposed method will give the people of\r\nSanto Domingo the same chance to move onward and upward which we have\r\nalready given to the people of Cuba. It will be doubly to our discredit\r\nas a nation if we fail to take advantage of this chance; for it will be\r\nof damage to ourselves, and it will be of incalculable damage to Santo\r\nDomingo. Every consideration of wise policy, and, above all, every\r\nconsideration of large generosity, bids us meet the request of Santo\r\nDomingo as we are now trying to meet it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe can not consider the question of our foreign policy without at the\r\nsame time treating of the Army and Navy. We now have a very small\r\narmy—indeed, one wellnigh infinitesimal when compared with the army\r\nof any other large nation. Of course the Army we do have should be as\r\nnearly perfect of its kind and for its size as is possible. I do not\r\nbelieve that any army in the world has a better average of enlisted\r\nman or a better type of junior officer; but the Army should be trained\r\nto act effectively in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient\r\nappropriations for manœuvres of a practical kind so that the troops may\r\nlearn how to take care of themselves under actual service conditions;\r\nevery march, for instance, being made with the soldier loaded exactly\r\nas he would be in an active campaign. The generals and colonels\r\nwould thereby have opportunity of handling regiments, brigades, and\r\ndivisions, and the commissary and medical departments would be tested\r\nin the field. Provision should be made for the exercise at least of\r\na brigade and by preference of a division in marching and embarking\r\nat some point on our coast and disembarking at some other point and\r\ncontinuing its march. The number of posts in which the Army is kept in\r\ntime of peace should be materially diminished and the posts that are\r\nleft made correspondingly larger. No local interests should be allowed\r\nto stand in the way of assembling the greater part of the troops which\r\nwould at need form our field armies in stations of such size as will\r\npermit the best training to be given to the personnel of all grades,\r\nincluding the high officers and staff officers. To accomplish this\r\nend we must have not company or regimental garrisons, but brigade and\r\ndivision garrisons. Promotion by mere seniority can never result in\r\na thoroughly efficient corps of officers in the higher ranks unless\r\nthere accompanies it a vigorous weeding-out process. Such a weeding-out\r\nprocess—that is, such a process of selection—is a chief feature of the\r\nfour years’ course of the young officer at West Point. There is no good\r\nreason why it should stop immediately upon his graduation. While at\r\nWest Point he is dropped unless he comes up to a certain standard of\r\nexcellence, and when he graduates he takes rank in the Army according\r\nto his rank of graduation. The results are good at West Point; and\r\nthere should be in the Army itself something that will achieve the same\r\nend. After a certain age has been reached the average officer is unfit\r\nto do good work below a certain grade. Provision should be made for\r\nthe promotion of exceptionally meritorious men over the heads of their\r\ncomrades and for the retirement of all men who have reached a given age\r\nwithout getting beyond a given rank; this age of retirement of course\r\nchanging from rank to rank. In both the Army and the Navy there should\r\nbe some principle of selection, that is, of promotion for merit, and\r\nthere should be a resolute effort to eliminate the aged officers of\r\nreputable character who possess no special efficiency.\r\n\r\nThere should be an increase in the coast artillery force, so that our\r\ncoast fortifications can be in some degree adequately manned. There\r\nis special need for an increase and reorganization of the Medical\r\nDepartment of the Army. In both the Army and Navy there must be the\r\nsame thorough training for duty in the staff corps as in the fighting\r\nline. Only by such training in advance can we be sure that in actual\r\nwar field operations and those at sea will be carried on successfully.\r\nThe importance of this was shown conclusively in the Spanish-American\r\nand the Russo-Japanese wars. The work of the medical departments in\r\nthe Japanese army and navy is especially worthy of study. I renew my\r\nrecommendation of January 9, 1905, as to the Medical Department of the\r\nArmy and call attention to the equal importance of the needs of the\r\nstaff corps of the Navy. In the Medical Department of the Navy the\r\nfirst in importance is the reorganization of the Hospital Corps, on\r\nthe lines of the Gallinger Bill (S. 3984, February 1, 1904), and the\r\nreapportionment of the different grades of the medical officers to meet\r\nservice requirements. It seems advisable also that medical officers of\r\nthe Army and Navy should have similar rank and pay in their respective\r\ngrades, so that their duties can be carried on without friction when\r\nthey are brought together. The base hospitals of the Navy should be\r\nput in condition to meet modern requirements and hospital ships be\r\nprovided. Unless we now provide with ample forethought for the medical\r\nneeds of the Army and Navy, appalling suffering of a preventable kind\r\nis sure to occur if ever the country goes to war. It is not reasonable\r\nto expect successful administration in time of war of a department\r\nwhich lacks a third of the number of officers necessary to perform\r\nthe medical service in time of peace. We need men who are not merely\r\ndoctors; they must be trained in the administration of military medical\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOur Navy must, relatively to the navies of other nations, always be of\r\ngreater size than our Army. We have most wisely continued for a number\r\nof years to build up our Navy, and it has now reached a fairly high\r\nstandard of efficiency. This standard of efficiency must not only be\r\nmaintained, but increased. It does not seem to me necessary, however,\r\nthat the Navy should—at least in the immediate future—be increased\r\nbeyond the present number of units. What is now clearly necessary is\r\nto substitute efficient for inefficient units as the latter become\r\nworn-out or as it becomes apparent that they are useless. Probably the\r\nresult would be attained by adding a single battleship to our Navy\r\neach year, the superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken\r\nup as they are thus replaced. The four single-turret monitors built\r\nimmediately after the close of the Spanish war, for instance, are\r\nvessels which would be of but little use in the event of war. The\r\nmoney spent upon them could have been more usefully spent in other\r\nways. Thus it would have been far better never to have built a single\r\none of these monitors and to have put the money into an ample supply of\r\nreserve guns. Most of the smaller cruisers and gunboats, though they\r\nserve a useful purpose so far as they are needed for international\r\npolice work, would not add to the strength of our Navy in a conflict\r\nwith a serious foe. There is urgent need of providing a large increase\r\nin the number of officers, and especially in the number of enlisted men.\r\n\r\nRecent naval history has emphasized certain lessons which ought\r\nnot to, but which do, need emphasis. Sea-going torpedo boats or\r\ndestroyers are indispensable, not only for making night attacks by\r\nsurprise upon an enemy, but even in battle for finishing already\r\ncrippled ships. Under exceptional circumstances submarine boats would\r\ndoubtless be of use. Fast scouts are needed. The main strength of\r\nthe Navy, however, lies and can only lie in the great battleships,\r\nthe heavily-armored, heavily-gunned vessels which decide the mastery\r\nof the seas. Heavy-armed cruisers also play a most useful part,\r\nand unarmed cruisers, if swift enough, are very useful as scouts.\r\nBetween antagonists of approximately equal prowess the comparative\r\nperfection of the instruments of war will ordinarily determine the\r\nfight. But it is of course true that the man behind the gun, the man\r\nin the engine room, and the man in the conning tower, considered not\r\nonly individually, but especially with regard to the way in which\r\nthey work together, are even more important than the weapons with\r\nwhich they work. The most formidable battleship is of course helpless\r\nagainst even a light cruiser if the men aboard it are unable to hit\r\nanything with their guns; and thoroughly well-handled cruisers may\r\ncount seriously in an engagement with much superior vessels if the men\r\naboard the latter are ineffective, whether from lack of training or\r\nfrom any other cause. Modern warships are most formidable mechanisms\r\nwhen well handled, but they are utterly useless when not well handled;\r\nand they can not be handled at all without long and careful training.\r\nThis training can under no circumstance be given when once war has\r\nbroken out. No fighting ship of the first class should ever be laid\r\nup save for necessary repairs; and her crew should be kept constantly\r\nexercised on the high seas, so that she may stand at the highest point\r\nof perfection. To put a new and untrained crew upon the most powerful\r\nbattleship and send it out to meet a formidable enemy is not only to\r\ninvite but to ensure disaster and disgrace. To improvise crews at the\r\noutbreak of a war, so far as the serious fighting craft are concerned,\r\nis absolutely hopeless. If the officers and men are not thoroughly\r\nskilled in, and have not been thoroughly trained to, their duties, it\r\nwould be far better to keep the ships in port during hostilities than\r\nto send them against a formidable opponent, for the result could only\r\nbe that they would be either sunk or captured. The marksmanship of\r\nour Navy is now on the whole in a gratifying condition, and there has\r\nbeen a great improvement in fleet practice. We need additional seamen;\r\nwe need a large store of reserve guns; we need sufficient money for\r\nample target practice, ample practice of every kind at sea. We should\r\nsubstitute for comparatively inefficient types—the old third-class\r\nbattleship “Texas,” the single-turreted monitors above mentioned,\r\nand indeed all the monitors and some of the old cruisers—efficient,\r\nmodern, sea-going vessels. Sea-going torpedo-boat destroyers should\r\nbe substituted for some of the smaller torpedo boats. During the\r\npresent Congress there need be no additions to the aggregate number\r\nof units of the Navy. Our Navy, though very small relatively to the\r\nnavies of other nations, is for the present sufficient in point of\r\nnumbers for our needs, and while we must constantly strive to make its\r\nefficiency higher, there need be no additions to the total number of\r\nships now built and building, save in the way of substitution as above\r\noutlined. I recommend the report of the Secretary of the Navy to the\r\ncareful consideration of the Congress, especially with a view to the\r\nlegislation therein advocated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the past year evidence has accumulated to confirm the\r\nexpressions contained in my last two annual Messages as to the\r\nimportance of revising by appropriate legislation our system of\r\nnaturalizing aliens. I appointed last March a commission to make\r\na careful examination of our naturalization laws, and to suggest\r\nappropriate measures to avoid the notorious abuses resulting from the\r\nimprovident or unlawful granting of citizenship. This commission,\r\ncomposed of an officer of the Department of State, of the Department of\r\nJustice, and of the Department of Commerce and Labor, has discharged\r\nthe duty imposed upon it, and has submitted a report, which will be\r\ntransmitted to the Congress for its consideration, and, I hope, for its\r\nfavorable action.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing recommendations of the Commission are:\r\n\r\nFirst. A Federal bureau of naturalization, to be established in the\r\nDepartment of Commerce and Labor, to supervise the administration of\r\nthe naturalization laws and to receive returns of naturalizations\r\npending and accomplished.\r\n\r\nSecond. Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged,\r\nand procedure.\r\n\r\nThird. More exacting qualifications for citizenship.\r\n\r\nFourth. The preliminary declaration of intention to be abolished and no\r\nalien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of\r\nhis petition.\r\n\r\nFifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to be confined to United\r\nStates district courts and to such State courts as have jurisdiction\r\nin civil actions in which the amount in controversy is unlimited; in\r\ncities of over 100,000 inhabitants the United States district courts\r\nto have exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alien\r\nresidents of such cities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my last Message I asked the attention of the Congress to the\r\nurgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective; and\r\nI most earnestly request that you pay heed to the report of the\r\nAttorney-General on this subject. Centuries ago it was especially\r\nneedful to throw every safeguard round the accused. The danger then was\r\nlest he should be wronged by the state. The danger is now exactly the\r\nreverse. Our laws and customs tell immensely in favor of the criminal\r\nand against the interests of the public he has wronged. Some antiquated\r\nand outworn rules, which once safeguarded the threatened rights of\r\nprivate citizens, now merely work harm to the general body politic. The\r\ncriminal law of the United States stands in urgent need of revision.\r\nThe criminal process of any court of the United States should run\r\nthroughout the entire territorial extent of our country. The delays of\r\nthe criminal law, no less than of the civil, now amount to a very great\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no statute of the United States which provides for\r\nthe punishment of a United States attorney or other officer of the\r\nGovernment who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain\r\nfrom doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement\r\nis other than one possessing money value. This ought to be remedied\r\nby appropriate legislation. Legislation should also be enacted to\r\ncover, explicitly, unequivocally, and beyond question, breach of\r\ntrust in the shape of prematurely divulging official secrets by an\r\nofficer or employee of the United States, and to provide a suitable\r\npenalty therefor. Such officer or employee owes the duty to the United\r\nStates to guard carefully and not to divulge or in any manner use,\r\nprematurely, information which is accessible to the officer or employee\r\nby reason of his official position. Most breaches of public trust are\r\nalready covered by the law, and this one should be. It is impossible,\r\nno matter how much care is used, to prevent the occasional appointment\r\nto the public service of a man who when tempted proves unfaithful;\r\nbut every means should be provided to detect and every effort made to\r\npunish the wrongdoer. So far as in my power lies each and every such\r\nwrongdoer shall be relentlessly hunted down; in no instance in the past\r\nhas he been spared; in no instance in the future shall he be spared.\r\nHis crime is a crime against every honest man in the Nation, for it\r\nis a crime against the whole body politic. Yet in dwelling on such\r\nmisdeeds, it is unjust not to add that they are altogether exceptional,\r\nand that on the whole the employees of the Government render upright\r\nand faithful service to the people. There are exceptions, notably in\r\none or two branches of the service; but at no time in the Nation’s\r\nhistory has the public service of the Nation taken as a whole stood\r\non a higher plane than now, alike as regards honesty and as regards\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce again I call your attention to the condition of the public-land\r\nlaws. Recent developments have given new urgency to the need for such\r\nchanges as will fit these laws to actual present conditions. The honest\r\ndisposal and right use of the remaining public lands is of fundamental\r\nimportance. The iniquitous methods by which the monopolizing of the\r\npublic lands is being brought about under the present laws are becoming\r\ngenerally known, but the existing laws do not furnish effective\r\nremedies. The recommendations of the Public Lands Commission upon this\r\nsubject are wise and should be given effect.\r\n\r\nThe creation of small irrigated farms under the Reclamation Act is a\r\npowerful offset to the tendency of certain other laws to foster or\r\npermit monopoly of the land. Under that act the construction of great\r\nirrigation works has been proceeding rapidly and successfully, the\r\nlands reclaimed are eagerly taken up, and the prospect that the policy\r\nof national irrigation will accomplish all that was expected of it is\r\nbright. The act should be extended to include the State of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Reclamation Act derives much of its value from the fact that it\r\ntends to secure the greatest possible number of homes on the land,\r\nand to create communities of freeholders, in part by settlement on\r\npublic lands, in part by forcing the subdivision of large private\r\nholdings before they can get water from Government irrigation works.\r\nThe law requires that no right to the use of water for land in private\r\nownership shall be sold for a tract exceeding 160 acres to any one land\r\nowner. This provision has excited active and powerful hostility, but\r\nthe success of the law itself depends on the wise and firm enforcement\r\nof it. We can not afford to substitute tenants for freeholders on the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the remaining public lands can not be irrigated.\r\nThey are at present and will probably always be of greater value for\r\ngrazing than for any other purpose. This fact has led to the grazing\r\nhomestead of 640 acres in Nebraska and to the proposed extension of it\r\nto other States. It is argued that a family can not be supported on\r\n160 acres of arid grazing land. This is obviously true; but neither\r\ncan a family be supported on 640 acres of much of the land to which it\r\nis proposed to apply the grazing homestead. To establish universally\r\nany such arbitrary limit would be unwise at the present time. It would\r\nprobably result on the one hand in enlarging the holdings of some of\r\nthe great land owners, and on the other in needless suffering and\r\nfailure on the part of a very considerable proportion of the bonâ fide\r\nsettlers who give faith to the implied assurance of the Government that\r\nsuch an area is sufficient. The best use of the public grazing lands\r\nrequires the careful examination and classification of these lands in\r\norder to give each settler land enough to support his family and no\r\nmore. While this work is being done, and until the lands are settled,\r\nthe Government should take control of the open range, under reasonable\r\nregulations suited to local needs, following the general policy already\r\nin successful operation on the forest reserves. It is probable that the\r\npresent grazing value of the open public range is scarcely more than\r\nhalf what it once was or what it might easily be again under careful\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe forest policy of the Administration appears to enjoy the unbroken\r\nsupport of the people. The great users of timber are themselves\r\nforwarding the movement for forest preservation. All organized\r\nopposition to the forest reserves in the West has disappeared. Since\r\nthe consolidation of all Government forest work in the National Forest\r\nService there has been a rapid and notable gain in the usefulness of\r\nthe forest reserves to the people and in public appreciation of their\r\nvalue. The national parks within or adjacent to forest reserves should\r\nbe transferred to the charge of the Forest Service also.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe National Government already does something in connection with the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of the great system of levees along the\r\nlower course of the Mississippi; in my judgment it should do much more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the spread of our trade in peace and the defence of our flag in war\r\na great and prosperous merchant marine is indispensable. We should\r\nhave ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to\r\nneutral markets, and in case of need to reinforce our battle line. It\r\ncan not but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines\r\nof communication with our sister republics of South America should be\r\nchiefly under foreign control. It is not a good thing that American\r\nmerchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and letters\r\nto South America via Europe if they wish security and despatch. Even\r\non the Pacific, where our ships have held their own better than on the\r\nAtlantic, our merchant flag is now threatened through the liberal aid\r\nbestowed by other governments on their own steam lines. I ask your\r\nearnest consideration of the report with which the Merchant Marine\r\nCommission has followed its long and careful inquiry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI again heartily commend to your favorable consideration the\r\ntercentennial celebration of the settlement at Jamestown, Virginia.\r\nAppreciating the desirability of this commemoration, the Congress\r\npassed an act, March 3, 1905, authorizing in the year 1907, on and near\r\nthe waters of Hampton Roads, in the State of Virginia, an international\r\nnaval, marine, and military celebration in honor of this event. By the\r\nauthority vested in me by this act, I have made proclamation of said\r\ncelebration, and have issued, in conformity with its instructions,\r\ninvitations to all the nations of the earth to participate, by\r\nsending their naval vessels and such military organizations as may\r\nbe practical. This celebration would fail of its full purpose unless\r\nit were enduring in its results and commensurate with the importance\r\nof the event to be celebrated, the event from which our Nation dates\r\nits birth. I earnestly hope that this celebration, already indorsed\r\nby the Congress of the United States, and by the legislatures of\r\nsixteen States since the action of the Congress, will receive such\r\nadditional aid at your hands as will make it worthy of the great\r\nevent it is intended to celebrate, and thereby enable the Government\r\nof the United States to make provision for the exhibition of its own\r\nresources, and likewise enable our people who have undertaken the work\r\nof such a celebration to provide suitable and proper entertainment and\r\ninstruction in the historic events of our country for all who may visit\r\nthe exposition and to whom we have tendered our hospitality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of unmixed satisfaction once more to call attention to\r\nthe excellent work of the Pension Bureau; for the veterans of the Civil\r\nWar have a greater claim upon us than any other class of our citizens.\r\nTo them, first of all among our people, honor is due.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago my lamented predecessor, President McKinley, stated\r\nthat the time had come for the Nation to care for the graves of the\r\nConfederate dead. I recommend that the Congress take action toward\r\nthis end. The first need is to take charge of the graves of the\r\nConfederate dead who died in Northern prisons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question of immigration is of vital interest to this country.\r\nIn the year ending June 30, 1905, there came to the United States\r\n1,026,000 alien immigrants. In other words, in the single year that\r\nhas just elapsed there came to this country a greater number of people\r\nthan came here during the one hundred and sixty-nine years of our\r\ncolonial life which intervened between the first landing at Jamestown\r\nand the Declaration of Independence. It is clearly shown in the report\r\nof the Commissioner-General of Immigration that, while much of this\r\nenormous immigration is undoubtedly healthy and natural, a considerable\r\nproportion is undesirable from one reason or another; moreover, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of it, probably a very large proportion,\r\nincluding most of the undesirable class, does not come here of its own\r\ninitiative, but because of the activity of the agents of the great\r\ntransportation companies. These agents are distributed throughout\r\nEurope, and by the offer of all kinds of inducements they wheedle and\r\ncajole many immigrants, often against their best interest, to come\r\nhere. The most serious obstacle we have to encounter in the effort to\r\nsecure a proper regulation of the immigration to these shores arises\r\nfrom the determined opposition of the foreign steamship lines, who have\r\nno interest whatever in the matter save to increase the returns on\r\ntheir capital by carrying masses of immigrants hither in the steerage\r\nquarters of their ships.\r\n\r\nAs I said in my last Message to the Congress, we can not have too much\r\nimmigration of the right sort, and we should have none whatever of\r\nthe wrong sort. Of course it is desirable that even the right kind of\r\nimmigration should be properly distributed in this country. We need\r\nmore of such immigration for the South; and special effort should be\r\nmade to secure it. Perhaps it would be possible to limit the number\r\nof immigrants allowed to come in any one year to New York and other\r\nNorthern cities, while leaving unlimited the number allowed to come to\r\nthe South; always provided, however, that a stricter effort is made\r\nto see that only immigrants of the right kind come to our country\r\nanywhere. In actual practice it has proved so difficult to enforce\r\nthe immigration laws where long stretches of frontier marked by an\r\nimaginary line alone intervene between us and our neighbors that I\r\nrecommend that no immigrants be allowed to come in from Canada and\r\nMexico, save natives of the two countries themselves. As much as\r\npossible should be done to distribute the immigrants upon the land and\r\nkeep them away from the congested tenement-house districts of the great\r\ncities. But distribution is a palliative, not a cure. The prime need is\r\nto keep out all immigrants who will not make good American citizens.\r\nThe laws now existing for the exclusion of undesirable immigrants\r\nshould be strengthened. Adequate means should be adopted, enforced\r\nby sufficient penalties, to compel steamship companies engaged in the\r\npassenger business to observe in good faith the law which forbids them\r\nto encourage or solicit immigration to the United States. Moreover,\r\nthere should be a sharp limitation imposed upon all vessels coming to\r\nour ports as to the number of immigrants in ratio to the tonnage which\r\neach vessel can carry. This ratio should be high enough to ensure the\r\ncoming hither of as good a class of aliens as possible. Provision\r\nshould be made for the surer punishment of those who induce aliens\r\nto come to this country under promise or assurance of employment. It\r\nshould be made possible to inflict a sufficiently heavy penalty on any\r\nemployer violating this law to deter him from taking the risk. It seems\r\nto me wise that there should be an international conference held to\r\ndeal with this question of immigration, which has more than a merely\r\nnational significance; such a conference could among other things\r\nenter at length into the methods for securing a thorough inspection\r\nof would-be immigrants at the ports from which they desire to embark\r\nbefore permitting them to embark.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this question it is unwise to depart from the old\r\nAmerican tradition and to discriminate for or against any man who\r\ndesires to come here and become a citizen, save on the ground of that\r\nman’s fitness for citizenship. It is our right and duty to consider\r\nhis moral and social quality. His standard of living should be such\r\nthat he will not, by pressure of competition, lower the standard of\r\nliving of our own wage-workers; for it must ever be a prime object of\r\nour legislation to keep high their standard of living. If the man who\r\nseeks to come here is from the moral and social standpoint of such a\r\ncharacter as to bid fair to add value to the community he should be\r\nheartily welcomed. We can not afford to pay heed to whether he is of\r\none creed or another, of one nation or another. We can not afford to\r\nconsider whether he is Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whether\r\nhe is Englishman or Irishman, Frenchman or German, Japanese, Italian,\r\nScandinavian, Slav, or Magyar. What we should desire to find out is\r\nthe individual quality of the individual man. In my judgment, with\r\nthis end in view, we shall have to prepare through our own agents a\r\nfar more rigid inspection in the countries from which the immigrants\r\ncome. It will be a great deal better to have fewer immigrants, but\r\nall of the right kind, than a great number of immigrants, many of\r\nwhom are necessarily of the wrong kind. As far as possible we wish\r\nto limit the immigration to this country to persons who propose to\r\nbecome citizens of this country, and we can well afford to insist upon\r\nadequate scrutiny of the character of those who are thus proposed for\r\nfuture citizenship. There should be an increase in the stringency of\r\nthe laws to keep out insane, idiotic, epileptic, and pauper immigrants.\r\nBut this is by no means enough. Not merely the anarchist, but every\r\nman of anarchistic tendencies, all violent and disorderly people,\r\nall people of bad character, the incompetent, the lazy, the vicious,\r\nthe physically unfit, defective, or degenerate should be kept out.\r\nThe stocks out of which American citizenship is to be built should\r\nbe strong and healthy, sound in body, mind, and character. If it be\r\nobjected that the Government agents would not always select well, the\r\nanswer is that they would certainly select better than do the agents\r\nand brokers of foreign steamship companies, the people who now do\r\nwhatever selection is done.\r\n\r\nThe questions arising in connection with Chinese immigration stand by\r\nthemselves. The conditions in China are such that the entire Chinese\r\ncoolie class, that is, the class of Chinese laborers, skilled and\r\nunskilled, legitimately come under the head of undesirable immigrants\r\nto this country, because of their numbers, the low wages for which\r\nthey work, and their low standard of living. Not only is it to the\r\ninterest of this country to keep them out, but the Chinese authorities\r\ndo not desire that they should be admitted. At present their entrance\r\nis prohibited by laws amply adequate to accomplish this purpose.\r\nThese laws have been, are being, and will be thoroughly enforced. The\r\nviolations of them are so few in number as to be infinitesimal and can\r\nbe entirely disregarded. There is no serious proposal to alter the\r\nimmigration law as regards the Chinese laborer, skilled or unskilled,\r\nand there is no excuse for any man feeling or affecting to feel the\r\nslightest alarm on the subject.\r\n\r\nBut in the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese\r\nlaborers, Chinese coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done\r\nby this Nation to the people of China, and therefore ultimately to\r\nthis Nation itself. Chinese students, business and professional men\r\nof all kinds—not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers,\r\nprofessors, travelers, and the like—should be encouraged to come here\r\nand treated on precisely the same footing that we treat students,\r\nbusiness men, travelers, and the like of other nations. Our laws\r\nand treaties should be framed, not so as to put these people in the\r\nexcepted classes, but to state that we will admit all Chinese, except\r\nChinese of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or unskilled laborers.\r\nThere would not be the least danger that any such provision would\r\nresult in any relaxation of the law about laborers. These will, under\r\nall conditions, be kept out absolutely. But it will be more easy to see\r\nthat both justice and courtesy are shown, as they ought to be shown,\r\nto other Chinese, if the law or treaty is framed as above suggested.\r\nExaminations should be completed at the port of departure from China.\r\nFor this purpose there should be provided a more adequate consular\r\nservice in China than we now have. The appropriations, both for the\r\nofficers of the consuls and for the office forces in the consulates,\r\nshould be increased.\r\n\r\nAs a people we have talked much of the open door in China, and we\r\nexpect, and quite rightly intend to insist, upon justice being shown us\r\nby the Chinese. But we can not expect to receive equity unless we do\r\nequity. We can not ask the Chinese to do to us what we are unwilling\r\nto do to them. They would have a perfect right to exclude our laboring\r\nmen if our laboring men threatened to come into their country in such\r\nnumbers as to jeopardize the well-being of the Chinese population; and\r\nas, _mutatis mutandis_, these were the conditions with which Chinese\r\nimmigration actually brought this people face to face, we had and have\r\na perfect right, which the Chinese Government in no way contests, to\r\nact as we have acted in the matter of restricting coolie immigration.\r\nThat this right exists for each country was explicitly acknowledged\r\nin the last treaty between the two countries. But we must treat the\r\nChinese student, traveler, and business man in a spirit of the broadest\r\njustice and courtesy if we expect similar treatment to be accorded to\r\nour own people of similar rank who go to China. Much trouble has come\r\nduring the past summer from the organized boycott against American\r\ngoods which has been started in China. The main factor in producing\r\nthis boycott has been the resentment felt by the students and business\r\npeople of China, by all the Chinese leaders, against the harshness\r\nof our law toward educated Chinamen of the professional and business\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThis Government has the friendliest feelings for China and desires\r\nChina’s well-being. We cordially sympathized with the announced purpose\r\nof Japan to stand for the integrity of China. Such an attitude tends to\r\nthe peace of the world.\r\n\r\nThe civil service law has been on the statute books for twenty-two\r\nyears. Every President and a vast majority of heads of departments\r\nwho have been in office during that period have favored a gradual\r\nextension of the merit system. The more thoroughly its principles have\r\nbeen understood, the greater has been the favor with which the law has\r\nbeen regarded by administrative officers. Any attempt to carry on the\r\ngreat executive departments of the Government without this law would\r\ninevitably result in chaos. The Civil Service Commissioners are doing\r\nexcellent work; and their compensation is inadequate, considering the\r\nservice they perform.\r\n\r\nThe statement that the examinations are not practical in character\r\nis based on a misapprehension of the practice of the Commission. The\r\ndepartments are invariably consulted as to the requirements desired\r\nand as to the character of questions that shall be asked. General\r\ninvitations are frequently sent put to all heads of departments asking\r\nwhether any changes in the scope or character of examinations are\r\nrequired. In other words, the departments prescribe the requirements\r\nand the qualifications desired, and the Civil Service Commission\r\nco-operates with them in securing persons with these qualifications\r\nand ensuring open and impartial competition. In a large number of\r\nexaminations (as, for example, those for trades positions) there\r\nare no educational requirements whatever, and a person who can\r\nneither read nor write may pass with a high average. Vacancies in\r\nthe service are filled with reasonable expedition and the machinery\r\nof the Commission, which reaches every part of the country, is the\r\nbest agency that has yet been devised for finding people with the\r\nmost suitable qualifications for the various offices to be filled.\r\nWritten competitive examinations do not make an ideal method for\r\nfilling positions, but they do represent an immeasurable advance upon\r\nthe “spoils” method, under which outside politicians really made the\r\nappointments nominally made by the executive officers, the appointees\r\nbeing chosen by the politicians in question, in the great majority of\r\ncases, for reasons totally unconnected with the needs of the service or\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nStatistics gathered by the Census Bureau show that the tenure of\r\noffice in the Government service does not differ materially from that\r\nenjoyed by employees of large business corporations. Heads of executive\r\ndepartments and members of the Commission have called my attention to\r\nthe fact that the rule requiring a filing of charges and three days’\r\nnotice before an employee could be separated from the service for\r\ninefficiency has served no good purpose whatever, because that is not\r\na matter upon which a hearing of the employee found to be inefficient\r\ncan be of any value, and in practice the rule providing for such\r\nnotice and hearing has merely resulted in keeping in a certain number\r\nof incompetents, because of the reluctance of heads of departments\r\nand bureau chiefs to go through the required procedure. Experience\r\nhas shown that this rule is wholly ineffective to save any man, if a\r\nsuperior for improper reasons wishes to remove him, and is mischievous\r\nbecause it sometimes serves to keep in the service incompetent men not\r\nguilty of specific wrong-doing. Having these facts in view, the rule\r\nhas been amended by providing that where the inefficiency or incapacity\r\ncomes within the personal knowledge of the head of a department the\r\nremoval may be made without notice, the reasons therefor being filed\r\nand made a record of the department. The absolute right of removal\r\nrests where it always has rested, with the head of a department; any\r\nlimitation of this absolute right results in grave injury to the public\r\nservice. The change is merely one of procedure; it was much needed; and\r\nit is producing good results.\r\n\r\nThe civil service law is being energetically and impartially enforced,\r\nand in the large majority of cases complaints of violations of either\r\nthe law or rules are discovered to be unfounded. In this respect,\r\nthis law compares very favorably with any other Federal statute. The\r\nquestion of politics in the appointment and retention of the men\r\nengaged in merely ministerial work has been practically eliminated in\r\nalmost the entire field of Government employment covered by the civil\r\nservice law. The action of the Congress in providing the Commission\r\nwith its own force instead of requiring it to rely on detailed clerks\r\nhas been justified by the increased work done at a smaller cost to the\r\nGovernment. I urge upon the Congress a careful consideration of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the annual report of the Commission.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in\r\ndefinition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit\r\nprovision for many articles which, under modern reproductive processes,\r\nare entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyright\r\nproprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the\r\npublic; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible\r\nfor the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public.\r\nAttempts to improve them by amendment have been frequent, no less\r\nthan twelve acts for the purpose having been passed since the Revised\r\nStatutes. To perfect them by further amendments seems impracticable. A\r\ncomplete revision of them is essential. Such a revision, to meet modern\r\nconditions, has been found necessary in Germany, Austria, Sweden, and\r\nother foreign countries, and bills embodying it are pending in England\r\nand the Australian colonies. It has been urged here, and proposals for\r\na commission to undertake it have, from time to time, been pressed upon\r\nthe Congress. The inconveniences of the present conditions being so\r\ngreat, an attempt to frame appropriate legislation has been made by the\r\nCopyright Office, which has called conferences of the various interests\r\nespecially and practically concerned with the operation of the\r\ncopyright laws. It has secured from them suggestions as to the changes\r\nnecessary; it has added from its own experience and investigations,\r\nand it has drafted a bill which embodies such of these changes and\r\nadditions as, after full discussion and expert criticism, appeared\r\nto be sound and safe. In form this bill would replace the existing\r\ninsufficient and inconsistent laws by one general copyright statute. It\r\nwill be presented to the Congress at the coming session. It deserves\r\nprompt consideration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI recommend that a law be enacted to regulate interstate commerce in\r\nmisbranded and adulterated foods, drinks, and drugs. Such law would\r\nprotect legitimate manufacture and commerce, and would tend to secure\r\nthe health and welfare of the consuming public. Traffic in foodstuffs\r\nwhich have been debased or adulterated so as to injure health or to\r\ndeceive purchasers should be forbidden.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe law forbidding the emission of dense black or gray smoke in the\r\nCity of Washington has been sustained by the courts. Something has\r\nbeen accomplished under it, but much remains to be done if we would\r\npreserve the Capital City from defacement by the smoke nuisance.\r\nRepeated prosecutions under the law have not had the desired effect. I\r\nrecommend that it be made more stringent by increasing both the minimum\r\nand maximum fine; by providing for imprisonment in cases of repeated\r\nviolation; and by affording the remedy of injunction against the\r\ncontinuation of the operation of plants which are persistent offenders.\r\nI recommend, also, an increase in the number of inspectors, whose duty\r\nit shall be to detect violations of the act.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the generous act of the State of California\r\nin conferring upon the United States Government the ownership of the\r\nYosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove. There should be no\r\ndelay in accepting the gift, and appropriations should be made for\r\nthe including thereof in the Yosemite National Park, and for the care\r\nand policing of the park. California has acted most wisely as well as\r\nwith great magnanimity in the matter. There are certain mighty natural\r\nfeatures of our land which should be preserved in perpetuity for our\r\nchildren and our children’s children. In my judgment the Grand Canyon\r\nof the Colorado should be made into a national park. It is greatly to\r\nbe wished that the State of New York should copy as regards Niagara\r\nwhat the State of California has done as regards the Yosemite. Nothing\r\nshould be allowed to interfere with the preservation of Niagara Falls\r\nin all their beauty and majesty. If the State can not see to this, then\r\nit is earnestly to be wished that she should be willing to turn it over\r\nto the National Government, which should in such case (if possible,\r\nin conjunction with the Canadian Government) assume the burden and\r\nresponsibility of preserving unharmed Niagara Falls; just as it should\r\ngladly assume a similar burden and responsibility for the Yosemite\r\nNational Park, and as it has already assumed them for the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park. Adequate provision should be made by the Congress for\r\nthe proper care and supervision of all these national parks. The\r\nboundaries of the Yellowstone National Park should be extended to\r\nthe south and east to take in such portions of the abutting forest\r\nreservation as will enable the Government to protect the elk on their\r\nwinter range.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic animal of the Western plains was the great\r\nshaggy-maned wild ox, the bison, commonly known as buffalo. Small\r\nfragments of herds exist in a domesticated state here and there, a few\r\nof them in the Yellowstone Park. Such a herd as that on the Flathead\r\nReservation should not be allowed to go out of existence. Either on\r\nsome reservation or on some forest reserve like the Wichita reserve and\r\ngame refuge provision should be made for the preservation of such a\r\nherd. I believe that the scheme would be of economic advantage, for the\r\nrobe of the buffalo is of high market value, and the same is true of\r\nthe robe of the crossbred animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI call your especial attention to the desirability of giving to\r\nthe members of the Life-Saving Service pensions such as are given\r\nto firemen and policemen in all our great cities. The men in the\r\nLife-Saving Service continually and in the most matter-of-fact way\r\ndo deeds such as make Americans proud of their country. They have\r\nno political influence; and they live in such remote places that the\r\nreally heroic services they continually render receive the scantiest\r\nrecognition from the public. It is unjust for a great nation like this\r\nto permit these men to become totally disabled or to meet death in\r\nthe performance of their hazardous duty and yet to give them no sort\r\nof reward. If one of them serves thirty years of his life in such a\r\nposition he should surely be entitled to retire on half pay, as a\r\nfireman or policeman does, and if he becomes totally incapacitated\r\nthrough accident or sickness or loses his health in the discharge of\r\nhis duty, he or his family should receive a pension just as any soldier\r\nshould. I call your attention with especial earnestness to this matter\r\nbecause it appeals not only to our judgment but to our sympathy; for\r\nthe people on whose behalf I ask it are comparatively few in number,\r\nrender incalculable service of a particularly dangerous kind, and have\r\nno one to speak for them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the year just past, the phase of the Indian question which has\r\nbeen most sharply brought to public attention is the larger legal\r\nsignificance of the Indian’s induction into citizenship. This has made\r\nitself manifest not only in a great access of litigation in which the\r\ncitizen Indian figures as a party defendant and in a more widespread\r\ndisposition to levy local taxation upon his personalty, but in a\r\ndecision of the United States Supreme Court which struck away the main\r\nprop on which has hitherto rested the Government’s benevolent effort\r\nto protect him against the evils of intemperance. The court holds, in\r\neffect, that when an Indian becomes, by virtue of an allotment of land\r\nto him, a citizen of the State in which his land is situated, he passes\r\nfrom under Federal control in such matters as this, and the acts of\r\nthe Congress prohibiting the sale or gift to him of intoxicants become\r\nsubstantially inoperative. It is gratifying to note that the States\r\nand municipalities of the West which have most at stake in the welfare\r\nof the Indians are taking up this subject and are trying to supply,\r\nin a measure at least, the abdication of its trusteeship forced upon\r\nthe Federal Government. Nevertheless, I would urgently press upon\r\nthe attention of the Congress the question whether some amendment of\r\nthe internal-revenue laws might not be of aid in prosecuting those\r\nmalefactors, known in the Indian country as “bootleggers,” who are\r\nengaged at once in defrauding the United States Treasury of taxes and,\r\nwhat is far more important, in debauching the Indians by carrying\r\nliquors illicitly into territory still completely under Federal\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAmong the crying present needs of the Indians are more day schools\r\nsituated in the midst of their settlements, more effective instruction\r\nin the industries pursued on their own farms, and a more liberal\r\nextension of the field-matron service, which means the education of\r\nthe Indian women in the arts of home making. Until the mothers are\r\nwell started in the right direction we can not reasonably expect much\r\nfrom the children who are soon to form an integral part of our American\r\ncitizenship. Moreover, the excuse continually advanced by male adult\r\nIndians for refusing offers of remunerative employment at a distance\r\nfrom their homes is that they dare not leave their families too long\r\nout of their sight. One effectual remedy for this state of things is to\r\nemploy the minds and strengthen the moral fibre of the Indian women—the\r\nend to which the work of the field matron is especially directed. I\r\ntrust that the Congress will make its appropriations for Indian day\r\nschools and field matrons as generous as may consist with the other\r\npressing demands upon its providence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the last year the Philippine Islands have been slowly recovering\r\nfrom the series of disasters which, since American occupation, have\r\ngreatly reduced the amount of agricultural products below what was\r\nproduced in Spanish times. The war, the rinderpest, the locusts, the\r\ndrought, and the cholera have been united as causes to prevent a return\r\nof the prosperity much needed in the islands. The most serious is the\r\ndestruction by the rinderpest of more than 75 per cent of the draught\r\ncattle, because it will take several years of breeding to restore\r\nthe necessary number of these indispensable aids to agriculture. The\r\nCommission attempted to supply by purchase from adjoining countries the\r\nneeded cattle, but the experiments made were unsuccessful. Most of the\r\ncattle imported were unable to withstand the change of climate and the\r\nrigors of the voyage, and died from other diseases than rinderpest.\r\n\r\nThe income of the Philippine Government has necessarily been reduced\r\nby reason of the business and agricultural depression in the islands,\r\nand the government has been obliged to exercise great economy, to cut\r\ndown its expenses, to reduce salaries, and in every way to avoid a\r\ndeficit. It has adopted an internal-revenue law, imposing taxes on\r\ncigars, cigarettes, and distilled liquors, and abolishing the old\r\nSpanish industrial taxes. The law has not operated as smoothly as was\r\nhoped, and although its principle is undoubtedly correct, it may need\r\namendments for the purpose of reconciling the people to its provisions.\r\nThe income derived from it has partly made up for the reduction in\r\ncustoms revenue.\r\n\r\nThere has been a marked increase in the number of Filipinos employed\r\nin the civil service, and a corresponding decrease in the number of\r\nAmericans. The government in every one of its departments has been\r\nrendered more efficient by elimination of undesirable material and the\r\npromotion of deserving public servants.\r\n\r\nImprovements of harbors, roads, and bridges continue, although the\r\ncutting down of the revenue forbids the expenditure of any great amount\r\nfrom current income for these purposes. Steps are being taken, by\r\nadvertisement for competitive bids, to secure the construction and\r\nmaintenance of 1,000 miles of railway by private corporations under\r\nthe recent enabling legislation of the Congress. The transfer of the\r\nfriar lands, in accordance with the contract made some two years ago,\r\nhas been completely effected, and the purchase money paid. Provision\r\nhas just been made by statute for the speedy settlement in a special\r\nproceeding in the Supreme Court of controversies over the possession\r\nand title of church buildings and rectories arising between the Roman\r\nCatholic Church and schismatics claiming under ancient municipalities.\r\nNegotiations and hearings for the settlement of the amount due to the\r\nRoman Catholic Church for rent and occupation of churches and rectories\r\nby the Army of the United States are in progress, and it is hoped a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion may be submitted to the Congress before the end\r\nof the session.\r\n\r\nTranquillity has existed during the past year throughout the\r\nArchipelago, except in the province of Cavite, the province of\r\nBatangas, and the province of Samar, and in the island of Jolo among\r\nthe Moros. The Jolo disturbance was put an end to by several sharp\r\nand short engagements, and now peace prevails in the Moro province.\r\nCavite, the mother of ladrones in the Spanish times, is so permeated\r\nwith the traditional sympathy of the people for ladronism as to make\r\nit difficult to stamp out the disease. Batangas was only disturbed by\r\nreason of the fugitive ladrones from Cavite. Samar was thrown into\r\ndisturbance by the uneducated and partly savage peoples living in the\r\nmountains, who, having been given by the municipal code more power than\r\nthey were able to exercise discreetly, elected municipal officers who\r\nabused their trusts, compelled the people raising hemp to sell it at\r\na much less price than it was worth, and by their abuses drove their\r\npeople into resistance to constituted authority. Cavite and Samar are\r\ninstances of reposing too much confidence in the self-governing power\r\nof a people. The disturbances have all now been suppressed, and it is\r\nhoped that with these lessons local governments can be formed which\r\nwill secure quiet and peace to the deserving inhabitants. The incident\r\nis another proof of the fact that if there has been any error as\r\nregards giving self-government in the Philippines it has been in the\r\ndirection of giving it too quickly, not too slowly. A year from next\r\nApril the first legislative assembly for the islands will be held. On\r\nthe sanity and self-restraint of this body much will depend so far as\r\nthe future self-government of the islands is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe most encouraging feature of the whole situation has been the very\r\ngreat interest taken by the common people in education and the great\r\nincrease in the number of enrolled students in the public schools.\r\nThe increase was from 300,000 to half a million pupils. The average\r\nattendance is about 70 per cent. The only limit upon the number of\r\npupils seems to be the capacity of the government to furnish teachers\r\nand schoolhouses.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural conditions of the islands enforce more strongly than\r\never the argument in favor of reducing the tariff on the products\r\nof the Philippine Islands entering the United States. I earnestly\r\nrecommend that the tariff now imposed by the Dingley bill upon the\r\nproducts of the Philippine Islands be entirely removed, except the\r\ntariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to 25\r\nper cent of the present rates under the Dingley Act; that after July\r\n1, 1909, the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced in the Philippine\r\nIslands be entirely removed, and that free trade between the islands\r\nand the United States in the products of each country then be provided\r\nfor by law.\r\n\r\nA statute in force, enacted April 15, 1904, suspends the operation\r\nof the coastwise laws of the United States upon the trade between\r\nthe Philippine Islands and the United States until July 1, 1906. I\r\nearnestly recommend that this suspension be postponed until July 1,\r\n1909. I think it of doubtful utility to apply the coastwise laws to\r\nthe trade between the United States and the Philippines under any\r\ncircumstances, because I am convinced that it will do no good whatever\r\nto American bottoms, and will only interfere and be an obstacle to\r\nthe trade between the Philippines and the United States; but if the\r\ncoastwise law must be thus applied, certainly it ought not to have\r\neffect until free trade is enjoyed between the people of the United\r\nStates and the people of the Philippine Islands in their respective\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nI do not anticipate that free trade between the islands and the United\r\nStates will produce a revolution in the sugar and tobacco production\r\nof the Philippine Islands. So primitive are the methods of agriculture\r\nin the Philippine Islands, so slow is capital in going to the islands,\r\nso many difficulties surround a large agricultural enterprise in the\r\nislands, that it will be many, many years before the products of those\r\nislands will have any effect whatever upon the markets of the United\r\nStates. The problem of labor is also a formidable one with the sugar\r\nand tobacco producers in the islands. The best friends of the Filipino\r\npeople and the people themselves are utterly opposed to the admission\r\nof Chinese coolie labor. Hence the only solution is the training of\r\nFilipino labor, and this will take a long time. The enactment of a law\r\nby the Congress of the United States making provision for free trade\r\nbetween the islands and the United States, however, will be of great\r\nimportance from a political and sentimental standpoint; and while its\r\nactual benefit has doubtless been exaggerated by the people of the\r\nislands, they will accept this measure of justice as an indication that\r\nthe people of the United States are anxious to aid the people of the\r\nPhilippine Islands in every way, and especially in the agricultural\r\ndevelopment of their Archipelago. It will aid the Filipinos without\r\ninjuring interests in America.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment immediate steps should be taken for the fortification\r\nof Hawaii. This is the most important point in the Pacific to fortify\r\nin order to conserve the interests of this country. It would be hard\r\nto overstate the importance of this need. Hawaii is too heavily taxed.\r\nLaws should be enacted setting aside for a period of, say, twenty\r\nyears 75 per cent of the internal-revenue and customs receipts from\r\nHawaii as a special fund to be expended in the islands for educational\r\nand public buildings, and for harbor improvements and military and\r\nnaval defences. It can not be too often repeated that our aim must\r\nbe to develop the Territory of Hawaii on traditional American lines.\r\nThat Territory has serious commercial and industrial problems to\r\nreckon with; but no measure of relief can be considered which looks\r\nto legislation admitting Chinese and restricting them by statute to\r\nfield labor and domestic service. The status of servility can never\r\nagain be tolerated on American soil. We can not concede that the proper\r\nsolution of its problems is special legislation admitting to Hawaii a\r\nclass of laborers denied admission to the other States and Territories.\r\nThere are obstacles, and great obstacles, in the way of building up a\r\nrepresentative American community in the Hawaiian Islands; but it is\r\nnot in the American character to give up in the face of difficulty.\r\nMany an American Commonwealth has been built up against odds equal to\r\nthose that now confront Hawaii.\r\n\r\nNo merely half-hearted effort to meet its problems as other American\r\ncommunities have met theirs can be accepted as final. Hawaii shall\r\nnever become a Territory in which a governing class of rich planters\r\nexists by means of coolie labor. Even if the rate of growth of the\r\nTerritory is thereby rendered slower, the growth must only take place\r\nby the admission of immigrants fit in the end to assume the duties and\r\nburdens of full American citizenship. Our aim must be to develop the\r\nTerritory on the same basis of stable citizenship as exists on this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly\r\nconfer American citizenship on all citizens of Porto Rico. There is, in\r\nmy judgment, no excuse for failure to do this. The harbor of San Juan\r\nshould be dredged and improved. The expenses of the Federal court of\r\nPorto Rico should be met from the Federal Treasury, and not from the\r\nPorto Rican treasury. The elections in Porto Rico should take place\r\nevery four years, and the legislature should meet in session every two\r\nyears. The present form of government in Porto Rico, which provides\r\nfor the appointment by the President of the members of the executive\r\ncouncil or upper house of the legislature, has proved satisfactory and\r\nhas inspired confidence in property owners and investors. I do not deem\r\nit advisable at the present time to change this form in any material\r\nfeature. The problems and needs of the island are industrial and\r\ncommercial rather than political.\r\n\r\nI wish also to call the attention of the Congress to one question which\r\naffects our insular possessions, generally; namely, the need of an\r\nincreased liberality in the treatment of the whole franchise question\r\nin these islands. In the proper desire to prevent the islands being\r\nexploited by speculators and to have them develop in the interest\r\nof their own people an error has been made in refusing to grant\r\nsufficiently liberal terms to induce the investment of American capital\r\nin the Philippines and in Porto Rico. Elsewhere in this Message I have\r\nspoken strongly against the jealousy of mere wealth, and especially of\r\ncorporate wealth as such. But it is particularly regrettable to allow\r\nany such jealousy to be developed when we are dealing either with our\r\ninsular or with foreign affairs. The big corporation has achieved its\r\npresent position in the business world simply because it is the most\r\neffective instrument in business competition. In foreign affairs we can\r\nnot afford to put our people at a disadvantage with their competitors\r\nby in any way discriminating against the efficiency of our business\r\norganizations. In the same way we can not afford to allow our insular\r\npossessions to lag behind in industrial development from any twisted\r\njealousy of business success. It is, of course, a mere truism to say\r\nthat the business interests of the islands will only be developed if it\r\nbecomes the financial interest of somebody to develop them. Yet this\r\ndevelopment is one of the things most earnestly to be wished for in the\r\ninterest of the islands themselves. We have been paying all possible\r\nheed to the political and educational interests of the islands, but,\r\nimportant though these objects are, it is not less important that\r\nwe should favor their industrial development. The Government can in\r\ncertain ways help this directly, as by building good roads; but the\r\nfundamental and vital help must be given through the development of\r\nthe industries of the islands, and a most efficient means to this end\r\nis to encourage big American corporations to start industries in them,\r\nand this means to make it advantageous for them to do so. To limit\r\nthe ownership of mining claims as has been done in the Philippines is\r\nabsurd. In both the Philippines and Porto Rico the limit of holdings of\r\nland should be largely raised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI earnestly ask that Alaska be given an elective Delegate. Some person\r\nshould be chosen who can speak with authority of the needs of the\r\nTerritory. The Government should aid in the construction of a railroad\r\nfrom the Gulf of Alaska to the Yukon River, in American territory. In\r\nmy last two Messages I advocated certain additional action on behalf of\r\nAlaska. I shall not now repeat those recommendations, but I shall lay\r\nall my stress upon the one recommendation of giving to Alaska some one\r\nauthorized to speak for it. I should prefer that the Delegate was made\r\nelective, but if this is not deemed wise, then make him appointive. At\r\nany rate, give Alaska some person whose business it shall be to speak\r\nwith authority on her behalf to the Congress. The natural resources of\r\nAlaska are great. Some of the chief needs of the peculiarly energetic,\r\nself-reliant, and typically American white population of Alaska were\r\nset forth in my last Message. I also earnestly ask your attention to\r\nthe needs of the Alaskan Indians. All Indians who are competent should\r\nreceive the full rights of American citizenship. It is, for instance, a\r\ngross and indefensible wrong to deny to such hardworking, decent-living\r\nIndians as the Metlakahtlas the right to obtain licenses as captains,\r\npilots, and engineers, the right to enter mining claims, and to profit\r\nby the homestead law. These particular Indians are civilized, and are\r\ncompetent and entitled to be put on the same basis with the white men\r\nround about them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one State\r\nand that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one State. There is no\r\nobligation upon us to treat territorial subdivisions, which are matters\r\nof convenience only, as binding us on the question of admission to\r\nStatehood. Nothing has taken up more time in the Congress during the\r\npast few years than the question as to the Statehood to be granted to\r\nthe four Territories above mentioned, and after careful consideration\r\nof all that has been developed in the discussions of the question I\r\nrecommend that they be immediately admitted as two States. There is no\r\njustification for further delay; and the advisability of making the\r\nfour Territories into two States has been clearly established.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Territories the legislative assemblies issue licenses\r\nfor gambling. The Congress should by law forbid this practice, the\r\nharmful results of which are obvious at a glance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe treaty between the United States and the Republic of Panama,\r\nunder which the construction of the Panama Canal was made possible,\r\nwent into effect with its ratification by the United States Senate on\r\nFebruary 23, 1904. The canal properties of the French Canal Company\r\nwere transferred to the United States on April 23, 1904, on payment\r\nof $40,000,000 to that company. On April 1, 1905, the Commission was\r\nreorganized, and it now consists of Theodore P. Shonts, chairman,\r\nCharles E. Magoon, Benjamin M. Harrod, Rear-Admiral Mordecai T.\r\nEndicott, Brig.-Gen. Peter C. Hains, and Col. Oswald H. Ernst. John\r\nF. Stevens was appointed chief engineer on July 1 last. Active work\r\nin canal construction, mainly preparatory, has been in progress for\r\nless than a year and a half. During that period two points about the\r\ncanal have ceased to be open to debate. First, the question of route;\r\nthe canal will be built on the Isthmus of Panama. Second, the question\r\nof feasibility; there are no physical obstacles on this route that\r\nAmerican engineering skill will not be able to overcome without serious\r\ndifficulty, or that will prevent the completion of the canal within\r\na reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. This is virtually the\r\nunanimous testimony of the engineers who have investigated the matter\r\nfor the Government.\r\n\r\nThe point which remains unsettled is the question of type, whether\r\nthe canal shall be one of several locks above sea level, or at sea\r\nlevel with a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before the\r\nCongress at an early day the findings of the Advisory Board of American\r\nand European Engineers, that at my invitation have been considering the\r\nsubject, together with the report of the Commission thereon; and such\r\ncomments thereon or recommendations in reference thereto as may seem\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe American people is pledged to the speediest possible construction\r\nof a canal adequate to meet the demands which the commerce of the world\r\nwill make upon it, and I appeal most earnestly to the Congress to aid\r\nin the fulfilment of the pledge. Gratifying progress has been made\r\nduring the past year and especially during the past four months. The\r\ngreater part of the necessary preliminary work has been done. Actual\r\nwork of excavation could be begun only on a limited scale till the\r\nCanal Zone was made a healthful place to live in and to work in. The\r\nIsthmus had to be sanitated first. This task has been so thoroughly\r\naccomplished that yellow fever has been virtually extirpated from the\r\nIsthmus and general health conditions vastly improved. The same methods\r\nwhich converted the island of Cuba from a pest hole which menaced the\r\nhealth of the world into a healthful place of abode have been applied\r\non the Isthmus with satisfactory results. There is no reason to doubt\r\nthat when the plans for water supply, paving, and sewerage of Panama\r\nand Colon and the large labor camps have been fully carried out, the\r\nIsthmus will be, for the Tropics, an unusually healthy place of abode.\r\nThe work is so far advanced now that the health of all those employed\r\nin canal work is as well guarded as it is on similar work in this\r\ncountry and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sanitating the Isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being\r\nprovided for employees and an adequate system of supplying them with\r\nwholesome food at reasonable prices has been created. Hospitals have\r\nbeen established and equipped that are without superiors of their kind\r\nanywhere. The country has thus been made fit to work in, and provision\r\nhas been made for the welfare and comfort of those who are to do the\r\nwork. During the past year a large portion of the plant with which\r\nthe work is to be done has been ordered. It is confidently believed\r\nthat by the middle of the approaching year a sufficient proportion of\r\nthis plant will have been installed to enable us to resume the work of\r\nexcavation on a large scale.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed now and without delay is an appropriation by the\r\nCongress to meet the current and accruing expenses of the Commission.\r\nThe first appropriation of $10,000,000, out of the $135,000,000\r\nauthorized by the Spooner Act, was made three years ago. It is\r\nnearly exhausted. There is barely enough of it remaining to\r\ncarry the Commission to the end of the year. Unless the Congress\r\nshall appropriate before that time all work must cease. To arrest\r\nprogress for any length of time now, when matters are advancing so\r\nsatisfactorily, would be deplorable. There will be no money with which\r\nto meet pay-roll obligations and none with which to meet bills coming\r\ndue for materials and supplies; and there will be demoralization of\r\nthe forces, here and on the Isthmus, now working so harmoniously and\r\neffectively, if there is delay in granting an emergency appropriation.\r\nEstimates of the amount necessary will be found in the accompanying\r\nreports of the Secretary of War and the Commission.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI recommend more adequate provision than has been made heretofore for\r\nthe work of the Department of State. Within a few years there has been\r\na very great increase in the amount and importance of the work to be\r\ndone by that Department, both in Washington and abroad. This has been\r\ncaused by the great increase of our foreign trade, the increase of\r\nwealth among our people, which enables them to travel more generally\r\nthan heretofore, the increase of American capital which is seeking\r\ninvestment in foreign countries, and the growth of our power and weight\r\nin the councils of the civilized world. There has been no corresponding\r\nincrease of facilities for doing the work afforded to the Department\r\nhaving charge of our foreign relations.\r\n\r\nNeither at home nor abroad is there a sufficient working force to do\r\nthe business properly. In many respects the system which was adequate\r\nto the work of twenty-five, or even ten, years ago, is inadequate now,\r\nand should be changed. Our consular force should be classified, and\r\nappointments should be made to the several classes, with authority\r\nto the Executive to assign the members of each class to duty at\r\nsuch posts as the interests of the service require, instead of the\r\nappointments being made as at present to specified posts. There should\r\nbe an adequate inspection service, so that the Department may be able\r\nto inform itself how the business of each consulate is being done,\r\ninstead of depending upon casual private information or rumor. The\r\nfee system should be entirely abolished, and a due equivalent made in\r\nsalary to the officers who now eke out their subsistence by means of\r\nfees. Sufficient provision should be made for a clerical force in every\r\nconsulate, composed entirely of Americans, instead of the insufficient\r\nprovision now made, which compels the employment of great numbers of\r\ncitizens of foreign countries whose services can be obtained for less\r\nmoney. At a large part of our consulates the office quarters and the\r\nclerical force are inadequate to the performance of the onerous duties\r\nimposed by the recent provisions of our immigration laws as well as by\r\nour increasing trade. In many parts of the world the lack of suitable\r\nquarters for our embassies, legations, and consulates detracts from the\r\nrespect in which our officers ought to be held, and seriously impairs\r\ntheir weight and influence.\r\n\r\nSuitable provision should be made for the expense of keeping our\r\ndiplomatic officers more fully informed of what is being done from day\r\nto day in the progress of our diplomatic affairs with other countries.\r\nThe lack of such information, caused by insufficient appropriations\r\navailable for cable tolls and for clerical and messenger service,\r\nfrequently puts our officers at a great disadvantage and detracts from\r\ntheir usefulness. The salary list should be readjusted. It does not\r\nnow correspond either to the importance of the service to be rendered\r\nand the degrees of ability and experience required in the different\r\npositions, or to the differences in the cost of living. In many cases\r\nthe salaries are quite inadequate.\r\n\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n      _December 5, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT”\r\n\r\n[Included in this volume because, although not an address or a state\r\npaper, it was written by Mr. Roosevelt while President. It was\r\npublished in a recent number of “The Outlook”]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “twilight of the poets” has been especially gray in America; for\r\npoetry is of course one of those arts in which the smallest amount of\r\nwork of the very highest class is worth an infinity of good work that\r\nis not of the highest class. The touch of the purple makes a poem out\r\nof verse, and if it is not there, there is no substitute. It is hard\r\nto account for the failure to produce in America of recent years a\r\npoet who in the world of letters will rank as high as certain American\r\nsculptors and painters rank in the world of art.\r\n\r\nBut true poems do appear from time to time, by Madison Cawein, by\r\nClinton Scollard, by Maurice Egan, and others; such are the poems in\r\nBliss Carman’s “Ballads of Lost Haven”; and such are the poems in\r\nEdward Arlington Robinson’s “The Children of the Night.”\r\n\r\nIt is rather curious that Mr. Robinson’s volume should not have\r\nattracted more attention. There is an undoubted touch of genius in\r\nthe poems collected in this volume, and a curious simplicity and good\r\nfaith, all of which qualities differentiate them sharply from ordinary\r\ncollections of the kind. There is in them just a little of the light\r\nthat never was on land or sea, and in such light the objects described\r\noften have nebulous outlines; but it is not always necessary in order\r\nto enjoy a poem that one should be able to translate it into terms\r\nof mathematical accuracy. Indeed, those who admire the coloring of\r\nTurner, those who like to read how—and to wonder why—Childe Roland to\r\nthe Dark Tower came, do not wish always to have the ideas presented to\r\nthem with cold, hard, definite outlines; and to a man with the poetic\r\ntemperament it is inevitable that life should often appear clothed with\r\na certain sad mysticism. In the present volume I am not sure that I\r\nunderstand “Luke Havergal”; but I am entirely sure that I like it.\r\n\r\nWhoever has lived in country America knows the gray, empty houses from\r\nwhich life has gone. It is of one of these that “The House on the Hill”\r\nwas written.\r\n\r\n      “They are all gone away,\r\n        The House is shut and still,\r\n      There is nothing more to say.\r\n\r\n      “Through broken walls and gray\r\n        The winds blow bleak and shrill:\r\n      They are all gone away.\r\n\r\n      “Nor is there one to-day\r\n        To speak them good or ill:\r\n      There is nothing more to say.\r\n\r\n      “Why is it then we stray\r\n        Around that sunken sill?\r\n      They are all gone away,\r\n\r\n      “And our poor fancy-play\r\n        For them is wasted skill:\r\n      There is nothing more to say.\r\n\r\n      “There is ruin and decay\r\n        In the House on the Hill:\r\n      They are all gone away,\r\n      There is nothing more to say.”\r\n\r\nThe next poem, “Richard Cory,” illustrates a very ancient but very\r\nprofound philosophy of life with a curiously local touch which points\r\nits keen insight. Those who feel poetry in their marrow and fibre are\r\nthe spiritual heirs of the ages; and so it is natural that this man\r\nfrom Maine, many of whose poems could have been written only by one to\r\nwhom the most real of lives is the life of the American small town,\r\nshould write his “Ballade of Broken Flutes”—where “A lonely surge\r\nof ancient spray told of an unforgetful sea”;—should write the poem\r\nbeginning\r\n\r\n      “Since Persia fell at Marathon,\r\n        The yellow years have gathered fast:\r\n      Long centuries have come and gone”;\r\n\r\nand the very original sonnet on Amaryllis, the last three lines of\r\nwhich are:\r\n\r\n      “But though the trumpets of the world were glad,\r\n      It made me lonely and it made me sad\r\n      To think that Amaryllis had grown old.”\r\n\r\nSome of his images stay fixed in one’s mind, as in “The Pity of the\r\nLeaves,” the lines running:\r\n\r\n      “The brown, thin leaves that on the stones outside\r\n      Skipped with a freezing whisper.”\r\n\r\nSometimes he writes, as in “The Tavern,” of what most of us feel we\r\nhave seen; and then again of what we have seen only with the soul’s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nI shall close by quoting entire his poem on “The Wilderness,” which\r\ncould have been written only by a man into whose heart there had\r\nentered deep the very spirit of the vast and melancholy Northern\r\nforests:\r\n\r\n  “Come away! come away! there’s a frost along the marshes,\r\n  And a frozen wind that skims the shoal where it shakes the dead black water;\r\n  There’s a moan across the lowland and a wailing through the woodland\r\n  Of a dirge that sings to send us back to the arms of those that love us.\r\n  There is nothing left but ashes now where the crimson chills of autumn\r\n  Put off the summer’s languor with a touch that made us glad\r\n  For the glory that is gone from us, with a flight we can not follow,\r\n  To the slopes of other valleys and the sounds of other shores.\r\n\r\n  “Come away! come away! you can hear them calling, calling,\r\n  Calling to us to come to them, and roam no more.\r\n  Over there beyond the ridges and the land that lies between us,\r\n  There’s an old song calling us to come!\r\n\r\n  “Come away! come away! for the scenes we leave behind us\r\n  Are barren for the lights of home and a flame that’s young forever;\r\n  And the lonely trees around us creak the warning of the night-wind,\r\n  That love and all the dreams of love are away beyond the mountains.\r\n  The songs that call for us to-night, they have called for men before us,\r\n  And the winds that blow the message, they have blown ten thousand years;\r\n  But this will end our wander-time, for we know the joy that waits us\r\n  In the strangeness of home-coming, and a faithful woman’s eyes.\r\n\r\n  “Come away! come away! there is nothing now to cheer us—\r\n  Nothing now to comfort us, but love’s road home:—\r\n  Over there beyond the darkness there’s a window gleams to greet us,\r\n  And a warm heart waits for us within.\r\n\r\n  “Come away! come away!—or the roving-fiend will hold us,\r\n  And make us all to dwell with him to the end of human faring:\r\n  There are no men yet can leave him when his hands are clutched upon them,\r\n  There are none will own his enmity, there are none will call him brother.\r\n  So we’ll be up and on the way, and the less we brag the better\r\n  For the freedom that God gave us and the dread we do not know:—\r\n  The frost that skips the willow-leaf will again be back to blight it,\r\n  And the doom we can not fly from is the doom we do not see.\r\n\r\n  “Come away! come away! there are dead men all around us—\r\n  Frozen men that mock us with a wild, hard laugh\r\n  That shrieks and sinks and whimpers in the shrill November rushes,\r\n  And the long full wind on the lake.”\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson has written in this little volume not verse but poetry.\r\nWhether he has the power of sustained flight remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CENTRAL JUVENILE REFORMATORY COMMITTEE, AT THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  DECEMBER 15, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nAbout all I can say to you is to express my very hearty sympathy with\r\nand belief in your purpose. The time of my life when I was brought into\r\nclosest touch with conditions similar to those which you are trying to\r\nremedy was while I was Police Commissioner in New York City. At that\r\ntime my closest friend and associate in all of my work was Mr. Jacob\r\nRiis, with whose books and writings you are all more or less familiar.\r\nI was even more impressed than I have been all along, ever since I have\r\ngrown up, with the fact that if you are going to do anything permanent\r\nfor the average man you have got to begin before he is a man. The older\r\nman is almost impossible to reform. Of course there are exceptional\r\nindividuals, men who have been completely changed, not only after they\r\nhave reached years of manhood, but after very advanced periods of life.\r\nBut speaking generally, the chance of success lies in working with the\r\nboy and not with the man. That applies peculiarly to those boys who\r\ntend to drift off into courses which mean that unless they are checked\r\nthey will be formidable additions to the criminal population when\r\nthey grow older. It is eminently worth while to try to prevent those\r\nboys becoming criminals, to try to prevent their being menaces to and\r\nexpenses and sores in society, while there is a chance of reforming\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA year ago I was approached by the people interested in Colorado in\r\ntheir juvenile court, and they set an example which I wish could be\r\nfollowed all over the country, and particularly here in the District of\r\nColumbia. To the people of Colorado I expressed, as I express to you,\r\nmy very earnest belief in their work, and told them that “of course\r\nso far as my very limited powers here go those powers will be at your\r\ndisposal.”\r\n\r\nI think people rather often completely misapprehend what are really\r\nthe important questions. The question of the tariff, the currency, or\r\neven the regulation of railroad rates, are all subordinate to the great\r\nbasic moral movements which mean the preservation of the individual in\r\nhis or her relations to the home; because if the homes are all straight\r\nthe State will take care of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE BOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND OTHERS, AT\r\n  THE WHITE HOUSE, DECEMBER 18, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Macfarland; Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar pleasure to greet this body here to-day. As Mr.\r\nMacfarland has well said, the public-school system of our country is\r\nthe most characteristically democratic and American feature of our\r\nnational life. It has been my good fortune that all of my children have\r\nreceived, or are receiving, a portion of their education in the public\r\nschools of this District, in this city; and I feel that the advantage\r\nto them is incalculable. I certainly do not underrate the importance\r\nof the higher education. It would be the greatest misfortune if we\r\never permitted such a warped and twisted view of democracy to obtain\r\nas would be implied in a denial of the advantage that comes to the\r\nwhole Nation from the high education of the few who are able to take\r\nadvantage of the opportunity to acquire it. But while fully admitting\r\nthis, it remains true that most important of all is the education of\r\nthe common school. The public schools are not merely the educational\r\ncentres for the mass of our people, but they are the factories of\r\nAmerican citizenship. Incidentally to its other work the public school\r\ndoes more than any other institution of any kind, sort, or description\r\nto Americanize the child of foreign-born parents who comes here when\r\nyoung, or is born here. Nothing else counts for as much in welding\r\ntogether into one compact mass of citizenship the different race stocks\r\nwhich here are being fused into a new nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE COMMUNICATED TO THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS, JANUARY 8, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI enclose herewith the annual report of the Isthmian Canal Commission,\r\nthe annual report of the Panama Railroad Company, and the Secretary of\r\nWar’s letter transmitting the same, together with certain papers.\r\n\r\nThe work on the Isthmus is being admirably done, and great progress\r\nhas been made, especially during the last nine months. The plant is\r\nbeing made ready and the organization perfected. The first work to\r\nbe done was the work of sanitation, the necessary preliminary to the\r\nwork of actual construction; and this has been pushed forward with\r\nthe utmost energy and means. In a short while I shall lay before you\r\nthe recommendations of the Commission and of the Board of Consulting\r\nEngineers as to the proper plan to be adopted for the canal itself,\r\ntogether with my own recommendations thereon. All the work so far has\r\nbeen done, not only with the utmost expedition, but in the most careful\r\nand thorough manner; and what has been accomplished gives us good\r\nreason to believe that the canal will be dug in a shorter time than had\r\nbeen anticipated, and at an expenditure within the estimated amount.\r\nAll our citizens have a right to congratulate themselves upon the high\r\nstandard of efficiency and integrity which has been hitherto maintained\r\nby the representatives of the Government in doing this great work. If\r\nthis high standard of efficiency and integrity can be maintained in the\r\nfuture at the same level which it has now reached, the construction of\r\nthe Panama Canal will be one of the feats to which the people of this\r\nRepublic will look back with the highest pride.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time various publications have been made, and from time\r\nto time in the future various similar publications doubtless will\r\nbe made, purporting to give an account of jobbery, or immorality,\r\nor inefficiency, or misery, as obtaining on the Isthmus. I have\r\ncarefully examined into each of these accusations which seemed worthy\r\nof attention. In every instance the accusations have proved to be\r\nwithout foundation in any shape or form. They spring from several\r\nsources. Sometimes they take the shape of statements by irresponsible\r\ninvestigators of a sensational habit of mind, incapable of observing\r\nor repeating with accuracy what they see, and desirous of obtaining\r\nnotoriety by widespread slander. More often they originate with, or\r\nare given currency by, individuals with a personal grievance. The\r\nsensation-mongers, both those who stay at home and those who visit\r\nthe Isthmus, may ground their accusations on false statements by\r\nsome engineer, who, having applied for service on the Commission and\r\nbeen refused such service, now endeavors to discredit his successful\r\ncompetitors; or by some lessee or owner of real estate who has sought\r\naction or inaction by the Commission to increase the value of his\r\nlots, and is bitter because the Commission can not be used for such\r\npurposes; or on the tales of disappointed bidders for contracts; or of\r\noffice-holders who have proved incompetent, or who have been suspected\r\nof corruption and dismissed, or who have been overcome by panic and\r\nhave fled from the Isthmus. Every specific charge relating to jobbery,\r\nto immorality, or to inefficiency, from whatever source it has come,\r\nhas been immediately investigated, and in no single instance have the\r\nstatements of these sensation-mongers and the interested complainants\r\nbehind them proved true. The only discredit inhering in these false\r\naccusations is to those who originate and give them currency, and who,\r\nto the extent of their abilities, thereby hamper and obstruct the\r\ncompletion of the great work in which both the honor and the interest\r\nof America are so deeply involved. It matters not whether those guilty\r\nof these false accusations utter them in mere wanton recklessness and\r\nfolly or in a spirit of sinister malice to gratify some personal or\r\npolitical grudge.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to cut down the salaries of the officials of the Isthmian\r\nCommission, or of their subordinates who are doing important work,\r\nwould be ruinous from the standpoint of accomplishing the work\r\neffectively. To quote the words of one of the best observers on the\r\nIsthmus: “Demoralization of the service is certain if the reward for\r\nsuccessful endeavor is a reduction of pay.” We are undertaking in\r\nPanama a gigantic task—the largest piece of engineering ever done.\r\nThe employment of the men engaged thereon is only temporary, and yet\r\nit will require the highest order of ability if it is to be done\r\neconomically, honestly, and efficiently. To attempt to secure men\r\nto do this work on insufficient salaries would amount to putting a\r\npremium upon inefficiency and corruption. Men fit for the work will\r\nnot undertake it unless they are well paid. In the end the men who\r\ndo undertake it will be left to seek other employment with as their\r\nchief reward the reputations they achieve. Their work is infinitely\r\nmore difficult than any private work, both because of the peculiar\r\nconditions of the tropical land in which it is laid, and because it\r\nis impossible to free them from the peculiar limitations inseparably\r\nconnected with Government employment; while it is unfortunately\r\ntrue that men engaged on public work, no matter how devoted and\r\ndisinterested their services, must expect to be made the objects of\r\nmisrepresentation and attack. At best, therefore, the positions are not\r\nattractive in proportion to their importance; and among the men fit\r\nto do the task, only those with a genuine sense of public spirit and\r\neager to do the great work for the work’s sake, can be obtained; and\r\nsuch men can not be kept if they are to be treated with niggardliness\r\nand parsimony, in addition to the certainty that false accusations will\r\ncontinually be brought against them.\r\n\r\nI repeat that the work on the Isthmus has been done and is being done\r\nadmirably. The organization is good. The mistakes are extraordinarily\r\nfew, and these few have been of practically no consequence. The zeal,\r\nintelligence, and efficient public service of the Isthmian Commission\r\nand its subordinates have been noteworthy. I court the fullest, most\r\nexhaustive, and most searching investigation of any act of theirs, and\r\nif any one of them is ever shown to have done wrong his punishment\r\nshall be exemplary. But I ask that they be decently paid, and that\r\ntheir hands be upheld as long as they act decently. On any other\r\nconditions we shall not be able to get men of the right type to do the\r\nwork; and this means that on any other conditions we shall ensure, if\r\nnot failure, at least delay, scandal, and inefficiency in the task of\r\ndigging the giant canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL\r\n  ASSOCIATION, AT THE WHITE HOUSE, JANUARY 10, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI want to say just a word of greeting to you and to ask your influence\r\non behalf of the medical corps, not only of the Army, but of the Navy.\r\nThere is not a more exacting profession; there is not a profession\r\nwhich makes greater demands upon those following it, and which more\r\nentitles them to the gratitude of mankind, than is the profession which\r\nis yours. The Army surgeon has to combine the work of your profession\r\nwith the work of the military man of the line. In saying that, I want\r\nto call your attention to two specific things; one thing that is now\r\nbeing done by men of your profession and one need of men of your\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nFirst, the thing that is being done: All the United States is the\r\ndebtor to the medical men who have accomplished such remarkable work\r\non the Isthmus of Panama. You hear very loose talk about making the\r\ndirt fly in Panama. Before making the dirt fly it was necessary to get\r\nthe microbes under; it was necessary to grapple with the mosquitoes;\r\nnecessary to eradicate disease. That has been done to perfection. We\r\nhave had the foundation laid for that wonderful piece of constructive\r\nengineering work, to dig the giant canal. Too much praise can not be\r\ngiven to those who have done this work in Panama. So much for tribute\r\nto your compeers. Now as to the need of your compeers. You recollect\r\nthe complaint made about hygienic conditions during the war with\r\nSpain. Complaint was made that the troops were not properly treated,\r\netc. The blame rested, not on any one man then in office, but upon our\r\npeople as a whole who had declined, through their representatives, to\r\nmake provision long in advance for meeting such a need. If we had a\r\nwar break out to-morrow and had to raise any large army, there would\r\nbe an immediate breakdown in the medical department simply because\r\nat present our medical corps is numerically only fit to take care of\r\nabout forty per cent of the Regular Army as it is now. The medical\r\ncorps is not numerically fit to grapple with a campaign in which our\r\nwhole Army as it is, the little Army as it is, should be employed. And\r\nof course if we had to mobilize an army of volunteers we would under\r\npresent conditions have to count upon widespread disaster through the\r\nshortcomings in the medical and sanitary and hygienic arrangements\r\nrendered inevitable by our present lack of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have given us a good lesson in this as in many other\r\nparticulars, by the way they handled their army in the recent war.\r\nOne of the reasons why their medical department did well—the main\r\nreason—was the fact that they had an ample supply of doctors who had\r\nbeen practiced in time of peace in doing the duties they would have to\r\ndo in war. And until we have provision for an ample corps of doctors\r\nin the Army so that they can be practiced in time of peace we will not\r\nhave prepared as we ought to prepare for the possibilities of war.\r\nUntil we thus prepare we can make up our minds that we are ourselves\r\nresponsible for any disaster that occurs to any army that the United\r\nStates may raise in the future; not the man who may be at the head\r\nof the Army at the time. The tendency is to attack the men in office\r\nat the time. That is utterly unjust, and the people themselves, and\r\nthe representatives of the people in public life, who have failed\r\nto provide the necessary means in advance—they are responsible when\r\ndisaster comes. That applies to the medical department, and it applies\r\nto every other branch of the military establishment just as much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE INTERSTATE NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION, AT THE\r\n  WHITE HOUSE, JANUARY 22, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_Senator Dick; Members of the Association_:\r\n\r\nI trust it is hardly necessary for me to say what a genuine pleasure it\r\nis to me to-day to greet this organization. I have been a member of the\r\nNational Guard myself, and both at the time when I was Governor (as\r\nthe present Assistant Secretary of War can say) and since I have been\r\nPresident, and even when I was Assistant Secretary of the Navy, I have\r\nalways done all that in me lay to further the interests of the National\r\nGuard.\r\n\r\nI have a good many things on hand, but one of the things that are\r\ninteresting me most at present, Senator Dick, is the encouragement of\r\nrifle practice to the National Guard. I want to have it understood,\r\ngentlemen, that I do not care anything like as much for how your\r\nregiments march and perform parade-ground and armory maneuvres as I\r\ncare for how they are instructed in the work that would make them\r\nvaluable as soldiers in time of war. I earnestly hope that the National\r\nGuard, and, Mr. Taft, the Regular Army also, especially the Regular\r\nArmy, will more and more have the kind of instruction that will make\r\nit second nature for the man who marches to march fully equipped as he\r\nwould be in time of war. If he is trained to march that way he will\r\nnot throw away his equipment the first time he goes to war; otherwise\r\nhe will do it. I want to see the average National Guardsman know how\r\nto shoot well. I want to see the fund that we have for rifle practice\r\ndistributed among the several State organizations, partly at least\r\nwith reference to the way in which those State organizations promote\r\nmarksmanship. I want to see the young fellow who has been through the\r\nNational Guard receive a training which will make him able to do his\r\nwork in time of war if the need comes.\r\n\r\nIn a great industrial civilization such as ours we may just as well\r\nface the fact that there is a constant tendency to do away with, to\r\neliminate, those qualities which make a man a good soldier. It should\r\nbe the steady object of every legislator, of every executive officer,\r\nand above all of you gentlemen who have to do with the National Guard,\r\nto try to encourage those qualities, to try to counteract the tendency\r\ntoward their elimination. Every officer of the National Guard should\r\ntrain his men the whole time as if he were training them with a view to\r\npossible action, so that the men under him will be trained by him to\r\nhave those habits of body and mind which will render them formidable\r\nas soldiers in the field. You should try to train your men so they can\r\nlive in the open; train them so they will know what cover is, so they\r\nwill be able to take advantage of it, so they will know how to march\r\nand march well; and you should realize the relative importance of what\r\nit is that the men under you learn, that as war is carried on nowadays,\r\nninety per cent of the ordinary work done either on the parade-ground\r\nor in the armory, either by a militia regiment or a regular regiment,\r\namounts to nothing whatever in the way of training except so far as\r\nthe incidental effect it has in accustoming the men to act together\r\nand to obey; but they are not going to fight shoulder to shoulder when\r\nthey get out into the field. It is absolutely not of the slightest\r\nconsequence what their alignment is, but is of vital consequence that\r\nthey shall know how to take cover, how to shoot, and how to make\r\nthemselves at home under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe have such a small regular army that you men of the National Guard\r\nhave upon you a heavy responsibility. I want to say that while it is\r\nincumbent upon you to take your duties seriously and do them with all\r\nyour heart, if you do even that you do more good to the Nation than any\r\nequal body of citizens to be found in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE STUDENTS OF THE MANASSAS, VIRGINIA, INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, AT THE\r\n  WHITE HOUSE, FEBRUARY 14, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Hale_; _Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar pleasure to me to greet you to-day; and no body of our\r\nfellow-citizens can have a greater claim to being received at the White\r\nHouse than a body like this, which stands for the fundamental duty of\r\nAmerican citizenship—the duty of self-education. I am, of course, as we\r\nall must be, peculiarly interested in the kind of development of which,\r\nI am glad to say, I think we can accept this school as typical—not\r\nas exceptional, but as typical. There are a great many very, very\r\nexcellent charitable people in the country, but some of them tend to\r\nforget at times that the only charity that does permanent good is that\r\nkind of charity that is not a charity at all, that teaches some one\r\nhow to help himself or herself. The only way in which any section of\r\nour citizens, of no matter what color, can be permanently benefited is\r\nby teaching them to pull their own weight, to do their own duty, their\r\nduty to themselves, their duty to their neighbors, their duty to the\r\nState at large. I have felt about the schools of which this is a type\r\nas I feel, for instance, about Mr. Washington’s school at Tuskegee,\r\nthat one of the reasons they are so good is that they can serve as an\r\nexample of schools of which we should try to develop as many as we can\r\nfor the white people as well as for the colored people. The white man\r\nneeds just as much as the colored man to learn that for the average man\r\nthe education that fits him to do work in life is industrial. Other\r\nthings shall be added to it, or ought to be added to it, but that must\r\nremain as the basis.\r\n\r\nOf course, Miss Dean, the good that comes with any such school as this\r\nis increased tenfold when the school is founded, as you founded this,\r\nand as Mr. Washington founded Tuskegee, by a colored man or colored\r\nwoman to help the colored boys and colored girls of to-day to make the\r\nbest type of self-respecting, self-supporting American citizens of the\r\nfuture. I esteem it an honor to welcome you here this afternoon, and it\r\nis a very fitting thing that you should be introduced by the American\r\ncitizen whom every good American delights to honor—Rev. Edward Everett\r\nHale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE COMMUNICATED TO THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS, FEBRUARY 19, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith the letter of the Secretary of War transmitting the\r\nreport of the Board of Consulting Engineers on the Panama Canal, and\r\nthe report of the Isthmian Canal Commission thereon, together with\r\na letter written to the Chairman of the Isthmian Canal Commission\r\nby Chief Engineer Stevens. Both the Board of Consulting Engineers\r\nand the Canal Commission divide in their report. The majority of the\r\nBoard of Consulting Engineers, eight in number, including the five\r\nforeign engineers, favor a sea-level canal; and one member of the\r\nCanal Commission, Admiral Endicott, takes the same view. Five of the\r\neight American members of the Board of Consulting Engineers and five\r\nmembers of the Isthmian Canal Commission favor the lock canal, and so\r\ndoes Chief Engineer Stevens. The Secretary of War recommends a lock\r\ncanal pursuant to the recommendation of the minority of the Board of\r\nConsulting Engineers and of the majority of the Canal Commission.\r\nAfter careful study of the papers submitted and full and exhaustive\r\nconsideration of the whole subject, I concur in this recommendation.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the American engineers on the consulting board\r\nand on the commission by a more than two to one majority favor the\r\nlock canal, whereas the foreign engineers are a unit against it.\r\nI think this is partly to be explained by the fact that the great\r\ntraffic canal of the Old World is the Suez Canal, a sea-level canal,\r\nwhereas the great traffic canal of the New World is the Sault Ste.\r\nMarie Canal, a lock canal. Although the latter, the Soo, is closed to\r\nnavigation during the winter months, it carries annually three times\r\nthe traffic of the Suez Canal. In my judgment the very able argument\r\nof the majority of the Board of Consulting Engineers is vitiated\r\nby their failure to pay proper heed to the lessons taught by the\r\nconstruction and operation of the Soo Canal. It must be borne in mind,\r\nas the Commission points out, that there is no question of building\r\nwhat has been picturesquely termed “the Straits of Panama”; that is,\r\na waterway through which the largest vessels could go with safety at\r\nuninterrupted high speed. Both the sea-level canal and the proposed\r\nlock canal would be too narrow and shallow to be called with any\r\ntruthfulness a strait, or to have any of the properties of a wide, deep\r\nwater strip. Both of them would be canals, pure and simple. Each type\r\nhas certain disadvantages and certain advantages. But in my judgment\r\nthe disadvantages are fewer and the advantages very much greater in the\r\ncase of a lock canal substantially as proposed in the papers forwarded\r\nherewith; and I call especial attention to the fact that the Chief\r\nEngineer, who will be mainly responsible for the success of this mighty\r\nengineering feat, and who has therefore a peculiar personal interest\r\nin judging aright, is emphatically and earnestly in favor of the\r\nlock-canal project and against the sea-level project.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the reports seems to establish a strong probability\r\nthat the following are the facts: The sea-level canal would be slightly\r\nless exposed to damage in the event of war; the running expenses, apart\r\nfrom the heavy cost of interest on the amount employed to build it,\r\nwould be less; and for small ships the time of transit would probably\r\nbe less. On the other hand, the lock canal at a level of eighty feet\r\nor thereabout would not cost much more than half as much to build and\r\ncould be built in about half the time, while there would be very much\r\nless risk connected with building it, and for large ships the transit\r\nwould be quicker; while, taking into account the interest on the amount\r\nsaved in building, the actual cost of maintenance would be less.\r\nAfter being built it would be easier to enlarge the lock canal than\r\nthe sea-level canal. Moreover, what has been actually demonstrated in\r\nmaking and operating the great lock canal, the Soo, a more important\r\nartery of traffic than the great sea-level canal, the Suez, goes\r\nto support the opinion of the minority of the Consulting Board of\r\nEngineers and of the majority of the Isthmian Canal Commission as to\r\nthe superior safety, feasibility, and desirability of building a lock\r\ncanal at Panama.\r\n\r\nThe law now on our statute books seems to contemplate a lock canal. In\r\nmy judgment a lock canal as herein recommended is advisable. If the\r\nCongress directs that a sea-level canal be constructed its direction\r\nwill of course be carried out. Otherwise the canal will be built on\r\nsubstantially the plan for a lock canal outlined in the accompanying\r\npapers, such changes being made of course as may be found actually\r\nnecessary; including possibly the change recommended by the Secretary\r\nof War as to the site of the dam on the Pacific side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE COMMUNICATED TO THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS, MARCH 5, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOur coast defences as they existed in 1860 were not surpassed\r\nin efficiency by those of any country, but within a few years\r\nthe introduction of rifled cannon and armor in the navies of the\r\nworld, against which the smoothbore guns were practically useless,\r\nrendered them obsolete. For many years no attempt was made to remedy\r\nthe deficiencies of these seacoast fortifications. There was no\r\nestablishment in the country equipped for the manufacture of high-power\r\nrifled guns; there was no definite adopted policy of coast defence, and\r\nCongress was reluctant to undertake a work the cost of which could not\r\nbe stated even approximately and the details of which had not advanced,\r\nso far as could be ascertained, beyond the experimental stages.\r\n\r\nThe Act of March 3, 1883, was the first decisive step taken to secure\r\nsuitable and adequate ordnance for military purposes. Under the\r\nprovisions of this act a joint board of officers of the Army and\r\nNavy was appointed “for the purpose of examining and reporting to\r\nCongress which of the navy-yards or arsenals owned by the Government\r\nhas the best location and is best adapted for the establishment of a\r\nGovernment foundry, or what other method, if any, should be adopted for\r\nthe manufacture of heavy ordnance adapted to modern warfare for the\r\nuse of the Army and Navy of the United States.” This board, known as\r\nthe “Gun Foundry Board,” made its report in 1884 and directed public\r\nattention not only to the defenceless condition of our coasts, but to\r\nthe importance and necessity of formulating a comprehensive scheme for\r\nthe protection of our harbors and coast cities.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Act of Congress approved March 3, 1885, provided that\r\n“the President of the United States shall appoint a board ... which\r\nboard shall examine and report at what ports fortifications or other\r\ndefences are most urgently required, the character and kind of defences\r\nbest adapted to each with reference to armament, the utilization of\r\ntorpedoes, mines, and other defensive appliances.”\r\n\r\nThe board, organized under the foregoing provision of law, popularly\r\nknown as the “Endicott Board,” in its report of January 23, 1886, cited\r\nthe principles on which any system of coast defence should be based,\r\nand clearly stated the necessity of having our important strategic and\r\ncommercial centres made secure against naval attack. In determining\r\nthe ports that were in urgent need of defence, since a fleet did not\r\nexist for the protection of the merchant marine, fortifications were\r\nprovided at every harbor of importance along the coast and at several\r\nof the lake ports. For any particular harbor or locality the report\r\nspecifies the armament considered necessary for proper protection, the\r\ncharacter of emplacements to be used, the number of submarine mines and\r\ntorpedo boats, with detailed estimates of cost for these various items.\r\nThe proposed guns, mounts, and emplacements were of types that seemed\r\nat that time best suited to accomplish the desired results, based on\r\nthe only data available, namely, experiments and information of similar\r\nwork from abroad.\r\n\r\nAfter the report was made part of the public records, the development\r\nand adoption of a suitable disappearing gun carriage caused the\r\nsubstitution of open emplacements for the expensive turrets and armored\r\ncasements, materially reducing the cost of installing the armament.\r\nThe great advances in ordnance, increasing the power and range of\r\nthe later guns, caused a diminution in the number and calibre of the\r\npieces to be mounted, and this fact, combined with advances in the\r\nscience of engineering, rendered unnecessary the construction of the\r\nexpensive “floating batteries” designed by the Endicott Board for\r\nmounting guns to give sufficient fire for the defence of wide channels\r\nor for harbors where suitable foundations could not be secured on land.\r\nFurthermore, keeping pace with the gradual development and improvement\r\nin the engines and implements of war, fortified harbors are equipped\r\nwith rapid-fire guns, and, to a certain extent, with power plants,\r\nsearchlights, and a system of fire control and direction, now essential\r\nadjuncts of a complete system of defence, though not so considered by\r\nthat board.\r\n\r\nWhile the details of the scheme of defence recommended by the\r\nEndicott Board have been departed from, in making provision for later\r\ndevelopments of war material, the great value of its report lies in\r\nthe fact that it sets forth a definite and intelligible plan or policy\r\nupon which the very important work of coast defence should proceed, and\r\nwhich is as applicable to-day as when formulated.\r\n\r\nThe greater effective ranges possible with the later rifled cannon, the\r\nnecessity of thoroughly covering with gun fire all available waters of\r\napproach, and the growth of seacoast towns beyond the limits of some\r\nof the military reservations, have combined to move defensive works\r\nmore to the front, and many of the gun positions now occupied have been\r\nobtained from private ownership. The cost of such sites has been a\r\nlarge item in the present cost of fortifications, and this purchase of\r\nland was not included in its estimates by the Endicott Board.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the report also discloses the fact that no estimates\r\nwere submitted covering a supply of ammunition to be kept in reserve\r\nfor the services of the guns that were recommended, due, perhaps, to\r\nthe fact that a satisfactory powder to give the energy desired and a\r\nsuitable projectile to accomplish the desired destruction of armor were\r\nstill in experimental stages. These questions, however, are no longer\r\nin doubt, and Congress already has made provision for some of the\r\nammunition needed.\r\n\r\nThe omissions in the estimates of the Endicott Board and the changes in\r\nthe details of its plans have caused doubts in the minds of many as to\r\nthe money that will be needed to defend completely our coasts by guns,\r\nmines, and their adjuncts. New localities are pressing their claims for\r\ndefence. The insular possessions can not be held unless the principal\r\nports, naval bases, and coaling stations are fortified before the\r\noutbreak of war. These considerations have led me to appoint a joint\r\nboard of officers of the Army and Navy “to recommend the armament,\r\nfixed and floating, mobile torpedoes, submarine mines, and all other\r\ndefensive appliances that may be necessary to complete the harbor\r\ndefence with the most economical and advantageous expenditures of\r\nmoney.” The board was further instructed “to extend its examinations so\r\nas to include estimates and recommendations relative to defences of the\r\ninsular possessions,” and to “recommend the order in which the proposed\r\ndefence shall be completed, so that all the elements of harbor defence\r\nmay be properly and effectively co-ordinated.”\r\n\r\nThe board has completed its labors, and its report, together with a\r\nletter of transmittal by the Secretary of War, is herewith transmitted\r\nfor the information of the Congress. It is to be noted that the\r\nentrance to Chesapeake Bay, not heretofore recommended or authorized\r\nby Congress, is added to the list of ports in the United States to be\r\ndefended, with the important reasons therefor clearly stated; that the\r\ngun defence proper is well advanced toward completion, and that the\r\ngreater part of the estimate is for new work of gun defence, for the\r\naccessories now so necessary for efficiency, and for an allowance of\r\nammunition which, added to that already on hand, will give the minimum\r\nsupply that should be kept in reserve to successfully meet any sudden\r\nattack. The letter of the Secretary of War contains a comparison of the\r\nestimates of the Endicott Board, with the amounts already appropriated\r\nfor the present defence and the estimates of the new board, from\r\nwhich it appears that a completed defence of our coast, omitting\r\ncost of ammunition and sites, can be accomplished for less than the\r\namount estimated by the Endicott Board, even including the additional\r\nlocalities not recommended by it.\r\n\r\nIn the insular possessions, the great naval bases at Guantanamo,\r\nSubig Bay, and Pearl Harbor, the coaling stations at Guam and San\r\nJuan, require protection, and, in addition, defences are recommended\r\nfor Manila Bay and Honolulu, because of the strategic importance of\r\nthese localities. In the letter of the Secretary of War will be found\r\nthe sums already appropriated for defences at some of these ports\r\nor harbors, and the estimates are for the completion of an adequate\r\ndefence at each locality.\r\n\r\nDefences are recommended for the entrances to the Panama Canal as\r\ncontemplated by the Act of June 28, 1902 (Spooner Act), and under the\r\nterms of this act the cost of such fortifications would probably be\r\npaid from appropriations for the construction and defence of the canal.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for a complete and adequate system of coast defence is\r\ngreater to-day than twenty years ago, for the increased wealth of the\r\ncountry offers more tempting inducements to attack and a hostile fleet\r\ncan reach our coast in a much shorter period of time. The fact that\r\nwe now have a navy does not in any wise diminish the importance of\r\ncoast defences; on the contrary, that fact emphasizes their value and\r\nthe necessity for their construction. It is an accepted naval maxim\r\nthat a navy can be used to strategic advantage only when acting on\r\nthe offensive, and it can be free to so operate only after our coast\r\ndefence is reasonably secure and so recognized by the country. It was\r\ndue to the securely defended condition of the Japanese ports that the\r\nJapanese fleet was free to seek out and watch its proper objective—the\r\nRussian fleet—without fear of interruption or recall to guard its home\r\nports against raids by the Vladivostok squadron. This one of the most\r\nvaluable lessons of the late war in the East is worthy of serious\r\nconsideration by our country, with its extensive coast line, its many\r\nimportant harbors, and its many wealthy manufacturing coast cities.\r\n\r\nThe security and protection of our interests require the completion of\r\nthe defences of our coast, and the accompanying plan merits and should\r\nreceive the generous support of the Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE COMMUNICATED TO THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS, MARCH 7, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have signed the joint resolution “instructing the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission to make examinations into the subject of railroad\r\ndiscriminations and monopolies in coal and oil, and report on the same\r\nfrom time to time.” I have signed it with hesitation because in the\r\nform in which it was passed it achieves very little and may achieve\r\nnothing; and it is highly undesirable that a resolution of this kind\r\nshall become law in such form as to give the impression of insincerity;\r\nthat is, of pretending to do something which really is not done. But\r\nafter much hesitation I concluded to sign the resolution because its\r\ndefects can be remedied by legislation which I hereby ask for; and it\r\nmust be understood that unless this subsequent legislation is granted\r\nthe present resolution must be mainly, and may be entirely, inoperative.\r\n\r\nBefore specifying what this legislation is, I wish to call attention\r\nto one or two preliminary facts. In the first place, a part of the\r\ninvestigation requested by the House of Representatives in the\r\nresolution adopted February 15, 1905, relating to the oil industry,\r\nand a further part having to do with the anthracite coal industry, has\r\nbeen for some time under investigation by the Department of Commerce\r\nand Labor. These investigations, I am informed, are approaching\r\ncompletion, and before Congress adjourns I shall submit to you the\r\npreliminary reports of these investigations. Until these reports\r\nare completed the Interstate Commerce Commission could not endeavor\r\nto carry out so much of the resolution of Congress as refers to the\r\nground thus already covered without running the risk of seeing the two\r\ninvestigations conflict, and therefore render each other more or less\r\nnugatory. In the second place, I call your attention to the fact that\r\nif an investigation of the nature proposed in this joint resolution\r\nis thoroughly and effectively conducted, it will result in giving\r\nimmunity from criminal prosecution to all persons who are called, sworn\r\nand constrained by compulsory process of law to testify as witnesses;\r\nthough of course such immunity from prosecution is not given to those\r\nfrom whom statements or information, merely, in contradistinction to\r\nsworn testimony, is obtained. This is not at all to say that such\r\ninvestigations should not be undertaken. Publicity can by itself often\r\naccomplish extraordinary results for good; and the court of public\r\njudgment may secure such results where the courts of law are powerless.\r\nThere are many cases where an investigation securing complete publicity\r\nabout abuses and giving Congress the material on which to proceed in\r\nthe enactment of laws, is more useful than a criminal prosecution can\r\npossibly be. But it should not be provided for by law without a clear\r\nunderstanding that it may be an alternative instead of an additional\r\nremedy; that is, that to carry on the investigation may serve as a bar\r\nto the successful prosecution of the offences disclosed. The official\r\nbody directed by Congress to make the investigation must, of course,\r\ncarry out its direction, and therefore the direction should not be\r\ngiven without full appreciation of what it means.\r\n\r\nBut the direction contained in the joint resolution which I have signed\r\nwill remain almost inoperative unless money is provided to carry out\r\nthe investigations in question, and unless the Commission in carrying\r\nthem out is authorized to administer oaths and compel the attendance of\r\nwitnesses. As the resolution now is, the Commission, which is very busy\r\nwith its legitimate work and which has no extra money at its disposal,\r\nwould be able to make the investigation only in the most partial and\r\nunsatisfactory manner; and moreover it is questionable whether it\r\ncould, under this resolution, administer oaths at all or compel the\r\nattendance of witnesses. If this power were disputed by the parties\r\ninvestigated, the investigation would be held up for a year or two\r\nuntil the courts passed upon it, in which case, during the period of\r\nwaiting, the Commission could only investigate to the extent and in the\r\nmanner already provided under its organic law; so that the passage of\r\nthe resolution would have achieved no good result whatever.\r\n\r\nI accordingly recommend to Congress the serious consideration of\r\njust what they wish the Commission to do, and how far they wish it\r\nto go, having in view the possible incompatibility of conducting an\r\ninvestigation like this and of also proceeding criminally in a court\r\nof law; and furthermore, that a sufficient sum, say fifty thousand\r\ndollars, be at once added to the current appropriation for the\r\nCommission so as to enable them to do the work indicated in a thorough\r\nand complete manner; while at the same time the power is explicitly\r\nconferred upon them to administer oaths and compel the attendance of\r\nwitnesses in making the investigation in question, which covers work\r\nquite apart from their usual duties. It seems unwise to require an\r\ninvestigation by a commission and then not to furnish either the full\r\nlegal power or the money, both of which are necessary to render the\r\ninvestigation effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CONSULAR REFORM ASSOCIATION, AT THE WHITE HOUSE, MARCH 14, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that our one chance for getting the consular service\r\nput upon a really effective basis lies with just such organizations as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWe in Washington must rely upon you to make our people, who are\r\npre-eminently a business people—I do not think that is by any means\r\nall they either are or ought to be, but I think they must have and\r\nought to have a very strong business side to them—appreciate that the\r\nconsular service should be in its essence a part of the general scheme\r\nof business development of the country. Of course my own view is that\r\nthat applies to all the affairs of the State Department, and under both\r\nMr. Hay and Mr. Root that Department has been managed and is being\r\nmanaged with an eye single to the good of the country as a whole. I\r\nhave not, I am sorry to say, been able to persuade people thus to\r\nlook upon even such a question as the Santo Domingo Treaty, which is\r\na purely non-partisan measure; for if it was treated as it should be,\r\npurely on its merits, there would not be one shadow of opposition to or\r\ncriticism of it. But while we have not yet been successful in getting\r\nthe work of the Department looked upon quite in the non-partisan spirit\r\nthat should be our national attitude in foreign affairs, and have not\r\nbeen successful in getting the consular service made by law what we\r\nstrive to have it made—an absolutely non-partisan service—still we\r\nhave made a certain amount of progress, and with the help of you and\r\nthose like you, we shall be able to make a great deal more progress.\r\nOne point let me dwell upon. You can not expect to get permanently\r\ngood service when that service is unattractive and ill-paid. We have\r\nhad a great deal of difficulty with our consular service in China.\r\nIt came partly because men were appointed for political reasons,\r\nwith scant regard to their qualifications, partly because men found\r\nthemselves in remote Eastern ports where there was not much that made\r\nlife attractive, where there was very little supervision over them, and\r\nyet great temptation. Gentlemen, we all know that under such conditions\r\nit is necessarily difficult to secure honest and efficient service. We\r\nmade a pretty thorough clean-up there. But we can not keep the service\r\nas high as it should be kept unless we have adequate salaries. There\r\nmust be a better monetary provision for our consuls. I think that\r\nsome such scheme as that so admirably advocated by Mr. Loomis, whose\r\nexperience peculiarly fits him to speak on the subject, of charging a\r\ngraded fee for invoices would furnish a solution. But in any event,\r\nin some way or other, we should provide for better salaries for the\r\nconsuls, for better facilities for doing their work. Remember that the\r\ndearest kind of public servant is a servant who is paid so cheaply\r\nthat he must render cheap service. Also, I feel most strongly that in\r\nthe consular service, which stands entirely apart from the diplomatic\r\nservice proper, entrance should be made by law into the lower grades\r\nand that the higher grades should be filled by a gradual process of\r\nweeding out and promotion; remembering, gentlemen, that the weeding-out\r\nprocess must not be interfered with. It is not any too easy, at best,\r\nto get rid of a kindly-natured elderly incompetent, and if you add to\r\nthe difficulty by law, he then stays permanently. Make the entrance\r\nto the service as far as possible non-partisan and make it at the\r\nlower grades, so that desirable positions shall come to those who have\r\nrendered good and faithful service in the lower grades, so that those\r\nentering the lower grades shall feel that if they do well they have a\r\nlong and worthy career ahead of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMITTEE AND ASSISTANT COMMITTEES ON DEPARTMENT METHODS, AT THE\r\nRESIDENCE OF MR. PINCHOT, WASHINGTON, MARCH 20, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI wish to express my very great appreciation of the work that you are\r\ndoing. It would be a good thing for certain critics of our Government\r\nto realize the amount of hard, disinterested work for the Government\r\nrepresented by this gathering to which I am now speaking—a work which\r\nmust in the immense majority of cases be its own reward, and therefore\r\nan ample reward; for there is nothing pleasanter than the consciousness\r\nof having done well a bit of work well worth doing.\r\n\r\nA year ago I appointed the Keep Commission, because I had become\r\nconvinced that the business methods of our Government were by no means\r\nabreast of the times. While I think there is comparatively little\r\ncorruption in the National Governmental service, and while that little\r\nI intend to cut out or have cut out through other agencies than yours,\r\nit yet remains true that there is a good deal of duplication of work,\r\na good deal of clumsiness of work, and above all, the inevitable\r\ntendency toward mere bureaucratic methods against which every\r\nGovernment official should be perpetually on his guard—the tendency to\r\nregard not the case, but the papers in the case, as the all-important\r\nmatter with which to deal, and to feel a proud sense of duty performed\r\nif all those papers are appropriately docketed and referred and minutes\r\nmade about them, and then referred back, without regard to what has\r\nbecome of the real fact at issue.\r\n\r\nAs you are aware, the Keep Commission sent out questions to those\r\nresponsible for the actual work in all branches of the Government\r\nservice. Answers were received, or are now being received, to\r\nthose questions, and they furnish a useful aid to the study by the\r\ncommission of Governmental conditions. But inevitably in the great\r\nmajority of cases these answers are inadequate to form a basis for\r\ndefinite recommendations, and of course that is what I want from\r\nthis commission. I do not want a diagnosis of the case; I want a\r\nrecommendation how to reach the case. I do not want merely to know that\r\nthings are bad; I want to know what is bad and what is to be done to\r\nmake it better, so that if legislation is necessary I can recommend\r\nit, or if, as I hope will be true in the enormous majority of cases,\r\nthe matter can be reached by executive regulation, I can see that that\r\nregulation is issued. I want to say right here, gentlemen, that I shall\r\nvalue the reports that I receive largely in proportion as they do not\r\ncall for legislation. There is nothing easier, as all of you know,\r\nthan to draw up an elaborate minute to show how well things would go\r\non if some one else did something different. I want you, so far as is\r\npossible, to recommend something that I can do, something that the\r\nheads of the departments can do, so that we can ourselves put a stop\r\nto much at least of the evil that exists, remedy much at least of the\r\nshortcomings that exist.\r\n\r\nWith this in view, a number of assistant committees were appointed,\r\nconsisting of you gentlemen here, carefully chosen men from the\r\nGovernment service, who are already largely responsible for the\r\nefficiency of the work done in your several departments and bureaus. It\r\nwas a compliment to choose you, gentlemen; though it is one of those\r\ncompliments that take the form of imposition of additional labor.\r\nIf you were not of the type that I know you to be it would not be a\r\ncompliment that would be appreciated. These committees, you gentlemen,\r\nhave been at work for about a month, and you are taking up your work\r\nwithin your specific fields through study of the data already collected\r\nby the Committee on Department Methods, through bringing before you\r\nmen whose knowledge is of expert value, and above all by a thorough\r\nstudy on the ground by experts (for that is what you are) of the\r\nconditions and needs within the departments themselves. I shall not\r\nenumerate the different committees. They are now at work. You compose\r\nthem, gentlemen, and all told they have a membership of about seventy\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, your particular effectiveness lies in the fact that\r\nyou are dealing at first hand with work with which you are thoroughly\r\nfamiliar. You are not outsiders. You are not engaged in constructing\r\na parlor theory of how the work should be done; you are engaged in\r\nrecommendations to better the business which you are yourselves to\r\ncarry through and see made better when those recommendations have been\r\nadopted. You have literally an unparalleled opportunity for useful\r\nwork. As far as I am aware, there has never before been made in this\r\ncountry, or indeed, in any country, such a comprehensive systematic\r\neffort to put the country’s housekeeping in order. I need not say to\r\nyou that it is urgent. A great deal of our Government work has become\r\nproverbial for the red tape involved. Of course much of the outside\r\ncriticism upon red tape is due to forgetfulness of the fact that you\r\nand I are responsible to Congress for every dollar we spend, and\r\nfor every dollar’s worth of work that we do, while the outsider is\r\nresponsible only to himself or those interested with him, so that we\r\nnot only have to do what is right and efficient, but have to be able to\r\nshow that what we have done is right and efficient; and this inevitably\r\nmeans that there must be certain forms observed which the unthinking\r\noutsider is apt to stigmatize as red tape. Nevertheless it is true\r\nthat there is always a tendency in Government work to run to needless\r\nred tape. I asked the Keep Commission, for instance, to take up with\r\nparticular care, through the Assistant Secretaries of War and the\r\nNavy, the burden of paper work resting on the officers of the Army and\r\nNavy. I remember very well the pride with which a certain high officer\r\nin one of the bureaus in the Navy Department, a good many years ago,\r\ntold me, pointing to a big case of papers, that in that he could find\r\nout through the reports of the officers of each battleship how many\r\nbottles of violet ink each captain of a battleship was responsible for.\r\nI remarked that I did not care a snap of my finger about the number\r\nof bottles of violet ink on the ship, that what I wanted to know was\r\nwhether the men at the guns could shoot; I did not accept the knowledge\r\nof the whereabouts of the violet ink as a substitute for shooting. The\r\npaper work must be subordinated in the departments and bureaus to the\r\nefficiency of the work itself, keeping only enough of it to make a\r\nrecord of what is done.\r\n\r\nOf course it is impossible to set any actual time limit to the work\r\nyou are doing, but it would be a mighty good thing to inaugurate the\r\nnext fiscal year by adopting the new policies and methods in the\r\ndepartmental business. I want to assure you of one thing, and that is\r\nthat your mere appointment has already produced a very marked moral\r\neffect. The good results of seventy men studying local methods and\r\nlocal needs on the ground, in the departments, does not lie only in\r\nthe knowledge gained; you render a great service by making the men\r\nwith whom you come in contact feel that they actually share in this\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe most magnificent architecture that our race has ever been able to\r\nproduce—the great Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages—were made, not\r\nby any known architect, not even by any number of architects whose\r\nnames have ever been recorded. We do not know the name of an architect\r\nor builder connected with those great masterpieces. Each was made by\r\na number of men, architects and builders, each of whom felt amply\r\nrewarded by the mere fact that he was able to put all the best that\r\nthere was in him into his work. He did not care to have his name known,\r\nhe did not desire to be immortalized in connection with the work; he\r\ncared only to make the work itself the best that it could possibly be\r\nmade. There never was an army that amounted to anything in campaign or\r\nin battle unless the average soldier had in him the spirit which made\r\nhim regard the winning of the campaign, the winning of the battle,\r\nas in itself the end, and his service, if good enough, as in itself\r\nthe reward. He might wish other rewards if they happened to come; but\r\nif they did not, well and good. The doing the duty is of itself a\r\nsufficient reward for any man.\r\n\r\nSo it has to be if the work of the Government is to be really well\r\ndone. As Ruskin has said, there are two ways of doing work; to work\r\nfor the fee, for the payment, and to work for the work’s own sake. The\r\nwork done simply to get money for having done it will never, under\r\nany circumstances, rank with the work done by the man whose sense\r\nof self-respect, whose capacity for loyalty to an ideal, makes him\r\ndiscontented unless the work that is at his hand is done with all the\r\nskill that heart and hand and brain can bring to it.\r\n\r\nOf course, gentlemen, when you come to make your recommendations,\r\nyou will have to deal with broad principles for the conduct of the\r\nGovernment business; but those broad principles must be supported by\r\ndefinite plans ready to be given immediate effect. I believe in broad\r\nprinciples, but I do not want them so broad that they will not apply to\r\nany given case. I want a general scheme, but also a way to make that\r\ngeneral scheme effective in each department, each bureau, each section\r\nand subdivision touched by your committee. I do not want you in any\r\ncase to recommend a change simply for the sake of making a change;\r\nnothing could be more foolish. But never hesitate for a moment in\r\nbasing your recommendations upon the conditions actually found and the\r\nbest way to meet them, no matter how radical may be the departure from\r\nestablished methods required. As I have said before, remember that in\r\nthe vastly larger number of cases the essential need will not be for\r\nnew legislation, but for better organization and improved methods under\r\nexisting law. Now and then you will find where there must be a change\r\nin law, but the essential thing will be to change methods so that we\r\ncan better administer the existing law.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one fundamental weakness in the Government service\r\nwhich can not be remedied without additional legislation. That\r\nweakness lies in the faulty distribution of work among the different\r\ndepartments. It is one of the most serious of all the obstacles to\r\ngood executive work, to effective work, and to economy in the public\r\nservice. No matter how well a bureau or division may be organized\r\nand directed, you can not get the best work out of it unless it is\r\nassociated with, and co-operating with, the other bureaus and divisions\r\nwhich are engaged in cognate lines of work and with which it naturally\r\nbelongs. Good teamwork is as much needed in the executive civil service\r\nas it can possibly be anywhere else. And it is the only way to prevent\r\nduplication of work. Your own work is most important, but it covers\r\nonly half of the field. To put the departments on the best and most\r\neconomical working basis the President, as I have already recommended,\r\nshould be given power to transfer any part of the work of a department\r\nto another department, as was done in the case of the Department of\r\nCommerce and Labor.\r\n\r\nIn closing I wish to say a word of acknowledgment of the\r\npublic-spirited and most valuable co-operation of the American\r\nAssociation of Public Accountants, which has been promised to the\r\nCommittee on Department Methods. I wish to thank them, and I wish to\r\nthank you, gentlemen, for the invaluable work that you are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND THE\r\n  REPRESENTATIVES OF LABOR ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, AT THE EXECUTIVE\r\n  OFFICE, MARCH 21, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIf your body objects to the passage of the proposed anti-injunction\r\nbill, I have no question that you can stop it, for there is not a\r\ncapitalist concerned who simply as capitalist is not against it; though\r\nI believe that a goodly number both of capitalists and wage-workers\r\nwho are concerned primarily as citizens favor it. The law was worked\r\nover and substantially whipped into its present shape at a number of\r\nconferences between representatives of the railroad organizations, of\r\nthe Department of Justice, and of the Bureau of Corporations with me.\r\nIt goes as far as I personally think it should go in limiting the right\r\nof injunction; at any rate, no arguments have hitherto been advanced\r\nwhich make me think it should go farther. I do not believe it has any\r\nchance of passing, because there has been great criticism in both\r\nHouses of Congress against the attitude of the Administration in going\r\nso far as we have gone; and if you think it is not far enough, why,\r\nyou will have no earthly difficulty in killing the bill. Personally,\r\nI think the proposed law a most admirable one, and I very sincerely\r\nwish it would be put through. As for the right of injunction, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to have this power lodged in the courts; though\r\nof course any abuse of the power is strongly to be reprobated. During\r\nthe four and a half years that I have been President I do not remember\r\nan instance where the Government has invoked the right of injunction\r\nagainst a combination of laborers. We have invoked it certainly a score\r\nof times against combinations of capital; I think possibly oftener.\r\nThus, though we have secured the issuance of injunctions in a number of\r\ncases against capitalistic combinations, it has happened that we have\r\nnever tried to secure an injunction against a combination of labor.\r\nBut understand me, gentlemen; if I ever thought it necessary, if I\r\nthought a combination of laborers were doing wrong, I would apply for\r\nan injunction against them just as quick as against so many capitalists.\r\n\r\nNow I come to the general subject of your petition. I wish in the\r\nfirst place to state my regret that you did not divorce so much of\r\nthe petition as refers to the action of the Executive from so much\r\nas refers to the action of the legislative branch, because I can not\r\nconsider any petition that you make that reflects upon the co-ordinate\r\nbranch of the Government, or that makes any charges whatever against\r\nit. I would not even receive it save for the fact that in part it\r\naffects the Executive. Therefore in what I have to say I shall limit\r\nmyself solely to what you assert in reference to the acts of the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nYou speak of the eight-hour law. Your criticism, so far as it relates\r\nto the Executive, bears upon the signature of the appropriation bill\r\ncontaining the money for expenditure on the Panama Canal, with\r\nthe proviso that the eight-hour law shall not there apply. If your\r\nstatement is intended to mean that no opportunity was given for a\r\nhearing before me, then the statement is not in accordance with the\r\nfacts. There was ample opportunity, but not a single request for such a\r\nhearing came to me. I received, however, some hundreds of telegrams and\r\nletters requesting the veto of the entire appropriation bill because\r\nit contained that proviso. Frankly, I found it difficult to believe\r\nthat you were writing and telegraphing with any kind of knowledge of\r\nthe conditions in the case. I believe emphatically in the eight-hour\r\nlaw for our own people in our own country. But the conditions of\r\nlabor, such as we have to work with in the tropics, are so absolutely\r\ndifferent that there is no possible analogy between them; and an\r\neight-hour law for the Panama Canal is an absurdity. Every one of you\r\nknows that we can not get white labor, can not get labor of the United\r\nStates, to go down to Panama and work. We are driven to extremities\r\nin the effort to get any kind of labor at all. Just at the moment we\r\nare working chiefly with negro labor from the West Indies. The usual\r\nresult in the employment of those men is that Monday and Tuesday they\r\nwork fairly well, Wednesday and Thursday there is a marked falling\r\noff, and by Friday and Saturday not more than a half, sometimes less\r\nthan a fourth, of the laborers will be at work. The conditions that\r\nmake the eight-hour law proper here have no possible reference to\r\nthe conditions that make the eight-hour law entirely improper there.\r\nThe conditions are so utterly different on the Isthmus, as compared\r\nto here, that it is impossible to try to draw conclusions affecting\r\nthe one from what is true about the other. You hamper me in the effort\r\nto get for you what I think you ought to have in connection with the\r\neight-hour law, when you make a request that is indefensible, and to\r\ngrant which would mean indefinite delay and injury to the work on the\r\nIsthmus.\r\n\r\nAs to the violations of the eight-hour law, Mr. Morrison, you give me\r\nno specifications. At your earliest convenience please lay before me\r\nin detail any complaints you have of violations of the eight-hour law.\r\nWhere I have power I will see that the law is obeyed. All I ask is that\r\nyou give me the cases. I will take them up, and if they prove to be\r\nsustained by the facts I shall see that the law is enforced.\r\n\r\nNow, about the Chinese exclusion. The number of Chinese now in this\r\ncountry is, if I remember aright, some sixty or seventy thousand. So\r\nfar from there being a great influx of the Chinese, the fact is that\r\nthe number has steadily decreased. There are fewer Chinese than there\r\nwere ten years ago, fewer than there were twenty years ago, fewer\r\nthan there were thirty years ago. Unquestionably some scores of cases\r\noccur each year where Chinese laborers get in either by being smuggled\r\nover the Mexican and Canadian borders, or by coming in under false\r\ncertificates; but the steps that we have taken, the changes in the\r\nconsuls that have been made within the last few years in the Orient,\r\nand the effort to conduct examinations in China before the immigrants\r\nare allowed to come here, are materially reducing even the small number\r\nof cases that do occur. But even as it is the number of these cases\r\nis insignificant. There is no appreciable influx of Chinese laborers,\r\nand there is not the slightest or most remote danger of any; the whole\r\nscare that has been worked up on the subject is a pure chimera. It is\r\nmy deep conviction that we must keep out of this country every Chinese\r\nlaborer, skilled or unskilled—every Chinaman of the coolie class. This\r\nis what the proposed law will do; it will be done as effectively as\r\nunder the present law; and the present law is being handled with the\r\nutmost efficiency. But I will do everything in my power to make it easy\r\nand desirable for the Chinese of the business and professional classes,\r\nthe Chinese travelers and students, to come here, and I will do all\r\nI can to secure their good treatment when they come; and no laboring\r\nman has anything whatever to fear from that policy. I have a right to\r\nchallenge you as good American citizens to support that policy; and in\r\nany event I shall stand unflinchingly for it; and no man can say with\r\nsincerity that on this, or indeed on any other point, he has any excuse\r\nfor misunderstanding my policy.\r\n\r\nYou have spoken of the immigration laws. I believe not merely that all\r\npossible steps should be taken to prevent the importation of laborers\r\nunder any form, but I believe further that this country ought to make\r\na resolute effort from now on to prevent the coming to the country of\r\nmen with a standard of living so low that they tend, by entering into\r\nunfair competition with, to reduce the standard of living of our own\r\npeople. Not one of you can go farther than I will go in the effort\r\nsteadily to raise the status of the American wage-worker, so long as,\r\nwhile doing it, I can retain a clear conscience and the certainty that\r\nI am doing what is right. I will do all in my power for the laboring\r\nman except to do what is wrong; and I will not do that for him or for\r\nany one else.\r\n\r\nWe must not let our national sentiment for succoring the oppressed and\r\nunfortunate of other lands lead us into that warped moral and mental\r\nattitude of trying to succor them at the expense of pulling down our\r\nown people. Laws should be enacted to keep out all immigrants who do\r\nnot show that they have the right stuff in them to enter into our life\r\non terms of decent equality with our own citizens. This is needed,\r\nfirst, in the interest of the laboring man, but furthermore in the\r\ninterests of all of us as American citizens; for, gentlemen, the bonds\r\nthat unite all good American citizens are stronger by far than the\r\ndifferences, which I think you accentuate altogether too much, between\r\nthe men who do one kind of labor and the men who do another. As for\r\nimmigrants, we can not have too many of the right kind; and we should\r\nhave none at all of the wrong kind; and they are of the right kind if\r\nwe can be fairly sure that their children and grandchildren can meet\r\non terms of equality our children and grandchildren, so as to try to be\r\ndecent citizens together and to work together for the uplifting of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nNow a word as to the petitioning of employees to Congress. That stands\r\nin no shape or way on a par with the petitioning of men not employed by\r\nthe Government. I can not have and will not have when I can prevent it\r\nmen who are concerned in the administration of Government affairs going\r\nto Congress and asking for increased pay, without the permission of the\r\nheads of the departments. Their business is to come through the heads\r\nof departments. This applies to postmasters, to Army and Navy officers,\r\nto clerks in the Government departments, to laborers; it applies to\r\neach and all, and must apply, as a matter of simple discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL PLAYGROUNDS COUNCILS AT THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  APRIL 12, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI trust that it is not necessary for me to say what a pleasure it is\r\nto meet you and how very earnest and hearty my sympathy is with your\r\npurpose. I owed my first interest in the playground question, among\r\na great many other things, to Jacob Riis when he spoke of the poor\r\nchildren who were not allowed to play in the streets, but had to play\r\nin the streets as they had no other place to play. I have felt very\r\nkeenly the need of playgrounds, and of course as the children grow\r\nolder, the need of athletic grounds. In expressing my adherence to what\r\nyou have said, Dr. Gulick, as to the need of helping adapt the plays,\r\nand of course the playgrounds and athletic grounds, to the needs of\r\nthe citizenship of city life, let me add just one thing, which, I am\r\nsure, it is hardly necessary for me to say; and that is to remember\r\nthat in trying to shape the plays for the children you must previously\r\nconsult the children’s wishes. You must try to take advantage of their\r\ninitiative and simply help in shaping it in the proper direction. One\r\nof the chief difficulties that all of us have encountered who have\r\ntried to help, whether in establishing playgrounds for children, or\r\nin establishing hotels for young women, or houses where working girls\r\ncould live, or clubs, which instead of being saloons should be coffee\r\nclubs, for men, has arisen from the fact that philanthropists often\r\nestablish such excellent but minute and overprecautionary regulations\r\nthat nobody will inhabit them. As far as possible let the children\r\nwork out their own salvation in their own way; simply exercise such\r\nsupervision as to see that they do not do harm. Remember that in the\r\nlast analysis the play has to suit them and not us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GERMAN VETERANS, AT THE WHITE HOUSE, APRIL 12, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\nI welcome you here, my fellow-Americans; for among the many strains\r\nthat go to make up our composite race stock in this country, no strain\r\nhas given us better Americans than those who are of German birth or\r\nblood. It is our peculiar pride as a nation that in this Republic we\r\nhave measurably realized the ideal under which good citizens know no\r\ndiscrimination as between creed and creed, birthplace and birthplace,\r\nprovided only that whatever the man’s parentage may have been, whatever\r\nthe way in which he worships his Creator, he strives in good faith\r\nto do his duty by himself and by his fellow-men and to show his\r\nunflinching loyalty to our common country. In addition to thus greeting\r\nyou, my fellow-Americans of German birth, I wish also to greet the\r\nGerman citizens present, the members of the German army, belonging to\r\nthe reserve of that army, and to welcome them here; especially Mr.\r\nAmbassador, as they are brought here by you, yourself an old soldier,\r\nwho have endeared yourself to the American people by your hearty\r\nfriendship for this country.\r\n\r\nThe reverence a man preserves for his native land, so far from standing\r\nin the way of his loving and doing his full duty by the land of his\r\nadoption, should help him toward this love and the performance of this\r\nduty. If a man is a good son he is apt to make a good husband; and the\r\nquality that makes a man reverence the country of his birth is apt to\r\nbe the quality that makes him a good citizen in the country of his\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nThe ties that unite Germany and the United States are many and close,\r\nand it must be a prime object of our statesmanship to knit the\r\ntwo nations ever closer together. In no country is there a warmer\r\nadmiration for Germany and for Germany’s exalted ruler, Emperor\r\nWilliam, than here in America.\r\n\r\nIt is not out of place in closing for me to say a word of\r\ncongratulation both to the German people and the German Emperor upon\r\nthe work that has been accomplished in the Algeciras convention which\r\nhas just closed, a conference held chiefly because of the initiative\r\nof Germany. It was not a conference in which we Americans as a nation\r\nhad much concern, save that it is always our concern to see justice\r\nobtained everywhere, and, so far as we properly can, to work for\r\nthe cause of international peace and good-will. In its outcome this\r\nconference has added to the likelihood of the betterment of conditions\r\nin Morocco itself, has secured equitable dealing as among the foreign\r\nPowers who have commercial relations with Morocco, and has diminished\r\nthe chance of friction between these Powers. In particular it may\r\nnot be out of place for me to say that I hope and believe that the\r\nconference has resulted and will result in rendering continually more\r\nfriendly the relations between the mighty Empire of Germany and the\r\nmighty Republic of France; for it is my hope and wish, as it must be\r\nthe hope and wish of every sincere well wisher of humankind, that these\r\nfriendly relations may not only continue unbroken but may ever grow in\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within the\r\n  text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added, when a\r\n  predominant preference was found in the original book.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,\r\n  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n  Pg 453: ‘est’ replaced by ‘lest’.\r\n  Pg 549: ‘contribue’ replaced by ‘contribute’.\r\n  Pg 584: ‘corrupton’ replaced by ‘corruption’\r\n  Pg 634: ‘poiliticians’ replaced by ‘politicians’\r\n  Pg 689: ‘Feburary’ replaced by ‘February’\r\n  Pg 711: ‘obtain’ replaced by ‘obtained’",
