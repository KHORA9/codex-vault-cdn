EXCERPTS FROM THE WILL AND TESTAMENT OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All-praise to Him Who, by the Shield of His Covenant, hath...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll-praise to Him Who, by the Shield of His Covenant, hath guarded the\r\nTemple of His Cause from the darts of doubtfulness, Who by the Hosts of\r\nHis Testament hath preserved the Sanctuary of His Most Beneficent Law and\r\nprotected His Straight and Luminous Path, staying thereby the onslaught of\r\nthe company of Covenant-breakers, that have threatened to subvert His\r\nDivine Edifice; Who hath watched over His Mighty Stronghold and\r\nAll-glorious Faith, through the aid of men whom the slander of the\r\nslanderer affects not, whom no earthly calling, glory and power can turn\r\naside from the Covenant of God and His Testament, established firmly by\r\nHis clear and manifest words, writ and revealed by His All-glorious Pen\r\nand recorded in the Preserved Tablet.\r\n\r\nSalutation and praise, blessing and glory rest upon that primal branch of\r\nthe Divine and Sacred Lote-Tree, grown out, blest, tender, verdant and\r\nflourishing from the Twin Holy Trees; the most wondrous, unique and\r\npriceless pearl that doth gleam from out the twin surging seas; upon the\r\noffshoots of the Tree of Holiness, the twigs of the Celestial Tree, they\r\nthat in the Day of the Great Dividing have stood fast and firm in the\r\nCovenant; upon the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of God that have diffused\r\nwidely the Divine Fragrances, declared His Proofs, proclaimed His Faith,\r\npublished abroad His Law, detached themselves from all things but Him,\r\nstood for righteousness in this world, and kindled the Fire of the Love of\r\nGod in the very hearts and souls of His servants; upon them that have\r\nbelieved, rested assured, stood steadfast in His Covenant and followed the\r\nLight that after my passing shineth from the Dayspring of Divine\r\nGuidance--for behold! he is the blest and sacred bough that hath branched\r\nout from the Twin Holy Trees. Well is it with him that seeketh the shelter\r\nof his shade that shadoweth all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O ye beloved of the Lord! The greatest of all things is the...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! The greatest of all things is the protection of\r\nthe True Faith of God, the preservation of His Law, the safeguarding of\r\nHis Cause and service unto His Word. Ten thousand souls have shed streams\r\nof their sacred blood in this path, their precious lives they offered in\r\nsacrifice unto Him, hastened wrapt in holy ecstasy unto the glorious field\r\nof martyrdom, upraised the Standard of God's Faith and writ with their\r\nlife-blood upon the Tablet of the world the verses of His Divine Unity.\r\nThe sacred breast of His Holiness, the Exalted One, (may my life be a\r\nsacrifice unto Him) was made a target to many a dart of woe, and in\r\nMazandaran, the Blessed feet of the Abha Beauty (may my life be offered up\r\nfor His loved ones) were so grievously scourged as to bleed and be sore\r\nwounded. His neck also was put into captive chains and His feet made fast\r\nin the stocks. In every hour, for a period of fifty years, a new trial and\r\ncalamity befell Him and fresh afflictions and cares beset Him. One of\r\nthem: after having suffered intense vicissitudes, He was made homeless and\r\na wanderer and fell a victim to still new vexations and troubles. In\r\n'Iraq, the Day-Star of the world was so exposed to the wiles of the people\r\nof malice as to be eclipsed in splendor. Later on He was sent an exile to\r\nthe Great City (Constantinople) and thence to the Land of Mystery\r\n(Adrianople), whence, grievously wronged, He was eventually transferred to\r\nthe Most Great Prison (Akka). He Whom the world hath wronged (may my life\r\nbe offered for His loved ones) was four times banished from city to city,\r\ntill at last condemned to perpetual confinement, He was incarcerated in\r\nthis Prison, the prison of highway robbers, of brigands and of manslayers.\r\nAll this is but one of the trials that have afflicted the Blessed Beauty,\r\nthe rest being even as grievous as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"According to the direct and sacred command of God we are...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the direct and sacred command of God we are forbidden to\r\nutter slander, are commanded to show forth peace and amity, are exhorted\r\nto rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness and harmony with all the\r\nkindreds and peoples of the world. We must obey and be the well-wishers of\r\nthe governments of the land, regard disloyalty unto a just king as\r\ndisloyalty to God Himself and wishing evil to the government a\r\ntransgression of the Cause of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O God, my God! Thou seest this wronged servant of Thine,...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Thou seest this wronged servant of Thine, held fast in the\r\ntalons of ferocious lions, of ravening wolves, of bloodthirsty beasts.\r\nGraciously assist me, through my love for Thee, that I may drink deep of\r\nthe chalice that brimmeth over with faithfulness to Thee and is filled\r\nwith Thy bountiful Grace; so that, fallen upon the dust, I may sink\r\nprostrate and senseless whilst my vesture is dyed crimson with my blood.\r\nThis is my wish, my heart's desire, my hope, my pride, my glory. Grant, O\r\nLord my God, and my Refuge, that in my last hour, my end, may even as musk\r\nshed its fragrance of glory! Is there a bounty greater than this? Nay, by\r\nThy Glory! I call Thee to witness that no day passeth but that I quaff my\r\nfill from this cup, so grievous are the misdeeds wrought by them that have\r\nbroken the Covenant, kindled discord, showed their malice, stirred\r\nsedition in the land and dishonored Thee amidst Thy servants. Lord! Shield\r\nThou from these Covenant-breakers the mighty Stronghold of Thy Faith and\r\nprotect Thy secret Sanctuary from the onslaught of the ungodly. Thou art\r\nin truth the Mighty, the Powerful, the Gracious, the Strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of self and\r\npassion, protect them with the watchful eye of Thy loving kindness from\r\nall rancour, hate and envy, shelter them in the impregnable stronghold of\r\nThy Cause and, safe from the darts of doubtfulness, make them the\r\nmanifestations of Thy glorious Signs, illumine their faces with the\r\neffulgent rays shed from the Dayspring of Thy Divine Unity, gladden their\r\nhearts with the verses revealed from Thy Holy Kingdom, strengthen their\r\nloins by Thy all-swaying power that cometh from Thy Realm of Glory. Thou\r\nart the All-bountiful, the Protector, the Almighty, the Gracious!\r\n\r\nO ye that stand fast in the Covenant! When the hour cometh that this\r\nwronged and broken winged bird will have taken its flight unto the\r\ncelestial concourse, when it will have hastened to the Realm of the Unseen\r\nand its mortal frame will have been either lost or hidden neath the dust,\r\nit is incumbent upon the Afnan, that are steadfast in the Covenant of God,\r\nand have branched from the Tree of Holiness; the Hands, (pillars) of the\r\nCause of God, (the glory of the Lord rest upon them), and all the friends\r\nand loved ones, one and all to bestir themselves and arise with heart and\r\nsoul and in one accord, to diffuse the sweet savors of God, to teach His\r\nCause and to promote His Faith. It behooveth them not to rest for a\r\nmoment, neither to seek repose. They must disperse themselves in every\r\nland, pass by every clime and travel throughout all regions. Bestirred,\r\nwithout rest and steadfast to the end they must raise in every land the\r\ntriumphal cry \"O Thou the Glory of Glories!\" (Ya-Baha'u'l-Abha), must\r\nachieve renown in the world wherever they go, must burn brightly even as a\r\ncandle in every meeting and must kindle the flame of Divine love in every\r\nassembly; that the light of truth may rise resplendent in the midmost\r\nheart of the world, that throughout the East and throughout the West a\r\nvast concourse may gather under the shadow of the Word of God, that the\r\nsweet savors of holiness may be diffused, that faces may shine radiantly,\r\nhearts be filled with the Divine spirit and souls be made heavenly.\r\n\r\nIn these days, the most important of all things is the guidance of the\r\nnations and peoples of the world. Teaching the Cause is of utmost\r\nimportance for it is the head corner-stone of the foundation itself. This\r\nwronged servant has spent his days and night in promoting the Cause and\r\nurging the peoples to service. He rested not a moment, till the fame of\r\nthe Cause of God was noised abroad in the world and the celestial strains\r\nfrom the Abha Kingdom roused the East and the West. The beloved of God\r\nmust also follow the same example. This is the secret of faithfulness,\r\nthis is the requirement of servitude to the Threshold of Baha!\r\n\r\nThe disciples of Christ forgot themselves and all earthly things, forsook\r\nall their cares and belongings, purged themselves of self and passion and\r\nwith absolute detachment scattered far and wide and engaged in calling the\r\npeoples of the world to the Divine Guidance, till at last they made the\r\nworld another world, illumined the surface of the earth and even to their\r\nlast hour proved self-sacrificing in the pathway of that Beloved One of\r\nGod. Finally in various lands they suffered glorious martyrdom. Let them\r\nthat are men of action follow in their footsteps!\r\n\r\nO my loving friends! After the passing away of this wronged one, it is\r\nincumbent upon the A_gh_san (Branches), the Afnan (Twigs) of the Sacred\r\nLote-Tree, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of God and the loved ones of\r\nthe Abha Beauty to turn unto Shoghi Effendi--the youthful branch branched\r\nfrom the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees and the fruit grown from the\r\nunion of the two offshoots of the Tree of Holiness,--as he is the sign of\r\nGod, the chosen branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, he unto whom all\r\nthe A_gh_san, the Afnan, the Hands of the Cause of God and His loved ones\r\nmust turn. He is the expounder of the words of God and after him will\r\nsucceed the first-born of his lineal descendants.\r\n\r\nThe sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, as well\r\nas the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected and\r\nestablished, are both under the care and protection of the Abha Beauty,\r\nunder the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the Exalted One\r\n(may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of\r\nGod. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God;\r\nwhoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God;\r\nwhoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath\r\ncontended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso\r\ndenieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in\r\nGod; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath\r\nin truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God. May the\r\nwrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him! The\r\nmighty stronghold shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to\r\nhim who is the guardian of the Cause of God. It is incumbent upon the\r\nmembers of the House of Justice, upon all the A_gh_san, the Afnan, the\r\nHands of the Cause of God to show their obedience, submissiveness and\r\nsubordination unto the guardian of the Cause of God, to turn unto him and\r\nbe lowly before him. He that opposeth him hath opposed the True One, will\r\nmake a breach in the Cause of God, will subvert His word and will become a\r\nmanifestation of the Center of Sedition. Beware, beware, lest the days\r\nafter the ascension (of Baha'u'llah) be repeated when the Center of\r\nSedition waxed haughty and rebellious and with Divine Unity for his excuse\r\ndeprived himself and perturbed and poisoned others. No doubt every\r\nvainglorious one that purposeth dissension and discord will not openly\r\ndeclare his evil purposes, nay rather, even as impure gold, would he seize\r\nupon divers measures and various pretexts that he may separate the\r\ngathering of the people of Baha. My object is to show that the Hands of\r\nthe Cause of God must be ever watchful and so soon as they find anyone\r\nbeginning to oppose and protest against the guardian of the Cause of God\r\ncast him out from the congregation of the people of Baha and in no wise\r\naccept any excuse from him. How often hath grievous error been disguised\r\nin the garb of truth, that it might sow the seeds of doubt in the hearts\r\nof men!\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon the guardian of the Cause\r\nof God to appoint in his own life-time him that shall become his\r\nsuccessor, that differences may not arise after his passing. He that is\r\nappointed must manifest in himself detachment from all worldly things,\r\nmust be the essence of purity, must show in himself the fear of God,\r\nknowledge, wisdom and learning. Thus, should the first-born of the\r\nguardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself the truth of the\r\nwords:--\"The child is the secret essence of its sire,\" that is, should he\r\nnot inherit of the spiritual within him (the guardian of the Cause of God)\r\nand his glorious lineage not be matched with a goodly character, then must\r\nhe (the guardian of the Cause of God), choose another branch to succeed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number nine\r\npersons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in\r\nthe work of the guardian of the Cause of God. The election of these nine\r\nmust be carried either unanimously or by majority from the company of the\r\nHands of the Cause of God and these, whether unanimously or by a majority\r\nvote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the guardian of\r\nthe Cause of God hath chosen as his successor. This assent must be given\r\nin such wise as the assenting and dissenting voices may not be\r\ndistinguished. (secret ballot)\r\n\r\nO friends! The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed\r\nby the guardian of the Cause of God. All must be under his shadow and obey\r\nhis command. Should any, within or without the company of the Hands of the\r\nCause of God disobey and seek division, the wrath of God and His vengeance\r\nwill be upon him, for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nThe obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine\r\nFragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the\r\ncharacter of all men and to be, at all times and under all conditions,\r\nsanctified and detached from earthly things. They must manifest the fear\r\nof God by their conduct, their manners, their deeds and their words.\r\n\r\nThis body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the direction of the\r\nguardian of the Cause of God. He must continually urge them to strive and\r\nendeavor to the utmost of their ability to diffuse the sweet savors of\r\nGod, and to guide all the peoples of the world, for it is the light of\r\nDivine Guidance that causeth all the universe to be illumined. To\r\ndisregard, though it be for a moment, this absolute command which is\r\nbinding upon everyone, is in no wise permitted, that the existent world\r\nmay become even as the Abha Paradise, that the surface of the earth may\r\nbecome heavenly, that contention and conflict amidst peoples, kindreds,\r\nnations and governments may disappear, that all the dwellers on earth may\r\nbecome one people and one race, that the world may become even as one\r\nhome. Should differences arise they shall be amicably and conclusively\r\nsettled by the Supreme Tribunal, that shall include members from all the\r\ngovernments and peoples of the world.\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! In this sacred Dispensation, conflict and\r\ncontention are in no wise permitted. Every aggressor deprives himself of\r\nGod's grace. It is incumbent upon everyone to show the utmost love,\r\nrectitude of conduct, straightforwardness and sincere kindliness unto all\r\nthe peoples and kindreds of the world, be they friends or strangers. So\r\nintense must be the spirit of love and loving-kindness, that the stranger\r\nmay find himself a friend, the enemy a true brother, no difference\r\nwhatsoever existing between them. For universality is of God and all\r\nlimitations earthly. Thus man must strive that his reality may manifest\r\nvirtues and perfections, the light whereof may shine upon everyone. The\r\nlight of the sun shineth upon all the world and the merciful showers of\r\nDivine Providence fall upon all peoples. The vivifying breeze reviveth\r\nevery living creature and all beings endued with life obtain their share\r\nand portion at His heavenly board. In like manner, the affections and\r\nloving-kindness of the servants of the One True God must be bountifully\r\nand universally extended to all mankind. Regarding this, restrictions and\r\nlimitations are in no wise permitted.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O my loving friends! Consort with all the peoples, kindreds and\r\nreligions of the world with the utmost truthfulness, uprightness,\r\nfaithfulness, kindliness, good-will and friendliness; that all the world\r\nof being may be filled with the holy ecstasy of the grace of Baha, that\r\nignorance, enmity, hate and rancor may vanish from the world and the\r\ndarkness of estrangement amidst the peoples and kindreds of the world may\r\ngive way to the Light of Unity. Should other peoples and nations be\r\nunfaithful to you show your fidelity unto them, should they be unjust\r\ntoward you show justice towards them, should they keep aloof from you\r\nattract them to yourself, should they show their enmity be friendly\r\ntowards them, should they poison your lives sweeten their souls, should\r\nthey inflict a wound upon you be a salve to their sores. Such are the\r\nattributes of the sincere! Such are the attributes of the truthful.\r\n\r\nAnd now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained as the\r\nsource of all good and freed from all error, it must be elected by\r\nuniversal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its members must be\r\nmanifestations of the fear of God and daysprings of knowledge and\r\nunderstanding, must be steadfast in God's faith and the well-wishers of\r\nall mankind. By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice, that\r\nis, in all countries, a secondary House of Justice must be instituted, and\r\nthese secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the Universal\r\none. Unto this body all things must be referred. It enacteth all\r\nordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy\r\nText. By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the\r\nguardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished\r\nmember for life of that body. Should he not attend in person its\r\ndeliberations, he must appoint one to represent him. Should any of the\r\nmembers commit a sin, injurious to the common weal, the guardian of the\r\nCause of God hath at his own discretion the right to expel him, whereupon\r\nthe people must elect another one in his stead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon you to be submissive...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon you to be submissive to all\r\nmonarchs that are just and show your fidelity to every righteous king.\r\nServe ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty.\r\nShow obedience unto them and be their well-wishers. Without their leave\r\nand permission do not meddle with political affairs, for disloyalty to the\r\njust sovereign is disloyalty to God himself.\r\n\r\nThis is my counsel and the commandment of God unto you. Well is it with\r\nthem that act accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By the Ancient Beauty! This wronged one hath in no wise...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the Ancient Beauty! This wronged one hath in no wise borne nor doth he\r\nbear a grudge against any one; towards none doth he entertain any\r\nill-feeling and uttereth no word save for the good of the world. My\r\nsupreme obligation, however, of necessity, prompteth me to guard and\r\npreserve the Cause of God. Thus, with the greatest regret, I counsel you\r\nsaying:--\"Guard ye the Cause of God, protect His law and have the utmost\r\nfear of discord. This is the foundation of the belief of the people of\r\nBaha (may my life be offered up for them). \"His Holiness, the Exalted One,\r\n(the Bab) is the Manifestation of the Unity and Oneness of God and the\r\nForerunner of the Ancient Beauty. His Holiness the Abha Beauty, (may my\r\nlife be a sacrifice for His steadfast friends) is the Supreme\r\nManifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence. All\r\nothers are servants unto Him and do His bidding.\" Unto the Most Holy Book\r\nevery one must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be\r\nreferred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body, whether\r\nunanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the\r\nPurpose of God himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them\r\nthat love discord, hath shown forth malice and turned away from the Lord\r\nof the Covenant. By this House is meant that Universal House of Justice\r\nwhich is to be elected from all countries, that is, from those parts in\r\nthe East and West where the loved ones are to be found, after the manner\r\nof the customary elections in Western countries such as those of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O ye beloved of the Lord! Strive with all your heart to shield...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! Strive with all your heart to shield the Cause\r\nof God from the onslaught of the insincere, for souls such as these cause\r\nthe straight to become crooked and all benevolent efforts to produce\r\ncontrary results.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! I call Thee, Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, Thy Saints\r\nand Thy Holy Ones, to witness that I have declared conclusively Thy Proofs\r\nunto Thy loved ones and set forth clearly all things unto them, that they\r\nmay watch over Thy Faith, guard Thy Straight Path and protect Thy\r\nResplendent Law. Thou art, verily, the All-knowing, the All-wise!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Whosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh a hindrance to...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh a hindrance to the diffusion of\r\nthe Light of Faith, let the loved ones give them counsel and say: \"Of all\r\nthe gifts of God the greatest is the gift of Teaching. It draweth unto us\r\nthe Grace of God and is our first obligation. Of such a gift how can we\r\ndeprive ourselves? Nay, our lives, our goods, our comforts, our rest, we\r\noffer them all as a sacrifice for the Abha Beauty and teach the Cause of\r\nGod.\" Caution and prudence, however, must be observed even as recorded in\r\nthe Book. The veil must in no wise be suddenly rent asunder. The Glory of\r\nGlories rest upon you.\r\n\r\nO ye the faithful loved ones of 'Abdu'l-Baha! It is incumbent upon you to\r\ntake the greatest care of Shoghi Effendi, the twig that hath branched from\r\nthe fruit given forth by the two hallowed and Divine Lote-Trees, that no\r\ndust of despondency and sorrow may stain his radiant nature, that day by\r\nday he may wax greater in happiness, in joy and spirituality, and may grow\r\nto become even as a fruitful tree.\r\n\r\nFor he is, after 'Abdu'l-Baha, the guardian of the Cause of God, the\r\nAfnan, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause and the beloved of the Lord must\r\nobey him and turn unto him. He that obeyeth him not, hath not obeyed God;\r\nhe that turneth away from him, hath turned away from God and he that\r\ndenieth him, hath denied the True One. Beware lest anyone falsely\r\ninterpret these words, and like unto them that have broken the Covenant\r\nafter the Day of Ascension (of Baha'u'llah) advance a pretext, raise the\r\nstandard of revolt, wax stubborn and open wide the door of false\r\ninterpretation. To none is given the right to put forth his own opinion or\r\nexpress his particular convictions. All must seek guidance and turn unto\r\nthe Center of the Cause and the House of Justice. And he that turneth unto\r\nwhatsoever else is indeed in grievous error.\r\n\r\nThe Glory of Glories rest upon you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO: LETTERS FROM SHOGHI EFFENDI\r\nGUARDIAN OF THE BAHA'I CAUSE\r\nJANUARY 21, 1922-JULY 17, 1932\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 21st, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\nDearly beloved brethren and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:\r\n\r\nAt this early hour when the morning light is just breaking upon the Holy\r\nLand, whilst the gloom of the dear Master's bereavement is still hanging\r\nthick upon the hearts, I feel as if my soul turns in yearning love and\r\nfull of hope to that great company of His loved ones across the seas, who\r\nnow share with us all the agonies of His separation.\r\n\r\nIt is idle for me to emphasize how much the sorrowful ladies of the Holy\r\nHousehold look forward to the work that lies before the friends in the\r\nAmerican continent, who in the past have rendered so glorious a service to\r\nHis Cause and will now, faithful to His special love for them, carry on\r\ntheir mission still more gloriously than ever before. True, the shock has\r\nbeen too terrible and sudden for us all to recover from in so short a\r\ntime, but whenever we recall His Sayings and read His Writings, hope\r\nsprings in our hearts and gives us the peace that no other material\r\ncomfort can give.\r\n\r\nHow well I remember when, more than two years ago, the Beloved Master\r\nturning to a distinguished visitor of His, who was seated by Him in His\r\ngarden, suddenly broke the silence and said:--\"My work is now done upon\r\nthis plane; it is time for me to pass on to the other world.\" Did He not\r\nin more than one occasion state clearly and emphatically:--\"Were ye to know\r\nwhat will come to pass after me, surely would ye pray that my end be\r\nhastened?\" In a Tablet sent to Persia when the storm raised years ago by\r\nthat Committee of Investigation was fiercely raging around Him, when the\r\ndays of His incarceration were at their blackest, He reveals the\r\nfollowing:--\"Now in this world of being, the Hand of Divine Power hath\r\nfirmly laid the foundations of this all-highest Bounty and this wondrous\r\nGift. Gradually whatsoever is latent in the innermost of this Holy Cycle\r\nshall appear and be made manifest, for now is but the beginning of its\r\ngrowth and the dayspring of the revelation of its Signs. Ere the close of\r\nthis Century and of this Age, it shall be made clear and manifest how\r\nwondrous was that Springtide and how heavenly was that Gift!\"\r\n\r\nWith such assuring Utterances and the unmistakable evidences of His sure\r\nand clear knowledge that His end was nigh, is there any reason why the\r\nfollowers of His Faith, the world over, should be perturbed? Are not the\r\nprayers He revealed for us sufficient source of inspiration to every\r\nworker in His Cause? Have not His instructions paved before us the broad\r\nand straight Path of Teaching? Will not His now doubly effective power of\r\nGrace sustain us, strengthen us and confirm us in our work for Him? Ours\r\nis the duty to strive by day and night to fulfill our own obligations and\r\nthen trust in His Guidance and never failing Grace. Unity amongst the\r\nfriends, selflessness in our labors in His Path, detachment from all\r\nworldly things, the greatest prudence and caution in every step we take,\r\nearnest endeavor to carry out only what is His Holy Will and Pleasure, the\r\nconstant awareness of His Presence and of the example of His Life, the\r\nabsolute shunning of whomsoever we feel to be an enemy of the Cause ...\r\nthese, and foremost among them is the need for unity, appear to me as our\r\nmost vital duties, should we dedicate our lives for His service. Should we\r\nin this spirit arise to serve Him, what surer and greater promise have we\r\nthan the one His Glorious Father, Baha'u'llah, gives us in His Most Holy\r\nBook:--\"Verily, We behold you from Our Realm of Effulgent Glory, and shall\r\ngraciously aid whosoever ariseth for the triumph of Our Cause with the\r\nhosts of the Celestial Concourse and a company of Our chosen angels.\"\r\n\r\nHow dearly all the Holy Leaves(1) cherish that memory of the departed\r\nMaster, as He commented upon the fresh tidings that poured in from that\r\ncontinent, admiring the untiring activity of the friends, the complete\r\nsubordination of their material interests to those of the Cause, the\r\nremarkable spread of the Movement in their midst and their staunch\r\nfirmness in the Covenant of Baha'u'llah. It is these encouraging\r\nreflections of the Master about His loved ones in America and the tests\r\nintellectual rather than physical which He said He would send to them to\r\npurify them and make ever brighter than before--it is these comments and\r\npromises of His that make of the Movement in that land such a potential\r\nforce in the world today. The Beloved Master's cable to the friends in\r\nthat region is a clear indication of the presence of those counteracting\r\nforces that may usher in those storms of tests that the Master Himself has\r\nsaid will ultimately be for the good of the Cause in that land.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the ladies of the Sacred Household and we, the rest of His\r\nkindred and family, will pray at His Hallowed Shrine for every one of you\r\nand He will surely watch over and enhance in the course of time that noble\r\npart of His heritage that He has bequeathed to His friends in the Far\r\nWest; friends from whom in return He expects so much and whom He has loved\r\nand still doth love so dearly.\r\n\r\nYour sincere co-worker in His Cause,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nJanuary 21st, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of March 5, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear fellow-workers in the Cause of Baha'u'llah:--\r\n\r\nIt is with words of regret and disappointment that I desire to open this\r\nletter because of my inability, in view of my manifold and pressing\r\nduties, to respond individually and in writing to the many messages of\r\nlove and sympathy and of hope that you have so affectionately sent me\r\nsince our Beloved's passing from this World. I am sure I am voicing the\r\nsentiments of the bereaved ladies of the Household when I say that however\r\ndesirous we may be to correspond separately with every one of you, the\r\ngrave responsibilities and manifold duties now devolved upon us make it\r\nregrettably impossible to express in written messages to every friend what\r\nwe constantly feel in our hearts, and pray for when visiting His sacred\r\nShrine.\r\n\r\nAt this grave and momentous period through which the Cause of God in\r\nconformity with the Divine Wisdom is passing, it is the sacred duty of\r\nevery one of us to endeavor to realize the full significance of this Hour\r\nof Transition, and then to make a supreme resolve to arise steadfastly for\r\nthe fulfilment of our sacred obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mission of the Cause\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat as is the love and paternal care which our beloved Master is\r\nextending to us from on High, and unique as is the Spirit that animates\r\ntoday His servants in the world, yet a great deal will depend upon the\r\ncharacter and efforts of His loved ones on whom now rests the\r\nresponsibility of carrying on His work gloriously after Him. How great is\r\nthe need at this moment when the promised outpourings of His grace are\r\nready to be extended to every soul, for us all to form a broad vision of\r\nthe mission of the Cause to mankind, and to do all in our power to spread\r\nit throughout the world! The eyes of the world, now that the sublime\r\nPersonality of the Master has been removed from this visible plane, are\r\nturned with eager anticipation to us who are named after His name, and on\r\nwhom rests primarily the responsibility to keep burning the torch that He\r\nhas lit in this world. How keenly I feel at this challenging hour in the\r\nhistory of the Cause the need for a firm and definite determination to\r\nsubordinate all our personal likings, our local interests, to the\r\ninterests and requirements of the Cause of God! Now is the time to set\r\naside, nay, to forget altogether, minor considerations regarding our\r\ninternal relationships, and to present a solid united front to the world\r\nanimated by no other desire but to serve and propagate His Cause.\r\n\r\nIt is my firm conviction which I now express with all sincerity and\r\ncandor, that the dignity and unity of the Cause urgently\r\ndemands--particularly throughout the American continent--that the friends\r\nshould in their words and conduct emphasize and give absolute prominence\r\nto the constructive dynamic principles of Baha'u'llah, rather than attach\r\nundue importance to His negative Teachings. With hearts cleansed from the\r\nleast trace of suspicion and filled with hope and faith in what the spirit\r\nof love can achieve, we must one and all endeavor at this moment to forget\r\npast impressions, and with absolute good-will and genuine cooperation\r\nunite in deepening and diffusing the spirit of love and service that the\r\nCause has thus far so remarkably shown to the world. To this attitude of\r\ngood-will, of forbearance and genuine kindness to all, must be added,\r\nhowever, constant but unprovocative vigilance, lest unrestricted\r\nassociation with the peoples of the world should enable the very few who\r\nhave been definitely pronounced by the Master as injurious to the body of\r\nthe Cause, to make a breach in the Movement. Not until, however, an\r\nunmistakable evidence should appear, manifestly revealing the evil motives\r\nof a certain individual or group of individuals, is it advisable to make\r\nthe matter public; for an untimely declaration that shall give rise to\r\nopen differences among the friends is far more detrimental than forbearing\r\nstill further with those who are suspected of evil intentions. As the\r\nMaster so fully and consistently did throughout His lifetime, we must all\r\nmake a supreme effort to pour out a genuine spirit of kindness and hopeful\r\nlove to peoples of various creeds and classes, and must abstain from all\r\nprovocative language that may impede the effect of what true and continued\r\nkindness can produce.\r\n\r\nDoes not 'Abdu'l-Baha wish us, as He looks down upon us with loving\r\nexpectation from His glorious Station, to obliterate as much as possible\r\nall traces of censure, of conflicting discussions, of cooling remarks, of\r\npetty unnecessary observations that impede the onward march of the Cause,\r\nthat damp the zeal of the firm believer and detract from the sublimity of\r\nthe Baha'i Cause in the eyes of the inquirer? In order, however, to insure\r\nfair and quick and vigorous action whenever such an evil activity is\r\nrevealed and has been carefully ascertained, the best and only means would\r\nappear to be, for the careful observer, once he is assured of such an evil\r\naction, and has grown hopeless of the attitude of kindness and\r\nforbearance, to report it quietly to the Spiritual Assembly representative\r\nof the friends in that locality and submit the case to their earnest and\r\nfull consideration. Should the majority of the members of that Assembly be\r\nconscientiously convinced of the case--and this being a national issue\r\naffecting the body of the friends in America--it should, only through the\r\nintermediary of that Assembly, be cautiously communicated to that greater\r\nbody representing all the Assemblies in America, which will in its turn\r\nobtain all the available data from the local Assembly in question, study\r\ncarefully the situation and reserve for itself the ultimate decision. It\r\nmay, if it decides so, refer to the Holy Land for further consideration\r\nand consultation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal and National Spiritual Assemblies\r\n\r\n\r\nThis clearly places heavy responsibilities on the local as well as\r\nnational Assemblies, which in the course of time will evolve, with the\r\nMaster's power and guidance, into the local and national Houses of\r\nJustice. Hence the vital necessity of having a local Spiritual Assembly in\r\nevery locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine,\r\nand of making provision for the indirect election of a Body that shall\r\nadequately represent the interests of all the friends and Assemblies\r\nthroughout the American Continent.\r\n\r\nA perusal of some of the words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha on the\r\nduties and functions of the Spiritual Assemblies in every land (later to\r\nbe designated as the local Houses of Justice), emphatically reveals the\r\nsacredness of their nature, the wide scope of their activity, and the\r\ngrave responsibility which rests upon them.\r\n\r\nAddressing the members of the Spiritual Assembly in Chicago, the Master\r\nreveals the following:--\"Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this\r\nprayer with a heart throbbing with the love of God and a tongue purified\r\nfrom all but His remembrance, that the All-powerful may graciously aid you\r\nto achieve supreme victory:--'O God, my God! We are servants of Thine that\r\nhave turned with devotion to Thy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves\r\nfrom all beside Thee in this glorious Day. We have gathered in this\r\nspiritual assembly, united in our views and thoughts, with our purposes\r\nharmonized to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind. O Lord, our God! Make us the\r\nsigns of Thy Divine Guidance, the Standards of Thy exalted Faith amongst\r\nmen, servants to Thy mighty Covenant. O Thou our Lord Most High!\r\nManifestations of Thy Divine Unity in Thine Abha Kingdom, and resplendent\r\nstars shining upon all regions. Lord! Aid us to become seas surging with\r\nthe billows of Thy wondrous Grace, streams flowing from Thy all-glorious\r\nHeights, goodly fruits upon the Tree of Thy heavenly Cause, trees waving\r\nthrough the breezes of Thy Bounty in Thy celestial Vineyard. O God! Make\r\nour souls dependent upon the Verses of Thy Divine Unity, our hearts\r\ncheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace, that we may unite even as the\r\nwaves of one sea and become merged together as the rays of Thine Effulgent\r\nLight; that our thoughts, our views, our feelings may become as one\r\nreality, manifesting the spirit of union throughout the world. Thou art\r\nthe Gracious, the Bountiful, the Bestower, the Almighty, the Merciful, the\r\nCompassionate.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the Most Holy Book is revealed:--\"The Lord hath ordained that in every\r\ncity a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to\r\nthe number of Baha, and should it exceed this number it does not matter.\r\nIt behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to\r\nregard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on\r\nearth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have\r\nregard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as\r\nthey regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and\r\nseemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away\r\nthat which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O ye that\r\nperceive.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, 'Abdu'l-Baha reveals the following:--\"It is incumbent upon\r\nevery one not to take any step without consulting the Spiritual Assembly,\r\nand they must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding and be\r\nsubmissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well arranged.\r\nOtherwise every person will act independently and after his own judgment,\r\nwill follow his own desire, and do harm to the Cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of\r\nmotive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction\r\nto His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones,\r\npatience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted\r\nThreshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes,\r\nvictory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall be vouchsafed to them. In\r\nthis day, assemblies of consultation are of the greatest importance and a\r\nvital necessity. Obedience unto them is essential and obligatory. The\r\nmembers thereof must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion\r\nfor ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every\r\nmember expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth\r\nhis argument. Should any one oppose, he must on no account feel hurt for\r\nnot until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed. The\r\nshining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing\r\nopinions. If after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously, well and\r\ngood; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a\r\nmajority of voices must prevail.\"\r\n\r\nEnumerating the obligations incumbent upon the members of consulting\r\ncouncils, the Beloved reveals the following:--\"The first condition is\r\nabsolute love and harmony amongst the members of the assembly. They must\r\nbe wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves the Unity\r\nof God, for they are the waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the\r\nstars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the\r\nflowers of one garden. Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be\r\nnon-existent, that gathering shall be dispersed and that assembly be\r\nbrought to naught. The second condition:--They must when coming together\r\nturn their faces to the Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of\r\nGlory. They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity,\r\ncare and moderation to express their views. They must in every matter\r\nsearch out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for\r\nstubbornness and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to\r\ndiscord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. The honored\r\nmembers must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no\r\nwise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must\r\nwith moderation set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion\r\narise a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to\r\nthe majority. It is again not permitted that any one of the honored\r\nmembers object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any\r\ndecision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for\r\nsuch criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced. In short,\r\nwhatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with love and purity of\r\nmotive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement\r\nprevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness.... If this be so\r\nregarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it shall lead to\r\ncoolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One. Discussions must\r\nall be confined to spiritual matters that pertain to the training of\r\nsouls, the instruction of children, the relief of the poor, the help of\r\nthe feeble throughout all classes in the world, kindness to all peoples,\r\nthe diffusion of the fragrances of God and the exaltation of His Holy\r\nWord. Should they endeavor to fulfill these conditions the Grace of the\r\nHoly Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become\r\nthe center of the Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall\r\ncome to their aid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of\r\nSpirit.\"\r\n\r\nSo great is the importance and so supreme is the authority of these\r\nassemblies that once 'Abdu'l-Baha after having himself and in his own\r\nhandwriting corrected the translation made into Arabic of the I_sh_raqat\r\n(the Effulgences) by Sheikh Faraj, a Kurdish friend from Cairo, directed\r\nhim in a Tablet to submit the above-named translation to the Spiritual\r\nAssembly of Cairo, that he may seek from them before publication their\r\napproval and consent. These are His very words in that Tablet:--\"His honor,\r\nSheikh Faraju'llah, has here rendered into Arabic with greatest care the\r\nI_sh_raqat and yet I have told him that he must submit his version to the\r\nSpiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I have conditioned its publication upon\r\nthe approval of the above-named Assembly. This is so that things may be\r\narranged in an orderly manner, for should it not be so any one may\r\ntranslate a certain Tablet and print and circulate it on his own account.\r\nEven a non-believer might undertake such work, and thus cause confusion\r\nand disorder. If it be conditioned, however, upon the approval of the\r\nSpiritual Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and circulated by a\r\nnon-believer will have no recognition whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a clear indication of the Master's express desire that\r\nnothing whatever should be given to the public by any individual among the\r\nfriends, unless fully considered and approved by the Spiritual Assembly in\r\nhis locality; and if this (as is undoubtedly the case) is a matter that\r\npertains to the general interest of the Cause in that land, then it is\r\nincumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly to submit it to the consideration\r\nand approval of the national body representing all the various local\r\nassemblies. Not only with regard to publication, but all matters without\r\nany exception whatsoever, regarding the interests of the Cause in that\r\nlocality, individually or collectively, should be referred exclusively to\r\nthe Spiritual Assembly in that locality, which shall decide upon it,\r\nunless it be a matter of national interest, in which case it shall be\r\nreferred to the national body. With this national body also will rest the\r\ndecision whether a given question is of local or national interest. (By\r\nnational affairs is not meant matters that are political in their\r\ncharacter, for the friends of God the world over are strictly forbidden to\r\nmeddle with political affairs in any way whatever, but rather things that\r\naffect the spiritual activities of the body of the friends in that land.)\r\n\r\nFull harmony, however, as well as cooperation among the various local\r\nassemblies and the members themselves, and particularly between each\r\nassembly and the national body, is of the utmost importance, for upon it\r\ndepends the unity of the Cause of God, the solidarity of the friends, the\r\nfull, speedy and efficient working of the spiritual activities of His\r\nloved ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittees of the National Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge issues in such spiritual activities that affect the Cause in general\r\nin that land, such as the management of the \"Star of the West\" and any\r\nperiodical which the National Body may decide to be a Baha'i organ, the\r\nmatter of publication, or reprinting Baha'i literature and its\r\ndistribution among the various assemblies, the means whereby the teaching\r\ncampaign may be stimulated and maintained, the work of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the racial question in relation to the Cause, the\r\nmatter of receiving Orientals and association with them, the care and\r\nmaintenance of the precious film exhibiting a phase of the Master's\r\nsojourn in the United States of America as well as the original matrix and\r\nthe records of His voice, and various other national spiritual activities,\r\nfar from being under the exclusive jurisdiction of any local assembly or\r\ngroup of friends, must each be minutely and fully directed by a special\r\nboard, elected by the National Body, constituted as a committee thereof,\r\nresponsible to it and upon which the National Body shall exercise constant\r\nand general supervision.\r\n\r\nThe time is indeed ripe for the manifold activities, wherein the servants\r\nand handmaids of Baha'u'llah are so devoutly and earnestly engaged, to be\r\nharmonized and conducted with unity, cooperation and efficiency, that the\r\neffect of such a combined and systematized effort, through which an\r\nAll-powerful Spirit is steadily pouring, may transcend every other\r\nachievement of the past, however glorious it has been, and may stand, now\r\nthat, to the eyes of the outside world the glorious Person of the Master\r\nis no more, a convincing testimony of the potency of His everliving\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\nYour brother and co-worker in His Cause,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nMarch 5, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of Circa May, 1922 (undated).\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE NAME OF GOD\r\n\r\nThis servant, after that grievous event and great calamity, the ascension\r\nof His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha to the Abha Kingdom, has been so stricken\r\nwith grief and pain and so entangled in the troubles (created) by the\r\nenemies of the Cause of God, that I consider that my presence here, at\r\nsuch a time and in such an atmosphere, is not in accordance with the\r\nfulfilment of my important and sacred duties.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, unable to do otherwise, I have left for a time the\r\naffairs of the Cause both at home and abroad, under the supervision of the\r\nHoly Family and the headship of the Greatest Holy Leaf(2) until, by the\r\nGrace of God, having gained health, strength, self-confidence and\r\nspiritual energy, and having taken into my hands, in accordance with my\r\naim and desire, entirely and regularly the work of service I shall attain\r\nto my utmost spiritual hope and aspiration.\r\n\r\nThe servant of His Threshold,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nCirca May, 1922 (undated).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Common Servitude\r\n\r\n\r\nMay I also express my heartfelt desire that the friends of God in every\r\nland regard me in no other light but that of a true brother, united with\r\nthem in our common servitude to the Master's Sacred Threshold, and refer\r\nto me in their letters and verbal addresses always as Shoghi Effendi, for\r\nI desire to be known by no other name save the one our Beloved Master was\r\nwont to utter, a name which of all other designations is the most\r\nconducive to my spiritual growth and advancement.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nCirca May, 1922 (undated).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of December 16, 1922\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the loved ones of 'Abdu'l-Baha throughout the continent of America.\r\n\r\nDear fellow-workers in the Holy Vineyard of Baha!\r\n\r\nNow that my long hours of rest and meditation are happily at an end, I\r\nturn my face with renewed hope and vigor to that vast continent the soil\r\nof which is pregnant with those seeds that our beloved Master has so\r\ntenderly and so profusely scattered in the past. Prolonged though this\r\nperiod has been, yet I have strongly felt ever since the New Day has\r\ndawned upon me that such a needed retirement, despite the temporary\r\ndislocations it might entail, would far outweigh in its results any\r\nimmediate service I could have humbly tendered at the Threshold of\r\nBaha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nI am now confident that the energies of my beloved brethren and sisters\r\nacross the seas, far from being damped by my sudden disappearance from the\r\nfield of service, will henceforth be fully maintained, nay redoubled in\r\ntheir intensity, that we may all together carry triumphantly to the\r\nuttermost corners of the world the glorious Standard of Baha.\r\n\r\nBereft of all news whatsoever during my hours of restful seclusion, I now\r\nfeel the more the thrill of the various tidings, few but indeed promising,\r\nthat have been awaiting my return to the Holy Land. The work of the noble\r\nEdifice that the mighty hands of the All-wise Master has reared in this\r\nworld can suffer no delay, nor can its foundations be made to totter,\r\nwhatever the apparent obstacles its enemies in their impotent wrath and\r\ndespair may throw in its way. We need not wait too long, for already from\r\nvarious quarters there comes the news that the awful promises of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha regarding the Covenant-breakers have been strikingly\r\nfulfilled!\r\n\r\nBut it behooves us not to dwell for a moment on these doomed and darkened\r\nefforts, for the shining light of the Master's unfailing guidance is\r\nbeckoning us to more constructive service, to nobler and worthier\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nWe have, not a long time ago, with tearful eyes commemorated the world\r\nover the passing hour of our beloved Master. Would to God it has marked in\r\nour lives, which we all have consecrated to His service, a fresh, solemn\r\nand unswerving resolution of devotion and fidelity to His Cause\r\n\r\nYour brother and co-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nDecember 16, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of December 23rd, 1922\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly, the elected\r\nrepresentatives of all believers throughout the continent of America.\r\n\r\nEsteemed co-workers in the Vineyard of God:\r\n\r\nTo have been unable, owing to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, to\r\ncorrespond with you ever since you entered upon your manifold and arduous\r\nduties is to me a cause of deep regret and sad surprise! I am however\r\nassured and sustained by the conviction, never dimmed in my mind, that\r\nwhatsoever comes to pass in the Cause of God, however disquieting in its\r\nimmediate effects, is fraught with infinite Wisdom and tends ultimately to\r\npromote its interests in the world. Indeed, our experiences of the distant\r\npast, as well as of recent events, are too numerous and varied to permit\r\nof any misgiving or doubt as to the truth of this basic principle--a\r\nprinciple which throughout the vicissitudes of our sacred mission in this\r\nworld we must never disregard or forget.\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from expressing in this, my first letter to you my deep\r\ngratitude and great pleasure in learning how promptly, thoroughly and\r\nadmirably you have conducted the affairs of the Cause in that land. Of the\r\nsincerity of your efforts, of the determination with which you have faced\r\nyour delicate and difficult task, I have never doubted for a moment, as I\r\nknew too well of the ardent spirit of service and fellowship which the\r\nsudden passing of our Beloved had infused in all his followers everywhere.\r\nBut great was my surprise to know how the ever-present Hand of the Master\r\nhas removed so speedily all the difficulties in our way and how the light\r\nof His Divine Guidance caused the darkness of doubts, of fears and\r\nmistrust to vanish.\r\n\r\nThe efficient manner in which you have carried out my humble suggestions\r\nhas been a source of great encouragement to me and has revived confidence\r\nin my heart. I have read and re-read the reports of your activities, have\r\nstudied minutely all the steps you have taken to consolidate the\r\nfoundations of the Movement in America, and have learned with a keen sense\r\nof satisfaction the plans you contemplate for the further rise and spread\r\nof the Cause in your great country. I very highly approve of the\r\narrangements you have made for centralizing the work in your hands and of\r\ndistributing it to the various committees, who each in its own sphere,\r\nhave so efficiently and thoroughly undertaken the management of their own\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nWhat has given me still greater pleasure is to learn that the members of\r\nthis Central Body which has assumed so grave a responsibility and is\r\nfacing such delicate and difficult tasks, command individually and\r\ncollectively not only the sympathy of their spiritual brethren and sisters\r\nbut who also can confidently rely on their active and whole-hearted\r\nsupport in the campaign of service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. It is\r\nindeed as it should be, for if genuine and sustained cooperation and\r\nmutual confidence cease to exist between individual friends and their\r\nlocal and national assemblies, the all-beneficent work of the Cause must\r\ncease and nothing else can enable it to function harmoniously and\r\neffectively in future.\r\n\r\nTrue, the Cause as every other movement has its own obstacles,\r\ncomplications and unforeseen difficulties, but unlike any other human\r\norganization it inspires a spirit of Faith and Devotion which can never\r\nfail to induce us to make sincere and renewed efforts to face these\r\ndifficulties and smooth any differences that may and must arise.\r\n\r\nI look forward with fervent hope to hear of these renewed efforts on your\r\npart and of the strong determination which you will never suffer to\r\nslacken, to maintain at any cost the unity, the effectiveness and the\r\ndignity of the Cause.\r\n\r\nMay I through you express my heartfelt gratitude to the members of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar Building Committee, Mr. Alfred E. Lunt, Mrs. Corinne\r\nTrue, Dr. Zia Bagdadi, Mr. Charles Mason Remey, Mr. Louis Bourgeois, Mr.\r\nLeo Perron for their incessant labors in speeding the work of this noble\r\nEdifice which when raised and completed will prove to be the most powerful\r\nfactor in the promulgation of the Cause in America.\r\n\r\nWill you also extend to the members of the Publishing and Reviewing\r\nCommittees, Mr. William H. Randall, Mr. Mountfort Mills, Mr. Roy C.\r\nWilhelm, Mr. Albert R. Vail, Miss Edna True, Mrs. Marjory Morten and Mr.\r\nAlfred E. Lunt, my high appreciation for the very efficient management of\r\ntheir departments and their devotion to a work which if consistently\r\nmaintained cannot fail to impress and attract a vast number of the\r\nenlightened public. Regarding the Star of the West, I wish to congratulate\r\nin particular the members of the Publishing Committee on the quality of\r\ntheir work. I have perused with particular interest the last numbers of\r\nthe Magazine and am glad to note an encouraging improvement in its\r\nmanagement, its style, its general presentation and the nature and number\r\nof its articles.\r\n\r\nTo the members of the Teaching Committee, Mr. William Randall, Mrs. Agnes\r\nS. Parsons, Mr. Albert Vail, Mr. Louis G. Gregory and Mrs. Mariam Haney I\r\noffer my very best wishes and assure them of my constant prayers on their\r\nbehalf, that their services to such a vital department in the affairs of\r\nthe Cause, so primary and immediate in its importance, may be crowned with\r\nbrilliant success.\r\n\r\nFor the members of the Children's Educational Work Committee, Mrs. Grace\r\nOber, Mrs. Louise Boyle, Mrs. Victoria Bedikian, Mrs. Hebe Struven, Mrs.\r\nGrace Foster, Mr. Stanwood Cobb and Mr. Allen McDaniel, I supplicate\r\nDivine Assistance, that He may graciously aid them in a work which was so\r\nnear and dear to the Master's heart and enable them to assist in the rise\r\nof future devoted and efficient servants to the Cause of God.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of all the members of these Committees, I shall pray at the\r\nThree Hallowed Shrines, that they may become purified channels of His\r\nGrace and instruments of His Divine Plan for this world. For my part, I\r\nshall not fail to offer my humble share of help and assistance to every\r\none of them in their respective work and would welcome from each a special\r\nreport on their present activities and of their plans for the future.\r\n\r\nAwaiting from you all the joyous news of the deepening as well as the\r\nspreading of the Cause for which our beloved Master has given His time,\r\nHis life, His all, and remembering your labors of love and service every\r\ntime I lay my head upon the Sacred Thresholds,\r\n\r\nI am, as ever, your brother in His Service,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nDecember 23rd, 1922.\r\n\r\nP.S. I would be pleased and gratified if you could inform all the various\r\nlocal spiritual assemblies of my wish and desire to receive as soon as\r\npossible from every local assembly a detailed and official report on their\r\nspiritual activities, the character and organization of their respective\r\nassemblies, accounts of their public and private gatherings, of the actual\r\nposition of the Cause in their province, and of their plans and\r\narrangements for the future. Pray convey to all of them my best wishes and\r\nthe assurance of my hearty assistance in their noble work of service to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 12, 1923\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nBeloved co-workers in the Cause of God!\r\n\r\nIn the midst of your unceasing labors for the progress of the Movement in\r\nthat country, I am sure you would welcome every now and then such news as\r\nshall breathe a fresh spirit into your activities and stimulate you to\r\nfurther effort for the promotion of His Cause.\r\n\r\nOnly the other day, in the course of my study of various Baha'i documents,\r\nI came, as if by mere chance, across a very important message from our\r\nbeloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, bearing no date, and revealing no sign as to exactly\r\nwhere, how and to whom it was given, written in the Master's own\r\nhandwriting upon a leaflet that seemed ordinary and ill-preserved in\r\nappearance but which on close study proved of the profoundest interest to\r\nall believers in the East as well as in the West. As to the authenticity\r\nof these remarkable words, so clearly and forcibly written, there is no\r\ndoubt whatsoever, and the measure of assurance it shall inspire in the\r\nloved ones of Persia and the spirit of hopeful encouragement it shall\r\nbreathe in the friends of the West, have urged me to communicate it to\r\nyou, that subject to your consideration and consent, it may be\r\npublished(3) amongst the friends and redouble their confidence in the very\r\nremarkable share the West is destined to contribute to the immediate\r\nspread of the Movement throughout the world.\r\n\r\nRecently, I have rendered it myself into English and enclosed is a copy of\r\nthe full translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStar of the West\r\n\r\n\r\nMay I also mention in passing the fact that since my return to the Holy\r\nLand I have directed and emphatically urged in my letters, the friends in\r\nPersia, Turkestan, Caucasus, Great Britain, India, Egypt and Syria to\r\nsubscribe, through their respective Assemblies, to the Star of the West,\r\nreport regularly to that paper and through their Assemblies the news of\r\ntheir activity and contribute every now and then carefully written\r\narticles approved and sanctioned by the same Assemblies.\r\n\r\nI trust that this measure will react favorably on the Star of the West and\r\nwill serve to stimulate the members of the Publishing Committee to further\r\nactivity in their sphere of service to the Cause.\r\n\r\nAwaiting eagerly your letters and wishing you the fullest success in your\r\nvery arduous duties,\r\n\r\nI am your devoted brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nJanuary 12, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 16, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nBeloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:\r\n\r\nOur dear friend, Jinab-i-Fadil-i-Mazindarani, accompanied by his family,\r\nhas gladly and gratefully responded to the kind invitation of the American\r\nfriends to visit them once more and extend his helping hand to the many\r\nfriends who are so faithfully laboring throughout that continent for the\r\nCause of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nDeeply appreciative of the sentiments of warm and abiding affection which\r\nhis co-workers of that land have abundantly shown him in the past, fired\r\nwith the zeal of service which the passing of our Beloved has kindled in\r\nevery heart and hopeful of the immediate future of the Cause in those\r\nregions, he is proceeding to America with the sole purpose of promoting\r\nfar and wide and with greater efficiency and vigor the all-important work\r\nof teaching.\r\n\r\nAs to the extent of his sojourn, the details of his travel, his plan for\r\nvisiting the various spiritual centers and all other matters related to\r\nhis visit, I have left them all to his own discretion, that he may, after\r\nconsultation with the various Spiritual Assemblies, do as he deems best\r\nand most serviceable to the interests of the Cause in that land.\r\n\r\nThat all the friends may realize more fully the urgent and supreme\r\nnecessity of teaching the Cause in these days; that they may arise to\r\ninaugurate a more strenuous, systematized and extensive campaign of\r\nservice--these are the high aims he has set before himself and which he\r\nintends, with the unfailing help and wholehearted support of every\r\nbeliever in America, to achieve in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nMay his second visit to your shores mark, in its character and results, a\r\nnew and memorable era in the history of the Cause in that great country!\r\n\r\nYour brother and co-worker,\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nJanuary 16, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 17th, 1923\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nDear friends:\r\n\r\nIt is a great pleasure for me to share with you the translation(4) of some\r\nof the prayers and Tablets of our beloved Master, the reading of which I\r\ntrust will inspire you and strengthen you in your work of service to His\r\nCause.\r\n\r\nI trust that in the course of time I will be enabled to send you regularly\r\ncorrect and reliable translations of the various prayers and Tablets of\r\nBaha'u'llah, and 'Abdu'l-Baha, which will unfold to your eyes a new vision\r\nof His Glorious Mission on earth and give you an insight into the\r\ncharacter and meanings of His Divine Teachings.\r\n\r\nI shall await very eagerly any suggestions you would like to give me on\r\nthis point and on all other matters that pertain to the interests of the\r\nCause in America, and I assure you again of my readiness and wish to be of\r\nhelp and service to those faithful and devoted servants of Baha'u'llah in\r\nthat land.\r\n\r\nYour brother and co-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nJanuary 17th, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of February 13, 1923\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nDearest friends:\r\n\r\nI have just completed the translation of a number of selections(5) from\r\nthe Master's soul-stirring Words to His loved ones in Persia, revealed\r\nsome twenty-five years ago, and during the darkest days of His\r\nincarceration in the prison city of Akka.\r\n\r\nYou will realize, as you read them, the unshakable confidence of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha in the inevitable growth of the Cause, even in the most\r\nperilous days of His life. Their perusal will enable you all to grasp more\r\nfully the significance of this Movement and its dynamic power, the urgent\r\nneed for sustained unity and harmony amongst the friends, and the glory of\r\nthe station that awaits in the world to come every faithful servant of\r\nBaha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nMay they contribute their share to the unfolding of the Spirit of the\r\nCause in that land, and may they infuse in all the friends that ardent\r\nspirit of service and fellowship that will enable them to fulfill their\r\nglorious destiny in this world!\r\n\r\nYour brother and co-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nFebruary 13, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of March 12, 1923\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nAmerica, Great Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Japan and\r\nAustralasia.\r\n\r\nFellow-workers in the Vineyard of God!\r\n\r\nOver a year has elapsed since that calamitous Hour, when the glorious\r\nPerson of 'Abdu'l-Baha was veiled from mortal eyes and His Spirit ascended\r\nto the Kingdom of Glory; and I feel that the time is now ripe to take\r\nthose fresh and momentous decisions which will enable us to fulfill,\r\nspeedily and faithfully, the last wishes of our departed Master.\r\n\r\nThe year has been to the outside world a year of fear and suffering, of\r\ndisillusion and turmoil. To us, however, the bereaved followers of a\r\ngracious and loving Master, it has been, despite the passing cares which\r\nHis sudden departure must necessarily entail, a period of hope, of\r\nwholesome activity, marked throughout with a spirit of undiminished\r\nconfidence in His power and of fidelity to His Cause.\r\n\r\nFrom the East and from the West, from the North and from the South, the\r\nunnumbered servants of Baha'u'llah, disdainful of the evil machinations of\r\nthe enemies of His Cause, the breakers of His behests, have rallied to His\r\nStandard, and risen with one accord to carry on the great Work He has\r\nentrusted to their charge. All-hail to that undying spirit of fidelity\r\nwhich burns and shall burn unceasingly, in the breasts of His loved ones!\r\nGreat shall be their reward, and blissful the hour, when after a toilsome\r\nlife of service, they are gathered to the glory of Baha, and partake in\r\ntheir Beloved's Presence, of the joy of eternal Reunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition of the World\r\n\r\n\r\nBut great achievements still await us in this world, and we feel confident\r\nthat, by His grace and never-failing guidance, we shall now and ever prove\r\nourselves worthy to fulfill His great Purpose for mankind. And who can\r\nfail to realize the sore need of bleeding humanity, in its present state\r\nof uncertainty and peril, for the regenerating Spirit of God, manifested\r\nthis Day so powerfully in this Divine Dispensation? Four years of\r\nunprecedented warfare and world cataclysms, followed by another four years\r\nof bitter disappointment and suffering, have stirred deeply the conscience\r\nof mankind, and opened the eyes of an unbelieving world to the Power of\r\nthe Spirit that alone can cure its sicknesses, heal its wounds, and\r\nestablish the long-promised reign of undisturbed prosperity and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsibility of Baha'is\r\n\r\n\r\nNow surely, if ever, is the time for us, the chosen ones of Baha'u'llah\r\nand the bearers of His Message to the world, to endeavor by day and by\r\nnight, to deepen, first and foremost, the Spirit of His Cause in our own\r\nindividual lives, and then labor, and labor incessantly to exemplify in\r\nall our dealings with our fellow-men that noble Spirit of which His\r\nbeloved Son 'Abdu'l-Baha has been all the days of His life a true and\r\nunique exponent. The sayings of our beloved Master have been noised\r\nabroad, His name has filled all regions, and the eyes of mankind are now\r\nturned expectant towards His disciples who bear His name and profess His\r\nteachings. Shall we not by our daily life vindicate the high claims of His\r\nteachings, and prove by our services the influence of His undying Spirit?\r\nThis surely is our highest privilege, and our most sacred duty.\r\n\r\nLet us, with a pure heart, with humility and earnestness, turn afresh to\r\nHis counsels and exhortations, and seek from that Source of Celestial\r\nPotency all the guidance, the spirit, the power which we shall need for\r\nthe fulfillment of our mission in this life.\r\n\r\nBehold, the station to which 'Abdu'l-Baha is now calling His loved ones\r\nfrom the Realm of Glory:--\r\n\r\n\"It behooveth the loved ones of God to be enamored of one another and to\r\nsacrifice themselves for their fellow-workers in the Cause. They should\r\nyearn towards one another even as the sore athirst yearneth for the Water\r\nof Life, and the lover burneth to meet his heart's desire.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the sublime, the glorious position He wishes us, and all the\r\npeoples and kindreds on earth, to attain in this world; how much more to\r\nachieve unity and common understanding among ourselves, and then arise to\r\nherald with one voice the coming of the Kingdom and the salvation of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nWith unity of purpose firmly established in our minds, with every trace of\r\npersonal animosity banished from our hearts, and with the spirit of\r\nwhole-hearted and sustained fellowship kindled in our souls, can we hope\r\nto deliver effectively the Message of Baha'u'llah, and execute faithfully\r\nthe various provisions of our Beloved's Will and Testament.\r\n\r\nSteadfast in our faith, firm in our union, abounding in our hope, fervent\r\nin our spirit, and selfless in our labors, let us arise and with prayerful\r\nhearts make another and supreme effort to fulfill these last words of our\r\nBeloved, His most cherished desire:\r\n\r\n\"O ye that stand fast in the Covenant! When the hour cometh that this\r\nwronged and broken winged bird will have taken its flight unto the\r\nCelestial Concourse, when it will have hastened to the Realm of the\r\nUnseen, and its mortal frame will have either been lost or hidden neath\r\nthe dust, it is incumbent upon the Afnan that are steadfast in the\r\nCovenant of God and have branched from the Tree of Holiness, the Hands of\r\nthe Cause of God (the glory of the Lord rest upon them), and all the\r\nfriends and loved ones, one and all, to bestir themselves and arise with\r\nheart and soul and in one accord to diffuse the sweet savors of God, to\r\nteach His Cause and to promote His Faith. It behooveth them not to rest\r\nfor a moment, neither to seek repose. They must disperse themselves in\r\nevery land, pass by every clime, and travel throughout all regions.\r\nBestirred, without rest, and steadfast to the end, they must raise in\r\nevery land the triumphal cry of Ya-Baha'u'l-Abha, must achieve renown in\r\nthe world wherever they go, must burn brightly even as a candle in every\r\nmeeting, and must kindle the flame of Divine Love in every assembly; that\r\nthe Light of Truth may rise resplendent in the midmost heart of the world,\r\nthat throughout the East and throughout the West a vast concourse may\r\ngather under the shadow of the Word of God, that the sweet savors of\r\nHoliness may be diffused, that faces may shine radiantly, hearts be filled\r\nwith the Divine Spirit and souls be made heavenly. In these days the most\r\nimportant of all things is the guidance of the nations and the peoples of\r\nthe world. Teaching the Cause is of utmost importance, for it is the head\r\ncorner-stone of the foundation itself. This wronged servant has spent his\r\ndays and nights in promoting the Cause, and urging the peoples to service.\r\nHe rested not a moment, till the fame of the Cause of God was noised\r\nabroad in the world, and the Celestial Strains from the Abha Kingdom\r\nroused the East and the West. The beloved of God must also follow the same\r\nexample. This is the secret of faithfulness, this is the requirement of\r\nservitude to the Threshold of Baha.\"\r\n\r\nWe need but glance at the Words of Baha'u'llah and the Epistles of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha to realize the great privilege of teaching the Cause, its\r\nvital necessity, its supreme urgency, and its wide-reaching effects. These\r\nare the very words of 'Abdu'l-Baha:--\r\n\r\n\"In these days, the Holy Ones of the Realm of Glory, dwelling in the\r\nall-highest Paradise, yearn to return unto this world, and be of some\r\nservice to the Cause of Baha'u'llah and prove their servitude to the\r\nThreshold of Abha beauty.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a wondrous vision these words unfold to our eyes! How great our\r\nprivilege to labor in this Day in the Divine Vineyard! Is it not incumbent\r\nupon us to arise and teach His Cause with such an ardor which no worldly\r\nadversity can quell, nor any measure of success can satiate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElection of Local Assemblies\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, now that this all-important Work may suffer no neglect, but rather\r\nfunction vigorously and continuously in every part of the Baha'i world;\r\nthat the unity of the Cause of Baha'u'llah may remain secure and\r\ninviolate, it is of the utmost importance that in accordance with the\r\nexplicit text of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy Book, in every locality,\r\nbe it city or hamlet, where the number of adult (21 years and above)\r\ndeclared believers exceeds nine, a local \"Spiritual Assembly\" be forthwith\r\nestablished. To it all local matters pertaining to the Cause must be\r\ndirectly and immediately referred for full consultation and decision. The\r\nimportance, nay the absolute necessity of these local Assemblies is\r\nmanifest when we realize that in the days to come they will evolve into\r\nthe local Houses of Justice, and at present provide the firm foundation on\r\nwhich the structure of the Master's Will is to be reared in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuties of Spiritual Assemblies\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter of Teaching, its direction, its ways and means, its extension,\r\nits consolidation, essential as they are to the interests of the Cause,\r\nconstitute by no means the only issue which should receive the full\r\nattention of these Assemblies. A careful study of Baha'u'llah's and\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets will reveal that other duties, no less vital to the\r\ninterests of the Cause, devolve upon the elected representatives of the\r\nfriends in every locality.\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent upon them to be vigilant and cautious, discreet and\r\nwatchful, and protect at all times the Temple of the Cause from the dart\r\nof the mischief-maker and the onslaught of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThey must endeavor to promote amity and concord amongst the friends,\r\nefface every lingering trace of distrust, coolness and estrangement from\r\nevery heart, and secure in its stead an active and whole-hearted\r\ncooperation for the service of the Cause.\r\n\r\nThey must do their utmost to extend at all times the helping hand to the\r\npoor, the sick, the disabled, the orphan, the widow, irrespective of\r\ncolor, caste and creed.\r\n\r\nThey must promote by every means in their power the material as well as\r\nthe spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the education of\r\nchildren, institute, whenever possible, Baha'i educational institutions,\r\norganize and supervise their work and provide the best means for their\r\nprogress and development.\r\n\r\nThey must make an effort to maintain official, regular, and frequent\r\ncorrespondence with the various Baha'i centers throughout the world,\r\nreport to them their activities, and share the glad-tidings they receive\r\nwith all their fellow-workers in the Cause.\r\n\r\nThey must encourage and stimulate by every means at their command, through\r\nsubscription, reports and articles, the development of the various Baha'i\r\nmagazines, such as the \"Star of the West\" and the \"Magazine of the\r\nChildren of the Kingdom\" in the United States of America, the \"Baha'i\r\nNews\" of India, the \"Sun of the East\" (Khurshid-i Khavar) in Turkestan,\r\nthe \"Star of the East\" in Japan, the \"Sun of Truth\" in Germany.\r\n\r\nThey must undertake the arrangement of the regular meetings of the\r\nfriends, the feasts and the anniversaries, as well as the special\r\ngatherings designed to serve and promote the social, intellectual and\r\nspiritual interests of their fellow-men.\r\n\r\nThey must supervise in these days when the Cause is still in its infancy\r\nall Baha'i publications and translations, and provide in general for a\r\ndignified and accurate presentation of all Baha'i literature and its\r\ndistribution to the general public.\r\n\r\nThese rank among the most outstanding obligations of the members of every\r\nSpiritual Assembly. In whatsoever locality the Cause has sufficiently\r\nexpanded, and in order to insure efficiency and avoid confusion, each of\r\nthese manifold functions will have to be referred to a special Committee,\r\nresponsible to that Assembly, elected by it from among the friends in that\r\nlocality, and upon whose work the Assembly will have to exercise constant\r\nand general supervision.\r\n\r\nThese local Spiritual Assemblies will have to be elected directly by the\r\nfriends, and every declared believer of 21 years and above, far from\r\nstanding aloof and assuming an indifferent or independent attitude, should\r\nregard it his sacred duty to take part conscientiously and diligently, in\r\nthe election, the consolidation and the efficient working of his own local\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Assemblies\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the establishment of \"National Assemblies,\" it is of vital\r\nimportance that in every country, where the conditions are favorable and\r\nthe number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size, such\r\nas America, Great Britain and Germany, that a \"National Spiritual\r\nAssembly\" be immediately established, representative of the friends\r\nthroughout that country.\r\n\r\nIts immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate by frequent\r\npersonal consultations, the manifold activities of the friends as well as\r\nthe local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the\r\nHoly Land, initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the\r\nCause in that country.\r\n\r\nIt serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first, as in\r\nthe course of time it shall evolve into the National House of Justice\r\n(referred to in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will as the \"secondary House of Justice\"),\r\nwhich according to the explicit text of the Testament will have, in\r\nconjunction with the other National Assemblies throughout the Baha'i\r\nworld, to elect directly the members of the International House of\r\nJustice, that Supreme Council that will guide, organize and unify the\r\naffairs of the Movement throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIt is expressly recorded in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Writings that these National\r\nAssemblies must be indirectly elected by the friends; that is, the friends\r\nin every country must elect a certain number of delegates, who in their\r\nturn will elect from among all the friends in that country the members of\r\nthe National Spiritual Assembly. In such countries, therefore, as America,\r\nGreat Britain and Germany, a fixed number of secondary electors must first\r\nbe decided upon (95 for America, including the Pacific Islands; 95 for\r\nGermany; and 19 for Great Britain). The friends then in every locality\r\nwhere the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine must directly\r\nelect its quota of secondary electors assigned to it in direct proportion\r\nto its numerical strength. These secondary electors will then, either\r\nthrough correspondence, or preferably by gathering together, and first\r\ndeliberating upon the affairs of the Cause throughout their country (as\r\nthe delegates to the Convention), elect from among all the friends in that\r\ncountry nine who will be the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis National Spiritual Assembly, which, pending the establishment of the\r\nUniversal House of Justice, will have to be re-elected once a year,\r\nobviously assumes grave responsibilities, for it has to exercise full\r\nauthority over all the local Assemblies in its province, and will have to\r\ndirect the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of God,\r\nand control and supervise the affairs of the Movement in general.\r\n\r\nVital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country such as\r\nthe matter of translation and publication, the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the\r\nTeaching Work, and other similar matters that stand distinct from strictly\r\nlocal affairs, must be under the full jurisdiction of the National\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nIt will have to refer each of these questions, even as the local\r\nAssemblies, to a special Committee, to be elected by the members of the\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly, from among all the friends in that country,\r\nwhich will bear to it the same relation as the local committees bear to\r\ntheir respective local Assemblies.\r\n\r\nWith it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is\r\nstrictly local in its nature, and should be reserved for the consideration\r\nand decision of the local Assembly, or whether it should fall under its\r\nown province and be regarded as a matter which ought to receive its\r\nspecial attention. The National Spiritual Assembly will also decide upon\r\nsuch matters which in its opinion should be referred to the Holy Land for\r\nconsultation and decision.\r\n\r\nWith these Assemblies, local as well as national, harmoniously,\r\nvigorously, and efficiently functioning throughout the Baha'i world, the\r\nonly means for the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice will have\r\nbeen secured. And when this Supreme Body will have been properly\r\nestablished, it will have to consider afresh the whole situation, and lay\r\ndown the principle which shall direct, so long as it deems advisable, the\r\naffairs of the Cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Election of Assemblies\r\n\r\n\r\nPending its establishment, and to insure uniformity throughout the East\r\nand throughout the West, all local Assemblies will have to be re-elected\r\nonce a year, during the first day of Ridvan, and the result of polling, if\r\npossible, be declared on that day.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may not fall a\r\nprey to conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its purity and\r\npristine vigor, that its affairs may be conducted with efficiency and\r\npromptness, it is necessary that every one should conscientiously take an\r\nactive part in the election of these Assemblies, abide by their decisions,\r\nenforce their decree, and cooperate with them wholeheartedly in their task\r\nof stimulating the growth of the Movement throughout all regions. The\r\nmembers of these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard utterly their\r\nown likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and\r\nconcentrate their minds upon those measures that will conduce to the\r\nwelfare and happiness of the Baha'i Community and promote the common weal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baha'i Fund\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as the progress and execution of spiritual activities is dependent and\r\nconditioned upon material means, it is of absolute necessity that\r\nimmediately after the establishment of local as well as national Spiritual\r\nAssemblies, a Baha'i Fund be established, to be placed under the exclusive\r\ncontrol of the Spiritual Assembly. All donations and contributions should\r\nbe offered to the Treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose of\r\npromoting the interests of the Cause, throughout that locality or country.\r\nIt is the sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful servant of\r\nBaha'u'llah who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely and\r\ngenerously for the increase of that Fund. The members of the Spiritual\r\nAssembly will at their own discretion expend it to promote the Teaching\r\nCampaign, to help the needy, to establish educational Baha'i institutions,\r\nto extend in every way possible their sphere of service. I cherish the\r\nhope that all the friends, realizing the necessity of this measure, will\r\nbestir themselves and contribute, however modestly at first, towards the\r\nspeedy establishment and the increase of that Fund.\r\n\r\nThe need for the centralization of authority in the National Spiritual\r\nAssembly, and the concentration of power in the various local Assemblies,\r\nis made manifest when we reflect that the Cause of Baha'u'llah is still in\r\nits age of tender growth and in a stage of transition; when we remember\r\nthat the full implications and the exact significance of the Master's\r\nworld-wide instructions, as laid down in His Will, are as yet not fully\r\ngrasped, and the whole Movement has not sufficiently crystallized in the\r\neyes of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is our primary task to keep the most vigilant eye on the manner and\r\ncharacter of its growth, to combat effectively the forces of separation\r\nand of sectarian tendencies, lest the Spirit of the Cause be obscured, its\r\nunity be threatened, its Teachings suffer corruption; lest extreme\r\northodoxy on one hand, and irresponsible freedom on the other, cause it to\r\ndeviate from that Straight Path which alone can lead it to success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Most Essential Obligation\r\n\r\n\r\nBut let us be on our guard--so the Master continually reminds us from His\r\nStation on high--lest too much concern in that which is secondary in\r\nimportance, and too long a preoccupation with the details of our affairs\r\nand activities, make us neglectful of the most essential, the most urgent\r\nof all our obligations, namely, to bury our cares and teach the Cause,\r\ndelivering far and wide this Message of Salvation to a sorely-stricken\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTo His valiant combatants on earth, who at times may feel disheartened,\r\nour ever-victorious Commander, 'Abdu'l-Baha, gives us the following\r\nassurance:\r\n\r\n\"O ye servants of the Sacred Threshold! The triumphant Hosts of the\r\nCelestial Concourse, arrayed and marshalled in the Realms above, stand\r\nready and expectant to assist and assure victory to that valiant horseman\r\nwho with confidence spurs on his charger into the arena of service. Well\r\nis it with that fearless warrior, who armed with the power of true\r\nKnowledge, hastens unto the field, disperses the armies of ignorance, and\r\nscatters the hosts of error, who holds aloft the Standard of Divine\r\nGuidance, and sounds the Clarion of Victory. By the righteousness of the\r\nLord! He hath achieved a glorious triumph and obtained the true\r\nvictory....\"\r\n\r\nWith such inspiring words as these, are we to remain any longer unmoved\r\nand inactive? His trumpet-call resounds on every side, and summons us to\r\nservice; are we to tarry and hesitate? His voice is calling aloud from\r\nevery land; let us march on, unfettered and unafraid, and fulfill our\r\nglorious Destiny.\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nMarch 12, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransliteration of Baha'i Terms\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. On another page(6) is given the list of the best known and most\r\ncurrent Baha'i terms, and other Oriental names and expressions, all\r\nproperly and accurately transliterated, the faithful spelling of which by\r\nall the Western friends will avoid confusion in future, and insure in this\r\nmatter a uniformity which is greatly needed at present in all Baha'i\r\nliterature. The full code will be duly communicated to the various\r\nNational Assemblies, and the transliteration of the Oriental terms\r\nmentioned in the English letters sent out by the Haifa Spiritual Assembly\r\nwill provide a correct and reliable supplement to the above-mentioned\r\nlist. I feel confident that all the friends will from now on follow this\r\nsystem and adhere scrupulously and at all times to this code in all their\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of April 8th, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful, the\r\naccredited delegates to the Annual Convention of America, Chicago,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nDearly beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:\r\n\r\nOn this auspicious occasion, when the elected representatives of the\r\nBaha'i Community throughout the continent of America, gathered for the\r\nfirst time within the Foundation Hall of the stately edifice of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, are assembled to take counsel together regarding\r\nthose vital issues that confront the Cause of Baha'u'llah in that land,\r\nmay I, as one of your humble fellow-workers in the field of service, offer\r\nyou from the very depths of my heart my brotherly love and sincere\r\ngreetings, and assure you of my fervent prayers for the success of your\r\ndeliberations and the attainments of your hearts' desire.\r\n\r\nYou stand at this challenging hour in the history of the Cause at the\r\nthreshold of a new era; the functions you are called upon to discharge are\r\nfraught with immense possibilities; the responsibilities you shoulder are\r\ngrave and momentous; and the eyes of many peoples are turned, at this\r\nhour, towards you, expectant to behold the dawning of a Day that shall\r\nwitness the fulfilment of His divine Promise.\r\n\r\nForgetful of the past and its vicissitudes, conscious of the need for\r\nrenewed and combined effort, freed from all earthly limitations and\r\nmotives, with every lingering trace of ill-feeling forever banished from\r\nour hearts, freshly united and determined, let us join in deep and silent\r\ncommunion with the ever-watchful Spirit of our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, and\r\nwith humility and earnestness supplicate for the guidance that will enable\r\nus to fulfil the task which is now committed to our charge. May this\r\nyear's Convention, by the range of its activities, by the character of its\r\nproceedings, by its faithful adherence to the divine Instructions of our\r\nloving Master, and above all by its radiant spirit of enthusiasm and true\r\nfellowship, prove itself one of the greatest landmarks in the history of\r\nthe Cause in America.\r\n\r\nMay the all-pervading Spirit of Baha'u'llah so permeate the souls of its\r\nmembers as to cause it to mirror forth the glories and the splendors of\r\nthe Celestial Concourse.\r\n\r\nYour devoted brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nApril 8, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of April 9th, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nDearest friends:\r\n\r\nI have lately received your long-awaited reports on the present situation\r\nof the Movement in that land, and have read them all, together with their\r\nenclosures, with the utmost care and deepest interest.\r\n\r\nI am much impressed and feel deeply gratified to learn of your devoted and\r\nunremitting labors, individually and collectively in the field of service\r\nto the Cause; of your constant vigilance and watchful care in upholding\r\nits fundamental principles and guarding its essential interests; of the\r\nefficiency, faithfulness and vigor with which you are conducting the\r\nadministration of its affairs throughout that land.\r\n\r\nMany and grave may be the obstacles, whether from within or from without,\r\nwhich we shall have to encounter in the days to come, but we feel sure\r\nthat if we but maintain consistently before our eyes a broad and noble\r\nvision of its significance and vital necessity in these days, and above\r\nall of its universality and all-conquering power, we shall be enabled to\r\nsurmount them, one and all, and by the Power of Faith, carry the Ark of\r\nthe Covenant to its Haven of Safety and Triumph.\r\n\r\nIt is, I firmly believe, of the utmost urgent importance that, with unity\r\nof purpose and action firmly established in our midst, and with every\r\ntrace of the animosity and mistrust of the past banished from our hearts,\r\nwe should form one united front and combat, wisely and tactfully, every\r\nforce that might darken the spirit of the Movement, cause division in its\r\nranks, and narrow it by dogmatic and sectarian belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Spiritual Assemblies\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is primarily upon the elected members of the National Spiritual\r\nAssemblies throughout the Baha'i world that this highly important duty\r\ndevolves, as in their hands the direction and management of all spiritual\r\nBaha'i activities have been placed and centralized, and as they constitute\r\nin the eyes of the people of their country the supreme body in that land\r\nthat officially represents, promotes and safeguards the various interests\r\nof the Cause, it is my fervent prayer and my most cherished desire, that\r\nthe unfailing guidance of Baha'u'llah and the blessings of our beloved\r\nMaster will enable them to set a high and true example to all other Baha'i\r\ninstitutions and local Assemblies, and will show them what absolute\r\nharmony, mature deliberation and whole-hearted cooperation can achieve.\r\n\r\nShould such a representative and responsible body fail to realize this\r\nfundamental requisite for all successful achievement, the whole structure\r\nis sure to crumble, and the Great Plan of the Future, as unfolded by the\r\nMaster's Will and Testament, will be rudely disturbed and grievously\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the management of the Star of the West, as I have already\r\nintimated, this Baha'i organ as well as other similar publications, far\r\nfrom being regarded as the special organ of a certain group or particular\r\nlocality, should fall under the exclusive control of the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly, which, aided by a special committee, shall minutely\r\nguide and judiciously scrutinize all the information it gives, the\r\ncharacter of the articles and translations it publishes, and the tone and\r\nlanguage it assumes in all its issues....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReports of Activities\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall always await from the members of the National Spiritual Assembly,\r\ncollective, official and comprehensive reports on their manifold\r\nactivities, sent to me at frequent intervals, and bearing upon the inner\r\nand outward currents of the Movement, the relations of Assemblies to one\r\nanother, and the general standing and the various aspects of the progress\r\nof the Cause throughout the land. I would welcome more specific reports\r\nsent to me by the various committees of the National Spiritual Assembly,\r\nenclosed in the National Assembly's letter, and approved by all its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMashriqu'l-Adhkar\r\n\r\n\r\nI have read with keen interest all the enclosures regarding the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, have shared the up-to-date news they contained with\r\nthe friends throughout the East, and note with particular pleasure the\r\ncompletion of the Basement Section, with its spacious Foundation Hall\r\nready for the holding of meetings and the gatherings of friends. Though\r\nthe prospect of the immediate resumption of building activity does not\r\nseem bright at present, yet I hope and pray that these difficulties will\r\nsoon disappear, and the work of this unique Edifice, stimulated and\r\nadvanced in time by the zeal and self-sacrifice of the friends the world\r\nover, will soon attain its glorious consummation. I beg to enclose my\r\nhumble contribution of 19 pounds, as my share of the numerous donations\r\nthat have reached the Temple Treasury in the past year.\r\n\r\nPray convey to the members of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar Committee the\r\nhighest sense of my appreciation for their devoted and strenuous labors,\r\nand my constant prayers for the success of the task which they have set\r\nthemselves to accomplish.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the situation in Persia, and the condition of the friends\r\nin that land, I have requested the Tihran Spiritual Assembly to send me\r\nimmediately an authoritative and full report of the exact situation,\r\nwhereupon I shall duly inform you of the exact steps to be taken to insure\r\nthe well-being and safety of the tried believers in Persia....\r\n\r\nThe holding of State Congresses, Amity Conventions, and other universal\r\nassociations of the friends in America, will naturally fall within the\r\nprovince of the National Spiritual Assembly, which will direct and\r\nsupervise the work of them all by the aid of special committees, each\r\nconstituted for a specific purpose. The matter of receiving Orientals is\r\nleft entirely in the hands of the National Spiritual Assembly, whose\r\nspecial committee for this purpose will have to investigate all the\r\nquestions arising in this connection in future. Please convey to the\r\nmembers of the newly constituted Library Committee my deep appreciation of\r\ntheir labors in this important field of service, and assure them of my\r\nprayers for their success.\r\n\r\nTouching the point raised in the Secretary's letter regarding the nature\r\nand scope of the Universal Court of Arbitration, this and other similar\r\nmatters will have to be explained and elucidated by the Universal House of\r\nJustice, to which, according to the Master's explicit instructions, all\r\nimportant and fundamental questions must be referred. At present the exact\r\nimplication and full significance of the provisions of the Master's Will\r\nare as yet imperfectly understood, and time will serve to reveal the\r\nwisdom and the far-reaching effects of His words.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing on a separate sheet the full authoritative code, widely\r\nadopted by contemporary Orientalists throughout the world, which will\r\nserve as a basis for the transliteration of Baha'i terms and Oriental\r\nnames.(7)\r\n\r\nRemembering you all in my hours of visit and prayer at the Three Holy\r\nShrines, and wishing you success from all my heart,\r\n\r\nI am your brother and fellow-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nApril 9th, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of April 27th, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nBeloved fellow-workers in the Cause:\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether I have sent you before a copy of this glorious\r\nTablet revealed by Baha'u'llah for His beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, written in\r\nHis own blessed handwriting, and which we found among his papers and\r\ndocuments soon after the Master's Ascension. It reveals in terms of\r\ntouching tenderness the unique station of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and constitutes an\r\nunchallengeable evidence of His supreme authority.\r\n\r\nI am also enclosing my rendering of various passages of the\r\nKitab-i-Aqdas(8) which you may feel at liberty to circulate amongst the\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWishing you all success in your work,\r\n\r\nI am your devoted brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nApril 27th, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of May 6th, 1923\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nMy friends and fellow-workers in the Cause of God!\r\n\r\nYour most welcome message, imparting the glad news of a successful\r\nConvention, has rejoiced my heart and fortified my hope in this year of\r\nactive service, that has just unfolded itself before you.\r\n\r\nI am certain that, as the newly elected representatives of the Baha'i\r\nCommunity throughout America, you are, one and all, well aware of your\r\nmighty responsibilities, and fully realize the tremendous need for a full\r\nunderstanding amongst the friends, and their active and sustained\r\ncooperation in spreading far and wide the Cause of Baha'u'llah throughout\r\nthat vast continent.\r\n\r\nI fervently hope that in collaboration with our wise, able and devoted\r\nbrother, Jinab-i-Fadil, you will inaugurate a brilliant and vigorous\r\ncampaign of Teaching, that shall by its very splendor banish the darkness\r\nof differences and contention that so impede the majestic and onward march\r\nof the Cause in every land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Fund\r\n\r\n\r\nThat you may reinforce this Teaching Campaign--so vitally needed in these\r\ndays--and conduct, properly and efficiently, the rest of your manifold\r\nactivities, spiritual as well as humanitarian, it is urgently necessary to\r\nestablish that Central Fund, which if generously supported and upheld by\r\nindividual friends and local Assemblies, will soon enable you to execute\r\nyour plans with promptness and vigor.\r\n\r\nIt is my earnest prayer, in the day-time and in the night season, that the\r\never-guiding Hand of our loved and departed Master may graciously aid you\r\nto surmount every obstacle, and will lead, through you,--His chosen ones in\r\nthat land,--the Ark of His Cause, to its promised haven of glory and\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nWith heartfelt congratulations and best wishes,\r\n\r\nI am your brother and fellow-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nMay 6th, 1923.\r\n\r\nP.S. I enclose a copy of my translation(9) of Baha'u'llah's Words of\r\nWisdom, which you will feel at liberty to circulate amongst the friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of November 14, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nAmerica, care of the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nFellow-laborers in the Divine Vineyard:\r\n\r\nUpon my return, after a forced and prolonged absence, to the Holy Land, it\r\nis my first and most ardent wish to renew and strengthen those ties of\r\nbrotherly love and fellowship that bind our hearts together in our common\r\nservitude to His sacred Threshold.\r\n\r\nThe two years that have elapsed since the passing of our beloved Master\r\nhave been for the Cause, as well as for mankind, years of deep anxiety and\r\npain. The momentous changes that are taking place in the history of both\r\nhave proved so swift and far-reaching as to arouse in certain hearts a\r\nstrange misgiving as to their stability and future.\r\n\r\nOn one hand the remarkable revelations of the Beloved's Will and\r\nTestament, so amazing in all its aspects, so emphatic in its injunctions,\r\nhave challenged and perplexed the keenest minds, whilst the\r\never-increasing confusion of the world, threatened as never before with\r\ndisruptive forces, fierce rivalries, fresh commotions and grave disorder,\r\nhas well-nigh overwhelmed the heart and damped the zeal of even the most\r\nenthusiastic believer in the destiny of mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, how often we seem to forget the clear and repeated warnings of\r\nour beloved Master, who, in particular during the concluding years of His\r\nmission on earth, laid stress on the \"severe mental tests\" that would\r\ninevitably sweep over His loved ones of the West--tests that would purge,\r\npurify and prepare them for their noble mission in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cause of Human Suffering\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as to the world's evil plight, we need but recall the writings and\r\nsayings of Baha'u'llah, who, more than fifty years ago, declared in terms\r\nprophetic the prime cause of the ills and sufferings of mankind, and set\r\nforth their true and divine remedy. \"Should the Lamp of Religion be\r\nhidden,\" He declares, \"Chaos and confusion will ensue.\" How admirably\r\nfitting and applicable are these words to the present state of mankind!\r\n\r\nOurs is then the duty and privilege to labor, by day and by night, amidst\r\nthe storm and stress of these troublous days, that we may quicken the zeal\r\nof our fellow-men, rekindle their hopes, stimulate their interest, open\r\ntheir eyes to the true Faith of God and enlist their active support in the\r\ncarrying out of our common task for the peace and regeneration of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLet us take heart and be thankful to our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, as we\r\nremember His manifold blessings and unfailing care and protection, ever\r\nsince the hour of His departure from our midst. The flames of sedition, so\r\nmaliciously kindled in the past by those who have dared to flout His will,\r\nare gone out for ever, and the fondest hopes of these evil plotters are\r\nnow abandoned, doomed never to revive. He has indeed redeemed His promise!\r\n\r\nIt seemed not a long time ago that their agitation, so violently renewed\r\nimmediately after the passing of our Beloved, would for a time confuse the\r\nDivine Message of Baha'u'llah, obscure His Covenant, retard the progress\r\nof His Cause, and shatter its unity; and yet how well we see them all\r\ntoday, not through our efforts, but by their own folly, and above all, by\r\nthe intervention of the hidden hand of God, reduced to the vilest and most\r\nhumiliating position.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with the Cause purified and inwardly victorious, its principles\r\nvindicated, its enemies silenced and sunk in unspeakable misery, may we\r\nnot, henceforth, direct all our efforts to collective action and\r\nconstructive achievement, and, in utter disregard of the flickerings of\r\ntheir fast-fading light, arise to carry out those urgent measures that\r\nwill secure the outward and complete triumph of the Cause.\r\n\r\nI, for my part, as I look back to the unfortunate circumstances of\r\nill-health and physical exhaustion that have attended the opening years of\r\nmy career of service to the Cause, feel hardly gratified, and would be\r\ntruly despondent but for the sustaining memory and inspiring example of\r\nthe diligent and ceaseless efforts which my fellow-workers the world over\r\nhave displayed during these two trying years in the service of the Cause.\r\n\r\nI cherish the hope that, from now on, the Beloved may bestow upon me all\r\nthe strength and vigor that will enable me to pursue over a long and\r\nunbroken period of strenuous labor the supreme task of achieving, in\r\ncollaboration with the friends in every land, the speedy triumph of the\r\nCause of Baha'u'llah. This is the prayer I earnestly request all my\r\nfellow-brethren and sisters in the Faith to offer on my behalf.\r\n\r\nLet us pray to God that in these days of world-encircling gloom, when the\r\ndark forces of nature, of hate, rebellion, anarchy and reaction are\r\nthreatening the very stability of human society, when the most precious\r\nfruits of civilization are undergoing severe and unparalleled tests, we\r\nmay all realize, more profoundly than ever, that though but a mere handful\r\namidst the seething masses of the world, we are in this day the chosen\r\ninstruments of God's grace, that our mission is most urgent and vital to\r\nthe fate of humanity, and, fortified by these sentiments, arise to achieve\r\nGod's holy purpose for mankind.\r\n\r\nYour brother in His Service,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nNovember 14, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of November 26, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nFriends and fellow-workers in the Vineyard of God!\r\n\r\nAfter a long and unbroken silence, it gives me the greatest joy to be\r\nenabled to correspond again with my dearly-beloved co-workers of the\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nYour three letters, dated June 8th, July 10th and October 12th, have been\r\nsafely received, and to each I have given my earnest and fullest\r\nattention. Their perusal which reflects only a certain amount of your\r\nactivities together with the study of the enclosed communications and\r\ncirculars and of the detailed and admirable report of the proceedings of\r\nthe Annual Convention have all served to heighten my admiration for the\r\nthoroughness, the ability, and the devotion with which you are conducting\r\nthe affairs of the Cause of God in that land.\r\n\r\nHow often I have wished and yearned to be nearer to the field of your\r\nactivities and thus be able to keep in a more constant and closer touch\r\nwith every detail of the manifold and all-important services you render. I\r\ncherish the hope that erelong the facilities in the means of communication\r\nand transport will serve to draw us still nearer to one another, and\r\nfulfill, though partially, this long-desired wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Annual Convention\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been made happy and grateful to learn from your first letter that\r\n\"throughout the sessions (of the last Convention) the atmosphere was one\r\nof great detachment and spirituality combined with practical vision and\r\npurpose.\" I am deeply convinced that if the Annual Convention of the\r\nfriends in America, as well as the National Spiritual Assembly, desire to\r\nbecome potent instruments for the speedy realization of the Beloved's\r\nfondest hopes for the future of that country, they should endeavor, first\r\nand foremost, to exemplify, in an increasing degree, to all Baha'is and to\r\nthe world at large the high ideals of fellowship and service which\r\nBaha'u'llah and the beloved Master repeatedly set before them. They can\r\nclaim the admiration, the support and eventually the allegiance of their\r\nfellow-countrymen only by their strict regard for the dignity, the\r\nwelfare, and the unity of the Cause of God, by their zeal, their\r\ndisinterestedness, and constancy in the service of mankind, and by\r\ndemonstrating, through their words and deeds, the need and practicability\r\nof the lofty principles which the Movement has proclaimed to the world.\r\n\r\nThe efforts you have displayed, and the considerable success you have\r\nachieved in consolidating the forces of the Movement in the United States\r\nand Canada have been a source of inspiration to every one of us, and, I am\r\ncertain, will spur the friends throughout the East to combined and\r\nsympathetic activity for the promotion of the Cause.\r\n\r\nMy fervent prayer at the three Holy Shrines is that the bountiful Lord may\r\nbless His American friends who constitute the vanguard of His host in the\r\nWestern world, and prosper them in their material affairs and pursuits,\r\nthat the Cause which stands today in sore need of material help and\r\nassistance may advance, rapidly and unhindered, towards the fulfillment of\r\nits destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baha'i Fund\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Baha'i Fund, recently established amongst the friends,\r\nI trust that the matter now stands clear to every one throughout the\r\ncountry. As I have previously intimated, although individual friends and\r\nlocal Assemblies are absolutely free to specify the object and purpose of\r\ntheir donations to the National Spiritual Assembly, yet, in my opinion, I\r\nregard it of the utmost vital importance that individuals, as well as\r\nlocal Assemblies, throughout the land should, in view of the paramount\r\nimportance of National Teaching and as an evidence of their absolute\r\nconfidence in their national representatives, endeavor, however small at\r\nfirst, to contribute freely towards the upkeep and the increase of the\r\nNational Baha'i Fund, so that the members of the National Assembly may at\r\ntheir full discretion expend it for whatever they deem urgent and\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mashriqu'l-Adhkar\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, I shall always recall with pride and\r\ngratitude the self-sacrifice of the American friends and, in particular\r\nthe devoted services of our dear Baha'i sister, Mrs. True, and our beloved\r\nbrethren, Dr. Bagdadi, Mr. Remey and Mr. Bourgeois, whose persistent\r\nefforts and devoted services are in the eyes of all friends highly\r\npraiseworthy. I would feel indeed disheartened were the friends to think\r\nfor a moment, that its work should fall into abeyance, nay, rather they\r\nshould do all in their power (and I trust their fellow-brethren and\r\nsisters throughout the East may share in their stupendous efforts) to\r\nprovide for the steady and uninterrupted progress of the work, until the\r\nday may come when this sublime Edifice, raised in its majestic splendor in\r\nthe very heart of the continent, may be yet another evidence of the\r\ntriumph and vitality of the Cause.\r\n\r\nYour reference to the friends in Akron, Ohio, and their harmonious\r\nparticipation in the proceedings of the Convention have rejoiced my heart,\r\nfor it has removed another obstacle in the way of the rapid and vigorous\r\ndevelopment of the Cause in those regions.\r\n\r\nThe beneficent services and unremitting labors of that selfless and able\r\nteacher of the Cause of God, Jinab-i-Fadil-i-Mazandarani, the details of\r\nwhose travels and activities I have followed with deep interest, have been\r\nto me a constant source of hope and real encouragement, and my hope is\r\nthat the seeds he has so wisely sown may with your support yield in the\r\nnot distant future an abundant harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Acre\r\n\r\n\r\nI was delighted to hear of the progressive activities of that\r\ndearly-beloved spot, Green Acre, upon which the Master has bestowed His\r\ntender care and loving-kindness, and of which we are all hopeful that it\r\nmay become, while the work of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is in progress,\r\nthe focal center of the devotional, humanitarian, social and spiritual\r\nactivities of the Cause. The sacrifice of the time, energy and money made\r\nby our dearly beloved friends, Mr. and Mrs. Randall, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nSchopflocher, and those who have helped them in their task, I shall never\r\nforget, and will fervently pray on their behalf that our Beloved may\r\nfulfill their heart's desire. I feel that no interference with its present\r\norganization should be attempted, as it enjoys in its present condition\r\nunique opportunities for the diffusion of the Baha'i spirit and the\r\npromotion of the Word of God.\r\n\r\nI am glad to report that the situation of the houses in Ba_gh_dad is free\r\nfrom immediate danger, though the issue has not yet been definitely\r\ndetermined. I wish in this respect to express my high admiration and deep\r\ngratitude for the promptness, caution, and care with which you, and\r\nparticularly Mrs. Parsons and Mr. Mills, have approached and handled this\r\ndelicate question. I shall inform you of any future developments in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Star of the West, I have been impressed by the beauty\r\nand force of the various articles contributed to the Journal by Mr. Horace\r\nHolley and Mr. Stanwood Cobb, and would indeed welcome with genuine\r\nsatisfaction an even more active participation on their part in the\r\neditorial section of the Baha'i Magazine.\r\n\r\nI have addressed a few days ago a cable to the secretary of the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly, requesting the friends to exercise restraint and\r\ncaution in the use and distribution of the record of the Master's voice.\r\nIn my view, it should be used only on special occasions and be listened to\r\nwith the utmost reverence. The dignity of the Cause, I am sure, would\r\nsuffer from too wide and indiscriminate use of one of the most precious\r\nrelics of our departed Master.\r\n\r\nRegarding the short film of the Master, for which, as well as for the\r\nrecord of His voice, I am deeply indebted to the selfless efforts and\r\nservices of my dear brother, Mr. Roy C. Wilhelm, it would be undoubtedly\r\nbetter to combine it with other films representing various scenes in the\r\nhistory of the Cause, taken in countries visited by the Bab and\r\nBaha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. As this would take considerable time and\r\npreparation and would entail much expense I wonder whether it would be an\r\nexpense and burden to you to forward only to the Holy Land one copy of the\r\nactual film, as it would impart untold happiness and consolation to the\r\nbereaved ladies of the Holy Household.\r\n\r\nI am gratified to peruse the able and masterly work of my dear\r\nfellow-worker, Mr. Horace Holley, a work(10) which I have no doubt will by\r\nvirtue of its subject matter, its comprehensiveness and uniqueness arouse\r\nwidespread and genuine interest in the Movement. I am looking forward\r\neagerly to similar productions by the pen of such able and gifted servants\r\nof Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing for all the friends recent translations of those highly\r\nsignificant utterances of Baha'u'llah, revealed some fifty years ago, and\r\npregnant with His divine wisdom. His ringing call to humanity in its hour\r\nof peril sounds prophetic in these days of utter gloom.\r\n\r\nI am forwarding also a copy of the transliterated Oriental terms with few\r\ncorrections of minor type errors. I am confident that the friends will not\r\nfeel their energy and patience taxed by a scrupulous adherence to what is\r\nan authoritative and universal, though arbitrary code for the spelling of\r\nOriental terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittees of the National Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diligent efforts exerted by the various committees of the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly, those for National Teaching, for the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the Star of the West, the National Library, for the\r\nreviewing and publication of Baha'i literature, for education, for the\r\nNational Archives and the Race Amity Conventions, have cheered and\r\nheartened me in the discharge of my manifold duties, and constitute in\r\nthemselves a convincing evidence and inspiring example to the Baha'i world\r\nof the efficient spiritual administration of the affairs of the Baha'i\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs to the spiritual activities of the \"Children of the Kingdom\" in\r\nAmerica, my hope and prayer is that they may grow to become efficient\r\nservants of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. Their devotion and self-sacrifice,\r\ntheir readiness to help the cause of the Baha'i Temple, their activity in\r\nconnection with the Baha'i Magazine are all unmistakable signs of the\r\nglorious future of the Cause in that land. May the care and\r\nloving-kindness of the Heavenly Father guide them, protect them and aid\r\nthem in their future mission in life.\r\n\r\nThe Greatest Holy Leaf, the Holy Mother, and the other ladies of the Holy\r\nHousehold wish to join me, one and all, in expressing to every one of you\r\ntheir deep thankfulness and their highest appreciation for the efficient\r\nand admirable manner with which you are coordinating the dynamic forces of\r\nthe Cause, and conducting its affairs throughout America.\r\n\r\nThe sum of 100 English pounds which you have offered to the Cause through\r\nme, I must acknowledge with deep appreciation and gratitude, and wish to\r\ninform you that a part of it has been directly expended for the furthering\r\nof the interests of the Cause throughout the world, and the rest for the\r\nembellishment of the Well-Beloved's Shrine on Mount Carmel.\r\n\r\nWith deep gratitude, and hoping to hear from you, singly and collectively,\r\nI am your true brother,\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nNovember 26, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 4th, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nMy dearest friends:\r\n\r\nOn November 28th I received the following communication from the President\r\nof the National Spiritual Assembly of Great Britain:\r\n\r\n\"I have now to bring to your notice, though possibly you are already aware\r\nof it, a matter which is of the first importance in the opinion of the\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly as you will see from one of the paragraphs of\r\nthe enclosed minutes of its first meeting, which was held on October 13th.\r\nSo far the programme of the conference on the 'Living Religions within the\r\nBritish Empire' is in a somewhat nebulous condition, but I have\r\nascertained from Miss Sharples, the honorary secretary of the committee of\r\norganization, that the conference has been approved by the authorities of\r\nthe British Empire Exhibition 1924 and will last for ten days, covering\r\nthe last week of the month of September and the first three days of\r\nOctober. It is proposed that all religions taught and practiced throughout\r\nthe British Empire shall be represented at the conference, including the\r\nChristians, Muhammadans, Buddhists, Brahma Somaj, Theosophists and others,\r\nand that each one in turn shall have at its disposal a day or part of a\r\nday for a meeting to expound its principles and deal with its organization\r\nand objects.\"\r\n\r\nIn their last letter, the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of\r\nGreat Britain further informed me that the idea of the above-mentioned\r\nconference has originated with the Theosophical Society, but these having\r\nlater dropped its management, the organization of the conference passed\r\ninto the hands of the School of Oriental Studies and the Sociological\r\nSociety. You will also note from the enclosed copy of a letter addressed\r\nby the same Miss Sharples to the President of the British National\r\nSpiritual Assembly that the time offered to the Baha'i representatives\r\nwill be very limited, and that most probably the allotted time will be\r\njust sufficient to read their papers or deliver their address and engage\r\nin the discussion that might arise after their formal presentation of the\r\nCause.\r\n\r\nAs the British Empire Exhibition, of which this conference forms a part,\r\nis itself a semi-official undertaking, and receives actually the generous\r\nsupport and active participation of the government authorities throughout\r\nthe British Empire, I feel that the opportunities now offered to the\r\nBaha'i world should not be missed, as this chance, if properly utilized,\r\nmight arouse and stimulate interest among the enlightened public.\r\n\r\nAs so much will depend upon the nature and general presentation of the\r\ntheme, rather than upon the personality of the reader or speaker, I feel\r\nthat, first and foremost, our attention should be concentrated on the\r\nchoice and thorough preparation of the subject matter as well as on the\r\nproper drafting and the form of the paper itself, which might possibly\r\nhave to be submitted afterwards to the authorities of the conference.\r\n\r\nI feel the necessity of entrusting this highly important and delicate task\r\nto a special committee, to be appointed most carefully by the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly of America, and consisting of those who by their\r\nknowledge of the Cause, their experience in matters of publicity, and\r\nparticularly by their power of expression and beauty of style will be\r\nqualified to produce a befitting statement on the unique history of the\r\nMovement as well as its lofty principles.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing an article on the Baha'i Movement which I trust might serve\r\nas a basis and example of the paper in question. An account of the most\r\nsalient features of the history of the Cause, a brief but impressive\r\nreference to its many heroes and martyrs, a convincing and comprehensive\r\npresentation of its basic principles, and a characteristic survey of the\r\nMaster's life, as well as a short but graphic description of the present\r\nposition and influence of the Movement both in the East and the West,\r\nshould, in my opinion, be included and combined into one conclusive\r\nargument. Its length should not surpass that of the enclosed article, and\r\nits general tone, expression and language should be at once dignified,\r\nsober and forceful.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care and caution must be exercised in choosing those who can\r\nbest provide and fulfill the above mentioned requisites and conditions.\r\n\r\nI shall be most pleased to offer my views and suggestions once the paper\r\nhas assumed its final shape, and wish you to obtain the assistance and\r\nadvice of those whom you think able to judge amongst the friends in\r\nEngland and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson, the President of the British National Spiritual Assembly,\r\nwrites that Miss Grand from Canada has suggested the names of Dr. Watson\r\nand Mr. J. O. McCarthy of Toronto to represent the Canadian Baha'is. I\r\nwould be pleased to receive your views as to who should represent Canada\r\nat the Conference. India is the only other country within the British\r\nEmpire that can send a native Baha'i representative to the conference, and\r\nit is rather unfortunate that the United States of America should have to\r\nbe excluded, as the speakers at the conference must necessarily be\r\nsubjects of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing recent translations(11) of the prophetic and most\r\nremarkable words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha which I trust you will\r\nall find of great value and interest in the great work you are doing for\r\nthe Cause.\r\n\r\nMay this great project yield an abundant harvest for the Cause, and your\r\nefforts be richly blessed by the guiding Spirit of 'Abdu'l-Baha.\r\n\r\nYour fellow-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nJanuary 4th, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of February 23, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nMy dear fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nI gather from various sources that the Cause of Baha'u'llah, in the course\r\nof its sure yet toilsome march towards the salvation of the world, has\r\nencountered of late further obstacles, which in the eyes of some appear to\r\nretard its progress and hinder its growth. I have learned with feelings of\r\nsadness and surprise that some vague sense of apprehension, a strange\r\nmisconception of its immediate purpose and methods, is slowly gaining\r\nground, steadily affecting its wholesome growth and vigorous development\r\nthroughout the continent.\r\n\r\nThough such signs should appear from time to time, and however\r\nunrepresentative they be of the vast and growing mass of its convinced and\r\nzealous supporters, the world over, what, I wonder, could have caused this\r\nuneasiness of mind? Are such misgivings possible, though on the part of\r\nbut a few, in the face of the remarkable manifestations of so remarkable a\r\nmovement? To what extent do they form a part of those mental tests and\r\ntrials destined at various times by the Almighty to stir and reinvigorate\r\nthe body of His Cause, and how far are they traceable to our imperfect\r\nstate of understanding, to our weaknesses and failings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivine Destiny and Human Frailty\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Cause of God should, in the days to come, witness many a\r\nchallenging hour and pass through critical stages in preparation for the\r\nglories of its promised ascendancy in the new world has been, time and\r\nagain, undeniably affirmed by our departed Master, and is abundantly\r\nproved to us all by its heroic past and turbulent history. And yet, if it\r\nis the lot of the chosen ones of God, the people of Baha, to face\r\nadversity and suffer tribulation before achieving ultimate victory, are we\r\nto believe that whatever befalls us is divinely ordained, and in no wise\r\nthe result of our faint-heartedness and negligence?\r\n\r\nSurely now, if ever, is the time to turn our eyes inwardly, to bestir\r\nourselves, to invoke the Most Great Name, and standing together, summon to\r\nour aid and support all the faith, the strength, and the courage that we\r\nshall need to meet our pressing obligations and discharge our trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plight of Mankind\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plight of mankind, the condition and circumstances under which we live\r\nand labor are truly disheartening, and the darkness of prejudice and\r\nill-will enough to chill the stoutest heart. Disillusion and dismay are\r\ninvading the hearts of peoples and nations, and the hope and vision of a\r\nunited and regenerated humanity is growing dimmer and dimmer every day.\r\nTime-honored institutions, cherished ideals, and sacred traditions are\r\nsuffering in these days of bewildering change, from the effects of the\r\ngravest onslaught, and the precious fruit of centuries of patient and\r\nearnest labor is faced with peril. Passions, supposed to have been curbed\r\nand subdued, are now burning fiercer than ever before, and the voice of\r\npeace and good-will seems drowned amid unceasing convulsions and turmoil.\r\nWhat, let us ask ourselves, should be our attitude as we stand under the\r\nall-seeing eye of our vigilant Master, gazing at a sad spectacle so\r\nutterly remote from the spirit which He breathed into the world? Are we to\r\nfollow in the wake of the wayward and the despairing? Are we to allow our\r\nvision of so unique, so enduring, so precious a Cause to be clouded by the\r\nstain and dust of worldly happenings, which, no matter how glittering and\r\nfar-reaching in their immediate effects, are but the fleeting shadows of\r\nan imperfect world? Are we to be carried away by the flood of hollow and\r\nconflicting ideas, or are we to stand, unsubdued and unblemished, upon the\r\neverlasting rock of God's Divine Instructions? Shall we not equip\r\nourselves with a clear and full understanding of their purpose and\r\nimplications for the age we live in, and with an unconquerable resolve\r\narise to utilize them, intelligently and with scrupulous fidelity, for the\r\nenlightenment and the promotion of the good of all mankind?\r\n\r\nHumanity, torn with dissension and burning with hate, is crying at this\r\nhour for a fuller measure of that love which is born of God, that love\r\nwhich in the last resort will prove the one solvent of its incalculable\r\ndifficulties and problems. Is it not incumbent upon us, whose hearts are\r\naglow with love for Him, to make still greater effort, to manifest that\r\nlove in all its purity and power in our dealings with our fellow-men? May\r\nour love of our beloved Master, so ardent, so disinterested in all its\r\naspects, find its true expression in love for our fellow-brethren and\r\nsisters in the faith as well as for all mankind. I assure you, dear\r\nfriends, that progress in such matters as these is limitless and infinite,\r\nand that upon the extent of our achievements along this line will\r\nultimately depend the success of our mission in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New World Order\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as we make an effort to demonstrate that love to the world may we also\r\nclear our minds of any lingering trace of unhappy misunderstandings that\r\nmight obscure our clear conception of the exact purpose and methods of\r\nthis new world order, so challenging and complex, yet so consummate and\r\nwise. We are called upon by our beloved Master in His Will and Testament\r\nnot only to adopt it unreservedly, but to unveil its merit to all the\r\nworld. To attempt to estimate its full value, and grasp its exact\r\nsignificance after so short a time since its inception would be premature\r\nand presumptuous on our part. We must trust to time, and the guidance of\r\nGod's Universal House of Justice, to obtain a clearer and fuller\r\nunderstanding of its provisions and implications. But one word of warning\r\nmust be uttered in this connection. Let us be on our guard lest we measure\r\ntoo strictly the Divine Plan with the standard of men. I am not prepared\r\nto state that it agrees in principle or in method with the prevailing\r\nnotions now uppermost in men's minds, nor that it should conform with\r\nthose imperfect, precarious, and expedient measures feverishly resorted to\r\nby agitated humanity. Are we to doubt that the ways of God are not\r\nnecessarily the ways of man? Is not faith but another word for implicit\r\nobedience, whole-hearted allegiance, uncompromising adherence to that\r\nwhich we believe is the revealed and express will of God, however\r\nperplexing it might first appear, however at variance with the shadowy\r\nviews, the impotent doctrines, the crude theories, the idle imaginings,\r\nthe fashionable conceptions of a transient and troublous age? If we are to\r\nfalter or hesitate, if our love for Him should fail to direct us and keep\r\nus within His path, if we desert Divine and emphatic principles, what hope\r\ncan we any more cherish for healing the ills and sicknesses of this world?\r\n\r\nPending the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, whose\r\nfunction it is to lay more definitely the broad lines that must guide the\r\nfuture activities and administration of the Movement, it is clearly our\r\nduty to strive to obtain as clear a view as possible of the manner in\r\nwhich to conduct the affairs of the Cause, and then arise with\r\nsingle-mindedness and determination to adopt and maintain it in all our\r\nactivities and labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Foundation of the House of Justice\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various Assemblies, local and national, constitute today the bedrock\r\nupon the strength of which the Universal House is in future to be firmly\r\nestablished and raised. Not until these function vigorously and\r\nharmoniously can the hope for the termination of this period of transition\r\nbe realized. It devolves upon us whose dearest wish is to see the Cause\r\nenter upon that promised era of universal recognition and world\r\nachievements, to do all in our power to consolidate the foundations of\r\nthese Assemblies, promoting at the same time a fuller understanding of\r\ntheir purpose and more harmonious cooperation for their maintenance and\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nLet us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the principle\r\nof the undoubted right of the individual to self-expression, his freedom\r\nto declare his conscience and set forth his views. If certain instructions\r\nof the Master are today particularly emphasized and scrupulously adhered\r\nto, let us be sure that they are but provisional measures designed to\r\nguard and protect the Cause in its present state of infancy and growth\r\nuntil the day when this tender and precious plant shall have sufficiently\r\ngrown to be able to withstand the unwisdom of its friends and the attacks\r\nof its enemies.\r\n\r\nLet us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not\r\ndictatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the\r\nspirit of frank and loving consultation. Nothing short of the spirit of a\r\ntrue Baha'i can hope to reconcile the principles of mercy and justice, of\r\nfreedom and submission, of the sanctity of the right of the individual and\r\nof self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand,\r\nand fellowship, candor, and courage on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuties of Elected Representatives\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duties of those whom the friends have freely and conscientiously\r\nelected as their representatives are no less vital and binding than the\r\nobligations of those who have chosen them. Their function is not to\r\ndictate, but to consult, and consult not only among themselves, but as\r\nmuch as possible with the friends whom they represent. They must regard\r\nthemselves in no other light but that of chosen instruments for a more\r\nefficient and dignified presentation of the Cause of God. They should\r\nnever be led to suppose that they are the central ornaments of the body of\r\nthe Cause, intrinsically superior to others in capacity or merit, and sole\r\npromoters of its teachings and principles. They should approach their task\r\nwith extreme humility, and endeavor, by their open-mindedness, their high\r\nsense of justice and duty, their candor, their modesty, their entire\r\ndevotion to the welfare and interests of the friends, the Cause, and\r\nhumanity, to win, not only the confidence and the genuine support and\r\nrespect of those whom they serve, but also their esteem and real\r\naffection. They must, at all times, avoid the spirit of exclusiveness, the\r\natmosphere of secrecy, free themselves from a domineering attitude, and\r\nbanish all forms of prejudice and passion from their deliberations. They\r\nshould, within the limits of wise discretion, take the friends into their\r\nconfidence, acquaint them with their plans, share with them their problems\r\nand anxieties, and seek their advice and counsel. And, when they are\r\ncalled upon to arrive at a certain decision, they should, after\r\ndispassionate, anxious and cordial consultation, turn to God in prayer,\r\nand with earnestness and conviction and courage record their vote and\r\nabide by the voice of the majority, which we are told by our Master to be\r\nthe voice of truth, never to be challenged, and always to be\r\nwhole-heartedly enforced. To this voice the friends must heartily respond,\r\nand regard it as the only means that can insure the protection and\r\nadvancement of the Cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElection of Delegates\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain I earnestly appeal to every one of you, and renew my only request\r\nwith all the ardor of my conviction, to make, before and during the coming\r\nConvention, yet another effort, this time more spontaneous and selfless\r\nthan before, and endeavor to approach your task--the election of your\r\ndelegates, as well as your national and local representatives--with that\r\npurity of spirit that can alone obtain our Beloved's most cherished\r\ndesire. Let us recall His explicit and often-repeated assurances that\r\nevery Assembly elected in that rarefied atmosphere of selflessness and\r\ndetachment is, in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly\r\ninspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and\r\nwith cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nLet us first strive to fulfill these conditions, difficult yet essential,\r\nin our lives, so that, contented and assured, we may make of this new year\r\nof activity a year of abundant blessings, of unprecedented achievements.\r\n\r\nMay this dearest wish be fulfilled!\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nFebruary 23, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of September 24, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the\r\nContinent of America:\r\n\r\nDear friends:\r\n\r\nI return to the Holy Land with an overpowering sense of the gravity of the\r\nspiritual state of the Cause in the world. Much as I deplore the\r\ndisturbing effect of my forced and repeated withdrawals from the field of\r\nservice, I can unhesitatingly assure you that my last and momentous step\r\nwas taken with extreme reluctance and only after mature and anxious\r\nreflection as to the best way to safeguard the interests of a precious\r\nCause.\r\n\r\nMy prolonged absence, my utter inaction should not, however, be solely\r\nattributed to certain external manifestations of unharmony, of discontent\r\nand disloyalty--however paralysing their effect has been upon the\r\ncontinuance of my work--but also to my own unworthiness and to my\r\nimperfections and frailties.\r\n\r\nI venture to request you to join me in yet another prayer, this time more\r\nardent and universal than before, supplicating with one voice the gracious\r\nMaster to overlook our weaknesses and failings, to make us worthier and\r\nbraver children of His own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Inner Life\r\n\r\n\r\nHumanity, through suffering and turmoil, is swiftly moving on towards its\r\ndestiny; if we be loiterers, if we fail to play our part surely others\r\nwill be called upon to take up our task as ministers to the crying needs\r\nof this afflicted world.\r\n\r\nNot by the force of numbers, not by the mere exposition of a set of new\r\nand noble principles, not by an organized campaign of teaching--no matter\r\nhow worldwide and elaborate in its character--not even by the staunchness\r\nof our faith or the exaltation of our enthusiasm, can we ultimately hope\r\nto vindicate in the eyes of a critical and sceptical age the supreme claim\r\nof the Abha Revelation. One thing and only one thing will unfailingly and\r\nalone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the\r\nextent to which our own inner life and private character mirror forth in\r\ntheir manifold aspects the splendor of those eternal principles proclaimed\r\nby Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nLooking back upon those sullen days of my retirement, bitter with feelings\r\nof anxiety and gloom, I can recall with appreciation and gratitude those\r\nunmistakable evidences of your affection and steadfast zeal which I have\r\nreceived from time to time, and which have served to relieve in no small\r\nmeasure the burden that weighed so heavily upon my heart.\r\n\r\nI can well imagine the degree of uneasiness, nay of affliction, that must\r\nhave agitated the mind and soul of every loving and loyal servant of the\r\nBeloved during these long months of suspense and distressing silence. But\r\nI assure you such remarkable solicitude as you have shown for the\r\nprotection of His Cause, such tenacity of faith and unceasing activity as\r\nyou have displayed for its promotion, cannot but in the end be abundantly\r\nrewarded by 'Abdu'l-Baha, who from His station above is the sure witness\r\nof all that you have endured and suffered for Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn of a Brighter Day\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now as I look into the future, I hope to see the friends at all times,\r\nin every land, and of every shade of thought and character, voluntarily\r\nand joyously rallying round their local and in particular their national\r\ncenters of activity, upholding and promoting their interests with complete\r\nunanimity and contentment, with perfect understanding, genuine enthusiasm,\r\nand sustained vigor. This indeed is the one joy and yearning of my life,\r\nfor it is the fountainhead from which all future blessings will flow, the\r\nbroad foundation upon which the security of the Divine Edifice must\r\nultimately rest. May we not hope that now at last the dawn of a brighter\r\nday is breaking upon our beloved Cause?\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nSeptember 24, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of November 24th, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha: care of the\r\nAmerican National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nDearest friends:\r\n\r\nThe day is drawing near when, for the third time, we shall commemorate the\r\nworld over the passing of our well-beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha. May we not pause\r\nfor a moment, and gather our thoughts? How has it fared with us, His\r\nlittle band of followers, since that day? Whither are we now marching?\r\nWhat has been our achievement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMenace of Social Chaos\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have but to turn our eyes to the world without to realize the\r\nfierceness and the magnitude of the forces of darkness that are struggling\r\nwith the dawning light of the Abha Revelation. Nations, though exhausted\r\nand disillusioned, have seemingly begun to cherish anew the spirit of\r\nrevenge, of domination, and strife. Peoples, convulsed by economic\r\nupheavals, are slowly drifting into two great opposing camps with all\r\ntheir menace of social chaos, class hatreds, and worldwide ruin. Races,\r\nalienated more than ever before, are filled with mistrust, humiliation and\r\nfear, and seem to prepare themselves for a fresh and fateful encounter.\r\nCreeds and religions, caught in this whirlpool of conflict and passion,\r\nappear to gaze with impotence and despair at this spectacle of unceasing\r\nturmoil.\r\n\r\nSuch is the plight of mankind three years after the passing of Him from\r\nwhose lips fell unceasingly the sure message of a fast-approaching Divine\r\nsalvation. Are we by our thoughts, our words, our deeds, whether\r\nindividually or collectively, preparing the way? Are we hastening the\r\nadvent of the Day He so often foretold?\r\n\r\nNone can deny that the flame of faith and love which His mighty hand\r\nkindled in many hearts has, despite our bereavement, continued to burn as\r\nbrightly and steadily as ever before. Who can question that His loved\r\nones, both in the East and the West, notwithstanding the insidious\r\nstrivings of the enemies of the Cause, have displayed a spirit of\r\nunshakable loyalty worthy of the highest praise? What greater perseverance\r\nand fortitude than that which His tried and trusted friends have shown in\r\nthe face of untold calamities, intolerable oppression, and incredible\r\nrestrictions? But such staunchness of faith, such an unsullied love, such\r\nmagnificent loyalty, such heroic constancy, such noble courage, however\r\nunprecedented and laudable in themselves, cannot alone lead us to the\r\nfinal and complete triumph of such a great Cause. Not until the dynamic\r\nlove we cherish for Him is sufficiently reflected in its power and purity\r\nin all our dealings with our fellow-men, however remotely connected and\r\nhumble in origin, can we hope to exalt in the eyes of a self-seeking world\r\nthe genuineness of the all-conquering love of God. Not until we live\r\nourselves the life of a true Baha'i can we hope to demonstrate the\r\ncreative and transforming potency of the Faith we profess. Nothing but the\r\nabundance of our actions, nothing but the purity of our lives and the\r\nintegrity of our characters, can in the last resort establish our claim\r\nthat the Baha'i spirit is in this day the sole agency that can translate a\r\nlong-cherished ideal into an enduring achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParamount Duty of Every Baha'i\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this vision clearly set before us, and fortified by the knowledge of\r\nthe gracious aid of Baha'u'llah and the repeated assurances of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha, let us first strive to live the life and then arise with one\r\nheart, one mind, one voice, to reinforce our numbers and achieve our end.\r\nLet us recall, and seek on this sad occasion the comfort of, the last\r\nwishes of our departed yet ever-watchful Master:--\r\n\r\n\"It behooveth them not to rest for a moment, neither to seek repose. They\r\nmust disperse themselves in every land, pass by every clime, and travel\r\nthroughout all regions. Bestirred, without rest, and steadfast to the end,\r\nthey must raise in every land the triumphal cry 'Ya Baha'u'l-Abha!' (O\r\nThou the Glory of Glories).... The disciples of Christ forgot themselves\r\nand all earthly things, forsook all their cares and belongings, purged\r\nthemselves of self and passion, and with absolute detachment scattered far\r\nand wide and engaged in calling the peoples of the world to the divine\r\nguidance; till at last they made the world another world, illumined the\r\nsurface of the earth, and even to their last hour proved self-sacrificing\r\nin the pathway of that beloved One of God. Finally in various lands they\r\nsuffered glorious martyrdom. Let them that are men of action follow in\r\ntheir footsteps!\"\r\n\r\nHaving grasped the significance of these words, having obtained a clear\r\nunderstanding of the true character of our mission, the methods to adopt,\r\nthe course to pursue, and having attained sufficiently the individual\r\nregeneration--the essential requisite of teaching--let us arise to teach His\r\nCause with righteousness, conviction, understanding and vigor. Let this be\r\nthe paramount and most urgent duty of every Baha'i. Let us make it the\r\ndominating passion of our life. Let us scatter to the uttermost corners of\r\nthe earth; sacrifice our personal interests, comforts, tastes and\r\npleasures; mingle with the divers kindreds and peoples of the world;\r\nfamiliarize ourselves with their manners, traditions, thoughts and\r\ncustoms; arouse, stimulate and maintain universal interest in the\r\nMovement, and at the same time endeavor by all the means in our power, by\r\nconcentrated and persistent attention, to enlist the unreserved allegiance\r\nand the active support of the more hopeful and receptive among our\r\nhearers. Let us too bear in mind the example which our beloved Master has\r\nclearly set before us. Wise and tactful in His approach, wakeful and\r\nattentive in His early intercourse, broad and liberal in all His public\r\nutterances, cautious and gradual in the unfolding of the essential\r\nverities of the Cause, passionate in His appeal yet sober in argument,\r\nconfident in tone, unswerving in conviction, dignified in His manners--such\r\nwere the distinguishing features of our Beloved's noble presentation of\r\nthe Cause of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nIf we all choose to tread faithfully His path, surely the day is not far\r\ndistant when our beloved Cause will have emerged from the inevitable\r\nobscurity of a young and struggling Faith into the broad daylight of\r\nuniversal recognition. This is our duty, our first obligation. Therein\r\nlies the secret of the success of the Cause we love so well. Therein lies\r\nthe hope, the salvation of mankind. Are we fully conscious of our\r\nresponsibilities? Do we realize the urgency, the sacredness, the\r\nimmensity, the glory of our task?\r\n\r\nI entreat you, dear friends, to continue, nay, to redouble your efforts,\r\nto keep your vision clear, your hopes undimmed, your determination\r\nunshaken, so that the power of God within us may fill the world with all\r\nits glory.\r\n\r\nIn this fervent plea joins me the Greatest Holy Leaf. Though chagrined in\r\nthe evening of her life at the sorrowful tales of repression in Persia,\r\nshe still turns with the deepest longings of her heart to your land where\r\nfreedom reigns, eager and expectant to behold, ere she is called away, the\r\nsigns of the universal triumph of the Cause she loves so dearly.\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nNovember 24th, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of November 27, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my dear friends and fellow-workers, the members of the American\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nMy friends and fellow-workers:--\r\n\r\nThe letters which our able and devoted friend, Mr. Horace Holley, has\r\naddressed in your behalf to the Greatest Holy Leaf and myself have all\r\nbeen received, and, together with their enclosures, read with the closest\r\nattention. It is indeed highly gratifying to observe that notwithstanding\r\nthe strain and stress of the critical period through which our beloved\r\nCause is passing, the elected representatives of the friends in America\r\nhave, with unflinching faith, undaunted courage, and conspicuous ability,\r\npersevered in their task and fulfilled their arduous duties.\r\n\r\nThe splendid contribution you have made to the efforts of your\r\nfellow-workers in England in connection with the Conference on the Living\r\nReligions within the British Empire, we all heartily appreciate and regard\r\nas a fresh evidence of the growing power and solidarity of the Cause of\r\nGod. Both in the admirable paper which you arranged to be drafted and\r\nprepared, and in the person of your devout, trusted and talented\r\nPresident, who performed his duty with absolute fidelity and high\r\ndistinction, you have rendered the Cause of Baha'u'llah a fresh and\r\ndistinguished service. May the results achieved lend a fresh impetus to\r\nthe onward march of the Cause in the West.\r\n\r\nThe recent measures you have adopted in view of the necessity of promoting\r\nfuller confidence and a greater measure of understanding and cooperation\r\nbetween the body of the believers and the local and National Assemblies,\r\nwill, I am confident, be of the greatest value, and indicate clearly that\r\nyou are fully aware of the true position, the privileges and\r\nresponsibilities of every Baha'i Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMashriqu'l-Adhkar\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all long to hasten by wise and effective measures the completion of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, and we fervently supplicate the All-Bountiful to\r\nbless richly our teaching work that our numbers may be reinforced in time\r\nby men who with sufficient means at their disposal may voluntarily and\r\nabundantly support this vast and noble endeavor. I trust that you will\r\nencounter no further obstacles in receiving the necessary support to meet\r\nthe immediate needs of this Universal House of Worship as decided at your\r\nrecent general gathering in Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'i Magazine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Star of the West, the latest issues of which I have read with genuine\r\nsatisfaction, has admittedly made a notable advance towards the ideal\r\nwhich the Master has set before it. Articles on broad humanitarian lines,\r\nwell-conceived, adequately treated, and powerfully presented, should have\r\ntheir proper place in every issue together with such accounts of the\r\nhistory and the teachings of the Cause as will portray to the Baha'i and\r\nnon-Baha'i alike the unique beauty as well as the compelling power of the\r\nBaha'i spirit. Matters political and partisan in character should be\r\ncarefully avoided as they would eventually lead to entanglements that\r\nwould be not only futile but positively harmful. As regards the Persian\r\nSection: I feel that in view of the severe restrictions imposed on the\r\nfriends in Persia its temporary suspension would be well-advised,\r\nparticularly as it makes such a disproportionate demand on the meagre\r\nresources of the friends in America.\r\n\r\nThe increasing efforts displayed by my beloved brothers and sisters in\r\nAmerica, both individually and collectively, and the action taken by you\r\nin constituting regional Teaching Committees are of vital importance to\r\nthe spread of the Cause in the present stage of our work. I feel that we\r\nshould all collaborate in widening its scope, intensifying its influence,\r\nassuring its continuity, and endeavoring to subordinate every other\r\nactivity to this most urgent and vital task. It is our bounden duty to do\r\nall in our power to give the Cause from day to day a fuller publicity, to\r\nmaintain and stimulate the interest aroused, and to concentrate at the\r\nsame time our attention on a chosen few, endeavoring tactfully and\r\npersistently to make of them earnest and unreserved supporters of the\r\nBaha'i Faith.\r\n\r\nI am deeply conscious of the manifold and unavoidable difficulties that\r\nconfront you in your labors for the administration of the affairs of the\r\nCause. Vast distances; personal professional preoccupations; insufficient\r\nnumber of capable and experienced teachers, unhampered by the necessity of\r\nearning their means of livelihood; the inadequacy of the means at your\r\ndisposal, financial and otherwise; the prevailing tendencies in the\r\ngeneral thought, sentiment, and manners of the people in whose midst you\r\nwork--all these, though insuperable obstacles at present, will, if we stand\r\nsteadfast and faithful, be one by one removed, and pave the way for the\r\nultimate ascendency of the Cause and the fruition and triumph of our\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\nAs to the projected prayer-book, I feel the need for a specially prepared\r\ncompilation of the prayers of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha designed for\r\nthe general public which would both prove of value for devotional purposes\r\nand act as a fresh incentive to eager and inspiring minds. I am enclosing\r\ncopies of prayers which you may have not yet received and trust to send\r\nyou more in future. I should be glad to receive any particulars you might\r\nwish me to consider in this connection.\r\n\r\nOur untiring and devoted sister, Dr. Moody (the handmaid of the Most\r\nHigh), has had to her profound regret to discontinue for a time the\r\ninvaluable and unique services she has been rendering to the Cause in\r\nPersia. She is proceeding to America, and will familiarize you with the\r\ndeplorable state of affairs in that unhappy country. You will get\r\nfirst-hand information from her regarding the present condition and\r\nactivities of our long-suffering friends in Persia, and she will take\r\ncounsel with you as to the best way to meet the needs and serve the Cause\r\nof Education in Tihran. I hope and pray that as soon as circumstances\r\npermit, the friends in America may enable Dr. Moody to take back with her\r\nto Persia suitable, capable and ardent collaborators who will contribute\r\ntheir distinct share towards the uplift and the advancement of their\r\nbrethren and sisters in that land.\r\n\r\nConcerning the magazine ... I feel we must make it unmistakably plain to\r\nthose in charge of it that the Baha'is would gladly and gratefully respond\r\nto the invitation to cooperate with those that are responsible for it\r\nimmediately they are fully satisfied that nothing is or will be published\r\nby them, whether in the magazine or elsewhere, that would, however\r\nindirectly, prejudice or reflect upon their conception of what the Baha'i\r\nMovement is or stands for. Should this be refused, and unfriendly and\r\nharmful matters be published against them, the attitude of all of us\r\nshould be a definite refusal to help and absolute non-interference, as\r\nwell as the absence of any form of retaliation which will instead of\r\nachieving our end defeat our purpose. We should leave him in the hands of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nAs to the suggestion of the Annual Convention being held next summer at\r\nGreen Acre, I believe it to be both wise and helpful, and trust that it\r\nwill forge another link between the Baha'is as a body and its founders and\r\ntrustees, and will serve to draw them closer and closer to the outward\r\nform as well as to the spirit of the activities of the friends in America.\r\n\r\nThe financial help extended recently by the friends in America to their\r\nfellow-workers of the Faith in Qadiyan, Punjab, has given us all intense\r\nsatisfaction and made us deeply grateful. Their contribution has\r\nimmediately been forwarded to them through the National Spiritual Assembly\r\nof India and Burma, and will, I am certain, enhance the prestige and the\r\ninfluence of the Cause.\r\n\r\nI feel that the conditions are now favorable for the circulation of the\r\nWill and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha only in manuscript form and among\r\nrecognized believers in America. Every such believer should be trusted\r\nwith a single copy with the express understanding that no duplicate copies\r\nor extracts of it be made or published anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'i Year Book\r\n\r\n\r\nThe suggestion made by my dear and able friend, Mr. Horace Holley, as to\r\nthe compilation of an annual \"Baha'i Year Book\" is extremely valuable and\r\ntimely. I am much impressed by it, and feel that an immediate start should\r\nbe made. I believe it can best be now undertaken under the direction and\r\nsupervision of your Assembly until the time should come for the friends in\r\nthe East and particularly Persia to participate effectually in its\r\ndevelopment. I trust you will send me a copy of the skeleton of the\r\nmaterial you propose to include, and I shall here attempt to fill up any\r\ngap and render any assistance I can to make it as comprehensive, as\r\nattractive, and as authoritative as possible.\r\n\r\nI am sending through my dear brother, Mr. M. Mills, various relics and\r\nTablets of our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, the only and priceless treasures of\r\nthe devoted gardener of Baha'u'llah's Shrine, Ustad Abu'l-Qasim Khurasani,\r\nwho has offered them to be preserved in his behalf in the Archives of the\r\nfriends in America. I am hoping to be able to send you in future precious\r\nadditions to what the Archives Committee has already collected, and may I\r\nin this connection express to those who have conceived so admirable a plan\r\nmy profound admiration and heartfelt gratitude.\r\n\r\nI wish to assure you in conclusion of my readiness and genuine desire to\r\nhelp you and serve you to the utmost of my ability. I fully realize the\r\nenormous burden that weighs on your shoulders, and am constantly mindful\r\nof the distinct and eminent share you are contributing to the advancement\r\nof the Cause. I wish you from the depths of my heart entire satisfaction\r\nin your glorious work. Our beloved Master is surely watching from the\r\nRealm Beyond over His children whom He nurtured and loved so well, and\r\nwill certainly guide you in every step you take, and crown your patient\r\nefforts with signal success.\r\n\r\nYour brother and fellow-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nNovember 27, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 16, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my dearly-beloved friends, the members of the American National\r\nSpiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nMy dear and precious fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nThe three communications dated November 19, November 22 and December 22,\r\nwhich I have recently received from that indefatigable servant of\r\nBaha'u'llah, my esteemed spiritual brother, Mr. Holley, have given me\r\ngreat satisfaction and have cheered and sustained me in my work. I have\r\nread most carefully the minutes of your December meeting and am\r\nparticularly pleased to note in many respects the notable advance you have\r\nmade in establishing the Cause upon a wider and surer foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of the Cause\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to the need, so often expressed, for an authentic and\r\ncomprehensive history of the Cause, I am glad to inform you of the action\r\ncontemplated by the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia in instructing\r\nand urging the local Assemblies throughout the country to take immediate\r\nsteps for the formation in every locality of a special committee which\r\nwill seek the assistance and the testimony of the remnants of the earliest\r\nbelievers and pioneers of the Cause in Persia in collecting most carefully\r\nall available evidence and data for the compilation of a comprehensive,\r\nreliable and representative history of the Movement from its earliest dawn\r\nto the present day. I have communicated with the National Assembly of\r\nPersia, regarding this urgent and vital necessity, and I feel the time is\r\nnot far distant when a free rendering into English of this stirring\r\nnarrative as well as an abridged form of it will be made available for\r\nboth the Baha'is and the general public in the West.\r\n\r\nThe efforts recently displayed by the Publishing Committee so clearly\r\nreflected in the minutes of their meeting of November 2, 1924, a copy of\r\nwhich I have read with the closest attention, indicate the efficiency, the\r\nzeal and the determination with which they are conducting this vital\r\nbranch of Baha'i activity. The scope of their effective work is expanding\r\nrapidly, and I wish to assure them one and all of my prayers for the\r\nfruition of their labors and the further development and consolidation of\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nThere have been of late no fresh developments in the situation of the\r\nHouse of Ba_gh_dad. The case, which is now before the court of First\r\nInstance, has been postponed for some time and we still await anxiously\r\nthe decision of the court. Any hope of an immediate and final solution of\r\nthis intricate problem seems for the present remote. In the event of our\r\nsuccess the case may still be referred by our powerful opponents to the\r\nCourt of Appeal--the highest in the land--and should its decision be in our\r\nfavor the government may at any time--as it does not seem unlikely--decide,\r\nby retaining the keys in its custody, to postpone indefinitely the\r\nexecution of such a verdict in order to allay the fierce hostility of the\r\nclerical element as well as the Shi'ite population of 'Iraq.\r\n\r\nShould a crisis occur, I will immediately inform you and endeavor to\r\ndefine more clearly any measure that I feel should be taken by the\r\nAmerican Assemblies to insure the security of the House of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'i Periodicals\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the publication of Baha'i periodicals in America, there is no\r\ndoubt whatsoever that every individual Baha'i is free to inaugurate and\r\nconduct any magazine of his own provided that nothing is published therein\r\nwhich in the estimation of the National Assembly tends in the least to\r\nbecome detrimental or injurious to the highest interests of the Cause.\r\nWithin these limits, and these limits only, private initiative should in\r\nno wise be discouraged and is indeed highly praiseworthy. It is for the\r\nNational Assembly, however, to exercise its judgment as to what extent the\r\nresources at their disposal enable them to aid financially the individual\r\nundertakings of the friends. Should the response of the friends and\r\nAssemblies to the appeals made on behalf of the National Fund be prompt,\r\nsustained and generous, the National Assembly will, I am certain, justify\r\nits sympathy, good-will and genuine cooperation with every individual\r\nBaha'i enterprise. I would, however, at this early state of our work,\r\nstrongly urge, nay entreat, the friends not to dissipate their efforts,\r\nbut to seek, after frank, mature and continuous deliberation, to arrive at\r\na common conclusion as to the most urgent requirements and needs of the\r\nhour, and having unified their views to strive to uphold and enforce them\r\nwith promptitude, wholeheartedness and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNews Letter\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first printed issue of the National Assembly's News Letter prepared\r\nand signed on behalf of the Assembly by its able secretary, stands as a\r\nbright and eloquent testimony of his thoroughness, his industry, his\r\nconspicuous ability, his undoubted self-sacrifice. The Cause is entering\r\nupon a new era of renewed and concerted activity. Its method of\r\npresentation has unmistakably improved, and this general advancement in\r\nstandard is in no small measure attributable to the distinctive capacity\r\nof your Assembly. My constant prayer is that He who watches over and\r\ninspires your manifold activities may bless more richly than ever before\r\nyour noble endeavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTemple Meetings\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to the matter of meeting in the Foundation Hall of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, I feel that the Foundation Hall should serve the\r\npurpose both of devotional gatherings where the revealed Word of God is\r\nread and chanted, and meetings at which subjects strictly Baha'i in\r\ncharacter are presented, propounded and discussed. I have no doubt that\r\nevery conscientious and thoughtful Baha'i will scrupulously and at all\r\ntimes observe the commandment of Baha'u'llah and the instructions of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha relative to the maintenance of the sacredness, the dignity,\r\nand the universality of an edifice that will in time become God's\r\nuniversal House of Worship.\r\n\r\nMay the blessings of our Almighty Master rest upon your deliberations.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nJanuary 16, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 29th, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the esteemed members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nMy well-beloved and precious fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nI have perused your recent communication, dated December 29th, and signed\r\non your behalf by your vigilant and capable secretary, with an interest\r\nand attention worthy of the paramount importance of the issues it raises.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the revision of the English version of the Hidden Words, in\r\nview of the rapidity of the sale of the copies recently printed, is of\r\nurgent importance. I shall as soon as my multitudinous preoccupations\r\npermit avail myself of the opportunity of Dr. Esslemont's happy sojourn in\r\nthe Holy Land to collaborate with him in any necessary alterations of the\r\ntext. I strongly hope, except in the event of unforeseen circumstances, to\r\nundertake this task in the course of this coming month.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the fundamental questions of general policy referred to\r\nin your letter, I feel that the basic principles, laid down but briefly\r\nstated in my past letters, which must guide the administration of the\r\naffairs of the Baha'i Movement, pending the definite formation of the\r\nfirst authoritative Universal House of Justice, must be further affirmed,\r\nelucidated, and explained in greater detail, for the complete knowledge of\r\nall the individual members of the vast and growing community of the\r\nbelievers in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Convention\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto the National Convention has been primarily called together for\r\nthe consideration of the various circumstances attending the election of\r\nthe National Spiritual Assembly. I feel, however, that in view of the\r\nexpansion and the growing importance of the administrative sphere of the\r\nCause, the general sentiments and tendencies prevailing among the friends,\r\nand the signs of increasing interdependence among the National Spiritual\r\nAssemblies throughout the world, the assembled accredited representatives\r\nof the American believers should exercise not only the vital and\r\nresponsible right of electing the National Assembly, but should also\r\nfulfill the functions of an enlightened, consultative and cooperative body\r\nthat will enrich the experience, enhance the prestige, support the\r\nauthority, and assist the deliberations of the National Spiritual\r\nAssembly. It is my firm conviction that it is the bounden duty, in the\r\ninterest of the Cause we all love and serve, of the members of the\r\nincoming National Assembly, once elected by the delegates at Convention\r\ntime, to seek and have the utmost regard, individually as well as\r\ncollectively, for the advice, the considered opinion and the true\r\nsentiments of the assembled delegates. Banishing every vestige of secrecy,\r\nof undue reticence, of dictatorial aloofness, from their midst, they\r\nshould radiantly and abundantly unfold to the eyes of the delegates, by\r\nwhom they are elected, their plans, their hopes, and their cares. They\r\nshould familiarize the delegates with the various matters that will have\r\nto be considered in the current year, and calmly and conscientiously study\r\nand weigh the opinions and judgments of the delegates. The newly elected\r\nNational Assembly, during the few days when the Convention is in session\r\nand after the dispersal of the delegates, should seek ways and means to\r\ncultivate understanding, facilitate and maintain the exchange of views,\r\ndeepen confidence, and vindicate by every tangible evidence their one\r\ndesire to serve and advance the common weal. Not infrequently, nay\r\noftentimes, the most lowly, untutored and inexperienced among the friends\r\nwill, by the sheer inspiring force of selfless and ardent devotion,\r\ncontribute a distinct and memorable share to a highly involved discussion\r\nin any given Assembly. Great must be the regard paid by those whom the\r\ndelegates call upon to serve in high position to this all-important though\r\ninconspicuous manifestation of the revealing power of sincere and earnest\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Spiritual Assembly, however, in view of the unavoidable\r\nlimitations imposed upon the convening of frequent and long-standing\r\nsessions of the Convention, will have to retain in its hands the final\r\ndecision on all matters that affect the interests of the Cause in America,\r\nsuch as the right to decide whether any local Assembly is functioning in\r\naccordance with the principles laid down for the conduct and the\r\nadvancement of the Cause. It is my earnest prayer that they will utilize\r\ntheir highly responsible position, not only for the wise and efficient\r\nconduct of the affairs of the Cause, but also for the extension and\r\ndeepening of the spirit of cordiality and wholehearted and mutual support\r\nin their cooperation with the body of their co-workers throughout the\r\nland. The seating of delegates to the Convention, i.e., the right to\r\ndecide upon the validity of the credentials of the delegates at a given\r\nConvention, is vested in the outgoing National Assembly, and the right to\r\ndecide who has the voting privilege is also ultimately placed in the hands\r\nof the National Spiritual Assembly, either when a local Spiritual Assembly\r\nis for the first time being formed in a given locality, or when\r\ndifferences arise between a new applicant and an already established local\r\nAssembly. While the Convention is in session and the accredited delegates\r\nhave already elected from among the believers throughout the country the\r\nmembers of the National Spiritual Assembly for the current year, it is of\r\ninfinite value and a supreme necessity that as far as possible all matters\r\nrequiring immediate decision should be fully and publicly considered, and\r\nan endeavor be made to obtain after mature deliberation, unanimity in\r\nvital decisions. Indeed, it has ever been the cherished desire of our\r\nMaster, 'Abdu'l-Baha, that the friends in their councils, local as well as\r\nnational, should by their candor, their honesty of purpose, their\r\nsingleness of mind, and the thoroughness of their discussions, achieve\r\nunanimity in all things. Should this in certain cases prove impracticable\r\nthe verdict of the majority should prevail, to which decision the minority\r\nmust under all circumstances, gladly, spontaneously and continually,\r\nsubmit.\r\n\r\nNothing short of the all-encompassing, all-pervading power of His Guidance\r\nand Love can enable this newly-enfolded order to gather strength and\r\nflourish amid the storm and stress of a turbulent age, and in the fulness\r\nof time vindicate its high claim to be universally recognized as the one\r\nHaven of abiding felicity and peace.\r\n\r\nRegarding the pamphlet entitled \"The Passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha,\" I believe\r\nsome additional material, consisting mainly of a few selections from\r\nleading American newspapers, would increase its value and extend its\r\nscope. I shall be glad to receive a copy of the reprinted edition, and I\r\nwish you success in this endeavor.\r\n\r\nMy dearly-beloved friend and fellow-worker, Mr. Mountfort Mills, is now\r\nwith me in Haifa, and will ere long join you in the discharge of your\r\nmanifold and arduous duties. I greatly value his assistance in the\r\ndifficult task and the complex and often urgent problems that are before\r\nme, and I trust that his return to America will lend a fresh impetus to\r\nthe glorious work of service you are rendering to the Cause of\r\nBaha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nI wish you success from all my heart.\r\n\r\nYour brother and fellow-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nJanuary 29th, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of April 10th, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nMy dearly-beloved fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nThe communications lately received from your distinguished secretary,\r\ndated January 8th, February 6th and 13th, and March 17th, together with\r\nthe enclosed minutes, reports and letters, have been read with profound\r\ninterest and genuine satisfaction. The methods you pursue, the new\r\nmeasures for publicity which you have adopted, the increasing confidence\r\nyou have achieved, and the degree of support, both moral and financial,\r\nwhich you have deservedly earned from the body of the believers are all\r\nencouraging signs that testify to the growing solidarity of a Cause\r\ndestined to confer inestimable benefits upon mankind.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the promise of the Movement for the future, it has already\r\nrevealed in a remarkable manner to every unprejudiced observer its\r\nindomitable spirit of loving sacrifice and true fellowship burning with\r\nundiminished ardor in the breasts of its followers both in the land of its\r\nbirth and in the great Republic of the West. The heroism and fortitude\r\nlately displayed by its sorely-tried adherents in Persia, and the prompt\r\nand generous contributions of the American believers who have\r\nspontaneously responded to the call of their needy brethren of the East\r\nhave served to kindle the flame of enthusiasm in many a heart, and forged\r\nfresh bonds of fellowship which will prove of the highest value for the\r\nadvancement of the Baha'i Faith. I would specially request you to convey\r\nto all the friends in the name of the oppressed Baha'is of Persia, and\r\nparticularly the homeless sufferers of Nayriz, the expression of their\r\ndeepest gratitude and highest appreciation. May America's noble donations\r\ndraw even as a magnet the blessings of the Almighty Giver upon the task it\r\nhas set itself to achieve!\r\n\r\nI am delighted to learn of the evidences of growing interest, of the\r\nsympathetic understanding, and brotherly cooperation on the part of two\r\ncapable and steadfast servants of the One True God, Dr. H. Randall and Dr.\r\nGuthrie, whose participation in our work I hope and pray will widen the\r\nscope of our activities, enrich our opportunities, and lend a fresh\r\nimpetus to our endeavors. I wish them happiness and success from all my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNews Letter\r\n\r\n\r\nThe News Letter which you have lately initiated fulfills a very vital\r\nfunction and has been started admirably well. I would urge you to enlarge\r\nits scope, as much as your resources permit, that in time it may devote a\r\nspecial section to every phase of your activities, administrative,\r\ndevotional, humanitarian, financial, educational and otherwise. That it\r\nmay attain its object it must combine the essential qualities of accuracy,\r\nreliability, thoroughness, dignity and wisdom. It should become a great\r\nfactor in promoting understanding, providing information on Baha'i\r\nactivity, both local and foreign, in stimulating interest, in combating\r\nevil influences, and in upholding and safeguarding the institutions of the\r\nCause. It should be made as representative as possible, should be replete\r\nwith news, up-to-date in its information, and should arouse the keenest\r\ninterest among believers and admirers alike in every corner of the globe.\r\nI cherish great hopes for its immediate future, and I trust you will\r\ndevote your special attention to its development, and by devising\r\nwell-conceived and worldwide measures transform this News Letter into what\r\nI hope will become the foremost Baha'i Journal of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle of Assemblies\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the title to be adopted for letterheads, I would suggest, pending\r\nthe formation of the Universal House of Justice, the phrase \"The National\r\nSpiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada,\"\r\nretaining the word \"spiritual\" and restricting the meaning of the term\r\n\"assembly\" to be applied only to the body of nine elected by the friends\r\nwhether for local or national purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepresentation at Convention\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already replied to your cable in connection with the representation\r\nof groups of less than nine adult believers at the annual Convention and\r\nthe matter of proxy, the latter being left to the discretion of the\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly. Should the conditions be altered, and the\r\nnumber of Baha'i localities multiply, the situation will have to be\r\nconsidered afresh and a new basis for representation adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mashriqu'l-Adhkar\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, I would again most emphatically urge\r\nthe believers in America, and ask you to do the utmost you can to devise\r\nevery possible means for the removal of every outstanding financial\r\nliability incurred in this connection. I would remind you of the supreme\r\nand urgent necessity of raising the full sum decided upon by the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly at its meeting in Chicago in order to meet the\r\nimmediate needs of this great future House of Worship. I would welcome a\r\nfull, authorized and up-to-date statement on its present situation, its\r\nassets and liabilities and an estimate of the cost for its completion.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I wish to renew the assurance of my ardent prayers for you\r\nand for those whom you represent in safeguarding and promoting the sacred\r\ninterests of so precious a Cause. I am fully alive to the vastness and\r\ndelicacy of your task, I heartily appreciate your indefatigable efforts\r\nand unflinching determination, I am continually reminded of our Master's\r\nassurances of a dazzling future before you. May His love enfold you, His\r\nSpirit guide you, and His power enable you to achieve signal victory.\r\n\r\nYour brother in the Master's service,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nApril 10th, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of May 12, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the American National Assembly.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nI have read with deep interest your two recent communications dated April\r\n4th and 18th, and am gratified to learn of the steady expansion of your\r\nmanifold activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElection of National Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the method to be adopted for the election of the National\r\nSpiritual Assemblies, it is clear that the text of the Beloved's Testament\r\ngives us no indication as to the manner in which these Assemblies are to\r\nbe elected. In one of His earliest Tablets, however, addressed to a friend\r\nin Persia, the following is expressly recorded:--\r\n\r\n\"At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint their\r\ndelegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and these\r\nrepresentatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the Supreme\r\nBaytu'l-'Adl (Universal House of Justice).\"\r\n\r\nThese words clearly indicate that a three-stage election has been provided\r\nby 'Abdu'l-Baha for the formation of the International House of Justice,\r\nand as it is explicitly provided in His Will and Testament that the\r\n\"Secondary House of Justice (i.e., National Assemblies) must elect the\r\nmembers of the Universal One,\" it is obvious that the members of the\r\nNational Spiritual Assemblies will have to be indirectly elected by the\r\nbody of the believers in their respective provinces. In view of these\r\ncomplementary instructions the principle, set forth in my letter of March\r\n12th, 1923, has been established requiring the believers (the beloved of\r\nGod) in every country to elect a certain number of delegates who, in turn,\r\nwill elect their national representatives (Secondary House of Justice or\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly) whose sacred obligation and privilege will be\r\nto elect in time God's Universal House of Justice.\r\n\r\nShould the appointing of the delegates be made a part of the functions of\r\nlocal Spiritual Assemblies, who are already elected bodies, the principle\r\nof a four-stage election would be introduced which would be at variance\r\nwith the provisions explicitly laid down in the Master's Tablet. On the\r\nother hand, were the local Spiritual Assemblies, the number of whose\r\nmembers is strictly confined to nine, to elect directly the members of the\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly--thus maintaining the principle of a\r\nthree-stage election--all Baha'i localities, which must necessarily differ\r\nin numerical strength, would then have to share equally in the election of\r\nthe National Spiritual Assembly--a practice which would be contrary to\r\nfairness and justice. Moreover, the central principle guiding for the\r\npresent the administration of the Cause has been to make the Baha'i\r\nNational Spiritual Assemblies as independent as possible in the conduct of\r\nsuch affairs as fall within their province, and to lessen the hampering\r\ninfluence of any institution within their jurisdiction that might, whether\r\ndirectly or indirectly, impair their authority and prestige.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembership Roll\r\n\r\n\r\nI would also strongly urge the members of every incoming National\r\nSpiritual Assembly to take all necessary steps to insure that every local\r\nAssembly throughout America, without any exception whatsoever, should\r\nimmediately after its election send the complete list of its members\r\ntogether with the full address of its secretary to the National Secretary,\r\nwho in turn will forward them to me directly, enclosing his own address as\r\nwell as the list of the members of the National Spiritual Assembly. It\r\nwould also be extremely helpful, should actual circumstances permit, to\r\ndevise with the wholehearted assistance of every local Assembly ways and\r\nmeans for the compilation of an authoritative, up-to-date, and exhaustive\r\nlist of recognized believers in America, supplemented by the full address\r\nof each believer's permanent residence--this list to be continually revised\r\naccording to every change affecting the residence and number of such\r\nbelievers. This would be particularly advisable in view of the permanent\r\nresidence of isolated believers in various parts of the country, as well\r\nas of those who form parts of groups as yet numerically too small for the\r\nformation of a local Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nHowever desirable these steps may be, it is evident that they are\r\nsecondary in their importance and urgency to the pressing and\r\never-increasing issues that vitally affect the spread and the\r\nconsolidation of the work which you are called upon to perform, and which\r\nit is my privilege to assist in and serve. I am enclosing a preliminary\r\nlist of Baha'i centers throughout the world, exclusive of Persia, which,\r\nthough inadequate, may still, I trust, be of some help to you. I would\r\nwelcome any additions or corrections you might be able to make and hope it\r\nwill evolve into a valuable section of the contemplated Baha'i Year Book.\r\n\r\nI wish to assure you, in conclusion, of my heartfelt appreciation of your\r\ndevoted labors in the Divine Vineyard.\r\n\r\nYour brother and fellow-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nMay 12, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of June 3rd, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful, the delegates and\r\nvisitors to the Baha'i Convention, Green Acre, Maine, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nFellow-laborers in the Vineyard of God:\r\n\r\nOnce again the hand of divine power has gathered together the chosen\r\nrepresentatives of the American believers, assembled this time amid the\r\npleasant surroundings of a blest and beloved spot, to deliberate upon the\r\nmost effective measures that will insure the advancement of the Cause of\r\nBaha'u'llah. I feel it a pleasure and privilege to offer you these few\r\nthoughts as my humble contribution to the proceedings of your annual\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nMay I at the outset reaffirm my feelings of gratitude and keen\r\nappreciation for the eminent share which the friends in America,\r\nindividually as well as by their collective efforts, have contributed to\r\nease the burden of responsibility and care that has so often oppressed my\r\nheart. Your steadfastness, your unsparing devotion; your self-sacrifice in\r\nupholding and fostering the institutions of the Cause; the notable advance\r\nyou have achieved in the coordination of your activities; the remarkable\r\nsolicitude you have shown, and the magnificent response you have made on\r\nbehalf of the oppressed and needy among your brethren; the measures you\r\nhave initiated, the hindrances you have removed and the means and methods\r\nyou have perfected--these and others beside have established you in the\r\nconfidence, the esteem and the admiration of all the Baha'i world. I\r\npersonally appreciate and am thankful for your unfailing supplications and\r\nspecial prayers on my behalf. I am deeply touched by your expressions of\r\nunwavering faith, of loyalty and affection, and fully reciprocate your\r\nbrotherly sentiments and your keen desire and readiness to collaborate\r\nwith me more closely and effectively than ever before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurpose of Convention\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now regarding this forthcoming Convention, I feel that the dominating\r\npurpose inspiring the assembled friends, delegates and visitors alike,\r\nshould be a two-fold one. The first is a challenge to the individual, the\r\nsecond a collective responsibility. The one seeks to reinforce the motive\r\npower of our spiritual activities, the second aims at raising the standard\r\nof administrative efficiency so vitally needed at this advanced stage of\r\nour work. We should first and foremost endeavor by every conceivable means\r\nto revitalize our precious Cause, rudely shaken by the constant\r\nvicissitudes attending the outward departure of a vigilant and gracious\r\nMaster. Our next object should be to seek to approach, through more\r\nintimate association, fuller and more frequent consultations, and a closer\r\nfamiliarity with the character, the mission and the teachings of the\r\nCause, that standard of excellence which should characterize the\r\ncooperative efforts of Baha'i Communities in every land.\r\n\r\nHigh aims and pure motives, however laudable in themselves, will surely\r\nnot suffice if unsupported by measures that are practicable and methods\r\nthat are sound. Wealth of sentiment, abundance of good-will and effort,\r\nwill prove of little avail if we should fail to exercise discrimination\r\nand restraint and neglect to direct their flow along the most profitable\r\nchannels. The unfettered freedom of the individual should be tempered with\r\nmutual consultation and sacrifice, and the spirit of initiative and\r\nenterprise should be reinforced by a deeper realization of the supreme\r\nnecessity for concerted action and a fuller devotion to the common weal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible at this stage to ignore the indispensability or to\r\noverestimate the unique significance of the institution of the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly--the pivot round which revolve the activities of the\r\nbelievers throughout the American continent. Supreme is their position,\r\ngrave their responsibilities, manifold and arduous their duties. How great\r\nthe privilege, how delicate the task of the assembled delegates whose\r\nfunction it is to elect such national representatives as would by their\r\nrecord of service ennoble and enrich the annals of the Cause! If we but\r\nturn our gaze to the high qualifications of the members of Baha'i\r\nAssemblies, as enumerated in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets, we are filled with\r\nfeelings of unworthiness and dismay, and would feel truly disheartened but\r\nfor the comforting thought that if we rise to play nobly our part every\r\ndeficiency in our lives will be more than compensated by the\r\nall-conquering spirit of His grace and power. Hence it is incumbent upon\r\nthe chosen delegates to consider without the least trace of passion and\r\nprejudice, and irrespective of any material consideration, the names of\r\nonly those who can best combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned\r\nloyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized\r\nability and mature experience. May the incoming National Spiritual\r\nAssembly--the privileged and chosen servants of the Cause--immortalize their\r\nterm of stewardship by deeds of loving service, deeds that will redound to\r\nthe honor, the glory and the power of the Most Great Name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cornerstone of Service\r\n\r\n\r\nI would also earnestly entreat all the delegates at this coming\r\nConvention, and through them I appeal to the larger body of believers whom\r\nthey represent, to ever bear in mind the supreme injunction of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha, to teach unceasingly until the \"head cornerstone of the\r\nfoundation\" of the Cause of God is firmly established in every heart. Let\r\nthose whose time, resources and means allow, travel throughout the length\r\nand breadth of that vast continent, let them scatter to the most distant\r\nregions of the earth and, fired with enthusiasm and detachment, hand on\r\nthe torch of God's undying flame to the waiting multitudes of a\r\nsadly-stricken world.\r\n\r\nOne word more in conclusion. Let the West, and particularly the Great\r\nRepublic of the New World, where a quarter of a century ago Baha'u'llah's\r\nBanner was firmly implanted, realize that upon it now rests the\r\nresponsibility of achieving the universal recognition of the Baha'i Faith,\r\nof fulfilling 'Abdu'l-Baha's fondest hopes.\r\n\r\nPersia, the cradle of an unfolding world civilization, is still bereft of\r\nher freedom, sunk in ignorance, a prey to contending policies and\r\nfactions, beset on one hand by the powers of orthodoxy and sectarian\r\nfanaticism and assailed on the other by the forces of materialism and\r\nunbelief. In her evil plight she is radiantly confident that the Flame she\r\nhad kindled in the world will, in the fullness of time, blaze forth in the\r\nheart of the mighty West and shed redeeming illumination upon the silent\r\nsufferers of a distracted country. Will it be America, will it be one of\r\nthe nations of Europe, that will seize the torch of Divine Guidance from\r\nPersia's fettered hands and with it set the western world aflame? May your\r\nConvention, by its spirit, its resolutions and its accomplishments, give\r\nto that country's urgent call a noble and decisive answer.\r\n\r\nYour brother and fellow-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nJune 3rd, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of October 24th, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nMy well-beloved friends:\r\n\r\nThe numerous communications which your distinguished Secretary has lately\r\naddressed on your behalf to the Greatest Holy Leaf and myself, have been\r\neagerly perused and their contents carefully noted. The news they imparted\r\nand the spirit they revealed have caused us both genuine satisfaction, and\r\nhave served to intensify the feelings of joyous confidence, of pride and\r\ngratitude with which we have greeted the inauguration of your term of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe notable advance achieved by this year's memorable Convention is, I am\r\ncertain, attributable in no small measure to the energy, the thoroughness,\r\nthe insight and the loving-kindness that have characterized in an\r\nunprecedented degree the activities of the outgoing National Spiritual\r\nAssembly. I am confident that the work of America's newly elected\r\nrepresentatives, so splendidly and auspiciously begun, will further\r\nconsolidate the labors of the past, will resolve to a great extent the\r\nproblems and perplexities of the present, and open up fresh fields of\r\nfuture achievements and service.\r\n\r\nI rejoice to learn that ways and means have been found to enable the\r\nNational Secretary, who discharges in such an exemplary manner the\r\nmanifold and exacting duties of a highly responsible position, to devote\r\nall his time to the pursuit of so meritorious a task. I am fully conscious\r\nof the privations and sacrifice which the choice of this arduous work must\r\ninvolve for him, as well as for his devoted and selfless companion; I\r\ncannot but admire and extol their heroic efforts; and wish to assure them\r\nboth of my continued prayers for the speedy fruition of their earnest\r\nendeavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQualifications of a Believer\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the very delicate and complex question of ascertaining the\r\nqualifications of a true believer, I cannot in this connection emphasize\r\ntoo strongly the supreme necessity for the exercise of the utmost\r\ndiscretion, caution and tact, whether it be in deciding for ourselves as\r\nto who may be regarded a true believer or in disclosing to the outside\r\nworld such considerations as may serve as a basis for such a decision. I\r\nwould only venture to state very briefly and as adequately as present\r\ncircumstances permit the principal factors that must be taken into\r\nconsideration before deciding whether a person may be regarded a true\r\nbeliever or not. Full recognition of the station of the Forerunner, the\r\nAuthor, and the True Exemplar of the Baha'i Cause, as set forth in\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's Testament; unreserved acceptance of, and submission to,\r\nwhatsoever has been revealed by their Pen; loyal and steadfast adherence\r\nto every clause of our Beloved's sacred Will; and close association with\r\nthe spirit as well as the form of the present day Baha'i administration\r\nthroughout the world--these I conceive to be the fundamental and primary\r\nconsiderations that must be fairly, discreetly and thoughtfully\r\nascertained before reaching such a vital decision. Any attempt at further\r\nanalysis and elucidation will, I fear, land us in barren discussions and\r\neven grave controversies that would prove not only futile but even\r\ndetrimental to the best interests of a growing Cause. I would therefore\r\nstrongly urge those who are called upon to make such a decision to\r\napproach this highly involved and ever-recurring problem with the spirit\r\nof humble prayer, and earnest consultation, and to refrain from drawing\r\nrigidly the line of demarcation except on such occasions when the\r\ninterests of the Cause absolutely demand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Convention\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the annual holding of the Baha'i Convention and\r\nCongress, I feel that although such a representative body need not be\r\nconvened necessarily every year, yet it is highly desirable, in view of\r\nthe unique functions it fulfills in promoting harmony and good-will, in\r\nremoving misunderstandings and in enhancing the prestige of the Cause,\r\nthat the National Spiritual Assembly should exert itself to gather\r\ntogether annually the elected representatives of the American believers.\r\nIt would in some ways be obviously convenient and eminently desirable\r\nthough not absolutely essential, if the National Spiritual Assembly could\r\narrange that the holding of such a Congress should synchronize with the\r\ntime at which the national elections are renewed, and that both events\r\nshould take place, if not on the first of Ridvan, at least during the\r\ntwelve joyous days of what may be justly regarded as the foremost Baha'i\r\nFestival. Apart from the local elections, which universally are to be\r\nrenewed on the 21st day of April, it is entirely left to the discretion of\r\nthe National Spiritual Assembly to decide, after having given due\r\nconsideration to the above mentioned observations, on whatever time and\r\nplace the Baha'i Convention as well as the annual elections are to be\r\nheld. Were the National Spiritual Assembly to decide, after mature\r\ndeliberations, to omit the holding of the Baha'i Convention and Congress\r\nin a given year, then they could, only in such a case, devise ways and\r\nmeans to insure that the annual election of the National Spiritual\r\nAssembly should be held by mail, provided it can be conducted with\r\nsufficient thoroughness, efficiency and dispatch. It would also appear to\r\nme unobjectionable to enable and even to require in the last resort such\r\ndelegates as cannot possibly undertake the journey to the seat of the\r\nBaha'i Convention to send their votes, for the election of the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly only, by mail to the National Secretary, as in my view\r\nthe advantages of such a procedure outweigh the considerations referred to\r\nin your letter. It should, however, be made clear to every elected\r\ndelegate--who should be continually reminded--that it is a sacred\r\nresponsibility and admittedly preferable to attend if possible in person\r\nthe sessions of the Convention, to take an active part in all its\r\nproceedings, and to acquaint his fellow-workers on his return with the\r\naccomplishments, the decisions and the aspirations of the assembled\r\nrepresentatives of the American believers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'i Year Book\r\n\r\n\r\nI am eagerly looking forward to your sending me in manuscript form the\r\nprojected Baha'i Year Book, that I may be enabled to contribute my share\r\nin rendering it as comprehensive, as attractive, and as authoritative as\r\npossible. I strongly advise you to combine in a judicious manner the two\r\nmethods outlined in this connection in your letter of September 2, 1925. A\r\nshort, concise and forceful account of the primary objects, as well as of\r\nthe principles underlying the worldwide administration of the Cause,\r\ntogether with a brief description of various features of the present day\r\nadministration of its activities, supplemented with a not-too-detailed\r\nsurvey of the actual accomplishments and plans evolved in the current\r\nyear, would serve to acquaint the outsider with the purpose and the\r\nachievements of the Cause, and provide sufficient material that would be\r\nedifying and helpful to the active believers whether in the East or in the\r\nWest....\r\n\r\nThe Greatest Holy Leaf desires me to convey in her name to the esteemed\r\nmembers of the Green Acre Fellowship the expression of her cordial thanks\r\nand sincere appreciation in having been made a life member of the said\r\nFellowship. She assures them of her prayers for the success of this noble\r\ninstitution as well as for the spiritual advancement of its individual\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nRecent developments in the Holy Land have led various organizations in the\r\nJewish world to contemplate seriously the early possibility of\r\ntransferring to Palestine's sacred soil the mortal remains of certain\r\nprominent founders and leaders of Jewish thought, and Mount Carmel, which\r\nnext to Akka's Most Holy Shrine is the most cherished object of Baha'i\r\nveneration, has been cited on various occasions as a permanent and most\r\nbefitting burial ground for their illustrious dead. Surely the Baha'is of\r\nthe world, ever on the alert and with an eye to the future, will, no\r\nmatter how pressed by financial obligations, arise while there is yet time\r\nto contribute each his share in securing for posterity such land as lies\r\nin close proximity to the Holy Shrine--an area the acquisition of which in\r\ntime will prove indispensable if the sublime vision of 'Abdu'l-Baha is to\r\nbe realized. I appeal to you, and through you to every earnest and\r\nconscientious believer, to safeguard in particular the land extending\r\nsouthward from these Shrines which now, alas! is gravely exposed to the\r\nassaults of covetous and speculating interests. I am loth to press further\r\nclaims on friends who have displayed so magnificent a spirit of\r\nself-sacrifice on several occasions in the past, but I feel the urge of a\r\nsacred and impelling responsibility to call your attention to what I\r\nconceive to be one of the worldwide issues of the greatest moment\r\nrequiring a prompt, generous and collective response. I may add that\r\nwhatever land is purchased will be registered in the name of the\r\ncontributor, and I would therefore request every contributing believer to\r\nforward together with his donation such power of attorney as will legally\r\nempower me to transact in his name and on his behalf the purchase of the\r\nplot he desires to acquire. It would be desirable to forward small\r\ncontributions to the National Spiritual Assembly, who will then decide\r\nupon the manner in which the transaction should be conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersecution of Persian Baha'is\r\n\r\n\r\nThe compilation of newspaper clippings with regard to recent persecutions\r\nin Persia which has been sent by our dear brother, Mr. H. Holley, to the\r\nGreatest Holy Leaf has been forwarded to the National Spiritual Assembly\r\nof Persia, that they may witness for themselves and share with the rank\r\nand file of the Persian believers the results of the extensive and\r\nvigorous campaign so promptly undertaken on their behalf by their\r\nsympathetic brethren in the West. It grieves me to inform you that this\r\nsad tale of barbarism and unrestrained aggression on the property, the\r\nlives and the honor of the heroic sufferers in that land is still\r\ncontinuing to reach our ears, and the campaign of obstruction, of\r\nintimidation and plunder is, but for short periods of comparative lull,\r\nbeing systematically pursued with unabated vigor. I am certain that the\r\nmembers of the National Spiritual Assembly, fully alive to the\r\nuncertainty, the confusion and the seriousness of the present situation,\r\nwill seize the first opportunity to redress as much as it lies in their\r\npower the interminable grievances that are being inflicted upon harassed\r\nyet law-abiding citizens.\r\n\r\nWishing you success from all my heart, and assuring you of my continued\r\nprayers for the steady expansion and consolidation of your work,\r\n\r\nI am, your brother and fellow-worker,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nOctober 24th, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of November 6, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.\r\n\r\nMy dear fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nTwo recent communications of your able secretary, dated Oct. 14th and\r\n15th, have been received and read with deep gratitude and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mashriqu'l-Adhkar\r\n\r\n\r\nI rejoice to learn of the prompt and well-considered measures you have\r\nundertaken to evolve, in conjunction with all local Assemblies and groups,\r\na wise and effective plan for the contribution of America's befitting\r\nshare in response to the appeal lately addressed to the American believers\r\nregarding the work of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar. Surely the great company\r\nof eager and sympathizing believers throughout the East will, as they\r\nincreasingly witness the evidences of a revival of activity along this\r\nline, arise to lend a helping hand to this vast endeavor. They will not\r\nfail to extend their support in alleviating the burden that is now borne\r\nso joyously and gratefully by their younger brethren in North America. I\r\nshall myself do all in my power to hasten the fruition of your\r\nself-sacrificing labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Baha'i Shrine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sad and sudden crisis that has arisen in connection with the ownership\r\nof Baha'u'llah's sacred house in Ba_gh_dad has sent a thrill of\r\nindignation and dismay throughout the whole of the Baha'i world. Houses\r\nthat have been occupied by Baha'u'llah for well nigh the whole period of\r\nHis exile in 'Iraq; ordained by Him as the chosen and sanctified object of\r\nBaha'i pilgrimage in future; magnified and extolled in countless Tablets\r\nand Epistles as the sacred center \"round which shall circle all peoples\r\nand kindreds of the earth\"--lie now, due to fierce intrigue and ceaseless\r\nfanatical opposition, at the mercy of the declared enemies of the Cause.\r\n\r\nI have instantly communicated with every Baha'i center in both East and\r\nWest, and urgently requested the faithful followers of the Faith in every\r\nland to protest vehemently against this glaring perversion of justice, to\r\nassert firmly and courteously the spiritual rights of the Baha'i Community\r\nto the ownership of this venerated house, to plead for British fairness\r\nand justice, and to pledge their unswerving determination to insure the\r\nsecurity of this hallowed spot.\r\n\r\nConscious of the fact that this property has been occupied by Baha'i\r\nauthorized representatives for an uninterrupted period of not less than\r\nthirty years, and having successfully won their case at the Justice of\r\nPeace and the Court of First Instance, the Baha'is the world over cannot\r\nbelieve that the high sense of honor and fairness which inspires the\r\nBritish Administration of 'Iraq will ever tolerate such grave miscarriage\r\nof justice. They confidently appeal to the public opinion of the world for\r\nthe defense and protection of their legitimate rights now sorely trampled\r\nunder the feet of relentless enemies.\r\n\r\nWidespread and effective publicity along these lines, in well-conceived\r\nand carefully worded terms, is strongly recommended for it will\r\nundoubtedly serve to facilitate the solution of this delicate and\r\nperplexing problem.\r\n\r\nHaving exerted ourselves to the utmost of our ability let us rest assured\r\nin the power of the Lord, who keepeth watch over His house, and who will,\r\nno matter how dark present prospects appear, assure for generations yet\r\nunborn His cherished and holy edifice. I shall acquaint you with every\r\ndevelopment of the case, and will advise you as to the measures that\r\nshould be taken whether we decide to institute fresh proceedings or to\r\nappeal to higher legal authorities in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Acre\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the important step that has been taken for the eventual\r\ninclusion of Green Acre Fellowship within the orbit of the activities of\r\nthe American National Spiritual Assembly, I hope and pray that this new\r\nprivilege and added responsibility will prove highly beneficial in its\r\nresults, both to Green Acre itself and the general interests of the Cause\r\nin America. In a separate communication addressed to the Chairman of the\r\nsaid Fellowship, our dearly-beloved and self-sacrificing brother, Mr. W.\r\nRandall, I will express my warm approval of this constructive step, and my\r\nardent hopes for the quicker unfolding and fuller expansion under the\r\nfostering care of the National Spiritual Assembly, of Green Acre's unique\r\nand sublime mission in life. I shall follow in this connection with the\r\nkeenest interest the course of your activities in accordance with the\r\npolicy outlined in your letter of October 14th, and feel that the greatest\r\nstress must be laid upon the necessity of exemplifying in a most liberal\r\nand practical manner the driving power hidden in this Divine Revelation,\r\nrather than upon the idle reiteration of a set of principles, however\r\nexalted and unique in their character. May the National Fund so flourish\r\nas to enable its Trustees to undertake such measures as will eloquently\r\ntestify to a sorely stricken humanity the healing power of God's Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJurisdiction of a Local Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nMay I remind you regarding the situation in San Francisco that no two\r\nindependent Baha'i centers can possibly be recognized in the same city,\r\nand that the center which bears my name should act in all matters only\r\nwith the full consent and approval of the San Francisco Spiritual\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVoting Rights of National Assembly Members\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the election of alternate members to the National Spiritual\r\nAssembly, I feel that only the nine original members of the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly are entitled to vote, whereas such alternate members as\r\nmay be elected should be asked to fill vacancies only in a consultative\r\ncapacity and not be entitled to vote. They should not be regarded as part\r\nof the quorum (i.e., five out of the nine original members) which is\r\nnecessary for the transaction of the business of the National Assembly.\r\nAll secondary matters that do not affect the principle outlined are left\r\nto the discretion of the National Spiritual Assemblies who will decide\r\naccording to the exigencies of their respective circumstances.\r\n\r\nAssuring you of my deep appreciation of your continued efforts, and of my\r\nunceasing prayers on your behalf,\r\n\r\nI am your grateful brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nNovember 6, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of November 30, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful in the East and in\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nDear fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nIt is with feelings of overwhelming sorrow that I communicate to you the\r\nnews of yet another loss which the Almighty, in His inscrutable wisdom,\r\nhas chosen to inflict upon our beloved Cause. On the 22nd of November,\r\n1925, that memorable and sacred day in which the Baha'is of the Orient\r\ncelebrated the twin Festivals of the Declaration of the Bab and the\r\nbirthday of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Dr. John E. Esslemont passed on to the Abha\r\nKingdom. His end was as swift as it was unexpected. Suffering from the\r\neffects of a chronic and insidious disease, he fell at last a victim to\r\nthe inevitable complications that ensued, the fatal course of which\r\nneither the efforts of vigilant physicians nor the devoted cares of his\r\nmany friends could possibly deflect.\r\n\r\nHe bore his sufferings with admirable fortitude, with calm resignation and\r\ncourage. Though convinced that his ailment would never henceforth forsake\r\nhim, yet many a time he revealed a burning desire that the friends\r\nresiding in the Holy Land should, while visiting the Shrines, implore the\r\nAll-merciful to prolong his days that he may bring to a fuller completion\r\nhis humble share of service to the Threshold of Baha'u'llah. To this noble\r\nrequest all hearts warmly responded. But this was not to be. His close\r\nassociation with my work in Haifa, in which I had placed the fondest\r\nhopes, was suddenly cut short. His book,(12) however--an abiding monument\r\nto his pure intention--will, alone, inspire generations yet unborn to tread\r\nthe path of truth and service as steadfastly and as unostentatiously as\r\nwas trodden by its beloved author. The Cause he loved so well, he served\r\neven unto his last day with exemplary faith and unstinted devotion. His\r\ntenacity of faith, his high integrity, his self-effacement, his industry\r\nand painstaking labors were traits of a character the noble qualities of\r\nwhich will live and live forever after him. To me personally he was the\r\nwarmest of friends, a trusted counsellor, an indefatigable collaborator, a\r\nlovable companion.\r\n\r\nWith tearful eyes I supplicate at the Threshold of Baha'u'llah--and request\r\nyou all to join--in my ardent prayers, for the fuller unfolding in the\r\nrealms beyond of a soul that has already achieved so high a spiritual\r\nstanding in this world. For by the beauty of his character, by his\r\nknowledge of the Cause, by the conspicuous achievements of his book, he\r\nhas immortalized his name, and by sheer merit deserved to rank as one of\r\nthe Hands of the Cause of God.\r\n\r\nHe has been laid to rest in the heart of that beautifully situated Baha'i\r\nburial ground at the foot of Carmel, close to the mortal remains of that\r\nvenerable soul, Haji Mirza Vakilu'd-Dawlih, the illustrious cousin of the\r\nBab and chief builder of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of I_sh_qabad. Pilgrims\r\nvisiting his grave from far and near will, with pride and gratitude, do\r\nhonor to a name that adorned the annals of an Immortal Cause.\r\n\r\nMay he eternally rest in peace.\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nNovember 30, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 10, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved fellow-workers in the Vineyard of God!\r\n\r\nYour letter dated Nov. 9, 1925, has been received and read with feelings\r\nof deep satisfaction and gratitude. It is most unfortunate that, owing to\r\nunavoidable circumstances, I have been prevented from communicating more\r\nfully and frequently with the distinguished representatives of those dear\r\nfellow-workers of mine, the progress of whose accomplishments I am\r\ncontinually following with the liveliest expectations, loving sympathy and\r\ncheerful hope.\r\n\r\nThe multiplicity of vital and pressing issues, arising out of the steady\r\nexpansion of the Movement in various parts of the world; the pain and\r\nsorrow so keenly felt at the sudden passing of distinguished and\r\ndearly-beloved servants of the Cause; grave and unexpected developments in\r\nthe Holy Land and elsewhere--have all in rapid succession greatly added to\r\nthe already oppressive burden of responsibility and care which it is my\r\nlot and privilege to shoulder in the interests of the Cause. And yet in\r\nthe midst of my unceasing toil, my afflictions and perplexities, I have\r\nfound fresh sustenance and comfort in the striking manner in which the\r\npioneers of the Cause in that promising continent are proving themselves\r\nworthy of the spiritual heritage bequeathed to them by their departed\r\nMaster. Refreshed and fortified by their inspiring example, I feel I can\r\npursue the thorny path of my arduous duties with serene confidence,\r\ncheerful contentment and undiminished gratitude.\r\n\r\nI rejoice to learn of the marvelous effect which your resourcefulness,\r\nefficiency and unrelenting efforts are producing upon your admiring\r\nbrethren of the East. I am fully alive to the eminent share you are\r\ncontributing to the emancipation of those heroic sufferers in distracted\r\nPersia. I am deeply conscious of the part you play in consolidating the\r\nposition of the Cause in the eyes of both the exalted and lowly, and in\r\nhastening the advent of that promised day of universal recognition and\r\ntriumph for our beloved Cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShrine of Baghdad\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can but dimly discern the signs of that day of priceless victory--the\r\nday when the mission of this sublime and holy Faith will have been\r\nunfolded in all its power and glory to the eyes of an unbelieving world.\r\nWe have only to refer to the utterances of Baha'u'llah in order to realize\r\nfor ourselves God's invincible power to turn every fleeting abasement,\r\nevery transient sorrow, into abiding joy and glory. For amid the gloom of\r\nhumiliation that has now beset Baha'u'llah's holy habitation in Ba_gh_dad,\r\nthese prophetic words of His regarding His house shine forth resplendent\r\nin their assurance of a future victory: \"In truth, I declare, it shall be\r\nso abased in the days to come as to cause tears to flow from every\r\ndiscerning eye.... And in the fulness of time, shall the Lord by the power\r\nof truth exalt it in the eyes of all the world, cause it to become the\r\nmighty standard of His domination, the shrine round which shall circle the\r\nconcourse of the faithful.\" How startling in His prediction, how\r\nreassuring His promise!\r\n\r\nThe thoroughness of your methods in handling this grave and highly\r\ndelicate situation, the promptness of your response, the spirit of\r\nunabated confidence, of unrelaxing determination and admirable courage\r\nwhich you have abundantly displayed have, I am certain, endeared you to us\r\nall, justified our hopes in you, and ennobled the already lofty position\r\nyou deservedly occupy among the staunch supporters of God's immortal\r\nCause. Whatever the outcome of your memorable endeavors, the immediate\r\nconsequences of your strenuous efforts cannot but be a growing realization\r\non the part of those placed in authority that the Cause of Baha'u'llah,\r\ndespite the calumny and slander showered upon it in the past, has linked\r\nthe East with the West as no other human agency can possibly link and is\r\ncapable of demonstrating the reality of that celestial potency which no\r\nman can today safely belittle or ignore.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the spontaneous and generous response of the American\r\nbelievers in connection with the land situation on Mount Carmel has, in\r\nconjunction with the donations of the friends in other parts of the world,\r\nsafeguarded such lands as lie in close proximity to the holy Shrines. This\r\nhighly meritorious effort, blest and sanctified by the bountiful grace of\r\nBaha'u'llah, has in like manner served to reveal to every discerning eye\r\nthe friends' unquenchable enthusiasm and unrivalled devotion--the dominant\r\ncharacteristic of a Faith that is still in its stage of tender growth, and\r\nnow standing on the threshold of undreamt-of achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudgment of Egyptian Religious Court\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the disturbing factors that have intensified the difficulties of the\r\npresent situation is the extraordinary judgment recently passed by the\r\nSupreme Religious Court of Egypt, declaring the Baha'is of that land\r\nadherents of a Faith heretical in character, and at variance with the\r\naccepted doctrines of Islam, and hence utterly outside the sphere of its\r\njurisdiction. What exactly the implication of this verdict will be, the\r\neffect its practical application will have on the relations of the Baha'is\r\nwith the followers of the Muslim Faith, what measure of publicity it will\r\nreceive, what impression it will create in Muslim lands and particularly\r\nin hostile Persia, the future only can disclose. So far it has failed to\r\nperturb public sentiment or give rise to any official or public\r\ndemonstration of a nature that would justify or necessitate any action on\r\nthe part of the American Baha'is, who are powerfully demonstrating today\r\ntheir readiness to champion the cause of truth and justice. I will not\r\ndelay in informing you of the exact measures that I feel will be necessary\r\nto take should the occasion arise in future. It is clear and evident that\r\nWestern influence, the loosening of the bonds of religion, and the\r\nconsequent waning vitality of the once powerful Muhammadan stronghold of\r\nEgypt are in a great measure to account for the indifference and apathy\r\nthat now seem to characterize the attitude of the masses towards this\r\nimportant and vital issue. This decision, however locally embarrassing, in\r\nthe present stage of our development, may be regarded as an initial step\r\ntaken by our very opponents in the path of the eventual universal\r\nacceptance of the Baha'i Faith, as one of the independent recognized\r\nreligious systems of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Fund\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the institution of the National Fund and the budgetary\r\nsystem set forth in the minutes of the National Spiritual Assembly, I feel\r\nurged to remind you of the necessity of ever bearing in mind the cardinal\r\nprinciple that all contributions to the Fund are to be purely and strictly\r\nvoluntary in character. It should be made clear and evident to every one\r\nthat any form of compulsion, however slight and indirect, strikes at the\r\nvery root of the principle underlying the formation of the Fund ever since\r\nits inception. While appeals of a general character, carefully worded and\r\nmoving and dignified in tone are welcome under all circumstances, it\r\nshould be left entirely to the discretion of every conscientious believer\r\nto decide upon the nature, the amount, and purpose of his or her\r\ncontribution for the propagation of the Cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation with Orientals\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding association with Oriental travelers and residents in the United\r\nStates and Canada, I desire to emphasize afresh the vital necessity for\r\nthe exercise in these days of the greatest vigilance and reserve, prudence\r\nand caution, on the part of the American believers in their dealings with\r\nthem, either in an official or private capacity, whether in business\r\ntransactions or for purely religious purposes. As the Movement grows in\r\nprestige, fame and influence, as the ambitions, malice and ill-will of\r\nstrangers and enemies correspondingly wax greater, it becomes increasingly\r\nimportant for every individual and Spiritual Assembly to be on their guard\r\nlest they fall innocent victims of the evil designs of the malevolent, the\r\nself-seeking and greedy.\r\n\r\nTouching the publication of articles and pamphlets bearing on the\r\ncontroversial and political issues of the day, I desire to remind my\r\ndearly-beloved fellow-workers that at the present stage when the Cause is\r\nstill in its infancy, any minute and detailed analysis by the friends of\r\nsubjects that are in the forefront of general discussion would often be\r\nmisconstrued in certain quarters and give rise to suspicions and\r\nmisunderstandings that would react unfavorably on the Cause. They would\r\ntend to create a misconception of the real object, the true mission, and\r\nthe fundamental character of the Baha'i Faith. We should, while\r\nendeavoring to uphold loyally and expound conscientiously our social and\r\nmoral principles in all their essence and purity, in all their bearings\r\nupon the divers phases of human society, insure that no direct reference\r\nor particular criticism in our exposition of the fundamentals of the Faith\r\nwould tend to antagonize any existing institution, or help to identify a\r\npurely spiritual movement with the base clamorings and contentions of\r\nwarring sects, factions and nations. We should strive in all our\r\nutterances to combine the discretion and noble reticence of the wise with\r\nthe frankness and passionate loyalty of the ardent advocate of an\r\ninspiring Faith. While refusing to utter the word that would needlessly\r\nalienate or estrange any individual, government or people, we should\r\nfearlessly and unhesitatingly uphold and assert in their entirety such\r\ntruths the knowledge of which we believe is vitally and urgently needed\r\nfor the good and betterment of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe copy of the minutes of the 1925 Baha'i Convention has been received\r\nand, despite the pressure of work, read with deep pleasure and keen\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurpose of Baha'i Administration\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the administrative work of the Cause steadily expands, as its various\r\nbranches grow in importance and number, it is absolutely necessary that we\r\nbear in mind this fundamental fact that all these administrative\r\nactivities, however harmoniously and efficiently conducted, are but means\r\nto an end, and should be regarded as direct instruments for the\r\npropagation of the Baha'i Faith. Let us take heed lest in our great\r\nconcern for the perfection of the administrative machinery of the Cause,\r\nwe lose sight of the Divine Purpose for which it has been created. Let us\r\nbe on our guard lest the growing demand for specialization in the\r\nadministrative functions of the Cause detain us from joining the ranks of\r\nthose who in the forefront of battle are gloriously engaged in summoning\r\nthe multitude to this New Day of God. This indeed should be our primary\r\nconcern; this is our sacred obligation, our vital and urgent need. Let\r\nthis cardinal principle be ever borne in mind, for it is the mainspring of\r\nall future activities, the remover of every embarrassing obstacle, the\r\nfulfillment of our Master's dearest wish.\r\n\r\nMay the year that has just dawned upon us witness in such a glorious field\r\nmany a signal victory.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nJanuary 10, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of April 22nd, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful through the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nFellow-laborers in the Divine Vineyard:\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the many vicissitudes which the creative Word of God is\r\ndestined to encounter in the course of its onward march towards the\r\nredemption of the world, there breaks upon us the news of still another\r\nloss, more bewildering in its character, yet more inspiring in its\r\nchallenge, than any of the gravest happenings of recent times. Once again\r\nthe woeful tale of unabated persecution, involving this time the martyrdom\r\nof twelve of our long-suffering brethren in Jahrum, southern Persia, has\r\nreached our ears, and filled us with a gloom which all the joys and\r\nennobling memories of Ridvan have failed to dispel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'i Martyrdoms in Persia\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the meagre reports which have thus far been received from that\r\ndistracted country it appears that this shameful and atrocious act, though\r\nthe outcome of a number of obscure and complex causes, has been chiefly\r\ninstigated by that ever-present factor of fierce and relentless impulse of\r\nreligious hostility. Persia--long neglected and sorely tried--continues,\r\ndespite the revival of recent hopes, to be the down-trodden victim of\r\nunscrupulous personal rivalries and factious intrigue, of tribal revolt,\r\npolitical dissensions and religious animosities--all of which have in times\r\npast brought in their wake the shedding of the blood of so many of its\r\ninnocent and choicest sons.\r\n\r\nFully alive to the gravity of the occasion, and realizing the urgency of\r\nmy sacred duty, I have, upon the receipt of the news, transmitted\r\ntelegraphically through the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of\r\nPersia a special message addressed in the name of the Baha'is of every\r\nland to the supreme authority in the State, expressing our profound horror\r\nat this outrageous act as well as our earnest entreaty to inflict\r\nimmediate punishment on the perpetrators of so abominable a crime. And as\r\nthis sad event involved chiefly the welfare and security of the Baha'i\r\nresidents in Persia, I have specially requested all local Assemblies in\r\nthat land to address a similar message to the highest authorities\r\nconcerned appealing for full protection and justice. Should future\r\ndevelopments necessitate direct and foreign intervention, I shall acquaint\r\nthe national Baha'i representatives in every land to take in cooperation\r\nwith all local Assemblies such measures as will effectually conduce to a\r\nfuller recognition of the dynamic force latent in the Baha'i Faith and\r\ninsure the betterment of the lot of the heroic supporters of our Cause.\r\n\r\nPending the opening of official communication with recognized authorities\r\nwhether in Persia or elsewhere, I strongly feel that the time has\r\nassuredly come when it is incumbent upon every conscientious promoter of\r\nthe Cause to bestir himself and undertake in consultation with the friends\r\nin his locality such measures of publicity as will lead to the gradual\r\nawakening of the conscience of the civilized world to what is admittedly\r\nan ignominious manifestation of a decadent age.\r\n\r\nI would specially request all National Assemblies to give their anxious\r\nand immediate consideration to this grave matter, and to devise ways and\r\nmeans that will secure the fullest publicity for our grievances. I would\r\nremind them that whatever is published should be couched in terms that are\r\nat once correct, forceful and inoffensive.\r\n\r\nI would particularly stress the importance of making every effort to\r\nsecure the sympathy and hospitality of the leading journals and\r\nperiodicals of the Western world, and of sending to the Holy Land any such\r\nreferences in papers that will arise to champion the cause of\r\nrighteousness and justice. I greatly deplore the fact that owing to the\r\nremoteness and the unstable conditions in Persia, details and particulars\r\nregarding this ugly incident are not as yet available, but will be duly\r\ncommunicated to the various centers immediately upon their receipt. I\r\nwould, however, ask the believers throughout the West to arise without any\r\nfurther delay and supplement the publication of the news conveyed in this\r\nmessage with an account of previous happenings of a similar character,\r\ncombined with an adequate survey of the aim, the principles and history of\r\nthe Baha'i Cause.\r\n\r\nIt is to you, dearly beloved friends of the West, who are the\r\nstandard-bearers of the emancipation and triumph of the Baha'i Faith, that\r\nour afflicted brethren of the East have turned their expectant eyes,\r\nconfident that the day cannot be far-distant when, in accordance with\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's explicit utterance, the West will \"seize the Cause\" from\r\nPersia's fettered hands and lead it to glorious victory.\r\n\r\nThough grief-stricken and horrified at this cruel blow, let us be on our\r\nguard lest we give way to despair, lest we forget that in the Almighty's\r\ninscrutable wisdom this sudden calamity may prove to be but a blessing in\r\ndisguise. For what else can it do but to stir the inmost depths of our\r\nsouls, set our faith ablaze, galvanize our efforts, dissolve our\r\ndifferences, and provide one of the chief instruments which the unhampered\r\npromoters of the Faith can utilize to attract the attention, enlist the\r\nsympathy, and eventually win the allegiance of all mankind?\r\n\r\nOurs is this supreme opportunity; may we fulfill our trust.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nApril 22nd, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of May 11th, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nFellow-laborers in the Vineyard of God:\r\n\r\nVarious happenings of recent months, highly disquieting in their\r\nsuddenness, their complexity and consequences, have time and again, to my\r\nregret, compelled me to defer correspondence with you, my highly valued\r\nco-workers, who are destined to share no small a part of the burden that\r\nnow weighs so heavily upon me. The prolonged and delicate negotiations\r\narising out of the critical situation of Baha'u'llah's house in Ba_gh_dad;\r\nthe shameful recrudescence of unrestrained barbarism in stricken Persia;\r\nthe unexpected reverse recently sustained in our legal transactions for\r\nthe deliverance of Baha'u'llah's mansion at Bahji from the hands of the\r\nenemy; the unprecedented increase in the volume of work resulting from the\r\nrise and expansion of the Movement in various parts of the world--these and\r\nother issues, no less pressing in their demand upon my time and energy,\r\nhave gradually affected my health and impaired the efficiency required in\r\nthe discharge of my arduous duties. But, though body and mind be sorely\r\nstrained by cares and perplexities which a Movement such as ours just\r\nemerging from obscurity must needs encounter, yet the spirit continues to\r\ndraw fresh inspiration from the manner in which the chosen deliverers of\r\nthe Faith in the Western world, and particularly in the American\r\ncontinent, are proving themselves increasingly worthy of such a stupendous\r\nyet so noble a task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersecutions in Jahrum\r\n\r\n\r\nGrave and manifold as are the problems confronting the struggling Faith of\r\nBaha'u'llah, none appear more significant, nor seem more compelling in\r\ntheir urgency, than the incredible sufferings borne so heroically by our\r\ndown-trodden brethren of the East. Recent reports confirming the news\r\nwhich I have lately communicated to you have all emphasized the barbarous\r\nseverity practiced on the innocent followers of our Cause. They reveal the\r\npossibility of the extension of this agitation, partly instigated for\r\npolitical purposes and selfish motives, to neighboring towns and\r\nprovinces, and dwell upon the traditional slackness of the local\r\nauthorities to inflict prompt and severe punishment upon all the\r\nperpetrators of such abominable crimes. It has been ascertained that in\r\nthe town of Jahrum women have suffered martyrdom in a most atrocious\r\nmanner, that the knife of the criminal has mercilessly cut to pieces the\r\nbody of a child, that a number have been severely beaten and injured,\r\ntheir bodies mutilated, their homes pillaged, their property confiscated,\r\nand the homeless remnants of their family abandoned to the mercy of a\r\nshameless and tyrannical people. In other parts of Persia, and\r\nparticularly in the province of A_dh_irbayjan in the town of Mara_gh_ih,\r\nthe friends have been pitilessly denied the civic rights and privileges\r\nextended to every citizen of the land. They have been refused the use of\r\nthe public bath, and been denied access to such shops as provide the\r\nnecessities of life. They have been declared deprived of the benefit and\r\nprotection of the law, and all association and dealing with them denounced\r\nas a direct violation of the precepts and principles of Islam. It has even\r\nbeen authoritatively stated that the decencies of public interment have\r\nbeen refused to their dead, and that in a particular case every effort to\r\ninduce the Muslim undertaker to provide the wood for the construction of\r\nthe coffin, failed to secure the official support of the authorities\r\nconcerned. Every appeal made by these Baha'is on behalf of their brethren,\r\nwhether living or dead, has been met with cold indifference, with vague\r\npromises, and, not infrequently, with severe rebuke and undeserved\r\nchastisement.\r\n\r\nThe tale of such outrageous conduct, such widespread suffering and loss,\r\nif properly expressed and broadcast, cannot fail in the end to arouse the\r\nconscience of civilized mankind, and thereby secure the much-needed relief\r\nfor a long-suffering people. I would, therefore, renew my plea, and\r\nrequest you most earnestly to redouble your efforts in the wide field of\r\npublicity, to devise every possible means that will alleviate the fears\r\nand sorrows of the silent sufferers in that distracted country. Surely\r\nthese vile wrong-doers cannot long remain unpunished for their ferocious\r\natrocities, and the day may not be far distant when we shall witness, as\r\nwe have observed elsewhere, the promised signs of Divine Retribution\r\navenging the blood of the slaughtered servants of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan of Unified Action\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Plan of Unified Action, enclosed in your letter of\r\nJanuary 19th, I feel that the friends must be constantly reminded of the\r\nvital necessity for a continuous and whole-hearted support of the scheme,\r\nthe success or failure of which will to a marked extent affect the course\r\nof the progress of the Cause not only in Northern America but throughout\r\nthe Baha'i world. Let the friends recall and ever bear in mind the\r\nrepeated exhortations and glowing promises of our beloved Master with\r\nreference to the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the crowning institution in every\r\nBaha'i community. Let them arise with determination and confidence to lend\r\na helping hand to the Plan which you have so admirably devised for its\r\nspeedy and practical realization. Theirs is a splendid opportunity; let\r\ntheir response to your call be prompt, whole-hearted and decisive.\r\n\r\nI have specially requested that indefatigable pioneer of the Cause of God,\r\nour well-beloved Baha'i sister, Mrs. Victoria Bedekian, to concentrate for\r\nthe present all the resources of her mind and heart upon this vast and\r\nvital undertaking. I have urged her to direct her energies to this lofty\r\npurpose, and by the aid of her most valuable letters arouse both the East\r\nand the West to a fresh consciousness of the significance and urgency of\r\nthe object you have set yourselves to achieve.\r\n\r\nRegarding the series of World Unity meetings which some of the thoughtful,\r\ncapable and devoted servants of the Cause have carefully organized and\r\nsuccessfully conducted, and to which you have referred in your letter of\r\nMarch 8th, I wish to express my keen appreciation of such a splendid\r\nconception, my deep gratitude for the efforts they have exerted, and my\r\ngratification in view of the success they have achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuiding Principles of Baha'i Administration\r\n\r\n\r\nThe administrative machinery of the Cause having now sufficiently evolved,\r\nits aim and object fairly well grasped and understood, and its method and\r\nworking made more familiar to every believer, I feel the time is ripe when\r\nit should be fully and consciously utilized to further the purpose for\r\nwhich it has been created. It should, I strongly feel, be made to serve a\r\ntwofold purpose. On one hand, it should aim at a steady and gradual\r\nexpansion of the Movement along lines that are at once broad, sound and\r\nuniversal; and on the other it should insure the internal consolidation of\r\nthe work already achieved. It should both provide the impulse whereby the\r\ndynamic forces latent in the Faith can unfold, crystallize, and shape the\r\nlives and conduct of men, and serve as a medium for the interchange of\r\nthought and the coordination of activities among the divers elements that\r\nconstitute the Baha'i community.\r\n\r\nWhether it be by an open and bold assertion of the fundamental verities of\r\nthe Cause, or the adoption of a less direct and more cautious method of\r\nteaching; whether by the dissemination of our literature or the example of\r\nour conduct, our one aim and sole object should be to help in the eventual\r\nrecognition by all mankind of the indispensability, the uniqueness and the\r\nsupreme station of the Baha'i Revelation. Whatever method he adopts, and\r\nhowever indirect the course he chooses to pursue, every true believer\r\nshould regard such a recognition as the supreme goal of his endeavor.\r\nWhilst consciously laboring towards the attainment of this end, he should,\r\nby supporting every branch of the administrative activities of his\r\nnational and local assembly, seek and obtain the fullest information on\r\nthe character and extent of the worldwide progress of the Cause, and\r\nstrive to contribute his share towards the strengthening of the spirit of\r\nsolidarity among the component parts of the Baha'i world.\r\n\r\nSuch in their broad outline are the guiding principles which those who\r\nhave been placed in charge of the administration of the affairs of the\r\nCause should at present endeavor to promote, explain and securely\r\nestablish. Nothing short of the spirit of unwavering faith, of continuous\r\nvigilance and patient endeavor can hope to secure eventually the\r\nrealization of this our cherished desire.\r\n\r\nMay America's national representatives arise with clear vision, with\r\nunswerving determination and renewed vigor to carry out in its entirety\r\nthe sacred task they have purposed to perform.\r\n\r\nAssuring you of my continued and earnest prayers for the success of your\r\nefforts,\r\n\r\nI am your true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nMay 11th, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of October 7th, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:\r\n\r\nIn the course of the few months that have elapsed since my last\r\ncommunication to you regarding the appalling circumstances that have\r\nculminated in the martyrdom of our Persian brethren in Jahrum, events of\r\nthe highest importance to the future welfare of our beloved Cause have\r\ntranspired, and with startling suddenness conferred abiding solace upon\r\nthose who still have to face the pains and terrors of unmitigated and\r\nshameless tyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse of Queen Marie\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have, most of you, I presume, read with thrilling joy in one of the\r\nrecent issues of the Star of the West that illuminating account given by\r\nour beloved sister, Miss Martha Root, wherein she tells with her\r\ncharacteristic directness and modesty the story of her moving interview\r\nwith Her Majesty Queen Marie of Roumania and of the cordial and ready\r\nresponse which her gentle yet persuasive presentation of the principles of\r\nthe Baha'i Faith has evoked in the heart of that honored queen. One of the\r\nvisible and potent effects which this historic interview proved capable of\r\nachieving was the remarkable appeal in the form of an open letter which\r\nHer Majesty freely and spontaneously caused to be published to the world\r\nat large testifying in a language of exquisite beauty to the power and\r\nsublimity of the Message of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a never-to-be-forgotten occasion when, on the eve of the day\r\ncommemorating the passing of Baha'u'llah, a handful of us, His sorrowing\r\nservants, had gathered round His beloved Shrine supplicating relief and\r\ndeliverance for the down-trodden in Persia, to receive in the midst of the\r\nsilence of that distressing hour the glad-tidings of this notable triumph\r\nwhich the unbending energy and indomitable spirit of our beloved Martha\r\nhas achieved for our sacred Cause.\r\n\r\nWith bowed heads and grateful hearts we recognize in this glowing tribute\r\nwhich royalty has thus paid to the Cause of Baha'u'llah an epoch-making\r\npronouncement destined to herald those stirring events which, as\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha has prophesied, shall in the fulness of time signalize the\r\ntriumph of God's holy Faith. For who can doubt but that the deeds of those\r\nvaliant pioneers of the Faith, unexampled though they have been in the\r\nabundance of their number and unexcelled in their sublime heroism, are but\r\na faint glimmer of what, according to the divine promise, its steadfast\r\nfollowers are destined to perform? Those heroic exploits that have\r\nimmortalized the names of its primitive adherents will continue to adorn\r\nand illuminate the pages of its blood-stained history; yet we cannot\r\nforget that the period of its full fruition with all its promise of world\r\nfelicity and undreamt-of achievements is yet to be realized, its golden\r\nage yet to unfold. Indeed, how chastening to our pride, how challenging to\r\nour enthusiasm, if we but pause for a moment amidst the world's many\r\ndistractions and ponder in our hearts the vastness, the compelling\r\nurgency, the ineffable glory of what still remains unachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Regenerating Power\r\n\r\n\r\nBut let us all remember, in this connection, that prior to every\r\nconceivable measure destined to raise the efficiency of our administrative\r\nactivities, more vital than any scheme which the most resourceful amongst\r\nus can devise, far above the most elaborate structure which the concerted\r\nefforts of organized Assemblies can hope to raise, is the realization down\r\nin the innermost heart of every true believer of the regenerating power,\r\nthe supreme necessity, the unfailing efficacy of the Message he bears. I\r\nassure you, dear friends, that nothing short of such an immovable\r\nconviction could have in days past enabled our beloved Cause to weather\r\nthe blackest storms in its history. Naught else can today vitalize the\r\nmanifold activities in which unnumbered disciples of the Faith are\r\nengaged; naught else can provide that driving force and sustaining power\r\nthat are both so essential to the success of vast and enduring\r\nachievements. It is this spirit that above all else we should sedulously\r\nguard, and strive with all our might to fortify and exemplify in all our\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, I have addressed to Her Majesty in the\r\nname of the Baha'is of both the East and the West a written expression of\r\nour joyous admiration and gratitude for the queenly tribute which Her\r\nMajesty has paid to the beauty and nobility of the Baha'i Teachings. I\r\nhave, moreover, assured Her Majesty of the far-reaching effect which her\r\nsuperb testimony will inevitably produce, and of the welcome consolation\r\nit has already brought to the silent sufferers in that distracted country.\r\nTo my message of appreciation and gratitude there has come lately a\r\nwritten response, penned by Her Majesty, profoundly touching, singularly\r\noutspoken, and highly significant in the testimony it bears. From this\r\nqueenly tribute to a divine ideal I quote these penetrating words:\r\n\r\n\"Indeed a great light came to me with the Message of Baha'u'llah and\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha. It came as all great messages come at an hour of dire grief\r\nand inner conflict and distress, so the seed sank deeply.... We pass on\r\nthe Message from mouth to mouth and all those we give it to see a light\r\nsuddenly lighting before them and much that was obscure and perplexing\r\nbecomes simple, luminous and full of hope as never before. That my open\r\nletter was balm to those suffering for the Cause is indeed a great\r\nhappiness to me, and I take it as a sign that God accepted my humble\r\ntribute.... With bowed head I recognize that I too am but an instrument in\r\ngreater Hands and rejoice in the knowledge....\"\r\n\r\nDear friends, with feelings of profound emotion we recall the glowing\r\npromises that have so often fallen from the lips of our departed Master,\r\nand with throbbing hearts rejoice in the gradual realization of His most\r\ncherished desire.\r\n\r\nAnd as we call to mind the circumstances that have led to such a notable\r\nadvance, we are filled with admiration for that unique and great-hearted\r\napostle of Baha'u'llah, our dearly-beloved Martha Root, who under trying\r\ncircumstances and almost single-handed in her efforts, has so wonderfully\r\npaved the way for the universal recognition of the Cause of God. In her\r\ncase we have verily witnessed in an unmistakable manner what the power of\r\ndauntless faith, when coupled with sublimity of character, can achieve,\r\nwhat forces it can release, to what heights it can rise.\r\n\r\nLet such remarkable revelations of the reality and continuity of the\r\ndivine purpose, made manifest from time to time to us His feeble children,\r\nserve to fortify our faith in Him, to warm the chill which fleeting\r\nmisfortunes may leave behind, and fill us with that celestial potency\r\nwhich alone can enable us to withstand the storm and stress that lives\r\ndedicated to His service must needs encounter.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nOctober 7th, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of October 29, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nDear fellow-workers in the Divine Vineyard:\r\n\r\nIt will gladden and rejoice every one of you to learn that from various\r\nquarters there has of late reached the Holy Land tidings of fresh\r\ndevelopments that are a clear indication of those hidden and transforming\r\ninfluences which, from the source of Baha'u'llah's mystic strength,\r\ncontinue to flow with ever-increasing vitality into the heart of this\r\ntroubled world.\r\n\r\nBoth in the wider field of its spiritual conquests, where its indomitable\r\nspirit is forging ahead, capturing the heights, pervading the multitude;\r\nas well as in the gradual consolidation of the administrative structure\r\nwhich its avowed followers the world over are laboring to raise and\r\nfortify, the Faith of Baha'u'llah, we can increasingly discern, bids fair\r\nto become that force which, though not as yet universally recognized, none\r\ncan afford to belittle or ignore.\r\n\r\nIn the bold and repeated testimonies which Her Majesty, Queen Marie of\r\nRoumania, has chosen to give to the world,--a copy of whose latest\r\npronouncement I enclose,(13)--we truly recognize evidences of the\r\nirresistible power, the increasing vitality, the strange working of a\r\nFaith destined to regenerate the world. Her Majesty's striking tribute\r\npaid to the illuminative power of the Teachings of Baha'u'llah and\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha is bound to effect an entire transformation in the attitude\r\nof many to a Faith the tenets of which have often been misunderstood and\r\nsorely neglected. It will serve as a fresh stimulus to the enlightened and\r\ncultured to investigate with an open mind the verities of its message, the\r\nsource of its life-giving principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShrine at Baghdad\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Ba_gh_dad, moreover, where the sacred habitation of Baha'u'llah has\r\nbeen violated by a relentless enemy and converted into a rallying center\r\nfor the corrupt, the perverse, and the fanatical, there comes the news,\r\nhighly reassuring to us all, of the satisfactory progress of the\r\nnegotiations which, we are informed on high authority, will soon lead to\r\nthe expropriation of the property by the State, culminating in the\r\nfullness of time in its occupation by the triumphant followers of God's\r\nholy Faith. The case of the houses, so ably presented, so persistently\r\npursued, above all reinforced by the vigilant and protecting power of our\r\ndeparted Master, will eventually triumph, and by its repercussions in\r\nPersia as in the world at large, will lend a powerful impetus to the\r\nliberation of those forces which will carry the Cause to its ultimate\r\ndestiny. I will, when the occasion presents itself, inform the believers\r\nthrough their respective National Spiritual Assemblies to address messages\r\nof appreciation and gratitude to the authorities concerned in view of\r\ntheir unrelaxing efforts for the triumph of right and justice.\r\n\r\nFor the present, we cannot but rejoice and feel profoundly thankful as we\r\nwitness in so many directions the welcome signs of the gradual\r\nemancipation of the struggling Faith of Baha'u'llah, of the increasing\r\nrecognition on the part of both the high and lowly of its universal\r\nprinciples--all so rich in their promise of ultimate victory.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nOctober 29, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of October 31, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nI have on two recent occasions given expression to the profound sense of\r\ninspiring confidence and joyous gratitude which recent happenings in the\r\nCause--evident manifestations of the steady evolution of a living\r\nFaith--must needs evoke in the heart of every thoughtful and observing\r\nbeliever. And as I contemplate the far-reaching possibilities involved in\r\na careful handling of those forces which Baha'u'llah's almighty arm has\r\nnow released, I cannot help reflecting upon the dominant share which the\r\nAmerican friends, at home as well as in distant lands, have contributed to\r\nthis rejuvenation of the Cause of God, and the decisive part it is theirs\r\nto play in its eventual victory.\r\n\r\nYour letters, dated June 17, July 11, July 20, August 3 and 16, and\r\nOctober 2, 1926, all of which have been forwarded during my days of\r\nretirement and rest, have proved an added source of thankfulness, of joy\r\nand strength to me. They have clearly revealed by their spirit, as well as\r\nby the nature and variety of their contents, the sustained devotion, the\r\nunabated confidence, and the increasing vigor and efficiency with which\r\nyou are initiating, coordinating, and consolidating the manifold\r\nactivities of the Cause in North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Secretariat\r\n\r\n\r\nThe range and character of the problems confronting you, as revealed by\r\nthe careful perusal of the minutes of your meetings, the steady increase\r\nin the number and effectiveness of vigorously functioning Centers in\r\nCentral and Northern Europe, and the growing significance and complexity\r\nof the work that has to be necessarily conducted from the Holy Land, have\r\nall served to strengthen the feeling of absolute necessity for the\r\nformation in Haifa of some sort of an International Baha'i Secretariat,\r\nwhich both in an advisory and executive capacity will have to aid and\r\nassist me in my vast and exacting labors. I have anxiously considered this\r\nimportant matter in all its bearings during the past few months, and have\r\naccordingly requested three well-informed, capable representatives from\r\nAmerica, Europe and the East to visit the Holy Land this fall, that we may\r\nlay down the foundation of this vitally needed institution. We shall take\r\ncounsel together and decide, not only upon the measures that have to be\r\npromptly undertaken to meet the pressing demands of the present hour, but\r\nupon the wider issues that on one hand will strengthen the ties that\r\nshould bind the International Center of the Cause with the world at large,\r\nand on the other provide for the preliminary steps that will eventually\r\nlead to the proper establishment of the First International House of\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\nIt is my earnest hope and prayer that this exchange of thought and close\r\ncooperation in the work that has henceforth to be internationally and\r\nvigorously conducted, will enable me to participate more minutely and\r\neffectively in the labors of the various administrative departments of\r\nyour Assembly, and thus reinforce the splendid efforts you are exerting\r\nfor the extension of its influence and the widening of its scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan of Unified Action\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the National Treasurer, setting forth the account of\r\nthe progress of the contributions of the American believers for the\r\nsupport of the Plan of Unified Action, up to June 30, 1926, I gather that\r\nthe result has by no means exceeded our expectations, nay has considerably\r\nfallen below what I confidently expected it to achieve. I earnestly renew\r\nmy plea and appeal to you, and through you to every true and faithful\r\nlover of 'Abdu'l-Baha, to realize, while there is yet time, the\r\nfar-reaching possibilities with which the present situation is fraught. I\r\nam firmly convinced that this Plan combines, embodies, and serves the\r\ntwofold purpose of the present-day Baha'i administration in the United\r\nStates and Canada, namely the promotion of the vitally needed teaching\r\nwork, and the provision for the gradual completion of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, both wishes so near and dear to our beloved\r\nMaster's heart. It is the only effective, feasible, and practical\r\ninstrument placed in our hands for the speedy accomplishment of our ends.\r\nSo much that is vital to the future welfare, the effectiveness, and the\r\nfair name of our beloved Cause depends, I assure you, upon the success or\r\nfailure of this nobly-conceived, this sound and befitting enterprise. The\r\neyes of all Baha'is and of many sympathizers throughout the world are\r\nturned towards you, eager to reinforce your accomplishments in this field,\r\nexpectant to witness what measure of success you are capable of achieving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld Unity Conferences\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the series of World Unity Conferences which you have\r\ninitiated and so laboriously organized, I feel that in order to reap the\r\nfullest advantage and benefit from this laudable effort, it is absolutely\r\nessential to follow up with the aid of enlightened, experienced and\r\ncapable teachers the interest which has been aroused. Such a group of\r\nteachers should judiciously select those few among the many interested,\r\nand endeavor with patience and sympathy and by constant intimate personal\r\nintercourse, to prepare them gradually for the entire and unreserved\r\nacceptance of the fundamentals of the Baha'i Revelation. If the results be\r\nmeagre, if the attendance be small, let us not despair, nor relax in our\r\nefforts. Let us remember that this sound method will eventually triumph,\r\nif we only consistently support it, and persevere in undertaking those\r\nsubsequent steps that can alone produce full and permanent benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal to the Shah of Persia\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already expressed my grateful appreciation of the prompt and wise\r\nmeasures you have taken in behalf of our oppressed and down-trodden\r\nbrethren in Persia. The noble appeal which you were moved to address to\r\nHis Majesty the _Sh_ah, so illuminating, so courteous, so powerful, and\r\nthe wide range of publicity you have undertaken, were truly providential\r\nin character, and will undoubtedly prove an inspiration and solace to\r\nthose who still continue to be trampled under the heel of an odious and\r\ninveterate enemy. I have had your appeal translated into Persian and sent\r\nto all Centers throughout the Orient that the suffering in Persia may\r\nlearn of your bold and courageous intervention, and witness the signs of\r\ntheir promised redemption which, as foretold by 'Abdu'l-Baha, must first\r\nbe made manifest through the efforts of their brethren in that great\r\nfreedom-loving Republic of the West.\r\n\r\nIt is sad and distressing to reflect that, notwithstanding the repeated\r\nappeals addressed to the authorities concerned, and so powerfully\r\nreinforced by the spontaneous action of some of the leading Governments of\r\nthe West, Persia, still heedless and unaware of the spiritual forces that\r\nare at work, continues to treat with indifference and contempt the most\r\nloyal, innocent and law-abiding subjects of its realm. The chronic\r\ninstability of its affairs, the changing fortunes of factions and shadowy\r\npersonalities that sap its vitality and tarnish its name, the acute and\r\nwidespread economic depression that is now prevailing, and the grave\r\ndiscontent of the masses of the people, all tend to aggravate a situation\r\nalready highly threatening to the security of its sorely tried children.\r\nWhat else can we do but pray most fervently that the almighty power of\r\nBaha'u'llah may soon triumph over this petty strife, this age-long\r\ntyranny, and make, as He prophesied, of the land of His birth, \"the most\r\nhonored of all governments, the pride, the admiration and the envy of the\r\npeoples of the world.\"\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nOctober 31, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of November 14, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved friends:\r\n\r\nThe progress of various events, both within and outside the Baha'i world,\r\nas well as the perusal of the able and illuminating report recently\r\nsubmitted by the Committee of the Persian National Spiritual Assembly in\r\ncharge of the Tarbiyat School in Tihran, have served to reinforce a\r\ngradually growing idea as to the desirability of arranging for the\r\nsettlement in the capital of that country of one or two American believers\r\nwho, having the means, the freedom and the capacity, can adequately meet\r\nthe pressing requirements of a responsible position. Judging from their\r\nreport, the situation in Tihran though much confused and perplexing, is\r\nfraught with rich possibilities for the future of the Cause, both as\r\naffecting the national fortunes of Persia, as well as its influence upon\r\nthe international development of the Cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Teachers in Tihran\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation as I see it calls for the devoted efforts of one or two\r\ncapable workers who, untrammelled and with independent means, can quietly,\r\ntenaciously and tactfully, pursue over a considerable length of time the\r\nmeritorious work of fostering the cause of Baha'i education, for both boys\r\nand girls, in the swiftly changing capital of a promising country. It\r\nshould be their primary duty to extend the scope and enhance the prestige\r\nof these twin Baha'i educational institutions, and to initiate by sound\r\nand well-considered methods such measures as will consolidate the work\r\nalready achieved. It would be highly gratifying if they could also\r\nendeavor, by keeping in close and constant touch with the Persian and\r\nAmerican National Spiritual Assemblies, to fortify those vital bonds that\r\nspiritually unite the cradle of the Baha'i Faith with the great American\r\nRepublic--the foremost standard-bearer of the Cause in the Western field.\r\nSuch efforts will extremely facilitate cooperation between these two\r\ncountries, whose common destiny is to provide, each in its own typical\r\nmanner, the essential elements in the foundation of the world order\r\nushered in by Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nThe gradual expansion of foreign as well as officially subsidized\r\neducational schools in Tihran, the prolonged absence of competent teachers\r\nand organizers that can revive the declining influence of a hitherto\r\nrenowned Baha'i educational institution, and the critical and vigilant\r\nattitude which the growing influence of the Cause has induced in its\r\nmalignant and envious enemies, are today subjects of gravest concern to\r\nthe elected representatives of our suffering brethren and sisters in\r\nPersia. I would therefore request those who feel the urge and have the\r\nmeans to undertake this task to communicate with the National Spiritual\r\nAssembly who, after mature deliberation, will select one or two who, in\r\ntheir judgment, can best render this service, and decide upon the exact\r\ntime and manner which would be most suitable for its execution. I would\r\nstrongly urge the friends to consult most earnestly with that devoted,\r\nexperienced and indefatigable handmaid of Baha'u'llah, Dr. Moody, whose\r\npast services have ennobled the record of collaboration of East and West\r\nfor the furtherance of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. It would be highly\r\nsatisfactory and immensely helpful if our beloved sister could find it\r\npossible and convenient to accompany such a carefully-chosen person on the\r\nway to Tihran, and, by her unrivaled experience and loving-kindness,\r\nassist personally in the fulfillment of this pressing need.\r\n\r\nWhoever steps into this field will find, as he settles down to his work,\r\nthat the environment is extremely disheartening, that restrictions are\r\noppressive, that the amenities of social life are lacking, that the forces\r\nof opposition are determined and organized. But let him realize also that,\r\nhowever tedious and exacting his labors, however precarious and thankless\r\nhis task, the pioneer services it is his unique privilege to render in\r\nthis time of stress will forever live in the annals of God's living Faith,\r\nand will prove a source of inspiration to the countless workers who, in\r\nhappier times and with better means at their disposal, will consummate the\r\nspiritual regeneration and material rehabilitation of Baha'u'llah's native\r\nland.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nNovember 14, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of February 12, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:\r\n\r\nThe trend of various events, affecting directly and indirectly the\r\ninterests of the Baha'i Cause, have of late served to bring into further\r\nprominence the character as well as the significance of a Faith destined\r\nto regenerate the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecision of Egyptian Tribunal\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the diverse issues which today are gradually tending to consolidate\r\nand extend the bounds of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, the decision of\r\nEgypt's religious Tribunal regarding the Baha'is under its jurisdiction\r\nappears at the present moment to be the most powerful in its challenge,\r\nthe most startling in its character, and the most perplexing in the\r\nconsequences it may entail. I have already alluded in my letter of January\r\n10, 1926, addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of\r\nthe United States and Canada, to a particular feature of this momentous\r\nverdict, which after mature deliberation has obtained the sanction of\r\nEgypt's highest ecclesiastical authorities, has been communicated and\r\nprinted, and is regarded as final and binding. I have stressed in my last\r\nreference to this far-reaching pronouncement the negative aspect of this\r\ndocument which condemns in most unequivocal and emphatic language the\r\nfollowers of Baha'u'llah as the believers in heresy, offensive and\r\ninjurious to Islam, and wholly incompatible with the accepted doctrines\r\nand practice of its orthodox adherents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'i Cause Recognized as Independent Religion\r\n\r\n\r\nA closer study of the text of the decision will, however, reveal the fact\r\nthat coupled with this strong denunciation is the positive assertion of a\r\ntruth which the recognized opponents of the Baha'i Faith in other\r\nMuhammadan countries have up to the present time either sedulously ignored\r\nor maliciously endeavored to disprove. Not content with this harsh and\r\nunjustifiable repudiation of the so-called menacing and heretical\r\ndoctrines of the adherents of the Baha'i Faith, they proceed in a formal\r\nmanner to declare in the text of that very decision their belief, that the\r\nBaha'i Faith is a \"new religion,\" \"entirely independent\" and, by reason of\r\nthe magnitude of its claim and the character of its \"laws, principles and\r\nbeliefs,\" worthy to be reckoned as one of the established religious\r\nsystems of the world. Quoting various passages judiciously gleaned from a\r\nnumber of Baha'i sacred Books as an evidence to their splendid testimony,\r\nthey proceed in a notable statement to deduce the fact that henceforth it\r\nshall be regarded as impossible for the followers of such a Faith to be\r\ndesignated as Muslim, just as it would be incorrect and erroneous to call\r\na Muhammadan either Christian or Jew.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that in the course of the inevitable developments of\r\nthis present situation the resident Baha'is of Egypt, originally belonging\r\nto the Muslim Faith, will be placed in a most humiliating and embarrassing\r\nposition. They, however, cannot but rejoice in the knowledge that whereas\r\nin various Muhammadan countries and particularly in Persia the\r\noverwhelming majority of the leaders of Islam are utterly opposed to any\r\nform of declaration that would facilitate the universal recognition of the\r\nCause, the authorized heads of their co-religionists in one of the most\r\nadvanced communities in the Muhammadan world have, of their own\r\ninitiative, published to the world a document that may justly be termed as\r\nthe first chapter of liberty emancipating the Baha'i Faith from the\r\nfetters of orthodox Islam. And in order to insure the complete rupture of\r\nBaha'i official relations with Muslim Courts they lay down in unmistakable\r\nterms the condition that under no circumstances can the marriage of those\r\nBaha'is who have been required to divorce their Muslim wives be renewed by\r\nthe Muslim Court unless and until the husbands formally recant their faith\r\nby solemnly declaring that the Qur'an is the \"last\" Book of God revealed\r\nto man, that no law can abrogate the Prophet's Law, no faith can succeed\r\nHis Faith, no revelation can claim to fulfill His Revelation.\r\n\r\nWhile unwavering in their belief in the Divine station of the Author of\r\nthe Qur'an and profoundly convinced of the necessity and worldwide\r\ninfluence of His Divine mission, Baha'is in every land stand undeterred\r\nand unabashed in the face of the strong condemnation pronounced against\r\ntheir brethren in Egypt. Indeed, they together with their fellow-workers\r\nin all Muslim countries welcome with gladness and pride every opportunity\r\nfor further emancipation that they may set forth in a truer light the\r\nsublime mission of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such an outspoken and challenging declaration, the Baha'i\r\nof the West cannot but feel the deepest sympathy with their Egyptian\r\nbrethren who, for the sake of our beloved Cause and its deliverance, have\r\nto face all the embarrassments and vexations which the severance of\r\nold-established ties must necessarily entail. They will, however, most\r\ncertainly expect every staunch and loyal believer in the Faith who resides\r\nin that land to refrain in view of the grave warning uttered expressly by\r\nour opponents, from any practice that would in any manner constitute in\r\nthe eyes of a critical and vigilant enemy a repudiation of the fundamental\r\nbeliefs of the people of Baha. They will most assuredly, whenever the\r\nmoment is opportune, step forth with eager hearts to offer every support\r\nin their power to their fellow-workers who, with stout hearts and\r\nirreproachable loyalty, will continue to hold aloft the standard of God's\r\nstruggling Faith. They will not fail to come to the rescue of those who\r\nwith joyous confidence will endure to the very end such vicissitudes as\r\nthis New Day of God, now in its birth-throes, must needs suffer and\r\nsurmount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorldwide Attacks Foretold\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot believe that as the Movement grows in strength, in authority and\r\nin influence, the perplexities and the sufferings it has had to contend\r\nwith in the past will correspondingly decrease and vanish. Nay, as it\r\ngrows from strength to strength, the fanatical defendants of the\r\nstrongholds of orthodoxy, whatever be their denomination, realizing the\r\npenetrating influence of this growing Faith, will arise and strain every\r\nnerve to extinguish its light and discredit its name. For has not our\r\nbeloved 'Abdu'l-Baha sent forth His glowing prophecy from behind the\r\nprison walls of the citadel of Akka--words so significant in their forecast\r\nof the coming world turmoil, yet so rich in their promise of eventual\r\nvictory:--\r\n\r\n\"How great, how very great is the Cause; how very fierce the onslaught of\r\nall the peoples and kindreds of the earth! Erelong shall the clamor of the\r\nmultitude throughout Africa, throughout America, the cry of the European\r\nand of the Turk, the groaning of India and China be heard from far and\r\nnear. One and all they shall arise with all their power to resist His\r\nCause. Then shall the Knights of the Lord, assisted by grace from on high,\r\nstrengthened by faith, aided by the power of understanding and reinforced\r\nby the legions of the Covenant, arise and make manifest the truth of the\r\nverse: 'Behold the confusion that hath befallen the tribes of the\r\ndefeated!'\"\r\n\r\nDearly beloved friends, upon us devolves the supreme obligation to stand\r\nby His side, to fight His battles and to win His victory. May we prove\r\nourselves worthy of this trust.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nFebruary 12, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of February 20, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nDear and precious fellow-workers in the Vineyard of God:--\r\n\r\nThe communications addressed to me by your indefatigable and distinguished\r\nsecretary, dated October 28, November 8, 11, 18, December 4, 16 and\r\nJanuary 27th, have been received, and together with their enclosures read\r\nand carefully noted. I cannot but admire the spirit of unrelaxing resolve\r\nand harmonious cooperation with which you are conducting the\r\never-expanding activities of the Cause in a land upon which our Beloved\r\nhas lavished His richest blessings, and for the spiritual potentialities\r\nof which He cherished the brightest hopes. The vigorous efforts you are\r\nexerting to consolidate the forces which the Almighty has placed in your\r\nhands; the resourcefulness you display by the measures you have initiated\r\nfor the furtherance of the Cause; the magnificent response with which you\r\nhave met the piteous call of your suffering brethren of the East--all\r\nproclaim your worthiness of the unexampled efforts which, in your country\r\nmore than in any other land, 'Abdu'l-Baha has exerted for the spread of\r\nthe Revelation of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwofold Teaching Method\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the World Unity Conferences, which you have organized,\r\nI desire to assure you of my heartfelt appreciation of such a splendid\r\nconception. I am profoundly impressed by the generous assistance\r\nspontaneously offered by those who, faithful to their other obligations,\r\nhave risen to insure the financial success of such a noble Plan. I am\r\ngrateful to those local Assemblies and individuals who have given it their\r\nwhole-hearted support in their respective fields.\r\n\r\nAs to the policy that should be adopted with regard to these Conferences\r\nand other Baha'i activities in general, it appears increasingly evident\r\nthat as the Movement grows in strength and power the National Spiritual\r\nAssemblies should be encouraged, if circumstances permit and the means at\r\ntheir disposal justify, to resort to the twofold method of directly and\r\nindirectly winning the enlightened public to the unqualified acceptance of\r\nthe Baha'i Faith. The one method would assume an open, decisive and\r\nchallenging tone. The other, without implying in any manner the slightest\r\ndeparture from strict loyalty to the Cause of God, would be progressive\r\nand cautious. Experience will reveal the fact that each of the methods in\r\nits own special way might suit a particular temperament and class of\r\npeople, and that each in the present state of a constantly fluctuating\r\nsociety, should be judiciously attempted and utilized.\r\n\r\nIt is, I feel, for the National representatives of the believers in every\r\nland to utilize and combine both methods, the outspoken as well as the\r\ngradual, in such a manner as to secure the greatest benefits and the\r\nfullest advantage for this steadily-growing Cause. Every staunch and\r\nhigh-minded believer is thoroughly convinced of the unfailing efficacy of\r\nevery humanitarian undertaking which boldly and unreservedly proclaims the\r\nsource of its motive power to be the consciousness of the Revelation of\r\nBaha'u'llah. Yet, if we but call to mind the practice generally adopted by\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha, we cannot fail to perceive the wisdom, nay the necessity, of\r\ngradually and cautiously disclosing to the eyes of an unbelieving world\r\nthe implications of a Truth which, by its own challenging nature, it is so\r\ndifficult for it to comprehend and embrace.\r\n\r\nIt was He, our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, our true and shining Exemplar, who\r\nwith infinite tact and patience, whether in His public utterances or in\r\nprivate converse, adapted the presentation of the fundamentals of the\r\nCause to the varying capacities and the spiritual receptiveness of His\r\nhearers. He never hesitated, however, to tear the veil asunder and reveal\r\nto the spiritually ripened those challenging verities that set forth in\r\nits true light the relationship of this Supreme Revelation with the\r\nDispensations of the past. Unashamed and unafraid when challenged to\r\nassert in its entirety the stupendous claim of Baha'u'llah, Baha'is,\r\nwhether laboring as individuals or functioning as an organized community,\r\nfeel certain that in the face of the apathy, the gross materialism, and\r\nthe superficiality of society today, a progressive disclosure of the\r\nmagnitude of the claim of Baha'u'llah would constitute the most effective\r\nmeans for the attainment of the end so greatly desired by even the\r\nstaunchest and most zealous advocate of the Faith.\r\n\r\nFully aware of the repeated statements of 'Abdu'l-Baha that universality\r\nis of God, Baha'is in every land are ready, nay anxious, to associate\r\nthemselves by word and deed with any association of men which, after\r\ncareful scrutiny, they feel satisfied is free from every tinge of\r\npartisanship and politics and is wholly devoted to the interests of all\r\nmankind. In their collaboration with such associations they would extend\r\nany moral and material assistance they can afford, after having fulfilled\r\ntheir share of support to those institutions that affect directly the\r\ninterests of the Cause. They should always bear in mind, however, the\r\ndominating purpose of such a collaboration which is to secure in time the\r\nrecognition by those with whom they are associated of the paramount\r\nnecessity and the true significance of the Baha'i Revelation in this day.\r\n\r\nAs the Movement extends the bounds of its influence and its opportunities\r\nfor fuller recognition multiply, the twofold character of the obligations\r\nimposed on its National elected representatives should, I feel, be\r\nincreasingly emphasized. Whilst chiefly engaged in the pursuit of their\r\nmajor task, consisting chiefly in the formation and the consolidation of\r\nBaha'i administrative institutions, they should endeavor to participate,\r\nwithin recognized limits, in the work of institutions which though unaware\r\nof the claim of the Baha'i Cause are prompted by a sincere desire to\r\npromote the spirit that animates the Faith. In the pursuit of their major\r\ntask their function is to preserve the identity of the Cause and the\r\npurity of the mission of Baha'u'llah. In their minor undertaking their\r\npurpose should be to imbue with the spirit of power and strength such\r\nmovements as in their restricted scope are endeavoring to achieve what is\r\nnear and dear to the heart of every true Baha'i. It would even appear at\r\ntimes to be advisable and helpful as a supplement to their work for the\r\nBaha'is to initiate any undertaking, not specifically designated as\r\nBaha'i, provided they have ascertained that such an undertaking would\r\nconstitute the best way of approach to those whose minds and hearts are as\r\nyet unprepared for a full acceptance of the claim of Baha'u'llah. These\r\ntwofold obligations devolving upon organized Baha'i communities, far from\r\nneutralizing the effects of one another or of appearing antagonistic in\r\ntheir aims, should be regarded as complementary and fulfilling, each in\r\nits way, a vital and necessary function.\r\n\r\nIt is for the National representatives of the Baha'i Cause to observe the\r\nconditions under which they labor, to estimate the forces that are at work\r\nin their own surroundings, to weigh carefully and prayerfully the merits\r\nof either procedure, and to form a correct judgment as to the degree of\r\nemphasis that should be placed upon these twofold methods. Then and only\r\nthen will they be enabled to protect and stimulate on one hand the\r\nindependent growth of the Baha'i Faith, and on the other vindicate the\r\nclaim of its universal principles to the doubtful and unbelieving.\r\n\r\nI have already considered these delicate and complex issues with the\r\nBaha'i representatives whom I have requested to gather in the Holy Land in\r\nthe hope of arriving at the best possible solution of the pressing and\r\nintricate problems that confront the development of the Baha'i Cause. I\r\nhave asked our dearly-beloved brother, Mr. Mountfort Mills, whose services\r\nto the Cause only future generations can estimate, to acquaint you with\r\nthese and other considerations, the delicacy and scope of which only a\r\nverbal explanation can adequately reveal. He will fully and\r\nauthoritatively inform you regarding the policy that should govern the\r\nconduct of the Star of the West, the character and the range of the Baha'i\r\nBibliography to be inserted in the next edition of the Baha'i Year Book,\r\nthe present position of Baha'u'llah's House in Ba_gh_dad, the hopes and\r\ndesires I cherish for the successful conclusion of the Plan of Unified\r\nAction, and the consequences and possibilities involved in the decision of\r\nEgypt's religious Tribunal regarding the Muslim Baha'is in that land.\r\n\r\nThe splendid record of the action taken by the national and local\r\nrepresentatives of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, embodied\r\nin the compilation of newspaper cuttings which you have recently sent me,\r\nwill be forwarded to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of\r\nPersia. I will request them to pass it on from hand to hand, that the rank\r\nand file of the sufferers in that distracted country may obtain the\r\nstrength and solace which the perusal of such a noble record of service is\r\nbound to produce.\r\n\r\nRegarding the publicity campaign, recently launched, with your consent and\r\nunder your general supervision, by a group of devoted friends, I desire to\r\nexpress my earnest hope that it may be richly blessed by our Beloved and\r\nyield abundant fruit. I am gratified to learn that those who have\r\nconceived such a comprehensive plan and have generously supported it by\r\nevery means in their power have refrained from any action that would\r\ninvolve the imposing of a fresh burden upon those who have incurred the\r\nfinancial obligations connected with the Budget Plan. I earnestly hope\r\nthat those who have undertaken to finance this project with such\r\nspontaneous generosity have already fulfilled their sacred obligations in\r\nconnection with the Plan, and will not allow any pledges they have made\r\nfor publicity to interfere with their regular contributions to the\r\nNational Fund, the paramount importance of which has already been\r\nemphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spirit of Enterprise\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the duty and privilege of the National and Local Assemblies if they\r\nfind that the pressing requirements of their local and national budgets\r\nhave been adequately met, to encourage individuals and groups to initiate\r\nand conduct, with their knowledge and consent, any undertaking that would\r\nserve to enhance the work which they have set themselves to achieve. Not\r\ncontent with appeals addressed to each and every believer to offer any\r\nconstructive suggestions or plan that would remedy an existing grievance,\r\nthey should, by every means in their power, stimulate the spirit of\r\nenterprise among the believers in order to further the teaching as well as\r\nthe administrative work of the Cause. They should endeavor by personal\r\ncontact and written appeals, to imbue the body of the faithful with a deep\r\nsense of personal responsibility, and urge every believer, whether high or\r\nlow, poor or wealthy, to conceive, formulate and execute such measures and\r\nprojects as would redound, in the eyes of their representatives, to the\r\npower and the fair name of this sacred Cause.\r\n\r\nIn my hours of prayer at the holy Shrines, I will supplicate that the\r\nlight of Divine Guidance may illumine your path, and enable you to utilize\r\nin the most effective manner that spirit of individual enterprise which,\r\nonce kindled in the breasts of each and every believer and directed by the\r\ndiscipline of the majestic Law of Baha'u'llah, imposed upon us, will carry\r\nour beloved Cause forward to achieve its glorious destiny.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nFebruary 20, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of April 12, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the\r\nUnited States and Canada:\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved friends:\r\n\r\nYour recent communications, dated February 17 and March 2, 17 and 21, have\r\nbeen received, and their perusal has served to heighten my admiration for\r\nthe unflinching determination which characterizes the concerted efforts\r\nwhich you are exerting for the spread and consolidation of the Baha'i\r\nFaith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInter-racial Amity\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also received and read with the keenest interest and appreciation a\r\ncopy of that splendid document formulated by the National Committee on\r\ninter-racial amity and addressed to all the Spiritual Assemblies\r\nthroughout the United States and Canada. This moving appeal, so admirable\r\nin its conception, so sound and sober in its language, has struck a\r\nresponsive chord in my heart. Sent forth at a highly opportune moment in\r\nthe evolution of our sacred Faith, it has served as a potent reminder of\r\nthese challenging issues which still confront in a peculiar manner the\r\nAmerican believers.\r\n\r\nAs this problem, in the inevitable course of events, grows in acuteness\r\nand complexity, and as the number of the faithful from both races\r\nmultiplies, it will become increasingly evident that the future growth and\r\nprestige of the Cause are bound to be influenced to a very considerable\r\ndegree by the manner in which the adherents of the Baha'i Faith carry out,\r\nfirst among themselves and in their relations with their fellow-men, those\r\nhigh standards of inter-racial amity so widely proclaimed and so\r\nfearlessly exemplified to the American people by our Master 'Abdu'l-Baha.\r\n\r\nI direct my appeal with all the earnestness and urgency that this pressing\r\nproblem calls for to every conscientious upholder of the universal\r\nprinciples of Baha'u'llah to face this extremely delicate situation with\r\nthe boldness, the decisiveness and wisdom it demands. I cannot believe\r\nthat those whose hearts have been touched by the regenerating influence of\r\nGod's creative Faith in His day will find it difficult to cleanse their\r\nsouls from every lingering trace of racial animosity so subversive of the\r\nFaith they profess. How can hearts that throb with the love of God fail to\r\nrespond to all the implications of this supreme injunction of Baha'u'llah,\r\nthe unreserved acceptance of which, under the circumstances now prevailing\r\nin America, constitutes the hall-mark of a true Baha'i character?\r\n\r\nLet every believer, desirous to witness the swift and healthy progress of\r\nthe Cause of God, realize the twofold nature of his task. Let him first\r\nturn his eyes inwardly and search his own heart and satisfy himself that\r\nin his relations with his fellow-believers, irrespective of color and\r\nclass, he is proving himself increasingly loyal to the spirit of his\r\nbeloved Faith. Assured and content that he is exerting his utmost in a\r\nconscious effort to approach nearer every day the lofty station to which\r\nhis gracious Master summons him, let him turn to his second task, and,\r\nwith befitting confidence and vigor, assail the devastating power of those\r\nforces which in his own heart he has already succeeded in subduing. Fully\r\nalive to the unfailing efficacy of the power of Baha'u'llah, and armed\r\nwith the essential weapons of wise restraint and inflexible resolve, let\r\nhim wage a constant fight against the inherited tendencies, the corruptive\r\ninstincts, the fluctuating fashions, the false pretences of the society in\r\nwhich he lives and moves.\r\n\r\nIn their relations amongst themselves as fellow-believers, let them not be\r\ncontent with the mere exchange of cold and empty formalities often\r\nconnected with the organizing of banquets, receptions, consultative\r\nassemblies, and lecture-halls. Let them rather, as equal co-sharers in the\r\nspiritual benefits conferred upon them by Baha'u'llah, arise and, with the\r\naid and counsel of their local and national representatives, supplement\r\nthese official functions with those opportunities which only a close and\r\nintimate social intercourse can adequately provide. In their homes, in\r\ntheir hours of relaxation and leisure, in the daily contact of business\r\ntransactions, in the association of their children, whether in their\r\nstudy-classes, their playgrounds, and club-rooms, in short under all\r\npossible circumstances, however insignificant they appear, the community\r\nof the followers of Baha'u'llah should satisfy themselves that in the eyes\r\nof the world at large and in the sight of their vigilant Master they are\r\nthe living witnesses of those truths which He fondly cherished and\r\ntirelessly championed to the very end of His days. If we relax in our\r\npurpose, if we falter in our faith, if we neglect the varied opportunities\r\ngiven us from time to time by an all-wise and gracious Master, we are not\r\nmerely failing in what is our most vital and conspicuous obligation, but\r\nare thereby insensibly retarding the flow of those quickening energies\r\nwhich can alone insure the vigorous and speedy development of God's\r\nstruggling Faith.\r\n\r\nI would particularly address my appeal to you, as the Trustees of God's\r\nsacred Faith, to reaffirm by word and deed the spirit and character of the\r\ninsistent admonitions of 'Abdu'l-Baha, so solemnly and so explicitly\r\nuttered in the course of His journeys through your land--a trust which it\r\nis your privilege and function to preserve and fortify.\r\n\r\nMay the varied opportunities presented by the forthcoming assembly of the\r\nfriends at Green Acre this summer--a place so admirably suited to the\r\nrealization of such a noble ideal--be fully utilized to further this noble\r\nend. May it, on one hand, serve to banish once and for all every misgiving\r\nand mistrust as to the attitude that should characterize the conduct of\r\nthe members of the Baha'i family, and, on the other, serve to familiarize\r\nthe invited public with that aspect of our Faith which, owing to the\r\npressure of circumstances, a few have inclined to belittle or ignore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Acre--a Testing Ground\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my earnest hope and prayer that the forthcoming gathering at Green\r\nAcre, the program for which has been so carefully and judiciously\r\nprepared, may serve as a testing ground for the application of those\r\nideals and standards that are the distinguishing features of the\r\nRevelation of Baha'u'llah. May the assembled believers--now but a tiny\r\nnucleus of the Baha'i Commonwealth of the future--so exemplify that spirit\r\nof universal love and fellowship as to evoke in the minds of their\r\nassociates the vision of that future City of God which the almighty arm of\r\nBaha'u'llah can alone establish.\r\n\r\nNot by merely imitating the excesses and laxity of the extravagant age\r\nthey live in; not by the idle neglect of the sacred responsibilities it is\r\ntheir privilege to shoulder; not by the silent compromise of the\r\nprinciples dearly cherished by 'Abdu'l-Baha; not by their fear or\r\nunpopularity or their dread of censure can they hope to rouse society from\r\nits spiritual lethargy, and serve as a model to a civilization the\r\nfoundations of which the corrosion of prejudice has well-nigh undermined.\r\nBy the sublimity of their principles, the warmth of their love, the\r\nspotless purity of their character, and the depth of their devoutness and\r\npiety, let them demonstrate to their fellow-countrymen the ennobling\r\nreality of a power that shall weld a disrupted world.\r\n\r\nWe can prove ourselves worthy of our Cause only if in our individual\r\nconduct and corporate life we sedulously imitate the example of our\r\nbeloved Master, Whom the terrors of tyranny, the storms of incessant\r\nabuse, the oppressiveness of humiliation, never caused to deviate a hair's\r\nbreadth from the revealed Law of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nSuch is the path of servitude, such is the way of holiness He chose to\r\ntread to the very end of His life. Nothing short of the strictest\r\nadherence to His glorious example can safely steer our course amid the\r\npitfalls of this perilous age, and lead us on to fulfill our high destiny.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nApril 12, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of April 27, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved friends:\r\n\r\nWith feelings of horror and indignation I communicate to you the tale of\r\nyet another tragedy involving the shedding of the blood of a martyr of the\r\nFaith on Persia's sacred soil. I have before me, as I pen these lines, the\r\nreport of the local Spiritual Assembly of Ardibil, a town on the\r\nnorth-east confines of the province of A_dh_irbayjan, not far distant from\r\nthose hallowed spots where the Bab suffered His last confinement and\r\nmartyrdom. Addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of\r\nPersia, this report recounts in simple but moving language the\r\ncircumstances that have led to the cowardly crime committed in the\r\ndarkness of the night at the instigation of the fanatical clergy--the\r\ndeadliest opponents of the Faith in that town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssassination of Persian Believer\r\n\r\n\r\nOur martyred brother, Aminu'l-'Ulama' by name, had for some time past\r\nbecome notorious in the eyes of the Muslim inhabitants of Ardibil for his\r\ntenacity of faith by openly refusing at every instance to vilify and\r\nrenounce his most cherished convictions. In the latter part of Ramadan--the\r\nmonth associated with prayer, pious deeds and fasting--his use of the\r\npublic bath (that long-established institution the amenities and\r\nprivileges of which are as a rule accorded only to the adherents of the\r\nMuslim Faith) had served to inflame the mob, and to provide a scheming\r\ninstigator with a pretext to terminate his life. In the market place he\r\nwas ridiculed and condemned as an apostate of the Faith of Islam, who, by\r\nboldly rejecting the repeated entreaties showered upon him to execrate the\r\nBaha'i name, had lawfully incurred the penalty of immediate death at the\r\nhands of every pious upholder of the Muslim tradition.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the close surveillance exercised by a body of guards stationed\r\naround his house, in response to the intercession of his friends with the\r\nlocal authorities, the treacherous criminal found his way into his home,\r\nand on the night of the 22nd of Ramadan, corresponding with the 26th of\r\nMarch, 1927, assailed him in a most atrocious and dastardly manner.\r\nConcealing within the folds of his garment his unsheathed dagger, he\r\napproached his victim and claiming the need of whispering a confidential\r\nmessage in his ears, plunged the weapon hilt-deep into his vitals, cutting\r\nacross his ribs and mutilating his body. Every attempt to secure immediate\r\nmedical assistance seems to have been foiled by malicious devices on the\r\npart of the associates of this merciless criminal, and the helpless victim\r\nafter a few hours of agonizing pain surrendered his soul to his Beloved.\r\nHis friends and fellow-believers, alarmed at the prospect of a fresh\r\noutbreak that would inevitably result were his mortal remains to be\r\naccorded the ordinary privileges of a decent burial, decided to inter his\r\nbody in one of the two rooms that served as his own dwelling, seeking\r\nthereby to appease the fury of an unrelenting foe.\r\n\r\nHe leaves behind in desperate poverty a family of minors with no support\r\nbut their mother, expectant to bring forth her child, and with no hope of\r\nrelief from their non-Baha'i relatives in whose eyes they deserve to be\r\ntreated only with the meanest contempt.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the above-mentioned report that the merciless assailant\r\nhas been arrested, waiting, however, as has been the case with similar\r\nincidents in southern Persia, to be sooner or later released under the\r\npressure of bribery and intimidation sedulously exercised by an impenitent\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nDearest friends! Any measure of publicity the concerted efforts of the\r\nBaha'i Spiritual Assemblies of the West, on whom almighty Providence has\r\nconferred the inestimable benefits of religious toleration and freedom,\r\ncan accord to this latest manifestation of unbridled barbarism in Persia\r\nwill be most opportune and valuable. It will, I am certain, confer abiding\r\nsolace to those disconsolate sufferers who with sublime heroism continue\r\nto uphold the traditions of their beloved Faith. Our one weapon lies in\r\nour prayerful efforts, intelligently and persistently pursued, to arouse\r\nby every means at our disposal the conscience of unheeding humanity, and\r\nto direct the attention of men of vision and authority to these incredibly\r\nodious acts which in their ferocity and frequency cannot but constitute in\r\nthe eyes of every fair-minded observer the gravest challenge to all that\r\nis sacred and precious in our present-day civilization.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nApril 27, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of May 27, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the\r\nUnited States and Canada:\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved co-workers:\r\n\r\nYour communications dated April 15th and May 6th and 9th have been\r\nreceived, with their enclosures, and carefully perused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Trust and By-Laws\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Trust, the provisions of which you have so splendidly\r\nconceived, and formulated with such assiduous care, marks yet another\r\nmilestone on the road of progress along which you are patiently and\r\ndeterminedly advancing. Clear and concise in its wording, sound in\r\nprinciple, and complete in its affirmations of the fundamentals of Baha'i\r\nadministration, it stands in its final form as a worthy and faithful\r\nexposition of the constitutional basis of Baha'i communities in every\r\nland, foreshadowing the final emergence of the world Baha'i Commonwealth\r\nof the future. This document, when correlated and combined with the set of\r\nby-laws which I trust are soon forthcoming, will serve as a pattern to\r\nevery National Baha'i Assembly, be it in the East or in the West, which\r\naspires to conform, pending the formation of the First Universal House of\r\nJustice, with the spirit and letter of the world-order ushered in by\r\nBaha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nI eagerly await the receipt of the complete set of the contemplated\r\nby-laws, the purpose of which should be to supplement the provisions,\r\nclarify the purpose, and explain more fully the working of the principle\r\nunderlying the above-mentioned Declaration. I shall, after having given it\r\nmy close and personal consideration, transmit it to you, in order that you\r\nmay submit it to the local Spiritual Assemblies, who in turn will endeavor\r\nto secure its final ratification by the body of the recognized believers\r\nthroughout the United States and Canada. I would urge you to insert the\r\nText of the Declaration, the complete set of the by-laws, and the\r\naccompanying Indenture of Trust, all combined, in the next issue of the\r\nBaha'i Year Book, that sympathizers and believers alike in every land may\r\nobtain a clear and correct vision of the preliminary framework of that\r\ncomplete system of world administration implicit in the Teachings of\r\nBaha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpirit and Method of Baha'i Elections\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the best and most practical methods of procedure to be\r\nadopted for the election of Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies, I feel that in\r\nview of the fact that definite and detailed regulations defining the\r\nmanner and character of Baha'i elections have neither been expressly\r\nrevealed by Baha'u'llah nor laid down in the Will and Testament of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha, it devolves upon the members of the Universal House of\r\nJustice to formulate and apply such system of laws as would be in\r\nconformity with the essentials and requisites expressly provided by the\r\nAuthor and Interpreter of the Faith for the conduct of Baha'i\r\nadministration. I have consequently refrained from establishing a settled\r\nand uniform procedure for the election of the Assemblies of the East and\r\nthe West, leaving them free to pursue their own methods of procedure which\r\nin most cases had been instituted and practiced during the last two\r\ndecades of the life of 'Abdu'l-Baha.\r\n\r\nThe general practice prevailing throughout the East is the one based upon\r\nthe principle of plurality rather than absolute majority, whereby those\r\ncandidates that have obtained the highest number of votes, irrespective of\r\nthe fact whether they command an absolute majority of the votes cast or\r\nnot, are automatically and definitely elected. It has been felt, with no\r\nlittle justification, that this method, admittedly disadvantageous in its\r\ndisregard of the principle that requires that each elected member must\r\nsecure a majority of the votes cast, does away on the other hand with the\r\nmore serious disadvantage of restricting the freedom of the elector who,\r\nunhampered and unconstrained by electoral necessities, is called upon to\r\nvote for none but those whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to\r\nuphold. Moreover, the practice of nomination, so detrimental to the\r\natmosphere of a silent and prayerful election, is viewed with mistrust\r\ninasmuch as it gives the right to the majority of a body that, in itself\r\nunder the present circumstances, often constitutes a minority of all the\r\nelected delegates, to deny that God-given right of every elector to vote\r\nonly in favor of those who he is conscientiously convinced are the most\r\nworthy candidates. Should this simple system be provisionally adopted, it\r\nwould safeguard the spiritual principle of the unfettered freedom of the\r\nvoter, who will thus preserve intact the sanctity of the choice he first\r\nmade. It would avoid the inconvenience of securing advance nominations\r\nfrom absent delegates, and the impracticality of associating them with the\r\nassembled electors in the subsequent ballots that are often required to\r\nmeet the exigencies of majority vote.\r\n\r\nI would recommend these observations to your earnest consideration, and\r\nwhatever decision you arrive at, all local Assemblies and individual\r\nbelievers, I am certain, will uphold, for their spiritual obligation and\r\nprivilege is not only to consult freely and frequently with the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly, but to uphold as well with confidence and cheerfulness\r\nwhatever is the considered verdict of their national representatives.\r\n\r\nWishing you success from all my heart,\r\n\r\nI am, your true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nMay 27, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of October 17, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Honored Members of the Baha'i National Spiritual Assemblies\r\nthroughout the West.\r\n\r\nMy dear fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nWith feelings of burning indignation I find myself impelled to acquaint\r\nyou with various events that have recently transpired in Persia. Though in\r\ntheir immediate effect these happenings may prove gravely disquieting to\r\nthe followers of the Faith in Persia and elsewhere, yet they cannot but\r\neventually contribute to the strengthening and purification of the Cause\r\nwe steadfastly love and serve.\r\n\r\nI refer to the treacherous conduct of a professed adherent of the teaching\r\nof Baha'u'llah, by the name of 'Abdu'l-Husayn Avarih, hitherto regarded as\r\na respected teacher of the Cause, and not unknown by a few of its\r\nfollowers in Europe. Of a nature and character whom those who have learned\r\nto know him well have never ceased to despise, even in the brightest days\r\nof his public career in the Cause, he has of late been driven by the force\r\nof circumstances which his shortsightedness has gravely miscalculated to\r\nthrow off the mask which for so many years hid his hideous self.\r\n\r\nThe sudden removal of the commanding personality of our beloved\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha; the confused consternation that seized His followers in the\r\nyears immediately succeeding His passing; the reputation which to\r\nsuperficial eyes he had acquired by his travels in Europe; the success\r\nattending his voluminous compilation of the history of the Cause--these and\r\nother circumstances emboldened him to launch a campaign of insinuation and\r\nfraud aiming at the eventual overthrow of the institutions expressly\r\nprovided by Baha'u'llah. He saw clearly his chance in the complete\r\ndisruption of the Cause to capture the allegiance if not of the whole\r\nworld-wide Baha'i community of at least a considerable section of its\r\nfollowers in the East.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had his evil whisperings reached the ears of the loyal and\r\nvigilant followers of Baha'u'llah, than they arose with overwhelming force\r\nand unhesitating determination to denounce him as a dangerous enemy\r\nseeking to undermine the faith and sap the loyalty of the adherents of the\r\nCause of God. Shunned by the entire body of the believers, abandoned by\r\nhis life-long and most intimate friends, deserted by his wife, separated\r\nfrom his only child, refused admittance into even his own home, denied of\r\nthe profit he hoped to derive from the sale and circulation of his book,\r\nhe found to his utter amazement and remorse his best hopes irretrievably\r\nshattered.\r\n\r\nForsaken and bankrupt, and in desperate rage, he now with startling\r\naudacity sought to expose to friend and foe, the futility and hollowness\r\nwhich he attributed to the Cause, thereby revealing the depths of his own\r\ndegradation and folly. He has with bitter hatred conspired with the\r\nfanatical clergy and the orthodox members of foreign Missions in Tihran,\r\nallied himself with every hostile element in the Capital, directed with\r\nfiendish subtlety his appeal to the highest dignitaries of the State and\r\nsought by every method to secure financial assistance for the furtherance\r\nof his aim.\r\n\r\nNot content with an infamous denunciation of the originality and efficacy\r\nof the teachings and principles of the Cause, not satisfied with a\r\nrejection of the authenticity of the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha,\r\nhe has dared to attack the exalted person of the Author and Founder of the\r\nFaith, and to impute to its Forerunner and true Exemplar the vilest\r\nmotives and most incredible intentions.\r\n\r\nHe has most malignantly striven to revive the not unfamiliar accusation of\r\nrepresenting the true lovers of Persia as the sworn enemies of every form\r\nof established authority in that land, the unrelenting disturbers of its\r\npeace, the chief obstacles to its unity and the determined wreckers of the\r\nvenerated faith of Islam. By every artifice which a sordid and treacherous\r\nmind can devise he has sought in the pages of his book to strike terror in\r\nthe heart of the confident believer, to sow the seeds of doubt in the mind\r\nof the well-disposed and friendly, to poison the thoughts of the\r\nindifferent and to reinforce the power of the assaulting weapon of the\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! he has labored in vain, oblivious of the fact that all the pomp\r\nand powers of royalty, all the concerted efforts of the mightiest\r\npotentates of Islam, all the ingenious devices to which the cruelest\r\ntorture-mongers of a cruel race have for well-nigh a century resorted,\r\nhave proved one and all impotent to stem the tide of the beloved Faith or\r\nto extinguish its flame. Surely, if we read the history of this Cause\r\naright, we cannot fail to observe that the East has already witnessed not\r\na few of its sons, of wider experience, of a higher standing, of a greater\r\ninfluence, apostatize their faith, find themselves to their utter\r\nconsternation lose whatsoever talent they possessed, recede swiftly into\r\nthe shadows of oblivion and be heard of no more.\r\n\r\nShould ever his book secure widespread circulation in the West, should it\r\never confuse the mind of the misinformed and stranger, I have no doubt\r\nthat the various Baha'i National Spiritual Assemblies, throughout the\r\nWestern world, will with the wholehearted and sustained support of local\r\nAssemblies and individual believers arise with heart and soul for the\r\ndefence of the impregnable stronghold of the Cause of God, for the\r\nvindication of the sacredness and sublimity of the Baha'i Teachings, and\r\nfor the condemnation, in the eyes of those who are in authority, of one\r\nwho has so basely dared to assail, not only the tenets, but the holy\r\nperson of the recognized Founder of an established and world-wide Faith.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine; October 17, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of October 18, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved co-workers:\r\n\r\nI have already expressed indirectly my views with regard to various\r\nsecondary issues raised in your latest communications to me dated May 23,\r\nJune 10, 21, July 11, 14, 15 and 25, August 7 and September 28; and I wish\r\nin this letter to deal more particularly with such matters of primary\r\nimportance as affect the conduct and the growth of Baha'i administration.\r\nThe perusal of these communications replete with the news of steadily\r\nmultiplying activities and newly conceived plans, all of which I as\r\nheretofore appreciate and welcome, has made me feel however that the time\r\nseems now opportune to utter a word of caution and warning to those who\r\nwith unceasing zest labor to give befitting embodiment to those latent\r\nenergies released by the Message of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcentration of Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch as I rejoice in witnessing the abundant signs of unfaltering energy\r\nthat characterize in various fields and distant lands the mission of the\r\nvaliant warriors of the Cause, I cannot help observing that, driven by\r\ntheir impetuous eagerness to establish the undisputed reign of Baha'u'llah\r\non this earth, they may by an undue multiplication of their activities,\r\nand the consequent dissipation of their forces, defeat the very purpose\r\nwhich animates them in the pursuit of their glorious task. Particularly do\r\nI feel that this necessity for a careful estimation of the present\r\nresources at our disposal and of cautious restraint in handling them\r\napplies in a peculiar manner to the swiftly expanding activities of the\r\nAmerican believers, whose mission increasingly appears to be to give the\r\nlead and set the example to their brethren across the seas in laying a\r\nsecure foundation for the permanent institutions of the Baha'i Faith. That\r\nI feel is chiefly the reason why such stress has been laid in the past\r\nupon the necessity for consultation on the part of individual believers\r\nwith their elected national representatives in the matter of initiating\r\nplans of action above and beyond the plans which the deliberations of the\r\nNational Spiritual Assembly have already evolved. In the matter of\r\naffiliation with bodies and organizations that advocate ideals and\r\nprinciples that are in sympathy with the Baha'i Revelation; in\r\nestablishing magazines beyond those that already are designed to advance\r\nopenly and indirectly the interests of the Baha'i Teachings; in the\r\nfinancial support we may sooner or later be called upon to extend to\r\nphilanthropic institutions and the like; in advancing the cause of any\r\nparticular activity to which we may feel sentimentally inclined;--these, as\r\nwell as all similar undertakings, we should only approach after having\r\ndefinitely ascertained, through careful deliberation with those who are in\r\na responsible position, that the institutions representing the paramount\r\ninterests of the Cause are already assured of adequate and continuous\r\nassistance. Nothing short of the spirit of earnest and sustained\r\nconsultation with those whom we have prayerfully and of our own accord\r\nplaced in the forefront of those who are the custodians of the priceless\r\nheritage bequeathed by Baha'u'llah; nothing less than persistent and\r\nstrenuous warfare against our own instincts and natural inclinations, and\r\nheroic self-sacrifice in subordinating our own likings to the imperative\r\nrequirements of the Cause of God, can insure our undivided loyalty to so\r\nsacred a principle--a principle that will for all time safeguard our\r\nbeloved Cause from the allurements and the trivialities of the world\r\nwithout, and of the pitfalls of the self within. I entreat you,\r\nwell-beloved brethren, to resolve as you never have resolved before to\r\npledge undying loyalty and sleepless vigilance in upholding so essential a\r\nprinciple in the course of your manifold activities, that yours may be the\r\nabiding satisfaction of having done nothing that may tend in the least to\r\nimpede the flow or obscure the radiance of the rejuvenating spirit of the\r\nFaith of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations of Committees to Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nTouching the recent decision of the National Spiritual Assembly to place\r\nas much as possible of the current details of the work in the hands of its\r\nnational committees, I feel I should point out that this raises a\r\nfundamental issue of paramount importance, as it involves a unique\r\nprinciple in the administration of the Cause, governing the relations that\r\nshould be maintained between the central administrative body and its\r\nassisting organs of executive and legislative action. As it has been\r\nobserved already, the role of these committees set up by the National\r\nSpiritual Assembly, the renewal, the membership and functions of which\r\nshould be reconsidered separately each year by the incoming National\r\nAssembly, is chiefly to make thorough and expert study of the issue\r\nentrusted to their charge, advise by their reports, and assist in the\r\nexecution of the decisions which in vital matters are to be exclusively\r\nand directly rendered by the National Assembly. The utmost vigilance, the\r\nmost strenuous exertion is required by them if they wish to fulfill as\r\nbefits their high and responsible calling, the functions which it is\r\ntheirs to discharge. They should, within the limits imposed upon them by\r\npresent-day circumstances, endeavor to maintain the balance in such a\r\nmanner that the evils of over-centralization which clog, confuse and in\r\nthe long run depreciate the value of the Baha'i services rendered shall on\r\none hand be entirely avoided, and on the other the perils of utter\r\ndecentralization with the consequent lapse of governing authority from the\r\nhands of the national representatives of the believers definitely averted.\r\nThe absorption of the petty details of Baha'i administration by the\r\npersonnel of the National Spiritual Assembly is manifestly injurious to\r\nefficiency and an expert discharge of Baha'i duties, whilst the granting\r\nof undue discretion to bodies that should be regarded in no other light\r\nthan that of expert advisers and executive assistants would jeopardize the\r\nvery vital and pervading powers that are the sacred prerogatives of bodies\r\nthat in time will evolve into Baha'i National Houses of Justice. I am\r\nfully aware of the strain and sacrifice which a loyal adherence to such an\r\nessential principle of Baha'i administration--a principle that will at once\r\nennoble and distinguish the Baha'i method of administration from the\r\nprevailing systems of the world--demands from the national representatives\r\nof the believers at this early stage of our evolution. Yet I feel I cannot\r\nrefrain from stressing the broad lines along which the affairs of the\r\nCause should be increasingly conducted, the knowledge of which is so\r\nessential at this formative period of Baha'i administrative institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy-Laws of National Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, I have read and re-read most carefully the final\r\ndraft of the By-Laws drawn up by that highly-talented, much-loved servant\r\nof Baha'u'llah, Mountfort Mills, and feel I have nothing substantial to\r\nadd to this first and very creditable attempt at codifying the principles\r\nof general Baha'i administration. I heartily and unhesitatingly commend it\r\nto the earnest perusal of, and its loyal adoption by, every National\r\nBaha'i Spiritual Assembly, whether constituted in the East or in the West.\r\nI would ask you particularly to send copies of the text of this document\r\nof fundamental importance accompanied by copies of the Declaration of\r\nTrust and the text of the Indenture of Trust, to every existing National\r\nSpiritual Assembly, with my insistent request to study the provisions,\r\ncomprehend its implications, and endeavor to incorporate it, to the extent\r\nthat their own circumstances permit, within the framework of their own\r\nnational activities. You can but faintly imagine how comforting a\r\nstimulant and how helpful a guide its publication and circulation will be\r\nto those patient and toiling workers in Eastern lands, and particularly\r\nPersia, who in the midst of uncertainties and almost insuperable obstacles\r\nare straining every nerve in order to establish the world order ushered in\r\nby Baha'u'llah. You can hardly realize how substantially it will\r\ncontribute to pave the way for the elaboration of the beginnings of the\r\nconstitution of the worldwide Baha'i Community that will form the\r\npermanent basis upon which the blest and sanctified edifice of the first\r\nInternational House of Justice will securely rest and flourish.\r\n\r\nI would specifically remind you that in the text of the said By-Laws which\r\nto the outside world represents the expression of the aspirations, the\r\nmotives and objects that animate the collective responsibilities of Baha'i\r\nFellowship, due emphasis should not be placed only on the concentrated\r\nauthority, the rights, the privileges and prerogatives enjoyed by the\r\nelected national representatives of the believers, but that special stress\r\nbe laid also on their responsibilities as willing ministers, faithful\r\nstewards and loyal trustees to those who have chosen them. Let it be made\r\nclear to every inquiring reader that among the most outstanding and sacred\r\nduties incumbent upon those who have been called upon to initiate, direct\r\nand coordinate the affairs of the Cause, are those that require them to\r\nwin by every means in their power the confidence and affection of those\r\nwhom it is their privilege to serve. Theirs is the duty to investigate and\r\nacquaint themselves with the considered views, the prevailing sentiments,\r\nthe personal convictions of those whose welfare it is their solemn\r\nobligation to promote. Theirs is the duty to purge once for all their\r\ndeliberations and the general conduct of their affairs from that air of\r\nself-contained aloofness, from the suspicion of secrecy, the stifling\r\natmosphere of dictatorial assertiveness, in short, from every word and\r\ndeed that might savor of partiality, self-centeredness and prejudice.\r\nTheirs is the duty, while retaining the sacred and exclusive right of\r\nfinal decision in their hands, to invite discussion, provide information,\r\nventilate grievances, welcome advice from even the most humble and\r\ninsignificant members of the Baha'i family, expose their motives, set\r\nforth their plans, justify their actions, revise if necessary their\r\nverdict, foster the spirit of individual initiative and enterprise, and\r\nfortify the sense of interdependence and co-partnership, of understanding\r\nand mutual confidence between them on one hand and all local Assemblies\r\nand individual believers on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst National Convention of Persian Baha'is\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the state of affairs in Persia, where the circumstances related in a\r\nprevious circular letter have had their share in intensifying the chronic\r\nstate of instability and insecurity that prevail, grave concern has been\r\nfelt lest the support, both moral and financial, anticipated from the\r\nbigoted elements of foreign Missions in the Capital should lead to an\r\nextension of its circulation in the West, and thus inflict, however\r\nslight, a damage on the prestige and fair name of our beloved Cause. These\r\ninternal agitations, however, coinciding as they have done with outbursts\r\nof sectarian fanaticism from without, accompanied by isolated cases of\r\nfresh persecution in Kirman and elsewhere, have failed to exasperate and\r\nexhaust the heroic patience of the steadfast lovers of the Cause. They\r\nhave even failed to becloud the serenity of their faith in the inevitable\r\napproach of the breaking of a brighter dawn for their afflicted country.\r\nUndeterred and undismayed, they have replied to the defiance of the\r\ntraitor within, and the assaults of the enemy without by a striking\r\nre-affirmation of their unbroken solidarity and inflexible resolve to\r\nbuild with infinite patience and toil on the sure foundations laid for\r\nthem by Baha'u'llah. With their traditional fidelity and characteristic\r\nvigor, notwithstanding the unimaginable hindrances they have to face, they\r\nhave convened their first historic representative conference of various\r\ndelegates from the nine leading provinces of Persia, have evolved plans\r\nfor holding every year as fully representative a convention of Baha'i\r\ndelegates in Persia as circumstances permit, and modelled after the method\r\npursued by their brethren in the United States and Canada. They have\r\nreconstituted and defined the limits of the hitherto confused Baha'i\r\nadministrative divisions throughout the length and breadth of their land.\r\nThey have adopted various resolutions of vital importance, the chief ones\r\namong them aiming at the reorganization of the institution of the National\r\nFund, the consolidation and extension of their national campaign of\r\nTeaching, the strengthening of the bonds that unite them with the local\r\nand national Assemblies at home and abroad, the establishment of Baha'i\r\nprimary educational institutions in towns and villages, the raising of the\r\nsocial and educational standards of women, irrespective of sect and caste,\r\nand the reinforcement of those forces that tend to raise the moral,\r\ncultural and material standard of their fellow-countrymen. Surely, to an\r\nunbiased observer of the present state of affairs in Persia, these\r\nresolutions, backed by the creative energy inherent in the power of the\r\nWord of God, mark not only a milestone on the road of the progress of the\r\nPersian believers, but constitute as well a notable landmark in the\r\ncheckered history of their own country.\r\n\r\nThe warm hospitality accorded by the National Spiritual Assembly and the\r\nAmerican believers to my dear cousin and collaborator, Ruhi Effendi, has\r\ndeeply touched me, particularly as I realize from the appreciative reports\r\nI have recently received that by his radiant and earnest spirit of service\r\nhe has deserved well of his dear fellow-workers in that continent, and\r\ncontributed substantially to their better appreciation of the Teachings of\r\nthe Cause. Much as I desire him to work by my side here in the Holy Land,\r\nI very gladly concur with your wish to further extend his sojourn with\r\nyou, trusting that he will prove of great assistance to you all in the\r\ndischarge of your noble task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trend of World Events\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now in conclusion, may I be permitted to direct your attention to the\r\nlesson which the trend of world events brings home to us, the little band\r\nof His chosen workers who, according to the intelligent efforts we exert,\r\ncan prove ourselves the determining factor in the immediate fortunes of\r\nthe society we live in? As we witness on all sides the growing\r\nrestlessness of a restless age, we are filled with mixed feelings of fear\r\nand hope--fear, at the prospect of yet another deadly encounter, the\r\ninevitability of which is alas! becoming increasingly manifest; hope, in\r\nthe serene assurance that whatever cataclysm may yet visit humanity, it\r\ncannot but hasten the approaching era of universal and lasting peace so\r\nemphatically proclaimed by the Pen of Baha'u'llah. In the political\r\ndomain, where we have lately witnessed, in the council of the leading\r\nnations of the world, the surrender of humanity's noblest conception to\r\nwhat may be regarded only as a transient phase in the life of peoples and\r\nnations; in the industrial world, where the representatives of the\r\nwage-earning classes, either through violence or persuasion, are capturing\r\nthe seats of authority and wielding the scepter of power: in the field of\r\nreligion, where we have lately witnessed widespread and organized attempts\r\nto broaden and simplify the basis of man's faith, to achieve unity in\r\nChristendom and restore the regenerating vigor of Islam; in the heart of\r\nsociety itself, where the ominous signs of increasing extravagance and\r\nprofligacy are but lending fresh impetus to the forces of revolt and\r\nreaction that are growing more distinct every day--in these as in many\r\nothers we have much cause for alarm, but much to be hopeful and thankful\r\nfor also. To take but one instance more fully: Observe the fierce and as\r\nyet unsilenced dispute which the proposal for the introduction of a\r\nbinding and universal pact of non-aggression among the nations of Europe\r\nhas aroused among the avowed supporters of the League of Nations--a League\r\nso auspiciously welcomed for the ideal that prompted its birth, yet now so\r\nutterly inadequate in the actual principles that underlie its present-day\r\nstructure and working. And yet, in the great outcry raised by post-war\r\nnationalism in blindly defending and upholding the unfettered supremacy of\r\nits own sovereignty, and in repudiating unreservedly the conception of a\r\nworld super-state, can we not discern the re-enactment only on a larger\r\nscale of the dramatic struggles that heralded the birth of the\r\nreconstructed and unified nations of the West? Has not authentic history\r\nclearly revealed in the case of these nations the painful yet inevitable\r\nmerging of rival, particularistic and independent cities and\r\nprincipalities into one unified national entity, the evolving of a crude\r\nand narrow creed into a nobler and wider conception? Is not a parallel\r\nstruggle being now manifested on the world stage of ever-advancing\r\nhumanity? Can it lead to any other result than that which shall reaffirm\r\nthe truth of humanity's onward march towards an ever-widening conception,\r\nand the ever-brightening glory of its destiny? Reverses and setbacks, such\r\nas we have already witnessed, no doubt will retard the ripening of the\r\nchoicest fruit on the tree of human development. Yet the fierceness of\r\ncontroversy, the weight of argument advanced in its disfavor, cannot but\r\ncontribute to the broadening of the basis and the consolidation of the\r\nfoundations upon which the stately edifice of unified mankind must\r\nultimately rest. Let us take heart therefore, and labor with renewed vigor\r\nand deepened understanding to contribute our share to those forces which,\r\nwhether or not cognizant of the regenerating Faith of Baha'u'llah in this\r\nage, are operating, each in its respective sphere and under His\r\nall-encompassing guidance, for the uplift and the salvation of humanity.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nOctober 18, 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of December 6, 1928.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:\r\n\r\nEvents, of a startling character and of the utmost significance to the\r\nFaith of Baha'u'llah, have recently transpired throughout the Near and\r\nMiddle East in such rapid succession, that I feel moved to write about\r\nthem to those who, in distant lands and with eager hearts, are waiting to\r\nwitness the fulfillment of the prophecies of Baha'u'llah. You will, I am\r\ncertain, rejoice with me to learn that the quickening forces of internal\r\nreform are swiftly awakening from their age-long slumber of negligence\r\nthose lands which, trodden by the feet of Baha'u'llah and wherein are\r\nenshrined the memorable scenes of His birth, His ministry, His exiles, His\r\nbanishments, His suffering and His ascension, are destined in the fulness\r\nof time to play a pre-eminent role in the regeneration of the East--nay of\r\nall mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Promises of Our Departed Master\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Persia, the cradle of our Faith and the object of our tenderest\r\naffections, there breaks upon us the news of the first stirrings of that\r\nsocial and political Reformation which, as we firmly believe, is but the\r\ndirect and unavoidable consequence of that great spiritual Revival ushered\r\nin by the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. These social and political forces now\r\nreleased by the Source of such a tremendous Revival are bound in their\r\nturn to demolish one by one the barriers that have so long impeded its\r\nflow, sapped its vitality and obscured its radiance.\r\n\r\nFrom a communication addressed to me recently by the National Spiritual\r\nAssembly of the Baha'is of Persia, as well as from reliable reports\r\nsubmitted by the local representatives of the Persian believers, and\r\nconfirmed by the vivid narrative of visiting pilgrims, it is becoming\r\nincreasingly manifest that the glowing promises so many times uttered by\r\nour departed Master are, with extraordinary exactitude and remarkable\r\nswiftness, being successively fulfilled. Reforms of a revolutionary\r\ncharacter are, without bloodshed and with negligible resistance, gradually\r\ntransforming the very basis and structure of Persia's primitive society.\r\nThe essentials of public security and order are being energetically\r\nprovided throughout the length and breadth of the _Sh_ah's domain, and are\r\nhailed with particular gratification by that much harassed section of the\r\npopulation--our long-suffering brethren of that land. The rapidity, the\r\nincredible ease, with which the enlightened proposals of its government,\r\nin matters of education, trade and finance, means of transportation and\r\ntravel, and the development of the country's internal resources, are\r\nreceiving the unqualified sanction of a hitherto reactionary Legislature,\r\nand are overcoming the resistance and apathy of the masses, have\r\nundoubtedly tended to hasten the emancipation of our Persian brethren from\r\nthe remaining fetters of a once despotic and blood-stained regime. The\r\nseverely repressive and humiliating measures undertaken on the initiative\r\nof progressive provincial Governors, and with the connivance of State\r\nofficials in the Capital, aiming at the scattering and ultimate extinction\r\nof a rapidly waning clergy, such as degradation, detainment, deportation\r\nand in some cases pitiless execution, are paving the way for the entire\r\nremoval of the shackles imposed by an ignorant and fanatical priesthood\r\nupon the administration of State affairs. In matters of dress; in the\r\nobligatory enforcement of a uniform style of national head-gear; in the\r\nstrict limitation of the number, the rights and the prerogatives of high\r\necclesiastical officials; in the growing unpopularity of the veil among\r\nalmost every section of society; in the marked distinction which\r\nunofficially and in various phases of public life is being made by an\r\nenlightened and pressing minority between the tottering forms of a\r\ndiscredited Ecclesiasticism and the civil rights and duties of civilized\r\nsociety; in the general laxity in religious observances and ceremonies; in\r\nthe slow and hidden process of secularization invading many a government\r\ndepartment under the courageous guidance of the Governors of outlying\r\nprovinces--in all of these a discerning eye can easily discover the\r\nsymptoms that augur well for a future that is sure to witness the formal\r\nand complete separation of Church and State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegeneration of Persia\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this uplifting movement, various external factors are being added that\r\nare tending to hasten and stimulate this process of internal regeneration\r\nso significant in the life of renascent Persia. The multiplicity and\r\nincreasing facilities in the means of transportation and travel; the State\r\nvisit of energetic and enlightened reformers to Persia's capital; the\r\nforthcoming and widely-advertised journey of the _Sh_ah himself to the\r\nprogressive capitals of Western Europe; the repercussion of Turkey's\r\nastounding reforms among an essentially sensitive and receptive people;\r\nthe loud and persistent clamor of a revolting order in Russia against the\r\nevil domination and dark plottings of all forms of religious sectarianism;\r\nthe relentless vigor with which Afghanistan's ambitious Ruler, reinforced\r\nby the example of his gracious Consort, is pursuing his campaign of\r\nrepression against a similar order of a corrupted clergy at home--all tend\r\nto lend their force in fostering and fashioning that public opinion which\r\ncan alone provide an enduring basis for the reform Movement destined to\r\nusher in that golden Era craved for by the followers of the Faith in\r\nBaha'u'llah's native land.\r\n\r\nAs a direct consequence of the birth of this new consciousness in the life\r\nof the nation, as evidenced by these early stirrings in the minds of the\r\npeople, both high and low, meetings of an elaborate character,\r\nunprecedented in the number of their attendants, in the tone of the public\r\naddresses, in the undisturbed atmosphere of their proceedings, and the\r\ngeneral impressiveness of their organization, have been publicly held in\r\nTihran, under the auspices of the National Spiritual Assembly of the\r\nBaha'is of Persia. Particularly significant and impressive were those that\r\nwere held in the Haziratu'l-Quds, the administrative and spiritual center\r\nof the Faith in the Capital, on the occasion of the twin Festivals\r\ncommemorating the declaration of the Bab and the birth of 'Abdu'l-Baha, at\r\nthe chief of which no less than two thousand representative Baha'is and\r\nnon-Baha'is, leaders of public opinion, State officials and foreign\r\nrepresentatives were officially invited. The addresses stressing the\r\nuniversality of the Teachings of the Cause, the formal and ordered\r\ncharacter of the proceedings so unusual a feature to a gathering of such\r\nproportions, the mingling of the Baha'is with the recognized\r\nrepresentatives of progressive thought in the Capital who, by virtue of\r\ntheir high office and stately appearance, lent color and weight to the\r\nconcourse of attending believers, have all contributed to enhance the\r\nbrilliance and spiritual significance of that gathering on that memorable\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, reports of a highly encouraging nature, are being continually\r\nreceived from local Assemblies and individual believers, giving the names\r\nand stating the number of influential Persians who, hitherto reluctant to\r\ndeclare openly their faith in Baha'u'llah, are as a result of this\r\nreassuring and promising state of affairs emerging from the obscurity of\r\ntheir concealment and enlisting under the erected banner of Baha'u'llah.\r\nThis has served to embolden the followers of the Faith to take the\r\nnecessary steps, under the direction of their local Assemblies, for the\r\ninstitution of Baha'i schools, for the holding of public gatherings, for\r\nthe establishment of Baha'i hostels, libraries and public baths, for the\r\nconstruction of official headquarters for their administrative work, and\r\nfor the gradual execution among themselves, within the limits imposed upon\r\nthem by the State, of the laws and ordinances revealed in the\r\nKitab-i-Aqdas. Words fail me to describe the feelings of those patiently\r\nsuffering brethren of ours in that land who, with eyes dim with tears and\r\nhearts overflowing with thanksgiving and praise, are witnessing on every\r\nside and with increasing force the unfoldment of a Faith which they have\r\nserved so well and love so dearly. Accounts pathetic and inspiring in\r\ntheir tone are being received from that steadfast and cheerful band of\r\nexultant believers, and are being shared with the resident friends in the\r\nHoly Land who, having had the privilege of close and continued association\r\nwith the person of 'Abdu'l-Baha, cannot but marvel at the range, the\r\npotency and accuracy of the prophecies of their departed Master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'i Faith Vindicated in Turkey\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Turkey, on whose soil, for well nigh three score years and ten, were\r\nenacted some of the sublimest and most tragic scenes in the annals of the\r\nCause; Turkey, under whose rule Baha'u'llah twice proclaimed Himself, was\r\nthrice exiled and banished, and finally ascended to the Abha Kingdom, and\r\nwhere 'Abdu'l-Baha spent more than fifty years of His Life, in\r\nincarceration and suffering; has of late been rudely awakened to a Call\r\nwhich it has so long obstinately despised and ignored. Following on the\r\noverthrow of that effete theocracy, resting on the twin institutions of\r\nthe Caliphate and Sultanate--those two sinister forces that have combined\r\nto inflict the deadliest blows to our beloved Faith in the earliest stages\r\nof its infancy and growth--an uncompromising policy aiming at the\r\nsecularization of the State and the disestablishment of Islam was\r\ninitiated and carried out with exemplary vigor. Religious institutions and\r\nmonastic orders which under the guise of religious propaganda were\r\nconverted into hot-beds of political intrigue and sedition were\r\nperemptorily closed, their adherents scattered and banished, their funds\r\nconfiscated, their privileges and prerogatives abolished. None, save the\r\nlittle band of Baha'u'llah's devoted followers, escaped the trenchant ax\r\nof the pitiless reformer; all, without fear or favor, had to submit to his\r\nsearching investigations, his dictatorial edicts, his severe and\r\nirrevocable judgment. Lately, however, the Turkish Government, faithful to\r\nits policy of ceaseless vigilance, and fearful of the growing activities\r\nof the Baha'is under its rule, decided to order the Police in the town of\r\nSmyrna to conduct a close investigation into the purpose, the character\r\nand the effects of Baha'i activity in that town. No sooner were the\r\nrepresentative Baha'is in that locality arrested and conducted to the Law\r\nCourts for purposes of investigation, than the President of the Baha'i\r\nSpiritual Assembly of Constantinople who, having read in the morning\r\npapers the report of the Smyrna incident, had resolved unsummoned to offer\r\nthe necessary explanations to the authorities concerned, was in his turn\r\narrested and taken to the Police Headquarters where he soon afterwards was\r\njoined by the other members of the Assembly. The official searching of\r\ntheir homes, the seizure of whatever Baha'i literature they had in their\r\npossession, their twenty-four hours detention at the Police station, the\r\nsearching severity of the cross-examination to which they were\r\nsubjected--all proved powerless to alarm and shake the faith of those\r\nintrepid champions of the Cause, or to evince anything detrimental to the\r\nbest interests of the State. On the contrary, they served to deeply\r\nimpress upon the minds and hearts of the officials concerned the\r\nsublimity, the innocence, and the dynamic force of the Faith of\r\nBaha'u'llah. So much so that their books were returned, a genuine desire\r\nto deepen their knowledge of the Cause was expressed by their examiners,\r\nand widespread publicity, as reflected in the articles of about a dozen\r\nleading newspapers of Turkey, was accorded by the Government, proclaiming\r\nthe innocence of the Cause and lifting up the ban that now so oppressively\r\nweighs upon religious institutions in Turkey.\r\n\r\nFrom Constantinople in European Turkey to the eastern confines of\r\nAnatolia, on the banks of the river Euphrates, where a small and\r\nflourishing Baha'i Community has been recently established, a wave of\r\npublic interest, criticism and inquiry has been sweeping over the surface\r\nof the land, as witnessed by the character and number of the leading\r\narticles, the illustrations and caricatures that have appeared in the most\r\nprominent newspapers of the capital and the provincial towns of Asiatic\r\nTurkey. Not only Turkey, but its neighboring countries of the East and the\r\nWest, have lifted up their voice in the vindication of the Baha'i truth.\r\nFrom information thus far gathered we learn that in Hungary, in 'Iraq,\r\nEgypt and Syria, and as far west as France and England, newspapers have,\r\nof their own accord, with varying degree of accuracy, and in more or less\r\ndetail, reported this incident in their columns, and have given, unasked\r\nand unaware, such publicity to our beloved Faith which no campaign of\r\nteaching, however elaborately organized by the believers themselves, could\r\never hope to achieve at the present time. Surely the invincible arm of\r\nBaha'u'llah, working through strange and mysterious ways, will continue to\r\nguard and uphold, to steer the course, to consolidate, and eventually to\r\nachieve the world-wide recognition and triumph of His holy Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Most Vital Opportunity\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd while the East, through suffering and turmoil, is moving on in its\r\nslow and toilsome march towards the acceptance of God's holy Faith, let us\r\nturn for a moment our gaze to the Western Hemisphere, and particularly to\r\nthe American continent, and attempt to visualize the possibilities of the\r\nfuture spread of the Cause, and to estimate afresh those golden yet\r\nswiftly passing opportunities which Baha'u'llah in those far-away lands\r\nhas accorded to His chosen people. I feel thoroughly convinced, and am\r\nmoved to share this firm conviction within me with that great company of\r\nwestern believers, that in the speedy resumption of the sorely-neglected\r\nconstruction of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar at Wilmette lies our undoubted\r\nprivilege, our primary obligation, our most vital opportunity to lend an\r\nunprecedented impetus to the advancement of the Cause, not only throughout\r\nthe West but in every country of the world. I would not stress at this\r\nmoment the prestige and good name of the Cause, much as they are involved\r\nin this most pressing issue, I would not dwell upon the eager expectancy\r\nwith which the unnumbered followers of the Faith as well as the vast\r\nnumber of the non-believers in almost every section of society throughout\r\nthe East are awaiting to behold that noble structure rear its head in the\r\nheart of that far-western continent; nor would I expatiate on the\r\nineffable beauty of this holy Edifice, its towering glory, its artistic\r\ndesign, its unique character, or its functions in the organic life of the\r\nBaha'i community of the future. But I would with all the strength of my\r\nconviction emphasize the immeasurable spiritual significance of an\r\nEdifice, so beauteous, so holy, erected solely by the concerted efforts,\r\nstrained to the utmost degree of self-sacrifice, of the entire body of the\r\nbelievers who are fully conscious of the significance of the Revelation of\r\nBaha'u'llah. In this vast endeavor, unparalleled in modern times, its\r\nworld-wide range, its spontaneity, its heroic and holy character, the\r\nAmerican believers, on the soil of whose country Baha'u'llah's first\r\nuniversal House of Worship is to be built, must, if they be faithful to\r\ntheir trust, claim and fulfill a pre-eminent share in the collective\r\ncontributions offered by the Baha'is of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's Cherished Desire\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this reason do I feel impelled to direct by incessant plea in\r\nparticular to the followers of the Faith in the United States and Canada\r\nto arise and play their part, while there is yet time, and not to allow\r\ntheir earnest strivings to be swamped and superseded by the\r\nself-sacrificing heroism of the multitude of their brethren in Persia.\r\nAgain I feel the urge to remind you one and all of the necessity of\r\nkeeping ever in mind this fundamental verity that the efficacy of the\r\nspiritual forces centering in, and radiating from, the first\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in the West will in a great measure depend upon the\r\nextent to which we, the pioneer workers in that land will, with clear\r\nvision, unquenchable faith, and inflexible determination, resolve to\r\nvoluntarily abnegate temporal advantages in our support of so meritorious\r\nan endeavor. The higher the degree of our renunciation and self-sacrifice,\r\nthe wider the range of the contributing believers, the more apparent will\r\nbecome the vitalizing forces that are to emanate from this unique and\r\nsacred Edifice; and the greater, in consequence, the stimulating effect it\r\nwill exert upon the propagation of the Faith in the days to come. Not by\r\nthe abundance of our donations, not even by the spontaneity of our\r\nefforts, but rather by the degree of self-abnegation which our\r\ncontributions will entail, can we effectively promote the speedy\r\nrealization of 'Abdu'l-Baha's cherished desire. How great our\r\nresponsibility, how immense our task, how priceless the advantages that we\r\ncan reap!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan of Unified Action\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain, however, from giving expression to my gratification and\r\nappreciation of the substantial and continued support already accorded,\r\nand in particular during the past year by the believers in the United\r\nStates and Canada, under the wise and judicious direction of their elected\r\nnational representatives, to the Plan of Unified Action, whose declared\r\npurpose is to insure, ere the present Baha'i year comes to a close, the\r\nraising of the funds required for the building of the first Unit of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar. The vigilance and fidelity with which the National\r\nAssembly of the United States and Canada has observed its pledge in\r\nconnection with the limitation of the current administrative expenses of\r\nthe Cause, and the zeal and ready response manifested by local Assemblies\r\nand individual believers to curtail their local and personal expenditures\r\nin order to concentrate on the Temple Fund, are worthy of the highest\r\npraise, and will deservedly attract the manifold blessings of a loving and\r\nbountiful Master. Much indeed has been accomplished during this past year\r\nof concentrated and consecrated self-sacrifice for so glorious a purpose.\r\nMuch more still remains unachieved if we are to vindicate, in the eyes of\r\nan expectant world, the honorable name, the inexhaustible and miraculous\r\nvitality of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-watches of the night, commemorating the passing of Him Who with\r\nHis own hands laid the head-cornerstone of His Father's House of Worship\r\nin that land, seated within the hallowed precincts of His shrine, and\r\nkeeping vigil in the company of His closest companions, I have more than\r\nonce in the midst of my devotions prayerfully remembered those chosen ones\r\nof God on whose shoulders has fallen so weighty a responsibility, whose\r\ndestiny is to bring to full fruition so excellent a heritage. I have\r\nrecalled on that peaceful and moonlit night, with much emotion and\r\ngratitude, the inestimable bounties He lavished while on earth upon you. I\r\nhave revived in my memory the glowing promises that His unfailing guidance\r\nand gracious assistance would continue from His station on high to be\r\nshowered upon you. I have pictured in my mind that beauteous vision of a\r\nCause unfolded in all its glory which in His immortal writings He has\r\nrevealed unto you. And with my head upon His threshold, I have prayed and\r\nprayed again that we may all prove ourselves worthy disciples of so\r\ngracious a Master, that we may, when called unto Him, transmit,\r\nundiminished and unimpaired, our share of the immeasurably precious\r\nheritage bequeathed by Him to us all.\r\n\r\nAnd in closing, dearly-beloved friends, what more appropriate thought with\r\nwhich to conclude my fervent plea than these pregnant words fallen from\r\nthe lips of Baha'u'llah: \"O My friends! I bear witness that the Divine\r\nBounty has been vouchsafed unto you, His Argument has been made manifest,\r\nHis Proof has been revealed, and His Guidance has shone forth upon you.\r\nLet it now be seen what your endeavors in the path of renunciation can\r\nreveal.\"\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nDecember 6, 1928.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of December 6, 1928.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe East and West.\r\n\r\nDear fellow-workers:\r\n\r\nI desire to convey to you in a few words my impressions of the recently\r\npublished \"Baha'i World,\" copies of which, I understand, have already,\r\nthanks to the assiduous care and indefatigable efforts displayed by the\r\nPublishing Committee of the American National Spiritual Assembly, been\r\nwidely distributed among the Baha'i countries of East and West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baha'i World\r\n\r\n\r\nThis unique record of world-wide Baha'i activity attempts to present to\r\nthe general public, as well as to the student and scholar, those\r\nhistorical facts and fundamental principles that constitute the\r\ndistinguishing features of the Message of Baha'u'llah to this age. I have\r\never since its inception taken a keen and sustained interest in its\r\ndevelopment, have personally participated in the collection of its\r\nmaterial, the arrangement of its contents, and the close scrutiny of\r\nwhatever data it contains.\r\n\r\nI confidently and emphatically recommend it to every thoughtful and eager\r\nfollower of the Faith, whether in the East or in the West, whose desire is\r\nto place in the hands of the critical and intelligent inquirer, of\r\nwhatever class, creed or color, a work that can truly witness to the high\r\npurpose, the moving history, the enduring achievements, the resistless\r\nmarch and infinite prospects of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. Eminently\r\nreadable and attractive in its features, reliable and authoritative in the\r\nmaterial it contains, up-to-date, comprehensive and accurate in the mass\r\nof information it gives, concise and persuasive in its treatment of the\r\nfundamental aspects of the Cause, thoroughly representative in the\r\nillustrations and photographs it reveals:--it stands unexcelled and\r\nunapproached by any publication of its kind in the varied literature of\r\nour beloved Cause. It will, without the slightest doubt, if generously and\r\nvigorously supported, arouse unprecedented interest among all classes of\r\ncivilized society.\r\n\r\nI earnestly request you, dearly-beloved friends, to exert the utmost\r\neffort for the prompt and widespread circulation of a book that so\r\nfaithfully and vividly portrays, in all its essential features, its\r\nfar-reaching ramifications and most arresting aspects, the\r\nall-encompassing Faith of Baha'u'llah. Whatever assistance, financial or\r\nmoral, extended by Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies and individual believers,\r\nto those who have been responsible for such a highly valuable and\r\nrepresentative production will, it should be remembered, be directly\r\nutilized to advance the interests and reinforce the funds that are being\r\nraised in behalf of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, and will indirectly serve\r\nto exert a most powerful stimulus in removing the malicious\r\nmisrepresentations and unfortunate misunderstandings that have so long and\r\nso grievously clouded the luminous Faith of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nDecember 6, 1928.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of December 21, 1928.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha!\r\n\r\nWith feelings of profound sorrow I am moved to address you these few lines\r\nmourning the loss which the Cause has undoubtedly sustained by the passing\r\nof one who, for many years and in circumstances of exceptional\r\nsignificance, rendered the sacred Threshold distinctive and inestimable\r\nservices. The hand of Divine Decree has removed, by the death of our\r\ntalented and dearly-beloved friend, Mr. Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney, yet\r\nanother outstanding figure in the Cause of Baha'u'llah, who, by his\r\nbrilliant gifts of mind and heart as well as by the divers achievements of\r\nhis life, has truly enriched the annals of God's immortal Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney\r\n\r\n\r\nA pioneer of the Cause of Baha'u'llah ever since its celestial light first\r\nwarmed and illuminated the West, he has, by his close association with the\r\nperson of 'Abdu'l-Baha, by his contact with all sections of society, by\r\nhis scholarly presentation of the history and fundamentals of the Faith,\r\nand lastly by his unforgettable share in the settlement of the complex and\r\npressing issues that called for expert assistance in the days following\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, achieved a standing which few have as yet\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nThe days of his spiritual communion with 'Abdu'l-Baha and His household\r\nwithin the walls of the prison-city of Akka, wherein he imbibed the\r\nprinciples which he later so ably expounded to the peoples of the West;\r\nhis pre-eminent role on his return to Paris in kindling the torch which is\r\ndestined to shed eternal illumination upon his native land and its people;\r\nthe links of abiding fellowship which he forged with our Persian brethren\r\nin the course of the historic mission entrusted to his charge by our\r\nBeloved; the seeds which he scattered far and wide during his subsequent\r\ntravels to the heart of Asia, throughout India, beyond the remotest\r\nvillages of Burma and as far as the eastern confines of Indo-China; the\r\nable support he lent in its initial and intermediary stages to the case of\r\nBaha'u'llah's house in Ba_gh_dad; his unhesitating intervention with State\r\nofficials in paving the way for the ultimate emancipation of our Egyptian\r\nbrethren from the yoke of orthodox Islam; the stimulating encouragement\r\nhis visit caused to the Baha'i community of Tunis on the northern shores\r\nof Africa; and last but not least the ability and diligence with which he\r\napplied himself to the solution of the delicate and vexing problems of the\r\nHoly Land in the critical years following 'Abdu'l-Baha's ascension--all\r\nstand out as memorable landmarks in a life that was as varied in its\r\ninternational aspects as it was rich in its spiritual experience.\r\n\r\nHis gifts of unfailing sympathy and penetrating insight, his wide\r\nknowledge and mature experience, all of which he utilized for the glory\r\nand propagation of the Message of Baha'u'llah, will be gratefully\r\nremembered by future generations who, as the days go by, will better\r\nestimate the abiding value of the responsibilities he shouldered for the\r\nintroduction and consolidation of the Baha'i Faith in the Western world.\r\n\r\nSuffering as he did in his last days from the effects of a slow and\r\npainful illness, he bore heroically his share of the afflictions of the\r\nworld, and is now in the realms of blissful deliverance partaking his full\r\nshare of the goodly reward which he certainly deserved. To me, and\r\nparticularly amid the storm and stress that have agitated my life after\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, he was a sustaining and comforting companion, a\r\nmost valued counsellor, an intimate and trusted friend.\r\n\r\nWith much emotion and the deepest sense of gratitude I supplicate at the\r\nholy Threshold--and request you to join with me in my prayers--for the\r\nspiritual advancement in the realms above of a soul who by the sheer merit\r\nof the signal services he rendered already deserves to rank highly among\r\nthe departed faithful.\r\n\r\nMay he forever rest in peace.\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nDecember 21, 1928.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of January 1, 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved co-workers:\r\n\r\nWhilst the Baha'is of Persia, constituting the overwhelming majority of\r\nthe adherents of the Baha'i Faith in eastern lands, are tasting the\r\nfirst-fruits of their long-dreamed emancipation, a not inconsiderable\r\nsection of Baha'u'llah's following in the East, inhabiting the provinces\r\nof Caucasus and Turkistan, are being subjected to trials and tribulations\r\nnot very dissimilar, though inferior in intensity, to the afflictions\r\nborne so long and so heroically by their Persian brethren.\r\n\r\nIn my last communication to you I have attempted to depict the nature and\r\nswiftness of those liberating forces which today are being released in\r\nPersia by an enlightened regime determined to shake off with unconcealed\r\ncontempt the odious fetters of a long standing tyranny. And I feel that a\r\ndescription of the very perplexing situation with which our brethren in\r\nRussia find themselves confronted at present will serve to complete the\r\npicture which responsible believers in the West must bear in mind of the\r\ncritical and swiftly moving changes that are transforming the face of the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersecutions in Russia\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the counter-revolution that proclaimed throughout the length\r\nand breadth of Czarist Russia the dictatorship of the Proletariat, and the\r\nsubsequent incorporation of the semi-independent territories of Caucasus\r\nand Turkistan within the orbit of Soviet rule, the varied and numerous\r\nBaha'i institutions established in the past by heroic pioneers of the\r\nFaith have been brought into direct and sudden contact with the internal\r\nconvulsions necessitated by the establishment and maintenance of an order\r\nso fundamentally at variance with Russia's previous regime. The avowed\r\npurpose and action of the responsible heads of the Union of Soviet\r\nSocialist Republics who, within their recognized and legitimate rights,\r\nhave emphatically proclaimed and vigorously pursued their policy of\r\nuncompromising opposition to all forms of organized religious propaganda,\r\nhave by their very nature created for those whose primary obligation is to\r\nlabor unremittingly for the spread of the Baha'i Faith a state of affairs\r\nthat is highly unfortunate and perplexing. For ten years, however, ever\r\nsince the promulgation of that policy, by some miraculous interposition of\r\nProvidence, the Baha'is of Soviet Russia have been spared the strict\r\napplication to their institutions of the central principle that directs\r\nand animates the policy of the Soviet state. Although subjected, as all\r\nRussian citizens have been, even since the outbreak of the Revolution, to\r\nthe unfortunate consequences of civil strife and external war, and\r\nparticularly to the internal commotions that must necessarily accompany\r\nfar-reaching changes in the structure of society, such as partial\r\nexpropriation of private property, excessive taxation and the curtailment\r\nof the right of personal initiative and enterprise; yet in matters of\r\nworship and in the conduct of their administrative and purely\r\nnon-political activities they have, thanks to the benevolent attitude of\r\ntheir rulers, enjoyed an almost unrestricted freedom in the exercise of\r\ntheir public duties.\r\n\r\nLately, however, due to circumstances wholly beyond their control and\r\nwithout being in the least implicated in political or subversive activity,\r\nour Baha'i brethren in those provinces have had to endure the rigid\r\napplication of the principles already enunciated by the state authorities\r\nand universally enforced with regard to all other religious communities\r\nunder their sway. Faithful to their policy of expropriating in the\r\ninterests of the State all edifices and monuments of a religious\r\ncharacter, they have a few months ago approached the Baha'i\r\nrepresentatives in Turkistan, and after protracted negotiations with them,\r\ndecided to claim and enforce their right of ownership and control of that\r\nmost cherished and universally prized Baha'i possession, the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of I_sh_qabad. The insistent and repeated\r\nrepresentations made by the Baha'is, dutifully submitted and stressed by\r\ntheir local and national representatives, and duly reinforced by the\r\naction of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia,\r\nemphasizing the international character and spiritual significance of the\r\nEdifice and its close material as well as spiritual connection with the\r\ndivers Baha'i communities throughout the East and West, have alas! proved\r\nof no avail. The beloved Temple which had been seized and expropriated and\r\nfor three months closed under the seal of the Municipal authorities was\r\nreopened and meetings were allowed to be conducted within its walls only\r\nafter the acceptance and signature by the Baha'i Spiritual Assembly of\r\nI_sh_qabad of an elaborate contract drawn by the Soviet authorities and\r\nrecognizing the right of undisputed ownership by the State of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar and its dependencies. According to this contract,\r\nthe Temple is rented by the State for a period of five years to the local\r\nBaha'i community of that town, and in it are stipulated a number of\r\nobligations, financial and otherwise, expressly providing for fines and\r\npenalties in the event of the evasion or infringement of its provisions.\r\n\r\nTo these measures which the State, in the free exercise of its legitimate\r\nrights, has chosen to enforce, and with which the Baha'is, as befits their\r\nposition as loyal and law-abiding citizens, have complied, others have\r\nfollowed which though of a different character are none the less\r\ngrievously affecting our beloved Cause. In Baku, the seat of the Soviet\r\nRepublic of Caucasus, as well as in Ganjih and other neighboring towns,\r\nstate orders, orally and in writing, have been officially communicated to\r\nthe Baha'i Assemblies and individual believers, suspending all meetings,\r\ncommemoration gatherings and festivals, suppressing the committees of all\r\nBaha'i local and national Spiritual Assemblies, prohibiting the raising of\r\nfunds and the transmission of financial contributions to any center within\r\nor without Soviet jurisdiction, requiring the right of full and frequent\r\ninspection of the deliberations, decisions, plans and action of the Baha'i\r\nAssemblies, dissolving young men's clubs and children's organizations,\r\nimposing a strict censorship on all correspondence to and from Baha'i\r\nAssemblies, directing a minute investigation of Assemblies' papers and\r\ndocuments, suspending all Baha'i periodicals, bulletins and magazines, and\r\nrequiring the deportation of leading personalities in the Cause whether as\r\npublic teachers and speakers or officers of Baha'i Assemblies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuiding Principle of Conduct\r\n\r\n\r\nTo all these the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah have with feelings\r\nof burning agony and heroic fortitude unanimously and unreservedly\r\nsubmitted, ever mindful of the guiding principles of Baha'i conduct that\r\nin connection with their administrative activities, no matter how\r\ngrievously interference with them might affect the course of the extension\r\nof the Movement, and the suspension of which does not constitute in itself\r\na departure from the principle of loyalty to their Faith, the considered\r\njudgment and authoritative decrees issued by their responsible rulers\r\nmust, if they be faithful to Baha'u'llah's and 'Abdu'l-Baha's express\r\ninjunctions, be thoroughly respected and loyally obeyed. In matters,\r\nhowever, that vitally affect the integrity and honor of the Faith of\r\nBaha'u'llah, and are tantamount to a recantation of their faith and\r\nrepudiation of their innermost belief, they are convinced, and are\r\nunhesitatingly prepared to vindicate by their life-blood the sincerity of\r\ntheir conviction, that no power on earth, neither the arts of the most\r\ninsidious adversary nor the bloody weapons of the most tyrannical\r\noppressor, can ever succeed in extorting from them a word or deed that\r\nmight tend to stifle the voice of their conscience or tarnish the purity\r\nof their faith. Clinging with immovable resolution to the inviolable\r\nverities of their cherished Faith, our sorely-tried brethren in Caucasus\r\nand Turkistan have none the less, as befits law-abiding Baha'i citizens\r\nresolved, after having exhausted every legitimate means for the\r\nalleviation of the restrictions imposed upon them, to definitely uphold\r\nand conscientiously carry out the considered judgment of their recognized\r\ngovernment. They have with a hope that no earthly power can dim, and a\r\nresignation that is truly sublime, committed the interests of their Cause\r\nto the keeping of that vigilant, that all-powerful Divine Deliverer, who,\r\nthey feel confident, will in time lift the veil that now obscures the\r\nvision of their rulers, and reveal the nobility of aim, the innocence of\r\npurpose, the rectitude of conduct, and the humanitarian ideals that\r\ncharacterize the as yet small yet potentially powerful Baha'i communities\r\nin every land and under any government.\r\n\r\nShould the present restrictions increase in number and stringency, should\r\na situation arise that would so endanger the position of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in I_sh_qabad as to necessitate the intervention of\r\nthe Baha'i world, I will call upon the National and Local Baha'i Spiritual\r\nAssemblies in the East and the West to arise with one accord and lend\r\ntheir moral support to those of their brethren whose particular mission\r\nand privilege is to keep watch over that consecrated ground on which\r\nalready has been erected the central Structure of Baha'u'llah's First\r\nUniversal House of Worship. I will urge them to take whatever action is\r\ndeemed advisable in order to demonstrate the solidarity of the followers\r\nof Baha'u'llah, to dispel whatever doubts and apprehensions may yet linger\r\nin the minds of the State officials in that land, and to restore their\r\nsuspected brethren to the esteem and confidence of their governors. I will\r\nspecially request them to proclaim in their written representations to the\r\nauthorities concerned their absolute repudiation of whatever ulterior\r\nmotive or political design may be imputed to them by their malignant\r\nadversaries, and to reaffirm in unmistakable terms the purely humanitarian\r\nand spiritual nature of the work in which Baha'is in every land and of\r\nevery race are unitedly engaged. I will moreover ask them to assert the\r\ninternational character of the Baha'i Edifice in I_sh_qabad and to stress\r\nthe close bonds of material interest and spiritual fellowship that bind\r\nBaha'i communities the world over to an Edifice that can rightly claim the\r\ndistinction of being Baha'u'llah's First Universal House of Worship, of\r\nbeing conceived in its design by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself, constructed and\r\ncompleted in His days and under His direction, and supported by the\r\ncollective contributions of the believers throughout the world. The hour\r\nfor such a world-wide and concentrated appeal is not yet come, but it\r\nbehooves us, while expectantly watching from a distance the moving\r\nspectacle of the struggling Faith of Baha'u'llah, to seek abiding solace\r\nand strength from the reflection that whatever befalls this Cause, however\r\ngrievous and humiliating the visitations that from time to time may seem\r\nto afflict the organic life or interfere with the functions of the\r\nadministrative machinery of the Baha'i Faith, such calamities cannot but\r\neach eventually prove to be a blessing in disguise designed, by a Wisdom\r\ninscrutable to us all, to establish and consolidate the sovereignty of\r\nBaha'u'llah on this earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'u'llah's House at Baghdad\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we have already witnessed in connection with the latest developments\r\nregarding the case of Baha'u'llah's House in Ba_gh_dad affords abundant\r\nevidence of the truth of the observation that has just been made. In its\r\ninitial stages appearing to the superficial observer as a petty dispute\r\nsubmitted to an obscure and antiquated Shiite court, the case has\r\ngradually evolved into a paramount issue engaging the attention of the\r\nhighest tribunal of 'Iraq. In its latest stages, it has gathered such\r\nstrength, secured such publicity, and received such support from the\r\nchancelleries of Europe, as to become a subject fit for the consideration\r\nnot only of the specific international Commission ultimately responsible\r\nfor the administration of Mandated Territories but of the leading\r\nSignatories of the Covenant of the League of Nations that are represented\r\nin the Council of the League itself.\r\n\r\nFew if any among those closely associated with the case did at first\r\nimagine or expect that dwellings which to outward seeming appeared only as\r\na cluster of humble and decrepit buildings lost amid the obscure and\r\ntortuous lanes of old Ba_gh_dad could ever obtain such prominence as to\r\nbecome the object of the deliberations of the highest international\r\nTribunal that the hand of man has thus far reared for the amicable\r\nsettlement of his affairs. Whatever the decision of the world's highest\r\nTribunal regarding the petition submitted to it by the Baha'is of\r\n'Iraq--and none can deny that should its verdict be in our favor, a triumph\r\nunparalleled in its magnitude will have been achieved for our beloved\r\nFaith--the work already accomplished is in itself an abundant proof of the\r\nsustaining confirmations that are being showered upon the upholders of the\r\ncase from the realm on high.\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from giving expression in this connection to my feelings\r\nof profound appreciation of the ceaseless vigilance and marked distinction\r\nwith which our precious brother and fellow-worker, Mr. Mountfort Mills,\r\nhas undertaken and is still shouldering this sacred and historic mission\r\ncommitted to his charge. His unremitting labors, despite ill-health and\r\ndomestic anxieties and cares, are worthy of the highest praise and will be\r\ngratefully recorded in the annals of an immortal Cause.\r\n\r\nSurely, if we read the history of this case aright, we cannot but discern\r\nthe direction which the forces, released by these prophetic utterances of\r\nBaha'u'llah sixty years ago, are destined to take in the eventual solution\r\nof this mighty issue:--\r\n\r\n\"In truth I declare, it shall be so abased in the days to come as to cause\r\ntears to flow from every discerning eye.... And in the fullness of time\r\nshall the Lord, by the power of truth, exalt it in the eyes of all the\r\nworld, cause it to become the mighty standard of His Dominion, the Shrine\r\nround which shall circle the concourse of the faithful.\"\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nJanuary 1, 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of February 12, 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nFellow-laborers in the Divine Vineyard:\r\n\r\nI feel impelled by the force of various circumstances to share with you\r\nthe news of recent happenings in those countries of the Near and Middle\r\nEast which, by the ruling of Providence, are in these days undergoing a\r\ntransformation which is as startling in its features as it is significant\r\nin its bearings upon the interests of our beloved Faith.\r\n\r\nI have already in my previous communication briefly referred to the nature\r\nand effects of that momentous Revolution which has, with surprising\r\nswiftness, substituted a westernized and rejuvenated Turkey for the\r\nprimitive and decrepit Ottoman Empire. I have also attempted to describe\r\nthe first stages of that recent and moving episode which has served in a\r\nmanner that is truly providential to thrust the Baha'i community in Turkey\r\nout of the obscurity of oppressive neglect into the broad daylight of\r\nofficial and public attention.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, from the reports that have been received from the\r\nelected representatives of the believers in different parts of Turkey, it\r\nappears that the investigations conducted by the Police authorities in the\r\ncapital and provinces of that land have proved but a preliminary to a more\r\nofficial and detailed inquiry into the Baha'i position with respect to the\r\nlaws recently promulgated by the Republican government. For no sooner were\r\nthe followers of Baha'u'llah released from detention at the Police\r\nheadquarters and given the assurance that their Faith was in no way\r\nassociated with any political design or motive, than an official\r\ncommunication was delivered to their representatives summoning them to\r\nappear before the State's criminal Tribunal on the charge of infraction of\r\nthe law of the Republic requiring the registration and authorization of\r\nall public gatherings and associations within the jurisdiction of the\r\nState. To this summons our brethren yielded immediate and implicit\r\nobedience. They indeed welcomed this further opportunity to assert not\r\nonly the innocence of their Faith but to vindicate as well the sublimity\r\nof the teachings of Baha'u'llah. Realizing that with this fresh\r\ndevelopment their case has assumed a solemn and juridical character, the\r\nundaunted champions of the Cause resolved to seek the assistance of an\r\nexpert and sympathetic advocate, who would reinforce from a purely legal\r\nstandpoint the spiritual argument which they reserved for themselves to\r\npropound. For a period ranging from a week to eighteen days the attention\r\nof the officers of the Court, of the elected representatives of the\r\nbelievers, of their officially appointed advocates, and of the visiting\r\npublic was focused upon the deliberations of a Court that closely\r\nscrutinized not only the conduct and motives of the Baha'i followers but\r\nthe laws and principles, the past history and the present position of the\r\nFaith itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial of Turkish Believers\r\n\r\n\r\nFortified by the reflection that never before in Baha'i history have the\r\nfollowers of Baha'u'llah been called upon by the officials of a State,\r\nresponsible for the administration of Justice, to unfold the history and\r\nprinciples of their Faith, our brethren in Turkey decided to assert in\r\ntheir entirety those distinguishing laws and ordinances of the Baha'i\r\nRevelation which the terrors of a suspicious autocracy had so long\r\ncompelled them to dissimulate and ignore.\r\n\r\nI cannot do better than quote in this connection a few passages from the\r\ntext of the official defense which in a moving language was pronounced by\r\nthe President of the Constantinople Baha'i Spiritual Assembly at a plenary\r\nsession of the Court on that historic occasion: \"La Beha'isme est une\r\nreligion universelle, moderne et absolument independante. Si l'on desire\r\nune designation plus moderne encore: c'est une institution de Clemence, de\r\nbonne entente et d'amour, en d'autres termes, de progres moral et\r\nspirituel. Il n'est ni une secte, ni une branche des autres religions et\r\ndoctrines diverses. Il est cependant leur aboutissement naturel, logique\r\net pour ainsi dire scientifique. C'est la raison pour laquelle l'on trouve\r\nparmi ses adherents des personnes, venant de toutes les religions et\r\ndoctrines existantes dans le monde, et qui se comptent aujourd'hui par\r\nmillions. ...Ces explications ne sauraient toutefois a devoiler le suffire\r\n(?) mystere qui est au fond des sacrifices, consentis dans ce siecle en\r\nOrient, par plus de vingt mille martyrs du Beha'isme, parmi lesquels se\r\ntrouve Qurratu'l-'Ayn Tahirih (la joie des yeux, la pure), cette jeune\r\nfemme turque, depeinte ainsi par notre illustre ecrivain Suleyman Nasif,\r\net dont le martyre sans precedent est cite aujourd'hui par le monde entier\r\ncomme l'epopee sans pareille de la cause humaine. Je ne sais si ces\r\nexplications peuvent elucider les raisons pour lesquelles il se trouve a\r\ncette doctrine petrie egalement par le sang turc des amis parmi des hommes\r\nde race turque, cette race qui dans tout proces du genre humain et de ses\r\nnobles aspirations, n'a pas hesite jusqu'ici a verser son sang....\r\nToutefois, les Beha'is n'ont point dissimule leur presence en Turquie,\r\nsurtout depuis le regime de la Republique. C'est ainsi qu'ils se sont fait\r\ninscrire comme Beha'is sur les feuilles du dernier recensement a\r\nConstantinople. D'autre part est-il admissible que le Gouvernement ignore\r\nleur presence dans cette ville? Cela etant, il ne saurait etre imagine que\r\nles Beha'is soient sous le regime de la Republique, poursuivis comme tels,\r\nsurtout apres avoir acquis leur liberte sous le regime de la Constitution\r\nqui a suivi celui de la tyrannie durant lequel ils etaient persecutes....\r\nMais avant de terminer, je ne puis m'empecher de dire avec une entiere\r\nassurance, que les adeptes en Turquie de cette doctrine, sont surs de la\r\nJustice d'un pays regi par la premiere veritable Republique pleine de\r\nlumiere dont s'honore adjourd'hui tout l'Orient.... Ces declarations d'une\r\npart, et la conduite suivie par les Beha'is, a l'occasion de cet incident\r\nqui a commence par l'interrogatoire auquel ils ont ete soumis par la\r\nPolice, de l'autre, sont la preuve convainquante de la sincerite et de la\r\nbonne foie avec lesquelles nous nous comportons tant vis a vis de la\r\nJustice que de celui du Gouvernement. Ainsi, nous aurions pu soustraire\r\ncertaines pieces qui constituent les seuls documents pouvant servi a nous\r\nassimiler a des societes. Ne nous voyant pas en contravention avec la loi,\r\nnous n'avons rien voulu dissimuler, comme personellement je ne cherche\r\nqu'a tout dire ici. Ce n'est la d'ailleurs qu'une necessite dicte par le\r\nBeha'isme et la conformation a une recommendation de Baha'u'llah. Lui nous\r\ndit: \"Devant la Justice, dites la Verite et ne craignez rien.\"\r\n\r\nTo these hotly contested debates two circumstances of unexpected character\r\nlent color and force, and must have contributed in no small measure to the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the issue. The participation of a noted Turkish\r\npublicist and author whose expressed sympathy for the Cause had identified\r\nhim with the group of the suspected believers, and the association of the\r\nname of the Dowager Queen of Rumania with the Baha'i Faith as a result of\r\nthe discovery among the seized documents of the Constantinople Baha'i\r\nAssembly of her public pronouncements on the Cause and her personal\r\nmessage to the friends in that city, both served to reinforce the position\r\nof the Baha'is and greatly encouraged them in their task. I am assured by\r\na letter addressed to me by the President of the Constantinople Assembly\r\nthat the sessions of the Court were dignified in their proceedings,\r\nsublime in the presentation of the ideals of the Cause, and representative\r\nin the character of their attendants. He writes: \"Ce fut une declaration\r\nde la Cause dans toute sa grandeur, et jamais l'Orient n'a vu retentir le\r\nnom de Baha dans une pareille formule.... J'ai prefere laisser l'avocat\r\nqui n'est pas Beha'i en parler. En effet cela a eu plus d'effet d'entendre\r\nl'avocat, emporte par je ne sais quelle mysterieuse poussee, crier, apres\r\navoir cite les principes ainsi: 'Monsieur le Juge! n'est-ce pas la en\r\nsomme l'ideal vers lequel marche actuellement notre pays avec en tete\r\nnotre Grand Gazi?'\"\r\n\r\nThe extravagant language of the newspapers in reporting the details of\r\nthis official inquiry served in turn to accentuate the publicity already\r\nachieved, and induced the officials of the Court to exercise scrupulous\r\nimpartiality in the consideration and judgment of the case. As to the\r\nverdict that has been pronounced on December 13, it is stated clearly that\r\nalthough the followers of Baha'u'llah, in their innocent conception of the\r\nspiritual character of their Faith, found it unnecessary to apply for\r\nleave for the conduct of their administrative activities and have thus\r\nbeen made liable to the payment of a fine, yet they have, to the\r\nsatisfaction of the legal representatives of the State, not only\r\nestablished the inculpability of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, but have also\r\nworthily acquitted themselves in the task of vindicating its independence,\r\nits Divine origin, and its suitability to the circumstances and\r\nrequirements of the present age. It will be admitted that this recognition\r\non the part of the authorities would have never been so speedily secured\r\nhad the representatives of the believers proceeded through the ordinary\r\nand official channels to obtain such a recognition from their government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecline of Islam\r\n\r\n\r\nSurely every unprejudiced observer, reviewing on one hand the turbulent\r\nhistory of the Cause in Turkey and recalling on the other the series of\r\ninternal convulsions that have seized that country, cannot but marvel at\r\nthe contrast between the swift decline of an all-powerful theocracy and\r\nthe gradual consolidation of a persecuted Faith. He will appreciate the\r\nsignificance of the circumstances that have caused on one hand the\r\ndismemberment of what was the most powerful institution of Islam, and\r\ncontributed on the other to the emergence upon its ruins of the very Faith\r\nit has vainly labored to suppress. Should he look further into the past\r\nand consult the annals of Christendom during the first century of the\r\nChristian era, he cannot fail to observe the striking parallel between the\r\ncataclysmic visitation of Providence that has afflicted the most sacred\r\ninstitutions of the Jews in the Holy Land and the utter collapse in this,\r\nthe first century of the Baha'i era, of the Sultanate and the Caliphate,\r\nthe highest institutions of orthodox Islam. He will recall the severities\r\nwhich the hand of Titus inflicted upon the Jews, the harassing siege of\r\nJerusalem, the destruction of the Holy City, the profanation of the\r\nTemple, the desecration of the Holy of Holies, the transfer of its\r\npriceless treasures to the imperial city of Rome, the erection on the site\r\nof Zion of the pagan colony of Oelia Capitolina, the massacre of the Jews,\r\nand the exile and dispersion of most of the survivors. In like manner, he\r\nwill observe that almost in the corresponding decade of the first century\r\nof the era of Baha'u'llah, not at the hand of the infidel, but by a\r\nrecognized ruler professing the faith of Islam, a blow, unprecedented in\r\nits magnitude, has been dealt to the highest seats of authority in the\r\nIslamic world. He will call to mind the recent disestablishment of the\r\nstate religion of Turkey, the overthrow of the dynasty of the House of\r\nU_th_man, the loss of the unity of the vast majority of the adherents of\r\nthe Muhammadan Faith, the humiliation inflicted upon the whole hierarchy\r\nof its ecclesiastical exponents in that land, the abolition of religious\r\ncourts, the annulment of the provisions of the Qur'an, the promulgation of\r\na universal western code of civil law, the suppression of its Orders and\r\nthe closing of most of its seminaries and establishments.\r\n\r\nSuch a close correspondence between these historic retributions which the\r\nAlmighty's avenging arm has chosen to inflict upon the persecutors of\r\nChrist and Baha'u'llah cannot but fortify the confidence of every Baha'i\r\nbeliever in the future glories of this Divine Dispensation. Particularly\r\nwill he feel strengthened when he recalls the triumphs that have\r\nsignalized the advance of Christianity after the humiliation of its\r\nenemies. And as he ponders upon the circumstances that have given such\r\nstartling publicity to the Cause, not only throughout Turkey but in the\r\nadjoining countries as well, he cannot fail to recognize, in this strange\r\nepisode, following so closely upon the fall of the mighty stronghold of\r\nBaha'i opposition, a prelude to a higher recognition and fuller unfoldment\r\nof the Faith of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress in Persia\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Persia, where, unlike its ill-fated sister nation Af_gh_anistan, the\r\npace of reform has been wisely regulated, the salutary effects of the\r\nprogressive regime established by its enlightened ruler are not only\r\nreacting upon the social and economic structure of its society, but are\r\nbeing increasingly felt by the mass of the followers of Baha'u'llah in\r\nthat land. The welter of controversy into which the drastic reforms of a\r\ndetermined government, aiming at the gradual secularization of the State,\r\nhas plunged a revolting clergy, has afforded our Persian brethren their\r\nlong-desired opportunity to pursue untrammelled the course of their\r\nspiritual and humanitarian activities. The deportation of a considerable\r\nnumber of Muslim ecclesiastical officials, amongst them the heir of that\r\nnotorious and bloodthirsty Mujtahid of Isfahan, \"the Son of the Wolf,\" has\r\nserved to clear the ground for the extension and consolidation of Baha'i\r\ninstitutions. Already, as reported from an outlying center in the province\r\nof Yazd, a leading but fair-minded Mullah has, upon the discovery of the\r\nspecific prophecy of 'Abdu'l-Baha regarding the forced abandonment of the\r\ntraditional headdress of Muslim clericals, acknowledged the Divine origin\r\nof the Baha'i Faith, embraced its truth, and openly enlisted as an active\r\nsupporter of its institutions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is stated that in various quarters, and among responsible\r\nsections of the community the matter of the codification and introduction\r\nof a western civil code, and its universal application to all the\r\ndifferent communities is being freely discussed, and its desirability\r\nincreasingly emphasized. As a preliminary measure, however, to the\r\nintroduction of such a far-reaching reform, certain changes of policy have\r\nbeen lately initiated, not in the form of hastily conceived dictatorial\r\nedicts, but as a result of the mature deliberations and with the sanction\r\nof the national representatives of the people. The systematization of the\r\nlaws of marriage and contract; the establishment of a Land Registry wholly\r\nindependent of ecclesiastical control; the distribution of birth\r\ncertificates of a purely undenominational character; the increasing\r\nprominence accorded to the social rights of womanhood; the close attention\r\npaid by State authorities to the education of Persian youth in the\r\nUniversities of Europe; the banning of all Muslim Passion Plays throughout\r\nthe territory of the _Sh_ah: the bold and various schemes that have been\r\nlaunched for the embellishment of the Persian Capital--all are welcome\r\nsigns of the approaching era which is to witness the spiritual and\r\nmaterial ascendency of Persia among the people and nations of the world.\r\n\r\nIn this ever-improving environment and witnessing on every side the\r\ndownfall of those institutions that have crippled their struggling Faith,\r\nthe believers in Persia are joyously seizing every opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate the redeeming power of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. An\r\nilluminating report, submitted by one of the most capable and trusted\r\nitinerant teachers of the Cause in Persia, has lately reached the Holy\r\nLand. In it the writer sets forth in graphic and accurate language the\r\nmany evidences of the increasing vitality displayed by the Faith in\r\ndifferent parts of Persia. Summoned by the Persian National Spiritual\r\nAssembly to interrupt his travels in the vicinity of the town of Ma_sh_had\r\nin order to devote immediate attention to a situation that had\r\nunexpectedly arisen in Isfahan, our indefatigable teacher and brother was\r\nsurprised upon his arrival in that province to note in the various towns\r\nand villages he visited a ten-fold increase in the number of the adherents\r\nof the Faith since his last visit to those regions. He was moreover\r\nstartled at the hospitality which he received at the hands of those\r\npersons who six years ago had been instrumental in expelling him from\r\ntheir localities, and who now had freely enlisted under the banner of\r\nBaha'u'llah. He was furthermore highly elated to learn that the prestige,\r\nthe integrity and ability of the local Baha'i Assemblies in that province\r\nhad of late stood so high that non-Baha'is, exasperated by the corruption\r\nand incompetence of their own judges, had more than once freely submitted\r\ncases of dispute to the judgment of the elected representatives of the\r\nBaha'i community in their locality.\r\n\r\nOnly a close and unbiased observer of the manner and habits of the Persian\r\npeople, already familiar with the prevailing tendencies of different\r\nsections of the population, such as their apathy and indolence, the\r\nabsence of a sense of public duty and of loyalty to principle, the lack of\r\nconcerted effort and constancy in action, the habit of secrecy and blind\r\nsurrender to the capricious will of an ignorant and fanatical clergy, can\r\ntruly estimate the immensity of the task that faces every conscientious\r\nbeliever in that land. He will moreover readily testify to the high\r\nstandard already attained by the Baha'is of Persia in their efforts to\r\ninculcate in the minds of their fellow-countrymen the principles of the\r\nDivine Civilization ushered in by Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nWe have only to glance at the soul-stirring written assurances of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha in order to realize the magnitude and exalted character of\r\nthe mission entrusted by Him to the adherents of the Faith in\r\nBaha'u'llah's native land. By the faithful application of the spiritual\r\nprinciples which their present administration is endeavoring to propagate;\r\nby the character of those indissoluble bonds of Baha'i fellowship that\r\ncement the union of the mass of the believers with their elected\r\ncouncillors; by the distinctiveness of their future contributions in the\r\ndomain of art, of science and of trade, of education and of industry--by\r\nthese and by still other convincing manifestations of the quickening\r\nvitality of their Faith, our Persian brethren are destined to demonstrate\r\nto the ruling powers on earth the majesty, the enduring stability and the\r\nunfailing efficacy of the Government of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from the Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha, revealed more than\r\nthirty years ago, while incarcerated within the walls of the prison-city\r\nof Akka, and addressed to the Baha'is of _Kh_urasan, will undoubtedly\r\nstimulate those energetic friends of the West who long to contribute by\r\nevery means in their power to the rehabilitation of their Master's native\r\nland:--\r\n\r\n\"Erelong will your brethren from Europe and America journey to Persia.\r\nThere they will promote to an unprecedented degree the interests of art\r\nand industry. There they will rear the institutions of true civilization,\r\npromote the development of husbandry and trade, and assist in the spread\r\nof education.... Assuredly they will come; assuredly they will contribute\r\nin making of the land of Iran the envy and the admiration of the peoples\r\nand nations of the world.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as we ponder these words of 'Abdu'l-Baha in our hearts, let us also\r\nremember the prophetic utterances of Baha'u'llah, which reveal not only\r\nthe merciless cruelty of the ecclesiastical leaders of Islam but also the\r\nmeasure of Divine retribution which now afflicts the oppressors of God's\r\nholy Faith:--\r\n\r\n\"O people of the Qur'an! Verily the prophet of God, Muhammad, sheddeth\r\ntears at the sight of your cruelty. Ye have assuredly followed your evil\r\nand corrupt desires and turned away your face from the light of guidance.\r\nErelong will ye witness the result of your deeds; for the Lord My God\r\nlieth in wait and is watchful of your behavior.... Erelong He will raise\r\nin every city the standard of His sovereignty, and will wipe away the\r\ntraces of them that have denied Him on the day of His return.... O\r\nconcourse of Muslim divines! By your deeds the exalted station of the\r\nnation hath been abased, the standard of Islam hath been reversed and its\r\nmighty throne hath fallen. Whenever the Divine Reformer has sought to\r\nennoble the rank of the people, ye have tumultuously risen against Him and\r\nprevented Him from executing His purpose, wherefore the realm hath\r\nremained in grievous loss.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in conclusion, I wish, in a few words, to pay a tribute, however\r\ninadequate, to the magnificent services rendered by that exemplary and\r\nindefatigable teacher of the Cause, our dearly-beloved sister, Miss Martha\r\nRoot. Her international travels on behalf of the Baha'i Faith, so wide in\r\ntheir range, so extensive in their duration, so inspiring in their\r\nresults, will adorn and enrich the annals of God's immortal Faith. Her\r\nearliest journeys to the southernmost limits of the American continent, to\r\nIndia and to South Africa, to the eastern confines of Asia, to the islands\r\nof the Southern Seas and the Scandinavian countries of the North; her more\r\nrecent contact with the rulers and crowned heads of Europe and the\r\nimpression which her undaunted spirit created in royal circles in the\r\nBalkan countries; her close affiliation with international organizations,\r\npeace societies, humanitarian movements and Esperantist circles; and her\r\nlatest victories in the university circles of Germany--all constitute a\r\ncompelling evidence of what the power of Baha'u'llah can achieve. These\r\nhistoric labors, pursued single-handed and in circumstances of financial\r\nstringency and ill-health, have been characterized throughout by a spirit\r\nof fidelity, of self-effacement, of thoroughness and vigor that none has\r\nexcelled.\r\n\r\nI appeal to individual believers and Baha'i Assemblies alike to reinforce\r\nby every possible means the earnest strivings of such a precious soul, to\r\nrespond speedily and entirely to every request that from time to time she\r\nfeels moved to address to her fellow-workers in every land, to strive to\r\nattain the high standard of stewardship that she has set, and to pray from\r\nthe very depths of their hearts for the uninterrupted continuance of her\r\nnoble endeavors.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nFebruary 12, 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of March 20, 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:\r\n\r\nWith a heart overflowing with thankfulness and joy I take my pen to share\r\nwith you tidings that eloquently testify to the triumphant majesty and\r\nunconquerable spirit of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. From Geneva, the seat of\r\nthe League of Nations, there comes the news that the fervent plea\r\naddressed by the Baha'is of 'Iraq to the world's supreme Tribunal\r\nregarding an issue that for a time has stirred the Baha'i world to its\r\nfoundation has at last met with a noble and most gratifying response.\r\n\r\nYou will recall the references made in my previous communications, dated\r\nNovember 6, 1925, October 29, 1926, and January 1, 1929, to the forcible\r\nseizure of Baha'u'llah's sacred house by the _Sh_i'ah of Ba_gh_dad, to the\r\nappeals which from almost every quarter of the globe have showered upon\r\nthe authorities of 'Iraq for its restitution, to the long and unsuccessful\r\nlegal proceedings to which the representatives of the Faith in that land\r\nhave resorted, and lastly to the petition which they have addressed to the\r\nLeague's Permanent Mandates Commission setting forth the history of the\r\ncase and appealing for the intervention of the Council in their behalf. I\r\nam now informed that after mature deliberation the conclusion arrived at\r\nby the Mandates Commission, urging that prompt action be taken to redress\r\nthe wrong suffered by the Baha'is, has been duly communicated to, and\r\nadopted by, the Council of the League, which in turn will formally\r\ncommunicate the recommendations of its Commission to the Mandatory Power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecision of League of Nations\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the official text of the minutes of the meeting of the Mandates\r\nCommission, as well as from its authorized report to the Council, both of\r\nwhich have been made public, it is clear and evident that the terms of the\r\nconclusion arrived at are neither vague nor evasive, but set forth in\r\nunmistakable language the legitimate aspirations of an oppressed and\r\nstruggling Faith. The decision neither implies compensation to the Baha'i\r\nCommunity for the loss of the sacred buildings, nor does it expressly\r\nprovide for the expropriation of the property by the State. To quote from\r\nthe text of the official document, the Commission has resolved \"to\r\nrecommend the Council to ask the British Government to call upon the\r\nGovernment of 'Iraq to redress without delay the denial of justice from\r\nwhich the petitioners have suffered.\"\r\n\r\nA glance at the minutes of the Commission's meeting will suffice to reveal\r\nthat in the course of the lengthy discussions conducted by the members of\r\nthe Commission the following important facts have been stressed and\r\nrecognized. The British accredited representative, present at the sessions\r\nof the Commission, has declared that \"it was a fact that the Mandatory\r\nPower had recognized that the Baha'is had suffered an injustice and, ever\r\nsince the award made by the High Court, the High Commissioner had been\r\nconsidering what means could be found to remove, either by an executive\r\nact or otherwise, the unjust effects of that decision.\" Moreover, it has\r\nbeen acknowledged by the accredited representative that the Baha'is had\r\nbeen in bonafide occupancy of the property, that they had expended on it\r\nsums that exceeded the value of the site itself, and were thus, in\r\naccordance with the provision in the still operative Turkish Law, entitled\r\nto purchase the site. Allusion has also been made in the course of the\r\ndeliberations of the members of the Commission to the fact that the action\r\nof the _Sh_i'ah community with respect to Baha'u'llah's sacred house\r\nconstituted a breach of the Constitution and the Organic Law of 'Iraq\r\nwhich, according to the testimony of the British accredited\r\nrepresentative, expressly provided for the unfettered freedom of\r\nconscience. A question from one of the members had even elicited from the\r\nrepresentative of the British Government the reply assuring the Commission\r\nthat the Mandatory Power actually possessed means of exercising pressure\r\non the authorities in order, if necessary, to insure that so fundamental\r\nan article in the Constitution would be respected. Furthermore, the\r\nopinion has been strongly expressed that the matter had assumed an\r\n\"importance which exceeded that of the individual case of the Baha'is,\"\r\ninasmuch as \"the judgment of the High Court was suspected of having been\r\ninspired by political prejudice,\" with the consequent impression on the\r\nCommission that \"from a moral point of view, conditions in 'Iraq were not\r\nimproving; that religious passions still ran high and that peace had not\r\nyet been brought about between the various religious communities.\" It has\r\neven been proposed to supplement the report submitted to the Council with\r\nthe observation that, in the opinion of the Commission, \"a country in\r\nwhich the Sovereign and the highest law courts are capable of so flagrant\r\na denial of justice would probably not be considered to be eligible to\r\nbecome a Member of the League of Nations.\" The minutes of the Commission's\r\nmeeting further indicate that the contents of the letter addressed by the\r\nPrime Minister of 'Iraq to the British representative in Ba_gh_dad and\r\nwhich accompanied the text of the petition of the Baha'is do not in the\r\nopinion of the Commission \"meet any of the allegations of the petitioners\"\r\nand are confined to a mere assertion that the judgment of the Court of\r\nAppeal was pronounced in accordance with the laws of the land. As to the\r\nmemorandum submitted by the Mandatory Power in connection with the Baha'i\r\npetition, and to which the minutes briefly refer, it is expressly stated\r\nthat His Britannic Majesty's Government considers the ejectment of the\r\nBaha'is while the case was still undecided to have been an illegal action,\r\nthat the reasons adduced to justify such action were hardly admissible,\r\nand that the final verdict of the Court of Appeal is unsustainable,\r\ncontrary to the law, and tainted by political considerations. The minutes\r\nfurther declare that although any petition presented to the Commission\r\nappealing from a decision given by a Court of Law is to be considered as\r\nnot being in order, yet as the petition submitted by the Baha'is reveals\r\nsuch a state of partiality, servility and sectarianism it has been found\r\ndesirable to depart from the general rule and to regard the petition in\r\nquestion as receivable by the Commission. And among the concluding\r\nobservations in the minutes of the Commission's meeting regarding the\r\nBaha'i petition is this significant passage: \"The revelations made in\r\nconnection with this petition show the present position in 'Iraq in an\r\nunfavorable light. In a country where the conduct of the highest\r\nauthorities has led the Mandatory Power to pass such severe criticisms,\r\nwhere the Supreme Court of Justice is under legitimate suspicion, and\r\nwhere religious fanaticism pursues minorities and controls power, a state\r\nof affairs prevails which is not calculated to insure the development and\r\nwell-being of the inhabitants. The petitioners have suffered a serious\r\ndenial of justice the direct responsibility for which rests on the\r\nauthorities of 'Iraq. The fact that this denial of justice could not be\r\nprevented or immediately made good was due to the weakening of the\r\nMandatory Power's control in 'Iraq. The Mandatory attempted, but in vain,\r\nto redress the injury done to the petitioners by using the means of\r\ninfluence at its disposal under the regime set up by the 1922 Treaty\r\nvis-a-vis King Feisal and the 'Iraq Government. These efforts would not\r\nappear to correspond fully to the engagements resulting from the British\r\nGovernment's declaration, which was approved by the Council on September\r\n27, 1924, and renewed by the British Government in 1926, whereby the\r\nTreaty of Alliance between the British Government and 'Iraq 'was to insure\r\nthe complete observance and execution in 'Iraq of the principles which the\r\nacceptance of the mandate was intended to secure.'\"\r\n\r\nThis grave censure pronounced by the Mandates Commission of the League of\r\nNations on the administration of justice and the general conduct of\r\naffairs in 'Iraq, as well as the association of the humiliation afflicting\r\nBaha'u'llah's sacred dwelling-place with the obligations implied in the\r\nTreaty of Alliance binding the Governments of Great Britain and 'Iraq, not\r\nonly proclaim to the world the enhanced prestige of that hallowed and\r\nconsecrated spot, but testify as well to the high sense of integrity that\r\nanimates the members of the League's honored Commission in the discharge\r\nof their public duties. In their formal reply to the Baha'i petitioners,\r\nthe members of the Permanent Mandates Commission have, with the sanction\r\nof the Council of the League of Nations, issued this most satisfactory\r\ndeclamation: \"The Permanent Mandates Commission, recognizing the justice\r\nof the complaint made by the Baha'i Spiritual Assembly of Ba_gh_dad, has\r\nrecommended to the Council of the League such action as it thinks proper\r\nto redress the wrong suffered by the petitioners.\" A similar passage\r\ninserted in the report of the Finnish Representative to the Council of the\r\nLeague runs as follows: \"The Commission has also considered a petition\r\nfrom the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of 'Iraq, a community\r\nwhich has been dispossessed of its property by another community and has\r\nbeen unable to recover it by legal means. The Commission is convinced that\r\nthis situation, which is described as an injustice, must be attributed\r\nsolely to religious passion, and it asks that the petitioner's wrongs\r\nshould be redressed. I venture to suggest that the Council should accept\r\nthe Mandate Commission's conclusions on this case, which is an example of\r\nthe difficulties to be met with in the development of a young country.\"\r\nThis report, together with the joint observations and conclusions of the\r\nCommission, have been duly considered and approved by the Council of the\r\nLeague, which has in turn instructed the Secretary-General to bring to the\r\nnotice of the Mandatory Power, as well as the petitioners concerned, the\r\nconclusions arrived at by the Mandates Commission.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved co-workers! Much has been achieved thus far in the course\r\nof the progress of this complicated, delicate and highly significant\r\nissue. The Baha'i world is eagerly expectant, and fervently prays, that\r\nthe Almighty may graciously assist the Government chiefly responsible for\r\nthe well-being of 'Iraq to take \"without delay\" such steps as will insure\r\nthe execution of the considered judgment of the representatives of the\r\nSovereign States, members of the Council, and signatories of the Covenant,\r\nof the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nI will, if deemed proper and advisable, inform you of the manner in which\r\nthe admiration and the gratitude of the National Spiritual Assemblies,\r\nrepresentative of the divers communities in the Baha'i world, should be\r\nexpressed and tendered to the authorities of the League of Nations who\r\nhave been chiefly responsible for this noble, this epoch-making decision.\r\nFor none can doubt that the published verdict pronounced by the Mandate\r\nCommission sets the seal of international sanction on the triumph of God's\r\npersecuted Faith over the ecclesiastical and civil powers of hostile\r\nIslam. Within the ranks of the orthodox Sunnis and of the bitter and\r\nfanatical _Sh_i'ah, the chief sects of the Muslim Faith and constituting\r\nrespectively the bulk of the ruling class and the population of 'Iraq, a\r\nfeeling of consternation must necessarily prevail. For however obscured\r\ntheir vision they still can recognize in this historic judgment the herald\r\nof that complete victory which is destined to establish the ascendancy of\r\nwhat, in the words of the members of the Commission, is but \"a small\r\nminority, drawn from a lower social grade, and possessing neither\r\npolitical nor social influence,\" over the combined forces of the Islamic\r\npopulation of 'Iraq.\r\n\r\nI must not fail in conclusion to refer once again to the decisive role\r\nplayed by that distinguished and international champion of the Faith of\r\nBaha'u'llah, our dearly-beloved Mountfort Mills, in the negotiations that\r\nhave paved the way for the signal success already achieved. The text of\r\nthe Baha'i petition, which he conceived and drafted, has been recognized\r\nby the members of the Mandates Commission as \"a document well-drafted,\r\nclear in its argument and moderate in tone.\" He has truly acquitted\r\nhimself in this most sacred task with exemplary distinction and proved\r\nhimself worthy of so noble a mission. I request you to join with me in my\r\nprayers for him, that the Spirit of Baha'u'llah may continue to guide and\r\nsustain him in the final settlement of this most mighty issue.\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nMarch 20, 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of October 25, 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\nMy well-beloved friends:\r\n\r\nEver since that remarkable manifestation of Baha'i solidarity and\r\nself-sacrifice which has signalized the proceedings of last year's\r\nmemorable Convention, I have been expectantly awaiting the news of a\r\nsteady and continuous support of the Plan which can alone insure, ere the\r\npresent year draws to its close, the resumption of building operations on\r\nour beloved Temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGift from Tomb of Baha'u'llah\r\n\r\n\r\nMoved by an impulse that I could not resist, I have felt impelled to\r\nforego what may be regarded as the most valuable and sacred possession in\r\nthe Holy Land for the furthering of that noble enterprise which you have\r\nset your hearts to achieve. With the hearty concurrence of our dear Baha'i\r\nbrother, Ziaoullah Asgarzadeh, who years ago donated it to the Most Holy\r\nShrine, this precious ornament of the Tomb of Baha'u'llah has been already\r\nshipped to your shores, with our fondest hope that the proceeds from its\r\nsale may at once ennoble and reinforce the unnumbered offerings of the\r\nAmerican believers already accumulated on the altar of Baha'i sacrifice. I\r\nhave longed ever since to witness such evidences of spontaneous and\r\ngenerous response on your part as would tend to fortify within me a\r\nconfidence that has never wavered in the inexhaustible vitality of the\r\nFaith of Baha'u'llah in that land.\r\n\r\nI need not stress at this moment the high hopes which so startling a\r\ndisplay of unsparing devotion to our sacred Temple has already aroused in\r\nthe breasts of the multitude of our brethren throughout the East. Nor is\r\nit I feel necessary to impress upon those who are primarily concerned with\r\nits erection the gradual change of outlook which the early prospect of the\r\nconstruction of the far-famed Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in America has\r\nunmistakably occasioned in high places among the hitherto sceptical and\r\nindifferent towards the merits and the practicability of the Faith\r\nproclaimed by Baha'u'llah. Neither do I need to expatiate upon the hopes\r\nand fears of the Greatest Holy Leaf, now in the evening of her life, with\r\ndeepening shadows caused by failing eye-sight and declining strength\r\nswiftly gathering about her, yearning to hear as the one remaining solace\r\nin her swiftly ebbing life the news of the resumption of work on an\r\nEdifice, the glories of which she has, from the lips of 'Abdu'l-Baha,\r\nHimself, learned to admire. I cannot surely overrate at the present\r\njuncture in the progress of our task the challenging character of these\r\nremaining months of the year as a swiftly passing opportunity which it is\r\nin our power to seize and utilize, ere it is too late, for the edification\r\nof our expectant brethren throughout the East, for the vindication in the\r\neyes of the world at large of the realities of our Faith, and last but not\r\nleast for the realization of what is the Greatest Holy Leaf's fondest\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nAs I have already intimated in the course of my conversations with\r\nvisiting pilgrims, so vast and significant an enterprise as the\r\nconstruction of the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of the West should be\r\nsupported, not by the munificence of a few but by the joint contributions\r\nof the entire mass of the convinced followers of the Faith. It cannot be\r\ndenied that the emanations of spiritual power and inspiration destined to\r\nradiate from the central Edifice of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar will to a\r\nvery large extent depend upon the range and variety of the contributing\r\nbelievers, as well as upon the nature and degree of self-abnegation which\r\ntheir unsolicited offerings will entail. Moreover, we should, I feel,\r\nregard it as an axiom and guiding principle of Baha'i administration that\r\nin the conduct of every specific Baha'i activity, as different from\r\nundertakings of a humanitarian, philanthropic or charitable character,\r\nwhich may in future be conducted under Baha'i auspices, only those who\r\nhave already identified themselves with the Faith and are regarded as its\r\navowed and unreserved supporters should be invited to join and\r\ncollaborate. For apart from the consideration of embarrassing\r\ncomplications which the association of non-believers in the financing of\r\ninstitutions of a strictly Baha'i character may conceivably engender in\r\nthe administration of the Baha'i community of the future, it should be\r\nremembered that these specific Baha'i institutions, which should be viewed\r\nin the light of Baha'u'llah's gifts bestowed upon the world, can best\r\nfunction and most powerfully exert their influence in the world only if\r\nreared and maintained solely by the support of those who are fully\r\nconscious of, and are unreservedly submissive to, the claims inherent in\r\nthe Revelation of Baha'u'llah. In cases, however, when a friend or\r\nsympathizer of the Faith eagerly insists on a monetary contribution for\r\nthe promotion of the Faith, such gifts should be accepted and duly\r\nacknowledged by the elected representatives of the believers with the\r\nexpress understanding that they would be utilized by them only to\r\nreinforce that section of the Baha'i Fund exclusively devoted to\r\nphilanthropic or charitable purposes. For, as the Faith of Baha'u'llah\r\nextends in scope and in influence, and the resources of Baha'i communities\r\ncorrespondingly multiply, it will become increasingly desirable to\r\ndifferentiate between such departments of the Baha'i treasury as minister\r\nto the needs of the world at large, and those that are specifically\r\ndesigned to promote the direct interests of the Faith itself. From this\r\napparent divorce between Baha'i and humanitarian activities it must not,\r\nhowever, be inferred that the animating purpose of the Faith of\r\nBaha'u'llah stands at variance with the aims and objects of the\r\nhumanitarian and philanthropic institutions of the day. Nay, it should be\r\nrealized by every judicious promoter of the Faith that at such an early\r\nstage in the evolution and crystallization of the Cause such\r\ndiscriminating and precautionary measures are inevitable and even\r\nnecessary if the nascent institutions of the Faith are to emerge\r\ntriumphant and unimpaired from the present welter of confused and often\r\nconflicting interests with which they are surrounded. This note of warning\r\nmay not be thought inappropriate at a time when, inflamed by a consuming\r\npassion to witness the early completion of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, we\r\nmay not only be apt to acquiesce in the desire of those who, as yet\r\nuninitiated into the Cause, are willing to lend financial assistance to\r\nits institutions, but may even feel inclined to solicit from them such aid\r\nas it is in their power to render. Ours surely is the paramount duty so to\r\nacquit ourselves in the discharge of our most sacred task that in the days\r\nto come neither the tongue of the slanderer nor the pen of the malevolent\r\nmay dare to insinuate that so beauteous, so significant an Edifice has\r\nbeen reared by anything short of the unanimous, the exclusive, and the\r\nself-sacrificing strivings of the small yet determined body of the\r\nconvinced supporters of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. How delicate our task,\r\nhow pressing the responsibility that weighs upon us, who are called upon\r\non one hand to preserve inviolate the integrity and the identity of the\r\nregenerating Faith of Baha'u'llah, and to vindicate on the other its\r\nbroad, its humanitarian, its all-embracing principles!\r\n\r\nTrue, we cannot fail to realize at the present stage of our work the\r\nextremely limited number of contributors qualified to lend financial\r\nsupport to such a vast, such an elaborate and costly enterprise. We are\r\nfully aware of the many issues and varied Baha'i activities that are\r\nunavoidably held in abeyance pending the successful conclusion of the Plan\r\nof Unified Action. We are only too conscious of the pressing need of some\r\nsort of befitting and concrete embodiment of the spirit animating the\r\nCause that would stand in the heart of the American Continent both as a\r\nwitness and as a rallying center to the manifold activities of a fast\r\ngrowing Faith. But spurred by those reflections may we not bestir\r\nourselves and resolve as we have never resolved before to hasten by every\r\nmeans in our power the consummation of this all-absorbing yet so\r\nmeritorious a task? I beseech you, dear friends, not to allow\r\nconsiderations of numbers, or the consciousness of the limitations of our\r\nresources, or even the experience of inevitable setbacks which every\r\nmighty undertaking is bound to encounter, to blur your vision, to dim your\r\nhopes, or to paralyze your efforts in the prosecution of your divinely\r\nappointed task. Neither, do I entreat you, to suffer the least deviation\r\ninto the paths of expediency and compromise to obstruct those channels of\r\nvivifying grace that can alone provide the inspiration and strength vital\r\nnot only to the successful conduct of its material construction, but to\r\nthe fulfilment of its high destiny.\r\n\r\nAnd while we bend our efforts and strain our nerves in a feverish pursuit\r\nto provide the necessary means for the speedy construction of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, may we not pause for a moment to examine those\r\nstatements which set forth the purpose as well as the functions of this\r\nsymbolical yet so spiritually potent Edifice? It will be readily admitted\r\nthat at a time when the tenets of a Faith, not yet fully emerged from the\r\nfires of repression, are as yet improperly defined and imperfectly\r\nunderstood, the utmost caution should be exercised in revealing the true\r\nnature of those institutions which are indissolubly associated with its\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurpose of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout attempting an exhaustive survey of the distinguishing features and\r\npurpose of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, I should feel content at the present\r\ntime to draw your attention to what I regard certain misleading statements\r\nthat have found currency in various quarters, and which may lead gradually\r\nto a grave misapprehension of the true purpose and essential character of\r\nthe Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the central Edifice of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, round which in the fulness of time shall cluster\r\nsuch institutions of social service as shall afford relief to the\r\nsuffering, sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the\r\nbereaved, and education to the ignorant, should be regarded apart from\r\nthese Dependencies, as a House solely designed and entirely dedicated to\r\nthe worship of God in accordance with the few yet definitely prescribed\r\nprinciples established by Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. It should not\r\nbe inferred, however, from this general statement that the interior of the\r\ncentral Edifice itself will be converted into a conglomeration of\r\nreligious services conducted along lines associated with the traditional\r\nprocedure obtaining in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other temples of\r\nworship. Its various avenues of approach, all converging towards the\r\ncentral Hall beneath its dome, will not serve as admittance to those\r\nsectarian adherents of rigid formulae and man-made creeds, each bent,\r\naccording to his way, to observe his rites, recite his prayers, perform\r\nhis ablutions, and display the particular symbols of his faith, within\r\nseparately defined sections of Baha'u'llah's Universal House of Worship.\r\nFar from the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar offering such a spectacle of incoherent\r\nand confused sectarian observances and rites, a condition wholly\r\nincompatible with the provisions of the Aqdas and irreconcilable with the\r\nspirit it inculcates, the central House of Baha'i worship, enshrined\r\nwithin the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, will gather within its chastened walls,\r\nin a serenely spiritual atmosphere, only those who, discarding forever the\r\ntrappings of elaborate and ostentatious ceremony, are willing worshipers\r\nof the one true God, as manifested in this age in the Person of\r\nBaha'u'llah. To them will the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar symbolize the\r\nfundamental verity underlying the Baha'i Faith, that religious truth is\r\nnot absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is not final but\r\nprogressive. Theirs will be the conviction that an all-loving and\r\never-watchful Father Who, in the past, and at various stages in the\r\nevolution of mankind, has sent forth His Prophets as the Bearers of His\r\nMessage and the Manifestations of His Light to mankind, cannot at this\r\ncritical period of their civilization withhold from His children the\r\nGuidance which they sorely need amid the darkness which has beset them,\r\nand which neither the light of science nor that of human intellect and\r\nwisdom can succeed in dissipating. And thus having recognized in\r\nBaha'u'llah the source whence this celestial light proceeds, they will\r\nirresistibly feel attracted to seek the shelter of His House, and\r\ncongregate therein, unhampered by ceremonials and unfettered by creed, to\r\nrender homage to the one true God, the Essence and Orb of eternal Truth,\r\nand to exalt and magnify the name of His Messengers and Prophets Who, from\r\ntime immemorial even unto our day, have, under divers circumstances and in\r\nvarying measure, mirrored forth to a dark and wayward world the light of\r\nheavenly Guidance.\r\n\r\nBut however inspiring the conception of Baha'i worship, as witnessed in\r\nthe central Edifice of this exalted Temple, it cannot be regarded as the\r\nsole, nor even the essential, factor in the part which the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, as designed by Baha'u'llah, is destined to play in\r\nthe organic life of the Baha'i community. Divorced from the social,\r\nhumanitarian, educational and scientific pursuits centering around the\r\nDependencies of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, Baha'i worship, however exalted\r\nin its conception, however passionate in fervor, can never hope to achieve\r\nbeyond the meagre and often transitory results produced by the\r\ncontemplations of the ascetic or the communion of the passive worshiper.\r\nIt cannot afford lasting satisfaction and benefit to the worshiper\r\nhimself, much less to humanity in general, unless and until translated and\r\ntransfused into that dynamic and disinterested service to the cause of\r\nhumanity which it is the supreme privilege of the Dependencies of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar to facilitate and promote. Nor will the exertions,\r\nno matter how disinterested and strenuous, of those who within the\r\nprecincts of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar will be engaged in administering\r\nthe affairs of the future Baha'i Commonwealth, fructify and prosper unless\r\nthey are brought into close and daily communion with those spiritual\r\nagencies centering in and radiating from the central Shrine of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar. Nothing short of direct and constant interaction\r\nbetween the spiritual forces emanating from this House of Worship\r\ncentering in the heart of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, and the energies\r\nconsciously displayed by those who administer its affairs in their service\r\nto humanity can possibly provide the necessary agency capable of removing\r\nthe ills that have so long and so grievously afflicted humanity. For it is\r\nassuredly upon the consciousness of the efficacy of the Revelation of\r\nBaha'u'llah, reinforced on one hand by spiritual communion with His\r\nSpirit, and on the other by the intelligent application and the faithful\r\nexecution of the principles and laws He revealed, that the salvation of a\r\nworld in travail must ultimately depend. And of all the institutions that\r\nstand associated with His Holy Name, surely none save the institution of\r\nthe Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar can most adequately provide the essentials of\r\nBaha'i worship and service, both so vital to the regeneration of the\r\nworld. Therein lies the secret of the loftiness, of the potency, of the\r\nunique position of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar as one of the outstanding\r\ninstitutions conceived by Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved friends! May we not as the trustees of so priceless a\r\nheritage, arise to fulfill our high destiny?\r\n\r\nYour true brother,\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine,\r\nOctober 25, 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of July 17, 1932.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the United\r\nStates and Canada.\r\n\r\nBrethren and fellow-mourners in the Faith of Baha'u'llah:\r\n\r\nA sorrow, reminiscent in its poignancy, of the devastating grief caused by\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's sudden removal from our midst, has stirred the Baha'i world\r\nto its foundations. The Greatest Holy Leaf, the well-beloved and treasured\r\nRemnant of Baha'u'llah entrusted to our frail and unworthy hands by our\r\ndeparted Master, has passed to the Great Beyond, leaving a legacy that\r\ntime can never dim.\r\n\r\nThe community of the Most Great Name, in its entirety and to its very\r\ncore, feels the sting of this cruel loss. Inevitable though this\r\ncalamitous event appeared to us all, however acute our apprehensions of\r\nits steady approach, the consciousness of its final consummation at this\r\nterrible hour leaves us, we whose souls have been impregnated by the\r\nenergizing influence of her love, prostrated and disconsolate.\r\n\r\nHow can my lonely pen, so utterly inadequate to glorify so exalted a\r\nstation, so impotent to portray the experiences of so sublime a life, so\r\ndisqualified to recount the blessings she showered upon me since my\r\nearliest childhood--how can such a pen repay the great debt of gratitude\r\nand love that I owe her whom I regarded as my chief sustainer, my most\r\naffectionate comforter, the joy and inspiration of my life? My grief is\r\ntoo immense, my remorse too profound, to be able to give full vent at this\r\nmoment to the feelings that surge within me.\r\n\r\nOnly future generations and pens abler than mine can, and will, pay a\r\nworthy tribute to the towering grandeur of her spiritual life, to the\r\nunique part she played throughout the tumultuous stages of Baha'i history,\r\nto the expressions of unqualified praise that have streamed from the pen\r\nof both Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Center of His covenant, though\r\nunrecorded, and in the main unsuspected by the mass of her passionate\r\nadmirers in East and West, the share she has had in influencing the course\r\nof some of the chief events in the annals of the Faith, the sufferings she\r\nbore, the sacrifices she made, the rare gifts of unfailing sympathy she so\r\nstrikingly displayed--these, and many others stand so inextricably\r\ninterwoven with the fabric of the Cause itself that no future historian of\r\nthe Faith of Baha'u'llah can afford to ignore or minimize.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the concluding stages of the heroic age of the Cause, which\r\nwitnessed the imprisonment of Baha'u'llah in the Siyah-_Ch_al of Tihran,\r\nthe Greatest Holy Leaf, then still in her infancy, was privileged to taste\r\nof the cup of woe which the first believers of that apostolic age had\r\nquaffed.\r\n\r\nHow well I remember her recall, at a time when her faculties were still\r\nunimpaired, the gnawing suspense that ate into the hearts of those who\r\nwatched by her side, at the threshold of her pillaged house, expectant to\r\nhear at any moment the news of Baha'u'llah's imminent execution! In those\r\nsinister hours, she often recounted, her parents had so suddenly lost\r\ntheir earthly possessions that within the space of a single day from being\r\nthe privileged member of one of the wealthiest families of Tihran she had\r\nsunk to the state of a sufferer from unconcealed poverty. Deprived of the\r\nmeans of subsistence, her illustrious mother, the famed Navvab, was\r\nconstrained to place in the palm of her daughter's hand a handful of flour\r\nand to induce her to accept it as a substitute for her daily bread.\r\n\r\nAnd when at a later time this revered and precious member of the Holy\r\nFamily, then in her teens, came to be entrusted by the guiding hand of her\r\nFather with missions that no girl of her age could, or would be willing\r\nto, perform, with what spontaneous joy she seized her opportunity and\r\nacquitted herself of the task with which she had been entrusted! The\r\ndelicacy and extreme gravity of such functions as she, from time to time,\r\nwas called upon to fulfill, when the city of Ba_gh_dad was swept by the\r\nhurricane which the heedlessness and perversity of Mirza Yahya had\r\nunchained, as well as the tender solicitude which, at so early an age, she\r\nevinced during the period of Baha'u'llah's enforced retirement to the\r\nmountains of Sulaymaniyyih, marked her as one who was both capable of\r\nsharing the burden, and willing to make the sacrifice, which her high\r\nbirth demanded.\r\n\r\nHow staunch was her faith, how calm her demeanor, how forgiving her\r\nattitude, how severe her trials, at a time when the forces of schism had\r\nrent asunder the ties that united the little band of exiles which had\r\nsettled in Adrianople and whose fortunes seemed then to have sunk to their\r\nlowest ebb! It was in this period of extreme anxiety, when the rigors of a\r\nwinter of exceptional severity, coupled with the privations entailed by\r\nunhealthy housing accommodations and dire financial distress, undermined\r\nonce for all her health and sapped the vitality which she had hitherto so\r\nthoroughly enjoyed. The stress and storm of that period made an abiding\r\nimpression upon her mind, and she retained till the time of her death on\r\nher beauteous and angelic face evidences of its intense hardships.\r\n\r\nNot until, however, she had been confined in the company of Baha'u'llah\r\nwithin the walls of the prison-city of Akka did she display, in the\r\nplenitude of her power and in the full abundance of her love for Him, more\r\ngifts that single her out, next to 'Abdu'l-Baha, among the members of the\r\nHoly Family, as the brightest embodiment of that love which is born of God\r\nand of that human sympathy which few mortals are capable of evincing.\r\n\r\nBanishing from her mind and heart every earthly attachment, renouncing the\r\nvery idea of matrimony, she, standing resolutely by the side of a Brother\r\nwhom she was to aid and serve so well, arose to dedicate her life to the\r\nservice of her Father's glorious Cause. Whether in the management of the\r\naffairs of His Household in which she excelled, or in the social\r\nrelationships which she so assiduously cultivated in order to shield both\r\nBaha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, whether in the unfailing attention she paid\r\nto the every day needs of her Father, or in the traits of generosity, of\r\naffability and kindness, which she manifested, the Greatest Holy Leaf had\r\nby that time abundantly demonstrated her worthiness to rank as one of the\r\nnoblest figures intimately associated with the life-long work of\r\nBaha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nHow grievous was the ingratitude, how blind the fanaticism, how persistent\r\nthe malignity of the officials, their wives, and their subordinates, in\r\nreturn for the manifold bounties which she, in close association with her\r\nBrother, so profusely conferred upon them! Her patience, her magnanimity,\r\nher indiscriminating benevolence, far from disarming the hostility of that\r\nperverse generation, served only to inflame their rancour, to excite their\r\njealousy, to intensify their fears. The gloom that had settled upon that\r\nlittle band of imprisoned believers, who languished in the Fortress of\r\nAkka, contrasted with the spirit of confident hope, of deep-rooted\r\noptimism that beamed upon her serene countenance. No calamity, however\r\nintense, could obscure the brightness of her saintly face, and no\r\nagitation, no matter how severe, could disturb the composure of her\r\ngracious and dignified behaviour.\r\n\r\nThat her sensitive heart instantaneously reacted to the slightest injury\r\nthat befell the least significant of creatures, whether friend or foe, no\r\none who knew her well could doubt. And yet such was the restraining power\r\nof her will--a will which her spirit of self-renunciation so often prompted\r\nher to suppress--that a superficial observer might well be led to question\r\nthe intensity of her emotions or to belittle the range of her sympathies.\r\nIn the school of adversity she, already endowed by Providence with the\r\nvirtues of meekness and fortitude, learned through the example and\r\nexhortations of the Great Sufferer, who was her Father, the lesson she was\r\ndestined to teach the great mass of His followers for so long after Him.\r\n\r\nArmed with the powers with which an intimate and long-standing\r\ncompanionship with Baha'u'llah had already equipped her, and benefiting by\r\nthe magnificent example which the steadily widening range of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's activities afforded her, she was prepared to face the storm\r\nwhich the treacherous conduct of the Covenant-breakers had aroused and to\r\nwithstand its most damaging onslaughts.\r\n\r\nGreat as had been her sufferings ever since her infancy, the anguish of\r\nmind and heart which the Ascension of Baha'u'llah occasioned, nerved her,\r\nas never before, to a resolve which no upheaval could bend and which her\r\nfrail constitution belied. Amidst the dust and heat of the commotion which\r\nthat faithless and rebellious company engendered she found herself\r\nconstrained to dissolve ties of family relationship, to sever\r\nlong-standing and intimate friendships, to discard lesser loyalties for\r\nthe sake of her supreme allegiance to a Cause she had loved so dearly and\r\nhad served so well.\r\n\r\nThe disruption that ensued found her ranged by the side of Him Whom her\r\ndeparted Father had appointed as the Center of His Covenant and the\r\nauthorized Expounder of His Word. Her venerated mother, as well as her\r\ndistinguished paternal uncle, Aqay-i-Kalim--the twin pillars who, all\r\nthroughout the various stages of Baha'u'llah's exile from the Land of His\r\nBirth to the final place of His confinement, had demonstrated, unlike most\r\nof the members of His Family, the tenacity of their loyalty--had already\r\npassed behind the Veil. Death, in the most tragic circumstances, had also\r\nrobbed her of the Purest Branch, her only brother besides 'Abdu'l-Baha,\r\nwhile still in the prime of youth. She alone of the family of Baha'u'llah\r\nremained to cheer the heart and reinforce the efforts of the Most Great\r\nBranch, against whom were solidly arrayed the almost entire company of His\r\nfaithless relatives. In her arduous task she was seconded by the diligent\r\nefforts of Munirih _Kh_anum, the Holy Mother, and those of her daughters\r\nwhose age allowed them to assist in the accomplishment of that stupendous\r\nachievement with which the name of 'Abdu'l-Baha will forever remain\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of Baha'u'llah and the fierce onslaught of the forces of\r\ndisruption that followed in its wake, the Greatest Holy Leaf, now in the\r\nhey-day of her life, rose to the height of her great opportunity and\r\nacquitted herself worthily of her task. It would take me beyond the\r\ncompass of the tribute I am moved to pay to her memory were I to dwell\r\nupon the incessant machinations to which Muhammad-'Ali, the arch-breaker\r\nof the Covenant of Baha'u'llah, and his despicable supporters basely\r\nresorted, upon the agitation which their cleverly-directed campaign of\r\nmisrepresentation and calumny produced in quarters directly connected with\r\nSultan 'Abdu'l-Hamid and his advisers, upon the trials and investigations\r\nto which it gave rise, upon the rigidity of the incarceration it\r\nreimposed, and upon the perils it revived. Suffice it to say that but for\r\nher sleepless vigilance, her tact, her courtesy, her extreme patience and\r\nheroic fortitude, grave complications might have ensued and the load of\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's anxious care would have been considerably increased.\r\n\r\nAnd when the storm-cloud that had darkened the horizon of the Holy Land\r\nhad been finally dissipated and the call raised by our beloved\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha had stirred to a new life certain cities of the American and\r\nEuropean continents, the Most Exalted Leaf became the recipient of the\r\nunbounded affection and blessings of One Who could best estimate her\r\nvirtues and appreciate her merits.\r\n\r\nThe decline of her precious life had by that time set in, and the burden\r\nof advancing age was beginning to becloud the radiance of her countenance.\r\nForgetful of her own self, disdaining rest and comfort, and undeterred by\r\nthe obstacles that still stood in her path, she, acting as the honoured\r\nhostess to a steadily increasing number of pilgrims who thronged\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's residence from both the East and the West, continued to\r\ndisplay those same attributes that had won her, in the preceding phases of\r\nher career, so great a measure of admiration and love.\r\n\r\nAnd when, in pursuance of God's inscrutable Wisdom, the ban on\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's confinement was lifted and the Plan which He, in the\r\ndarkest hours of His confinement, had conceived materialized, He with\r\nunhesitating confidence, invested His trusted and honoured sister with the\r\nresponsibility of attending to the multitudinous details arising out of\r\nHis protracted absence from the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had 'Abdu'l-Baha stepped upon the shores of the European and\r\nAmerican continents than our beloved _Kh_anum found herself well-nigh\r\noverwhelmed with thrilling messages, each betokening the irresistible\r\nadvance of the Cause in a manner which, not withstanding the vast range of\r\nher experience, seemed to her almost incredible. The years in which she\r\nbasked in the sunshine of 'Abdu'l-Baha's spiritual victories were,\r\nperhaps, among the brightest and happiest of her life. Little did she\r\ndream when, as a little girl, she was running about, in the courtyard of\r\nher Father's house in Tihran, in the company of Him Whose destiny was to\r\nbe one day the chosen Center of God's indestructible Covenant, that such a\r\nBrother would be capable of achieving, in realms so distant, and among\r\nraces so utterly remote, so great and memorable a victory.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm and joy which swelled in her breast as she greeted\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha on His triumphant return from the West, I will not venture to\r\ndescribe. She was astounded at the vitality of which He had, despite His\r\nunimaginable sufferings, proved Himself capable. She was lost in\r\nadmiration at the magnitude of the forces which His utterances had\r\nreleased. She was filled with thankfulness to Baha'u'llah for having\r\nenabled her to witness the evidences of such brilliant victory for His\r\nCause no less than for His Son.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the Great War gave her yet another opportunity to reveal\r\nthe true worth of her character and to release the latent energies of her\r\nheart. The residence of 'Abdu'l-Baha in Haifa was besieged, all throughout\r\nthat dreary conflict, by a concourse of famished men, women and children\r\nwhom the maladministration, the cruelty and neglect of the officials of\r\nthe Ottoman Government had driven to seek an alleviation to their woes.\r\nFrom the hand of the Greatest Holy Leaf, and out of the abundance of her\r\nheart, these hapless victims of a contemptible tyranny, received day after\r\nday unforgettable evidences of a love they had learned to envy and admire.\r\nHer words of cheer and comfort, the food, the money, the clothing she\r\nfreely dispensed, the remedies which, by a process of her own, she herself\r\nprepared and diligently applied--all these had their share in comforting\r\nthe disconsolate, in restoring sight to the blind, in sheltering the\r\norphan, in healing the sick, and in succoring the homeless and the\r\nwanderer.\r\n\r\nShe had reached, amidst the darkness of the war days, the high water-mark\r\nof her spiritual attainments. Few, if any, among the unnumbered\r\nbenefactors of society whose privilege has been to allay, in various\r\nmeasures, the hardships and sufferings entailed by that Fierce Conflict,\r\ngave as freely and as disinterestedly as she did; few exercised that\r\nundefinable influence upon the beneficiaries of their gifts.\r\n\r\nAge seemed to have accentuated the tenderness of her loving heart, and to\r\nhave widened still further the range of her sympathies. The sight of\r\nappalling suffering around her steeled her energies and revealed such\r\npotentialities that her most intimate associates had failed to suspect.\r\n\r\nThe ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha, so tragic in its suddenness, was to her a\r\nterrific blow, from the effects of which she never completely recovered.\r\nTo her He, whom she called \"Aqa,\" had been a refuge in times of adversity.\r\nOn Him she had been led to place her sole reliance. In Him she had found\r\nample compensation for the bereavements she had suffered, the desertions\r\nshe had witnessed, the ingratitude she had been shown by friends and\r\nkindreds. No one could ever dream that a woman of her age, so frail in\r\nbody, so sensitive of heart, so loaded with the cares of almost eighty\r\nyears of incessant tribulation, could so long survive so shattering a\r\nblow. And yet history, no less than the annals of our immortal Faith,\r\nshall record for her a share in the advancement and consolidation of the\r\nworld-wide community which the hand of 'Abdu'l-Baha had helped to fashion,\r\nwhich no one among the remnants of His Family can rival.\r\n\r\nWhich of the blessings am I to recount, which in her unfailing solicitude\r\nshe showered upon me, in the most critical and agitated hours of my life?\r\nTo me, standing in so dire a need of the vitalizing grace of God, she was\r\nthe living symbol of many an attribute I had learned to admire in\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha. She was to me a continual reminder of His inspiring\r\npersonality, of His calm resignation, of His munificence and magnanimity.\r\nTo me she was an incarnation of His winsome graciousness, of His\r\nall-encompassing tenderness and love.\r\n\r\nIt would take me too long to make even a brief allusion to those incidents\r\nof her life, each of which eloquently proclaims her as a daughter, worthy\r\nto inherit that priceless heritage bequeathed to her by Baha'u'llah. A\r\npurity of life that reflected itself in even the minutest details of her\r\ndaily occupations and activities; a tenderness of heart that obliterated\r\nevery distinction of creed, class and color; a resignation and serenity\r\nthat evoked to the mind the calm and heroic fortitude of the Bab; a\r\nnatural fondness of flowers and children that was so characteristic of\r\nBaha'u'llah; an unaffected simplicity of manners; an extreme sociability\r\nwhich made her accessible to all; a generosity, a love, at once\r\ndisinterested and indiscriminating, that reflected so clearly the\r\nattributes of 'Abdu'l-Baha's character; a sweetness of temper; a\r\ncheerfulness that no amount of sorrow could becloud; a quiet and\r\nunassuming disposition that served to enhance a thousandfold the prestige\r\nof her exalted rank; a forgiving nature that instantly disarmed the most\r\nunyielding enemy--these rank among the outstanding attributes of a saintly\r\nlife which history will acknowledge as having been endowed with a\r\ncelestial potency that few of the heroes of the past possessed.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that in Tablets, which stand as eternal testimonies to the\r\nbeauty of her character, Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha have paid touching\r\ntributes to those things that testify to her exalted position among the\r\nmembers of their Family, that proclaim her as an example to their\r\nfollowers, and as an object worthy of the admiration of all mankind.\r\n\r\nI need only, at this juncture, quote the following passage from a Tablet\r\naddressed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the Holy Mother, the tone of which reveals\r\nunmistakably the character of those ties that bound Him to so precious, so\r\ndevoted a sister:\r\n\r\n\"To my honored and distinguished sister do thou convey the expression of\r\nmy heartfelt, my intense longing. Day and night she liveth in my\r\nremembrance. I dare make no mention of the feelings which separation from\r\nher has aroused in my heart, for whatever I should attempt to express in\r\nwriting will assuredly be effaced by the tears which such sentiments must\r\nbring to my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nDearly-beloved Greatest Holy Leaf! Through the mist of tears that fill my\r\neyes I can clearly see, as I pen these lines, thy noble figure before me,\r\nand can recognize the serenity of thy kindly face. I can still gaze,\r\nthough the shadow of the grave separate us, into thy blue, love-deep eyes,\r\nand can feel, in its calm intensity, the immense love thou didst bear for\r\nthe Cause of thine Almighty Father, the attachment that bound thee to the\r\nmost lowly and insignificant among its followers, the warm affection thou\r\ndidst cherish for me in thine heart. The memory of the ineffable beauty of\r\nthy smile shall ever continue to cheer and hearten me in the thorny path I\r\nam destined to pursue. The remembrance of the touch of thine hand shall\r\nspur me on to follow steadfastly in thy way. The sweet magic of thy voice\r\nshall remind me, when the hour of adversity is at its darkest, to hold\r\nfast to the rope thou didst seize so firmly all the days of thy life.\r\n\r\nBear thou this my message to 'Abdu'l-Baha, thine exalted and\r\ndivinely-appointed Brother: If the Cause for which Baha'u'llah toiled and\r\nlabored, for which Thou didst suffer years of agonizing sorrow, for the\r\nsake of which streams of sacred blood have flowed, should, in the days to\r\ncome, encounter storms more severe than those it has already weathered, do\r\nThou continue to overshadow, with Thine all-encompassing care and wisdom,\r\nThy frail, Thy unworthy appointed child.\r\n\r\nIntercede, O noble and well-favoured scion of a heavenly Father, for me no\r\nless than for the toiling masses of Thy ardent lovers, who have sworn\r\nundying allegiance to Thy memory, whose souls have been nourished by the\r\nenergies of Thy love, whose conduct has been moulded by the inspiring\r\nexample of Thy life, and whose imaginations are fired by the imperishable\r\nevidences of Thy lively faith, Thy unshakable constancy, Thy invincible\r\nheroism, Thy great renunciation.\r\n\r\nWhatever betide us, however distressing the vicissitudes which the nascent\r\nFaith of God may yet experience, we pledge ourselves, before the\r\nmercy-seat of thy glorious Father, to hand on, unimpaired and undivided,\r\nto generations yet unborn, the glory of that tradition of which thou hast\r\nbeen its most brilliant exemplar.\r\n\r\nIn the innermost recesses of our hearts, O thou exalted Leaf of the Abha\r\nParadise, we have reared for thee a shining mansion that the hand of time\r\ncan never undermine, a shrine which shall frame eternally the matchless\r\nbeauty of thy countenance, an altar whereon the fire of thy consuming love\r\nshall burn forever.\r\n\r\nSHOGHI.\r\n\r\nHaifa, Palestine.\r\nJuly 17, 1932.\r\n\r\n[Editorial Note: Messages on the following pages, added to the 1968\r\nedition of Baha'i Administration, are also contained in Messages to\r\nAmerica, 1932-1946.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 Descendants (feminine) of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n    2 Bahiyyih, sister of 'Abdu'l-Baha.\r\n\r\n    3 Published in the booklet \"Prayer of Baha'u'llah: Prayers and Tablets\r\n      of 'Abdu'l-Baha.\"\r\n\r\n    4 These translations, with others received later, were published as a\r\n      pamphlet by the N.S.A.\r\n\r\n    5 Published in the booklet \"Prayer of Baha'u'llah: Prayers and Tablets\r\n      of 'Abdu'l-Baha.\"\r\n\r\n    6 The complete list of terms is to be found in Baha'i World, volume\r\n      VII.\r\n\r\n    7 See previous footnote on transliterations.\r\n\r\n    8 Published in \"The Star of the West\" during the year 1923.\r\n\r\n    9 Published in the Baha'i Magazine, Star of the West.\r\n\r\n   10 Baha'i Scriptures, New York, 1923; replaced by Baha'i World Faith,\r\n      1943.\r\n\r\n   11 Published in \"The Star of the West.\"\r\n\r\n   12 Baha'u'llah and the New Era, by J.
