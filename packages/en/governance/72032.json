This is the usual entrance to\r\nthe Forbidden City for officials attending audience when the Court is\r\nthere resident. (It was here that was suspended in a basket the head of\r\nthe foreigner captured by the Boxers on 20th June.)\r\n\r\n(2) Huang Chi Tien, or Throne Hall of Imperial Supremacy. In this Hall\r\nthe Empress Dowager, after the return of the Court from exile, was\r\naccustomed to receive her officials in audience on the rare occasions\r\nwhen she lived in the Forbidden City. It was here that her remains lay\r\nfor nearly a year awaiting the day of burial.\r\n\r\n(3) Ning Shou Kung, or Palace of Peaceful Longevity. Here the Old Buddha\r\nresided during the siege; here she buried her treasure. She returned\r\nhither after the days of exile and lived in it pending the restoration of\r\nthe Lake Palace, desecrated by the foreign occupation.\r\n\r\n(4) Chien Ching Kung, or Palace of Heavenly Purity. The Hall in which\r\nChina’s Emperors were accustomed to give audience to the Grand Council.\r\nAfter the Boxer rising, in accordance with the new ceremonial laid down\r\nby the Peace Protocol, the Diplomatic Body were received here. In this\r\nHall the Emperor Kuang Hsü discussed and decided with K’ang Yu-wei the\r\nreform programme of 1898, and it was here that his body lay awaiting\r\nsepulture between November 1898 and February 1909.\r\n\r\n(5) Shen Wu Men, or Gate of Divine Military Genius. Through this, the\r\nNorthern gate of the City, the Old Buddha fled in the dawn of the 15th\r\nAugust, 1900.\r\n\r\n(6) The Rock-garden in which Her Majesty used to walk during the days of\r\nthe siege of the Legations and from which she witnessed the burning of\r\nthe Hanlin Academy.\r\n\r\n(7) Yang Hsin Tien, or Throne Hall of Mental Growth. In this Palace the\r\nEmperor T’ung-Chih resided during the whole of his reign.\r\n\r\n(8) Hsi Hua Men, or West Gate Glorious. One of the main entrances to the\r\nForbidden City.\r\n\r\n(9) Tai Ho Tien, Throne Hall of Exalted Peace. Used only on occasions\r\nof High ceremony, such as the accession of a new Emperor, an Imperial\r\nbirthday celebration, or the New Year ceremonies.\r\n\r\n(10) Shou Huang Tien, or Throne Hall of Imperial Longevity. In this\r\nbuilding the reigning sovereign unrolls on the day of the New Year the\r\nportraits of deceased Emperors, and pays sacrifice to them.\r\n\r\n(11) Hsi Yüan Men, Western Park Gate. It is through this that the Grand\r\nCouncil and other high officials pass to audience when the sovereign is\r\nin residence at the Lake Palace.\r\n\r\n(12) At this gate the Emperor was wont to await, humbly kneeling, the\r\narrival of the Old Buddha on her way to or from the Summer Palace.\r\n\r\n(13) The Altar of Silkworms, at which the Empress Consort must sacrifice\r\nonce a year, and where the Old Buddha sacrificed on occasion.\r\n\r\n(14) A Lama Temple where the Old Buddha frequently worshipped.\r\n\r\n(15) Ta Hsi Tien. The Temple of the Great Western Heaven. A famous\r\nBuddhist shrine built in the reign of the Emperor Kang Hsi.\r\n\r\n(16) The Old Catholic Church built within the Palace precincts by\r\npermission of the Emperor Kang-Hsi. It was converted by the Empress\r\nDowager into a Museum in which was kept the collection of stuffed birds\r\nmade by the missionary Père David. Eye-witnesses of the siege of the\r\nFrench Cathedral in 1900 have stated that the Empress and several of\r\nthe ladies of the Court ascended to the roof of this building to watch\r\nthe attack on the Christians; but it is not likely that they exposed\r\nthemselves for any great length of time in what must have been a\r\ndangerous position.\r\n\r\n(17) Tzu Kuang Ko: Throne Hall of Purple Effulgence. The building in\r\nwhich the Emperor is wont to receive, and entertain at a banquet, the\r\nDalai and Panshen Lamas and certain feudatory chiefs. Before 1900,\r\nForeign Envoys were also received here.\r\n\r\n(18) Ching Cheng Tien, or Throne Hall of Diligent Government. Used for\r\nthe audiences of the Grand Council when the Court was in residence at the\r\nLake Palace.\r\n\r\n(19) Li Yüan Tien: Throne Hall of Ceremonial Phœnixes. Part of the\r\nEmpress Dowager’s new Palace, built for her in the early years of Kuang\r\nHsü’s reign. Here she received birthday congratulations when resident at\r\nthe Lake Palace, and here she gave her valedictory audience, just before\r\nher death.\r\n\r\n(20) Ying Tai, or Ocean Terrace, where the Emperor Kuang Hsü was kept\r\nunder close surveillance after the _coup d’état_ in 1898, and which he\r\nnever left (except on one occasion when he attempted to escape) between\r\nSeptember 1898 and March 1900. By means of a drawbridge, this Ocean\r\nTerrace was made a secure place of confinement. After the return of the\r\nCourt in 1902, His Majesty lived here again, but under less restraint,\r\nand it was here that he met his death.\r\n\r\n(21) At this point stood the high mound which Her Majesty is reported\r\nto have ascended on the night of 13th June, 1900, to watch the\r\nconflagrations in various parts of the city.\r\n\r\n(22) The White Pagoda, built in the time of the Yüan dynasty (_circa_\r\n1290 A.D.), when the artificial lake was also made.\r\n\r\n(23) Wan Shou ssŭ, the Temple of Imperial Longevity. Here the Empress was\r\naccustomed to sacrifice on her journeys to and from the Summer Palace.\r\n\r\n(24) The residence of Ching Shan, where the Diary was written.\r\n\r\n(25) The residence of Wen Lien, Comptroller of the Household and friend\r\nof Ching Shan.\r\n\r\n(26) Residence of Jung Lu.\r\n\r\n(27) Place of the Princess Imperial, the daughter of Prince Kung, whom\r\nthe Empress Dowager adopted.\r\n\r\n(28) Birthplace of the present infant Emperor, Hsüan T’ung, son of Prince\r\nCh’un and grandson of Jung Lu.

Yangkunu was killed at\r\nMukden in 1583, in one of his raids upon the territories which still owed\r\nallegiance to the degenerate Chinese sovereign Wan Li. His clan lived and\r\nflourished in that region, near the Corean border, which is dominated by\r\nthe Long White Mountain, the true cradle of the Manchu stock. He and his\r\npeople seem to have acquired the arts of war, and much lust of conquest,\r\nby constantly harassing the rich lands on their ever-shifting borders,\r\nthose rich lands which to-day seem to be about to pass under the yoke of\r\nnew invaders. Yangkunu’s daughter assumed the title of Empress by right\r\nof her husband’s conquests, and her son it was who eventually wrested the\r\nwhole of Manchuria from the Ming Dynasty and reigned under the name of\r\nTien-Ts’ung.\r\n\r\nInto this clan, in November 1835, was born Yehonala, whose life was\r\ndestined to influence countless millions of human beings, Yehonala, who\r\nwas to be thrice Regent of China and its autocratic ruler for over half a\r\ncentury. Her father, whose name was Hui Cheng, held hereditary rank as\r\nCaptain in one of the Eight Banner Corps. Considering the advantages of\r\nhis birth, he was generally accounted unsuccessful by his contemporaries;\r\nat the time of his death he had held no higher post than that of an\r\nIntendant of Circuit, or Taotai. Holding this rank in the province of\r\nAnhui, he died when his daughter was but three years of age. His widow\r\nand family were well cared for by a kinsman named Muyanga, father of her\r\nwho subsequently became Empress Consort of Hsien-Feng and Co-Regent with\r\nYehonala. From him the children received every advantage of education.\r\n\r\nMany unfounded and ridiculous stories have been circulated in recent\r\nyears attributing to the Empress Dowager humble, and sometimes\r\ndisgraceful, antecedents. Many of these are nothing more than the fruit\r\nof Yellow Journalism, seeking sensational material of the kind which\r\nappeals to the iconoclastic instincts of its readers. Others, however,\r\nundoubtedly owe their origin to the envy, hatred and malice of Palace\r\nintrigues, to the initiative of the Iron-capped Princes and other high\r\nofficials of the elder branch of the Imperial family, many of whom were\r\naddicted to besmirching the family and character of Tzŭ Hsi in order to\r\ninflict “loss of face” on the Yehonala clan. In this way, and because mud\r\nthrown from above usually sticks, their malicious stories were freely\r\ncirculated, and often believed, in Peking and in the South: witness the\r\nwritings of K’ang Yu-wei and his contemporaries.[1]\r\n\r\nTo cite an instance. One of these mythical stories used to be told, with\r\nevery appearance of good faith, by Prince Tun, the fifth son of the\r\nEmperor Tao-Kuang. This Prince cherished a grudge against Tzŭ Hsi because\r\nof his disappointed ambitions: adopted himself out of the direct line of\r\nsuccession, he had nevertheless hoped, in 1875, that his son would have\r\nbeen chosen Emperor. The story, as he used to tell it, was that when the\r\nEmpress’s mother had been left a widow with a large family (including\r\nthe future ruler of China) they lived in the most abject poverty at\r\nthe prefectural city of Ningkuo, where her husband had held office and\r\ndied. Having no funds to pay for her return to Peking, she would have\r\nbeen reduced to beggary had it not been that, by a lucky accident, a sum\r\nof money intended for another traveller was delivered on board of her\r\nboat at a city on the way, and that the traveller, on learning of the\r\nmistake and being moved to pity at the sight of the family’s destitution,\r\ninsisted on her keeping the money. Twenty-five years later, when Tzŭ Hsi\r\nhad become the all-powerful Regent, this official appeared for audience\r\nat Peking, when, remembering the benefits received at his hands, the\r\nEmpress raised him from his knees and expressed her gratitude for his\r\nkindness. The story is prettier than many which emanate from the same\r\nsource, and original, too, in the idea of a Manchu official dying at his\r\nprovincial post in abject poverty, but unfortunately for the truth of the\r\nnarrative, it has been established beyond shadow of doubt that neither\r\nthe wife nor the family of Tzŭ Hsi’s father were with him at the time of\r\nhis death. They had gone on ahead to Peking, in anticipation of his early\r\nreturn thither to take up a new appointment in the White Banner Corps.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, it may be well to refer briefly to the\r\nYehonala clan and its position in relation to the elder branch of the\r\nImperial family, a question of no small importance, past and future, in\r\nits effect on the history of modern China. Jealousy and friction there\r\nhave always been between the Imperial house and this powerful patrician\r\nclan, since the first Yehonala became _de facto_ ruler of the Empire\r\nafter the collapse of the Tsai Yüan conspiracy, but their relations\r\nbecame more markedly strained after the _coup d’état_ in 1898, and\r\nalthough the wholesome fear of the Empress Dowager’s “divine wrath”\r\nprevented any definite cleavage, the possibilities of trouble were ever\r\nlatent in the Forbidden City. Recent events at Peking, and especially the\r\ndismissal of the Chihli Viceroy, Tuan Fang, for alleged irreverence at\r\nthe funeral ceremonies of the late Empress Dowager, have emphasised the\r\ndivisions in the Manchu camp and the dangers that beset its Government,\r\nnow bereft of the strong hand of Tzŭ Hsi. It is difficult for foreigners\r\nto form any clear idea of the actual conditions of life and of party\r\ndivisions in the Palace, confused as they are by intricate questions\r\nof genealogy, of inter-marriage and adoptions by relatives, of ancient\r\nclan feuds. It should, however, be explained that the Imperial Clansmen\r\n(known in their own tongue as Aisin Gioros) divided into the Yellow and\r\nRed Girdles, are the descendants respectively of Nurhachu himself and\r\nof that ruler’s ancestors, by virtue of which ancestry they consider\r\nthemselves (and the Chinese would recognise the claim) to be the _sang\r\npur_ and highest nobility of the Manchu Dynasty. The Yehonala clan,\r\nalthough in no sense of Royal blood (as marriages between the sovereign\r\nand female members of a family do not entitle that family to claim more\r\nthan noble rank) owes its great power not only to its numbers, but to\r\nthe fact that it has given three Empresses Dowager to the Empire; but,\r\nabove all, to the great prestige and personal popularity of Tzŭ Hsi. If\r\nrecent events are to be interpreted in the light of history, and of her\r\nsignificant death-bed mandate, the present leaders of the Yehonala clan\r\nare determined that the present Empress Dowager, the widow of Kuang-Hsü,\r\nshall follow in the footsteps of her august aunt, and control the\r\nbusiness of the State, at least during the Regency. And, thanks to Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s far-seeing statecraft, the young Emperor is a grandson of Jung Lu,\r\nand may be expected therefore to reverence the policy handed down by the\r\nOld Buddha.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REGENT, PRINCE CH’UN, WITH HIS TWO SONS, THE PRESENT\r\nEMPEROR (STANDING) AND PRINCE P’U CHIEH.]\r\n\r\nOne long-standing cause of suspicion and dissension between the\r\nparties in the Palace arises from the fear of the elder descendants\r\nof Tao-Kuang (of whom Prince P’u Lun and Prince Kung are the chief\r\nrepresentatives) that the present boy-Emperor, or his father, the Regent,\r\nwill hereafter elevate the founder of his branch, the first Prince\r\nCh’un, to the posthumous rank of Emperor, a species of canonisation\r\nwhich Europeans might consider unimportant, but which, in the eyes of\r\nthe Chinese, would constitute a sort of posthumous usurpation on the\r\npart of the junior branch of the Imperial clan, since the first Prince\r\nCh’un would thus be placed on a footing of equality with Nurhachu, the\r\nfounder of the Dynasty, and would practically become the founder of a\r\nnew line. The first Prince Ch’un had himself foreseen the possibility\r\nof such an occurrence, and had realised that it could not fail to lead\r\nto serious trouble, for which reason, as will be seen hereafter, he\r\nhad taken precautions to prevent it. It has not escaped the attention\r\nof those whose business it is to watch the straws that float down the\r\nstream of high Chinese policy that, since the accession of the present\r\nchild-Emperor to the Throne, the ancestral sacrifices made at the\r\nmausoleum of the first Prince Ch’un have been greatly elaborated in pomp\r\nand circumstance, while in official documents his name has been given\r\n“double elevation,” that is to say, in the eyes of the _literati_ he is\r\nmade to rank on the same level as a reigning Emperor. It is commonly\r\nbelieved by those Chinese who are in a position to speak with authority\r\non the subject, that when the Emperor attains his majority, he will be\r\nled to confer further posthumous honours upon his grandfather, including\r\nthat of “triple elevation,” which would place him on a footing of\r\nequality with a deceased Emperor, and entitle him to worship at a special\r\nshrine in the Temple of the Ancestors of the Dynasty. From a Chinese\r\nconstitutional point of view, the consequences of such a step would be\r\nextremely serious and difficult of adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe Old Buddha was a strong partisan, and during her lifetime her\r\nimmediate kinsmen were practically above the law, basking in the\r\nsunshine of her protection or making hay thereby, so that there was\r\nalways a strong undercurrent of friction between them and the Yellow and\r\nRed Girdles, friction of which echoes frequently reached the tea-houses\r\nand market places of the capital. Tzŭ Hsi delighted to snub the Aisin\r\nGioros; in one Decree she forbade them to reside in the business quarter\r\nof the city, on the ground that she had heard it said that some of them\r\nwere making money by disreputable trades. She was by no means beloved of\r\nthe Iron-capped princes and other noble descendants of Nurhachu, who,\r\nwhile they feared her, never ceased to complain that she curtailed their\r\ntime-honoured privileges.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of her masterful methods of dealing with these\r\nhereditary aristocrats occurred when one of the Imperial Dukes ventured\r\nto build himself a pretentious house in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nImperial City, and overlooking a considerable portion of the palace\r\nenclosure. No sooner was the building completed than the Old Buddha\r\nconfiscated it, reprimanding the owner for his lack of decorum in daring\r\nto overlook the Palace grounds, and forthwith she bestowed it upon her\r\nyounger brother, the Duke Chao.\r\n\r\nAnother example of her clannishness, and of the difficulties which it\r\ncreated for the local authorities, occurred upon the establishment of\r\nthe new Police Board at Peking, three years after the return of the\r\nCourt from exile in 1902. The Grand Councillor, Hsü Shih-ch’ang, a\r\nChinese by birth, and a favourite of Her Majesty, was placed at the head\r\nof this new Board, but he soon realised that the lot of his policemen,\r\nwhen dealing with the members of the ruling clan, was by no means a\r\nhappy one. Her Majesty’s third brother, the Duke Kuei Hsiang, was a\r\nparticularly hardened offender, absolutely declining to recognise police\r\nregulations of any kind, and inciting his retainers to “gain face” by\r\ndriving on the wrong side of the road and by committing other breaches\r\nof the regulations. On one occasion a zealous policeman went so far as\r\nto arrest one of the Duke’s servants. Hsü Shih-ch’ang, hearing of the\r\noccurrence, promptly ordered the man’s release, but the Duke, grievously\r\ninsulted, insisted upon an abject apology from the head of the Board\r\nin person. Thrice did the unfortunate Hsü call at the Duke’s palace\r\nwithout gaining admission, and it was only after he had performed a\r\nkowtow before the Duke in the open courtyard outside the palace that his\r\napology was accepted. An idea of the importance of this incident in the\r\neyes of the Pekinese, and of the power of the clansmen, may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that Hsü subsequently became Viceroy of the Manchurian\r\nprovinces, later President of the Ministry of Posts and Communications,\r\nand in August, 1910, was elevated to the Grand Council. On this occasion,\r\nhowever, the Old Buddha, learning of the incident, “excused” Hsü from\r\nfurther attendance at the Grand Council, and shortly afterwards he was\r\ntransferred to Mukden.\r\n\r\nYehonala’s mother, the lady Niuhulu, survived her husband for many years,\r\nresiding in his house in “Pewter Lane” (Hsi-la-hu-t’ung), quite close\r\nto the Legation quarter. When her daughter became Empress Mother, she\r\nreceived the rank of Imperial Duchess. She appears to have been a lady\r\nof great ability and good sense, distinguished even amongst the members\r\nof a clan always noted for the intelligence of its women kind. After\r\nliving to a ripe old age, she was buried beside her husband in the family\r\ngraveyard which lies without the city to the west, in the vicinity of the\r\nEuropeans’ race-course, where her daughter’s filial piety was displayed\r\nby the erection of an honorific arch and the customary marble tablets.\r\nWhen, in January 1902, the Empress Dowager returned from exile by railway\r\nfrom Cheng-ting fu, she gained great kudos from the orthodox by declining\r\nto enter the capital by the Hankow railway line, because that line ran\r\nclose to her parents’ graves, and it would have been a serious breach of\r\nrespect to their memory to pass the spot without reverently alighting to\r\nmake obeisance. She therefore changed her route, entering Peking from\r\nthe south, to the great admiration of all her people.\r\n\r\nOf Yehonala’s childhood there is little to record except that among her\r\nyouthful playmates was a kinsman, Jung Lu, who in after years was to play\r\nso prominent a part in many a crisis of her career. By common report she\r\nhad been betrothed to him from birth. This report is not verifiable, but\r\nthere is no doubt that the great influence which Jung Lu exercised over\r\nher, far greater than that of any of her family or highest officials, was\r\nfounded in their early youth. K’ang Yu-wei and other Chinese officials\r\nopposed to the Manchu rule have not hesitated to assert that he was on\r\nterms of improper intimacy with her for years, dating from the flight to\r\nJehol, and before the decease of her husband the Emperor.\r\n\r\nYehonala’s education followed the usual classical course, but the\r\nexceptional alertness and activity of her mind, combined with her\r\ninordinate ambition and love of power, enabled her to rise superior to\r\nits usually petrifying influences and to turn her studies to practical\r\naccount in the world of living men. She learned to paint skilfully and\r\nto take real pleasure in the art; she was an adept at the composition of\r\nverses, as classically wooden in form as anything produced by the most\r\ndistinguished of English public schools. At the age of sixteen she had\r\nmastered the Five Classics in Chinese and Manchu, and had studied to good\r\npurpose the historical records of the twenty-four Dynasties. She had\r\nbeyond doubt that love of knowledge which is the beginning of wisdom,\r\nand the secret of power, and she had, moreover, the chroniclers aver, a\r\ndefinite presentiment of the greatness of her destiny.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of the Emperor Tao-Kuang in 1850, his eldest surviving\r\nson, aged nineteen, ascended the Throne under the reign-title of\r\nHsien-Feng. After the expiry of the period of mourning (twenty-seven\r\nmonths) during which the new Emperor may not marry, a Decree was issued\r\ncommanding that all beautiful Manchu maidens of eligible age should\r\npresent themselves at the Imperial Household Office which would make\r\nfrom them a selection for the Emperor’s harem. Prior to his accession,\r\nHsien-Feng had married the eldest daughter of Muyanga, but she had died\r\nbefore his coming to the Throne. Among the maidens who obeyed the nuptial\r\nEdict were Muyanga’s second daughter, Sakota, and the young Yehonala.\r\nOn the 14th of June, 1852, about sixty of the beauty and fashion of\r\nthe Manchu aristocracy appeared before the critical eye of the widow\r\nof Tao-Kuang, who selected twenty-eight from among them, and these she\r\ndivided into the four classes of Imperial concubines, viz., “Fei,”\r\n“P’in,” “Kuei Jen,” and “Ch’ang Tsai.” Sakota thus became a “P’in,” and\r\nYehonala a “Kuei Jen” or “honourable person.” With rare exceptions, these\r\nImperial concubines are much more the servants of their mother-in-law\r\nthan the wives of their sovereign. In theory, their number is limited to\r\nseventy, but this number is seldom maintained; beside them, there are\r\nwithin the Palace precincts some two thousand female Manchus, employed\r\nas handmaidens and general servants under the direction of the eunuchs.\r\nIn all domestic matters of the household, the widow of the Emperor last\r\ndeceased exercises supreme authority, and although precedent allows\r\nthe Emperor to inspect the ladies selected, he has no voice in their\r\ndisposition or the determination of their rank.\r\n\r\nThus Yehonala left her home in Pewter Lane to become an inmate of the\r\nForbidden City, cut off henceforth from all direct intercourse with\r\nher own people. An aged tiring woman who served her from the time of\r\nher first entry into the Palace until her death, is our authority for\r\nthe following interesting description of the only visit which she ever\r\npaid to her family. It was in January 1857, nine months after the birth\r\nof her son, the heir to the Throne, that, by special permission of the\r\nEmperor, she was allowed to leave the Palace. Early in the morning,\r\neunuchs were sent to announce to her mother that her daughter, the\r\nConcubine Yi, was coming to visit her at mid-day. There was much joyful\r\nexcitement amongst the family and its friends at this rare honour. All\r\nthe neighbours in Pewter Lane turned out to see the eunuchs and the\r\nyellow-draped chair. The mother and all the members of the household\r\n(including some of an elder generation) ranged themselves on either side\r\nof the entrance courtyard as the chair was borne within. At the head\r\nof the steps leading to the inner courtyard the eunuchs in attendance\r\nrequested her to descend; she then entered the main room, where she took\r\nthe seat of honour. Her family approached respectfully to salute her, all\r\nkneeling except her mother and the elder relatives. A banquet was then\r\nserved at which, by special arrangement, the mother took a seat lower\r\nthan that of the daughter, thus recognising her position as mother of the\r\nHeir Apparent. All present were most favourably impressed by Yehonala’s\r\nunaffected and affectionate disposition; she seemed quite unspoiled by\r\nthe formalities and splendours of Court life, talking with all the old\r\nvivacity as a daughter of the house, showing the keenest interest in the\r\nfamily’s affairs, and particularly in the education of her sisters.\r\n\r\nThe banquet lasted till late in the afternoon, Yehonala asking and\r\nanswering innumerable questions. As the short January day drew to its\r\nclose, the eunuchs requested her to prepare to return to the Palace. She\r\ntherefore took an affectionate farewell of her family, expressing sincere\r\nregret that her life must be cut off from theirs, but hoping that some\r\nday the Emperor might again permit her to visit them. Her mother, she\r\nsaid, would, in any case, be allowed to come and see her in the Palace.\r\nAfter distributing presents to all the members of her family, she entered\r\nher palanquin and was borne away. She never saw her home again, but in\r\nlater years her mother used frequently to visit her in the Forbidden City.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the Palace, Yehonala proceeded to establish herself\r\nfirmly and speedily in the good graces of Tao-Kuang’s widow; through\r\nher influence at first, and later by virtue of her own charm, she soon\r\nbecame first favourite with her weak and dissolute lord; and when, in\r\nApril 1856, she crowned his long disappointed ambitions by presenting\r\nhim with an heir to the Throne, her position was completely assured. At\r\nthe time of her entering the Palace, the Taiping rebellion was causing\r\ngreat uneasiness at the capital. In March 1853, the rebels took Nanking,\r\nthe southern capital. Yehonala, who had already made it her business to\r\nread, and advise on, all Memorials from the provinces, used her growing\r\ninfluence with the Son of Heaven to secure the appointment of Tseng\r\nKuo-fan as Commander-in-Chief, and to provide him with funds for the\r\nraising of train-bands in Hunan, with which, and with the help of General\r\nGordon, Tseng eventually suppressed the rebellion. Thus early she showed\r\nher superiority to environment and the fetters of tradition, displaying\r\nat a moment of national danger that breadth of mind and quick decision\r\nwhich distinguished her. By all official precedent, Tseng Kuo-fan was not\r\navailable for service, being in mourning for his mother, but it was ever\r\nYehonala’s opinion that precedents were meant to be subordinate to the\r\nState and not the State to precedents, wherein lies the mark of the born\r\nruler.\r\n\r\nIn August 1855 the widow of Tao-Kuang died and Yehonala, in recognition\r\n“of her dutiful ministrations,” was raised to the rank of “P’in,” her\r\ncolleague Sakota having in the meanwhile become Empress Consort.\r\n\r\nIt was the common belief of Chinese writers at this time that the reign\r\nof Hsien-Feng would witness the end of the Dynasty, which was held to\r\nhave “exhausted the mandate of Heaven.” All over the Empire rebellion\r\nwas rife; the sovereign himself was a weak debauchee, incapable of\r\ninspiring either loyalty or affection in his people. In the eyes of the\r\n_literati_ he was a degenerate, having none of the scholarly tastes which\r\nhad made his five predecessors famous in history, nor any disposition\r\nto follow their example in the compiling of monumental editions of the\r\nclassics and dictionaries, which have endeared their memory to scholars.\r\nIt was, moreover, considered ominous that no heir had yet been born to\r\nhim, though he was now twenty-five, several of his predecessors having\r\nprovided for the succession before they were fifteen. When, therefore, in\r\nApril 1856, Yehonala gave birth to a son, and at the same time the rebels\r\nwere driven from the provinces of Hunan and Kiangsi, it was felt that the\r\ntide of evil had turned and that Heaven’s favour once more smiled upon\r\nthe Throne.\r\n\r\nAt this period, the health of the Emperor, stricken with paralysis, had\r\ncompletely broken down and Yehonala, by virtue of her position as mother\r\nof the Heir Apparent, and even more by reason of her masterful character,\r\nbecame the real ruler of the Empire. Her colleague, the Empress Consort,\r\ntook little or no active interest in the business of government. In\r\nactual rank, Yehonala had risen to the position of a concubine of the\r\nfirst grade “Fei” and was generally known in the metropolis as the “Kuei\r\nFei, Yi,” the last word being her honorific title, meaning “feminine\r\nvirtue.”\r\n\r\nHer advice on foreign affairs at this period was generally of an\r\naggressive character, and the fact is not matter for wonder when we\r\nbear in mind her youth, her pride of race and her complete ignorance of\r\nforeign countries and their resources. On the return of the special Envoy\r\nCh’i Ying, who had been sent to endeavour to induce Lord Elgin to leave\r\nTaku and whose mission had ignominiously failed, it was to the haughty\r\nYehonala that common report credited the Decree which ordered him to be\r\npresented with the “silken cord” of self-despatch, as a mark of “the\r\nThrone’s benevolent leniency.” To her also was ascribed the Emperor’s\r\nrefusal to permit the High Commissioner Yeh at Canton to negotiate with\r\nthe British on trade questions, a decision which led directly to the\r\ncapture of that city by the foreign barbarian in the following year. In\r\nthe records left by chroniclers and diarists of that time it is generally\r\nnoticeable that the Emperor’s opinions and doings are ignored and that\r\nall the business of the Imperial City and the Empire had come to depend\r\non the word of Yehonala, a fact in itself sufficiently remarkable in a\r\ncountry where no woman is supposed to rule, and particularly remarkable\r\nwhen we bear in mind that she was at this time only a concubine and\r\ntwenty-two years of age.\r\n\r\nTo prevent confusion arising from the several names and titles of the\r\nEmpress Dowager, it should be explained that her family or clan name of\r\nYehonala was that by which she was known to the world of Peking before\r\nand at the time of her selection for the Imperial harem. In the Palace,\r\nuntil her accession to the rank of Empress Mother (Empress of the West),\r\nshe was still Yehonala, but more usually described as the “Yi” concubine.\r\nAs co-Regent and Empress Mother, her official designation, Imperially\r\ndecreed, was Tzŭ Hsi, to which many other honorifics were added. To\r\nthe mass of the people she was either the Empress Dowager (_Huang T’ai\r\nHou_) or the Old Buddha, and towards the end of her reign this last\r\naffectionately respectful title was universally used in the North.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL DAÏS IN THE CHIAO-TAL HALL.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Ogawa, Tokio._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT TO JEHOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe causes and history of the invasion of North China by the allied\r\nforces of England and France are too well known to need re-stating here,\r\nbut the part played by Yehonala in the stirring days which preceded\r\nand followed the flight to Jehol are not familiar to European readers.\r\nMost interesting details are given on this subject by a certain Doctor\r\nof Letters and member of the Hanlin Academy, whose diary was printed\r\nprivately in narrative form several years later, and from this document\r\nthe following extracts are taken. It was originally entitled “A Record\r\nof Grief Incurable” and, as will be noted, it is primarily a monument of\r\nfilial piety, into which the doings of the barbarians, and the already\r\ndominant personality of Yehonala, are artlessly interwoven, with a\r\ncertain quality of sincerity that attracts. The narrative itself is full\r\nof human interest.\r\n\r\n    “In the 7th Moon of the ‘Keng Shen’ year (August 1860), five or\r\n    six days after my mother fell sick, rumours began to circulate\r\n    that the barbarians had already reached Taku. It was generally\r\n    known that many Memorials had reached the Throne from the\r\n    metropolitan and provincial officials, but as no mention of\r\n    them had appeared in the Gazette, it was only natural that\r\n    there should be a very widespread feeling of uneasiness and\r\n    many alarming rumours. So far, however, there had been no\r\n    fleeing from the city. His Majesty was seriously ill, and\r\n    it was known that he wished to leave for the north, but the\r\n    Imperial Concubine Yi and Prince Seng dissuaded him from this\r\n    and assured him that the barbarians would never enter the city.\r\n\r\n    “At this time my mother was suffering from dysentery, but\r\n    she ordered the servants to keep it from me. It was only one\r\n    day, when I noticed a prescription lying on her table, that I\r\n    realised that she was indeed seriously ill. Doctor Liu was in\r\n    attendance, as usual, but I never had any confidence in him or\r\n    his methods, which seemed to me far too drastic. Nevertheless\r\n    he had advised and attended her for seven years, and my mother\r\n    and all her household placed implicit confidence in him.\r\n    Alas, the Ancients have rightly said that a good son should\r\n    know something of the principles of medicine, and surely my\r\n    ignorance has been the first cause of my mother’s death. Though\r\n    I should give up my life a hundred times, how can I ever atone\r\n    for this?\r\n\r\n    “During the next few days, people began to leave Peking, for\r\n    the report was spread that our troops had been defeated at\r\n    Taku, and that a Brigadier General was among the slain; the\r\n    garrison had fled from Pei T’ang and the forts were in the\r\n    hands of the barbarians. Prince Seng had been ordered by\r\n    Edict not to fight a pitched battle, so that our forces were\r\n    idly confronting the enemy. Nothing definite was known as to\r\n    the real cause of our defeat, and the people, being kept in\r\n    ignorance, gradually got over their first alarm.\r\n\r\n    “On the 13th of the 7th Moon, I noticed a change for the worse\r\n    in my mother’s condition, and straightway applied for ten days’\r\n    leave of absence from my official duties. I kept her ignorant\r\n    of the political situation and urged her to abstain from worry\r\n    of every kind. But every-day the news was worse, and people\r\n    began to leave the city in thousands.\r\n\r\n    “On the following day, Magistrate Li Min-chai looked in to say\r\n    good-bye, as he was leaving to join the troops in Anhui. He\r\n    expressed strong disapproval of Dr. Liu’s prescription and gave\r\n    me one of his own. My mother was averse to taking his medicine,\r\n    but I persuaded her to do so. In the night she was suddenly\r\n    seized with shortness of breath, and hastily I sent for Mr. Li,\r\n    who assured me that this was in no way due to his medicine.\r\n    My mother, however, insisted upon returning to Dr. Liu’s\r\n    prescription, so all I could do was to urge him to compound\r\n    it of drugs less strong and more suited to a patient of my\r\n    mother’s advanced years.\r\n\r\n    “My mother then bade me to prepare her coffin as she was\r\n    certain that her death was near. Fortunately I had bought\r\n    the wood eight years before at Mukden, and had stored it in\r\n    a coffin shop in Peking, whence I now had it fetched. We set\r\n    carpenters to work in our court-yard, and by the 20th, the\r\n    coffin was finished. The wood was beautifully thick, and the\r\n    whole appearance of the coffin most creditable. Never could\r\n    I have expected that at such a time of haste and general\r\n    disorder so perfect a piece of work could have been produced.\r\n    The carpenters assured me that at the present time such a\r\n    coffin would cost at least a thousand taels in Peking.[2] This\r\n    comforted me not a little.\r\n\r\n    “Next morning the lacquer shop people sent over to put on the\r\n    first coating of lacquer, in which at least two pounds were\r\n    used. We then sent for the tailor and six assistants to make\r\n    the grave clothes and purchased the materials for my mother’s\r\n    ceremonial ‘going away dress.’ I had a long sable robe made\r\n    up, but next day, as my mother appeared to be slightly better,\r\n    I decided to postpone having the long outer robes prepared.\r\n    Rumours were now rife that the barbarians had already reached\r\n    T’ungchou, and were going to bombard Peking on the 27th, so\r\n    that everyone was escaping who could leave the city. On the\r\n    27th, we put on the second coating of lacquer.\r\n\r\n    “On that day, our troops captured the barbarian leader\r\n    Pa Hsia-li (Parkes) together with eight others, who were\r\n    imprisoned in the Board of Punishments. Thereupon the whole\r\n    city was in an uproar, and it became known that His Majesty was\r\n    preparing to leave on a tour northwards. But the Concubine Yi\r\n    persuaded some of the older officials to memorialise, urging\r\n    him to remain, none of which Memorials have been published.\r\n    All the Manchu and Chinese officials were now sending their\r\n    families away and their valuables, but the large shops outside\r\n    the main gate were doing business as usual. My mother’s\r\n    condition remained much the same, and I applied for another ten\r\n    days’ leave.\r\n\r\n    “On the 1st of the 8th Moon, we applied another coating of\r\n    lacquer to the coffin. On the same day Dr. Liu changed my\r\n    mother’s medicine, but, the dysentery continued unabated.\r\n\r\n    “On the 4th my mother called me to her bedside and said: ‘I\r\n    cannot possibly recover. See that all is prepared for the\r\n    burial. I shall take no food to-day.’ I felt as if a knife had\r\n    been thrust into my vitals, and sent straightway for the tailor\r\n    to hurry on with the ceremonial robes. My friend, P’an Yu-shih,\r\n    called and recommended a purgative, but my mother was very\r\n    angry, and refused point-blank to take it. In the night she had\r\n    a violent attack of vomiting, which seemed to relieve her—so\r\n    much so, that I told the tailor not to be in too great a hurry.\r\n    Next morning the robes were finished, but my mother thought\r\n    the coverlet too heavy, and I substituted therefor a lighter\r\n    material, silk. To this she objected as being too luxurious and\r\n    more expensive than she had any right to expect; she observed\r\n    that her parents-in-law had not had grave-wrappings of such\r\n    valuable stuff. Meanwhile the confusion in Peking was hourly\r\n    increasing, and huge crowds were hurrying from the city. Most\r\n    of the city gates were closed for fear of the barbarians, but\r\n    the ‘Chang-yi’ gate in the southern city was still open.\r\n\r\n    “On the 7th, our troops engaged the barbarians outside the Ch’i\r\n    Hua gate. The van was composed of untrained Mongol cavalry,\r\n    who had never been in action. No sooner had the barbarians\r\n    opened fire than they turned as one man, broke their ranks and\r\n    stampeded upon the infantry in their rear. Many were trampled\r\n    to death, and a general rout followed, our men fleeing in every\r\n    direction and the barbarians pressing on to the city walls.\r\n\r\n    “Certain Princes and Ministers besought the Concubine Yi to\r\n    induce the Emperor to leave on a tour. His Majesty was only too\r\n    anxious to start at once, but the Concubine Yi persuaded two\r\n    of the Grand Secretaries to memorialise against his doing so,\r\n    and in response to this a Decree was issued stating that under\r\n    no circumstances would the Emperor leave his capital. Another\r\n    Decree was put out by the Concubine Yi offering large rewards\r\n    to any who should slay the barbarians. It was generally\r\n    thought that the Emperor would now forgo his intended departure.\r\n\r\n    “Early next morning we heard the news of another engagement\r\n    outside the Ch’i Hua gate, upon which news His Sacred Majesty,\r\n    attended by all his concubines, the Princes, Ministers and\r\n    Dukes, and all the officers of the Household, left the city\r\n    in a desperate rout and disorder unspeakable, affording a\r\n    spectacle that gave the impression that hordes of barbarians\r\n    were already in close pursuit. As a matter of fact, the\r\n    foreigners were still at a considerable distance, and at\r\n    the Summer Palace, where the Court lay, there was nothing\r\n    whatsoever to cause the slightest apprehension. I cannot\r\n    understand why His Majesty was allowed to leave; up to the\r\n    very last the Yi Concubine begged him to remain in his Palace,\r\n    as his presence there could not fail to awe the barbarians,\r\n    and thus to exercise a protecting influence for the good of\r\n    the city and people. How, said she, could the barbarians be\r\n    expected to spare the city if the Sacred Chariot had fled,\r\n    leaving unprotected the tutelary shrines and the altars of the\r\n    gods? She begged him to bear in mind that episode in the Chou\r\n    Dynasty, when the Son of Heaven fled his capital, ‘his head\r\n    covered with dust,’ and was forced to take refuge with one of\r\n    his feudatory Princes. The Chinese people have always regarded\r\n    this as a humiliating event in the history of their country,\r\n    but the present flight of the Court appears more humiliating\r\n    still.\r\n\r\n    “Meantime my mother’s condition was becoming critical, and I\r\n    had scant leisure for considering the political situation.\r\n    Every official of any standing had either left the capital\r\n    by this time or was leaving, and all the merchants who could\r\n    afford it were sending their families away. The cost of\r\n    transport was prohibitive for many; the price of a cart with\r\n    one mule to go to Cho-chou was twenty taels, and to Pao-ting fu\r\n    (60 miles) they charged thirty taels. In my case there could be\r\n    no question of removing my mother, and there was nothing for it\r\n    therefore but to sit still and face the situation.\r\n\r\n    “As the dysentery grew more acute every day, with Dr. Liu’s\r\n    permission I tried Dr. Yang’s prescription. It was, however,\r\n    too late, and nothing could help her now. On the morning\r\n    of the 12th she was _in extremis_, and had lost the power\r\n    of swallowing; so we sent for Li, the tailor, to put a few\r\n    finishing touches on the burial robes, and to prepare the\r\n    ‘cockcrow pillow’ and coverlets. At 11 P.M. she passed away,\r\n    abandoning her most undutiful son. Alas, there is no doubt that\r\n    her death lies at my door, because of my ignorance of medicine.\r\n    Smiting my body against the ground, I invoke Heaven, but ten\r\n    thousand separate deaths could not atone for my sins.\r\n\r\n    “We arrayed her, then, in her robes. First her handmaiden put\r\n    on the inner garments, a chemise of white silk, then a jacket\r\n    of grey silk, and outside that a wadded robe of blue satin.\r\n    Then were put on the robe and mantle of State, with the badge\r\n    of her official rank, the jade girdle and necklace of amber.\r\n    After the gold hair ornaments had been placed in position, the\r\n    Phœnix hat was set upon her head; red mattresses were laid upon\r\n    the couch, and we placed her in a comfortable position, with\r\n    her head reclining on the ‘cockcrow’ pillow of red satin. Not\r\n    a friend came near us, and every door in the neighbourhood was\r\n    closed. Next morning I lined the coffin with red satin, and\r\n    then padded it with straw to prevent it shaking, and at 3 P.M.\r\n    I invited my mother to ascend into her ‘long home.’\r\n\r\n    “The city was in a terrible tumult, and a friend came in to\r\n    advise me to bury my mother temporarily in a temple outside\r\n    the city. It would not be safe, he said, to inter her in the\r\n    courtyard of this house, for the barbarian is suspicious by\r\n    nature, and will assuredly search every house in Peking as soon\r\n    as the city is taken. It was impossible for me to consider\r\n    calmly what might happen if they were to find and to desecrate\r\n    my mother’s coffin. I remembered what has been told of their\r\n    doings in Canton under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n    “On the 14th, the ‘Chang-yi’ gate was opened, and I found\r\n    a temple, suitably situated, which the priest was willing\r\n    to allow me to rent. I prepared therefore to watch over my\r\n    mother’s remains, sending my family in the meanwhile to live\r\n    with an old pupil of mine at Pa-chou. Only the two western\r\n    gates of the Chinese city were still open, and as the Hata Men\r\n    and the Ch’ien Men had been closed for four days, the stream of\r\n    traffic through the Shun-chih Men caused perpetual blocks in\r\n    that gateway. All the small pedlars, hawkers and barbers were\r\n    fleeing the city, but still the large business houses remained\r\n    open.\r\n\r\n    “On the 19th I conveyed my mother’s remains to the temple;\r\n    I found all quiet there, but my progress through the city\r\n    gate was very slow because of the crowd. On the 23rd there\r\n    were but few people abroad, and these clustering together in\r\n    small groups and speaking in low voices. Suddenly, a little\r\n    after mid-day, an immense blaze was seen to the north-west,\r\n    and speedily it was reported that the barbarians had seized\r\n    Hai-tien and the Summer Palace. Our army is said to number\r\n    half a million men, and yet it seems that not one of them dare\r\n    oppose the barbarians’ advance. They have about a thousand of\r\n    cavalry, yet they move about at will in our midst as if in an\r\n    uninhabited wilderness! ’Tis passing strange! The troops of\r\n    Prince Seng and General Sheng have retreated to the Te-sheng\r\n    gate.\r\n\r\n    “On the 24th all the shops were closed, and the higher the\r\n    price of vehicles, the greater the number of people to wish to\r\n    engage them. The poorer class were using wheelbarrows, on which\r\n    they packed their most valuable moveables for flight.\r\n\r\n    “Prince Kung sent an Envoy to the barbarians’ camp with a\r\n    despatch asking for an armistice. On arriving in the vicinity\r\n    of the camp, however, the messenger saw the barbarians pointing\r\n    rifles at him, so that he turned and fled.\r\n\r\n    “On the afternoon of the 24th, vast columns of smoke were seen\r\n    rising to the north-west, and it was ascertained that the\r\n    barbarians had entered the Summer Palace, and after plundering\r\n    the three main halls, leaving them absolutely bare, they had\r\n    set fire to the buildings. Their excuse for this abominable\r\n    behaviour is that their troops got out of hand, and had\r\n    committed the incendiarism. After this they issued notices,\r\n    placarded everywhere, in very bad Chinese, stating that unless\r\n    terms of peace had been arranged before mid-day on the 29th,\r\n    they would then bombard Peking, in which case all inhabitants\r\n    who did not wish to share the fate of the city had better\r\n    remove themselves to a safe distance.\r\n\r\n    “On this day it was reported that The Sacred Chariot had\r\n    reached Jehol in safety, but His Majesty had been greatly\r\n    alarmed, and had issued a Decree expressing regret for his\r\n    failure to commit suicide on the approach of the invaders. The\r\n    Emperor is reported to be ill, and it is said that the Princes\r\n    Tsai Yüan and Tuan Hua are trying to get themselves appointed\r\n    to the Grand Council. Should the Emperor die (_lit._ ‘when\r\n    ten thousand years have passed’) the Yi concubine will be\r\n    made Empress Dowager, but at present she is reported to be at\r\n    variance with the Princes, who are endeavouring to prejudice\r\n    the Emperor against her.\r\n\r\n    “I learnt that all was quiet at the temple where my mother’s\r\n    coffin rests. Troops were passing there daily, but, so far,\r\n    none had occupied it. On the 29th, my servant-boy, Yung ’Erh,\r\n    came to tell me that troops from Tientsin in the pay of the\r\n    barbarians had occupied the temple, but on proceeding thither I\r\n    found them to be General Sheng’s men. Prince Seng’s troops were\r\n    also near at hand, so that, if a bombardment had taken place,\r\n    what could have prevented the destruction of the temple, and\r\n    what would then have become of my mother’s remains? I therefore\r\n    decided to engage wheelbarrows and handcarts, at six taels\r\n    apiece, to take my family to Pao-ting fu, and I arranged with\r\n    the undertakers to hire bearers for the coffin.\r\n\r\n    “At 11 A.M. of the same day the barbarians entered the\r\n    city by the Anting gate, occupying its tower and the wall\r\n    adjoining. One large cannon and four small ones were placed\r\n    in position on the wall, and a five-coloured flag hoisted\r\n    there. With the exception of the officials entrusted with the\r\n    duty of negotiating, not one remained in the city. Two days\r\n    ago the prisoner Parkes, and his companions, were sent back\r\n    to the enemy with every mark of courtesy. Scarcely had they\r\n    reached their camp when a special Decree, post-haste from\r\n    Jehol, ordered Prince Kung to decapitate them all forthwith\r\n    as a warning to the bandits who had dared to invade the\r\n    sacred precincts of the Palace. As the Yi concubine had urged\r\n    their execution from the very first, it would seem as if her\r\n    influence were again in the ascendant.\r\n\r\n    “On the 1st of the 9th Moon, the ‘Chang-yi’ gate was closed,\r\n    but I managed to leave the city by the Hsi-pien Men, where I\r\n    was nearly crushed to death in the enormous crowd. Upon my\r\n    arrival at the temple, I had a nice wadded cover made to put\r\n    over the coffin, and then hurried back to the city to arrange\r\n    for the cortège leaving next morning. The President of the\r\n    Board of Finance, Liang Hai-lou, was hiding in the temple\r\n    precincts with his family and chief concubine, all wearing\r\n    common clothes and unshaven. This is a good example of the\r\n    condition to which the very highest had been reduced.\r\n\r\n    “Next morning, on reaching the temple, I found the\r\n    coffin-bearers and transport coolies on the spot. But,\r\n    unfortunately, in my hurry, I failed to notice that the\r\n    undertakers had supplied the frame, on which the coffin is\r\n    carried, of a size smaller than had been agreed upon, so that\r\n    instead of sixteen bearers there were but eight. We started,\r\n    however, and the procession’s appearance of panic-stricken\r\n    fugitives was most distressing to contemplate. But what could\r\n    I do? The first and only object in my mind was to protect\r\n    my mother’s coffin. I have omitted to state that my small\r\n    servant-boy, Yung ’Erh, had started to accompany the coffin\r\n    on foot. But, after they had started, it occurred to me that\r\n    the lad could never stand so long a journey, and that should\r\n    my mother be aware of it, she would be extremely anxious about\r\n    him. Therefore, I quickly engaged another wheelbarrow for Yung\r\n    ’Erh, and bade the coolies hurry after the procession.\r\n\r\n    “On returning home I felt uneasy about the jolting which my\r\n    mother’s coffin must have experienced on the undersized frame.\r\n    I went, therefore, to the undertakers and expostulated with\r\n    them for having cheated me. After much altercation they agreed\r\n    to change the frame, but I was to pay two taels more for\r\n    the larger size. I subsequently learned that they failed to\r\n    keep their promise, but there was no good to be got by suing\r\n    them for breach of faith. They are sordid tricksters. Yung\r\n    ’Erh wrote, however, to assure me that the party had reached\r\n    Pao-ting fu in safety, and that the coffin had not been jolted\r\n    in the least. On removing the wrappings the lacquer was found\r\n    to be undamaged.\r\n\r\n    “The barbarians were now in full possession of the city, and\r\n    rumours were rife on all sides. Everyone in Peking—there\r\n    were still a good many people—was terrified, and the Manchus\r\n    were sending their families from the Tartar to the southern\r\n    (Chinese) city to save their women from being outraged by the\r\n    barbarian bandits. The condition of the people was indeed\r\n    deplorable in the extreme. One of the Censors had sent a\r\n    Memorial to Jehol, reproaching the Emperor for the pass to\r\n    which he had brought his people, and for the neglect of\r\n    ancestral worship caused by his absence. He blamed His Majesty\r\n    for listening to evil advisers, and besought him to return to\r\n    his capital.\r\n\r\n    “The minds of the people were becoming more than ever\r\n    disturbed, because it was now reported that the negotiations\r\n    for peace had so far failed, either because Prince Kung would\r\n    not entertain the barbarians’ conditions, or because the latter\r\n    were too utterly preposterous.\r\n\r\n    “On the 6th, a despatch arrived from the British barbarians,\r\n    accusing China of having violated all civilised usage in\r\n    torturing to death their fellow-countrymen. For this they\r\n    demanded an indemnity of 500,000 taels. At the same time came\r\n    a despatch from the Russian barbarians, saying that they had\r\n    heard that England was demanding this indemnity, but they (the\r\n    Russians) were prepared to use their influence and good offices\r\n    to persuade the British to abate their claims. Prince Kung was\r\n    of opinion that, even if they should be successful in this\r\n    proposed mediation, China would only save some 100,000 taels,\r\n    and for this she would place herself under heavy obligations\r\n    to Russia. So he replied, declining the offer on the ground\r\n    that the British claim had already been accepted by China, and\r\n    that further discussion of the matter was therefore impossible.\r\n    Thereupon the Russians wrote again, saying that if China had\r\n    definitely accepted the British terms there was, of course,\r\n    nothing more to be said, but they asked Prince Kung to note\r\n    that they had induced England to forgo half of the indemnity of\r\n    two million taels originally asked, as a set-off to China for\r\n    the destruction of the Summer Palace. On the 9th, Prince Kung\r\n    forwarded the 500,000 taels to the British barbarians.\r\n\r\n    “The whole sixteen articles of the barbarians’ demands have\r\n    finally been accepted without modification. The only thing\r\n    that our negotiators asked was the immediate withdrawal of the\r\n    invading army, and to obtain this they were prepared to yield\r\n    everything. Therefore, the barbarians openly flout China for\r\n    her lack of men. Woe is me; a pitiful tale, and one hard to\r\n    tell! When the Yi concubine heard of Prince Kung’s complete\r\n    surrender to the barbarians she reproached the Emperor for\r\n    allowing his brother to negotiate, and she implored him to\r\n    re-open hostilities. But His Majesty was dangerously ill, and\r\n    refused to leave Jehol, so that our revenge must be postponed\r\n    for the time being.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.I.H. P’U JU, COUSIN OF THE PRESENT EMPEROR, SON OF THE\r\nBOXER PRINCE TSAI-YING, AND GRANDSON OF PRINCE KUNG.]\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the frequent allusions made by the Hanlin diarist to the\r\nEmperor’s indecision of purpose at the time of the advance of the British\r\nand French armies on Peking, it is reasonable to assume that Yehonala\r\nprompted, if she did not write, the following vigorous Edict, which\r\nappeared on the 3rd day of the 8th Moon in the 10th year of Hsien-Feng\r\n(6th September 1860):—\r\n\r\n    “Swaying the wide world, we are nevertheless animated by one\r\n    and the same instinct of benevolence to all. We have never\r\n    forbidden England and France to trade with China, and for long\r\n    years there has been peace between them and us. But three years\r\n    ago the English, for no good cause, invaded our city of Canton,\r\n    and carried off our officials into captivity. We refrained at\r\n    that time from taking any retaliatory measures, because we\r\n    were compelled to recognise that the obstinacy of the Viceroy\r\n    Yeh had been in some measure a cause of the hostilities. Two\r\n    years ago the barbarian Commander Elgin came north, and we then\r\n    commanded the Viceroy of Chihli, T’an Ting-hsiang, to look into\r\n    matters preparatory to negotiations. But the barbarian took\r\n    advantage of our unreadiness, attacking the Taku forts and\r\n    pressing on to Tientsin. Being anxious to spare our people the\r\n    horrors of war, we again refrained from retaliation and ordered\r\n    Kuei Liang to discuss terms of peace. Notwithstanding the\r\n    outrageous nature of the barbarians’ demands, we subsequently\r\n    ordered Kuei Liang to proceed to Shanghai in connection with\r\n    the proposed Treaty of Commerce, and even permitted its\r\n    ratification as earnest of our good faith.\r\n\r\n    “In spite of all this the barbarian leader Bruce again\r\n    displayed intractability of the most unreasonable kind and\r\n    once more appeared off Taku with a squadron of warships in the\r\n    8th Moon. Seng Ko Lin Ch’in thereupon attacked him fiercely and\r\n    compelled him to make a hasty retreat. From all these facts it\r\n    is clear that China has committed no breach of faith and that\r\n    the barbarians have been in the wrong. During the present year\r\n    the barbarian leaders Elgin and Gros have again appeared off\r\n    our coasts, but China, unwilling to resort to extreme measures,\r\n    agreed to their landing and permitted them to come to Peking\r\n    for the ratification of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n    “Who could have believed that all this time these barbarians\r\n    have been darkly plotting and that they had brought with them\r\n    an army of soldiers and artillery, with which they attacked the\r\n    Taku forts from the rear, and, having driven out our forces,\r\n    advanced upon Tientsin! Once more we ordered Kuei Liang to go\r\n    to Tientsin and endeavour to reason with them, in the hope that\r\n    they might not be lost to all sense of propriety, and with the\r\n    full intention that their demands, if not utterly unreasonable,\r\n    should be conceded. To our utter astonishment, Elgin and his\r\n    colleague had the audacity to demand an indemnity from China;\r\n    they asked, too, that more Treaty ports should be opened, and\r\n    that they should be allowed to occupy our capital with their\r\n    army. To such lengths did their brutality and cunning lead\r\n    them! But we then commanded Prince Yi and Mu Yin, the President\r\n    of the Board of War, to endeavour to induce in them a more\r\n    reasonable spirit and to come to some satisfactory arrangement.\r\n    But these treacherous barbarians dared to advance their savage\r\n    soldiery towards Tungchow and to announce their intention of\r\n    compelling us to receive them in audience.\r\n\r\n    “Any further forbearance on our part would be a dereliction\r\n    of our duty to the Empire, so that we have now commanded our\r\n    armies to attack them with all possible energy and we have\r\n    directed the local gentry to organise train-bands, and with\r\n    them either to join in the attack or to block the barbarians’\r\n    advance. Hereby we make offer of the following rewards:—For\r\n    the head of a black barbarian, 50 taels, and for the head of\r\n    a white barbarian, 100 taels. For the capture of a barbarian\r\n    leader, alive or dead, 500 taels, and for the seizure or\r\n    destruction of a barbarian vessel, 5,000 taels. The inhabitants\r\n    of Tientsin are reputed brave. Let them now come forward and\r\n    rid us of these pestilential savages, either by open attack or\r\n    by artifice. We are no lovers of war, but all our people must\r\n    admit that this has been forced upon us.\r\n\r\n    “As to the barbarians’ seizure of portions of our territory in\r\n    Kuangtung and Fukhien, all our subjects are alike our children\r\n    and we will issue large rewards to any of them in the south who\r\n    shall present us with the head of a barbarian chief.\r\n\r\n    “These barbarians live in the remote parts of the earth, whence\r\n    they come to China for purposes of trade. Their outrageous\r\n    proceedings have, we understand, been encouraged by abominable\r\n    traitors among our own subjects. We now command that all the\r\n    Treaty ports be closed and all trade with England and France\r\n    stopped. Subjects of other submissive States are not to be\r\n    molested, and whensoever the British and French repent them of\r\n    their evil ways and return to their allegiance, we shall be\r\n    pleased to permit them to trade again, as of old, so that our\r\n    clemency may be made manifest. But should they persist in their\r\n    wicked violation of every right principle, our armies must\r\n    mightily smite them, and pledge themselves solemnly to destroy\r\n    utterly these evil-doers. May they repent while yet there is\r\n    time!”\r\n\r\nThree days later Yehonala was present at the morning audience, when the\r\nEmperor made the following statement:—\r\n\r\n    “We learn that the barbarians continue to press upon our\r\n    capital. Their demands were all complied with, yet they insist\r\n    upon presenting to us in person their barbarous documents\r\n    of credentials, and demand that Prince Seng shall withdraw\r\n    his troops from Chang-Chia wan. Such insolence as this makes\r\n    further parley impossible. Prince Seng has gained one great\r\n    victory already, and now his forces are holding the enemy in\r\n    check at Palich’iao.”\r\n\r\nOrders were issued that the landing of troops from the warships which\r\nhad appeared off Kinchou should be stoutly resisted.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of the Moon His Majesty sacrificed at the Temple of Confucius,\r\nbut on the next morning he was afraid to come into the city from the\r\nSummer Palace, although he wished to sacrifice to the tutelary deities\r\nand inform them of his intended departure. Early on the following day\r\nPrince Kung was appointed Plenipotentiary in the place of Prince Yi (Tsai\r\nYüan) and the Emperor, despite the brave wording of his Decree, fled from\r\nthe capital, after making obeisance to the God of War in a small temple\r\nof the Palace grounds. In the Decree announcing his departure, the flight\r\nwas described as an “autumn tour of inspection.”[3]\r\n\r\nThe Court started in utter confusion, but proceeded only some eighteen\r\nmiles on the road northwards from Peking, stopping for the first night in\r\na small temple. Here a Decree was issued calling upon all the Manchurian\r\ntroops to hasten to Jehol for the protection of the Court. On the evening\r\nof the following day a Memorial was received from Prince Kung, reporting\r\non the latest doings of the barbarians, but His Majesty ordered him,\r\nin reply, to take whatever steps he might think fit to deal with the\r\nsituation. It was out of the question, said the Rescript, for the Emperor\r\nto decide on any course of action at a distance: in other words, the\r\nThrone divested itself of further responsibility.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th, the Court lay at the Imperial hunting lodge north of Mi-Yun\r\nhsien. The Chinese chronicler records that the Emperor was too sick to\r\nreceive the Grand Council, and delegated his duties to Yehonala, who\r\nthereupon issued the following Decree:—\r\n\r\n    “We are informed that the pestilent barbarians are pressing\r\n    upon our capital, and our Ministers have asked us to summon\r\n    reinforcements from the provinces. Now the highest form\r\n    of military art is to effect sudden surprises, carefully\r\n    pre-arranged. The barbarians’ superiority lies in their\r\n    firearms, but if we can only bring them to a hand-to-hand\r\n    engagement they will be unable to bring their artillery to\r\n    bear, and thus shall our victory be assured. The Mongol and\r\n    Manchu horsemen are quite useless for this kind of warfare,\r\n    but the men of Hupei and Ssŭ-ch’uan are as agile as monkeys\r\n    and adepts at the use of cover in secret approaches. Let them\r\n    but surprise these bandits once, and their rout is inevitable.\r\n    Therefore let Tseng Kuo-fan, the Viceroy of Hukuang, send up\r\n    at least three thousand of his best troops to Peking, and let\r\n    as many be despatched from Ssŭ-ch’uan. Prince Seng’s troops\r\n    have been defeated again and again, and the capital is in great\r\n    danger. At such a crisis as this, there must be no delay; it\r\n    is our earnest hope that a sufficient force will speedily be\r\n    collected, so that we may be rid of this poisonous fever-cloud.\r\n    For bravery and good service, there will be great rewards. A\r\n    most important Decree.”\r\n\r\nAt the Court’s halting place at Pa-Ko shih, close to the Great Wall,\r\na Memorial came in from Prince Seng Ko Lin Ch’in, stating that\r\nsmall scouting parties of the barbarian troops had been seen in the\r\nneighbourhood of Peking, but that as yet there had been no general\r\nbombardment. A Rescript was issued as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Inasmuch as it would appear that the pertinacity of these\r\n    barbarians will only increase with opposition, it seems\r\n    desirable to come to terms with them as soon as possible.\r\n    With reference to the French barbarian Gros’s petition to be\r\n    permitted to discuss matters with Prince Kung in person, at\r\n    Peking, we command the Prince to receive him. But should the\r\n    bandits attempt to approach the city in force, Prince Seng\r\n    should take them in the rear and cut off their retreat. If\r\n    by any chance, however, Peking should be already taken, let\r\n    the Mongol regiments be sent up to the Great Wall for the\r\n    protection of our person.”\r\n\r\nAfter a leisurely journey, the Court reached Jehol on the 18th. On the\r\n20th, the opinion of the advisers of the Emperor seemed to be in favour\r\nof continuing the war at all costs. A Decree was issued, referring to the\r\nfact that the foreign troops had dared to encamp near the Summer Palace,\r\nand forbidding Prince Kung to spare the lives of any captured barbarians\r\nupon any pretext whatsoever. To this Prince Kung replied stating that the\r\nprisoners had already been released and that the Anting gate had been\r\nsurrendered to the foreigners. Prince Kung, in fact, was statesman enough\r\nto realise that the only chance for China lay in submission; he therefore\r\nignored the Imperial Decrees. Before long the Emperor was persuaded to\r\nallow negotiations to be resumed, and on the 15th of the 9th Moon he\r\nconfirmed the Treaty, which had been signed in Peking, in the following\r\nEdict:—\r\n\r\n    “Prince Kung, duly appointed by us to be Plenipotentiary,\r\n    concluded, on the 11th and 12th days of this Moon, Treaties\r\n    of Peace with the British and the French. Hereafter amity is\r\n    to exist between our nations in perpetuity, and the various\r\n    conditions of the Treaty are to be strictly observed by all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE TSAI YÜAN CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was originally intended that the Emperor Hsien-Feng should return\r\nfrom Jehol to Peking in the spring of 1861, and a Decree was issued to\r\nthat effect. In January, however, his illness had become so serious that\r\ntravelling was out of the question, and this Decree was rescinded.\r\n\r\nAt Jehol, removed from the direct influence of his brothers, and\r\nenfeebled by sickness, the Emperor had gradually fallen under the\r\ndomination of the Prince Yi (Tsai Yüan) with whom were associated, as\r\nGrand Councillors, the Prince Tuan Hua and the Imperial Clansman Su\r\nShun. These three, recognising that the Emperor’s end was near and that\r\na Regency would be necessary, determined on securing the power for\r\nthemselves. Prince Yi was nominally the leader of this conspiracy, but\r\nits instigator and leading spirit was Su Shun. Tuan Hua, whose family\r\ntitle was Prince Cheng, was the head of one of the eight princely\r\nManchu families, descended in the direct line from Nurhachu’s brother.\r\nSu Shun was foster-brother to this Prince. In his youth he was a\r\nconspicuous figure in the capital, famous for his Mohawk tendencies, a\r\nwild blade, addicted to hawking and riotous living. He had originally\r\nbeen recommended to the notice of the Emperor by the two Princes and\r\nsoon won his way into the dissolute monarch’s confidence and goodwill.\r\nFrom a junior post in the Board of Revenue, he rose rapidly, becoming\r\neventually an Assistant Grand Secretary, in which capacity he attained\r\nan unenviable reputation for avarice and cruelty. He had made himself\r\nhated and feared by persuading the Emperor to order the decapitation of\r\nhis chief, the Grand Secretary Po Chun,[4] on the pretext that he had\r\nshown favouritism as Chief Examiner for the Metropolitan Degree,—the real\r\nreason being that he had offended the two Princes by his uncompromising\r\nhonesty and blunt speech. It was at this period that he first came\r\ninto conflict with the young Yehonala, who, dreading the man’s growing\r\ninfluence with the Emperor, endeavoured to counteract it, and at the same\r\ntime to save the life of the Grand Secretary; she failed in the attempt,\r\nand Su Shun’s position became the stronger for her failure. All those who\r\nopposed him were speedily banished or degraded. The Court was terrified,\r\nespecially when it was realised that Yehonala was out of favour, and Su\r\nShun took care to give them real and frequent cause for alarm. At his\r\ninstance, all the Secretaries of the Board of Revenue were cashiered on\r\na charge of making illicit profits by cornering the cash market. The\r\ncharge was possibly well-founded, since such proceedings are part of a\r\nMetropolitan official’s recognised means of subsistence, but coming from\r\nthe notoriously corrupt Su Shun, it was purely vindictive, as was shown\r\nby his subsequent action; for upon this charge he obtained the arrest of\r\nover a hundred notables and rich merchants whom he kept in custody of\r\nno gentle kind until they had ransomed themselves with enormous sums.\r\nThus was founded the great fortune which enabled him to conspire with\r\nthe Princes Yi and Cheng[5] for the supreme power, and which led him\r\neventually to his ruin. To this day, many of his millions lie in the\r\nPalace vaults, to which they were carried after his impeachment and\r\ndeath—millions carefully hoarded by Tzŭ Hsi and buried during the Court’s\r\nflight and exile in 1900.\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly because of the advice of Su Shun that the Emperor fled his\r\ncapital at the approach of the Allies, in spite of the urgent appeals\r\nof Yehonala and the Grand Council. By his advice also most of the high\r\nofficials and Metropolitan Ministers were prevented from accompanying the\r\nCourt, by which means the conspirators were able to exercise steadily\r\nincreasing influence over the Emperor, and to prevent other advice\r\nreaching him. It was only the supreme courage and intelligent grasp of\r\nthe situation shown by Yehonala, that frustrated the conspiracy at its\r\nmost critical moment. Immediately after the death of the Emperor, and\r\nwhile the plotters were still undecided as to their final plans, she sent\r\nan urgent message secretly to Prince Kung which brought him with all\r\nspeed to Jehol, where, by the help of Jung Lu and other loyal servants,\r\nshe put into execution the bold plan which defeated the conspiracy and\r\nplaced her at the head of China’s government. On the day when, the game\r\nhopelessly lost, the usurping Regents found themselves in Yehonala’s\r\nhands and heard her order their summary trial by the Court of the\r\nImperial Clan, Su Shun turned to his colleagues and bitterly reproached\r\nthem. “Had you but taken my advice and slain this woman,” he said, “we\r\nshould not have been in this plight to-day.”\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the beginning of the conspiracy. At the outset,\r\nthe object of Prince Yi was to alienate the Emperor from the influence of\r\nhis favourite concubine, Yehonala. With this object they informed him of\r\nthe intrigue which, by common report, she was carrying on with the young\r\nOfficer of the Guards, Jung Lu, then a handsome athletic man of about\r\ntwenty-five. The Empress Consort they regarded as a negligible factor,\r\nwhose good-natured and colourless personality took little interest in\r\nthe politics of the day; but if their plot was to succeed, Yehonala\r\nmust either be dismissed from the Court for good and all, or, at the\r\nvery least, she must be temporarily relegated to the “Cold Palace,”\r\nas is called the place where insubordinate or disgraced concubines\r\nare isolated. They knew that, however successful their plans at Jehol,\r\nthere must always be danger in the event of the Emperor returning to\r\nPeking, where access to his person is not possible at all times for\r\nofficials (even those nearest to the Throne), whereas Yehonala would be\r\nin a position, with the help of her eunuchs, to recover his favour and\r\nher power. Emphasising, therefore, the alleged misconduct of the young\r\nconcubine, they quoted the precedent of a certain Empress Consort of\r\nCh’ien-Lung who, for less grievous disrespect (shown to the Emperor’s\r\nmother), was imprisoned for life. Thus, by inventions and suggestions,\r\nthey so worked on the sick man’s mind that he finally consented to\r\nhave Yehonala’s infant son, the Heir Apparent, removed from her care,\r\nand authorised the child’s being handed over to the wife of Prince Yi,\r\nwho was summoned to the hunting-lodge Palace for that purpose. At the\r\nsame time, the conspirators thought it well to denounce Prince Kung\r\nto the Emperor, his brother, accusing him of treachery, of conniving\r\nwith the foreigners against the Throne, and of abusing his powers as\r\nPlenipotentiary. Prince Yi had been for years Prince Kung’s sworn enemy.\r\n\r\nThe further intentions of the conspirators, instigated by Su Shun, were\r\nto massacre all Europeans in the capital and to put to death, or at least\r\nimprison for life, the Emperor’s brothers. Accordingly they drafted in\r\nadvance the Decrees necessary to justify and explain these measures,\r\nintending to publish them immediately after the Emperor’s death, which\r\nwas now imminent. But here an unforeseen obstacle presented itself,\r\nthe first of many created for them by the far-seeing intelligence of\r\nYehonala; for they found that she had somehow managed to possess herself\r\nof the special seal, which inviolable custom requires to be affixed to\r\nthe first Edict of a new reign, in proof of validity of succession,—a\r\nseal, in the personal custody of the Emperor, which bears the characters\r\nmeaning “lawfully transmitted authority.” Without this seal, any Decrees\r\nwhich the usurpers might issue would lack something of legal finality\r\nand, according to Chinese ideas, their subsequent cancellation would be\r\njustifiable. But Prince Yi did not feel himself strong enough to risk a\r\ncrisis by accusing her or taking overt steps to gain possession of it.\r\n\r\nAngry with his favourite concubine by reason of the reports of her\r\nintimacy with Jung Lu, and his sickness ever increasing, the Emperor\r\nlingered on in Jehol all the summer of that year, his duty in the\r\nancestral sacrifices at Peking being taken by Prince Kung. On the 4th\r\nof the 6th Moon, the day before his thirtieth birthday, he issued the\r\nfollowing Decree in reply to a Memorial by the Court of Astronomers,\r\nwhich had announced an auspicious conjunction of the stars for the\r\noccasion:—\r\n\r\n    “Last month the Astronomers announced the appearance of a comet\r\n    in the north-west, which intimation we received as a solemn\r\n    warning of the impending wrath of Heaven. Now they memorialise\r\n    saying that the stars are in favourable conjunction, which is\r\n    doubtless a true statement, in no way inspired by their desire\r\n    to please us. But since we came to the Throne, we have steadily\r\n    refused to pay any attention to auspicious omens, and this with\r\n    good reason, in view of the ever-increasing rebellions in the\r\n    south and the generally pitiable condition of our people. May\r\n    the present auspicious conjunction of the stars portend the\r\n    dawning of a happier day, and may heaven permit a speedy end\r\n    to the rebellion. In token of our sincerity, we desire that\r\n    the Astronomical Court shall refrain from reporting to the\r\n    Chronicler’s Office the present favourable omen for inclusion\r\n    in the annals of our reign, so that there may be ascribed to us\r\n    the merit of a devout and sober mind.”\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Emperor received the congratulations of his\r\nCourt in a pavilion of the Palace grounds, but Yehonala was excluded from\r\nthis ceremony. This was His Majesty’s last appearance in public; from\r\nthis date his illness became rapidly worse.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of the 7th Moon Yehonala contrived to despatch a secret\r\ncourier to Prince Kung at Peking, informing him of the critical condition\r\nof his brother and urging him to send with all haste a detachment\r\nof the Banner Corps to which the Yehonala clan belonged. Events now\r\nmoved swiftly. On the 16th, the Grand Councillors and Ministers of the\r\nPresence, all adherents of Tsai Yüan’s faction, entered the Emperor’s\r\nbedroom and, after excluding the Empress Consort and the concubines,\r\npersuaded the Emperor to sign Decrees appointing Tsai Yüan, Tuan Hua and\r\nSu Shun to be Co-Regents upon his decease, with full powers. Yehonala was\r\nto be expressly forbidden from exercising any form of control over the\r\nHeir Apparent. As the necessary seal of State had been taken by Yehonala\r\nand could not be found, these proceedings were irregular. At dawn on\r\nthe following day the Emperor died, and forthwith appeared the usual\r\nvaledictory Decree, prepared in advance by the conspirators, whereby\r\nTsai Yüan was appointed to be Chief Regent, Prince Kung and the Empress\r\nConsort being entirely ignored.\r\n\r\nIn the name of the new Emperor, then a child of five, a Decree was\r\nissued, announcing his succession, but it was observed to violate\r\nall constitutional precedent in that it omitted the proper laudatory\r\nreferences to the Imperial Consort. On the following day, however, the\r\nRegents, fearing to precipitate matters, rectified the omission in an\r\nEdict which conferred the rank of Empress Dowager both on the Empress\r\nConsort and on Yehonala. The chroniclers aver that the reason for this\r\nstep lay in the Regents’ recognition of Yehonala’s undoubted popularity\r\nwith the troops (all Manchus) at Jehol, an argument that weighed more\r\nheavily with them than her rights as mother of the Heir Apparent. They\r\nhoped to rid themselves of this condition of affairs after the Court’s\r\nreturn to Peking, but dared not risk internal dissensions by having her\r\nremoved until their positions had been made secure at the capital. That\r\nthey intended to remove her was subsequently proved; it was evident\r\nthat their position would never be secure so long as her ambitious and\r\nmagnetic personality remained a factor of the situation: but it was\r\nnecessary, in the first instance, to ascertain the effect of the Regency\r\nat Peking and in the provinces.\r\n\r\nTsai Yüan’s next move was to publish Decrees, in the names of the Joint\r\nRegents, by virtue of which they assumed charge of the Heir Apparent\r\nand by which the title of “Chien Kuo” (practically equivalent to\r\nDictator) was conferred on the Chief Regent, a title heretofore reserved\r\nexclusively for brothers or uncles of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached Peking, a flood of Memorials burst from the\r\nCensorate and high officials. The child Emperor was implored to confer\r\nthe Regency upon the two Empresses, or, as the Chinese text has it, to\r\n“administer the Government with suspended curtain.”[6] Prince Kung and\r\nthe Emperor’s other brothers were at this time in secret correspondence\r\nwith Yehonala, whom they, like the Censorate, had already recognised as\r\nthe master-mind of the Forbidden City. They urged her to do all in her\r\npower to expedite the departure of the funeral cortège for the capital.\r\nTo secure this end, it was necessary to proceed with the greatest caution\r\nand diplomacy, for several of the late Emperor’s wives had been won over\r\nto the side of the usurpers, who could also count on a certain number\r\nof the Manchu bodyguard, their own clansmen. The influence of Su Shun’s\r\ngreat fortune was also no inconsiderable factor in the situation. The\r\nman was personally unpopular with the people of Peking, because of his\r\nabuse of power and too frequent connection with speculations in bank-note\r\nissues and cash, which cost the citizens dear, but his vaults were known\r\nto be full to over-flowing, and there is no city in the world where\r\nmoney buys more political supporters than in Peking. Su Shun’s career has\r\nhad its counterpart, in everything except its sanguinary dénouement, in\r\nthe capital to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HER MAJESTY TZŬ HSI IN THE YEAR 1903.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment the position of the Emperor’s family was prejudiced, and\r\nthe aims of the conspirators assisted, by the political situation. With\r\nthe capital occupied by foreign troops, and many of the provinces in the\r\nthroes of a great rebellion, the people might be expected to welcome a\r\nchange of rulers, and the ripe experience of the usurping Regents in all\r\nmatters of State was undeniable. But the virile and untiring energies of\r\nYehonala, ably supported by Jung Lu and other faithful followers, soon\r\nput a new complexion on affairs, and the situation was further modified\r\nin her favour by the success of her nominee, the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nTseng Kuo-fan, in capturing the city of An-ch’ing (in Anhui) from the\r\nrebels, a victory that was regarded as of good augury to her cause.\r\nThereafter her courage and diplomacy enabled her to play off one opponent\r\nagainst another, gaining time and friends until the conspirators’\r\nchance was gone. Her own aims and ambitions, which had been voiced by\r\nher friends in the Censorate, were, however, to some extent impeded by\r\nthe fact that a House-law of the Dynasty forbids the administration of\r\nthe Government by an Empress Dowager, while there were quite recent\r\nprecedents for a Regency by a Board, in the cases of the Emperors\r\nShun-Chih and K’ang-Hsi. In neither of these instances had the Empress\r\nTai-Tsung had any voice in the Government. The precedent for Boards of\r\nofficial Regents had, however, come to be recognised as inauspicious,\r\nbecause the several Regents of K’ang-Hsi’s minority had either been\r\nbanished or compelled to commit suicide. It is probable, too, that Prince\r\nKung, in instigating and supporting the claims of the Empresses, failed\r\nto appreciate Yehonala’s strength of character, and believed that a\r\nwomen’s Regency would leave the supreme power in his own hands.\r\n\r\nA Manchu, who accompanied the flight to Jehol, describing his\r\nexperiences, lays stress upon Yehonala’s unfailing courage and personal\r\ncharm of manner, to which was due her popularity with the Imperial Guards\r\nand her eventual triumph. At the most critical period of the conspiracy\r\nshe was careful to avoid precipitating a conflict or arousing the\r\nsuspicions of the usurpers by openly conferring with Jung Lu, and she\r\nemployed as her confidential intermediary the eunuch An Te-hai (of whom\r\nmore will be heard later). By means of this man daily reports were safely\r\ndespatched to Prince Kung at Peking, and, in the meanwhile, Yehonala\r\naffected an attitude of calm indifference, treating Prince Yi with a\r\nstudied deference which lulled his suspicions.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of the 8th Moon, the Board of Regents, after meeting to\r\ndiscuss the situation, issued a Decree condemning in strong terms a\r\nproposal put forward in a Memorial by the Censor, Tung Yüan-ch’un, that\r\nthe two Empresses should be appointed Co-Regents, and referring to the\r\ndeath-bed Decree of the late Emperor as their own warrant of authority.\r\nAt the same time they announced, in the name of the young Emperor, that\r\nthe funeral cortège would start on its journey to the capital on the\r\nsecond day of the next Moon. This was the step for which Yehonala had\r\nbeen working and waiting. As Ministers of the Presence, the Regents were\r\nperforce obliged to accompany the coffin throughout the entire journey\r\n(some 150 miles) to the capital, and the great weight of the catafalque,\r\nborne by one hundred and twenty men, would necessarily render the rate\r\nof progress very slow through the stony defiles of the hills. Resting\r\nplaces would have to be provided at stages of about fifteen miles along\r\nthe route to shelter the Imperial remains and the attendant officials\r\nby night, so that the Regents might count on a journey of ten days at\r\nleast, and longer in the event of bad weather. To the Empresses, the\r\nslow progress of the cortège was a matter of vital advantage, inasmuch\r\nas they were not to take part in the procession, and, travelling ahead\r\nof it, could reach the capital in five days with swift chair-bearers.\r\nDynastic custom and Court etiquette prescribe that upon the departure of\r\nthe funeral procession, the new Emperor and the consorts of the deceased\r\nsovereign should offer prayers and libations, and should then press on\r\nso as to be ready to perform similar acts of reverence on meeting the\r\ncortège at its destination. Yehonala thus found herself in a position of\r\ngreat strategic advantage, being enabled to reach the capital well in\r\nadvance of her enemies, and she speedily laid her plans with Prince Kung\r\nto give them a warm reception.\r\n\r\nTsai Yüan and his colleagues were well aware that they were placed at\r\ngrave disadvantage in having to remain behind the young Empress, with\r\nevery prospect of serious trouble ahead; they, therefore, decided to\r\nhave Yehonala and the Empress Consort assassinated on the road, and to\r\nthat end gave orders that they should be escorted by the Chief Regent’s\r\npersonal bodyguard. Had it not been for Jung Lu, who got wind of the\r\nplot, the Dowagers would assuredly never have reached the capital alive.\r\nActing with the promptitude which Yehonala inspired, he deserted the\r\nfuneral cortège by night with a considerable following of his own men,\r\nand hastened on to the protection of the Empresses, overtaking them\r\nbefore they reached Ku-pei K’ou, at the end of the pass from the plains\r\ninto Mongolia, which was the spot where the assassination was to have\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nHeavy rains had fallen just after the departure of the procession from\r\nJehol. The roads became impassable, and the Empresses were compelled to\r\nseek shelter in the Long Mountain gorge, where no sort of accommodation\r\nhad been provided. The cortège was then ten miles in their rear.\r\nYehonala, mindful ever of the proprieties, sent back several men of her\r\nescort with a dutiful enquiry, in the name of her colleague and herself,\r\nas to the safety of the Imperial coffin. The reply, in the form of an\r\nEdict by Prince Yi and his Co-Regents, reported that the catafalque had\r\nreached the first resting place in safety; whereupon Yehonala, asserting\r\nas of right the prerogatives of supreme authority, donated to the bearers\r\na thousand taels from her Privy Purse in recognition of their arduous\r\nservices. Prince Yi, knowing full well that his own danger was increasing\r\nevery hour, and would continue so long as the Empresses remained free to\r\nwork against him, nevertheless played bravely the part prescribed for\r\nhim, conforming in the grand manner to the traditions of his position.\r\nHe forwarded a Memorial to the Empresses, humbly thanking them for their\r\nsolicitude for the Emperor’s remains. Yehonala, in reply, praised him for\r\nhis faithful devotion to duty. Thus, on the road to Death, they played\r\nat Etiquette. Both these documents are filed in the Dynastic records\r\nand afford remarkable evidence of the supreme importance which Chinese\r\nand Manchus alike attach to forms and the written word even at the most\r\ncritical moments. Similar instances could be cited at the height of the\r\nBoxer chaos.\r\n\r\nThe rains having ceased, the Empresses were able to proceed on their\r\njourney, and having come safely through the hill passes under Jung Lu’s\r\nprotection, they were free from further danger of ambush. They reached\r\nPeking on the 29th of the 9th Moon, three full days’ journey ahead of the\r\nprocession. Immediately upon their arrival a secret Council was held, at\r\nwhich were present the Emperor’s brothers, together with the Ministers\r\nand Imperial clansmen known to be loyal to their cause. Long and\r\nanxiously did they confer. Although the Empress Mother was in possession\r\nof the seal of legitimate succession, there was no known precedent for\r\nso drastic a step as the summary, and possibly violent, arrest of high\r\nofficers of State convoying the Imperial coffin. Such a course, it was\r\nfelt, would be regarded as disrespectful to the late Emperor and an\r\ninauspicious opening to the new reign. The consensus of opinion was,\r\ntherefore, on the side of slow and cautious measures, and it was decided\r\nthus to proceed, conforming to all the outward observances of dynastic\r\ntradition. The coffin once arrived, the first step would be to deprive\r\nthe Regents of their usurped authority; the rest would follow.\r\n\r\nThe cortège was due to arrive at the north-west gate of the city on\r\nthe morning of the 2nd of the 10th Moon, and on the previous evening\r\nPrince Kung posted a large force of troops at this point to prevent any\r\nattempt at a _coup de main_ by Tsai Yüan’s followers. The boy Emperor,\r\naccompanied by the Empresses Dowager, came out to meet the coffin as it\r\napproached the city, and with him were the late Emperor’s brothers and a\r\ngreat following of officials. As the catafalque passed through the gate,\r\nthe Imperial party knelt and performed the prescribed acts of reverence.\r\nBefore the coffin came the Imperial insignia, and behind it a large\r\nbody of Manchu cavalry. Prince Yi and his Co-Regents, having performed\r\ntheir duty in bringing the coffin safely to the city, next proceeded, as\r\nrequired by custom, to make formal report in person to the young Emperor,\r\nupon fulfilment of their charge. For this purpose they were received\r\nin a large marquee erected just inside the city gate. Both Empresses\r\nwere present, together with the late Emperor’s brothers and the Grand\r\nSecretaries Kuei Liang and Chou Tsu-p’ei.\r\n\r\nYehonala, calmly assuming, as was her wont, the principal _rôle_ and all\r\nattributes of authority, opened the proceedings by informing Prince Yi\r\nthat the Empress Consort and she herself were grateful to him and to his\r\ncolleagues for the services which they had rendered as Regents and Grand\r\nCouncillors, of which duties they were now relieved. Prince Yi, putting\r\na bold face on it, replied that he himself was Chief Regent, legally\r\nappointed, that the Empresses had no power to divest him of authority\r\nproperly conferred by the late Emperor, and that, during the minority of\r\nthe new Emperor, neither she herself nor any other person was entitled to\r\nattend audience without his express permission.\r\n\r\n“We shall see about that,” said Yehonala, and forthwith gave orders\r\nto the attendant guards to place the three Regents under arrest. The\r\nImperial party then hastened to the Palace to be ready to meet the coffin\r\nupon its arrival at the main entrance to the Forbidden City, for, however\r\nacute the crisis, the dead take precedence of the living in China. The\r\ndeposed Regents quietly followed. All hope of escape or resistance was\r\nout of the question, for the streets were lined with troops faithful to\r\nYehonala’s cause. Her triumph was complete, essentially a triumph of\r\nmind over matter. It was her first taste of the pomp and circumstance of\r\nsupreme power.\r\n\r\nForthwith the Empresses proceeded to regularise their position by issuing\r\nthe following Decree, which bore the Great Seal of “Lawfully transmitted\r\nauthority”:—\r\n\r\n    “Last year the coasts of our Empire were disturbed and our\r\n    capital was in danger, misfortunes entirely due to the\r\n    mismanagement of affairs by the Princes and Ministers to whom\r\n    they had been entrusted. Prince Yi (Tsai Yüan) in particular\r\n    and his colleagues failed to deal satisfactorily with the\r\n    peace negotiations, and sought to lessen their responsibility\r\n    by their treacherous arrest of the British emissaries, thus\r\n    involving China in charges of bad faith. In consequence of\r\n    these their acts, the Summer Palace was eventually sacked by\r\n    the British and French troops and the Emperor was forced,\r\n    greatly against his will, to seek refuge in Jehol.\r\n\r\n    “Later, the Ministers of the newly established Tsungli Yamên\r\n    were able to arrange matters satisfactorily, and peace was\r\n    restored to the capital. Thereupon His late Majesty repeatedly\r\n    summoned the Grand Council to decide upon a date for his return\r\n    to Peking, but Tsai Yüan, Su Shun and Tuan Hua conspired\r\n    together, and, by making him believe that England and France\r\n    were not sincere in regard to peace, were able to prevent his\r\n    return and thus to oppose the will of the people.\r\n\r\n    “Subsequently His Majesty’s health suffered severely from\r\n    the cold climate of Jehol and from his arduous labours and\r\n    anxiety, so that he died on the 17th of the 7th Moon. Our\r\n    sorrow was even as a burning fire, and when we consider how\r\n    wickedly deceitful has been the conduct of Tsai Yüan and his\r\n    colleagues, we feel that the whole Empire must unite in their\r\n    condemnation. On ascending the Throne, it was our intention\r\n    to punish them, but we kept in mind the fact that to them\r\n    the Emperor had given his valedictory instructions, and we\r\n    therefore forbore, whilst observing carefully their behaviour.\r\n    Who could possibly have foretold their misdeeds?\r\n\r\n    “On the 11th of the 8th Moon, a Memorial was presented to us by\r\n    the Censor Tung Yüan-ch’un, at an audience of the eight Grand\r\n    Councillors, in which it was asked that the Empresses Dowager\r\n    should for the time being, and during our minority, administer\r\n    the Government, that one or two of the Princes should advise\r\n    them and that a high official should be appointed as tutor to\r\n    ourselves. These suggestions met with our entire approval.\r\n    It is true that there exists no precedent in the history of\r\n    our Dynasty for an Empress Dowager to act as Regent, but the\r\n    interests of the State are our first concern, and it is surely\r\n    wiser to act in accordance with the exigencies of the time than\r\n    to insist upon a scrupulous observance of precedent.[7]\r\n\r\n    “We therefore authorised Tsai Yüan to issue a Decree concurring\r\n    in the Censor’s proposals; but he and his colleagues adopted\r\n    an insolent tone towards us and forgot the reverence due to\r\n    our person. While pretending to comply with our wishes, they\r\n    issued a Decree quite different from that which we had ordered,\r\n    and promulgated it in our name. What was their object? They\r\n    professed to have no idea of usurping our authority, but what\r\n    else was their action but usurpation?\r\n\r\n    “Undoubtedly they took advantage of our extreme youth and of\r\n    the Empresses’ lack of experience in statecraft, their object\r\n    being to hoodwink us. But how could they hope to hoodwink the\r\n    entire nation? Their behaviour displays monstrous ingratitude\r\n    for His late Majesty’s favours, and any further leniency on\r\n    our part would be a just cause of offence to the memory of\r\n    the departed sovereign, and an insult to the intelligence of\r\n    the Chinese people. Tsai Yüan, Su Shun and Tuan Hua are hereby\r\n    removed from their posts. Ching Shou, Mu Yin, Kuang Tu-han and\r\n    Chiao Yu-ying are removed from the Grand Council. Let Prince\r\n    Kung, in consultation with the Grand Secretaries, the six\r\n    Boards and the nine Ministries consider, and report to us as to\r\n    the proper punishment to be inflicted upon them, in proportion\r\n    to their respective offences. As regards the manner in which\r\n    the Empresses shall administer the Government as Regents, let\r\n    this also be discussed and a Memorial submitted in reference to\r\n    future procedure.”\r\n\r\nThe Empresses duly performed the proper obeisances to the Imperial coffin\r\nat the eastern gate of the Palace, escorting it thence to its temporary\r\nresting place in the central Throne Hall.\r\n\r\nIn the security of Peking, and confident of the devotion of the troops,\r\nYehonala now proceeded to act more boldly. She issued a second Decree in\r\nher own name and that of the Empress Consort, ordering that the three\r\nprincipal conspirators be handed over to the Imperial Clansmen’s Court\r\nfor the determination of a severe penalty. Pending the investigation,\r\nwhich was to be carried out under the Presidency of Prince Kung, they\r\nwere to be stripped of all their titles and rank. The vindictive autocrat\r\nof the years to come speaks for the first time in this Edict.\r\n\r\n    “Their audacity in questioning our right to give audience\r\n    to Prince Kung this morning shows a degree of wickedness\r\n    inconceivable, and convicts them of the darkest designs. The\r\n    punishment so far meted out to them is totally inadequate to\r\n    the depth of their guilt.”\r\n\r\nAgainst Su Shun, in particular, the Empress’s wrath burned fiercely. His\r\nwife had insulted her in the days of her disgrace at Jehol, and Yehonala\r\nhad ever a good memory for insults. Next morning she issued the following\r\nDecree for his especial benefit:—\r\n\r\n    “Because of Su Shun’s high treason, his wanton usurpation of\r\n    authority, his acceptance of bribes and generally unspeakable\r\n    wickedness, we commanded that he be degraded and arrested by\r\n    the Imperial Clansmen’s Court. But on receipt of the Decree,\r\n    Su Shun dared to make use of blasphemous language in regard\r\n    to ourselves, forgetful of the inviolable relation between\r\n    Sovereign and subject. Our hair stands on end with horror at\r\n    such abominable treason. Moreover he has dared to allow his\r\n    wife and family to accompany him, when on duty accompanying\r\n    the Imperial coffin from Jehol, which is a most disgraceful\r\n    violation of all precedent.[8] The whole of his property, both\r\n    at Peking and at Jehol, is therefore confiscated, and no mercy\r\n    shall be shown him.”\r\n\r\nAs Su Shun’s property was worth several millions sterling at the lowest\r\nestimate, the Empress Dowager thus acquired at one stroke the sinews of\r\nwar and a substantial nucleus for that treasure hoard which henceforward\r\nwas to be one of the main objects of her ambition, and a chief source\r\nof her power. During the present Dynasty there is a record of one\r\nofficial wealthier than Su Shun, namely Ho Sh’en, a Grand Secretary under\r\nCh’ien Lung, whose property was similarly confiscated by that Emperor’s\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nBut Yehonala’s lust of vengeance was not yet appeased. Her next Decree,\r\nissued on the following day, gives evidence of that acquisitive faculty,\r\nthat tendency to accumulate property and to safeguard it with housewifely\r\nthrift, which distinguished her to the end:—\r\n\r\n    “Su Shun was erecting for himself a Palace at Jehol, which is\r\n    not yet completed. Doubtless he has vast stores of treasure\r\n    there. Doubtless also he has buried large sums of gold and\r\n    silver somewhere in the vicinity of his Jehol residence, in\r\n    anticipation of the possible discovery of his crimes. Let all\r\n    his property in Jehol be carefully inventoried, when a Decree\r\n    will be issued as to its disposal. Let all his property be\r\n    carefully searched for treasure, to be handed over when found.\r\n    Any attempt at concealment by the Jehol authorities will entail\r\n    upon them the same punishment as that which is to be inflicted\r\n    upon Su Shun.”\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of the 10th Moon, Prince Kung and the Imperial Commission\r\nsent in their report on the quite perfunctory enquiry into the charges\r\nagainst Tsai Yüan and the other conspirators. In the following Decree the\r\noffenders were finally disposed of:—\r\n\r\n    “The Memorial of our Imperial Commission recommends that, in\r\n    accordance with the law applying to cases of high treason,\r\n    the punishment of dismemberment and the lingering death be\r\n    inflicted upon Tsai Yüan, Tuan Hua and Su Shun. Our Decrees\r\n    have already been issued describing their abominable plot and\r\n    their usurpation of the Regency.\r\n\r\n    “On the day of His late Majesty’s death, these three traitors\r\n    claimed to have been appointed a Council of Regency, but, as a\r\n    matter of fact, His late Majesty, just before his death, had\r\n    commanded them to appoint us his successor, without giving\r\n    them any orders whatsoever as to their being Regents. This\r\n    title they proceeded to arrogate to themselves, even daring\r\n    to issue orders in that capacity and without the formality of\r\n    our Decree. Moreover they disobeyed the personal and express\r\n    orders given them by the Empresses Dowager. When the Censor\r\n    Tung Yüan-ch’un petitioned that the Empresses should assume\r\n    the government, they not only dared to alter the Decree which\r\n    we issued in reply, but they openly asserted at audience\r\n    their claim to be our Regents and their refusal to obey the\r\n    Empresses. If, said they, they chose to permit the Empresses to\r\n    see Memorials, this was more than their duty required. In fact,\r\n    their insubordination and violent rudeness found expression in\r\n    a hundred ways. In forbidding us to give audience to our uncles\r\n    and to the Grand Secretaries, they evidently meant to set us at\r\n    variance with our kindred. The above remarks apply equally to\r\n    all three traitors.\r\n\r\n    “As to Su Shun, he insolently dared to seat himself upon the\r\n    Imperial Throne. He would enter the Palace precincts unbidden,\r\n    and whether on duty or not. He went so far as to use the\r\n    Imperial porcelain and furniture for his own purposes, even\r\n    refusing to hand over certain articles that we required for\r\n    ourselves. He actually demanded an audience with the Empresses\r\n    separately, and his words, when addressing them, indicated a\r\n    cunning desire to set one Empress against the other, and to sow\r\n    seeds of discord. These remarks apply to the individual guilt\r\n    of Su Shun.\r\n\r\n    “Her Majesty the Empress Dowager, and Her Sacred Majesty the\r\n    Empress Dowager, our mother, duly informed the Commission of\r\n    Enquiry of these facts, and they have to-day given audience\r\n    to all the Princes and Ministers to enquire of them whether\r\n    the guilt of these three traitors admits of any extenuating\r\n    circumstances. It is unanimously determined that the law\r\n    allows of no leniency being shown to such flagrant treason\r\n    and wickedness as theirs. When we reflect that three members\r\n    of our Imperial kindred have thus rendered themselves liable\r\n    to a common felon’s death in the public square, our eyes are\r\n    filled with tears. But all these their misdeeds, in usurping\r\n    the Regency, have involved our tutelary deities in the direst\r\n    peril, and it is not only to ourselves but to our illustrious\r\n    ancestors that they must answer for their damnable treason.\r\n    No doubt they thought that, come what may, they were sure of\r\n    pardon, because of their having received the mandate of His\r\n    late Majesty, but they forgot that the mandate which they\r\n    have claimed was never legally issued, and if we were now to\r\n    pardon them we should render the law of no effect for all time\r\n    and prove unfaithful to the trust reposed in us by our late\r\n    father. The punishment of dismemberment and the lingering\r\n    death, which the Commission recommends, is indeed the proper\r\n    punishment for their crimes, but the House-law of our Dynasty\r\n    permits of leniency being shown, to a certain extent, to\r\n    members of the Imperial Family. Therefore, although, strictly\r\n    speaking, their crimes allow of no indulgence, we decide that\r\n    they shall not suffer the penalty of public disgrace. In token\r\n    of our leniency, Tsai Yüan and Tuan Hua are hereby permitted\r\n    to commit suicide, and Prince Su and Mien Sen are ordered to\r\n    proceed forthwith to the ‘Empty Chamber,’[9] and command the\r\n    immediate fulfilment of this order. It is not from any feeling\r\n    of friendliness towards these traitors that we allow this, but\r\n    simply to preserve the dignity of our Imperial family.\r\n\r\n    “As to Su Shun, his treasonable guilt far exceeds that of\r\n    his accomplices, and he fully deserves the punishment of\r\n    dismemberment and the slicing process, if only that the law may\r\n    be vindicated and public indignation satisfied. But we cannot\r\n    make up our mind to impose this extreme penalty and therefore,\r\n    in our clemency, we sentence him to immediate decapitation,\r\n    commanding Prince Jui and Tsai Liang to superintend his\r\n    execution, as a warning to all traitors and rebels.”\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The hereditary Princedoms of Yi and Cheng which were forfeited\r\nby the conspiring Princes after the death of Hsien-Feng, in 1861, were\r\nrestored by the Empresses Regent to commemorate their thanksgiving at the\r\nsuppression of the Taiping rebellion and the recapture of Nanking (1864).\r\nIn an Edict on the subject, Tzŭ Hsi recalled the fact that the original\r\npatent of the Princedom of Yi was given to a son of the Emperor K’ang-Hsi\r\nin 1723 and was to endure, according to the word of that Monarch, until\r\n“the T’ai Mountain dwindles to the size of a grindstone, and the Yellow\r\nRiver shrinks to the width of a girdle.” After referring to the main\r\nfeatures of the Tsai Yüan conspiracy and the guilt of the traitors, Tzŭ\r\nHsi proceeded “We permitted these Princes to commit suicide because they\r\nwere ungrateful to ourselves, and had brought disrepute on the good name\r\nof their ancestors. If these are now conscious of their descendants’\r\nmisdeeds, while they wander beside the Nine Springs,[10] how great\r\nmust be the anguish of their souls! At the time we were advised by our\r\nPrinces and Ministers of State, to put an end for ever to these Princely\r\ntitles, and we did so in order to appease widespread indignation. Since\r\nthen, however, we have often thought sorrowfully of the achievements of\r\nthese Princely families during the early reigns of our Dynasty, and now\r\nthe triumph of our arms at Nanking provides us with a fitting occasion\r\nand excuse to rehabilitate these Princedoms, so that the good name of\r\ntheir founders may remain unblemished. We therefore hereby restore both\r\ntitles as Princes of the blood with all the estates and dependencies\r\nappertaining thereto, and we command that the genealogical trees of these\r\ntwo Houses be once more placed upon our Dynastic records in their due\r\norder, it being always understood that the usurping Princes Tuan Hua and\r\nTsai Yüan, together with their descendants in the direct line for two\r\ngenerations, are expressly excluded from participation in these restored\r\nprivileges. Original patents of the Princes of Yi and Cheng are hereby\r\nrestored, together with their titles, to the Dukes Cheng Chih and Tsai\r\nTun. And take heed now both of you Princes, lest you fall away from the\r\nancient virtue of your Houses! See to it that you long continue to enjoy\r\nour favour by adding fresh lustre to your ancestral good name!”\r\n\r\nThe intention was undoubtedly well meant, but the Houses of Yi and Cheng\r\ncontinued to incur the displeasure of the gods. The next Prince Yi but\r\none, was permitted to commit suicide in 1900, for alleged complicity in\r\nthe Boxer rising, but it is significant that his name was not on any\r\nBlack List drawn up by the foreign Powers, and that his death was due to\r\nhis having incurred the displeasure of the Old Buddha at a time when her\r\nnerves were not particularly good, and when she was therefore liable to\r\nhasty decisions. As to the House of Cheng, the holder of the title in\r\n1900 committed suicide on the day when the Allies entered the city, a\r\ndisappointed patriot of the best Manchu model.\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi’s wrath against Su Shun found further vent three years after his\r\ndeath in a Decree which debarred his sons and descendants from ever\r\nholding public office, this punishment being inflicted on the ground that\r\nhe had allowed personal spite to influence him, when consulted by the\r\nEmperor Hsien-Feng regarding the penalty to be inflicted on an offending\r\nrival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST REGENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the collapse of the Tsai Yüan conspiracy, and the stern justice\r\nadministered to its leaders, rendered Yehonala’s position secure\r\nand made her _de facto_ ruler of the Empire (for her colleague was,\r\npolitically speaking, a negligible quantity, or nearly so), she was\r\nextremely careful, during the first years of the Regency, to avoid all\r\nconspicuous assumption of power and to keep herself and her ambitions\r\nin the background, while she omitted no opportunity of improving her\r\nknowledge of the art of government and of gaining the support of China’s\r\nleading officials. For this reason all the Decrees of this period are\r\nissued in the name of the Emperor, and Tzŭ Hsi’s assumption of authority\r\nwas even less conspicuous than during her period of retirement at the\r\nSummer Palace after the conclusion of Kuang-Hsü’s minority. The first\r\nRegency (1861-1873) may be described as Tzŭ Hsi’s tentative period of\r\nrule, in which she tasted the sweets, while avoiding the appearance, of\r\npower. During the second Regency (1875-1889), while her name appeared\r\nonly occasionally as the author of Imperial Decrees, she was careful to\r\nkeep in her hands all official appointments, the granting of rewards and\r\npunishments and other matters of internal politics calculated to increase\r\nher personal popularity and prestige with the mandarinate. The “curtain\r\nwas not suspended” during Kuang-Hsü’s minority, as he was the nominee\r\nof the Empresses, whereas the Emperor T’ung-Chih held his mandate direct\r\nfrom the late Emperor, his father. It was not until the final Regency\r\n(1898-1908), which was not a Regency at all in the strict sense of the\r\nword but an usurpation of the Imperial prerogative during the lifetime of\r\nthe sovereign, that, assured of the strength of her position, she gave\r\nfull rein to her love of power and, with something of the contempt which\r\nsprings from long familiarity, took unto herself all the outward and\r\nvisible signs of Imperial authority, holding audience daily in the Great\r\nHall of the Palace, seated on the Dragon Throne, with the puppet Emperor\r\nrelegated to a position of inferiority, recognised and acclaimed as the\r\nOld Buddha, the sole and undisputed ruler of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of her career, she appears to have realised that the idea\r\nof female rulers had never been popular with the Chinese people; that\r\neven the Empress Wu of the eighth century, the greatest woman in Chinese\r\nhistory, was regarded as a usurper. She was aware that the Empress Lü\r\n(whose character, as described by historians, was not unlike her own), to\r\nwhom was due the consolidation of power that marked the rise of the Han\r\nDynasty, enjoys but scant respect from posterity. On the other hand, she\r\nknew—for the study of history was her pastime—that the Empresses Dowagers\r\nof the past had often wielded supreme power in the State, principles and\r\nprecedents notwithstanding, and their example she determined to follow.\r\nUpon the taking off of the three chief conspirators, the Censors and\r\nMinisters urged her to deal in similar drastic fashion with their aiders\r\nand abettors, and Prince Kung was anxious, if not for revenge, at least\r\nfor precautions being taken against those who had had the ear of the\r\nlate Emperor during the last months of his reign. But Yehonala showed\r\nstatesmanlike forbearance: early in life she realised that a few victims\r\nare better than many, and that lives spared often mean whole families of\r\nfriends. After cashiering Prince Yi’s remaining colleagues of the Grand\r\nCouncil, she dealt leniently with other offenders. When, for instance,\r\nChen Tu-en, President of the Board of Civil Appointments, was impeached\r\non the ground that it was he who had first persuaded the Emperor to\r\nflee to Jehol against her advice, and that, after the Emperor’s death,\r\nhe alone of all the high officials at the capital had been summoned to\r\nJehol by the usurping Regents, she contented herself with removing him\r\nfrom office, though his guilt was clearly proved. Another official, a\r\nMinister of the Household, who had endeavoured to further the aims of the\r\nconspirators, by dissuading Hsien-Feng from returning to Peking in the\r\nspring of 1861, on the plea that an insurrection was impending, was also\r\ncashiered. But there was nothing in the nature of a general proscription,\r\nin spite of the pecuniary and other advantages which usually commend\r\nretaliation to the party in power at Peking. In an able Decree, Tzŭ Hsi\r\nlet it be understood that she wished to punish a few only, and those\r\nchiefly _pour encourager les autres_. It was always a characteristic of\r\nhers that, when her ends were safely secured, she adopted a policy of\r\nwatchful leniency: _moderata durant_. In this instance she was fully\r\naware of the fact that Tsai Yüan and his colleagues would never have\r\nhad the opportunities, nor the courage, to conspire for the Regency\r\nhad they not been assured of the sympathy and support of many of the\r\nhigher officials, but she preferred to let the iron hand rest in its\r\nvelvet glove unless openly thwarted. She would have no proscriptions,\r\nno wreaking of private grudges and revenges. It was this characteristic\r\nof hers that, as will be seen in another place, obtained for her,\r\namongst the people of Peking in particular, a reputation for almost\r\nquixotic gentleness, a reputation which we find expressed in frequent\r\nreferences to the “Benign Countenance,” or “Benevolent Mother,” and which\r\nundoubtedly represented certain genuine impulses in her complex nature.\r\nSo, having crushed the conspiracy, she contented herself with exhorting\r\nall concerned to “attend henceforth strictly to their duty, avoiding\r\nthose sycophantic and evil tendencies which had brought Chen Tu-en and\r\nHuang Tsung-ban to their disgrace.” In another Decree she emphasised the\r\nprinciple that sins of omission are not much less grave than overt acts,\r\nroundly censuring the Princes and Ministers of her Government for having\r\nfailed to denounce the conspirators at once, and charging them with\r\ncowardice. It was fear and nothing else, she said, that had prevented\r\nthem from revealing the truth; and then, with one of those naïve touches\r\nwhich makes Chinese Edicts a perpetual feast, she added that, should\r\nthere be any further plots of usurpers, she would expect to be informed\r\nof their proceedings without delay. Above all, she bade the Imperial Clan\r\ntake warning by the fate of the three conspirators, and intimated that\r\nany further attempts of this kind would be far more severely dealt with.\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps of the Regency was to determine the title of the\r\nnew reign. The usurping Princes had selected the characters “Chi-Hsiang,”\r\nmeaning “well-omened happiness,” but to Yehonala’s scholarly taste and\r\nfine sense of fitness, the title seemed ill-chosen and redundant, and\r\nas she wished to obliterate all memory of the usurpers’ _régime_, she\r\nchose in its place the characters “T’ung-Chih,” meaning “all-pervading\r\ntranquillity,” probably with one eye on the suppression of the rebellion\r\nand the other on the chances of peace in the Forbidden City. As far as\r\nall good augury for the Emperor himself was concerned, one title was, as\r\nevents proved, no more likely to be effective than the other.\r\n\r\nOn the same day as the proclamation of the new reign was made by Edict,\r\nthe Empresses Dowager issued a Decree explaining, and ostensibly\r\ndeprecating, the high honour thrust upon them.\r\n\r\n    “Our assumption of the Regency was utterly contrary to our\r\n    wishes, but we have complied with the urgent request of our\r\n    Princes and Ministers, because we realise that it is essential\r\n    that there should be a higher authority to whom they may\r\n    refer. So soon as ever the Emperor shall have completed his\r\n    education, we shall take no further part in the Government,\r\n    which will then naturally revert to the system prescribed by\r\n    all dynastic tradition. Our sincere reluctance in assuming the\r\n    direction of affairs must be manifest to all. Our officials are\r\n    expected loyally to assist us in the arduous task which we have\r\n    undertaken.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXTERIOR OF THE CH’IEN CH’ING PALACE.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Ogawa, Tokio._]\r\n\r\nFollowing upon this, a Decree was issued in the name of the Emperor,\r\nwhich represented the boy as thanking their Majesties the Regents and\r\npromising that, so soon as he came of age, he would endeavour, by dutiful\r\nministrations, to prove his gratitude.\r\n\r\nFor the procedure of Government it was then arranged that the Empresses\r\nshould daily hold joint audiences in the side Hall of the main Palace.\r\nAt these, and at all except the great Court ceremonies, the Emperor’s\r\ngreat-uncle and four brothers were excused from performing the “kotow,”\r\nthe Emperor’s respect for the senior generation being thus indirectly\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\nUpon their acceptance of the Regency, honorific titles were conferred\r\nupon both Empresses. Each character in these titles represents a grant\r\nfrom the public funds of 100,000 taels per annum (say, at that time,\r\n£20,000). Thus the Empress Consort became known by the title of Tzŭ\r\nAn (Motherly and Restful) while Yehonala became Tzŭ Hsi (Motherly and\r\nAuspicious), one being the Empress of the Eastern, and the other of\r\nthe Western Palace. At various subsequent periods, further honorific\r\ncharacters, in pairs, were added unto them, so that, on her seventieth\r\nbirthday, Tzŭ Hsi was the proud possessor of sixteen. On that occasion\r\nshe modestly and virtuously refused the four additional characters\r\nwith which the Emperor Kuang-Hsü (not unprompted) desired to honour\r\nher. Tzŭ An lived to receive ten in all; both ladies received two on\r\ntheir thirtieth birthdays, two on the Emperor T’ung-Chih’s accession,\r\ntwo just before his death in recognition of their “ministrations”\r\nduring his attack of small-pox, and two on their fortieth birthdays.\r\nTzŭ Hsi received two more on her fiftieth birthday, two on Kuang-Hsü’s\r\nmarriage, and two on her sixtieth birthday. Tzŭ Hsi’s complete official\r\ndesignation at the end of her life was not easy to remember. It ran,\r\n“Tzŭ-Hsi-Tuan-yu-K’ang-yi-Chao-yu-Chuang-ch’eng-Shou-kung-Ch’in-hsien-\r\nCh’ung-hsi-Huang Tai-hou,” which, being translated, means “The Empress\r\nDowager, motherly, auspicious, orthodox, heaven-blessed, prosperous,\r\nall-nourishing, brightly manifest, calm, sedate, perfect, long-lived,\r\nrespectful, reverend, worshipful, illustrious and exalted.”\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Regency it suited Yehonala to conciliate and\r\nhumour Prince Kung. In conjunction with her colleague, she therefore\r\nbestowed upon him the titles of “I-Cheng Wang,” or Prince Adviser to the\r\nGovernment, and by special Decree she made the title of “Ch’in Wang,”\r\nor Prince of the Blood (which had been bestowed upon him by the late\r\nEmperor), hereditary in his family for ever.[11] Prince Kung begged to\r\nbe excused from accepting the former honour, whereupon ensued a solemn\r\nparade of refusal on the part of the Empresses, one of whom, as events\r\nproved, certainly wanted no adviser. Eventually, after much deprecation,\r\nTheir Majesties gave way as regards the hereditary title, but on the\r\nunderstanding that the offer would be renewed at a more fitting season.\r\nYehonala who, in her better moments of grateful memory, could scarcely\r\nforget the brave part which Prince Kung had played for her at Jehol, made\r\namends by adopting his daughter as a Princess Imperial, granting her the\r\nuse of the Yellow palanquin. The influence of this Princess over Tzŭ Hsi,\r\nespecially towards the end, was great, and it was strikingly displayed\r\nin 1900 on behalf of Prince Tuan and the Boxer leaders.\r\n\r\nIgnorant at the outset of many things in the procedure of Government\r\nroutine, feeling her way through the labyrinth of party politics and\r\nforeign affairs, afraid of her own youth and inexperience, it was but\r\nnatural that Tzŭ Hsi should have recourse to the ripe wisdom of the\r\nlate Emperor’s brother and be guided by his opinion. But as time went\r\non, as her knowledge of affairs broadened and deepened, her autocratic\r\ninstincts gradually asserted themselves in an increasing impatience\r\nof advice and restraint. As, by the study of history and the light of\r\nher own intelligence, she gained confidence in the handling of State\r\nbusiness and men, the guidance which had previously been welcome became\r\ndistasteful, and eventually assumed the character of interference.\r\nDespotic by nature, Tzŭ Hsi was not the woman to tolerate interference in\r\nany matter where her own mind was made up, and Prince Kung, on his side,\r\nwas of a disposition little less proud and independent than her own. When\r\nthe young Yehonala began to evince a disposition to dispense with his\r\nadvice, he was therefore not inclined to conceal his displeasure, and\r\nrelations speedily became strained. As Tzŭ Hsi was at no pains to hide\r\nher resentment, he gradually came to adopt a policy of instigating her\r\ncolleague, the Empress of the East, to a more independent attitude, a\r\nline of action which could not fail to produce ill-feeling and friction\r\nin the Palace. In the appointment of officials, also, which is the chief\r\nobject and privilege of power in China, he was in the habit of promoting\r\nand protecting his own nominees without reference to Yehonala, by direct\r\ncommunications to the provinces. Eye-witnesses of the events of the\r\nperiod have recorded their impression that his attitude towards both\r\nEmpresses at the commencement of the Regency was somewhat overbearing;\r\nthat he was inclined to presume upon the importance of his own position\r\nand services, and that on one occasion at audience, he even presumed to\r\ninform the Empresses that they owed their position to himself, a remark\r\nwhich Tzŭ Hsi was not likely to forget or forgive.\r\n\r\nAt the audiences of the Grand Council, it was the custom for the\r\ntwo Empresses to sit on a raised daïs, each on her separate Throne,\r\nimmediately in front of which was suspended a yellow silk curtain;\r\nthey were therefore invisible to the Councillors, who were received\r\nseparately and in the order of their seniority, Prince Kung coming first\r\nin his capacity as “adviser to the Government.” Beside their Majesties\r\non the daïs stood their attendant eunuchs; they were in the habit of\r\npeeping through the folds of the curtain, keeping a careful eye upon the\r\ndemeanour of the officials in audience, with a view to noting any signs\r\nof disrespect or breach of etiquette. Strictly speaking, no official,\r\nhowever high his rank, might enter the Throne room unless summoned by the\r\nchief eunuch in attendance, but Prince Kung considered himself superior\r\nto such rules, and would enter unannounced. Other breaches of etiquette\r\nhe committed which, as Her Majesty’s knowledge of affairs increased,\r\nwere carefully noted against him; for instance, he would raise his voice\r\nwhen replying to their Majesties’ instructions (which were always given\r\nby Tzŭ Hsi), and on one occasion, he even ventured to ask that Tzŭ Hsi\r\nshould repeat something she had just said, and which he pretended not to\r\nhave understood. His attitude, in short (say the chroniclers), implied an\r\nassumption of equality which the proud spirit of the young Empress would\r\nnot brook. Living outside the Palace as he did, having free intercourse\r\nwith Chinese and foreign officials on all sides, he was naturally in\r\na position to intrigue against her, did he so desire. Tzŭ Hsi, on the\r\nother hand, was likely to imagine and exaggerate intrigues, since nearly\r\nall her information came from the eunuchs and would therefore naturally\r\nassume alarming proportions. There is little doubt that she gradually\r\ncame to believe in the possibility of Prince Kung working against\r\nher authority, and she therefore set herself to prove to him that his\r\nposition and prerogatives depended entirely upon her good will.\r\n\r\nShe continued watching her opportunity and patiently biding her time\r\nuntil the occasion presented itself in the fourth year of the Regency\r\n(April, 1865). In a moment of absent-mindedness or bravado, Prince Kung\r\nventured to rise from his knees during an audience, thus violating\r\na fundamental rule of etiquette originally instituted to guard the\r\nSovereign against any sudden attack. The eunuchs promptly informed their\r\nMajesties, whereupon Tzŭ Hsi called loudly for help, exclaiming that\r\nthe Prince was plotting some evil treachery against the persons of the\r\nRegents. The Guards rushed in, and Prince Kung was ordered to leave\r\nthe presence at once. His departure was speedily followed by the issue\r\nof an Imperial Decree, stating that he had endeavoured to usurp the\r\nauthority of the Throne and persistently overrated his own importance to\r\nthe State. He was accordingly dismissed from his position as adviser to\r\nthe Government, relieved of his duties on the Grand Council and other\r\nhigh offices in the Palace; even his appointment as head of the Foreign\r\nOffice, or Tsungli Yamên, was cancelled. “He had shown himself unworthy\r\nof their Majesties’ confidence,” said the Edict, “and had displayed\r\ngross nepotism in the appointment of high officials: his rebellious and\r\nusurping tendencies must be sternly checked.”\r\n\r\nA month later, however, Tzŭ Hsi, realising that her own position was\r\nnot unassailable, and that her treatment of this powerful Prince had\r\ncreated much unfavourable comment at Court and in the provinces, saved\r\nher face and the situation simultaneously, by issuing a Decree in the\r\nname of herself and her colleague, which she described as a Decree of\r\nexplanation. In this document she took no small credit to herself for\r\nstrength of character and virtue in dealing severely with her near\r\nkinsmen in the interests of the State, and pointed to the fact that\r\nany undue encouragement of the Imperial clansmen, when inclined to take\r\na line of their own, was liable, as history had repeatedly proved,\r\nto involve the country in destructive dissension. Her real object\r\nin inflicting punishment on the Prince for treating the Throne with\r\ndisrespect was to save him from himself and from the imminent peril of\r\nhis own folly. But now that several Memorials had been sent in by Censors\r\nand others, requesting that his errors be pardoned, the Throne could have\r\nno possible objection to showing clemency and, the position having been\r\nmade clear, Prince Kung was restored to the position of Chamberlain, and\r\nto the direction of the Foreign Office. The Prince, in fact, needed a\r\nlesson in politeness and, having got it, Her Majesty was prepared to let\r\nbygones be bygones, it being clearly understood that, for the future,\r\nhe should display increased energy and loyalty as a mark of his sincere\r\ngratitude to their Majesties.\r\n\r\nA week later, Tzŭ Hsi, in order to drive the lesson home, issued the\r\nfollowing Decree in the name of the Empresses Regent.\r\n\r\n    “We granted an audience this morning to Prince Kung in order\r\n    to permit him to return thanks for his re-appointment. He\r\n    prostrated himself humbly and wept bitterly, in token of his\r\n    boundless self-abasement. We naturally took occasion to address\r\n    to him some further words of warning and advice, and the Prince\r\n    seemed genuinely grieved at his errors and full of remorse for\r\n    misconduct which he freely acknowledged. Sincere feeling of\r\n    this kind could not fail to elicit our compassion.\r\n\r\n    “It is now some years since we first assumed the burden of\r\n    the Regency and appointed Prince Kung to be our chief adviser\r\n    in the Government; in this position his responsibility has\r\n    been as great as the favour which we have bestowed upon him.\r\n    The position which he has occupied in special relation to the\r\n    Throne, is unparalleled; therefore we expected much from him\r\n    and, when he erred, the punishment which we were compelled to\r\n    inflict upon him was necessarily severe. He has now repented\r\n    him of the evil and acknowledged his sins. For our part we\r\n    had no prejudice in this matter, and were animated only by\r\n    strict impartiality; it was inconceivable that we should desire\r\n    to treat harshly a Councillor of such tried ability, or to\r\n    deprive ourselves of the valuable assistance of the Prince.\r\n    We therefore now restore him to the Grand Council, but in\r\n    order that his authority may be reduced, we do not propose to\r\n    reinstate him in his position as ‘adviser to the Government.’\r\n    Prince Kung, see to it now that you forget not the shame\r\n    and remorse which have overtaken you! Strive to requite our\r\n    kindness and display greater self-control in the performance of\r\n    your duties! Justify our high confidence in you by ridding your\r\n    mind of all unjust suspicions and fears.”\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of this year, 1865, took place the burial of the late\r\nEmperor, Hsien-Feng, the preparation of whose tomb had been proceeding\r\nfor just four years. With him was buried his consort Sakota, who had\r\ndied in 1850, a month before her husband’s accession to the Throne; her\r\nremains had been awaiting burial at a village temple, seven miles west\r\nof the capital, for fifteen years. As usual, the funeral ceremonies and\r\npreparation of the tombs involved vast expenditure, and there had been\r\nconsiderable difficulty in finding the necessary funds, for the southern\r\nprovinces, which, under ordinary circumstances would have made the\r\nlargest contributions, were still suffering severely from the ravages\r\nof the Taiping rebellion. The Emperor’s mausoleum had cost nominally\r\nten million taels, of which amount, of course, a very large proportion\r\nhad been diverted for the benefit of the officials of the Household and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe young Emperor, and the Empresses Regent proceeded, as in duty bound,\r\nto the Eastern Tombs to take their part in the solemn burial ceremonies.\r\nPrince Kung was in attendance; to him had fallen the chief part in the\r\npreparation of the tomb and in the provision of the funds, and Her\r\nMajesty had no cause to complain of any scamping of his duties. The body\r\nof the Emperor, in an Imperial coffin of catalpa wood, richly lacquered\r\nand inscribed with Buddhist sutras, was borne within the huge domed grave\r\nchamber, and there deposited in the presence of their Majesties upon its\r\n“jewelled bedstead,” the pedestal of precious metals prepared to receive\r\nit. In the place of the concubines and eunuchs, who in prehistoric days\r\nused to be buried alive with the deceased monarch, wooden and paper\r\nfigures of life size were placed beside the coffin, reverently kneeling\r\nto serve their lord in the halls of Hades. The huge candles were lighted,\r\nprayers were recited, and a great wealth of valuable ornaments arranged\r\nwithin the grave chamber; gold and jade sceptres, and a necklace of\r\npearls were placed in the coffin. And when all was duly done, the great\r\ndoor of the chamber was slowly lowered and sealed in its place.\r\n\r\nNext day the Empresses Dowager issued a Decree in which Prince Kung’s\r\nmeritorious acts are graciously recognised, and their Majesties’ thanks\r\naccorded to him for the satisfactory fulfilment of the funeral ceremonies.\r\n\r\n    “Prince Kung has for the last five years been preparing the\r\n    funeral arrangements for his late Majesty and has shown a due\r\n    sense of decorum and diligence. To-day, both the late Emperor\r\n    and his senior consort have been conveyed to their last resting\r\n    place, and the great burden of our grief has been to some\r\n    extent mitigated by our satisfaction in contemplating the\r\n    grandeur of their tombs, and the solemn ceremonies of their\r\n    burial. No doubt but that the spirit of His Majesty in Heaven\r\n    has also been comforted thereby. We now feel bound to act in\r\n    accordance with the fraternal affection which always animated\r\n    the deceased Emperor towards Prince Kung, and to bestow upon\r\n    him high honours. But the Prince has repeatedly declined to\r\n    accept any further dignities, lest perchance he should again\r\n    be tempted to arrogance. His modesty meets with our approval,\r\n    and we therefore merely refer his name to the Imperial Clan\r\n    Court, for the selection of a reward. But we place on record\r\n    the fact that as Grand Councillor he has been of great service\r\n    to us, and has of late displayed notable circumspection and\r\n    self-restraint in all matters.\r\n\r\n    “The Decree which we issued last Spring was caused by the\r\n    Prince’s want of attention to small details of etiquette, and\r\n    if we were obliged to punish him severely, our motives have\r\n    been clearly explained. No doubt everyone in the Empire is\r\n    well aware of the facts, but as posterity may possibly fail to\r\n    realise all the circumstances, and as unjust blame might fall\r\n    upon the memory of Prince Kung, if that Decree were allowed to\r\n    remain inscribed amongst the Imperial Archives, thus suggesting\r\n    a flaw in the white jade of his good name, we now command that\r\n    the Decree in which we announced Prince Kung’s dismissal from\r\n    office be expunged from the annals of our reign. Thus is our\r\n    affection displayed towards a deserving servant, and his good\r\n    name preserved untarnished to all time.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress Dowager was essentially a woman of moods, and these Imperial\r\nDecrees simply reflect the fact, at the beginning of her autocratic\r\nrule, as they did until its close. Four years later Prince Kung was to\r\nincur her deep and permanent dislike by conspiring with her colleague to\r\ndeprive her of her favourite, the chief eunuch An Te-hai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTSENG KUO-FAN AND THE TAIPING REBELLION (1864)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first years of Yehonala’s Co-Regency, during which she was steadily\r\nacquiring the arts and crafts of Government, and gradually relegating\r\nher easy-going colleague to the background, were joyfully associated\r\nin the minds of her subjects with the decline and final collapse of\r\nthe great rebellion which had devastated the best part of the Empire\r\nsince 1850. Chinese historians (a body of writers who depend largely\r\non each others’ writings for material) agree in attributing the final\r\ndeliverance from this scourge to the ability and courage of the famous\r\nViceroy Tseng Kuo-fan,[12] and for once their praises are well-deserved,\r\nfor this military scholar like his fellow provincial and colleague, Tso\r\nTsung-t’ang,[13] was a man of the heroic breed of philosophers which,\r\nwith all its faults, the Confucian system has always produced, and\r\ncontinues to produce, to the great benefit of the Chinese people, a man\r\nwhose name ranks high among China’s worthies, a household word for\r\nhonesty and intelligent patriotism.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the secrets of Tzŭ Hsi’s success as a ruler that she\r\nrecognised and appreciated merit whenever she found it, and especially\r\nthe merit of a military commander: it was only when she allowed her\r\nsuperstitious tendencies to outweigh her judgment that she failed. For\r\nthe character and talents of Tseng Kuo-fan she had the highest respect,\r\ndue, no doubt, in the first instance to the effect of his military\r\ndespatches, stirring tales of camp and siege, on her imaginative mind,\r\nbut later to personal acquaintance with his sterling qualities. With the\r\nsingle exception of Jung Lu, probably no high official ever stood so\r\nhigh in her affectionate esteem, and Jung Lu was a Manchu kinsman, while\r\nTseng came from one of the proverbially independent gentry families of\r\nHunan. From a Chinese narrative of the Taiping rebellion, we are able\r\nto obtain a very clear impression, not only of Tseng’s character and of\r\nhis conception of patriotism but also of the remarkable and undisputed\r\nposition of autocratic power already at that time enjoyed by the youthful\r\nEmpress Tzŭ Hsi. Before turning to this narrative, however, certain\r\npoints in connection with the final defeat of the Taipings deserve to\r\nbe noted, events with which Englishmen were prominently identified, but\r\nwhich, as recorded by British eye-witnesses, confirm our doubts as to the\r\nhistorical value of Imperial Edicts and Chinese official despatches.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Hsien-Feng had died in exile and defeat at Jehol in August\r\n1861. The Summer Palace had been destroyed by the British and French\r\nforces, peace had been restored, and the Co-Regency of the Empresses\r\nDowager had commenced. One of the first acts of Prince Kung, in his\r\ncapacity as “Adviser to the Government” after the conclusion of the\r\nPeace Convention of October 1860, was to invoke the aid of his country’s\r\nconquering invaders against the Chinese rebels, whose strong position\r\non the Yangtsze was causing the Court ever increasing anxiety. It is\r\nan illuminating example of Chinese methods of government, not without\r\nparallels and value to-day, that even while the British and French\r\nforces were concentrating at Shanghai for their invasion of north China,\r\nhigh Chinese officials in the Yangtsze provinces had not hesitated to\r\ninvoke their aid against the rebels, and had been chagrined at a refusal\r\nwhich appeared to them unwise since it ignored the interests of British\r\ntrade at its most important centre. The history of the “Ever-Victorious\r\nArmy” need not be referred to here. It kept the rebels in check in the\r\nprovince of Kiangsu throughout the year 1862, and in February 1863 the\r\nBritish Government sanctioned the lending of “Chinese Gordon” to take\r\ncommand of that force, which was speedily to turn the tide of war in\r\nfavour of the Imperialists and effectively to pave the way for Tseng\r\nKuo-fan’s final restoration of law and order. Soochow, the provincial\r\ncapital, was regained in December 1863, and in the following July the\r\nfall of the rebel capital (Nanking) and the death of the rebel “King”\r\npractically ended the insurrection. A considerable number of Europeans,\r\nincluding a French Admiral, had given their lives to win back China\r\nfor the Manchu Dynasty, although at the outset public opinion was in\r\nfavour of strict neutrality and there were many, even then, who thought\r\nChina would be well rid of her degenerate rulers: nevertheless, the\r\ntriumphant Edict in which is recorded Tseng Kuo-fan’s capture of Nanking\r\ncontains no word of reference to Gordon and the invaluable help which he\r\nrendered, and, as will be seen, Tseng’s only reference to the British\r\nCommander is to accuse him of having recommended the inhuman treatment\r\nof a defenceless prisoner. In accordance with the invariable classical\r\ntradition, he ascribes his success to “the consummate virtue and wisdom”\r\nof the late Emperor Hsien-Feng; the tradition represents, in conventional\r\nphraseology, the Oriental conception of the divine right of kings,\r\nand their infallibility (a conception which we find reproduced almost\r\nverbatim in the modern Japanese Generals’ modest reports of their\r\ngreatest victories), and it is incompatible in China with any reference\r\nto the existence, much less the services, of foreign barbarians. The\r\nfact is worth noting, for Tseng was an exceptionally intelligent and\r\ncourageous man who could, sooner than most men, have ventured on a new\r\ndeparture; and he knew full well that this same Gordon, who had steadily\r\ndriven the rebels before him, cane in hand for over a year, had come\r\nhot-foot to the task from the sacking of the Manchu sovereigns’ Summer\r\nPalace!\r\n\r\nBut Yehonala’s joy at the fall of Nanking was unfeignedly great, and the\r\nDecree in which, in the name of the boy Emperor, she records the event\r\nand rewards the victors, is a brilliant example of her literary style. We\r\ntake the following extracts from this document, as of permanent interest\r\nand throwing light on the character of Tzŭ Hsi.\r\n\r\n    _Decree on the Fall of Nanking._\r\n\r\n    “An express courier from Tseng Kuo-fan, travelling two hundred\r\n    miles a day, has just arrived, bearing the red banner of\r\n    decisive victory and a Memorial describing the capture of\r\n    Nanking, the suicide by burning of the rebel Prince, the\r\n    complete destruction of the Taiping host and the capture of\r\n    two of their leading commanders. Perusal of this Memorial\r\n    fills us with the deepest joy and gratitude, which all our\r\n    people will share. The leader of the long haired rebels[14]\r\n    Hung Hsiu-ch’uan first raised his standard of revolt in the\r\n    thirtieth year of Tao-Kuang (1850); from Kuangsi the movement\r\n    spread gradually through Hunan, Hupei and the Yangtsze\r\n    provinces to Chihli itself and Shantung, until scarcely a\r\n    spot in the whole Empire but bore the footprints of the rebel\r\n    armies. In the third year of Hsien-Feng (1853) they took\r\n    Nanking and there established the seat of their Government.\r\n    Uncounted thousands of our subjects have fallen victims to\r\n    their savage crimes. The cup of their guilt has indeed\r\n    overflowed. Gods and men alike hold them in abhorrence.\r\n\r\n    “Our Imperial father, in the majesty of his wrath, and in all\r\n    reverence to Heaven, began a punitive campaign against them and\r\n    named Kuan Wen, the Viceroy of Wu-Ch’ang, to be his Imperial\r\n    Commissioner for the war. This officer successfully cleared\r\n    the Hupei region of rebels and then marched eastwards towards\r\n    Kiangsu in order to extirpate them there also. Later, Tseng\r\n    Kuo-fan was made Viceroy of Nanking and Imperial Commissioner\r\n    for the campaign in Kiangsu and Anhui, and he achieved great\r\n    results, proportionate to his high responsibility.\r\n\r\n    “On the death of our late father (1861), half the cities of\r\n    Kiangsu and Chekiang had been retaken by our forces, and it was\r\n    a source of grief to His Majesty, recorded in his valedictory\r\n    Decree, that he could not have lived to see the end of the\r\n    rebellion. Upon our succeeding to the goodly heritage of the\r\n    Throne, obeying our late father’s commands and listening to the\r\n    sage counsel of the Empresses Regent, we promoted Tseng Kuo-fan\r\n    to be an Assistant Grand Secretary and gave him full powers as\r\n    Commander-in-Chief over the four provinces of Kiangsu, Kiangsi,\r\n    Anhui and Chekiang, so as to secure an undivided plan of\r\n    campaign.\r\n\r\n    “Ever since his appointment he has adopted a policy of\r\n    masterful strategy in combination with the forces of P’eng\r\n    Yu-lin and Tseng Kuo-ch’uan,[15] attacking the rebels both by\r\n    land and by water. Over a hundred cities have been recaptured\r\n    and over a hundred thousand rebels, who were advancing to the\r\n    relief of Nanking, have been slain and ‘their left ears cut\r\n    off.’[16] Nanking was thus completely invested and its relief\r\n    became impossible. Early this month the outer defences of the\r\n    city were taken and some thirty thousand rebels put to the\r\n    sword, but their so-called King and his desperate followers\r\n    were still at bay in the inner city, fighting fiercely to the\r\n    end.\r\n\r\n    “Tseng Kuo-fan now reports that after the capture by our troops\r\n    of the outer city ramparts, the rebels greatly strengthened\r\n    the inner defences. Our men succeeded in taking the ‘Dragon’s\r\n    Elbow’ hill and a general bombardment followed. Mining and\r\n    counter-mining went on furiously in the vicinity of the chief\r\n    forts amidst desperate encounters. At dawn on the 16th all our\r\n    forces were collected, and by springing a mine under the wall\r\n    of the city a breach was made some sixty yards in width. Our\r\n    men rushed the gap, burst into the city and were advancing on\r\n    all sides when the rebels from the wall exploded a magazine,\r\n    and many of our men were slain. A panic was only averted by our\r\n    leaders cutting down a number of those who were attempting to\r\n    fly.\r\n\r\n[_Here follows a detailed description of the fighting, which we omit._]\r\n\r\n    “By 1 A.M. flames were bursting from the Palace of the\r\n    ‘Heavenly King’ and the residences of other rebel leaders. One\r\n    of them rushed from the main Palace Hall with one thousand\r\n    followers and sought refuge in some houses near the south\r\n    gate of the city. After some seven hundred of his men had\r\n    been slain, he was captured, and on his person were found two\r\n    Imperial seals of jade and one official seal of gold. At 3 A.M.\r\n    about a thousand of the rebels, disguised in our uniforms,\r\n    escaped through the tunnel at the Gate of Heavenly Peace\r\n    but our cavalry pursued them and captured or destroyed the\r\n    whole force at Hu-Shu chen, where their leader, the ‘Glorious\r\n    Prince,’ was taken alive. On being examined, this leader whose\r\n    name was Li Wan-ts’ai, admitted that seven of the so-called\r\n    Princes of the Taipings had been slain by our forces, while\r\n    seeking to escape under cover of darkness, on the night of our\r\n    entrance into the city.\r\n\r\n    “According to the evidence of other rebels, the arch-leader\r\n    Hung Hsiu-ch’uan, had committed suicide by taking poison a\r\n    month before. He had been buried in the court-yard of his\r\n    Palace, and his son, the so-called Boy-Prince, had succeeded\r\n    to the usurped title. He also had committed suicide by burning\r\n    when the city fell. Another of their chiefs, one Li Hsiu-cheng,\r\n    had been wounded and was in hiding at a spot near by, where our\r\n    men found him together with the elder brother of the ‘Heavenly\r\n    King.’ During these three days, over a hundred thousand rebels\r\n    were killed, of whom some three thousand were their so-called\r\n    Princes, generals, and high officers.\r\n\r\n    “This glorious victory is entirely due to the bountiful\r\n    protection of Heaven, to the ever-present help of our\r\n    Ancestors, and to the foresight and wisdom of the Empresses\r\n    Regent, who, by employing and promoting efficient leaders for\r\n    their armies, have thus secured co-operation of all our forces\r\n    and the accomplishment of this great achievement, whereby the\r\n    soul of our late father in Heaven must be comforted, and the\r\n    desire of all people fulfilled. For ourselves we feel utterly\r\n    unworthy of this crowning triumph, and we are truly distressed\r\n    at the thought that our late father could not live to witness\r\n    this consummation of his unfinished plans. This rebellion has\r\n    now lasted fifteen years, during twelve of which Nanking has\r\n    been held by the rebels. They have devastated about a dozen\r\n    provinces, and have captured some hundreds of cities. Their\r\n    final defeat we owe to our Generals, ‘who have been combed by\r\n    the wind and bathed in the rain,’ and who have undergone every\r\n    conceivable hardship in bringing about the destruction of these\r\n    unspeakable traitors. We are therefore bound to recognise their\r\n    exceptional services by the bestowal of exceptional rewards.\r\n    Tseng Kuo-fan first contributed to this glorious end by\r\n    raising a force of militia in Hunan and a fleet of war-vessels\r\n    with which he won great victories, saving his province from\r\n    complete ruin. He re-captured Wu-Ch’ang, cleared the whole\r\n    province of Kiangsi, and, advancing eastwards, recovered city\r\n    after city. That glorious success has finally crowned our\r\n    efforts is due chiefly to his masterly strategy and courage,\r\n    to his employment of able subordinates and to his remarkable\r\n    powers of organisation. We now confer upon him the title of\r\n    Senior Guardian of the Throne, a marquisate of the first rank,\r\n    hereditary in perpetuity, and the decoration of the double-eyed\r\n    peacock’s feather.\r\n\r\n[_Here follows a long list of officers rewarded, beginning with Tseng\r\nKuo-fan’s brother, above mentioned, who was given an earldom._]\r\n\r\n    “As soon as the troops have found the body of the usurper\r\n    known as the ‘Heavenly King,’ Hung Hsiu-ch’uan, let it be\r\n    dismembered forthwith and let the head be sent for exhibition\r\n    in every province that has been ravaged by his rebellion, in\r\n    order that the public indignation may be appeased. As to the\r\n    two captured leaders, let them be sent in cages to Peking, in\r\n    order that they may be examined and then punished with death by\r\n    the lingering process.”\r\n\r\nA further Decree announced that the Emperor would go in person to offer\r\nthanksgiving and sacrifice at all Imperial Temples and shrines, and make\r\nsacrifice to deities of the chief mountains and rivers of the Empire.\r\n\r\nA Chinese diarist of the rebellion, referring to the manner in which the\r\n‘Heavenly King’ met his death, says:—\r\n\r\n    “From the moment that the Imperialists captured Ch’u-yung, the\r\n    rebels, pent up in Nanking like wild beasts in a cage, were\r\n    in a hopeless plight. From the commencement of the 4th Moon,\r\n    the city was completely invested, and without hope of relief.\r\n    They were living on reduced rations of one meagre meal a day.\r\n    The ‘Heavenly King’ caused roots and leaves to be kneaded and\r\n    rolled into pellets which he had served out to his immediate\r\n    followers, the rebel chiefs, saying, ‘This is manna from\r\n    Heaven; for a long time we in the Palace have eaten nothing\r\n    else.’ He gave orders that every household should collect ten\r\n    loads of this stuff for storage in the Palace granaries; some\r\n    of the more ignorant people obeyed the order, but most of the\r\n    rebels ignored it.\r\n\r\n    “The rebel Li Hsiu-ch’eng, known as the ‘Patriotic Prince,’\r\n    escaped from Ch’u-yung and made his way to Nanking. Upon\r\n    entering the city, he had drums beaten and bells rung as a\r\n    signal for the ‘Heavenly King’ and his followers to ascend\r\n    to the Throne Chamber for the discussion of the perilous\r\n    situation. Hung Hsiu-ch’uan came, and boastfully ascending the\r\n    Throne, spake as follows ‘The Most High has issued to me his\r\n    sacred Decree. God the Father, and my Divine elder brother\r\n    (Christ) have commanded me to descend unto this world of flesh\r\n    and to become the one true lord of all nations and kindreds\r\n    upon earth. What cause have I then for fear? Remain with me,\r\n    or leave me, as you choose: my inheritance of this Empire,\r\n    which is even as an iron girdle of defence, will be protected\r\n    by others if you decline to protect it. I have at my command\r\n    an angelic host of a million strong: how then could a hundred\r\n    thousand or so of these unholy Imperialists enter the city’?\r\n    When Li Hsiu-ch’eng heard this nonsensical boasting, he burst\r\n    into tears and left the hall.\r\n\r\n    “But before the middle of the 5th Moon, Hung Hsiu-ch’uan had\r\n    come to realise that the city was doomed, and on the 27th day,\r\n    having abandoned all hope, he procured a deadly poison which he\r\n    mixed with his wine. Then raising the cup on high, he cried,\r\n    ‘It is not that God the Father has deceived me, but it is I who\r\n    have disobeyed God the Father.’ After repeating this several\r\n    times he drank the poison. By midnight the measure of his\r\n    iniquity was full, and, writhing in agony, he died. Even his\r\n    last words showed no true repentance, although they amounted\r\n    to an admission of guilt. When his followers learned what\r\n    had happened, they wrapped his body in a coverlet of yellow\r\n    silk, embroidered with dragons and then, following the rule\r\n    of their religion, buried it, uncoffined, in a corner of the\r\n    Palace ground. They then placed on the Throne the rebel’s son,\r\n    the so-called Boy-Emperor, but they tried to keep secret the\r\n    news of the ‘Heavenly King’s’ death. It eventually leaked out,\r\n    however, and the courage of the besieged dropped to the last\r\n    depths of despair.”\r\n\r\nIn his Memorial to the Throne, Tseng Kuo-fan described the exhumation of\r\nthe rebel Emperor’s body.\r\n\r\n    “Even the feet of the corpse were wrapped in dragon\r\n    embroideries,” he says; “he had a bald head and a beard\r\n    streaked with grey. After examining the body I beheaded it and\r\n    then burnt it on a large bonfire. One of the concubines in the\r\n    usurper’s palace, a woman named Huang, who had herself prepared\r\n    the body for burial, told me that the ‘Heavenly King’ seldom\r\n    showed himself to his Court, so that they were able to keep his\r\n    death a secret for sixteen days. I am sending his bogus seals\r\n    to Peking that they may be deposited in the Imperial Archives\r\n    Department.”\r\n\r\nThe Memorial then proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    “The prisoner Li Hsiu-ch’eng, known as the ‘Patriotic Prince,’\r\n    was minutely cross-examined by myself, and his statement, which\r\n    he wrote out with his own hand, extends to some thirty thousand\r\n    words. He narrated in detail the first causes of the rebellion\r\n    and described the present position of the rebels still at large\r\n    in Shensi and elsewhere. He strongly advised that we should not\r\n    be too hard on the defeated rebels from Kuangtung and Kuangsi,\r\n    on the ground that severity would only lead to an increase of\r\n    the anti-dynastic feeling in those provinces. It seems to me\r\n    that there is much sense in his advice.\r\n\r\n    “All my staff were most anxious that Li Hsiu-ch’eng should be\r\n    sent to Peking in a cage, and even the foreigner Gordon, when\r\n    he called to congratulate me, strongly urged this course. But\r\n    it seems to me that the high prestige of our Sacred Dynasty\r\n    needs no such sending of petty rebels to Peking as trophies or\r\n    prisoners of war. The ‘Heavenly King’s’ head is now being sent\r\n    round those provinces which were laid waste by the rebellion,\r\n    and this should suffice. Besides, I feel that there would be\r\n    some risk of Li starving himself to death on the journey,\r\n    or that a rescue might even be attempted, for this Li was\r\n    extraordinarily popular with the common people. After the\r\n    fall of the city, some peasants gave him shelter, and when\r\n    he was finally captured the people of the village where he\r\n    was taken decoyed and slew one of our men in revenge. After\r\n    he had been put in his cage here, another rebel leader, the\r\n    so-called ‘Pine Prince,’ was brought into camp. As soon as he\r\n    caught sight of Li, he went down on his knees and saluted him\r\n    most respectfully, I therefore decided to behead him and the\r\n    sentence was duly carried out on the 6th instant.\r\n\r\n    “The two elder brothers of the ‘Heavenly King’ were men of a\r\n    cruel and savage nature, who committed many foul and impious\r\n    crimes. Li detested them both heartily. When captured, they\r\n    were in a dazed state, and could only mumble ‘God the Father,\r\n    God the Father.’ As I could get no information from them,\r\n    and as they were sick unto death, I had them both beheaded,\r\n    two days before the execution of Li Hsiu-ch’eng. I am now in\r\n    receipt of your Majesties’ Decree, approving my action and\r\n    ordering me to forward the heads of the three rebel chiefs to\r\n    the various provinces in order that public indignation may be\r\n    appeased. I have duly suspended the heads from long poles, and\r\n    the sight of them has given great and general satisfaction.\r\n\r\n    “And now, victory being ours, I am led to the reflection that\r\n    this our Dynasty surpasses all its predecessors in martial\r\n    glory and has suppressed several rebellions by achievements\r\n    which shed lustre on our history. The Ssŭ-ch’uan and Hupei\r\n    rebellion of half a century ago was, however, limited to four\r\n    provinces, and only some twenty cities were held by the rebels.\r\n    The insurrection of Wu San-kuei, in the reign of K’ang-Hsi,\r\n    overran twelve provinces, and the rebels captured some three\r\n    hundred cities and towns. But this Taiping rebellion has been\r\n    on a scale vaster than any before, and has produced some great\r\n    leaders in its armies. Here in Nanking not a single rebel\r\n    surrendered. Many burned themselves alive rather than be taken.\r\n    Such things are unparalleled in history, and we feel that the\r\n    final happy issue is due to the consummate virtue and wisdom of\r\n    his late Majesty, which alone made victory possible. By dint of\r\n    careful economy in the Palace, he was able to set aside large\r\n    sums for the equipment of adequate forces. Most careful in his\r\n    choice of leaders, he was lavish of rewards; all wise himself,\r\n    yet was he ever ready to listen to the advice of his generals.\r\n    Your Majesties the Empresses and the Emperor have faithfully\r\n    carried out and even amplified these principles, and thus you\r\n    have succeeded in wiping out these usurpers and have shed great\r\n    glory on your reign. We, who so unworthily hold your high\r\n    command, grieve greatly that His Majesty did not live to see\r\n    his work crowned with triumph.”\r\n\r\nFor four years after the collapse of the rebellion, Tseng Kuo-fan\r\nremained at Nanking as Viceroy. (The Hunanese still regard that post\r\nas belonging by prescriptive right to a Hunanese official.) His only\r\nabsence was during a brief expedition against the Mahomedan rebels in\r\nShantung. In September 1868 he was appointed Viceroy of Chihli, and left\r\nfor Peking at the end of the year, receiving a remarkable ovation from\r\nthe people of Nanking. In Peking he was received with great honours, and\r\nin his capacity of Grand Secretary had a meeting with the Council on the\r\nmorning after his arrival, followed immediately by an Audience, to which\r\nhe was summoned and conducted by one of the Princes. The young Emperor\r\nwas sitting on a Throne facing west, and the Empresses Regent were behind\r\nhim, screened from view by the yellow curtain, Tzŭ An to the left and Tzŭ\r\nHsi to the right of the Throne. In the Chinese narrative of the rebellion\r\nto which we have already referred, the writer professes to report this\r\naudience, and several that followed, practically verbatim, and as it\r\naffords interesting information as to the manner and methods of Tzŭ Hsi\r\non these occasions, the following extracts are worthy of reproduction. It\r\nis to be observed that the writer, like all his contemporaries, assumes\r\n_ab initio_ that the Empress Tzŭ An, though senior, is a negligible\r\nquantity and that the whole interest of the occasion lies between Tzŭ Hsi\r\nand the official in audience.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the Throne room, Tseng fell upon his knees, as in duty\r\nbound, and in that position advanced a few feet, saying “Your servant\r\nTseng Kuo-fan respectfully enquires after Your Majesties’ health.” Then\r\nremoving his hat and performing the kowtow, he humbly returned thanks\r\nfor Imperial favours bestowed upon him. These preliminaries completed,\r\nhe rose and advanced a few steps to kneel on the cushion prepared for\r\nhim below the daïs. The following dialogue then took place:—\r\n\r\n    _Her Majesty Tzŭ Hsi._ When you left Nanking, was all your\r\n    official work completed?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Yes, quite completed.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ Have the irregular troops and braves all been\r\n    disbanded?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Yes, all.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ How many in all?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ I have disbanded over twenty thousand irregulars and\r\n    have enrolled thirty thousand regulars.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ From which province do the majority of these men\r\n    hail?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ A few of the troops come from Hunan, but the great\r\n    majority are Anhui men.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ Was the disbandment effected quite quietly?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Yes, quite quietly.\r\n\r\nThen follow numerous questions regarding Tseng’s previous career, his\r\nfamily, &c. As soon as the questions cease, after waiting a few minutes,\r\nthe audience is at an end, and Tseng kowtows and retires. On each\r\noccasion, and they were many, the Empress had evidently worked up her\r\nquestions carefully from study of reports and despatches, and invariably\r\nput them in the short sharp form indicated; always peremptory, _de haut\r\nen bas_ and Cæsarian, this woman “behind the screen,” addressing the\r\nveteran who had saved China for her rule.\r\n\r\nAfter describing Tseng’s important position at the Court banquet given to\r\nhigh officials, Manchu and Chinese, on the 16th day of the 1st Moon (at\r\nwhich six plays were performed and the dishes “passed all reckoning”),\r\nthe narrative gives an account of his farewell audience, at which Her\r\nMajesty closely cross-examined him as to his plans for the reorganisation\r\nof the naval and military forces of Chihli. He held the post of Chihli\r\nViceroy for a little over a year. The viceregal residence in those days\r\nwas at Pao-ting fu, so that when the Tientsin massacre occurred (1870)\r\nhe was not directly to blame, though officially responsible. In June of\r\nthat year the Nanking Viceroy was assassinated, and Tseng was ordered\r\nto resume duty at that post, his place in Chihli being taken by Li\r\nHung-chang, who held it for twenty-four years. Tseng, whose health was\r\nfailing, endeavoured to have his appointment to Nanking cancelled, but\r\nTzŭ Hsi would take no excuses. She issued a Decree in which she laid\r\nstress on the arduous nature of the work to be done at the southern\r\ncapital and Tseng’s special fitness for the post which he had so ably\r\nadministered in the past. “Even if his eyesight troubles him,” she said,\r\n“he can still exercise a general supervision.”\r\n\r\nBefore leaving for the south, Tseng celebrated his sixtieth birthday,\r\nreceiving many marks of Imperial favour and rich gifts. The Empress\r\nsent him a poem of congratulation in her own handwriting, and a tablet\r\nbearing the inscription “My lofty pillar and rock of defence,” together\r\nwith an image of Buddha, a sandalwood sceptre inlaid with jade, a dragon\r\nrobe, ten rolls of “auspicious” silk, and ten of crape. At his farewell\r\naudience the following interesting conversation took place:—\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ When did you leave Tientsin?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ On the 23rd.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ Have the ringleaders in the massacre of foreigners\r\n    been executed yet?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Not yet. The Consul told me that the Russian Minister\r\n    was coming to Tientsin and that the French Minister was sending\r\n    a deputy to witness the executions, so that the decapitations\r\n    could not be summarily carried out.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ What date has Li Hung-chang fixed for the executions?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ On the day of my departure, he sent me word that he\r\n    expected to dispose of them yesterday.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ Have the Tientsin populace calmed down?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Yes, things are now quite settled and orderly.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi_. What made the Prefect and Magistrate run away to\r\n    Shun-Tê after the massacre?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ When first removed from their posts, they knew not\r\n    what sentence would be decreed against them, so they boldly and\r\n    shamelessly ran away from the city.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ Have you quite lost the sight of your right eye?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Yes, it is quite blind; but I can still see with the\r\n    left.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ Have you entirely recovered from your other maladies?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Yes, I think I can say that I have.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi_. You appear to kneel, and to rise from that posture\r\n    quite briskly and freely, as if your physique were still pretty\r\n    good?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ No; it is not what it used to be.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ That was a strange thing, the assassination of Ma\r\n    Hsin-yi (the late Viceroy of Nanking), was it not?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Extraordinary.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ He was a first-rate administrator.\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Yes, he took great pains, and was honest and impartial.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ How many regular troops have you raised in Chihli?\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Three thousand. The former Viceroy had four thousand\r\n    men trained under the old system. I had intended to raise three\r\n    thousand more, making a total force of ten thousand. I have\r\n    arranged with Li Hung-chang to carry out this programme.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ It is of vital importance that we should have a\r\n    force of properly trained troops in the south. You must see to\r\n    this.\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ Yes. At present peace prevails, but we must be\r\n    prepared for all possible emergencies. I propose to build forts\r\n    at several places on the Yangtsze.\r\n\r\n    _Tzŭ Hsi._ It would be a fine thing if we could secure\r\n    ourselves properly against invasion. These missionary\r\n    complications are perpetually creating trouble for us.\r\n\r\n    _Tseng._ That is true. Of late the missionaries have created\r\n    trouble everywhere. The native converts are given to oppressing\r\n    those who will not embrace Christianity (literally “_eat the\r\n    religion_”) and the missionaries always screen the converts,\r\n    while the Consuls protect the missionaries. Next year, when\r\n    the time comes for revising the French Treaty, we must take\r\n    particular pains to reconsider carefully the whole question of\r\n    religious propaganda.\r\n\r\nIn November Tseng had his farewell audience, and Tzŭ Hsi never saw him\r\nagain. A month later he took over the seals of office at his old post,\r\none of his first acts being to try the assassin of his predecessor, who\r\nwas condemned to death by the slicing process. In the following summer he\r\nwent for a cruise of inspection and visited various places of interest,\r\nnoting with satisfaction the complete restoration of law and order in\r\nthe districts which had been for so long the scene of the Taipings’\r\ndevastations. On one occasion, seeing the gaily decked “flower-boats” and\r\nlistening to the sounds of their revelries, he joyfully exclaimed: “I am\r\nglad to have lived to see my province as it was before the rebellion.” In\r\nDecember he moved into the Viceregal residence which he had known as the\r\nPalace of the Taiping “Heavenly King.” But he was not long to administer\r\nthat high office, for in the early part of 1872 he had a first stroke of\r\nparalysis. A few days later, going in his chair to meet a high official\r\narriving from Peking, and reciting, as was his wont, favourite passages\r\nfrom the classics, he suddenly made a sign to his attendants, but speech\r\nfailed him and he could only mumble. In his diary that same evening, he\r\nwrote:—“This illness of mine prevents me from attending to my work. In\r\nthe 26th and 27th years of Tao-Kuang (1846-7) I found that efforts at\r\npoetical composition brought on attacks of eczema and insomnia. Now it\r\nis different. I feel all dazed and confused. Spots float before my eyes\r\nand my liver is disordered. Alas, that I can neither obtain a speedy\r\nrelease, like the morning dew which swiftly passes away, nor hope for\r\nthe restoration of energies to enable me to perform my duty. What sadder\r\nfate than thus to linger on, useless, in the world!” On the next day\r\nhe wrote:—“My strength is rapidly failing, and I must leave behind me\r\nmany unsettled questions and business half completed. The dead leaves\r\nof disappointed hopes fill all the landscape, and I see no prospect of\r\nsettling my affairs. Thirty years have passed since I took my degree, and\r\nI have attained to the highest rank; yet have I learned nothing, and my\r\ncharacter still lacks true solidity. What shame should be mine at having\r\nreached thus uselessly old age!” Next day, while reading a despatch, he\r\nhad another stroke. Rallying, he told his eldest son, Tseng Chi-tsê,\r\nto see to it that his funeral ceremonies were conducted after the old\r\nusages, and that neither Buddhist nor Taoist priests be permitted to\r\nchant their liturgies over his corpse. On the following morning, though\r\nvery weak, he insisted on perusing one of the essays which had been\r\nsuccessful at the provincial examination. In the evening he was taken\r\nout into his garden and was returning thence with his son when the last\r\nseizure occurred. They carried him into the great Hall of audience, where\r\nhe sat upright, as if presiding at a meeting of Council, and thus passed\r\naway, well stricken in age, though only sixty-two by the calendar. “Every\r\nman in Nanking,” says the writer of this narrative, “felt as if he had\r\nlost a parent; it was rumoured that a shooting star had fallen in the\r\ncity at the very moment of his death. The news was received by the Throne\r\nwith profound grief. All Court functions were suspended for three days.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress Dowager issued a Decree praising her faithful servant in\r\nunmeasured terms of gratitude and esteem, describing him as the “very\r\nbackbone of the Throne,” reciting his glorious achievements and ordering\r\nthe erection of Temples in his honour in all the provinces that had been\r\nthe scene of his campaign against the Taipings, in order “to prove our\r\nsincere affection for this good and loyal man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTZŬ HSI AND THE EUNUCHS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the facts upon which modern Chinese historians, Censors, Imperial\r\nTutors and Guardians of the Heir Apparent have repeatedly laid stress,\r\nis that the Ming Dynasty became effeminate, then degenerate, and was\r\neventually lost, because of the demoralising influence of the eunuch\r\nsystem on the Court and its official entourage. Upon this text, moral\r\nexhortations in the best classical manner have been addressed to the\r\nThrone for centuries, regardless of the consideration that most of the\r\nwriters owed their positions, and hoped to owe further advancement,\r\nto the eunuchs, who had the sovereign’s ear. These Memorials were\r\nusually only a part of the hoary fabric of pious platitudes and\r\nshadowy shibboleths which loom so large in the stock in trade of\r\nChina’s bureaucracy (in which matter China stands not alone), and the\r\nEmpress Dowager, under whose rule the evil grew and assumed monstrous\r\nproportions, was ever wont to play her part in this elaborate farce,\r\nby solemnly approving the views of the bold critics and by professing\r\nthe greatest indignation at the misdeeds of her eunuch myrmidons and\r\nretainers.\r\n\r\nThere have been, of course, sincere and eloquent critics of this\r\npernicious system and its attendant evils; in fact, scarcely a reformer\r\nworthy of the name during the past fifty years has failed to place the\r\nabolition of eunuchs in the front rank of the measures necessary to\r\nbring China into line with the civilised Powers. There is no doubt that\r\none of the first causes of the _coup d’état_ in 1898 arose from the\r\nhatred of the Chief Eunuch, Li Lien-ying, for the Emperor Kuang-Hsü (who\r\nyears before had ventured to have him beaten), and his not unnatural\r\napprehension that the Emperor intended to follow up his reforms of the\r\nPeking Administration by devoting his attention to the Palace and to the\r\nabolition of eunuchs. As to the Boxer rising, it has been clearly proved\r\nthat this notorious and powerful Chamberlain used all the weight of his\r\ngreat influence with his Imperial mistress on behalf of the anti-foreign\r\nmovement, and that, if justice had been done (that is to say had he\r\nnot been protected by the Russian Legation), his should have been one\r\nof the very first names on the Peace Protocol “Black List.” The part\r\nwhich Li Lien-ying played in these two national crises of recent years\r\nis mentioned here chiefly to emphasise the fact that the platitudinous\r\nutterances of the orthodox express, as usual, a very real and widespread\r\ngrievance, and that the falsetto notes of the Censorate are answered by a\r\ndeep undertone of dissatisfaction and disgust throughout the provinces.\r\nIt is for this reason that, especially during the past five years,\r\nprogressive and patriotic Chinese officials (_e.g._ men like the Viceroy\r\nYüan Shih-k’ai and T’ang Shao-yi, who realise how greatly the persistence\r\nof this barbarous medievalism lowers China in the eyes of the world),\r\nas well as the unanimous voice of the vernacular Press, have urged that\r\nthe Court should now dispense with eunuchs, a measure which the Regent\r\nis said to favour, but which—such is the power wielded by these “fawning\r\nsycophants”—would undoubtedly be difficult and possibly dangerous. As\r\nearly as 1906, _The Times_ correspondent at Peking was discussing the\r\npossibility of their early removal as one of the many reforms which then\r\nshone so brightly on the horizon. In the Chinese conservative’s opinion,\r\nhowever, which still weighs heavily in China, there are centuries of\r\nprecedents and arguments to be adduced in favour of a system which has\r\nobtained continuously since long before the beginning of the Christian\r\nera, which coincides with the Chinese accepted ideas of polygamy, and\r\nrecognises the vital importance of legitimacy of succession in relation\r\nto the national religion of ancestor worship. On the other hand, it is\r\ntrue that in the golden days of the Sage Emperors at the beginning of the\r\nChou Dynasty, eunuchs had no place in the body politic. Later, during\r\nthe period of that Dynasty’s decay and the era of the feudal States,\r\nConfucius refers with disapproval to their baneful influence, so that the\r\nSage’s authority may be adduced against them and their proceedings.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the present Dynasty at Peking (1644), the\r\nManchus took over, as conquerors, all the existing machinery and\r\n_personnel_ of the Chinese Court, eunuchs included, but they lost no time\r\nin restricting the latter’s activities and opportunities. At the first\r\naudience held by the young Emperor Shun-Chih, the high officials, Manchu\r\nand Chinese, united to protest against the recent high-handed proceedings\r\nof the Court menials, declaring them to be “fit only to sweep floors,\r\nand in no wise entitled to have access to the Monarch.” Regulations\r\nwere promptly introduced, which remain in force (on paper) to this day,\r\nforbidding any eunuch to occupy any official position, or to hold any\r\nhonorific rank or title higher than a Button of the fourth class. More\r\nimportant still, in view of the far-reaching conspiracy of the Chief\r\nEunuch, Wei Chung (whom the last of the Mings had beheaded), was the law\r\nthen introduced, which forbade any eunuch to leave the capital on any\r\npretext whatsoever. For the next two hundred years, thanks to the wise\r\nrule and excellent traditions handed down by the two famous Emperors\r\nK’ang-Hsi and Ch’ien-Lung, the Palace eunuchs were kept generally under\r\nvery strict discipline; but with the present century, when degeneration\r\nhad set in strongly under the dissolute monarch Hsien-Feng, and even\r\nbefore the appearance of Yehonala on the scene, their evil influence had\r\nagain become paramount in the Forbidden City. With Tzŭ Hsi’s accession to\r\npower, all the corruption, intrigues and barbarous proceedings, that had\r\ncharacterised the last Mings, were gradually re-established and became\r\npermanent features of her Court.\r\n\r\nOf the power which the eunuchs exercised throughout the whole of Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s reign, there is no possible doubt: the abuses which they practised\r\nunder her protection, abuses flagrant and unconcealed, increased with\r\nthe passing years and her own growing indifference to criticism, until,\r\nafter 1898, her favourite and chief body-servant, Li Lien-ying did not\r\nscruple to boast that he could make or mar the highest officials at his\r\npleasure and defy the Son of Heaven on his Throne. Of the countless\r\nlegends of debauchery in the Palace, of orgies devised for Tzŭ Hsi by\r\nthe Court eunuchs and actors, there is naturally nothing approaching\r\nto direct evidence: the frequent denunciations by Censors and the\r\nscurrilous writings of Cantonese and other lampooners, afford at best but\r\ncircumstantial proof. The writings of K’ang Yu-wei and his associates,\r\nin particular, are clearly inspired by blind and unscrupulous hatred,\r\nand so inaccurate in matters of common knowledge and history, that\r\none must perforce discount the value of their statements wherever the\r\nEmpress Dowager or Jung Lu are concerned. But common report in China, as\r\nelsewhere, is usually based on some foundation of truth, and in Peking,\r\nwhere the mass of the population has always been conspicuously loyal to\r\nTzŭ Hsi, there have never been two opinions as to the extravagance and\r\ngeneral profligacy of her Court and of the evils of the eunuch _régime_.\r\nNor is there room for doubt as to the deplorable effect exercised by\r\nthese vicious underlings on weak and undisciplined Emperors, rulers\r\nof decadent instincts often encouraged in vicious practices to their\r\nspeedy undoing. That this was the fate of Tzŭ Hsi’s own son, the Emperor\r\nT’ung-Chih, is well-known, nor is there any doubt that the deaths of\r\nboth Hsien-Feng and Kuang-Hsü were hastened, if not caused, by the\r\ntemptations to which they were exposed by their vicious environment.\r\nThe inner history of the Celestial Empire and the Manchu Dynasty during\r\nthe last seventy years is inextricably bound up with that of the Palace\r\neunuchs and their far-reaching intrigues. During the half century of Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s rule, the power behind the Throne (literally a power of darkness\r\nin high places) was that of her favourite Chamberlains. Of these the\r\nlast, who has survived her, Li Lien-ying, is known by his nickname of\r\n“Cobbler’s Wax Li” (P’i Hsiao Li)[17] from one end of the Empire to the\r\nother as the chief “squeezer” and arch villain of many a Palace tragedy.\r\nHis influence over his Imperial mistress was indeed remarkable; on all\r\noccasions, except State audiences, she was wont to treat him with an\r\naffectionate familiarity, and to allow him a _sans-gêne_, to which no\r\ncourtier, nor any member of her own family (save perhaps Jung Lu) dared\r\never aspire.\r\n\r\nDuring the Court’s residence, and the Emperor’s illness, at Jehol in\r\n1861, the young Yehonala had occasion to notice and to appreciate the\r\nintelligence and willing service rendered by one of the eunuchs in\r\nimmediate attendance upon her; this servant, by name An Te-hai, became\r\nher faithful henchman throughout the crisis of the Tsai Yüan conspiracy,\r\nand her intermediary and confidant in her dealings with the young\r\nguardsman, Jung Lu. Upon her accession to the Co-Regency, he became her\r\nfavourite attendant and emissary, and later her _âme damnée_, sharing in\r\nall her ambitious hopes and plans, with no small advantage to himself,\r\nwhile at the same time employing his undeniable talents to the diversion\r\nof the young widow’s mind by the provision of the elaborate Court\r\npageants and theatrical entertainments which her soul loved. An Te-hai\r\nwas himself an actor of no mean ability and exceedingly handsome of his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, before the Regency was firmly established and while\r\nyet the reverberating echoes of the Tsai Yüan conspiracy lingered in\r\nChihli, that the leading Censors began to send in Memorials against\r\nthe self-evident extravagance and the rumoured profligacy of Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s Palace. The young Yehonala, headstrong and already impatient of\r\ncriticism and restraint, confident also in the strength and loyalty of\r\nher immediate following, never allowed these remonstrances to affect her\r\nconduct in the slightest degree; nevertheless, a stickler always for\r\netiquette and appearances, and an adept at “face-saving” arts, she had no\r\nobjection to expressing the heartiest approval of, and agreement with,\r\nher professional moralists. On more than one occasion, in those first\r\nyears, we find her proclaiming in most suitably worded Edicts, pious\r\nintentions which were never intended to be taken seriously by anyone,\r\nand never were. The following Decree, issued in the third year of the\r\nRegency, (1864) is a case in point, and particularly interesting in that\r\nit refers to the wholesale pilfering by eunuchs in the Palace, which has\r\ncontinued without interruption to this day.\r\n\r\nA Decree in the name of the two Empresses Regent, in the third year of\r\nthe Emperor T’ung-Chih:—\r\n\r\n    “The Censor Chia To memorialises, saying that it has come\r\n    to his knowledge that certain of the eunuchs who perform\r\n    theatricals in the Imperial Household, have had their costumes\r\n    made of tribute silks and satins taken from the Imperial\r\n    storehouses. He asserts that they perform daily before the\r\n    Throne and regularly receive largesse to the amount of\r\n    thousands of taels. He asks that these practices be forbidden\r\n    and discontinued forthwith, in order that all tendency towards\r\n    vicious courses may be checked.\r\n\r\n    “With reference to this Memorial, it should be stated that last\r\n    year, although the twenty-seven months of Imperial mourning\r\n    for the late monarch were drawing to their close, we issued a\r\n    Decree forbidding all festivities, for the reason that His\r\n    late Majesty’s remains had not yet been removed to their final\r\n    place of sepulture; at the same time we gave orders that the\r\n    seasonal tribute in kind, and provincial offerings, should be\r\n    forwarded, as usual, in order to provide eventually for the\r\n    costuming of the Palace theatricals, with reference to which\r\n    matter we intended to issue another Decree in due course,\r\n    upon the conclusion of the funeral ceremonies. We seized the\r\n    opportunity, in this same Edict, to abolish once and for all\r\n    the custom of bringing actors to the Palace to be made eunuchs,\r\n    holding it to be wise, while His Majesty is still a minor,\r\n    that everything that might tend in any way to lead him into\r\n    paths of extravagance and dissipation should be firmly nipped\r\n    in the bud. The Censor’s present Memorial has therefore filled\r\n    us with real amazement. At a time like this, when rebellions\r\n    are still raging, and our people are in sore distress, when\r\n    our treasuries are empty and our revenues insufficient for\r\n    the needs of Government, our hearts are heavy with sorrowful\r\n    thoughts, and must be so, especially as long as His late\r\n    Majesty’s remains have not yet been borne to their final\r\n    resting place. How then could we possibly permit such a state\r\n    of things as the Censor describes?[18] Furthermore, it is the\r\n    duty of the Comptroller of our Household to keep a complete\r\n    inventory of all bullion and silken stuffs in the Palace, none\r\n    of which can be touched without our express permission. Surely\r\n    this is sufficient to prove that all these rumours are utterly\r\n    devoid of foundation.\r\n\r\n    “Nevertheless, in our remote seclusion of the Palace, it is\r\n    inevitable that we should be kept in ignorance of much that\r\n    goes on, so that it is just possible there may be some ground\r\n    for these reports. It may be that certain evil-disposed\r\n    eunuchs have been committing irregularities beyond the Palace\r\n    precincts, and, if so, such conduct must be stopped at all\r\n    costs. We hereby command that drastic measures be taken to deal\r\n    with the offenders at once.\r\n\r\n    “It is imperatively necessary that the Emperor, in the\r\n    intervals of his studies, should have about his person only\r\n    honest and steady retainers, with whom he may converse on\r\n    the arts and practice of government. If his attendants are\r\n    evil men and make it their business to flatter his ears and\r\n    divert his eyes with luxurious and effeminate pastimes, the\r\n    result might well be to produce in His Majesty most undesirable\r\n    tendencies; and any fault in the Emperor, however trifling,\r\n    is liable to involve the State in far-reaching misfortunes.\r\n    We therefore hereby authorise the Ministers of our Household\r\n    to see to it that the Chief Eunuch enforces strict discipline\r\n    upon all his subordinates, and should any of them hereafter\r\n    venture to commit presumptuous acts, or to display their\r\n    overweening arrogance, they must at once be arrested by the\r\n    police and severely punished. And should such a case occur the\r\n    Chief Eunuch will also be dismissed for neglect of his duty of\r\n    supervision, and the Comptrollers of the Household will incur\r\n    our severe displeasure, with penalties. Let this Decree be\r\n    copied and preserved in the archives of the Household and the\r\n    Ante-Chambers.”\r\n\r\nAs everyone in the capital was well aware of Yehonala’s passion for the\r\ntheatre, this Decree was naturally regarded as so much “fine writing\r\non waste paper,” and it is noticeable that from this time until her\r\nfavourite and chief eunuch An Te-hai, came to his dramatic end, the\r\nCensors continued to impeach her and to denounce the ever increasing\r\nextravagance, which was already seriously disorganising the Metropolitan\r\nGovernment’s finances and entailing fresh _corvées_ in the provinces.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, two courageous Censors memorialised on this subject, having\r\nparticularly in their minds the abuses caused by the unlawful proceedings\r\nof An Te-hai.\r\n\r\n    “More care,” said they, “should be shown in the selection\r\n    of the Emperor’s body-servants. All the disasters that have\r\n    overtaken previous Dynasties have been directly due to the\r\n    machinations and evil influence of eunuchs. These creatures\r\n    worm their way into the confidence and even into the affection\r\n    of the Throne by their protestations of loyalty and faithful\r\n    service; they are past-masters in every art of adroit flattery.\r\n    Having once secured the Imperial favour and protection, they\r\n    proceed to attach to themselves troops of followers, and\r\n    gradually make for themselves a place of power that in time\r\n    becomes unassailable. We, your Memorialists, therefore beg\r\n    that this danger be now averted by the selection of well-bred\r\n    and trustworthy attendants to wait upon His Majesty. There\r\n    should not be about the Throne any young eunuchs of attractive\r\n    appearance, creatures who make it their aim to establish\r\n    influence over the Emperor and who would certainly turn it to\r\n    their own ends so soon as he assumes the control of affairs.”\r\n\r\nIn the Decree commenting on this Memorial, the Empresses Regent, in the\r\nname of the Emperor, observe:—\r\n\r\n    “This Memorial is very much to the point. History is full of\r\n    instances where disaster has been brought about by eunuchs, and\r\n    the example afforded us by those rulers who have been corrupted\r\n    and undone by these ‘rats and foxes,’ should serve as timely\r\n    warning to ourselves. By the divine wisdom of our predecessors\r\n    on the Throne, not only have eunuchs been forbidden to meddle\r\n    in all business of State, but they have never been permitted\r\n    to gain the ear of the sovereign, or to influence him in any\r\n    way, so that, for the past two hundred years, eunuch influence\r\n    has been a thing of the past, and these fawning sycophants\r\n    have enjoyed no opportunity of practising their evil arts of\r\n    intrigue. Ever since their Majesties, the present Empresses\r\n    Dowager, assumed the Regency, they also have conformed strictly\r\n    to this House-law of our Dynasty, and have refused to allow\r\n    these artful minions undue access to their Presence. As we\r\n    peruse the present Memorial, we must admit that it evinces a\r\n    very clear perception of those dangers which may overtake the\r\n    State because of the undue influence of eunuchs. Our feelings,\r\n    while reading it, are like those of the man who ‘treading\r\n    upon the hoar-frost, realises that winter is at hand.’[19] We\r\n    therefore now command that if any of these noisome flatterers\r\n    are attempting to pervert the intelligence of the Throne, the\r\n    matter must be dealt with promptly, and we must be informed,\r\n    so that their fitting punishment may be secured. We desire that\r\n    all our attendants shall be of indisputable integrity and good\r\n    morals, so that the door may be firmly shut on all evil and\r\n    degrading tendencies.”\r\n\r\nThus, Tzŭ Hsi, in her best manner, “for the gallery.” But, “in the deep\r\nseclusion of our Palace,” life went on as before, the merry round of\r\nan Oriental Trianon, while the Chief Eunuch’s influence over the young\r\nEmpress became greater every day. It was common knowledge, and the gossip\r\nof the tea-houses, that his lightest whim was law in the Forbidden City;\r\nthat Yehonala and he, dressed in fancy costumes from historical plays,\r\nwould make frequent excursions on the Palace lake; that he frequently\r\nwore the Dragon robes sacred to the use of the sovereign, and that the\r\nEmpress had publicly presented him with the jade “ju-yi,” symbol of royal\r\npower. Under these circumstances it was only natural, if not inevitable,\r\nthat unfounded rumours should be rife in exaggeration of the real facts,\r\nand so we find it reported that An Te-hai was no eunuch, and again, that\r\nYehonala had been delivered of a son[20] of which he was the father; many\r\nfantastic and moving tales were current of the licentious festivities of\r\nthe Court, of students masquerading as eunuchs and then being put out of\r\nthe way in the subterranean galleries of the Palace. Rumours and tales\r\nof orgies; inventions no doubt, for the most part, yet inevitable in the\r\nface of the notorious and undeniable corruption that had characterised\r\nthe Court and the seraglio under the dissolute Hsien-Feng, and justified,\r\nif not confirmed, as time went on, by an irresistible consensus of\r\nopinion in the capital, and by fully substantiated events in the Empress\r\nDowager’s career.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.M. TZŬ HSI, WITH THE CONSORT (LUNG YÜ) AND PRINCIPAL\r\nCONCUBINE (JEN FEI) OF H.M. KUANG-HSÜ, ACCOMPANIED BY COURT LADIES AND\r\nEUNUCHS.]\r\n\r\nOf these events, one, which had far-reaching results, was her violation\r\nof the dynastic house-law which forbade eunuchs to leave the capital.\r\nIn 1869, being short of funds, and desiring to replenish her Privy Purse\r\nwithout consulting Prince Kung or her colleague the Co-Regent, she\r\ndespatched her favourite An Te-hai on a special mission to Shantung,\r\nwhere he was to collect tribute in her name.[21] By this time the Chief\r\nEunuch had incurred the bitter enmity of several of the Princes of the\r\nImperial Clan, and especially of Prince Kung, not only because of his\r\ngrowing influence over Tzŭ Hsi, but because of his insolent bearing to\r\nall at Court. On one occasion the Empress had curtly sent word to Prince\r\nKung that she could not grant him audience because she was busy talking\r\nto the eunuch, an insult which the Prince never forgot and which cost the\r\nfavourite his life, besides leading to the disgrace of the Prince and\r\nother consequences serious to the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Eunuch’s illegal mission to Shantung, and his outrageous\r\nbehaviour in that province, provided Prince Kung with a long-sought\r\nopportunity not only of wreaking vengeance on him but of creating rivalry\r\nand enmity between the Empresses Regent. The Governor of Shantung, an\r\nable and courageous official named Ting Pao-chen, who had distinguished\r\nhimself in the Taiping rebellion, was highly incensed at the arrogant\r\neunuch’s assumption of Imperial authority, and being quite _au courant_\r\nwith the position of affairs in the Palace, he reported direct to Prince\r\nKung and asked for instructions. The Governor’s despatch reached the\r\nPrince while Tzŭ Hsi was amusing herself with theatricals; without a\r\nmoment’s delay he sought audience of Tzŭ An, the Co-Regent Empress,\r\nand, playing upon her vanity and weak disposition, induced her to sign\r\na Decree, which he drafted in her presence, ordering the eunuch’s\r\nsummary decapitation, the customary formality of a trial in Peking\r\nbeing dispensed with. Tzŭ An, hard pressed as she was, gave her consent\r\nreluctantly and with a clear presentiment of evil to come from the wrath\r\nof her masterful colleague. “The Western Empress will assuredly kill me\r\nfor this,” she is reported to have said to the Prince, as she handed him\r\nthe sealed Decree, which Kung sent off post-haste by special courier.\r\n\r\nThe following is the text of this interesting document:—\r\n\r\n    “Ting Pao-chen reports that a eunuch has been creating\r\n    disturbances in the province of Shantung. According to the\r\n    Department Magistrate of Te Chou, a eunuch named An and his\r\n    followers passed through that place by way of the Imperial\r\n    Canal, in two dragon barges, with much display of pomp and\r\n    pageantry. He announced that he had come on an Imperial mission\r\n    to procure Dragon robes. His barges flew a black banner,\r\n    bearing in its centre the triple Imperial emblems of the Sun,\r\n    and there were also Dragon and Phœnix flags flying on both\r\n    sides of his vessels.[22] A goodly company of both sexes were\r\n    in attendance on this person; there were female musicians,\r\n    skilled in the use of string and wind instruments. The banks of\r\n    the Canal were lined with crowds of spectators, who witnessed\r\n    with amazement and admiration his progress. The 21st day of\r\n    last month happened to be this eunuch’s birthday, so he arrayed\r\n    himself in Dragon robes, and stood on the foredeck of his\r\n    barge, to receive the homage of his suite. The local Magistrate\r\n    was just about to order his arrest when the barges set sail and\r\n    proceeded southwards. The Governor adds that he has already\r\n    given orders for his immediate arrest.\r\n\r\n    “We are dumfoundered at this report. How can we hope ever\r\n    to purify the standard of morals in the Palace and frighten\r\n    evil-doers, unless we make an example of this insolent eunuch,\r\n    who has dared to leave Peking without our permission and\r\n    to commit these lawless deeds? The Governors of the three\r\n    provinces of Shantung, Honan and Kiangsu are ordered to seek\r\n    out and arrest the eunuch An, whom we had formerly honoured\r\n    with rank of the sixth grade and the decoration of the crow’s\r\n    feather. Upon his being duly identified by his companions,\r\n    let him be forthwith beheaded, without further formalities,\r\n    no attention is to be paid to any crafty explanations which\r\n    he may attempt to make. The Governors concerned will be held\r\n    responsible in the event of failure to effect his arrest.”\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi remained for some time in blissful ignorance of her favourite’s\r\ndanger, and even of his death. No doubt the Chief Eunuch’s great\r\nunpopularity enabled Prince Kung and the Empress Tzŭ An to keep the\r\nmatter secret until the offender was past helping. Ten days later, Tzŭ An\r\nissued a second Decree, extracted from her like the first by Prince Kung,\r\nin which the eunuch’s execution is recorded, as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Ting Pao-chen now reports that the eunuch An was arrested in\r\n    the T’ai An prefecture and has been summarily beheaded. Our\r\n    dynasty’s house-law is most strict in regard to the proper\r\n    discipline of eunuchs, and provides severe punishment for\r\n    any offences which they may commit. They have always been\r\n    sternly forbidden to make expeditions to the provinces, or\r\n    to create trouble. Nevertheless, An Te-hai actually had the\r\n    brazen effrontery to violate this law, and for his crimes his\r\n    execution is only a fitting reward. In future, let all eunuchs\r\n    take warning by his example; should we have further cause to\r\n    complain, the chief eunuchs of the several departments of the\r\n    Household, will be punished as well as the actual offender.\r\n    Any eunuch who may hereafter pretend that he has been sent on\r\n    Imperial business to the provinces shall be cast into chains at\r\n    once, and sent to Peking for punishment.”\r\n\r\nThis Decree has a half-hearted ring, as if some of the conspirators’ fear\r\nof the coming wrath of Yehonala had crept into it. Very different in\r\nwording are the Edicts in which Tzŭ Hsi condemns an offender to death.\r\nWe miss her trenchant style, that “strength of the pen” which was the\r\nsecret of much of her power.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the death of An, in Shantung, several eunuchs of his\r\nfollowing were put to death by strangling; six others escaped from the\r\npolice, of whom five were recaptured and executed. The Chief Eunuch’s\r\nfamily were sent as slaves to the frontier guards in the north-west.\r\nSeveral days after the execution of Tzŭ Hsi’s favourite, the eunuch who\r\nhad escaped made his way back to Peking, and sent word to the Empress\r\nthrough Li Lien-ying, another of her confidential attendants. At first\r\nshe could scarcely believe that her timorous and self-effacing colleague\r\ncould have dared to sign these Decrees on her own responsibility and\r\nin secret, no matter what amount of pressure might have been brought\r\nto bear upon her. When she realised what had occurred, the Palace\r\nwitnessed one of those outbursts of torrential rage with which it was to\r\nbecome familiar in years to come. Swiftly making her way to the “Palace\r\nof Benevolent Peace,” the residence of her Co-Regent, she wrathfully\r\ndemanded an explanation. Tzŭ An, terrified, endeavoured to put the whole\r\nblame upon Prince Kung; but the plea did not serve her, and Tzŭ Hsi,\r\nafter a fierce quarrel, left, vowing vengeance on them both. This event\r\nmarked a turning point in the career of Yehonala, who, until then, had\r\nmaintained amicable relations with her less strong-minded colleague,\r\nand all the appearances of equality in the Co-Regency. Henceforward she\r\ndevoted more time and closer attention to affairs of State, consolidating\r\nher position and power with a clear determination to prevent any further\r\ninterference with her supreme authority. From this time forward she\r\ndefinitely assumes the first place as ruler of China, relegating her\r\ncolleague completely to the background.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the morning after the storm, Prince Kung appeared in the\r\nAudience Hall, Tzŭ sternly rebuked him, threatening him with dismissal\r\nand the forfeiture of his titles. For the time being, however, she\r\nallowed him to go unpunished, but she never forgave the offence, and\r\nshe took her revenge in due season: he suffered the effects of her\r\nresentment as long as he lived. Her first act was to pass over his son,\r\nthe rightful heir to the Throne, upon the death of T’ung-Chih. It is true\r\nthat in after years she permitted him to hold high office, but this was,\r\nfirstly, because she could not afford to dispense with his services, and,\r\nsecondly, because of her genuine affection for his daughter, whom she had\r\nadopted as her own child.\r\n\r\nAn Te-hai was succeeded in the post of Chief Eunuch and confidential\r\nattendant on her Majesty by Li Lien-ying, of whom mention has already\r\nbeen made. For the next forty years this Palace servant was destined to\r\nplay a leading part in the government of China, to hold in his supple\r\nhands the lives and deaths of thousands, to make and unmake the highest\r\nofficials of the Empire, and to levy rich tribute on the eighteen\r\nprovinces. As a youth of sixteen, when he “left the family”[23] (as\r\nthe Chinese euphemistically describe the making of a eunuch), Li was\r\nremarkable for his handsome appearance and good manners, advantages which\r\nnever failed to carry weight with Tzŭ Hsi. It is recorded on trustworthy\r\nauthority that at an early stage in his career he had so ingratiated\r\nhimself with Her Majesty that he was permitted unusual liberties,\r\nremaining seated in her presence, aye, even on the Throne itself. In the\r\nprivacy of her apartments he was allowed to discuss whatever subjects he\r\nchose, without being spoken to, and as years passed and his familiarity\r\nwith the Old Buddha increased, he became her regular and authoritative\r\nadviser on all important State business. In later years, when speaking\r\nof Her Majesty to outsiders, even to high officials, he would use the\r\nfamiliar pronoun “_Tsa-men_” meaning “we two,” which is usually reserved\r\nfor blood relations or persons on a footing of familiar equality, and he\r\nwas currently known among his followers by the almost sacrilegious title\r\nof “Lord of nine thousand years,” the Emperor being Lord of ten thousand.\r\nOnly on solemn State occasions did he observe the etiquette prescribed\r\nfor his class and a modest demeanour.\r\n\r\nCorrupt, avaricious, vindictive, and fiercely cruel to his enemies and\r\nrivals, it must be said in Li’s favour that he was, at least, wholly\r\ndevoted and faithful to his Imperial mistress, and that at times of\r\nperil he never failed to exert himself to the utmost for her comfort and\r\nprotection. He possessed moreover, other good qualities which appealed\r\nnot only to Tzŭ Hsi but to many of the high Manchu officials, who did not\r\nconsider it beneath their pride to throng for admission at his private\r\nresidence. He was cheerful, fond of a joke, an excellent actor[24] and\r\n_raconteur_, and a generous host: above all, he was passing rich. At\r\nthe Empress Dowager’s funeral, in November 1909, this aged retainer\r\npresented a pathetic and almost venerable spectacle, enough to make\r\none forget for a moment the accumulated horrors of his seventy years\r\nof wickedness. Smitten with age and sickness, he could scarcely totter\r\nthe short distance which the _cortège_ had to make on foot; but of all\r\nthat vast throng of officials and Palace servants, he alone showed\r\nunmistakable signs of deep and genuine grief. Watching the intelligent\r\nfeatures of this maker of secret history, one could not but wonder what\r\nthoughts were passing through that subtle brain, as he shuffled past the\r\nPavilion of the Diplomatic Body, escorting for the last time his great\r\nmistress,—the close confidant, not to say comrade, of all those long and\r\neventful years. For half a century he had served her with unremitting\r\nzeal and fidelity, no small thing in a country when the allegiance of\r\nservants is so commonly bought and sold. In his youth it was he who\r\nwalked and ran beside her chair as body servant; through what scenes of\r\nsplendour and squalor had they both passed since then, and now he was\r\nleft alone, surrounded by new faces and confronted by imminent peril of\r\nchange. Yet in spite of his long life and the enervating influences of\r\nhis profession, the old man’s powerful physique was by no means exhausted.\r\n\r\nToo wise to follow in the footsteps of his unfortunate predecessor, Li\r\nnever made raids on his own account into the provinces, nor did he ever\r\nattempt to gain or claim high official rank, remaining prudently content\r\nwith the fourth class button, which is the highest grade to which eunuchs\r\nmay legally aspire. But, under the protection and with the full knowledge\r\nof the Empress Dowager, he organised a regular system of _corvées_,\r\nsqueezes and _douceurs_, levied on every high official in the Empire,\r\nthe proceeds of which he frequently shared with the Old Buddha herself.\r\nAs shown in another place, the Empress and her Chief Eunuch practically\r\nmade common cause and a common purse in collecting “tribute” and squeezes\r\nduring the wanderings of the Court in exile after 1900. At that time\r\nthe Chief Eunuch, less fortunate than his mistress, had lost the whole\r\nof his buried treasure in the capital. It had been “_cached_” in a safe\r\nplace, known only to his intimate subordinates, but one of these sold the\r\nsecret to the French troops, who raided the hoard, a rich booty. One of\r\nLi’s first steps after the Court’s return was to obtain the Old Buddha’s\r\npermission to have the traitor beheaded, which was done without undue\r\nformalities. The Chief Eunuch’s fortune is estimated by Peking bankers\r\nto-day at about two millions sterling, invested chiefly in pawn-shops and\r\nmoney-changing establishments at the capital; this sum represents roughly\r\nhis share of the provincial tribute and squeezes on official appointments\r\nfor the last eight years, and the total is not surprising when we bear\r\nin mind that the price of one official post has been known to bring him\r\nin as much as three hundred and twenty thousand taels, or say forty\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nOne of the secrets of his wealth was that he never despised the day of\r\nsmall things. The following is the text of a letter in our possession (of\r\nwhich we reproduce a facsimile), written by him to one of the regular\r\ncontractors of the Palace, with whom he must have had many similar\r\ntransactions. The paper on which it is written is of the commonest,\r\nand the visiting card which, as usual, accompanies it, is that of an\r\nunpretentious business man; the style of the writer is terse and to the\r\npoint:—\r\n\r\n    “To my worthy friend, Mr. Wang, the Seventh (of his family):—\r\n\r\n    “Since I last had the pleasure of seeing you, you have been\r\n    constantly in my thoughts. I wish you, with all respect, long\r\n    life and prosperity: thus will your days fulfil my best hopes\r\n    of you. And now I beg politely to tell you that I, your younger\r\n    brother,[25] am quite ashamed of the emptiness of my purse and\r\n    I therefore beg that you, good Sir, will be so good as to lend\r\n    me notes to the amount of fifteen hundred taels, which sum\r\n    kindly hand to the bearer of this letter. I look forward to a\r\n    day for our further conversation,\r\n\r\n                         “Your younger brother,\r\n\r\n                                                     “Li Lien-ying.”\r\n\r\nAs to the amount, Li knew exactly how much the contractors and furnishers\r\nof the Palace should pay on every occasion, and that there was no need to\r\nquestion the possibility of the “loan” not being forthcoming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Facsimile of Letter written by Chief Eunuch Li Lien-ying.]\r\n\r\nThat he encouraged lavish expenditure at the Court is certain, and\r\nscarcely a matter for wonder, but his control of finance extended far\r\nbeyond the Privy Purse, and wrought great harm to the Empire on more\r\nthan one historic occasion. For instance, China’s humiliating defeat\r\nat the hands of Japan in 1894 was very largely due to his diversion of\r\nvast sums of money from the Navy to the reconstruction and decoration\r\nof the Summer Palace, a work from which he and his underlings profited\r\nto no small extent. In 1885, Prince Ch’un had been appointed head of the\r\nAdmiralty Board, assisted by Prince Ch’ing, Li Hung-chang and the Marquis\r\nTseng. After the death of the Marquis, however (who had been a moving\r\nspirit in the organisation of the Board), Naval affairs passed into the\r\ncontrol of a clique of young and inexperienced Princes, and when, in\r\n1889, the Emperor assumed the direction of the Government, one of his\r\nfirst acts was to order the re-building of the Summer Palace, which\r\nImperial residence had remained in ruins since its destruction by the\r\nAllies in 1861. There being no funds available, Li advised that the Naval\r\nappropriations should be devoted to this purpose, so that the Old Buddha\r\nmight be suitably provided with a residence; this was accordingly done,\r\nand the Naval Department became a branch of the Imperial Household (Nei\r\nWu Fu) for all purposes of Government finance. When the war with Japan\r\nbroke out, the Empress Dowager issued orders that the Naval Department\r\nshould be abolished. This order evoked very general criticism, but, as\r\nthe Department and the Summer Palace rebuilding fund had come to be\r\ntreated as one and the same account, her Decree simply meant that as\r\nthe Palace restoration was now complete, and as the funds were quite\r\nexhausted, the account in question might be considered closed. There\r\nwas obviously nothing to be gained by useless enquiries for money to be\r\ntransferred from the Palace to the Navy.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the Chief Eunuch accompanied Prince Ch’un on his first tour of\r\ninspection to the northern Naval ports, including the Naval bases of Port\r\nArthur and Weihaiwei. It was a matter of very general comment at the time\r\nthat the honours paid to the eunuch were noticeably greater than those\r\nshown to the Prince. Every officer in the Peiyang squadron, from Admiral\r\nTing downwards, did his best to ingratiate himself with this powerful\r\nChamberlain, and to become enrolled on the list of his _protégés_, so\r\nthat he was _entouré_ with all manner of bribery and adulation. Many\r\ncritics, foreign and Chinese, have cast on Li Hung-chang the blame for\r\nthe disasters of the Japanese war, but they surely overlook the fact, to\r\nwhich even the great Viceroy dared not openly refer, that nine-tenths\r\nof the funds which should have gone to the upkeep and provisioning of\r\nthe Navy and the maintenance of the Coast Defences, had been diverted by\r\nthe Chief Eunuch to the Palace (and much of them to his own pocket), so\r\nthat the ships’ crews were disaffected, and their ordnance defective, in\r\nthe hour of need. Readers of Pepys will remember a very similar state\r\nof affairs obtaining in the British Navy, happily without affecting\r\nthe _moral_ of its officers and men, at a similarly critical period of\r\nBritish history.\r\n\r\nLi Lien-ying’s hatred of the Emperor Kuang-Hsü was beyond doubt a most\r\nimportant factor in the _coup d’état_, and in the subsequent estrangement\r\nand hostility between Tzŭ Hsi and the nominal ruler of the Empire; there\r\nare not lacking those who say that it had much to do with the Emperor’s\r\ndeath, which certainly created no surprise in the capital. The eunuch\r\nhated and feared the Emperor’s reforming zeal, as well as the Cantonese\r\nadvisers who in 1898 came swarming to Peking as the apostles of a new\r\ndispensation, and it was therefore only natural that he should become the\r\nforemost adviser and partisan of the reactionaries and their emissary\r\nin urging the Empress to resume control of affairs. It is quite safe to\r\nassert that had his great influence with Tzŭ Hsi been exercised against,\r\ninstead of for, the Boxers, had he abstained from encouraging her\r\nsuperstitious belief in their magic arts, the anti-foreign movement would\r\nnever have gone further than the borders of Shantung, and the Chinese\r\npeople would have been spared the heavy burden of the indemnities. How\r\ninteresting a study of Asiatic politics and Court life presents itself\r\nin the spectacle of this cobbler’s apprentice and his influence on the\r\ndestinies of so great a race! Seeing him as he was on the day of his\r\nmistress’s burial, how bitter must have been the innermost thoughts of\r\nthe man, left alone on the brink of the grave with the ill-gotten wealth\r\nthat his country has paid for so heavily!\r\n\r\nAt the height of the Boxer crisis when the power wielded by Li Lien-ying\r\nwas enormous, it was the custom of Prince Tuan, when explaining his views\r\nto the Empress Dowager and the Grand Council, to emphasise the fact that\r\nno step had been taken except with the advice and approval of the Chief\r\nEunuch. “Such and such a Decree,” he would say, “is issued with the\r\nchief Chamberlain Li’s approval.” His object in so doing was to head off\r\nopposition, for he well knew that few would dare to oppose any measures\r\nthat the Chief Eunuch approved. When Her Majesty granted rewards to the\r\nBoxers and offered head-money to the troops for the killing of Europeans,\r\nit was at Li’s urgent request that she consented to defray these unusual\r\ncharges from her Privy Purse.\r\n\r\nWhen the relieving forces drew near to Peking and it became clear, even\r\nto the most obstinate, that the Boxer bolt was shot, the Chief Eunuch\r\npassed through a period of deep depression and mortification, not only\r\nbecause of the failure of his prophecies, but because it was clear to\r\nall at Court that his Imperial mistress, seeking, as was her wont, a\r\nscapegoat, was disposed to vent her wrath upon him. Herself deeply\r\nstirred by fear and wrath, it was only natural that she should turn\r\non him, who had been foremost in advising her to follow the path of\r\ndestruction. On the day when the relief of the Legations took place, Duke\r\nLan rushed headlong into the Palace, loudly announcing that the foreign\r\ndevils were already within the city walls. Tzŭ Hsi turned on him and\r\nasked how he could reconcile such a statement with his previous boasts.\r\n“I presume that the devils have flown here,” said she, “for you were\r\ntelling me only two days ago of our glorious victories near Tientsin;\r\nand yet all the time you knew well, as I knew, that the Viceroy and the\r\nLi Ping-heng were both dead.” Li Lien-ying, who was standing close by,\r\nhearing this, went out and informed the trembling crowd of eunuchs,\r\nadding, “The Old Buddha is in an unspeakable rage. There is nothing for\r\nit; we must make our escape and retire into Shensi. There we will await\r\nthe arrival of our reinforcements which will easily drive all these\r\ndevils back into the sea.” But the hardships and dangers of the flight\r\ntold even more severely on the chief eunuch than on the Old Buddha\r\nherself, and it was not until the Court’s safe establishment at Hsi-an\r\nthat he recovered his self-possession.\r\n\r\nCertain information conveyed by an official of the Household in exile to\r\na fellow provincial at Peking, throws considerable light on the manner in\r\nwhich the Court lived during those troublous days, and the part played\r\nin affairs of State by the chief eunuch and Tzŭ Hsi’s other favourites\r\nof the Household. We take the following disconnected notes from this\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nWhen Ts’en Ch’un-hsüan (Governor of Shensi) came to meet the Court on the\r\nShansi frontier, the Old Buddha, raising the curtain of her sedan-chair,\r\nlooked out and said to him, “Have you any idea of what we have suffered\r\nin Peking?” “I do not know all,” he replied. Pointing angrily at Li, she\r\nsaid, “It was all his doing; he has brought ruin upon me.” The chief\r\neunuch hung his head, and for once had nothing to say. Later on, when the\r\nfearless Ts’en saw the eunuchs under Li’s orders mercilessly harassing\r\nthe countryside in their search for plunder, he promptly reported matters\r\nto the Empress and obtained her somewhat reluctant permission to execute\r\nthree of the offenders on the spot. He was sorely tempted to include the\r\nchief eunuch in the number of his victims, but realising how greatly Her\r\nMajesty depended upon her favourite attendant, he feared to run the risk\r\nof inconveniencing and offending her. Nevertheless, Li had a narrow\r\nescape. Later on, when Li had recovered his equanimity, and the Court\r\nhad settled down to its usual routine, the eunuch revenged himself on\r\nthe Governor, with the help of Jung Lu, by having him transferred to the\r\nGovernorship of Shansi. He did this, not only because the post in Shansi\r\nwas considered a dangerous one, owing to the fear of pursuit by the\r\nAllies, but because Ts’en had gradually made himself most useful to Her\r\nMajesty by superintending the expenditure of her Household. The Governor\r\nwas justly famous throughout the Empire for his incorruptible honesty,\r\nso that, when placed in charge of the Palace accounts, these speedily\r\nshowed a very considerable reduction in expenditure. The first result\r\nof this _régime_ was to put a stop to all the “squeeze” of the eunuchs,\r\nand to place their salaries upon a definite and moderate basis. Ts’en\r\nrapidly attained an intimate and confidential position with Her Majesty,\r\nto the great and increasing wrath of the chief eunuch, who left no stone\r\nunturned to injure him, and eventually succeeded, with the help of Jung\r\nLu, in inducing Her Majesty to dispense with his personal services. For\r\nover a month, however, the Old Buddha spent hours daily discussing public\r\nand private affairs with this fearless and upright official, and it would\r\nhave been well for her had she retained him and others of his quality\r\nabout her to counteract the corrupt tendencies of her Manchu clansmen and\r\nthe eunuchs. After Ts’en’s transfer to Shansi, the chief eunuch did not\r\nscruple to suppress and destroy many of the memorials which as Governor\r\nhe addressed to the Old Buddha, and which Li did not desire his mistress\r\nto see. Gradually he re-established himself as completely as before in\r\nthe confidence and favour of his mistress, and before the Court’s return\r\nto Peking he had become if anything more familiarly arrogant than at any\r\nprevious stage in his career. At audiences given to the highest officials\r\nhe would even go so far as to refuse to transmit Her Majesty’s orders,\r\nbluntly informing her that he was tired and that there had been enough\r\npublic business for that day!\r\n\r\nThe vast quantities of tribute levied by the Court from the Southern\r\nProvinces at this time were handled in the first instance by Li\r\nLien-ying, whose apartments were stacked with heaps of dragon robes,\r\ntribute silk and other valuables. Of all the tribute paid in bullion,\r\nthe Empress Dowager’s share was one-half, while the eunuchs divided\r\none-fifth, and the balance was handed over to Jung Lu for military\r\npurposes and his own emolument. So profitable was the eunuchs’ business\r\nat Hsi-an and Kai-feng, that Li Lien-ying did his utmost to dissuade the\r\nOld Buddha from returning to Peking, endeavouring to frighten her by\r\nalarming prognostications of the vengeance of the foreign Powers. Li’s\r\nmotives were not entirely mercenary, however, for there is no doubt that\r\nfor a long time he fully expected to find his own name on the “black\r\nlist” of the Legations, and that it fully deserved to figure there. He\r\ndirected the second eunuch, named Ts’ui, to communicate to him daily\r\nthe latest news from Peking, and it was only when reassured by reports\r\nfrom Prince Ch’ing, that his courage returned, and his opposition to the\r\nCourt’s return ceased. The conciliatory attitude, which he eventually\r\nadopted towards the Empress Dowager’s reform policy, was largely induced\r\nby the good advice which he received from Jung Lu, who strongly urged him\r\nto control his reactionary opinions and violent temper.\r\n\r\nThe amount of tribute paid in silver to the Court at Hsi-an was over\r\nfive million taels, the quota from each Province being kept separate.\r\nThe chief eunuch was assisted in the supervision of the tribute accounts\r\nby another favourite of the Old Buddha, a eunuch named Sun, whose\r\ncovetousness and bullying methods of “squeeze” were almost equal to\r\nthose of his chief. On one occasion the deputy in charge of the tribute\r\nfrom Hupei was paying in bullion to the Imperial Household, and Sun was\r\ntallying the amounts with a steelyard. He said there was a shortage.\r\n“That cannot be so,” said the deputy, “for every shoe of Hupei silver\r\nweighs fifty taels exactly, so that there can be no mistake.” The\r\neunuch looked at him insolently, and said, “How many times have you\r\nbrought tribute, and what do you know about the customs of the Court?”\r\nThe frightened deputy persisted that all was in order. Sun then said\r\nangrily: “I suppose, then, you mean that the Old Buddha’s scales are\r\nfalse?” He was just proceeding to assault the unfortunate deputy, when\r\nthe Old Buddha herself, overhearing the argument (the court-yards of her\r\nresidence being very small) came out and directed the eunuch to bring\r\nthe silver into her own apartments, where she would weigh it herself. “I\r\nbelieve there has been a great deal of leakage lately,” she said; “it is\r\nthe business of my eunuchs to see that I am not cheated.” The deputy took\r\nhis departure, looking extremely crestfallen, but on his way out he was\r\nmet by Chi Lu, the Controller of the Household, who said to him, “We all\r\nknow you have been having a bad time of it, but you must not mind. These\r\neunuchs have been making very little money of late, for the Old Buddha\r\nhas been keeping a very sharp watch on them; you must therefore excuse\r\nthem. And they have lost a great deal in Peking.”\r\n\r\nTribute of twenty-four kinds was received from Canton, but the eunuchs on\r\ntheir own initiative, and in order to compel _largesse_, rejected nine\r\ndifferent kinds of articles, so that the official in charge was greatly\r\nalarmed, fearing that the Old Buddha would accuse him of having stolen\r\nthe things which the eunuchs refused to receive. This was one of their\r\ncommonest methods of levying tribute on their own account; another was to\r\nmake large purchases in the name of the Empress, and refuse to pay for\r\nthem. Much hardship was inflicted on the people of Hsi-an, and indeed of\r\nthe entire province, from their depredations, especially because at the\r\ntime Shensi was already suffering from the beginnings of famine, caused\r\nby the prolonged drought. It is recorded in the accounts of the Governor\r\nTs’en, that flour cost 96 cash a pound, eggs 34 cash apiece, and pork\r\n400 cash a pound, while fish was almost unobtainable; these prices being\r\nabout six times as high as those ruling in southern China.\r\n\r\nMany of the eunuchs appeared to take pleasure in humiliating the Emperor,\r\nand subjecting him to petty annoyances, which often roused him to\r\npetulant outbursts of temper. In one letter from the Court at Hsi-an it\r\nwas reported that His Majesty appeared to be a little wrong in the head,\r\nfor he would spend his time playing foolish games, such as hide-and-seek,\r\nwith the younger eunuchs, until interrupted by the Empress Dowager, when\r\nhe would immediately get into a corner and assume a sullen demeanour. At\r\nother times, when irritated, he would give way to violent fits of rage\r\nand throw the household crockery at the heads of his attendants. These\r\nreports must be received with caution, as they were frequently spread\r\nabroad by the chief eunuch and members of the reactionary party in order\r\nto damage His Majesty in the eyes of the outside world.\r\n\r\nAs above stated, after the return of the Court from its journeying in\r\nthe wilderness (1902) Li’s influence with the Empress Dowager was, if\r\nanything, greater than before, all the internal affairs of the Palace\r\nbeing under his supreme control. Following Her Majesty’s example,\r\nhowever, he professed his complete conversion to the necessity of reform,\r\nand even gave his approval, after certain amendments had been made by\r\nthe Grand Council and by himself, to her programme for the granting of\r\na Constitution. Jesting with Her Majesty in his usual familiar manner,\r\nhe was heard on more than one occasion to predict her conversion to\r\nChristianity. “We are only sham devils now, Old Buddha,” he said.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, and in spite of advancing years and infirmity, he has\r\nclung, and still clings, tenaciously to the perquisites and privileges\r\nof his stewardship, fiercely defending the eunuch system and his own\r\npost by all the means (and they are many) in his power. When, in 1901,\r\nT’ao Mo, late Viceroy of Canton, sent in his famous Memorial urging\r\nthat, in view of the greatly reduced number of the Imperial concubines,\r\nthe eunuchs should be replaced by female attendants, Li successfully\r\nintrigued to prevent this document reaching Her Majesty until he had\r\ntaken effective steps to prevent her being advised in favour of the\r\nsuggestion. T’ao Mo’s Memorial was as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The prosperity of the State depends absolutely upon the\r\n    virtue of the ruler. Where the sovereign surrounds himself\r\n    with wise and just men, the country must benefit; where he\r\n    chooses time-servers to advise him, rebellion and chaos will\r\n    be the inevitable result. If one human being be called upon to\r\n    attend to the multifarious duties of the State, in addition\r\n    to managing the internal affairs of the Palace, his position\r\n    may be glorious indeed, but the responsibilities thereof are\r\n    too great for any man to bear. Even a sovereign, surrounded by\r\n    men of the sternest integrity, might well pause and falter at\r\n    the dread chances of failure. But how can a nation possibly\r\n    escape dire misfortune when, between sovereign and subjects is\r\n    set up a barrier composed of men of the most contemptible and\r\n    degraded kind? These creatures are not necessarily all traitors\r\n    or notorious scoundrels; it is sufficient, for the undoing of\r\n    a sovereign, that he be surrounded at all hours by illiterate\r\n    persons, lacking in moral perception, who pander to his moods\r\n    and minister to his caprices. Even the worst Minister of State\r\n    has not the same opportunity of influencing his Emperor for\r\n    evil: but these eunuchs are for ever about and around him.\r\n    Intimacy with eunuchs necessarily brings about a sapping of\r\n    the moral fibre; any ruler exposed to their influences cannot\r\n    possibly keep in touch with his people.\r\n\r\n    “But if we wish to root out these influences, we must proceed\r\n    as if we were weeding out tares in a field. If we leave the\r\n    roots in the ground, they will sooner or later spring up again\r\n    to fresh life. Complete eradication is the only cure. His\r\n    Majesty is come of age and his character is daily developing;\r\n    how deeply he must deplore the fact that he is compelled\r\n    to associate with this class of men at a time when he is\r\n    doing his best to introduce a policy of reform! If previous\r\n    Dynasties employed eunuchs it was because of the large number\r\n    of concubines in the Palace, but his present Majesty’s harem\r\n    is small, and he might therefore preferably employ female\r\n    attendants to minister to his personal wants, while the\r\n    official duties of the Household might be discharged by men of\r\n    good birth and education. Why should it be necessary to employ\r\n    eunuchs for such posts?\r\n\r\n    “At the present time, the Court at Hsi-an employs an enormous\r\n    number of eunuchs; a favourable opportunity therefore presents\r\n    itself for reducing their number, retaining only some twenty\r\n    or thirty of the more respectable among them. Orders should be\r\n    given, after the Court’s return, that for the future no more\r\n    eunuchs shall be engaged, and the Palace administration should\r\n    be thoroughly reorganised. By this means, long-standing abuses\r\n    will be removed, and the glory of your Majesty’s reign will be\r\n    enhanced for all time.\r\n\r\n    “At this moment, many reforms are being projected, in regard to\r\n    which Your Majesties have received numerous suggestions from\r\n    many high officials. But in my opinion, this question of the\r\n    employment of eunuchs, though apparently of minor importance,\r\n    transcends all others, and the possibility of reform depends\r\n    largely on their removal. The system has been abolished in\r\n    all foreign countries and persists only in China. It exposes\r\n    us to much adverse criticism and contumely, and by abolishing\r\n    it we should gain the respect of civilised nations. As an\r\n    official holding a provincial post, I am prohibited by law from\r\n    criticising the administration of the Palace; nevertheless, I\r\n    hold it to be my duty at this juncture to offer my suggestions,\r\n    however humble and worthless, in token of my gratitude to Your\r\n    Majesties for your generous favours.”\r\n\r\nSince that day, there have been repeated denunciations of the eunuch\r\nsystem, and rumours of their impending removal, but their influence shows\r\nlittle sign of diminution, and officials of the courage and integrity\r\nof T’ao Mo are a small minority in the Mandarinate. Reform measures on\r\npaper are numerous enough, measures forecasting self-denial and zeal\r\nfor the common good at some future and undetermined date, but it is\r\nsignificant of the existing condition of affairs and the strong hold of\r\nthe powers of reaction, that the native Press has lately passed from its\r\nformer robust independence under complete official control, and that the\r\nvoice of Young China, which formerly denounced the eunuchs and other\r\ncauses of national degeneration, is but faintly heard in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nA QUESTION OF ETIQUETTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following secret Memorial, submitted by the Censor Wu K’o-tu, in\r\n1873, casts no direct light on the life and character of the Empress\r\nDowager; it is of permanent interest nevertheless, and valuable, in that\r\nit enables us to realise something of the unbounded arrogance of the\r\nChinese official class and the childish ignorance of that Court in which\r\nTzŭ Hsi lived and moved and had her being. Documents like these—their\r\nnumber is legion for those who look for them—throw into strong relief\r\nthe futility of western diplomacy confronted by a national sentiment of\r\ncontempt for the barbarian so deep-rooted and far-reaching; and they\r\nmake one wonder at the persistence of those comfortable delusions,\r\nthose facile lines of least resistance, which the foreign Powers and\r\ntheir Legations have cherished to this day in spite of many humiliating\r\nexperiences. And if, from the general, one returns to particular study\r\nof the remarkable woman whose personality dominated the destinies of men\r\nand the foreign relations of her country for half a century, the state of\r\naffairs revealed by documents like these must compel unstinted admiration\r\nfor a mind so obviously superior to its environment. Finally, there lurks\r\nin this Memorial a certain quality of (possibly unconscious) humour which\r\nmay justify its inclusion, in the nature of an _entremets_, at this stage\r\nof our narrative:—\r\n\r\n    “_A Secret Memorial urging the Throne to put a stop to official\r\n    wrangling and to excuse the Ministers of foreign nations from\r\n    kneeling at audiences, in order that our magnanimity may be\r\n    proved and our prestige exalted. A prayer based, moreover, on\r\n    the fact that our demands in this matter cannot be successfully\r\n    pressed and that protracted discussion has so far resulted in a\r\n    hopeless deadlock._\r\n\r\n    “From the day when first the foreign Ministers asked to be\r\n    permitted to present their credentials, nearly six months ago,\r\n    our statesmen have discussed the question, without arriving at\r\n    any solution of its difficulties. First, they debated whether\r\n    the Ministers should be granted audience at all, and having\r\n    agreed upon this, they proceeded to discuss whether they should\r\n    be compelled to kneel.\r\n\r\n    “In discussing this matter with certain minor officials, it has\r\n    occurred to me to wonder wherein really lies the gravity of the\r\n    question sufficient to justify all this bother and excitement?\r\n    As Mencius remarks, ‘Why should the Superior Man engage in\r\n    altercation with birds and beasts?’\r\n\r\n    “I have heard, and believe, that the rulers of foreign nations\r\n    are deposed by their subjects for all the world like pawns on\r\n    a chess board. I have seen with my own eyes the foreigners\r\n    who live in Peking walking abroad, preceded by the females\r\n    of their household either on foot or in sedan chairs; the\r\n    men folk following meekly in their rear, like servants—all\r\n    unashamed. They have made some score of treaties with China,\r\n    containing at least ten thousand written characters. Is there\r\n    a word in any one of them concerning reverence for parents,\r\n    or the cultivation of virtue and respect for the nine canons\r\n    of rightful conduct? No! Is there one word in any one of them\r\n    as to the observance of ceremony, as to duty, integrity and\r\n    a proper sense of shame, the four cardinal principles of our\r\n    nation? Again, no! All that they speak of is material profit.\r\n    ‘Such and such a clause implies benefits or profits for China.’\r\n    They think only of profit, and with the meretricious hope\r\n    of profit they beguile the Chinese people. These men know\r\n    not even the meaning of duty and ceremony, wisdom and good\r\n    faith, yet we profess, forsooth, to expect them to act as if\r\n    they were endowed with the five cardinal virtues! They know\r\n    not the meaning of the Heaven-ordained relationship between\r\n    Sovereign and Minister, between father and son, husband and\r\n    wife, elder and younger brother, friend and friend—yet we\r\n    propose to require them to conform to the five principles of\r\n    duty! It seems to me that one might as well bring together dogs\r\n    and horses, goats and pigs, in a public hall and compel these\r\n    creatures to perform the evolutions of the dance!\r\n\r\n    “If we insist upon their reverently kneeling, in what manner\r\n    will it increase the lustre of the Throne’s prestige? If we\r\n    excuse them from kneeling, how can this possibly affect the\r\n    Sovereign’s majesty?\r\n\r\n    “But our statesmen hold that long and careful deliberation\r\n    before assenting to the foreigners’ wishes in this matter will\r\n    cause the latter to say: ‘If so great pressure be required to\r\n    extract even this trifling concession from China, how small\r\n    must be our hopes of future success in dealing with great\r\n    matters.’ In this way, it is thought, we may cause their\r\n    everlasting demands on China to cease, and we should thus gain,\r\n    while they lose, prestige. But, in my humble opinion, our\r\n    nation’s prestige depends not on any foreigners’ estimate of\r\n    us, nor is their humiliation to be brought about in this way.\r\n    If once they perceive that we attach a real importance to their\r\n    kneeling at audience, and that we are loth to exempt them from\r\n    this ceremony, while at the same time they are fully aware that\r\n    we dare not go to war with them, they will simply insist the\r\n    more firmly on their demands and threaten us with war if we\r\n    fail to comply. Our weakness once exposed, they will stick at\r\n    nothing.\r\n\r\n    “I have heard that, in their despatches and treaties, the\r\n    puny hobgoblin or petty monsters whom they have the audacity\r\n    to call ‘Emperors’ are placed on a level of equality with His\r\n    Sacred Majesty! If our statesmen can brook an outrage like this\r\n    and feel no shame, why should they trouble themselves about\r\n    the foreign Envoys’ refusal to kneel? Two years ago, when the\r\n    Russian barbarians were pressing in upon China from Ili and\r\n    all the North-west, when they were seizing vast stretches of\r\n    our territory, and carrying out their policy of aggression on\r\n    a scale unparalleled in all the history of our relations with\r\n    barbarians; when their crafty and deep-laid plans threatened\r\n    the Empire with the gravest dangers—our statesmen showed\r\n    no sense of shame. But now, we are to believe that there is\r\n    humiliation to China in the Ministers’ unwillingness to kneel!\r\n    Our statesmen appear to imagine that if foreign nations decline\r\n    to comply with the formalities of Chinese etiquette, China will\r\n    thereby be disgraced, but in my humble opinion, compliance on\r\n    their part would jeopardise our country. From ancient times\r\n    immemorial the policy of the Government has been guided by\r\n    two main factors, viz., the exigencies of the moment and the\r\n    amount of force available to carry out a given line of action.\r\n    At the present moment China’s position does not justify her in\r\n    contending for this point and our national forces are quite\r\n    inadequate to impose our will upon any other nation. China\r\n    should therefore seek to develop efficiency and in the meantime\r\n    resort to compromises.\r\n\r\n    “A disciple of Confucius once asked the Sage in what lay the\r\n    art of government. The Master replied that the three first\r\n    requisites were, a sufficiency of food, a sufficiency of\r\n    troops and the confidence of the people. The disciple then\r\n    asked which of these three could be dispensed with, in case of\r\n    urgent necessity? Confucius replied, ‘Dispense first with the\r\n    troops and next with the food supply.’ From this we may learn\r\n    that the Sage, aiming at perfection in the art of government,\r\n    would approve of no rash or ill-considered action in deciding\r\n    a matter of this kind. A clear course of action should be\r\n    definitely pre-arranged by careful thought; there should be\r\n    no question of any hasty or immature decision, calculated\r\n    only to involve the country in difficulties. Our statesmen\r\n    ought, in the first instance, to have examined this Audience\r\n    question in all its bearings, weighing carefully the issues\r\n    involved, and should have considered whether, in view of the\r\n    relative strength of China and foreign nations, resistance was\r\n    advisable. If China were not well aware of her own weakness,\r\n    she would insist upon her rights, and without weighing the\r\n    relative importance in each case; but as, in the present\r\n    instance, she does not feel strong enough to insist, the\r\n    Ministers should have been told at once that the Throne would\r\n    waive the question of their kneeling at audience, and that His\r\n    Majesty would dispense in their case with the formalities and\r\n    ceremonies required by the etiquette of the Chinese Court.\r\n    By so doing we should have avoided the outward and visible\r\n    manifestations of weakness, and foreigners would have been led\r\n    to perceive how small is the importance we attach to them as\r\n    individuals. Would not this be an example of enlightenment and\r\n    statesmanship to impress Chinese and barbarians alike?\r\n\r\n    “But no; we must needs begin by raising objections to receiving\r\n    the foreign Envoys, and then, having been compelled to yield\r\n    this point, we proceeded to require them to kneel at audience.\r\n    The only possible result of this will be that we shall finally\r\n    have to yield to their protest; but our acquiescence will\r\n    perforce be performed with bad grace and with every appearance\r\n    of an act performed under compulsion. It was precisely in this\r\n    way that we blundered when we made the Treaty of Tientsin. I am\r\n    convinced that the Throne’s position will be an unenviable one\r\n    if the views of these statesmen be adopted, and would suggest\r\n    as a solution of the difficulty, that His Majesty should decide\r\n    for himself, and inform his Councillors that the question is\r\n    really one of minor importance. The foreign Ministers are\r\n    not Chinese subjects; why, then, should they conform to a\r\n    Chinese ceremony? If they were to do so, and if the ceremonial\r\n    were slovenly or awkwardly performed, might it not become a\r\n    burlesque? And if the foreign Ministers were thus made to look\r\n    ridiculous, would not China be violating the principle which\r\n    lays down that we must ‘treat strangers from afar with courtesy\r\n    and consideration’? If it should happen—as well might be—that\r\n    the spectators should be unable to control their mirth at so\r\n    ridiculous a spectacle, might not the humiliation felt by the\r\n    foreigners at their discomfiture, and their consequent rage,\r\n    lead them to declare war against China? It seems, therefore,\r\n    advisable that the Throne should issue a Decree excusing the\r\n    Envoys from performing the ceremonies of our Court, and, in\r\n    the event of their ignorantly offending against any of the\r\n    rules of etiquette, that we should exercise a wise forbearance.\r\n    Our statesmen should refrain from querulous arguments; they\r\n    should bear in mind that to dispute with these foreigners is\r\n    unworthy of us. In this they will display the perfection of\r\n    magnanimity. At the same time it should be carefully explained\r\n    that this Decree is an act of clemency, of the Emperor’s own\r\n    initiative, and contrary to the advice of his Ministers. It\r\n    must not serve as a precedent by reason of which foreigners may\r\n    be led to demand other concessions from China, or to coerce\r\n    her in other directions. By these means we shall preserve our\r\n    self-respect, and at the same time prevent all possibility of\r\n    our people attempting reprisals against foreigners, to avenge\r\n    what they might regard as an insult to China. And for the rest,\r\n    let us proceed to develop our strength, biding our time.\r\n\r\n    “One word only would I add, of warning. It is possible that the\r\n    audacious and treacherous foreigners may endeavour to address\r\n    His Majesty at audience. Our statesmen should be prepared in\r\n    advance with the proper reply to make in such a case, so that\r\n    they may avoid being put to sudden confusion.\r\n\r\n    “I, the writer of this worthless Memorial, am but an ignorant\r\n    inhabitant of a wild and remote district, and know nothing\r\n    of affairs of State. Greatly daring and of rash utterance, I\r\n    present this my Memorial, knowing the while that in so doing I\r\n    risk the penalty of death.”\r\n\r\nTo this Memorial the following Rescript was issued by the Empresses\r\nDowager:—\r\n\r\n    “We have perused this Memorial and find it not lacking in\r\n    point. The foreign Ministers are hereby permitted to appear\r\n    at Audience and to act thereat in accordance with their own\r\n    national Court ceremonies. Thus the Throne will display its\r\n    benevolent indulgence to the strangers from afar and make a\r\n    proper distinction between Chinese and barbarians.”\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the author of the Memorial was the same upright\r\nand fearless Censor, Wu K’o-tu, whose name became a household word upon\r\nhis committing suicide at the grave of T’ung-Chih, as an act of protest\r\nagainst the illegality of the succession ordained by Tzŭ Hsi. If such\r\nwere (and are) the views held by China’s bravest and best, can we wonder\r\nat the absurdities that have led the ignorant masses to sudden uprisings\r\nand deeds of violence against the foreigners? Wu K’o-tu’s trenchant scorn\r\nof the sordid commercialism that marks the foreigners’ Treaties, is\r\ntypical of the attitude of the orthodox Chinese scholar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMAJORITY AND DEATH OF THE EMPEROR T’UNG-CHIH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh year of T’ung-Chih (November 1872) the Empresses Dowager,\r\nas Co-Regents, issued a Decree, recounting the circumstances which had\r\nled to the Regency (which they once more described as having been thrust\r\nupon them), and announced the fact that His Majesty’s education having\r\nbeen completed, they now proposed to hand over to him the reigns of\r\ngovernment; they therefore directed that the Court of Astronomers should\r\nselect an auspicious day upon which His Majesty should assume control.\r\nThe astrologers and soothsayers having announced that the 26th day of\r\nthe 1st Moon was of fortunate omen (wherein, as far as the Emperor was\r\nconcerned, they lied), the Co-Regents issued on that day the last Decree\r\nof their first Regency, which is worth reproducing:—\r\n\r\n    “His Majesty assumes to-day the control of the Government, and\r\n    our joy at this auspicious event is in some degree blended\r\n    with feelings of anxiety as to the possible results of this\r\n    change; but we bear in mind the fact that his sacred Ancestors\r\n    have all feared the Almighty, and endeavoured to follow in the\r\n    sacred traditions of their predecessors. At the moment, peace\r\n    has not been completely restored throughout the Empire, for\r\n    rebellion is still rife in Yünnan, Shensi and the North-West\r\n    region. It behoves the Emperor to bear steadily in mind the\r\n    greatness of the task which God and his ancestors have laid\r\n    upon him alone, and carefully to obey the House laws of the\r\n    Dynasty in all things. When not actually engaged on business of\r\n    State, he should employ his time in studying the classics and\r\n    the precedents of history, carefully enquiring into the causes\r\n    which have produced good or bad government, from the earliest\r\n    times down to the present day. He should be thrifty and\r\n    diligent, endeavouring to make perfect his government. This has\r\n    been our one constant endeavour since we took upon ourselves\r\n    the Regency, the one ideal that has been steadily before our\r\n    eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe Decree concludes with the usual exhortation to the Grand Council and\r\nthe high officers of the Provincial administration, to serve the Throne\r\nwith zeal and loyalty.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Emperor was concerned, these admirable sentiments appeared\r\nto have little or no effect, for his conduct from the outset was\r\nundutiful, not to say disrespectful, to his mother. Nor was this to be\r\nwondered at, when we remember that since his early boyhood he had shown\r\na marked preference for the Empress Dowager of the East (Tzŭ An) and\r\nthat he was well aware of the many dissensions and intrigues rife in the\r\nPalace generally, and particularly between the Co-Regents. He had now\r\nattained his seventeenth year, and, with it, something of the autocratic\r\nand imperious nature of his august parent. He was encouraged in his\r\nindependent attitude by the wife whom Tzŭ Hsi had chosen for him, the\r\nvirtuous A-lu-te. This lady was of patrician origin, being a daughter of\r\nthe assistant Imperial tutor, Ch’ung Ch’i. In the first flush of supreme\r\nauthority, the boy Emperor and his young wife would appear to have\r\ncompletely ignored the danger of their position, but they were speedily\r\nto learn by bitter experience that Tzŭ Hsi was not to be opposed, and\r\nthat to live peacefully with her in the Palace was an end that could\r\nonly be attained by complete submission to her will. The first trouble\r\narose from the Emperor’s refusal to submit State documents for his\r\nmother’s inspection, but there were soon other and more serious causes\r\nof friction. But above and behind all lay the ominous fact that, in the\r\nevent of an heir being born to the Emperor, A-lu-te would from that day\r\nbecome Empress mother, and in the event of the Emperor’s subsequent\r\ndecease, to her would belong by right the title of Empress Dowager,\r\nso that, come what might, Tzŭ Hsi would be relegated to a position of\r\nobscurity and insignificant authority. It is impossible to overlook this\r\nfact in forming our opinion of subsequent events, and especially of the\r\nmotives which actuated the Empress Dowager when, after the death of\r\nT’ung-Chih, she insisted on the election of another infant Emperor at all\r\ncosts and in violation of the sacred laws of Dynastic succession. Apart\r\nfrom her inability to brook any form of opposition and her absolutely\r\nunscrupulous methods for ridding herself of anything or anyone who stood\r\nin the path of her ambition, no impartial estimate of her action at this\r\nperiod can deny the fact that it was entirely to her interest that the\r\nEmperor T’ung-Chih should not have an heir, and that his Consort should\r\nfollow him speedily, in the event of his “mounting the Dragon chariot,\r\nand proceeding on the long journey,” All commentators agree that Tzŭ\r\nHsi encouraged the youthful Emperor’s tendencies to dissipated habits,\r\nand that, when these had resulted in a serious illness, she allowed it\r\nto wreck havoc with his delicate constitution, without providing him\r\nwith such medical assistance as might have been available. One of the\r\nmembers of the Imperial Household, by name Kuei Ching,[26] deploring the\r\nEmperor’s licentious habits and foreseeing his early death, took occasion\r\nto urge that the deplorable influence exercised over him by disreputable\r\neunuchs should be removed, and that greater care should be taken of his\r\nmanners, morals and health. He even went so far, in his zeal, as to\r\ndecapitate several of the offending eunuchs, but in so doing he incurred\r\nnot only the displeasure of the Empress Dowager, but of the Emperor\r\nhimself, who desired neither criticism nor assistance from anyone around\r\nhim. The unfortunate Kuei Ching was therefore compelled to resign his\r\npost, and to leave the Emperor to his fate. His colleagues, the Ministers\r\nof the Household, Wen Hsi and Kuei Pao, men of a very different stamp,\r\nand open partisans of the Empress Dowager, not only did nothing to\r\nrestrain the Emperor from his vicious courses, but actually encouraged\r\nhim, so that it became a matter of common knowledge and notorious in the\r\ncapital that they and the Emperor together were wont to consort with\r\nall the evil characters in the worst localities of the Southern City.\r\nIt became cause for scandal in the Palace itself that His Majesty would\r\nreturn from his orgies long after the hour fixed for the morning audience\r\nwith his high officers of State. He was mixed up in many a drunken\r\nbrawl and consorted with the lowest dregs of the Chinese city, so that\r\nit was no matter for surprise when he contracted the germs of disease\r\nwhich speedily led to his death. Already in 1873 it was apparent that\r\nthe Dragon Throne would soon be vacant. In December 1874, he contracted\r\nsmallpox and during his illness the Empresses Dowager were called upon to\r\nassume control of the Government. Towards the end of the month, he issued\r\nthe following Decree.\r\n\r\n    “We have had the good fortune[27] this month to contract\r\n    smallpox, and their Majesties, the Empresses Dowager, have\r\n    shown the greatest possible tenderness in the care for our\r\n    person. They have also consented to peruse all Memorials and\r\n    State papers on our behalf, and to carry on the business of\r\n    the State, for which we are deeply grateful. We feel bound\r\n    to confer upon their Majesties additional titles of honour,\r\n    so as to make some return, however small, for their infinite\r\n    goodness.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s enfeebled constitution was unable to resist the ravages of\r\nhis combined diseases, and his physical condition became in the highest\r\ndegree deplorable; at 8 P.M. on the 13th January 1875, in the presence\r\nof the Empresses Dowager and some twenty Princes and Ministers of the\r\nHousehold, he “ascended the Dragon” and was wafted on high. Amongst\r\nthose present at his death-bed were the Princes Kung and Ch’un, as well\r\nas Tzŭ Hsi’s devoted henchman and admirer Jung Lu. After the Emperor’s\r\ndeath, a Censor, bolder than his fellows, impeached the two Ministers of\r\nthe Household who had openly encouraged the Emperor in his dissipated\r\ncourses, and Tzŭ Hsi, having no further use for their services, dismissed\r\nthem from office. As further proof of her virtuous admiration for\r\nfaithful service and disinterested conduct, she invited Kuei Ching\r\nto resume his appointment, praising his loyalty; but he declined the\r\ninvitation, having by this time formed his own opinion of the value of\r\nvirtue in Her Majesty’s service.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor having died without issue, all would have been plain and\r\nmeritorious sailing for Tzŭ Hsi and her retention of supreme power, had\r\nit not been for the unpleasant fact, known to all the Court, that the\r\nEmperor’s consort, A-lu-te, was _enceinte_ and therefore might confer an\r\nheir on the deceased sovereign. In the event of a son being born, it was\r\nclear that both A-lu-te and Tzŭ An would _ipso facto_ acquire authority\r\ntheoretically higher than her own, since her title of Empress Mother had\r\nlapsed by the death of T’ung-Chih, and her original position was only\r\nthat of a secondary consort. As the mother of the Emperor, she had by\r\nright occupied a predominant position during his minority, but this was\r\nnow ended. It was to her motherhood that she had owed the first claims to\r\npower; now she had nothing but her own boundless ambition, courage and\r\nintelligence to take the place of lawful claims and natural ties. With\r\nthe death of her son the Emperor, and the near prospect of A-lu-te’s\r\nconfinement, it was clear that her own position would require desperate\r\nremedies, if her power was to remain undiminished.\r\n\r\nAmong the senior members of the Imperial Clan, many of whom were jealous\r\nof the influence of the Yehonala branch, there was a strong movement\r\nin favour of placing on the Throne a grandson of the eldest son of the\r\nvenerated Emperor Tao-Kuang, namely, the infant Prince P’u Lun, whose\r\nclaims were excellent, in so far as he was of a generation lower than the\r\ndeceased T’ung-Chih, but complicated by the fact that his father had been\r\nadopted into the direct line from another branch. The Princes and nobles\r\nwho favoured this choice pointed out that the infant P’u Lun was almost\r\nthe only nominee who would satisfy the laws of succession and allow of\r\nthe proper sacrifices being performed to the spirit of the deceased\r\nT’ung-Chih.[28]\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi, however, was too determined to retain her position and power\r\nto allow any weight to attach to sentimental, religious, or other\r\nconsiderations. If, in order to secure her objects, a violation of\r\nthe ancestral and House-laws were necessary, she was not the woman to\r\nhesitate, and she trusted to her own intelligence and the servility\r\nof her tools in the Censorate to put matters right, or, at least, to\r\novercome all opposition. At this period she was on bad terms with her\r\ncolleague and Co-Regent, whom she had never forgiven for her share in the\r\ndecapitation of her Chief Eunuch, An Te-hai; she hated and mistrusted\r\nPrince Kung, and there is hardly a doubt that she had resolved to get\r\nrid of the young Empress A-lu-te before the birth of her child. The\r\nonly member of the Imperial family with whom she was at this time on\r\nintimate terms was her brother-in-law, Prince Ch’un, the seventh son of\r\nthe Emperor Tao-Kuang. This Prince, an able man, though dissolute in his\r\nhabits, had married her favourite sister, the younger Yehonala, and it\r\nwill, therefore, be readily understood that the reasons which actuated\r\nher in deciding to place this Prince’s infant son upon the Throne were of\r\nthe very strongest. During his minority she would continue to rule the\r\nEmpire, and, should he live to come of age, her sister, the Emperor’s\r\nmother, might be expected to exert her influence to keep him in the path\r\nof dutiful obedience. Tzŭ Hsi’s objection to the son of Prince Kung was\r\npartly due to the fact that she had never forgiven his father for his\r\nshare in the death of the eunuch, An Te-hai, and other offences, and\r\npartly because the young Prince was now in his seventeenth year, and\r\nwould, therefore, almost immediately have assumed the Government in\r\nhis own person. Tzŭ Hsi was aware that, in that event, it would be in\r\naccordance with tradition and the methods adopted by the stronger party\r\nin the Forbidden City for ridding itself of inconvenient rivals and\r\nconflicting authorities, that either she should be relegated to complete\r\nobscurity here below, or forcibly assisted on the road to Heaven. It was\r\nthus absolutely necessary for her to put a stop to this appointment, and,\r\nas usual, she acted with prompt thoroughness, which speedily triumphed\r\nover the disorganised efforts of her opponents. By adroit intrigues,\r\nexercised chiefly through her favourite eunuch, she headed off any\r\nattempt at co-operation between the supporters of Prince P’u Lun and\r\nthose of Prince Kung, while, with the aid of Jung Lu and the appearance\r\non the scene of a considerable force of Li Hung-chang’s Anhui troops, she\r\nprepared the way for the success of her own plans; her preparations made,\r\nshe summoned a Council of the Clansmen and high officials, to elect and\r\nappoint the new Emperor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE YANG HSIN TIEN. (Palace of “Mind Nurture.”)\r\n\r\nThe Emperor T’ung-Chih used this Palace as his residence during the whole\r\nof his reign.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Ogawa, Tokio._]\r\n\r\nThis solemn conclave took place in the Palace of “Mind Nurture,” on the\r\nwestern side of the Forbidden City, about a quarter of a mile distant\r\nfrom the palace in which the Emperor T’ung-Chih had expired. In addition\r\nto the Empresses Regent, those present numbered twenty-five in all,\r\nincluding several Princes and Imperial Clansmen, the members of the Grand\r\nCouncil, and several of the highest metropolitan officials; but of all\r\nthese, only five were Chinese. Prince Tsai Chih, the father of Prince P’u\r\nLun, was there, as well as Prince Kung, both representing the proposed\r\nlegitimate claims to the Throne. The approaches to the Palace were\r\nthronged with eunuchs, and Tzŭ Hsi had taken care, with the assistance\r\nof Jung Lu, that all the strategical points in the Forbidden City should\r\nbe held by troops on whose loyalty she could completely depend. Amongst\r\nthem were many of Jung Lu’s own Banner Corps, as well as detachments\r\nchiefly composed of members and adherents of the Yehonala clan. By Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s express orders, the newly-widowed Empress A-lu-te was excluded from\r\nthe Council meeting, and remained dutifully weeping by the bedside of\r\nher departed lord, who had already been arrayed in the ceremonial Dragon\r\nrobes.\r\n\r\nIn the Council Chamber Tzŭ Hsi and her colleague sat opposite to each\r\nother on Thrones; all the officials present were on their knees.\r\nTaking precedence as usual, and assuming as of right the _rôle_ of\r\nchief speaker, Tzŭ Hsi began by remarking that no time must be lost in\r\nselecting the new Emperor; it was not fitting that the Throne should\r\nremain vacant on the assumption that an heir would be born to His late\r\nMajesty. Prince Kung ventured to disagree with this opinion, expressing\r\nthe view that, as A-lu-te’s child would shortly be born, there should\r\nbe no difficulty in keeping back the news of the Emperor’s death for a\r\nlittle while; the child, if a boy, could then rightly and fittingly be\r\nplaced on the Throne, while in the event of the posthumous child being\r\na daughter, there would still be time enough to make selection of the\r\nEmperor’s successor. The Princes and Clansmen appeared to side with this\r\nview, but Tzŭ Hsi brushed it aside, observing that there were still\r\nrebellions unsuppressed in the south, and that if it were known that\r\nthe Throne was empty, the Dynasty might very well be overthrown. “When\r\nthe nest is destroyed, how many eggs will remain unbroken?” she asked.\r\nThe Grand Councillors and several senior statesmen, including the three\r\nChinese representatives from the south, expressed agreement with this\r\nview, for they realised that, given conditions of unrest, the recently\r\nactive Taiping rebels might very easily renew the anti-Dynastic movement.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Dowager of the East then gave it as her opinion that\r\nPrince Kung’s son should be chosen heir to the Throne; Prince Kung,\r\nin accordance with the customary etiquette, kowtowed and professed\r\nunwillingness that such honour should fall to his family, and suggested\r\nthat the youthful Prince P’u Lun should be elected. P’u Lun’s father in\r\nturn pleaded the unworthiness of his offspring, not because he really\r\nfelt any qualms on the subject, but because custom necessitated this\r\nself-denying attitude. “That has nothing to do with the case,” said Tzŭ\r\nHsi to the last speaker, “but as you are only the adopted son of Yi Wei”\r\n(the eldest son of the Emperor Tao-Kuang) “what precedent can any of you\r\nshow for placing on the Throne the heir of an adopted son?” Prince Kung,\r\ncalled upon to reply, hesitated, and suggested as a suitable precedent\r\nthe case of a Ming Emperor of the fifteenth century canonised as\r\nYing-Tsung. “That is a bad precedent,” replied the Empress, who had every\r\nprecedent of history at her finger ends. “The Emperor Ying-Tsung was not\r\nreally the son of his predecessor, but was palmed off on the Emperor\r\nby one of the Imperial concubines. His reign was a period of disaster;\r\nhe was for a time in captivity under the Mongols and afterwards lived\r\nin retirement at Peking for eight years while the Throne was occupied\r\nby his brother.” Turning next to her colleague she said, “As for me, I\r\npropose as heir to the Throne, Tsai Tien, the son of Yi Huan (Prince\r\nCh’un), and advise you all that we lose no time.” On hearing these words\r\nPrince Kung turned to his brother and angrily remarked: “Is the right\r\nof primogeniture[29] to be completely ignored?” “Let the matter then be\r\ndecided by taking a vote,” said Tzŭ Hsi, and her colleague offered no\r\nobjections. The result of the vote was that seven of the Princes, led by\r\nPrince Ch’un, voted for Prince P’u Lun, and three for the son of Prince\r\nKung; the remainder of the Council voted solidly for Tzŭ Hsi’s nominee.\r\nThe voting was done openly and the result was entirely due to the strong\r\nwill and dominating personality of the woman whom all had for years\r\nrecognised as the real ruler of China. When the voting was concluded,\r\nTzŭ An, who was always more anxious for an amicable settlement than for\r\nprolonged discussion, intimated her willingness to leave all further\r\narrangements in the hands of her colleague. It was now past nine o’clock,\r\na furious dust-storm was raging and the night was bitterly cold, but\r\nTzŭ Hsi, who never wasted time at moments of crisis, ordered a strong\r\ndetachment of Household troops to be sent to the residence of Prince\r\nCh’un in the Western City, and with it the Imperial yellow sedan chair\r\nwith eight bearers, to bring the boy Emperor to the Palace. At the same\r\ntime, to keep Prince Kung busy and out of harm’s way, she gave him charge\r\nof the body of the dead Emperor, while she had the Palace surrounded and\r\nstrongly guarded by Jung Lu’s troops. It was in her careful attention to\r\ndetails of this kind that lay her marked superiority to the vacillating\r\nand unbusinesslike methods of those who opposed her, and it is this\r\nNapoleonic characteristic of the woman which explains much of the success\r\nthat her own people frequently attributed to luck. Before midnight the\r\nlittle Emperor had been duly installed in the Palace, weeping bitterly\r\nupon his ill-omened coming to the Forbidden City. With him came his\r\nmother (Tzŭ Hsi’s sister) and several nurses. The first event of his\r\nreign, imposed upon him, like much future misery, by dynastic precedent,\r\nwas to be taken at once to the Hall where his deceased predecessor\r\nwas lying in State, and there to kowtow, as well as his tender years\r\npermitted, before the departed ruler. A Decree was thereupon issued in\r\nthe names of the Empresses Dowager, who thus became once more Regents,\r\nannouncing, “that they were absolutely compelled to select Tsai Tien\r\nfor the Throne, and that he should become heir by adoption to his uncle\r\nHsien-Feng, but that, so soon as he should have begotten a son, the\r\nEmperor T’ung-Chih would at once be provided with an heir.”\r\n\r\nBy this means the widowed Empress A-lu-te was completely passed over,\r\nand the claims of her posthumous son ignored in advance. Once more Tzŭ\r\nHsi had gained an easy and complete victory. It was clear to those who\r\nleft the Council Chamber after the issue of this Decree, that neither the\r\nyoung widowed Empress nor the unborn child of T’ung-Chih were likely to\r\ngive much more trouble.\r\n\r\nFor form’s sake, and in accordance with dynastic precedents, a Memorial\r\nwas submitted by all the Ministers and Princes of the Household, begging\r\ntheir Majesties the Empresses to resume the Regency, who, on their part,\r\nwent through the farce of acceding graciously to this request, on the\r\ntime-honoured ground that during the Emperor’s minority there must be\r\nsome central authority to whom the officials of the Empire might look\r\nfor the necessary guidance. It was only fitting and proper, however,\r\nthat reluctance should be displayed, and Tzŭ Hsi’s reply to the Memorial\r\ntherefore observed that “the perusal of this Memorial has greatly\r\nincreased our grief and sorrowful recognition of the exigencies of the\r\ntimes, for we had hoped that the Regency was merely a temporary measure\r\nof unusual expediency. Be it known that so soon as the Emperor shall\r\nhave completed his education, we shall immediately hand over to him the\r\naffairs of the Government.”\r\n\r\nThe infant Emperor was understood to express “dutiful thanks to their\r\nMajesties for this virtuous act” and all the formalities of the tragic\r\ncomedy were thus completed. The Empress Dowager gave orders that the\r\nrepairs which had been begun at the Lake and Summer Palaces should now be\r\nstopped, the reason given being that the Empresses Regent would have no\r\ntime nor desire for gaiety in the years to come; the real reason being,\r\nhowever, that the death of the Emperor removed all necessity for their\r\nMajesties leaving the Forbidden City.\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi’s success in forcing her wishes upon the Grand Council and\r\nhaving her sister’s infant son appointed to the Imperial succession, in\r\nopposition to the wishes of a powerful party and in violation of the\r\ndynastic law, was entirely due to her energy and influence. The charm\r\nof her personality, and the convincing directness of her methods were\r\nmore effective than all the forces of tradition. This fact, and her\r\ntriumph, become the more remarkable when we bear in mind that she had\r\nbeen advised, and the Grand Council was aware, that the infant Emperor\r\nsuffered from physical weaknesses which, even at that date, rendered it\r\nextremely unlikely that he would ever provide an heir to the Throne.\r\nThose who criticised her selection, knowing this, would have been\r\ntherefore in a strong position had they not been lacking in courage\r\nand decision, since it was clear, if the fact were admitted, that Her\r\nMajesty’s only possible motive was personal ambition.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until the death of the Emperor and her own, on the 14th\r\nand 15th November 1908, the belief was widespread, and not infrequently\r\nexpressed, that the Emperor, whose reign began thus inauspiciously, would\r\nnot survive her, and there were many who predicted that his death would\r\noccur before the time came for him to assume supreme control of the\r\nGovernment. All foretold that Tzŭ Hsi would survive him, for the simple\r\nreason that only thus could she hope to regulate once more the succession\r\nand continue the Regency. The prophets of evil were wrong, as we know,\r\ninasmuch as Kuang-Hsü was allowed his years of grace in control of\r\naffairs, but we know also that after the _coup d’état_ it was only the\r\nfear of an insurrection in the south that saved his life and prevented\r\nthe accession of a new boy Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe designation of the new reign was then ordered to be “Kuang-Hsü,”\r\nmeaning “glorious succession”; it was chosen to emphasise the fact\r\nthat the new Emperor was a direct lineal descendant of the last great\r\nManchu Emperor, Tao-Kuang, and to suggest the hope that the evil days\r\nof Hsien-Feng and T’ung-Chih had come to an end. The next act of the\r\nEmpresses Regent was to confer an honorific title upon the late Emperor’s\r\nwidow; but the honour was not sufficient to prevent her from committing\r\nsuicide on the 27th of March as an act of protest at the grievous\r\nwrong done to her, to the memory of her husband and to the claims of\r\nhis posthumous heir. This was the unofficial explanation current, but\r\nopinions have always differed, and must continue to differ, as to the\r\ntruth of the suicide, there being many who, not unnaturally, accused\r\nTzŭ Hsi of putting an end to the unfortunate woman. Against this the\r\nEmpress’s advocates observe that, having succeeded in obtaining the\r\nappointment of Kuang-Hsü to the Throne, and the matter being irrevocably\r\nsettled, there existed no further necessity for any act of violence:\r\nbut few, if any, suggest that had circumstances necessitated violent\r\nmeasures they would not have been taken. The balance of evidence is\r\nundoubtedly in the direction of foul play. But, however administered,\r\nit is certain that the death of the Empress A-lu-te influenced public\r\nopinion more profoundly than she could ever have done by living; as a\r\nresult, thousands of Memorials poured in from the Censorate and the\r\nprovinces, strongly protesting against the selection of the infant son\r\nof Prince Ch’un for the Throne, as a violation of all ancestral custom\r\nand the time-honoured laws of succession. It is significant that all\r\nthese protests were clearly directed against Tzŭ Hsi, her colleague’s\r\nnonentity being practically and generally recognised. For a time Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s popularity (and therefore the position of the Yehonala clan) was\r\nseriously affected, and when, four years later, the Censor, Wu K’o-tu,\r\ncommitted suicide near T’ung-Chih’s grave to emphasise the seriousness of\r\nthe crime and to focus public attention on the matter, the Empress was\r\ncompelled to bow to the storm and to give a second and more solemn pledge\r\nthat the deceased Emperor should not permanently be left without heirs\r\nto perform for him the sacrifices of ancestral worship. It will be seen\r\nhereafter how she kept that pledge.\r\n\r\nPrince Ch’un, in the capacity of father to the new Emperor, submitted\r\na Memorial asking leave to be permitted to resign his various offices,\r\nbecause, as an official, he would be bound to kowtow to the Emperor,\r\nand as a father he could not kowtow to his own son. In the course of\r\nthis Memorial, which reminds the reader unpleasantly of Mr. Pecksniff,\r\nthe Prince observes that when first informed of his son’s selection as\r\nheir to the Dragon Throne, “he almost fainted and knew not what to do.\r\nWhen borne to his home, his body was trembling and his heart palpitating\r\nseverely; like a madman, or one who walks in dreams, was he, so that\r\nhe incurred a serious recurrence of his liver trouble and the state of\r\nhis health became really a matter for anxiety. He would prefer that\r\nthe silent tomb should close forthwith over his remains rather than to\r\ncontinue to draw the breath of life as the useless son of the Emperor\r\nTao-Kuang.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress Dowager, in reply, directed her faithful Ministers to devise\r\na careful compromise “based on the special requirements of the case,”\r\nthe result of which was that Prince Ch’un was permitted to resign his\r\noffices and excused from attendance at all Court ceremonies involving\r\nobeisance to the Emperor, but was retained in a sort of general capacity\r\nas “adviser to the Empresses Regent” to serve when called upon. On the\r\nbirthdays of the Empresses Regent, he would be permitted to prostrate\r\nhimself before them in private, and not as a member of the Court in\r\nattendance on the Emperor. His first class Princedom was made hereditary\r\nfor ever, and he was commanded to give the benefit of his experience\r\nand sage counsel to his successor, Prince Tun, as officer commanding\r\nthe Manchu Field Force—an order which he must have obeyed, for the\r\nForce in question became more and more notorious for its tatterdemalion\r\nuselessness and the corruption of its commanders.\r\n\r\nRemembering the institution of the first Regency, it will be noted how\r\nfaithfully history can be made to repeat itself in the Celestial Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE PROTEST AND SUICIDE OF WU K’O-TU\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after the death of T’ung-Chih’s young widow, the validity of\r\nthe Imperial succession and the violation of all traditions which Tzŭ\r\nHsi had committed, became a matter of grave concern to the conservative\r\nand more conscientious supporters of the Dynasty. The first evidence\r\nof dissatisfaction was contained in a Memorial submitted by a Manchu\r\nsub-Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat who, while accepting the\r\nsituation as it stood in regard to the boy Emperor, Kuang-Hsü, stipulated\r\nthat safeguards or guarantees should be given by the Throne for the\r\neventual regulation of the succession and for the provision of heirs to\r\nHis orbate Majesty, T’ung-Chih. The Memorial was as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The selection of an heir to the Throne is a matter resting\r\n    entirely with the Sovereign and beyond scope of interference or\r\n    criticism by any subject. But in cases where the arrangements\r\n    made necessitate modification in order to render them perfect,\r\n    a loyal subject is justified, if not compelled, to speak his\r\n    mind freely.\r\n\r\n    “The whole Empire looked forward to seeing our late Emperor\r\n    enjoy a long and prosperous reign, but he has passed away\r\n    without leaving any posterity. The selection of a successor\r\n    which your Majesties the Empresses Dowager have, in your\r\n    wisdom, decided upon is admirable no doubt, particularly since\r\n    you have promised that an heir shall eventually be provided for\r\n    His Majesty, T’ung-Chih. This proves that in regulating the\r\n    dynastic succession, you are proceeding precisely as if it\r\n    were a case of adoption from one family into another: you have\r\n    therefore wisely decided that not only shall a son be adopted\r\n    to the late Emperor, but that in due course his succession will\r\n    be carried on by a grandson in the direct line of generation,\r\n    so that His Majesty’s posterity may be established without a\r\n    break, and perpetuated without intermission for all time.\r\n\r\n    “The proposal in itself is excellent, but study of the Sung\r\n    Dynasty’s history has led me to view the matter with no small\r\n    apprehension. The founder of that Dynasty, the Emperor Chao\r\n    Kuang-yin (tenth century), following the directions of his\r\n    mother the Empress Dowager, made his brother heir to the Throne\r\n    instead of his son, it being understood that upon his brother’s\r\n    death the succession should revert to his son.[30] Subsequently\r\n    however, the brother, having come to the Throne, and having\r\n    listened to the evil suggestions of his Privy Councillors,\r\n    ignored the claims of his nephew, and placed his own son upon\r\n    the Throne. In that instance, obedience to the wishes of his\r\n    mother has brought down upon the Emperor Chao Kuang-yin the\r\n    undying censure of posterity. If the Empress, on that occasion,\r\n    had done her duty, and had caused unbreakable bonds to be given\r\n    assuring the reversion of the succession to the direct line,\r\n    no irregularities could possibly have occurred: the Decrees\r\n    would have been as immovable as the Sacred Mountain, and as\r\n    self-evident as the nine tripods of the Emperor Yü. It would\r\n    have been impossible for any misguided Councillors of State to\r\n    justify their unlawful interference with the rightful course of\r\n    succession.\r\n\r\n    “From all this we learn that the succession, although decided\r\n    in a moment, affects all posterity. Was it not, moreover,\r\n    by self-sacrifice and strong family affections[31] that\r\n    our Dynasty acquired the Empire: have we not for example\r\n    the records of each succeeding virtuous Emperor? We cannot\r\n    therefore entertain any doubt but that the present Emperor,\r\n    when he comes to have an heir, will forthwith make him son\r\n    by adoption to the late Emperor, so that the succession may\r\n    proceed along the direct line. No doubt this is the intention,\r\n    but, as history shows, there exists a danger that, with the\r\n    lapse of time, suggestions may be put forward similar to\r\n    those of the Privy Council nine centuries ago, which would\r\n    utterly frustrate the wise policy animating your Majesties the\r\n    Empresses Dowager, and leave no fixed principles for posterity\r\n    to follow. With your approval, therefore, we would ask that the\r\n    Princes and Ministers be now required to draw up and record an\r\n    unbreakable and unchangeable pledge as to the succession to the\r\n    Throne, which should be proclaimed for the information of all\r\n    your Majesties’ subjects.”\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi was becoming decidedly irritable on this subject of the\r\nsuccession, and there can be little doubt that her own conscience and the\r\nviews of patriotic Memorialists came to much the same conclusion. The\r\nRescript which she issued on the present occasion was short, sharp, and\r\nsuggestive of temper:—\r\n\r\n    “We have already issued an absolutely clear Decree on this\r\n    subject,” she said, “providing for an heir to the late Emperor,\r\n    and the Decree has been published all over the Empire. The\r\n    Memorialist’s present request gives evidence of unspeakable\r\n    audacity and an inveterate habit of fault-finding, which has\r\n    greatly enraged us, so that we hereby convey to him a stern\r\n    rebuke.”\r\n\r\nThe Memorials and remonstrances of many high officials emphasised the\r\nseriousness of this question of the legitimacy of the Imperial succession\r\nto the nation at large, and its profound effect on the fundamental\r\nprinciples of ancestor worship. Nevertheless, having delivered their\r\nsouls, the Mandarinate, led by the Peking Boards, were disposed to\r\nacquiesce in the _fait accompli_; in any case, there was no sign of\r\norganised opinion in opposition to the will of the Empress Dowager. The\r\nirregularity was evidently serious, and Heaven would doubtless visit\r\nthe sins of the Throne, as usual, on the unoffending “stupid people”;\r\nbut the individualism and mutual suspicion that peculiarly distinguish\r\nthe Chinese official world, precluded all idea of concerted action or\r\nremedial measures.\r\n\r\nOne official, however, had the full courage of his convictions, and, by\r\nthe time-honoured expedient of self-destruction, focussed the attention\r\nof the nation on the gravity of the question, as no amount of fine\r\nwriting could have done. Resort to suicide by indignant patriots, as a\r\nproof of their sincere distress, is a practice praised and justified\r\nalike by historians in China and Japan, and there is no denying that, as\r\nan argument against all forms of despotism, it has the crowning merit of\r\nfinality. It has, moreover, certain qualities of deliberate courage and\r\ncultured philosophy that bring irresistibly to mind the Roman patrician\r\nat his best, and which fully account for the distinction which such a\r\ndeath confers amongst a people that loves its orthodoxies, as it loves\r\npeace, undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe name which will go down in Chinese history, as the defender of the\r\nnational and true faith in connection with the illegal succession of the\r\ninfant Emperor Kuang-Hsü, is that of the Censor, Wu K’o-tu, an upright\r\nand fearless scholar of the best type. For the reasons stated in his\r\nfarewell Memorial, he waited four years after the death of the Emperor\r\nT’ung-Chih, hoping against hope that the widespread dissatisfaction\r\nof the _literati_ and officials would take definite form, and lead\r\nthe Empress Dowager to regulate the future succession, and to placate\r\nthe disinherited ghost of T’ung-Chih, by the issue of a new Decree.\r\nDisappointed in this hope, he seized the classically correct occasion\r\nof the late Emperor’s funeral (1879) to commit suicide near his grave,\r\ntaking care to leave behind him a swan-song which, as he knew, will live\r\nlong in the memory of scholars and officials throughout the Empire. His\r\ndeath had the immediate effect of convincing Tzŭ Hsi of error. Realising\r\nthe strength of public opinion underlying the Censor’s protest, she\r\nendeavoured at once to placate his accusing spirit by giving the pledges\r\nfor which he had pleaded, in regard to provision in the future of a\r\nsuccessor to T’ung-Chih. Nor was it on this occasion only that the death\r\nof Wu K’o-tu influenced her actions and disturbed her superstitious mind.\r\nIn after years, and especially at the time of the flight to Hsi-an, she\r\nrecognised his influence, and the punishment of her misdeed, in the\r\ndisasters which had overtaken the Throne.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the principles of action, and the calm frame of mind\r\nwhich are the fine flower of the Confucian system of philosophy, and,\r\ntherefore, worthy of our close and sympathetic study, we give the full\r\nstory of the death of this patriotic protestant, as well as a translation\r\nof his Memorial.\r\n\r\nHis suicide took place in a small temple at Ma-shen ch’iao, close to\r\nthe mausoleum of T’ung-Chih. His minutely detailed instructions for\r\nthe disposal of his remains, with the least possible trouble to his\r\nfamily and friends, bespeak the gentleman and the scholar. To the\r\npriest in charge of the shrine, a “bad man,” he addressed the following\r\ncharacteristic letter:—\r\n\r\n    “Priest Chou, be not afraid. I have no desire to bring evil\r\n    upon you. I was compelled to borrow the use of your plot of\r\n    hallowed ground, as a spot appropriate for the death of an\r\n    honest man. Inform now the Magistrate at once, and see that\r\n    the Memorial enclosed in my despatch box is forwarded without\r\n    delay. Buy for me a cheap coffin and have it painted black\r\n    inside. My clothes are all in order, only the leather soles\r\n    of my boots require to be cut off before you lay me in your\r\n    coffin. I have cut my finger slightly, which accounts for the\r\n    blood stains that you may notice. Twenty taels will be ample\r\n    for my coffin. I should not think that the Magistrate will need\r\n    to hold an inquest. Please have a coating of lacquer put on\r\n    the coffin, to fill up any cracks in the joints, and have it\r\n    nailed down, pending the Empresses’ decision as to my remains.\r\n    Then, buy a few feet of ground adjoining the late Emperor’s\r\n    tomb, and have me buried quickly.[32] There is no need for\r\n    me to be buried in my ancestral cemetery; any spot is a good\r\n    enough resting place for a loyal and honest man.\r\n\r\n    “You will find forty-five taels in my box, of which you\r\n    may keep the balance after paying for my coffin and burial\r\n    expenses. As to my watch, and the other articles on my person,\r\n    it is known at my home exactly what I brought here with me. You\r\n    must see to it that no one is permitted to insult my corpse,\r\n    and my son will be deeply grateful to you for performing these\r\n    last offices for me, in his place. You need not fear that the\r\n    Magistrate’s underlings will make trouble for you, but be\r\n    careful not to tamper with the box containing my Memorial to\r\n    the Empresses.\r\n\r\n    “You can cut my body down to-morrow morning, and then have it\r\n    placed in some cool and shady spot. Fearing that possibly you\r\n    might come in by accident and find me hanging, I have taken a\r\n    dose of opium, so as to make certain of death. If you should\r\n    dare to meddle with my private affairs, as you have been trying\r\n    to do these past few days, it will only lead to your being\r\n    mixed up in the case, which might bring you to grief.\r\n\r\n    “All I ask of you is that you notify the Magistrate at\r\n    once, and that you do not allow women and children to come\r\n    in and gaze upon my remains. There is nothing strange or\r\n    abnormal here; death had become an unavoidable duty. Those\r\n    who understand me, will pity; that is all. The last earnest\r\n    instructions of Wu K’o-tu.”\r\n\r\nNext, to his son, he expressed his dying wishes in a letter which\r\nembodies many of the Confucian scholar’s most cherished ideals and\r\nbeliefs, a document pathetic in its simple dignity, its pride of ancient\r\nlineage and duty well done according to his lights.\r\n\r\n    “Chih-huan, my son, be not alarmed when you hear the news of\r\n    my death, and on no account allow your grief to disturb the\r\n    family. Your mother is old, your wife is young, and my poor\r\n    little grandchildren are but babies. Tell them that I am dead,\r\n    but bid them not to grieve over my suicide. Our family tree\r\n    goes back over five hundred years; for two centuries there have\r\n    been members of our clan among the Imperial concubines, and\r\n    for three hundred years we have devoted ourselves to husbandry\r\n    and scholarship. For eighteen generations our family has borne\r\n    a good name; I, who am now seventy years of age, can claim an\r\n    unsullied record, although as a lad I was somewhat given to\r\n    dissipation. No man can truthfully accuse me of having failed\r\n    to observe the main principles of duty, and it is for this\r\n    reason that my friends and former pupils have always sought my\r\n    services as a teacher of the Confucian doctrine. Quite recently\r\n    I declined the pressing invitation of the Grand Secretary, the\r\n    Marquis Tso Tsung-t’ang, who wished me to become tutor to his\r\n    family, because the date was at hand for His late Majesty’s\r\n    burial, and I desired quietly to await to-day’s event.\r\n\r\n    “Ever since, at the age of twenty-four, I took my M.A.\r\n    degree, I have been of prudent conduct, and have observed the\r\n    proprieties in official life. In the study of history I have\r\n    ever been deeply touched by examples of patriotism and loyalty\r\n    to the Sovereign, and the splendid lives of the ancients have\r\n    moved me, now to tears and again to exuberance of joy.\r\n\r\n    “Upon the death of the late Emperor, I had determined to\r\n    memorialise the Empresses Dowager, through the Censorate, and\r\n    had fully made up my mind to accept my fate for so doing; but\r\n    an old friend, to whom I showed the draft, begged me not to\r\n    forward it, not only because I had already been punished for\r\n    similar rashness on a former occasion, but because he said\r\n    some of its allusions to current events were not absolutely\r\n    accurate. Therefore I waited until to-day, but now I can wait\r\n    no longer. It is my wish to die, in order that the purpose of\r\n    my life may be fittingly accomplished and a lifetime of loyalty\r\n    consummated. My death is in no way due to the slanders which\r\n    have been circulated about me.\r\n\r\n    “When you receive this letter, come straightway to the Temple\r\n    of the Threefold Duties at the bridge of the God of Horses,\r\n    twelve miles to the east of Chi Chou and quite close to the\r\n    Imperial mausolea. There seek out the Taoist priest, Chou;\r\n    he knows my burial place, and I have asked him to buy me a\r\n    coffin and to have it painted black inside. My burial clothes\r\n    are all in order, but I have asked him to cut off the leather\r\n    soles from my boots.[33] He is to buy a certain small piece of\r\n    ground, close to the Imperial tomb, which is to be my grave.\r\n    This will be far better than having my remains taken to the\r\n    ancestral burial ground, and there is really no need for me\r\n    to rest there, as my younger brother already lies beside your\r\n    grandparents. He, you remember, committed suicide twenty years\r\n    ago at his house in Peking, because of private troubles, and\r\n    now I follow his example, because of disorder in the State.\r\n    People will say, no doubt, that our family burial ground is\r\n    become a place of evil omen, but pay no heed to them. No doubt\r\n    you will desire to take home my remains, but do not so. Take\r\n    instead my photograph, the one I had taken just before I left\r\n    Peking, and have an enlargement of it hung up in our family\r\n    hall. Thus shall you observe the old custom which preserves\r\n    relics of the departed. Why go to the expense and trouble of\r\n    transporting a coffin over a thousand miles?\r\n\r\n    “Even though it should happen that the Empresses should\r\n    cause dire penalties to be inflicted upon my corpse because\r\n    of my effrontery of language, you may be sure that in this\r\n    enlightened age, there is no possibility of my offences being\r\n    visited upon my wife and family. All you need do is to borrow\r\n    from our friends money enough to take you from Peking, and\r\n    after that, you must make the best of your way to our family\r\n    home, begging if necessary. On no account must you remain in\r\n    Peking, for by so doing you will only attract attention and\r\n    further endanger your father.[34]\r\n\r\n    “What I chiefly deprecate in you, my son, is your quick tongue;\r\n    you must really try to amend your ways in this respect and\r\n    endeavour to be less hasty. If people tell you that your\r\n    father was loyal, do not contradict them; if they say he was\r\n    an honest man, you should agree. Read carefully the advice\r\n    of Ma Yüan, the great General, to his nephew, and Wang Hou’s\r\n    admonitions to his sons.\r\n\r\n    “When your mother married me she had good prospects, as the\r\n    daughter of an old military family. Since her marriage she has\r\n    dutifully served my parents, and her reputation for filial\r\n    devotion is excellent. I regret that I was not destined to\r\n    bring her happiness and good fortune: she is old now, and you\r\n    alone are left to her. It is your duty to take her to our home\r\n    and minister to her old age.\r\n\r\n    “As regards the few poor acres of land left me by my father,\r\n    I feel that I cannot reasonably expect you to follow the\r\n    example of the ancient worthies and to surrender it all to your\r\n    brothers, but at least I ask that you should allow them to live\r\n    amicably with you. Your wife is a sensible woman—tell her from\r\n    me that the happiness of every household depends on the temper\r\n    of its womenfolk. I knew one woman who feigned death in order\r\n    to induce her husband to treat his brothers more kindly, but\r\n    this was a heroic act, far above the moral capacity of your\r\n    wife.\r\n\r\n    “As to the forty taels[35] which you will find on my person,\r\n    you will hand over to the Taoist priest, Chou, any balance\r\n    there may remain after he has paid for my coffin and burial\r\n    expenses. On arriving at Chi Chou, go at once and see the\r\n    Magistrate, to whom I have written; thence proceed to the\r\n    temple, where you must give them some extra money to compensate\r\n    them for all the trouble they have had. Thereafter return to\r\n    Peking, and there await the Empresses’ decision in regard to my\r\n    case.\r\n\r\n    “See to it that my small debts are all paid, that my life may\r\n    end in fitting and harmonious dignity. At a moment like this, I\r\n    am naturally agitated in mind. It is hard to foretell what the\r\n    decision of the Empresses may be, but at least my conscience\r\n    is clear, and what does anything else matter? For your own\r\n    personal safety, I do not think you need have any fear.\r\n\r\n    “Present my compliments to Chang Chih-tung: I only wish I\r\n    could have had more of the old time talks with him. Go also\r\n    to the Marquis Tso Tsung-t’ang. He has not treated me well of\r\n    late, but slanders poisoned his sympathy, at which I do not\r\n    wonder. The memory of his former kindnesses is precious to me,\r\n    and I know that he will never let you starve.\r\n\r\n    “Your wife, in giving birth to my grandchildren, has conferred\r\n    blessings upon me; you must never think of allowing her parents\r\n    to provide for you. Leave therefore at once for our family\r\n    home. There must be no delay about this. As to the Taoist\r\n    priest, it irks me to make use of people in this way. He is\r\n    a bad man; yet must we bear with him. Tell him that I regret\r\n    having put his temple to this purpose; he need only spend ten\r\n    taels on my coffin and a few taels more for the little plot of\r\n    ground to bury me in. I am a worthless official and deserve\r\n    nothing better than this.\r\n\r\n    “Why have I delayed so long? Because I did not wish to disturb\r\n    the Empresses with the news of my death at this critical time.\r\n    All the Decrees which have appeared since the Emperor Kuang-Hsü\r\n    came to the Throne have moved me greatly, and much have I\r\n    deplored my inability to serve Their Majesties better. In days\r\n    of old, loyal servants of the State were wont to commit suicide\r\n    as an act of remonstrance against the degeneracy of their\r\n    Sovereigns. Not for a moment are the Empresses to be compared\r\n    to monarchs like Ming Huang of the T’ang Dynasty, who deserted\r\n    his capital before the invader, or Li Tsung, of the Sungs,\r\n    whose foolishness led to the Mongol wars. Nevertheless my death\r\n    is due to the same principles as those which actuated those\r\n    faithful Councillors.\r\n\r\n    “Go home now, and teach your children to study. Do not open my\r\n    Memorial to the Empresses. It is sealed, and I have asked the\r\n    local Magistrate to forward it for presentation.”\r\n\r\nHis Memorial to the Throne was, in fact (as the letter to his son plainly\r\nindicates), an indictment of the degeneracy of the ruler of the Empire;\r\nincidentally, it throws much light on the orthodox point of view in\r\nregard to the question of the Imperial succession. Its preamble sets\r\nforth the object with which it was written, and in the hope of which\r\nthe writer died, namely, to induce the Empress Dowager to determine\r\nthe future succession, providing an heir to the Emperor T’ung-Chih, in\r\naccordance with precedent and the laws of the Dynasty. The text of this\r\nremarkable document is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “I, your worthless servant, have heard that the fact of a\r\n    nation being well governed does not necessarily preclude all\r\n    possibility of anarchy, nor does a nation at peace dismiss\r\n    altogether from mind the chances of violent disturbance; should\r\n    anarchy and rebellion be regarded as possibilities too remote\r\n    to merit a thought, it were idle and superfluous to advise the\r\n    Sovereign of so perfect a State. To ask the Imperial wisdom to\r\n    see danger where no real peril exists would be simply inviting\r\n    evil omens.\r\n\r\n    “On a former occasion I, your guilty servant, wittingly\r\n    incurred danger of death or imprisonment, because, in the heat\r\n    of indignation, I dared to remonstrate with the Throne. At\r\n    that time the Princes and Ministers about your Throne asked\r\n    permission to subject me to a criminal enquiry, but His late\r\n    Majesty T’ung-Chih was pleased to spare me, so that I neither\r\n    suffered death by the headsman’s sword nor imprisonment, nor\r\n    did I run the risk of further exciting the Imperial wrath by\r\n    my evidence before a criminal court. Thrice have I deserved,\r\n    without receiving, the penalty of death. Without desiring my\r\n    forfeit life, it was granted me, so that my last few years have\r\n    been, as it were, a boon at the hands of His late Majesty.\r\n\r\n    “But on the 5th day of the 12th Moon of the 13th year of\r\n    T’ung-Chih the earth was rent and heaven itself was shaken by\r\n    the great catastrophe, and on that day their Majesties the\r\n    Empresses Dowager issued the following Decree: ‘The departed\r\n    Emperor has mounted the Dragon and is become a guest on high,\r\n    leaving no heir to the Throne. We are compelled to appoint\r\n    Tsai T’ien, son of Prince Ch’un, to be heir to His Majesty\r\n    Hsien-Feng, to enter on the great inheritance as the new\r\n    Emperor. When to him an heir shall be born, he shall become son\r\n    by adoption to the late Emperor T’ung-Chih.’\r\n\r\n    “I, your unworthy servant, wept bitterly as, reverently\r\n    kneeling, I read this Decree. I cannot but feel, after most\r\n    careful consideration, that the Empresses Dowager have doubly\r\n    erred in appointing an heir to the Emperor Hsien-Feng and not\r\n    to His late Majesty. For thus the new Emperor, being heir to\r\n    His Majesty Hsien-Feng, enters upon the great heritage not, as\r\n    he should, by mandate of His late Majesty T’ung-Chih, but by\r\n    mandate of the Empresses. Hence the future succession must, as\r\n    a matter of course, revert to the heir of the new Emperor, even\r\n    though there should be no explicit instructions to that effect.\r\n    But, as this Decree expressly ordains that this shall be so, it\r\n    follows that a precedent will be established, whereby the great\r\n    inheritance may pass by adoption.\r\n\r\n    “I, your unworthy servant, realise that it is no light matter\r\n    for a loyal subject to refer to the future death of a Sovereign\r\n    while that Sovereign is still alive, entitled to all his\r\n    reverence and devotion. But, for more than two centuries, the\r\n    ancestral tradition of our House-law has been observed that\r\n    the Throne shall pass from father to son, and this law should\r\n    be steadfastly maintained for ten thousand generations amongst\r\n    those of us who recognise a common descent. Moreover, Prince\r\n    Ch’un is a loyal statesman, justly revered by all as a virtuous\r\n    Prince. His Memorial has inspired every one of us with fresh\r\n    feelings of enthusiastic loyalty. His words are but the mirror\r\n    of his mind; how could any falseness find therein a place? When\r\n    I perused his Memorial, tears of joy irrepressible fell from\r\n    my eyes. If ever the Prince should learn of this my humble\r\n    Memorial, he may perchance be wroth at my perversity or pity my\r\n    folly; at all events he will never blame me for endeavouring to\r\n    stir up vain strife by my words.\r\n\r\n    “The new Emperor is of gentle disposition; from the Empress\r\n    Dowager he had received the ‘precious inheritance’ and\r\n    until his dying day he will naturally be of one mind with\r\n    the Empresses in this matter. But in the Palace there are\r\n    sycophants as well as honest men, and many conflicting\r\n    opinions. To take examples from history: at the beginning\r\n    of the Sung Dynasty, even that great and good man the Grand\r\n    Secretary Chao P’u, led the way in obeying the orders of the\r\n    Empress Dowager Tu. Again, under the Ming Dynasty, a venerable\r\n    servant of the State, the Grand Secretary Wang Chih, was\r\n    ashamed that it should be left to a barbarian like Huang Kung\r\n    (native of an aboriginal tribe in Kuangsi) to memorialise\r\n    urging the lawful Heir Apparent’s succession to the Emperor\r\n    Ching-T’ai, when no Chinese official dared to do so. If even\r\n    virtuous men could act thus, what need to enquire about\r\n    disloyal subjects? If such be the conduct of old servants, how\r\n    shall we blame upstarts? To set aside settled ordinances may\r\n    be bad, but how much worse is our case where no ordinances\r\n    exist? We should therefore seek if perchance we may find some\r\n    way out of this double error, whereby we may return to the\r\n    right way. I therefore beg that the Empresses may be pleased\r\n    to issue a second Decree explicitly stating that the great\r\n    inheritance shall hereafter revert to the adopted son of\r\n    His late Majesty T’ung-Chih, and that no Minister shall be\r\n    allowed to upset this Decree, even though the new Emperor be\r\n    blessed with a hundred sons. If, in this way, the succession\r\n    be rectified and the situation defined, so that further\r\n    confusion be hereafter impossible, the House-law of the present\r\n    Dynasty will be observed, which requires that the Throne be\r\n    handed down from father to son. Thus, to the late Emperor, now\r\n    childless, an heir will be provided and the Empresses Dowager\r\n    will no longer be without a grandson. And, for all time, the\r\n    orderly maintenance of the succession will be ascribed to the\r\n    Empresses, whose fame will be changeless and unending. This is\r\n    what I, your guilty servant, mean, when I say that the double\r\n    error which has been committed may yet serve to bring us back\r\n    to the right way.\r\n\r\n    “I, your most unworthy slave, had intended to memorialise on\r\n    this matter when His Majesty died, and to present the Memorial\r\n    through the Censorate. But it occurred to me that, since I\r\n    had lost my post, I was debarred from addressing the Throne.\r\n    Besides, how grave a matter is this! If advice in such a\r\n    matter be given by a Prince or a Minister, it is called the\r\n    sage and far-reaching counsel of a statesman; but if it comes\r\n    from a small and insignificant official it is called the idle\r\n    utterance of a wanton babbler. Never could I have believed\r\n    that the many wise and loyal statesmen of your Court could\r\n    one and all regard this as a matter of no immediate urgency,\r\n    dismissing it as a question unprofitable for discussion. I\r\n    waited, therefore, and the precious moments passed, but none of\r\n    them have moved in the matter.\r\n\r\n    “Afterwards, having received renewed marks of the Imperial\r\n    favour, and being again summoned to audience, I was granted\r\n    the position of a Board Secretary, and placed on the Board of\r\n    Appointments. This was more than four years ago; yet all this\r\n    time apparently not one of all the Ministers of your Court has\r\n    even given this grave matter a moment’s consideration. The day\r\n    for His late Majesty’s entombment has now arrived, and I fear\r\n    that what has happened will gradually pass from the minds of\r\n    men. The time, therefore, is short, and the reasons which led\r\n    me to delay hold good no longer. Looking upward, as the divine\r\n    soul of His Majesty soars heavenward on the Dragon, wistfully\r\n    I turn my eyes upon the Palace enclosure. Beholding the bows\r\n    and arrows left behind on the Bridge Mountain,[36] my thoughts\r\n    turn to the cherished mementoes of my Sovereign. Humbly I offer\r\n    up these years of life that have been added unto me by His\r\n    Majesty’s clemency; humbly I lay them down in propitiation of\r\n    the Empresses Dowager, to implore from them a brief Decree on\r\n    behalf of the late Emperor.\r\n\r\n    “But, on the point of leaving this world, I feel that my mind\r\n    is confused. The text of this, my Memorial, lacks clearness;\r\n    there are manifold omissions in it. It has ever been my custom\r\n    to revise a draft twice before handing in a Memorial, but\r\n    on this occasion I have not been able to make such careful\r\n    revision. I, your unworthy servant, am no scholar like to the\r\n    men of old; how, then, could I be calm and collected as they\r\n    were wont to be? Once there went a man to his death, and he\r\n    could not walk erect. A bystander said to him ‘Are you afraid,\r\n    sir?’ He replied, ‘I am.’ ‘If you are afraid, why not turn\r\n    back?’ He replied, ‘My fear is a private weakness; my death is\r\n    a public duty.’ This is the condition in which I find myself\r\n    to-day. ‘When a bird is dying its song is sad. When a man is\r\n    dying his words are good.’[37] How could I, your worthless\r\n    servant, dare to compare myself with the sage Tseng Tzu?\r\n    Though I am about to die, yet may my words not be good; but I\r\n    trust that the Empresses and the Emperor will pity my last sad\r\n    utterance, regarding it neither as an evil omen nor the idle\r\n    plaint of one who has no real cause for grief. Thus shall I die\r\n    without regret. A statesman of the Sung Dynasty has remarked:\r\n    ‘To discuss an event before it occurs is foolhardy. But if one\r\n    waits until it has occurred, speech is then too late, and,\r\n    therefore, superfluous.’ Foolhardiness notwithstanding, it is\r\n    well that the Throne should be warned before events occur;\r\n    no Minister should ever have to reproach himself with having\r\n    spoken too late. Heartily do I wish that my words may prove\r\n    untrue, so that posterity may laugh at my folly. I do not\r\n    desire that my words may be verified, for posterity to acclaim\r\n    my wisdom. May it be my fate to resemble Tu Mu,[38] even though\r\n    to imitate him be a transgression of duty. May I be likened,\r\n    rather, to Shih Ch’iu, the sight of whose dead body proved, as\r\n    he had hoped, an effective rebuke to his erring Prince. Thus\r\n    may my foolish but loyal words be justified in the end.\r\n\r\n    “I pray the Empresses and Emperor to remember the example of\r\n    Their Majesties Shun-Chih and K’ang-Hsi, in tempering justice\r\n    with mercy: that they may promote peace and prosperity, by\r\n    appointing only worthy men to public offices; that they may\r\n    refrain from striving for those objects which foreigners hold\r\n    dear, for by such striving they will surely jeopardise the\r\n    future of our Middle Kingdom; that they may never initiate any\r\n    of the innovations disdained by their ancestors, which would\r\n    assuredly leave to posterity a heritage of woe. These are my\r\n    last words, my last prayer, the end and crown of my life.\r\n\r\n    POSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n    “Having been a Censor, I venture thus to memorialise the\r\n    Throne. But as my present official position does not permit\r\n    of my forwarding this direct, I request the high officials\r\n    of my Board to present it for me. As my name did not figure\r\n    originally in the list of officials to represent my Board at\r\n    the ceremonies preparatory to His late Majesty’s burial, I\r\n    begged the Grand Secretary Pao Yün to allow me to be included\r\n    in the list. Pao Yün could not have foretold my suicide, so\r\n    that no blame can attach to him for being my sponsor. Under our\r\n    enlightened Dynasty, how could anyone imagine a return to the\r\n    ancient and happily obsolete practice of being buried alive\r\n    with one’s Sovereign? But my grief is too great and cannot be\r\n    restrained; for to-day my Sovereign returns, dragon-borne, to\r\n    Heaven, and all the world weeps with me in woe unutterable.\r\n\r\n    “I have respectfully but fully explained my feelings in this\r\n    question of the lawful succession to the Throne, and now, under\r\n    the title of your guilty servant, I present this my Memorial.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTZŬ HSI BECOMES SOLE REGENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days of mourning for T’ung-Chih being done, his remains disposed of\r\nas auspiciously as the Court of Astronomers could desire, and his ghost\r\nplacated, thanks to Wu K’o-tu, by solemn promises on the part of his\r\nmother to provide him with a suitable and legitimate heir in due season,\r\nlife in the Forbidden City settled down once more into the old grooves\r\nunder the joint Regency of the Empresses of the Eastern and Western\r\nPalaces.\r\n\r\nBut before long the new Emperor, a nervous and delicate boy, became,\r\nall unconsciously, a thorn in the side of the woman who put him on the\r\nThrone. As he passed from infancy to boyhood, it was a matter of common\r\nknowledge and report in the Palace that he showed a marked preference for\r\nthe Empress Tzŭ An, who, by her kind and sympathetic treatment, had won\r\nthe child’s heart. In the innocence of his lonely youth he frequented\r\ntherefore the Eastern Palace, while Tzŭ Hsi, whose pride could brook no\r\nrivals, even in the heart of a child, was compelled to look on, and to\r\nrealise that the forming of the future ruler’s mind was in the hands\r\nof another woman. There were not lacking those who told her that her\r\ncolleague, secretly and with ulterior motives, encouraged the boy to\r\noppose and displease her. Under these conditions, it was inevitable that\r\nthe young Emperor should gradually become a cause of increasing jealousy\r\nand friction between the two women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE I KUN KUNG.\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi lived in these Apartments for some time after the death of\r\nT’ung-Chih.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Ogawa, Tokio._]\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi undoubtedly resented the boy’s predilection as much as her\r\ncolleague’s action in encouraging it. At Court, where everyone and\r\neverything is a potential instrument for intrigue and party faction, the\r\nyoung Emperor’s attitude could not fail to cause her grave concern. She\r\nwas well aware that Tzŭ An could never become, of herself, a formidable\r\nrival, but should she hereafter enjoy the Emperor’s confidence and\r\nsupport, and instigate him to become the centre of a faction against\r\nher (which he did), there might be danger in the situation for herself.\r\nAs the Emperor’s minority approached its end, it therefore became the\r\nmore necessary for her to take all possible precautions. She had no\r\nintention of sharing the fate of that Empress Consort of Ch’ien Lung\r\nwho was banished to the “Cold Palace” and whose honours and titles were\r\ntaken from her on charges of “wild extravagance, love of the theatre and\r\ninsubordination to the Emperor’s mother.”\r\n\r\nA further cause of friction occurred between the two Empresses Regent on\r\nthe occasion of the Imperial progress to the Eastern tombs, in 1880, when\r\nthe boy Emperor was nine years old. On this occasion, Tzŭ An, evidently\r\nprompted by Prince Kung to assert herself and her rights, insisted on\r\ntaking precedence in all the ceremonies of the ancestral sacrifices\r\nat the Imperial Mausolea and at the prostrations which custom decrees\r\nshall be made before each of the “Jewelled Cities,” as the mounds are\r\ncalled which cover the Imperial grave chambers. When their Majesties\r\narrived at the grave of Hsien-Feng, there was serious friction. Tzŭ An,\r\nas the senior Consort of the deceased monarch, claimed as her right the\r\ncentral position, at the same time relegating her colleague to the place\r\non her right, leaving the place of honour on the left unoccupied. Not\r\ncontent with this, Tzŭ An went on to remind her Co-Regent that, where\r\nsacrifices to Hsien-Feng were in question, Tzŭ Hsi was entitled only to\r\nclaim precedence as a senior concubine, her elevation to the position\r\nof Empress Mother having taken place after his decease. As a concubine,\r\netiquette required her, during the sacrifice, to take a position on one\r\nside and slightly in the rear, while the vacant place of honour to Tzŭ\r\nAn’s left belonged to the shade of Hsien-Feng’s first consort, who had\r\ndied before his accession, but had been posthumously raised to the rank\r\nof senior Empress. Tzŭ Hsi, realising that this indignity was put upon\r\nher at the instigation of Prince Kung and the Princes of the Imperial\r\nfamily, had no intention of submitting, and peremptorily insisted upon\r\ntaking the position to which her actual rank and authority entitled her.\r\nThe quarrel was sharp but short. Tzŭ Hsi, as might have been expected,\r\ncarried the day, but she felt that such a scene before the ancestral\r\ntombs, witnessed by a large entourage, was semi-sacrilegious and from\r\nevery point of view unseemly. She had been made to lose face by the\r\nincident—clearly premeditated—and the fact had immediate effect upon her\r\nsubsequent actions and her relations with her colleague.[39]\r\n\r\nAt the time of this progress to the tombs, Jung Lu was in command of the\r\nMetropolitan Gendarmerie, entrusted with the duty of escorting their\r\nMajesties. Shortly after their return to Peking, however, he incurred her\r\nsharp displeasure by reason of conduct which Tzŭ Hsi was not likely to\r\noverlook, even in her chief favourite. Ever since the Jehol days of the\r\nTsai Yüan conspiracy, and particularly during the crisis that followed\r\nthe death of T’ung-Chih, this powerful Manchu had enjoyed her favour and\r\nconfidence in an unusual degree, and as Comptroller of her Household,\r\nhe had the right of _entrée_ to the Forbidden City at all times. But\r\nin 1880, suffering no doubt from _ennui_ induced by the inactivity of\r\nCourt life, he committed the indiscretion of an intrigue with one of the\r\nladies of the late Emperor’s seraglio. Information of the scandal was\r\nlaid before Her Majesty by the Imperial tutor Weng T’ung-ho, between\r\nwhom and Jung Lu there was never love lost. It was commonly rumoured at\r\nCourt, after the event, that Tzŭ Hsi, leaving nothing to chance, had\r\nherself discovered the culprit in the women’s quarters of the Palace,\r\na heinous offence. Be this as it may, Jung Lu was summarily, though\r\nquietly, deprived of all his posts, and for the next seven years he lived\r\nin retirement. In this case Tzŭ Hsi vindicated her pride at the expense\r\nof her own comfort and sense of security, and it was not long before she\r\nhad reason to regret the absence of her most loyal and trusty adviser.\r\nAmongst her courtiers she found none to replace him; she missed his wise\r\ncounsel, courage and fidelity. But having once committed herself to the\r\nstep of dismissing him, she was unwilling to lose face with him and with\r\nher Court by changing her mind. His removal, however, undoubtedly led\r\nto increased friction between herself and Tzŭ An, whom she suspected of\r\nbeing a party to Jung Lu’s _liaison_.\r\n\r\nFinally, in March 1881, a serious quarrel took place between the two\r\nEmpresses, on the subject of the influence which the Chief Eunuch Li\r\nLien-ying had come to exercise, and the arrogance of his manner. Tzŭ An\r\ncomplained that this favourite and confidential servant of her colleague\r\nignored her, setting her authority at nought, so that she was mocked even\r\nby her own subordinates. She deplored and denounced the existing state of\r\naffairs, commenting unpleasantly on the notorious fact that the eunuch\r\nwas openly known by the title of “Lord of nine thousand years,” a title\r\nwhich implied that he was but one degree lower than the Emperor (Lord of\r\nten thousand years) and entitled to something approximating to Imperial\r\nhonours.[40]\r\n\r\nThe quarrel on this occasion was exceedingly bitter, nor was any\r\nreconciliation subsequently effected between the Empresses. It is very\r\ngenerally believed, and was freely stated at the time that, incensed\r\nbeyond measure and impatient of any further interference with her\r\nauthority, Tzŭ Hsi brought about the death of her colleague, which\r\nwas commonly attributed to poison. In the atmosphere of an Oriental\r\nCourt such charges are as inevitable as they are incapable of proof or\r\ndisproof, and were it not for the unfortunate fact that those who stood\r\nin the way of Tzŭ Hsi’s ambitions, or who incurred her displeasure,\r\nfrequently failed to survive it, we should be justified in refusing to\r\nattach importance to the imputations of foul play raised on this and\r\nother occasions. But these occasions are too numerous to be entirely\r\noverlooked or regarded as simple coincidences. In the present instance,\r\nthe Empress Tzŭ An fell ill of a sudden and mysterious sickness, and\r\nin the words of the Imperial Decree, she “ascended the fairy chariot\r\nfor her distant journey” on the evening of the 10th day of the 3rd\r\nMoon. In accordance with prescribed custom, she drafted just before\r\nher decease a valedictory Decree which, as will be observed, touches\r\nhardly at all on the political questions of the day. These, even at the\r\nmoment of her death, she appeared to leave, as by established right, to\r\nher strong-minded colleague. After referring to her position as Senior\r\nConsort of the Emperor Hsien-Feng and recording the fact that during his\r\nminority the young Emperor had done justice to his education (in which\r\nshe had always been much interested), the Edict proceeds as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “In spite of the arduous duties of the State, which have\r\n    fully occupied my time, I was naturally of robust constitution\r\n    and had therefore fully expected to attain to a good old age\r\n    and to enjoy the Emperor’s dutiful ministrations. Yesterday,\r\n    however, I was suddenly stricken with a slight illness and His\r\n    Majesty thereupon commanded his physician to attend me; later\r\n    His Majesty came in person to enquire as to my health. And now,\r\n    most unexpectedly, I have had a most dangerous relapse. At 7\r\n    P.M. this evening I became completely confused in mind and now\r\n    all hope of my recovery appears to be vain. I am forty-five\r\n    years of age and for close on twenty years have held the high\r\n    position of a Regent of the Empire. Many honorific titles and\r\n    ceremonies of congratulation have been bestowed upon me: what\r\n    cause have I therefore for regret?”\r\n\r\nAt her request, and with that modesty which custom prescribes, the period\r\nof Imperial mourning was reduced from twenty-seven months to twenty-seven\r\ndays. There is a human touch in the conclusion of this Decree which seems\r\nto preclude the conclusion that Tzŭ Hsi had any hand in its drafting,\r\nfor it describes Tzŭ An as having been careful to “set a good example of\r\nthrift and sobriety in the Palace and to have steadily discountenanced\r\nall pomp and vain display in her share of the Court ceremonies.” As most\r\nof the charges levelled for many years against Tzŭ Hsi by Censors and\r\nother high officials referred to her notorious extravagance, this, and\r\nTzŭ An’s last request for a modest funeral as the fitting conclusion to a\r\nmodest life, were a palpable hit.\r\n\r\nTzŭ An was dead. The playmate of her youth, the girl who had faced with\r\nher the solemn mysteries of the Forbidden City, the woman who later,\r\nbecause of her failure to provide an heir to the Throne, had effaced\r\nherself in favour of the Empress Mother, her poor-spirited rival of many\r\nyears—Tzŭ An would trouble her no more. Henceforth, without usurpation\r\nof authority, Tzŭ Hsi was free to direct the ship of State alone, sole\r\nRegent of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAnd with the death of her colleague came the desire to be free from\r\nthe restraints of advice given by prescriptive right of long-standing\r\nauthority, the ambition to be the only and undisputed controller of the\r\nnation’s destinies, and acknowledged Head of the State. For many years—in\r\nfact, since the decapitation of her favourite eunuch, An Te-hai, by\r\nPrince Kung[41] and her Co-Regent—she had been on bad terms with that\r\nPrince, and jealous of his influence and well-earned reputation for\r\nstatesmanship. The manner in which, years before, she had taken from\r\nhim his title of Adviser to the Government has already been described.\r\nUnable to dispense with his services, desirous of profiting by his ripe\r\nexperience, especially in foreign affairs, she had borne with her Prime\r\nMinister grudgingly and of necessity. In 1884, however, she felt strong\r\nenough to stand alone, and the war with France (caused by the dispute as\r\nto China’s claims to suzerainty over Tongking) gave her an opportunity\r\nand an excuse for getting rid at one stroke of Prince Kung and his\r\ncolleagues of the Grand Council.\r\n\r\nThe immediate pretext for their dismissal was the destruction of the\r\nChinese fleet of junks by the French in the Min River, but Her Majesty’s\r\nreal reason was that she believed that the Prince was intriguing against\r\nher with the young Emperor, and that he was to some extent responsible\r\nfor a recent Memorial, in which several Censors had roundly denounced her\r\nfor depraved morals and boundless extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe Decree in which she dismissed this able adviser of the Throne is in\r\nher best manner, displaying many of the qualities which explain this\r\nremarkable woman’s long and successful rule. The facts to which she\r\nrefers have a direct and interesting connection with much subsequent\r\nhistory:—\r\n\r\n    “Our country has not yet returned to its wonted stability,\r\n    and its affairs are still in a critical state. There is chaos\r\n    in the Government and a feeling of insecurity amongst the\r\n    people. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that there\r\n    should be competent statesmen at the head of affairs, and that\r\n    our Grand Council should be an efficient pivot and centre of\r\n    administration.\r\n\r\n    “Prince Kung, at the outset of his career, was wont to\r\n    render us most zealous assistance; but this attitude became\r\n    modified, as time went by, to one of self-confident and callous\r\n    contentment with the sweets of office, and of late he has\r\n    become unduly inflated with his pride of place, displaying\r\n    nepotism and slothful inefficiency. On occasions when we have\r\n    urged the Grand Council to display zeal and single-hearted\r\n    devotion to the State, he and his colleagues have ruthlessly\r\n    stuck to their preconceived ideas, and have failed to carry\r\n    out our orders, for which reason they have more than once been\r\n    impeached, either on grounds of obstructiveness or general\r\n    uselessness. It has even been said of them that their private\r\n    lives are disreputable, and that they have dared to recommend\r\n    persons for high office from improper and corrupt motives.\r\n\r\n    “The House-laws of our Dynasty are most severe, and if there\r\n    were any truth in the accusations of treason that have been\r\n    made against Prince Kung, we should not hesitate for a single\r\n    moment to inflict upon him the extreme penalty of the law. We\r\n    do not believe, however, that he can have dared to act in the\r\n    manner suggested. We set these aside, therefore, and will deal\r\n    only with the other charges to which we have referred, and for\r\n    which there would appear to be good foundation. They are in\r\n    themselves more than sufficient to cause the gravest injury\r\n    to the State, and if we continue to treat the Prince with\r\n    leniency, how shall we justify ourselves hereafter in the eyes\r\n    of our glorious ancestors? We shall incur no small blame in\r\n    the eyes of posterity, and when the day comes for the Emperor\r\n    to take over charge of the Government there can be no doubt\r\n    that he would be likely to fail, under such conditions, to shed\r\n    lustre, by his reign, on the Dynasty.\r\n\r\n    “If we were to make public even one or two of the accusing\r\n    Memorials that have reached us, it would be impossible for us,\r\n    on grounds of privilege, to extenuate the Prince’s faults,\r\n    and we should be forced to cashier several of our senior\r\n    advisers. In the magnanimity of our heart we shrink, however,\r\n    from any such drastic steps, being moved to deep compassion\r\n    at the thought that Prince Kung and his colleague, the Grand\r\n    Secretary, Pao Yün, should have served us so long and now have\r\n    come to deserve our stern censure and severe punishment. We are\r\n    prompted to leniency by remembrance of the fact that Prince\r\n    Kung suffers from a complication of diseases, while Pao Yün\r\n    has reached an advanced old age. In recognition of their past\r\n    merits we have, therefore, decided that their good fame may\r\n    be left to them, and remain unsullied for the rest of their\r\n    days. As a mark of our Imperial clemency we have decided to\r\n    permit Prince Kung to retain his hereditary Princedom, together\r\n    with all the emoluments thereof, but he is hereby deprived of\r\n    all his offices, and the double salary which he has hitherto\r\n    enjoyed is withdrawn. He is permitted to retire into private\r\n    life and attend to the care of his health.\r\n\r\n    “As regards the Grand Secretary, Pao Yün, he also is allowed\r\n    to retire from public life, retaining his present rank and\r\n    titles. As for Li Hung-tsao,[42] who has been a member of the\r\n    Council for many years, his narrow views and lack of practical\r\n    experience have caused him to fail completely in his duties.\r\n    Finally, Ching Lien, the President of the Board of War,\r\n    seems to think that his duties are satisfactorily performed\r\n    by adherence to a routine of procrastination, the man being\r\n    devoid of the first elements of knowledge. Both these officials\r\n    are hereby relieved of their posts, to be employed in lower\r\n    positions hereafter. Weng T’ung-ho, the President of the Board\r\n    of Works, has only recently been appointed a member of the\r\n    Council, at a time of serious complications, and has, so far,\r\n    taken no active part in its proceedings. He therefore escapes\r\n    censure or penalty. As a mark of our consideration we hereby\r\n    remove him from his post on the Grand Council, but permit him\r\n    to retain his position on the Board of Works, and he will\r\n    continue his services as Tutor to the Emperor.”\r\n\r\n    “For a long time past we have been quietly observing the\r\n    behaviour and general tendencies of Prince Kung and his\r\n    colleagues, and we are quite convinced in our mind that it is\r\n    useless to look to them for any activity or awakening of their\r\n    petrified energies. If they were retained in office, we firmly\r\n    believe that they would end by incurring severe punishment by\r\n    causing some really serious disaster to the State. For this\r\n    reason we now content ourselves with mild censure from a sense\r\n    of pity, as a measure of precaution. It is not because of any\r\n    trivial misdemeanour, or because of the impeachment by Censors\r\n    that we thus dismiss from office a Prince of the Blood and\r\n    these high Ministers of our Government, nor is our action taken\r\n    on any sudden impulse and without full consideration.”\r\n\r\nAs the result of this Decree, Prince Kung retired from the scene,\r\nto remain in unemployed obscurity until 1894, when, after the first\r\ndisasters of the war with Japan, Tzŭ Hsi, older and wiser, turned to him\r\nonce more for assistance. He never completely regained the influence\r\nwith the Empress which he had enjoyed in the earlier days of the first\r\nRegency, but after his return to office until his death in 1898, his\r\nprestige, especially among foreigners, was great. Tzŭ Hsi, though she\r\nloved him not, was forced to admit that he had accepted and borne his\r\ndegradation with dignity.\r\n\r\nAfter the issue of the above Decree, Prince Kung was succeeded in office\r\nby Prince Li, the head of the eight Princely families and a descendant of\r\na younger son of Nurhachu. With him were associated on the Grand Council,\r\namongst others, the elder brother of Chang Chih-tung and Sun Yu-wen.[43]\r\nThe latter was a bitter enemy of the Imperial Tutor, Weng T’ung-ho. In\r\nappointing him to the Council, Tzŭ Hsi followed her favourite tactics of\r\ncreating dissension among her advisers and maintaining the equilibrium of\r\nher own authority as the resultant of their conflicting forces.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty’s next step aroused a storm of opposition and criticism.\r\nShe decreed that in all matters of urgency, the Grand Council, before\r\nadvising the Throne, should confer with the Emperor’s father, Prince\r\nCh’un, but added that upon the Emperor’s attaining his majority, she\r\nwould issue further instructions on this subject. This was not only an\r\nentirely new and irregular departure, since it made the Emperor’s father\r\n_de facto_ head of the executive, but it implied the possibility of\r\nviolation of the solemn pledges given to the nation in 1875, as to the\r\nprovision of an heir to the Emperor T’ung-Chih. Fears were once more\r\naroused in an acute form that Prince Ch’un might hereafter persuade\r\nhis son to ignore the ancestral claims of the late Emperor, and thus\r\nconstitute the house of Ch’un founders of a new line. The Prince would\r\nhave great inducement to adopt this policy, as it would confer upon him\r\nand upon his wife (Tzŭ Hsi’s sister) Imperial rank during their lives\r\nand Imperial honours after their death. The reign of T’ung-Chih would in\r\nthat case be practically expunged, going down to posterity dishonoured\r\nas the ignominious end of the senior branch of the Ta Ching Dynasty,\r\nand the Yehonala clan would become of paramount influence. A wide field\r\nwould thus be left for future dissensions, treasons, stratagems and Court\r\nintrigues. In fact the position thus created would be somewhat similar to\r\nthat which arose from the rivalry of the Houses of York and Lancaster in\r\nEnglish history.\r\n\r\nAn Imperial Clansman, named Sheng Yü, and other scholars, memorialised in\r\nthe most urgent terms praying the Empress to cancel this appointment and\r\nsuggesting that if Prince Ch’un’s advice were really needed, it should\r\nbe given to herself direct and not to the Grand Council. The writers\r\nadvanced numerous arguments, all calculated to save the face of Prince\r\nCh’un while preventing him from accepting the position. They doubted\r\nwhether his health would stand the strain, and whether the duties of the\r\npost were consistent with his high calling; at the same time they foresaw\r\nthat a post which practically conferred the powers of a Dictator must\r\nundoubtedly make him unpopular, a result which Her Majesty herself would\r\nbe the first to deplore.\r\n\r\nBesides, had not the Emperor Chia-Ch’ing declared (in 1799) that Princes\r\nof the Blood were not eligible for service on the Grand Council, except\r\nin cases of urgent and exceptional emergency?\r\n\r\n    “The truth is,” they concluded, “that a Prince of the Blood,\r\n    by virtue of his position, cannot be liable to the same\r\n    punishments as ordinary subjects, and for this reason he\r\n    should not hold a Government office. Prince Kung has held this\r\n    high post, it is true, but this was merely temporary, and in\r\n    any case, the power conferred upon him was much less than\r\n    that which it is now proposed to confer upon Prince Ch’un.\r\n    We therefore respectfully invite Your Majesty reverently to\r\n    conform to the laws of the Dynasty, and to cancel the Decree\r\n    conferring these functions upon Prince Ch’un.”\r\n\r\nAs final objections, the Memorialists observed that the Prince could not\r\nbe expected to attend every morning at the Palace, nor could he usurp\r\nthe Imperial prerogative by expecting the Grand Council to meet at his\r\nresidence; and it would be irregular for the Censors to denounce any\r\nerrors committed by a Prince of the Blood as head of the Council.\r\n\r\nThe Censor Chao Erh-hsün (an upright official who has since held\r\noffice as Viceroy in Manchuria and in Ssŭ-Ch’uan) memorialised in the\r\nsame sense, observing that the Grand Council would be superfluous if\r\neverything had to be referred to Prince Ch’un, whose position as father\r\nof the Emperor made him impossible for this post. “Why,” said he, “could\r\nnot Her Majesty command the Prince to attend before her, whenever she\r\nneeded his advice, and let him expound his views to her in person? There\r\ncould be no objections to this course.”\r\n\r\nTo these remonstrances Tzŭ Hsi replied:\r\n\r\n    “There is no doubt that the sage decisions of former Emperors\r\n    deserve to be treated with every consideration and respect, but\r\n    it is to be observed that, ever since I assumed the Regency,\r\n    I have been by circumstances compelled to confer regularly on\r\n    confidential business with a Prince of the Blood. You must all\r\n    be aware that this situation has been forced upon me owing to\r\n    the exigencies of the times, and was none of my seeking. The\r\n    Decree in which, some days ago, I appointed Prince Ch’un to be\r\n    Adviser to the Council, had no reference to ordinary routine\r\n    business, with which he has no concern, but only to urgent\r\n    matters of State. I had not, and have not, any intention of\r\n    giving him a definite appointment, and he himself was most\r\n    reluctant to accept at my hands even this advisory position; it\r\n    was because of his repeated entreaties that I promised to issue\r\n    further instructions in the matter upon the Emperor’s reaching\r\n    his majority. The present arrangement is of a purely temporary\r\n    nature. You cannot possibly realise how great and numerous are\r\n    the problems with which I have to deal single-handed. As to\r\n    the Grand Council, let them beware of making Prince Ch’un’s\r\n    position an excuse for shirking their responsibilities. In\r\n    conclusion, I wish that my Ministers would for the future pay\r\n    more respect to the motives with actuate their Sovereign’s\r\n    actions, and abstain from troubling me with their querulous\r\n    criticisms. The Memorialists’ requests are hereby refused.”\r\n\r\nRescripts of this kind are curiously suggestive of Queen Elizabeth, and\r\nher manner of dealing with similar petitions from her loyal and dutiful\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTZŬ HSI “EN RETRAITE”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Kuang-Hsü completed his seventeenth year, and Tzŭ Hsi saw\r\nherself confronted by the necessity of surrendering to him the outward\r\nand visible signs of sovereignty. The change was naturally viewed with\r\napprehension by those of her courtiers and kinsmen who for the last\r\nten years had basked in the sunshine of her unfettered authority and\r\npatronage, whose places and privileges might well be endangered by a\r\nnew _régime_. When, therefore, as in duty bound, she expressed a desire\r\nto retire from public life, it was not surprising that urgent petitions\r\nand remonstrances poured in, begging her to continue yet a little while\r\nin control of affairs, nor that she should finally allow herself to be\r\npersuaded. It was not until February 1889 that she definitely handed over\r\nthe reins of government to the Emperor, on the occasion of his marriage\r\nto the daughter of her brother, Duke Kuei Hsiang.\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi was now fifty-five years of age. For nearly thirty years she\r\nhad been _de facto_ ruler of the Celestial Empire. She had tasted the\r\nsweets of autocracy, had satisfied all her instincts of dominion, and it\r\nseemed as if she were not unwilling to enjoy the fruit of her labours and\r\nto exchange the formal routine of the Forbidden City for the pleasures\r\nand comparative freedom of life at the Summer Palace, which was now in\r\ncourse of reconstruction. Always avid of movement and change, weary of\r\nthe increasing toil of audiences and Rescripts, apprehensive, too, of\r\nthe steadily increasing pressure of the earth-hungry Powers on China’s\r\nfrontiers, she could not fail to be attracted by the prospect of a life\r\nof gilded leisure and recreation. Nor could she have remained on the\r\nThrone, Kuang-Hsü being alive, without an overt and flagrant act of\r\nusurpation for which, until he had been tried and found wanting, there\r\nwas no possible justification. Certain writers, foreign and Chinese, have\r\nimputed to her at this period a policy of _reculer pour mieux sauter_,\r\nsuggesting that her hand, though hidden, was never really withdrawn from\r\nthe affairs of the Forbidden City. To some extent the suggestion is\r\njustifiable; but Tzŭ Hsi’s retirement in the I-Ho Yüan lasted, roughly\r\nspeaking, for ten years, during a considerable portion of which period\r\nshe undoubtedly ceased to concern herself with affairs of State, other\r\nthan those which directly affected the replenishing of her privy purse.\r\n\r\nBut while divesting herself of the outward and visible signs of\r\nrulership, Tzŭ Hsi had no intention of becoming a negligible quantity,\r\nor of losing touch with current events. From her luxurious retreat at\r\nthe foot of the hills which shelter Peking, she could keep close watch\r\non the doings of the Emperor, and protect the interests of her personal\r\nadherents in the capital and the provinces. Her power of appointing and\r\ndismissing officials, which drew much of its inspiration from the Chief\r\nEunuch, was never surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn marrying the Emperor to her favourite niece, Tzŭ Hsi intended to\r\navoid a repetition of the mistake which she had committed in the case of\r\nher son, the Emperor T’ung-Chih, whose marriage with the virtuous and\r\ncourageous A-lu-te had resulted in dangerous intrigues against herself,\r\nuntil death had removed the offenders. Warned by this experience,\r\nshe made her selection in the present instance less with a view to\r\nthe Emperor’s felicity than to the furtherance of her own purposes,\r\nwhich necessitated the presence by his side of someone who would watch\r\nover, and report on, his proceedings and proclivities. This part her\r\nniece played to perfection. In appearance she was unattractive, and in\r\ndisposition and temper unsympathetic, but she possessed a considerable\r\nshare of the Yehonala intelligence and strength of will. From the very\r\nfirst she was on bad terms with the Emperor. It was no secret at Court\r\nthat they indulged in fierce and protracted quarrels, in which the young\r\nEmpress generally came off victorious. As a natural result, Kuang-Hsü\r\ndeveloped and showed a marked preference for the society of his two\r\nsenior concubines, known respectively as the “Pearl” and “Lustrous”\r\nconsorts.\r\n\r\nUpon the Emperor’s assumption of rulership, there was shown a strong\r\nfeeling amongst the senior members of the Yehonala clan that the\r\nopportunity should be taken to consolidate its position and power by\r\nconferring on the Emperor’s father rank in the hierarchy higher than that\r\nwhich he had hitherto held, with a view to his ultimate canonisation\r\nas Emperor. The manner in which this proposal was put forward, and Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s refusal to act upon it—while giving all possible “face” to Prince\r\nCh’un—throw light upon one of the undercurrents of China’s dynastic\r\naffairs which are so difficult for Europeans to follow.\r\n\r\nThe views of Prince Chun’s adherents were voiced in a Memorial addressed\r\nto the Empress Dowager by Wu Ta-ch’eng, formerly Vice-President of the\r\nCensorate, who at that time held the post of Director of the Yellow River\r\nConservancy. This Memorial, after referring to the services rendered\r\nby Prince Ch’un as head of the Admiralty, and praising his patriotism,\r\nzeal and extreme modesty, proceeded to observe that he was, after all,\r\nthe Emperor’s own father, and, as such, entitled to higher respect in a\r\nDynasty which “won the Empire by virtue of its respect for filial piety.”\r\nThe Memorialist further recommended that the Son of Heaven should be\r\nauthorised to grant special recognition and honour to his parent, on the\r\nprinciple laid down by Mencius that “the main principle underlying all\r\nceremonies is that satisfaction should be felt by those concerned.”\r\nAs usual, the Memorialist strengthened his request with reference to\r\nhistorical precedents, and quoted a case, referred to by the Emperor\r\nCh’ien Lung in his edition of Chu Hsi’s famous historical work, where\r\ntwo parties in the State under the Sung Dynasty disagreed as to the\r\ntitle to be accorded to the father of the Emperor (A.D. 1050). In that\r\ninstance the opinion of His Majesty Ch’ien-Lung (as a commentator) was\r\nopposed to that of the historians, for he supported the contention that\r\nthe Emperor’s father, as a simple matter of filial piety, is entitled to\r\nspecial honour. He quoted a case where, under the Ming Dynasty (1525),\r\nthe Emperor desired to have his father raised to the rank of Emperor,\r\nalthough he also had been born only to princely rank; in other words, the\r\nEmperor Ch’ien Lung, who is justly regarded as the highest authority on\r\nprecedents produced by the present Dynasty, placed the blood-tie between\r\nfather and son above all the theories and conventions that might be\r\nraised by courtiers as to their official relationship. The Memorialist\r\nconcluded by recommending that the title of “Imperial father” be given\r\nto Prince Ch’un, and that the Empress Dowager should announce this as\r\nthe last act of her rule, so that His Majesty’s filial piety might be\r\nfittingly displayed.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the above Memorial was inspired\r\nin the high quarters immediately concerned, so as to afford Her Majesty\r\nan opportunity for putting on record her own views, while bestowing\r\ngreat honour on the house of Ch’un. After praising the Prince and his\r\nunswerving loyalty, she continues:—\r\n\r\n    “Whenever I have wished to bestow any special honour upon him,\r\n    he has refused it with tears in his eyes. On one occasion I\r\n    granted him permission to ride in a sedan chair with curtains\r\n    of apricot yellow[44] silk, but not once has he ventured to\r\n    avail himself of this honour. He has thus displayed his loyalty\r\n    and unselfish modesty, already well known to my people as well\r\n    as to myself.\r\n\r\n    “Years ago, in the first month of the present reign, the Prince\r\n    put in a secret Memorial, in which, after reciting numerous\r\n    precedents, he expressed a fear that the very example which\r\n    has now been cited by the present Memoralist (Wu Ta-ch’eng)\r\n    might be used by sycophants and other evil persons to advance\r\n    improper proposals on his behalf. For this reason he handed\r\n    in his secret Memorial in advance, with a request that, when\r\n    the Emperor should attain his majority, no change whatsoever\r\n    should be made in his own rank and titles. Never was there a\r\n    more brilliant example of devoted service by a Minister of the\r\n    Crown, and, while heartily praising him, I yielded reluctantly\r\n    to his request. Now that I am about to hand over the reins of\r\n    Government, the very thing that Prince Ch’un feared has come\r\n    to pass, and I therefore feel bound to take this occasion to\r\n    publish to the world his original Memorial, so that none may\r\n    hope to work mischief by any further proposals of a similar\r\n    kind, and that this worthy Prince’s sincerity, thus manifested,\r\n    may become an example for all to follow.”\r\n\r\nPrince Ch’un’s original Memorial, dated 1875, is of no particular\r\ninterest except in that it reveals, even at that date, a sense of the\r\ndangers arising from the confusion of the Imperial succession and\r\nconsiderable anxiety as to the future adjustment of the situation. His\r\nown object in declining further honours was clearly stated to be that\r\nhe wished to prevent sycophants and persons of doubtful loyalty from\r\nestablishing claims upon him or forming a party in the Forbidden City,\r\nwhich (it may be observed) has actually come to pass. He deplored the\r\npossibility that when His Majesty the Emperor begins to rule in person,\r\n“officials of obscure origin may be led to think that, by artful and\r\ntreasonable suggestions, they may delude His Majesty and thus rise to\r\nhigh office by creating opportunities of dissension.”\r\n\r\nThe rank of the Emperor’s father therefore remained that of an\r\nhereditary Prince, but there is no doubt that the matter is by no means\r\ndisposed of, and may possibly be revived upon the conclusion of the\r\npresent Regent’s term of office.[45]\r\n\r\nShortly after Tzŭ Hsi’s retirement from public affairs the Emperor’s\r\nfather, Prince Ch’un, fell ill of a sickness which increased until, on\r\n1st January 1891, he died. In 1890, the Censorate, deeply concerned\r\nfor a strict observance of the laws and ceremonial etiquette of filial\r\npiety, took occasion, in a Memorial of remonstrance, to draw Her\r\nMajesty’s attention to her duty, and that of the Emperor, of visiting\r\nthe invalid. Tzŭ Hsi’s reply took the form of a rebuke to the Censors,\r\nwhom she bluntly directed to mind their own business, in a manner which\r\nforcibly brings to mind Queen Elizabeth’s methods of dealing with\r\nsimilar remonstrances. Nevertheless she took the hint and thenceforward,\r\nthroughout the summer of 1890, she paid repeated visits to Prince Ch’un’s\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\nThis Prince had always been a favourite with Tzŭ Hsi, who greatly\r\npreferred him to his elder brothers; she regretted his death and felt\r\nthe loss of his wise and fearless counsel, which had often guided her\r\npolicy. He was a staunch Manchu, jealous of the power and privileges of\r\nthe Clans, and will long be remembered in Chinese history for the remark\r\nwhich he made at a meeting of the Council after the campaign in Tongking.\r\n“It were better,” said he, “to hand over the Empire to the foreign\r\ndevils, than to surrender it at the dictation of these Chinese rebels,”\r\na remark which was prompted by the growing discontent of the province of\r\nCanton against the Manchus and their rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE TAI HO TIEN.\r\n\r\nThis Palace is used only for occasions of high ceremony, such as Imperial\r\nbirthday celebrations.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Ogawa, Tokio._]\r\n\r\nIn her Decree recording the Prince’s death and praising his eminent\r\nservices as Chamberlain of the Palace, Head of the Navy[46] and\r\nCommander of the Manchu Field Force, Tzŭ Hsi gave detailed instructions\r\nfor the mourning and funeral ceremonies, donating in her own name a\r\nTibetan prayer coverlet for the body. She conferred upon him the somewhat\r\nobvious (but according to Chinese ideas, highly honourable) title of\r\n“deceased father of the Emperor” and ordered that the funeral should be\r\nupon a scale “which shall simultaneously display His Majesty’s favour and\r\nhis sense of filial piety,” due care being taken at the same time not to\r\noutrage the deceased’s conspicuous modesty. By these means, which were\r\nin accordance with her guiding principle of the “happy mean,” she hoped\r\nto set at rest all question of “usurping tendencies” and to reassure\r\nthe Aisin Gioros as to their fears of the undue ambition of the house\r\nof Ch’un. Finally, in accordance with the precedent established by the\r\nEmperor Ch’ien-Lung, she decreed that the late Prince’s residence should\r\nbe divided into two portions, one to be set aside as his own ancestral\r\nHall and the other as a shrine (it being the birthplace) of his Majesty\r\nKuang-Hsü.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the Empress Dowager reached her sixtieth year, which, according\r\nto Chinese ideas, is an event calling for special thanksgiving and\r\nhonour. Secure in her great and increasing popularity, safely entrenched\r\nin her prestige and influence, the Old Buddha had expected to devote\r\nher leisure at the Summer Palace to preparations for celebrating this\r\nanniversary on a scale of unparalleled magnificence. The I-Ho Yüan,\r\nas the Summer Palace is called,[47] had been entirely rebuilt, by the\r\nEmperor’s orders, with funds taken from the Navy Department and other\r\nGovernment Boards since 1889, and had just been completed. Most of\r\nthe high provincial authorities had been summoned to the capital to\r\ntake part in these festivities (and, incidentally, to help to pay for\r\nthem), and amongst them the faithful Jung Lu returned once more to his\r\nmistress’s side, in high favour, as General in command of the Forces at\r\nPeking. (For the last three years he had been at Hsi-an, holding the\r\nsinecure post of Tartar General.) Every high official in the Empire had\r\nbeen “invited” to contribute twenty-five per cent. of his salary as a\r\nbirthday gift to Her Majesty, and the total amount of these offerings\r\nmust have amounted to several millions of taels. Everything pointed to\r\nfestivities of great splendour; orders had already been given for the\r\nerection of triumphal arches in her honour throughout the whole five\r\nmiles of the Imperial highway between Peking and the Summer Palace, when\r\nthe continued disasters which overtook China’s forces, immediately after\r\nthe outbreak of the war with Japan, caused Her Majesty to reconsider the\r\nsituation, and eventually to cancel all arrangements for the celebration.\r\nIn the Emperor’s name she issued the following somewhat pathetic Decree:—\r\n\r\n    “The auspicious occasion of my sixtieth birthday, occurring in\r\n    the 10th Moon of this year, was to have been a joyful event,\r\n    in which the whole nation would unite in paying to me loyal\r\n    and dutiful homage. It had been intended that His Majesty\r\n    the Emperor, accompanied by the whole Court, should proceed\r\n    to offer congratulations to me, and make obeisance at the\r\n    Summer Palace, and my officials and people have subscribed\r\n    funds wherewith to raise triumphal arches, and to decorate the\r\n    Imperial highway throughout its entire length from Peking to\r\n    the I-Ho Yüan; high altars have been erected where Buddhist\r\n    Sutras were to have been recited in my honour. I was not\r\n    disposed to be unduly obstinate and to insist on refusing these\r\n    honours, because, at the time that the celebration was planned,\r\n    my people were enjoying peace and prosperity; moreover, there\r\n    is precedent for such displays of pageantry and rejoicing in\r\n    the occasions on which the Emperors K’ang-Hsi and Ch’ien-Lung\r\n    celebrated their sixtieth birthdays. I, therefore, consented\r\n    to His Majesty’s filial request, and decided to receive\r\n    birthday congratulations at the Summer Palace. Who would ever\r\n    have anticipated that the Japanese (literally, ‘dwarf men’)\r\n    would have dared to force us into hostilities, and that since\r\n    the beginning of the summer they have invaded our tributary\r\n    State (Corea) and destroyed our fleet? We had no alternative\r\n    but to draw the sword and to commence a punitive campaign; at\r\n    this moment our armies are pressing to the front. The people\r\n    of both nations (China and Corea) are now involved in all the\r\n    horrors of war, and I am continually haunted by the thought\r\n    of their distress; therefore, I have issued a grant of three\r\n    million taels from my privy purse for the maintenance and\r\n    relief of our troops at the front.\r\n\r\n    “Although the date of my birthday is drawing close, how could\r\n    I have the heart, at such a time, to delight my senses with\r\n    revelries, or to receive from my subjects congratulations\r\n    which could only be sincere if we had won a glorious victory?\r\n    I therefore decree that the ceremonies to be observed on my\r\n    birthday shall be performed at the Palace in Peking, and all\r\n    preparations at the Summer Palace shall be abandoned forthwith.\r\n    The words of the Empress.”\r\n\r\nTo which the Emperor adds the filial remark on his own account: “That Her\r\nMajesty had acted in accordance with the admirable virtue which always\r\ndistinguished her, and that, in spite of his own wishes, he was bound\r\nreverently to obey her orders in the matter.”\r\n\r\nChina’s complete and ignominious defeat by the Japanese forces\r\nundoubtedly inflicted no small loss of prestige on the Manchu Dynasty,\r\nand was a direct cause of the violent agitation of the Southern Provinces\r\nfor reform, which led in turn to the _coup d’état_ and to the Boxer\r\nrising. It is doubtful whether war could have been avoided without even\r\ngreater sacrifices and humiliation, and the Empress Dowager showed her\r\nusual sagacity therefore in refraining from expressing any opinion or\r\ntaking any share of responsibility in the decision taken by the Emperor.\r\nShe knew, moreover, that, by the action and advice of her Chief Eunuch,\r\nthe Navy had for years been starved in order to provide her with funds\r\nto rebuild and decorate the Summer Palace, a fact of which some of\r\nChina’s most distinguished advisers were at that time unaware.\r\n\r\nAs Viceroy of the Metropolitan Province, Li Hung-chang was generally\r\nblamed for advising the Court to maintain China’s suzerainty over Corea\r\nby force of arms, but, speaking from personal knowledge of this subject,\r\nwe may state that, like many other Ministers similarly situated, he\r\nhesitated until the very last moment before taking risks which he knew to\r\nbe enormous in both directions. The documents upon which history might\r\nhave been written with full knowledge of the facts were unfortunately\r\ndestroyed in the Viceroy’s Yamên at Tientsin and in the Inspector-General\r\nof Customs’ quarters at Peking, in 1900, so that the immediate causes\r\nof that disastrous war will probably never be established with complete\r\naccuracy. Li Hung-chang was aware that twice already Japan had been\r\nbought off from a war of aggression against China, the first time (in\r\n1874) by payment of an indemnity, and again (in 1885) by admitting her\r\nto a share in the control of Corea, a concession which had led directly\r\nto the present crisis. He realised that even had he been willing to\r\nsurrender China’s rights over Corea (which were of no real advantage to\r\nthe Chinese Government) the concession might have purchased peace for\r\nthe time being, but it would certainly have led before long to the loss\r\nof the Manchurian Provinces; just as certainly, in fact, as the doom of\r\nthose provinces was sealed in 1905, on the day that China acquiesced in\r\nthe terms of the Portsmouth Treaty. Japan’s attack on China’s positions\r\nwas diplomatically as unjustifiable as the methods which she adopted in\r\ncommencing hostilities. Li Hung-chang was fully aware of the preparations\r\nthat Japan had been making for years, and equally aware of the\r\ndisorganised state of his own naval and military resources, but he was\r\nsurrounded by officials who, like the Manchus in 1900, were convinced of\r\nChina’s immense superiority, and he was assured by the Chinese Resident\r\nin Corea (Yüan Shih-k’ai) that help would be forthcoming from England\r\nin the event of Japan’s commencing hostilities. There was no doubt of\r\nthe British Government’s sympathy, which was clearly reflected in the\r\nattitude and actions of the Consul-General at Seoul.[48]\r\n\r\nChinese historians have openly accused Li Hung-chang of instigating the\r\nCourt and the Emperor to a war of aggression, and the accusation has been\r\ngenerally credited abroad. The truth is, that while Li was originally all\r\nin favour of sending a Chinese force to suppress the Corean insurrection,\r\nhe became opposed to taking any steps that might lead to war with Japan,\r\nas soon as he realised that war was Japan’s object; nevertheless, it is\r\ncertain that, in the last instance, he was persuaded against his better\r\njudgment by the military enthusiasm of his German advisers, and that the\r\nsending of the ill-fated “Kow-hsing” and her doomed crew to Corea was a\r\nstep which he authorised only after consultation with Peking and in full\r\nknowledge of the fact that it meant war. No sooner had the “Kow-hsing”\r\nbeen sunk, and the first military disasters of the campaign reported,\r\nthan he naturally endeavoured to minimise his own share of responsibility\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\nForeigners blamed him for making war on Japan, while his own countrymen\r\nattacked him for betraying China to the Japanese, as they subsequently\r\nattacked him for selling Manchuria to Russia. Tzŭ Hsi had no great love\r\nfor the Viceroy, although she admired his remarkable intelligence and\r\nadroit methods: but when, after the war, he was fiercely attacked by\r\nseveral of the Censors, and when she found her own name associated with\r\nthe blame imputed to him, she loyally defended him, as was her wont.\r\nIn 1895, a Censor named An Wei-chün boldly blamed Her Majesty and the\r\nViceroy for the disasters which had overtaken China. He said:—\r\n\r\n    “Li Hung-chang has invariably advanced himself because of his\r\n    relations with foreigners, and thus been led to conceive an\r\n    inflated opinion of his own merits. The ‘dwarf bandits’[49]\r\n    having rebelled, he seems to have been afraid that the large\r\n    sums of money, saved from numerous peculations, which he\r\n    had deposited in Japan might be lost; hence his objections\r\n    to the war. When the Decree declaring war reached him, his\r\n    disappointment was great, and he showed his resentment and\r\n    treachery by supplying the ‘dwarf bandits’ with supplies and\r\n    munitions of war. His only hope was that the ‘dwarfs’ would\r\n    prove victorious and his prophecy would thus be justified; to\r\n    this end he curtailed the supplies for our troops at the front,\r\n    diverting the funds for the same to his own pockets. He would\r\n    strongly oppose all those who urged a vigorous prosecution\r\n    of the campaign, rejoicing at our defeats and deploring our\r\n    successes. All the military commanders of the forces under his\r\n    orders humbly complied with his wishes, and invariably ran away\r\n    at the first sight of the enemy. The Censorate has been full of\r\n    Memorials denouncing the treacherous and unpatriotic action of\r\n    Li Hung-chang, so that there is no need for me to say anything\r\n    further on this subject.\r\n\r\n    “But I would like to add that Generals Yeh and Wei, who have\r\n    been cashiered and whose arrest has been decreed, are at this\r\n    very moment in hiding at Tientsin; they have made the Viceroy’s\r\n    Yamên itself a place of refuge for absconding criminals. This\r\n    is a matter of common knowledge and undoubtedly true. Then\r\n    again we have the case of Ting Ju-chang, who was ordered to\r\n    be arrested, but who persuaded Li Hung-chang to intercede for\r\n    him, on the plea that he was indispensable to China, being in\r\n    possession of a mysterious secret, an American invention which\r\n    he alone could manipulate, whereby all surrounding objects can\r\n    be rendered invisible. Li Hung-chang actually had the audacity\r\n    to make mention of this ridiculous invention in addressing\r\n    your Majesty, and it seems to me that if he is to be permitted\r\n    to refer to fables and unclean magic of this kind, he is\r\n    treating the Throne with shameless disrespect. Nevertheless,\r\n    none of your Majesty’s Councillors have ever dared to oppose\r\n    him, possibly because they themselves are too far gone in\r\n    senile decay to be able to bear any further burden of distress.\r\n    Their thoughts are far away, wool-gathering, or it may be that\r\n    they too have been smitten with fear at the thought of this\r\n    marvellous invention of Li Hung-chang’s whereby the landscape\r\n    may be completely befogged. If so, the fact would account\r\n    for the nebulous tendencies of their policy, and for their\r\n    remaining in ignorance of Li Hung-chang’s remarkable mendacity.\r\n\r\n    “The Imperial Decree whereby Shao Yu-lien and Chang Yin-huan\r\n    have been appointed Plenipotentiaries to discuss terms of\r\n    peace, has not yet been made public, because the Grand\r\n    Council are actually afraid openly to mention the word peace,\r\n    notwithstanding that they failed utterly in prosecuting the war\r\n    and in dignified insistence on our lawful rights. Their action\r\n    appears to me like that of a thief who having stolen a bell,\r\n    shuts his ears while carrying it away, blissfully forgetting\r\n    that everybody else can hear its tinkling. They do not seem to\r\n    be aware, these Councillors, that throughout the whole Empire\r\n    everybody is already aware of the fact that we are suing for\r\n    peace. Japan having objected to Shao on personal grounds, the\r\n    Grand Council has now actually gone so far as to suggest that\r\n    in his place Li Hung-chang’s son, Li Ching-fang[50] should be\r\n    appointed. This is simply an outrage. Li Ching-fang is nothing\r\n    more than the son-in-law of a Japanese traitor who calls\r\n    himself Chang Pang-chang, a man whom I have already impeached.\r\n    If such unspeakable traitors are permitted to go to Japan,\r\n    nothing will suit the Japanese better, and the negotiations\r\n    must inevitably result in our being badly cheated by these\r\n    pernicious robbers. Japan’s strength is purely superficial;\r\n    as a matter of fact, she is rotten to the core; if now we are\r\n    debarred from compelling Japan to fight a decisive battle, if\r\n    we meekly accept terms dictated by these low-born dwarfs, we\r\n    are simply in the position of a tributary State, and cannot\r\n    be described as equals in any treaty that may be made. In\r\n    other words, our glorious Empire is not only being ruined by\r\n    muddlers, but sold by traitors. There is not a single subject\r\n    of the Throne who does not gnash his teeth with rage, and long\r\n    to sink them in the flesh of Li Hung-chang.\r\n\r\n    “There are not lacking people who declare that this humiliating\r\n    policy of peace has been prompted by the Empress Dowager’s\r\n    Chief Eunuch, Li Lien-ying. For myself, I do not care to attach\r\n    undue importance to tea-house gossip, but as the Empress\r\n    Dowager has now handed over the reins of Government to your\r\n    Majesty, how can you possibly justify your position before\r\n    your ancestors and to your subjects, if you permit her still\r\n    to dictate to you, or to interfere in the business of the\r\n    State? What sort of a person is this Li Lien-ying who dares\r\n    to interfere in Government matters? If there be any truth\r\n    whatsoever in the rumour, it is assuredly incumbent upon your\r\n    Majesty to inflict severe punishment on this creature, if only\r\n    because of that House-law of your Dynasty which forbids eunuchs\r\n    to concern themselves in State affairs.\r\n\r\n    “The truth is that the Throne has been intimidated by Li\r\n    Hung-chang, and has taken his statements for granted, while the\r\n    Grand Council, chiefly composed of Li’s humble and obedient\r\n    servants, shields him from detection and punishment, fearing\r\n    that, if thwarted, he may raise the standard of rebellion. They\r\n    accordingly do their best to justify him in the eyes of your\r\n    Majesty, failing to realise that he has always been a traitor\r\n    at heart. His is the will, if not the power, to rebel. His army\r\n    is composed of corrupt and useless creatures quite devoid of\r\n    any military knowledge or instincts, while his troops are ever\r\n    on the verge of mutiny, because they are always defrauded of\r\n    their pay. They are quite deficient in _esprit de corps_, and\r\n    the small foreign forces lately organised at Tientsin would\r\n    more than suffice to overcome Li Hung-chang and all his host.\r\n    The truth of these statements can easily be verified. Long ago,\r\n    if he had had the power, he would surely have rebelled; but as\r\n    he cannot do so, he contents himself with bullying your Majesty\r\n    and disregarding your Imperial Decrees. He totally ignores\r\n    the existence of the Empress Dowager and of your Majesty,\r\n    a fact which may be inferred from his daring to insult\r\n    your intelligence with his mysterious powers of conferring\r\n    invisibility.\r\n\r\n    “I am covered with shame and amazement. My only hope is that\r\n    your Majesty will now display the majesty of your wrath, and,\r\n    after disclosing Li Hung-chang’s treason to all men, will\r\n    put this traitor to death. By this means our troops would at\r\n    once be inspired to valour, and the ‘dwarf bandits’ would be\r\n    completely annihilated. At the same time, I would ask you to be\r\n    so good as to behead me also, as a fitting punishment for this\r\n    plain speaking. Your Majesty’s Imperial ancestors are present\r\n    in the spirit, and they bear me witness. I am quite easy in my\r\n    mind as to the issue, and I therefore lay bare the innermost\r\n    thoughts of my heart and lay them before your Majesty,\r\n    anxiously begging for your Imperial decision.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to this outspoken document, the Emperor issued the following\r\nDecree, which bears unmistakable signs of Tzŭ Hsi’s hand. The attack upon\r\nher favourite, Li Lien-ying, was in itself sufficient to bring her to the\r\nfront, and there is no doubt that at the time she was keeping very close\r\nwatch on the Emperor’s proceedings, and regularly perusing all State\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n    “Owing to the seriousness of recent events, we have been\r\n    particularly anxious of late to receive and attend to the\r\n    unprejudiced suggestions of our Censors, and we have abstained\r\n    from punishing any of them, even when they have made use of\r\n    improper expressions in addressing us. With the gracious\r\n    consent of Her Majesty the Empress Dowager, we have given\r\n    particular attention to all projects whereby the welfare of our\r\n    people may be advanced, and all our people must by this time\r\n    be aware of our sincere desire to promote good Government. In\r\n    spite of this the Censor, An Wei-chün, has to-day submitted\r\n    a Memorial based entirely upon rumours, and containing the\r\n    following sentence:—‘How can you possibly justify your position\r\n    before your ancestors and to your subjects if you permit the\r\n    Empress Dowager still to dictate to you, or to interfere in the\r\n    business of the State?’\r\n\r\n    “Language of this kind reveals depths of audacity unspeakable,\r\n    the unbridled licence of a madman’s tongue. Were we to fail in\r\n    inflicting stern punishment in a case of this kind, the result\r\n    might well be to produce estrangement between Her Majesty the\r\n    Empress and ourselves. The Censor is, therefore, dismissed from\r\n    office and sentenced to banishment at the post-roads, on the\r\n    western frontier where he shall expiate his guilt and serve as\r\n    a wholesome warning to others. His Memorial is handed back to\r\n    him with the contempt it deserves.”\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi felt deeply the humiliation of her country’s defeat by the\r\nJapanese, a race which, as Chinese historians never fail to remind\r\nthemselves, took its first lessons in civilisation and culture from\r\nChinese scholars and artists. Anxious at all costs to avoid another\r\ninvasion of Chihli by the conquerors, she approved the Treaty of\r\nPeace, especially when assured by Li Hung-chang that Russia and her\r\nContinental allies would not allow Japan to annex any portion of the\r\nManchurian Provinces. As above stated, she declined to permit Li to be\r\nmade a scapegoat either by her chagrined Manchu kinsmen or by his fierce\r\ncritics in the south, for she recognised the difficulty of his position,\r\nand the fact that he was not directly responsible for the deplorable\r\ncondition of China’s defences. But, woman-like, she had to blame someone\r\nfor the disasters that had deprived her and her capital of festivities\r\nwhose splendour should have gone down, making her name glorious, to all\r\nposterity; and it was not surprising, therefore, if she heaped reproaches\r\non the Emperor for entering upon so disastrous a war without her full\r\nknowledge and consent. It was at this time that began the estrangement\r\nwhich thenceforward gradually grew into the open hostility and secret\r\nplottings of 1898, the long bitterness between Tzŭ Hsi and her nephew\r\nwhich was to divide the Palace into camps of strife, and to cease only\r\nwith their death. From this time also, as they aver who were in close\r\ntouch with the life of the Court, the Emperor’s Consort,[51] Tzŭ Hsi’s\r\nniece, became openly alienated from him, and their relations grew more\r\nseverely strained as his reform tendencies developed and took shape.\r\nFrom 1894 to 1896 there was no noticeable change in the attitude of\r\nthe Emperor to his august aunt, nor any diminution of his respectful\r\nattentions, but the man in the street knew well, as he always knows in\r\nChina, of the rift in the lute, and when, in 1896, the Emperor’s mother\r\n(Tzŭ’s sister) died, it was realised that the last bond of amity and\r\npossible reconciliation between Kuang-Hsü and the Empress Dowager had\r\nbeen severed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE REFORM MOVEMENT OF 1898\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1898 the Grand Council was composed of the following\r\nofficials: Prince Kung, the Emperor’s uncle, Prince Li, whose son was\r\nmarried to Jung Lu’s daughter, Kang Yi,[52] Liao Shou-heng and Weng\r\nT’ung-ho, the Grand Secretary and ex-tutor to the Emperor. The Empress\r\nDowager was still leading her life of dignified leisure at the Summer\r\nPalace, generally in company with her two confidential friends, the\r\nwife of Jung Lu and her adopted daughter, the Princess Imperial. By all\r\naccounts she was amusing herself with picnics on the K’un Ming lake,\r\nelaborate theatrical performances and excursions to the neighbouring\r\ntemples and hill shrines, devoting her leisure from these pursuits to\r\nverse-making and painting, but keeping herself fully informed, through\r\nKang Yi and Prince Li, of all that took place in the Forbidden City.\r\nAlthough leaving the conduct of State affairs to the Emperor, she\r\noccasionally visited the city for a day or two, while the Emperor, on\r\nhis side, punctiliously repaired to the Summer Palace five or six times\r\na month to pay his respects to the Old Buddha. Their relations at this\r\nperiod were outwardly friendly. Kuang-Hsü never failed to consult Her\r\nMajesty before the issue of any important Decree, and Tzŭ Hsi was usually\r\nmost cordial in her manner towards him. She had, it is true, occasion\r\nto reprove him more than once on account of reports which reached her,\r\nthrough the eunuchs, of his violent temper and alleged bad treatment of\r\nhis attendants, reports which were probably instigated and exaggerated by\r\nLi Lien-ying for his own purposes. But Kuang-Hsü, as events subsequently\r\nproved, was fully aware of the iron hand in the velvet glove. Whenever\r\nthe Empress came to Peking, he obeyed strictly the etiquette which\r\nrequired him reverently to kneel at the Palace gates to welcome her. When\r\nvisiting her at the Summer Palace, he was not permitted to announce his\r\narrival in person, but was obliged to kneel at the inner gate and there\r\nawait the summons of admission from the Chief Eunuch. Li, who hated him,\r\ndelighted in keeping him waiting, sometimes as much as half an hour,\r\nbefore informing the Old Buddha of his presence. At each of these visits\r\nhe was compelled, like any of the Palace officials, to pay his way by\r\nlarge fees to the eunuchs in attendance on Her Majesty, and as a matter\r\nof fact, these myrmidons treated him with considerably less respect than\r\nthey showed to many high Manchu dignitaries. Within the Palace precincts,\r\nthe Son of Heaven was indeed regarded as of little account, so that the\r\ninitiative and determination which he displayed during the hundred days\r\nof reform in the summer of 1898 came as a disturbing surprise to many at\r\nCourt and showed that, given an opportunity, he was not wholly unworthy\r\nof the Yehonala blood of his mother, Tzŭ Hsi’s sister.\r\n\r\nThe official who had hitherto exercised most influence over the Emperor\r\nwas Weng T’ung-ho, the Imperial tutor. He had only rejoined the Grand\r\nCouncil in November 1894, at the critical time when the disastrous\r\nopening of the war with Japan had brought about the dismissal of the\r\nformer Council; but as Imperial tutor he had had the _entrée_ of the\r\nPalace ever since the Emperor was five years old. He was the leader of\r\nthe southern party in the capital. A native of Kiangsu (the birthplace\r\nof all the greatest scholars of China during the present Dynasty, and\r\nthe centre of national culture), he hated the narrow conservatism of the\r\nManchus, and included in his dislike the Chinese of the Metropolitan\r\nProvinces, whose politics and point of view are very similar to those of\r\nthe Manchus. The strife between north and south really dated from the\r\nbeginning of Kuang-Hsü’s reign. The two protagonists on the northern\r\nside were Hsü T’ung, a well-educated Chinese Bannerman (for all\r\npractical purposes, a Manchu at heart) who had been tutor to the Emperor\r\nT’ung-Chih; and Li Hung-tsao, a native of Chihli, who had joined the\r\nGrand Council at the same time as Weng T’ung-ho. The southern party was\r\nled by Weng T’ung-ho and P’an Tsu-yin, the latter a native of Soochow and\r\na most brilliant scholar and essayist. It is necessary to dwell on this\r\nparty strife and its development, because it was the first cause of the\r\nreform movement of 1898, of the subsequent resumption of the Regency by\r\nTzŭ Hsi, and, eventually, of the Boxer rising.\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty years these four high officials had been colleagues\r\nin Peking, meeting one another constantly in social as well as official\r\ncircles. Their literary arguments, in which the quick-witted southerners\r\ngenerally scored, were the talk of the capital. All four men bore good\r\nreputations for integrity, so that literary graduates entering official\r\nlife were glad to become their _protégés_; but the adherents of the\r\nsouthern party were the more numerous. This fact aroused the jealousy of\r\nLi and Hsü, which grew until it found vent publicly at the metropolitan\r\nexamination for the “Chin Shih,” or Doctor’s, degree in 1899, on which\r\noccasion Li was Grand Examiner and P’an Tsu-yin his chief Associate.\r\nP’an, whose duty it was to select the best essays, recommended a native\r\nof Kiangsu for the high honour of _optimus_, but Li declined to endorse\r\nhis decision, and gave the award to a Chihli man. P’an thereupon openly\r\naccused Li of prejudice and unfairness towards the southerner, and\r\ntwitted him besides on his second-rate scholarship.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Russia’s seizure of Ili, in 1880, Hsü T’ung and Weng\r\nT’ung-ho were respectively Presidents of the Boards of Ceremonies and\r\nWorks. At a conference of the highest officials, held in the Palace, Weng\r\ndeclared himself in favour of war with Russia, but Hsü, after promising\r\nto support him, left him in the lurch at the last moment, causing him\r\ndiscomfiture and loss of face. Hence, bitter enmity between them,\r\nwhich increased in intensity when they became the leaders of the rival\r\nfactions. Weng was also on bad terms with Jung Lu, who had never forgiven\r\nhim for the part he played in 1880, when Weng denounced his impious\r\n_liaison_ to the Empress Dowager and brought about his dismissal. Jung\r\nLu, as a loyal Manchu, naturally favoured the northern faction and his\r\npersonal feelings prompted him in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe enmity between the rival parties increased steadily in the early\r\nnineties, and when Li and Weng were appointed to the Grand Council, in\r\n1894, the Court itself became involved in their strife, the Empress\r\nsiding with the north and the Emperor with the south. At that time people\r\nwere wont to speak of the Li faction and the Weng faction, but later they\r\ncame to be known as the Empress Dowager’s party, irreverently nicknamed\r\nthe “Old Mother set,” and the Emperor’s party, or “Small Lad’s set.” Both\r\nP’an and Li died in 1897. It was after the latter’s death that Hsü T’ung\r\nbegan to instigate secret and sinister designs against the Emperor, whom\r\nhe called a Chinese traitor. Hsü T’ung, having been tutor to T’ung-Chih,\r\nnaturally enjoyed considerable influence with the Empress, but Kuang-Hsü\r\nflatly refused to have him on the Grand Council. So great was his\r\ndislike for the old man that he only received him once in audience\r\nbetween 1887 and 1898. Hsü had a valuable ally in Kang Yi, who hated all\r\nChinese, southerners and northerners alike, and whose influence was used\r\neffectively to sow dissension between Tzŭ Hsi and the Emperor. In 1897,\r\nKang Yi urged the Emperor to give orders that the Manchu troops should\r\nbe efficiently trained and equipped. Kuang-Hsü replied: “You persist, it\r\nseems, in the exploded idea that the Manchu soldiery are good fighting\r\nmen. I tell you that they are absolutely useless.” Kang Yi, highly\r\nincensed, promptly informed the Old Buddha and the Iron-capped Princes\r\nthat the Emperor was the enemy of all Manchus, and was plotting to\r\nappoint Chinese to all high offices, a statement which naturally created\r\na strong feeling against His Majesty at Court.\r\n\r\nEven the foreign policy of the Empire felt the effects of this rivalry\r\nof the opposing parties in the capital. The Empress, the Manchus, and\r\nthe Chinese Bannermen were in favour of coming to an understanding with\r\nRussia, while the Emperor, Weng, and the southern Chinese, inclined to a\r\n_rapprochement_ with Japan, with a view to imitation of that country’s\r\nsuccessful reforms. Li Hung-chang counted for little at the time, the\r\nfact being that, owing to his alleged responsibility for the war with\r\nJapan, his opinions were at a discount; but such influence as he had\r\nwas used against the Emperor’s party. Prince Kung, the _doyen_ of the\r\nImperial family, to whose ripe judgment the Empress herself would yield\r\nat times, was the only high Manchu to maintain friendly relations with\r\nthe Chinese party. A fine scholar himself, he had always admired Weng\r\nT’ung-ho’s literary gifts; the war with Japan had been none of his\r\nseeking, and he had been recalled to the Grand Council, at the same time\r\nas Weng, after a retirement of fourteen years.\r\n\r\nThe fact is not generally known that Weng T’ung-ho was most anxious at\r\nthis time to be sent as Special Envoy to the coronation of the Czar,\r\nfor the reason that, realising the Empress Dowager’s growing hostility\r\ntowards himself, he wished to be out of harm’s way in the crisis which\r\nhe felt to be impending. By a Decree of 1895, Weng had been “excused\r\nfrom further attendance to instruct His Majesty at the Palace of Happy\r\nEducation,” so that he could no longer influence His Majesty, as\r\nheretofore, at all times and seasons, and his rivals were thus enabled\r\nsuccessfully to misrepresent him.\r\n\r\nPrince Kung, the head of the Grand Council, went on sick furlough at the\r\nbeginning of 1898, afflicted with incurable lung and heart complaints.\r\nThe Emperor accompanied the Empress Dowager on three occasions to visit\r\nhim at his residence, and ordered the Imperial physicians to attend him.\r\nOn the 10th day of the 4th Moon he died, and the following Decree was\r\nissued by Tzŭ Hsi:—\r\n\r\n    “Prince Kung (Yi Hsin) was my near kinsman; for many years he\r\n    has assisted in my Privy Councils. When, with my colleague,\r\n    the deceased Empress Tzŭ An, I assumed the Regency at the\r\n    beginning of the late Emperor’s reign, the coast provinces\r\n    were in rebellion and the Empire in danger, Prince Kung ably\r\n    assisted me in restoring order; and I then bestowed upon him\r\n    high honours commensurate with his services. For over thirty\r\n    years he has supported me with unswerving loyalty, although\r\n    for part of that time he took no part in the business of the\r\n    State. Again I recalled him to the Council, where he has ever\r\n    done yeoman service, despite many and great difficulties. Of\r\n    late his old sickness came upon him again, and I therefore\r\n    went repeatedly with the Emperor to visit him, hoping for his\r\n    fortunate recovery. Of a sudden, yesterday, he passed away, and\r\n    thus, at this time of need, a trusty adviser is lost to me.\r\n    How describe my grief? To-day I have visited his residence,\r\n    there to make oblations. In the remembrance of bygone days I am\r\n    completely overcome. I now bestow on him the posthumous title\r\n    of ‘Loyal,’ I command that seasonal sacrifices be offered to\r\n    his spirit in the Temple of the Virtuous and Good, and I ordain\r\n    that the care of his grave shall be a charge on the public\r\n    funds. Thus I manifest my sincere regard for my worthy kinsman\r\n    and deep sorrow at the loss of my trusted Councillor.”\r\n\r\nThe above Decree clearly reflected the immediate effect on the Empress\r\nof party factions and intrigues in the Palace, and showed that, though\r\nnominally retired from control of the Government, she was still, whenever\r\nshe chose, the autocratic ruler of the Empire and ready to assert herself\r\nin that capacity. The Emperor on this occasion issued a Decree on his own\r\naccount, entirely subordinate to Tzŭ Hsi’s, and this in turn was followed\r\nby another, which called upon the Ministers of State to imitate Prince\r\nKung’s devoted loyalty. It concluded with the significant announcement\r\nthat the Prince’s valedictory Memorial had advised the Emperor to follow\r\nthe Empress Dowager’s advice in all things, to organise an efficient army\r\nand to purify the administration.\r\n\r\nPrince Kung’s death was a serious matter. On the one hand the Manchu\r\nparty lost in him its senior representative, an elder whose wise\r\ncounsel had guided them, and a statesman whose influence had been\r\nsteadily exercised against their tendencies towards an anti-Chinese and\r\nanti-foreign policy. As the last survivor of the sons of Tao-Kuang, he\r\nheld, _vis-à-vis_ the Empress Dowager, a position very different from\r\nthat of the other princes, his contemporaries. It is probable that, had\r\nhe survived, there would have been no Boxer rising. On the other hand,\r\nthe Emperor had always deferred to Prince Kung’s advice, and it was not\r\nuntil after his death that he embarked headlong on the reform schemes\r\nof K’ang Yu-wei and his associates, many of which the Prince, though no\r\nbigoted Conservative, would certainly have condemned. To Weng T’ung-ho\r\nalso the loss was serious, as well he knew, for Prince Kung had been his\r\nbest friend.\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after the Prince’s death that Weng recommended K’ang\r\nYu-wei to the Emperor’s notice, informing His Majesty that K’ang’s\r\nabilities were far superior to his own. Weng undoubtedly hoped that K’ang\r\nwould gain the Sovereign’s favour and use it to assist the southern\r\nparty against the Manchus, and especially against his arch enemies, Kang\r\nYi and Hsü T’ung; but he certainly never anticipated that K’ang would go\r\nso far as to advise the Emperor to defy the Old Buddha herself, and to\r\nplot against her sacred person. His idea was simply to gain kudos and to\r\nstrengthen his own position and that of his party. The Emperor accepted\r\nhis recommendation of K’ang, and summoned the latter to audience on the\r\n28th of the 4th Moon (14th June, 1898).\r\n\r\nWeng told his friend and colleague, Liao Shou-heng, that he would await\r\nthe result of this audience before coming to a decision as to his own\r\nfuture movements. If K’ang Yu-wei made a good impression, he would remain\r\nin office; if not, he would resign. He added that if the usual gifts of\r\nthe Dragon Festival were sent him by the Emperor, he would feel that\r\nthere was no immediate danger in his position. All he asked was that\r\nhe might escape the open hostility of the Empress Dowager, such as had\r\nfallen upon the Cantonese Vice-President, Chang Yin-huan, whose dismissal\r\nwas expected at any moment. As it happened, however, K’ang Yu-wei and his\r\nfriends persuaded the Emperor to insist on retaining Chang Yin-huan in\r\noffice, and for the next hundred days he became Kuang-Hsü’s right-hand\r\nman, playing his part, foredoomed, while in the “deep seclusion of her\r\nPalace” the Old Buddha bided her time.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of the 4th Moon, Weng T’ung-ho applied for a week’s sick\r\nleave, a face-saving device which showed that he was aware of the\r\nimpending storm. On the 23rd, His Majesty issued the first of his Reform\r\nDecrees. He had duly conferred on the subject with the Empress at the\r\nSummer Palace, and had accorded a special audience to Jung Lu. Tzŭ Hsi\r\nassured him that she would raise no obstacles to his proposed policy,\r\nprovided that the ancient privileges of the Manchus were not infringed;\r\nat the same time, she insisted on his getting rid of Weng T’ung-ho\r\nwithout delay, as he was instigating an anti-Manchu movement which, if\r\nit gained headway, might involve the Dynasty in ruin. Jung Lu strongly\r\nrecommended to His Majesty a notable progressive, the son of Ch’en\r\nPao-chen, Governor of Hupei. The fact is of interest because of the idea\r\nprevalent among Europeans, that Jung Lu was ever opposed to reform.\r\nSubsequent events compelled him to turn against the very man whom he\r\nnow recommended, but this was not so much on account of a change in his\r\nviews, as because the policy of the reformers had developed on unexpected\r\nand dangerous lines. The first Reform Decree was as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Of late years many of our Ministers have advocated a policy of\r\n    reform, and we have accordingly issued Decrees which provide\r\n    for the institution of special examinations in political\r\n    economy, for the abolition of useless troops and the old form\r\n    of examination for military degrees, as well as for founding\r\n    Colleges. No decision has been taken in these matters without\r\n    the fullest care, but the country still lacks enlightenment,\r\n    and views differ as to the course which reform should follow.\r\n    Those who claim to be Conservative patriots consider that all\r\n    the old customs should be upheld and new ideas repudiated\r\n    without compromise. Such querulous opinions are worthless.\r\n    Consider the needs of the times and the weakness of our Empire!\r\n    If we continue to drift with our army untrained, our revenues\r\n    disorganised, our scholars ignorant, and our artisans without\r\n    technical training, how can we possibly hope to hold our own\r\n    among the nations, or to cross the gulf which divides the weak\r\n    from the strong? It is our belief that a condition of unrest\r\n    creates disrespect for authority and produces friction, which\r\n    in turn leads to the formation of factions in the State,\r\n    hostile to each other as fire and water. Under such conditions,\r\n    our Government would find itself confronted by the abuses\r\n    and errors of the Sung and Ming Dynasties, to its imminent\r\n    peril. The virtuous rulers of remote antiquity did not cling\r\n    obstinately to existing needs, but were ready to accept change,\r\n    even as one wears grass-cloth garments in summer, and furs in\r\n    winter.\r\n\r\n    “We now issue this special Decree so that all our subjects,\r\n    from the Imperial family downwards, may hereafter exert\r\n    themselves in the cause of reform. The basis of education will\r\n    continue to rest on the canons of the Sages, but at the same\r\n    time there must be careful investigation of every branch of\r\n    European learning appropriate to existing needs, so that there\r\n    may be an end to empty fallacies and that by zeal efficiency\r\n    may be attained. Parrot-like plagiarisms of shallow theories\r\n    are to be avoided, and catchwords eschewed. What we desire to\r\n    attain is the elimination of useless things and the advancement\r\n    of learning which, while based on ancient principles, shall\r\n    yet move in harmony with the times. The Peking University is\r\n    to be made a model for the Empire, and all officials of the\r\n    rank of Board Secretaries, officers of the bodyguard, expectant\r\n    Magistrates, sons of high officials and Manchus of hereditary\r\n    rank, are to be entitled to enter upon a college course in\r\n    order that their talents may be trained to meet the needs\r\n    of these critical times. No procrastination or favouritism\r\n    will be tolerated, nor any disregard of these, the Throne’s\r\n    admonitions.”\r\n\r\nOn the following day was proclaimed the result of what the Emperor fully\r\nintended to be the last examination under the old classical-essay system.\r\nThe candidate originally selected for the high honour of _Optimus_\r\nwas again a Kiangsu man, but the Empress herself altered the list and\r\nconferred the coveted distinction upon a native of Kueichou province,\r\nto mark her displeasure against the province which had given birth to\r\nWeng T’ung-ho. At the same time a Decree advised members of the Imperial\r\nClan to seek education in Europe; even Princes of the Blood were to be\r\nencouraged to go abroad and to investigate political conditions. Among\r\nthe Manchus, the sensation created by these Decrees was very great; they\r\nfelt that, for the first time in history, fundamental things were being\r\nchallenged, the ancient bulwarks of the Dynastic privileges in danger.\r\nHad not Mencius himself said: “We have heard of Chinese ideas being\r\nemployed to convert barbarians, but have never heard of China being\r\nconverted by barbarians.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the issue of the second Decree, Weng T’ung-ho, on\r\nreturn from his week’s leave, proceeded as usual at 4 A.M. to the Summer\r\nPalace to attend the audience of the Grand Council. He was met by one\r\nof the Secretaries to the Council who, handing him an Imperial Decree,\r\ninformed him of his dismissal. It was Tzŭ Hsi’s first open move on behalf\r\nof the Manchu party, and a clear admission of tutelage on the part of the\r\nEmperor. This was the Decree:—\r\n\r\n    “A Vermilion Rescript.—We have recently had occasion more than\r\n    once to observe that the Grand Secretary Weng T’ung-ho has\r\n    failed in the proper performance of his duties, and that he is\r\n    the object of very general criticism. He has frequently been\r\n    impeached, and when questioned by ourselves at audience, he\r\n    has allowed his manner to betray his feelings, even daring to\r\n    express approval or displeasure in our presence. His conduct\r\n    has gradually revealed a wild ambition and a tendency to usurp\r\n    our authority: it is no longer possible to retain him on the\r\n    Grand Council. Strictly speaking, his conduct merits close\r\n    scrutiny and punishment, but bearing in mind that for years he\r\n    has served us as our tutor, we are averse to inflicting any\r\n    severe penalty. Weng T’ung-ho is ordered forthwith to vacate\r\n    his post on the Council, and to return to his native place.\r\n    Thus is our clemency made manifest.”\r\n\r\nAnother Decree proved even more plainly that the Emperor was completely\r\nunder Tzŭ Hsi’s orders; it directed that all officials above the second\r\nrank should thenceforward return thanks to Her Majesty in person upon\r\nreceiving appointments. This was a new departure, for, since the war with\r\nJapan, she had ceased to hold daily audiences, receiving officials only\r\non her birthday and other State occasions. Another Decree of the same\r\nday transferred Jung Lu to Tientsin as Viceroy of Chihli. He and K’ang\r\nYu-wei were received in audience next morning. To Jung Lu the Emperor\r\ngave orders to reorganise the forces in Chihli, adding that he looked to\r\nhim for loyal co-operation in the reform movement. The audience to K’ang\r\nYu-wei, first of many similar interviews (but the only one recorded\r\nin the official Gazette), lasted several hours. K’ang deeply disliked\r\nand feared Tzŭ Hsi, and from the outset he did his best to prejudice\r\nthe Emperor against her. He reiterated his opinion that her sympathy\r\nfor reform was merely a feint, and he roundly denounced her wanton\r\nextravagance and dissipated life at the Summer Palace. He described\r\nthe unpopularity of the Manchu rule in the south as chiefly due to the\r\npeople’s contempt for Her Majesty, and compared her private life to that\r\nof the notorious Empress Wu of the T’ang Dynasty. He advised Kuang-Hsü to\r\nrelegate her permanently to retirement, she being the chief obstacle to\r\nreform. The Emperor fell speedily and completely under K’ang’s influence,\r\nand none of his subsequent Edicts was issued without K’ang’s assistance.\r\nIn the light of later knowledge, and of almost universal Chinese opinion\r\non this subject, it is difficult to acquit K’ang Yu-wei of personal and\r\ninterested motives, of a desire to wield power in the State as the result\r\nof his influence over the Emperor, whose emotional pliability he made to\r\nserve his own ends. Looked at in this light, his denunciations of the\r\nEmpress Dowager and Jung Lu were evidently less the outcome of patriotic\r\nindignation than of his recognition of the fact that, so long as Tzŭ Hsi\r\nremained in power, his ambitions could never be achieved, nor his own\r\nposition secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE HUNDRED DAYS OF REFORM\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately following upon K’ang Yu-wei’s first audience, reform Decrees\r\nfollowed one another in rapid succession. The old examination system\r\nwhich had been in force, with one brief intermission (in K’ang-Hsi’s\r\nreign), since the days of the Sung Dynasty, was definitely abolished.\r\nFor the future, said the Emperor, papers on practical subjects were\r\nto be set at the public examinations, and while the classics were to\r\nremain as a basis for the literary curriculum, candidates for the public\r\nservice would be expected to display a knowledge of the history of other\r\ncountries and of contemporary politics. It was at this juncture that the\r\nPresident of the Board of Rites, Hsü Ying-k’uei (who, though a Cantonese,\r\nwas a stalwart Conservative), was denounced by the Censors Sung Po-lu\r\nand Yang Shen-hsiu for obstructing the decreed reforms. They begged the\r\nEmperor to “display his divine wrath by immediately reducing Hsü to the\r\nrank of a fourth class official as a warning to other offenders.” “We\r\nhave noted,” they said, “Your Majesty’s zeal in the cause of reform and\r\nyour gracious desire to promote improved education and friendly relations\r\nwith foreign Powers. The Board of Rites is in charge of all the colleges\r\nin the Empire and the Tsungli Yamên directs our policy. Hsü Ying-k’uei,\r\nPresident of the Board of Rites and a Minister of the Tsungli Yamên,\r\nis a man of second-rate ability, arrogant, ignorant, and hopelessly\r\nobstinate. Your Majesty, being deeply conscious of the vital need for\r\npermanent and radical reform, and anxious to encourage men of talent, has\r\ninstituted a special examination in political economy, but Hsü Ying-ku’ei\r\nhas dared to cast disparagement on your Majesty’s orders and has openly\r\nstated that such an examination is a useless innovation. It is his\r\nintention to allow as few candidates as possible to pass this examination\r\nso as to render it unpopular. He is similarly opposing every one of your\r\nMajesty’s proposed reforms. He vilifies western learning in conversation\r\nwith his _protégés_, and is the sworn foe of all progressive scholars.\r\nYour Majesty’s chief complaint is that such scholars are too few in\r\nnumber, but Hsü Ying-ku’ei’s chief hope is to suppress the few there are.”\r\n\r\n“In the Tsungli Yamên a single phrase wrongly expressed may well\r\nprecipitate a war; so important are the duties there to be performed\r\nthat no one unacquainted with foreign affairs, and the ways of those\r\nwho seek to injure us, can possibly render effective service to the\r\nState. Hsü Ying-ku’ei is far from being a distinguished Chinese scholar;\r\nnevertheless he despises European learning. His boundless conceit is a\r\nmenace to our country’s interests and dignity. It seems to us a monstrous\r\nthing that a man of this stamp should be employed at the Tsungli Yamên,\r\nand that his removal from the Board would be of incalculable benefit. He\r\ndeserves to be removed from office for blocking reform and impeding the\r\nexecution of your Majesty’s plans, if only as a warning to reactionary\r\nofficials, who are all a danger to their country. If your Majesty will\r\nreduce him to the fourth official rank we shall escape the ridicule of\r\nforeign nations, and the cause of reform will be greatly advanced.”\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the above Memorial, Kuang-Hsü commanded Hsü Ying-ku’ei\r\nto submit a personal explanation of his conduct. The following is the\r\ntext of his Memorial in reply, which shows K’ang Yu-wei in a light less\r\nfavourable than that in which his admirers represented him:—\r\n\r\n    “I feel that because of my uprightness I have made myself\r\n    enemies, and I am grateful to your Majesty for thus allowing\r\n    me to defend myself. The Censors accuse me of thinking\r\n    disparagingly of your Majesty’s orders. How can they know what\r\n    is in my mind? Their accusations are evidently worthless. Li\r\n    Hung-chang and myself were strongly in favour of the original\r\n    scheme for instituting an examination for political economy.\r\n    I observed, however, that great care must be exercised in\r\n    carrying out this new idea, and that the selection for office\r\n    of too many successful candidates might endanger the main\r\n    object of the reform. While in no way desiring to make the\r\n    standard prohibitively high, I was determined not to court\r\n    popularity by consenting to making the path of these candidates\r\n    too easy. How can these Censors know that we are opposed to the\r\n    proposals of reform before our Memorials have seen the light?\r\n    Their remarks are based on pure conjecture and prejudice.\r\n    Moreover, many of your Majesty’s Decrees in no way concern the\r\n    Board of Rites, _e.g._, the contemplated reform of military\r\n    examinations and the abolition of sinecures in the army. Again,\r\n    the Memorialists accuse me of vilifying western learning in\r\n    conversation with my _protégés_, and of being the sworn foe\r\n    of progressive scholars. As a native of Canton province, I\r\n    have had no little experience of foreign affairs, and have\r\n    constantly had occasion to recommend for employment men well\r\n    versed in the arts and sciences of the west; for instance, Hua\r\n    T’ing-chun, for his knowledge of marksmanship, and Fang Yao for\r\n    his skill in the manufacture of guns. With all my _protégés_\r\n    my constant object has been to encourage them to acquire a\r\n    thorough knowledge of current politics and to eschew forms of\r\n    learning that are ornamental and useless.\r\n\r\n    “When the Censors accuse me of being the foe of scholars, they\r\n    evidently refer to K’ang Yu-wei. As a native of my province\r\n    K’ang was well known to me in his youth as a worthless fellow.\r\n    After taking his degree and returning to his home, he was for\r\n    ever inciting people to litigation; his reputation was evil.\r\n    On coming to Peking he made friends with the Censors and\r\n    intrigued with certain persons in high office, making great\r\n    capital of his alleged knowledge of European science, in the\r\n    hope of obtaining a lucrative post. On three occasions he tried\r\n    to secure an interview with me, but I knew the man too well,\r\n    and declined to receive him. He then founded a society at the\r\n    Canton Guild-house, enrolling over two hundred members; but I\r\n    caused it to be suppressed, fearing that disturbances would\r\n    come of it. Hence K’ang’s hatred of me. When your Majesty\r\n    summoned him to audience, he boasted to his fellow-provincials\r\n    that high promotion was in store for him; he was keenly\r\n    disappointed at getting nothing higher than a clerkship in\r\n    the Tsungli Yamên. He has been spreading lies about me and\r\n    inciting the Censors to attack me in the hope of ousting me,\r\n    one of his chiefs, from my position. That is quite in keeping\r\n    with his character. The Grand Secretary, Li Hung-tsao, used to\r\n    say that the flaunting of western knowledge was used only too\r\n    often by persons who had no real education therein; persons who\r\n    hoodwinked the public and were accepted at their own valuation.\r\n    K’ang Yu-wei has got hold of many wild and fantastic ideas,\r\n    and is trying to make a reputation for himself by plagiarising\r\n    hackneyed articles from European newspapers and disparaging\r\n    our country’s ancient institutions. His proposals are utterly\r\n    unpractical, and his motives will not bear investigation. If he\r\n    is retained at the Tsungli Yamên, instead of being cashiered\r\n    and sent back to Canton, as he deserves, he will inevitably\r\n    bring about complications by the betrayal of State secrets. If\r\n    he remains in Peking he and his associates will assuredly plot\r\n    together for evil, their only object being to promote party\r\n    strife and to foment intrigues.\r\n\r\n    “The danger with which his revolutionary tendencies threaten\r\n    the State is indeed a most serious matter, and the Censors are,\r\n    for once, quite right in describing me as his sworn foe.\r\n\r\n    “The Censors also accuse me of despising European learning. At\r\n    audience with your Majesty I have frequently laid stress on\r\n    the importance of opening mines, building ships and providing\r\n    munitions of war; it is therefore known to your Majesty how\r\n    baseless is this charge. But since the negotiations which\r\n    followed the seizure of Kiaochao Bay, the transaction of the\r\n    Tsungli Yamên’s business has become increasingly difficult,\r\n    nor will our position be improved by this futile wrangling. I\r\n    would, therefore, humbly ask your Majesty to relieve me of my\r\n    duties at the Yamên, so that calumny may be hushed and that\r\n    I may cease to occupy a position for which I am eminently\r\n    unfitted. This is my humble prayer.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was greatly incensed at Hsü Ying-ku’ei’s outspoken\r\ndenunciation of K’ang Yu-wei, but could not as yet summon up courage to\r\noffend the Empress Dowager by dismissing from office one who enjoyed her\r\nfavour and protection. Tzŭ Hsi perused both Memorials and was secretly\r\nimpressed by Hsü’s warning in regard to the revolutionary tendencies of\r\nthe reformers. From that day, though openly unopposed to reform, she\r\nbecame suspicious of K’ang’s influence over the Emperor, but preferred\r\nto bide her time, never doubting that, at a word from her, Kuang-Hsü\r\nwould dismiss him. She gave a special audience to Wang Wen-shao, who had\r\ncome from Tientsin after handing over the Chihli Viceroyalty to Jung Lu.\r\nWang stoutly supported Hsü Ying-ku’ei’s attitude of caution in regard to\r\nseveral of the Emperor’s proposed measures. Following upon this audience,\r\nthe Emperor issued a Decree permitting Hsü to retain his posts, but\r\nwarning him to show more energy in future both at the Board of Rites and\r\nat the Tsungli Yamên. Hsü regarded this as a decided triumph, due to\r\nTzŭ Hsi’s protection, and became more than ever opposed to innovations;\r\nthis attitude was strengthened when Huai Ta Pu, his Manchu colleague at\r\nthe Board of Rites and a first cousin of Tzŭ Hsi, came out as a strong\r\nsupporter of the ultra-Conservatives.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s next Decree provided for the reorganisation of the effete\r\nManchu troops of the Metropolitan Province and for the founding of\r\ncolleges and high schools in the provinces, to correspond to the Peking\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nA reactionary Memorial by the Censor Wen T’i[53] charged his colleagues\r\nSung Po-lu and Yang Shen-hsiu with making their personal jealousy of Hsü\r\nYing-ku’ei an excuse for deluding the Emperor and setting him at variance\r\nwith the Empress Dowager. This greatly angered His Majesty, who promptly\r\nhad the offender dismissed from the Censorate for stirring up that very\r\nparty strife which his Memorial professed to denounce. Wen T’i, thus\r\nrebuked, induced Huai Ta Pu to go out to the Summer Palace and endeavour\r\nto enlist the Old Buddha’s sympathy in his behalf. She, however, declined\r\nto move in the matter, having at the moment no specific ground of\r\ncomplaint against the Emperor and preferring to give the Progressives all\r\nthe rope they wanted; but she caused Yü Lu, one of her old _protégés_, to\r\nbe appointed to the Grand Council, and this official kept her regularly\r\ninformed of everything that occurred in Peking. He belonged to the Kang\r\nYi faction of extremists and disapproved of reform with all the dogged\r\nstupidity of his class. Later, in 1900, as Viceroy of Chihli, he rendered\r\nno little assistance to Kang Yi’s schemes for massacring all foreigners,\r\nand was a noted leader of the Boxer movement. With three reactionaries\r\non the Council of the stamp of Kang Yi, Wang Wen-shao and Yü Lu, there\r\nwas small chance of any genuine opportunity or honest purpose of reform,\r\nwhatever the Emperor might choose to decree, but before the Conservatives\r\ncould assume the offensive, they had to win over Tzŭ Hsi definitely and\r\nopenly to their side, and with her Jung Lu.\r\n\r\nAt about this time Kuang-Hsü reprimanded another Censor for a trifling\r\nerror in caligraphy, the incorrect writing of a character.[54]\r\nNevertheless, a week later, a Decree was issued, clearly showing the\r\ninfluence of K’ang Yu-wei, in which it was ordered that caligraphy should\r\nno longer form a special subject at the public examinations. “In certain\r\nbranches of the public service neat handwriting was no doubt of great\r\nvalue, but it would in future be made the subject of special examinations\r\nfor the appointment of copyists.”\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of the 6th Moon, a Decree ordered arrangements to be\r\nmade for the publication of official Gazettes all over the Empire,\r\nand K’ang Yu-wei was placed in charge of the Head Office at Shanghai.\r\nThese Gazettes were to be official newspapers, and their object was\r\nthe extension of general knowledge. They were to receive Government\r\nsubsidies; copies were to be regularly submitted for the Emperor’s\r\nperusal; opinions were to be freely expressed, and all abuses fearlessly\r\nexposed. K’ang Yu-wei was directed to draw up Press regulations in this\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of the 6th Moon, another vigorous Decree exhorted the\r\nofficial class to turn its attention seriously to reforms. Herein\r\nthe Emperor declared that the procrastination hitherto displayed was\r\nmost disheartening. “Stagnation,” said the Edict, “is the sign of\r\ngrave internal sickness; hopeless abuses are bred from this palsied\r\nindifference. An earnest reformer like Ch’en Pao-chen, the Governor of\r\nHupei, becomes a target for the violent abuse of officials and gentry.\r\nHenceforward I would have you all sympathise with my anxiety and work\r\nearnestly together, so that we may profit by our past reverses and\r\nprovide for a brighter future.”\r\n\r\nAnother Decree ordered the institution of naval colleges as a step\r\npreliminary to the reconstruction of China’s fleet. Railway and mining\r\nbureaus were established in Peking, and the Cantonese reformer, Liang\r\nCh’i-Ch’ao, was given charge of a Translation Department, to publish\r\nstandard foreign works on political economy and natural science, a grant\r\nof one thousand taels per mensem being allowed to cover his expenses.\r\n\r\nBut an innovation more startling than all these, broke upon the\r\nupholders of the old _régime_ in a Decree issued in response to a\r\nMemorial by Jung Lu, who was all in favour of reform in military matters.\r\nIt was therein announced that the Emperor would escort the Empress\r\nDowager by train to Tientsin on the 5th day of the 9th Moon, and there\r\nhold a review of the troops. The Conservatives were aghast at the idea of\r\ntheir Majesties travelling by train, but Tzŭ Hsi, who had always enjoyed\r\nriding on the miniature railway in the Winter Palace, was delighted\r\nat the prospect of so novel an excursion. But if Manchu propriety was\r\nshocked at this proposal, a still heavier blow was dealt it by the next\r\nDecree, which abolished a number of obsolete and useless Government\r\noffices and sinecures, fat jobs which, for generations, had maintained\r\nthousands of idlers in the enjoyment of lucrative squeezes, a burden on\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThis Decree was loudly denounced as contrary to the traditions of the\r\nManchu Dynasty, and from all sides came urgent appeals to the Old\r\nBuddha to protect the privileges of the ruling class, and to order its\r\ncancellation. Yet another bolt fell two days later, when all the high\r\nofficials of the Board of Rites, including Hsü Ying-ku’ei and the Empress\r\nDowager’s kinsman, Huai Ta Pu, were summarily cashiered for having\r\nsuppressed a Memorial by the Secretary, Wang Chao. In this document it\r\nwas suggested that the Emperor, in company with the Empress Dowager,\r\nshould travel abroad, beginning with Japan and concluding with a tour in\r\nEurope. Realising that “the craft of Demetrius was in danger,” nearly all\r\nthe Conservatives holding high office proceeded in a body to the Summer\r\nPalace and told the Empress Dowager that the only hope of saving the\r\ncountry lay in her resumption of the supreme power. The Old Buddha bade\r\nthem wait—the sands were running out, but she was not yet ready to move.\r\n\r\nK’ang Yu-wei, realising that there was danger ahead, took advantage of\r\nwhat he mistook for indecision on the part of Tzŭ Hsi to induce the\r\nEmperor to rebel against her authority. Once more he assured Kuang-Hsü\r\nthat her professed sympathy for reform was all a sham, and that, on\r\nthe contrary, it was she herself who was the chief obstacle to China’s\r\nawakening, her influence being really the prime factor in the country’s\r\ncorruption and lethargy. Why should she be permitted to waste millions\r\nof Government funds yearly in the upkeep of her lavish establishment at\r\nthe Summer Palace? He advised the Emperor by a _coup de main_ to surround\r\nher residence, seize her person, and confine her for the rest of her\r\ndays on a certain small island in the Winter Palace lake. Thereafter he\r\nshould issue a Decree recounting her many misdeeds and proclaiming his\r\nintention never again to permit her to have any part in the Government.\r\nThis conversation was held in a private apartment of the Palace, but\r\nthere is every reason to believe that it was reported to Tzŭ Hsi by\r\none of the eunuch spies employed by Li Lien-ying for that purpose.\r\nThe Emperor foolishly allowed himself to be led into approval of this\r\nplot, but decided to await the Court’s proposed trip to Tientsin before\r\nputting it into execution. He knew that to ensure success for the scheme\r\nhe must be able to command the services of the troops, and he realised\r\nthat so long as Jung Lu was in command of the foreign-drilled forces of\r\nChihli, he would never consent to their lifting a finger against his\r\nlifelong benefactress. Herein, in the Emperor’s opinion, lay the main\r\nobstacle that confronted him. The real danger, that lay in Tzŭ Hsi’s\r\nenormous personal influence and fertility of resource, he appears to have\r\nunder-rated, mistaking her inaction for indecision.\r\n\r\nFor the moment he continued to issue new Edicts, one ordering the making\r\nof macadamised roads in Peking, another the enrolment of militia for\r\npurposes of national defence, while a third authorised Manchus to leave\r\nPeking, should they so wish, to earn their living in the provinces. On\r\nthe 27th of the 7th Moon, appeared the last of his important Reform\r\nDecrees—a document pathetic in the light of subsequent events.\r\n\r\n    “In promoting reforms, we have adopted certain European\r\n    methods, because, while China and Europe are both alike in\r\n    holding that the first object of good government should be the\r\n    welfare of the people, Europe has travelled further on this\r\n    road than we have, so that, by the introduction of European\r\n    methods, we simply make good China’s deficiencies. But our\r\n    Statesmen and scholars are so ignorant of what lies beyond\r\n    our borders that they look upon Europe as possessing no\r\n    civilisation. They are all unaware of those numerous branches\r\n    of western knowledge whose object it is to enlighten the minds\r\n    and increase the material prosperity of the people. Physical\r\n    well-being and increased longevity of the race are thereby\r\n    secured for the masses.\r\n\r\n    “Is it possible that I, the Emperor, am to be regarded as a\r\n    mere follower after new and strange ideas because of my thirst\r\n    for reform? My love for the people, my children, springs from\r\n    the feeling that God has confided them to me and that to my\r\n    care they have been given in trust by my illustrious Ancestors.\r\n    I shall never feel that my duty as Sovereign is fulfilled until\r\n    I have raised them all to a condition of peaceful prosperity.\r\n    Moreover, do not the foreign Powers surround our Empire,\r\n    committing frequent acts of aggression? Unless we learn and\r\n    adopt the sources of their strength, our plight cannot be\r\n    remedied. The cause of my anxiety is not fully appreciated\r\n    by my people, because the reactionary element deliberately\r\n    misrepresents my objects, spreading the while baseless rumours\r\n    so as to disturb the minds of men. When I reflect how deep is\r\n    the ignorance of the masses of the dwellers in the innermost\r\n    parts of the Empire on the subject of my proposed reforms, my\r\n    heart is filled with care and grief. Therefore do I hereby\r\n    now proclaim my intentions, so that the whole Empire may know\r\n    and believe that their Sovereign is to be trusted and that\r\n    the people may co-operate with me in working for reform and\r\n    the strengthening of our country. This is my earnest hope.\r\n    I command that the whole of my Reform Decrees be printed on\r\n    Yellow paper and distributed for the information of all men.\r\n    The District Magistrates are henceforward privileged to\r\n    submit Memorials to me through the Provincial Viceroys, so\r\n    that I may learn the real needs of the people. Let this Decree\r\n    be exhibited in the front hall of every public office in the\r\n    Empire so that all men may see it.”\r\n\r\nBut the sands had run out. Tzŭ Hsi now emerged from “the profound\r\nseclusion of her Palace” and Kuang-Hsü’s little hour was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE _COUP D’ÉTAT_ OF 1898\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August 1898—at the end of the 7th Moon—the position of affairs in\r\nthe Palace (known only to a few) was that the Empress Dowager had been\r\nwon over to the reactionary party; she was postponing a decisive step,\r\nhowever, until she and the Emperor made their proposed visit to Tientsin\r\nin the 9th Moon. It was her intention there to confer with Jung Lu before\r\nresuming the Regency, because of the unmistakable hostility towards her\r\nthen prevailing in the southern provinces, which she wished to allay,\r\nas far as possible, by avoiding any overt measures of usurpation until\r\nher preparations were made. On the 1st of the 8th Moon, the Emperor,\r\nwho was then in residence at the Summer Palace, received in audience\r\nYüan Shih-k’ai, the Judicial Commissioner of Chihli, and discussed with\r\nhim at great length the political needs of the Empire. Yüan (then in\r\nhis fortieth year) had owed his rapid advancement to the protection of\r\nthe great Viceroy Li Hung-chang; nevertheless, among his rivals and\r\nenemies there were many who attributed the disastrous war with Japan\r\nin 1894 to his arbitrary conduct of affairs as Imperial Resident in\r\nCorea. There is no doubt that his reports and advice on the situation\r\nat Seoul precipitated, if they did not cause, the crisis, leading the\r\nChinese Government to despatch troops into the country in the face of\r\nJapan’s desire and readiness for war, and thus to the extinction of\r\nChina’s sovereignty in the Hermit Kingdom; but the fact had not impaired\r\nYüan’s personal prestige or his influence at Court. As a result of\r\nthis audience the Emperor was completely won over by Yüan’s professed\r\ninterest in the cause of reform, and was convinced that in him he had\r\nsecured a powerful supporter. His Majesty had already realised that he\r\nmust now reckon with the Old Buddha’s uncompromising opposition; quite\r\nrecently she had severely rebuked him for even noticing K’ang Yu-wei’s\r\nsuggestion that he should act more on his own authority. Jung Lu, he\r\nknew, would always loyally support his Imperial mistress; and there\r\nwas not one prominent Manchu in the Empire, and, as far as Peking was\r\nconcerned, hardly a Chinese, who would dare to oppose the Old Buddha,\r\nif once she declared herself actively on the side of reaction. The only\r\ntwo high officials in Peking on whom he could confidently reckon for\r\nsympathy and support were the Cantonese Chang Yin-huan, and Li Tuan-fen,\r\na native of Kueichou. But if he could obtain control of the Northern\r\nforeign-drilled army, the reactionary party might yet be overthrown. To\r\nsecure this end it was essential that Jung Lu, the Governor-General of\r\nChihli and Commander-in-Chief of the foreign-drilled forces, should be\r\nput out of the way, and this before the Empress could be warned of the\r\nplot. The Emperor therefore proposed to have Jung Lu put to death in his\r\nYamên at Tientsin, and then swiftly to bring a force of 10,000 of his\r\ndisciplined troops to the capital, who would confine the Empress Dowager\r\nto the Summer Palace. At the same time the most prominent reactionaries\r\nin Peking, _i.e._, Kang Yi, Yü Lu, Huai T’a Pu and Hsü Ying-ku’ei were\r\nto be seized at their residences and hurried off to the prison of the\r\nBoard of Punishments. This was the scheme suggested by K’ang Yu-wei, the\r\nCensor Yang Shen-hsiu, and the secretaries of the Grand Council, T’an\r\nSsu-t’ung, Lin-Hsü, Yang Jui, and Liu Kuang-ti. At this first audience\r\nYüan Shih-k’ai was informed of the Emperor’s determination to maintain\r\nand enforce his reform policy, and was asked whether he would be loyal\r\nto his sovereign if placed in command of a large force of troops. “Your\r\nservant will endeavour to recompense the Imperial favour,” he replied,\r\n“even though his merit be only as a drop of water in the ocean or a grain\r\nof sand in the desert; he will faithfully perform the service of a dog or\r\na horse while there remains breath in his body.”\r\n\r\nCompletely reassured by Yüan’s words and earnest manner and his\r\napparently genuine zeal for reform, the Emperor straightway issued the\r\nfollowing Decree:—\r\n\r\n    “At the present time army reform is of all things most\r\n    essential, and the judicial commissioner of Chihli, Yüan\r\n    Shih-k’ai, is an energetic administrator and thoroughly earnest\r\n    in the matter of training our forces. We therefore accord him\r\n    the rank of Expectant Vice-President of a Board and place him\r\n    in special charge of the business of army reform. He is to\r\n    memorialise from time to time regarding any measures which\r\n    he may desire to introduce. Under the present conditions of\r\n    our Empire it is of the first importance that our defences\r\n    be strengthened, and it behoves Yüan Shih-k’ai therefore to\r\n    display all possible energy and zeal in the training of our\r\n    troops, so that an efficient army may be organised, and the\r\n    Throne’s determination to secure homogeneous forces be loyally\r\n    supported.”\r\n\r\nAt this first audience there had been no mention of the proposed removal\r\nof Jung Lu. Scarcely had Yüan left the Jen Shou (Benevolent Old Age)\r\nPalace Hall, than the Empress Dowager summoned him to her own apartments,\r\nand closely questioned him as to what the Emperor had said. “By all means\r\nlet the army be reformed,” said the Old Buddha; “the Decree is sensible\r\nenough, but His Majesty is in too great a hurry, and I suspect him of\r\ncherishing some deep design. You will await a further audience with him,\r\nand then receive my instructions.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress then sent for the Emperor, and informed him that he must\r\nhave K’ang Yu-wei placed under arrest for speaking disrespectfully of\r\nher private life and morals. She refrained from informing him that she\r\nknew of his design to deprive her of power, and she was so far unaware\r\nof the extent of the plot against herself and Jung Lu. She reproached\r\nhim, however, in general terms for his evident and increasing lack of\r\nfilial duty towards herself. The Emperor meekly promised to comply with\r\nher wishes as to K’ang Yu-wei’s arrest, but late that same evening, while\r\nthe Empress Dowager was entertaining herself at a water picnic on the\r\nK’un Ming Lake, he despatched his confidential eunuch, Sung Yu-lien, into\r\nPeking with the following Decree, drafted in His Majesty’s own unformed\r\nand childish handwriting:—\r\n\r\n    “On a previous occasion we commanded the Secretary of the\r\n    Board of Works, K’ang Yu-wei, to take charge of the Government\r\n    Gazette Bureau at Shanghai. We learn with astonishment that\r\n    he has not yet left Peking. We are well aware of the crisis\r\n    through which the Empire is passing, and have been anxious\r\n    on this account to obtain the services of men well versed in\r\n    political economy, with whom to discuss improved methods of\r\n    government. We granted one audience to K’ang Yu-wei (_sic_: as\r\n    a matter of fact K’ang was received by His Majesty on several\r\n    occasions) because of his special knowledge, and we appointed\r\n    him to take charge of the Government Gazette Bureau for the\r\n    reason that newspapers are one of the most important factors in\r\n    national education and progress. His duties are evidently of no\r\n    light responsibility, and funds having been specially raised\r\n    for this enterprise, we command him now to betake himself with\r\n    all despatch to Shanghai; he shall on no account procrastinate\r\n    any longer.”\r\n\r\nK’ang Yu-wei received the Decree, realised its significance, and left\r\nPeking by the first train next morning, arriving safely at Tongku, where\r\nhe boarded a coasting steamer for Shanghai.[55] When the Empress heard\r\nof his departure she was furious, and telegraphed to Jung Lu to arrest\r\nK’ang, but for some unexplained reason (the instructions reached him\r\nbefore K’ang could have arrived at Tientsin) Jung Lu took no steps to\r\ndo so. At this time he was unaware of the plot against his life, or he\r\nwould hardly have shown such magnanimity. K’ang Yu-wei never gave him\r\nany credit for it and has always denounced Jung Lu as second only in\r\nvillainy to the Empress Dowager, an arch enemy of reform and reformers.\r\nAs a matter of fact Jung Lu was one of the high officials who originally\r\nrecommended K’ang to the notice of the Emperor, and till the day of his\r\ndeath he always alluded to himself jocularly as one of the _K’ang T’ang_,\r\nor K’ang Yu-wei party, to the great amusement of the Old Buddha, who\r\nwould jokingly ask him what news he had of his friend K’ang, the traitor\r\nand rebel. That morning, the 2nd of the Moon, audience was given to the\r\nreformer Lin Hsü and to Yüan Shih-k’ai, who again assured the Emperor\r\nof his complete devotion. His Majesty then left for the Forbidden City,\r\nintending to carry out his plans against the Empress from there rather\r\nthan from the Summer Palace, where nearly every eunuch was a spy in her\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, so far, the Emperor by no means despaired of his\r\nchances of success, as two Decrees were issued next morning, one ordering\r\nthe teaching of European languages in the public schools, and the other\r\nrequiring purer administration on the part of district magistrates.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th, Yüan Shih-k’ai had a final audience, before\r\nleaving for Tientsin. His Majesty received him in the Palace of Heavenly\r\nPurity (Ch’ien Ch’ing Kung) of the Forbidden City. Every precaution was\r\ntaken to prevent the conversation being overheard. Seated for the last\r\ntime on the great lacquered Dragon Throne, so soon to be reoccupied by\r\nthe Empress Dowager, in the gloomy throne room which the morning light\r\ncould scarcely penetrate, His Majesty told Yüan Shih-k’ai the details of\r\nthe commission with which he had decided to entrust him. He was to put\r\nJung Lu to death and then, returning immediately to the capital with the\r\ntroops under his command, to seize and imprison the Empress Dowager. The\r\nEmperor gave him a small arrow, the symbol of his authority to carry out\r\nthe Imperial orders, and bade him proceed with all haste to Tientsin,\r\nthere to arrest Jung Lu in his Yamên and see to his instant decapitation.\r\nKuang Hsü also handed him a Decree whereby, upon completion of his\r\nmission, he was appointed Viceroy of Chihli _ad interim_, and ordered to\r\nPeking for further audience.\r\n\r\nYüan promised faithful obedience, and, without speaking to anyone, left\r\nPeking by the first train. Meantime the Old Buddha was due to come in\r\nfrom the I-ho Yüan to the Winter Palace that morning at 8 o’clock, to\r\nperform sacrifice at the altar to the God of Silkworms, and the Emperor\r\ndutifully repaired to the Ying Hsiu Gate of the Western Park, where\r\nthe Lake Palace is situated, to receive Her Majesty as she entered the\r\nprecincts.\r\n\r\nYüan reached Tientsin before noon, and proceeded at once to Jung Lu’s\r\nYamên. He asked Jung Lu whether he regarded him as a faithful blood\r\nbrother. (The two men had taken the oath of brotherhood several years\r\nbefore.) “Of course I do,” replied the Viceroy. “You well may, for the\r\nEmperor has sent me to kill you, and instead, I now betray his scheme,\r\nbecause of my loyalty to the Empress Dowager and of my affection for\r\nyou.” Jung Lu, apparently unaffected by the message, merely expressed\r\nsurprise that the Old Buddha could have been kept in ignorance of all\r\nthese things, and added that he would go at once to the capital and see\r\nthe Empress Dowager that same evening. Yüan handed him the Emperor’s\r\nDecree, and Jung Lu, travelling by special train, reached Peking soon\r\nafter 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nHe went directly to the Lake Palace, and entered the Empress’s residence,\r\nboldly disregarding the strict etiquette which forbids any provincial\r\nofficial from visiting the capital without a special summons by Edict,\r\nand the still stricter rules that guard the _entrée_, of the Palace.\r\nUn-ushered he entered the Empress’s presence, and kowtowing thrice,\r\nexclaimed, “Sanctuary, your Majesty!” “What sanctuary do you require\r\nin the Forbidden precincts, where no harm can come to you, and where\r\nyou have no right to be?” replied the Old Buddha. Jung Lu proceeded to\r\nlay before her all the details of the plot. Grasping the situation and\r\nrising immediately to its necessities with the courage and masculine\r\nintelligence that enabled her to overcome all obstacles, she directed him\r\nto send word secretly to the leaders of the Conservative party, summoning\r\nthem to immediate audience in the Palace by the Lake. (The Emperor was\r\nstill in the Forbidden City.) In less than two hours the whole of the\r\nGrand Council, several of the Manchu princes and nobles (Prince Ch’ing,\r\nwith his usual fine “flair” for a crisis, had applied for sick leave and\r\nwas therefore absent) and the high officials of the Boards, including the\r\ntwo Ministers whom the Emperor had cashiered (Hsü Ying-ku’ei and Huai Ta\r\nPu) were assembled in the presence of the Empress. On their knees, the\r\nassembled officials besought her to resume the reins of government and\r\nto save their ancient Empire from the evils of a barbarian civilisation.\r\nIt was speedily arranged that the guards in the Forbidden City should\r\nbe replaced by men from Jung Lu’s own corps, and that, in the meantime,\r\nhe should return to his post in Tientsin and await further orders. The\r\nconference broke up at about midnight. The Emperor was due to enter the\r\nChung Ho Hall of the Palace at 5.30 the next morning to peruse the litany\r\ndrawn up by the Board of Rites, which he was to recite next day at the\r\nautumnal sacrifice to the Tutelary Deities. After leaving that hall, he\r\nwas seized by the guards and eunuchs, conveyed to the Palace on the small\r\nisland in the middle of the lake (the “Ocean Terrace”) and informed that\r\nthe Empress Dowager would visit him later. The following Decree was\r\nthereupon issued by the Empress Dowager in the Emperor’s name:—\r\n\r\n    “The nation is now passing through a crisis, and wise guidance\r\n    is needed in all branches of the public service. WE ourselves\r\n    have laboured diligently, night and day, to perform OUR\r\n    innumerable duties, but in spite of all OUR anxious energy and\r\n    care WE are in constant fear lest delay should be the undoing\r\n    of the country. WE now respectfully recall the fact that Her\r\n    Imperial Majesty the Empress Dowager has on two occasions since\r\n    the beginning of the reign of H. M. T’ung-Chih, performed the\r\n    functions of Regent, and that in her administrations of the\r\n    Government she displayed complete and admirable qualities of\r\n    perfection which enabled her successfully to cope with every\r\n    difficulty that arose. Recollecting the serious burden of the\r\n    responsibility WE owe to OUR ancestors and to the nation, WE\r\n    have repeatedly besought Her Majesty to condescend once more to\r\n    administer the Government. Now she has graciously honoured US\r\n    by granting OUR prayer, a blessing indeed for all OUR subjects.\r\n    From this day forth Her Majesty will transact the business of\r\n    Government in the side hall of the Palace, and on the day after\r\n    to-morrow WE ourselves at the head of OUR Princes and Ministers\r\n    shall perform obeisance before Her in the Hall of Diligent\r\n    Government. The Yamêns concerned shall respectfully make the\r\n    arrangements necessary for this ceremonial. The words of the\r\n    Emperor.”\r\n\r\nAnother Decree followed close upon the above, cashiering the Censor Sung\r\nPo-lu, on the ground of his generally evil reputation and recommendation\r\nof bad characters (_i.e._, the reformer Liang Ch’i-ch’ao). The Empress\r\nhad a special grudge against this Censor because he had ventured to\r\nimpeach her morals in a recent memorial, but as he had taken no part in\r\nthe conspiracy against her person she spared his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIRCULAR THRONE HALL IN THE GROUNDS OF THE LAKE PALACE\r\nLOOTED BY ALLIED TROOPS IN 1900.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Betines, Peking._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAVILION ON LAKE TO THE WEST OF FORBIDDEN CITY.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Betines, Peking._]\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi in due course proceeded to the “Ocean Terrace,” accompanied only\r\nby Li Lien-ying, who had been ordered to replace the Emperor’s eunuchs\r\nby creatures of his own. (Kuang Hsü’s former attendants were either put\r\nto death or banished to the post roads.) A Manchu who heard an account\r\nof the interview from Duke Kuei Hsiang, Tz’u Hsi’s younger brother, is\r\nour authority for what occurred at this dramatic meeting. The Empress\r\nDowager bluntly informed Kuang Hsü that she had decided to spare his life\r\nand, for the present at any rate, to allow him to retain the throne. He\r\nwould, however, be kept henceforward under strict surveillance, and every\r\nword of his would be reported to her. As to his schemes of reform, which\r\nat first she had encouraged, little dreaming to what depths of folly his\r\ninfatuate presumption would lead him, they would all be repealed. How\r\ndared he forget what great benefits he owed her, his elevation to the\r\nthrone and her generosity in allowing him to administer the government,\r\nhe a poor puppet, who had no right to be Emperor at all, and whom she\r\ncould unmake at will? There was not, she said, a single Manchu in high\r\nplace but wished his removal, and urged her to resume the Regency. True,\r\nhe had sympathisers among the Chinese, traitors all; with them she would\r\ndeal in due course. Kuang Hsü’s secondary consort (the Chen Fei or Pearl\r\nConcubine, the only one of his wives with whom he seems to have been on\r\naffectionate terms) knelt then before Tzŭ Hsi, imploring her to spare the\r\nEmperor further reproaches. She actually dared to suggest that he was,\r\nafter all, the lawful Sovereign and that not even the Empress Dowager\r\ncould set aside the mandate of Heaven. Tzŭ Hsi angrily dismissed her from\r\nthe Presence, ordering her to be confined in another part of the Palace,\r\nwhere she remained until, in 1900, there came an opportunity in which the\r\nvindictive Empress took summary revenge on the presumptuous concubine.[56]\r\n\r\nThe Empress Consort, with whom Kuang Hsü was hardly on speaking terms,\r\nwas commanded to remain with him. She, as Tzŭ Hsi’s niece, could be\r\ntrusted to spy upon the Emperor and report all his doings. He was allowed\r\nto see no one but her and the eunuchs in attendance, except in the\r\npresence of the Empress Dowager.\r\n\r\nTo the end of his life Kuang Hsü blamed Yüan Shih-k’ai, and him alone,\r\nfor having betrayed him. To Yüan he owed his humiliation, the end of all\r\nhis cherished plans of government and the twenty-three months of solitary\r\nconfinement which he had to endure on the “Ocean Terrace.” Almost his\r\nlast words, as he lay dying, were to bid his brothers remember his long\r\nagony and promise to be revenged upon the author of his undoing. Of Jung\r\nLu he said that it was but natural that he should consider first his duty\r\nto the Empress Dowager and seek to warn her; and, after all, as he had\r\nplanned Jung Lu’s death, he could hardly expect from him either devotion\r\nor loyalty. The Old Buddha’s resentment was also natural; he had plotted\r\nagainst her and failed. But Yüan Shih-k’ai had solemnly sworn loyalty and\r\nobedience. The Emperor never willingly spoke to him again, even when, as\r\nViceroy of Chihli, Yüan came to the height of his power.\r\n\r\nTo-day Yüan lives in retirement, and under the constant shadow of fear;\r\nfor the Emperor’s brother, the Regent, has kept his promise. Such are\r\nthe intricate humanities of the inner circle around and about the Dragon\r\nThrone, the never-ending problem of the human equation as a factor in the\r\ndestinies of peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTZŬ HSI RESUMES THE REGENCY (1898)\r\n\r\n\r\nKuang Hsü’s reign was over; there remained to him only the Imperial\r\ntitle. He had had his chance; in the enthusiasm of youth and new ideas\r\nhe had played a desperate game against the powers of darkness in high\r\nplaces, and he had lost. Once more, as after the death of T’ung-Chih, Tzŭ\r\nHsi could make a virtue of her satisfied ambitions. She had given her\r\nnephew a free hand, she had retired from the field, leaving him to steer\r\nthe ship of State: if he had now steered it into troublous and dangerous\r\nseas, if, by common consent, she were again called to take the helm, this\r\nwas the doing of Heaven and no fault of hers. She could no more be blamed\r\nfor Kuang Hsü’s folly than for the vicious habits and premature death\r\nof her son, which had brought her back to power 23 years before. It was\r\nclear (and there were many voices to reassure her of the fact) that the\r\nstars in their courses were working for the continuance of her unfettered\r\nauthority, and that any trifling assistance which she might have given\r\nthem would not be too closely scrutinised.\r\n\r\nKuang Hsü’s reign was over; but his person (frail, melancholy tenement)\r\nremained, and Tzŭ Hsi was never enamoured of half measures or ambiguous\r\npositions. From the day when the pitiful monarch entered his pavilion\r\nprison on the “Ocean Terrace,” she began to make arrangements for his\r\n“mounting the Dragon” and “visiting the Nine Springs” in the orthodox\r\nclassical manner, and for providing the Throne with another occupant\r\nwhose youth, connections and docility would enable her to hold the\r\nRegency indefinitely. Nevertheless, because of the turbulent temper of\r\nthe southern provinces and possible manifestations of Europe’s curious\r\nsympathy with the Emperor’s Utopian dreams, she realised the necessity\r\nfor proceeding with caution and decorum. It was commonly reported\r\nthroughout the city in the beginning of October that the Emperor would\r\ndie with the end of the Chinese year.\r\n\r\nKuang Hsü was a prisoner in his Palace, doomed, as he well knew; yet must\r\nhe play the puppet Son of Heaven and perform each season’s appointed\r\nposturings. On the 8th day of the 8th Moon he appeared therefore, as\r\nordered by his attendants, and in the presence of his whole Court\r\nperformed the nine prostrations and other proper acts of obeisance before\r\nHer Majesty Tzŭ Hsi, in recognition of his own nonentity and her supreme\r\nauthority. In the afternoon, escorted by a strong detachment of Jung\r\nLu’s troops, he went from the Lake Palace to sacrifice at the Altar of\r\nthe Moon. Thus, pending the _coup-de-grâce_, the wretched Emperor went\r\nthrough the empty ceremonies of State ritual; high priest, that was\r\nhimself to be the next victim, how bitter must have been his thoughts as\r\nhe was borne back with Imperial pomp and circumstance to his lonely place\r\nof humiliation!\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi then settled down to her work of government, returning to it\r\nwith a zest by no means diminished by the years spent in retreat. And\r\nfirst she must justify the policy of reaction to herself, to her high\r\nofficials, and the world at large. She must get rid of offenders and\r\nsurround herself with men after her own heart.\r\n\r\nA few days after the Autumn festival and the Emperor’s melancholy\r\nexcursion, Her Majesty proceeded to remind the Imperial Clansmen that\r\ntheir position would not protect them against the consequences of\r\ndisloyalty; she was always much exercised (remembering the Tsai Yüan\r\nconspiracy) at any sign of intriguing amongst her Manchu kinsmen. In\r\nthis case her warning took the form of a Decree in which she sentenced\r\nthe “Beileh” Tsai Ch’u[57] to perpetual confinement in the “Empty\r\nChamber” of the Clan Court. Tsai Ch’u had had the audacity to sympathise\r\nwith the Emperor’s reform schemes; he had also had the bad luck to marry\r\none of Tzŭ Hsi’s nieces and to be upon the worst of terms with her.\r\nWhen therefore he advised the Emperor, in the beginning of the Hundred\r\nDays, to put a stop, once and for all, to the Old Buddha’s interference\r\nin State affairs, the “mean one of his inner chamber” did not fail to\r\nreport the fact to Her Majesty, and thus to enlist her sympathies and\r\nactivities, from the outset, on the side of the reactionaries.\r\n\r\nAt the time immediately following the _coup d’état_, public opinion\r\nat the Capital was divided as to the merits of the Emperor’s proposed\r\nreforms and the wisdom of their suppression, but the political instincts\r\nof the tribute-fed metropolis are, generally speaking, dormant, and what\r\nit chiefly respects is the energetic display of power. So that, on the\r\nwhole, sympathy was with the Old Buddha. She had, moreover, a Bismarckian\r\nway of guiding public opinion, of directing undercurrents of information\r\nthrough the eunuchs and tea-house gossip, in a manner calculated to\r\nappeal to the instincts of the _literati_ and the _bourgeois_; in the\r\npresent instance stress was laid on the Emperor’s lack of filial piety,\r\nas proved by his plotting against his aged and august aunt (a thing\r\nunpardonable in the eyes of the orthodox Confucianist), and on the fact\r\nthat he enjoyed the sympathy and support of foreigners—an argument\r\nsufficient to damn him in the eyes of even the most progressive Chinese.\r\nIt came, therefore, to be the generally accepted opinion that His\r\nMajesty had shown deplorable want of judgment and self-control, and\r\nthat the Empress Dowager was fully justified in resuming control of the\r\ngovernment. This opinion even came to be accepted and expressed by those\r\nLegations which had originally professed to see in the Emperor’s reforms\r\nthe dawn of a new era for China. So elastic is diplomacy in following\r\nthe line of the least resistance, so adroit (in the absence of a policy\r\nof its own) in accepting and condoning any _fait accompli_, that it\r\nwas not long before the official attitude of the Legations—including\r\nthe British—had come to deprecate the Emperor’s unfortunate haste in\r\nintroducing reforms, reforms which every foreigner in China had urged\r\nfor years, and which, accepted in principle by the Empress since 1900,\r\nhave again been welcomed as proof of China’s impending regeneration. In\r\nJune 1898, the British Minister had seen in the Emperor’s Reform Edicts\r\nproof that “the Court had at last thoroughly recognised a real need for\r\nradical reform.”[58] In October, when the Chief Reformer (K’ang Yu-wei)\r\nhad been saved from Tzŭ Hsi’s vengeance by the British Consul-General\r\nat Shanghai and conveyed by a British warship to the protection of a\r\nBritish Colony (under the mistaken impression that England would actively\r\nintervene in the cause of progress and on grounds of self-interest if not\r\nof humanity), we find the tide of expediency turned to recognition of\r\nthe fact that “the Empress Dowager and the Manchu party were seriously\r\nalarmed for their own safety, and looked upon the Reform movement as\r\ninimical to Manchu rule”![58] And two months later, influenced no doubt\r\nby the impending season of peace and good will, the Marquess of Salisbury\r\nis seriously informed by Sir Claude Macdonald that the wives of the\r\nforeign Representatives, seven in all, had been received in audience by\r\nthe Empress Dowager on the anniversary of her sixty-fourth birthday,\r\nand that Her Majesty “made a most favourable impression, both by the\r\npersonal interest she took in all her guests and by her courteous\r\namiability.”[58] On which occasion the puppet Emperor was exhibited, to\r\ncomply with the formalities, and was made to shake hands with all the\r\nladies. And so the curtain was rung down, and the Reform play ended, to\r\nthe satisfaction of all (or nearly all) concerned.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the British Minister and others, disturbed at the\r\npersistent rumours that “the Empress Dowager was about to proceed to\r\nextreme steps in regard to the Emperor,”[58] went so far as to warn\r\nthe Chinese Government against anything so disturbing to the European\r\nsense of fitness and decency. Foreign countries, the Yamên was told,\r\nwould view with displeasure and alarm his sudden demise. When the news\r\nof the British Minister’s intervention became known in the tea-houses\r\nand recorded in the Press, much indignation was expressed: this was a\r\npurely domestic question, for which precedents existed in plenty and in\r\nwhich foreigners’ advice was inadmissible. The Emperor’s acceptance of\r\nnew-fangled foreign ideas was a crime in the eyes of the Manchus, but his\r\nenlistment of foreign sympathy and support was hateful to Manchus and\r\nChinese alike.\r\n\r\nMatters soon settled down, however, into the old well-worn grooves,\r\nthe people satisfied and even glad in the knowledge that the Old\r\nBuddha was once more at the helm. In the capital the news had been\r\nsedulously spread—in order to prepare the way for the impending drama\r\nof expiation—that Kuang Hsü had planned to murder Her Majesty, and his\r\npresent punishment was therefore regarded as mild beyond his deserts.[59]\r\nScholars, composing essays appropriate to the occasion, freely compared\r\nHis Majesty to that Emperor of the Tang Dynasty (A.D. 762) who had\r\ninstigated the murdering of the Empress Dowager of his day. Kuang Hsü’s\r\ndeath was therefore freely predicted and its effects discounted; there\r\nis no doubt that it would have caused little or no comment in the north\r\nof China, however serious its consequences might have been in the south.\r\nThe public mind having been duly prepared, the Empress Dowager, in the\r\nname of the prospective victim, issued a Decree stating that the Son of\r\nHeaven was seriously ill; no surprise or apprehension was expressed, and\r\nthe sending of competent physicians from the provinces to attend His\r\nMajesty was recognised as a necessary concession to formalities. “Ever\r\nsince the 4th Moon,” said this Decree (_i.e._, since the beginning of the\r\nhundred days of reform), “I have been grievously ill; nor can I find any\r\nalleviation of my sickness.” It was the _pro formâ_ announcement of his\r\nimpending despatch, and as such it was received by the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nAmongst the doctors summoned to attend His Majesty was Ch’en Lien-fang,\r\nfor many years the most celebrated physician in China. The following\r\naccount of his experiences at the capital and the nature of his duties,\r\nwas supplied by himself at the time, to one of the writers, for\r\npublication in _The Times_.\r\n\r\n    “When the Edict was issued calling upon the provincial Viceroys\r\n    and Governors to send native doctors of distinction to Peking\r\n    to advise in regard to the Emperor’s illness, Chen Lien-fang\r\n    received orders from the Governor at Soochow to leave for the\r\n    north without delay. This in itself, apart from the uncongenial\r\n    and unremunerative nature of the duty (of which Ch’en was well\r\n    aware), was no light undertaking for a man of delicate physique\r\n    whose age was over three score years and ten; but there was no\r\n    possibility of evading the task. He according left his large\r\n    practice in the charge of two confidential assistants, or\r\n    pupils, and, having received from the Governor a sum of 6,000\r\n    taels for travelling expenses and remuneration in advance, made\r\n    his way to Peking and reported for duty to the Grand Council.\r\n    When he arrived there, he found three other native physicians\r\n    of considerable repute already in attendance, summoned in\r\n    obedience to the Imperial commands. Dr. Déthève, of the French\r\n    Legation, had already paid his historical visit to the Emperor,\r\n    and his remarkable diagnosis of the Son of Heaven’s symptoms\r\n    was still affording amusement to the Legations. The aged native\r\n    physician spoke in undisguised contempt both of the French\r\n    doctor’s comments on the case and of his suggestions for its\r\n    treatment. His own description of the Emperor’s malady was\r\n    couched in language not unlike that which writers of historical\r\n    novels attribute to the physicians of Europe in the Middle\r\n    Ages; he spoke reverently of influence and vapours at work in\r\n    the august person of his Sovereign, learnedly of heat-flushings\r\n    and their occult causes, and plainly of things which are more\r\n    suited to Chinese than to British readers. Nevertheless, his\r\n    description pointed clearly to disease of the respiratory\r\n    organs—which he said had existed for over twelve years—to\r\n    general debility, and to a feverish condition which he ascribed\r\n    to mental anxiety combined with physical weakness. Before he\r\n    left Peking (about the middle of November) the fever had abated\r\n    and the patient’s symptoms had decidedly improved; the case\r\n    was, however, in his opinion, of so serious a nature that he\r\n    decided to leave it, if possible, in the hands of his younger\r\n    _confrères_—an object which by dint of bribing certain Court\r\n    officials he eventually achieved. Asked if he considered the\r\n    Emperor’s condition critical, he replied oracularly that if he\r\n    lived to see the Chinese New Year his strength would thereafter\r\n    return gradually with the spring, and the complete restoration\r\n    of his health might be expected.\r\n\r\n    “Some few days after his arrival in Peking, Ch’en was summoned\r\n    to audience by orders conveyed through a member of the Grand\r\n    Council; the Emperor and the Dowager Empress were awaiting\r\n    his visit in a hall on the south side of the Palace. The\r\n    consultation was curiously indicative of the divinity which\r\n    hedges about the ruler of the Middle Kingdom; suggestive,\r\n    too, of the solidity of that conservatism which dictates\r\n    the inner policy of China. Ch’en entered the presence of\r\n    his Sovereign on his knees, crossing the apartment in that\r\n    position, after the customary kowtows. The Emperor and the\r\n    Dowager Empress were seated at opposite sides of a low table\r\n    on the daïs, and faced each other in that position during the\r\n    greater part of the interview. The Emperor appeared pale and\r\n    listless, had a troublesome irritation of the throat, and was\r\n    evidently feverish; the thin oval of his face, clearly defined\r\n    features, and aquiline nose gave him, in the physician’s eyes\r\n    (to use his own words), the appearance of a foreigner. The\r\n    Empress, who struck him as an extremely well-preserved and\r\n    intelligent-looking woman, seemed to be extremely solicitous\r\n    as to the patient’s health and careful for his comfort. As it\r\n    would have been a serious breach of etiquette for the physician\r\n    to ask any questions of His Majesty, the Empress proceeded to\r\n    describe his symptoms, the invalid occasionally signifying\r\n    confirmation of what was said by a word or a nod. During this\r\n    monologue, the physician, following the customary procedure at\r\n    Imperial audiences, kept his gaze concentrated upon the floor\r\n    until, at the command of the Empress, and still kneeling, he\r\n    was permitted to place one hand upon the Emperor’s wrist. There\r\n    was no feeling of the pulse; simply contact with the flat of\r\n    the hand, first on one side of the wrist and then on the other.\r\n    This done, the Empress continued her narrative of the patient’s\r\n    sufferings; she described the state of his tongue and the\r\n    symptoms of ulceration in the mouth and throat, but as it was\r\n    not permissible for the doctor to examine these, he was obliged\r\n    to make the best of a somewhat unprofessional description. As\r\n    he wisely observed, it is difficult to look at a patient’s\r\n    tongue when his exalted rank compels you to keep your eyes\r\n    fixed rigidly on the floor. The Empress having concluded\r\n    her remarks on the case, Ch’en was permitted to withdraw\r\n    and to present to the Grand Council his diagnosis, together\r\n    with advice as to future treatment, which was subsequently\r\n    communicated officially to the Throne. The gist of his advice\r\n    was to prescribe certain tonics of the orthodox native type\r\n    and to suggest the greatest possible amount of mental and\r\n    physical rest.”[60]\r\n\r\nThe aged physician’s oracular forecast was justified. The Emperor lived\r\nto see the New Year and thereafter to regain his strength, a result\r\ndue in some degree to the Empress Dowager’s genuine fear of foreign\r\nintervention, but chiefly to her recognition of the strength of public\r\nopinion against her in the south of China and of the expediency of\r\nconciliating it. In the Kuang provinces there was no doubt of the\r\nbitterly anti-Manchu feeling aroused by the execution of the Cantonese\r\nreformers: these turbulent southerners were fierce and loud in their\r\ndenunciations of the Manchus and all their works, and it would not have\r\nrequired much to fan the flames of a new and serious rebellion. The south\r\nwas well aware, for news travels swiftly in China, that the Emperor’s\r\nlife was in danger and that the close of the year was the time fixed for\r\nhis death, and from all sides protests and words of warning came pouring\r\nfrom the provinces to the capital, addressed not only to the metropolitan\r\nboards but to the Throne itself. Amongst these was a telegram signed by\r\na certain Prefect of Shanghai named Ching Yüan-shan, who, in the name of\r\n“all the gentry, scholars, merchants and public of Shanghai,” referred to\r\nthe Edict which announced the Emperor’s illness and implored the Empress,\r\nthe Clansmen and the Grand Council to permit his sacred Majesty to resume\r\nthe government “notwithstanding his indisposition,” and to abandon all\r\nthoughts of his abdication. He described the province of Kiangsu as being\r\nin a state of suppressed ferment and frankly alluded to the probability\r\nof foreigners intervening in the event of the Emperor’s death. Tzŭ Hsi\r\nwas much incensed with this courageous official, not because he actually\r\naccused her of premeditating murder, but because he dared threaten her\r\nwith its consequences. She gave orders that he be summarily cashiered,\r\nwhereupon, fearing further manifestations of her wrath, he fled to Macao.\r\nBut his bold words undoubtedly contributed to saving the Emperor’s life.\r\n\r\nOf all the high provincial authorities, one only was found brave and\r\ndisinterested enough to speak on behalf of the Emperor; this was Liu\r\nK’un-yi, the Viceroy of Nanking. He was too big a man to be publicly\r\nrebuked at a time like this and Tzŭ Hsi professed to admire his\r\ndisinterested courage; but she was highly incensed at his action, which\r\ncontrasted strongly with the astute opportunism of his colleague, the\r\nscholarly magnate Chang Chih-tung, Viceroy of Wuch’ang, who had been an\r\nardent advocate of the reformers so long as the wind blew fair in that\r\nquarter. Only six months before he had recommended several progressives\r\n(amongst them his own secretary, Yang Jui) to the Emperor’s notice, and\r\njust before the storm burst he had been summoned to Peking by Kuang\r\nHsü to support His Majesty’s policy as a member of the Grand Council.\r\nNo sooner had the Empress Dowager declared herself on the side of the\r\nreactionaries, however, and the Emperor had failed in his attempt to win\r\nover Yüan Shih-k’ai and his troops, than Chang telegraphed to the Old\r\nBuddha warmly approving her policy, and urging strong measures against\r\nthe reformers. The advice was superfluous; Tzŭ Hsi, having put her hand\r\nto the plough, was not the woman to remove it before her work was well\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th day of the 8th Moon, she summoned Jung Lu to the capital to\r\nassist her in stamping out the reform movement. The Board of Punishments\r\nhad just sent in a memorial urging the appointment of an Imperial\r\nCommission for the trial of K’ang Yu-wei’s colleagues. Tzŭ Hsi, in reply,\r\ndirected them to act in consultation with the Grand Council and to\r\ncross-examine the prisoners “with the utmost severity.” At the same time\r\nshe ordered the imprisonment in the Board’s gaol of Chang Yin-huan,[61]\r\nthe Emperor’s trusted adviser and friend who, she observed, “bears\r\nan abominable reputation.” This Edict took occasion to state that the\r\nThrone, anxious to temper justice with mercy, would refrain from any\r\ngeneral proscription or campaign of revenge, “although fully aware that\r\nmany prominent scholars and officials had allowed themselves to be\r\ncorrupted by the reformers.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress’s next step, advised by Jung Lu, was to issue a Decree, in\r\nthe name of the Emperor, in which she justified the policy of reaction\r\nand reassured the Conservative party. The document is an excellent\r\nexample of her methods. While the Emperor is made to appear as convinced\r\nof the error of his ways, all blame for the “feelings of apprehension”\r\ncreated by the reform movement is relegated to “our officials’ failure to\r\ngive effect to our orders in the proper way,” so that everybody’s “face”\r\nis saved. The following abridged translation is of permanent interest,\r\nfor the same arguments are in use to-day and will undoubtedly be required\r\nhereafter, when the Manchus come to deal with the impending problems of\r\nConstitutional Government:—\r\n\r\n    “The original object of the Throne in introducing reforms\r\n    in the administration of the government was to increase the\r\n    strength of our Empire and to ameliorate the condition of our\r\n    subjects. It was no sudden whim for change, nor any contempt\r\n    for tradition that actuated us; surely our subjects must\r\n    recognise that our action was fully justifiable and indeed\r\n    inevitable. Nevertheless, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact\r\n    that feelings of apprehension have been aroused, entirely\r\n    due to the failure of our officials to give effect to our\r\n    orders in the proper way, and that this again has led to the\r\n    dissemination of wild rumours and wrong ideas amongst the\r\n    ignorant masses of the people. For instance, when we abolished\r\n    six superfluous government boards, we did so in the public\r\n    interest, but the immediate result has been that we have been\r\n    plagued with Memorials suggesting that we should destroy and\r\n    reconstruct the whole system of administration. It is evident\r\n    that, unless we explain our policy as a whole, great danger\r\n    may arise from the spread of such ideas, and to prevent\r\n    any such result we now command that the six metropolitan\r\n    departments which we previously abolished be re-established\r\n    exactly as before. Again, our original intention in authorising\r\n    the establishment of official newspapers, and allowing all\r\n    and sundry of our subjects to address us, was to encourage\r\n    the spread of knowledge and to improve our own sources of\r\n    intelligence. Unfortunately, however, the right of addressing\r\n    the Throne has been greatly abused, and the suggestions which\r\n    have reached us in this way have not only been trivial and\r\n    useless on many occasions, but have recently shown a tendency\r\n    towards revolutionary propaganda. For this reason the right\r\n    to memorialise the Throne will in future be strictly reserved\r\n    in accordance with the established and ancient custom. As for\r\n    official newspapers, we have come to the conclusion that they\r\n    are quite useless for any purposes of the government, and\r\n    that they only lead to popular discontent; they are therefore\r\n    abolished from this day forth. The proper training grounds for\r\n    national industry and talent are Colleges, and these are to go\r\n    on as before, it being the business of the local officials,\r\n    acting upon public opinion in their respective districts, to\r\n    continue the improvement of education on the lines laid down;\r\n    but there is to be no conversion of temples and shrines into\r\n    schools, as was previously ordered, because this might lead to\r\n    strong objection on the part of the people. Generally speaking,\r\n    there shall be no measures taken contrary to the established\r\n    order of things throughout the Empire. The times are critical,\r\n    and it behoves us, therefore, to follow in government matters\r\n    the happy mean and to avoid all extreme measures and abuses.\r\n    It is our duty, without prejudice, to steer a middle course,\r\n    and it is for you, our officials, to aim at permanence and\r\n    stability of administration in every branch of the government.”\r\n\r\nJung Lu was now raised to membership of the Grand Council, and given\r\nsupreme command of the northern forces and control of the Board of\r\nWar; he thus became the most powerful official in the Empire, holding\r\na position for which no precedent existed in the annals of the Manchu\r\nDynasty. He had once more proved loyal to the Empress and faithful to\r\nthe woman whom he had served since the days of the flight to Jehol; and\r\nhe had his reward. It was natural, if not inevitable, that the part\r\nplayed by Jung Lu in the crisis of the _coup d’état_ should expose him\r\nto severe criticism, especially abroad; but, from the Chinese official’s\r\npoint of view, his action in supporting the Empress Dowager against her\r\nnephew, the Emperor, was nothing more than his duty, and as a statesman\r\nhe showed himself consistently moderate, sensible, and reliable. The\r\ndenunciations subsequently poured upon him by the native and foreign\r\nPress at the time of the Boxer rising were the result, partly of the\r\nunrefuted falsehoods disseminated by K’ang Yu-wei and his followers,\r\nand partly of the Legations’ prejudice (thence arising) and lack of\r\naccurate information. As will hereafter be shown, all his efforts\r\nwere directed towards stemming the tide of that fanatical outbreak\r\nand restraining his Imperial mistress from acts of folly. Amidst the\r\ncowardice, ignorance and cruelty of the Manchu Clansmen his foresight and\r\ncourage stand out steadily in welcome relief; the only servant of the\r\nThrone during Tzŭ Hsi’s long rule who approaches him in administrative\r\nability and disinterested patriotism is Tseng Kuo-fan (of whose career\r\na brief account has already been given). From this time forward until\r\nhis death (1903) we find him ever at Tzŭ Hsi’s right hand, her most\r\ntrusted and efficient adviser; and her choice was well made. As will be\r\nseen in a later chapter, there was a time in 1900, when the Old Buddha,\r\ndistraught by the tumult and the shouting, misled by her own hopes, her\r\nsuperstitious beliefs and the clamorous advice of her kinsfolk, allowed\r\nPrince Tuan and his fellow fanatics to undermine for a little while Jung\r\nLu’s influence. Nevertheless (as will be seen by the diary of Ching Shan)\r\nit was to him that she always turned, in the last resort, for counsel\r\nand comfort; it was on him that she leaned in the dark hour of final\r\ndefeat,—and he never failed her. She lived to realise that the advice\r\nwhich he gave, and which she sometimes neglected, was invariably sound.\r\nAmidst all the uncertainties of recent Chinese history this much is\r\ncertain, that the memory of Jung Lu deserves a far higher place in the\r\nesteem of his countrymen and of foreigners than it has hitherto received.\r\nUnaware himself of many of the calumnies that had been circulated about\r\nhim at the time of the Court’s flight, he was greatly hurt, and his sense\r\nof justice outraged, by the cold reception given him by the Legations\r\nafter the Court’s return to Peking. Thereafter, until his death, he was\r\nwont to say to his intimate friends that while he would never regret the\r\nstand he had taken against the Boxers, he could not understand or forgive\r\nthe hostility and ingratitude shown him by foreigners. “It was not for\r\nlove towards them,” he observed, on one occasion recorded, “that he had\r\nacted as he did, but only because of his devotion to the Empress Dowager\r\nand the Manchu Dynasty; nevertheless, since his action had coincided with\r\nthe interests of the foreigner, he was entitled to some credit for it.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress Dowager consulted long and earnestly with Jung Lu as\r\nto the punishment to be inflicted upon the reformers. He advocated\r\nstrong measures of repression, holding that the prestige of the Manchu\r\nDynasty was involved. The six prisoners were examined by the Board of\r\nPunishments, and Jung Lu closely questioned them as to K’ang Yu-wei’s\r\nintentions in regard to the Empress Dowager. Documents found in K’ang’s\r\nhouse had revealed every detail of the plot, and upon the Grand Council\r\nrecommended the execution of all the prisoners. There being no doubt\r\nthat they had been guilty of high treason against Her Majesty, it seemed\r\nclearly inadvisable to prolong the trial, especially as there was\r\nundoubtedly a risk of widening the breach between Manchus and Chinese by\r\nany delay in the proceedings, at a time when party spirit was running\r\nhigh on both sides. The Old Buddha concurred in the decision of the\r\nGrand Council, desiring to terminate the crisis as soon as possible;\r\naccordingly, on the 13th day of the Moon, the reformers were executed.\r\nThey met their death bravely, their execution outside the city being\r\nwitnessed by an immense crowd. It was reported that amongst the papers\r\nof Yang Jui were found certain highly compromising letters addressed to\r\nhim by the Emperor himself, in which the Empress Dowager was bitterly\r\ndenounced. There was also a Memorial by Yang impeaching Her Majesty for\r\ngross immorality and illicit relations with several persons in high\r\npositions, one of whom was Jung Lu; this document had been annotated in\r\nred ink by the Emperor himself. It quoted songs and ballads current in\r\nthe city of Canton, referring to Her Majesty’s alleged vicious practices,\r\nand warned the Emperor that, if the Manchu dynasty should come now to\r\nits end, the fault would lie as much with Tzŭ Hsi and her evil deeds as\r\nwas the case when the Shang dynasty (of the 12th Century B.C.) fell by\r\nreason of the Emperor Chou Hsin’s infatuation for his concubine Ta Chi,\r\nwhose orgies are recorded in history. Yang Jui had compared the Empress\r\nDowager’s life at the Summer Palace with the enormities committed by this\r\ninfamous concubine in her palace by the “Lake of Wine”; small wonder\r\nthen, said Tzŭ Hsi’s advocates in defence of drastic measures, that,\r\nhaving seen for herself, in the Emperor’s own handwriting, that these\r\ntreasonable utterances met with his favour and support, Her Majesty was\r\nvindictively inclined and determined to put an end, once and for all, to\r\nhis relations with the Reform party.\r\n\r\nThe edict which ordered the execution of the Reform leaders was drafted\r\nby the Empress Dowager herself with the aid of Jung Lu, but with cynical\r\nirony it was issued in the name of the Emperor. It was written in red\r\nink as an indication of its special importance, a formality usually\r\nreserved for decrees given by the Sovereign under his own hand. After\r\nlaying stress upon the necessity for introducing reforms in the country’s\r\nadministration, and on the anxiety felt by the Throne in regard to the\r\nincreasing difficulties of government, this Decree proceeded to state\r\nthat K’ang Yu-wei and his followers, taking advantage of the necessities\r\nof the moment, had entered into a rebellious conspiracy, aiming at the\r\noverthrow of the Throne itself; fortunately, their treacherous intentions\r\nhad been disclosed, and the whole plot revealed. The Decree continued as\r\nfollowed:—\r\n\r\n    “We are further informed that, greatly daring, these traitors\r\n    have organised a secret Society, the objects of which are to\r\n    overthrow the Manchu dynasty for the benefit of the Chinese.\r\n    Following the precepts of the Sages, We, the Emperor, are\r\n    in duty bound to propagate filial piety as the foremost of\r\n    all virtues, and have always done so, as our subjects must\r\n    be fully aware. But the writings of K’ang Yu-wei were, in\r\n    their tendency, depraved and immoral; they contain nothing\r\n    but abominable doctrines intended to flout and destroy the\r\n    doctrines of the Sages. Originally impressed by his knowledge\r\n    of contemporary politics, we appointed him to be a Secretary\r\n    of the Tsungli Yamên, and subsequently gave him charge of the\r\n    establishment of the proposed official newspaper at Shanghai;\r\n    but instead of going to his post, he remained for the purposes\r\n    of his evil conspiracies at Peking. Had it not been that,\r\n    by the protecting influences of our ancestors, his plot was\r\n    revealed, appalling disasters must undoubtedly have followed.\r\n    K’ang himself, the moving spirit in this conspiracy, has\r\n    fled from justice, and we rely upon the proper authorities to\r\n    see to it that he be arrested, and that capital punishment be\r\n    inflicted upon him.”\r\n\r\nThe Decree then proceeded to award the death penalty to K’ang Yu-wei’s\r\ncolleague, Liang Ch’i-ch’ao, a scholar of the highest repute, who\r\nsubsequently found a refuge in Japan, and there edits a newspaper of\r\nhigh and well-deserved reputation. Next in order of importance were the\r\nthree Secretaries of the Grand Council, who were awaiting the result of\r\ntheir trial in the Board of Punishments. The Edict added that any delay\r\nin their execution might, in the opinion of the Grand Council, lead to\r\na revolutionary movement, and for this reason further formalities of\r\njustice in regard to all six prisoners were dispensed with, and their\r\nsummary decapitation ordered.\r\n\r\nAfter disposing of K’ang Yu-wei’s followers and accomplices, the Decree\r\nonce more emphasises the heinous guilt of their leader:—\r\n\r\n    “Our dynasty,” it says, “rules in accordance with the teachings\r\n    of Confucius. Such treason as that of K’ang Yu-wei is abhorred\r\n    by gods and men alike. Surely the elemental forces of nature\r\n    must refuse to protect such a man,[62] surely all humanity must\r\n    unite in the extermination of such noisome creatures. As to\r\n    those of his followers who, for the most part, were led away by\r\n    his immoral doctrines, their number is legion, and the Throne\r\n    has taken note of their names, but the Imperial clemency is\r\n    all-abounding, and we have decided to go no further with our\r\n    enquiries into these treasonable plottings. Let all concerned\r\n    now take warning by K’ang’s example. Let them conscientiously\r\n    follow the doctrines of the Sages, and turn their hearts to\r\n    wisdom in devotion to the Throne.”\r\n\r\nDespite the Throne’s “all abounding clemency” and Tzŭ Hsi’s declared\r\nintention to take no steps beyond the execution of the six reform\r\nleaders, her “divine wrath” continued to be stirred up by the\r\nrecollection of the personal attacks that had been made against her.\r\nFollowing immediately upon the Decree above quoted, came another whereby\r\nChang Yin-huan was sentenced to banishment to the New Dominion on a\r\nvague charge of the usual classical type. His real offence lay in that\r\nhe had denounced the Empress Dowager for extravagance, and she was the\r\nmore embittered against him because the British Minister had presumed to\r\nintervene with a plea for his life.\r\n\r\nIn another Decree the proposed visit to Tientsin was cancelled, at the\r\nearnest request of Jung Lu, who dreaded the possibility of an attempt\r\non the life of the Empress Dowager. Her feminine curiosity had been\r\nstirred by the prospect of a visit to the Treaty port and a change\r\nfrom the seclusion of Peking, but she yielded to the advice of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. At the same time military reorganisation was pressed\r\nforward with the greatest energy, and the occasion was taken to bestow\r\n_largesse_ on the Chihli troops.\r\n\r\nUpon Jung Lu coming to Peking Yü Lu was appointed to succeed him as\r\nViceroy of Chihli. This bigoted official enjoyed in a large measure\r\nthe confidence of the Empress Dowager. Unusually ignorant, even for a\r\nManchu, and totally devoid of ability, he was subsequently responsible\r\nfor the growth of the Boxer movement in and around Tientsin. At this\r\nparticular crisis, however, distrust of the Chinese was rife, and the\r\nOld Buddha felt that the presence of a Manchu Viceroy to control the\r\nMetropolitan Province was necessary to prevent any organised movement by\r\nthe revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nThere now remained unpunished in Peking only one high official who\r\nhad been in any way publicly associated with the reformers, _i.e._,\r\nLi Tuan-fen, President of the Board of Ceremonies. After waiting a\r\nfew days and finding that his case was not referred to in any of the\r\nEdicts, he applied in a Memorial to the Throne that the offence which\r\nhe had committed (in recommending K’ang Yu-wei and other reformers\r\nfor government employment) should be suitably punished. The Memorial\r\nis in itself a most interesting document, as it throws light on\r\nseveral characteristic features of the internal economy of the Chinese\r\nGovernment. The writer, after admitting his guilt, and expressing\r\nastonishment that it has not been brought home to him, placed on record\r\nhis gratitude for the clemency thus far exercised, and asked that, as his\r\nconscience gave him no peace, Her Majesty might be pleased to determine\r\nthe penalty for his guilt, “to serve as a warning to all officials who\r\nmay be led to recommend evil characters to the notice of the Throne.” Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s reply was equally interesting, and was issued, as usual, in the\r\nname of the Emperor:—\r\n\r\n    “We have read the Memorial of Li Tuan-fen. This official\r\n    has enjoyed our special favour; nevertheless, it was he who\r\n    recommended to our notice that base traitor, K’ang Yu-wei, and\r\n    he repeated his recommendations at more than one subsequent\r\n    audience. His present action in admitting his guilt after\r\n    the conspiracy has been exposed indicates a certain amount\r\n    of low cunning on his part, which makes it quite impossible\r\n    for us to treat him with further leniency. He is therefore\r\n    to be cashiered forthwith and banished to the New Dominion,\r\n    where he will be kept under close observation by the local\r\n    authorities.”[63]\r\n\r\nThe whole episode and correspondence are strongly suggestive of the sport\r\nof a cat with a mouse.\r\n\r\nBy this time the violent measures of the reactionary party had aroused\r\na storm of indignation in the South, where societies were being\r\norganised in support of His Majesty Kuang-Hsü. Newspapers published\r\nin the foreign settlements at Shanghai repeated daily the wildest and\r\nbitterest denunciations against Her Majesty and Jung Lu, the latter\r\nbeing specially singled out for attack. The writers of these articles,\r\nevidently inspired by the fugitive reform leaders, declared that the\r\nmovement in Peking was essentially anti-Chinese, and that it would\r\nundoubtedly end in the appointment of Manchus to all important posts in\r\nthe Empire. On the other hand, anti-foreign disturbances were fomented\r\nin several provinces by those who believed that the Empress Dowager\r\nwould be gratified by these manifestations of public feeling. This\r\nstate of affairs was undoubtedly fraught with serious danger, to which\r\nthe attention of the Empress Dowager was drawn in a very plain-spoken\r\nMemorial by a Censor and Imperial Clansman named Hui Chang.\r\n\r\nThe memorialist congratulated the Throne upon the energetic and\r\nsuccessful suppression of K’ang Yu-wei’s treason, an achievement which\r\nwould redound for ever to the fame of the Old Buddha. He then referred to\r\nthe position of affairs in South China as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Of late many rumours have been in circulation, due to the\r\n    fact that the criminals executed by order of the Throne are\r\n    all Chinese, and your Majesties are therefore accused of\r\n    desiring to promote the interests of Manchus at the expense of\r\n    your Chinese subjects. Although it should be well known and\r\n    recognised that our dynasty has never held the balance unevenly\r\n    between Manchus and Chinese, yet the followers of K’ang Yu-wei\r\n    are undoubtedly taking advantage of these rumours, and the\r\n    result threatens the State with danger.”\r\n\r\nThe writer, after referring to the general futility of Edicts, then\r\nadvised that special honours should be accorded to a few selected Chinese\r\nof undoubted loyalty and orthodoxy, by which means public opinion would\r\nbe reassured. He justly observed that, if those who had been guilty of\r\nhigh treason had been made to suffer the penalty, those who had been\r\nconsistently loyal should be suitably rewarded. He advised that all those\r\nwho, during the past few months, had sent in Memorials denouncing the\r\nreform movement and rebuking the corrupt tendencies of the so-called new\r\nscholarship, should be advanced in the public service. Finally, he made\r\nthe significant observation, that loyalty and patriotism when displayed\r\nby Chinese subjects are of greater value to the integrity of the Empire\r\nthan these virtues when displayed by Manchus, an indication of statecraft\r\nlikely to appeal to the acute intelligence of the Old Buddha. The Empress\r\nDowager’s reply, while ostensibly in the nature of a rebuke, was marked\r\nby unusual evasiveness on the subject actually at issue. She laid stress\r\nonly on the strict impartiality of the Throne’s decision, professing to\r\nbe animated by feelings of abstract justice, and to be free from all\r\nmanner of prejudice, whether against Manchus or Chinese. The Memorialist\r\nwas, however, shortly afterwards promoted, and as a proof of her\r\nimpartiality, the Empress Dowager proceeded, on the same day, to dismiss\r\nhalf-a-dozen high officials, one of whom was a Manchu; and on the ground\r\nthat Jung Lu himself had recommended one of the reformers for employment,\r\nshe ordered that he too be referred to the Board of Civil Appointments\r\nfor the determination of a suitable penalty. This was merely “saving\r\nface.”\r\n\r\nStirred, as usual, to activity by anything in the nature of criticism,\r\nHer Majesty now issued Decrees in rapid succession. One of these declared\r\nthe necessity for adequate protection of foreigners in the interior\r\nand for the Legations in Peking; another took the form of a homily to\r\nthe Provincial Authorities in regard to the selection of subordinate\r\nofficials. A third called for advice from the Provincial Viceroys and\r\nGovernors, but they were told, at the same time, to avoid criticising on\r\nparty grounds because “the Throne was fully aware of the motives which\r\nusually inspire such attacks.”\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the Empress Dowager took occasion in a homily on the whole\r\nart of government, to place on record a defence of her policy as head of\r\nthe Manchus in China. The following extract from this Decree is worth\r\nquoting:—\r\n\r\n    “The test of good government has always been the absence\r\n    of rebellion; a State which takes adequate measures for\r\n    self-defence can never be in serious danger. By the accumulated\r\n    wisdom of six successive Sovereigns, our dynasty has succeeded\r\n    in establishing a system of government, based on absolute\r\n    justice and benevolence, which approaches very nearly to\r\n    perfection. It has been our pleasure to grant immediate relief\r\n    in times of flood and famine. When rivers burst their banks,\r\n    our first thought has ever been the safety of our people.\r\n    Never have we resorted to conscription, or to the levying\r\n    of _corvées_. We have always excluded Chinese women from\r\n    service as subordinates in the Palace. Surely such evidences\r\n    of benevolent solicitude merit the hearty co-operation of all\r\n    our subjects, and entitle us to expect that all our people,\r\n    high and low, should peacefully pursue their business in life,\r\n    so that all men, even the humblest labourers, may enjoy the\r\n    blessings of peace. Is it any wonder then, that our soul is\r\n    vexed when abominable treachery and the preaching of rebellion\r\n    have been permitted to exist and to be spread broad-cast; when\r\n    high officials, lacking all proper principles, have dared to\r\n    recommend traitors to the Throne, in furtherance of their own\r\n    evil designs? When we think of these things, our righteous\r\n    indignation almost overwhelms us; nevertheless, we have granted\r\n    a general amnesty, and will enquire no further into these base\r\n    plottings.”\r\n\r\nThe Decree concluded with the usual exhortation to the official class,\r\nand an appeal for the exercise of ideal virtue.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty’s next step was to reinstate certain leading reactionaries,\r\nwhom the Emperor had recently dismissed, notably Hsü Ying-kuei, who had\r\ndenounced the reformer Wang Chao. The Emperor’s party was now completely\r\nbroken up, and he was left without supporters or friends in Peking. The\r\nManchu Treasurer of Kansuh (Tseng Ho) was the last high official to\r\nspeak in favour of the reform movement, or rather of one of its chief\r\nadvocates, and, by so doing, to bring down upon him the wrath of the\r\nOld Buddha. The Memorial which brought about his summary dismissal from\r\noffice, never again to be re-employed, referred in terms of regret to the\r\ndisgrace of Weng T’ung-ho, the Emperor’s tutor.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty next turned her attention to the provinces, and administered\r\na severe rebuke to Liu K’un-yi, who, on grounds of ill-health, had asked\r\nto be relieved of the Nanking Viceroyalty. Her Majesty, reminding him in\r\nthe classical phraseology of the high favours showered upon him by the\r\nThrone, directed him to abstain from frivolous excuses and to continue\r\nin the performance of his duties, exercising more diligence therein, and\r\nmore care in his selection of subordinate officials.\r\n\r\nThe audacity of Weng T’ung-ho continued to rankle sorely in Her Majesty’s\r\nmind, and to allow him to continue to live in honourable retirement in\r\nhis native place without loss of rank or other punishment was not in\r\naccordance with her ideas of fitness; nor was it likely that Jung Lu, who\r\nhad always borne a grudge against the Imperial tutor, would do anything\r\nto mitigate her wrath against him. In a Decree, issued in the name of\r\nthe Emperor, she once more vented her spite on this aged and inoffensive\r\nscholar, in a manner highly characteristic of her temperament. The Edict\r\nis sufficiently interesting to justify the following quotation:—\r\n\r\n    “When Weng T’ung-ho acted as our Imperial tutor, his method\r\n    of instruction left much to be desired; he never succeeded\r\n    in explaining the inner meaning of classical or historical\r\n    subjects, but would spend his time endeavouring to gain our\r\n    favour and distract our attention by showing us curios and\r\n    pictures. He would endeavour also to ascertain our views on\r\n    current events and matters of policy by discussing questions\r\n    of general contemporary interest. During the war with Japan,\r\n    for instance, he would at one time profess to advocate peace,\r\n    and again he would be all for war, and finally he even advised\r\n    us to flee from our capital. He had a habit of exaggerating\r\n    facts in order to make them coincide with his own views, and\r\n    the result of the foolish and wrongful performance of his\r\n    duties is now to be seen in a situation almost irreparable. In\r\n    the spring of last year he was all in favour of reform, and\r\n    secretly recommended to us K’ang Yu-wei as a man whose ability,\r\n    he said, exceeded his own one hundred fold. We, being anxious\r\n    above all things to strengthen our Empire at a time of national\r\n    danger, reluctantly yielded to K’ang Yu-wei’s advice in regard\r\n    to reform. He, however, took advantage of our complaisance to\r\n    plot treason. For this Weng T’ung-ho is primarily to blame,\r\n    and his guilt is too great to be overlooked. Besides this,\r\n    he has incurred our displeasure in several other ways; for\r\n    instance, he would allow himself to show annoyance if we\r\n    disagreed with his recommendations, and would even attempt to\r\n    browbeat us. At such times his language was most improper, and\r\n    the recollection of his bullying propensities remains in our\r\n    mind most unpleasantly. In a previous Decree we ordered him to\r\n    vacate his post and return to his native place, but for his\r\n    many offences this in itself is no adequate punishment. We now\r\n    order that he be cashiered, never again to be re-employed, and\r\n    that henceforth he be held under close supervision of the local\r\n    authorities and prohibited from creating trouble, as a warning\r\n    to all double-minded officials for the future.”[64]\r\n\r\nWeng T’ung-ho lived in his family home (Chang Shu in Kiangsu) until June,\r\n1904, beloved and respected by all who knew him. He was by no means a\r\nnonentity like most of the aged officials near the Throne, but rather a\r\nperson of considerable force of character, and after his dismissal lived\r\nalways in the hope that he might yet return to serve the Emperor and the\r\ncause of reform upon the death of the Old Buddha. Meanwhile, he became a\r\nsource of considerable trouble and anxiety to the District Magistrate\r\nof his native place, as he made it his practice to call on that official\r\nthree times a month, and, in the guise of a suppliant, to address him,\r\nthus, on his knees: “You have orders from the Throne secretly to keep\r\nwatch over my conduct, and I therefore now attend, as in duty bound, to\r\nassist you in carrying out these orders.” As the Magistrate could never\r\nbe certain that the once all-powerful Grand Secretary might not return to\r\npower, his own position was evidently one of considerable embarrassment,\r\nespecially as the Weng family was the most important of the whole\r\nneighbourhood. In the intervals of baiting local officials, the Grand\r\nSecretary spent his time in scholarly retirement, and a volume of the\r\nletters written by him at this period has since been published; they show\r\nthe man in a most attractive light, as a scholar and a poet; his light\r\nand easy style, combined with a tendency to mysticism and philosophic\r\nspeculation, has always been highly appreciated by the _literati_. As his\r\nfortune had not been taken from him, his old age was probably happier\r\nin his native place than had it been exposed to the intrigues and hard\r\nwork of official life at the Capital; and he died in the enjoyment of a\r\nreputation for patriotism and intelligence which extended far beyond his\r\nnative province, and which, since his death, has greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Dowager, realising that the loyalty of the _literati_\r\nhad been greatly shaken by the Emperor’s abolition of the old system\r\nof classical studies and public examinations, proceeded to reverse\r\nHis Majesty’s decision in a Decree which thoroughly delighted the\r\nConservative Party. Scholars throughout the country praised it in\r\nunmeasured terms, as a striking example of the Old Buddha’s acute\r\nreasoning powers. To a certain extent it may be admitted that the new\r\nsystem of examinations introduced by the Emperor had led, at the outset,\r\nto abuses which were absent under the old classical system, where the\r\nanonymity of candidates was a cardinal principle. Her Majesty dealt with\r\nthe question as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The ancient system whereby our Dynasty has selected the\r\n    scholars at public examinations by means of essays taken from\r\n    the Four Books, is based on the principle that the foundation\r\n    of all education lies in expounding the fundamental doctrines\r\n    of our national Sages and the Standard Commentaries on the\r\n    Confucian doctrine. For over two centuries this system has\r\n    worked most satisfactorily, and it is only quite lately that\r\n    certain meretricious tendencies have sprung up in connection\r\n    therewith, and that candidates at these examinations have\r\n    succeeded in obtaining degrees by the use of parrot-like\r\n    repetitions and empty catch-words. The fault has been wrongly\r\n    attributed to the system; it is in reality due to incapable\r\n    examiners, who have allowed these abuses to creep in. Critics\r\n    have failed to realise the truth in this matter, and have\r\n    allowed themselves to abuse the system, going as far as to\r\n    assert that the classical subjects in themselves are of no\r\n    practical value. They forget that the classical essays set\r\n    at these examinations are merely a first stage, a test for\r\n    entrance upon an official career, and that, if the candidate\r\n    is really a man of ability, the fact that he has been made to\r\n    compose verses in accordance with the time-honoured methods\r\n    of the T’ang and Sung dynasties will never prevent him from\r\n    making his way in the world. But should he be a man in whom\r\n    there exists already a tendency towards rash and unorthodox\r\n    principles, it may safely be said that to set him essays on\r\n    subjects of contemporary interest for the purposes of this\r\n    examination would only serve to aggravate the evil and further\r\n    to demoralise his nature. For these reasons, therefore, I now\r\n    definitely decree that, for the future, the old system shall\r\n    be restored, and that public examinations shall henceforward\r\n    consist of themes and extracts from the Classics. A special\r\n    examination for students of political economy, lately\r\n    authorised, has been shown to be productive of evil, and is\r\n    therefore abolished. It is the wish of the Throne that these\r\n    public examinations shall be in reality a sound test of merit.\r\n    Examiners and candidates alike should avoid meretricious\r\n    adornments of style, and endeavour to conform strictly to\r\n    the classical models. We desire, of course, that studies of\r\n    a practical nature should be continued, but these had best\r\n    be conducted under the guidance of local officials. It is\r\n    certainly desirable that agriculture, and the promotion of\r\n    industrial and commercial enterprises, should be placed on a\r\n    more effective basis of organisation, but owing to difficulties\r\n    of inter-communication and voluminous correspondence, it is\r\n    inadvisable that these matters should be centralised at Peking.\r\n    Let Bureaux be established at the various provincial capitals,\r\n    and let a beginning be made at Tientsin, as a test case and an\r\n    example for the rest of the Empire. The Peking Bureau is hereby\r\n    abolished.”\r\n\r\n_Souvent femme varie_, and the mind of Tzŭ Hsi never ran consistently for\r\nlong in the same groove. Anxious always as to her popularity with all\r\nparties in the State, and with a view to adjusting that nice equilibrium\r\nof conflicting forces which constituted the pride of her statecraft and\r\nthe strength of her rule, we find her next issuing a Decree which set\r\nforth the principles by which she professed to be guided. This Decree\r\nreflects a certain amount of anxiety and a doubt as to whether the\r\npunishment inflicted on the leading reformers might not be severely\r\ncriticised by the outside world. Her Majesty therefore decrees:—\r\n\r\n    “From times of remote antiquity it has always been recognised\r\n    that the perfect Government is that which is based on\r\n    consistent maintenance of the doctrines of the Sages, but, in\r\n    practice, the exigencies of any particular crisis must always\r\n    justify modification of these principles, so that there can be\r\n    no such thing as final and absolute adherence to any particular\r\n    principle or method. Recently there have been introduced\r\n    certain energetic measures of reform intended to put an end to\r\n    the many and increasing abuses which admittedly exist all over\r\n    the Empire; but certain evil-disposed persons have made these\r\n    reforms the excuse for a revolutionary movement. These we have\r\n    punished, so that the flood of treason and rebellion has been\r\n    stemmed. This does not mean, however, that we shall fail to\r\n    initiate and enforce all such measures, whether of a liberal\r\n    or conservative nature, as may be necessary in the interest\r\n    and for the welfare of our subjects. Was ever any man deterred\r\n    from eating for fear lest a mouthful should choke him? There\r\n    can surely be no real misapprehension in the public mind in the\r\n    face of all the Decrees which we have issued on this subject,\r\n    but we regret to note a marked lack of coherent opinion on the\r\n    subject amongst our official advisers, for, at the time when\r\n    these treasonable schemes were rife, we received scarcely any\r\n    Memorials alluding to this national danger, and no suggestions\r\n    for meeting it. It was only when the plot had been discovered\r\n    and suppressed that certain attempts were made to acquire\r\n    merit by those who thought they had fathomed the motives which\r\n    had actuated our action. These misguided persons overlooked\r\n    the important fact that it is the public interest, and the\r\n    public interest only, which guides the policy of the Throne in\r\n    matters of administration. The path we pursue is that of the\r\n    just mean, diverging neither to right nor left. Once more would\r\n    we admonish you, our officials throughout the Empire, bidding\r\n    you purify your hearts and get rid, once and for all, of these\r\n    false distinctions between reaction and reform. Let your\r\n    Memorials consider only the needs of each day and each case as\r\n    they come, and cease to submit haphazard schemes on the chance\r\n    of their meeting with our personal approval.”\r\n\r\nHer Majesty next turned her attention to the necessities and distressing\r\ncondition of her people at large, and ordered that measures should once\r\nmore be taken to prevent the constant destruction of life and property\r\nby the Yellow River in Shantung Province. She was under no delusion\r\nas to the nature of the measures taken in the part to remedy “China’s\r\nSorrow” which, from time immemorial has been the happy hunting ground\r\nof peculating officialdom; nor could she expect that her stereotyped\r\nexhortations to virtue in this matter would afford her subjects any\r\nparticular gratification. Her Majesty alluded to the fact that “frequent\r\nrepairs to the banks of the Yellow River had not appeared to produce\r\nany permanent results,” but the remedy which she applied, viz., a\r\nconsultation between the Grand Council and the various Ministries with\r\nthe Censorate, was not very reassuring. Nor was her subsequent decision\r\nto send Li Hung-chang, to estimate on the spot the sum required for the\r\nconstruction of effective river conservancy works, calculated to convince\r\nthe public of the sincerity of her benevolent intentions.\r\n\r\nAs in the days immediately following her first assumption of power after\r\nthe overthrow of the Tsai Yüan conspiracy in 1861, the Empress Dowager\r\nat this period displayed remarkable activity in every direction, as is\r\nshown by the number of her Decrees at this period. After dealing with the\r\nYellow River, she turned her attention to another permanent and crying\r\nevil, which for centuries has weighed heavily upon the lower classes of\r\nthe Chinese people, viz., the interminable delay and heavy cost of legal\r\nproceedings and the hardships thus inflicted on all who may be compelled\r\nto seek justice at the hands of Chinese officials.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, in her Edict on the subject, showed a very close knowledge\r\nof the abuses with which, indeed, all Chinese are fully acquainted,\r\nbut which official documents usually ignore. It is no doubt largely to\r\nher frankness in cases of this kind that the Old Buddha’s widespread\r\nreputation for good nature and tender-heartedness may be ascribed.\r\nThroughout the country, but especially in the north, it has always\r\nbeen the opinion of the peasantry and of the merchant class, that the\r\nOld Buddha was, if anything, too tender-hearted, and that her extreme\r\nmildness of disposition, though no doubt laudable, was on many occasions\r\na source of danger. To her untimely “benevolence” the populace in Peking\r\nin 1900 undoubtedly ascribed the fact that the foreigners and native\r\nChristians were not massacred _en masse_ before the arrival of the relief\r\nexpedition. In this Decree on the subject of lawsuits, Her Majesty states\r\nthat she has recently learned that legal proceedings are frequently hung\r\nup for several months at a time, and that innocent persons have been\r\ndetained in custody for indefinite periods pending enquiry.\r\n\r\n    “Every sort of extortion is apparently practised in these\r\n    courts, and their gaolers deliberately obstruct the hearing\r\n    of cases unless they are heavily bribed. But if one member of\r\n    a family is thrown into prison, it is evident that his whole\r\n    household must suffer. Who would willingly enter upon legal\r\n    proceedings, unless suffering from injustice too grievous to be\r\n    borne, when the myrmidons of the law are able thus to ill-treat\r\n    claimants? At the root of the whole evil lies the fact that\r\n    the magistrates wilfully delay their business, being deaf to\r\n    the needs of the people. From our hearts we pity them, and we\r\n    now decree that regulations shall at once be drawn up for the\r\n    expediting of outstanding cases. Any delay in this matter will\r\n    involve heavy penalties.”\r\n\r\nAgain, another Edict thus reflects the benevolence of the “Divine Mother”\r\nand her desire to conciliate public opinion:—\r\n\r\n    “In the majority of recent cases of summary executions in the\r\n    provinces, the culprits have been guilty of robbery under arms.\r\n    However heinous the offences of such criminals, they really\r\n    deserve our sincere pity. The excuse generally given for their\r\n    folly is that they have been forced into crime by starvation;\r\n    under such conditions men are apt to forget that their evil\r\n    acts will bring upon them the death penalty. These criminals\r\n    are hardy men and resolute; if they could only be turned from\r\n    their evil ways to service in our Army or to agriculture, they\r\n    might become good citizens: how preferable such a result to\r\n    seeing them cast into prison and finally dismembered? Apart\r\n    from this consideration, the crimes which they commit involve\r\n    their parents and families, a thought sufficient in itself\r\n    to disturb their conscience for ever. Here, in the remote\r\n    seclusion of our Palace, we think only of our people’s welfare,\r\n    and we long for the time when virtue may prevail and punishment\r\n    become a thing of the past. We therefore now implore you, our\r\n    children, to remember how real is our sympathy in all your\r\n    troubles; strive then to be virtuous citizens, and cease from\r\n    acts of violence which only bring trouble and misery in their\r\n    train. Let this our Decree be made known to the most remote\r\n    districts of our Empire, so that all may be aware of our\r\n    solicitude and tender regard for our people.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress Dowager was much incensed at the sympathy for the Emperor\r\nshown by foreigners both in China and abroad, a sympathy which was\r\nreflected for a time in the attitude of the British Minister and other\r\nmembers of the Diplomatic Body at Peking. Adopting, however, that policy\r\nof “conciliation pending a fitting opportunity for hostilities,” which\r\n(as will be seen in another place) she had learned from study of the\r\nclassics, she invited the wives of the foreign Ministers and other\r\nLegation ladies to an audience in the Palace at the beginning of the\r\nwinter, and treated them with such courtesy and consideration that she\r\nwon their hearts in a day. That her friendliness was entirely assumed, we\r\nhave learned from her own statements, and there is no doubt that, from\r\nthis time forward, she came more and more under the influence of the\r\nchief reactionary Kang Yi, who, during the absence of Jung Lu on leave,\r\nwas able to persuade her that the first essential towards improving the\r\ncountry’s military resources was the organisation of bands of militia\r\nthroughout the Empire. By missionaries who were close observers of events\r\nin Shantung and other head-quarters of this patriotic movement, it was\r\nsoon realised that this military activity was directed primarily against\r\nforeigners, and owed its origin in the first instance to the Empress\r\nDowager’s approval of Kang Yi’s policy of violent reaction.\r\n\r\nThe following Decree, promulgated towards the close of the year may, in a\r\ncertain sense, be regarded as the beginning and the charter of the Boxer\r\nMovement; it was undoubtedly inspired by Kang Yi and his party.\r\n\r\n    “There has never been a time when the relations between\r\n    Sovereign and people could safely dispense with a good\r\n    understanding and certain general common objects. It is of\r\n    course for the local Magistrates to initiate measures in all\r\n    questions of local importance, but no successful national\r\n    policy can be maintained unless the gentry and the lower\r\n    classes co-operate with the Government. If we consider, for\r\n    example, the question of food-supply reserves, the organisation\r\n    of police, the drilling of militia or train-bands, and so\r\n    forth: they may seem very ordinary matters, but if they are\r\n    efficiently handled they may be made of the very greatest\r\n    value to the nation; for by making due provision against\r\n    famine, the people’s lives are protected, and similarly, by the\r\n    organisation of local police, protection is afforded against\r\n    bandits. As to the train-bands, they only require to undergo\r\n    regular training for a sufficient period to enable us to attain\r\n    to the position of a nation in arms. At any crisis in our\r\n    country’s affairs their services would then be available and\r\n    invaluable.\r\n\r\n    “We therefore decree that a beginning be now made in the\r\n    Provinces of Chihli, Mukden, and Shantung, where all the local\r\n    authorities must admonish the gentry and common people, so that\r\n    these measures may be carried out with the utmost energy. Where\r\n    any organisation already exists for the purposes mentioned, it\r\n    need only be remodelled, and brought into line with the general\r\n    system. Let steps be taken first at the provincial capitals,\r\n    and extended thence throughout the Provinces. Eventually it\r\n    is our intention that the system adopted shall be enforced\r\n    throughout the Empire, on the basis of the new regulations\r\n    adopted in these three Provinces.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Decree consists of the usual exhortations and warnings,\r\nand is of no particular interest. It is not certain from this document\r\nthat the Empress herself understood clearly the forces that were about to\r\nbe let loose in these so-called military train-bands, and her subsequent\r\nvacillation in regard to the Boxers would seem to afford an indication,\r\nif not proof, that she acted impulsively and without full knowledge,\r\nunder the influence of Kang Yi. But the question rapidly increased in\r\nimportance, so that a few days later we find Her Majesty issuing a\r\nsecond Decree, which shows that the potential power of the train-bands as\r\na national force was gradually impressing itself upon her mind, where,\r\nas we know, the hope of revenge on foreigners was ever latent. In this\r\nsecond Decree occurs the following passage:—\r\n\r\n    “Recent events have caused me the greatest grief and anxiety;\r\n    by day and by night, in the seclusion of my Palace, my thoughts\r\n    dwell on these matters, and my one object is now to secure the\r\n    tranquillity and prosperity of my subjects by the organisation\r\n    of adequate military forces. My purposes, set forth in numerous\r\n    Decrees, regarding the organisation of a strong army, the\r\n    improvement of communications, and the formation of train-bands\r\n    and militia, aim all at strengthening the Empire and promoting\r\n    the contentment of my people.”\r\n\r\nAfter reiterating the substance of former Decrees, Her Majesty proceeds\r\npathetically to complain “that they have to a large extent been ignored,\r\nor merely transmitted by one provincial authority to another, descending\r\nfrom the Governor to the District Magistrate through the usual routine\r\nchannels, and eventually pigeon-holed as so much waste paper.” She admits\r\nfrankly that this method of treating Imperial Decrees is quite usual, and\r\nthat it has the sanction of tradition, but she insists that the time has\r\ncome for a change, and therefore now directs that all her Decrees are in\r\nfuture to be printed on special Imperial yellow paper, and their contents\r\nmade known throughout the length and breadth of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAfter further earnest exhortations to patriotism, and to that keen sense\r\nof duty which alone can develop efficiency in the public service, she\r\ndirects that the local officials should keep closer touch with the gentry\r\nand the elders of the people, and that officers in command of military\r\nforces are to explain clearly to the rank and file the objects which Her\r\nMajesty has in view in deciding upon military organisation.\r\n\r\nThe Decree concludes with the following words:—\r\n\r\n    “If in times of peace my people are prepared to face all\r\n    possible dangers, and to put away from them selfish and ignoble\r\n    ease, they will find that, when the hour of trial comes, their\r\n    common resolution is in very truth a tower of strength, which\r\n    shall not fail to bring about its due reward. By this means\r\n    shall the foundations of our Empire be strengthened, and its\r\n    prestige increased, and thus shall my purposes be fulfilled,\r\n    for which I have issued to you this solemn admonition.”\r\n\r\nThis Decree was followed by another, in the classical manner, exhorting\r\nthe troops to practise patriotism, which calls for no especial notice,\r\nand certainly produced no more conspicuous effect than her repeated\r\nwarnings to the provincial Mandarins and her appeals for more energy\r\nand intelligence in the public service. Certain writers have pointed to\r\nthe numerous and plain-spoken Decrees issued by Tzŭ Hsi at this period,\r\nas proof that her heart was really set upon effectively reforming the\r\ncountry’s administration, but it is always difficult for foreigners, and\r\neven for Chinese outside the Palace, to form any concise idea as to the\r\ninner meaning of these lucubrations, and how much of them was, on any\r\nparticular occasion, to be taken as something outside of the traditional\r\nand stereotyped utterances of the Throne. It is certain that she herself\r\nfailed to exercise the personal influence and example that would have\r\nconvinced the world of her sincerity, and that she did nothing to put her\r\nhouse of the Forbidden City in order or to do away with the manifest and\r\nnotorious abuses at her Court.\r\n\r\nThe Old Buddha concluded this remarkable display of literary and\r\npolitical activity by returning once more to the grievance which rankled\r\nmost deeply, viz., that the chief conspirator against her sacred\r\nauthority and person had made good his escape. Professing to believe\r\nthat the heinousness of K’ang Yu wei’s crimes was not fully realised by\r\nher people, she issued another Decree on the subject, in December, as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    “T’an Chung-lin, Viceroy of Canton, has memorialised\r\n    stating that he has brought to light, by searches at K’ang\r\n    Yu-wei’s birthplace, a large quantity of documents, chiefly\r\n    correspondence between the members of K’ang’s party, together\r\n    with certain seals, made of stone; all of which he has\r\n    forwarded for our personal inspection. These letters contain\r\n    a mass of treasonable matter. In one place the suggestion\r\n    is actually made that T’an Ssu-t’ung (one of the reformers\r\n    executed) should be nominated as President of the Chinese\r\n    Republic! The writers ignore the present Dynasty even in dating\r\n    their correspondence, and use instead a chronology which\r\n    begins with the birth of Confucius; one of them has actually\r\n    had the unbounded audacity to describe the present Dynasty as\r\n    ‘perfectly useless.’ Abominable wickedness of this kind shows\r\n    that these men were something worse than ordinary rebels and\r\n    parricides. Their correspondence implicates an enormous number\r\n    of persons, but, as the Throne desires to show mercy and to\r\n    refrain from any further enquiry into this matter, the whole\r\n    correspondence has now been burnt by our orders.\r\n\r\n    “When first we stated in our Decrees the nature of the\r\n    treasonable conspiracy that K’ang Yu-wei had organised and of\r\n    his revolutionary programme, it was our object to nip rebellion\r\n    in the bud. But it would appear, from information which has\r\n    reached us, that certain misinformed people still hold to the\r\n    opinion and express it, that K’ang Yu-wei was nothing worse\r\n    than an over-zealous reformer. We mention therefore this matter\r\n    of the correspondence of these traitors, as proving beyond\r\n    possibility of doubt that K’ang Yu-wei was indeed a base and\r\n    unnatural malefactor, and we feel convinced that our loyal\r\n    subjects, from the highest to the lowest, realising this truth,\r\n    will now relegate his revolutionary utterances to their proper\r\n    position of insignificance. Thus shall right principles triumph\r\n    and the wrong be wiped out.”\r\n\r\nThus was Tzŭ Hsi established in her pride of place and thus were sown the\r\nseeds of that great upheaval which was soon to shake the Empire to its\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE GENESIS OF THE BOXER MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Boxers has been so fully written, and so many\r\nexcellent accounts given of the origins and contributing factors of the\r\nmovement, that any further reference to the matter may seem superfluous.\r\nNevertheless, the following extracts from a letter addressed by Jung Lu\r\nto his friend Hsü Ying-kuei, the Viceroy of Fukien, may throw some new\r\nlight, not only on the causes of the growth of the movement in Chihli\r\nbut also on the character, private opinions and political methods of the\r\nEmpress Dowager’s favourite and trusted adviser. It was written in the\r\nearly part of July 1900.\r\n\r\n    “The Boxers started in eighteen villages of the Kuan district\r\n    of Shantung and they were originally called the ‘Plum Blossom\r\n    Fists.’ When Li Ping-heng was Governor of the Province (1895)\r\n    he did not forbid their proceedings, but, on the contrary,\r\n    proceeded to enrol them as Militia. Last summer there were\r\n    several conflicts between these Boxers and the Imperial\r\n    troops, but the Military commander was cashiered by order\r\n    of the Governor for his action and all the Boxer prisoners\r\n    were released. Their leader at this time openly described\r\n    himself as a descendant of the Ming Emperors and the female\r\n    branch of his society called ‘Red Lamp Light’ was named after\r\n    him. Last autumn, thus encouraged, the movement spread into\r\n    Chihli. The magistrate at Chingchou put out a proclamation\r\n    warning the people not to believe in their so-called magic\r\n    arts; he said these Boxers were only the ‘White Lily Sect’\r\n    under another name. This magistrate was a good friend to the\r\n    French missionaries, and the Viceroy, hearing of the incident,\r\n    enquired into the matter and promptly had him dismissed. This\r\n    caused me great regret, for both Wang Wen-shao and I had\r\n    known the man well, when we held the Chihli Viceroyalty, and\r\n    respected him.\r\n\r\n    “At the end of the 9th Moon of last year there were Boxers\r\n    openly displaying huge banners in Chihli, on which was written,\r\n    ‘The Gods assist us to destroy all foreigners; we invite you\r\n    to join the patriotic Militia.’ At one place a Buddhist abbot\r\n    was the head of the Society and he led on the mob, burning the\r\n    Christian chapel there. Subsequently, while they were burning\r\n    converts’ houses at Liupa, the magistrate came out and attacked\r\n    them with his troops. The soldiers opened fire and the Boxers\r\n    retreated, but their priest leaders were captured, and some\r\n    thirty or forty were shot dead. This ought to have demonstrated\r\n    to the people at large how nonsensical were the stories about\r\n    the invulnerability of these mountebanks: our soldiers dealt\r\n    with them as easily as if they had been trussing chickens!\r\n    There were charms and forms of incantation found on the persons\r\n    of the priests who, after an examination by the magistrate,\r\n    were summarily executed.\r\n\r\n    “The provincial treasurer, T’ing Yung,[65] was largely\r\n    responsible for the beginning of the trouble. I hear that about\r\n    ten days ago he sent for all his subordinates to attend at\r\n    his Yamên, and the Prefect of Hsüanhua,[66] who was passing\r\n    through, came to pay his respects with the others. This man\r\n    said, ‘in the reign of Chia Ch’ing there were heterodox cults\r\n    of this kind, and the Emperor ordered them to be suppressed.’\r\n    T’ing Yung replied, ‘circumstances alter cases. Why should you\r\n    now refer to those days?’ The Prefect answered him, ‘It is\r\n    quite true that the calendar is no longer the same as it was\r\n    at that time, but the enlightened principles laid down by our\r\n    sacred ancestors should be a guidance to us for ever.’ T’ing\r\n    had of course nothing to say, and could only glare at him in\r\n    silence and change the conversation.\r\n\r\n    “When first I read Her Majesty’s decree of the 21st June in\r\n    which she orders us to form train-bands of these brave Boxers,\r\n    describing them as patriots of whom large numbers are to be\r\n    found, and should be enrolled, in every province, I lay awake\r\n    all the next night thinking over this matter. Unable to sleep,\r\n    more than once I sprang from my bed restless and excited with\r\n    mixed feelings of joy and fear. The idea of enlisting these\r\n    patriotic volunteers to repel the aggression of the foreigner\r\n    is undoubtedly a good one, and, if carefully worked out and\r\n    directed by firm discipline and good leadership, it might no\r\n    doubt be of the very highest utility. But if otherwise handled,\r\n    these men will inevitably get out of hand, and the only result\r\n    will be chaos and disaster. You will, no doubt, agree with me,\r\n    my old friend and colleague, that the motive which inspires\r\n    these Boxers is a patriotic one. So great is the ill-feeling\r\n    that exists between the mass of our people and the converts to\r\n    Christianity that we have been unavoidably dragged to the very\r\n    verge of hostilities, and our Government has embarked upon a\r\n    desperate course ‘of inviting the enemy to meet us in battle\r\n    before the walls of our capital.’ It is as if we were treading\r\n    on naked swords without flinching; there can be no question as\r\n    to the enthusiasm and ardour in our cause.\r\n\r\n    “But, at the beginning of the movement, these Boxers were\r\n    afraid to come together in large numbers lest the Imperial\r\n    troops should attack and destroy them; from this alone we\r\n    may reasonably infer that they are not devoid of the common\r\n    instinct of fear. By themselves they cannot be fully trusted,\r\n    but it seems to me (though you may consider the idea absurd)\r\n    that one might profitably use them to inspire, by their\r\n    fanaticism, the martial ardour of our regular troops. As a\r\n    fighting force they are absolutely useless, but their claims\r\n    to supernatural arts and magic might possibly be valuable for\r\n    the purpose of disheartening the enemy. But it would be quite\r\n    wrong, not to say fatal, for us to attach any real belief to\r\n    their ridiculous claims, or to regard them as of any real use\r\n    in action. Even if there were any truth in these tales of\r\n    magic they must necessarily be founded in heresy, and you know\r\n    full well that Chinese history records numerous instances of\r\n    such superstitious beliefs ending in rebellions against the\r\n    reigning Dynasty. You recently telegraphed me advising me\r\n    not to be unduly anxious, because in your opinion the Boxers\r\n    acquitted themselves exceedingly well in the fights at Tientsin\r\n    and Taku on the 20th June. I am not so sure of this myself; in\r\n    any case it is well to bear in mind that there is a very great\r\n    difference between the fighting capacity and temperament of the\r\n    natives of the north and south of China.[67] All the southern\r\n    provinces are teeming with secret and revolutionary societies,\r\n    salt smugglers, and other kinds of desperadoes; so much tinder,\r\n    which any spark may kindle into flames of disturbance at any\r\n    moment. These southern people are gamblers and disorderly\r\n    characters by profession, but they are certainly not animated\r\n    by any patriotic instinct, and if you were to enlist any\r\n    large number of them as a military force, it would be just\r\n    like organising bands of jackals and wolves to fight tigers.\r\n    The result would be that while none of the tigers would be\r\n    destroyed, millions of your own people, who may be likened to\r\n    sheep, would suffer miserably. On the other hand these northern\r\n    Boxers are not inspired by any lust of plunder, but by a\r\n    species of religious frenzy. Now, as you know, northerners are\r\n    dull and obstinate by nature, while the southerners are alert\r\n    but unreliable, so that it is difficult, if not impossible,\r\n    to arrive at any fixed policy or joint action in dealing with\r\n    them together. Was it not because of this characteristic of\r\n    the southerners that the Grand Council was so indignant in\r\n    1894, when, in fighting against the Japanese, our men feared\r\n    them worse than tigers, and, recognising their own hopeless\r\n    inferiority, threw down their weapons and would not face the\r\n    enemy?\r\n\r\n    “These Boxers are not trained troops, but they are ready to\r\n    fight, and to face death. It is indeed a very gratifying\r\n    surprise to see any of our people display courage, and to\r\n    witness their enthusiasm for paying off old scores against\r\n    the foreigner; but if, inspired by the sight of these brave\r\n    fellows, we imagine for a moment that the whole Empire is\r\n    going to follow their example, and that we shall thus be\r\n    enabled to rid ourselves of the accursed presence of the\r\n    foreigner, we are very much mistaken, and the attempt is\r\n    foredoomed. My advice therefore to your Excellency, is not to\r\n    hesitate in disobeying the Edict which commanded you to raise\r\n    these train-bands. I do not hesitate to give you this advice\r\n    and to assure you that you run no risks in following it. You\r\n    should, of course, act with great discretion, but the main\r\n    thing is to prevent the Throne’s Decree becoming an excuse for\r\n    the banding together of disorderly characters. I write this\r\n    private letter under stress of much natural apprehension, and\r\n    you will therefore pray forgive the haste and confusion of its\r\n    contents, and I trust that you will favour me in due course\r\n    with your reply.\r\n\r\n                                (Signed)\r\n\r\n                                                          “JUNG LU.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “BEILEH” TSAI YING, SON OF PRINCE KUNG (CASHIERED BY\r\nTZŬ HSI FOR PRO-BOXER PROCLIVITIES), AND HIS SON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE DIARY OF HIS EXCELLENCY CHING SHAN\r\n\r\n\r\n    [NOTE.—Ching Shan, a Manchu of the Plain Yellow Banner Corps,\r\n    was born in 1823. In 1863 he became a Metropolitan Graduate and\r\n    Hanlin Compiler, especially distinguished as a scholar in Sung\r\n    philosophy. In the following year he was appointed a Junior\r\n    Secretary of the Imperial Household (Nei wu fu), rising to\r\n    Senior Secretary in 1869 and Comptroller in 1879. His father,\r\n    Kuang Shun, had held the post of Comptroller-General under\r\n    the Emperor Tao-Kuang, with whom he was for years on terms of\r\n    intimacy; he was a kinsman of the Empress Dowager’s family and\r\n    in close touch with all the leading Manchu nobles. Ching Shan\r\n    had therefore exceptional opportunities of knowing all the\r\n    gossip of the Court, of learning the opinions and watching the\r\n    movements of the high officials, Chinese and Manchu, who stood\r\n    nearest to the Throne. After holding office in several of the\r\n    Metropolitan Boards, he retired in 1894. He was tutor to Prince\r\n    Tuan, Duke Tsai Lan, and other sons of Prince Tun (younger son\r\n    of the Emperor Tao-Kuang), and therefore intimately associated\r\n    with the leaders of the Boxer movement.\r\n\r\n    Seen even against the lurid background of the abomination of\r\n    desolation which overtook Peking in August 1900, Ching Shan’s\r\n    fate was unusually tragic. Above the storm and stress of battle\r\n    and sudden death, of dangers from Boxers, wild Kansuh soldiery\r\n    and barbarian invaders, the old scholar’s domestic griefs,\r\n    the quarrels of his women folk, his son’s unfilial behaviour,\r\n    strike a more poignant note than any of his country’s fast\r\n    pressing misfortunes. And with good cause. On the 15th August,\r\n    after the entry of the allied forces into Peking and the flight\r\n    of the Empress Dowager, his wife, his senior concubine, and one\r\n    of his daughters-in-law committed suicide. He survived them but\r\n    a few hours, meeting death at the hands of his eldest son, En\r\n    Ch’un, who pushed him down a well in his own courtyard. This\r\n    son was subsequently shot by British troops for harbouring\r\n    armed Boxers.\r\n\r\n    The Diary was found by the translator in the private study\r\n    of Ching Shan’s house on August 18th and saved, in the nick\r\n    of time, from being burnt by a party of Sikhs. Many of the\r\n    entries, which cover the period from January to August 1900,\r\n    refer to trivial and uninteresting matters. The following\r\n    passages are selected chiefly because of the light they throw\r\n    on the part played by the Empress Dowager in that tragedy of\r\n    midsummer madness—on the strong hand and statecraft of the\r\n    woman, and on the unfathomable ignorance which characterises\r\n    to-day the degenerate descendants of Nurhachu. It should be\r\n    explained that Ching Shan (景善), who retired from office in\r\n    1894, must be distinguished from Ching Hsin (敬信), who died\r\n    about 1904. The latter was also a Manchu and a favourite of Tzŭ\r\n    Hsi, well known to foreigners at the capital. He held various\r\n    high posts, rose to be a Grand Secretary, and remained in\r\n    Peking after the flight of the Court, in charge of the Palace.\r\n    It was he who escorted the Diplomatic Body through the deserted\r\n    halls of the Forbidden City in September 1900. He was highly\r\n    respected by all who knew him.\r\n\r\n    Ching Shan, though of similarly high rank, was personally quite\r\n    unknown to foreigners, but a short note on his career (and\r\n    another on that of Ching Hsin) will be found in the “List of\r\n    the Higher Metropolitan and provincial officials” periodically\r\n    compiled by the Chinese Secretariat of the British Legation;\r\n    Edition of 1902, Kelly and Walsh, Shanghai.]\r\n\r\n_25th Year of Kuang Hsü, 12th Moon, 25th Day_ (25th January, 1900).—Duke\r\nTsai Lan came to see me, his old tutor, to-day. He has much to tell me\r\nconcerning the “Patriotic Harmony” train-bands (I Ho Tuan) which have\r\nbeen raised in Shantung by Yü Hsien, the Governor. Later, he described\r\nyesterday’s audience at the Palace; in addition to the Grand Secretaries,\r\nthe Presidents of Boards and the Ministers of the Household, the “Sacred\r\nMother” received Prince Kung, his uncles Tsai Ying and Tsai Lien and\r\nPrince Tuan. The Old Buddha announced her intention of selecting a new\r\nEmperor. She said: “The nation has shown resentment and reproached me\r\nfor putting Kuang Hsü on the Throne, he being of the wrong generation;\r\nfurthermore, he himself has shown great lack of filial duty to me\r\nnotwithstanding the debt of gratitude he owed me for my kindness in\r\nthus elevating him. Has he not plotted against me with traitors from\r\nthe south? I now propose therefore to depose him and to place a new\r\nEmperor on the Throne, whose accession shall take place on the first\r\nday of the New Year. It should be for you Ministers now to consider\r\nwhat title should be given to Kuang Hsü upon his abdication. There is\r\na precedent for his removal from the Throne in the case of the Emperor\r\nChing T’ai of the Ming Dynasty who was reduced to the rank of Prince and\r\nwhose brother was restored to the Throne after eight years of captivity\r\namong the Mongols.” There was dead silence for some time in the Hall of\r\nAudience. At last the Grand Secretary Hsü T’ung suggested as appropriate\r\nthe title of “Hun-te-Kung,” which means, “The Duke of Confused Virtue”—or\r\nwell-meaning bungler:—it had been given by the Mongol Dynasty to a\r\ndeposed Sung Emperor. The Old Buddha approved. She then declared to the\r\nassembly that her choice of the new Emperor was already made; it had\r\nfallen upon the eldest son of Prince Tuan, whose great devotion to Her\r\nMajesty’s person was well known. Henceforward Prince Tuan should be in\r\nconstant attendance at the Palace to supervise the education of his son.\r\nAt this point the Grand Secretary Sun Chia-nai[68] craved permission to\r\nspeak. He implored the Empress not to depose the Emperor; of a certainty\r\nthere would be rebellion in the Southern provinces. The choice of a new\r\nSovereign rested with her, but it could only be done after “ten thousand\r\nyears had elapsed” (_i.e._, after the death of the present Emperor).\r\nThe “Motherly Countenance” showed great wrath; turning on Sun Chia-nai,\r\nshe bade him remember that this was a family council to which she only\r\nadmitted Chinese as an act of grace. She had already notified the Emperor\r\nof her intention, and he had no objections to offer. The Empress then\r\nordered all present to repair to the Hall of Diligent Government there to\r\nawait her and the Emperor, and upon their coming to witness the draft of\r\nthe Decree appointing the Heir Apparent. The formal announcement of his\r\naccession to the throne would be postponed until the first day of the New\r\nYear.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded therefore to the entrance of the appointed Hall, and in a\r\nfew minutes the Empress’s chair appeared at the gateway, when all knelt\r\nand kowtowed three times. A number of eunuchs accompanied her, but she\r\nbade them remain without. She sent Major-domo Li Lien-ying to request the\r\nEmperor’s presence; he came in his chair, alighting at the outer gate\r\nand kowtowed to the Empress, who had taken her seat on the main throne\r\nwithin. She beckoned him to come to the Hall, and he knelt again, all\r\nofficials still kneeling outside. “_Chin lai, pu yung kuei hsia_” (Come\r\nin, you need not kneel), called Her Majesty. She bade him sit down, and\r\nsummoned next the princes and ministers—some thirty in all—to enter.\r\nAgain the Old Buddha repeated her reasons for the step she was taking.\r\nThe Emperor only said “What Your Majesty suggests is quite proper and in\r\naccordance with my views.” At this the Grand Secretary Jung Lu handed\r\nto the Empress the Decree which the Grand Council had drafted.[69] She\r\nread it through and forthwith ordered its promulgation. Nothing was said\r\nto “The Lord of Ten Thousand Years” as to his being deposed; only the\r\nselection of the Heir Apparent was discussed. The Grand Council then\r\nremained for further audience, but the Princes were ordered to withdraw,\r\nso that Duke Lan does not know what passed thereafter. The Emperor seemed\r\ndazed, as one in a dream.\r\n\r\n_30th Day_ (30th January, 1900).—To-day Liu Shun shaved my head; he\r\nleaves to-night for his home at Pao-ti-hsien there to spend the new year.\r\nMy eldest son, En Ch’u, is pressing me to give him fifty taels to buy\r\nan ermine cloak; he is a bad son and most undutiful. Chi Shou-ch’ing\r\ncame to see me to-day; he has moved to “Kuai Pang” Lane. He tells me\r\nthat his father-in-law, Yü Hsien, is to be made Governor of Shansi.\r\nThe Old Buddha has received him in audience since his removal from\r\nthe Governorship of Shantung on account of the murder of a French[70]\r\nmissionary, and praised him for the honesty and justice of his\r\nadministration. She does not approve of the Big Sword Society’s proposed\r\nextermination of foreigners, because she does not believe they can do\r\nit; Yü Hsien goes often to Prince Tuan’s palace, and they have many\r\nsecret interviews. Prince Tuan declares that if he were made President\r\nof the Tsung-li Yamên he would make short work of all difficulties with\r\nforeigners. He is a violent man and lacking in refinement.\r\n\r\n_1st Day of 26th Year of Kuang Hsü_ (31st January, 1900).—To-day I am\r\n78 years of age and my children mock me for being deaf. They are bad\r\nsons and will never rise so high as their father has done. When I was\r\ntheir age, between 20 and 30, the Emperor Tao-Kuang had already praised\r\nmy scholarship and presented me with a complimentary scroll bearing a\r\nquotation from the writings of the philosopher Chu.\r\n\r\nThis year will witness many strange events; the people all say so. The\r\neighth month is intercalary which, in a year that has “Keng” for its\r\ncyclical character, has ever been an evil omen. The New Emperor was to\r\nhave been proclaimed to-day under the title of “Heng-Ching”—all pervading\r\nprosperity—but my son En Lin tells me that the new year sacrifices were\r\nperformed by the Ta-A-Ko (heir apparent) at the Palace of Imperial\r\nLongevity, acting only as Deputy for the Emperor Kuang Hsü. The Ta-A-Ko\r\nis a boy of fourteen; very intelligent, but violent-tempered. He walked\r\non foot to the Palace Hall from the Coal Hill Gate.\r\n\r\n_5th Moon, 5th Day: The Dragon Festival_ (1st June, 1900).[71]—Arose\r\nat six o’clock and was washing my face in the small inner room,\r\nwhen Huo Kuei, the gatekeeper, came in with the card of Kang Yi, the\r\nGrand Secretary, and a present of ten pounds of pork, with seasonable\r\ngreetings. I was not aware that he had already returned from his journey\r\nto Chu Chou, whither he had gone with Chao Shu-ch’iao to examine and\r\nreport on the doings of the “patriotic train bands” (_i.e._ Boxers). He\r\nsends word by the messenger that he will call upon me this morning.\r\n\r\nMy sons En Ch’u and En Shun are going to-day to a theatrical performance\r\nat Chi Shou-ch’eng’s residence. My youngest son, En Ming, is on duty at\r\nthe Summer Palace, where, for the next four days, the Old Buddha will be\r\nhaving theatricals. I am surprised that Kang Yi is not out there also. No\r\ndoubt he only returned to Peking last night, and so does not resume his\r\nplace on the Council till to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n_The Hour of the Monkey_ (3 P.M.).—Kang Yi has been here and I persuaded\r\nhim to stay for the mid-day meal. He is a worthy brother-in-law, and,\r\nthough twenty years younger than I am, as wise and discreet a man as any\r\non the Grand Council. He tells me that several hundred foreign devil\r\ntroops entered the City yesterday evening. He and Chao Shu-ch’iao arrived\r\nat Peking at 4.30 P.M., and immediately set to composing their memorial\r\nto the Empress Dowager about the heaven-sent Boxers, for presentation\r\nto-morrow morning. Prince Tuan has five days’ leave of absence: Kang\r\nYi went to see him yesterday evening. While they were discussing the\r\nsituation, at the Prince’s own house, there came a Captain of Prince\r\nCh’ing’s bodyguard with a message. Saluting Prince Tuan, he announced\r\nthat about 300 foreign soldiers had left Tientsin in the afternoon as\r\nreinforcement for the Legation Guards. Prince Ch’ing implored Prince Tuan\r\nnot to oppose their entry, on the ground that a few hundred foreigners,\r\nmore or less, could make no difference. He trusted that Prince Tuan\r\nwould give orders to his Corps (the “Celestial Tigers” Force) not\r\nto oppose the foreign devils. It was the wish of the Old Buddha that\r\nthey should be permitted to guard the Legations. Prince Tuan asked for\r\nfurther details, and the Captain said that Prince Ch’ing had received a\r\ntelegram from the Governor-General of Chihli (Yü Lu) to the effect that\r\nthe detachment carried no guns. At this Prince Tuan laughed scornfully\r\nand said “How can the few resist the many? What indeed will a hundred\r\npuny hobgoblins, more or less, matter?” Kang Yi, on the contrary, tells\r\nme that he strongly urged Prince Tuan to issue orders to Chung Li, the\r\nCommandant of the city, to oppose the entry of the foreign troops, but\r\nit appears that Jung Lu had already ordered their admission. Kang Yi is\r\nmuch incensed with Jung Lu about this, and cannot understand his motives.\r\nIt seems that towards the close of last year Prince Tuan and Jung Lu had\r\nagreed to depose the Emperor and to put the Heir Apparent on the Throne,\r\nand Tuan confesses that, were it not for Jung Lu’s great influence with\r\nthe Old Buddha she would never have agreed to select his son as Heir\r\nApparent. But now Jung Lu is for ever denouncing the Boxers and warning\r\nthe Empress against encouraging and countenancing them. Prince Tuan and\r\nKang Yi despair of ever being able to induce her to support the Boxers\r\nwhole-heartedly so long as Jung Lu is against them. As an example of her\r\npresent attitude, Prince Tuan told Kang Yi one day lately that his son,\r\nthe Ta-a-ko, had dressed himself up as a Boxer and was going through\r\ntheir drill in the Summer Palace grounds with some eunuchs. The Old\r\nBuddha saw him and promptly gave orders that he be confined to his rooms.\r\nShe also reprimanded the Grand Secretary, Hsü Tung, for not keeping a\r\nbetter watch on his pupil and for permitting such unseemly behaviour, as\r\nshe called it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.M.

The people\r\nmuttered curses, he says, but no one molested them. What does it matter?\r\nNone of them will ever leave the city. Kang Yi’s journey to Chu-chou\r\nhas convinced him that the whole province stands together as one man;\r\neven boys in their teens are drilling. Not a doubt of it; the foreigner\r\nwill be wiped out this time! At Chu-chou the Departmental Magistrate,\r\na man named Kung, had arrested several Boxer leaders, but Kang Yi and\r\nChao Shu-ch’iao ordered them to be released and made them go through\r\ntheir mystic evolutions and drill. It was a wonderful sight, scarcely\r\nto be believed; several of them were shot, some more than once, yet\r\nrose uninjured from the ground. This exhibition took place in the main\r\ncourtyard of the Magistrate’s Yamên, in the presence of an enormous\r\ncrowd, tight pressed, as compact as a wall. Chao Shu-ch’iao remembers\r\nhaving seen many years ago, in his native province of Shensi, a similar\r\nperformance, and it is on record that similar marvels were seen at the\r\nclose of the Han Dynasty, when Chang Chio headed the Yellow Turban\r\ninsurrection against the Government and took many great cities with half\r\na million of followers. They were said to be under the protection of the\r\nJade Emperor[72] and quite impervious to sword-thrusts. Kang Yi and Chao\r\nShu-Ch’iao will memorialise the Empress to-morrow, giving the results of\r\ntheir journey and begging her to recognise the “patriotic train-bands” as\r\na branch of the army. But they should be placed under the supreme command\r\nof Prince Tuan and Kang Yi, as Jung Lu, the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nNorthern army, is so incredulous as to their efficacy against foreign\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nAlthough Major Domo Li Lien-ying is a warm supporter of the Boxers, and\r\nnever wearies of describing their feats to the Old Buddha, feats which\r\nhe himself has witnessed, it is by no means certain that the “kindly\r\nMother” will heed him so long as Jung Lu is opposed to any official\r\nencouragement of the movement. And, besides, the nature of the Empress\r\nis peace-loving; she has seen many springs and autumns. I myself know\r\nwell her refined and gentle tastes, her love of painting, poetry, and\r\nthe theatre. When in a good mood she is the most amiable and tractable\r\nof women, but at times her rage is awful to witness. My father was\r\nComptroller-General of the Imperial Household, and it was his lot on one\r\noccasion to experience her anger. This was in the sixth year of T’ung\r\nChih (1868), when she learned that the chief eunuch, “Hsiao An’rh,”[73]\r\nhad been decapitated in Shantung by the orders of the Co-Regent, the\r\nlate “Empress Dowager of the East.” She accused the Comptrollers of\r\nthe Household of being leagued together in treachery against her, as\r\nthey had not told her of what was going on she declared that Prince\r\nKung was plotting against her life, and that all her attendants were\r\nassociated in his treason. It was years before she forgave him. All An’s\r\nfellow-eunuchs were examined under torture by the Department responsible\r\nfor the management and discipline of the Household. When the chief\r\neunuch’s betrayer was discovered by this means, he was flogged to death\r\nby her orders in the Palace. But nowadays the Old Buddha’s heart has\r\nsoftened, even towards foreigners, and she will not allow any of them to\r\nbe done away with. One word from her would be sufficient to bring about\r\ntheir immediate and complete destruction, so that neither dog nor fowl\r\nbe left alive, and no trace be left of all their foreign buildings. Kang\r\nYi stayed with me about two hours and left to go and see Prince Tuan,\r\nwho was expecting Major Domo Li Lien-ying to come into the city this\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nK’un Hsiu, Vice-President of the Board of Works, called to see me. He\r\ntells me that Prince Ch’ing habitually ridicules the Boxers in private\r\nconversation, declaring them to be utterly useless, and unworthy of even\r\na smile from a wise man. In public, however, he is most cautious—last\r\nweek when the Old Buddha asked his opinion of them he replied by vaguely\r\nreferring to the possible value of train-bands for protection of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n9 P.M.—My son En Ch’u has returned from Chi Shou-ch’eng’s theatricals;\r\neveryone was talking, he says, of Jung Lu’s folly in allowing the foreign\r\ntroops to enter the city yesterday. Chi’s father-in-law, Yü Hsien, has\r\nwritten to him from Shansi saying that for the present there are but few\r\nBoxers enrolled in that province, but he is doing his best to further\r\nthe movement, so that Shansi may unite with the other provinces of the\r\nnorth “to destroy those who have aroused the Emperor’s wrath.” By common\r\nreport, Yüan Shih-k’ai has now become a convert to Christianity: if he\r\ntoo were to suppress the movement in Shantung, not death itself could\r\nexpiate his guilt.\r\n\r\nEn Chu’s wife is most undutiful; this evening she has had a quarrel\r\nwith my senior concubine, and the two women almost came to blows. Women\r\nare indeed difficult to manage; as Confucius has said, “Keep them at a\r\ndistance, they resent it; treat them familiarly, and they do not respect\r\nyou.” I am seventy-eight years of age and sore troubled by my family;\r\ntheir misconduct is hard for an old man to bear.\r\n\r\n_12th Day of the 5th Moon_ (June 8th, 1900).—My son, En Ming, came in\r\nthis morning about midday; as Officer of the Bodyguard he had been in\r\nattendance on the Empress coming in from the Summer Palace. Jung Lu\r\nhad been there yesterday morning and had had a long audience with Her\r\nMajesty. He gave her details of the burning of the railway by the Boxers.\r\nShe was seriously alarmed and decided to return at once to the Winter\r\nPalace on the Southern Lake. It seems she cannot make up her mind as to\r\nthe Boxers’ invulnerability. Jung Lu has again applied for leave. When he\r\nis absent from the Grand Council, Kang Yi and Ch’i Hsiu have the greatest\r\ninfluence with her. En Ming says that on the way to the city she kept\r\nurging the chair-bearers to hurry, and seemed out of sorts—nervously\r\nfanning herself all the time. At the Ying Hsiu gate of the Winter\r\nPalace the Emperor and the Heir Apparent were kneeling to receive her.\r\nNo sooner had she reached the Palace than she summoned Prince Tuan to\r\naudience, which lasted a long time. It is a pity that the Old Buddha\r\nwill not decide and act more promptly. The Emperor never speaks at\r\naudience nowadays, although Her Majesty often asks him for his opinion.\r\nTung Fu-hsiang accompanied the Court into Peking; he denounced Jung Lu\r\nat audience to-day, telling the Empress that if only the Legations were\r\nattacked, he would undertake to demolish them in five days; but that Jung\r\nLu, by failing to support the Boxers, was a traitor to the Dynasty. The\r\nEmpire, said he, would be endangered unless the present opportunity were\r\nseized to wipe off old scores against the foreigner. Tung is a coarse,\r\nfoul-spoken fellow, most violent in his manner towards us Manchus. Kang\r\nYi hates him, but for the present is only too willing to make use of him.\r\n\r\n_14th day of the 5th Moon_ (June 10th).—Grand Councillor Ch’i Hsiu called\r\nto-day—he showed me the draft of a Decree breaking off all relations with\r\nforeigners, which he had prepared for the Empress’s signature; so far,\r\nhowever, she has given no indication of agreeing to make war against\r\nthem. In the afternoon I went to Duke Lan’s residence—to-day being his\r\nwife’s birthday. There are more than a hundred Boxers living in his outer\r\ncourtyard, most of them country-folk, under the command of a Banner\r\nCaptain named Wen Shun. Among them are five or six lads of thirteen or\r\nfourteen who will fall into a trance, foam at the mouth, then rise up\r\nand grasp wildly at anything that comes within their reach, uttering\r\nthe while strange uncouth noises. Duke Lan believes that by their magic\r\narts they will be able to guide him, when the time comes, to the houses\r\nof Christian converts (_lit._ Secondary Devils). He says that his wife\r\ngoes often to the Palace and that she has told the Old Buddha of these\r\nthings. The “Ta Kung Chu” (Princess Imperial and adopted daughter of the\r\nEmpress Dowager) has over two hundred and fifty Boxers quartered at the\r\nPalace outside the Hou Men, but she has not dared to tell the Empress\r\nDowager. Her brother, the “Prince” Tsai Ying, is also learning this\r\ndrill. Truly it is a splendid society! The Kansuh braves are now entering\r\nthe Chinese city, and thousands of people are preparing to leave Peking.\r\n\r\n_16th day of the 5th Moon_ (June 12th).—Jung Lu attended the Grand\r\nCouncil this morning. Prince Li, the Senior Councillor, did not dare to\r\ntell the Empress that a foreign devil[74] had been killed yesterday by\r\nthe Kansuh braves just outside the Yung-Ting Gate. Jung Lu was called to\r\nthe audience chamber after Prince Li had retired, and Kang Yi believes\r\nthat he urged her to order Tung Fu-hsiang to leave the city with his\r\ntroops and at the same time to issue an Edict, bestowing posthumous\r\nhonours on the murdered foreigner. None of the other Grand Councillors\r\nwere summoned to audience; when Jung Lu left the presence, he returned\r\nstraightway to his own house and spake no word to any of his colleagues.\r\nIt is rumoured that more foreign troops are coming to Peking, and that\r\nthe Empress Dowager will not permit them to enter the city. In this Jung\r\nLu agrees with her. He has advised that all foreigners shall be allowed\r\nto leave Peking, but that it is contrary to the law of nations to attack\r\nthe accredited representatives of foreign Powers.\r\n\r\n_18th Day of the 5th Moon_ (June 14th).—Yesterday, just before nightfall,\r\nEn Ch’u came in to tell me that several hundred Boxers had entered the\r\nHa-Ta Gate. I was sorry that my lameness prevented me from going out to\r\nsee them, but I sent Hao Ching-ting to report. Well indeed, is it, that\r\nI have lived to see this day; almost every foreign building except the\r\nLegations had been burnt to the ground. Throughout the night flames burst\r\nforth in every quarter of the city; a grand sight! Kang Yi has sent me a\r\nmessage to say that he and Duke Lan went to the Shun Chih (S.W.) Gate at\r\nabout the third watch to encourage and direct the Boxers who were burning\r\nthe French Church. Hundreds of converts were burnt to death, men, women\r\nand children, and so great was the stench of burning flesh that Duke Lan\r\nand Kang Yi were compelled to hold their noses. At dawn Kang Yi went to\r\nthe Palace to attend the Grand Council. Major Domo Li Lien-ying told\r\nhim that the Old Buddha had watched the conflagrations from the hillock\r\nto the west of the Southern Lake, and had plainly seen the destruction\r\nof the French Church at the Shun-Chih Men. Li Lien-ying had told her\r\nthat the foreigners had first fired on the crowd inside the Ha-Ta Gate,\r\nand that this had enraged the patriotic braves who had retaliated by\r\nslaughtering the converts. It seems that Hsü T’ung is unable to get out\r\nof his house because the foreign devils have barricaded the street; the\r\nOld Buddha is anxious about him and has commanded Prince Ch’ing to ask\r\nthe foreign Legations to let him pass out. She is amazed at the Boxers’\r\ncourage, and Kang Yi believes that she is about to give her consent to\r\na general attack upon the Legations. Nevertheless, Li Lien-ying has\r\nwarned him that exaggerated praise of the Boxers arouses her suspicions,\r\nand that, with the exception of Jung Lu, all the Grand Councillors are\r\nafraid to advise her. Her Majesty is moving into the Palace of Peaceful\r\nLongevity in the Forbidden City, as all these alarms and excursions\r\ndisturb her sleep at the Lake Palace.\r\n\r\n_21st Day of the 5th Moon_ (June 17th).—A great fire has been raging all\r\nto-day in the southern city. Those reckless Boxers set fire to a foreign\r\nmedicine store in the Ta Sha-lan’rh, and from this the flames spread\r\nrapidly, destroying the shops of the wealthy goldsmiths and assayers.\r\nRightly says the Canon of History, “When fire rages on the Kun Lun\r\nridge, common pebble and precious jade will be consumed together.” The\r\nBoxers themselves are worthy men, but there are among them many evil\r\ndoers whose only desire is plunder; these men, wearing the Boxer uniform,\r\nbring discredit upon the real “patriotic braves.” The outer tower of the\r\nCh’ien Men having caught fire, the Empress ordered Jung Lu to send Banner\r\ntroops on to the wall so as to prevent any ruffians entering the Tartar\r\nCity by the Ta Ch’ing Gate.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon my married niece came over to see her aunt: she has been\r\ngreatly alarmed by the uproar and fighting near her home, so they are\r\nmoving to her father-in-law’s house in the northern city.\r\n\r\nI hear that Prince Tuan has now persuaded the Old Buddha to appoint\r\nhim President of the Tsung Li Yamên; also that she has authorised\r\nhim to require all foreigners to leave Peking, but they are to be\r\nprotected against any attacks by the Boxers. My old friend, Ch’i Hsiu,\r\nhas been made a Minister of the Tsung Li Yamên, also Na T’ung, the\r\nSub-Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat. The latter memorialised lately\r\nadvising the Throne to declare war before the foreign Powers could send\r\nreinforcements; the Old Buddha has placed him in the Tsung Li Yamên\r\nto assist Prince Tuan and Chi Hsiu in arranging for the foreigners’\r\ndeparture from the city. Prince Ch’ing still says nothing for or against\r\nthe Boxers. Jung Lu has offered to escort the foreign Ministers half-way\r\nto Tientsin, but he stipulates that the Viceroyalty of Chihli must be\r\ntaken from Yü Lu. My wife was taken seriously ill this evening; she kept\r\non muttering incoherently and rolling about on the k’ang as if in great\r\npain. We sent for Dr. Yung, who applied acupuncture.\r\n\r\n_24th Day of the 5th Moon_ (June 20th).—Yesterday, at mid-day, Yü Lu’s\r\nmemorial reached the Throne. He says that the foreign devils have\r\nactually demanded the surrender of the Taku forts, and he begs the\r\nEmpress Dowager to declare war on them forthwith, to make them atone for\r\ntheir insolence and treachery. A special meeting of the Grand Council\r\nwas immediately called. The Old Buddha was very wroth, but said she would\r\npostpone her decision until to-day, when all the Princes, Presidents and\r\nVice-Presidents of the Boards and Ministries, and the Lieutenant-Generals\r\nof Banners, would meet in special audience. Prince Tuan, Ch’i Hsiu and Na\r\nT’ung showed her a despatch from the foreign Ministers couched in most\r\ninsolent language demanding her immediate abdication, the degradation of\r\nthe Heir Apparent, and the restoration of the Emperor.[75] The Ministers\r\nalso asked that the Emperor should allow 10,000 foreign troops to enter\r\nPeking to restore order. Kang Yi came to tell me that never had he seen\r\nthe Old Buddha so angry, not even when she learned of K’ang Yu-wei’s\r\ntreason. “How dare they question my authority!” she exclaimed. “If I can\r\nbear this, what must not be borne? The insults of these foreigners pass\r\nall bounds. Let us exterminate them before we eat our morning meal.”[76]\r\n\r\nThe wrath of the Old Buddha is indeed beyond control; neither Jung Lu,\r\nnor any other can stop her now. She has told Jung Lu that if he wishes,\r\nhe may still offer to escort the foreign Ministers to Tientsin, but she\r\nwill give no guarantee for their safety on the journey because of their\r\nmonstrous suggestion that she should abdicate. She does not absolutely\r\ndesire their death, but says that the consideration she showed them in\r\nallowing the Legation guards to enter the city, and her solicitude in\r\nrestraining the Boxers, have been ill-requited. “It were better,” says\r\nshe, “to go down in one desperate encounter than to surrender our just\r\nrights at the bidding of the foreigner.”\r\n\r\nThough only a woman, Her Majesty Tzŭ Hsi has all the courage of a man,\r\nand more than the ordinary man’s intelligence.\r\n\r\n_24th Day of the 5th Moon_: _The Hour of the Cock_, 5-7 P.M. (20th\r\nJune).—I have just returned from visiting my brother-in-law, the Grand\r\nSecretary Kang Yi; he told me all about this morning’s audience. At the\r\nhour of the Tiger (3-5 A.M.) the Grand Council assembled in the Palace\r\nby the Lake, and were received by the Old Buddha in the Pavilion of the\r\nCeremonial Phœnix. All were there, Prince Li, Jung Lu, Kang Yi, Wang\r\nWen-shao, Ch’i Hsiu, and Chao Shu-ch’iao, but the Emperor was absent.\r\nThis was a special audience, preparatory to the general audience of all\r\nthe Princes and Ministers, and its object was to give the Grand Council\r\nan opportunity of laying before Her Majesty any new facts or opinions\r\nbearing upon the situation.\r\n\r\nWith tears in his eyes, Jung Lu knelt before Her Majesty; he confessed\r\nthat the foreigners had only themselves to blame if China declared\r\nwar upon them, but he urged her to bear in mind that an attack on the\r\nLegations, as recommended by Prince Tuan and the rest of the Council,\r\nmight entail the ruin of the ancestral shrines of the Dynasty, as well as\r\nthe altars of the local and tutelary Gods. What good purpose, he asked,\r\nwould be served by the besieging nay, even by the destruction, of this\r\nisolated handful of Europeans? What lustre could it add to the Imperial\r\narms? Obviously, it must be waste of energy and misdirected purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Old Buddha replied that if these were his views, he had better\r\npersuade the foreigners to leave the city before the attack began; she\r\ncould no longer restrain the patriotic movement, even if she wished. If\r\ntherefore, he had no better advice than this to offer, he might consider\r\nhimself excused from further attendance at the Council.\r\n\r\nJung Lu thereupon kowtowed thrice and left the audience hall to return\r\nto his own house. Upon his departure, Ch’i Hsiu drew from his boot the\r\ndraft of the Decree which was to declare war. Her Majesty read it and\r\nexclaimed, “Admirable, admirable! These are exactly my views.” She\r\nasked each Grand Councillor in turn for his opinion, and they declared\r\nunanimously in favour of hostilities. It was now the hour appointed for\r\nthe general audience and Li-Lien-ying came in to conduct her Majesty to\r\nher own apartments to take tea before proceeding to the “Hall of Diligent\r\nGovernment.”\r\n\r\nAll the leading members of the Imperial Clan were kneeling at the\r\nentrance to the Hall, awaiting their Majesties’ arrival: the Princes\r\nKung, Ch’un and Tuan; the “Beilehs” Tsai Lien and Tsai Ying; Duke\r\nLan and his brother the “Beitzu” Ying; Prince Ch’ing and the five\r\nGrand Councillors; the Princes Chuang, Su and Yi; the Presidents,\r\nChinese and Manchu, of the six Boards and the nine Ministries; the\r\nLieutenants-General of the twenty-four Banner divisions; and the\r\nComptrollers of the Imperial Household. Their Majesties arrived together\r\nin chairs, borne by four bearers. The Emperor alighted first, and knelt\r\nas the “benign mother” left her palanquin and entered the Hall, supported\r\nby the Chief Eunuch Li Lien-ying, and by his immediate subordinate, T’sui\r\nChin. The Emperor was ghastly pale, and it was observed that he trembled\r\nas he took his seat on the Lower Throne by the Empress Dowager’s side.\r\n\r\nThe Old Buddha first called on all present to draw near to the Throne;\r\nthen, speaking with great vehemence, she declared that it was impossible\r\nfor her to brook these latest indignities put upon her by the foreigners.\r\nHer Imperial dignity could not suffer it. Until yesterday, until, in\r\nfact, she had read the dispatch addressed to the Tsungli Yamên by the\r\nDiplomatic Body, it had been her intention to suppress the Boxers; but\r\nin the face of their insolent proposal that she should hand over the\r\nreins of government to the Emperor, who had already proved himself quite\r\nunfitted to rule, she had been brought to the conclusion that no peaceful\r\nsolution of the situation was possible. The insolence of the French\r\nConsul at Tientsin Tu Shih-lan (Du Chaylard), in demanding the surrender\r\nof the Taku Forts was bad enough, but not so grievous an affront as\r\nthe Ministers’ preposterous proposal to interfere with her personal\r\nprerogatives as Sovereign. Her decision was now taken, her mind resolved;\r\nnot even Jung Lu, to whom she had always looked for wise counsel, could\r\nturn her from this purpose. Then, addressing more directly the Chinese\r\npresent, she bade them all to remember that the rule of her Manchu House\r\nhad conferred many and great benefits upon the nation for the past two\r\nhundred and fifty years, and that the Throne had always held the balance\r\nfairly in the benevolent consideration for all its subjects, north and\r\nsouth alike. The Dynasty had scrupulously followed the teachings of the\r\nSages in administering the government; taxation had been lighter than\r\nunder any previous rulers. Had not the people been relieved, in time of\r\ntheir distress, by grants from the Privy Purse? In her own reign, had\r\nnot rebellions been suppressed in such a manner as to earn the lasting\r\ngratitude of the southern provinces? It was therefore now their duty to\r\nrally to the support of the Throne, and to assist it in putting an end,\r\nonce and for all, to foreign aggression. It had lasted too long. If only\r\nthe nation were of one mind, it could not be difficult to convince these\r\nbarbarians that they had mistaken the leniency of the past for weakness.\r\nThat leniency had been great; in accordance with the principle which\r\nprescribes the showing of kindness to strangers from afar, the Imperial\r\nHouse had ever shown them the greatest consideration. The Emperor K’ang\r\nHsi had even allowed them liberty to propagate their religion, an act of\r\nmistaken benevolence which had been an increasing cause of regret to his\r\nsuccessors. In matters of vital principle, she said, these foreigners\r\nignore the sacred doctrines of the Sages; in matters of detail, they\r\ninsult the customs and cherished beliefs of the Chinese people. They have\r\ntrusted in the strength of their arms, but to-day China can rely upon\r\nmillions of her brave and patriotic volunteers. Are not even striplings\r\ntaking up arms for the defence of their country? She had always been\r\nof the opinion that the allied armies had been permitted to escape too\r\neasily in the tenth year of Hsien Feng (1860), and that only a united\r\neffort was then necessary to have given China the victory. To-day, at\r\nlast, the opportunity for revenge had come.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Emperor, she asked for his opinion. His Majesty, after a\r\nlong pause, and with evident hesitation, urged her to follow Jung Lu’s\r\nadvice, to refrain from attacking the Legations, and to have the foreign\r\nMinisters escorted in safety to the coast. But, he added, it must be for\r\nher to decide. He could not dare to assume any responsibility in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe junior Chinese Member of the Council, Chao Shu-ch’iao then spoke. He\r\nbegged the Old Buddha to issue her orders for the immediate extermination\r\nof every foreigner in the interior, so as to avoid the danger of spies\r\nreporting on the nature and extent of the patriotic movement. Her\r\nMajesty commanded the Grand Council to consider this suggestion and to\r\nmemorialise in due course for an Edict.\r\n\r\nAfter him, however, each in his turn, the Manchu Li-shan, and the Chinese\r\nHsü Ching-ch’eng and Yüan Ch’ang implored the Empress not to declare war\r\nagainst the whole world. China, they said, could not possibly escape\r\ndefeat, and, even if the Empire should not be partitioned, there must\r\narise great danger of rebellion and anarchy from within. Yüan Ch’ang\r\neven went so far as to say that he had served as a Minister of the\r\nTsungli Yamên for two years and that he had found foreigners to be\r\ngenerally reasonable and just in their dealings. He did not believe in\r\nthe authenticity of the despatch demanding the Empress’s abdication,\r\nwhich Prince Tuan professed to have received from the Diplomatic Body; in\r\nhis opinion, it was impossible that the Ministers should have dared to\r\nsuggest any such interference with China’s internal affairs.\r\n\r\nAt this Prince Tuan arose and angrily asked the Empress whether she\r\nproposed to listen to the words of a Chinese traitor? Her Majesty rebuked\r\nhim for his loud and violent manner of speaking, but ordered Yüan Ch’ang\r\nto leave the Audience Hall. No one else dared to say anything.\r\n\r\nShe then ordered the promulgation of the Decree, for immediate\r\ncommunication to all parts of the Empire; at the same time announcing\r\nher intention of sacrificing at the ancestral shrines before the\r\ncommencement of hostilities. Prince Chuang and Duke Lan were appointed\r\njoint Commanders-in-Chief of the Boxers, but Tzŭ Hsi gave them clearly\r\nto understand that if the foreign Ministers would agree to take their\r\ndeparture from Peking this afternoon Jung Lu was to do his best to\r\nprotect them as far as Tientsin. Finally, the Empress ordered the Grand\r\nCouncil to report themselves at mid-day for further orders. All were then\r\npermitted to retire with the exception of Prince Tuan and Duke Lan; these\r\nremained in special audience for some time longer. Hsü T’ung was present\r\nat the general audience, having made good his escape from the Legation\r\nquarter, and was congratulated by Her Majesty on his safety.\r\n\r\nThey say that Duke Lan told the Empress of a vision in which, the night\r\nbefore, he had seen Yü Huang, the Jade Emperor. To him, and to his\r\ncompany of Boxers while drilling, the god had appeared, and had expressed\r\nhis satisfaction with them and their patriotic movement. The Old Buddha\r\nobserved that the Jade Emperor had appeared in the same manner at the\r\nbeginning of the reign of the Empress Wu of the T’ang Dynasty (the most\r\nfamous woman ruler in Chinese history); the omen, she thought, showed\r\nclearly that the gods are on the side of China and against the barbarians.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the hour of the Sheep (1 P.M.) Kang Yi returned to the Palace,\r\nhe found Prince Ch’ing in the anteroom of the Grand Council, greatly\r\nexcited. It seems that En Hai,[77] a Manchu sergeant, had just come to\r\nhis residence and reported that he had shot and killed two foreigners\r\nwhom he had met, riding in sedan chairs that morning, just opposite the\r\nTsungpu Street. As orders had been issued by Prince Tuan and Ch’i Hsiu\r\nto the troops that all foreigners were to be shot wherever met, and as\r\none of these two was the German Minister, he hoped that Prince Ch’ing\r\nwould recommend him for special promotion. Prince Tuan had already heard\r\nthe news and was greatly pleased. Prince Ch’ing and Kang Yi discussed\r\nthe matter and decided to inform the Empress Dowager at once. Kang Yi\r\ndid not think that the death of one foreign devil, more or less, could\r\nmatter much, especially now that it had been decided to wipe out the\r\nLegations entirely, but Prince Ch’ing thought differently and reiterated\r\nhis opinion that the killing of an accredited Envoy is a serious matter.\r\nUntil now, only missionaries and their converts had been put to death,\r\nbut the murder of a Minister could not fail to arouse fierce indignation,\r\neven as it did in the case of the British negotiator[78] who was captured\r\nby our troops in the 10th year of Hsien-Feng (1860).\r\n\r\nThe Grand Council then entered the presence. Prince Li, as the senior\r\nmember of the Council, told the Old Buddha the news, but added that the\r\nforeigners had brought it on themselves because they had first fired on\r\nthe people. Upon hearing this Her Majesty ordered Jung Lu to be summoned\r\nin haste, but Kang Yi, being extremely busy with his work of providing\r\nsupplies for the Boxers, did not await his arrival.\r\n\r\nNow, even as I write, they tell me that bullets are whizzing and\r\nwhistling overhead; but I am too deaf to hear them. En Ch’u says that\r\nalready the Kansuh braves have begun the attack upon the Legations and\r\nthat Jung Lu’s endeavours to have the foreigners escorted to a place of\r\nsafety have completely failed.\r\n\r\nLiu Shun has just come in and asked for leave to go home for a week.\r\nPeople are leaving the city in all directions and in great numbers.\r\n\r\n_24th Day of the 5th Moon_: _the Hour of the Dog_, 7-9 P.M. (June 20th,\r\n1900).—En Ming has just come in to inform me that a foreign devil[79]\r\nhas been captured by Tung Fu-hsiang’s troops. They were taking him,\r\nwounded, to Prince Chuang’s Palace, prodding at him with their bayonets;\r\nand he was babbling in his foreign tongue. He will be decapitated, and\r\nhis captors will receive good rewards (Prince Ch’ing has just been given\r\ncommand of the gendarmerie). “The rut in which the cart was overturned\r\nis just ahead.” Let this be a warning to those puny barbarian ruffians,\r\nthe soldiery encamped at the very gates of the Palace. (_This alludes to\r\nthe proximity of the Legations to the Palace enclosure._) Jung Lu was all\r\nready to escort the foreigners to Tientsin; he had with him over 2,000\r\nManchu troops. Doubtless he means well, but the Old Buddha now says that\r\nshe will not prevent the Kansuh braves from destroying the Legations. If\r\nthe foreigners choose to leave with Jung Lu, let them do so, and they\r\nwill not be attacked; but if they insist upon remaining, then their\r\npunishment be upon their own heads, and “let them not say they were not\r\nforewarned.”\r\n\r\nDuke Lan sent over to invite me to breakfast with him to-morrow; he is\r\nsore pressed with business cares just now; nevertheless, he and his\r\nbrothers always treat their old teacher with politeness and respect.\r\nThough bellicose by nature, he is singularly gentle and refined. Chi\r\nPin[80] sent over to ask whether we would like to move to his house in\r\nthe north of the city, because the noise of the firing is very great in\r\nour quarter, but I am so deaf that I hear not a sound of it all.[81]\r\n\r\nChi Pin is writing to his father-in-law, Yü Hsien, about the audience in\r\nthe Palace.\r\n\r\nDuke Lan writes to tell me that this evening ⸺ informed Prince Tuan and\r\nChi Hsiu that, by the orders of that rascally Chinaman, Yüan Ch’ang,\r\nthe corpse of the foreign devil had been coffined. ⸺ wanted Prince Tuan\r\nto have the corpse decapitated and the head exhibited over the Tung An\r\nGate. Yüan Ch’ang defends his action, saying that he knew the German\r\nMinister personally at the Tsung Li Yamên, and he cannot bear the idea\r\nof leaving his body uncoffined. Mencius says, “It is common to all men\r\nto feel pity. No one can see a child fall into a well without a shudder\r\nof commiseration and horror.” But these Chinese traitors of ours are\r\ncompassionate to the enemies of our glorious Kingdom, and the foes of our\r\nancient race. It is passing strange!\r\n\r\n_25th Day of the 5th Moon: the Hour of the Monkey_, 3-5 P.M. (June\r\n21st).—My chair-bearers have fled from the city, so to-day I had to\r\nuse my cart to go to Duke Lan’s residence. Prince Tuan and the Grand\r\nSecretary, Kang Yi, were there; also Chung Li, lately Commandant of the\r\ngendarmerie, and the “Beileh” Tsai Lien. Prince Tuan had seen the Old\r\nBuddha this morning; their Majesties have moved from the Palace by the\r\nlake into the Forbidden City. As the Empress Dowager was crossing the\r\nroad which runs between the Gate of the Hsi Yüan (Western Park) and\r\nthe Hsi Hua Gate of the Forbidden City she saw that a number of Boxers\r\nhad lined up on each side of the street as a Guard of Honour for the\r\n“Sacred Chariot.” She presented them with 2,000 taels, congratulating\r\ntheir commander, Prince Chuang, on their stalwart appearance. Said\r\nthe Old Buddha to Prince Tuan, “The foreigners are like fish in the\r\nstew-pan. For forty years have I lain on brushwood and eaten bitterness\r\nbecause of them, nursing my revenge like Prince Kou Chien of the Yüeh\r\nState (5th Century B.C.). Never have I treated the foreigners otherwise\r\nthan generously; have I not invited their womenfolk to visit the Lake\r\nPalace? But now, if only the country will stand together, their defeat is\r\ncertain.”\r\n\r\nI think Prince Tuan hopes that the Old Buddha will now have the Ta-A-Ko\r\nproclaimed Emperor; but unfortunately the Nanking Viceroy, Liu K’un-yi,\r\nhas much influence over her in this matter. When he was in Peking this\r\nspring, in the second moon, he solemnly warned her against the Boxers and\r\nventured even to remonstrate at the Ta-A-Ko being made Heir Apparent.\r\nWere it not for Liu K’un Yi, he would have been Emperor long since;\r\ntherefore Prince Tuan has a very bitter hatred against him. Liu told the\r\nOld Buddha at his second audience that if H.M. Kuang Hsü were deposed,\r\nthe people of his province would assuredly rise in rebellion. What\r\nconcern is it of theirs who reigns in the Capital? His present Majesty’s\r\nreign has brought many misfortunes to the nation; it is high time that it\r\ncame to an end. Why does not Prince Tuan enter the Palace and proclaim\r\nhis son Emperor? Tung Fu-hsiang’s Kansuh braves and the Prince’s own\r\nManchu soldiery would surely rally round him. But if Jung Lu opposed\r\nthem the Old Buddha would side with him. His wife[82] is for ever in the\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\n_26th Day of the 5th Moon_ (June 22nd).—I went this morning to Prince\r\nLi’s palace in the western quarter of the city. I had to go in my small\r\ncart, because my chair-bearers have either run away to their homes in\r\nthe country or had joined the Boxers. My two sons, En Ch’u and En Ming,\r\nhave been making arrangements to quarter one hundred Boxers in our outer\r\ncourtyard, and it seems that we shall have to supply them with food.\r\nAlthough it cannot be denied that everyone should join in this noble work\r\nof exterminating the barbarians, I grudge, nevertheless, spending money\r\nin these hard times even for the Boxers, for rice is now become as dear\r\nas pearls, and firewood more precious than cassia buds. It may be that,\r\nin my old age, I am becoming like that Hsiao Lung, brother to the founder\r\nof the Liang Dynasty, who was so miserly that he stored up his money in\r\nheaps. On every heap of a million cash he would place a yellow label,\r\nwhile a purple label marked each hoard of ten millions. It is recorded\r\nof him, that his relatives abused him for this habit; as for me, my sons\r\nwould like to get at my money, but they cannot.\r\n\r\nI find Prince Li much depressed in his mind; his treasure vaults contain\r\nvast wealth; as senior member of the Grand Council, moreover, he feels\r\na weight of responsibility that is too much for him. His abilities are\r\ncertainly small, and I have never yet understood why the Old Buddha\r\nappointed him to succeed Prince Kung as senior Councillor. He tells me\r\nof a stormy meeting at the Grand Council this morning; it seems that Her\r\nMajesty is greatly annoyed with Liu K’un-yi for sending in a telegram\r\nstrongly denouncing the Boxers. He has also telegraphed privately to Jung\r\nLu, imploring him to check their rebellion, but no one knows what answer\r\nJung Lu has made.\r\n\r\nIn his telegram to the Empress Dowager, which came forward by express\r\ncouriers from Pao-ting-fu, the Viceroy declares that he would be more\r\nthan ready to march north with all his troops if it were to repel a\r\nforeign invasion, but he firmly declines to lend his forces for the\r\npurpose of massacring a few helpless foreigners. Commenting on this, the\r\nEmpress Dowager quoted the words of the Classic Historical Commentary\r\n(Tso Chüan): “The upper and lower jaws mutually assist each other; if\r\nthe lips shrivel, then must the teeth catch cold.” Thereby she meant\r\nto imply that even such, in its close interdependence, is the relation\r\nbetween the northern and southern parts of our Empire, and no one should\r\nknow this better than Liu K’un-yi, after his experiences at the time of\r\nthe Taiping Rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe Old Buddha has directed Prince Chuang, as head of the city\r\ngendarmerie, to issue a proclamation offering Tls. 50 for every head of a\r\nmale barbarian brought in, Tls. 40 for that of a woman, and Tls. 30 for\r\nthat of a child.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still talking with Prince Li, Jung Lu came over in his sedan\r\nchair to visit his kinsman. He looks very tired, and walks with a limp.\r\nHe was loud in denouncing the Boxers, who, he says, are quite incapable\r\nof doing any good. They had even now dared to shout abuse at him while\r\npassing the “Houmen,” calling him a Chinese traitor. I could not help\r\nthinking that Jung Lu deserved the name, but I did not say so. He is a\r\nstrong man, the strongest of all the Manchus, and I greatly fear that his\r\ninfluence may yet be able to wreck all our hopes.\r\n\r\nReturning to my house, I heard that the Princes Tuan and Chuang were\r\nsending troops to surround the French Cathedral, which is defended by\r\na few foreign soldiers only, and which should, therefore, be easily\r\ncaptured. Prince Li’s palace is within a stone’s throw of the cathedral,\r\nand to enter the Forbidden City he has to pass just south of it,\r\nthrough the “Hsi-Hua” gate. Although greatly disturbed by the impending\r\nhostilities in his neighbourhood, he fears to move to a quieter locality,\r\nlest, in his absence, his treasure vaults should be plundered. No doubt\r\nthe cathedral will fall in a few days.\r\n\r\nMy courtyard is now full of Boxers and Kansuh soldiery; I can no longer\r\ncall my house my own. How I loathe these cursed foreigners for causing\r\nall this disturbance!\r\n\r\n_The same Day: at the Hour of the Dog_ (7-9 P.M.).—I learn that Jung Lu\r\nhas just sent off a courier with a telegram, which Yüan Shih-k’ai is to\r\nsend on to the Viceroys of Canton, Nanking and Wucha’ng. Prince Li has\r\nsent me a copy, which I am to keep secret; it reads as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “With all respect I have received your telegrams. Where one\r\n    weak people dares to oppose ten or more powerful nations, the\r\n    inevitable result can only be complete ruin. It has always been\r\n    maintained as a fixed principle with civilised nations, that,\r\n    in the event of war between any two Powers, their respective\r\n    Envoys should be treated with respect. Can it now be that\r\n    this our great inheritance, founded by our remote ancestors\r\n    at so great a cost of toil and danger, is to be endangered,\r\n    and suddenly brought to ruin, by these false workers of magic?\r\n    Shall the fate of the Dynasty be staked on a single throw?\r\n    It requires no peculiar sagacity to see that these Boxers’\r\n    hopes of success are nothing but the shadow of a dream. It is\r\n    true and undeniable, that, from their Majesties on the Throne\r\n    down to the very lowest of our people, all have suffered from\r\n    the constant aggression of foreigners and their unceasing\r\n    insults. For this reason these patriotic train-bands have been\r\n    organised, claiming a divine mission of retaliation; but the\r\n    present crisis is all-serious, and although I have used every\r\n    effort to explain its dangers, I have laboured in vain. I am\r\n    sick and suffering from lameness, but since I obtained leave\r\n    of absence I have already submitted seven separate memorials\r\n    denouncing these Boxers. Seeing that they produced no result,\r\n    I have now left my sick bed, in order, if possible, to explain\r\n    the situation clearly to their Majesties; and this also has\r\n    been in vain.\r\n\r\n    “All the Princes and Ministers of State who surround the Throne\r\n    now cry out against me with one voice, as your Excellencies\r\n    can readily believe. I dare not quote in this place the words\r\n    of Her Majesty, but I may say that the whole of the Imperial\r\n    family have joined the Boxers, and at least two-thirds of our\r\n    troops, both Manchu and Chinese, are with them. They swarm in\r\n    the streets of our capital like a plague of locusts, and it\r\n    will be extremely difficult to disperse them.\r\n\r\n    “Even the divine wisdom of Her Majesty is not sufficient to\r\n    stand against the will of the majority. If Heaven is not on\r\n    our side, how can I oppose its will? For several days past\r\n    I have been pondering night and day on some way out of our\r\n    difficulties, some forlorn hope of escape. Therefore yesterday\r\n    morning (June 20th) I arranged for a meeting with the foreign\r\n    Ministers at the Tsung Li Yamên, with a view to providing\r\n    a safe conduct for the entire foreign community, with my\r\n    own troops, to Tientsin. This course appeared to me to hold\r\n    out some reasonable chances of success, but Prince Tuan’s\r\n    soldiery slew the German Minister, and since then the situation\r\n    continues to develop from hour to hour with such extraordinary\r\n    rapidity that words fail me to describe it. On my side, in the\r\n    discussions of the Grand Council and the Chamberlains of the\r\n    Presence, are Prince Ch’ing and Wang Wen-shao, but the former,\r\n    following his usual practice, has applied for leave, and Her\r\n    Majesty will have nothing to do with him; so that these two\r\n    are of no real assistance to me. I have no fear of death, but\r\n    I grieve at the thought of the guilt which will be recorded\r\n    against me in history; Heaven knows that I am overwhelmed with\r\n    grief and shame. I have received great favours at the hands\r\n    of the Throne, and can only now pray to the spirits of the\r\n    Dynastic ancestors to protect our Empire. The situation here\r\n    is well-nigh lost, but it remains for your Excellencies to\r\n    take all possible steps for the protection of your respective\r\n    provinces. Let each do his utmost, and let proper secrecy be\r\n    maintained.” Signed “Jung Lu, with tears in his eyes.”\r\n\r\nIt is reported from the Grand Council that Chang Chih-tung has\r\ntelegraphed to Her Majesty, assuring her of his devotion and loyalty, and\r\nasking whether he should come north with his troops to help in the work\r\nof destroying the barbarians. Chang is a time-server, and loves not the\r\nEmperor;[83] we have not forgotten how he approved the Decree appointing\r\nan Heir Apparent, and how he would have been a party to His Majesty’s\r\nremoval from the Throne, justifying himself on quibbling grounds of\r\nlegality and precedents as to the lawful succession. He trims his\r\nsails according to the wind of the moment, and has no courage of fixed\r\nprinciples, like Liu K’un-yi. I despise the latter’s views in opposing\r\nthe Boxers, but no one can help admiring his upright character.\r\n\r\n(_At this point the diarist proceeds to give a full account of the rise\r\nand spread of the Boxer movement, describing in detail their magic rites,\r\ntheir incantations, and their ceremonies of initiation. The facts have\r\nnearly all been published before, so that most of this portion of the\r\nDiary is here omitted. It is chiefly interesting as showing to what\r\nheights of superstition even the most educated of the Manchus, including\r\nthe Empress Dowager, could go. We give one example only of the farrago of\r\ngibberish which, believed in high quarters, nearly brought about the end\r\nof the Dynasty._)\r\n\r\nThe Boxers also possess a secret Talisman, consisting of a small piece of\r\nyellow paper, which they carry on their persons when going into battle.\r\nOn it is drawn, in vermilion paint, a figure which is neither that of\r\nman nor devil, demon nor saint. It has a head, but no feet; its face is\r\nsharp-pointed, with eyes and eyebrows, and four halos. From the monster’s\r\nheart to its lower extremities runs a mystic inscription, which reads:\r\n“I am Buddha of the cold cloud; before me lies the black deity of fire;\r\nbehind is Laotzu himself.” On the creature’s body are also borne the\r\ncharacters for Buddha, Tiger, and Dragon. On the top left-hand corner are\r\nthe words “invoke first the Guardian of Heaven,” and on the right-hand\r\ncorner, “invoke next the black gods of pestilence.” The Empress Dowager\r\nhas learned this incantation by heart, and repeats it seventy times\r\ndaily, and every time that she repeats it the chief eunuch (Li Lien-ying)\r\nshouts: “There goes one more foreign devil.” The Boxers determine the\r\nfate of their victims by a curious test, which consists of burning a\r\nball of paper, and seeing whether the ashes ascend or remain upon the\r\nground. They may believe that it is the spirits who decide, but, as\r\na matter of fact, these balls of paper are sometimes made of thinner\r\nmaterial, which naturally leave a lighter ash that is easily caught up in\r\nthe air; whereas, when they use thick paper, the ashes seldom rise. Some\r\nof the balls are also more tightly rolled than others, and it is quite\r\nevident that the ashes of the loose ones have a much better chance of\r\nblowing away than those which are tightly rolled. Similarly, when they\r\nset fire to any place, they profess to be guided by their gods, and they\r\nsay that fire leaps forth at the point of their swords in any quarter\r\nwhich the spirits desire to have destroyed. As a matter of fact, however,\r\nthere is deception practised in this also, for when they wish to burn\r\nany place for purposes of plunder they have it sprinkled in advance with\r\nkerosene oil, and if no oil is available, they even pile up brushwood\r\naround it, upon which they drop a lighted match secreted upon their\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n_27th Day of the 5th Moon_ (June 23rd).—The foreign barbarian of whom I\r\nhave written[84] was executed this morning at the hour of the Hare (6\r\nA.M.) and his head is now exhibited in a cage, hanging from the main beam\r\nof the “Tung-An” gate. It had to be put in a cage, as there was no queue\r\nto hang it by. The face has a most horrible expression, but it is a fine\r\nthing, all the same, to see a foreigner’s head hung up at our palace\r\ngates. It brings back to memory the heads that I saw outside the Board\r\nof Punishments in the tenth year of Hsien-Feng (1860), but there were\r\nblack devils among those. Jung Lu tried to save the barbarian’s life, and\r\neven intended to rescue him by force, but the Princes Tuan and Chuang had\r\ndetermined upon his death, and they had him executed before Jung Lu knew\r\nit, so that, when his men arrived upon the scene, the foreigner’s head\r\nhad already parted company from his body. The Princes had him kneeling\r\nbefore them yesterday for several hours on a chain, and all the time he\r\nkept on imploring them to spare his life; his groans were most painful\r\nto hear. The Old Buddha has been informed of his death, and she gave\r\norders that Tls. 500 be distributed to the soldiers who had captured him,\r\n_i.e._ a reward ten times greater than that which was promised in the\r\nproclamations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TA-A-KO, SON OF PRINCE TUAN, THE BOXER LEADER.\r\n\r\nAppointed Heir-Apparent in January, 1900. Appointment rescinded November,\r\n1901.]\r\n\r\nThe Boxers who occupy my courtyard tried to take away my cigars from\r\nme, but subsequently relented and allowed me to keep them because of my\r\nextreme old age. Nothing of foreign origin, not even matches, may be used\r\nnowadays, and these Boxer chiefs, Chang Te-ch’eng and Han Yi-li, both of\r\nwhom are common and uneducated men, are treated with the greatest respect\r\neven by Princes of the blood: a curious state of affairs indeed!\r\n\r\nDuke Tsai Lan came to see me this afternoon. He tells me an extraordinary\r\nstory how that the Heir Apparent called the Emperor a “Devil’s pupil”\r\nthis morning, and, when rebuked for it, actually boxed His Majesty’s\r\nears. The Emperor then reported the facts in a memorial to Her Majesty,\r\nwho flew into a towering rage, and gave orders to the eunuch Ts’ui to\r\nadminister twenty sharp strokes of the whip on the Heir Apparent’s\r\nperson. Prince Tuan is much enraged at this, but he is horribly afraid of\r\nHer Majesty, and, when she speaks to him, “he is on tenter-hooks, as if\r\nthorns pricked him, and the sweat runs down his face.”\r\n\r\nT’ung Fu-hsiang told the Empress Dowager yesterday that the Legations\r\nhave come to the end of their tether. From a rockery on some high ground\r\nin the Forbidden City gardens, the Old Buddha could see the flames\r\nbursting from the Legation quarter, and was more than once assured that\r\nfinal destruction had come upon the foreigners at last. But later in the\r\nafternoon, Hsü Ching-ch’eng was received in audience, when he presented a\r\nmemorial which he and Yüan Chang had drawn up, denouncing the Boxers; he\r\ntold Her Majesty that it was not the Legations, but the Han Lin Academy,\r\nthat was in flames, the Kansuh soldiery having set fire to it in the hope\r\nthat the conflagration might spread and thus enable them to force a way\r\ninto the Legation. Her Majesty was greatly disappointed and displeased,\r\nseverely blaming Tung Fu-hsiang, and she sent for Jung Lu and talked with\r\nhim in private for a long while.\r\n\r\nGood news has come in to-day of victorious fighting at Tientsin; Yü Lu\r\nreports that many foreigners were slain in their attack on the Taku\r\nforts, and several of their warships sunk. Practically the whole of the\r\nforeign community of Tientsin had been annihilated, he says.\r\n\r\nMany hundreds of Chinese Christians were put to death to-day just outside\r\nPrince Chuang’s palace. The judges who convicted them were Prince Chuang,\r\nYi Ku, Fen Che, and Kuei Ch’un. There was no mercy shown, and a large\r\nnumber of innocent people perished with the guilty. The Empress is\r\nessentially a kind-hearted woman, and she was greatly shocked to hear of\r\nthis wholesale massacre. She was heard to say that if the Catholics would\r\nonly recant and reform, a way of escape might very well be provided for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_29th Day of the 5th Moon_ (June 25th).—To-day about sixty of the\r\nBoxers, led by the Princes Tuan and Chuang, and the “Beilehs” Tsai Lien\r\nand Tsai Ying, marched to the Palace at 6 o’clock in the morning to\r\nsearch there for converts. Coming to the gate of the Palace of Peaceful\r\nLongevity, where their Majesties were still abed, they noisily clamoured\r\nfor the Emperor to come out, denouncing him as a friend of foreigners.\r\nPrince Tuan was their spokesman. I heard of the incident from Wen Lien,\r\nComptroller of the Household, who was on duty this morning; he was amazed\r\nat the foolhardy effrontery of Prince Tuan, and thought that he had\r\nprobably been drinking. On hearing the noise outside and the shouts of\r\nthe Boxers clamouring to kill all “Devil’s pupils,” the Old Buddha, who\r\nwas taking her early tea, came out swiftly and stood at the head of the\r\nsteps, while the Princes and the Boxer leaders swarmed in the court-yard\r\nbelow her. She asked Prince Tuan whether he had come to look upon himself\r\nas the Emperor; if not, how dared he behave in this reckless and insolent\r\nmanner? She would have him know that she, and she alone, had power to\r\ncreate or depose the Sovereign, and she would have him remember that the\r\npower which had made his son Heir Apparent could also wipe him out in\r\na moment. If he and his fellow Princes thought that because the State\r\nwas at a crisis of confusion they could follow their own inclinations\r\nin matters of this kind, they would find themselves very seriously\r\nmistaken. She bade them depart, and refrain from ever again entering\r\nthe palace precincts, except when summoned to her presence on duty. But\r\nthey would first prostrate themselves and ask His Majesty’s pardon for\r\ntheir insolent behaviour. As a slight punishment for their offences, she\r\nfurther commanded that the Princes be mulcted of a year’s allowances. As\r\nto the Boxer chiefs, who had dared to create this uproar in her hearing,\r\nthey should be decapitated upon the spot, and Jung Lu’s guards, who were\r\non duty at the outer gates, were ordered to carry this sentence into\r\nimmediate effect. Her Majesty is so greatly incensed against the Boxers\r\nat this moment that everyone thinks that Jung Lu will now be able to put\r\na stop to the attacks on the Legations. The Emperor was much alarmed at\r\nthis incident, and when it was over humbly thanked Her Majesty for so\r\nbenevolently protecting him.\r\n\r\n_Later_; 9 P.M.—The Old Buddha has suddenly determined, in her rage\r\nagainst Prince Tuan and his followers, to put a stop to the fighting in\r\nPeking, and she now agrees that Jung Lu shall proceed to the Legations\r\nto discuss terms of peace. At 6 P.M. to-day all firing stopped, and Jung\r\nLu, at the head of his troops, proceeded to the bridge which lies on\r\nthe north of the Legation quarter. The foreigners came out from their\r\nhiding-places and commenced to parley; they were shown a board, and on\r\nit the words written: “Orders have now been received from the Empress\r\nDowager to afford due protection to the Legations.” Jung Lu hoped to be\r\nable to induce the foreign Ministers to confer with him for the purpose\r\nof restoring order. For three hours not a shot has been fired; but En\r\nMing has just come in to tell me that the situation has again changed,\r\nand that the Old Buddha has heard such good accounts of the defeat of\r\nthe foreign relief force on its way to Peking that she is once more\r\ndetermined to give the Boxers their head and “to eat the flesh and sleep\r\non the skins” of the foreign devils.\r\n\r\n_4th Day of the 6th Moon: at the Hour of the Dog_, 7 P.M. (June 30,\r\n1900).—Kang Yi called to-day, and remained with me for the evening meal.\r\nHe tells me that Tung Fu-hsiang called in person this morning on Jung Lu\r\nat his residence, and asked him for the loan of the heavy artillery which\r\nis under his orders. Jung Lu is said to have ample armaments in stock\r\nin the city, the property of the Wu Wei-chün (Military Defence Corps)\r\nsufficient to knock every foreign building to pieces in a few hours.\r\n\r\nTung was kept waiting at Jung Lu’s door for over an hour; when finally\r\nadmitted, he began to bluster, whereupon Jung Lu feigned sleep. “He\r\ngave no consent, but leant on his seat and slumbered.”[85] Tung then\r\nexpostulated with Jung Lu for his rudeness, but the Commander-in-chief\r\nonly smiled, and brought the interview to an end by remarking that Tung’s\r\nonly way to get the guns would be to persuade the Old Buddha to give him\r\nJung Lu’s head with them. “Apply for an audience at once,” he said. “She\r\nbelieves you to be a brave man and will certainly comply with any request\r\nyou may make.”\r\n\r\nTung Fu-hsiang left in a towering rage, and made straight for the\r\nForbidden City, although the hour for audiences was long since past. At\r\nthe gate of the Hall of Imperial Supremacy (Huang Chi-tien) he made a\r\nloud disturbance, bidding the eunuchs inform Her Majesty that the Kansuh\r\nCommander-in-chief was without, desiring audience. It so happened that\r\nthe Old Buddha was engaged in painting a design of bamboos on silk, and\r\nshe was highly displeased at being thus disturbed. Tung was ushered in,\r\nhowever, and fell on his knees. “Well,” said Her Majesty, “I suppose\r\nthat you have come to report the complete destruction of the Legations?\r\nThis will be the tenth time since the end of last Moon.” “I have come,”\r\nreplied Tung Fu-hsiang, “to ask Your Majesty’s permission to impeach the\r\nGrand Secretary Jung Lu as a traitor and the friend of barbarians. He has\r\nthe guns which my army needs; with their aid not a stone would be left\r\nstanding in the whole of the Legation quarter. But he has sworn never to\r\nlend these guns, even though Your Majesty should command it.” Angrily\r\nthe Old Buddha replied, “Be silent. You were nothing but a brigand to\r\nbegin with, and if I allowed you to enter my army it was only to give\r\nyou an opportunity of atoning for your former misdeeds. Even now you are\r\nbehaving like a brigand, forgetting the majesty of the Imperial Presence.\r\nOf a truth, your tail is becoming too heavy to wag. Leave the Palace\r\nforthwith, and do not let me find you here again unless summoned to\r\naudience.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reproduction of Picture painted on Silk, by Her Majesty\r\nTzŭ Hsi.]\r\n\r\nKang Yi declares that we shall never take the Legations so long as Jung\r\nLu continues to exercise his present great influence at Court. Li Shan,\r\nwho is also a great favourite of the Empress Dowager, is now on the side\r\nof those who would make peace with the foreigners, and has been impeached\r\nfor it by Na T’ung.\r\n\r\nThe following proclamation is now placarded all over the city, in\r\naccordance with the Empress Dowager’s orders issued to Prince Chuang.\r\nThey say that she means to pay the rewards from her own privy purse:\r\n\r\n    “REWARDS.\r\n\r\n    “Now that all foreign churches and chapels have been razed to\r\n    the ground, and that no place of refuge or concealment is left\r\n    for the foreigners, they must unavoidably scatter, flying in\r\n    every direction. Be it therefore known and announced to all\r\n    men, scholars and volunteers, that any person found guilty of\r\n    harbouring foreigners will incur the penalty of decapitation.\r\n    For every male foreigner taken alive a reward of 50 taels will\r\n    be given; for every female 40 taels, and for every child 30\r\n    taels; but it is to be clearly understood that they shall be\r\n    taken alive, and that they shall be genuine foreigners. Once\r\n    this fact has been duly authenticated, the reward will be paid\r\n    without delay. A special proclamation, requiring reverent\r\n    obedience.”\r\n\r\nMuch larger rewards than these were paid in the tenth year of Hsieng-Feng\r\n(1860) for the heads of barbarians, but of course in those days they were\r\ncomparatively rare, whereas now, alas, they have become as common as bees!\r\n\r\nThis morning an important trial took place outside the gate of Prince\r\nChuang’s palace; Yi Ku, Fen Che, and Kuei Ch’un presided. Over nine\r\nhundred people were summarily executed by the Boxers, in some cases\r\nbefore any proofs whatsoever had been substantiated in regard to their\r\nalleged connection with foreigners. Helpless babes even were amongst\r\nthe slain. Fen Che is nothing more than a butcher and the Old Buddha\r\nremonstrated with Prince Chuang for not keeping the Boxers in better\r\norder.\r\n\r\n_8th Day of the 6th Moon_, 11 A.M. (July 4th).—Yü Hsien’s son-in-law, Chi\r\nShou-ch’eng, came and talked with me for a long while. The bombardment\r\nof the city was going on all the time he was here, and to the south of\r\nmy house, close to the Imperial City Wall, the troops of Li Ping-heng\r\nwere mounting cannon on an elevated platform. They are all still very\r\nwroth with Jung Lu, who refuses to lend his guns, and his troops are so\r\nfaithful to him that it is impossible to bribe them to disobey him. Jung\r\nLu’s courage is really extraordinary; he said of himself lately, that\r\n“in the days of the wicked Ruler (meaning Prince Tuan) he bided his time\r\non the shores of the bleak North Sea, awaiting the purification of the\r\nEmpire.”[86] I am told that Prince Tuan has taken possession of one of\r\nthe Imperial Seals, so as to be able to proclaim his son Emperor at the\r\nfirst favourable opportunity; but if the Old Buddha finds this out, as\r\nmost probably she will, there is trouble ahead for Prince Tuan.\r\n\r\nChi Shou-ch’eng tells me that Yü Hsien has sent in a memorial to the\r\nEmpress Dowager with reference to the missionaries in Shansi. Ten days\r\nago she had sent him a secret Decree, saying, “Slay all foreigners\r\nwheresoever you find them; even though they be prepared to leave your\r\nprovince, yet must they be slain.” It seems that the Old Buddha ordered\r\nthat this Decree should be sent to every high provincial official in the\r\nEmpire, but it is now reported that Tuan Fang, the acting governor of\r\nShensi, and Yü Chang, governor of Honan, together with the high officials\r\nin Mongolia, received the Edict in a very different form, for the word\r\n“slay” had been changed to “protect.” It is feared that some treacherous\r\nminister is responsible for this, but no one dares inform Her Majesty.\r\nTo Yü Hsien’s latest memorial, she has made the following reply, which\r\nhas been sent by the fastest express riders to T’ai-Yüan fu:—“I command\r\nthat all foreigners—men, women, and children, old and young—be summarily\r\nexecuted. Let not one escape, so that my Empire may be purged of this\r\nnoisome source of corruption, and that peace may be restored to my loyal\r\nsubjects.” Chi Shou-ch’eng tells me that Yü Hsien’s bitterness against\r\nforeigners is inspired by his wife, of whom he is greatly afraid.\r\nHe himself has earned golden opinions in T’ai-Yüan during his short\r\nadministration, and has a high reputation for even-handed justice. He\r\nsays also that this last Decree gave pleasure to Prince Chuang; Jung Lu\r\ntried to stop it, asking the Old Buddha what glory could China expect\r\nto gain by the slaughter of women and children. “We should become the\r\nlaughing-stock of the world,” he said, “and the Old Buddha’s widespread\r\nfame and reputation for benevolence would be grievously injured.” “Yes,”\r\nreplied the Empress Dowager, “but these foreigners of yours wish to see\r\nme deposed, and I am only paying off old scores. Ever since the days of\r\nTao-Kuang this uproarious guest within our borders has been maltreating\r\nhis hosts, and it is time that all should know who is the real master of\r\nthe house.”\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon the Empress Dowager crossed over to the Lake Palace\r\nfor a water picnic, attended by several ladies of the Court. The\r\ncontinuous bombardment of the French cathedral eventually made her head\r\nache, so she despatched a chamberlain to the officer commanding at the\r\nHsi-Hua Gate, ordering them to cease firing until her return to the\r\nForbidden City.\r\n\r\n_11th Day of the 6th Moon_ (7th July).—Yü Lu has sent in a ridiculous\r\nmemorial, reporting the capture of four camels, as well as the killing of\r\nmany foreigners, in Tientsin. Jung Lu has advised him to cease attacking\r\nthe foreign Settlements. Talking of Jung Lu, I hear that Tung Fu-hsiang\r\nrecently hired a Manchu soldier to assassinate him, but, instead of\r\ndoing so, the man betrayed the plot to Jung Lu. This soldier turns out\r\nto be a brother of that En Hai who slew the foreign devil (Baron von\r\nKetteler), and Tung thought therefore that he would gladly do anything\r\nto assist in destroying the Legations. But he is a clansman of Jung Lu’s\r\nbanner, and, like Yü Kung-ssŭ, whom Mencius called the best archer in\r\nWei, “he could not bear to slay the old Chief who had taught him the\r\narts of war.” Jung Lu has again memorialised the Old Buddha, reminding\r\nher of that well-known saying in the Spring and Autumn annals,[87] which\r\nlays down that the persons of foreign Envoys are always inviolate within\r\nthe territories of any civilised State. This attack on the Legation, he\r\nsays, is worse than an outrage; it is a piece of stupidity which will\r\nbe remembered against China for all time. Her Majesty appeared to think\r\nthat, because a small nation like the Transvaal could conquer a great\r\nPower like England, China must necessarily be even more successful in\r\nfighting the whole world; but there was no analogy between the two cases.\r\nIf peace were to be made at once, the situation might still be saved; but\r\nif the Legations were demolished, there must be an end of Manchu rule. He\r\nwarned Her Majesty solemnly, and she appears to be gradually coming to\r\nlook at things from his point of view. These Boxers can certainly talk,\r\nbut they do very little.\r\n\r\nBad news has reached the palace to-day of the fighting around Tientsin,\r\nand Her Majesty is most anxious about it, though she still refuses to\r\nbelieve that the foreign brigands can possibly enter Peking.\r\n\r\n_15th Day of the 6th Moon_ (11th July).—My neighbour Wen Lien,\r\nComptroller-General of the Imperial Household, tells me that the Old\r\nBuddha is in a furious rage. She finds the heat trying, and yesterday she\r\nturned on the Heir Apparent and snubbed him badly for impertinence; he\r\nhad asked if he might be permitted to escort her to Jehol, leaving the\r\nEmperor to settle matters with his foreign friends in Peking. One of the\r\nyoung eunuchs tried to mollify her by reporting, whenever the report of\r\na gun was heard, that another foreign devil had been killed, but as the\r\nOld Buddha observed, “there has been enough firing for the past few weeks\r\nto kill off every foreigner in China several times, and so far there is\r\nhardly anything to show for it.”\r\n\r\n_17th Day of the 6th Moon_ (13th July).—Jung Lu asked Her Majesty\r\nyesterday what she would do if the Boxers were defeated, and if Peking\r\nwere captured by the foreigners. In reply, she quoted to him the words\r\nof Chia Yi, a sophist of the Han dynasty, in reference to the Court’s\r\ndiplomatic dealings with the Khan of the Hans:—\r\n\r\n    “If the Emperor wishes to gain the allegiance of other\r\n    countries, he can only do so by convincing their rulers that\r\n    he possesses the three cardinal virtues of government, and by\r\n    displaying the five allurements.\r\n\r\n    These allurements are: (1) Presents of chariots and rich robes,\r\n    to tempt the eye; (2) rich food and banquets, to tempt the\r\n    palate; (3) musical maidens, to tempt the ear; (4) fine houses\r\n    and beautiful women, to tempt the instinct of luxury; and (5)\r\n    the presence of the Emperor at the table of the foreign ruler,\r\n    to tempt his pride.\r\n\r\n    The three cardinal virtues of government are: (1) to simulate\r\n    affection; (2) to express honeyed sentiments; and (3) to treat\r\n    one’s inferiors as equals.”\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, said the Empress, she had invited the foreign ladies to\r\nher Court, and had noticed their delight at the reception she gave them,\r\nalthough she well knew that their sympathies were with the Emperor, and\r\nagainst her. She would again allure them to her side with rich gifts and\r\nhoneyed words.[88]\r\n\r\n_20th Day of the 6th Moon_ (16th July).—Bad news from Yü Lu; Tientsin\r\nhas been captured by the foreigners, who now swarm like locusts. Not\r\none of the Grand Councillors dared to carry the news to Her Majesty, so\r\nPrince Tuan went in boldly, and informed her that the foreign devils had\r\ntaken the city, because the Boxers had been negligent in the performance\r\nof their prescribed rites; Peking, however, would always be perfectly\r\nsafe from invasion. Early this morning Jung Lu had informed the Old\r\nBuddha that he had ascertained beyond doubt that the document, which\r\npurported to come from the Foreign Ministers, demanding her abdication,\r\nwas a forgery. It had been prepared by Lien Wen-chung, a Secretary of\r\nthe Grand Council, at Prince Tuan’s orders. The Old Buddha was therefore\r\nin no soft mood; angrily she told Prince Tuan that, if the foreigners\r\nentered Peking, he would certainly lose his head. She was quite aware of\r\nhis motives; he wanted to secure the Regency, but she bade him beware,\r\nfor, so long as she lived, there could be no other Regent. “Let him be\r\ncareful, or his son would be expelled from the palace, and the family\r\nestates confiscated to the throne.” His actions had indeed been worthy of\r\nthe dog’s[89] name he bore. Prince Tuan left the palace, and was heard to\r\nremark that “the thunderbolt had fallen too quickly for him to close his\r\nears.”\r\n\r\nJung Lu has won over all the military commanders except Tung Fu-hsiang\r\nand his staff, and they have come to a general understanding that the\r\nbombardment of the Legations must cease. Jung Lu has explained, as his\r\nreason for not allowing the heavy artillery to be used, that it would\r\ninevitably have inflicted serious damage on the Imperial shrines and the\r\nAncestral temple.\r\n\r\nThe Old Buddha is sending presents to the Legations, water-melons, wine,\r\nvegetables, and ice, and she has expressed a wish that Prince Ch’ing\r\nshould go and see the Foreign Ministers.\r\n\r\nThey say that Hsü Ching-ch’eng is secretly communicating with the\r\nLegations.\r\n\r\nA messenger with twelve dispatches from the Legations was captured to-day\r\nand taken to Prince Chuang’s Palace. Three of the twelve were in cipher\r\nand could not be translated by the Tsung Li Yamên interpreter, but from\r\nthe others it was learned that the foreigners had lost over a hundred\r\nkilled and wounded and that their provisions were running very low.\r\n\r\nChi Shou-ch’eng has gone to T’ai-Yüan fu to see Yü Hsien, his\r\nfather-in-law. The latter has memorialised the Throne, reporting that he\r\ncunningly entrapped all the foreigners, cast them into chains and had\r\nevery one decapitated in his Yamên. Only one woman had escaped, after her\r\nbreasts had been cut off, and had hidden herself under the City wall. She\r\nwas dead when they found her.\r\n\r\nRain has fallen very heavily to-day. Liu Ta-chiao brought me 8 lbs. of\r\npork from the Palace kitchen, and I sent a large bowl of it to my married\r\nsister. Towards evening a detachment of cavalry, with several guns,\r\npassed my door. They were Li Ping-heng’s men, on their way to mount these\r\nguns on a platform above the Forbidden City wall, as a precaution against\r\nsorties by the foreigners. There has been heavy firing all night, and it\r\nis reported that foreign devils have been seen in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Ha-Ta Men.\r\n\r\n_21st Day of the 6th Moon_ (17th July).—A lovely day. I walked over\r\nto call on Prince Li and Duke Lan. The latest rumour is that Yü Lu’s\r\ntroops are in flight and harrying the country side. They are said to be\r\nclamouring for their pay, which is months in arrears, and have plundered\r\nboth Tungchou and Chang Chia-wan most thoroughly. Both the eastern gates\r\nof the City are now kept closed, and the northern gate (Anting men) is\r\nonly opened occasionally.\r\n\r\nYang Shun, the gate-keeper, has returned from his home at Pao-ti hsien,\r\neast of Peking, where he reports things fairly quiet.\r\n\r\nLi Ping-heng’s troops are reported to have won a great victory and driven\r\nthe barbarians to the sea. Nevertheless, heavy firing was heard to the\r\nsouth-eastward this afternoon.\r\n\r\nDuke Lan has gone out with a large force of Boxers to search for converts\r\nreported to be in hiding in the temple of the Sun.\r\n\r\n_27th Day of the 6th Moon_ (23rd July).—This morning Yüan Ch’ang and Hsü\r\nChing-ch’eng handed in the third of their Memorials against the Boxers,\r\nin which they recommend the execution of several members of the Grand\r\nCouncil. Their valour seems to be more laudable than their discretion,\r\nespecially as the Old Buddha is disposed once more to believe in the\r\nBoxers as the result of Li Ping-heng’s audience with her yesterday. He\r\ncame up from Hankow, and has now been appointed joint Commander, with\r\nJung Lu, of the army of the North. He confidently assured her of his\r\nability to take the Legations by storm, and repeatedly said that never\r\nagain would the tutelary deities of the Dynasty suffer her to be driven\r\nforth, in humiliation, from her capital.\r\n\r\nI went across to Duke Lan’s house this morning and found Prince Tuan\r\nand Li Ping-heng there. They were busy planning a renewed attack on\r\nthe Legations, and Li was strongly in favour of mining from the Hanlin\r\nAcademy side. He has advised the Empress Dowager that a mine should be\r\nsprung, as was done lately at the French Cathedral, and he is convinced\r\nthat in the ensuing confusion the foreigners would be easily overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the latest Memorial of Hsü and Yüan, the Old Buddha\r\nobserved, “These are brave men. I have never cared much for Hsü, but Yüan\r\nbehaved well in 1898 and warned me about K’ang Yu-wei and his plotting.\r\nBe that as it may, however, they have no business to worry me with these\r\npersistent and querulous questions. The Throne itself is fully competent\r\nto judge the character of its servants, and it is a gross misconception\r\nof duty for ‘the acolyte to stride across the sacred vessels and show\r\nthe priest how to slaughter the sacrificial beasts.’[90] Desiring to\r\ndeal leniently with the Memorialists, I command that my censure be\r\ncommunicated to them and that they take heed to refrain in future from\r\ntroubling my ears with their petulant complainings.”\r\n\r\n_3rd Day of the 7th Moon_ (28th July).—The Old Buddha places much\r\nconfidence in Li Ping-heng. Yesterday he and Kang Yi discovered that\r\nthe word “to slay,” in Her Majesty’s Decree ordering the extermination\r\nof all foreigners, had been altered to “protect” by Yüan Ch’ang and Hsü\r\nChing-ch’eng. I have just seen Kang Yi, and he says that Her Majesty’s\r\nface was divine in its wrath. “They deserve the punishment meted out\r\nto Kao Ch’u-mi,”[91] she said, “their limbs should be torn asunder\r\nby chariots driven in opposite directions. Let them be summarily\r\ndecapitated.” An Edict was forthwith issued, but no mention is made in\r\nit of the alteration of the Decree, as this is a matter affecting the\r\nnation’s prestige; the offenders are denounced only for having created\r\ndissensions in the Palace and favoured the cause of the foreigner. Both\r\nwere executed this morning; my son, En Ming, witnessed their death. It\r\nis most painful to me to think of the end of Yüan Ch’ang, for he had\r\nmany sterling qualities; as for Hsü, I knew him in the days when we were\r\ncolleagues at the Grand Secretariat, and I never had a high opinion of\r\nthe man. His corruption was notorious. Just before the sword of the\r\nexecutioner fell, Yüan remarked that “he hoped that the Sun might soon\r\nreturn to its place in the Heaven, and that the usurping Comet might be\r\ndestroyed.” By this he meant that Prince Tuan’s malign influence had led\r\nthe Empress Dowager to act against her own better instincts. Duke Lan,\r\nwho was superintending the execution, angrily bade him be silent for a\r\ntraitor, but Yüan fearlessly went on, “I die innocent. In years to come\r\nmy name will be remembered with gratitude and respect, long after you\r\nevil-plotting Princes have met your well-deserved doom.” Turning then to\r\nHsü, he said, “We shall meet anon at the Yellow Springs.[92] To die is\r\nonly to come home.” Duke Lan stepped forward as if to strike him, and the\r\nheadsman quickly despatched them both.\r\n\r\n_8th Day of the 7th Moon_ (3rd August).—I have had much trouble with my\r\neldest son to-day. He has been robbing me lately of large sums, and when\r\nI rebuked him he had the audacity to reply that my duty to the Throne\r\nwould make my suicide a fitting return for the benefits which I have\r\nreceived at its hands.\r\n\r\nLi Ping-heng has gone to the front to rally the troops and check the\r\nforeigners’ advance. He has impeached Jung Lu but the Old Buddha has\r\nsuppressed the Memorial. The Emperor thanked Jung Lu for his services,\r\nand the Commander-in-Chief replied that he of all the servants of the\r\nThrone never expected to receive praise from His Majesty, considering the\r\nevents of the past two years.[93]\r\n\r\n_11th Day of the 7th Moon_ (5th August).—The Old Buddha has commanded\r\nJung Lu to arrange for escorting the foreigners to Tientsin, so that the\r\nadvance of the Allies may be stopped. In this connection, I hear that\r\nnot many days ago, ⸺ persuaded Ch’i Hsiu to have a letter sent to the\r\nForeign Ministers, inviting them to come, without escort of troops, to\r\nan interview with the Tsung Li Yamên, his idea being to have them all\r\nmassacred on the way. Ch’i Hsiu thought the suggestion excellent, but,\r\nalthough several letters have been sent proposing it, the Ministers\r\ndecline to leave the Legations. Meanwhile, there have been several fresh\r\nattacks on the Legations during the past few days.\r\n\r\nA foreign devil, half naked, was found yesterday in Hatamen Street.\r\nHe kowtowed to everyone he met, high class or low, imploring even the\r\nrag-pickers to spare his life and give him a few cash. “We shall all be\r\nmassacred soon,” he said, “but I have done no wrong.” One of Jung Lu’s\r\nsergeants seized him and took him to the Commander-in-Chief’s residence.\r\nInstead of decapitating him, Jung Lu sent him back. This shows, however,\r\nthe desperate straits to which the foreigners are reduced.\r\n\r\n_15th Day of the 7th Moon_ (9th August).—Bad news from the South. Yü\r\nLu’s forces have been defeated and the foreigners are approaching nearer\r\nevery day. The Old Buddha is meditating flight to Jehol, but Jung Lu\r\nstrongly urges her to remain, even if the Allies should enter the City.\r\nDuke Lan scoffs at the idea of their being able to do so. One comfort\r\nis that, if they do come, they will not loot or kill. I remember well\r\nhow good their discipline was forty years ago. I never stirred out of my\r\nhouse and not one of the barbarians ever came near it. We had a little\r\ndifficulty about getting victuals, but the foreigners hardly came into\r\nthe city, and did us no harm.\r\n\r\n_16th Day of the 7th Moon_ (10th August).—My old colleague, Li Shan,\r\nwhose house adjoins the French Cathedral, has been accused of making a\r\nsubterranean passage and thus assisting the foreigners with supplies. He\r\nhas been handed over to the Board of Punishments by Prince Tuan, without\r\nthe knowledge of the Empress Dowager, together with Hsü Yung-yi and Lien\r\nYuan. Prince Tuan has long had a grudge against Hsü for having expressed\r\ndisapproval of the selection of the Heir Apparent. As to Lien, they say\r\nthat his arrest is due to ⸺, and his offence is that he was on terms of\r\nintimacy with Yüan Ch’ang. All three prisoners were decapitated this\r\nmorning. Hsü Yung-yi was older than I am (seventy-nine) and his death is\r\na lamentable business indeed. But he went to his death calmly and without\r\ncomplaint when he learned that the Empress Dowager knew nothing of the\r\nmatter and that it was Prince Tuan’s doing alone. “The power of the\r\nusurper,” said he, “is short-lived. As for me, I am glad to die before\r\nthe foreigners take Peking.” The Old Buddha will be very wrath when she\r\nhears that two Manchus have thus been put to death. Li Shan and Jung Lu\r\nwere old friends.\r\n\r\nA certain General Liu, from Shansi, assured the Empress this morning that\r\nhe would undertake to demolish the Legations in three days, and this\r\nwould so alarm the allies that their advance would certainly be stopped.\r\nA furious bombardment has just begun.\r\n\r\nThe Boxers have proved themselves utterly useless. I always said they\r\nnever would do anything.\r\n\r\n_18th Day of the 7th Moon_ (_12th August_).—The foreigners are getting\r\nnearer and nearer. Yü Lu shot himself with a revolver on the 12th at\r\nTs’ai Ts’un. He had taken refuge in a coffin shop, of all ill-omened\r\nplaces! His troops had been utterly routed thrice, at Pei Tsang, Yang\r\nTs’un and at Ts’ai Ts’un. Li Ping-heng reached Ho-hsi wu on the 14th,\r\nbut in spite of all his efforts to rally our forces, the two divisional\r\nleaders, Chang Ch’un-fa and Ch’en Tsê-lin, refused to fight. Li Ping-heng\r\ntherefore took poison. Jung Lu went to-day to break the news to the Old\r\nBuddha: sovereign and Minister wept together at the disasters which\r\nthese Princes and rebels have brought upon our glorious Empire. Jung\r\nLu refrained from any attempt at self-justification; he is a wise man.\r\nThe Old Buddha said she would commit suicide and make the Emperor do\r\nthe same, rather than leave her capital. Jung Lu besought her to take\r\nhis advice, which was to remain in Peking and to issue Decrees ordering\r\nthe decapitation of Prince Tuan and his followers, thus proving her\r\ninnocence to the world. But she seems to cling still to a hope that the\r\nsupernatural powers of the Boxers may save Peking, and so the furious\r\nbombardment of the Legations continues.\r\n\r\nEight audiences have been given to-day to Jung Lu and five to Prince\r\nTuan. All the other members of the Grand Council sat with folded hands,\r\nsuggesting nothing.\r\n\r\n_20th Day_ (_14th August_), 5 P.M.—Tungchou has fallen and now the\r\nforeigners have begun to bombard the city. The Grand Council has been\r\nsummoned to five meetings to-day in the Palace of Peaceful Longevity:\r\nHer Majesty is reported to be starting for Kalgan. At the hour of the\r\nMonkey (4 P.M.) Duke Lan burst into the Palace, unannounced, and shouted,\r\n“Old Buddha, the foreign devils have come!” Close upon his footsteps\r\ncame Kang Yi, who reported that a large force of turbaned soldiery were\r\nencamped in the enclosure of the Temple of Heaven. “Perhaps they are our\r\nMahommedan braves from Kansuh,” said Her Majesty, “come to demolish the\r\nLegations?” “No,” replied Kang Yi, “they are foreign devils. Your Majesty\r\nmust escape at once, or they will murder you.”\r\n\r\n_Later, midnight._—There has just been an Audience given to the Grand\r\nCouncil in the Palace, at which Kang Yi, Chao Shu-ch’iao and Wang\r\nWen-shao were present. “Where are the others?” said the Old Buddha.\r\n“Gone, I suppose, everyone to his own home, leaving us here, Mother and\r\nSon,[94] to look after ourselves as best we may. At all events, you three\r\nmust now accompany me on my journey.” Turning to Wang Wen-shao, she\r\nadded:—“You are too old, and I could not bear the thought of exposing\r\nyou to such hardships. Make such speed as you can and join me later.”\r\nThen to the other two she said, “You two are good riders. It will be your\r\nduty never to lose sight of me for an instant.” Wang Wen-shao replied, “I\r\nwill hasten after Your Majesty to the best of my ability.” The Emperor,\r\nwho seemed surprisingly alert and vigorous, here joined in, “Yes, by\r\nall means, follow as quickly as you can.” This ended the audience, but\r\nthe actual hour of Her Majesty’s departure remains uncertain. Jung Lu’s\r\nattendance was impossible because he was busy trying to rally our forces.\r\n\r\n_21st Day_ (_15th August_).—Wen Lien tells me that the Old Buddha arose\r\nthis morning at the Hour of the Tiger (3 A.M.) after only an hour’s rest,\r\nand dressed herself hurriedly in the common blue cloth garments of a\r\npeasant woman, which she had ordered to be prepared. For the first time\r\nin her life, her hair was done up in the Chinese fashion. “Who could ever\r\nhave believed that it would come to this?” she said. Three common carts\r\nwere brought into the Palace; their drivers wore no official hats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF A FRAGMENT OF THE DIARY.]\r\n\r\nAll the Concubines were summoned to appear before Her Majesty at 3.30\r\nA.M.; she had previously issued a decree that none of them would\r\naccompany her for the present. The Pearl Concubine, who has always been\r\ninsubordinate to the Old Buddha, came with the rest and actually dared\r\nto suggest that the Emperor should remain in Peking. The Empress was in\r\nno mood for argument. Without a moment’s hesitation, she shouted to the\r\neunuchs on duty, “Throw this wretched minion down the well!” At this the\r\nEmperor, who was greatly grieved, fell on his knees in supplication, but\r\nthe Empress angrily bade him desist, saying that this was no time for\r\nbandying words. “Let her die at once,” she said, “as a warning to all\r\nundutiful children, and to those ‘hsiao’ birds[95] who, when fledged,\r\npeck out their own mother’s eyes.” So the eunuchs Li and Sung took the\r\nPearl Concubine and cast her down the large well which is just outside\r\nthe Ning Shou Palace.\r\n\r\nThen to the Emperor, who stood trembling with grief and wrath, she\r\nsaid: “Get into your cart and hang up the screen, so that you be not\r\nrecognised” (he was wearing a long gown of black gauze and black cloth\r\ntrousers). Swiftly then the Old Buddha gave her orders. “P’u Lun, you\r\nwill ride on the shaft of the Emperor’s cart and look after him. I shall\r\ntravel in the other cart, and you, P’u Chün (the Heir Apparent) will ride\r\non the shaft. Li Lien-ying, I know you are a poor rider, but you must\r\nshift as best you can to keep up with us.” At this critical moment it\r\nseemed as if the Old Buddha alone retained her presence of mind. “Drive\r\nyour hardest,” she said to the carters, “and if any foreign devil should\r\nstop you, say nothing. I will speak to them and explain that we are but\r\npoor country folk, fleeing to our homes. Go first to the Summer Palace.”\r\nThereupon the carts started, passing out through the northern gate of\r\nthe Palace (The Gate of Military Prowess) while all the members of the\r\nHousehold and the Imperial Concubines prostrated themselves, wishing\r\ntheir Majesties a long life. Only the three Grand Councillors followed\r\non horseback, a rendezvous having been arranged for other officials\r\nat the Summer Palace. My neighbour Wen Lien, the Comptroller of the\r\nHousehold, followed their Majesties at a distance, to see them safely out\r\nof the city. They left by the “Te-sheng-men,” or Gate of Victory, on the\r\nnorth-west side of the city, where for a time their carts were blocked in\r\nthe dense mass of refugees passing out that way.\r\n\r\n4 P.M.—The Sacred Chariot of Her Majesty reached the Summer Palace at\r\nabout 8 A.M. and Their Majesties remained there an hour. Meanwhile, at 6\r\nA.M., Prince Ch’ing, just before starting for the Summer Palace, sent a\r\nflag of truce to the Japanese Pigmies who were bombarding the city close\r\nto the “Chi Hua” Gate on the east of the city. The gate was thrown open\r\nand the troops swarmed in.\r\n\r\nMy son En Ming was on duty at the Summer Palace with a few of his men,\r\nwhen the Imperial party arrived, all bedraggled and dust-begrimed. The\r\nsoldiers at the Palace gate could not believe that this was really their\r\nImperial mistress until the Old Buddha angrily asked whether they failed\r\nto recognise her. The carts were driven in through the side entrance, and\r\ntea was served. Her Majesty gave orders that all curios, valuables, and\r\nornaments were to be packed at once and sent off to Jehol; at the same\r\ntime she despatched one of the eunuchs to Peking to tell the Empress[96]\r\nto bury quickly every scrap of treasure in the Forbidden City, hiding it\r\nin the courtyard of the Ning Shou Palace.\r\n\r\nThe Princes Tuan, Ching, Na, and Su joined Their Majesties at the Summer\r\nPalace; a few Dukes were there also, as well as Wu Shu-mei and Pu Hsing\r\nof the higher officials. About a dozen Secretaries from the different\r\nBoards, and three Clerks to the Grand Council, accompanied the Court\r\nfrom this point. General Ma Yu-k’un, with a force of 1,000 men escorted\r\nTheir Majesties to Kalgan, and there were, in addition, several hundreds\r\nof Prince Tuan’s “Heavenly Tiger” Bannermen, fresh from their fruitless\r\nattacks on the Legations. Jung Lu is still endeavouring to rally his\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nI have just heard of the death of my old friend, Hsü T’ung, the Imperial\r\nTutor and Grand Secretary. He has hanged himself in his house and\r\neighteen of his womenfolk have followed his example. He was a true\r\npatriot and a fine scholar. Alas, alas! From all sides I hear the\r\nsame piteous story; the proudest of the Manchus have come to the same\r\nmiserable end. The betrothed of Prince Ch’un, whom he was to have married\r\nnext month, has committed suicide, with all her family. It is indeed\r\npitiful.[97]\r\n\r\nThus, for the second time in her life, the Old Buddha has had to flee\r\nfrom her Sacred City, like the Son of Heaven in the Chou Dynasty, who\r\n“fled with dust-covered head.” The failure of the southern provinces\r\nto join in the enterprise has ruined us. Prince Tuan was much to blame\r\nin being anti-Chinese. As Confucius said, “By the lack of broad-minded\r\ntolerance in small matters, a great design has been frustrated.” After\r\nall, Jung Lu was right—the Boxers’ so-called magic was nothing but\r\nchild’s talk. They were in reality no stronger than autumn thistledown.\r\nAlas, the bright flower of spring does not bloom twice!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAUGHTERS OF A HIGH MANCHU OFFICIAL OF THE COURT.]\r\n\r\nMy wife and the other women, stupidly obstinate like all females, intend\r\nto take opium. I cannot prevent them from doing so, but, for myself, I\r\nhave no intention of doing anything so foolish. Already the foreign\r\nbrigands are looting in other quarters of the city, but they will never\r\nfind my hidden treasure, and I shall just remain here, old and feeble as\r\nI am. My son, En Ch’u, has disappeared since yesterday, and nearly all my\r\nservants have fled. There is no one to prepare my evening meal.\r\n\r\n(_Here the Diary ends. The old man was murdered by his eldest son that\r\nsame evening; all his women folk had previously taken poison and died._)\r\n\r\n    _Vermilion Decree of H.M. Kuang Hsü, 24th day, 12th Moon of\r\n    25th year (January, 1900), making Prince Tuan’s son Heir\r\n    Apparent._\r\n\r\n    “In days of our tender infancy we succeeded by adoption to the\r\n    Great Inheritance, and were favoured by the Empress Dowager,\r\n    who graciously ‘suspended the curtain’ and administered the\r\n    Government as Regent, earnestly labouring the while at our\r\n    education in all matters. Since we assumed the reins of\r\n    government, the nation has passed through severe crises, and\r\n    our sole desire has been to govern the Empire wisely in order\r\n    to requite the material benevolence of Her Majesty as well as\r\n    to fulfil the arduous task imposed on us by His late Majesty.\r\n\r\n    “But since last year our constitution has been sore-stricken\r\n    with illness, and we have undergone much anxiety lest the\r\n    business of the State should suffer in consequence. Reflecting\r\n    on the duty we owe to our sacred ancestors and to the Empire,\r\n    we have therefore besought Her Majesty to administer the\r\n    Government during the past year. Our sickness has so far\r\n    shown no signs of improvement, and it has prevented us from\r\n    performing all the important sacrifices at the ancestral\r\n    shrines and at the altars of the gods of the soil.\r\n\r\n    “And now at this acute crisis, the spectacle of Her Majesty,\r\n    labouring without cease in the profound seclusion of her\r\n    Palace, without relaxation or thought of rest, has filled us\r\n    with dismay. We can neither sleep nor eat in the anxiety of our\r\n    thoughts. Reflecting on the arduous labours of our ancestors\r\n    from whom this great Heritage has descended to us, we are\r\n    overwhelmed by our unfitness for this task of government. We\r\n    bear in mind (and the fact is well known to all our subjects)\r\n    that when first we succeeded by adoption to the Throne, we\r\n    were honoured with a Decree from the Empress Dowager to the\r\n    effect that so soon as we should have begotten an heir, he\r\n    should become the adopted son of His Majesty T’ung-Chih. But\r\n    our protracted sickness renders it impossible for us to hope\r\n    for a son, so that His late Majesty remains without heir. This\r\n    question of the succession is of transcendent importance, and\r\n    our grief, as we ponder the situation, fills us with feelings\r\n    of the deepest self-abasement, and renders illusive all hope of\r\n    our recovery from this sickness.\r\n\r\n    “We have accordingly prostrated ourselves in supplication\r\n    before our Sacred Mother, begging that she may be pleased to\r\n    select some worthy person from among the Princes of the Blood\r\n    as heir to His Majesty T’ung-Chih, in order that the Great\r\n    Inheritance may duly revert to him. As the result of our\r\n    repeated entreaties Her Majesty has graciously consented, and\r\n    has appointed P’u Chün, son of Prince Tuan, as heir by adoption\r\n    to His late Majesty. Our gratitude at this is unbounded, and\r\n    obediently we obey her behests, hereby appointing P’u Chün to\r\n    be Heir Apparent and successor to the Throne. Let this Decree\r\n    be made known throughout the Empire.”\r\n\r\nSeldom has history seen so tragically pathetic a document. It was not\r\nonly a confession of his own illegality and an abdication, but his\r\ndeath-warrant, clear writ for all men to read. And the poor victim must\r\nperforce thank his executioner and praise the “maternal benevolence” of\r\nthe woman whose uncontrollable love of power had wrecked his life from\r\nthe cradle.\r\n\r\n    _Memorial from the Censorate at Peking to the Throne at Hsi-an,\r\n    describing the arrest of En Hai, the murderer of the German\r\n    Minister, Baron von Ketteler._[98]\r\n\r\nThis Memorial affords a striking illustration of the sympathy which\r\nanimated, and still animates, many of those nearest to the Throne\r\nin regard to the Boxers and their anti-foreign crusade, and their\r\nappreciation of the real sentiments of the Empress Dowager, even in\r\ndefeat. It also throws light on the Chinese official’s idea of heroism in\r\na soldier.\r\n\r\n    “A spy in Japanese employ, engaged in searching for looted\r\n    articles in the pawnshops of the district in Japanese military\r\n    occupation, found among the unredeemed pledges in one shop a\r\n    watch bearing Baron von Ketteler’s monogram. The pawnbroker\r\n    said that it had been pledged by a bannerman named En Hai, who\r\n    lived at a carters’ inn of the Tartar city. This spy was a\r\n    man named Te Lu, a writer attached to the Manchu Field Force,\r\n    of the 8th squad of the ‘Ting’ Company. He went at once and\r\n    informed the Japanese, who promptly sent a picquet to the\r\n    inn mentioned. Two or three men were standing about in the\r\n    courtyard, and the soldiers asked one of them whether En Hai\r\n    was there. ‘I’m the man,’ said he, whereupon they took him\r\n    prisoner. Under examination, En was perfectly calm and showed\r\n    no sort of emotion. The presiding Magistrate enquired ‘Was\r\n    it you who slew the German Minister?’ He replied ‘I received\r\n    orders from my Sergeant to kill every foreigner that came up\r\n    the street. I am a soldier, and I only know it is my duty to\r\n    obey orders. On that day I was with my men, some thirty of\r\n    them, in the street, when a foreigner came along in a sedan\r\n    chair. At once I took up my stand a little to the side of\r\n    the street, and, taking careful aim, fired into the chair.\r\n    Thereupon the bearers fled: we went up to the chair, dragged\r\n    the foreigner out, and saw that he was dead. I felt a watch in\r\n    his breast pocket and took it as my lawful share; my comrades\r\n    appropriated a revolver, some rings and other articles. I never\r\n    thought that this watch would lead to my detection, but I am\r\n    glad to die for having killed one of the enemies of my country.\r\n    Please behead me at once.’\r\n\r\n    “The interpreter asked him whether he was drunk at the time.\r\n    He laughed and said, ‘Wine’s a fine thing, and I can put away\r\n    four or five catties at a time, but that day I had not touched\r\n    a drop. Do you suppose I would try to screen myself on the\r\n    score of being in liquor?’ This En Hai appears to have been\r\n    an honest fellow; his words were brave and dignified, so that\r\n    the bystanders all realised that China is not without heroes\r\n    in the ranks of her army. On the following day he was handed\r\n    over to the Germans, and beheaded on the scene of his exploit.\r\n    We, your Memorialists, feel that Your Majesties should be made\r\n    acquainted with his meritorious behaviour, and we therefore\r\n    report the above facts. We are of opinion that his name should\r\n    not be permitted to fall into oblivion, and we trust that Your\r\n    Majesties may be pleased to confer upon him honours as in the\r\n    case of one who has fallen in battle with his face to the foe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nIN MEMORY OF TWO BRAVE MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Memorial of the Censors given in the last chapter, recording the\r\narrest and execution of the Manchu soldier who shot the German Minister\r\ndefenceless in his chair, took occasion to congratulate the Empress\r\nand the nation on possessing such brave defenders; and to do the man\r\njustice, he met his end with a fine courage. But with fuller knowledge\r\nand a clearer insight, the scholars of the Empire might well put forward\r\nclaims to real heroism, moral courage of the rarest kind, in the case\r\nof Yüan Ch’ang and Hsü Ching-ch’eng, the two Ministers who, as we have\r\nshown, so nobly laid down their lives for what they knew to be their\r\ncountry’s highest good. So long as China can breed men like these, so\r\nlong as the Confucian system contains moral force sufficient to produce\r\nStoic scholars of this type, the nation has no cause to despair of its\r\nfuture. We make no apology for insisting on the claims of these two men\r\nto our grateful admiration, or for reproducing their last Memorials, in\r\nwhich they warned the Old Buddha of her folly, and, by denouncing the\r\nBoxers, braved all the forces of anarchy and savagery which surged about\r\nthe Dragon Throne. Already their good name stands high in the esteem of\r\ntheir countrymen. _Et prevalebit_: their courage and unselfish patriotism\r\nhave been recognised by their canonisation in the Pantheon of China’s\r\nworthies, under an Edict of the present Regent.\r\n\r\nShortly after their execution the following circular letter _pour faire\r\npart_ was addressed by the sons of Yüan Ch’ang to the relatives and\r\nfriends of the family:—\r\n\r\n    _Notice sent by the Yüan family to their relatives regarding\r\n    the death of Yüan Ch’ang, September, 1900._\r\n\r\nAfter the usual conventional formulæ of grief and self-abasement, this\r\ncircular letter proceeds as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “We realise that it was because of his outspoken courage in\r\n    resisting the evil tendencies of the times that our parent met\r\n    his untimely death, and we now submit the following report of\r\n    the circumstances for the information of our relatives and\r\n    friends.\r\n\r\n    “When, in the 5th Moon of this year, the Boxer madness\r\n    commenced, our late father, in his capacity as a Minister\r\n    of the Foreign Office, felt extremely anxious in regard to\r\n    the situation, and his anxiety was shared by his colleague,\r\n    Hsü Ching-ch’eng. On three occasions when the Princes and\r\n    Ministers were received in audience, my father expressed his\r\n    opinion to the Throne that the Boxers were utterly unreliable.\r\n    ‘I have been in person,’ he said, ‘to Legation Street, and\r\n    have seen the corpses of Boxers lying on all sides. They had\r\n    most certainly been shot, proving that their unholy rites\r\n    availed them nothing. They should be exterminated and not used\r\n    as Government forces.’ On hearing this advice, the Emperor,\r\n    turning to Hsü Ching-ch’eng, enquired whether China is strong\r\n    enough to resist the foreigners or not, and other questions\r\n    bearing on the position of the Foreign Powers abroad. Hsü\r\n    replied without hesitation that China was far too weak to think\r\n    of fighting the whole world. His Majesty was so much impressed\r\n    by what he had heard that he caught hold of Hsü by the sleeve\r\n    and seemed much distressed. Hsü sorrowfully left the presence,\r\n    and proceeded with our father to draft the first of their joint\r\n    Memorials.\r\n\r\n    “Later on, when the bombardment of the Legations was in full\r\n    swing, our father observed to Hsü, ‘This slaughtering of Envoys\r\n    is a grave breach of all international law. If the Legations\r\n    are destroyed and the Powers then send an expedition to avenge\r\n    them, what will become of our country? We must oppose this\r\n    folly, you and I, even at the risk of our lives.’ So they put\r\n    in their second Memorial, which never appeared in the Gazette,\r\n    but which so frightened the Boxer princes and Ministers that\r\n    they slackened for a while in their attacks on the foreigners.\r\n    The preservation of the Legations on this occasion was really\r\n    due to this Memorial, and from this moment the enemies of Hsü\r\n    and our father became more than ever bent on revenge.\r\n\r\n    “In the last few days of the 6th Moon (July 15th to 25th) the\r\n    foreign armies were massing for their march on Peking, and\r\n    our father said to Hsü, ‘We are only waiting for death. Why\r\n    should we delay it any longer?’ So they handed in their third\r\n    Memorial. In this document they declared that the situation\r\n    was becoming desperate, that even the Princes of the Blood and\r\n    the Ministers of the Grand Council had come to applaud these\r\n    Boxers, and to assist in deceiving their Majesties. There was\r\n    only one way left to avoid dire peril and hold back the foreign\r\n    armies, and that was to put an end to these Boxers, and to do\r\n    this it was necessary to begin by beheading their leaders among\r\n    the Princes and Ministers. Having sent in this Memorial, our\r\n    father said to our mother ‘Things have now come to such a pass\r\n    that, whether I speak out or keep silence, my death is certain.\r\n    Rather than be murdered by these treacherous Ministers, I\r\n    prefer to die at the hands of the public executioner. If only\r\n    by my death I can convince the Throne of the peril of the\r\n    situation, I shall die gladly.’\r\n\r\n    “We all crowded round our father and wept. Calmly he spake to\r\n    us, saying, ‘I am giving my life for the State. What other\r\n    thought have I now? You must decide for yourselves whether you\r\n    will remain in Peking or return to our home in the south.’ He\r\n    then gave us a solemn admonition in regard to our duties of\r\n    loyalty and patriotism.\r\n\r\n    “On the second day of the 7th Moon, (July 27th) he was arrested\r\n    and taken to the Board of Punishments. Next day, at 1 P.M.,\r\n    ‘his duty was finally consummated.’ The execution ground was\r\n    crowded with a mob of Boxers. Angrily some of them asked\r\n    him why he had borne a grudge, and spoken evil, against the\r\n    ‘Patriotic Harmony Militia.’ Our father mockingly answered\r\n    ‘A statesman speaks out in obedience to a sense of duty. How\r\n    should such as you understand?’\r\n\r\n    “We were informed by the gaolers that our father and Hsü had\r\n    chatted quietly and contentedly in prison. They had asked for\r\n    paper and ink, and had written over twenty sheets, but this\r\n    document was found by the Boxers and burned. Was it, we wonder,\r\n    a valedictory Memorial to the Throne, or a last mandate to\r\n    their families? We cannot say, and we shall never know. Alas,\r\n    alas, that we, undutiful sons as we are, should have to bear\r\n    this crowning sorrow! We have failed in our duty both as sons\r\n    and as men. Our mother still survives, and our father’s burial\r\n    remains to be attended to, so that we feel bound to go on,\r\n    drawing the breath of pain, so as to perform our duty to our\r\n    lamented sire. On the 8th of this Moon we propose to carry\r\n    his remains to a place of temporary sepulture in the Garden\r\n    of ‘Wide Friendship’ at Hangchow, and shall escort our mother\r\n    to her home. We shall set up the tablet of our father in a\r\n    building adjoining his temporary grave, and there weep and\r\n    lament.”\r\n\r\nIf to meet an undeserved doom with high courage is heroism, then these\r\nmen were indeed heroes. In reading their Memorials—and especially the\r\nlast of them—one is inevitably and forcibly reminded of the best examples\r\nin Greek and Roman history. In their high-minded philosophy, their\r\ninstinctive morality and calm contemplation of death, there breathes\r\nthe spirit of Socrates, Seneca and Pliny, the spirit which has given\r\nEuropean civilisation its classical models of noble fortitude and many\r\nof its finest inspirations, the spirit which, shorn of its quality of\r\nindividualism, has been the foundation of Japan’s greatness. In the last\r\nof these three Memorials, their swan-song, there rings the true heroic\r\nnote, clear-seeing, earnest and fearless. The first, though forwarded in\r\nthe name of Yüan alone, was drafted conjointly with Hsü Ching-ch’eng.\r\nHsü, well-known in diplomatic circles by his having been Minister in St.\r\nPetersburg and Berlin, had not the same high reputation for personal\r\nintegrity and disinterested patriotism as his friend, but whatever his\r\nformer failings, he made full amends by the unflinching nobility of\r\npurpose that led to his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yüan Ch’ang’s First Memorial against the Boxers, Dated 20th June, 1900._\r\n\r\n    “Ever since the 16th day of the Moon (June 12th), when the\r\n    Boxers first burst into Peking, your Majesties have been\r\n    giving audience daily to all the Princes and Ministers of\r\n    State. The weight of the nation’s sorrow has afflicted your\r\n    Sacred Persons, and you have sought the advice of us, your\r\n    humble servants, in your anxious desire that a policy may be\r\n    devised whereby peace should be restored to the shrines of your\r\n    ancestors and to the Chinese people. But we have failed so far\r\n    to avert calamity, and thus to bring comfort to our sorrowing\r\n    Sovereigns; grievous indeed are our shortcomings, which fill us\r\n    with shame and dismay.\r\n\r\n    “Humbly I recall to your Majesties’ memories a Decree which was\r\n    issued in the 7th Moon of the 13th year of Chia-Ch’ing. Therein\r\n    it is recorded that, in the provinces of Shantung and Honan, a\r\n    dangerous conspiracy had been organised by evil-doers under the\r\n    name of the ‘Eight Diagram’ Society. These latter day Boxers\r\n    are, in fact, merely the descendants of the ‘White Lily’ sect,\r\n    and your Majesties have already decreed their extermination. It\r\n    was only last year that the District Magistrate of Wu Chiao, in\r\n    Shantung, drew up a memorandum giving a very full account of\r\n    this sect, and two months ago the Governor of Shantung (Yüan\r\n    Shih-k’ai), replying to your Majesties’ enquiries, reported\r\n    that these Boxers were in no way deserving of Imperial favour,\r\n    and could never be enrolled as Government troops. No statement\r\n    could be more explicit. Furthermore, the ex-Governor, Yü Hsien,\r\n    reporting in connection with the case of a leader of this sect\r\n    named Chu Hung-teng, or ‘Chu of the Red Lamp,’ stated that this\r\n    impostor claimed to be a descendant of the Ming Dynasty; he\r\n    had so worked upon the ignorant people that the whole district\r\n    was in a state of unrest, and these treasonable proceedings\r\n    increased and spread until the Imperial forces arrested and\r\n    executed the ringleaders. Their purely mythical claims to\r\n    invulnerability were clearly disproved by the fact that their\r\n    execution presented no difficulties.\r\n\r\n    “When seeking information on this subject last year, I was\r\n    informed by General Ch’eng Wen-ping that five years ago (in\r\n    1895) he was stationed at a post on the Chihli frontier,\r\n    infested by robbers, who there went by the name of the ‘Golden\r\n    Bell’ Society, and were brothers of the ‘Golden Lamp.’ On\r\n    one occasion some fifty of these men desired to join General\r\n    Ch’eng’s forces, but upon his putting their alleged powers to\r\n    the test, by firing bullets at them and stabbing them with\r\n    swords, blood flowed in the most natural manner, so that these\r\n    magic workers died. I mention the fact to show the absurdity of\r\n    this superstition; it proves, beyond doubt, that the organisers\r\n    of these Societies are dangerous and treasonable rogues,\r\n    harbouring evil designs against the Dynasty, especially when\r\n    they claim to be descendants of the Mings. They have, however,\r\n    collected an enormous following, and should be dealt with as\r\n    rebels, which they undoubtedly are.\r\n\r\n    “Last year, in the 11th Moon, 13th day, your Majesties granted\r\n    me audience, and I reported the above facts, adding that the\r\n    alleged anti-Christian propaganda of these Boxers was merely\r\n    a pretext, and that their treasonable aims justified their\r\n    immediate extermination. Subsequently Yüan Shih-k’ai, then\r\n    newly appointed Governor, did his duty in suppressing the\r\n    movement, so that several Boxer societies were broken up or\r\n    destroyed. Once more peace reigned, so that the gentry and\r\n    _literati_ of the province, who for a time had believed in the\r\n    Boxers and had accused the Governor of ruthless methods, were\r\n    forced to admit that he had acted rightly and that they had\r\n    been misled. Who could have supposed that the suppression of\r\n    the movement in Shantung would be followed by its spreading\r\n    and increasing in Chihli? The Viceroy (Yü Lu) must undoubtedly\r\n    be blamed for this; he has allowed the canker to grow without\r\n    check, playing the part of an indifferent spectator. Latterly,\r\n    after these Boxers had murdered the Magistrate of Lai Shui,\r\n    the Viceroy appeared to realise, for the first time, that\r\n    their professed campaign against the Christians was merely a\r\n    cloak for rebellion. He telegraphed, therefore, recommending\r\n    their suppression. But there were differences of opinion at\r\n    Court, and nothing was decided. Other districts became speedily\r\n    affected with the evil, and for no other reason than that the\r\n    rebels of Lai Shui had escaped without punishment. They grew\r\n    bolder and bolder, until finally they tore up the railway\r\n    lines and destroyed the telegraphs throughout the province,\r\n    although both are Government property, upon which vast sums of\r\n    the public money have been spent. Deplorable, indeed, that one\r\n    morning’s work of rebels should witness the loss of millions of\r\n    taels! They have also destroyed many Christian churches, for\r\n    which the State will have to pay heavily hereafter.\r\n\r\n    “I humbly submit that this fierce outbreak of the Boxers\r\n    against Christians is a matter of deadly peril to the Empire.\r\n    By our laws, Magistrates are expected to administer justice\r\n    without fear or favour; there is no distinction to be made\r\n    between Christians and non-Christians, and it should certainly\r\n    not be permitted that evil-doers should pursue their ends on\r\n    any plea of religious zeal. And now, within the last few days,\r\n    these rebels have even dared to invade our Capital, and their\r\n    armed mob profanes the very chariot wheels of the Throne. Arson\r\n    and murder are their work; they have burned the churches and\r\n    attacked the Legations. Your Majesties’ Palace is shaking to\r\n    its foundations, as by an earthquake. For such deeds there is\r\n    no penalty but death; clemency in such a case were folly.\r\n\r\n    “On the 20th day of this Moon they set fire to more than a\r\n    thousand shops outside the Main Gate, so that the wealthiest\r\n    quarter of the city is now a hideous desert. Nine out of\r\n    every ten inhabitants are fleeing from the city, and hardly\r\n    a shop remains open. There is no money forthcoming from the\r\n    provinces wherewith to pay our troops. Words cannot describe\r\n    the utter desolation prevailing on all sides. In allowing these\r\n    rioters to stalk through the land, breathing slaughter and\r\n    plunder, we were making ourselves a byeword and an object of\r\n    derision throughout the civilised world. The ministers of the\r\n    foreign Powers, alarmed by the Boxers’ wild threats, have been\r\n    compelled, by the necessities of their situation, to bring up\r\n    Legation guards, but these only amount to four hundred and ten\r\n    men altogether, and the object of their coming is clearly not\r\n    offensive, but defensive only.\r\n\r\n    “On the 16th day (June 12th) Ch’i Hsiu and other members of\r\n    the Grand Council were instructed by your Majesty (the Empress\r\n    Dowager) to have compliments and expressions of sympathy\r\n    sent to the foreign Ministers and their wives. This act of\r\n    benevolent courtesy was gratefully recognised. They were fully\r\n    alive to the bountiful measure of protection thus extended to\r\n    them in your Majesty’s clemency; it penetrated to their very\r\n    marrow. The Ministers then informed your Majesty that their\r\n    Legation guards have been brought up solely as a precaution,\r\n    and they have no thought of interfering in the domestic\r\n    affairs of our country. They give the most solemn assurances,\r\n    invoking the sun as witness and pointing to heaven, that, so\r\n    soon as these disturbances are at an end, their troops will\r\n    immediately be withdrawn. There is no reason to suspect them\r\n    of any treachery or evil purpose. It should be our immediate\r\n    aim to rid the Tartar city of the presence of these rebels, in\r\n    order not only to reassure the minds of our own people, but to\r\n    relieve the anxiety of the foreigners. If we do this, there\r\n    will be no further talk of the foreign Powers sending more\r\n    troops; if we crush the rebellion ourselves, there would be no\r\n    need of foreign co-operation to that end. Surely the wisdom of\r\n    this course is self-evident.” (_Here follow certain suggestions\r\n    for Police and military measures._)\r\n\r\n    “If it be objected that the destruction of so vast a number\r\n    of Boxers is impracticable, I venture to reply that the\r\n    present situation has been entirely brought about by a few\r\n    ringleaders, and that the majority of the Boxers are simply\r\n    ignorant peasantry. If, on the other hand, it be maintained\r\n    that these rebels are in possession of magical secrets which\r\n    confer upon them supernatural powers, I would venture to remind\r\n    your Majesties of Chang Chio’s ‘Yellow Turban’ sect, which\r\n    flourished towards the end of the Han Dynasty, and of the\r\n    historic case of P’an Kuang, the ‘head-breaker’ of the Yuan\r\n    Dynasty; both of these men, though possessing supernatural\r\n    powers, nevertheless lost their heads. One of the principal\r\n    reasons for the alleged invulnerability of these Boxer bandits\r\n    is that in the day time they lie low; it is at night that they\r\n    display activity, and call upon their deities to succour them.\r\n    All the magical arts which they profess—their incantations,\r\n    charms, invocations of spirits, table-turning, and the ‘five\r\n    demon’ trick—are merely cheap devices of useless sorcery. Let\r\n    them encounter any lethal weapon, let them be struck by cannon\r\n    or rifle bullet, and they fall dead upon the spot. Can it be\r\n    seriously maintained that they are really safe from bullets\r\n    when it is notorious that a large number of them were shot by\r\n    the foreign troops on the 17th day of this Moon (June 13th),\r\n    when they began their attack upon the Legations? Only yesterday\r\n    over forty Boxers were shot dead in Shuai Fu lane,[99] and\r\n    their altar was destroyed.\r\n\r\n    “The population of Peking numbers close upon a million, and,\r\n    with the exception of these wretched mobs or Boxers, they\r\n    are all loyal to the Throne and law-abiding. The capture and\r\n    execution of these Boxers would vindicate the majesty of the\r\n    law, and tranquillise the minds of the people; the courage of\r\n    the rebels would wane as that of the respectable community\r\n    increased. Once rid Peking of the Boxers, and the Legations\r\n    will gratefully recognise the efficacy of your Majesty’s divine\r\n    protection, and their feelings towards you will be as towards a\r\n    second Creator. The reinforcements of the foreign guards could\r\n    then reasonably be stopped, or withdrawn, at an early date,\r\n    there being clearly no further necessity for their presence.\r\n\r\n    “In conclusion it is written in the Book of Ceremonies of\r\n    the Chou Dynasty ‘that the existence of anarchy in a State\r\n    necessitates the adoption of the death penalty’; also in the\r\n    Canon of History it is written ‘that there is a time when\r\n    the infliction of capital punishment becomes a sacred duty.’\r\n    It would therefore appear to be clearly proved that these\r\n    Boxers should properly be exterminated, and that any further\r\n    continuance of procrastination or of evasive measures, such\r\n    as their enrolment in the army, will be utterly unavailing.\r\n    The foreign Powers are strong, and their indignation has\r\n    reached extreme limits. Should they now unite in measures of\r\n    retaliation, indescribable disasters await us. Instead of\r\n    allowing the foreigners to suppress the Boxers, which would\r\n    mean much fighting and bloodshed in and around Peking, the\r\n    slaughter of many innocent persons (‘jade and common stone\r\n    perishing together in one catastrophe’), let us rather suppress\r\n    the movement ourselves, and thus close the mouths of our\r\n    detractors and those who criticise our Empire. Thus only will\r\n    the ancestral shrines escape desecration, and the people enjoy\r\n    untold benefits.\r\n\r\n    “The Grand Secretary, Jung Lu, is patriotic and loyal. If your\r\n    Majesties will but grant him full powers, success will speedily\r\n    be attained. Diplomatic difficulties can easily be overcome by\r\n    careful attention to the exigencies of the moment. Urging upon\r\n    your Majesties the essential fact that in undivided control of\r\n    authority lies our only safeguard against dire catastrophe,\r\n    I now beg humbly to submit this my Memorial, laying bare my\r\n    innermost feelings, and ask that your Majesties’ divine wisdom\r\n    may consider and decide the matter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Second Memorial of Yüan Ch’ang and Hsü Ching-ch’eng, July 8th._\r\n\r\n    “Ever since, on the 24th day of last Moon, the German Minister\r\n    von Ketteler was killed by the Boxers, the latter have been\r\n    besieging the Legations, and the Kansuh troops under Tung\r\n    Fu-hsiang have been their willing accomplices in perpetrating\r\n    every kind of evil. Countless is the number of our people,\r\n    residing near the Legations, who have suffered death at their\r\n    hands. Practically every house in the eastern quarter of the\r\n    city, whether public or private property, has been mercilessly\r\n    plundered.\r\n\r\n    “The Boxers originally proclaimed that their mission was to\r\n    pay off old scores against the Christians; they then proceeded\r\n    to include the Legations in their attacks. From the Legations\r\n    they have extended their sphere of activity, directing their\r\n    operations against our officials and the common people. That\r\n    a mutinous soldiery and mobs of rebels should be permitted to\r\n    run riot over our Capital, and work their evil will upon the\r\n    people, is indeed a circumstance unparalleled in our history.\r\n\r\n    “When the siege began it was their boast that, within\r\n    twenty-four hours, not a single Legation would remain standing,\r\n    nay more, Tung Fu-hsiang has repeatedly boasted that they are\r\n    already nothing more than a heap of ashes. As a matter of fact,\r\n    however, nearly a month has passed, and whereas scarcely a\r\n    foreign soldier has been killed, the entire Legation quarter\r\n    lies strewn with the corpses of these Boxers. Where now the\r\n    proud boast, with which they deluded simple folk, that their\r\n    magic arts rendered them immune from bullet wounds? If, after a\r\n    month’s effort, fifty thousand bandits are unable to capture a\r\n    few Legations garrisoned by less than four hundred foreigners,\r\n    we can form a fairly accurate estimate of their value and\r\n    prowess. Who would ever dream of using the services of such\r\n    heroes to check foreign aggression?\r\n\r\n    “It may perhaps be suggested that genuine Boxers would show\r\n    very different results in their country’s service, and that\r\n    those who have been guilty of murder and arson are not really\r\n    Boxers at all, but outsiders and charlatans, having no\r\n    legitimate connection with the cult. But we submit that if the\r\n    society has been so disorganised as to be divided into real and\r\n    counterfeit members, and if the latter are permitted with the\r\n    tacit consent of the former, to commit every kind of atrocity,\r\n    it seems clear that the genuine Boxer himself is a thoroughly\r\n    disreputable person.\r\n\r\n    “Moreover, the Throne has expressly forbidden them to take\r\n    up arms and to continue their devastation with fire and\r\n    sword; they have been ordered to disband and leave Peking.\r\n    Nevertheless, they ignore these orders and continue in their\r\n    wicked ways. Whether genuine or counterfeit, these Boxers\r\n    vie with one another in flouting the law of the land. Their\r\n    incorrigible wickedness renders them one and all deserving\r\n    of death; the leniency shown them has but increased their\r\n    arrogance, and the number of these evil-doers has grown by\r\n    reason of the tolerance extended to them.\r\n\r\n    “In a previous Memorial we urged that the Grand Secretary Jung\r\n    Lu should be given full powers, with instructions to adopt such\r\n    severe measures as might be necessary for the suppression\r\n    of this movement, but your Majesties declined to follow our\r\n    advice. To-day the danger has grown infinitely greater, and we\r\n    feel it therefore our bounden duty to lay before your Sacred\r\n    intelligence our crude and humble views even though, in doing\r\n    so, we incur the risk of death for our temerity. We bear in\r\n    mind the words of the Spring and Autumn classic, ‘in time of\r\n    war the persons of Envoys are inviolate.’ By the international\r\n    law of European countries, foreign Ambassadors are regarded\r\n    as semi-sacred personages: whosoever treats them wrongfully\r\n    commits a wrong against the State which they represent. If\r\n    these Boxer bandits be permitted to destroy the Legations and\r\n    to slay the foreign Ministers, the Powers will undoubtedly\r\n    consider this a monstrous outrage, and will unitedly make any\r\n    sacrifice in order to avenge it. The foreign troops at present\r\n    in Peking are but few in number, but there are great armies to\r\n    take their place. That China should attempt to fight the entire\r\n    world means, in our humble opinion, not the defeat only, but\r\n    the complete annihilation of the Empire. For the past sixty\r\n    years China has made treaties with Foreign Powers, and has\r\n    permitted European missionaries to come amongst us for the\r\n    propagation of their religion. It is true that their converts\r\n    take advantage of their position to act unjustly to their\r\n    fellow-countrymen and to insult them. It is true that they\r\n    frequently rely upon missionary protection to secure their evil\r\n    ends, but it is also true that our local officials often treat\r\n    these matters with apathy and injustice. The non-Christians are\r\n    therefore filled with resentment and indignation against the\r\n    Christians, a result very largely due to lack of ability and\r\n    energy on the part of the Government officials. This is the\r\n    case at present; we are but reaping the harvest of past faults.\r\n    Your Memorialists do not venture to suggest that the cause\r\n    of this ill-feeling against the Christians lies chiefly with\r\n    the common people, but it cannot be denied that China loses\r\n    dignity in the eyes of the world while our Government remains\r\n    indifferent to these continual feuds between Christians and\r\n    non-Christians. It is inadmissible that the local officials\r\n    should excuse themselves for inaction on the plea that they\r\n    cannot maintain order. For example, if two neighbours in a\r\n    village are on bad terms, and a clan fight takes place between\r\n    their respective families and followers, and if, as the result,\r\n    property is destroyed and lives lost in the fray, reparation\r\n    will be claimed by the aggrieved party, not from the actual\r\n    fighters, but from the heads of the other clan, with whom rests\r\n    the responsibility for law and order. In matters of State the\r\n    same principle holds good.\r\n\r\n    “The religions of Europe may be divided into Catholic and\r\n    Protestant; the priests of the former sect are known as\r\n    “spiritual fathers” while the latter are called “pastors.”\r\n    These Boxer brigands class all foreign religions alike, making\r\n    no difference between sect and sect; but the Russians are of\r\n    the Greek church, while the Japanese are Buddhists. Neither of\r\n    these nations has hitherto sent missions to the interior of\r\n    China, a fact which these Boxers completely ignore. To them,\r\n    the mere sight of a foreign costume, or the hearing of words in\r\n    a foreign tongue, immediately evokes their war cry of “hairy\r\n    devils,” who must be exterminated. It is clear that all right\r\n    principles of conduct render such an attitude unjust, while our\r\n    weakness as a nation renders it inexpedient; and we would ask\r\n    your Majesties to remember that China has also sent its Envoys\r\n    on foreign missions. If the Powers, enraged by the massacre of\r\n    their Envoys, should retaliate by killing ours, will it not be\r\n    said that China has dealt the fatal blow to her own Ministers\r\n    by the hand of another? Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager, has\r\n    just sent presents to the foreign Legations—fruit, vegetable,\r\n    flour and rice—in order to ‘display your beneficence to the\r\n    strangers from afar.’[100] Nevertheless these Boxer brigands,\r\n    trusting in their arrogant Commander (Tung Fu-hsiang) as a\r\n    tower of strength, continue their attacks upon the Legations.\r\n    If the foreigners come to suspect the Throne of hypocritical\r\n    displays of friendliness while secretly encouraging this\r\n    bombardment, who will hereafter believe any statement that may\r\n    be put forward as to your innocence and disapproval of all this\r\n    carnival of slaughter, however earnestly you may proclaim it to\r\n    a doubting world?\r\n\r\n    “If, on the other hand, the Legations successfully maintain\r\n    their resistance until peace is eventually restored, then the\r\n    foreign Envoys, who have received your Majesty’s bounty, will\r\n    naturally feel bound, in common gratitude, to advise their\r\n    Governments that the Boxers alone were responsible for the\r\n    siege, which no foresight could have prevented, and that your\r\n    Majesties are to be acquitted of all blame for the growth of\r\n    this movement. By a wise course of action at this juncture,\r\n    the suspicions of foreign Powers may be lulled, and a very\r\n    great advantage gained at very little trouble to ourselves. It\r\n    will thus be easy to restore harmonious relations. But if the\r\n    Legations are utterly destroyed and every foreign Minister put\r\n    to the sword, by what means can the outside world ever learn of\r\n    your Majesty’s present thoughtful generosity? It will be quite\r\n    vain to hope that, without supporting evidence, the Throne will\r\n    ever be able to persuade the foreign Powers of its innocence.\r\n    They are now pouring in troops on the plea of suppressing the\r\n    rebellion on behalf of China. There are many who believe that\r\n    this is merely an excuse for obtaining a permanent foothold\r\n    on Chinese territory; only the most credulous persons believe\r\n    in the sincerity of the professed motives of foreigners. We,\r\n    your Memorialists, have not wisdom sufficient to fathom their\r\n    real object, but we maintain that these lawless Boxer mobs\r\n    should long since have been wiped out of existence. Why should\r\n    it be necessary to wait until foreign Powers demand their\r\n    extermination, and, above all, why wait until those Powers take\r\n    in hand themselves a matter with which we should have dealt?\r\n\r\n    “Thoroughly convinced that China’s only hope of preserving her\r\n    integrity lies in the preservation of the Legations, we now ask\r\n    that a strong Decree be issued, censuring Tung Fu-hsiang and\r\n    commanding the withdrawal of his troops from Peking; he should\r\n    under no circumstances be permitted to approach the Legation\r\n    quarter any more. It should be clearly laid down that any of\r\n    these Boxers or of their followers who may continue the attack\r\n    on the Legations will at once be executed. By withdrawing\r\n    the support of the Government troops from the Boxers, the\r\n    destruction of the latter will be greatly facilitated. At the\r\n    same time we earnestly request that Jung Lu be authorised to\r\n    expel every Boxer from Peking within a given limit of time, so\r\n    as to save the State from a danger which is ‘scorching its very\r\n    eyebrows,’ and to prevent any recurrence of these troubles.\r\n\r\n    “We are aware that the clear light of Heaven is temporarily\r\n    obscured by this very plague of locusts, and that our plain\r\n    speaking may very well be our own undoing. But since, in all\r\n    humility, we realise that China is like a sick man whose every\r\n    breath may be his last, our fear in speaking weighs less\r\n    heavily with us than our sense of duty. Therefore, knowing that\r\n    we face death in so doing, we submit this our Memorial, and\r\n    humbly beg that your Majesties may honour us by perusing it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the third and last of the three Memorials by Yüan Ch’ang\r\nand Hsü Ching-Ch’eng, 23rd July, 1900._\r\n\r\n    “We, your Memorialists, now humbly desire to point out that it\r\n    is more than a month since our sacred Capital was given over to\r\n    anarchy, a state of affairs which has reacted throughout the\r\n    entire Empire. We now stand confronted by the prospect of a war\r\n    with the whole civilised world, the conclusion of which can\r\n    only be an unparalleled catastrophe.\r\n\r\n    “In the reign of Hsien-Feng the Taiping and Mahomedan rebels\r\n    devastated more than ten provinces, and the uprising was not\r\n    quelled until ten years had passed. In the reign of Chia-Ch’ing\r\n    the rebellion of the ‘White Lily’ sect laid waste three or\r\n    four provinces. It is recorded in the history of these wars\r\n    that, only after the most heroic efforts, and with the greatest\r\n    difficulty, the Imperial armies succeeded in restoring order.\r\n    But these rebellions, in comparison with the present Boxer\r\n    rising, were mere trifling ailments: the State to-day stands\r\n    threatened with mortal sickness. For on the former occasions\r\n    everyone, from the Throne downwards to the lowest of the\r\n    people, was fully aware that the Taipings were rebels; but\r\n    to-day some of the highest in the land look upon the Boxers\r\n    as patriots, so that even those who know them to be rebels\r\n    are afraid to confess the truth. Our folly is bringing down\r\n    upon us the ridicule and hatred of every foreign country.\r\n    When this movement began, these men were ignorant peasants,\r\n    unversed in military matters; they drew after them large\r\n    numbers of criminals by proclaiming as their watchword ‘Prop up\r\n    the Dynasty and slay the foreigner.’ But what is the rational\r\n    interpretation of this watchword? If we are to take it as\r\n    meaning that every native of China who treads the soil of our\r\n    country and lives on its fruits should be imbued with feelings\r\n    of deep gratitude for the benevolent and virtuous rule which\r\n    the present Dynasty has maintained for over two centuries, and\r\n    would gladly repay the bounty of the Throne by fighting for its\r\n    protection, we heartily endorse the sentiment. But if it means\r\n    that, at a great crisis in our national history, it is the mob\r\n    alone that has power sufficient to ‘prop up’ our tottering\r\n    fortunes and restore tranquillity, should we not remember that\r\n    he who can ‘prop up’ can also throw down, and that the power\r\n    which ‘props up’ the Dynasty may overthrow it to-morrow? What\r\n    is this then but treasonable language, and who so greatly\r\n    daring as to utter sentiments of this kind?\r\n\r\n    “We, your Memorialists, unworthy as we are, fully realise\r\n    that the foreigners, who make their nests in the body of our\r\n    State, constitute a real danger. But the way to deal with the\r\n    situation is to reform the administration in the first place,\r\n    and in the meanwhile to deal most cautiously with all questions\r\n    of foreign policy. We must bide our time and select a weak\r\n    opponent; by this means our strength might in due course be\r\n    displayed, and old scores paid off.\r\n\r\n    “If foreign nations had gratuitously invaded our country, we\r\n    should be the first to welcome as loyal patriots everyone who\r\n    should take up arms and rush into the fray, however feeble his\r\n    efforts. But to-day, when the Throne’s relations with foreign\r\n    States were perfectly friendly, this sudden outcry of ‘Slay the\r\n    foreigner’ is nothing but a wanton provocation of hostilities\r\n    on all our frontiers. Foolishness of this kind is calculated\r\n    to destroy our Empire like a child’s toy. Besides, when they\r\n    talk of slaying the foreigner, do they mean only the foreigners\r\n    in China, or the inhabitants of every State within the five\r\n    Continents? The slaughter of Europeans in China would by no\r\n    means prevent others taking their places. But if the meaning\r\n    of this watchword is that they propose to make a clean sweep\r\n    of every non-Chinese inhabitant on the face of the earth,\r\n    any fool can see the utter impossibility of their programme.\r\n    It seems almost incredible that Yü Hsien, Yü Lu and other\r\n    Viceroys should not be capable of realising such simple facts\r\n    as these. Yü Lu in particular has gathered around him the Boxer\r\n    chiefs, and treats them as honoured guests. Thousands of the\r\n    most notorious villains throng into his official residence,\r\n    and are freely admitted on presenting a card bearing the\r\n    title of ‘Boxer.’ These men sit by the side of the Viceroy on\r\n    his judgment-seat, bringing the authority of the Throne into\r\n    contempt, and insulting the intelligence of all educated men.\r\n    Abominable scoundrels like the Boxer chiefs, Chang Te-ch’ang\r\n    and Han Yi-li, men formerly infamous throughout their province,\r\n    and now known in Peking itself as a scourge, have actually been\r\n    recommended for official posts in a public Memorial to the\r\n    Throne! Never has there been a case of a Viceroy so flagrantly\r\n    hoodwinking his Sovereign.\r\n\r\n    “In regard to Yü Lu’s Memorials reporting his military success\r\n    at Tientsin, we have caused careful inquiry to be made from\r\n    many refugees, and they one and all deny the truth of these\r\n    reports. On the contrary they unanimously assert that many\r\n    thousands of our troops have been slain by the foreigners,\r\n    and they even go so far as to say that the capture of the\r\n    Taku Forts is entirely attributable to the fact that Yü Lu\r\n    first permitted the Boxers to attack the foreign Settlements.\r\n    Their indignation against Yü Lu may possibly lead them into\r\n    some slight exaggeration in these statements, but, in our\r\n    opinion, the Viceroy’s bombastic reports are of a piece with\r\n    Tung Fu-hsiang’s braggart lies, when he tells your Majesties\r\n    that he has destroyed the Legations and annihilated their\r\n    defenders. Tung Fu-hsiang is nothing but a Kansuh robber, who,\r\n    after surrendering to the Imperial forces and obtaining some\r\n    credit in their ranks, attained his present position by the\r\n    exceptional favours of the Throne. He should have requited\r\n    your Majesty’s bounty better than by associating himself with\r\n    treasonable rogues and behaving like a common footpad. His\r\n    present actions may very well foreshadow some dastardly design\r\n    hidden in his wolf-heart.\r\n\r\n    “Yü Lu is one of the highest officials in the Empire, and very\r\n    different from military men of the Tung Fu-hsiang type. It is\r\n    hard to explain his blear-eyed stupidity. No doubt he has been\r\n    led astray by the deceitful representations of your Majesty’s\r\n    Ministers, who have even led the Throne to depart from the path\r\n    of wisdom formerly followed. It is these Ministers who are\r\n    entirely to blame.\r\n\r\n    “The Grand Secretary, Hsü T’ung, was born stupid; he knows\r\n    nothing of the needs and dangers of our times. Grand Councillor\r\n    Kang Yi, an obstinate bigot, herds with traitors and fawns\r\n    on rebels; Ch’i Hsiu is arrogant and obstinate; while Chao\r\n    Shu-ch’iao, the President of the Board of Punishments, is\r\n    crafty-hearted and a master of sycophancy.\r\n\r\n    “After the first entry of the Boxers into Peking, your\r\n    Majesties held a special audience, at which all the Princes and\r\n    Ministers were present, and our advice was asked in regard to\r\n    the adoption of a policy of encouragement or repression. Your\r\n    Memorialists replied that the Boxers were anything but patriots\r\n    and were of no use against foreigners; at the same time we\r\n    earnestly begged that war should not be lightly declared\r\n    against the whole world. It was on this occasion that Hsü\r\n    Tung, Kang Yi, and the rest of them actually dared to rebuke\r\n    us in the presence of the Throne. Now, if it were a fact that\r\n    a hundred thousand newly sharpened swords might suffice to\r\n    overcome our enemies, we, your Memorialists, by no means devoid\r\n    of natural feelings of patriotism, would welcome the day when\r\n    these foreigners might once for all be smitten hip and thigh.\r\n    But if such a result can by no means be achieved under existing\r\n    conditions, then it is not we who deserve the name of traitors,\r\n    but those Ministers who, by their errors, have led the State to\r\n    the brink of disaster.\r\n\r\n    “When, in the 5th Moon, your Majesties ordered Kang Yi and\r\n    Chao Shu-ch’iao to proceed to Cho Chou and order the Boxers\r\n    to disperse, the latter forced these Ministers to go down\r\n    upon their knees and burn incense before their altar while\r\n    they chanted their nonsensical incantations. Chao Shu-ch’iao\r\n    knew perfectly well the degrading folly of this performance,\r\n    and openly lamented his part in it; but he had not courage\r\n    sufficient to contradict Kang Yi, who believed in the Boxers’\r\n    magic, so that, upon his returning, he joined Kang Yi in\r\n    reporting to the Throne that the Boxers had all dispersed.\r\n    But if they have been dispersed, how comes it now that their\r\n    numbers have been so greatly increased? And how does the Throne\r\n    propose to deal with Ministers who dare to memorialise in this\r\n    haphazard manner?\r\n\r\n    “Tientsin has already fallen, and the foreign troops draw\r\n    nearer every day. So far, no magical arts of the Boxers have\r\n    availed us anything, and it is our deliberate opinion that,\r\n    within a month, the enemy will be knocking at the gates of\r\n    our Capital. We ask your Majesties to consider the dire\r\n    consequences of the situation, and the possibility of the\r\n    desecration of the shrines of your sacred ancestors. Our minds\r\n    are filled with horror at the thought of what may occur. But in\r\n    the meantime Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, and the rest of them laugh and\r\n    talk together. The ship is sinking, but they remain splendidly\r\n    unconcerned, just as if they believed in the Boxers as a tower\r\n    of refuge. From such men, the State can no more derive council\r\n    than from idiots and drunkards. Even some of the highest in the\r\n    land, your Majesty’s own Ministers and members of the Grand\r\n    Council, have bowed the knee before the Boxers. Many a Prince’s\r\n    palace and a ducal mansion has been converted into a shrine\r\n    for the Boxer cult. These Boxers are fools, but they have been\r\n    clever enough all the same to befool Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, and\r\n    their followers. Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, and the rest of them are\r\n    fools, but they in their turn have contrived to befool the\r\n    Princes and Nobles of the Imperial clan. All our calamities\r\n    may be directly traced to these Ministers, to Hsü T’ung, Kang\r\n    Yi, and the rest of them, and unless your Majesties will order\r\n    their immediate decapitation, thereby vindicating the majesty\r\n    of the law, it is inevitable that every official in and near\r\n    the Court must accept the Boxer heresies, and other Provincial\r\n    Governors, following the lead of Yü Lu and Yü Hsien, will adopt\r\n    and spread them.\r\n\r\n    “And not only on Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, and their followers should\r\n    the Imperial wrath fall, but also upon those in high places\r\n    whose midsummer madness has led them to protect and encourage\r\n    the Boxers. Their close relationship to your Majesties, or\r\n    their position as Imperial clansmen, should in no wise protect\r\n    them from the penalty of their guilt. Thus only can the\r\n    foreigners be led to recognise that this Boxer madness, this\r\n    challenge to the world in arms, was the work of a few misguided\r\n    officials, and in no sense an expression of the intentions or\r\n    wishes of the Throne. War will then immediately give way to\r\n    peace, and the altars of our gods will remain inviolate. And\r\n    when these things have come to pass, may your Majesties be\r\n    pleased to order the execution of your Memorialists, so that\r\n    the spirits of Hsü Tung, Kang Yi, and their associates may be\r\n    appeased. Smilingly should we go to our death, and enter the\r\n    realms of Hades. In a spirit of uncontrollable indignation and\r\n    alarm, we present this Memorial with tears, and beg that your\r\n    Majesties may deign to peruse it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nSIDELIGHTS ON TZŬ HSI’S STATECRAFT\r\n\r\n\r\nYüan Chang and Hsü Ch’ing-ch’eng were not alone in warning Her Majesty\r\nof the danger and folly of her Boxer proclivities. At the beginning of\r\nthe crisis Liu K’un-yi, the aged Viceroy of Nanking, sorely distressed at\r\nthe suicidal policy into which she had been led, wrote and despatched,\r\nby telegram and swift couriers, a Memorial, in which he implored her\r\nto put a stop to the attacks on the Legations. Tzŭ Hsi’s reply to this\r\ndocument clearly reveals the indecision which characterised her at this\r\nperiod, her hopes of revenge on the hated foreigner struggling ever\r\nwith her fears of impending disaster. The diary of Ching Shan has shown\r\nus the woman under the fierce stress of her conflicting emotions and\r\nswiftly-changing impulses, of those moods which found their alternating\r\nexpression in the ebb and flow of the struggle around the Legations\r\nfor more than a month after she had received and answered the southern\r\nViceroy’s Memorial. Of his unswerving loyalty she had no more doubt than\r\nof that of Jung Lu, and his ripe wisdom had stood her in good stead these\r\nmany years. Nevertheless, his advice could not turn her from the path\r\nof revenge, from her dreams of power unrestrained. All it could effect,\r\naided, no doubt, by the tidings of the Allies’ capture of the Taku Forts,\r\nwas to cause her to prepare possible by-paths and bolt-holes of escape\r\nand exoneration. To this end she addressed direct appeals, a tissue of\r\nartless fabrications, to the Sovereigns and chief rulers of the Great\r\nPowers, and proceeded next to display her sympathy with the besieged\r\nMinisters in the Legations by presents of fruits and vegetables, to which\r\nshe subsequently referred with pride as convincing proof of her good\r\nfaith and goodwill. Her Majesty, in fact, was induced to hedge, while\r\nnever abandoning hope that Prince Tuan and his Boxers would make good\r\ntheir boast and drive the barbarians into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy’s Memorial is chiefly interesting as an example of that chief\r\nand unalterable sentiment which actuates the Chinese _literati_ and\r\nhas been one of the strongest pillars of Manchu rule, namely, that the\r\nEmperor is infallible, a sentiment based on the fact that complete and\r\nunquestioning loyalty to the Throne is the essential cornerstone of the\r\nwhole fabric of Confucian morality, filial piety, and ancestral worship.\r\nWhile deprecating the Imperial folly, the Viceroy is therefore compelled\r\nto ascribe it to everyone but Her Majesty, and to praise the Imperial\r\nwisdom and benevolence.\r\n\r\nHis Memorial is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The present war is due to bandits spreading slaughter\r\n    and arson on the pretext of paying off a grudge against\r\n    Christianity; thus we are face to face with a serious crisis.\r\n    The Powers are uniting to send troops and squadrons to attack\r\n    China on the plea of protecting their subjects and suppressing\r\n    this rebellion. Our position is critical and the provinces\r\n    are naturally bound to look now to their defences. I have\r\n    already made the necessary preparations, so that if those\r\n    hordes of foreigners do invade us, we shall resist them with\r\n    all our might. I feel that our Sovereigns are displaying\r\n    glorious virtue and that your Majesties are as bountiful as the\r\n    Almighty. Your indulgence to the men from afar indicates the\r\n    boundless magnanimity and good faith which animate all your\r\n    actions.\r\n\r\n    “At present, the first essential is to make the Throne’s\r\n    embarrassments, which have led up to the present situation,\r\n    widely known, as well as the quality of consistent kindness\r\n    with which you are imbued. By so doing, rebels will be deprived\r\n    of any pretext for further rioting.\r\n\r\n    “At the beginning of the war, my colleagues and I issued a\r\n    proclamation bidding the people go about their avocations as\r\n    usual, and not to give heed to suspicious rumours. A petition\r\n    has now reached me from Chinese residents abroad to urge\r\n    effective protection for foreigners in China, so that there may\r\n    be no risk of revenge being taken on themselves. The language\r\n    used is very strong, and we have taken advantage of the visit\r\n    of the foreign Consuls, who suggested certain measures for\r\n    the protection of missionaries and merchants, to give orders\r\n    to the Shanghai Taotai to come to an arrangement with them in\r\n    regard to the preservation of peace in the Yangtsze valley,\r\n    and at Soochow and Hangchow. This arrangement will hold good\r\n    so long as they do not invade the region in question. The\r\n    Consuls have telegraphed to their respective Governments, and\r\n    I to our Ministers abroad, explaining fully this arrangement.\r\n    The Germans, owing to the murder of their Minister, were\r\n    disposed to oppose it, but finally, under compulsion from their\r\n    colleagues, gave their consent also.\r\n\r\n    “I respectfully quote your Majesties’ decree of the 29th of\r\n    the 5th Moon (June 25th): ‘The foreign Ministers are now in a\r\n    desperately dangerous position; we are still doing our best to\r\n    protect them.’ The decree proceeds to direct us to guard well\r\n    our respective provinces and to take such steps as policy may\r\n    dictate at this emergency. Again, on the 3rd of the 6th Moon\r\n    (June 29th), your decree to our Ministers abroad states ‘We are\r\n    now sending troops to protect the Legations, but we are weak\r\n    and can only do our best. You are to carry on the business of\r\n    your missions abroad as usual.’\r\n\r\n    “In other words, the Throne is inflicting stern and exemplary\r\n    punishment on those foreigners in Tientsin who provoked\r\n    hostilities, while doing its utmost to protect those innocent\r\n    foreign officials, merchants and missionaries who were not\r\n    responsible for those attacks. Your benevolence and the majesty\r\n    of your wrath are displayed simultaneously, manifested as\r\n    brightly as the sun and moon.\r\n\r\n    “We have again and again implored you to protect the foreign\r\n    Ministers: this is the one all-important step which must on no\r\n    account be deferred a day, not only because your Majesties’ own\r\n    anxiety recognises its necessity, but because the crisis now\r\n    forces it upon you.\r\n\r\n    “The Ministers abroad, Yang Ju and his colleagues, have\r\n    telegraphed to the effect that our first duty is to protect the\r\n    lives of the foreign Ministers and of all foreigners in China.\r\n    I therefore humbly ask you to send competent troops to protect\r\n    the Legations in Peking, and by so doing to protect the lives\r\n    of your own Envoys abroad. I also urge you to instruct the\r\n    provincial authorities to protect all foreigners within their\r\n    respective jurisdictions, and thereby to protect our Chinese\r\n    subjects residing in foreign lands. My anxiety is intense.”\r\n\r\nTo this memorial Tzŭ Hsi replied, by express courier and telegram, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Your memorial has reached us. The Throne was reluctant\r\n    lightly to enter upon hostilities, as we have already informed\r\n    the several foreign Governments and the various provincial\r\n    authorities. We have also issued several decrees ordering\r\n    protection for the Ministers and foreign residents all over\r\n    China. Hence our ideas seem to be identical with your own.[101]\r\n    Happily all the Ministers, except Baron von Ketteler, are\r\n    perfectly well and quite comfortable; only a day or two ago we\r\n    sent them presents of fruits and viands, in order to show our\r\n    commiseration. If the Powers now dare to invade your provinces,\r\n    you must all protect your territories and resist with all your\r\n    might. Even though at the moment peace may prevail, you must\r\n    make most strenuous preparations against possible emergencies.\r\n    In a word, we will not willingly be the aggressors. You are\r\n    to inform our various Legations abroad of our calm and kindly\r\n    feelings towards all foreigners, so that they may think out\r\n    some plan of a peaceful settlement, in the general interest.\r\n    It is highly desirable that you give no ready ear to vague\r\n    rumours which are calculated only to lead to further lack of\r\n    unity. This decree is to be conveyed by special courier, at six\r\n    hundred _li_ (two hundred miles) a day.”\r\n\r\nA few days before this Decree, _i.e._, on the 1st of July, Her Majesty\r\nhad drafted with her own pen an explanatory decree for the edification\r\nof the foreign Powers, recounting how the Throne had been led into its\r\npresent unpleasant situation. It is interesting to note that, ten days\r\nbefore, she had offered rewards for the heads of foreigners in Peking\r\nand had sent orders to Yü Hsien to kill every foreigner in Shansi, which\r\nhe did. But Tzŭ Hsi had studied her classics and knew from her own\r\nexperience how easily dissension and jealousies could be created among\r\nthe barbarians.\r\n\r\n    “Owing to a succession of most unfortunate circumstances,\r\n    rapidly and confusedly following each other, we are utterly at\r\n    a loss to account for the situation which has brought about\r\n    hostilities between China and the Powers. Our representatives\r\n    abroad are separated from us by wide seas, and besides have no\r\n    special knowledge of the facts, and they are therefore unable\r\n    to explain to the respective Foreign Offices the real state of\r\n    the Chinese Government’s feelings. We therefore desire now to\r\n    place before you the following detailed statement of the facts.\r\n\r\n    “In the Provinces of Chihli and Shantung there has arisen\r\n    a certain class of disorderly characters who, in their\r\n    respective villages, have been wont to practise the use of the\r\n    quarter-staff and pugilism, combining these exercises with\r\n    certain magic arts and incantations. Owing to the failure of\r\n    the local Magistrates to detect and stop these proceedings,\r\n    the result has been that gradually a state of unrest has\r\n    shown itself throughout that region until, all of a sudden,\r\n    the Boxer movement assumed serious proportions. They spread\r\n    even to Peking, where they were regarded as possessed of\r\n    supernatural powers, so that they gained vast numbers of\r\n    followers and universal sympathy. Following in their train the\r\n    disorderly people of the lower sort raised a cry of ‘Death to\r\n    the Christians!’ following upon which, in the middle of the\r\n    5th Moon, they proceeded to carry their words into deeds, and\r\n    to slaughter the converts. The churches were burned, the whole\r\n    city was in an uproar, and the population passed completely out\r\n    of our control.\r\n\r\n    “When the first rumours of the coming disaster were noised\r\n    abroad, the Legations asked our consent to bring up special\r\n    guards, which consent, in view of the special necessities\r\n    of the case, was readily given. In all some five hundred\r\n    foreign troops came to Peking, which in itself shows plainly\r\n    the friendly disposition of the Throne towards all foreign\r\n    nations. Under ordinary circumstances the foreign Legations\r\n    and their guards do not come in contact with the local Chinese\r\n    authorities, and have no relations with them, friendly or\r\n    otherwise; but since the arrival of these troops, the soldiers\r\n    have not confined themselves to the duty of protecting the\r\n    Legations, but have gone upon the city walls and have even\r\n    patrolled the outlying parts of the capital, with the result\r\n    that shots have been exchanged and blood has been shed.\r\n    Indeed, so great are the liberties which they have taken in\r\n    the course of their walks abroad, that on one occasion they\r\n    actually endeavoured to force their way into the Forbidden\r\n    City, which, however, they failed to do. For these reasons\r\n    great and widespread indignation has been excited against them,\r\n    and evil-doers have seized the opportunity to commit deeds\r\n    of slaughter and arson, waxing daily bolder. At this stage\r\n    the Powers endeavoured to bring up[102] reinforcements from\r\n    Tientsin, but these were cut to pieces on their journey from\r\n    the sea, and the attempt was perforce abandoned. By this time\r\n    the rebels in the two provinces had become so intermingled with\r\n    the people that it was impossible to identify them. The Throne\r\n    was by no means averse to give orders for their suppression,\r\n    but had we acted with undue haste, the result might have been a\r\n    general conflagration, and our efforts to protect the Legations\r\n    might have ended in a dire calamity. If we had proceeded to\r\n    destroy the rebels in the two provinces, no single missionary\r\n    or native Christian would have been left alive in either, so\r\n    that we had to proceed cautiously in this dilemma.\r\n\r\n    “Under these circumstances we were compelled to suggest the\r\n    temporary withdrawal of the Legations to Tientsin, and we were\r\n    proceeding to make the necessary arrangements to this end when\r\n    the German Minister was unfortunately murdered one morning on\r\n    his way to the Tsungli Yamên. This incident placed the rebel\r\n    leaders in a desperate position, like that of the man who\r\n    rides a tiger and who hesitates whether it be more dangerous\r\n    for him to continue his ride or to jump off. It became then\r\n    inexpedient that the proposed withdrawal of the Legations to\r\n    Tientsin should proceed. All we could do we did, which was to\r\n    enforce urgent measures for the due protection of the Legations\r\n    in every emergency. To our dismay, on the 16th ultimo, certain\r\n    foreign naval officers from the squadron outside Taku had an\r\n    interview with the Commandant of the forts, demanding their\r\n    surrender, and adding that, if their demand were refused, they\r\n    would take them by force on the following day. The Commandant\r\n    was naturally unable to betray the trust confided to him, and\r\n    the foreigners accordingly bombarded the forts and captured\r\n    them after a vigorous resistance. A state of war has thus been\r\n    created, but it is none of our doing; besides, how could China\r\n    be so utterly foolish, conscious as she is of her weakness, as\r\n    to declare war on the whole world at once? How could she hope\r\n    to succeed by using the services of untrained bandits for any\r\n    such a purpose? This must be obvious to the Powers.\r\n\r\n    “The above is an accurate statement of our situation,\r\n    explaining the measures unavoidably forced upon China to meet\r\n    the situation. Our representatives abroad must carefully\r\n    explain the tenor of this decree to the Governments to which\r\n    they are accredited. We are still instructing our military\r\n    Commanders to protect the Legations, and can only do our best.\r\n    In the meantime you, our Ministers, must carry on your duties\r\n    as usual, and not pose as disinterested spectators.”\r\n\r\nSupplementing this Decree, the Empress, possibly instigated by some of\r\nthe master-minds of the Grand Council, proceeded to prepare the way for a\r\ntime-honoured, and invariably successful, device of Chinese statecraft,\r\nnamely, the creation of dissension and jealousy between the Powers, and\r\nto this end she addressed telegrams to the Emperor of Russia, Queen\r\nVictoria, the Emperor of Japan, and other rulers. It is typical of the\r\ninfantile _naïveté_ of Chinese officials in such matters of foreign\r\npolicy, that copies of these extraordinary messages, intended solely to\r\nmislead public opinion abroad, should have been sent in to the (still\r\nbesieged) Legations with the cards of Prince Ch’ing, and the Ministers\r\nof the Tsungli Yamên.[103] It is certain that these artless telegrams,\r\nas well as the conciliatory instructions subsequently sent to China’s\r\nrepresentatives abroad, were but the outward and visible signs of Tzŭ\r\nHsi’s inward and spiritual misgivings caused by the fall of the Taku\r\nForts, the capture of the native city of Tientsin, and the massing of the\r\narmies of the Allies for the advance on her capital. If possible, she\r\nwould therefore make friends in advance among the humane, and invariably\r\ngullible, sovereigns of Europe, making good use of her knowledge of their\r\nlittle weaknesses in matters of foreign policy, and be ready to pose in\r\ndue course as the innocent victim of circumstance and fate. But “in the\r\nprofound seclusion of her Palace” she continued to hope against hope for\r\nthe Boxers’ promised victories and the fall of the Legations which she\r\nwas so carefully “protecting.”\r\n\r\nAnd here let us briefly digress. Students of modern Chinese history,\r\ndesirous of applying its latest lessons to future uses, will no doubt\r\nobserve, that in advising the Throne either for peace or war, all\r\nChinese and Manchu officials (no matter how good or bad from our point\r\nof view, how brave or cowardly, how honest or corrupt) agree and unite\r\nin frankly confessing to their hatred of the foreigner and all his\r\nworks. This sentiment, loudly proclaimed by the simple-minded braggart\r\nBoxers, is politely re-echoed by the _literati_, and voiced with equal\r\ncandour by the picked men of the Government, men like Yuan Shih-k’ai,\r\nJung Lu, and Liu K’un-yi. Those who pose as the friends of foreigners\r\nmerely advocate dissimulation as a matter of expediency. The thought\r\nshould give us pause, not only in accepting at their current value the\r\nposturings and pronouncements of the _monde diplomatique_ at Peking, and\r\nthe reassurances given as to our excellent relations with such-and-such\r\nofficials, but it should also lead us to consider what are the causes,\r\nin us or in them, which produce so constant and so deep a hatred? If we\r\nstudy the Memorials of high Chinese officials for the past fifty years,\r\nthe same unpleasant feature presents itself at every turn. We may meet\r\nwith exceptional cases, here and there, like Yüan Ch’ang, who will\r\nprofess respect for the European, but even his respect will be qualified\r\nand never go to the length of intimate friendship. Our perennial\r\ngullibility, that faculty which makes the Chinese classical “allurements”\r\ninvariably successful with the foreigner, accounts, no doubt, to some\r\nextent for the Chinese official’s contempt for our intelligence, and\r\nfor our failure to learn by experience. It is fairly certain that the\r\nBoxers of to-morrow will be pooh-poohed (if not applauded) in advance\r\nby our Chinese Secretariats, as they were in 1900. But for the Chinese\r\nofficial’s unchanging hostility towards us, no such explanation offers,\r\nand it is perhaps, therefore, most satisfactory to our _amour propre_ to\r\nassume that his attitude is dictated by feelings similar to those which\r\ninspired Demetrius of the Ephesians, ostensibly fearful for the cult of\r\nDiana, but in reality disturbed for his own livelihood.\r\n\r\nTo return. The following are translations of the telegrams sent under\r\ndate 3rd July, by order of the Empress Dowager, to the Emperor of Russia,\r\nQueen Victoria, and the Emperor of Japan. The text of those which were\r\nsent at the same time to the Presidents of the French and American\r\nRepublics, and which were dated, curiously enough, on the 19th of June\r\n(the Taku Forts fell on the 16th), have been published in Monsieur\r\nCordier’s most accurate and painstaking work, _Les Relations de la\r\nChine_, Vol. III.\r\n\r\nTelegram dated 3rd July:—\r\n\r\n    “To the Emperor of Russia:—Greeting to your Majesty! For over\r\n    two hundred and fifty years our neighbouring Empires have\r\n    enjoyed unbroken relations of friendship, more cordial than\r\n    those existing between any other Powers.\r\n\r\n    “Recent ill-feeling created between converts to Christianity\r\n    and the rest of our people have afforded an opportunity to\r\n    evil-disposed persons and rebels to create disturbances,\r\n    and the result has been that the foreign Powers have been\r\n    led to believe that the Throne itself is a party to their\r\n    proceedings and is hostile to Christianity. Your Majesty’s\r\n    representative at my Court (M. de Giers) has actually requested\r\n    our Foreign Office to suppress the rebellion and thus to allay\r\n    the suspicions of the Powers. But at the time that he made\r\n    this request, Peking was thoroughly infested with rebels, who\r\n    had stirred up the people and gained for themselves no small\r\n    prestige. Not only our soldiery but the mass of the people were\r\n    burning for revenge against those who practised the foreign\r\n    religion, and even certain Princes of our Imperial Clan joined\r\n    in the movement, declaring that there was no room in the\r\n    Celestial Kingdom for Christianity and the ancient religions\r\n    of the soil. My chief anxiety has been lest any precipitate\r\n    action on the part of the Government might lead to some dire\r\n    catastrophe (_i.e._, the destruction of the Legations), and\r\n    I feared, too, that the anti-foreign movement might break\r\n    out simultaneously at the Treaty Ports in the South, which\r\n    would have made the position hopeless. I was doing my utmost\r\n    to find a way out of the dilemma when the foreign Powers,\r\n    evidently failing to realise the difficulties of our situation,\r\n    precipitated matters by the bombardment and capture of the\r\n    Taku Forts: now we are confronted with all the dire calamities\r\n    of war, and the confusion in our Empire is greater than ever\r\n    before. Amongst all the Powers, none has enjoyed such friendly\r\n    relations with China as Russia. On a former occasion I deputed\r\n    Li Hung-chang to proceed to your Majesty’s capital as my\r\n    special Envoy; he drew up on our behalf and concluded with your\r\n    country a secret Treaty of Alliance, which is duly recorded in\r\n    the Imperial Archives.\r\n\r\n    “And now that China has incurred the enmity of the civilised\r\n    world by stress of circumstances beyond our power to control,\r\n    I must perforce rely upon your country to act as intermediary\r\n    and peacemaker on our behalf. I now make this earnest and\r\n    sincere appeal to your Majesty, begging that you may be\r\n    pleased to come forward as arbitrator, and thus to relieve\r\n    the difficulties of our situation. We await with anxiety your\r\n    gracious reply.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day the Empress Dowager addressed Her Majesty Queen Victoria\r\nin a telegram which was sent in the Emperor’s name and forwarded through\r\nthe Chinese Minister in London. Its text runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “To your Majesty, greeting!—In all the dealings of England with\r\n    the Empire of China, since first relations were established\r\n    between us, there has never been any idea of territorial\r\n    aggrandisement on the part of Great Britain, but only a keen\r\n    desire to promote the interests of her trade. Reflecting on\r\n    the fact that our country is now plunged into a dreadful\r\n    condition of warfare, we bear in mind that a large proportion\r\n    of China’s trade, seventy or eighty per cent., is done with\r\n    England: moreover, your Customs duties are the lightest in the\r\n    world, and few restrictions are made at your sea-ports in the\r\n    matter of foreign importations; for these reasons our amicable\r\n    relations with British merchants at our Treaty Ports have\r\n    continued unbroken for the last half century, to our mutual\r\n    benefit.\r\n\r\n    “But a sudden change has now occurred and general suspicion\r\n    has been created against us. We would therefore ask you\r\n    now to consider that if, by any conceivable combination of\r\n    circumstances, the independence of our Empire should be lost,\r\n    and the Powers unite to carry out their long plotted schemes\r\n    to possess themselves of our territory, the results to your\r\n    country’s interests would be disastrous and fatal to your\r\n    trade. At this moment our Empire is striving to the utmost to\r\n    raise an army and funds sufficient for its protection; in the\r\n    meanwhile we rely upon your good services to act as mediator,\r\n    and now anxiously await your decision.”\r\n\r\nAgain, in the name of the Emperor and through the Chinese Minister at\r\nTokio, the following message was addressed to the Emperor of Japan:—\r\n\r\n    “To your Majesty, greeting!—The Empires of China and Japan\r\n    hang together, even as the lips and the teeth, and the\r\n    relations existing between them have always been sympathetic.\r\n    Last month we were plunged in deep grief when we learned of\r\n    the murder of the Chancellor of your Legation in Peking; we\r\n    were about to arrest and punish the culprits when the Powers,\r\n    unnecessarily suspicious of our motives, seized the Taku Forts,\r\n    and we found ourselves involved in all the horrors of war. In\r\n    face of the existing situation, it appears to us that at the\r\n    present time the Continents of Europe and Asia are opposed\r\n    to each other, marshalling their forces for a conflict of\r\n    irreconcilable ambitions; everything therefore depends upon our\r\n    two Asiatic Empires standing firm together at this juncture.\r\n    The earth-hungry Powers of the West, whose tigerish eyes of\r\n    greed are fixed in our direction, will certainly not confine\r\n    their attention to China. In the event of our Empire being\r\n    broken up, Japan in her turn will assuredly be hard pressed\r\n    to maintain her independence. The community of our interests\r\n    renders it clearly imperative that at this crisis we should\r\n    disregard all trifling causes of discord, and consider only the\r\n    requirements of the situation, as comrade nations. We rely upon\r\n    your Majesty to come forward as arbitrator, and anxiously await\r\n    your gracious reply to this appeal.”\r\n\r\nThese remarkable effusions have been inscribed in the annals of the\r\nDynasty, by order of Her Majesty, those same annals from which all\r\nher Boxer Edicts have been solemnly expunged for purposes of historic\r\naccuracy. One cannot but hope that, in process of time, consideration of\r\nfacts like these may cure European diplomacy and officialdom generally of\r\nits unreasoning reverence for the Chinese written character, a species of\r\nfetish-worship imbibed from the native pundit and aggravated by the sense\r\nof importance which knowledge of this ancient language so frequently\r\nconfers.\r\n\r\nThese Imperial messages throw into strong relief the elementary\r\nsimplicity of China’s foreign policy, a quality which foreigners\r\nfrequently misunderstand, in the general belief that the Oriental mind\r\nconceals great depths of subtlety and secret information. Looking at\r\nthese documents in the light of the known facts of China’s political\r\nsituation at that moment, and stripping them of all artificial glamour,\r\nit becomes almost inconceivable that any Government should publish to\r\nthe world and file in its archives such puerile productions. But it\r\nis frequently the case that this very kindergarten element in Chinese\r\npolitics is a stumbling-block to the elaborate and highly specialised\r\nmachinery of European diplomacy, and that, being at a loss how to deal\r\nwith the suspiciously transparent artifices of the elderly children of\r\nthe Waiwupu, the foreigner excuses and consoles himself by attributing\r\nto them occult faculties and resources of a very high order. If one\r\nmust be continually worsted, it is perhaps not unwise to attribute to\r\none’s adversary the qualities of Macchiavelli, Talleyrand and Metternich\r\ncombined. As far as British interests are concerned, one of the chief\r\nlessons emphasised by the events of the past ten years in China is, that\r\nthe reform of our diplomatic machinery (and particularly of the Consular\r\nservice) is urgently needed, a reform for which more than one British\r\nMinister has vainly pleaded in Downing Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT FROM PEKING AND THE COURT IN EXILE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diarist, Ching Shan, has described in detail the flight of the\r\nEmpress Dowager and Emperor from Peking, before dawn, on the morning of\r\nthe 15th August. From an account of the Court’s journey, subsequently\r\nwritten by the Grand Secretary, Wang Wen-shao, to friends in Chekiang,\r\nand published in one of the vernacular papers of Shanghai, we obtain\r\nvaluable corroboration of the diarist’s accuracy, together with much\r\ninteresting information.\r\n\r\nWang Wen-shao overtook their Majesties at Huai-lai on the 18th August;\r\nfor the past three days they had suffered dangers and hardships\r\ninnumerable. On the evening of the 19th they had stopped at Kuanshih\r\n(seventy _li_ from Peking), where they slept in the Mosque. There the\r\nMahommedan trading firm of “Tung Kuang yü” (the well-known contractors\r\nfor the hire of pack animals for the northern caravan trade) had supplied\r\nthem with the best of the poor food available—coarse flour, vegetables,\r\nand millet porridge—and had provided mule litters for the next stage of\r\nthe journey. As the troops of the escort had been ordered to remain at\r\nsome distance behind, so long as there was any risk of pursuit by the\r\nAllies’ cavalry, their Majesties’ arrival was unannounced, and their\r\nidentity unsuspected. As they descended from their carts, travel-stained,\r\nweary, and distressed, they were surrounded by a large crowd of refugee\r\nidlers and villagers, eager for news from the capital. An eye-witness of\r\nthe scene has reported that, looking nervously about him, the Emperor\r\nsaid, “We have to thank the Boxers for this,” whereupon the Old Buddha,\r\nundaunted even at the height of her misfortunes, bade him be silent.\r\n\r\nNext day they travelled, by mule litter, ninety _li_ (thirty-two miles),\r\nand spent the night at Ch’a-Tao, just beyond the Great Wall. Here no\r\npreparations of any kind had been made for their reception, and they\r\nsuffered much hardship, sleeping on the brick platform (_k’ang_) without\r\nany adequate bedding. But the Magistrate of Yen-Ch’ing chou had been\r\nable to find a blue sedan-chair for Her Majesty, who had thus travelled\r\npart of the day in greater comfort. Also at midday, stopping to eat at\r\nChü-yung kuan, Li Lien-ying, the chief eunuch, had obtained a few tea\r\ncups from the villagers.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th they travelled from Ch’a-Tao to Huai-lai, a hard stage\r\nof fifty _li_. Some of the officials and Chamberlains of the Court\r\nnow joined their Majesties, so that the party consisted of seventeen\r\ncarts, in addition to the Old Buddha’s palanquin and the Emperor’s mule\r\nlitter. As the _cortège_ advanced, and the news of their flight was\r\nspread abroad, rumours began to be circulated that they were pretenders,\r\npersonating the Son of Heaven and the Old Buddha, rumours due, no doubt,\r\nto the fact that Her Majesty was still wearing her hair in the Chinese\r\nmanner, and that her clothes were the common ones in which she had\r\nescaped from the Forbidden City. In spite of these rumours the Magistrate\r\nof Huai-lai, a Hupeh man (Wu Yung), had received no intimation of their\r\nMajesties’ coming, and, when the Imperial party, accompanied by an\r\nenormous crowd, entered his Yamên, he had no time to put on his official\r\nrobes, but rushed down to receive them as he was. After prostrating\r\nhimself, he wanted to clear out the noisy and inquisitive rabble, but\r\nthe Old Buddha forbade him, saying, “Not so; let them crowd around us\r\nas much as they like. It amuses me to see these honest country folk.”\r\nHere, after three days of coarse fare, the Empress Dowager rejoiced once\r\nmore in a meal of birds’-nest soup and sharks’ fins, presented by the\r\nMagistrate, who also furnished her with an outfit of woman’s clothing and\r\nsuits for the Emperor and the Heir Apparent, for all of which he received\r\nHer Majesty’s repeated and grateful thanks.\r\n\r\nIt was here, at Huai-lai, while the Court was taking a day’s rest, that\r\nWang Wen-shao came up with them. He was cordially, even affectionately,\r\ngreeted by the Old Buddha, who condoled with him on the hardships to\r\nwhich he had been exposed, and insisted on his sharing her birds’-nest\r\nsoup, which, she said, he would surely enjoy as much as she had done\r\nafter so many and great privations. She rebuked the Emperor for not\r\ngreeting the aged Councillor with warm thanks for his touching devotion\r\nto the Throne.\r\n\r\nFrom Huai-lai, Prince Ch’ing was ordered to return to Peking to negotiate\r\nterms of peace with the Allies. Knowing the difficulties of this task, he\r\nwent reluctantly; before leaving he had a long audience with Her Majesty,\r\nwho assured him of her complete confidence in his ability to make terms,\r\nand bade him adopt a policy similar to that of Prince Kung in 1860.\r\n\r\nWang Wen-shao’s account of the first part of the Court’s journey is\r\nsufficiently interesting to justify textual reproduction.\r\n\r\n    “Their Majesties fled from the palace at the dawn of day in\r\n    common carts. It was only after their arrival at Kuanshih that\r\n    they were provided with litters. The Emperor and Prince P’u Lun\r\n    rode on one cart until their arrival at Huai-lai, where the\r\n    District Magistrate furnished a palanquin, and later on, at\r\n    Hsüan-hua, four large sedan chairs were found for the Imperial\r\n    party. It was at this point that the Emperor’s Consort overtook\r\n    their Majesties.\r\n\r\n    “So hurried was the flight that no spare clothes had been\r\n    taken; the Empress Dowager was very shabbily dressed, so as to\r\n    be almost unrecognisable, the Chinese mode of hair-dressing\r\n    producing a very remarkable alteration in her appearance.\r\n    On the first night after leaving Peking, they slept, like\r\n    travellers of the lowest class, on the raised brick platform\r\n    of the inn, where not even rice was obtainable for the evening\r\n    meal, so that they were compelled to eat common porridge made\r\n    of millet. In all the disasters recorded in history, never has\r\n    there been such a pitiful spectacle.\r\n\r\n    “It was only after reaching Huai-lai that their condition\r\n    improved somewhat, but even then the number of personal\r\n    attendants and eunuchs was very small, and not a single\r\n    concubine was there to wait upon the Old Buddha. For the first\r\n    few days’ flight, neither Prince Li, nor Jung Lu, nor Ch’i Hsiu\r\n    (all of them Grand Councillors), were in attendance so that\r\n    Her Majesty nominated Prince Tuan to serve on the Council. She\r\n    reviled him at the outset severely, reproaching him for the\r\n    misfortunes which had overtaken the Dynasty, but as time went\r\n    on, as he shared with her the privations and troubles of the\r\n    day’s journey, she became more gracious towards him. This was\r\n    to some extent due to the very great influence which Prince\r\n    Tuan’s wife exercised at Court.\r\n\r\n    “When I reached Huai-lai, the Court consisted of the Princes\r\n    Tuan, Ching, Na, Su, and P’u Lun, with a following of high\r\n    officials led by Kang Yi, and some twenty Secretaries. General\r\n    Ma’s troops and some of the Banner Corps of Prince Tuan formed\r\n    the Imperial escort; and they plundered every town and village\r\n    on their line of march. This, however, is hardly remarkable,\r\n    because all the shops had been closed and there were no\r\n    provisions to be purchased anywhere.\r\n\r\n    “To go back for a few days. Yü Lu (Viceroy of Chihli) shot\r\n    himself in a coffin shop at a place south of the Hunting Park,\r\n    and Li Ping-heng took poison after the defeat of his troops\r\n    at T’ungchow. The Court’s flight had already been discussed\r\n    after the first advance of the Allies from T’ungchow towards\r\n    Peking; but the difficulty in providing sufficient transport\r\n    was considered insuperable. On the 19th of the Moon a steady\r\n    cannonade began at about midnight, and, from my house in Magpie\r\n    Lane, one could note, by the volume of sound, that the attack\r\n    was steadily advancing closer to the city, and eventually\r\n    bullets came whistling as thick as hail. The bombardment\r\n    reached its height at about noon on the 20th, when news was\r\n    brought that two gates of the Imperial City had been taken\r\n    by storm. I was unable to verify this report. It was my turn\r\n    for night duty at the Palace, but after the last audience, I\r\n    was unable to enter the Forbidden City, as all its gates were\r\n    barred. It was only at 7 A.M. on the 21st inst. (August 15th)\r\n    that I was able to gain admittance to the Forbidden City, and\r\n    then I learned that their Majesties had hurriedly fled. On the\r\n    previous day five urgent audiences with the Grand Council had\r\n    been held; at the last of these only Kang Yi, Chao Shu ch’iao,\r\n    and myself were present. Sadly regarding us, the Old Buddha\r\n    said, ‘I see there are only three of you left. No doubt all the\r\n    rest have fled, leaving us, mother and son, to our fate. I want\r\n    you all to come with me on my journey.’ Turning to me she then\r\n    said, ‘You are too old. I would not wish you to share in all\r\n    this hardship. Follow us as best you can later on.’ The Emperor\r\n    expressed his wishes in the same sense.\r\n\r\n    “By this time it was nearly midnight, and they still hesitated\r\n    about leaving the city; judge then of my surprise to learn\r\n    that, at the first streak of dawn, their Majesties had left\r\n    the city in indescribable disorder and frantic haste. I could\r\n    not return to my house that day because all the gates of the\r\n    Imperial City were closed, but at 10 A.M. on the following day,\r\n    I made my way out of the Houmen.[104] On my way I came across\r\n    Jung Lu; he had fainted in his chair, and had been forsaken\r\n    by his cowardly bearers. He said: ‘This is the end. You and I\r\n    never believed in these Boxers; see now to what a pass they\r\n    have brought the Old Buddha. If you see Her Majesty, tell her\r\n    that I have gone to rally the troops, and that, if I live, I\r\n    will join her later on.’\r\n\r\n    “After leaving Jung Lu, I made my way to a little temple which\r\n    lies midway between the North and the North-West Gates of the\r\n    city, and there I rested a while. It was the opinion of the\r\n    Abbot in charge that the foreigners would burn every temple\r\n    of the city, as all of them had been used by the Boxers for\r\n    their magic rites, and he said that, in times of dire peril\r\n    such as this, it was really inconvenient for him to offer\r\n    any hospitality to visitors. Just at this moment news was\r\n    brought us that the foreign troops were on the wall of the\r\n    city, between the two gates nearest to us, and that they were\r\n    firing down upon the streets; the city was already invested,\r\n    but the foreigners were not molesting civilians, though\r\n    they were shooting all ‘braves’ and men in uniform. As the\r\n    priest declined to receive me, I sought refuge at the house\r\n    of a man named Han, retainer in the Imperial Household, who\r\n    lived close by. All my chair-bearers and servants had fled.\r\n    Shortly after noon I heard that one might still leave Peking\r\n    by the Hsi-chih Men; so leaving everything—carts, chairs, and\r\n    animals—where they were, I started off at dusk on foot with\r\n    such money and clothing as I had on my person. The road ahead\r\n    of me was blocked by a dense crowd of refugees. I took the\r\n    road by the Drum Tower, skirting the lakes to the north of the\r\n    Imperial City. Towards evening a dreadful thunderstorm came\r\n    on, so I took refuge for the night with the Ching family. The\r\n    bombardment had ceased by this time, but the whole northern\r\n    part of the Imperial City appeared to be in flames, which\r\n    broke out in fresh places all through the night. At three in\r\n    the morning we heard that the West Gates were opened, and that\r\n    the City Guards had fled, but that the foreigners had not yet\r\n    reached that part of the city.\r\n\r\n    “I had intended to travel by cart, but the disorganised troops\r\n    had by this time seized every available beast of burden. My\r\n    second son, however, was luckily able to persuade Captain Liu\r\n    to fetch one of my carts out from the city, and this was done\r\n    after several narrow escapes. I had left Peking on foot, but\r\n    at the bridge close to the North-West Gate I found this cart\r\n    awaiting me, and with it my second son, who was riding on a\r\n    mule, and the five servants who remained to us following on\r\n    foot. When we reached Hai-Tien (a town which lies close to the\r\n    Summer Palace) every restaurant was closed, but we managed to\r\n    get a little food, and then hurried on after their Majesties\r\n    to Kuanshih, where we passed the night. Next day, continuing\r\n    our journey, we learned that their Majesties were halting at\r\n    Huai-lai, where we overtook them on the 24th day of the Moon.\r\n    We expect to reach T’ai-yüan fu about the middle of next week.\r\n\r\n    “The dangers of our journey are indescribable. Every shop\r\n    on the road had been plundered by bands of routed troops,\r\n    who pretend to be part of the Imperial escort. These bandits\r\n    are ahead of us at every stage of the journey, and they have\r\n    stripped the country-side bare, so that when the Imperial party\r\n    reaches any place, and the escort endeavour to commandeer\r\n    supplies, the distress of the inhabitants and the confusion\r\n    which ensues are really terrible to witness. The districts\r\n    through which we have passed are literally devastated.”\r\n\r\nFrom Huai-lai the Court moved on to Hsüan-hua fu, a three days’ march,\r\nand there remained for four days, resting and preparing for the journey\r\ninto Shansi. The Border Warden at Sha-ho chên had provided their\r\nMajesties with green (official) sedan chairs, and the usual etiquette of\r\nthe Court and Grand Council was being gradually restored. Her Majesty’s\r\nspirits were excellent, and she took a keen interest in everything.\r\nAt Chi-ming yi, for instance, she was with difficulty dissuaded from\r\nstopping to visit a temple on the summit of an adjoining hill, in honour\r\nof which shrine the Emperor Kanghsi had left a tablet carved with a\r\nmemorial inscription in verse.\r\n\r\nAt Hsüan-hua fu there was considerable disorder, but the Court enjoyed\r\nincreased comforts; thanks to the zeal and energy of the local Magistrate\r\n(Ch’en Pen). Here the Old Buddha received Prince Ch’ing’s first despatch\r\nfrom Peking, which gave a deplorable account of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Court left Hsüan-hua on the 25th August (its numbers being increased\r\nby the Emperor’s Consort with a few of her personal attendants) and spent\r\nthe night at a garrison station called Tso-Wei. The deplorable state of\r\nthe country was reflected in the accommodation they found there; for the\r\nguards had fled, and the official quarters had all been plundered and\r\nburnt, with the exception of two small rooms, evil-smelling and damp.\r\nThere was no food to be had, except bread made of sodden flour. One of\r\nthe two available rooms was occupied by the Old Buddha, the other by\r\nKuang Hsü and his Consort, while all the officials of the Court, high\r\nand low, fared as best they might in the stuffy courtyard. For once the\r\nvenerable mother’s composure deserted her. “This is abominable,” she\r\ncomplained; “the place swarms with insects, and I cannot sleep a wink. It\r\nis disgraceful that I should have come to such a pass at my time of life.\r\nMy state is worse even than that of the Emperor Hsüan-Tsung of the T’ang\r\nDynasty, who was forced to fly from his capital, and saw his favourite\r\nconcubine murdered before his very eyes.” An unsubstantiated report that\r\nthe Allies had plundered her palace treasure vaults was not calculated to\r\ncalm Her Majesty, and for a while the suite went in fear of her wrath.\r\n\r\nOn August 27th the Court crossed the Shansi border, and spent the night\r\nat T’ien-chen hsien. The local Magistrate, a Manchu, had committed\r\nsuicide after hearing of the fall of Moukden and other Manchurian cities;\r\nand the town was in a condition of ruinous disorder. Their Majesties\r\nsupped off a meal hastily provided by the Gaol Warder. But their courage\r\nwas restored by the arrival of Ts’en Ch’un-hsüan,[105] an official of\r\nhigh intelligence and courage, who greatly pleased the Old Buddha by\r\nbringing her a gift of eggs and a girdle and pouch for her pipe and purse.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th August the Court lay at Ta-t’ung fu, in the Yamên of the\r\nlocal Brigadier-General. They stayed here four days, enjoying the greatly\r\nimproved accommodation which the General’s efforts had secured for them.\r\n\r\nOn September 4th, they reached the market town of T’ai-yüeh, having\r\ntravelled thirty-five miles that day, and here again they found damp\r\nrooms and poor fare. But Her Majesty’s spirits had recovered. On the\r\n16th, while crossing the hill-pass of the “Flighting Geese,” Her Majesty\r\nordered a halt in order to enjoy the view. “It reminds me of the Jehol\r\nCountry,” she said. Then, turning to the Emperor, “After all, it’s\r\ndelightful to get away like this from Peking and to see the world, isn’t\r\nit?” “Under happier circumstances, it would be,” replied Kuang Hsü. At\r\nthis point Ts’en Ch’un-hsüan brought Her Majesty a large bouquet of\r\nyellow flowers, a present which touched her deeply: in return she sent\r\nhim a jar of butter-milk tea.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, the only accommodation which the local officials had been\r\nable to prepare at Yüan-p’ing was a mud-house belonging to one of the\r\ncommon people, in which, by an oversight, several empty coffins had\r\nbeen left. Ts’en, arriving ahead of the party, was told of this, and\r\ngalloped to make excuses to Her Majesty and take her orders. Happily,\r\nthe “Motherly Countenance” was not moved to wrath, and “the divine\r\ncondescension was manifested.” “If the coffins can be moved, move them,”\r\nshe said; “but so long as they are not in the main room, I do not greatly\r\nmind their remaining.” They were all removed, however, and the Old Buddha\r\nwas protected from possibly evil influences.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th September, at Hsin Chou, three Imperial (yellow) chairs had\r\nbeen provided by the local officials, so that their Majesties’ entrance\r\ninto T’ai-yüan fu, on the 10th, was not unimposing. The Court took up\r\nits residence in the Governor’s Yamên (that same bloodstained building\r\nin which, six weeks before, Yü Hsien had massacred the missionaries). Yü\r\nHsien, the Governor, met their Imperial Majesties outside the city walls,\r\nand knelt by the roadside as the Old Buddha’s palanquin came up. She bade\r\nher bearers stop, and called to him to approach. When he had done so,\r\nshe said: “At your farewell audience, in the last Moon of the last year,\r\nyou assured me that the Boxers were really invulnerable. Alas! You were\r\nwrong, and now Peking has fallen! But you did splendidly in carrying out\r\nmy orders and in ridding Shansi of the whole brood of foreign devils.\r\nEveryone speaks well of you for this, and I know, besides, how high is\r\nyour reputation for good and honest work. Nevertheless, and because the\r\nforeign devils are loudly calling for vengeance upon you, I may have to\r\ndismiss you from office, as I had to do with Li Ping-heng: but be not\r\ndisturbed in mind, for, if I do this, it is only to throw dust in the\r\neyes of the barbarians, for our own ends. We must just bide our time, and\r\nhope for better days.”\r\n\r\nYü Hsien kowtowed, as in duty bound, nine times, and replied: “Your\r\nMajesty’s slave caught them as in a net, and allowed neither chicken nor\r\ndog to escape: yet am I ready to accept punishment and dismissal from my\r\npost. As to the Boxers, they have been defeated because they failed to\r\nabide by the laws of the Order, and because they killed and plundered\r\ninnocent people who were not Christians.”\r\n\r\nThis conversation was clearly heard by several bystanders, one of whom\r\nreported it in a letter to Shanghai. When Yü Hsien had finished speaking,\r\nthe Old Buddha sighed, and told her bearers to proceed. A few days later\r\nshe issued the first of the Expiatory Decrees by which Yü Hsien and\r\nother Boxer leaders were dismissed from office, but not before she had\r\nvisited the courtyard where the hapless missionaries had met their fate,\r\nand cross-examined Yü Hsien on every detail of that butchery. And it is\r\nrecorded, that, while she listened eagerly to this tale of unspeakable\r\ncowardice and cruelty, the Heir Apparent was swaggering noisily up and\r\ndown the courtyard, brandishing the huge sword given him by Yü Hsien,\r\nwith which his devil’s work had been done. No better example could be\r\ncited of this remarkable woman’s primitive instincts and elemental\r\npassion of vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nOnce more, during the Court’s residence at T’ai-yüan, did the Old Buddha\r\nand Yü Hsien meet. At this audience, realising the determination of\r\nthe foreigners to exact the death penalty in this case, and realising\r\nalso the Governor’s popularity with the inhabitants of T’ai-yüan, she\r\ntold him, with unmistakable significance, that the price of coffins was\r\nrising, a plain but euphemistic hint that he would do well to commit\r\nsuicide before a worse fate overtook him.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty was much gratified at the splendid accommodation provided\r\nfor her at T’ai-yüan, and particularly pleased to see all the gold and\r\nsilver vessels and utensils that had been made in 1775 for Ch’ien Lung’s\r\nprogress to the sacred shrines of Wu-T’ai shan; they had been polished\r\nup for the occasion and made a brave show, so that the “Benevolent\r\nCountenance” beamed with delight. “We have nothing like this in Peking,”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARBLE BRIDGE IN THE GROUNDS OF THE LAKE PALACE.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Betines, Peking._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE GROUNDS OF THE PALACE IN THE WESTERN PARK.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Betines, Peking._]\r\n\r\nJung Lu joined the Court on the day after its arrival at T’ai-yüan, and\r\nwas most affectionately welcomed by the Old Buddha, to whom he gave\r\na full account of his journey through Chihli and of the widespread\r\ndevastation wrought by the Boxers. He had previously sent in the\r\nfollowing Memorial which clearly reflects those qualities which\r\nhad endeared him to his Imperial Mistress, and which so honourably\r\ndistinguished him from the sycophants and classical imbeciles of the\r\nCourt:—\r\n\r\n    “At dawn, on the 21st day of the 7th Moon (15th August) your\r\n    Majesty’s servant proceeded to the Gate of Reverend Peace\r\n    (inside the Palace), and learned that your Majesties’ sacred\r\n    chariot had left for the West. While there I came across Ch’ung\r\n    Ch’i,[106] the President of the Board of Revenue, and we were\r\n    proposing to hurry after your Majesties, when we learned that\r\n    the North-Eastern and Northern Gates of the city had fallen. So\r\n    we left Peking by another gate, my first object being to try\r\n    and rally some of the troops. But after several conferences\r\n    with Generals Sung Ch’ing and Tung Fu-hsiang, I was forced to\r\n    the conclusion that our repeated defeats had been too severe,\r\n    and that, in the absence of large reinforcements, there was\r\n    no hope of our being able to take the field again. Our men\r\n    were in a state of complete panic and had lost all stomach for\r\n    fighting. I therefore left and came on to Pao-t’ing fu, and\r\n    lodged there with Ch’ung Ch’i in the “Water Lily” Garden. All\r\n    night long he and I discussed the situation, hoping to see\r\n    some way out of the misfortunes which had overtaken the State.\r\n    Ch’ung Ch’i could not conceal the bitterness of his grief,\r\n    and on the morning of the next day he hanged himself in one\r\n    of the outer courtyards, leaving a letter for me in which was\r\n    enclosed his valedictory Memorial to your Majesties, together\r\n    with a set of verses written just before his death. These I\r\n    now forward for your Majesty’s gracious perusal, because I\r\n    feel that his suicide deserves your pity, just as his high\r\n    sense of duty merits your praise. He was indeed a man of the\r\n    purest integrity, and had all the will, though, alas, not\r\n    the power, to avert the misfortunes which have befallen us.\r\n    He had always looked upon the magic arts of the Boxers with\r\n    profound contempt, unworthy even of the effort of a smile\r\n    from a wise man. At this critical juncture, the loss of my\r\n    trusted colleague is indeed a heavy blow, but I am compelled\r\n    to remember that the position which I hold, all unworthily, as\r\n    your Majesty’s Commander-in-Chief, necessitates my bearing the\r\n    burden of my heavy responsibilities so long as the breath of\r\n    life is in my body.\r\n\r\n    “Such makeshift arrangements as were feasible I made for the\r\n    temporary disposal of Ch’ung Ch’i’s remains, and I now forward\r\n    the present Memorial by special courier to your Majesty,\r\n    informing you of the manner of his decease, because I hold\r\n    it to be unfitting that his end should pass unnoticed and\r\n    unhonoured. Your Majesty will, no doubt, determine on the\r\n    posthumous honours to be accorded to him.\r\n\r\n    “It is now my intention to proceed, with what speed I may, to\r\n    T’ai-yüan fu, there to pay my reverent duty to your Majesty\r\n    and to await the punishment due for my failure to avert these\r\n    calamities.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to this Memorial, Tzŭ Hsi conferred high posthumous honours upon\r\nCh’ung Ch’i, praising his loyalty and honesty.\r\n\r\nJung Lu proceeded on his journey, but at a town on the Chihli border his\r\nwife took ill and died. She had only joined him at Pao-t’ing fu. The Old\r\nBuddha welcomed him with sincere affection upon his arrival at T’ai-yüan\r\nand raised his secondary wife, the Lady Liu, to the rank of “Fu Jen”\r\nor legitimate consort. (This lady had always had great influence with\r\nthe Empress Dowager, which increased during the exile of the Court, and\r\nbecame most noticeable after the return to Peking.)\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi asked Jung Lu for his advice as to her future policy. Bluntly,\r\nas was his wont, he replied “Old Buddha, there is only one way. You must\r\nbehead Prince Tuan and all the rest of the Princes and Ministers who\r\nmisled you and then you must return to Peking.”\r\n\r\nAn incident, vouched for by a high Manchu official attached to the Court,\r\nillustrates the relations at this time existing between the Emperor,\r\nthe Empress Dowager, and Jung Lu. When the latter reached T’ai-yüan fu,\r\nKuang-Hsü sent a special messenger to summon him. “I am glad you have\r\ncome at last,” said His Majesty. “I desire that you will have Prince Tuan\r\nexecuted without delay.”\r\n\r\n“How can I do so without the Empress Dowager’s orders?” he replied. “The\r\ndays are past when no other Decree but your Majesty’s was needed.”[107]\r\n\r\nJung Lu’s position, but for the high favour of the Empress Dowager,\r\nwould have been full of danger, for he was disliked by reactionaries\r\nand reformers alike; surrounded by extremists, his intuitive common\r\nsense, his doctrine of the “happy mean” had made him many enemies. Nor\r\ncould he lay claim to a reputation for that “purest integrity” which\r\nhe had so greatly admired in his colleague Ch’ung Ch’i. At T’ai-yüan\r\nfu, he was openly denounced to the Old Buddha for having connived in\r\nthe embezzlements of a certain Ch’en Tsê-lin, who had been robbing\r\nthe military Treasury on a grand scale. Jung Lu had ordered that his\r\ndefalcations be made good, but subsequently informed the Throne that the\r\nmoney had been captured by the Allies, and the accusing Censor did not\r\nhesitate to say that the price of his conversion (brought to his quarters\r\nby the hands of a sergeant named Yao) had been forty thousand taels of\r\nsilver, twenty pounds of best birdnests, and four cases of silk. The\r\nEmpress Dowager shelved the Memorial, as was her wont, though no doubt\r\nshe used the information for the ultimate benefit of her privy purse.\r\nJung Lu also received vast sums of money and many valuable presents on\r\nhis birthday, and at the condolence ceremonies for the death of his wife,\r\nso much so that he incurred the fierce jealousy of the chief eunuch Li\r\nLien-ying, who was doing his best at this time to re-feather his own\r\nnest, despoiled by the troops of the Allies.\r\n\r\nAt T’ai-yüan fu, so many officials had joined the Court that intrigues\r\nbecame rife; there was much heartburning as to precedence and status.\r\nThose who had borne the burden and heat of the day, the dangers and the\r\nhardships of the flight from Peking, claimed special recognition and\r\nseniority at the hands of their Imperial Mistress. Each of these thought\r\nthey should be privileged above those of equal rank who had only rejoined\r\nthe Court when all danger was past, and still more so above those who\r\nwere now hurrying up from the provinces in search of advancement.\r\n\r\nThe chief topic of discussion at audience, and at meetings of the\r\nGrand Council, was the question of the Court’s return to Peking, or of\r\nthe removal of the Capital to one of the chief cities of the South or\r\nWest. Chang Chih-tung had put in a Memorial, strongly recommending the\r\ncity of Tang-Yang in Hupei, on account of its central position. One of\r\nthe arguments gravely put forward by the “scholarly bungler” for this\r\nproposal was, that the characters “Tang-Yang” (which mean “facing south”)\r\nwere in themselves of good augury, and an omen of better days to come,\r\nbecause the Emperor always sits with his face to the south. Chang’s\r\nenemies at Court saw in this idea a veiled hint that the Emperor should\r\nbe restored to power.\r\n\r\nBut Jung Lu was now _facile princeps_ in the Old Buddha’s counsels, and\r\nat audience his colleagues of the Grand Council (Lu Ch’uan-lin and Wang\r\nWen-shao) followed his lead implicitly. He never ceased to advise the\r\nEmpress to return forthwith to Peking, and, when at a later date she\r\ndecided on this step, it was rather because of her faith in his sound\r\njudgment than because of the many Memorials sent in from other high\r\nofficials. During the Court’s stay at T’ai-yüan fu, argument on this\r\nsubject was continual, but towards the end of September rumours reached\r\nHer Majesty that the Allies were sending a swift punitive expedition to\r\navenge the murdered missionaries; this decided her to leave at once for\r\nHsi-an fu, where she would feel safe from further pursuit. The Court left\r\naccordingly on the 30th September; but as the preservation of “face”\r\nbefore the world is a fundamental principle, with Empresses as with\r\nslave-girls, in China, her departure was announced in the following brief\r\nEdict:—\r\n\r\n    “As Shansi province is suffering from famine, which makes it\r\n    very difficult to provide for our needs, and as the absence\r\n    of telegraphic communication there causes all manner of\r\n    inconvenient delays, we are compelled to continue our progress\r\n    westwards to Hsi-an.”\r\n\r\nThe journey into Shensi was made with all due provision for the dignity\r\nand comfort of their Majesties, but the Empress was overcome by grief\r\n_en route_ at the death of Kang Yi, chief patron of the Boxers, and the\r\nmost bigoted and violent of all the reactionaries near the Throne. He\r\nfell ill at a place called Hou Ma, and died in three days, although the\r\nVice-President of the Board of Censors, Ho Nai-ying, obtained leave to\r\nremain behind and nurse him. The Old Buddha was most reluctant to leave\r\nthe invalid, and showed unusual emotion. After his death she took a\r\nkindly interest in his son (who followed the Court to Hsi-an) and would\r\nfrequently speak to him of his father’s patriotism and loyalty.\r\n\r\nAt Hsi-an fu the Court occupied the Governor’s official residence, into\r\nwhich Her Majesty removed after residing for a while in the buildings\r\nformerly set apart for the temporary accommodation of the Viceroy of\r\nKansuh and Shensi on visits of inspection. Both Yamêns had been prepared\r\nfor Their Majesties’ use; the walls had been painted Imperial red,\r\nand the outer Court surrounded with a palisade, beyond which were the\r\nquarters of the Imperial Guards, and the makeshift lodgings of the\r\nMetropolitan Boards and the officials of the nine Ministries on Palace\r\nduty. The arrangements of the Court, though restricted in the matter\r\nof space, were on much the same lines as in Peking. The main hall of\r\nthe “Travelling Palace” was left empty, the side halls being used as\r\nante-chambers for officials awaiting audience. Behind the main hall was\r\na room to which access was given by a door with six panels, two of which\r\nwere left open, showing the Throne in the centre of the room, upholstered\r\nin yellow silk. It was here that Court ceremonies took place. On the\r\nleft of this room was the apartment where audiences were held daily,\r\nand behind this again were the Empress Dowager’s bedroom and private\r\nsitting-room. The Emperor and his Consort occupied a small apartment\r\ncommunicating with the Old Buddha’s bedroom, and to the west of these\r\nagain were three small rooms, occupied by the Heir Apparent. The chief\r\neunuch occupied the room next to that of the Old Buddha on the east side.\r\nThe general arrangements for the comfort and convenience of the Court\r\nwere necessarily of a makeshift and provisional character and the Privy\r\nPurse was for a time at a low ebb, so that Her Majesty was much exercised\r\nover the receipt and safe custody of the tribute, in money and in kind,\r\nwhich came flowing in from the provinces. So long as the administration\r\nof her household was under the supervision of Governor Ts’en, the\r\nstrictest economy was practised; for instance, the amount allowed by him\r\nfor the upkeep of their Majesties’ table was two hundred taels (about\r\n£25) per day, which, as the Old Buddha remarked on one occasion, was\r\nabout one-tenth of the ordinary expenditure under the same heading at\r\nPeking. “We are living cheaply now,” she said; to which the Governor\r\nreplied, “The amount could still be reduced with advantage.”\r\n\r\nHer Majesty’s custom, in selecting the menus for the day, was to have a\r\nlist of about one hundred dishes brought in every evening by the eunuch\r\non duty. After the privations of the flight from Peking, the liberal\r\nsupply of swallows’ nests and _bêche-de-mer_ which came in from the South\r\nwas very much appreciated, and her rough fare of chickens and eggs gave\r\nway to recherché menus; but the Emperor, as usual, limited himself to\r\na diet of vegetables. She gave orders that no more than half a dozen\r\ndishes should be served at one meal, and she took personal pains with the\r\nsupply of milk, of which she always consumed a considerable quantity. Six\r\ncows were kept in the immediate vicinity of the Imperial apartments, for\r\nthe feeding of which Her Majesty was charged two hundred taels a month.\r\nHer health was good on the whole, but she suffered from indigestion,\r\nwhich she attributed to the change of climate and the fatigues of her\r\njourney. For occasional attacks of insomnia she had recourse to massage,\r\nin which several of the eunuchs were well-skilled. After the Court had\r\nsettled down at Hsi-an fu, Her Majesty was again persuaded to permit\r\nthe presentation of plays, which she seemed generally to enjoy as much\r\nas those in Peking. But her mind was for ever filled with anxiety as\r\nto the progress of the negotiations with the foreign Powers at the\r\nCapital, and all telegrams received were brought to her at once. The\r\nnews of the desecration of her Summer Palace had filled her with wrath\r\nand distress, especially when, in letters from the eunuch Sun (who had\r\nremained in charge at Peking), she learned that her Throne had been\r\nthrown into the lake, and that the soldiers had made “lewd and ribald\r\ndrawings and writings” even on the walls of her bedroom. It was with the\r\ngreatest relief that she heard of the settlement of the terms of peace,\r\nsubsequently recorded in the Protocol of 7th of September, and so soon\r\nas these terms had been irrevocably arranged, she issued a Decree (June,\r\n1901) fixing the date for the Court’s return in September. This Decree,\r\nissued in the name of the Emperor, was as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Our Sacred Mother’s advanced age renders it necessary that we\r\n    should take the greatest care of her health, so that she may\r\n    attain to peaceful longevity; a long journey in the heat being\r\n    evidently undesirable, we have fixed on the 19th day of the 7th\r\n    Moon to commence our return journey, and are now preparing to\r\n    escort Her Majesty, viâ Honan.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most notorious Boxer leaders, namely, Duke Kung, the younger\r\nbrother of Prince Chuang, had accompanied the Court, with his family, to\r\nHsi-an. The Old Buddha, realising that his presence would undoubtedly\r\ncompromise her, now decided to send him away. His family fell from one\r\nstate of misery to another; no assistance was rendered to them by any\r\nofficials on the journey, and eventually, after much wandering, the\r\nDuke was compelled to earn a bare living by serving as a subordinate in\r\na small Yamên, while his wife, who was young and comely, was sold into\r\nslavery. It was clear that the Old Buddha had now realised the error\r\nof her ways and the folly that had been committed in encouraging the\r\nBoxers. After the executions and suicides of the proscribed leaders of\r\nthe movement she was heard on one occasion to remark: “These Princes and\r\nMinisters were wont to bluster and boast, relying upon their near kinship\r\nto ourselves, and we foolishly believed them when they assured us that\r\nthe foreign devils would never get the better of China. In their folly\r\nthey came within an ace of overthrowing our Dynasty. The only one whose\r\nfate I regret is Chao Shu-ch’iao. For him I am truly sorry.”\r\n\r\nThe fate of Prince Chuang’s brother showed clearly that both officials\r\nand people had realised the genuine change in the Empress Dowager’s\r\nfeelings towards the Boxers, for there was none so poor to do him honour.\r\n\r\nBoth on the journey to Hsi-an fu and on the return to the Capital, Her\r\nMajesty displayed the greatest interest in the lives of the peasantry and\r\nthe condition of the people generally. She subscribed liberally to the\r\nfamine fund in Shansi, professing the greatest sympathy for the stricken\r\npeople. She told the Emperor that she had never appreciated their\r\nsufferings in the seclusion of her Palace.\r\n\r\nDuring the Court’s stay at Hsi-an fu the Emperor came to take more\r\ninterest in State affairs than he had done at any time since the _coup\r\nd’état_, but although the Old Buddha discussed matters with him freely,\r\nand took his opinion, he had no real voice in the decision of any\r\nimportant matter. His temper continued to be uncertain and occasionally\r\nviolent, so that many high officials of the Court preferred always to\r\ntake their business to the Empress Dowager. One important appointment was\r\nmade at this time by the Old Buddha at the Emperor’s personal request,\r\nviz., that of Sun Chia-nai (ex-Imperial tutor) to the Grand Secretariat.\r\nThis official had resigned office in January 1900 upon the selection of\r\nthe Heir Apparent, which he regarded as equivalent to the deposition of\r\nthe Emperor.[108] Subsequently, throughout the Boxer troubles, he had\r\nremained in his house at Peking, which was plundered, and he himself\r\nwould undoubtedly have been killed, but for the protection given him by\r\nJung Lu. At this time also, Lu Ch’uan-lin joined the Grand Council. When\r\nthe siege of the Legations began, he had left his post as Governor of\r\nKiangsu, and marched north with some three thousand men to defend Peking\r\nagainst the foreigners. Before he reached the Capital, however, it had\r\nfallen, so that, after disbanding his troops, he went for a few weeks\r\nto his native place in Chihli, and thence proceeded to join the Court\r\nat T’ai-yüan fu, where the Old Buddha received him most cordially. His\r\ncase is particularly interesting in that he was until his death a member\r\nof the Grand Council,[109] and that, like many other high officials at\r\nPeking, his ideas of the art of government and the relative position\r\nof China in the world, remained exactly as they were before the Boxer\r\nmovement. His action in proceeding to Peking with his troops from his\r\npost in the south is also interesting, as showing the semi-independent\r\nposition of provincial officials, and the free hand which any man of\r\nstrong views may claim and enjoy. The Viceroys of Nanking and Wuch’ang\r\nmight dare to oppose the wishes of the Empress Dowager, and to exercise\r\ntheir own judgment as regards declaring war upon foreigners, but it was\r\nequally open to any of their subordinates to differ from them, and to\r\ntake such steps as they might personally consider proper, even to the\r\nmovement of troops.\r\n\r\nAn official, one of the many provincial deputies charged with the\r\ncarrying of tribute to the Court at Hsi-an, returning thence to his\r\npost at Soochow, sent to a friend at Peking a detailed description of\r\nthe life of the Court in exile, from which the following extracts are\r\ntaken. The document, being at that time confidential and not intended\r\nfor publication, throws some light on the Court and its doings which is\r\nlacking in official documents:—\r\n\r\n    “The Empress Dowager is still in sole charge of affairs, and\r\n    controls everything in and around the Court; those who exercise\r\n    the most influence with her are Jung Lu and Lu Ch’uan-lin.\r\n    Governor Ts’en, has fallen into disfavour of late. His\r\n    Majesty’s advisers are most anxious that she should return to\r\n    Peking. She looks very young and well; one would not put her\r\n    age at more than forty, whereas she is really sixty-four. The\r\n    Emperor appears to be generally depressed, but he has been\r\n    putting on flesh lately. The Heir Apparent is fifteen years\r\n    of age; fat, coarse-featured, and of rude manners. He favours\r\n    military habits of deportment and dress, and to see him when\r\n    he goes to the play, wearing a felt cap with gold braid, a\r\n    leather jerkin, and a red military overcoat, one would take him\r\n    for a prize-fighter. He knows all the young actors and rowdies,\r\n    and associates generally with the very lowest classes. He is\r\n    a good rider, however, and a very fair musician. If, at the\r\n    play-houses, the music goes wrong, he will frequently get up\r\n    in his place and rebuke the performer, and at times he even\r\n    jumps on to the stage, possesses himself of the instrument, and\r\n    plays the piece himself. All this brings the boy into disrepute\r\n    with respectable people, and some of his pranks have come to\r\n    the ears of the Old Buddha, who they say has had him severely\r\n    whipped. His last offence was to commence an intrigue with one\r\n    of the ladies-in-waiting on Her Majesty, for which he got into\r\n    serious trouble. He is much in the company of Li Lien-ying (the\r\n    chief eunuch), who leads him into the wildest dissipation.[110]\r\n    My friend Kao, speaking of him the other day, wittily said,\r\n    that ‘from being an expectant Emperor, he would soon become\r\n    a deposed Heir Apparent’; which is quite true, for he never\r\n    reads, all his tastes are vicious, and his manners rude and\r\n    overbearing. To give you an instance of his doings: on the 18th\r\n    of the 10th Moon, accompanied by his brother and by his uncle,\r\n    the Boxer Duke Lan, and followed by a crowd of eunuchs, he got\r\n    mixed up in a fight with some Kansu braves at a theatre in the\r\n    temple of the City God. The eunuchs got the worst of it, and\r\n    some minor officials who were in the audience were mauled by\r\n    the crowd. The trouble arose, in the first instance, because of\r\n    the eunuchs attempting to claim the best seats in the house,\r\n    and the sequel shows to what lengths of villainy these fellows\r\n    will descend, and how great is their influence with the highest\r\n    officials. The eunuchs were afraid to seek revenge on the Kansu\r\n    troops direct, but they attained their end by denouncing the\r\n    manager of the theatre to Governor Ts’en, and by inducing him\r\n    to close every theatre in Hsi-an. Besides which, the theatre\r\n    manager was put in a wooden collar, and thus ignominiously\r\n    paraded through the streets of the city. The Governor was\r\n    induced to take this action on the ground that Her Majesty,\r\n    sore distressed at the famine in Shansi and the calamities\r\n    which have overtaken China, was offended at these exhibitions\r\n    of unseemly gaiety; and the proclamation which closed the\r\n    play-houses, ordered also that restaurants and other places of\r\n    public entertainment should suspend business. Everybody in the\r\n    city knew that this was the work of the eunuchs. Eventually Chi\r\n    Lu, Chamberlain of the Household, was able to induce the chief\r\n    eunuch to ask the Old Buddha to give orders that the theatres\r\n    be reopened. This was accordingly done, but of course the real\r\n    reason was not given, and the Proclamation stated that, since\r\n    the recent fall of snow justified hopes of a prosperous year\r\n    and good harvests, as a mark of the people’s gratitude to\r\n    Providence, the theatres would be reopened as usual, ‘but no\r\n    more disturbances must occur.’\r\n\r\n    “The chief eunuch does not seem to be abusing his authority as\r\n    much as usual at Hsi-an, most of his time and attention being\r\n    given to the collection and safe keeping of tribute. If the\r\n    quality and quantity received is not up to his expectations, he\r\n    will decline to accept it, and thus infinite trouble is caused\r\n    to the officials of the province concerned.\r\n\r\n    “A few days before the Old Buddha’s sixty-fifth birthday in\r\n    the 10th Moon, Governor Ts’en proposed that the city should\r\n    be decorated, and the usual costly gifts should be presented\r\n    to Her Majesty, but to this proposal Prince P’u Tung took the\r\n    strongest exception; ‘China is in desperate straits,’ he said,\r\n    ‘and even the ancestral shrines and birthplaces of the Dynasty\r\n    are in the hands of foreign troops. How then could the Old\r\n    Buddha possibly desire to celebrate her birthday? The thing is\r\n    impossible.’ The matter was therefore allowed to drop. But the\r\n    Governor is certainly most anxious to make a name for himself,\r\n    and, in spite of his blustering professions of an independent\r\n    attitude, he does not disdain to curry favour with the chief\r\n    eunuch and others who can serve him. They say that he has\r\n    recently sworn ‘blood brotherhood’ with Hsin, the eunuch whose\r\n    duty it is to announce officials at audiences. No doubt it is\r\n    due to this distinguished connection that he has recently been\r\n    raised to the rank of a Board President, and therefore entitled\r\n    to ride in a sedan chair within the precincts of the Court,\r\n    which, no doubt, he considers more dignified than riding in a\r\n    cart.[111]\r\n\r\n    “Tung Fu-hsiang has returned to his home in Kansu, but his\r\n    troops remain still at Hsi-an under the command of General\r\n    Teng, who so greatly distinguished himself in the Mahomedan\r\n    rebellion.\r\n\r\n    “It would seem that the Old Buddha still cherishes hopes of\r\n    defeating the foreigners, for she is particularly delighted by\r\n    a Memorial which has been sent in lately by Hsia Chen-wu, in\r\n    which he recommends a certain aboriginal tribesman (‘Man-tzu’)\r\n    as a man of remarkable strategic ability. He offers to lose his\r\n    own head and those of all his family, should this Heaven-sent\r\n    warrior fail to defeat all the troops of the Allies in one\r\n    final engagement, and he begs that the Emperor may permit this\r\n    man to display his powers and thus save the Empire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nHOW THE BOXER LEADERS DIED\r\n\r\n\r\nChina’s officials may be said to be a class of individualists, incapable,\r\nas a rule, of collective heroism or any sustained effort of organised\r\npatriotism; but it is one of the remarkable features and results of her\r\nsystem of philosophy that the mandarins, even those who have been known\r\npublicly to display physical cowardice at critical moments, will usually\r\naccept sentence of death at the hands of their Sovereign with perfect\r\nequanimity, and meet it with calm philosophic resignation. The manner in\r\nwhich the Boxer leaders died, who were proscribed in the course of the\r\nnegotiations for the peace Protocol at Peking, affords an interesting\r\nillustration of this fact; incidentally it throws light also on a trait\r\nin the Chinese character, which to some extent explains the solidity and\r\npermanence of its system of government, based as it is on the principle\r\nof absolute obedience and loyalty to the head of the State as one of the\r\ncardinal Confucian virtues.\r\n\r\nDespite the repeated and unswerving demands of the foreign Powers\r\nthat the death penalty should be inflicted upon the chief leaders\r\nand supporters of the Boxers, the Empress Dowager was naturally loth\r\nto yield, inasmuch as she herself had been in full sympathy with the\r\nmovement. It was only after many and prolonged meetings with her chief\r\nadvisers, and when she realised that in this course lay her only hope\r\nof obtaining satisfactory terms of peace, that she finally and most\r\nreluctantly consented, in February 1901, to the issue of a Decree\r\n(drafted by Jung Lu) in which she abandoned to their fate those who,\r\nwith her full knowledge and approval, had led the rising which was to\r\ndrive all foreigners into the sea. With the knowledge in our possession\r\nas to Her Majesty’s complicity, and in some cases her initiative, in\r\nthe anti-foreign movement, it is impossible to read this Decree without\r\nrealising something of the ruthlessness of the woman and her cynical\r\ndisregard of everything except her own safety and authority. Even so,\r\nhowever, Tzŭ Hsi could not bring herself at first to comply with all\r\nthe demands of the Powers, evidently hoping by compromise and further\r\nnegotiations to save the lives of her favourites, Prince Tuan, Duke Lan\r\nand Chao Shu-ch’iao. The Decree, issued in the Emperor’s name, was as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    “In the summer of last year, the Boxer Rebellion arose, which\r\n    brought in its train hostilities with friendly Powers. Prince\r\n    Ch’ing and Li Hung-chang have now definitely settled the\r\n    preliminary conditions of the Peace Protocol. Reflecting on the\r\n    causes of this disaster, we cannot escape the conclusion that\r\n    it was due to the ignorance and arrogance of certain of our\r\n    Princes and Ministers of State who, foolishly believing in the\r\n    alleged supernatural power of the Boxers, were led to disobey\r\n    the Throne and to disregard our express commands that these\r\n    rebels should be exterminated. Not only did they not do this,\r\n    but they encouraged and assisted them to such an extent that\r\n    the movement gained hosts of followers. The latter committed\r\n    acts of unprovoked hostility, so that matters reached a pass\r\n    where a general cataclysm became inevitable. It was by reason\r\n    of the folly of these men that General Tung, that obstinate\r\n    braggart, dared to bombard the Legations, thus bringing our\r\n    Dynasty to the brink of the greatest peril, throwing the State\r\n    into a general convulsion of disorder, and plunging our people\r\n    into uttermost misery. The dangers which have been incurred\r\n    by Her Majesty the Empress Dowager, and myself are simply\r\n    indescribable, and our hearts are sore, aching with unappeased\r\n    wrath at the remembrance of our sufferings. Let those who\r\n    brought about these calamities ask themselves what punishment\r\n    can suffice to atone for them?\r\n\r\n    “Our former Decrees on this subject have been far too lenient,\r\n    and we must therefore now award further punishments to the\r\n    guilty. Prince Chuang, already cashiered, led the Boxers in\r\n    their attack upon the French Cathedral and the Legations,\r\n    besides which, it was he who issued a Proclamation in violation\r\n    of all our Treaties. (This refers to the rewards offered\r\n    for the heads of foreigners.) He too it was who, acting as\r\n    the leader of the savage Boxers, put to death many innocent\r\n    persons. As a mark of clemency unmerited by these crimes, we\r\n    grant him permission to commit suicide, and hereby order that\r\n    Ko Pao-hua shall supervise the execution of these our commands.\r\n\r\n    “Prince Tuan, already cashiered, was the leader and spokesman\r\n    of the Imperial Clan, to whom was due the declaration of war\r\n    against foreigners; he trusted implicitly in Boxer magic, and\r\n    thus inexcusably brought about hostilities. Duke Lan, who\r\n    assisted Prince Chuang in drawing up the proclamation which set\r\n    a price on the head of every foreigner, deserves also that he\r\n    be stripped of all his dignities and titles. But remembering\r\n    that both these Princes are our near kinsmen, we mitigate\r\n    their sentence to exile to Turkestan, where they will be kept\r\n    in perpetual confinement. The Governor of Shensi, Yü Hsien,\r\n    already cashiered, believed in the Boxers at the time when he\r\n    held the Governorship of Shantung; when he subsequently came\r\n    to Peking, he sang their praises at our Court, with the result\r\n    that many Princes and Ministers were led astray by his words.\r\n    As Governor of Shansi he had put to death many missionaries and\r\n    native converts, proving himself to be an utterly misguided and\r\n    bloodthirsty man. He was undoubtedly one of the prime causes\r\n    of all our troubles. We have already decreed his banishment\r\n    to Turkestan, and by this time he should already have reached\r\n    Kansu. Orders are now to be transmitted for his immediate\r\n    decapitation, which will be superintended by the Provincial\r\n    Treasurer.\r\n\r\n    “As to the late Grand Secretary, Kang Yi, he also believed in\r\n    the Boxers, and went so far as to set a price on the lives\r\n    of foreigners so that, had he lived, he too would have been\r\n    sentenced to death, but as matters stand, we order that he be\r\n    posthumously deprived of his rank and summarily cashiered.\r\n\r\n    “We have already cashiered Tung Fu-hsiang. While permitted to\r\n    retain his rank as a military official, he cannot escape a\r\n    certain share of responsibility for the siege of the Legations,\r\n    although his orders emanated from Princes and Ministers of\r\n    State; and because of his ignorance of foreign affairs, slack\r\n    discipline, and general stupidity, he certainly deserves severe\r\n    punishment. But we cannot overlook the services he has rendered\r\n    in the Kansu rebellion, and the good name which he bears\r\n    amongst our Chinese and Mahomedan subjects in that province, so\r\n    that, as a mark of our favour and leniency, we merely remove\r\n    him from his post.[112]\r\n\r\n    “Ying Nien, Vice-President of the Censorate, was opposed\r\n    to the issue of the proclamation which offered rewards for\r\n    foreigners’ heads, and for this he deserves lenient treatment,\r\n    but he failed to insist strongly in his objections, and we are\r\n    therefore compelled to punish him. He is hereby sentenced to be\r\n    cashiered and imprisoned pending decapitation.[113]\r\n\r\n    “As regards the Grand Councillor Chao Shu-ch’iao, he had never,\r\n    to our knowledge, shown any hostility to foreigners, and when\r\n    we despatched him on a special mission to confer with the\r\n    Boxers, the report which he submitted on his return showed no\r\n    signs of sympathy with their proceedings.[114] Nevertheless,\r\n    he was undoubtedly careless, and we therefore, acting in\r\n    leniency, decree that he be cashiered and imprisoned pending\r\n    decapitation.[115]\r\n\r\n    “The Grand Secretary Hsü T’ung and Li Ping-heng, our Assistant\r\n    Commander-in-Chief, have both committed suicide, but as their\r\n    behaviour has been very severely criticised, we order that they\r\n    be deprived of their ranks; and all posthumous honours granted\r\n    to them are hereby cancelled.\r\n\r\n    “The Ministers of the friendly Powers can no longer fail to\r\n    recognise that the Boxer Rebellion was indeed the work of these\r\n    guilty officials, and that it was in no way due to any action\r\n    or wishes on the part of the Throne. In the punishment of these\r\n    offenders we have displayed no leniency, from which all our\r\n    subjects may learn how grave has been the recent crisis.”\r\n\r\nAs the terms of this Decree still failed to satisfy the foreign\r\nMinisters, especially as regards the sentences passed on Prince Tuan and\r\nDuke Lan, another Decree, a week later, ordered that both these Manchu\r\nleaders should be imprisoned pending decapitation, a sentence which\r\nwas eventually reduced to one of perpetual banishment to Turkestan.\r\nPosthumous decapitation, a grievous disgrace in the eyes of Chinese\r\nofficials, was decreed as a further punishment upon Kang Yi, while Chao\r\nShu-ch’iao and Ying Nien were ordered to commit suicide. Finally, the\r\nGrand Councillor Ch’i Hsiu, and a son of the Grand Secretary Hsü T’ung\r\n(who had closely followed in his father’s footsteps as the most violent\r\nopponent of everything foreign), were sentenced to decapitation, and were\r\nduly executed at Peking.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the last demands of the Foreign Ministers, a final\r\nDecree, the wording of which points clearly to reluctant action under\r\ncompulsion, restored the ranks and honours of the five officials who had\r\nbeen executed for advising Her Majesty against the Boxers. To revise\r\nthis sentence without leaving them under some imputation of blame would\r\nhave involved most undesirable loss of “face,” and the Decree therefore\r\nobserves:—\r\n\r\n    “When we urged these officials, at a general audience of all\r\n    our Ministers, to state their views definitely, so that we\r\n    might judge fairly of the issues, they expressed themselves\r\n    hesitatingly, and our evil-disposed Princes and advisers were\r\n    thus able to take advantage of their apparent indecision.\r\n    This was the cause of their undoing. They were impeached on\r\n    all sides, and were eventually decapitated. We recall to mind\r\n    the fact that these five officials always showed considerable\r\n    ability in handling diplomatic questions, and, as a mark of our\r\n    favour, we therefore restore to them their original rank.”\r\n\r\n_The Death of Chao Shu-ch’iao._—This Grand Councillor, one of the\r\nEmpress’s favourite Ministers, whom to the last she endeavoured to\r\nprotect from execution, was originally sentenced only to imprisonment for\r\nlife. He was confined in the prison of the Provincial Judge at Hsi-an,\r\nwhere his family were allowed to visit him. On the day before the issue\r\nof the Decree which sentenced him to imprisonment, the Old Buddha had\r\nsaid, at a meeting of the Grand Council, “I do not really believe that\r\nChao sympathised in the very least with the Boxers; the error that he\r\nmade lay in under-estimating the seriousness of the movement.” This was\r\nreported to Chao, who was naturally much elated, and believed that his\r\nlife would surely be spared. A few days later, however, it was freely\r\nrumoured that the foreign Powers were insisting upon his decapitation,\r\nand the news created the greatest excitement throughout the city, which\r\nwas his native place. Some three hundred of the chief men of the city\r\nhaving drawn up a monster petition, proceeded with it to the office\r\nof the Grand Council, and begged, in the name of the whole community,\r\nthat his life be spared. The Grand Councillors were afraid to take the\r\npetition to Her Majesty, but, in reply to the deputation, the President\r\nof the Board of Punishments (who was related to Chao) declared that his\r\nexecution would be an act of monstrous injustice.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the New Year, these rumours took more definite shape,\r\nand on that day Her Majesty’s audience with the Grand Council lasted\r\nfrom six to eleven in the morning; but even then no decision had been\r\ncome to in regard to complying with the demand for Chao’s execution.\r\nThroughout the neighbourhood of the Drum Tower the streets were packed\r\nwith a huge crowd, who threatened that they would certainly rescue Chao\r\nif he were taken out for execution. So great was the clamour that the\r\nGrand Council feared a riot, and they determined, therefore, to beg Her\r\nMajesty to permit Chao to commit suicide. This was done, and Tzŭ Hsi\r\nreluctantly agreeing, issued the Decree at one o’clock on the following\r\nmorning, which fixed the hour for reporting his death to Her Majesty at\r\nfive o’clock in the afternoon of the same day. Governor Ts’en was ordered\r\nto proceed to the prison, and read the Decree to Chao, which he did in\r\ndue form. After hearing it in silence to the end, Chao asked: “Will\r\nthere be no further Decree?” “No,” said Ts’en. “Surely, there must be,”\r\nsaid Chao. At this his wife, intervening, said, “There is no hope; let\r\nus die together!” She then gave him poison, of which he took a little,\r\nbut up till 3 P.M. it appeared to have had no effect whatsoever, for he\r\nseemed most vigorous, and discussed at great length with his family the\r\narrangements to be made for his funeral. He was much exercised in mind\r\nat the effect which his death would have upon the health of his aged\r\nmother. All day long his room was crowded by friends and colleagues;\r\nthe Governor had endeavoured at first to prevent their coming, but had\r\neventually yielded, so that the number of those present was very large.\r\nChao, addressing them, said: “I have been brought to this pass entirely\r\nby the fault of Kang Yi.” The Governor, observing that his voice sounded\r\nclear and firm, and that, at this hour, there were no signs of impending\r\ndeath about him, ordered one of the attendants to give him some opium\r\nto swallow. At 5 o’clock, the opium having apparently taken no effect,\r\nthe attendants were ordered to give him a liberal dose of arsenic, after\r\nwhich he rolled over on to the ground, and lay there, groaning and\r\nbeating his breast with his hands. Later, complaining of extreme pain,\r\nhe asked that friction might be applied to his chest, but so strong was\r\nhis constitution, and so determined his will, that even at 11 o’clock\r\nit was evident that there was still no little life left in him. The\r\nGovernor was much disturbed and distressed, being well aware that the Old\r\nBuddha would require some adequate explanation of this long delay in the\r\nexecution of her orders. “I was to report his death at 5 o’clock,” said\r\nhe, “the man will not die: what is to be done?” The attendants suggested\r\nthat he should screw up some pieces of thick paper, dip them in strong\r\nspirit, and with them close the breathing passages; by this means he\r\nwould be speedily suffocated. Ts’en approved of the suggestion, and after\r\nfive wads of paper had been inserted, death ensued. His wife, weeping\r\nbitterly, thereupon committed suicide. To the end, Chao could not believe\r\nthat the Empress Dowager would allow his death, and for this reason it is\r\nprobable that he purposely took an insufficient dose of opium in order to\r\ngain time for a reprieve.\r\n\r\n_The Death of Prince Chuang._—Prince Chuang, with his concubine and\r\nson, went to Tu Chou, in South Shansi, there to await the decision of\r\nthe Empress Dowager as to his fate. He lodged in an official house of\r\nentertainment. When Ko Pao-hua, the Imperial Commissioner, brought\r\nthither the Decree commanding him to commit suicide, it was early in\r\nthe morning; nevertheless, upon his arrival, crackers were fired, in\r\naccordance with etiquette, to greet him. The noise greatly irritated\r\nPrince Chuang, who turned savagely upon the attendants, and asked\r\nwhat they meant by making such a noise at such an hour. “An Imperial\r\nCommissioner has arrived,” they said. “Has he come about me?” asked the\r\nPrince. “No,” they replied, “he is merely passing through on business.”\r\nWhen the Imperial Commissioner was ushered in, the Prince began to ply\r\nhim with questions about the Court, to which Ko briefly replied. After\r\ntalking for a little while Ko went off to inspect the premises, at the\r\nback of which he found an old temple, in which he selected an unoccupied\r\nroom to be the scene of Prince Chuang’s suicide. From a beam in the roof\r\nhe hung a silken cord, and, after fastening it securely, he directed\r\nthe Prefect and the District Magistrate to send some soldiers to keep\r\norder. Having made these preparations he returned to the presence of\r\nthe Prince, and informing him that he had an Imperial Decree to read to\r\nhim, ordered him to go down on his knees to hear it. The Prince, drawing\r\nhimself up to his full height, said, “Is it my head that you want?” The\r\nImperial Commissioner made no direct reply, but proceeded to read the\r\nDecree to the Prince, who reverently knelt.[116] When the Commissioner\r\nhad finished, “So it is suicide,” said the Prince, “I always expected\r\nthey would not be content with anything less than my life. I greatly\r\nfear that even our Old Buddha will not be allowed to last much longer.”\r\nHe next asked the Imperial Commissioner to be permitted to bid farewell\r\nto his family, which was allowed him. At this moment, his concubine\r\nand his son, having learned of the Imperial Commissioner’s business,\r\nentered the room. The Prince, addressing his son, said:—“Remember that\r\nit is your duty to do everything in your power for your country; at all\r\ncosts, these foreigners must not be allowed to possess themselves of the\r\nglorious Empire won for us by our ancestors.”[117] His son, bitterly\r\nweeping, could not reply, while his concubine passed from frantic grief\r\nto a swoon. The Prince, unmoved, asked:—“Where is the death chamber?”\r\nThe Imperial Commissioner replied:—“Will your Highness please to come\r\nto the empty room at the back of the house.” When the Prince, following\r\nhim, saw the silken cord hanging from the beam, he turned and said:—“Your\r\nExcellency has indeed made most admirable and complete arrangements.”\r\nWith these words he passed the cord around his neck, and in a very few\r\nminutes life was extinct.\r\n\r\n_The Death of Ying Nien._—Ying Nien was an arrant coward. On the day of\r\nthe issue of the first Decree, ordering his imprisonment at Hsi-an, his\r\nfamily deserted him, and he remained all through the night, weeping, in\r\ngreat distress of mind. To his attendants he complained bitterly that\r\nPrince Ch’ing had not intervened to protect him. The next day was the\r\nNew Year Festival, and as everybody was busy with preparations for the\r\noccasion, little heed was paid to him, and he spent the day weeping.\r\nTowards midnight his crying suddenly ceased, and on the following morning\r\nhe was found by his servant, prone upon the ground, his face covered\r\nwith mud, quite dead. He had choked himself by swallowing mud, but as\r\nthe Decree ordering him to commit suicide had not actually been issued,\r\nthe fact of his death was suppressed for forty-eight hours, after which\r\nGovernor Ts’en was informed, and he reported it to the Old Buddha.\r\n\r\n_The Decapitation of Yü Hsien._—When the Decree, commanding his\r\ndecapitation, reached Yü Hsien, he had already started under escort for\r\nhis place of banishment, but he was a sick man and could only totter\r\nweakly along. On learning the news, he appeared as one dazed, a very\r\ndifferent man indeed from that fierce Governor of Shansi, who had\r\ndisplayed such bloodthirsty activity. On the day before his death he\r\nwas very seriously ill, and when the time came, he was so weak that he\r\nhad to be supported to the execution ground. On the previous day the\r\nleading citizens of Lan-chou fu expressed their desire to offer him a\r\nvaledictory banquet, but he declined the honour with thanks, expressing\r\nhis wish to spend his last day in quietude. He wrote a pair of scrolls as\r\nan expression of his gratitude for the courtesy thus shown to him, and\r\nthe elders of the city decided and informed him that the execution ground\r\nwould be decorated with red cloth, as for a festival, in his honour.\r\nTowards evening, notices were placarded in the principal streets, calling\r\non the people to insist upon his being reprieved, but Yü Hsien knew that\r\nthis was quite useless. He composed a statement of his actions in the\r\nform of an official proclamation, maintaining stoutly that his death was\r\nto be regarded as a glorious and patriotic end, and bidding the people\r\non no account to interfere with the execution of his sentence. Finally\r\nhe wrote, with his own hand, a pair of valedictory scrolls, the text of\r\nwhich was widely quoted after his death all over China. The first may be\r\ntranslated as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The Minister dies for his Sovereign; wives and concubines die\r\n    for their lord. Who shall say that this is unseemly? It is\r\n    sad that my aged mother is ninety years of age, and my little\r\n    daughter only seven. Who shall protect them in their old age\r\n    and tender youth? How shall that filial piety be fulfilled\r\n    which a man owes to his parent? The Sovereign commanded, and\r\n    the Minister obeyed. I slew others; now, in my turn, am I\r\n    slain. Why should I regret it? Only one cause for shame have\r\n    I—that I have served my Sovereign all these years, and have\r\n    held high rank in three provinces, without displaying merit\r\n    more conspicuous than a grain of sand in the desert or a drop\r\n    of water in the ocean. Alas, that I should thus unworthily\r\n    requite the Imperial bounty.”\r\n\r\nAnd the second reads:—\r\n\r\n    “The Minister has by his guilt incurred the sentence of\r\n    decapitation. At this moment there is no thought in my mind\r\n    except the hope that my death may be as glorious as my life has\r\n    been honest.[118] I would far rather die than pine away the\r\n    rest of my life in degrading imprisonment. I have ill-requited\r\n    Her Majesty’s kindness. Who shall now relieve her grief? I\r\n    sincerely hope that you, the Statesmen who surround the Throne,\r\n    may yet find means to restore our fallen fortunes, and that you\r\n    will honourably fulfil your bounden duty in ministering to the\r\n    distress of their Imperial Majesties.”\r\n\r\nOn the following day, at one o’clock of the afternoon, Yü Hsien’s head\r\nwas severed from his body, in the presence of a great crowd, which\r\ngreeted his end with sounds of lamentation.\r\n\r\n_The Death of Ch’i Hsiu._—Ch’i Hsin was executed, together with Hsü\r\nChing-yu, outside the wall of the Tartar city, in Peking, early one\r\nmorning in February, 1901, the execution being witnessed by more than one\r\nEuropean. When informed that he was to die, Ch’i Hsiu’s only question\r\nwas: “By whose commands?” and when told that a Decree had come from\r\nHsi-an fu, he said, “It is by the will of the Empress Dowager; I die\r\nhappy then, so long as it is not by order of the foreigners.” This Grand\r\nCouncillor had been arrested several months before by the Japanese, and\r\nPrince Ch’ing had been able to obtain his release on the ground that his\r\naged mother was very ill; but when she subsequently died, he strongly\r\nadvised Ch’i Hsiu “to make his filial piety coincide with his loyalty by\r\ncommitting suicide.” Coming from Prince Ch’ing, the suggestion was one\r\nhardly to be misunderstood, but Ch’i Hsiu failed to act upon it, thereby\r\nincurring a certain amount of criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTHE OLD BUDDHA PENITENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the wrath of the Powers had been appeased by the death and\r\nbanishment of the leading Boxers, and when the Empress Dowager had come\r\nto realise that her future policy must be one of conciliation and reform,\r\nshe proceeded first of all to adjust the annals of her reign for the\r\nbenefit of posterity, in the following remarkable Edict (13th February,\r\n1901):—\r\n\r\n    “In the summer of last year, the Boxers, after bringing about\r\n    a state of war, took possession of our Capital and dominated\r\n    the very Throne itself. The Decrees issued at that time were\r\n    the work of wicked Princes and Ministers of State, who, taking\r\n    advantage of the chaotic condition of affairs, did not hesitate\r\n    to issue documents under the Imperial seal, which were quite\r\n    contrary to our wishes. We have on more than one previous\r\n    occasion hinted indirectly at the extraordinary difficulty of\r\n    the position in which we were placed, and which left us no\r\n    alternative but to act as we did. Our officials and subjects\r\n    should have no difficulty in reading between the lines and\r\n    appreciating our meaning.\r\n\r\n    “We have now punished all the guilty, and we hereby order that\r\n    the Grand Secretariat shall submit for our perusal all Decrees\r\n    issued between the 24th day of the 5th moon and the 20th day of\r\n    the 7th moon (20th June to 14th August), so that all spurious\r\n    or illegal documents may be withdrawn and cancelled. Thus shall\r\n    historical accuracy be attained and our Imperial utterances\r\n    receive the respect to which they are properly entitled.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus secured the respect of posterity, Tzŭ Hsi proceeded to make\r\nthe “amende honorable,” (with due regard to the Imperial “face,”) for so\r\nmany of her sins as she was prepared to admit. In another Decree, in the\r\nname of the Emperor, which gives a Munchausen account of the Throne’s\r\npart and lot in the crisis of 1900, and a pathetic description of her\r\nown and the Emperor’s sufferings during the flight, she makes solemn\r\nconfession of error and promise of reform. As an example of the manner in\r\nwhich history is made in China, the Edict is of permanent interest and\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n    “A PENITENTIAL DECREE\r\n\r\n    “_26th day, 12th moon of Kuang-Hsü’s 26th year_ (_Feb. 13th,\r\n    1901_).\r\n\r\n    “Last summer the Boxers sowed the seeds of rebellion, which\r\n    led to our being involved in a war with friendly Powers.\r\n    Thereafter, our Capital being thrown into a state of great\r\n    disorder, we escorted the Empress Dowager, our mother, on a\r\n    progress of inspection throughout the Western Provinces. To\r\n    Prince Ch’ing and to the Grand Secretary Li Hung-chang we\r\n    entrusted full powers, and bade them negotiate with the foreign\r\n    Ministers for the cessation of hostilities and a Treaty of\r\n    peace. These Plenipotentiaries having lately telegraphed to us\r\n    the twelve principal clauses of the proposed protocol, we have\r\n    consented thereto, but at the same time have instructed them\r\n    carefully to scrutinise their various provisions in the light\r\n    of China’s ability to fulfil them.\r\n\r\n    “It having been accorded to us to retrieve our disastrous\r\n    mistakes, we are in duty bound to promulgate this Penitential\r\n    Decree, and to let every one of our subjects know how vast and\r\n    harassing were the perplexities with which the Throne has been\r\n    beset.\r\n\r\n    “There are ignorant persons who believe that the recent crisis\r\n    was partly caused by our government’s support of the Boxers;\r\n    they must have overlooked our reiterated Decrees of the 5th and\r\n    6th moons, that the Boxers should be exterminated, and the\r\n    Christians protected. Unfortunately these rebels and their evil\r\n    associates placed us in a position from which it was impossible\r\n    to escape; we exhausted every possible effort of strong\r\n    remonstrance, appalled at the impending ruin of our Empire.\r\n    Events moved swiftly until, on the 21st of the 7th moon, our\r\n    Capital fell; on that day, both Her Majesty the Empress Dowager\r\n    and ourselves decided to commit suicide in the presence of the\r\n    tutelary deities of our Dynasty and the gods of the soil, thus\r\n    making atonement and offering propitiation to the spirits of\r\n    our nine Imperial ancestors. But, at the critical moment of\r\n    dire lamentation and confusion, we were seized by our Princes\r\n    and Ministers, and forcibly led away from that place where\r\n    bullets fell like rain, and where the enemies’ guns gathered\r\n    thick as forest trees. Hastily, and with souls perturbed, we\r\n    started on our Western tour. Were not all these disasters\r\n    caused by the Boxers? The imminent danger of her sacred\r\n    Majesty, the overwhelming ruin of our ancestors’ inheritance,\r\n    our prosperous Capital turned to a howling wilderness, its\r\n    ravines filled with the dead bodies of our greatest men: how\r\n    can it possibly be said that the Throne could protect the\r\n    rebels who brought such disasters upon us?\r\n\r\n    “There was, however, an explicable cause for the Boxer movement\r\n    and for its disastrous results.” (_The Decree proceeds here\r\n    to ascribe blame to local Magistrates for not administering\r\n    even justice between Christians and non-Christians, and thus\r\n    producing a state of discontent and unrest, which afforded\r\n    opportunities to the Boxers. The latter received a further\r\n    impetus by reason of the inefficiency of the Imperial troops\r\n    sent to quell the first rising. Finally, references are made to\r\n    the evil advice and ignorance of the highly placed clansmen and\r\n    Ministers of State who favoured the Boxer cause. This Decree\r\n    is in fact a complete justification of the views expressed in\r\n    the three memorials by Yüan Ch’ang and Hsü Ching-ch’eng, for\r\n    which these patriotic officials laid down their lives. After\r\n    describing the entry of the Boxers into Peking, and lamenting\r\n    the position of the Throne as resembling “a tail which is too\r\n    big to wag,” the Decree proceeds_):—“Nevertheless, and while\r\n    the Legations were being besieged, we repeatedly directed our\r\n    Ministers of the Tsungli Yamên to put a stop to hostilities,\r\n    and at the same time to keep up communication with the foreign\r\n    Ministers, assuring them of our kindly and sympathetic regard.\r\n    This latter order, however, was not carried out because of\r\n    the continuous artillery and rifle fire between the besiegers\r\n    and the besieged, and it was impossible for us, under such\r\n    conditions, to insist upon its execution. Supposing, by some\r\n    horrible fatality, the Legations had actually fallen, how\r\n    could China have hoped to preserve her integrity? To the\r\n    Throne’s strenuous efforts is really due the avoidance of\r\n    such a dreadful catastrophe, and the gifts of wine, fruit and\r\n    water-melons to the besieged Legations, were an indication\r\n    of Her Majesty’s benevolent intentions. It was but natural\r\n    and right that the friendly Powers should appreciate these\r\n    our feelings, and the fact that at such a crisis they have\r\n    respected the integrity of our Empire as a Sovereign State,\r\n    goes to prove that the Allies attribute no longer any blame\r\n    to the Throne. This, however, only adds to our wrath at the\r\n    ignorance and violence of our offending subjects; when we look\r\n    back upon the past, we are filled with shame and indignation.\r\n    We are convinced that, in these peace negotiations, the\r\n    foreign Powers will not attempt to extract from us more than\r\n    we are able to concede. We have ordered Prince Ch’ing and Li\r\n    Hung-chang, negotiating this Treaty, to continue patiently\r\n    in friendly discussion, maintaining all questions of vital\r\n    principle, while recognising the special circumstances which\r\n    attach to any given case. Foreign Powers are lovers of justice,\r\n    and they are bound to consider what China is capable of doing\r\n    if they wish to see this negotiation brought to a successful\r\n    conclusion. To this end we expect that our Plenipotentiaries\r\n    will display their virtue of patriotism to the very best of\r\n    their ability.\r\n\r\n    “At the time of the terror in Peking, our provincial\r\n    authorities were ordered to keep the peace in their respective\r\n    provinces, and to take no part in provoking hostilities.\r\n    If the Southern and Eastern parts of our Empire enjoyed\r\n    full protection from disorders, the fact was solely due to\r\n    our Decrees, which insisted upon the rigid maintenance of\r\n    peace. The trade of foreign Powers was in no way injured,\r\n    our Viceroys and Governors being able to preserve normal\r\n    conditions in those parts of our Empire. As regards the\r\n    Southern provinces, however, which are always talking loudly of\r\n    strengthening their defences, it cannot be gainsaid that, upon\r\n    the outbreak of any trouble, they fall into a state of hopeless\r\n    confusion. Caring nothing for the innumerable difficulties\r\n    which beset our Throne, they stand idly by, contenting\r\n    themselves with delivering oracular opinions and catch-words,\r\n    and they even go so far as to reproach their Sovereign, the\r\n    father of his people. We would have them bear in mind that\r\n    when our Imperial chariot departed in haste from the Forbidden\r\n    City, the moaning of the wind and the cry of the heron overhead\r\n    seemed to our startled ears as the tramp of an advancing enemy.\r\n    As we fled through Ch’ang-ping chou northward to Hsüan-hua,\r\n    we personally attended on the wants of the Empress Dowager.\r\n    We were both clad in the meanest of garments, and to relieve\r\n    our hunger we were scarcely able to obtain a dish of beans or\r\n    porridge. Few of our poorest subjects have suffered greater\r\n    hardships of cold and hunger than befell us in this pitiful\r\n    plight. We wonder whether those who call themselves our\r\n    faithful Ministers and servants have ever taken real thought\r\n    of their bounden duty towards their afflicted and outraged\r\n    Sovereigns?\r\n\r\n    “To sum up the matter in a word, is it not the case that, when\r\n    either our Statesmen or our people are guilty of any offence,\r\n    it is upon our Imperial persons that the blame must fall?\r\n    In recalling this fact to mind, we do not desire to rake up\r\n    bygone offences, but rather because it is our duty to warn our\r\n    subjects against their repetition. For the past twenty years,\r\n    whenever difficulties have arisen with foreign nations, it has\r\n    been our duty to issue solemn warnings and reproofs. But the\r\n    saying which is in common use, that we ‘sleep on brushwood and\r\n    taste gall’ has, by lapse of time, become almost meaningless;\r\n    when we talk of putting our house in order, and reforming\r\n    our finances, the words have no real significance. The time\r\n    of danger once over, favouritism and the neglect of public\r\n    business go on as of old; as of old, money purchases rank,\r\n    and the Throne continues to be persistently misled. Let our\r\n    officials ask themselves in the silence of the night watches\r\n    whether, even had there been no Boxer rebellion, China could\r\n    possibly have become a great Power? Even before these disasters\r\n    occurred there was great difficulty in maintaining our position\r\n    as a nation, and now, after this awful visitation, it must\r\n    be obvious to the dullest amongst us that our weakness and\r\n    poverty have been greatly increased. To our Ministers of State,\r\n    who have received high favour from the Throne, we would say\r\n    that, at this time of our nation’s history, it is essential to\r\n    display new qualities of integrity and patriotism. Taxation\r\n    should now be re-arranged in such a manner as to enable us\r\n    to repay the foreign indemnities, while bearing in mind the\r\n    poverty of the lower classes of the people. In the selection\r\n    of officials, good character should be considered the first\r\n    essential, and men of talent should be encouraged to the utmost.\r\n\r\n    “The whole duty of a Minister of State may be summed up in two\r\n    words: to abolish corrupt tendencies, and to put off the abuses\r\n    of former days. Justice and energy should be the principles\r\n    guiding towards economical and military efficiency; on this the\r\n    spirit of the nation and its future depend as upon its very\r\n    life blood.\r\n\r\n    “For nearly thirty years our mother, the Empress Dowager, has\r\n    laboured without ceasing to instruct us and train us in the\r\n    right way, and now, at one blow, all the results of her labour\r\n    are brought to nought. We cannot but remember the abomination\r\n    of desecration which has overthrown our ancestral shrines and\r\n    the temples of our gods. Looking to the North, we think upon\r\n    our Capital ruined and profaned, upon the thousands of our\r\n    highest officials whose families have lost their all, of the\r\n    millions of our subjects whose lives and property have been\r\n    sacrificed in this cataclysm. We can never cease to reproach\r\n    ourselves: how then should we reproach others? Our object in\r\n    issuing this solemn warning is to show that the prosperity or\r\n    the ruin of a State depends solely upon the energy or apathy\r\n    of its rulers and people, and that the weakness of an Empire\r\n    is the direct result of rottenness in its administration. We\r\n    desire to reiterate our commands that friendly relations with\r\n    foreign Powers are to be encouraged, that at the same time our\r\n    defences are to be strengthened, that freedom of speech and\r\n    the employment of trustworthy servants are to be encouraged. We\r\n    expect obedience to these commands, and sincere patriotism from\r\n    our subjects. Earnestly the Empress Dowager and ourselves pray\r\n    that it may be brought home to our Ministers of State, that\r\n    only out of suffering is wisdom developed, and that a sense of\r\n    duty insists upon unceasing effort. Let this Decree be made\r\n    known throughout the entire Empire.”\r\n\r\nThis Edict was issued in February, coincidently with Her Majesty’s\r\nacceptance of the conditions imposed by the Powers in the peace\r\nnegotiations at Peking. From that date until, in June, the terms of the\r\nProtocol were definitely settled by the plenipotentiaries, her attitude\r\ncontinued to be one of nervous apprehension, while the discomfort of life\r\nat Hsi-an, as well as the advice repeatedly given her by Jung Lu and the\r\nprovincial Viceroys, combined to make her look forward with impatience to\r\nthe day when she might set out for her capital.\r\n\r\nThere remained only one source of difficulty, namely, the presence\r\nof Prince Tuan’s son, the Heir Apparent, at her Court. Tzŭ Hsi was\r\nwell aware that she could hardly look for cordial relations with the\r\nrepresentatives of the Powers at Peking, or for sympathy abroad, so\r\nlong as this son of the Boxer chief remained heir to the Throne. It\r\nwould clearly be impossible, in the event of his becoming Emperor, for\r\nhim to consent to his father remaining under sentence of banishment,\r\nand equally impossible to expect the Powers to consent to Prince Tuan’s\r\nrehabilitation and return. Yet the youth had been duly and solemnly\r\nappointed to succeed to the Throne, a thing not lightly to be set aside.\r\nOnce again the Old Buddha showed that the sacred laws of succession were\r\nless than a strong woman’s will.\r\n\r\nPolitics apart, it was common knowledge that Tzŭ Hsi had for some time\r\nrepented of her choice of Prince Tuan’s ill-mannered, uncouth son as\r\nHeir Apparent. More than once had she been brought to shame by his wild,\r\nand sometimes disgraceful, conduct. Even in her presence, the lad paid\r\nlittle heed to the formalities of Court etiquette, and none at all to\r\nthe dignity of his own rank and future position. Tzŭ Hsi was therefore\r\nprobably not sorry of the excuse for deposing him from that high estate.\r\nIn the Decree cancelling his title to the Throne, she observed that his\r\nfather, Prince Tuan, had brought the Empire to the verge of ruin, and\r\nthat the guilt which he had thus incurred towards his august ancestors\r\ncould never be wiped out. In order to save the “face” of the Heir\r\nApparent and her own, in a difficult position, the Edict describes him\r\nas being fully convinced of the impossibility of his succeeding to the\r\nThrone under existing conditions, and that he himself had therefore\r\npetitioned Her Majesty to cancel her previous decision. In granting this\r\nrequest and directing him to remove himself forthwith from the Palace\r\nprecincts, the Empress conferred upon him the rank of an Imperial Duke\r\nof the lowest grade, excusing him at the same time from performance of\r\nany official duties in that capacity. By this decision she meant to mark\r\nthe contempt into which the Heir Apparent had fallen, for the rank thus\r\ngranted him was a low one, and, without any official duties or salary,\r\nhe was condemned to a life of poverty and obscurity. This fallen Heir to\r\nthe Dragon Throne is a well-known figure to-day in the lowest haunts of\r\nthe Chinese City at Peking: a drunkard and disreputable character, living\r\nthe life of a gambler, notorious only as a swashbuckler of romantic past\r\nand picturesque type,—one who, but for adverse fate and the accursed\r\nforeigner, would have been Emperor of China at this moment.\r\n\r\nHaving deposed him, the Empress let it be known that the selection of an\r\nheir to the disconsolate shade of T’ung-Chih would be postponed “until a\r\nsuitable candidate should be found,” an intimation generally understood\r\nto mean that the vital question of providing an heir in legitimate and\r\nproper succession to the Throne could not well be determined until\r\nChina’s foreign relations, as well as her internal affairs, had been\r\nplaced upon a basis of greater security. It is curious to note how, in\r\nall such utterances, it appears to have been tacitly understood that the\r\nEmperor Kuang Hsü was a “bad life.”\r\n\r\nThus, in exile, the Old Buddha wore philosophically the white sheet of\r\npenance and burned the candle of expiation, preparatory to re-entering\r\nanon upon a new lease of power in that Peking where, as she well knew,\r\nthe memory of the foreigner is short and his patience long. In June,\r\n1901, the terms of peace were settled; on the 7th September the Peace\r\nProtocol was solemnly signed by the representatives of all the Powers,\r\nthat “monument of collective inefficiency” which was to sow the seeds\r\nof trouble to last for many years to come. At Hsi-an “in the profound\r\nseclusion of the Palace” she knew remorse, not unstimulated by fear;\r\non the return journey to her capital (from 20th October, 1901, to 6th\r\nJanuary, 1902), while preparing her arts and graces to captivate the\r\nbarbarian, she was still a victim to doubt and apprehension. Meanwhile,\r\nat Peking, the mandarin world, reassured by the attitude of the peace\r\nnegotiators and their terms, was fast shedding its garments of fear and\r\npeacocking as of yore, in renewed assurance of its own indisputable\r\nsuperiority. Evidence of this spirit was to be met with on all sides,\r\ngradually coming to its fine flower in the subsequent negotiations for\r\nthe revision of the commercial Treaties, and bringing home once more,\r\nto those who study these things, the unalterable truth of the discovery\r\nmade years ago by one of the earliest British representatives in China,\r\nnamely, that “this people yields nothing to reason and everything to\r\nfear.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable instances of this revival of the mandarin’s\r\ntraditional arrogance of superiority occurred, significantly enough,\r\nin connection with the penitential mission of the Emperor’s brother,\r\nPrince Ch’un (now Regent) to Berlin, an episode which threatened for\r\na moment to lead to a rupture between Germany and China. By Article 1\r\nof the Peace Protocol, Prince Ch’un had been specially designated for\r\nthis mission to convey in person to the German Emperor the regrets of\r\nthe Chinese Government for the murder of Baron von Ketteler. He left\r\nPeking for the purpose on the 12th July, 1901, with definite instructions\r\nas to the manner in which the Chinese Government’s regrets were to be\r\nexpressed. The German Emperor’s proposals as to the form of ceremony to\r\nbe followed in this matter were regarded by Prince Ch’un as incompatible\r\nwith his instructions, and it will be remembered that, after some\r\nhesitation on the part of the German Government, the Chinese policy of\r\npassive resistance eventually carried the day. The following telegraphic\r\ncorrespondence on the subject is of permanent interest. Prince Ch’un\r\n(whose personal name is Tsai Feng) telegraphed from Germany on the\r\n26th September to the Peace Plenipotentiaries, Prince Ch’ing and Li\r\nHung-chang, as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “I have duly received the Grand Council’s message, and note\r\n    that I am commanded to act as circumstances may require,\r\n    and that a middle course is suggested as expedient. I fully\r\n    appreciate the intelligent caution of your policy, and\r\n    fortunately had already taken steps to act in the sense\r\n    indicated. On the 14th of this moon the German Emperor had\r\n    given orders to stop preparations for the ceremony, but as I\r\n    noticed that the Royal train had not been withdrawn nor had\r\n    his aide-de-camp left my suite, I inferred that there was a\r\n    possibility of his yielding the points in dispute. Accordingly,\r\n    after a long discussion of the situation with Yin Ch’ang, I\r\n    directed him to write in German to Jeng-yintai[119] requesting\r\n    his friendly intervention at the Foreign Office with a definite\r\n    explanation that China could not possibly agree that the\r\n    mission should be received kneeling, that Germany had nothing\r\n    to gain on insisting upon such a procedure, and that the only\r\n    result of a fiasco would be to make both countries appear\r\n    extremely ridiculous. I therefore begged that the Emperor\r\n    should accede to my personal appeal and waive the point. At\r\n    the same time I requested the German gentleman who acts as\r\n    Chinese Consul for Bavaria to address the Foreign Office to\r\n    the same effect, and with a request that we might enter upon\r\n    discussion of the point. Four days later I directed Lü Hai-huan\r\n    to return to his post at Berlin to make such arrangements as\r\n    might be possible, and on the following day I telegraphed to\r\n    him a summary of the Grand Council’s views on the matter. In\r\n    the afternoon of the 20th I received the Consul for Bavaria,\r\n    who informed me that he had received a telegram from the\r\n    Foreign Office inquiring when I proposed to start for Berlin,\r\n    and hoping that I would do so speedily, as the Emperor had now\r\n    consented to waive the question of our kneeling, but required\r\n    that only Yin Ch’ang should accompany me when presenting the\r\n    letter of regret, the remainder of my suite to remain in\r\n    another place.\r\n\r\n    “The same evening I received a message from Lü Hai-huan,\r\n    stating that the Emperor would undoubtedly receive me, and\r\n    that, since all other difficult questions had been settled, His\r\n    Majesty wished to leave for the country in a few days. Under\r\n    these circumstances I did not consider it advisable to insist\r\n    too strictly on minor details of etiquette, being pressed\r\n    for time, and I therefore requested the German Emperor’s\r\n    Chamberlain to have a special train prepared for my journey.\r\n    We reached Potsdam at 3 P.M. on the 21st[120]; I was met by a\r\n    General sent by the Emperor with his state carriage. Myself\r\n    and my suite were lodged in the Palace, where every attention\r\n    was shown to us, and it was arranged that I should fulfil my\r\n    mission on the following day, after depositing a wreath on the\r\n    grave of the late Empress. On the morning of the following day\r\n    I visited her tomb, and at noon the state carriage came to\r\n    take me to the New Palace, where, after being ushered into the\r\n    Emperor’s presence, I read aloud Their Majesties’ complimentary\r\n    letter. The members of my suite were awaiting in an adjoining\r\n    apartment. After the ceremony I was escorted back to my\r\n    residence, and at 2 P.M. the Emperor came to call upon me. He\r\n    was very cordial and remained talking with me for a long time.\r\n    By his orders a steam launch was provided for me, in which I\r\n    visited the Lake and Peacock Island; on the following day I\r\n    saw a review of the troops, and was presented to the Empress.\r\n    The Emperor begged me to remain longer in Berlin, suggesting\r\n    that I should visit the arsenals and inspect the fleet under\r\n    Prince Henry at Stettin. I could scarcely decline these polite\r\n    attentions, and after visiting the Empress I took lodging in\r\n    an hotel at Berlin. Thanks to the glorious prestige of our\r\n    Empire, matters have thus been satisfactorily settled, and\r\n    the knowledge that my mission has been satisfactorily carried\r\n    out will, I hope, bring comfort to Their Imperial Majesties\r\n    in their anxiety. I beg that you will memorialise the Throne\r\n    accordingly. Tsai Feng.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress Dowager was pleased to express her approval of the result of\r\nthis mission, which in the eyes of the Chinese Government was undoubtedly\r\none of those diplomatic triumphs which China appears to attain most\r\neasily when her material resources have completely failed. Reading the\r\nabove despatch, it is difficult to realise that the Prince’s mission had\r\nfor its object the expiation of a brutal murder committed, with the full\r\napproval of the Chinese Government and Court, on the representative of a\r\nfriendly nation. The opinion is commonly believed, held by the Legations\r\nat Peking, that the present Regent has learned much since he returned\r\nfrom that penitential mission to the German capital. During the present\r\nyear his brothers have been engaged on missions ostensibly intended to\r\nacquire knowledge for the sorely-needed reorganisation of China’s army\r\nand navy, missions which have been received with royal honours by almost\r\nevery civilised Power; but there are many close observers of the changing\r\nconditions at Peking who see in these missions merely a repetition\r\nof farces that have often been played before, and an attempt to gain\r\nprestige in the eyes of the Chinese people for the Regent’s family and\r\nthe Court, rather than any definite intention or desire to reform the\r\nofficial system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIS HIGHNESS PRINCE TSAI HSÜN.\r\n\r\nBrother of the late Emperor and Present Regent—recently head of the Naval\r\nMission to Europe and America.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF THE COURT TO PEKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state of mind of the Empress Dowager during the flight from the\r\nCapital, and subsequently while the Court remained in exile at Hsi-an,\r\nwas marked by that same quality of indecision and vacillating impulse\r\nwhich had characterised her actions throughout the Boxer crisis and the\r\nsiege of Peking. This may be ascribed partly to her advancing age and\r\npartly to the conflicting influences of astrologers and fortune-tellers,\r\nto whose advice she attached the greatest importance in all times of\r\nperil. We have dealt in another place with her marked susceptibility to\r\nomens and superstitious beliefs; its effect is most noticeable, however,\r\nat this stage of her life, and was conspicuous in matters of small detail\r\nthroughout the return journey to Peking.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Jung Lu at Hsi-an, and that of Li Hung-chang at Peking,\r\nhad been systematically exercised to induce Her Majesty to return to the\r\nCapital; but until the Peace Protocol conditions had been definitely\r\narranged, and until she had been persuaded to decree adequate punishment\r\nupon the Boxer leaders, the predominant feeling in her mind was evidently\r\none of suspicion and fear, as was shown when she ordered the hurried\r\nflight from T’ai-yüan fu to Hsi-an. The influence of Li Hung-chang,\r\nwho, from the outset, had realised the folly committed by the Chinese\r\nGovernment in approving the attack upon the Legations, was exercised to\r\ncreate in the mind of Her Majesty a clearer sense of the folly of that\r\npolicy. At the height of the crisis (21st July, 1900), realising that the\r\nforeign forces brought to bear upon China were steadily defeating both\r\nBoxers and Imperial troops, she appointed Li Hung-chang to be Viceroy of\r\nChihli, and directed that he should proceed from Canton with all haste,\r\nthere being urgent need of the services of a diplomat versed in foreign\r\naffairs. Her Majesty went so far as to suggest that he should proceed\r\nfrom Shanghai to Tientsin in a Russian vessel which “he might borrow for\r\nthe purpose.” Li Hung-chang’s reply, telegraphed to Yüan Shih-k’ai for\r\ntransmission to the Throne, while outwardly respectful, clearly implies\r\nthat Her Majesty has been to blame for the disasters then occurring.\r\n“I am sincerely grateful,” he says, “for Your Majesty’s gratifying\r\nconfidence in me, but cannot help recalling to mind the folly which has\r\nnow suddenly destroyed that structure of reformed administration which,\r\nduring my twenty years’ term of office as Viceroy of Chihli, I was able\r\nto build up not unsuccessfully. I fear it will not be possible for me to\r\nresume the duties of this difficult post at a time of crisis like the\r\npresent, destitute as I am of all proper and material resources.” He\r\nproceeds even to criticise Her Majesty’s suggestion as to his journey,\r\nobserving that “Russia possesses no vessel at Shanghai, and would\r\ncertainly refuse to lend if she had one, in view of the state of war\r\nnow existing.” Finally, he excuses himself for deferring his departure,\r\non the ground that the British Minister had requested him not to leave\r\nuntil the foreign Ministers had been safely escorted from Peking to\r\nTientsin. “I do not know,” says he, “if any such arrangements for safely\r\nescorting them can be made,” and therefore concludes by asking Yüan to\r\ninform the Throne that he will start northwards, journeying by land, “as\r\nsoon as his health permits it.” To this plain-spoken message from the\r\ngreat Viceroy, Tzŭ Hsi replied in two lines of equally characteristic\r\ndirectness:—“Li Hung-chang is to obey our earlier Decree, and to make all\r\nhaste northwards. The crisis is serious. Let him make no further excuses\r\nfor delay.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of these peremptory orders, Li Hung-chang, who had a very\r\ndefinite conception of his own predicament, remained at Shanghai,\r\nostensibly negotiating, but in reality waiting, to see what would be\r\nthe outcome of the siege of the Legations. He was interviewed by _The\r\nTimes_ correspondent at Shanghai on the 23rd of July, and then stated\r\nthat he would not proceed to his post in the north until convinced by\r\nclear proofs that the Empress Dowager had seen the folly of her ways,\r\nand was prepared to adopt a conciliatory policy towards the outraged\r\nforeign Powers. At the end of July, when it became clear to him that\r\nthe Court had determined on flight, he forwarded by special courier a\r\nvery remarkable Memorial, in which he called the Throne to task in the\r\nplainest possible terms, and urged an immediate change of policy. This\r\nMemorial reached the Empress before her departure from Peking; certain\r\nextracts from it are well worth reproduction, as showing Li Hung-chang at\r\nhis best, and displaying that quality of courageous intelligence which\r\nmade him for twenty years the foremost official in China and a world-wide\r\ncelebrity:—\r\n\r\n    “It is to be remembered that between this, our Empire of\r\n    China, and the outer barbarians, hostilities have frequently\r\n    occurred since the remotest antiquity, and our national history\r\n    teaches that the best way to meet them is to determine upon\r\n    our policy only after carefully ascertaining their strength\r\n    as compared with our own. Since the middle of the reign of\r\n    Tao-Kuang the pressure of the barbarians on our borders has\r\n    steadily increased, and to-day we are brought to desperate\r\n    straits indeed. In 1860 they invaded the Capital and burnt the\r\n    Summer Palace; His Majesty Hsien-Feng was forced to flee, and\r\n    thus came to his death. It is only natural that His Majesty’s\r\n    posterity should long to avenge him to the end of time, and\r\n    that your subjects should continue to cherish undying hopes of\r\n    revenge. But since that time, France has taken from us Annam,\r\n    the whole of that dependency being irretrievably lost; Japan\r\n    has fought us, and ousted us from Korea. Even worse disasters\r\n    and loss of territory were, however, to follow: Germany\r\n    seized Kiaochao; Russia followed by annexing Port Arthur and\r\n    Talienwan; England demanded Wei-hei-wei and Kowloon, together\r\n    with the extension of the Shanghai Settlements, and the opening\r\n    of new treaty ports inland; and France made further demands\r\n    for Kuang-Chou wan. How could we possibly maintain silence\r\n    under such grievous and repeated acts of aggression? Craven\r\n    would be the man who would not seek to improve our defences,\r\n    and shameless would be he who did not long for the day of\r\n    reckoning. I myself have enjoyed no small favours from the\r\n    Throne, and much is expected of me by the nation. Needless for\r\n    me to say how greatly I would rejoice were it possible for\r\n    China to enter upon a glorious and triumphant war; it would\r\n    be the joy of my closing days to see the barbarian nations\r\n    subjugated at last in submissive allegiance, respectfully\r\n    making obeisance to the Dragon Throne. Unfortunately, however,\r\n    I cannot but recognise the melancholy fact that China is\r\n    unequal to any such enterprise, and that our forces are in\r\n    no way competent to undertake it. Looking at the question as\r\n    one affecting chiefly the integrity of our Empire, who would\r\n    be so foolish as to cast missiles at a rat in the vicinity\r\n    of a priceless piece of porcelain? It requires no augur’s\r\n    skill in divination to foresee that eggs are more easily to\r\n    be cracked than stones. Let us consider one recent incident\r\n    in proof of this conclusion. Recently, in the attack by some\r\n    tens of thousands of Boxers and Imperial troops upon the\r\n    foreign Settlements at Tientsin, there were some two or three\r\n    thousand foreign soldiers to defend them; yet, after ten days\r\n    of desperate fighting, only a few hundred foreigners had been\r\n    slain, while no less than twenty thousand Chinese were killed\r\n    and as many more wounded. Again, there are no real defences\r\n    or fortified positions in the Legations at Peking, nor are\r\n    the foreign Ministers and their Legation staffs trained in\r\n    the use of arms; nevertheless, Tung Fu-hsiang’s hordes have\r\n    been bombarding them for more than a month, and have lost many\r\n    thousands of men in the vain attempt to capture the position.\r\n\r\n    “The fleets of the Allied Powers are now hurrying forward vast\r\n    bodies of their troops; the heaviest artillery is now being\r\n    brought swiftly to our shores. Has China the forces to meet\r\n    them? Does she possess a single leader capable of resisting\r\n    this invasion? If the foreign Powers send 100,000 men, they\r\n    will easily capture Peking, and Your Majesties will then find\r\n    escape impossible. You will no doubt endeavour once more to\r\n    flee to Jehol, but on this occasion you have no commander\r\n    like Sheng Pao to hold back the enemies’ forces from pursuit;\r\n    or, perhaps, you may decide to hold another Peace Conference,\r\n    like that at Shimonoseki, in 1895? But the conditions to-day\r\n    existing are in no way similar to those of that time,\r\n    when Marquis Ito was willing to meet me as your Minister\r\n    Plenipotentiary. When betrayed by the Boxers and abandoned\r\n    by all, where will your Majesties find a single Prince,\r\n    Councillor, or Statesman able to assist you effectively? The\r\n    fortunes of your house are being staked upon a single throw;\r\n    my blood runs cold at the thought of events to come. Under\r\n    any enlightened Sovereign these Boxers, with their ridiculous\r\n    claims of supernatural powers, would most assuredly have been\r\n    condemned to death long since. Is it not on record that the Han\r\n    Dynasty met its end because of its belief in magicians, and in\r\n    their power to confer invisibility? Was not the Sung Dynasty\r\n    destroyed because the Emperor believed ridiculous stories about\r\n    supernatural warriors clad in miraculous coats of mail?\r\n\r\n    “I myself am nearly eighty years of age, and my death cannot\r\n    be far distant; I have received favours at the hands of four\r\n    Emperors. If now I hesitate to say the things that are in my\r\n    mind, how shall I face the spirits of the sacred ancestors of\r\n    this Dynasty when we meet in the halls of Hades? I am compelled\r\n    therefore to give utterance to this my solemn prayer, and to\r\n    beseech Your Majesties to put away from you at once these vile\r\n    magic workers, and to have them summarily executed.\r\n\r\n    “You should take steps immediately to appoint a high official\r\n    who shall purge the land of this villainous rabble, and who\r\n    shall see to it that the foreign Ministers are safely escorted\r\n    to the headquarters of the Allied Armies. In spite of the great\r\n    heat, I have hurried northwards from Canton to Shanghai, where\r\n    your Majesties’ Decrees urging me to come to Peking have duly\r\n    reached me. Any physical weakness, however serious, would not\r\n    have deterred me from obeying this summons, but perusal of your\r\n    Decrees has led me to the conclusion that Your Majesties have\r\n    not yet adopted a policy of reason, but are still in the hands\r\n    of traitors, regarding these Boxers as your dutiful subjects,\r\n    with the result that unrest is spreading and alarm universal.\r\n    Moreover, I am here in Shanghai without a single soldier under\r\n    my command, and even should I proceed with all haste in the\r\n    endeavour to present myself at your Palace gates, I should meet\r\n    with innumerable dangers by the way, and the end of my journey\r\n    would most probably be that I should provide your rebellious\r\n    and turbulent subjects with one more carcass to hack into\r\n    mincemeat. I shall therefore continue in residence here for\r\n    the present, considering ways and means for raising a military\r\n    force and for furnishing supplies, as well as availing myself\r\n    of the opportunity of ascertaining the enemies’ plans, and\r\n    making such diplomatic suggestions as occur to me to be useful.\r\n    As soon as my plans are complete, I shall proceed northwards\r\n    with all possible speed.”\r\n\r\nThe plain-spoken advice of Li Hung-chang was not without effect on the\r\nEmpress Dowager. The Decrees issued by her in the name of the Emperor\r\nfrom Huai-lai on the 19th and 20th of August are the first indications\r\ngiven to the outside world that she had definitely decided on a policy\r\nof conciliation so as to render possible her eventual return to the\r\ncapital—an event which, as she foresaw, would probably be facilitated\r\nby the inevitable differences and jealousies already existing among the\r\nAllies.\r\n\r\nIn the Edict of the 19th of August, after explaining that the whole Boxer\r\ncrisis and the attack on the Legations was the result of differences\r\nbetween Christian and non-Christian Chinese, she querulously complains\r\nthat the foreign Powers, although doubtless well meaning in their\r\nefforts to “exterminate the rebels,” are behaving in a manner which\r\nsuggests aggressive designs towards China, and which shows a lamentable\r\ndisregard of proper procedure and friendliness. She naively observes\r\nthat the Chinese Government had been at the greatest pains to protect\r\nthe lives and property of foreigners in Peking, in spite of many\r\ndifficulties, and expresses much surprise at such an evil return being\r\nmade for her invariable kindness and courtesy. If it were not for the\r\nunbounded capacity of foreign diplomats, fully proved in the past, in the\r\nmatter of credulity where Chinese statecraft is concerned, it would be\r\ndifficult to regard utterances like these as the work of an intelligent\r\nruler. But Tzŭ Hsi was, as usual, justified, for at the very time\r\nwhen these Decrees were issued, Russia was already using very similar\r\narguments, and making excuses for the Chinese government, in pursuance of\r\nher own policy at Peking.\r\n\r\nIn the conclusion of the Decree above referred to, Her Majesty orders\r\nJung Lu, Hsü T’ung and Ch’ung Ch’i to remain in Peking to act as peace\r\nnegotiators, but she admits that, in dealing with foreigners supported\r\nby troops and flushed with success, it may be difficult for them at the\r\noutset to determine on a satisfactory line of procedure. She leaves it to\r\nthese plenipotentiaries, therefore, to determine whether the best course\r\nwould be to telegraph to the respective Foreign Offices of the countries\r\nconcerned, or to consult with the Consuls-General at Shanghai (_sic_),\r\nwith a view to obtaining friendly intervention! It could not escape so\r\nshrewd a person as Tzŭ Hsi that the atmosphere of Peking at this juncture\r\nwas not likely to be favourable to her purposes, and that it would be\r\neasier to hoodwink the Foreign Offices and the Consuls at Shanghai than\r\nthose who had just been through the siege.\r\n\r\nA Decree of the following day, also in the name of the Emperor, is\r\ncouched in a very different strain—a pathetic admission of the Throne’s\r\nguilt, a plea for the sympathy of his people, and an exhortation to\r\nreturn to ways of wisdom. “Cleanse your hearts, and remove all doubt\r\nand suspicion from your minds, so as to assist us, the Emperor, in our\r\nshortcomings. We have been utterly unworthy, but the time is at hand when\r\nit shall be for us to prove that Heaven has not left us without sense of\r\nour errors and deep remorse.” The whole document reads with an unusual\r\nring of sincerity, accepting, in the name of the Emperor, full blame for\r\nall the disasters which had overtaken the country, while reminding the\r\nofficial class that the first cause of these calamities dates back to\r\nthe time when they learned and adopted habits of inveterate sloth and\r\nluxury. From depths of contrition, the Edict admits fully the Throne’s\r\nresponsibility, “We, the Lord of this Empire, have failed utterly in\r\nwarding off calamities from our people, and we should not hesitate for\r\none moment to commit suicide, in order to placate our tutelary deities\r\nand the gods of the soil, but we cannot forget that duty of filial piety\r\nand service which we owe to our sacred and aged mother, the Empress\r\nDowager.”\r\n\r\nThe policy of reform is now clearly enunciated and outlined as an\r\nessential condition of the future government of the Empire. Provincial\r\nand metropolitan officials are ordered to proceed at once to join the\r\nCourt, in order that the reform programme may be speedily initiated; the\r\nYangtsze Viceroys are thanked for preserving order in accordance with\r\n“treaty stipulations,” and Chinese converts to Christianity are once more\r\nassured of the Throne’s protection and good-will.\r\n\r\nThese utterances of the Throne, which lost nothing in their presentation\r\nto the respective Powers by Prince Ch’ing and his colleagues, soon\r\nproduced the desired effect, and reassured the Throne and its advisers as\r\nto their personal safety. Accordingly, early in September, we find all\r\nthe Viceroys and high officials of the Provinces uniting in a Memorial,\r\nwhereby the Court is urged to return at once to the Capital, advice\r\nwhich would never have been given had there been any question of violent\r\nmeasures being taken by the Allies against the Empress Dowager. At this\r\ntime the question of the future location of the Chinese Capital was\r\nbeing widely discussed at Court, and there was much conflicting advice\r\non the subject. The Viceroys’ Memorial was drafted by Yüan Shih-k’ai\r\nand forwarded by him to Liu K’un-yi, at Nanking, for transmission; it\r\ndefinitely blames the Boxers and their leaders for the ruin which had\r\ncome upon China, and rejoices at the thought that “the perplexities\r\nwhich embarrassed your Majesties in the past have now given place to a\r\nclearer understanding of the situation.” Noting the possibility of the\r\nCourt’s leaving T’ai-yüan fu and making “a further progress” westwards to\r\nHsi-an, the Memorialists deplore the idea and proceed to show that such\r\na step would be unwise as well as inconvenient. As an example of the way\r\nin which Chinese Ministers of State deal with questions of high policy\r\nand strategy, the following extract from this Memorial is not without\r\ninterest:—\r\n\r\n    “It is true that, in times past, our Capital has been shifted\r\n    on more than one occasion of national danger, but in those\r\n    days our enemies were not able to push their armies far into\r\n    the interior of our country for indefinite periods, and were\r\n    compelled to withdraw after brief expeditions. The position\r\n    of affairs to-day, however, is very different, so that we can\r\n    obtain no reliable guidance from precedents of history. As\r\n    regards the province of Shensi, it has always been a centre of\r\n    wars and rebellions; its people are poverty stricken, and there\r\n    is no trade there. Seven centuries ago, Hsi-an was an Imperial\r\n    city, but is now anything but prosperous. Its vicinity to Kansu\r\n    and the New Dominion territories, infested with Mahomedan\r\n    rebels and adjoining the Russian Empire, renders it most\r\n    unsuitable as a site for your Majesties’ Capital. Supposing\r\n    that the Allies, flushed with success, should determine on an\r\n    advance westwards, what is there to prevent them from doing so?\r\n    If ten thousand miles of ocean have not stopped them, are they\r\n    likely to be turned back from a shorter expedition by land?”\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the fact that the cradle of the Dynasty and the tombs\r\nof its ancestors are situated near Peking, and that it is geographically\r\nbest fitted to be the centre of Government, the Memorialists remind\r\nthe Throne that the foreign Powers have promised to vacate Peking, and\r\nto refrain from annexing any territory if the Court will return. These\r\nends, they say, will not be attained should the Court persist in its\r\nintention to proceed further westwards, since it is now the desire of\r\nthe foreign Ministers that China’s rulers should return to Peking. In\r\nthe event of a permanent occupation of Peking by the Allies, the loss\r\nof Manchuria would be inevitable. The Memorialists predict partition\r\nand many other disasters, including financial distress, and the\r\nimpossibility of furnishing the Throne with supplies at Hsi-an or any\r\nother remote corner of the Empire. If the Court’s decision to proceed to\r\nHsi-an is irrevocable, at least a Decree should now be issued, stating\r\nthat its sojourn there will be a brief one, and that the Court will\r\nreturn to Peking upon the complete restoration of peaceful conditions.\r\n“The continued existence of the Empire must depend upon the Throne’s\r\ndecision upon this matter.” The Memorial concludes by imploring their\r\nMajesties to authorise Prince Ch’ing to inform the foreign Ministers\r\nthat the withdrawal of the allied armies will be followed by a definite\r\nannouncement as to the Court’s return.\r\n\r\nIn a further Memorial from the Viceroys and Governors, it is stated that\r\nthe Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs had suggested to the Chinese\r\nMinister in St. Petersburg, that the location of the Capital at Hsi-an\r\nwould certainly prove undesirable, in view of the poverty-stricken\r\ncondition of the province, and that their Majesties would no doubt,\r\ntherefore, proceed to Lan-chou fu, in Kansu. Referring to this\r\ninteresting fact, the Memorialists observe:—\r\n\r\n    “Those who are in favour of establishing the Capital at Hsi-an\r\n    profess to claim that the Yellow River and the T’ung Kuan Pass\r\n    constitute natural and impassible frontiers against attack.\r\n    They forget, however, that foreign nations possess artillery of\r\n    very long range. At T’ung Kuan the Yellow River is less than\r\n    two miles wide, and their guns will easily carry twice that\r\n    distance. Your Majesties have nothing but the native artillery,\r\n    and a few inferior foreign guns, and would never be able to\r\n    hold the position. The foreigners would undoubtedly penetrate\r\n    far into the interior, and control all the waterways, thus\r\n    preventing transport and supplies. Even if one foreign Power\r\n    were to find it difficult, there is no doubt that it would be\r\n    easy for several of them acting together.\r\n\r\n    “Moreover, friendly Powers are entitled, by the law of\r\n    civilised nations, to send their diplomatic representatives\r\n    to our Capital. If peace be made, and the foreign Powers\r\n    assent to the proposed change of capital, they will surely\r\n    insist upon sending their envoys into Shensi. After their\r\n    recent experiences, they will require to have foreign troops\r\n    to guard their Legations, whose numbers must necessarily be\r\n    large, in proportion to the distance from the coast. Foreign\r\n    garrisons would thus have to be established at points in\r\n    Honan, Shansi and Chihli, in order to maintain their line of\r\n    communications, so that China would eventually be overrun by\r\n    foreign troops. It is, therefore, plainly out of the question\r\n    that the Court should leave Peking. In times of peace it might\r\n    have been suggested, but to think of it after a disastrous\r\n    war is impossible. The foreigners are acting in unison;\r\n    China is completely disorganised. They have ample resources\r\n    and reinforcements; China has none. If we have thoughts of\r\n    fighting any foreign Power we must first form alliances with\r\n    several others; in any case nothing can be done before an ample\r\n    supply of ordnance and munitions of war has been accumulated.\r\n    This is no time for considering such possibilities. We, your\r\n    Memorialists, venture to suggest that Your Majesties have\r\n    failed to take into consideration all these facts, and in\r\n    impressing them upon you, we earnestly beg that you may now\r\n    come to a wise decision.”\r\n\r\nBefore coming to a decision, however, Tzŭ Hsi required to be fully\r\nassured that the foreign Powers would not insist on her abdicating the\r\nsupreme power as one of the conditions of peace. Convinced on that point,\r\nthe hesitation which she had previously shown in regard to returning to\r\nPeking dropped from her like a garment. It had been freely predicted by\r\nconservative officials and the _literati_ that the Old Buddha would never\r\nagain wish to see her desecrated capital or to visit the polluted shrines\r\nof her ancestors. In spite of her superstitious nature, however, she was\r\nfar too level-headed and far-seeing a woman to attach supreme importance\r\nto sentimental considerations, or to allow them to weigh heavily in\r\nthe balance when the question of her own rulership was at stake. The\r\nhesitation which she had shown and the attention which she had paid to\r\nthe advice of those who, like Chang Chih-tung, desired her to establish\r\na new capital in Central China, were primarily a question of “face.” She\r\nwould only return to Peking if guaranteed the full dignity and power of\r\nher former position. But as the peace negotiations proceeded, and as\r\nit became clear to her that along the well-worn path of international\r\njealousies she might return unpunished, and even welcomed, to Peking, she\r\nproceeded to make preparations for an early return. Fully informed each\r\nday by Prince Ch’ing of the progress which her plenipotentiaries were\r\nmaking towards the completion of the Peace Protocol, and overjoyed at\r\nits terms, she waited only until the condition of the roads, always more\r\nor less impassable after the summer rains, had sufficiently improved to\r\npermit of comfortable travelling. During the delay necessitated by the\r\ncollecting and packing of the enormous quantity of “tribute” collected\r\nby Her Majesty and the Court during their stay at Hsi-an, she received\r\ndefinite confirmation of the good news that her treasure vaults in the\r\ncapital had not been plundered by the foreign troops—good news which\r\nincreased her anxiety to return as quickly as possible to superintend\r\nits removal before any pilfering by the eunuchs should take place.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 24th day of the 8th Moon (20th October, 1901) that the\r\nlong procession started from Her Majesty’s temporary residence in the\r\nGovernor’s Yamên; followed by an enormous retinue, she commenced her\r\njourney by sacrificing to the God of War, the guardian spirit of her\r\nDynasty (and, it may be added, patron of the Boxers), at a small temple\r\noutside the city gates. From this onward the Court advanced northward by\r\neasy stages of about twenty-five miles a day, resting first at Ho-nan fu;\r\nthence on to K’ai-fêng, where her sixty-sixth birthday was celebrated\r\nand where she remained for some weeks. The travelling lodges and other\r\narrangements for her comfort and convenience along the whole line of her\r\nroute were in striking contrast to the squalor and privation which the\r\nCourt had endured in the flight from Peking.\r\n\r\nIt was during her stay at K’ai-fêng that the Peace Protocol was signed at\r\nPeking. It was also before her departure from that city, at the end of\r\nthe 9th Moon, that Li Hung-chang died. His knowledge of foreign affairs\r\nand remarkable ability in negotiations had been of the greatest service\r\nto his Imperial mistress, and there is no doubt that the liberal terms\r\ngranted to China by the victorious Allies were very largely due to his\r\nefforts. Her Majesty, while fully appreciating his ability, had never\r\ntreated him with marked favour, and had always refused to appoint him to\r\nthe Grand Council, giving as her excuse that she could not understand his\r\ndialect. Upon his death, however, she conferred upon him an honour which\r\nhad never before been granted to any Chinese subject under the Dynasty,\r\nnamely, that of having a shrine built to his memory at the capital\r\nitself, in addition to those erected in the provinces where he had borne\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIt was significant of her impartial and intelligent rulership that,\r\nalthough she had blamed him as originally responsible for the Japanese\r\nWar and its disastrous results, she had never approved of the Emperor’s\r\nhasty and vindictive action in removing him from the Viceroyalty of\r\nChihli. Upon the signing of the Peace Protocol she conferred additional\r\nposthumous honours upon him, taking occasion at the same time, in an\r\nImperial Decree, to congratulate and thank Prince Ch’ing, Yüan Shih-k’ai\r\nand others, who assisted in bringing about the settlement of peace terms.\r\nIn particular she praised the loyalty of Jung Lu, “who had earnestly\r\nadvised the annihilation of the Boxers, and who, in addition to other\r\nmeritorious services on the Grand Council, had been chiefly instrumental\r\nin protecting the Legations.”\r\n\r\nAfter a series of magnificent theatrical entertainments in honour of\r\nher birthday, the Court left K’ai-fêng and continued its journey to the\r\ncapital. On the eve of her departure Her Majesty took occasion sternly\r\nand publicly to rebuke the Manchu Prefect, Wen T’i,[121] who had dared\r\nto advise her against returning to the capital, and to predict that the\r\ntreacherous foreigners would certainly seize her sacred person—a useful\r\npiece of play to the gallery.\r\n\r\nAt the crossing of the Yellow River, which took place in beautiful\r\nweather, she sacrificed to the River God, in expiation and thanksgiving.\r\nThe local officials had constructed a magnificent barge, in the form\r\nof a dragon, upon which she and the ladies of the Court crossed the\r\nstream. It was noticed from this point onwards that wherever foreigners\r\nhappened to be amongst the spectators of the Imperial cortège, she made\r\na point of showing them particular attention and civility, and before\r\nher arrival in Peking she issued a Decree commanding that Europeans\r\nshould not be prevented from watching the procession upon her arrival,\r\nand this in spite of the fact that, in accordance with the usual custom,\r\nthe Legations had issued notices forbidding their nationals to appear\r\nin the streets during the passage of the Imperial cortège. Everything\r\nindicated, in fact, that Her Majesty now desired to conciliate the\r\nEuropean Powers by all possible means, and if it be borne in mind that\r\nit was part of her deliberate policy thus to ingratiate herself with\r\nforeigners as a means of furthering her own future policy, her actions\r\nlose nothing of interest, while they gain something from the humorous\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nOn crossing the borders of the Province of Chihli, Her Majesty issued a\r\nDecree, couched in almost effusive terms of friendliness, proclaiming\r\nthat the Emperor would receive the foreign Ministers in audience\r\nimmediately upon his return to the Palace, and that the reception would\r\ntake place in the central Throne Hall of the sacred enclosure. Chinese,\r\nreading this Decree, and ignorant of the terms of the Peace Protocol\r\nwhich provided for this particular concession to the barbarian, would\r\nnaturally regard it as a spontaneous mark of the Imperial clemency and\r\ngoodwill. In the same Edict Her Majesty proclaimed her intention of\r\nreceiving the Ministers’ wives in person, intimating that she cherished\r\nmost pleasant memories of past friendly intercourse with them. Here,\r\nagain, we note fulfilment of a plan, deliberately conceived and formed\r\nupon the best classical models, “for dealing with strong and savage\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nAt noon on the 6th of January, 1902, the Imperial party arrived by\r\nspecial train at the temporary station which had been erected close to\r\nthe Southern walls of Peking, and adjoining the old terminus at Ma-chia\r\npu. Large pavilions, handsomely decorated, had been erected near the\r\nstation, in which the Old Buddha and the Emperor were to be received;\r\nthey were furnished with a throne of gold lacquer, cloisonné altar\r\nvessels and many valuable pieces of porcelain. Several hundreds of the\r\nhighest metropolitan officials were in attendance, and a special place\r\nhad been provided for foreigners. As the long train of over thirty\r\ncarriages drew up at the station, the keen face of the Old Buddha was\r\nseen anxiously scanning her surroundings from one of the windows of\r\nher car. With her were the young Empress and the Princess Imperial,\r\nwhile the chief eunuch, Li Lien-ying, was in attendance. Recognising\r\nHer Majesty, every official fell upon his knees, whilst Chi Lu, chief\r\nofficer of the Household, officiously shouted to the foreigners to remove\r\ntheir hats (which they had already done). The first to emerge from the\r\ntrain was the chief eunuch, who proceeded forthwith to check the long\r\nlist of provincial tribute and treasure, mountainous loads of baggage\r\nwhich had travelled with the Court from the start and under Her Majesty’s\r\nclose personal supervision. After the eunuch came the Emperor, evidently\r\nextremely nervous, who, at a sign from Her Majesty, hurried into his\r\nsedan-chair and was swiftly borne away, without a word or a sign of\r\nrecognition to any of the officials in attendance. After his departure,\r\nthe Empress came out and stood upon the platform at the end of her\r\ncarriage. “Quite a number of foreigners are here, I see,” she was heard\r\nto observe. She saluted them in accordance with the etiquette observed\r\nby Chinese women—bowing and raising her crossed hands. Prince Ch’ing\r\nthen advanced to greet Her Majesty, and with him Wang Wen-shao (who had\r\nsucceeded Li Hung-chang as Peace Plenipotentiary). They invited Her\r\nMajesty to enter her chair: “There is no hurry,” she replied. She stood\r\nfor some five minutes in full view of the crowd, talking energetically\r\nwith the bystanders, and looking extremely well and youthful for her age,\r\nuntil the chief eunuch returned and handed her the list of baggage and\r\ntreasure, which she scanned with close attention and then returned to him\r\nwith an expression of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAfter this, at the request of the Viceroy of Chihli (Yüan Shih-k’ai), the\r\nforeign manager and engineer of the railway were presented to her, and\r\nreceived her thanks for the satisfactory arrangements made throughout\r\nthe journey. She then entered her chair, a larger and finer conveyance\r\nthan that supplied to the Emperor, and was borne away towards the Palace;\r\nby her side ran one of her favourite eunuchs repeatedly calling Her\r\nMajesty’s attention to objects of interest. Whenever foreigners were in\r\nsight he would inform Her Majesty of the fact, and by one he was heard\r\ndistinctly to say: “Look! Old Buddha, look quickly at that foreign\r\ndevil,” whereupon the Empress smiled and bowed most affably. Passing\r\nthrough the Southern gate of the Chinese city, her bearers carried her\r\nstraight to the large enceinte of the Tartar city wall at the Ch’ienmen,\r\nwhere stands the shrine dedicated to the tutelary God of the Manchus.\r\nHere crowds of foreigners were in waiting on the wall. Looking down on\r\nthe courtyard towards the shrine, they saw the Old Buddha leave her\r\nchair and fall upon her knees to burn incense before the image of the\r\nGod of War, whilst several Taoist priests chanted the ritual. Rising she\r\nnext looked up towards the foreigners, smiling and bowing, before she\r\nwas carried away through the gate into the precincts of the Forbidden\r\nCity. No sooner had she reached the inner palace (the Ning Shou kung) at\r\nabout 2 P.M., than she commanded the eunuchs to commence digging up the\r\ntreasure which had been buried there at the time of her flight; she was\r\ngratified beyond measure to find that it had indeed remained untouched.\r\n\r\nNext, with an eye not only upon her future relations with foreigners\r\nbut also on public opinion throughout the Empire, she issued a Decree\r\nconferring posthumous honours on the “Pearl concubine,” who, as it will\r\nbe remembered, was thrown down a well by her orders on the morning of the\r\nCourt’s flight from the Palace. In this Decree Her Majesty praises the\r\nvirtue and admirable courage of the dead woman, which “led her virtuously\r\nto commit suicide when unable to catch up the Court on its departure,”\r\nunwilling as she was to witness the destruction and pollution of the\r\nancestral shrines. Her trustworthy conduct was therefore rewarded by\r\nthe granting of a posthumous title and by promotion of one step in rank\r\nin the Imperial harem. The Decree was generally regarded as fulfilling\r\nall reasonable requirements of atonement towards the deceased, for in\r\nChina the dead yet live and move in a shadowy, but none the less real,\r\nhierarchy. Alive, a “Pearl concubine” more or less counted for little\r\nwhen weighed against the needs of the Old Buddha’s policies; once dead,\r\nhowever, her spirit must needs be conciliated and compensated.\r\n\r\nMany Europeans who had witnessed the arrival of the Empress Dowager,\r\nremained at the railway station to see the unloading of her long baggage\r\ntrain, a most interesting and instructive sight. First were discharged\r\nthe yellow chairs of the young Empress and the Princess Imperial, and\r\nfour green chairs with yellow borders for the principal concubines;\r\nthe other ladies of the Court followed in official carts, two to each\r\nvehicle. There were about ninety of them altogether, and the arrangements\r\nfor their conveyance were accompanied by no little noise and confusion,\r\nthe loquacity of some of the elder ladies being most noticeable. After\r\ntheir departure the attention of the eunuchs and minor officials was\r\ndirected to the huge pile of the Empress Dowager’s personal baggage,\r\nwhich included her cooking utensils and household articles in daily\r\nuse. This operation, as well as the removal of a very large quantity of\r\nbullion, (every case of which was marked with the name of the province or\r\ncity that had sent it as tribute), was for a time superintended by the\r\nGrand Council. But as the work was enough to last for several hours, it\r\nwas not long before, led by Jung Lu, they entered their chairs and left\r\nfor the City. It was noticed that Jung Lu seemed very infirm, and was\r\nsupported as he walked by two attendants of almost gigantic stature.\r\n\r\nFrom Cheng-ting fu to Pao-ting fu, and thence to Peking, the Court\r\ntravelled, for the first time in its history, by train. The following\r\ndescription of the journey is reprinted, by kind permission of the editor\r\nof _The Times_, from an article published in that paper in March, 1902.\r\nIt shows an interesting side of the Empress Dowager’s character, that\r\nof the thrifty mistress of her goods and chattels, and gives a clear-cut\r\nimpression of that vigorous personality which devoted the same close\r\nattention to details of transport and domestic economy as to niceties of\r\nCourt ceremonial or historical precedents on vital questions of State;\r\ncharacteristics which inevitably suggest a marked resemblance between the\r\nOld Buddha and _le petit Caporal_.\r\n\r\n    “Early on December 31st the Court arrived at Cheng-ting fu,\r\n    escorted by a large body of cavalry and accompanied by an\r\n    enormous suite of officials, eunuchs and servants. The baggage\r\n    was carried by a train of carts, estimated by an eye-witness\r\n    at three thousand. The eunuchs numbered between three and four\r\n    hundred, and of cooks and other kitchen servants there were\r\n    almost as many. To provide accommodation for such a mass of\r\n    people was impossible, especially as all the best quarters\r\n    in the town had already been occupied by the high officials\r\n    who, with their retainers, had come from the north to welcome\r\n    the Empress Dowager on her return. For three days the Court\r\n    rested in Cheng-ting fu, during which time the scene was one\r\n    of indescribable confusion; baggage, stacked haphazard, filled\r\n    every available corner, eunuchs and servants camping around\r\n    and upon it, stolidly enduring much physical discomfort with\r\n    the apathy peculiar to Asiatics. Yet, so great was the cold\r\n    (on the night of January 1st the thermometer stood at two\r\n    degrees (Fahrenheit) below zero) that many of these wayfarers\r\n    gave way to lamentations and tears. Officials of the lower and\r\n    middle grades, unable to obtain a lodging, were compelled to\r\n    pass these days in such makeshift shelter as they could find\r\n    in the vicinity of the railway station, where swarmed a mob of\r\n    undisciplined soldiery. On the second night a fire broke out in\r\n    the stables of the Imperial residence, which, though eventually\r\n    checked before much damage was done, added greatly to the\r\n    general disorder, and might well have had serious results in\r\n    the absence of all organisation and control. The definite\r\n    announcement of the Court’s intention to leave for Pao-ting fu\r\n    on the 3rd of January was received with unmistakable relief by\r\n    the hungry, motley crowd which represented the pomp and pride\r\n    of Asia’s greatest Empire.\r\n\r\n    “From the Yellow River to the railway terminus at Cheng-ting\r\n    fu—a distance of about two hundred and fifty miles—the\r\n    ever-growing Imperial procession had travelled almost\r\n    continuously in chairs, litters, carts, and on horse-back,\r\n    affording a spectacle which recalled in many of its chief\r\n    characteristics those of Europe’s mediæval pageantry as\r\n    described by Scott. Every Manchu Prince had a retinue of\r\n    horsemen varying from thirty to a hundred in number; along the\r\n    frost-bound, uneven tracks which serve for roads in Northern\r\n    China, an unending stream of laden waggons creaked and groaned\r\n    through the short winter’s day, and on, guided by soldier\r\n    torch-bearers, through bitter nights to the appointed stopping\r\n    places. But for the Empress Dowager and the Emperor, with\r\n    the Chief Eunuch and the ladies of the Court, there was easy\r\n    journeying and a way literally made smooth. Throughout its\r\n    entire distance the road over which the Imperial palanquins\r\n    were borne had been converted into a smooth, even surface of\r\n    shining clay, soft and noiseless under foot; not only had every\r\n    stone been removed, but as the procession approached gangs of\r\n    men were employed in brushing the surface with feather brooms.\r\n    At intervals of about ten miles well-appointed rest-houses\r\n    had been built, where all manner of food was prepared. The\r\n    cost of this King’s highway, quite useless, of course, for\r\n    the ordinary traffic of the country, was stated by a native\r\n    contractor to amount roughly to fifty Mexican dollars for every\r\n    eight yards—say £1,000 a mile—the clay having to be carried in\r\n    some places from a great distance. As an example of the lavish\r\n    expenditure of the Court and its officials, in a land where\r\n    squalor is a pervading feature, this is typical.\r\n\r\n    “The hour for leaving Cheng-ting fu was fixed by the Empress\r\n    Dowager at 9.30 A.M. on January 3rd. It is significant of the\r\n    character of this remarkable woman, now in her sixty-seventh\r\n    year, that even in matters of detail she leaves nothing to\r\n    chance, nothing to others; the long arm of her unquestioned\r\n    authority reaches from the Throne literally to the servants’\r\n    quarters. Without creating any impression of fussiness,\r\n    she makes a distinctly feminine personality felt, and the\r\n    master-mind which has guided the destinies of China for the\r\n    last forty years by no means disdains to concern itself in\r\n    minor questions of household commissariat and transport. It is\r\n    impossible not to reflect what such a woman might have been,\r\n    what she might have done for her people, had there come into\r\n    her life some accident or influence to show her, in their true\r\n    light, the corruption, dishonesty, and cold-blooded cruelty of\r\n    her reign.\r\n\r\n    “The departure of the Court by a special train, long since\r\n    prepared for its reception by the Belgian railway authorities\r\n    and Sheng Hsüan-huai, was fixed for 9.30 A.M. in accordance\r\n    with Her Majesty’s orders; that Imperial and imperious lady,\r\n    however, made her appearance at the station at seven o’clock,\r\n    accompanied by the young Empress, the Imperial concubine,\r\n    and the ladies-in-waiting. The Emperor had preceded her, and\r\n    upon her arrival knelt on the platform to perform respectful\r\n    obeisance, in the presence of an interested crowd. The next\r\n    two hours were spent by the Empress, who showed no signs of\r\n    fatigue, in supervision of the arrangements for despatching\r\n    the vast accumulation of her personal baggage, and in holding\r\n    informal audiences with various high dignitaries, military\r\n    and civil, on the platform. Amongst others she sent for M.\r\n    Jadot, and spent some time in friendly conversation with him,\r\n    expressing great satisfaction at the excellent arrangements\r\n    made for her comfort, and pleasure at exchanging the sedan\r\n    chair for her luxuriously-appointed drawing-room car. She took\r\n    pains to impress upon the engineer-in-chief the importance\r\n    which she attached to keeping the Court’s baggage and effects\r\n    within reach, evincing on this subject much determination of a\r\n    good-humoured kind.\r\n\r\n    “Eventually, after the despatch of four freight trains, her\r\n    mind was relieved of this anxiety, but it was to be clearly\r\n    understood that the same personal supervision would be\r\n    exercised at Pao-ting fu, for in no circumstances could the\r\n    impedimenta be sent on in advance to Peking. There is a touch\r\n    of feminine nature in this incident which can hardly fail to\r\n    bring the Empress Dowager into some degree of kinship with\r\n    her fellow-women in other lands; there is also an implied\r\n    reflection on the honesty of persons in attendance on the Court\r\n    which is not without significance.\r\n\r\n    “The scene upon the platform was one of remarkable interest.\r\n    In utter subversion of all accepted ideas in regard to the\r\n    seclusion and privacy in which the Chinese Court is supposed to\r\n    live, move, and have its being, there was on this occasion—and\r\n    indeed throughout the journey—no sign of either attempt or\r\n    wish to guard Their Majesties from observation and intrusion.\r\n    The crowd, quietly inquisitive, but showing no inclination\r\n    to demonstration of any sort, came and went at its pleasure;\r\n    Yüan Shih-kai’s braves, who to the number of about a thousand\r\n    travelled to Peking as the Empress Dowager’s bodyguard,\r\n    crowded around the Imperial party, invading even their railway\r\n    carriages. While the ruler of the Empire held audience with\r\n    some of its highest officials, none of their retainers were\r\n    employed, as might have been expected, in keeping the people\r\n    at a respectful distance; the scene, in fact, bore striking\r\n    testimony to that democratic side of the Chinese character\r\n    which cannot but impress itself on every foreign visitor to\r\n    a Viceroy’s or magistrate’s yamên; in the present instance,\r\n    however, it must have been, for all concerned, a new and\r\n    remarkable experience.\r\n\r\n    “To the native spectators, the ladies of the Court with\r\n    their eunuch attendants were as much objects of interest\r\n    as the foreign railway officials; the Imperial concubine,\r\n    ‘Chin’ (or ‘Lustrous’) Kuei fei, a lively young person of\r\n    pleasing appearance, attracting much attention. This lady,\r\n    gaily clad and with lavishly painted face, bestowed upon\r\n    everything connected with the train an amount of attention\r\n    which augurs well for the future of railway enterprise in\r\n    China, running from car to car and chatting volubly with the\r\n    ladies-in-waiting. All the ladies of the Court wore pearls in\r\n    profusion—those of the Empress being particularly fine—and all\r\n    smoked cigarettes in place of the time-honoured water-pipe.\r\n    Herein again, for the optimistically inclined, may be found a\r\n    harbinger of progress. During the Empress Dowager’s audiences,\r\n    lasting sometimes over a quarter of an hour at a time, the\r\n    Emperor stood close at her side; invariably silent, generally\r\n    listless, though his expression when animated is described\r\n    as conveying an impression of remarkable intelligence. The\r\n    young Empress has good features, marred, in European eyes, by\r\n    excessive use of paint; she, too, appeared to be melancholy,\r\n    and showed but little interest in her surroundings. The Emperor\r\n    and both Empresses were simply dressed in quiet coloured silks.\r\n\r\n    “The special train in which, punctually at 9.30 A.M., the\r\n    rulers of China left for their capital consisted of a\r\n    locomotive and twenty-one carriages, arranged in the following\r\n    order:—Nine freight cars laden with servants, sedan chairs,\r\n    carts, mules, &c.; a guard’s van, for employés of the railway;\r\n    two first-class carriages (Imperial Princes); Emperor’s special\r\n    carriage; first-class carriage for high officials in attendance\r\n    (Jung Lu, Yüan Shih-k’ai, General Sung Ch’ing, Lu Ch’uan-lin,\r\n    Governor Ts’en of Shansi, Ministers of the Household,\r\n    and others); Empress Dowager’s special carriage; special\r\n    carriages of the young Empress and the Imperial concubine; two\r\n    second-class carriages, for eunuchs in attendance; first-class\r\n    carriage for the Chief Eunuch, and the ‘Service’ carriage of M.\r\n    Jadot.\r\n\r\n    “The special carriages had been prepared at great expense under\r\n    instructions issued by the Director-General of Railways, Sheng.\r\n    Those of the Empress Dowager, the Emperor, and his consort,\r\n    were luxuriously furnished with costly curios and upholstered\r\n    in Imperial yellow silk; each had its throne, divan, and\r\n    reception room. Heavy window curtains had been thoughtfully\r\n    provided in the carriages intended for the ladies’ use; they\r\n    were not required, however, as none of the party showed any\r\n    desire for privacy during the entire journey. While travelling,\r\n    the carriage of the Empress Dowager was the general rendezvous\r\n    of all the ladies, attended by their eunuchs, the Empress\r\n    Dowager spending much of the time in conversation with the\r\n    Chief Eunuch—of somewhat notorious character—and the Emperor.\r\n\r\n    “The Empress Dowager possesses in a marked degree a\r\n    characteristic frequently observed in masterful natures: she\r\n    is extremely superstitious. The soothsayers and astrologers\r\n    of the Court at Peking enjoy no sinecure; on the other hand,\r\n    more attention is paid to their advice than that which the\r\n    average memorialist obtains, and the position of necromancer\r\n    to the Throne is not unprofitable. On the present occasion\r\n    the sages-in-ordinary had fixed the auspicious hour for the\r\n    Sovereign’s return to Peking at 2 P.M. on January 7th; M. Jadot\r\n    was accordingly requested to make the necessary arrangements\r\n    to this end, and the Empress Dowager repeatedly impressed upon\r\n    him the importance which she attached to reaching the Yung-ting\r\n    gate of the city at that particular hour. To do this, as the\r\n    engineer-in-chief pointed out, would entail starting from\r\n    Pao-ting-fu at 7 A.M., but the determined ruler of China was\r\n    not to be put off by any such considerations. At 6 A.M. this\r\n    wonderful woman arrived at the station; it was freezing hard,\r\n    and the sand storm was raging violently; soldiers bearing\r\n    lanterns and torches led the way for the chair-bearers, since\r\n    the day had not yet dawned. The scene in all its details\r\n    appeals powerfully to the imagination. Once more the baggage\r\n    question monopolised the Empress Dowager’s attention; her last\r\n    freight train, laden with spoils of the southern provinces,\r\n    preceded the Imperial train by only twenty minutes. It will be\r\n    realised that the august lady’s requirements in the matter of\r\n    personal supervision of her property added responsibility of a\r\n    most serious kind to the cares—at no time light—of the railway\r\n    staff.\r\n\r\n    “An incident occurred at Pao-ting fu which throws a strong\r\n    side-light upon the Empress Dowager’s character. The high\r\n    Chinese officials above mentioned, who travelled in the\r\n    first-class carriage between the Emperor’s special car and\r\n    that of the Empress, finding themselves somewhat pressed for\r\n    space, consulted the railway officials and obtained another\r\n    first-class compartment, which was accordingly added to the\r\n    train. Her Majesty immediately noticing this, called for\r\n    explanations, which failed to meet with her approval. The\r\n    extra carriage was removed forthwith, Yüan Shih-k’ai and\r\n    his colleagues being reluctantly compelled to resume their\r\n    uncomfortably crowded quarters; to these Her Majesty paid\r\n    a visit of inspection before leaving the station, making\r\n    enquiries as to the travellers’ comfort, and expressing\r\n    complete satisfaction at the arrangements generally.\r\n\r\n    “At 11.30 A.M., punctual to the minute, the train arrived\r\n    at Feng-T’ai, where the Luhan line from Lu Ko-ch’iao meets\r\n    the Peking-Tien-tsin Railway; here the British authorities\r\n    took charge. The Empress Dowager was much reassured by the\r\n    excellence of the arrangements and the punctuality observed;\r\n    nevertheless, she continued to display anxiety as to the\r\n    hour of reaching Peking, frequently comparing her watch with\r\n    railway time. To M. Jadot, who took leave of Their Majesties\r\n    at Feng-T’ai, she expressed again the satisfaction she had\r\n    derived from this her first journey by rail, promising to renew\r\n    the experience before long and to be present at the official\r\n    opening of communication between Hankow and the capital. She\r\n    presented five thousand dollars for distribution among the\r\n    European and Chinese employés of the line, and decorated M.\r\n    Jadot with the order of the Double Dragon, Second Class.\r\n\r\n    “From Feng-T’ai the railway under British control runs directly\r\n    to the main south gate of the Tartar city (Ch’ienmen), but it\r\n    had been laid down by the soothsayers and astrologers aforesaid\r\n    that, for good augury, and to conform with tradition, the\r\n    Imperial party must descend at Machiapu and enter the Chinese\r\n    city by the direct road to the Palace through the Yung-ting\r\n    Men. At midday, therefore, leaving the railway, the Court\r\n    started in chairs for the city, in the midst of a pageant as\r\n    magnificent as the resources of Chinese officialdom permit.\r\n    The scene has been described by European writers as imposing,\r\n    but a Japanese correspondent refers to its _mise-en-scène_ as\r\n    suitable to a rustic theatre in his own country. Be this as it\r\n    may, the Empress Dowager, reverently welcomed by the Emperor,\r\n    who had preceded her, as usual, entered the city, from which\r\n    she had fled so ignominiously eighteen months before, at the\r\n    hour named by her spiritual advisers as propitious. Present\r\n    appearances at Peking, as well as the chastened tone of\r\n    Imperial Edicts, indicate that the wise men were right in their\r\n    choice.\r\n\r\n    “It may be added, in conclusion, as a sign of the times, that\r\n    the Empress Dowager’s sleeping compartment, prepared under the\r\n    direction of Sheng Hsüan-huai, was furnished with a European\r\n    bed. _Per contra_, it contained also materials for opium\r\n    smoking, of luxurious yet workmanlike appearance.”\r\n\r\nWithin a week or so of the Court’s return, the representatives of the\r\nforeign Powers were duly received in audience under the conditions named\r\nin the Peace Protocol. It was observed that the Old Buddha assumed, as\r\nof old, the highest seat on the Throne daïs, the Emperor occupying a\r\nlower and almost insignificant position. At the subsequent reception of\r\nthe Minister’s wives, in the Pavilion of Tranquil Longevity, the wife of\r\nthe Doyen of the Diplomatic Corps presented an address to “welcome Her\r\nImperial Majesty back to her beautiful Capital.” The document was most\r\ncordially, almost effusively, worded, and showed that the astute and\r\ncarefully pre-arranged measures taken by the Empress to conciliate the\r\nforeign Powers by adroit flattery and “allurements” had already attained\r\ntheir desired effect. Already the horrors of the siege, the insults and\r\nthe arrogance of 1900, were forgotten; already the representatives of the\r\nPowers were prepared, as of old, to vie with each other in attempts to\r\npurchase Chinese favour by working each against the other.\r\n\r\nIn receiving the address of the ladies of the Diplomatic Body, Her\r\nMajesty created a marked impression by the emotion with which she\r\nreferred to her affectionate regard for Europeans in general and her\r\nvisitors in particular. With every evidence of complete sincerity she\r\nexplained that a “Revolution in the Palace” had compelled her to flee\r\nfrom Peking; she deeply regretted the inconvenience and hardships to\r\nwhich her good friends of the Foreign Legations had been so unfortunately\r\nsubjected, and she hoped for a renewal of the old cordial relations.\r\nThe foreign ladies left the audience highly satisfied with the Empress\r\nDowager for her condescension, and with themselves at being placed in\r\na position to display such magnanimity. This audience was the first of\r\nmany similar occasions, and reference to the numerous works in which the\r\nsocial side of Her Majesty’s subsequent relations with Europeans have\r\nbeen described will show that the Old Buddha had not greatly erred when\r\nshe assured Jung Lu of the value of ancient classical methods in dealing\r\nwith barbarians, and promised him that all would readily be forgiven and\r\nforgotten in the tactful exercise of condescending courtesies.\r\n\r\nLife settled down then into the old grooves, and all went on as before\r\nin the Capital of China, the garrisons of the Allies soon becoming a\r\nfamiliar feature in the streets to which gradually the traders and\r\nsurviving Chinese residents returned. Once more began the farce of\r\nforeign intercourse with the so-called Government of the Celestial\r\nEmpire, and with it were immediately renewed all the intrigues and\r\ninternational jealousies which alone enable its rulers to maintain some\r\nsort of equilibrium in the midst of conflicting pressures.\r\n\r\nThe power behind the Throne, from this time until his death, was\r\nundoubtedly Jung Lu, but the Foreign Legations, still confused by\r\nmemories and echoes of the siege, and suspicious of all information which\r\ndid not conform to their expressed ideas of the causes of the Boxer\r\nRising, failed to realise the truth, and saw in him a suspect who should\r\nby rights have suffered punishment with his fellow conspirators. But the\r\nactual facts of the case, and his individual actions as recorded beyond\r\ndispute in the diary of His Excellency Ching Shan, and unmistakably\r\nconfirmed by other independent witnesses, were not then available in\r\nthe Chancelleries. Accordingly, when Jung Lu first paid his formal\r\nofficial calls upon the Foreign Ministers, he was anything but gratified\r\nat the reception accorded to him. In vain it was that he assured one\r\nmember of the Diplomatic body, with whom he had formerly been on fairly\r\ngood terms, that as Heaven was his witness he had done nothing in 1900\r\nexcept his utmost to defend and save the Legations; his statements were\r\nentirely disbelieved, and so greatly was he chagrined at the injustice\r\ndone him, that he begged the Empress Dowager in all seriousness to allow\r\nhim to retire from the Grand Council. But Tzŭ Hsi, fully realising the\r\nsituation, assured him of her complete confidence, and in a highly\r\nlaudatory decree refused his request:—\r\n\r\n    “The Grand Secretary, Jung Lu,” she said, “is a most patriotic\r\n    and loyal servant of the Throne, upon whose services we have\r\n    long and confidently relied. During the whole of the Boxer\r\n    Rebellion crisis it was he, and he alone, who calmly and\r\n    fearlessly held to the path of firmness, whilst all around\r\n    him was confusion and shouting, so that without doubt, he was\r\n    the means of saving the Empire. Most glorious indeed is his\r\n    merit. Although it may be said that the situation has now\r\n    been practically saved, we have by no means recovered from\r\n    the effects of this grievous national disaster, and there is\r\n    urgent necessity for the abolition of countless abuses and\r\n    the introduction of a programme of Reform. It is fitting that\r\n    all should assist us to this end. Whilst we ourselves, in the\r\n    seclusion of the Palace, labour unceasingly, how is it possible\r\n    that the Grand Secretary, who has received such high favour at\r\n    our hands, should even think of withdrawing from the stress\r\n    of public life, leaving to us incessant and harassing labour?\r\n    Would not his conscience drive him to remorse when reflecting\r\n    on the self-denying duties of every loyal Statesman in the\r\n    service of his Sovereign? His prayer is refused.”\r\n\r\nOn two subsequent occasions before her death, the populace and the\r\nforeign community in Peking were afforded opportunities of witnessing the\r\nEmpress Dowager’s return to the city from short excursions by railway,\r\nand on each of these her affable, almost familiar, attitude was a subject\r\nof general comment. The first occasion was in the following spring, when\r\nshe visited the Eastern Tombs, and upon her return, sacrificing as usual\r\nbefore the shrine of the God of War in the _enceinte_ of the Ch’ienmên,\r\nshe talked volubly with several of the ladies whom she had met at Court.\r\nAfter emerging from the Temple, she called upon one of the eunuchs to\r\nbring her opera glasses, with which she eagerly scanned the crowd looking\r\ndown from the wall of the city, waving her handkerchief whenever she\r\nperceived a familiar face. On one occasion she even shouted up an inquiry\r\nasking after the health of the daughter of one of the Foreign Ministers.\r\nThe Manchu Princes and Chamberlains of the Court were unable to conceal\r\ntheir indignation and wrath at such condescension on the part of the\r\nEmpress Dowager towards those whom, in spite of 1900, they still regarded\r\n(and regard to this day) as outer barbarians. So much incensed were they\r\nthat they even urged Chi Lu to beg Her Majesty to desist, and to re-enter\r\nher chair, an invitation to which she paid not the slightest attention,\r\nbeing evidently well pleased at the violation of ceremonial etiquette\r\nwhich she was committing. It was noticed that the Emperor, on the other\r\nhand, took no notice whatsoever of the foreigners, and seemed to be sunk\r\nin a deep, listless melancholy.\r\n\r\nThe second occasion was after the Empress Dowager’s visit to the Western\r\nTombs in April, 1903, four days after the death of her faithful friend\r\nand adviser, Jung Lu. On this occasion Her Majesty appeared to be in\r\nvery low spirits, descending from the train slowly, and with none of her\r\nwonted vivacity. She greeted Kuei Hsiang, her brother, who was kneeling\r\non the platform to receive her, with one curt sentence, “You have killed\r\nJung Lu by recommending that useless doctor,” and passed on to her chair\r\nwithout another word. It was on this occasion, receiving certain foreign\r\nladies in the travelling Palace erected for her at Pao-ting fu, that the\r\nOld Buddha alluded directly to the massacres of foreign missionaries\r\nwhich had taken place in that city, “with which she had, of course,\r\nnothing to do.” No doubt by this time, and by force of repetition, Tzŭ\r\nHsi had persuaded herself of her complete innocence; but however this may\r\nbe, she undoubtedly won over most of the foreigners with whom she came in\r\ncontact, by the charm and apparent sincerity of her manner.\r\n\r\nBefore settling down to the accustomed routine of life in the Palace, the\r\nEmpress Dowager, whose _penchant_ for personal explanation in Imperial\r\nEdicts seemed to be growing upon her, issued a Decree which gained for\r\nher renewed sympathy from all classes of Chinese officials. After the\r\nusual exhortations to her faithful subjects to co-operate loyally in\r\nher schemes for Reform, to put off the old bad ways and to persist\r\nenergetically in well-doing, she gives a graphic description of the\r\nhardships which she and the Emperor endured during her compulsory “tour\r\nto the West.” After referring to the unforgettable shocks and sorrows of\r\nthat journey, the Edict says:—\r\n\r\n    “I have now returned once more to my Palace and find the\r\n    ancestral Temples reposing as of old in dignified and unbroken\r\n    serenity. Beneath the deep awe which overcomes me in the\r\n    presence of my glorious ancestors my soul feels an added\r\n    weight of grief and remorse, and I only hope that by Heaven’s\r\n    continued favour I may yet live to accomplish some meritorious\r\n    work.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, in a later passage, after referring to the drought which had\r\nbrought Shensi and Shansi to the verge of famine, she says:—\r\n\r\n    “The Empire has come upon days of dire financial distress,\r\n    and my people have been compelled to find funds for me from\r\n    their very life blood; ill would it be for me to requite\r\n    their loyalty by further levies of taxation, and the Throne\r\n    is therefore bound to curtail its ordinary expenditure and to\r\n    make strict economy its guiding rule for the future. With the\r\n    exception of such repairs as are necessary to the Temples and\r\n    ancestral shrines, I hereby command that no expenditure be\r\n    incurred for repairs or decoration of the Palaces, except in\r\n    cases of absolute necessity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nHER MAJESTY’S NEW POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crisis of 1900, all the horror of that abomination of desolation in\r\nher Capital and the hardships of her wandering in the wilderness, had\r\nbrought home to the Empress the inherent weakness of her country and\r\nthe stern necessity for remedial measures. Already, before the issue of\r\nthe penitential Decree, quoted in an earlier chapter, she had announced\r\nto the world, with characteristic decision, her intention to adopt new\r\nmeasures and to break with those hoary traditions of the past which, as\r\nshe had learned, were the first cause of the rottenness of the State.\r\nHer subsequent policy became in fact (though she was careful never to\r\nadmit it) a justification of those very measures which the Emperor had\r\nso enthusiastically inaugurated in 1898, but her methods differed from\r\nhis in that she omitted no precaution for conciliating the conflicting\r\ninterests about the Throne and for disarming the opposition of the\r\n_intransigeants_ of the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation of Her Majesty’s conversion to new ideals of\r\nGovernment was given to the world in an Edict issued at Hsi-an on the\r\n28th January, 1901, in the name of the Emperor. This document, drafted\r\nwith the assistance of Jung Lu, is a remarkable example of Tzŭ Hsi’s\r\nmasculine intelligence and statecraft, though somewhat marred by those\r\nlong-winded repetitions in which Chinese Edicts abound. It was received\r\nwith enthusiastic delight by the _literati_ throughout the Empire, even\r\nin Canton and the southern provinces, where, at the moment, Her Majesty\r\nwas not personally popular. The vernacular Press claimed it as the most\r\nstriking Edict in Chinese history. It combined an eloquent appeal to\r\nthe people to accept the principle of reform together with a masterful\r\njustification of China and her people _vis-à-vis_ the outside world.\r\nIt was most skilfully worded so as to placate all parties in the State\r\nand thus to enhance the reputation of the Old Buddha. The “Young China”\r\nparty was particularly enthusiastic, for by this Decree Her Majesty\r\ndefinitely abandoned the principle of absolute autocracy which had been\r\nfor centuries the corner-stone of the Chinese system of government. It\r\nwas realised that so complete a departure from the traditions of the\r\nManchu Dynasty, of the Imperial Clan and of all her previous convictions,\r\ncould not have been attained but for the bitter lessons of 1900, and,\r\nadmiration was therefore the more keen for the skill and courage with\r\nwhich, on the verge of old age, she resumed the burden of government in\r\nher ravaged capital. It was the ruling passion bravely asserted, and\r\nthe sympathy of the nation could hardly be withheld from a ruler who\r\nthus bore her share in the national humiliation, who so frankly accepted\r\nresponsibility for past errors and promised new and better methods for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, inevitable, in the light of all experience, that many\r\nof her subjects, as well as most foreigners, should doubt her sincerity,\r\nand should regard this Edict, like many others, as a case of “when the\r\ndevil was sick.” But gradually, after the return of the Court, as it\r\nbecame clear to her immediate retainers and high officials that this\r\nself-confident woman was really in earnest, and as she continued steadily\r\nto impress her new policy upon the reluctant Clansmen, her popularity\r\nwith the people at large, and especially in the south (where it had been\r\nmuch damaged by her fierce suppression of the Cantonese reformers of\r\n1898), was gradually restored. From this time forward to the end of her\r\nlife, whatever may have been the good or bad faith of her advisers and\r\nchief officials, every act of her career is stamped with unmistakable\r\nsigns of her sincerity in the cause of reform, borne out by her recorded\r\nwords and deeds.\r\n\r\nFrom the Boxer movement she had learned at a bitter cost the lesson\r\nshe was now putting into practice, but for all that she remained to\r\nthe end faithful in her affection for the memory of the Boxer leaders;\r\nto the last she never failed to praise their loyalty to her person and\r\nthe patriotic bravery of their attempt to expel the foreigner. But she\r\nhad been compelled to learn in the hard school of experience the utter\r\nhopelessness of that attempt, and she was forced to the conclusion that,\r\nfor the future, and until China should be strong enough, all anti-foreign\r\nproceedings must be suppressed.\r\n\r\nUnflinchingly, therefore, she announced to her people a change of front\r\nunparalleled in the history of China. Certain it is (as was fully proved\r\nin the case of the Emperor in 1898) that no other ruler of the Dynasty\r\ncould have proclaimed such drastic changes without causing serious\r\ndissensions and possibly civil war. But so masterly were her methods of\r\ndealing with the necessities of the situation, and so forcibly did the\r\nstyle and arguments of her Decrees appeal to the _literati_, that they\r\ncarried very general conviction. Even the most bigoted Confucianists were\r\nwon by her subtle suggestions as to what would have been the attitude of\r\nthe Sage himself if confronted by such problems as the nation had now to\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe text of the Decree recording her conversion is interesting:—\r\n\r\n    “Throughout the entire universe there exist certain fixed\r\n    principles which govern the conduct of men, but nowhere do we\r\n    find any finally fixed form of government. It is written in\r\n    the Book of Changes[122] that when any given condition of\r\n    affairs has run its natural course, and has been succeeded by\r\n    another, there is no saying how long this new state may last;\r\n    also in the Dialogues of Confucius it is written, that there\r\n    is no difficulty in tracing the changes and reforms which each\r\n    Dynasty has made in regard to the methods of its predecessors.\r\n    Certain things remain ever unchanged, namely, the three\r\n    fundamental bonds, between Sovereign and subject, father and\r\n    son, husband and wife; also the five great moral obligations.\r\n    These vary not, but are all as the sun and moon, enlightening\r\n    the world. But in other matters there should be no fixed\r\n    objection to change, no hide-bound finality of ideas; to obtain\r\n    music from a lute or guitar one must touch all the strings.\r\n    Each Dynasty in turn, since the beginning of time, has seen fit\r\n    to introduce changes and has abolished certain customs of its\r\n    predecessors; our own ancestors have set us many an example in\r\n    modifying their conduct to meet the exigencies of their day.\r\n    The system which prevailed at the date when first the Manchus\r\n    captured Peking was very different from that in vogue when\r\n    Moukden was the capital of our Empire.\r\n\r\n    “Looking at the matter broadly, we may observe that any system\r\n    which has lasted too long is in danger of becoming stereotyped,\r\n    and things that are obsolete should be modified. The essential\r\n    need which confronts us is at all costs to strengthen our\r\n    Empire and to improve the condition of our subjects. Ever\r\n    since our journey to the West the Empress Dowager has been\r\n    over-burdened with the labours and cares of the State.[123]\r\n\r\n    “Bitterly have we reproached ourselves with the thought that\r\n    for the past twenty years abuses have steadily been increasing,\r\n    while means of suppressing them have been continually put off\r\n    until, at last, the state of our country has become parlous\r\n    indeed. At this moment, when peace negotiations are proceeding,\r\n    it is a matter of urgent necessity that steps be taken to\r\n    reorganise our system of government so that hereafter our\r\n    Celestial Empire may recover its ancient place of wealth and\r\n    power. The Empress Dowager has now decided that we should\r\n    correct our shortcomings by adopting the best methods and\r\n    systems which obtain in foreign countries, basing our future\r\n    conduct upon a wise recognition of past errors.\r\n\r\n    “Ever since the 23rd and 24th years of Kuang Hsü (1897\r\n    and 1898) there has been no lack of plans for reform, and\r\n    suggestions of administrative change, but they have all been\r\n    marked by vagueness and foolish looseness of thought. The\r\n    crisis which was brought about in 1898 by the arch-traitor\r\n    K’ang Yu-wei was in its possible consequences even more\r\n    dangerous than the evil which has since been brought about\r\n    by the unholy arts of the Boxers. To this day Kang and his\r\n    associates continue to preach treason and to disturb the public\r\n    mind by means of their writings from overseas. The object of\r\n    their writings is simply anarchy, nor do they scruple to use\r\n    catchwords which, while apparently appealing to the patriotism\r\n    of our people, are really intended to create dissension. Thus\r\n    they talk of the “defence of the Empire” and the “protection\r\n    of the Chinese race,” and many of their dupes fail to realise\r\n    that their main object is not reform, but a revolution against\r\n    the Manchu Dynasty, and that they hope to create ill-feeling\r\n    between the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. With treacherous\r\n    cunning those conspirators took advantage of our weak state of\r\n    health, and we were therefore glad when at our urgent request\r\n    Her Majesty the Empress Dowager resumed the Regency. With\r\n    amazing rapidity she grasped all the needs of the situation and\r\n    delivered us from imminent peril, visiting swift punishment\r\n    upon those traitors. But, whilst ridding the State of these\r\n    evil-doers it was never Her Majesty’s wish or intention\r\n    to block reform measures, whilst we, on our side, though\r\n    recognising the necessity for change in certain directions,\r\n    were never guilty of any desire to abolish all the ancient ways\r\n    of our ancestors. Our loyal subjects must recognise that it has\r\n    been Her Majesty’s invariable wish, and our own, to follow the\r\n    happy mean, we, as mother and son, being in complete accord, to\r\n    steer a wise middle course between conflicting policies.\r\n\r\n    “We have to-day received Her Majesty’s orders, and learn that\r\n    she is now thoroughly bent on radical reform. Nevertheless,\r\n    whilst we are convinced of the necessity of blending in\r\n    one harmonious form of administration the best customs and\r\n    traditions of Chinese and European Governments, there is to\r\n    be no talk of reaction or revolution. The chief defect in our\r\n    system of administration is undoubtedly too close an adherence\r\n    to obsolete methods, a too slavish devotion to the written\r\n    word; the result is a surfeit of commonplace and inefficient\r\n    officials, and a deplorable lack of men of real talent. The\r\n    average commonplace man makes a god of the written word,\r\n    whilst every bureaucrat in the land regards it as a talisman\r\n    wherewith to fill his purse, so that we have huge mountains\r\n    of correspondence eternally growing up between one government\r\n    office and another, the value of which is absolutely _nil_\r\n    so far as any good to the country is concerned. On the other\r\n    hand men of real ability lose heart and give up the public\r\n    service in disgust, prevented from coming to the front by the\r\n    mass of inefficiency that blocks the way. Our whole system of\r\n    government has come to grief through corruption, and the first\r\n    steps of progress in our Empire are clogged by the fatal word\r\n    ‘Precedent.’\r\n\r\n    “Up to the present the study of European methods has gone\r\n    no further than a superficial knowledge of the languages,\r\n    literature and mechanical arts of the West, but it must be\r\n    evident that these things are not the essentials upon which\r\n    European civilisation has been founded. The essential spirit\r\n    of that civilisation is to be looked for in the fact that\r\n    real sympathy and understanding exists between rulers and\r\n    people, that officials are required to be truthful in word\r\n    and courageous in action. The teachings handed down to us by\r\n    our sacred ancestors are really the same as those upon which\r\n    the wealth and power of European countries have been based,\r\n    but China has hitherto failed to realise this and has been\r\n    content to acquire the rudiments of European languages or\r\n    technicalities, while changing nothing of her ancient habits\r\n    of inefficiency and deep-rooted corruption. Ignoring our real\r\n    needs we have so far taken from Europe nothing but externals;\r\n    how can we possibly hope to advance on such lines? Any reforms\r\n    to be effective and permanent must be made with a real desire\r\n    for efficiency and honesty.\r\n\r\n    “We therefore hereby decree and command that the officials\r\n    concerned shall now make close enquiry and comparison as\r\n    to the various systems of government in force in European\r\n    countries with special reference to those which obtain in China\r\n    to-day, not only as regards the constitution of the Court and\r\n    central government, but also concerning those things which\r\n    make for the prosperity of our subjects, such as the system of\r\n    examinations and education, the administration of the army and\r\n    the regulation of finance. They will be required to report as\r\n    to what changes are advisable and what institutions should be\r\n    abolished; what methods we should adopt from abroad and what\r\n    existing Chinese institutions should be retained. The things we\r\n    chiefly need are a constant supply of men of talent, a sound\r\n    basis of national finance, and an efficient army. Reports on\r\n    these matters must be forwarded within two months, and upon\r\n    them we shall humbly address Her Majesty, and ask for her\r\n    decision before we take any definite action.\r\n\r\n    “Whilst the Court was in residence at T’ai-yüan we urgently\r\n    called upon our subjects to assist us, and many Memorials were\r\n    received, but as a general rule the advice they tendered was\r\n    either stupid plagiarism taken from newspaper articles or else\r\n    the narrow and bigoted views of untravelled scholars. They\r\n    frequently sounded quite reasonable, but were in reality sheer\r\n    nonsense, their principal characteristic being overweening\r\n    conceit, which effectively prevented any breadth of argument.\r\n    Very few of the suggestions advanced were practicable, for\r\n    the reason that in recommending any course of action writers\r\n    laid stress upon its alleged advantages without realising its\r\n    drawbacks. There are many who talk glibly of reform and the\r\n    wealth and power of foreign States, but deceive themselves\r\n    as to the real origin of all knowledge; on the other hand\r\n    your bigoted Confucianist will discourse endlessly upon the\r\n    doctrines of the Sages, without in the least realising the\r\n    needs of the present day. It is now for you, our officials, to\r\n    steer a reasonable midway course, avoiding both these defects\r\n    in submitting your proposals. We desire that your views shall\r\n    be elaborated in the fullest detail for our consideration in\r\n    determining upon a course of action.\r\n\r\n    “The first essential, however, more important even than the\r\n    devising of new systems, is to secure men of administrative\r\n    ability. Without talent no system can be made to succeed. If\r\n    the letter of our projected reforms be not illuminated and\r\n    guided by this spirit of efficiency in our officials then must\r\n    all our hopes of reforming the State disappear into the limbo\r\n    of lost ideals. We fully recognise that foolish adherence\r\n    to the system of promotion by seniority has been one of the\r\n    main factors in bringing about a condition of affairs that\r\n    is almost incurable. If we would now be rid of it, our first\r\n    step evidently is to think no more of selfish interests, but\r\n    to consider the commonwealth only and to secure efficiency\r\n    by some new and definite method, so that competent persons\r\n    only may be in charge of public affairs. But if you, our\r\n    officials, continue to cling to your ancient ways, following\r\n    the ruts of procrastination and slothful ease; should you\r\n    persist in evading responsibility, serving the State with empty\r\n    catch-words while you batten on the fruits of your misdeeds,\r\n    assuredly the punishment which the law provides stands ready,\r\n    and no mercy will be shown you! Let this Decree be promulgated\r\n    throughout the land.”\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in this Decree the Emperor is made to renounce\r\nand condemn the Reformers of 1898 and all their works. This, however\r\nsincerely convinced Her Majesty might be of the necessity for remedial\r\nmeasures, was only natural. For it was never one of the weaknesses of\r\nthis masterful woman to make direct confession of error for the benefit\r\nof her own immediate entourage; not thus is prestige maintained in the\r\natmosphere of an Oriental Court. She was now prepared to adopt many of\r\nthe reforms which K’ang Yu-wei and his friends had advocated, but for\r\nall-important purposes of “face” it must be made quite clear that, in\r\nher hands, they were something radically different and superior. In\r\npromulgating her new opinions she could not afford to say anything which\r\nmight be construed as direct justification of that reform movement which\r\nshe herself had so ruthlessly suppressed. And so the “stupid people”\r\nmust clearly understand that her present programme was by no means\r\n“revolutionary” like that of K’ang Yu-wei and his fellow-“conspirators.”\r\nNevertheless, her proposals for reform went as far as theirs, and, in\r\nsome cases, even further, the only real difference being that in this\r\ncase she, the Old Buddha, was a prime mover, where before she had been an\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nLooking back on the six years of her life and rule which followed the\r\nreturn from exile, there can be but little doubt of the sincerity of her\r\nconversion to reform, although there is no reason to believe that her\r\nsentiments towards foreigners had undergone any change for the better.\r\nThe lesson which had been brought home to her with crushing force in the\r\nrise and fall of the Boxer movement and in the capture of Peking, was\r\nthat national inefficiency means national extinction, a lesson which not\r\nall the statesmen of western lands have fully learned. She had realised\r\nthat the material forces of the western world were not to be met and\r\noverthrown by quotations from the classics, and that, if China was to\r\ncontinue to exist as an independent State she must follow the example of\r\nJapan and put her house in order with equipment and defences adapted from\r\nwestern models. And with Tzŭ Hsi to realise was to act, a quality which,\r\nmore than all others, distinguished her from the ruck of her Manchu\r\nkinsmen and officials, sunk in their lethargic fatalism and helplessness.\r\n\r\nThe situation which confronted her at the outset was anything but simple.\r\nApart from the time-honoured privileges of the Imperial clans, whose\r\narrogant ignorance she had come to appreciate at its proper value, she\r\nmust needs be cautious in handling the susceptibilities of the provincial\r\ngentry and _literati_, the backbone of China’s collective intelligence.\r\nAt the same time, as far as the foreign Powers were concerned, she must\r\nbe careful to preserve to the full that dignity on which her prestige\r\nwith her own people depended, that “_l’empire c’est moi_” attitude which\r\nhad been rudely shaken by the events of 1900. Not as the chastened\r\npenitent would she appear in their eyes, but as the innocent and injured\r\nvictim of circumstances beyond her control. There were, in fact, several\r\ndistinct rôles to be played, and none of them were easy.\r\n\r\nThe Edict issued from Hsi-an in February 1901 had been warmly applauded\r\nby scholars throughout the Empire as a literary feat of the first order,\r\nbut most of the provincial officials (justified by all tradition and\r\nexperience) regarded it as merely a classical “obiter dictum,” and\r\nproceeded, therefore, in their old way, certain in their minds that the\r\nOld Buddha was only amusing herself, as was her wont, by throwing dust in\r\nthe eyes of the barbarian, and that she would not be displeased if her\r\nlieutenants were to proceed slowly in carrying them into effect. Unto\r\nthe end, even in the face of the earnest exhortations of her valedictory\r\nDecree, there were many provincial officials who, for reasons of personal\r\nprejudice and self-interest, professed to believe that the Old Buddha had\r\nbeen merely playing a part, but we can find nothing in her official or\r\nprivate record during these six years to justify that belief. Just before\r\nher return to Peking she issued an Edict in which her own convictions\r\nwere very clearly indicated:—\r\n\r\n    “Ever since my sudden departure from the capital a year ago,”\r\n    she declared, “I have not ceased for a moment to brood over the\r\n    causes of our national misfortunes and to feel deep remorse.\r\n    Now, thanks to the protection of our tutelary deities, I am\r\n    about to return to the capital. Whenever I think of the reasons\r\n    for our undoing and the causes of our collective weakness I\r\n    sincerely deplore the fact that I have not long ago introduced\r\n    the necessary reforms, but I am now fully determined to put\r\n    in force all possible measures for the reform of the State.\r\n    Abandoning our former prejudices, we must proceed to adopt the\r\n    best European methods of government. I am firmly determined to\r\n    work henceforward on practical lines, so as to deliver the\r\n    Empire from its present rotten state. Some of the necessary\r\n    measures will naturally require longer periods of preparation\r\n    than others, but after my return to Peking they must one and\r\n    all gradually be introduced.\r\n\r\n    “In view of the urgent importance of this matter, Jung Lu and\r\n    his colleagues have urged me to make a clear statement of my\r\n    intentions and to declare without possibility of hesitation\r\n    or doubt the irrevocable decision of the Throne, so that\r\n    every official in the land may be stimulated to sincere and\r\n    unremitting co-operation. For this reason I issue the present\r\n    Decree solemnly recording my opinion that the condition of the\r\n    Empire permits of no further evasion or delay in the matter\r\n    of reform. Therein lies our only hope for the future. Myself\r\n    and the Emperor, in the interests of all that we hold dear,\r\n    have no alternative but to face, and steadily to pursue, this\r\n    new policy; we must make up our minds what are the things to\r\n    strive for, and employ the right men to help us to attain them.\r\n    We are, as mother and son, of one mind, endeavouring only to\r\n    restore our fallen fortunes. You, our people, can best serve by\r\n    united efforts to this end.”\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi had not only realised the immense superiority of the material\r\nforces of the western world, but she had also been convinced of the\r\nimmense intellectual and political forces which education and increased\r\nmeans of communication were steadily creating amongst her own subjects,\r\nforces with which, as she perceived, the effete and ignorant Manchus\r\nwould have to reckon sooner or later. It is quite plain from her Edicts\r\non this delicate subject that she realised clearly the dangers which\r\nthreatened the Manchu rule. She saw that their class privileges, the\r\nright to tribute, and all the other benefits of sovereignty which the\r\nfounders of the Dynasty had won by force of arms and opportunity, had now\r\nbecome an anachronism, and must in the near future involve the Manchus\r\nthemselves in serious dangers and difficulties, unless, by fusion, means\r\ncould be found to avert them. Among the rules laid down by the founders\r\nof the Dynasty for the maintenance of the pure Manchu stock, was that\r\nwhich forbade intermarriage with Chinese. This law, though frequently\r\nviolated in the garrisons of the south, had remained generally effective\r\nwithin the Metropolitan province, where it had served its purpose of\r\nmaintaining the ruling class and its caste. But the Empress had now come\r\nto understand that if China was to be preserved as a sovereign State,\r\nit must be rather by means of Chinese energy and intelligence grafted\r\non to the Manchu stock, than by the latter’s separate initiative. In\r\nJanuary 1902, immediately after her return to Peking, she gave effect\r\nto her convictions on this subject in a remarkable Decree whereby she\r\nrecommended that, for the future, Manchus and Chinese should intermarry.\r\n“At the time of the founding of our Dynasty,” she says, “the customs\r\nand languages of the two races were greatly different, and this was\r\nin itself reason sufficient for prohibiting intermarriage. But at the\r\npresent day, little or no difference exists between them, and the time\r\nhas come, therefore, to relax this law for the benefit of the Empire as\r\na whole, and in accordance with the wishes of our people.” In the same\r\nEdict Her Majesty deprecated the Chinese custom, which the Manchus had\r\nnever adopted, of foot-binding, and urged that the educated classes\r\nshould unite to oppose a custom so injurious to health and inhuman in\r\npractice. There was, however, to be no compulsion in this matter. In one\r\nrespect only did she desire to adhere to the exclusive Manchu traditions,\r\nnamely, as regards the selection of secondary wives for the Imperial\r\nharem, who must continue to be chosen exclusively from Manchu families;\r\nshe did not desire “to incur any risk of confusion or dissension in the\r\nPalace, nor to fall into the error committed by the Ming Dynasty, in the\r\nindiscriminate selection of concubines, a matter affecting the direct and\r\nlegitimate succession to the Throne.” Nor would she expose her kinsmen\r\nto the risk of conspiracy against the Dynasty which would certainly\r\noccur if the daughters of the great Chinese houses were admitted to the\r\nPalace. The law had been laid down once and for all by Nurhachu, and it\r\nwas binding on every occupant of the Dragon Throne, namely, “no Manchu\r\neunuchs, no Chinese concubines.”\r\n\r\nHer next step, in a decree which frankly deplored the hopeless ignorance\r\nof her kinsmen, was to authorise the Imperial clansmen and nobles to send\r\ntheir sons to be educated abroad, so that perchance the lump of their\r\ninefficiency might yet be leavened. Eligible youths, between the ages of\r\nfifteen and twenty-five, and of good physique, were to be selected and\r\ntheir expenses would be defrayed by the Government.\r\n\r\nThis much for the Manchus; but in regard to the whole question of\r\neducation, which she declared to be the very root of all China’s\r\ndifficulties, she perceived, after prolonged consultations with Yüan\r\nShih-k’ai and Chang Chih-tung, that so long as the classical system\r\ncontinued, with its strong hold of tradition upon the masses, it must\r\nconstitute the chief obstacle to any effective reform of the body\r\npolitic. After much careful deliberation she decided that unless the\r\nwhole system of classical examinations were abolished, root and branch,\r\nno tinkering with western learning could be of any practical use. The\r\nancient system of arguing in a circle, which for over two centuries had\r\ncharacterised the ideal essay and hypnotised the ideal official, must\r\nundoubtedly triumph over all other educational methods, so long as it\r\nremained part of the official curriculum. Her Majesty took pains to point\r\nout by Edict that colleges had undoubtedly existed in the days of that\r\nmodel ruler, the Regent Duke Chou, more than two thousand five hundred\r\nyears ago, on lines not greatly different from those of the foreign\r\nUniversities of the present day; she proved also that the classical\r\nessay system was, so to speak, quite a recent innovation, having been\r\nintroduced for the first time under the Ming Dynasty, about A.D. 1390.\r\nEventually, in 1904, upon the advice of Yüan Shih-k’ai, approved by\r\nChang Chih-tung, a Decree was issued finally abolishing the old system\r\nof examinations and making graduation at one of the modern colleges the\r\nonly recognised path to official employment. At the same time, realising\r\nthat the training of students in Japan, which had been proceeding on\r\na very large scale, had produced a body of revolutionary scholars\r\nmost undesirable in the eyes of the Government, she gave orders that\r\narrangements should be made for sending more students in future to Europe\r\nand America.\r\n\r\nThis epoch-making announcement was followed by several other important\r\nDecrees, notably that which ordered the complete abolition of the opium\r\ntraffic within a period of ten years, a Decree, which, embodying a\r\nsincere and powerful consensus of public opinion, has produced most\r\nunexpected results, marvellously creditable to the moral sense and\r\nrecuperative energies of the Chinese race. The contrast is most striking\r\nbetween the widespread reform effected under this Edict, and the almost\r\ncomplete failure of those which set forth to reform the Metropolitan\r\nadministration; these, thanks to the steady passive resistance of the\r\nmandarin in possession, resulted merely in perpetuating the old abuses\r\nunder new names. The one new Ministry created at that time, and saluted\r\nby foreigners as a sign of genuine progress, was that of Posts and\r\nCommunications (Yu-Ch’uan pu), which has been a byword for corrupt\r\npractices since its establishment, and a laughing stock among the Chinese\r\nthemselves for inefficiency and extravagance.\r\n\r\nAfter dealing with education, the Old Buddha turned her attention to a\r\nquestion which had frequently figured in recent Memorials of progressive\r\nofficials, namely, the abolition of torture and other abuses prevalent\r\nin the so-called judicial system of the Empire. She realised that if\r\nChina were ever to obtain the consent of the western Powers to the\r\nabolition of the foreigner’s rights of extra-territoriality, she must\r\ndevise and enforce civil and criminal codes similar to those of civilised\r\ncountries. Her Edict on this subject, though in form excellent, seems\r\nto lack something of the conviction which marks her other Decrees of\r\nthis period; it is very different, for instance, from those dealing with\r\nthe abolition of opium and the reform of education. Its principles were\r\nobviously contrary to all her previous ideas and practice, and it is only\r\nfair to say that its result, in spite of much drafting of codes, has\r\nbeen little or none, as far as the barbarous practices of the provincial\r\nYamêns are concerned. She decreed that, pending the introduction of the\r\ncriminal code, decapitation should be the extreme penalty of the law;\r\ndismemberment and mutilation were to be abolished as barbarous; branding,\r\nflogging, and the vicarious punishment of relatives were to cease. These\r\nsavage penalties, she observed, were originally introduced into China\r\nunder the Ming Dynasty, and had only been adopted by the Manchus, with\r\nother Chinese customs, against their own more merciful instincts.\r\n\r\nFinally, in deference to the unmistakable and growing tendencies of\r\npublic opinion in the south, Tzŭ Hsi took the first steps towards\r\nthe introduction of constitutional government by sending an Imperial\r\nCommission (under Duke Tsai Tsê) to study the various systems in force\r\nin foreign countries, and their results. The return of this Mission was\r\nfollowed in the autumn of 1905 by the issue of the famous Decree in which\r\nshe definitely announced her intention to grant a constitution, which\r\nshould come into effect sooner or later, according to circumstances and\r\nthe amount of energy or procrastination displayed by the officials and\r\npeople in preparing themselves for the change. As an example of subtle\r\nargument calculated to appeal to the Chinese mind, the document is a\r\nmasterpiece in its way. It says:—\r\n\r\n    “Ever since the foundation of the Dynasty one wise sovereign\r\n    after another has handed down sage counsels to posterity;\r\n    it has always been their guiding principle that methods\r\n    of Government should be modified and adapted to meet the\r\n    exigencies of the moment and changing conditions. China’s\r\n    great and increasing danger to-day is largely due to her\r\n    unwise adherence to antiquated methods; if we do not amend\r\n    our educational and political systems, we shall be violating\r\n    the spirit which animated our Imperial ancestors, and shall\r\n    disappoint the best hopes of our people. Our Imperial\r\n    Commissioners have reported to us that the prosperity and\r\n    power of foreign nations are largely due to principles of\r\n    constitutional government based on the will of the people,\r\n    which assures bonds of union and sympathy between the Sovereign\r\n    and his subjects. It is therefore our duty to consider by what\r\n    means such a Constitution may be granted as shall retain the\r\n    sovereign power in the hands of the Throne, and at the same\r\n    time give effect to the wishes of the people in matters of\r\n    administration. Our State being at present unprepared, and our\r\n    people uneducated, any undue haste is inadvisable, and would\r\n    lead to no practical results. We must first reform the official\r\n    system, following this by the introduction of new laws, new\r\n    methods of education, finance and military organisations,\r\n    together with a police system, so that officials and people may\r\n    come to realise what executive government means as a foundation\r\n    and preparation for the granting of a Constitution.”\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that even Tzŭ Hsi could frame so radical and\r\ncomprehensive a programme of change without incurring the strongest\r\nopposition and criticism of those to whom the established order meant\r\nloaves and fishes: at Peking, however, owing to the absence of an\r\noutspoken press, the opposition ran beneath the surface, exercised in\r\nthe time-honoured form of dogged adherence to the ancient methods by\r\nthe officials and bureaucrats on whose goodwill all reform ultimately\r\ndepends. Against anyone less masterful and less popular than Tzŭ Hsi\r\nthe Clansmen would undoubtedly have concerted other and more forcible\r\nmeasures, but they knew their Old Buddha and went in wholesome fear\r\nof her wrath. It was only her exceptional position and authority\r\nthat enabled her to introduce the machinery for the establishment of\r\nconstitutional government, based on the Japanese model, and there is\r\nreason to believe that even at this moment many conservative Manchus do\r\nnot regard that measure seriously.\r\n\r\nBut despite the promise of constitutional government, public opinion in\r\nthe south, never restrained in its utterances by the free-lances of the\r\nvernacular press of Hongkong and Shanghai, was outspoken in condemnation\r\nof Her Majesty’s new policy, criticising her policy in general on the\r\nground of her undignified truckling to Europeans. Lacking alike her\r\nmasculine intelligence and courageous recognition of hard facts, making\r\nno allowance for the difficulties with which she was encompassed, and\r\nanimated in many instances by a very real hatred of the Manchu rule, they\r\nattacked her in unmeasured terms of abuse; while the foreign press of\r\nthe Treaty Ports, naturally suspicious of her motives and mindful of her\r\nshare in the anti-foreign rising, was also generally unsympathetic, if\r\nnot hostile. In both cases knowledge of the woman’s virility and vitality\r\nwas lacking. Her critics failed to realise that, like most mortals, the\r\nEmpress was a mixture of good and bad, of wisdom and error, largely\r\nswayed by circumstances and the human equations around her, as well as by\r\nan essentially feminine quality of mutability; but withal, and above all,\r\na born leader of men and a politician of the very first order.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from articles published in the Shanghai press\r\nat that time, throw an instructive light on the spirit of Young China\r\n(like that of the Babu of India) as displayed in its anti-Manchu\r\nproclivities and bigoted chauvinism. One critic, taking for his text the\r\nentertainments given by Her Majesty to the Foreign Legations, wrote:—\r\n\r\n    “There can be no objection to giving a banquet to anyone who\r\n    is likely to be grateful and show some return for hospitality,\r\n    but what possible good purpose can be served by feasting\r\n    those who treat you with suspicion? We Chinese are wont to\r\n    despise our ignorant rustics when they display servility to\r\n    foreigners, but what is to be said when one in the exalted\r\n    position of the Empress Dowager demeans herself by being on\r\n    terms of affectionate intimacy with the wives of Foreign\r\n    Ministers, and even with women belonging to the commercial and\r\n    lower classes? Nowadays foreign food is served at the Palace\r\n    in a dining-room decked out in European style: the guests at\r\n    these entertainments thank their Imperial hostess on taking\r\n    leave, and the very next day their Legations will furiously\r\n    rage against China at our Foreign Office. Therefore, as for\r\n    moderating their barbarous ways, her food and her wines are\r\n    simply wasted. As a matter of fact, these guests of hers do not\r\n    scruple to compare her banquets of to-day with the melons and\r\n    vegetables which she sent to the Legations during the siege, a\r\n    comparison by no means flattering to Her Majesty. The thing is\r\n    becoming a scandal. When Russia poured out entertainments in\r\n    honour of Li Hung-chang she got something for her money; can\r\n    it be that Her Majesty is looking to similar results in the\r\n    present case for herself?”\r\n\r\nAnother critic, nearer the truth as we know, doubted whether the Empress\r\nDowager was in reality enamoured of foreign ways, and whether she was\r\nnot simulating good relations, while preparing some deep-laid scheme of\r\nfuture revenge.\r\n\r\n    “It is scarcely credible,” he observed, “that, at her time of\r\n    life, she should be able to change all her habits and form ties\r\n    so completely alien to her education and nature. Would not the\r\n    foreigners naturally ask themselves whether she was likely to\r\n    cherish any real affection for people who had plundered her\r\n    palace and had forced her to hand over to the executioners her\r\n    most faithful and trusted officials?”\r\n\r\nThis writer had difficulty, however, in believing that she contemplated\r\nanother Boxer movement and frankly confessed himself perplexed.\r\n\r\n    “As Her Majesty’s chief occupation at the present time would\r\n    appear to be to accumulate money at all costs rather than to\r\n    reorganise and strengthen the resources of the Empire, her\r\n    ultimate object may well be to secure that whatever happens,\r\n    her old age shall be comfortably provided for.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, unheeding of criticism and strong in the wisdom of her own\r\nconvictions, Tzŭ Hsi continued steadily on the lines which she had laid\r\ndown as necessary for the future safety of the Empire. It was not to be\r\nexpected that even her strong personality could overcome in a day the\r\nentrenched forces of native prejudice and conservatism within and without\r\nthe palace. At the time of her death many of the chief strongholds of\r\nthe ancient system (_e.g._, the power of the eunuchs and the organised\r\ncorruption of officials) remained practically uncriticised and untouched;\r\nbut at her passing she had marked out a rough course by which, if\r\nfaithfully followed, the ship of State might yet be safely steered\r\nthrough the rocks and shallows of the dangerous seas ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nTHE VALEDICTORY MEMORIAL OF JUNG LU\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Jung Lu was a great grief to the Empress Dowager. In\r\nthe course of her long life there was hardly any crisis or important\r\nevent of her reign wherein she had not been greatly assisted by this\r\ndevoted follower. Upon hearing of his death she issued a Decree from\r\nthe Travelling Palace at Pao-ting-fu, praising the patriotism and\r\nclear-sighted intelligence of the deceased, who, since the beginning\r\nof his career as an honorary licentiate had risen to be Controller of\r\nthe Imperial Household, Tartar General and Viceroy, in all of which\r\ncapacities he had rendered signal service. At the time of his death he\r\nhad attained to the highest honours open to a subject in China, namely,\r\nthe position of Grand Secretary and Grand Councillor. In this Decree\r\nHer Majesty laid particular stress on his endeavours to promote a good\r\nunderstanding with the foreign Powers in 1900. Further, in token of her\r\naffectionate regard, she bestowed upon him a coverlet with charms worked\r\nthereon from the Dharani Sutra in Sanscrit and Thibetan, to be used as\r\na pall for his burial, and she commanded Prince Kung to proceed to the\r\nresidence of the deceased, with ten officers of the Imperial Guard, to\r\nperform a sacrifice on her behalf to the soul of the departed statesman.\r\nShe granted him the posthumous designation of “learned and loyal,”\r\ntogether with the highest hereditary rank open to one who had not been\r\na victorious military commander or a member of the Imperial Clan. His\r\nancestral tablet was given a place at the Shrine of Good and Virtuous\r\nOfficials, and three thousand taels (£350) were issued from the privy\r\npurse towards his funeral expenses.\r\n\r\nJung Lu’s valedictory Memorial has never been published in China, but\r\nthose in attendance on Her Majesty reported that it affected her very\r\ndeeply. On the day after it reached her, she issued the following Decree:—\r\n\r\n    “The deceased Grand Secretary, Jung Lu, was our senior Grand\r\n    Councillor at a time of critical danger to the State, and his\r\n    sage counsel and eminent services to the Throne have never been\r\n    sufficiently appreciated either in China or abroad. He was\r\n    absolutely indispensable to us, and we depended entirely upon\r\n    his advice. Two months ago, owing to his ill-health, we were\r\n    compelled to grant him leave of absence, but, unfortunately,\r\n    all remedies have proved unavailing, and he has passed away.\r\n    We have perused his valedictory Memorial, full of a deep and\r\n    touching earnestness in regard to the future of our Empire\r\n    and the condition of the Chinese people; and in recalling all\r\n    the incidents of his distinguished career the violence of our\r\n    grief can only find expression in tears. Following upon the\r\n    posthumous honours already conferred upon him, we hereby decree\r\n    that a second Imperial sacrifice shall be offered to his spirit\r\n    on the day before his remains are removed for burial, and,\r\n    furthermore, that the record of his life be transmitted to the\r\n    Historiographers’ Department for inclusion in the annals of our\r\n    Dynasty. All faults that may have been recorded against him\r\n    shall be expunged, so that the depth of our sincere affection\r\n    for this faithful servant may be made manifest.”\r\n\r\nJung Lu was sixty-seven years of age at the date of his death (April\r\n11th, 1903), and it is probable that had it not been for the severe\r\nhardships and mental strain which he endured during the Boxer crisis, he\r\nwould have lived much longer to serve his Imperial mistress. By his death\r\nPrince Ch’ing and his corrupt following rose to increased power (Prince\r\nCh’ing being the only available Manchu of rank sufficient to succeed\r\nJung Lu as head of the Grand Council), and they have retained it, in the\r\nsubterranean labyrinths of Palace intrigues, ever since.\r\n\r\nJung Lu was essentially a middle-course man, striving earnestly for that\r\n“happy mean” which the Empress Dowager professed to desire. Had he lived,\r\nit is safe to say that he would not have approved of the haste with which\r\nshe proceeded to sanction the undigested programme for constitutional\r\ngovernment, and with his advice against it the Old Buddha would probably\r\nnot have persisted in the idea. He had repeatedly urged her, before\r\nthe return of the Court, to make it quite clear in her Edicts that a\r\nreform policy was necessary for the preservation of the Empire, but,\r\nlike the late Prince Ito, he was all for a slow and cautious procedure,\r\nand present-day observers of events connected with the constitutional\r\ngovernment programme can hardly doubt the wisdom of his advice.\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of his, hitherto unpublished, valedictory\r\nMemorial, a document which throws valuable light on the _coup d’état_\r\nand the relations between Tzŭ Hsi and the Emperor at that time. In other\r\nrespects it confirms many conclusions wherein Jung Lu’s authoritative\r\ntestimony was lacking to complete an otherwise satisfactory chain of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n    “I, your slave, Jung Lu, a Grand Councillor and Grand Secretary\r\n    of the Wen Hua Throne Hall, having grievously failed to\r\n    requite the favours of your Majesties, now that my breath\r\n    is almost spent, respectfully upon my knees do present this\r\n    my valedictory Memorial, and beg that your Majesties may be\r\n    pleased to cast your divine glance upon it.\r\n\r\n    “I, all unworthy, have received no small bounty at the hands\r\n    of your Majesty the Empress Dowager, and had hoped that Heaven\r\n    might grant me length of days, wherein to display my utmost\r\n    endeavour in your Majesty’s service. Respectfully I recall\r\n    the fact that I began my career of service as an Imperial\r\n    guardsman, and was on duty with H.M. Hsien-Feng in his\r\n    excursion to the hunting park at Mulan (Jehol) in the tenth\r\n    year of his reign. At that time the situation of the Empire was\r\n    one of great danger; within there was the grave peril of the\r\n    rebellion, while from without the English and French barbarians\r\n    had captured our sacred capital. We witnessed the violation of\r\n    the Imperial shrines and saw the sacred chariot of His Majesty\r\n    leave Peking, in accordance with the principle laid down by\r\n    Mencius that a sovereign should leave his capital when it is\r\n    threatened by invasion of barbarians.\r\n\r\n    “After the Court’s arrival at Jehol, I had the honour of\r\n    attending on your Majesty the Empress Dowager as Chamberlain,\r\n    and when His Majesty Hsien-Feng lay on his deathbed, I had the\r\n    honour to warn your Majesty and the Empress Consort that the\r\n    Princes Cheng and Yi were conspiring against the State. After\r\n    the death of His Majesty, those wicked Princes usurped the\r\n    Regency and for many days your Majesty was in danger so great\r\n    that it may not be spoken of by any loyal subject. Happily,\r\n    your Majesty, acting on your own firm initiative and by the\r\n    favour of Heaven, dealt with those abominable traitors in the\r\n    twinkling of an eye and rescued the State from its dire peril.\r\n    For years thereafter you carried on the Regency, rebellions\r\n    were suppressed and peace reigned within the four seas.\r\n\r\n    “Your slave received many marks of the Imperial favour and\r\n    rose to be Minister of the Household; I was thus constantly in\r\n    attendance on your Majesty. When the late Emperor T’ung-Chih\r\n    mounted the dragon and ascended on high, it was to me that\r\n    your Majesty confided the duty of bringing the present Emperor\r\n    Kuang-Hsü to the Palace. Favours vast as the universe have I\r\n    received, and for these I have made no return.\r\n\r\n    “While acting as Captain General of the Peking Gendarmerie,\r\n    I incurred your Majesty’s displeasure; thereafter for seven\r\n    years I awaited, without incurring, the fitting penalty for\r\n    my offence. Later, when His Majesty came to his majority\r\n    and you were pleased to hand over to him the reins of\r\n    government, you conferred on me the post of Tartar General\r\n    at Hsi-an. Subsequently I was recalled to my former position\r\n    at the capital. In the 24th year of Kuang-Hsü (1898) your\r\n    Majesties determined on the introduction of European methods\r\n    of government and the Emperor summoned me to audience and\r\n    conferred on me the post of Viceroy of Chihli at Tientsin\r\n    where I was ordered to select and introduce reforms based on\r\n    foreign methods in order to remedy the weakness of China’s\r\n    administration. But who could then have believed that the\r\n    damnable treasons of K’ang Yu-wei should be the means of\r\n    thwarting your Majesties’ great plans? His Majesty the\r\n    Emperor, by giving ear to the lying inventions of that traitor\r\n    and his associates, if only for a little while, undoubtedly\r\n    allowed his filial piety to suffer temporary decline. This was\r\n    particularly the case when he wrote with his own Imperial hand\r\n    a Decree stating that his reform proposals were being blocked\r\n    by your Majesty and that, as you were opposed to the spirit of\r\n    progress, your interference in State affairs was a danger to\r\n    the nation. Towards me also His Majesty displayed his divine\r\n    wrath, so that once more had your slave deserved the penalty of\r\n    ‘axes and halberds.’ But when I sought your Majesty in secret\r\n    audience and laid before you the details of the plot, once more\r\n    did your Majesty, without a moment’s hesitation respond to our\r\n    prayer and resume the control of affairs, swiftly visiting upon\r\n    evildoers of that treacherous crew the might of your august\r\n    displeasure.\r\n\r\n    “In the 26th year of Kuang-Hsü, certain Princes and Ministers,\r\n    statesmen deficient in virtue, gained your Majesty’s ear, and\r\n    even your divine wisdom was misled to believe in the unholy\r\n    arts and magic of the Boxers until the ancestral shrines were\r\n    the centre of cataclysmic disaster and the destinies of the\r\n    Empire trembled in the balance. Again and again I besought your\r\n    Majesty to put an end to these traitors, but could not gain\r\n    your consent. I incurred at that time your censure on more\r\n    than one occasion, and for forty days waited in my house fully\r\n    expectant of doom. But even so your Majesty repeatedly sought\r\n    my advice, and though it was not always followed, I was able to\r\n    avert the crowning misfortune which would have resulted from\r\n    the killing of the foreign Ministers. For this service your\r\n    Majesty has since deigned frequently to express gratitude.\r\n\r\n    “When your Majesties left the city on your tour of inspection\r\n    to Hsi-an, you decided upon punishing those evil-minded Princes\r\n    and Ministers, and thereafter to introduce a policy of gradual\r\n    and effective reform in every branch of the administration.\r\n    Already, during the past two years, considerable progress has\r\n    been made. By your return to the capital the sun has been\r\n    restored to our firmament, and even the barbarians of the\r\n    east and west have acclaimed your Majesty’s benevolence and\r\n    impartial solicitude for all, Chinese and foreigners alike.\r\n\r\n    “For the past year I have been continually ill, but until\r\n    two months ago was able to continue in the performance of my\r\n    arduous duties. Since then I have been compelled to apply for\r\n    sick-leave and have sought permission to resign my offices,\r\n    but your Majesty sent eunuchs to me with gracious messages and\r\n    presents of ginseng[124] and commanded that I should make all\r\n    haste to recover and resume my duties.\r\n\r\n    “But even the beneficent protection of your Majesty has failed\r\n    to avert from me the last ravages of illness. Repeated attacks\r\n    of asthma, with increasing difficulty in breathing, have now\r\n    brought me to the last stage of weakness and the very point\r\n    of death. With my last breath I now entreat your Majesty\r\n    vigorously to continue in the introduction of reforms, so that\r\n    gradually our Middle Kingdom may attain to a condition as\r\n    prosperous as that of the great States of Europe and Japan.\r\n    During my tenure of the office of Grand Councillor I have seen\r\n    many men appointed to offices for which they were by no means\r\n    fitted; herein lies a source of weakness, but above all it is\r\n    necessary that a radical change should be made in the selection\r\n    of District Magistrates and in the methods by which taxation\r\n    is levied and collected. It were well if the good example of\r\n    economy which your Majesty is setting were more generally\r\n    followed. In the seclusion of the Palace it is impossible\r\n    for your Majesty to know the truth as to the condition of\r\n    your subjects, and were it not for the prohibitive cost of\r\n    transporting your enormous retinues, I should advise that the\r\n    Throne should make regular tours of inspection in various\r\n    parts of the Empire. His Majesty Ch’ien-Lung made several\r\n    such tours, and among the wise sovereigns of ancient times\r\n    the custom was regularly observed. At this moment my mind is\r\n    becoming confused; I can say no more. Humbly do I pray that\r\n    your Majesty’s fame may continue to grow, and that all my good\r\n    wishes on your Majesty’s behalf may be fulfilled. Then, even\r\n    though I die, yet shall I live.\r\n\r\n    “I have dictated this, my valedictory Memorial, to my\r\n    adopted son, Liang Ku’ei, for transmission to your Majesty,\r\n    in temporary residence at Pao-ting fu. Though conscious of\r\n    its numerous shortcomings, for which I beg forgiveness, I\r\n    reverently entreat your Majesty to peruse it. Prostrate before\r\n    the Throne, with my dying breath, I, Jung Lu, now conclude my\r\n    Memorial.\r\n\r\n                   “(_Dated the 10th April, 1903._)”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nHER MAJESTY’S LAST DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1908 Tzŭ Hsi’s generally robust health showed signs of\r\nfailing, a fact which is recorded in her valedictory Decree, and one of\r\nno small importance in considering the coincident fact of the illness\r\nof the Emperor. Of the causes and manner of the latter’s death, nothing\r\nwill ever be definitely known; they lie buried with many another secret\r\nof the Forbidden City, in the hearts of Li Lien-ying and his immediate\r\nsatellites. Even among the higher officials, Manchu and Chinese, of the\r\ncapital, opinions differ, and many conflicting theories are current\r\nto account for the remarkable coincidence of the death of Tzŭ Hsi and\r\nher unhappy nephew on successive days. For those who seek it there is\r\nno lack of circumstantial evidence to justify the conclusion that the\r\nlong-threatened Emperor was “removed” by the reactionaries, headed by\r\nthe chief eunuch, who had only too good cause to fear his unfettered\r\nauthority on the Throne. At the same time it is conceivably possible\r\nthat many of the plots and proceedings of the Summer Palace at that time\r\nmight have been unknown to Tzŭ Hsi, and that she was purposely kept in\r\nignorance by those who foresaw the possibility of her early death and\r\ntook their precautions accordingly, after the Oriental manner. Indeed,\r\nin the light of much trustworthy evidence of eye-witnesses, this seems\r\na rational explanation of events to which any solution by theories of\r\ncoincidence is evidently difficult. Most of the following account of Her\r\nMajesty’s last days is derived from the statements of two high officials,\r\none Manchu and the other Chinese, who were at that time on duty with the\r\nCourt. Their testimony and their conclusions coincide, on the whole, with\r\nthose of the best-informed and most reliable Chinese newspapers, whose\r\nnews from the capital is also generally from official sources. We accept\r\nthem, naturally, with all reserve, yet with an inclination to give the\r\nEmpress Dowager, on this occasion, the benefit of their good opinions and\r\nour own doubts. The simultaneous deaths may possibly have been due to\r\nnatural causes, but it is to be observed by the most sympathetic critic,\r\nthat the account given by Her Majesty’s loyal servants of her behaviour\r\nimmediately after the Emperor’s death, is by no means suggestive of\r\nsorrow, but rather of relief.\r\n\r\nIt was in the previous autumn that the Emperor became very ill, so much\r\nso that he was gradually compelled during the last year of his life to\r\ndesist from performance of the usual sacrifices, which entail no small\r\nexpenditure of physical energy through their genuflections and continual\r\nprostrations. The impression gradually gained ground that His Majesty\r\nwas not likely to live much longer, and it was remarked, and remembered\r\nas a significant fact, that the Old Buddha had some time before given\r\norders for the engagement of special wet-nurses for the infant son of\r\nPrince Ch’un, born in February, 1906. It was understood that these orders\r\nimplied the selection of this infant Prince to succeed Kuang-Hsü, but\r\nalthough many attempts were made to induce her to declare herself on this\r\nsubject, she declined to do so on the ground that her previous experience\r\nhad been unlucky, that her selections had been the cause of much\r\nmisunderstanding, and that, moreover, it was a house-law of the Dynasty\r\nthat the heir to the throne could only be lawfully selected when the\r\nsovereign was _in extremis_, a rule which she had completely disregarded\r\nin the nomination of Prince Tuan’s son in 1900.[125]\r\n\r\nIn this connection, there is every reason to believe that Tzŭ Hsi’s\r\nsuperstitious nature, and the memory of the prophecies of woe uttered\r\nby the Censor Wu K’o-tu at the time of his protesting suicide, had\r\nundoubtedly led her to regret the violation of the sacred laws of\r\nsuccession which she committed in selecting Kuang-Hsü for the Throne. On\r\nmore than one occasion in recent years she had endeavoured to propitiate\r\nthe shade of the departed Censor, and public opinion, by conferring\r\nupon him posthumous honours. Towards the end of her reign, after the\r\nhumiliations inflicted on China in successive wars by France, Japan and\r\nthe coalition of the Allies, she was frequently heard to express remorse\r\nat having been led into courses of error which had brought down upon\r\nher the wrath of Heaven. In 1888, when the Temple of Heaven was struck\r\nby lightning, and again, when the chief gate of the Forbidden City took\r\nfire and was destroyed, she interpreted these events as marks of the\r\nSupreme Being’s disapproval of her actions. The Emperor’s subsequent\r\nconspiracy with K’ang Yu-wei and his associates of 1898, became in\r\nher eyes another judgment and visitation of Heaven. It may therefore\r\nreasonably be assumed that when the Boxer Princes persuaded her of the\r\nefficacy of their magic arts and of their ability to drive the foreigner\r\ninto the sea, she seized upon the hope thus offered as a means of\r\nregaining the favour of the gods and atoning for past errors. Although\r\nin selecting the son of Prince Tuan to be heir to her son, the Emperor\r\nT’ung-Chih (thus passing over Kuang-Hsü), she had once more violated the\r\nhouse-laws of the Dynasty, there is no doubt that she took her risks in\r\nthe certain hope that further prestige must accrue to her house and to\r\nherself, by the fact that the boy Emperor’s father, next to herself\r\nin power, would be hailed by the Chinese people as the Heaven-sent\r\ndeliverer, the conqueror of the hated barbarian, and the saviour of his\r\ncountry. In other words, recognising that the mistakes she had committed\r\nhad seriously injured her in the eyes of the nation, she determined to\r\nendeavour to retrieve them by one last desperate throw. Later, after\r\nthe return from exile, when she realised that this heroic venture had\r\nbeen as misguided in its inception as any of her former misdeeds, she\r\nshowed her splendid courage and resource by a swift _volte-face_ in the\r\nadoption of those very reform measures which she had formerly opposed,\r\nand by annulling the appointment of Prince Tuan’s son as Heir to the\r\nThrone. She thus cut herself adrift from all connection with the Boxer\r\nleaders as completely and unhesitatingly as she wiped out from the\r\nannals of her reign all reference to the Edicts which she had issued in\r\ntheir favour. The present-day result brought about by this change of\r\npolicy, and of the succession of Prince Chun’s infant son to the Throne,\r\nhas been to establish more firmly than ever that junior branch of the\r\nImperial family. It is now believed, if not accepted, at Court, that\r\nthe first Prince Ch’un, the father of Kuang-Hsü and grandfather of the\r\npresent sovereign, will eventually be canonised with the title of “Ti”\r\nor Emperor, which would practically make him, by posthumous right, the\r\nfounder of a new Dynastic branch. The problem of the direct succession,\r\neven in Chinese eyes, is not simple, and it was generally supposed\r\n(_e.g._ by the _Times_ correspondent at Peking in October 1908) that the\r\nEmpress Dowager would nominate Prince P’u Lun to succeed Kuang-Hsü, thus\r\nrestoring the succession to the senior branch of the family. This would\r\ncertainly have appealed to orthodox and literary officials throughout\r\nthe Empire, and, as a means of appeasing the distressed ghost of the\r\nprotesting Censor, would have been more effective than the course she\r\nactually adopted. Doctor Morrison, discussing this question of the\r\nsuccession before the event, expressed the general opinion that the\r\nappointment of another infant to succeed the Emperor Kuang-Hsü (involving\r\nanother long Regency) would be fraught with great danger to the Dynasty.\r\nThere is no doubt that the present situation, lacking that strong hand\r\nwhich for half a century has held together the chaotic fabric of China’s\r\nGovernment, suffers from the fact that for many years to come the supreme\r\nauthority must remain in the hands of a Regent, and a Regent whose\r\nposition is _ab initio_ undermined by the powerful influences brought\r\nto bear by the senior branch of the Imperial Clan. Tzŭ Hsi was fully\r\naware of the position which would be created, or rather prolonged, by\r\nthe selection of Prince Chun’s son, and for this reason, no doubt, the\r\nselection of Kuang-Hsü’s successor was postponed until the very day of\r\nher death. When, at last, confronted by the imperative necessity for\r\naction, she had to make up her mind, there were two things that chiefly\r\nweighed with her. These were, firstly, the promise that she had made to\r\nJung Lu, and, secondly, her unconcealed dislike for Prince Ch’ing, who\r\nhad made himself the chief spokesman for the claims of Prince P’u Lun.\r\nIt was also only natural that she should wish to leave to her favourite\r\nniece (the Consort of Kuang-Hsü) the title and power of Empress Dowager,\r\nif only in reward for years of faithful and loyal service to herself. In\r\nother words, the claims of the human equation and her own inclinations\r\noutweighed, unto the end, the claims of orthodox tradition and the qualms\r\nof her conscience.\r\n\r\nThroughout the winter of 1907 and the following spring, the Empress\r\nenjoyed her usual vigorous health. In April she went, as usual, to the\r\nSummer Palace, where she remained all through the hot season. With the\r\nheat, however, came a recurrence of her dysenteric trouble and in August\r\nshe had a slight stroke of paralysis, as the result of which her face,\r\nhitherto remarkably youthful for a woman of seventy, took on a drawn\r\nand tired appearance. In other respects her health seemed fairly good;\r\ncertainly her vigour of speech remained unimpaired, and she continued to\r\ndevote unremitting attention to affairs of State. She was wont frequently\r\nto declare her ambition of attaining to the same age as Queen Victoria, a\r\nruler for whom she professed the greatest admiration; she would say that\r\nshe could trace, in the features of the English Queen, lines of longevity\r\nsimilar to those in her own. The Taoist Abbot, Kao, whom she used to\r\nreceive in frequent audiences, and who possessed considerable influence\r\nover her, had prophesied that she would live longer than any former\r\nEmpress of the Dynasty; but his prophecy was not fulfilled, for she died\r\nyounger than three of her predecessors.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1908 the Old Buddha took a keen interest in the\r\nimpending visit of the Dalai Lama, which had been arranged for the\r\nautumn. The chief eunuch, Li, begged her to cancel this visitation on\r\nthe ground that it was notoriously unlucky for the “Living Buddha” and\r\nthe Son of Heaven to be resident in one city at the same time. Either\r\nthe priest or the sovereign would surely die, he said.[126] To this\r\nTzŭ Hsi replied that she had long since decided in her mind that the\r\nEmperor’s illness was incurable, and she saw no reason, therefore, to\r\nstop the coming of the Dalai Lama. Nevertheless, in July, she summoned\r\ncertain Chinese physicians, educated abroad, to attend His Majesty,\r\nwho had become greatly emaciated and very weak. They reported that he\r\nwas suffering from Bright’s disease. Their examination of the august\r\npatient and their diagnosis of his symptoms were necessarily perfunctory,\r\ninasmuch as etiquette prevented the application of the proper tests, but\r\nthey professed to have verified the fact that the action of the heart was\r\nvery weak. On the other hand, writers in the newspapers of the south did\r\nnot hesitate to assert that the whole medical performance was a farce\r\nand that the death of the Emperor would undoubtedly take place so soon\r\nas the powers about the Throne had made up their minds that the Empress\r\nDowager was not likely to live much longer.\r\n\r\nAccording to the general consensus of opinion in the capital, the\r\nrelations between the Old Buddha and His Majesty were not unfriendly at\r\nthis period. It was said that shortly before his illness became acute\r\nthe Empress Dowager had encouraged him to take a more active part in\r\naffairs of State, and to select candidates for certain high offices: she\r\ncertainly renewed the practice of showing him Decrees for the formality\r\nof his concurrence. When the reformer Wang Chao returned from flight,\r\nand gave himself up to the police, she, who had vowed the death of this\r\nman in 1898, invited His Majesty to decide what punishment should now\r\nbe inflicted upon him. The Emperor, after long reflection, suggested\r\nthat his life be spared. “By all means,” replied the Old Buddha, “I had\r\nfully intended to forgive him, but desired to hear your opinion. Full\r\nwell I know your sincere hatred of fellows like K’ang Yu-wei and his\r\nassociates, and I was afraid, therefore, that you might insist on the\r\nimmediate decapitation of Wang Chao.” She evidently believed that she\r\nhad completely eradicated from His Majesty’s mind all opposition to her\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nAs the Emperor’s health grew worse, the eunuchs were instructed not to\r\nkeep him waiting when calling upon the Empress Dowager and he was also\r\nexcused at the meetings of the Grand Council from awaiting her arrival\r\nand departure on his knees. A Manchu holding a high position at Court\r\ntestifies to the truth of the following incident. One morning, after\r\nperusal of a Censor’s Memorial, which contained several inaccurate\r\nstatements, His Majesty observed to the Grand Council, “How little of\r\ntruth there is in common rumour. For instance, I know myself to be really\r\nill, yet here it is denied that there is anything the matter with\r\nme.” The Empress Dowager here broke in:—“Who has dared to utter such\r\nfalsehoods? If caught, he will certainly be beheaded.” Kuang-Hsü then\r\nproceeded to say:—“I am really getting weaker every day, and do not see\r\nmy way to performing the necessary ceremonies on the occasion of Your\r\nMajesty’s approaching birthday.” Compassionately the Old Buddha replied:\r\n“It is more important to me that you should recover your health than that\r\nyou should knock your head on the ground in my honour.” The Emperor fell\r\non his knees to thank her for these gracious words, but collapsed in a\r\nfainting fit. Prince Ch’ing thereupon advised that a certain doctor, Chü\r\nYung-chiu, trained in Europe, should be called in, but his advice was\r\nnot followed till later. On the following day His Majesty enquired of\r\nthe Court physicians in attendance, whose medical training is the same\r\nas that which has been handed down since the days of the T’ang Dynasty,\r\nwhether his disease was likely to be fatal. “The heart of your Emperor is\r\ngreatly disturbed,” said he. Dr. Lu Yung-pin replied:—“There is nothing\r\nin Your Majesty’s present condition to indicate any mortal disease. We\r\nbeseech Your Majesty to be calm: it is for us, your servants, to be\r\nperturbed in spirit.”\r\n\r\nAfter Tzŭ Hsi’s stroke of paralysis, the wildest rumours were circulated\r\nas to her condition, so much so that, realising the excited state of\r\nprovincial opinion, and its relation to the question of the Constitution\r\nwhich was to have been granted, Her Majesty decided to carry out without\r\nfurther delay the promise she made in 1906. On the 1st of the 8th\r\nMoon, she therefore promulgated a Decree, showing signs of the same\r\nspirit of lofty statesmanship as was displayed by the rulers of Japan,\r\nand evidently based on their example, whereby it was promised that\r\na constitutional form of government would be completely established\r\nwithin a period of nine years. At the same time it was decreed that\r\nevery branch of the government should institute the changes necessary\r\nto facilitate the introduction of the new dispensation. On issuing this\r\nDecree she expressed her hope of living to witness the convening of the\r\nfirst Chinese Parliament, and added that if Prince Tuan’s son had proved\r\nhimself worthy, and had remained Heir Apparent, he would by now have\r\nbeen of age to carry on the government after the Emperor’s death. Age\r\nwas creeping upon her, and she would be glad to retire to the Summer\r\nPalace for her declining years. As long as matters remained in their\r\npresent state, it would be necessary to refer important questions for her\r\ndecision, but she greatly wished that the period of her Regency should\r\nnot be indefinitely prolonged.\r\n\r\nIn September occurred the fiftieth birthday of the ex-Viceroy of Chihli\r\nYüan Shih-k’ai, while the Court was still in residence at the Summer\r\nPalace. The Old Buddha showered costly gifts upon her trusted Minister,\r\nand almost every high official in Peking attended the birthday ceremonies\r\nto present congratulations and gifts. Conspicuous by his absence,\r\nhowever, was the Emperor’s brother, Prince Ch’un (the present Regent),\r\nwho had applied for short leave in order to avoid being present, and who\r\noffered no presents.\r\n\r\nA significant incident occurred in connection with the birthday\r\nceremonies. Among the many complimentary scrolls, presented by friends\r\nand hanging on the walls, were a pair which attracted much attention,\r\nuntil they were hurriedly removed. One contained the following\r\ninscription:—“5th day of the 8th Moon of the Wu Shen year” (this was the\r\ndate of the crisis of the _coup d’état_ when Yüan Shih-k’ai warned Jung\r\nLu of the plot, and thus brought about the practical dethronement of the\r\nEmperor), and on the other were the words:—“May the Emperor live ten\r\nthousand years! May Your Excellency live ten thousand years.”\r\n\r\nThe words “_wan sui_,” meaning “ten thousand years,” are not applicable\r\nto any subject of the Throne, and the inner meaning of these words was,\r\ntherefore, interpreted to be a charge against Yüan of conspiring for the\r\nThrone. It was clear that some enemy had sent the scrolls as a reminder\r\nof Yüan’s betrayal of his Sovereign ten years before, and that they had\r\nbeen hung up either as the result of connivance or carelessness on the\r\npart of Yüan’s people. Four months later, when the great ex-Viceroy fell,\r\nthis incident was remembered and inevitably connected with Prince Ch’un’s\r\nnon-appearance at the birthday ceremonies.\r\n\r\nIn September, the Dalai Lama reached Peking, but owing to a dispute on\r\ncertain details of ceremonial, his audience was postponed. It was finally\r\narranged that the Pontiff should kowtow to the Throne, and that the\r\nEmperor should then rise from his seat and invite the Lama to sit beside\r\nhim on a cane couch. This ceremonial was most reluctantly accepted,\r\nand only after much discussion, by the Dalai Lama, who considered his\r\ndignity seriously injured by having to kowtow. He had brought with him\r\nmuch tribute, and was therefore the more disappointed at the Old Buddha’s\r\nfailure to show him the marks of respect which he had expected. His\r\naudience was held early in October, when Her Majesty requested him to\r\noffer up prayers regularly for her long life and prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn October, the foreign Ministers were also received at the Summer\r\nPalace, and on the 20th of that month the Court returned to the Lake\r\nPalace for the winter. On this, her last State progress, the Empress\r\nDowager approached the city as usual in her State barge, by the canal\r\nwhich joins the Summer Palace Lake with the waters of the Winter Palace,\r\nproceeding in it as far as the Temple of Imperial Longevity, which is\r\nsituated on the banks of this canal. It was observed that as she left\r\nthe precincts of the Summer Palace she gazed longingly towards the lofty\r\nwalls that rise from the banks of the lake, and from thence to the hills\r\nreceding into the far distance. Turning to the “Lustrous” concubine who\r\nsat at her feet, she expressed her fears that the critical condition of\r\nthe Emperor would prevent her from visiting her favourite residence for\r\na long time to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW, FROM THE K’UN MING LAKE, OF THE SUMMER PALACE.]\r\n\r\nThe Old Buddha sat in a cane chair on the raised deck of her magnificent\r\nbarge adorned with carved dragons and phœnixes; she was surrounded by her\r\nfavourite eunuchs, and half a dozen of the chief ladies of the Court. As\r\nshe descended from the barge, supported by two eunuchs, and entered the\r\nsedan chair which bore her to within the temple precincts, her vivacity\r\nand good spirits formed a subject of general comment. She performed the\r\nusual sacrifices at the Temple of Imperial Longevity, a shrine which\r\nshe had liberally endowed; but it was remembered after her death, as an\r\nunfortunate omen, that the last stick of incense failed to ignite. Upon\r\nleaving the temple she begged the priests to chant daily liturgies and to\r\npray for her longevity, in view of her approaching birthday.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the temple precincts she proceeded with her\r\nladies-in-waiting to the Botanical and Zoological Gardens, which lie just\r\noutside the “West-Straight gate” of the city. On arrival at the gates,\r\nshe insisted upon descending from her sedan chair, and made the entire\r\nround of the gardens on foot. She expressed interest and much pleasure at\r\nthe sight of animals which she had never seen before, and announced her\r\nintention of frequently visiting the place. She asked numerous questions\r\nof the keepers, being especially interested in the lions, and created\r\nmuch amusement amongst her immediate entourage by asking the director of\r\nthe gardens (a Manchu official of the Household) for information as to\r\nwhere the animals came from, a subject on which he was naturally quite\r\nuninformed. “You don’t seem to know much about zoology,” she observed,\r\nand turned from the crestfallen official to address one of the keepers\r\nin a most informal manner. The chief eunuch, Li Lien-ying, wearied by\r\nsuch unwonted exercise, implored Her Majesty not to tire herself, but\r\nthe Old Buddha took pleasure, clearly malicious, in hurrying him round\r\nthe grounds. The occasion was unusual and remarkably informal, and the\r\npicture brings irresistibly to the English mind memories of another\r\nstrong-minded Queen and her inspection of another garden, where heads\r\nwere insecure for gardeners and Cheshire cats. Eye-witnesses of that\r\nday’s outing commented freely on their Imperial Mistress’s extraordinary\r\nspirits and vitality, predicting for her many years of life.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, whose memory on unexpected subjects was always remarkable,\r\nreferred on this occasion to the elephant which had been presented to\r\nher by Tuan Fang upon his return from Europe, and which, together with\r\nseveral other animals for which she had no fitting accommodation in the\r\nPalace grounds, was the first cause and first inmate of the Zoological\r\nGardens. The elephant in question had originally been in charge of the\r\ntwo German keepers who had accompanied it from Hagenbeck’s establishment;\r\nthese men had frequently but unsuccessfully protested at the insufficient\r\nrations provided for the beast by the Mandarin in charge. Eventually\r\nthe elephant had died of slow starvation, and the keepers had returned\r\nto Europe, after obtaining payment of their unexpired contracts, a\r\nresult which brought down upon the offending official Her Majesty’s\r\nsevere displeasure. She referred now to this incident, and expressed\r\nsatisfaction that most of the animals appeared to be well cared for,\r\nthough the tigers’ attendant received a sharp rebuke.\r\n\r\nAfter Her Majesty’s return to the Winter Palace, everything was given\r\nover to preparations for the celebration of her seventy-third birthday\r\non the 3rd of November. The main streets of the city were decorated, and\r\nin the Palace itself arrangements were made for a special theatrical\r\nperformance to last for five days. A special ceremony, quite distinct\r\nfrom the ordinary birthday congratulations of the Court, was arranged for\r\nthe Dalai Lama, who was to make obeisance before Her Majesty at the head\r\nof his following of priests. The health of His Majesty did not permit\r\nof his carrying out the prescribed ceremony of prostration before Her\r\nMajesty’s Throne in the main Palace of Ceremonial Phœnixes; he therefore\r\ndeputed a Prince of the Blood to represent him in the performance of\r\nthis duty, and those who knew its deep significance on such an occasion\r\nrealised that the condition of his health must indeed be desperate. This\r\nimpression was confirmed by the fact that he was similarly compelled to\r\nabandon his intention of being present at a special banquet to be given\r\nto the Dalai Lama in the Palace of Tributary Envoys. The high priest, who\r\nhad been compelled to kneel outside the banquet hall to await the arrival\r\nof His Majesty, was greatly incensed at this occurrence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMPRESS DOWAGER, WITH THE CHIEF EUNUCH, LI LIEN-YING.]\r\n\r\nAt eight in the morning of the birthday His Majesty left his Palace in\r\nthe “Ocean Terrace” and proceeded to the Throne Hall. His emaciated\r\nand woe-begone appearance was such, however, that the Old Buddha took\r\ncompassion upon him, and bade his attendant eunuchs support him to his\r\npalanquin, excusing him from further attendance. Later in the day she\r\nissued a special Decree praising the loyalty of the Dalai Lama, and\r\nordering him to return promptly to Thibet, “there to extol the generosity\r\nof the Throne of China, and faithfully to obey the commands of the\r\nSovereign power.” The Empress Dowager spent the afternoon of her birthday\r\nin the congenial amusement of a masquerade, appearing in the costume\r\nof the Goddess of Mercy, attended by a numerous suite of concubines,\r\nImperial Princesses, and eunuchs, all in fancy dress. They picnicked on\r\nthe lake, and Her Majesty appeared to be in the very highest spirits.\r\nUnfortunately, towards evening, she caught a chill, and thereafter,\r\npartaking too freely of a mixture of clotted cream and crab apples, she\r\nhad a return of the dysenteric complaint from which she had suffered all\r\nthrough the summer. On the following day she attended to affairs of State\r\nas usual, reading a vast number of Memorials and recording her decision\r\nthereon, but on the 5th of November neither she nor the Emperor were\r\nsufficiently well to receive the Grand Council, so that all business of\r\ngovernment was suspended for two days. Upon hearing of Her Majesty’s\r\nillness, the Dalai Lama hastened to present her with an image of Buddha,\r\nwhich, he said, should be despatched forthwith to her mausoleum at\r\nthe hills, the building of which had just been completed under the\r\nsupervision of Prince Ch’ing.[127] The high priest urged all haste in\r\ntransmitting this miracle-working image to her future burial-place; if it\r\nwere done quickly, he said, her life would be prolonged by many years,\r\nbecause the unlucky conjunction of the stars now affecting her adversely\r\nwould avail nothing against the magic power of this image. The Old Buddha\r\nwas greatly reassured by the Dalai Lama’s cheerful prognostications,\r\nand next morning held audience as usual. She commanded Prince Ch’ing to\r\nproceed without delay to the tombs, and there to deposit the miraculous\r\nimage on the altar.[128] She ordered him to pay particular attention to\r\nthe work done at the mausoleum, and to make certain that her detailed\r\ninstructions had been faithfully carried out. Prince Ch’ing demurred\r\nsomewhat at these instructions, inquiring whether she really wished him\r\nto leave Peking at a time when she herself and the Emperor were both ill.\r\nBut the Old Buddha would brook no argument, and peremptorily ordered him\r\nto proceed as instructed. “I am not likely to die,” she said, “during the\r\nnext few days; already I am feeling much better. In any case you will do\r\nas you are told.” On Monday, November 9th, both the Empress Dowager and\r\nthe Emperor were present at a meeting of the Grand Council, and a special\r\naudience was given to the Educational Commissioner of Chihli province,\r\nabout to leave for his post. At this audience the Old Buddha spoke with\r\nsome bitterness of the increasing tendency of the student class to\r\ngive vent to revolutionary ideas, and she commanded the Commissioner of\r\nEducation to do all in his power to check their political activities.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards four more physicians, who had come up from the\r\nprovinces, were admitted to see His Majesty. That same afternoon he had\r\na serious relapse, and from that day forward never left his palace. On\r\nthe following morning he sent a dutiful message (or it was sent for him)\r\nenquiring after the Empress Dowager’s health, she being also confined\r\nto her room and holding no audiences. The Court physicians reported\r\nbadly of both their Imperial patients: being fearful as to the outcome,\r\nthey begged the Comptroller-General of the Household to engage other\r\nphysicians in their place. The Grand Council sent a message to Prince\r\nCh’ing, directing him to return to Peking with all haste, his presence\r\nbeing required forthwith on matters of the highest importance. Travelling\r\nnight and day, he reached the capital at about eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning of the 13th, and hastened to the palace. He found the Old Buddha\r\ncheerful and confident of ultimate recovery, but the Emperor was visibly\r\nsinking, his condition being comatose, with short lucid intervals. His\r\nlast conscious act had been to direct his Consort to inform the Empress\r\nDowager that he regretted being unable to attend her, and that he hoped\r\nthat she would appoint an Heir Apparent without further delay. Whether\r\nthese dutiful messages were spontaneous or inspired, and indeed, whether\r\nthey were ever sent by the Emperor, is a matter upon which doubt has been\r\nfreely expressed.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the arrival of Prince Ch’ing, an important audience\r\nwas held in the Hall of Ceremonial Phœnixes. Her Majesty was able to\r\nmount the Throne, and, although obviously weak, her unconquerable courage\r\nenabled her to master her physical ailments, and she spoke with all her\r\nwonted vehemence and lucidity. A well-informed member of the Grand\r\nCouncil, full of wonder at such an exhibition of strength of will, has\r\nrecorded the fact that she completely led and dominated the Council.\r\nThere were present Prince Ch’ing, Prince Ch’un, the Grand Councillor Yüan\r\nShih-k’ai, and the Grand Secretaries Chang Chih-tung, Lu Ch’uan-lin and\r\nShih Hsü.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty announced that the time had come to nominate an Heir to the\r\nEmperor T’ung-Chih, in accordance with that Decree of the first day\r\nof the reign of Kuang-Hsü, wherein it was provided that the deceased\r\nSovereign’s ancestral rites should be safeguarded by allowing him\r\nprecedence over his successor of the same generation. Her choice, she\r\nsaid, was already made, but she desired to take the opinion of the Grand\r\nCouncillors in the first instance. Prince Ch’ing and Yüan Shih-k’ai then\r\nrecommended the appointment of Prince P’u Lun, or, failing him, Prince\r\nKung. They thought the former, as senior great-grandson of Tao-Kuang,\r\nwas the more eligible candidate, and with this view Prince Ch’un seemed\r\ndisposed to agree. The remaining Grand Councillors, however, advised the\r\nselection of Prince Ch’un’s infant son.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the views of her Councillors, the Old Buddha announced\r\nthat long ago, at the time when she had betrothed the daughter of Jung\r\nLu to Prince Ch’un, she had decided that the eldest son of this marriage\r\nshould become Heir to the Throne, in recognition and reward of Jung\r\nLu’s lifelong devotion to her person, and his paramount services to the\r\nDynasty at the time of the Boxer rising. She placed on record her opinion\r\nthat he had saved the Manchus by refusing to assist in the attack upon\r\nthe Legations. In the 3rd Moon of this year she had renewed her pledge\r\nto Jung Lu’s widow, her oldest friend, just before she died. She would,\r\ntherefore, now bestow upon Prince Ch’un as Regent, the title of “Prince\r\nco-operating in the Government,” a title one degree higher than that\r\nwhich had been given to Prince Kung in 1861, who was made “Adviser to\r\nthe Government” by herself and her co-Regent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SON OF HEAVEN. H.M. HSÜAN-T’UNG, EMPEROR OF CHINA.]\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this decision, Prince Ch’un arose from his seat and\r\nrepeatedly kowtowed before Her Majesty, expressing a deep sense of his\r\nown unworthiness. Once more Yüan Shih-k’ai courageously advanced the\r\nsuperior claims of Prince P’u Lun: he was sincerely of opinion that the\r\ntime had come for the succession to be continued along the original lines\r\nof primogeniture; it was clear also that he fully realised that Prince\r\nCh’un was his bitter enemy. The Old Buddha turned upon him with an angry\r\nreprimand. “You think.” she said, “that I am old, and in my dotage,\r\nbut you should have learned by now that when I make up my mind nothing\r\nstops me from acting upon it. At a critical time in a nation’s affairs a\r\nyouthful Sovereign is no doubt a source of danger to the State, but do\r\nnot forget that I shall be here to direct and assist Prince Ch’un.” Then,\r\nturning to the other Councillors, she continued:—“Draft two Decrees at\r\nonce, in my name, the first, appointing Tsai-feng, Prince Ch’un, to be\r\n‘Prince co-operating in the Government’ and the second commanding that\r\nP’u Yi, son of Prince Ch’un, should enter the palace forthwith, to be\r\nbrought up within the precincts.” She ordered Prince Ch’ing to inform the\r\nEmperor of these Decrees.\r\n\r\nKuang-Hsü was still conscious, and understood what Prince Ch’ing said\r\nto him. “Would it not have been better,” he said, “to nominate an\r\nadult? No doubt, however, the Empress Dowager knows best.” Upon hearing\r\nof the appointment of Prince Ch’un to the Regency, he expressed his\r\ngratification. This was at 3 P.M.; two hours later the infant Prince\r\nhad been brought into the Palace, and was taken by his father to be\r\nshown both to the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. At seven o’clock\r\non the following morning the physicians in attendance reported that\r\nHis Majesty’s “nose was twitching and his stomach rising,” from which\r\nsigns they knew that his end was at hand. During the night, feeling that\r\ndeath was near, he had written out his last testament, in a hand almost\r\nillegible, prefacing the same with these significant words:—\r\n\r\n    “We were the second son of Prince Ch’un when the Empress\r\n    Dowager selected Us for the Throne. She has always hated Us,\r\n    but for Our misery of the past ten years Yüan Shih-k’ai is\r\n    responsible, and one other” (the second name is said to have\r\n    been illegible). “When the time comes I desire that Yüan be\r\n    summarily beheaded.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s consort took possession of this document, which, however,\r\nwas seen by independent witnesses. Its wording goes to show that any\r\nconciliatory attitude on the part of the Emperor during the last year\r\nmust have been inspired by fear and not by any revival of affection.\r\n\r\nLater in the day a Decree was promulgated, announcing to the inhabitants\r\nof Peking and the Empire that their sovereign’s condition was desperate,\r\nand calling on the provinces to send their most skilful physicians\r\npost-haste to the capital so that, perchance, His Majesty’s life\r\nmight yet be saved. The Decree described in detail the symptoms, real\r\nor alleged, of Kuang-Hsü’s malady. It was generally regarded as a\r\nperfunctory announcement of an unimportant event, long expected.\r\n\r\nAt 3 P.M. the Empress Dowager came to the “Ocean Terrace” to visit the\r\nEmperor, but he was unconscious, and did not know her. Later, when a\r\nshort return of consciousness occurred, his attendants endeavoured to\r\npersuade him to put on the Ceremonial Robes of Longevity, in which\r\netiquette prescribes that sovereigns should die. It is the universal\r\ncustom that, if possible, the patient should don these robes in his\r\nlast moments, for it is considered unlucky if they are put on after\r\ndeath. His Majesty, however, obstinately declined, and at five o’clock\r\nhe died, in the presence of the Empress Dowager, his consort, the two\r\nsecondary consorts, and a few eunuchs. The Empress Dowager did not remain\r\nto witness the ceremony of clothing the body in the Dragon Robes, but\r\nreturned forthwith to her own palace, where she gave orders for the issue\r\nof his valedictory Decree and for the proclamation of the new Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting passage of the Emperor’s valedictory Decree was\r\nthe following:—“Reflecting on the critical condition of our Empire, we\r\nhave been led to combine the Chinese system with certain innovations\r\nfrom foreign countries. We have endeavoured to establish harmony between\r\nthe common people and converts to Christianity. We have reorganised the\r\narmy and founded colleges. We have fostered trade and industries and\r\nhave made provision for a new judicial system, paving also the way for\r\na Constitutional form of government, so that all our subjects may enjoy\r\nthe continued blessings of peace.” After referring to the appointment\r\nof the Regent and the nomination of a successor to the Dragon Throne,\r\nhe concludes (or rather the Empress concluded for him) with a further\r\nreference to the Constitution, and an appeal to his Ministers to purify\r\ntheir hearts and prepare themselves, so that, after nine years, the\r\nnew order may be accomplished, and the Imperial purposes successfully\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nThe Old Buddha appeared at this juncture to be in particularly good\r\nspirits, astonishing all about her by her vivacity and keenness. She\r\ngave orders that a further Decree be published, in the name of the new\r\nEmperor, containing the usual laudation of the deceased monarch and an\r\nexpression of the infant Emperor’s gratitude to the Empress Dowager for\r\nher benevolence in placing him on the Throne.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the Censor Wu K’o-tu committed suicide at the\r\nbeginning of Kuang-Hsü’s reign, as an act of protest at the irregularity\r\nin the succession, which left no heir to the Emperor T’ung-Chih, that\r\nmonarch’s spirit being left desolate and without a successor to perform\r\non his behalf the ancestral sacrifices. The child, P’u Yi, having now\r\nbeen made heir by adoption to T’ung-Chih, in fulfilment of the promise\r\nmade by Tzŭ Hsi at the time of this sensational suicide, it appeared as\r\nif the irregularity were about to be repeated, and the soul of Kuang-Hsü\r\nto be left in a similar orbate condition in the Halls of Hades, unless\r\nsome means could be found to solve the difficulty and meet the claims of\r\nboth the deceased Emperors. In the event of Kuang-Hsü being left without\r\nheir or descendant to perform the all-important worship at his shrine,\r\nthere could be but little doubt that the feelings of the orthodox would\r\nagain be outraged, and the example of Wu K’o-tu might have been followed\r\nby other Censors. The Empress Dowager, realising the importance of the\r\nquestion, solved it in her own masterful way by a stroke of policy which,\r\nalthough without precisely applicable precedent in history, nevertheless\r\nappeared to satisfy all parties, and to placate all prejudices, if only\r\nby reason of its simplicity and originality. Her Decree on the subject\r\nwas as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The Emperor T’ung-Chih, having left no heir, was compelled to\r\n    issue a Decree to the effect that so soon as a child should be\r\n    born to His Majesty Kuang-Hsü, that child would be adopted as\r\n    Heir to the Emperor T’ung-Chih. But now His Majesty Kuang-Hsü\r\n    has ascended on high, dragon-borne, and he also has left no\r\n    heir. I am, therefore, now obliged to decree that P’u Yi, son\r\n    of Tsai Feng, the ‘Prince co-operating in the Government,’\r\n    should become heir by adoption to the Emperor T’ung-Chih, and\r\n    that, at the same time, he should perform joint sacrifices at\r\n    the shrine of His Majesty Kuang-Hsü.”\r\n\r\nTo those who are acquainted with the tangled web of Chinese Court\r\nceremonial and the laws of succession, it would seem that so simple (and\r\nso new) an expedient might suitably have been adopted on previous similar\r\noccasions, since all that was required was to make the individual living\r\nEmperor assume a dual personality towards the dead, and one cannot help\r\nwondering whether the classical priestcraft which controls these things\r\nwould have accepted the solution so readily at the hands of anyone less\r\nmasterful and determined than Tzŭ Hsi.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent Decree the Empress Dowager handed over to the Regent full\r\ncontrol in all routine business, reserving only to herself the last word\r\nin all important matters of State. The effect of this arrangement was\r\nto place Prince Ch’un in much the same position of nominal sovereignty\r\nas that held by Kuang-Hsü himself, until such time as the young Emperor\r\nshould come of age, or until the death of the Empress Dowager. In other\r\nwords, Tzŭ Hsi had once more put in operation the machinery by which she\r\nhad acquired and held the supreme power since the death of her husband,\r\nthe Emperor Hsien-Feng. There is little doubt that at this moment she\r\nfully expected to live for many years more, and that she made her plans\r\nso as to enjoy to the end uninterrupted and undiminished authority.\r\nIn her Decree on this subject, wherein, as usual, she justifies her\r\nproceedings by reference to the critical condition of affairs, she states\r\nthat the Regent is to carry on the Government “subject always to the\r\ninstructions of the Empress Dowager,” and there can be no doubt that\r\nhad she lived the Emperor’s brother would no more have been permitted\r\nany independent initiative or authority than the unfortunate Kuang-Hsü\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nTZŬ HSI’S DEATH AND BURIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of a long and exciting day, Her Majesty retired to rest\r\non the 14th of November, weary with her labours but apparently much\r\nimproved in health. Next morning she arose at her usual hour, 6 A.M.,\r\ngave audience to the Grand Council and talked for some time with the late\r\nEmperor’s widow, with the Regent and with his wife, the daughter of Jung\r\nLu. By a Decree issued in the name of the infant Emperor, she assumed the\r\ntitle of Empress Grand Dowager, making Kuang-Hsü’s widow Empress Dowager.\r\nElaborate ceremonies were planned to celebrate the bestowal of these\r\nnew titles, and to proclaim the installation of the Regent. Suddenly,\r\nat noon, while sitting at her meal, the Old Buddha was seized with a\r\nfainting fit, long and severe. When at last she recovered consciousness,\r\nit was clear to all that the stress and excitement of the past few days\r\nhad brought on a relapse, her strength having been undermined by the\r\nlong attack of dysentery. Realising that her end was near, she hurriedly\r\nsummoned the new Empress Dowager, the Regent and the Grand Council to the\r\nPalace, where, upon their coming together, she dictated the following\r\nDecree, speaking in the same calm tones which she habitually used in\r\ntransacting the daily routine of Government work:—\r\n\r\n    “By command of the Empress Grand Dowager: Yesterday I issued an\r\n    Edict whereby Prince Ch’un was made Regent, and I commanded\r\n    that the whole business of Government should be in his hands,\r\n    subject only to my instructions. Being seized of a mortal\r\n    sickness, and being without hope of recovery, I now order that\r\n    henceforward the government of the Empire shall be entirely in\r\n    the hands of the Regent. Nevertheless, should there arise any\r\n    question of vital importance, in regard to which an expression\r\n    of the Empress Dowager’s opinion is desirable, the Regent shall\r\n    apply in person to her for instructions, and act accordingly.”\r\n\r\nThe significance of the conclusion of this Decree is apparent to anyone\r\nfamiliar with Chinese Court procedure and with the life history of the\r\nEmpress herself. Its ingenious wording was expressly intended to afford\r\nto the new Empress Dowager and the Yehonala Clan an opportunity for\r\nintervention at any special crisis, thus maintaining the Clan’s final\r\nauthority and safeguarding its position in the event of any hostile\r\nmove by the Regent or his adherents. And the result of this precaution\r\nhas already been shown on the occasion of the recent dismissal of Tuan\r\nFang[129] from the Viceroyalty of Chihli for alleged want of respect\r\nin connection with the funeral ceremonies of the Empress Dowager, an\r\nepisode which showed clearly that the Regent has no easy game to play,\r\nand that the new Empress Dowager, Lung Yu, has every intention to defend\r\nthe position of the Clan and to take advantage thereof along lines very\r\nsimilar to those followed by her august predecessor.\r\n\r\nAfter issuing the Decree above quoted, the Empress Dowager, rapidly\r\nsinking, commanded that her valedictory Decree be drafted and submitted\r\nto her for approval. This was done quickly. After perusing the document,\r\nshe proceeded to correct it in several places, notably by the addition\r\nof the sentence, “It became my inevitable and bounden duty to assume the\r\nRegency.” Commenting on this addition, she volunteered the explanation\r\nthat she wished it inserted because on more than one occasion her\r\nassumption of the supreme power had been wrongfully attributed to\r\npersonal ambition, whereas, as a matter of fact, the welfare of the State\r\nhad always weighed with her as much as her own inclinations, and she had\r\nbeen forced into this position. From her own pen also came the touching\r\nconclusion of the Decree, that sentence which begins: “Looking back over\r\nthe memories of these fifty years,” etc. She observed, in writing this,\r\nthat she had nothing to regret in her life, and could only wish that\r\nit might have lasted for many years more. She then proceeded to bid an\r\naffectionate farewell to her numerous personal attendants and the waiting\r\nmaids around her, all of whom were overcome by very real and deep grief.\r\nTo the end her mind remained quite clear, and, at the very point of\r\ndeath, she continued to speak as calmly as if she were just about to set\r\nout on one of her progresses to the Summer Palace. Again and again, when\r\nall thought the end had come, she recovered consciousness, and up to the\r\nend the watchers at her bedside could not help hoping (or fearing, as\r\nthe case might be with them) that she would yet get the better of Death.\r\nAt the last, _in articulo mortis_, they asked her, in accordance with\r\nthe Chinese custom, to pronounce her last words. Strangely significant\r\nwas the answer of the extraordinary woman who had moulded and guided the\r\ndestinies of the Chinese people for half a century: “Never again,” she\r\nsaid, “allow any woman to hold the supreme power in the State. It is\r\nagainst the house-law of our Dynasty and should be strictly forbidden. Be\r\ncareful not to permit eunuchs to meddle in Government matters. The Ming\r\nDynasty was brought to ruin by eunuchs, and its fate should be a warning\r\nto my people.” Tzŭ Hsi died, as she had lived, above the law, yet jealous\r\nof its fulfilment by others. Only a few hours before she had provided\r\nfor the transmission of authority to a woman of her own clan: now,\r\nconfronting the dark Beyond, she hesitated to perpetuate a system which,\r\nin any but the strongest hands, could not fail to throw the Empire into\r\nconfusion. She died, as she had lived, a creature of impulse and swiftly\r\nchanging moods, a woman of infinite variety.\r\n\r\nAt 3 P.M., straightening her limbs, she expired with her face to the\r\nsouth, which is the correct position, according to Chinese ideas, for a\r\ndying sovereign. It was reported by those who saw her die that her mouth\r\nremained fixedly open, which the Chinese interpret as a sign that the\r\nspirit of the deceased is unwilling to leave the body and to take its\r\ndeparture for the place of the Nine Springs.\r\n\r\nThus died Tzŭ Hsi; and when her ladies and handmaidens had dressed the\r\nbody in its Robes of State, embroidered with the Imperial Dragon, her\r\nremains and those of the Emperor were borne from the Lake Palace to the\r\nForbidden City, through long lines of their kneeling subjects, and were\r\nreverently laid in separate Halls of the Palace, with all due state and\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nThe valedictory Decree of Tzŭ Hsi, the last words from that pen which had\r\nindeed been mightier than many swords, was for the most part a faithful\r\nreproduction of the classical models, the orthodox swan song of the\r\nruler of a people which makes of its writings a religion. Its text is as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    _The Valedictory Mandate of Her Majesty Tz’ŭ-Hsi-Tuan-Yu-K’ang-I-\r\n    Chao-Yü-Chuang-Cheng-Shou-Kung-Ch’in-Hsien-Ch’ung-Hsi, the\r\n    Empress Grand Dowager, declareth as follows:—_\r\n\r\n    “I, of humble virtue, did reverently receive the appointment\r\n    of the late Emperor Hsien-Feng, which prepared for me a\r\n    place amongst his Consorts. When the late Emperor T’ung-Chih\r\n    succeeded in early childhood to the Throne, there was\r\n    rebellion still raging in the land, which was being vigorously\r\n    suppressed. Not only did the Taiping and turbaned rebels\r\n    engage in successive outbreaks, but disorder was spread by the\r\n    Kuei-chou aborigines and by Mahomedan bandits. The provinces\r\n    of the coast were in great distress, the people on the verge of\r\n    ruin, widespread distress confronting us on all sides.\r\n\r\n    “Co-operating then with the senior Consort of Hsien-Feng, the\r\n    Empress Dowager of the Eastern Palace, I undertook the heavy\r\n    duties of Government, toiling ever, day and night. Obeying\r\n    the behests of His late Majesty, my husband, I urged on the\r\n    Metropolitan and provincial officials, as well as the military\r\n    commanders, directing their policies and striving for the\r\n    restoration of peace. I employed virtuous officials and was\r\n    ever ready to listen to wise counsel. I relieved my people’s\r\n    distress in time of flood and famine. By the goodwill and\r\n    bounty of Heaven, I suppressed the rebellions and out of dire\r\n    peril restored peace. Later, when the Emperor T’ung-Chih passed\r\n    away and the Emperor Kuang-Hsü, now just deceased, entered by\r\n    adoption upon the great heritage, the crisis was even more\r\n    dangerous and the condition of the people even more pitiable.\r\n    Within the Empire calamities were rife, while from abroad we\r\n    were confronted by repeated and increasing acts of aggression.\r\n\r\n    “Once again it became my inevitable and bounden duty to assume\r\n    the Regency. Two years ago I issued a Decree announcing the\r\n    Throne’s intention to grant a Constitution, and this present\r\n    year I have promulgated the date at which it is to come into\r\n    effect. Innumerable affairs of State have required direction at\r\n    my hands and I have laboured without ceasing and with all my\r\n    might. Fortunately, my constitution was naturally strong, and\r\n    I have been able to face my duties with undiminished vigour.\r\n    During the summer and autumn of this year, however, I have\r\n    frequently been in bad health, at a time when pressing affairs\r\n    of State allowed me no repose. I lost my sleep and appetite,\r\n    and gradually my strength failed me. Yet even then I took no\r\n    rest, not for a single day. And yesterday saw the death of His\r\n    Majesty Kuang-Hsü; whereat my grief overwhelmed me. I can bear\r\n    no more, and so am I come to the pass where no possible hope of\r\n    recovery remains.\r\n\r\n    “Looking back upon the memories of these last fifty years,\r\n    I perceive how calamities from within and aggression from\r\n    without have come upon us in relentless succession, and that\r\n    my life has never enjoyed a moment’s respite from anxiety.\r\n    But to-day definite progress has been made towards necessary\r\n    reforms. The new Emperor is but an infant, just reaching the\r\n    age when wise instruction is of the highest importance. The\r\n    Prince Regent and all our officials must henceforth work\r\n    loyally together to strengthen the foundations of our Empire.\r\n    His Majesty must devote himself to studying the interests of\r\n    the country and so refrain from giving way to personal grief.\r\n    That he may diligently pursue his studies, and hereafter add\r\n    fresh lustre to the glorious achievements of his ancestors, is\r\n    now my most earnest prayer.\r\n\r\n    “Mourning to be worn for only twenty-seven days.\r\n\r\n    “Cause this to be everywhere known!\r\n\r\n                         “Tenth Moon, 23rd day (November the 15th).”\r\n\r\nThe title by which Her Majesty was canonised contains no less than\r\ntwenty-two characters, sixteen of which were hers at the day of her\r\ndeath, the other six having been added in the Imperial Decrees which\r\nrecorded her decease and praised her glorious achievements. The first\r\ncharacter “Dutiful”—_i.e._ to her husband—is always accorded to a\r\ndeceased Empress. It is significant of the unpractical nature of the\r\n_literati_, or of their cynicism, that the second of her latest titles\r\nsignifies “reverend,” implying punctilious adherence to ancestral\r\ntraditions! The third and fourth mean “Equal of Heaven,” which places her\r\non a footing of equality with Confucius, while the fifth and sixth raise\r\nher even higher than the Sage in the national Pantheon, for it means\r\n“Increase in Sanctity,” of which Confucius was only a “Manifestor.” In\r\nthe records of the Dynasty she will henceforth be known as the Empress\r\n“Dutiful, Reverend and Glorious,” a title, according to the laws of\r\nChinese honorifics, higher than any woman ruler has hitherto received\r\nsince the beginning of history.\r\n\r\nSince her death the prestige of the Empress Dowager, and her hold on\r\nthe imagination of the people, have grown rather than decreased. Around\r\nher coffin, while it lay first in her Palace of Peaceful Longevity and\r\nlater in a hall at the foot of the Coal Hill, north of the Forbidden\r\nCity, awaiting the appointed day propitious for burial, there gathered\r\nsomething more than the conventional regrets and honours which fall\r\nusually to the lot of China’s rulers. Officials as well as people\r\nfelt that with her they had lost the strong hand of guidance, and a\r\npersonality which appealed to most of them as much from the human as from\r\nthe official point of view. Their affectionate recollections of the Old\r\nBuddha were clearly shown by the elaborate sacrifices paid to her _manes_\r\nat various periods from the day of her death to that day, a year later,\r\nwhen her ancestral tablet was brought home to the Forbidden City from the\r\nImperial tombs with all pomp and circumstance.\r\n\r\nOn the All Souls’ day of the Buddhists, celebrated in the 7th Moon, and\r\nwhich fell in the September following her death, a magnificent barge made\r\nof paper and over a hundred and fifty feet long was set up outside the\r\nForbidden City on a large empty space adjoining the Coal Hill. It was\r\ncrowded with figures of attendant eunuchs and handmaidens, and contained\r\nfurniture and viands for the use of the illustrious dead in the lower\r\nregions. A throne was placed in the bows, and around it were kneeling\r\neffigies of attendant officials all wearing their Robes of State as if\r\nthe shade of Tzŭ Hsi were holding an audience.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the All Souls’ festival the Regent, in the name of the\r\nEmperor, performed sacrifice before the barge, which was then set alight\r\nand burnt, in order that the Old Buddha might enjoy the use of it at the\r\n“yellow springs.” A day or two before her funeral, hundreds of paper\r\neffigies of attendants, cavalry, camels and other pack animals, were\r\nsimilarly burnt so that her spirit might enjoy all the pomp to which she\r\nhad been accustomed in life.\r\n\r\nThe following account of her funeral is reproduced from _The Times_ of\r\n27th November, 1909:—\r\n\r\n    “The 9th of November at 5 A.M. was the hour of good omen\r\n    originally chosen by the Astrologers for the departure of the\r\n    remains of Her late Majesty the Empress Dowager from their\r\n    temporary resting place in the Forbidden City to the mausoleum\r\n    prepared for her at the Eastern Hills. To meet the convenience\r\n    of the foreign representatives, the hour was subsequently\r\n    changed to 7 A.M.\r\n\r\n    “The arrangements for the procession and the part taken therein\r\n    by the Diplomatic Body, were generally similar to those of the\r\n    funeral of His Majesty Kuang-Hsü, but the mounted troops were\r\n    more numerous and better turned out, the police were noticeably\r\n    smarter and well-dressed, and the pageant as a whole was in\r\n    many respects more imposing. But for those who, in May last,\r\n    witnessed the late Emperor’s funeral, the scene lacked one\r\n    element of its brilliantly picturesque effect, namely, the\r\n    bright sunshine which on that occasion threw every detail and\r\n    distinctive note of the _cortège_ into clear relief against\r\n    the grey background of the Palace walls. The day was cold,\r\n    with lowering clouds, and the long delay which preceded the\r\n    appearance of the catafalque at the point where the Diplomatic\r\n    Body was stationed had an inevitably depressing effect on the\r\n    spectators.\r\n\r\n    “The catafalque was borne by eighty-four bearers, the largest\r\n    number which can carry this unwieldy burden through the City\r\n    gates; but beyond the walls the coffin was transferred to a\r\n    larger bier borne by one hundred and twenty men. In front\r\n    walked the Prince Regent, the bodyguard of Manchu Princes and\r\n    the members of the Grand Council, attended by the Secretariat\r\n    staff. Behind rode first a smart body of troops, followed\r\n    by a large number of camels whose Mongol attendants carried\r\n    tent-poles and other articles for use in the erection of the\r\n    ‘matshed palaces,’ wherein the coffin rests at night at the\r\n    different stages of the four days’ journey to the tombs. Behind\r\n    the Mongols were borne in procession the gaudy honorific\r\n    umbrellas presented to the Old Buddha on the occasion of\r\n    her return from exile at Hsi-an fu in 1901: all these were\r\n    burnt on the 16th instant when the body was finally entombed.\r\n    Following the waving umbrellas came a body of Lama dignitaries,\r\n    and after them a contingent from the Imperial Equipage\r\n    Department bearing Manchu sacrificial vessels, Buddhist symbols\r\n    and embroidered banners. Conspicuous in the _cortège_ were\r\n    three splendid chariots with trappings and curtains of Imperial\r\n    yellow silk, emblazoned with dragons and phœnixes, and two\r\n    palanquins similar to those used by the Empress Dowager on her\r\n    journeys in State; these also were burned at the mausoleum.\r\n    Noticeable figures in the procession were the six chief\r\n    eunuchs, including the notorious Li Lien-ying and the short\r\n    handsome attendant who usually accompanied the Empress’s sedan\r\n    chair. The spectacle, as a whole, was most impressive; no\r\n    such pomp and circumstance, say the Chinese, has marked the\r\n    obsequies of any Empress of China since the funeral of the\r\n    Empress Wu (_circa_ A.D. 700) of whom the annals record that\r\n    hundreds of attendants were buried alive in her mausoleum.\r\n\r\n    “The police arrangements attracted general attention by their\r\n    remarkable efficiency, which many Chinese attribute to the\r\n    present Empress Dowager’s constant fear of assassination. Every\r\n    closed door along the route of the procession was closely\r\n    guarded by soldiers and special precautions taken against\r\n    bomb-throwing. The street guards were numerous and alert, and\r\n    the arrangements generally were characterised by discipline and\r\n    decorum. There was little confusion in the _cortège_, and none\r\n    of the unseemly shouting usual on such occasions.\r\n\r\n    “Ninety miles away, in a silent spot surrounded by virgin pine\r\n    forest and backed by protecting hills, are the Eastern Tombs,\r\n    towards which, for four days, the great catafalque made its\r\n    way along the yellow-sanded road. There stands the mausoleum,\r\n    originally built by the faithful Jung Lu for his Imperial\r\n    Mistress at a cost which stands in the government records at\r\n    eight millions of taels. It is close to the ‘Ting Ling,’ the\r\n    burial-place of her husband, the Emperor Hsien-Feng. To the\r\n    west of it stands the tomb of her colleague and co-Regent (the\r\n    Empress Tzŭ An), and on the east that of the first Consort\r\n    of Hsien-Feng, who died before his accession to the Throne,\r\n    and was subsequently canonised as Empress. Throughout her\r\n    lifetime, and particularly of late years, Yehonala took great\r\n    interest and pride in her last resting-place, visiting it at\r\n    intervals and exacting the most scrupulous attention from those\r\n    entrusted with its building and adornment. On one occasion, in\r\n    1897, when practically completed, she had it rebuilt because\r\n    the teak pillars were not sufficiently massive. After the\r\n    death of Jung Lu, Prince Ch’ing became responsible for the\r\n    custody of the tomb and its precious contents—the sacrificial\r\n    vessels of carved jade, the massive vases and incense burners\r\n    of gold and silver, which adorn the mortuary chamber; the\r\n    richly-jewelled couch to receive the coffin, and the carved\r\n    figures of serving maids and eunuchs who stand for ever in\r\n    attendance. After the last ceremony at the tomb, when the\r\n    Princes, Chamberlains and high officials had taken their final\r\n    farewell of the illustrious dead, while the present Empress\r\n    Dowager, with her attendants and the surviving consorts of the\r\n    Emperors Hsien-Feng and T’ung-Chih, offered the last rites in\r\n    the mortuary chamber, the massive stone door of the tomb was\r\n    let down and the resting-place of Tzŭ Hsi closed for ever.\r\n\r\n    “The cost of the late Emperor’s funeral has been officially\r\n    recorded, with the nice accuracy which characterises Chinese\r\n    finance, at 459,940 taels, 2 mace, 3 candareens and 6 li. As\r\n    the cost of a funeral in China closely reflects the dignity of\r\n    the deceased and the “face” of his or her immediate survivors,\r\n    these figures become particularly interesting when compared\r\n    with the cost of the Empress Dowager’s funeral, which is\r\n    placed at one and a-quarter to one and a-half million taels.\r\n    Rumour credited the Regent with an attempt to cut down this\r\n    expenditure, which attempt he abandoned at the last moment in\r\n    the face of the displeasure of the powerful Yehonala Clan. That\r\n    the Old Buddha’s magnificent funeral was appreciated by the\r\n    populace of Peking is certain, for to them she was for fifty\r\n    years a sympathetic personality and a great ruler.\r\n\r\n    “The conveyance of Her Majesty’s ancestral tablet from the\r\n    tombs of the Eastern Hills to its resting-place in the Temple\r\n    of Ancestors in the Forbidden City was a ceremony in the\r\n    highest degree impressive and indicative of the vitality of\r\n    those feelings which make ancestor-worship the most important\r\n    factor in the life of the Chinese. The tablet, a simple strip\r\n    of carved and lacquered wood, bearing the name of the deceased\r\n    in Manchu and Chinese characters, had been officially present\r\n    at the burial. With the closing of the great door of the tomb\r\n    the spirit of the departed ruler is supposed to be translated\r\n    to the tablet, and to the latter is therefore given honour\r\n    equal to that which was accorded to the sovereign during\r\n    her lifetime. Borne aloft in a gorgeous chariot draped with\r\n    Imperial yellow silk and attended by a large mounted escort,\r\n    Tzŭ Hsi’s tablet journeyed slowly and solemnly, in three days’\r\n    stages, from the Eastern Hills to Peking. At each stage it\r\n    rested for the night in a specially constructed pavilion, being\r\n    ‘invited’ by the Master of the Ceremonies, on his knees and\r\n    with all solemnity, to be pleased to leave its chariot and\r\n    rest. For the passage of this habitation of the spirit of the\r\n    mighty dead the Imperial road had been specially prepared and\r\n    swept by an army of men; it had become a _via sacra_ on which\r\n    no profane feet might come or go. As the procession bearing the\r\n    sacred tablet drew near to the gates of the capital, the Prince\r\n    Regent and all the high officers of the Court knelt reverently\r\n    to receive it. All traffic was stopped; every sound stilled in\r\n    the streets, where the people knelt to do homage to the memory\r\n    of the Old Buddha. Slowly and solemnly the chariot was borne\r\n    through the main gate of the Forbidden City to the Temple of\r\n    the Dynasty’s ancestors, the most sacred spot in the Empire,\r\n    where it was ‘invited’ to take its appointed place among the\r\n    nine Ancestors and their thirty-five Imperial Consorts. Before\r\n    this could be done, however, it was necessary that the tablets\r\n    of Tzŭ Hsi’s son, T’ung-Chih, and of her daughter-in-law,\r\n    should first be removed from that august assembly, because\r\n    due ceremony required that the arriving tablet should perform\r\n    obeisance to those of its ancestors, and it would not be\r\n    fitting for the tablet of a parent to perform this ceremony in\r\n    the presence of that of a son or daughter-in-law. The act of\r\n    obeisance was performed by deputy, in the person of the Regent\r\n    acting for the child Emperor, and consisted of nine kowtows\r\n    before each tablet in the Temple, or about 400 prostrations in\r\n    all. When these had been completed, with due regard to the\r\n    order of seniority of the deceased, the tablets of the Emperor\r\n    T’ung-Chih and his wife were formally ‘invited’ to return to\r\n    the Temple, where obeisance was made on their behalf to the\r\n    shade of Tzŭ Hsi which had been placed in the shrine beside\r\n    that of her former colleague and co-Regent, the Empress Tzŭ\r\n    An. Thus ended the last ceremonial act of the life and death\r\n    of this remarkable woman; but her spirit still watches over\r\n    the Forbidden City and the affairs of her people, who firmly\r\n    believe that it will in due time guide the nation to a happy\r\n    issue out of all their afflictions. As time goes on, the\r\n    weaknesses of her character and the errors of her career are\r\n    forgotten, and her greatness only remembered. And no better\r\n    epitaph could be written for this great Manchu than that of her\r\n    own valedictory Decree which, rising above all the pettiness\r\n    and humiliations of her reign, looking death and change\r\n    steadfastly in the face, raises her in our eyes (to quote a\r\n    writer in the _Spectator_)[130] ‘to that vague ideal state of\r\n    human governance imagined by the Greek, when the Kings should\r\n    be philosophers and the philosophers Kings.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARBLE BRIDGE OVER THE LAKE IN THE WESTERN PARK WHICH\r\nSURROUNDS THE LAKE PALACE.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Betines, Peking._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “TI WANG MIAO” OR TEMPLE TO THE MEMORY OF VIRTUOUS\r\nEMPERORS OF PREVIOUS DYNASTIES.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Betines, Peking._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n“All sweeping judgments,” says Coleridge, “are unjust.” “_Comprendre_,”\r\nsays the French philosopher, “_c’est tout pardonner_.” To understand the\r\nlife and personality of the Empress Dowager, it is before everything\r\nessential to divest our minds of racial prejudice and to endeavour to\r\nappreciate something of the environment and traditions to which she was\r\nborn. In the words of the thoughtful article in the _Spectator_, already\r\nquoted, “she lived and worked and ruled in a setting which is apart from\r\nall western modes of thought and standards of action, and the first step\r\nin the historian’s task is to see that she is judged by her own standards\r\nand not wholly by ours.” Judged by the rough test of public opinion and\r\naccumulating evidence in her own country, Tzŭ Hsi’s name will go down to\r\nhistory in China as that of a genius in statecraft and a born ruler, a\r\nwoman “with all the courage of a man, and more than the ordinary man’s\r\nintelligence.”[131]\r\n\r\nPending that reform and liberty of the press which is still the distant\r\ndream of “Young China,” no useful record of the life and times of the\r\nEmpress Dowager is to be expected from any Chinese writer. Despite\r\nthe mass of information which exists in the diaries and archives of\r\nmetropolitan officials and the personal reminiscences of those who knew\r\nher well, nothing of any human interest or value has been published on\r\nthe subject in China. From the official and orthodox point of view, a\r\ntruthful biography of the Empress would be sacrilege. It is true that\r\nin the vernacular newspapers under European protection at the Treaty\r\nPorts, as well as in Hongkong and Singapore, Cantonese writers have\r\ngiven impressions of Her Majesty’s personality and brief accounts of\r\nher life, but these are so hopelessly biassed and distorted by hatred\r\nof the Manchus as to be almost worthless for historical purposes, as\r\nworthless as the dry chronicles of the Dynastic annals. Reference has\r\nalready been made to the best known of these publications, a series of\r\nletters originally published in a Singapore newspaper and republished\r\nunder the title of “The Chinese Crisis from within,”[132] by a writer\r\nwho, under the _nom-de-plume_ of “Wen Ching,” concealed the identity of\r\none of K’ang Yu-wei’s most ardent disciples. His work is remarkable for\r\nsustained invective and reckless inaccuracy, clearly intended to create\r\nan atmosphere of hatred against the Manchus (for the ultimate benefit\r\nof the Cantonese) in the minds of his countrymen, and to dissuade the\r\nforeign Powers from allowing the Empress to return to Peking. Drawing on\r\na typically Babu store of “western learning,” this writer compares the\r\nEmpress to Circe, Semiramis, Catherine de Medici, Messalina, Fulvia, and\r\nJulia Agrippina; quoting Dante and Rossetti to enforce his arguments, and\r\nleavening his vituperation with a modicum of verifiable facts sufficient\r\nto give to his narrative something of _vraisemblance_. But his judgment\r\nis emphatically sweeping. He ignores alike Tzŭ Hsi’s undeniable good\r\nqualities and her extenuating circumstances, the defects of her education\r\nand the difficulties of her position, so that his work is almost\r\nvalueless.\r\n\r\nEqually valueless, for purposes of historical accuracy, are most of the\r\naccounts and impressions of the Empress recorded by those Europeans\r\n(especially the ladies of the Diplomatic Body and their friends) who\r\nsaw her personality and purposes reflected in the false light which\r\nbeats upon the Dragon Throne on ceremonial occasions, or who came under\r\nthe influence of the deliberate artifices and charm of manner which she\r\nassumed so well. Had the etiquette of her Court and people permitted\r\nintercourse with European diplomats and distinguished visitors of\r\nthe male sex, she would certainly have acquired, and exercised over\r\nthem also, that direct personal influence which emanated from her\r\nextraordinary vitality and will-power, influence such as the western\r\nworld has learned to associate with the names of the Emperor William of\r\nGermany and Mr. Roosevelt. Restricted as she was to social relations with\r\nher own sex amongst foreigners, she exerted herself, and never failed,\r\nto produce on them an impression of womanly grace and gentleness of\r\ndisposition, which qualities we find accordingly praised by nearly all\r\nwho came in contact with her after the return of the Court, aye, even by\r\nthose who had undergone the horrors of the siege under the very walls\r\nof her Palace. The glamour of her mysterious Court, the rarity of the\r\nvisions vouchsafed, the real charm of her manner, and the apparently\r\nartless _bonhomie_ of her bearing, all combined to create in the minds\r\nof the European ladies who saw her an impression as favourable as it\r\nwas opposed to every dictate of common sense and experience. In certain\r\nnotable instances, the effect of this impression reacted visibly on the\r\ncourse of the Peace Protocol negotiations.\r\n\r\nFrom the diary of Ching Shan we obtain an estimate of Tzŭ Hsi’s\r\ncharacter, formed by one who had enjoyed for years continual\r\nopportunities of studying her at close quarters—an estimate which\r\nwas, and is, confirmed by the popular verdict, the common report of\r\nthe tea-houses and market places of the capital. Despite her swiftly\r\nchanging and uncontrolled moods, her childish lack of moral sense, her\r\nunscrupulous love of power, her fierce passions and revenges, Tzŭ Hsi\r\nwas no more the savage monster described by “Wen Ching,” than she was\r\nthe benevolent, fashion-plate Lady Bountiful of the American magazines.\r\nShe was simply a woman of unusual courage and vitality, of strong will\r\nand unbounded ambition, a woman and an Oriental, living out her life by\r\nsuch lights as she knew, and in accordance with the traditions of her\r\nrace and caste. Says Ching Shan in the Diary: “_The nature of the Empress\r\nis peace-loving: she has seen many springs and autumns. I myself know\r\nwell her refined and gentle tastes, her love of painting, poetry and\r\nthe theatre. When in a good mood she is the most amiable and tractable\r\nof women, but at times her rage is awful to witness._” Here we have\r\nthe woman drawn from life, without _arrière pensée_, by a just but\r\nsympathetic observer, the woman who could win, and hold, the affectionate\r\nloyalty of the greatest men of her time, not to speak of that of her\r\nretainers and serving maids; the woman whose human interest and sympathy\r\nin everything around her, were not withered by age nor staled by custom;\r\nyet who, at a word, could send the fierce leaders of the Boxers cowering\r\nfrom her presence. _Souvent femme varie._ Tzŭ Hsi, her own mistress and\r\nvirtual ruler of the Empire at the age of twenty-four, had not had much\r\noccasion to learn to control either her moods or her passions. Hers,\r\nfrom the first, was the trick and temper of autocracy. Trained in the\r\ntraditions of a Court where human lives count for little, where power\r\nmaintains itself by pitiless and brutal methods, where treason and\r\nfoul deeds lie in waiting for the first signs of the ruler’s weakness,\r\nhow should she learn to put away from the Forbidden City the hideous\r\nbarbarities of its ways?\r\n\r\nLet us remember her time and place. Consider the woman’s environment and\r\ntraining, her marriage to a dissolute puppet, her subsequent life in that\r\ngilded prison of the Imperial City, with its endless formalities, base\r\nintrigues and artificial sins. Prior to the establishment of China’s\r\nfirst diplomatic relations with European nations, the Court of Peking\r\nand its ways bore a strong resemblance to those of Medieval Europe;\r\nnor have successive routs and invasions since that date changed any of\r\nits cherished traditions and methods. In the words of a recent writer\r\non medieval history, the life of the Peking Palace, like that of our\r\nfourteenth century, “was one of profound learning and crass stupidity,\r\nof infantile gaiety and sudden tragedy, of flashing fortunes and swift\r\ndooms. There is a certain innocence about the very sinners of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Many of their problems, indeed,\r\narose from the fact that this same childlike candour was allied to the\r\nunworn forces of full manhood.” Whatever crimes of cruelty and vengeance\r\nTzŭ Hsi committed—and they were many—be it said to her credit that she\r\nhad, as a rule, the courage of her convictions and position, and sinned\r\n_coram publico_. Beneath the fierceness without which an Oriental ruler\r\ncannot hope to remain effective, there certainly beat a heart which could\r\nbe kind, if the conditions were propitious, and a rough sense of humour,\r\nwhich is a common and pleasing trait of the Manchus.\r\n\r\nLet us also remember that in the East to-day (as it was with us of Europe\r\nbefore the growth of that humanitarianism which now shows signs of\r\nunhealthy exaggeration) pain and death are part of the common, every-day\r\nrisks of life, risks lightly incurred by the average Oriental in the\r\ngreat game of ambitions, loves and hates that is for ever played around\r\nthe Throne. Tzŭ Hsi played her royal part in the great game, but it is\r\nnot recorded of her that she ever took life from sheer cruelty or love of\r\nkilling. When she sent a man to death, it was because he stood between\r\nher and the full and safe gratification of her love of power. When her\r\nfierce rage was turned against the insolence of the foreigner, she had\r\nno scruple in consigning every European in China to the executioner;\r\nwhen the Emperor’s favourite concubine disputed her Imperial authority,\r\nshe had no hesitation in ordering her to immediate death; but in every\r\nrecorded instance, except one, her methods were swift, clean, and,\r\nfrom the Oriental point of view, not unmerciful. She had no liking for\r\ntortures, or the lingering death. In all her Decrees of vengeance, we\r\nfind the same unhesitating firmness in removing human obstacles from her\r\npath, combined with a complete absence of that unnecessary cruelty which\r\nis so frequently associated with despotism. Her methods, in fact, were\r\nElizabethan rather than Florentine.\r\n\r\nIf Tzŭ Hsi developed self-reliance early in life, the fact is not to\r\nbe wondered at, for it was little help that she had to look for in her\r\nentourage of Court officials. Amongst the effete classical scholars, the\r\nfat-paunched Falstaffs, the opium sots, doddering fatalists and corrupt\r\nparasites of the Imperial Clans, she seems, indeed, to have been an\r\nanachronism, a “cast-back” to the virility and energy that won China for\r\nher sturdy ancestors. She appeared to be the born and inevitable ruler\r\nof the degenerate Dynasty, and if she became a law unto herself, it was\r\nlargely because there were few about her fit to lead or to command.\r\n\r\nImbued with a very feminine love of luxury, addicted to pleasure, and at\r\none period of her life undoubtedly licentious after the manner of her\r\nCourt’s traditions, she combined these qualities with a shrewd common\r\nsense and a marked penchant for acquiring and amassing personal property.\r\nTo use her own phrase, she endeavoured in all things to observe the\r\nprinciple of the “happy mean,” and seldom allowed her love of pleasure to\r\nobscure her vision or to hinder her purposes in the serious businesses of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLike many great rulers of the imperious and militant type, she was\r\nremarkably superstitious, a punctilious observer of the rites prescribed\r\nfor averting omens and conciliating the myriad gods and demons of\r\nthe several religions of China, a liberal supporter of priests and\r\nsoothsayers. Nevertheless, as with Elizabeth of England, her secular\r\ninstincts were _au fond_ stronger than all her superstitions. That sturdy\r\ncommon sense, which played so successfully upon the weaknesses and the\r\npassions of her corrupt entourage, never allowed any consideration for\r\nthe powers unseen to interfere seriously with her masterful handling of\r\nthings visible, or to curb her ruling passion for unquestioned authority.\r\n\r\nThe qualities which made up the remarkable personality of the Empress\r\nwere many and complex, but of those which chiefly contributed to her\r\npopularity and power we would place, first, her courage, and next, a\r\ncertain simplicity and directness—both qualities that stand out in strong\r\nrelief against the timorous and tortuous tendencies of the average\r\nManchu. Of her courage there could be no doubt; even amidst the chaos\r\nof the days of the Boxer terror it never failed her, and Ching Shan is\r\nonly one of many who bear witness to her unconquerable spirit and _sang\r\nfroid_. Amidst scenes of desolation and destruction that might well shake\r\nthe courage of the bravest men, we see her calmly painting bamboos on\r\nsilk, or giving orders to stop the bombardment of the Legations to allow\r\nof her excursion on the Lake. How powerful is the dramatic quality of\r\nthat scene where she attacks and dominates the truculent Boxer leaders\r\nat her very doors; or again when, on the morning of the flight, she\r\nalone preserves presence of mind, and gives her orders as coolly as if\r\nstarting on a picnic! At such moments all the defects of her training\r\nand temperament are forgotten in the irresistible appeal of her nobler\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nOf those qualities, and of her divine right to rule, Tzŭ Hsi herself was\r\nfully convinced, and no less determined than His Majesty of Germany, to\r\ninsist upon proper recognition and respect for herself and her commanding\r\nplace in the scheme of the universe. Her belief in her own supreme\r\nimportance, and her superstitious habit of thought were both strikingly\r\ndisplayed on the occasion when her portrait, painted by Miss Carl for\r\nthe St. Louis Exposition, was taken from the Waiwupu on its departure to\r\nthe United States. She regarded this presentment of her august person as\r\nentitled, in all seriousness of ceremonial, to the same reverence as\r\nherself and gave orders for the construction of a miniature railway, to\r\nbe built through the streets of the capital for its special benefit. By\r\nthis means the “sacred countenance” was carried upright, under its canopy\r\nof yellow silk, and Her Majesty was spared the thought of being borne in\r\neffigy on the shoulders of coolies—a form of progress too suggestively\r\nill-omened to be endured. Before the portrait left the Palace, the\r\nEmperor was summoned to prostrate himself before it, and at its passing\r\nthrough the city, and along the railway line, the people humbly knelt, as\r\nif it had been the Old Buddha of flesh and blood. Incidents of this kind\r\nemphasise the impossibility of fairly judging the Empress by European\r\nstandards of conduct and ideas. To get something of the proper atmosphere\r\nand perspective, we must go back to the early days of the Tudors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF THE EMPRESS DOWAGER.\r\n\r\nPainted from life by Miss Catharine A. Carl for the St. Louis Exposition,\r\nand now the property of the American Nation.\r\n\r\n(_Reproduced by permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nBlunt of speech herself, she was quick to detect and resent flattery.\r\nThose who rose highest in her affection and regard were essentially\r\nstrong men, blunt outspoken officials of the type of Jung Lu, Tseng\r\nKuo-fan, and Tso Tsung-t’ang; for those who would win her favour by\r\nsycophancy she had a profound contempt, which she was at no pains to\r\nconceal, though in certain instances (_e.g._, Chang Chih-tung) she\r\noverlooked the offence because of ripe scholarship or courage. An amusing\r\nexample of this trait in her character occurred on one occasion when,\r\nafter perusing the examination papers for the selection of successful\r\ncandidates for the Hanlin Literary degrees, she expressed herself in the\r\nfollowing trenchant Decree:—\r\n\r\n    “A certain candidate in the Hanlin examination, named Yen Chen,\r\n    has handed in some verses, the style of which is excellent,\r\n    but their subject matter contains a number of allusions\r\n    laudatory of the present Dynasty. This person has evidently\r\n    gone out of his way to refer to the present rulers of the\r\n    Empire, and has even seen fit to display gross flattery, for\r\n    his essay contains, amongst others, a sentence to the effect\r\n    that ‘we have now upon the Throne a female embodiment of Yao\r\n    and Shun.’[133] Now, the Throne defines merit in candidates\r\n    to-day on the same principles as those which were in force\r\n    under former Dynasties, its object being to form a correct\r\n    idea of the moral standards of candidates by perusal of their\r\n    essays and lyrical compositions. But this effort of Yen Chen\r\n    is nothing more than a laudatory ode, entirely lacking in high\r\n    seriousness. This is a grave matter: the question involved\r\n    is one closely affecting character and moral training; such\r\n    conduct cannot possibly be permitted to continue. The examiners\r\n    have placed Yen Chen at the top of the list in the First Class;\r\n    he is hereby relegated to the last place in that class. Let our\r\n    examiners for the future take more care in scrutinising the\r\n    papers submitted.”\r\n\r\nAs was only natural, Tzŭ Hsi was not above favouring her own people, the\r\nManchus, but one great secret of the solidity of her rule undoubtedly\r\nlay in her broad impartiality and the nice balance which she maintained\r\nbetween Chinese and Manchus in all departments of the Government. She\r\nhad realised that the brains and energy of the country must come from\r\nthe Chinese, and that if the Manchus were to retain their power and\r\nsinecure positions, it must be with the good will of the Chinese and the\r\nloyalty of the Mandarin class in the provinces. From the commencement\r\nof her rule, down to the day when she handed over her Boxer kinsmen to\r\nthe executioner, she never hesitated to inflict impartial punishment on\r\nManchus, when public opinion was against them. A case in point occurred\r\nin 1863, in connection with one of her favourite generals, named Sheng\r\nPao, who had gained her sincere gratitude by his share in the war\r\nagainst the British and French invaders in 1860, and who, by luck and\r\nthe ignorance of the Court, had been credited with having stopped the\r\nadvance of the Allies to Jehol. For these alleged services she had\r\nawarded him special thanks and high honour. In 1863, however, he was\r\nengaged in Shensi, fighting the Taipings, and, following a custom not\r\nunusual amongst Chinese military commanders, had asked leave to win over\r\none of the rebel leaders by giving him an important official position.\r\nTzŭ Hsi, who had had ample opportunities to learn something of the\r\ndanger of this procedure, declined to sanction his request, pointing out\r\nthe objections thereto. Sheng Pao ventured to suppress her Decree, and\r\ngave the rebel the position in question. Success might have justified\r\nhim, but the ex-bandit justified Tzŭ Hsi by going back on his word.\r\nAwaiting a good opportunity, he raised once more the standard of revolt,\r\nmassacred a number of officials, and captured several important towns.\r\nGeneral Sheng Pao was arrested and brought in custody to Peking; under\r\ncross-examination he confessed, amongst other misdemeanours, that he had\r\npermitted women to accompany the troops during this campaign, which, by\r\nChinese military law, is a capital offence. Other charges against him,\r\nhowever, he denied, and, preserving an insolent attitude, demanded to\r\nbe confronted with his accusers. Tzŭ Hsi issued a characteristically\r\nvigorous Decree in which she declared that the proper punishment for his\r\noffence was decapitation, but inasmuch as he had acquired merit by good\r\nwork against the Taipings, as well as against the British and French\r\ninvaders, she graciously granted him the privilege of committing suicide,\r\nof which he promptly availed himself.\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi, as we have said, was extremely superstitious; nor is this matter\r\nfor wonder when we bear in mind the medieval atmosphere of wizardous\r\nnecromancy and familiar spirits which she had perforce absorbed with her\r\nearliest education. Following the precepts of Confucius, she preserved\r\nalways a broad and tolerant attitude on all questions of religion, but,\r\nwhile reluctant to discuss things appertaining to the unknown gods,\r\nshe was always prepared to conciliate them, and to allow her actions\r\nin everyday affairs to be guided by the words of her wise men and\r\nastrologers—“by dreams, and by Urim and by prophets.” Thus we find her\r\nin the first year of the Regency of her son’s minority (1861) issuing, in\r\nhis name, a Decree, which carries back the mind irresistibly to Babylon\r\nand those days when the magicians and soothsayers were high personages in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n    “During the night of the 15th of the 7th Moon,” it begins,\r\n    “there occurred a flight of shooting stars in the southern\r\n    hemisphere; ten days later, a comet appeared twice in the sky\r\n    to the north-west. Heaven sends not these warnings in vain. For\r\n    the last month Peking has been visited by a grievous epidemic,\r\n    whereof the continued severity fills us with sore dismay.\r\n    The Empresses Dowager have now warned us that these portents\r\n    of Heaven are sent because of serious wrong in our system of\r\n    government, of errors unreformed and grievances unredressed,”\r\n    and the Decree ends by exhorting all concerned “to put away\r\n    frivolous things, so that Heaven, perceiving our reverend\r\n    attitude, may relent.”\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters we have shown with what punctilious attention she\r\nconsulted her astrologers in regard to the propitious day for re-entering\r\nher capital on the Court’s return from exile, her anxiety for scrupulous\r\nobservance of their advice being manifestly sincere. In her concern for\r\nomens and portents she seemed, like Napoleon, to obey instincts external\r\nand superior to another and very practical side of her nature, which,\r\nhowever, asserted itself unmistakably whenever vital issues were at\r\nstake and her supreme authority threatened. She was at all times anxious\r\nto secure the goodwill of the ancestral spirits, whose presence she\r\napprehended as a living reality, but even with these, when it came to\r\na direct issue between her own despotic authority and their claims to\r\nconsideration, she never hesitated to relegate the mighty dead to the\r\nbackground, content to appease them in due season by suitable expressions\r\nof reverence and regret. The most notable instance of this kind occurred\r\nwhen, disregarding the Dynastic laws of succession, she deprived\r\nher son, the Emperor T’ung-Chih, of the rites of ancestral worship,\r\ncommitting thus a crime which, as she well knew, was heinous in the eyes\r\nof the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nHer superstitious tendencies were most remarkably displayed in the\r\nmatter of the selection of the site of her tomb, and its building,\r\nan occasion of which the Court geomancers took full advantage. When\r\nT’ung-Chih reached his majority in 1873, his first duty was to escort the\r\nEmpresses Dowager to the Eastern Mausolea, where, with much solemnity,\r\ntwo auspicious sites, encircled by hills and watered by streams, were\r\nselected and exorcised of all evil influences. Further ceremonies and\r\nmystic calculations were required to determine the auspicious dates for\r\nthe commencement of building operations; in these, and the adornment of\r\nthe tomb, Tzŭ Hsi continued to take the keenest interest until the day\r\nof her death. In order to secure scrupulous regard for its construction\r\nin accordance with the requirements of her horoscope, and to make her\r\nsepulchre a fitting and all-hallowed resting-place, she entrusted its\r\nchief supervision to Jung Lu, who thus secured a permanent post highly\r\ncoveted by Manchu officials, in which huge “squeezes” were a matter of\r\nprecedent. The geomantic conditions of these burial places gave unusual\r\ntrouble, the tomb of the Empress Tzŭ An having eventually to be shifted\r\nfifteen feet two inches northwards, and four feet seven and a half inches\r\nwestwards, before the spirits of her ancestors were perfectly satisfied,\r\nwhile that of Tzŭ Hsi was removed seven feet four inches to the north and\r\neight inches to the eastward.\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi feared no man. From the first moment of her power, secure in the\r\nsense of divine right and firmly believing in her “star,” she savoured\r\nher authority like a rich wine. The pleasure she derived from delivering\r\nhomilies to the highest officials in the Empire may be read between\r\nthe lines of her Decrees. Already in 1862, that is to say, before she\r\nwas twenty-seven years of age, we find her solemnly admonishing the\r\nGrand Council on their duties, urging them to adopt stricter standards\r\nof conduct, and to put a check on their corrupt tendencies. “They are,\r\nof course, not debarred from seeking advice from persons below them\r\nin society, but let them be careful to avoid any attempt at forming\r\ncabals or attracting to themselves troops of followers.” And on another\r\noccasion, when she specially invited the Censors to impeach Prince\r\nKung, she observed: “In discussing the principles of just government\r\nyou should remember the precept of the Confucian school, which is,\r\n‘Be not weary in well-doing: strict rectitude of conduct is the road\r\nroyal to good government. Face and overcome your difficulties, and thus\r\neventually earn the right to ease.’” Tzŭ Hsi could turn out this sort of\r\nthing, which appeals to every Chinese scholar, in good style and large\r\nquantities. She took pride in the manufacture of maxims for the guidance\r\nof the Mandarins, but there was always a suspicion that her tongue was\r\nin her cheek while she carefully penned these copybook platitudes, just\r\nas we know there was when she set herself to display what _The Times_\r\ncorrespondent at Peking called her “girlish abandon,” in order to regain\r\nthe affection of Mrs. Conger and the ladies of the Diplomatic Body.\r\n\r\nOf the Empress Dowager’s popularity and prestige with all classes of her\r\nsubjects, there is no doubt. At Peking especially, and throughout the\r\nMetropolitan Province, she was the object of a very general and very\r\nsincere affection; seldom is her name spoken except with expressions of\r\nadmiration and regard, very similar in effect to the feelings of the\r\nBritish people for Her Majesty Queen Victoria. Although her share of\r\nresponsibility for the Boxer rising and for the consequent sufferings\r\ninflicted on the people was matter of common knowledge, little or no\r\nblame was ever imputed to the Old Buddha. Her subjects loved her for her\r\nvery defects, for the foolhardy courage that had staked the Empire on a\r\nthrow. Amongst the lower classes it was the general opinion that she\r\nhad done her best, and with the best intentions. The scheme itself was\r\nmagnificent—to drive the foreigner into the sea—and it appealed to her\r\npeople as worthy of their ruler and of a better fate. If it had failed\r\nfor this time, it was the will of Heaven, and no doubt at some future\r\ndate success would justify her wisdom. If they blamed her at all, it was\r\nfor condescending to intimate relations with the hated foreigner after\r\nthe Court’s return to Peking; but even in this, she had the sympathy\r\nrather than the censure of her subjects.\r\n\r\nTo the great mass of her people, who had never seen her, but knew\r\nher only by cumulative weight of common report, the Old Buddha stood\r\nfor the embodiment of courage, liberality and kindness of heart. If,\r\nas they knew, she were subject to fierce outbursts of sudden rage,\r\nthe fact did her no injury in the eyes of a race which believes that\r\nwrath-matter undischarged is a virulent poison in the system. The\r\nsimple Chihli folk made allowance, not without its sense of humour,\r\nfor their august sovereign’s capacity to generate wrath-matter, as\r\nfor her feminine mutability: To them she was a great ruler and a _bon\r\nenfant_. In a country where merciless officials and torture are part\r\nof the long-accepted order of things, no more stress was laid on her\r\nnumerous acts of cold blooded tyranny than, shall we say, was laid on the\r\nbeheading of Earls at the close of the fifteenth century in England.\r\n\r\nOne of the writers had the good fortune once to see the Empress when\r\nproceeding in her palanquin to the Eastern tombs. She had breakfasted\r\nearly at the Tung Yueh temple outside the Ch’i Hua gate, and was on\r\nher way to T’ung chou. As her chair passed along a line of kneeling\r\npeasantry, the curtains were open and it was seen that the Old Buddha was\r\nasleep. The good country people were delighted. “Look,” they cried, “the\r\nOld Buddha is sleeping. Really, she has far too much work to do! A rare\r\nwoman—what a pleasure to see her thus!”\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi was recognised to be above criticism and above the laws which\r\nshe rigorously enforced on others. For instance, when, a few weeks after\r\nthe issue of a Decree prohibiting corporal punishment and torture in\r\nprisons, she caused the Reformer Shen Chin to be flogged to death (July,\r\n1904), public opinion saw nothing extraordinary in the event. A few days\r\nlater, when preparations were being made for the celebration of her\r\nseventieth birthday, she issued another Decree, declining the honorific\r\ntitle dutifully proffered by the Emperor, together with its emoluments,\r\non the ground that she had no heart for festivities, “being profoundly\r\ndistressed at the thought of the sufferings of my subjects in Manchuria,\r\nowing to the destruction wrought there by the Russian and Japanese\r\narmies. My one desire,” she added, “is that my officials may co-operate\r\nto introduce more humane methods of Government, so that my people may\r\nlive to enjoy good old age, resting on couches of comfortable ease. This\r\nis the best way to honour the seventieth anniversary of my birth.” No\r\ndoubt the shade of Shen Chin was duly appeased.\r\n\r\nOf her vindictive ferocity on occasions there can be no question. As\r\nChing Shan admits, even her most faithful admirers and servants were\r\naware that at moments of her wrath it was prudent to be out of her reach,\r\nor, if unavoidably present, to abstain from thwarting her. They knew\r\nthat those who dared to question her absolute authority or to criticise\r\nthe means by which she gained and retained it, need look for no mercy.\r\nBut they knew also that for faithful service and loyalty she had a royal\r\nmemory and, like Catherine of Russia, she never forgot her friends.\r\n\r\nHer unpopularity in central and southern China, which became marked after\r\nthe war with Japan and violent at the time of the _coup d’état_, was\r\nin its origin anti-dynastic and political. It was particularly strong\r\nin Kuangtung, where for years Her Majesty was denounced by agitators\r\nas a monster of unparalleled depravity. The political opinions of the\r\nturbulent and quick-witted Cantonese have generally been expressed in a\r\nlively and somewhat ribald form, and when we bear in mind the popular\r\ntendency (not confined to the Far East) of ascribing gross immorality to\r\ncrowned heads, we are justified in refusing to attach undue importance\r\nto the wild accusations levelled against the Empress Dowager in this\r\nquarter. The utterances of the hotspurs and lampooners of southern\r\nChina are chiefly interesting in that they reveal something of the vast\r\npossibilities of cleavage inherent in the Chinese Government system, and\r\nprove the Manchu rule to have fallen into something like contempt in that\r\nregion where the new forces of education and political activity are most\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nOne of the doggerel verses current in 1898 fairly describes the\r\nattitude of the Cantonese man in the street towards the Dynasty. Freely\r\ntranslated, it runs thus:—\r\n\r\n    “_There are three questions which men must not ask about our\r\n    Great Manchu Dynasty:_\r\n\r\n    “_At what ancestral grave does His Majesty make filial\r\n    obeisance?_\r\n\r\n    “_To what deity does the Empress Dowager sacrifice?_\r\n\r\n    “_To what husbands are the Imperial Princesses married?_”\r\n\r\nThe first question is in allusion to the Emperor’s alleged doubtful\r\nparentage, while the second refers to a mythical New Year sacrifice, akin\r\nto those of Moloch, which the scurrilous Cantonese attributed to Tzŭ Hsi\r\nand the ladies of her Court. The last refers to the Manchu clan’s custom\r\nof intermarriage which, in the eyes of the Chinese (who disapprove even\r\nof marriage between persons of the same surname), is illegal and immoral.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are but local manifestations, and they lost much of\r\ntheir inspiration after the _coup d’état_. The anti-dynastic tendencies\r\nnoticeable in the vernacular press of Shanghai, many of which assumed the\r\nform of personal hostility to the Empress, were also little more than the\r\nlocal result of Young China’s vague aspirations and desire for change,\r\nand reflected little weight of serious opinion. The official class and\r\nthe _literati_ as a whole were loyal to Her Majesty and regarded her\r\nwith respect. They do not fail to express admiration of her wisdom and\r\nstatecraft, which kept the Empire together under circumstances of great\r\ndifficulty. To her selection and support of Tseng Kuo-fan they generally\r\nattribute China’s recovery from the disasters of the Taiping rebellion,\r\nand to her sagacity in 1898 they ascribe the country’s escape from\r\ndangers of sudden revolution. They admit that had it not been for her\r\nmasterly handling of the Tsai Yüan conspiracy (1860-61), it is doubtful\r\nwhether the Dynasty could have held together for a decade, and they\r\nrealise, now that her strong hand no longer grasps the helm, that the\r\nship of State is likely to drift into dangerous waters.\r\n\r\nThe everyday routine of Tzŭ Hsi’s life has been well described in Miss\r\nCarl’s accurate and picturesque account of the Palace ceremonial and\r\namusements,[134] the first authoritative picture of _la vie intime_ of\r\nthe Chinese Court. Apart from a keen natural aptitude for State affairs\r\n(similar to that of Queen Victoria, whom she greatly admired from afar),\r\nTzŭ Hsi maintained to the end of her days a lively interest in literature\r\nand art, together with a healthy and catholic appetite for amusement. She\r\nhad an inveterate love for the theatre, for masques and pageants, which\r\nshe indulged at all times and places, taking a professional interest in\r\nthe players and giving much advice about the performances, which she\r\nselected daily from a list submitted to her. It was a matter of comment,\r\nand some hostile criticism by Censors, that even during the sojourn of\r\nthe Court in the provincial wilderness at Hsi-an, she summoned actors to\r\nfollow the Court and perform as usual.\r\n\r\nHer private life had, no doubt, its phases. Of its details we know but\r\nlittle prior to the period of the restoration of the Summer Palace in the\r\nearly nineties. In middle age, however, when she had assimilated the\r\nphilosophy and practice of the “happy mean,” her tastes became simple and\r\nher habits regular. She was passionately fond of the Summer Palace, of\r\nits gardens and the lake amongst the hills, and towards the end of her\r\nlife went as seldom as possible into the city. She loved the freedom of\r\nthe I-ho Yüan, its absence of formal etiquette, her water-picnics and\r\nthe familiar intercourse of her favourite ladies, with whom she would\r\ndiscuss the day’s news and the gossip of the Imperial Clans. With these,\r\nespecially with the wife of Jung Lu and the Princess Imperial, she would\r\ntalk endlessly of old times and make plans for the future.\r\n\r\nHer love of literature and profound knowledge of history did much to win\r\nfor her the respect of the Mandarin class, with whom the classics are\r\na religion. In her reading she was, however, broad-minded, not to say\r\nomnivorous; it was her custom to spend a certain time daily in having\r\nancient and modern authors read aloud by eunuchs specially trained in\r\nelocution. She believed thoroughly in education, though realising clearly\r\nthe danger of putting new wine into old skins; and she perceived towards\r\nthe end of her life that the rapidly changing conditions of the Empire\r\nhad rendered the wisdom of China’s Sages of little practical value as\r\na basis of administration. Her clearness of perception on this point,\r\ncontrasted with her action in 1898, is indeed remarkable, but it should\r\nbe remembered that much of her opposition to the Emperor’s policy of\r\nreform was the result of personal pique and outraged dignity, as in the\r\ncase of her decision to become a Boxer leader in 1900. As far back as\r\n1876, at the time of the establishment of the T’ung Wen College at Peking\r\nfor the teaching of languages and science, we find her publicly rebuking\r\na Censor who had declared that mathematics was a subject suitable only\r\nfor the Court of Astronomers.\r\n\r\n“The Throne has established this College,” she observed, “because it is\r\nincumbent on our scholars to learn the rudiments of mathematics and\r\nastronomy. These are not to be regarded, as the Memorialist suggests, as\r\ncunning and mechanical branches of knowledge. Let our officials study\r\nthem earnestly, and they will soon acquire proficiency; at the same\r\ntime let them avoid that undesirable specialisation which comes from\r\nconcentrated study of the classics. We are now borrowing educational\r\nmethods from foreign countries with a view to broadening our own and\r\nincreasing its accuracy, but we have no intention of abandoning the\r\nteachings of the Sages. How, then, can our action prove detrimental to\r\nthe minds of scholars?”\r\n\r\nFrequent reference has been made in previous chapters to the extravagance\r\nand licentious display of Tzŭ Hsi’s Court during the years of the first\r\nRegency. The remonstrances of the Censors on the subject were so numerous\r\nand outspoken, so circumstantial in their charges, as to leave little\r\nroom for doubt that the Empress deserved their indignant condemnation.\r\nAll the records of that period, and particularly from 1862 to 1869, point\r\nto the evil and steadily-increasing influence of the eunuchs, whose\r\ncorruption and encouragement of lavish expenditure resulted in continual\r\ndemands on the provincial exchequers. But even at the height of what\r\nmay fairly be called her riotous living, Tzŭ Hsi always had the good\r\ngrace to concur publicly in the virtuous suggestions of her monitors,\r\nand to conciliate public opinion by professions of a strong desire for\r\neconomy. She would have her Imperial way, her splendid pageants and\r\ngarnered wealth of tribute, but the Censors should have their “face.” On\r\nthe occasion of the Emperor T’ung-Chih’s wedding in 1869, when the Grand\r\nCouncil had solemnly deprecated any increase in her Palace expenditure\r\nbecause of the impoverished state of the people brought about by the\r\nTaiping rebellion, she issued a Decree stating that, “so great was her\r\nperturbation of mind at the prevalent sufferings of her people, that she\r\ngrudged even the money spent on the inferior raiment she was wearing, and\r\nthe humble fare that was served at her Palace table.” She was, in fact,\r\nas lavish of good principles as of the public funds. But it is to be\r\nremembered that a large proportion of the vast sums spent on her Palaces,\r\non the building of her tomb, and on her Court festivities, represents\r\nthe squeezes of officials and eunuchs, which, however solemnly the\r\nGrand Council might denounce extravagance, are in practice universally\r\nrecognised as inseparable from the Celestial system of government. Tzŭ\r\nHsi was fully aware that much of the enormous expenditure charged to\r\nher Privy Purse went in “squeeze,” but she good-humouredly acquiesced\r\nin a custom as deeply ingrained in the Chinese as ancestral worship,\r\nand from which she herself derived no small profit. At her receptions\r\nto the ladies of the Diplomatic Body she would frequently enquire as to\r\nthe market prices of household commodities, in order, as she cheerfully\r\nexplained, to be able to show her Chief Eunuch that she was aware of his\r\nmonstrous over-charges.\r\n\r\nCombined, however, with her love of sumptuous display and occasional fits\r\nof Imperial munificence, Tzŭ Hsi possessed a certain housewifely instinct\r\nof thrift which, with advancing age, verged on parsimony. The Privy Purse\r\nof China’s ruler is not dependent upon any well-defined civil list,\r\nbut rather upon the exigencies of the day, upon the harvests and trade\r\nof the Empire, whence, through percentages of squeezes levied by the\r\nprovincial authorities, come the funds required to defray the expenses\r\nof the Court.[135] The uncertainty of these remittances partly explains\r\nthe Empress Dowager’s hoarding tendencies, that squirrel instinct which\r\nimpelled her to bury large sums in the vaults of the Palace, and to\r\naccumulate a vast store of silks, medicines, clocks, and all manner of\r\nvaluables in the Forbidden City. At the time of her death her private\r\nfortune, including a large number of gold Buddhas and sacrificial\r\nvessels stored in the Palace vaults, was estimated by a high official of\r\nthe Court at about sixteen millions sterling. The estimate is necessarily\r\na loose one, being Chinese, but it was known with tolerable certainty\r\nthat the hoard of gold[136] buried in the Ning-Shou Palace at the time\r\nof the Court’s flight in 1900, amounted to sixty millions of taels (say,\r\neight millions sterling), and the “tribute” paid by the provinces to the\r\nCourt at T’ai-yüan and Hsi-an would amount to as much more.\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi was proud of her personal appearance, and justly so, for she\r\nretained until advanced old age a clear complexion and youthful features.\r\n(To an artist who painted her portrait not long before her death she\r\nexpressed a wish that her wrinkles should be left out.) By no means free\r\nfrom feminine vanity, she devoted a considerable amount of time each day\r\nto her toilet, and was particularly careful about the dressing of her\r\nhair. At the supreme moment of the Court’s flight from the Palace, in\r\n1900, she was heard to complain bitterly at being compelled to adopt the\r\nChinese fashion of head-dress.\r\n\r\nHer good health and vitality were always extraordinary. She herself\r\nattributed them chiefly to early rising, regular habits, and the frequent\r\nconsumption of milk, which she usually took curdled, in the form of a\r\nkind of rennet. She ate frugally but well, being an epicure at heart and\r\ndelighting in dainty and _recherché_ menus. Opium, like other luxuries,\r\nshe took in strict moderation, but greatly enjoyed her pipe after the\r\nbusiness of the day was done. It was her practice then to rest for an\r\nhour, smoking at intervals, a _siesta_ which the Court knew better\r\nthan to disturb. She fully realised the evils wrought by abuse of the\r\ninsidious drug, and approved of the laws, introduced by the initiative\r\nof T’ang Shao-yi and other high officials, for its abolition. But her\r\nfellow-feeling for those who, like herself, could use it in moderation,\r\nand her experience of its soothing and stimulating effect on the mind,\r\nled her to insist that the Abolition Decree (November 22nd, 1906)\r\nshould not deprive persons over sixty years of age of their accustomed\r\nsolace. She was, in fact, willing to decree prohibition for the masses,\r\nbut lenient to herself and to those who had sufficiently proved their\r\ncapacity to follow the path of the happy mean.\r\n\r\nSuch was Tzŭ Hsi, a woman whose wonderful personality and career cannot\r\nfail to secure for her a place amongst the rulers who have become the\r\nstandards and pivots of greatness in the world’s history. The marvellous\r\nsuccess of her career and the passionate devotion of her partisans\r\nare not to be easily explained by any ordinary process of analysis or\r\ncomparison; but there is no doubt that they were chiefly due to that\r\nmysterious and indefinable quality which is called charm, a quality\r\napparently independent alike of morals, ethics, education, and what we\r\ncall civilisation; universal in its appeal, irresistible in its effect\r\nupon the great majority of mankind. It was this personal charm of the\r\nwoman, combined with her intense vitality and accessibility, that won for\r\nher respect, and often affection, even from those who had good reason\r\nto deplore her methods and deny her principles. This personal charm,\r\nthis subtle and magnetic emanation, was undoubtedly the secret of that\r\nstupendous power with which, for good or evil, she ruled for half a\r\ncentury a third of the population of the earth; that charm it was that\r\nwon to her side the bravest and best of China’s picked men, and it is the\r\nlingering memory and tradition of that charm which already invest the\r\nname of the Old Buddha with attributes of legendary virtue and superhuman\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nEuropeans, studying the many complex and unexpected phases of her\r\nextraordinary personality from the point of view of western moralities,\r\nhave usually emphasised and denounced her cold-blooded ferocity and\r\nhomicidal rage. Without denying the facts, or extenuating her guilt,\r\nit must, nevertheless, be admitted that it would be unjust to expect\r\nfrom her compliance with standards of morals and conduct of which she\r\nwas perforce ignorant, and that, judged by the standards of her own\r\npredecessors and contemporaries, and by the verdict of her subjects, she\r\nis not to be reckoned a wicked woman. Let it be remembered also that\r\nwithin comparatively recent periods of English history, death was dealt\r\nout with no niggard or gentle hand to further the alleged interests of\r\nthe State; men were hanged, drawn and quartered in the days of Elizabeth\r\nand Mary Stuart, gentle ladies both, and averse to the spilling of\r\nblood, for the greater glory of Thrones, and in defence of the Christian\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nTzŭ Hsi died as she had lived, keen to the last, impatient of the bonds\r\nof sickness that kept her from the new day’s work, hopeful ever for the\r\nfuture. Unto the last her thoughts were of the Empire, of that new plan\r\nof Constitutional Government wherein she had come to see visions of a\r\nnew and glorious era for China and for herself. And when the end came,\r\nshe faced it, as she had faced life, with a stout heart and brave words,\r\ngoing out to meet the Unknown as if she were but starting for a summer\r\npicnic. Reluctantly she bade farewell to the world of men, to the life\r\nshe had lived with so keen a zest; but, unlike England’s Tudor Queen, she\r\nbowed gracefully to the inevitable, leaving the scene with steadfast and\r\nImperial dignity, confident in her high destinies to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL DAÏS IN THE CH’IEN CH’ING HALL.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Ogawa, Tokio._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON CHANG CHIH-TUNG, TSO TSUNG-T’ANG, SUN CHIA-NAI, AND\r\nTUAN FANG\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANG CHIH-TUNG\r\n\r\nHer Majesty was never on terms of any great intimacy with Chang\r\nChih-tung, but she respected him on account of his brilliant literary\r\nstyle and profound knowledge of the classics. The career of this official\r\nstrikingly illustrates the power of the pen in China. He first came to\r\nbe known by a critical Memorial in reference to the funeral ceremonies\r\nof the Emperor T’ung-Chih, in 1879; his subsequent rapid advancement was\r\ndue to the Memorial in which he denounced the cession of Ili to Russia by\r\nthe Manchu Ambassador, Ch’ung Hou, in 1880. At this time Chang was still\r\na poor scholar, earning a precarious livelihood by composing Memorials\r\nfor certain wealthy Censors. He spoke the Mandarin dialect badly, having\r\nbeen brought up by his father (a Taotai) in the province of Kueichou.\r\nBy patient study, a splendid memory and a natural talent for historical\r\nresearch and criticism, he became at an early age a recognised authority\r\non all questions of State precedents and historical records, so that his\r\npen found no lack of work in the drafting of official patents of rank,\r\nImperial inscriptions and similar documents. Nevertheless, Tzŭ Hsi never\r\ncared for the man, realising that this brilliant scholar was by nature an\r\nopportunist, and that his opinion was rarely based on sincere conviction.\r\nHer estimate of him was amply justified on more than one occasion, for\r\nhe frequently changed his views to meet the exigencies of party politics\r\nat the capital; it is indeed somewhat remarkable, since this estimate\r\nof his character was shared by most of his colleagues, that he should\r\nhave retained her good will and risen to the highest position in the\r\nGovernment. His successful career[137] is explained by the fact that even\r\nmen like Jung Lu and Li Hung-chang, who disliked him thoroughly, were\r\nunable to deny his claims as an unrivalled scholar.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of his historical knowledge and methods, it is\r\ninteresting to recall the main features of his Memorial against the\r\nTreaty of Livadia with Russia. By this Treaty, negotiated by Ch’ung Hou\r\nunder the direct instructions of the Empress Dowager, Ili was to be\r\nretroceded to China upon payment of five million roubles, Russia securing\r\nKuldja in exchange, with the right to open Consulates at certain places\r\nin the New Territory and on the Kansu frontier. Russian goods were also\r\nto be free of duty in Chinese Turkestan, and a new trade route was to be\r\nopened up through Central China, viâ Hsi-an in Shensi. When the terms of\r\nthe Treaty became known, a storm of angry criticism was directed against\r\nthe Manchu Ambassador: Tzŭ Hsi promptly ordered him to be cashiered and\r\narrested for disregard of her instructions. The whole matter was referred\r\nto the Grand Council, who were directed to consult with Prince Ch’un and\r\nthe various Government Boards. Chang Chih-tung, who was at this time a\r\njunior official in the Department of Public Instruction, drew attention\r\nto himself and practically decided the course of events by the advice\r\ngiven in his lengthy Memorial on the subject. The result of the advice\r\ntherein submitted was, that a son of Tseng Kuo-fan was sent to Russia\r\nto negotiate a new Treaty, in which the objectionable clauses were\r\neventually abandoned. Ch’ung Hou considered himself lucky that, as the\r\nresult of Russia’s diplomatic intervention on his behalf, he escaped with\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nChang’s famous Memorial is typical of the mental processes and puerile\r\nnaïveté of the _literati_. It began by showing that if the Treaty of\r\nLivadia were ratified, the whole of China would be open to Russian\r\ntroops, who would enter the country as merchants accompanying caravans\r\n(since the Treaty expressly provided for merchants carrying fire-arms),\r\nand that the retrocession of Ili would prove valueless to China in\r\ncourse of time, inasmuch as Russia would remain in command of all\r\nstrategic points. Chang urged that China could repudiate the Treaty\r\nwithout danger to herself, for several good reasons; the first being\r\nthe Imperial prerogative and the unpopularity of the Treaty, whereby\r\nthe martial spirit of the Chinese people would be aroused, and the\r\nsecond, that the future security of the Empire justified the adoption of\r\nright and reasonable precautions. He recommended that, in order to show\r\nthat the displeasure of the Sovereign was sincere, Ch’ung Hou should\r\nbe decapitated forthwith; this would be a clear intimation that his\r\nnegotiations were disavowed; an excellent precedent existed in the case\r\nof Ch’i Ying,[138] who had been permitted to commit suicide under similar\r\ncircumstances by the Emperor Hsien Feng.\r\n\r\nAs regards Russia’s position in the matter, he was of opinion that China\r\nhad earned the contempt of the whole world by allowing herself to be so\r\neasily intimidated. The Russian Minister at Peking might talk as loudly\r\nas he liked about hauling down his flag, but this was only bluff, and if\r\nhe really desired to take his departure he should be allowed to do so.\r\nChina should then address an identical Note to all the Powers protesting\r\nagainst Russia’s action, which Note would be published throughout the\r\ncivilised world. Russia had been weakened by her war with Turkey, and the\r\nlife of her Sovereign was daily threatened by Nihilists. He was therefore\r\nof opinion that she could by no means fight a successful war against\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nRussia’s position in the neighbourhood of Ili by this Treaty would\r\neventually involve China in the loss of the New Territory. Now China\r\nhad not yet taken over Ili, and the Treaty had not been ratified by the\r\nSovereign, so that Russia could have no good ground for insisting upon\r\nits terms; if, however, Russia were intent on compelling China to yield\r\nor fight, it would be necessary to look to the defences of the Empire\r\nin three directions, namely Turkestan, Kirin and Tientsin. As regards\r\nTurkestan, Tso Tsung-t’ang’s victorious armies, which had just succeeded\r\nin suppressing the Mahomedan rebellion after a campaign of several\r\nyears, would be quite capable of dealing with Russia’s forces were she\r\nto attempt an invasion. As for Manchuria, it was too far from Russia’s\r\nbase of operations to render success even possible, while the stalwart\r\nnatives of the Eastern Provinces might be relied upon to dislodge her\r\nshould she eventually succeed in establishing a foothold. A few months\r\nwould certainly witness her irrevocable defeat. As to invading China by\r\nsea, Russia’s Navy was not to be compared to that of other Powers, and if\r\nthe huge amount which had been spent by Li Hung-chang on armaments for\r\nthe Army and Navy were ever to be turned to any good account, now was\r\nthe time to do it. If at this juncture Li Hung-chang proved incapable of\r\ndealing with the situation, he was for ever useless. The Throne should\r\ndirect him to prepare for war, and he should equip his troops with the\r\nlatest pattern of French artillery. If victorious, a Dukedom should be\r\nhis reward, and if defeated, his head should pay the penalty. The money\r\nwhich would be saved by not carrying out the Treaty, might very well be\r\ndevoted to the equipment of the military forces.\r\n\r\nRussia’s designs in Turkestan, he continued, threatened England no less\r\nthan China. If Li Hung-chang could persuade the British Minister that\r\nEngland’s interests were identical with those of China, surely the\r\nBritish Government’s assistance might be forthcoming? China possessed,\r\nmoreover, several distinguished generals, who should forthwith be\r\nsummoned to the capital, and given command of troops at different points\r\nbetween Peking and Manchuria. It was high time that China’s prestige\r\nshould be made manifest and re-established. And in his peroration he\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n    “I am not indulging in empty resounding phrases, or asking\r\n    Your Majesties to risk the Empire upon a single throw of the\r\n    dice, but the crisis daily increases in seriousness: Europe is\r\n    interfering in our sovereign rights, while even Japan threatens\r\n    to take territory from us. If now we submit to the arbitrary\r\n    proceedings of Russia, all the other Powers will imitate her\r\n    action, and we shall be compelled sooner or later to take up\r\n    arms in self-defence. The present, therefore, is the moment for\r\n    a decisive campaign; we have good chances of victory, and even\r\n    should we meet with defeat in the New Territory it would not\r\n    serve Russia greatly, for she could scarcely hope to penetrate\r\n    beyond the Great Wall, or to cross the border into Kansu, so\r\n    that, even if victorious, she would be severely embarrassed. If\r\n    we postpone action for a few years Tso Tsung-t’ang will be too\r\n    old to conduct military operations, and Li Hung-chang will be\r\n    also advancing in years. Russia will hem us in on all sides,\r\n    and our courage will suffer from our very inaction. It is\r\n    better to fight Russia to-day on our furthermost frontier, than\r\n    to wait until we have to give battle at the gates of Peking: it\r\n    will then be too late for repentance. We must fight sooner or\r\n    later, and in any case, we cannot consent to the retrocession\r\n    of Ili. Come what may, Ch’ung Hou must be beheaded. This is\r\n    not merely my private opinion, but the unanimous decision of\r\n    all your leading Statesmen. The provinces may work together\r\n    to prepare for war, all your servants may set an example of\r\n    courage. Our Foreign Office may clearly express and insist upon\r\n    our rights, but in the last instance the decision of affairs\r\n    rests with Your Majesty the Empress Dowager, to whom we must\r\n    needs look for a firm and consistent policy.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of its childish arguments and colossal ignorance of foreign\r\naffairs, and in spite of the absurdity of allowing the nation’s military\r\noperations to be criticised and dictated by a theoretical scholar, this\r\nMemorial had a most remarkable effect on the opinion of the Court, and\r\nTzŭ Hsi commanded that its author should be consulted by the Foreign\r\nOffice on all important questions of State—a striking case of _parmi\r\nles aveugles_. Chang was promoted to be Vice-President of a Board, and\r\nwithin a year was made Governor of Shansi, where he further increased his\r\nreputation by his entirely sincere attack upon opium smoking and poppy\r\ncultivation. Throughout his career, safe in the comfortable seclusion of\r\nhis Yamên, and judging every question of foreign policy by the light\r\nof the history of previous Dynasties, Chang Chih-tung was always of a\r\nbellicose disposition on paper. He displayed it again in 1884, when he\r\nadvocated the war with France, and became acting Viceroy at Canton.\r\n(He was a firm believer in the military genius of the swash-buckling\r\nLi Ping-heng, even to the day when this notorious reactionary met his\r\ndeath with the forlorn hope of the Boxers.) When the French troops were\r\ndefeated by the Chinese forces at Langshan, Chang claimed and received\r\nno small credit for an event so unusual in Chinese modern history, and\r\nbecame so elated thereby that he sent in a Memorial strongly recommending\r\nthat the victory should be followed up by an invasion of all French\r\nterritory between the Chinese frontier and Hanoi. When this advice was\r\nrejected, he put in another bitter Memorial of remonstrance which created\r\nan immense impression on public opinion. He denounced the peace which was\r\nsubsequently signed and by which China lost Annam, and he never forgave\r\nhis rival and opponent, Li Hung-chang, for his share in this result.\r\n\r\nChang’s share in the _coup d’état_ of 1898 aptly illustrates his\r\nopportunism. It was he who from Wuch’ang originally recommended some\r\nthirty “progressives” to the notice of the Emperor at the beginning of\r\nthat fateful year, and amongst these was Liang Ch’i-ch’ao, the chief\r\ncolleague and henchman of K’ang Yu-wei. Rejoiced at the great Viceroy’s\r\nsupport, the Emperor summoned him to Peking to assume direction of the\r\nnew movement, hoping the more from his assistance as Chang’s views\r\nalways carried weight with the Empress Dowager. It is impossible to\r\nsay what course Chang would have followed had he come to Peking, or\r\nwhat effect his presence might have had in preventing the collapse of\r\nthe Emperor’s plans, but as luck would have it, he had only proceeded\r\nas far as Shanghai, when he was ordered back to his post in Hupei by\r\nan Imperial Decree, which directed him first to settle a troublesome\r\nmissionary case that had just arisen. Immediately after this, the\r\ndismissal of Weng T’ung-ho, and the appointment of Jung Lu to Tientsin,\r\nshowed him that a crisis was impending and that the reactionary party\r\nheld the better cards; he played therefore for his own hand, anticipating\r\nthat the Empress Dowager would speedily come to the front as leader\r\nof the Manchu Conservatives. It was at this particular juncture that\r\nhe wrote and published his famous treatise on education, intended to\r\nrefute the arguments of a revolutionary pamphlet that was then being\r\nwidely circulated in the provinces of his jurisdiction. His treatise,\r\nby its brilliant style rather than by its arguments, created a great\r\nimpression; its effect on the Chinese reader’s mind was to emphasise the\r\nwisdom of learning everything possible of the material arts and forces of\r\nEurope, while keeping the foreigner himself at arm’s length.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, at the urgent request of the Viceroy of Nanking (Lui K’un-yi)\r\nand of Li Hung-chang, he agreed to join in a Memorial impeaching Prince\r\nTuan, and telegrams were exchanged between these high officials to\r\ndiscuss the form which this document should take. In the first instance,\r\nChang had declined to protest against the Emperor’s deposition for the\r\nreason, which he justified by historical precedent, that the suicide of\r\nthe Censor Wu K’o-tu, twelve years before, had justified Her Majesty in\r\nplacing a new Emperor on the Throne. He concurred in the decision of the\r\nNanking Viceroy to head off any Boxer rising in the Yangtsze Provinces,\r\nbut he was obviously uneasy at his own position in having to disobey the\r\nEmpress Dowager’s anti-foreign Decrees, and he hedged to the best of\r\nhis ability by beheading two prominent reformers at Wuch’ang. No sooner\r\nhad the form of the document impeaching Prince Tuan been practically\r\ndecided, than he took fright at the thought that the Prince might\r\neventually triumph and, as father of the Emperor-elect, wreak vengeance\r\non his enemies; he therefore telegraphed to Li Hung-chang at Shanghai,\r\nbegging that his signature be withheld from the Memorial. Li Hung-chang,\r\nwho dearly loved his joke, promptly sent off the Memorial with Chang\r\nChih-tung’s signature attached thereto, and then telegraphed informing\r\nhim that he had done so, and asking whether he desired that a second\r\ntelegram be sent to Her Majesty cancelling his signature? Chang was for\r\nseveral days in a state of the greatest distress (which was only relieved\r\nwhen the Boxers were finally routed), and his mood was not improved when\r\na pair of scrolls were sent to him anonymously, with inscriptions which\r\nmay be roughly translated as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Full of patriotism, but quite devoid of any real ability or\r\n    intelligence.”\r\n\r\n    “As an administrator a bungler, but remarkable for originating\r\n    magnificent schemes.”\r\n\r\nBefore his death, Chang had achieved a curiously mixed reputation,\r\nrevered as he was by all scholars throughout the Empire, yet denounced\r\non all sides for administrative incapacity. As an instance of the\r\nchildish self-sufficiency which characterised him to the end, nothing is\r\nmore remarkable than the suggestion which he solemnly submitted to the\r\nThrone, during the course of the peace negotiations for the Portsmouth\r\nTreaty after the conclusion of the war between Russia and Japan. At this\r\njuncture, the Empress Dowager had telegraphed inviting suggestions for\r\nChina’s future policy from all the high provincial authorities. Chang\r\ntelegraphed five suggestions in reply, one of which was that China should\r\ncome to an agreement with Japan to send two hundred thousand Japanese\r\ntroops to Manchuria, and in the event of Russia proceeding to attack\r\nChinese territory, that Japan should be requested to garrison Urga. This\r\nwas the idea of China’s foremost literary statesman in July, 1905, but\r\nthere were not lacking enemies of his who avowed that his political views\r\nwere considerably affected by the fact that he had contracted loans from\r\nJapanese financiers. Whatever the cause of his views, he had reason to\r\nchange them completely before he died.\r\n\r\n\r\nTSO TSUNG-T’ANG\r\n\r\nThe Chinese look upon Tseng Kuo-fan, the conqueror of the Taiping rebels,\r\nas the greatest military commander in modern history; but they regard\r\nTso Tsung-t’ang, the hero of the long Mahomedan campaign, as very near\r\nto him in glory. Both Generals were natives of Hunan (a fact which\r\nseems to entitle the people of that province to assume something of a\r\ntruculent attitude to the rest of the Empire), and both were possessed of\r\nindisputable qualities of leadership and organisation, remarkable enough\r\nin men trained to literary pursuits. Both were beloved of the people for\r\ntheir personal integrity, courage and justice.\r\n\r\nTso was born, one of nine sons in a poor family, in 1812. He took his\r\nprovincial graduate degree at the age of twenty; thereafter, he seems\r\nto have abandoned literary work, for he never passed the Metropolitan\r\nexamination. This did not prevent the Empress Dowager from appointing\r\nhim, after his victorious campaign, to the Grand Secretariat, the\r\nonly instance of a provincial graduate attaining to that high honour.\r\nFor three years he was Tseng Kuo-fan’s ablest lieutenant against the\r\nTaipings, and became Governor of Fukhien in 1863. In 1868 he was\r\nappointed Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces against the Mahomedan\r\nrebels, and began a campaign which lasted, with breathing spaces, until\r\nthe beginning of 1878. His victorious progress through the western and\r\nnorth-western provinces began at Hsiang-Yang, on the Han river, in Hupei.\r\nThence, after driving the rebels from Hsi-an, through Shansi and Kansu,\r\nhe came to a halt before the strong city of Su-chou fu, on the north-west\r\nfrontier of Kansu. The siege of this place lasted nearly three years, for\r\nhis force was badly off for ordnance, and he was compelled to wait until\r\nhis deputies purchased artillery for him from a German firm at Shanghai.\r\nThe guns were sent up in the leisurely manner affected by the Mandarins,\r\nand Tso was obliged to put his troops to agricultural work in order to\r\nprovide himself with commissariat.\r\n\r\nSu-chou had been for ten years in the hands of the rebels. It fell to\r\nthe Imperialists in October, 1873, some say by treachery, according\r\nto others by assault. Be this as it may, Tso, whose method of dealing\r\nwith rebels was absolutely pitiless, reduced the place to a heap of\r\nruins, killing men, women and children indiscriminately, throughout\r\nlarge tracts of country. So fearful were the wholesale massacres and\r\ntreacherous atrocities committed by his Hunanese troops, that General\r\nKauffmann, commanding the Russian forces on the frontier, considered\r\nit his duty to address him on the subject, and to protest indignantly\r\nat the indiscriminate killing of non-combatants. General Kauffmann\r\nalluded chiefly to the massacre which had followed the taking of\r\nthe town of Manas (November, 1876), but similar atrocities had been\r\nperpetrated at Su-chou, Hami, and many other important places. At Hami\r\nthe entire population was put to the sword. Eye-witnesses of the scene\r\nof desolation, which stretched from Hsi-an in Shensi to Kashgar, have\r\nrecorded that scarcely a woman was left alive in all those ruined\r\ncities—one might ride for days and not see one—a fact which accounts for\r\nthe failure of the country unto this day to recover from the passing of\r\nthat scourge. In more than one instance, Tso said with pride that he had\r\nleft no living thing to sow new seeds of rebellion.[139]\r\n\r\nNor do the Chinese find anything reprehensible in his action.\r\nInstinctively a peace-loving people, they have learned through centuries\r\nof dreadful experience that there can be no humanitarianism in these\r\never-recurring rebellions, which are but one phase of the deadly struggle\r\nfor life in China, and that the survival of the fittest implies the\r\nextermination of the unfit. Tso had first learned this lesson in the\r\nfierce warfare of the Taiping rebellion, where there was no question of\r\nquarter, asked or given, on either side. “If I destroy them not,” he\r\nwould say with simple grimness, “if I leave root or branch, they may\r\ndestroy me.”\r\n\r\nIn private life the man was genial and kindly, of a rugged simplicity;\r\nshort of stature, and in later years stout, with a twinkling eye and\r\nhearty laugh; sober and frugal in his habits, practising the classical\r\nvirtues of the ancients in all sincerity: a strict disciplinarian, and\r\nmuch beloved of his soldiers. He delighted in gardening and the planting\r\nof trees. Along the entire length of the Imperial highway that runs from\r\nHsi-an to Chia-Yü Kuan beyond the Great Wall, thirty-six days’ journey,\r\nhe planted an avenue of trees, a stately monument of green to mark the\r\nred route of his devastating armies. One of the few Europeans who saw him\r\nat Hami records that it was his habit to walk in the Viceregal gardens\r\nevery afternoon, accompanied by a large suite of officials and Generals,\r\nwhen he would count his melons and expatiate on the beauty of his\r\nfavourite flowers. With him, ready for duty at a word, walked his Chief\r\nExecutioner.\r\n\r\nHe was as careful for the welfare of his people as for the extermination\r\nof rebels, and erected a large woollen factory at Lan-chou fu, whereby he\r\nhoped to establish a flourishing industry throughout the north-western\r\nprovinces. He was fiercely opposed to opium cultivation, and completely\r\nsuppressed it along the valley of the Yellow River for several years. The\r\npenalty for opium-smoking in his army was the loss of one ear for a first\r\noffence, and death for the second.\r\n\r\nYakoub Beg, the last leader and forlorn hope of the rebellion, died in\r\nMay, 1877. Tso, following up his successes, captured in turn Yarkand,\r\nKashgar and Khotan (January, 1878), and thus ended the insurrection. At\r\nthe conclusion of the campaign he had some forty thousand Hunanese troops\r\nat Hami, and twenty thousand more under General Liu[140] at Kashgar. One\r\nof his Generals was that Tung Fu-hsiang who subsequently became known to\r\nthe world as the leader of the bloodthirsty Kansuh soldiery at Peking in\r\n1900; at the taking of Khotan he laid the foundations of his reputation\r\nfor truculent ferocity. Tso firmly believed that his Hunanese were the\r\nfinest fighting men in the world, and was most anxious to use them, in\r\n1879, in trying conclusions with the Russians, boasting that with two\r\nhundred thousand of them he would easily march to St. Petersburg and\r\nthere dictate a peace which should wipe out the humiliating concessions\r\nnegotiated by Ch’ung Hou in the Treaty of Livadia. Fortunately for him,\r\nhis patriotic ambitions came to the ears of the Empress Dowager, who,\r\ndesiring no more complications, recalled him in hot haste to Peking,\r\nwhere she loaded him with honours and rewards.\r\n\r\nHis was the simple nature of the elementary fighter, inured to the hard\r\nlife of camps. He knew little of other lands, but professed the greatest\r\nadmiration for Bismarck, chiefly because of the enormous indemnity which\r\nthe German conqueror had exacted as the price of victory, Tso’s own\r\ntroops being accustomed to live almost exclusively on the spoils of war.\r\nHe despised wealth for himself, but loved plunder for his men.\r\n\r\nUpon his triumphant return to Peking he was informed that the Palace\r\nauthorities expected him to pay forty thousand taels as “gate-money”\r\nbefore entering the capital. Tso flatly refused. “The Emperor has sent\r\nfor me,” he said, “and I have come, but I will not pay a cash. If he\r\nwishes to see me, he must either obtain for me free entry or pay the\r\ngate-money himself.” He waited stolidly five days and then had his way,\r\nentering scot-free. Later, when the Empress Dowager made him a present\r\nof ten thousand taels, he divided the money between his soldiers and the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUN CHIA-NAI\r\n\r\nThis official, chiefly known to fame among his countrymen as one of\r\nthe tutors of His Majesty Kuang-Hsü, was a sturdy Conservative of the\r\northodox type, but an honest and kindly man. His character and opinions\r\nmay be gauged from a well-known saying of his: “One Chinese character is\r\nbetter than ten thousand words of the barbarians. By knowing Chinese a\r\nman may rise to become a Grand Secretary; by knowing the tongues of the\r\nbarbarians, he can at best aspire to become the mouth-piece of other men.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CEILING AND PILLARS OF THE TAI HO TIEN.\r\n\r\n_Photo, Ogawa, Tokio._]\r\n\r\nIn his later years he felt and expressed great grief at the condition\r\nof his country, and particularly in regard to the strained relations\r\nbetween the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. He traced the first causes\r\nof these misfortunes to the war with Japan, and never ceased to blame\r\nhis colleague, the Imperial Tutor Weng T’ung-ho, for persuading the\r\nEmperor to sign the Decree whereby that war was declared, which he\r\ndescribed as the act of a madman. Weng, however, was by no means alone\r\nin holding the opinion that China could easily dispose of the Japanese\r\nforces by land and by sea. It was well-known at Court, and the Emperor\r\nmust have learned it from more than one quarter, that several foreigners\r\nholding high positions under the Chinese Government, including the\r\nInspector-General of Customs (Sir Robert Hart), concurred in the view\r\nthat China had practically no alternative but to declare war in view of\r\nJapan’s high-handed proceedings and insulting attitude. Prestige apart,\r\nit was probable that the Emperor was by no means averse to taking this\r\nstep on his own authority, even though he knew that the Empress Dowager\r\nwas opposed to the idea of war, because of its inevitable interference\r\nwith the preparations for her sixtieth birthday; at that moment, Tzŭ Hsi\r\nwas living in quasi-retirement at the Summer Palace. After war had been\r\ndeclared and China’s reverses began, she complained to the Emperor and\r\nto others, that the fatal step had been taken without her knowledge and\r\nconsent, but this was only “making face,” for it is certain that she\r\nhad been kept fully informed of all that was done and that, had she so\r\ndesired, she could easily have prevented the issue of the Decree, and the\r\ndespatch of the Chinese troops to Asan. Sun Chia-nai’s reputation for\r\nsagacity was increased after the event, and upon the subsequent disgrace\r\nand dismissal of Weng T’ung-ho he stood high in Her Majesty’s favour.\r\nNevertheless his loyalty to the unfortunate Emperor remained unshaken.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, his tendencies were theoretically on the side of reform, but\r\nhe thoroughly disapproved of the methods and self-seeking personality\r\nof K’ang Yu-wei, advising the Emperor that, while possibly fit for\r\nan Under-Secretaryship, he was quite unfitted for any high post of\r\nresponsibility. When matters first approached a crisis, it was by his\r\nadvice that the Emperor directed K’ang to proceed to Shanghai for the\r\norganisation of the Press Bureau scheme. Sun, peace-loving and prudent,\r\nhoped thereby to find an outlet for K’ang Yu-wei’s patriotic activities\r\nwhile leaving the Manchu dovecots unfluttered. Later, after the _coup\r\nd’état_, being above all things orthodox and a stickler for harmonious\r\nobservance of precedents, he deplored the harsh treatment and humiliation\r\ninflicted upon the Emperor. It is reported of him that on one occasion at\r\naudience he broke down completely, and with tears implored the Empress\r\nDowager not to allow her mind to be poisoned against His Majesty, but\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nUpon the nomination of the Heir Apparent, in 1900, which he, like\r\nmany others, regarded as the Emperor’s death sentence, he sent in a\r\nstrongly worded Memorial against this step, and subsequently denounced\r\nit at a meeting of the Grand Council. Thereafter, his protests proving\r\nineffective, he resigned all his offices, but remained at the capital\r\nin retirement, watching events. At the commencement of the Boxer\r\ncrisis, unable to contain his feelings, he sent in a Memorial through\r\nthe Censorate denouncing the rabid reactionary Hsü T’ung, whom he\r\ndescribed as “the friend of traitors, who would bring the State to ruin\r\nif further confidence were placed in him.” Throughout his career he\r\ndisplayed the courage of his convictions, which, judged by the common\r\nstandard of Chinese officialdom, were conspicuously honest. He was a man\r\nof that Spartan type of private life which one finds not infrequently\r\nassociated with the higher branches of Chinese scholarship and Confucian\r\nphilosophy; it was his boast that he never employed a secretary, but\r\nwrote out all his correspondence and Memorials with his own hand.\r\n\r\nA pleasing illustration of his character is the following: He was seated\r\none day in his shabby old cart, and driving down the main street to\r\nhis home, when his driver collided with the vehicle of a well-known\r\nCensor, named Chao. The police came up to make enquiries and administer\r\nstreet-justice, but learning that one cart belonged to the Grand\r\nSecretary Sun, they told his driver to proceed. The Censor, justly\r\nindignant at such servility, wrote a note to Sun in which he said: “The\r\nGrand Secretary enjoys, no doubt, great prestige, but even he cannot\r\nlightly disregard the power of the Censorate.” Sun, on receiving this\r\nnote, proceeded at once on foot in full official dress to the Censor’s\r\nhouse, and upon being informed that he was not at home, prostrated\r\nhimself before the servant, saying: “The nation is indeed to be\r\ncongratulated upon possessing a virtuous Censor.” Chao, not to be outdone\r\nin generosity, proceeded in his turn to the residence of the Grand\r\nSecretary, intending to return the compliment, but Sun declined to allow\r\nhim to apologise in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUAN FANG\r\n\r\nIn 1898, Tuan Fang was a Secretary of the Board of Works; his rapid\r\npromotion after that date was chiefly due to the patronage of his friend\r\nJung Lu. For a Manchu, he is remarkably progressive and liberal in his\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, he was Acting-Governor of Shensi. As the Boxer movement spread\r\nand increased in violence, and as the fears of Jung Lu led him to take\r\nan increasingly decided line of action against them, Tuan Fang, acting\r\nupon his advice, followed suit. In spite of the fact that at the time of\r\nthe _coup d’état_ he had adroitly saved himself from clear identification\r\nwith the reformers and had penned a classical composition in praise of\r\nfilial piety, which was commonly regarded as a veiled reproof to the\r\nEmperor for not yielding implicit obedience to the Old Buddha, he had\r\nnever enjoyed any special marks of favour at the latter’s hands, nor been\r\nreceived into that confidential friendliness with which she frequently\r\nhonoured her favourites.\r\n\r\nIn his private life, as in his administration, Tuan Fang has always\r\nrecognised the changing conditions of his country and endeavoured to\r\nadapt himself to the needs of the time; he was one of the first among\r\nthe Manchus to send his sons abroad for their education. His sympathies\r\nwere at first unmistakably with K’ang Yu-wei and his fellow reformers,\r\nbut he withdrew from them because of the anti-dynastic nature of their\r\nmovement, of which he naturally disapproved.\r\n\r\nAs Acting-Governor of Shensi, in July, 1900, he clearly realised the\r\nserious nature of the situation and the dangers that must arise from the\r\nsuccess of the Boxer movement, and he therefore issued two Proclamations\r\nto the province, in which he earnestly warned the people to abstain\r\nfrom acts of violence. These documents were undoubtedly the means of\r\nsaving the lives of many missionaries and other foreigners isolated in\r\nthe interior. In the first a curious passage occurs, wherein, after\r\ndenouncing the Boxers, he said:\r\n\r\n    “The creed of the Boxers is no new thing: in the reign\r\n    of Chia-Ch’ing, followers of the same cult were beheaded\r\n    in droves. But the present-day Boxer has taken the field\r\n    ostensibly for the defence of his country against the\r\n    foreigner, so that we need not refer to the past. While\r\n    accepting their good intentions, I would merely ask, is it\r\n    reasonable for us to credit these men with supernatural powers\r\n    or invulnerability? Are we to believe that all the corpses\r\n    which now strew the country between Peking and the sea are\r\n    those of spurious Boxers and that the survivors alone represent\r\n    the true faith?”\r\n\r\nAfter prophesying for them the same fate which overtook the Mahomedan\r\nrebels and those of the Taiping insurrection, he delivered himself of\r\nadvice to the people which, while calculated to prevent the slaughter of\r\nforeigners, would preserve his reputation for patriotism. It is well, now\r\nthat Tuan Fang has fallen upon evil days, to remember the good work he\r\ndid in a very difficult position. His Proclamation ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “I have never for a moment doubted that you men of Shensi are\r\n    brave and patriotic and that, should occasion offer, you would\r\n    fight nobly for your country. I know that if you joined these\r\n    Boxers, it would be from patriotic motives. I would have you\r\n    observe, however, that our enemies are the foreign troops who\r\n    have invaded the Metropolitan province and not the foreign\r\n    missionaries who reside in the interior. If the Throne orders\r\n    you to take up arms in the defence of your country, then I, as\r\n    Governor of this province, will surely share in that glory. But\r\n    if, on your own account, you set forth to slay a handful of\r\n    harmless and defenceless missionaries, you will undoubtedly be\r\n    actuated by a desire for plunder, there will be nothing noble\r\n    in your deed, and your neighbours will despise you as surely as\r\n    the law will punish you.\r\n\r\n    “At this very moment our troops are pouring in upon the\r\n    capital from every province in the Empire. Heaven’s avenging\r\n    sword is pointed against the invader. This being so, it is\r\n    absurd to suppose that there can be any need for such services\r\n    as you people could render at such a time. Your obvious and\r\n    simple duty is to remain quietly in your homes, pursuing your\r\n    usual avocations. It is the business of the official to protect\r\n    the people, and you may rely upon me to do so. As to that Edict\r\n    of Their Majesties which, last year, ordered the organisation\r\n    of trained bands, the idea was merely to encourage self-defence\r\n    for local purposes, on the principle laid down by Mencius of\r\n    watch and ward being kept by each district.”\r\n\r\nA little later the Governor referred to that Decree of the Empress\r\nDowager (her first attempt at hedging) which began by quoting the “Spring\r\nand Autumn Classic” in reference to the sacred nature of foreign Envoys,\r\nand used it as a text for emphasising the fact that the members of the\r\nseveral missionary societies in Shensi had always been on the best of\r\nterms with the people. He referred to the further fact that many refugees\r\nfrom the famine-stricken districts of Shansi, and numbers of disbanded\r\nsoldiers, had crossed the borders of the province, and fearing lest\r\nthese lawless folk should organise an attack upon the foreigners, he\r\nonce more urged his people to permit no violation of the sacred laws\r\nof hospitality. The province had already commenced to feel the effects\r\nof the long drought which had caused such suffering in Shansi, and the\r\nsuperstitious lower classes were disposed to attribute this calamity to\r\nthe wrath of Heaven, brought upon them by reason of their failure to join\r\nthe Boxers. Tuan Fang proceeded to disabuse their minds of this idea.\r\n\r\n    “If the rain has not fallen upon your barren fields,” he said,\r\n    “if the demon of drought threatens to harass you, be sure that\r\n    it is because you have gone astray, led by false rumours, and\r\n    have committed deeds of violence. Repent now and return to your\r\n    peaceful ways, and the rains will assuredly fall. Behold the\r\n    ruin which has come upon the provinces of Chihli and Shantung;\r\n    it is to save you from their fate that I now warn you. Are we\r\n    not all alike subjects of the great Manchu Dynasty, and shall\r\n    we not acquit ourselves like men in the service of the State?\r\n    If there were any chance of this province being invaded by the\r\n    enemy, you would naturally sacrifice your lives and property\r\n    to repel him, as a matter of simple patriotism. But if, in\r\n    a sudden access of madness, you set forth to butcher a few\r\n    helpless foreigners, you will in no wise benefit the Empire,\r\n    but will merely be raising fresh difficulties for the Throne.\r\n    For the time being, your own consciences will accuse you of\r\n    ignoble deeds, and later you will surely pay the penalty with\r\n    your lives and the ruin of your families. Surely, you men of\r\n    Shensi, enlightened and high-principled, will not fall so low\r\n    as this? There are, I know, among you some evil men who,\r\n    professing patriotic enmity to foreigners and Christians, wax\r\n    fat on foreign plunder. But the few missionary Chapels in this\r\n    province offer but meagre booty, and it is safe to predict\r\n    that those who begin by sacking them will certainly proceed\r\n    next to loot the houses of your wealthier citizens. From the\r\n    burning of foreigners’ homes, the conflagration will spread to\r\n    your own, and many innocent persons will share the fate of the\r\n    slaughtered Christians. The plunderers will escape with their\r\n    booty, and the foolish onlookers will pay the penalty of these\r\n    crimes. Is it not a well-known fact that every anti-Christian\r\n    outbreak invariably brings misery to the stupid innocent people\r\n    of the district concerned? Is not this a lamentable thing? As\r\n    for me, I care neither for praise nor blame; my only object in\r\n    preaching peace in Shensi is to save you, my people, from dire\r\n    ruin and destruction.”\r\n\r\nTuan Fang was a member of the Mission to foreign countries in 1905 and\r\nhas received decorations and honours at the hands of several European\r\nsovereigns. In private life he is distinguished by his complete absence\r\nof formality; a genial, hospitable man, given to good living, delighting\r\nin new mechanical inventions and fond of his joke. It is he who, as\r\nViceroy of Nanking, organised the International Exhibition now being held\r\nin that city. As Viceroy of Chihli, he was in charge of the arrangements\r\nfor the funeral of the Empress Dowager in November of last year, and a\r\nweek after that impressive ceremony was denounced for alleged want of\r\nrespect and decorum. It was charged against him that he had permitted\r\nsubordinate officials to take photographs of the _cortège_ and that\r\nhe had even dared to use certain trees in the sacred enclosure of\r\nthe Mausolea as telegraph poles, for which offences he was summarily\r\ncashiered; since then he has lived in retirement. The charges were\r\npossibly true, but it is matter of common knowledge that the real reason\r\nfor his disgrace was a matter of Palace politics rather than funereal\r\netiquette, for he was a _protégé_ of the Regent and his removal was a\r\ntriumph for the Yehonala clan, at a time when its prestige called for a\r\ndemonstration of some sort against the growing power and influence of the\r\nEmperor Kuang-Hsü’s brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] As an example of unbalanced vituperation, uttered in good faith and\r\nwith the best intentions, _vide_ _The Chinese Crisis from Within_ by\r\n“Wen Ching,” republished from the _Singapore Free Press_ in 1901 (Grant\r\nRichards).\r\n\r\n[2] About £120.\r\n\r\n[3] The same euphemism was employed to describe the Court’s flight in\r\nAugust 1900.\r\n\r\n[4] Grandfather of Na T’ung, the present head of the Waiwupu.\r\n\r\n[5] “Yi” and “Cheng” are honorific names, meaning respectively\r\n“harmonious” and “sedate.”\r\n\r\n[6] The expression has reference to the fact that the Empresses Regent\r\nare supposed to be concealed from the sight of Ministers at audience by a\r\ncurtain suspended in front of the Throne.\r\n\r\n[7] The age of the Emperor was less than six, but the solemn farce of his\r\nalleged acts and opinions is solemnly accepted by the Chinese as part of\r\nthe eternal order of things.\r\n\r\n[8] To allow women privily to accompany the Imperial cortège is a crime\r\npunishable by law with the penalty of the lingering death.\r\n\r\n[9] The Prison of the Imperial Clan Court.\r\n\r\n[10] Poetical term for Purgatory.\r\n\r\n[11] Hereditary titles in China usually descend in a diminishing scale.\r\n\r\n[12] He was the father of that Marquis Tseng who, as Minister to England\r\n(1878), lived to be credited by the British press with literary abilities\r\nwhich he did not possess and liberal opinions which he did not share. His\r\ngrandsons, educated partly in England, have lately been distinguished for\r\nthat quality of patriotic Conservatism which prides itself on having no\r\nintercourse with foreigners.\r\n\r\n[13] A short biographical note on Tso Tsung-t’ang, the hero of the\r\nMahomedan rebellion who gained distinction under Tseng against the\r\nTaipings, is given in the appendix.\r\n\r\n[14] So called because they declined to plait the queue, as a sign that\r\nthey rejected Manchu rule.\r\n\r\n[15] His younger brother, subsequently made an earl and Viceroy of\r\nNanking for many years.\r\n\r\n[16] This is merely figurative, referring to an ancient and obsolete\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\n[17] So named because, before becoming a eunuch at the age of sixteen, he\r\nwas apprenticed to a cobbler at his native place, Ho-Chien fu, in Chihli,\r\nfrom which district most of the eunuchs come.\r\n\r\n[18] This form of argument, under similar conditions, obtains all over\r\nthe Empire. “How could I possibly squeeze my master?” says the servant.\r\n\r\n[19] Quotation from the Book of Changes, implying a sense of impending\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n[20] Chinese pamphleteers in Canton record the event with much detail,\r\nand state that this son is alive to-day under the name of Chiu Min.\r\n\r\n[21] A fantastic account of this mission is contained in an imaginative\r\nwork recently published (_La Vie Secrète de la Cour de Chine_, Paris,\r\n1910), where the Chief Eunuch’s name is given as “Siao.” This curious\r\nblunder is due to the fact that the Eunuch’s nickname, on account of his\r\nstature, was “Hsiao An’rh” (little An), just as Li hien-Ying’s is “P’i\r\nHsiao” Li all over China.\r\n\r\n[22] The Phœnix flag signified that he was sent by the Empresses Regent.\r\n\r\n[23] The same expression is used of a novice taking the vows of Buddhist\r\npriesthood.\r\n\r\n[24] Tzŭ Hsi was fond of masquerading with her favourite, till well\r\nadvanced in years. One photograph of her is on sale in Peking, wherein\r\nshe is posing as the Goddess of Mercy (Kuanyin) with Li in attendance as\r\none of the Boddhisatvas.\r\n\r\n[25] A term of humility.\r\n\r\n[26] This Kuei Ching was an uncle of Tuan Fang, recently Viceroy of\r\nChihli, and a man generally respected.\r\n\r\n[27] This disease is regarded amongst the Chinese as one of good omen,\r\nespecially if the symptoms develop satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[28] The annual and seasonal sacrifices at the ancestral Temple and at\r\nthe Imperial tombs involve “kowtowing” before each tablet of the sacred\r\nancestors, and this cannot be done in the presence of one of the same\r\ngeneration as the last deceased, much less by him.\r\n\r\n[29] Prince Kung was the sixth, Prince Ch’un the seventh, in order of\r\nseniority.\r\n\r\n[30] On the occasion to which the Memorialist refers, the lawful heir to\r\nthe Throne committed suicide. The allusion would be readily understood\r\n(if not appreciated) by the Empress Dowager, whose irregular choice of\r\nKuang-Hsü and violation of the dynastic laws had certainly led to the\r\ndeath of A-lu-te. Looked at from the Chinese scholar’s point of view, the\r\ninnuendo was in the nature of a direct accusation.\r\n\r\n[31] The writer refers to the united action of the Manchu Princes and\r\nnobles who assisted in the establishment of law and order, and the\r\nexpulsion of the Chinese rebels and Pretenders, during the troublous\r\ntime of the first Regency (1644) and the minority of the infant Emperor,\r\nShun-Chih.\r\n\r\n[32] The burial place was close to, but necessarily outside, the large\r\nenclosed park which contains the Imperial mausolea.\r\n\r\n[33] Burial clothes should all be new and clean—by cutting away the\r\nsoles, his boots would look less shabby.\r\n\r\n[34] I.e. by causing the Empresses to have his corpse mutilated.\r\n\r\n[35] About £10.\r\n\r\n[36] The point whence, according to legend, the Yellow Emperor ascended\r\nto heaven and where his clothes were buried.\r\n\r\n[37] A quotation from Tseng Tzu, one of the most noted disciples of\r\nConfucius.\r\n\r\n[38] A sort of Chinese Mr. Malaprop, known to history as one who\r\ninvariably spoke at the wrong time.\r\n\r\n[39] It is curious to note how frequently the Imperial tombs have been\r\nthe scene of such unseemly wrangles, wherein grievances and passions,\r\nlong pent up within the Palace precincts, find utterance. A case of this\r\nkind occurred in 1909, on the occasion of the burial of Tzŭ Hsi, when the\r\nsurviving consorts of T’ung-Chih and Kuang-Hsü, having quarrelled with\r\nthe new Empress Dowager (Lung Yü) on a similar question of precedence,\r\nrefused to return to the City and remained in dudgeon at the tombs until\r\na special mission, under an Imperial Duke, was sent humbly to beg them to\r\ncome back, to the no small scandal of the orthodox.\r\n\r\n[40] This title was originally given to an infamous eunuch of the Court\r\nof the Ming Emperor Chu Yü-hsiao, who, because of his influence over his\r\ndissolute master, was canonised by the latter after his death. The same\r\ntitle was claimed and used by the Eunuch An Te-hai, _vide supra_, page 90.\r\n\r\n[41] See above, page 93.\r\n\r\n[42] Tzŭ Hsi had no love for this official, for it was he who drafted\r\nHsien-Feng’s valedictory Decree, at the dictation of Su Shun, in 1861.\r\n_Vide_ page 33.\r\n\r\n[43] Sun remained in high favour until December 1894, when the Emperor\r\nwas induced by Weng T’ung-ho to dismiss him. At that time the Empress was\r\ntaking little active part in the direction of affairs, occupying her time\r\nwith theatricals and other diversions at the Summer Palace, and playing\r\na watching game in politics, so that for a while Sun’s life was in real\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n[44] Apricot yellow is a colour reserved, strictly speaking, for the use\r\nof the Throne.\r\n\r\n[45] In that event it would not be the Yehonala clan alone which would\r\nbenefit, as the present Emperor’s grandmother (who was one of Prince\r\nCh’un’s concubines) is still alive and would necessarily share in any\r\nhonours posthumously conferred on her husband, whilst Kuang-Hsü’s mother\r\nwould be excluded.\r\n\r\n[46] The results of the Prince’s eminent services in naval and military\r\nreorganisation were demonstrated three years later, not entirely to the\r\nnation’s satisfaction, in the war with Japan.\r\n\r\n[47] From a sentence in the Book of Rites, which means “to give rest and\r\npeace to Heaven-sent old age.”\r\n\r\n[48] Sir Walter Hillier, appointed by Yüan Shih-k’ai to be foreign\r\nadviser to the Grand Council in 1908. When Yuan was compelled to flee\r\nfrom Seoul before the advance of the Japanese, he was escorted to\r\nChemulpo by a guard of blue-jackets.\r\n\r\n[49] _i.e._ the Japanese (literal translation).\r\n\r\n[50] At present Chinese Minister in London.\r\n\r\n[51] Now known as the Empress Dowager Lung Yü.\r\n\r\n[52] Kang Yi was a bigoted reactionary and the arch instigator of the\r\nBoxer movement at the capital. Young China has carefully preserved one\r\nof his sayings of that time: “The establishment of schools and colleges\r\nhas only encouraged Chinese ambitions and developed Chinese talent to\r\nthe danger of the Manchu Dynasty: these students should therefore be\r\nexterminated without delay.”\r\n\r\n[53] In 1901, this official begged Tzŭ Hsi, just before her departure\r\nfrom K’ai-Feng fu for Peking, not to return thither, on the ground that\r\nher Palace had been polluted by the presence of the foreign barbarians.\r\n\r\n[54] The Emperor prided himself on being a great stickler in such\r\nmatters, and many of the younger officials feared him on account of his\r\nquick temper and martinet manner in dealing with them.\r\n\r\n[55] K’ang’s subsequent escape under British protection, in which one of\r\nthe writers was instrumental, is graphically described in despatch No.\r\n401 of Blue Book No. 1 of 1899.\r\n\r\n[56] She was thrown down a well, by Tzŭ Hsi’s orders, as the Court\r\nprepared for flight after the entrance of the allied forces into Peking.\r\n(_Vide infra._)\r\n\r\n[57] It is interesting to note that this Manchu Prince (Tsai Ch’u) was\r\nreleased from prison by the present Regent, the Emperor’s brother, and\r\nwas appointed to the command of one of the Manchu Banner Corps on the\r\nsame day, in January 1909, that Yüan Shih-k’ai was dismissed from the\r\nviceroyalty of Chihli. The Emperor’s party, as opposed to the Yehonala\r\nClan, heartily approved of his reinstatement.\r\n\r\n[58] _Vide_ Blue Book China No. I. of 1899, letters Nos. 266, 401, and\r\n426.\r\n\r\n[59] As an example of Chinese official methods: the Shanghai Taotai\r\nwhen requesting the British Consul-General’s assistance to arrest K’ang\r\nYu-wei, did not hesitate to say that the Emperor was dead, murdered by\r\nthe Chief Reformer. _Vide_ Blue Book No. I of 1899; letter No. 401.\r\n\r\n[60] From _The Times_ of 31st March, 1899.\r\n\r\n[61] Chang Yin-huan, who had been created a Knight Commander of St.\r\nMichael and St. George in connection with Queen Victoria’s Jubilee\r\ncelebration, was subsequently put to death, after banishment to\r\nTurkestan. An order given by Prince Tuan at the commencement of the Boxer\r\ncrisis was the immediate cause of his execution.\r\n\r\nAnother reformer named Hsü Chih-ching was condemned to imprisonment for\r\nlife in the Board of Punishments under this same Decree; he was released\r\nby the Allies in August 1900, when he proceeded at once to T’ai-Yüan fu,\r\nand handed himself over to justice, disdaining to accept his release\r\nat the hands of foreigners. This incident is typical of the Chinese\r\nofficials’ attitude of mind and of their reverence for the Decrees of the\r\nhead of the State.\r\n\r\n[62] On the occasion of her seventieth birthday (1904), the Empress\r\nDowager promulgated a general amnesty for all those who had taken part\r\nin the Reform Movement of 1898, excepting only the leaders K’ang Yu-wei\r\nand Liang Ch’i-ch’ao, who were expressly excluded from grace, and Dr. Sun\r\nYat-sen, who was a fugitive from justice on other counts.\r\n\r\n[63] Li Tuan-fen returned from exile in Turkestan under the amnesty of\r\n1904.\r\n\r\n[64] Weng T’ung-ho has been posthumously restored to his full rank and\r\ntitles by a Decree of the present Regent. Thus is the Emperor tardily\r\njustified and the pale ghosts of his followers continue to suffer, even\r\nin Hades, the chances and changes of Chinese official life!\r\n\r\n[65] This official was eventually decapitated by the allies, as one of\r\nthe originators of the Boxer rising.\r\n\r\n[66] This Prefect of Hsüanhua was subsequently promoted by the Empress\r\nDowager, when passing through that city, at the beginning of the flight\r\nfrom Peking.\r\n\r\n[67] Hsü, to whom Jung Lu was writing, was a Cantonese by birth, and was\r\nat this time Viceroy of Foochow.\r\n\r\n[68] A note on the career and character of this courageous official is\r\ngiven in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[69] The Decree is given at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[70] The victim was British, not French—viz., the Rev. Mr. Brooks, killed\r\non 31st December, 1899, just after Yu Hsien’s removal had been arranged.\r\n\r\n[71] Between January and June the entries are of no particular interest.\r\n\r\n[72] The Supreme Deity of the Taoists and tutelary spirit of the Boxers.\r\n\r\n[73] A nickname of An Te-hai, _vide supra_, p. 90 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[74] The Chancellor of the Japanese Legation, Mr. Sugiyama.\r\n\r\n[75] This was a forgery.\r\n\r\n[76] A quotation from the “Book of Odes.”\r\n\r\n[77] This man’s subsequent arrest and execution are described in a\r\nCensorate memorial at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[78] Mr. (later Sir Harry) Parkes.\r\n\r\n[79] Professor James.\r\n\r\n[80] Mentioned above under full name of Chi Shou-ch’eng. Chi Pin was his\r\n“hao” or intimate personal name.\r\n\r\n[81] Ching Shan’s house was just inside the Tung An Gate of the Imperial\r\nCity, about a quarter of a mile to the north of the present Legation area\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\n[82] This favourite companion of Tzŭ Hsi was really Jung Lu’s secondary\r\nconsort, who was only raised to the rank of _la première légitime_ after\r\nhis first wife’s death in September, 1900. She survived him and continued\r\nto exercise great influence with the Old Buddha.\r\n\r\n[83] A short biographical note on Chang Chih-tung will be found in the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\n[84] _Vide_ under June 20th.\r\n\r\n[85] A quotation from Mencius.\r\n\r\n[86] Quotation from Mencius.\r\n\r\n[87] History of events under the Chou dynasty, by Confucius; one of the\r\nFive Classics.\r\n\r\n[88] How well and successfully she did it, has been told in Miss\r\nCatherine A. Carl’s book, _With the Empress Dowager of China_. The\r\npainting of her portrait for the St. Louis exhibition was in itself\r\nan example of Tzŭ Hsi’s “cardinal virtues of government,” which she\r\npractised with conspicuous success on the simple-minded wife of the\r\nAmerican Minister, Mrs. Conger. (_Vide_ Cordier, _Relations de la Chine_,\r\nVol. III., p. 423.)\r\n\r\n[89] The second character of Prince Tuan’s name contained the radical\r\nsign for _dog_, and was given him by the Emperor Hsien-Feng, because he\r\nhad been begotten during the period of mourning for his parent Tao-Kuang;\r\nit being an offence, under Chinese law, for a son to be begotten during\r\nthe twenty-seventh months of mourning for father or mother.\r\n\r\n[90] A classical allusion, in common use, equivalent to “Ne sutor ultra\r\ncrepidam.”\r\n\r\n[91] A traitor whose crime and punishment are recorded in the Spring and\r\nAutumn Annals.\r\n\r\n[92] A classical expression, meaning the Spirit-world.\r\n\r\n[93] Referring to his part in the _coup d’état_ of 1898.\r\n\r\n[94] The expression is figurative.\r\n\r\n[95] A species of owl—classical reference.\r\n\r\n[96] Consort of Kuang-Hsü, now Empress Dowager, known by the honorific\r\ntitle of Lung-yü.\r\n\r\n[97] Prince Ch’un subsequently married Jung Lu’s daughter, by special\r\ncommand of the Empress Dowager.\r\n\r\n[98] This Memorial was never published officially, and Tzŭ Hsi refrained\r\nfrom issuing a Rescript thereto; it was forwarded by an official with\r\nthe Court at Hsi-an to one of the vernacular papers at Shanghai, which\r\npublished it.\r\n\r\n[99] A lane four hundred yards north of the glacis which now surrounds\r\nthe Legation quarter.\r\n\r\n[100] Quotation from Confucius.\r\n\r\n[101] Tzŭ Hsi was addicted to gentle sarcasm of this kind in Decrees.\r\n\r\n[102] Admiral Seymour’s expedition.\r\n\r\n[103] See Dr. Smith’s “China in Convulsion,” page 361.\r\n\r\n[104] The North Gate of the Imperial City.\r\n\r\n[105] At that time Governor-designate of Shensi. He had come north with\r\ntroops to defend the capital.\r\n\r\n[106] Tutor of the Heir Apparent, father-in-law of the Emperor\r\nT’ung-Chih, his daughter, the Empress Chia-Shun (A-lu-te), had committed\r\nsuicide in 1875 (_vide supra_).\r\n\r\n[107] An allusion to Kuang-Hsü’s order for Jung Lu’s summary execution in\r\nSeptember 1898.\r\n\r\n[108] See biographical note, _infra_ (Appendix).\r\n\r\n[109] Deceased, 26th August 1910.\r\n\r\n[110] As he had done for Tzŭ Hsi’s son, the Emperor T’ung-Chih.\r\n\r\n[111] Amongst Chinese officials no characteristic is more common than\r\ntheir jealousy of each other and their promiscuous habit of backbiting\r\nand slandering.\r\n\r\n[112] It was because of Tung Fu-hsiang’s great popularity in Kansu that\r\nHer Majesty, fearing another rebellion, hesitated to order his execution.\r\n\r\n[113] This sentence is equivalent to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\n[114] See Ching Shan’s Diary, page 258; also cf. page 324.\r\n\r\n[115] The Empress Dowager was from the outset most anxious to screen\r\nand protect this official, for whom she had a great personal regard. On\r\nreviewing his case in the light of later information and current public\r\nopinion, it would appear that most of his actions were instigated, if not\r\nordered, by Kang Yi, and that the decision of the foreign Ministers to\r\ninsist upon his death was taken without any very definite information as\r\nto his share of guilt.\r\n\r\n[116] In accordance with prescribed custom.\r\n\r\n[117] He was directly descended from Nurhachu, the conqueror of the Mings.\r\n\r\n[118] This was no empty boast. Yü Hsien, cold-blooded fanatic that he\r\nwas, bore a most honourable name for absolute integrity and contempt for\r\nwealth. He died in poverty, so miserable, that amongst all his clothes\r\nthere was not one suit new enough to be fittingly used for his burial\r\nrobes. His name is still held in high honour by the people of Shansi,\r\nwho sing the praises of his Governorship, and who claim that his proud\r\nspirit it was which protected their Province from being invaded by the\r\nforeigners. They erected a shrine to his memory, but it was demolished to\r\nappease the foreign Powers.\r\n\r\n[119] The Chinese rendering of a German name.\r\n\r\n[120] This is the Chinese date; the day of the audience was the 4th\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n[121] Wen T’i had been a censor in 1898, but was cashiered by the Emperor\r\nfor being reactionary. Tzŭ Hsi restored him to favour after the _coup\r\nd’état_.\r\n\r\n[122] Precisely the same quotation was used by Ch’ung Hou in a despatch\r\nto the British Minister (Mr. Wade) in 1861, under somewhat similar\r\ncircumstances. Since that date the most frequent criticism of foreign\r\nobservers on the subject has been “_plus ça change, plus c’est la même\r\nchose_.”\r\n\r\n[123] The literal translation of the Chinese is, “She has eaten her meal\r\nat sunset, and worn her clothes throughout the night.”\r\n\r\n[124] Ginseng, the specific remedy of the Chinese pharmacopœia for\r\ndebility, supposed to possess certain magical qualities when grown\r\nin shapes resembling the human form or parts thereof. The best kind,\r\nsupplied as tribute to the Throne, grows wild in Manchuria and Corea.\r\n\r\n[125] This house-law was made by the Emperor Ch’ien Lung to prevent his\r\nCourt officials from intriguing for the favour of the Heir Apparent.\r\n\r\n[126] The chief eunuch in reality objected to the Buddhist pontiff on\r\nhis own account, for the Lama’s exactions from the superstitious would\r\nnaturally diminish his own opportunities.\r\n\r\n[127] He had succeeded Jung Lu as custodian of the mausolea.\r\n\r\n[128] The Imperial Mausoleum lies about ninety miles to the east of\r\nPeking, covering a vast enclosure of magnificent approach and decorated\r\nwith splendid specimens of the best style of Chinese architecture. It\r\nconsists of four palaces, rising one behind the other, and at the back\r\nof the fourth and highest stands the huge mound classically termed the\r\n“Jewelled Citadel,” under which lies the spacious grave chamber.\r\n\r\n[129] _Vide_ Biographical Note in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[130] 2nd January, 1909.\r\n\r\n[131] _Vide_ the Diary of Ching Shan, page 259.\r\n\r\n[132] Grant Richards,

Dec., 1909.\r\n\r\n[136] The nucleus of this hoard was the money confiscated from the\r\nusurping Regent Su Shun in 1861.\r\n\r\n[137] An account of his life was given in a memoir published by _The\r\nTimes_ on the 6th October, 1909.\r\n\r\n[138] _Vide supra_, Chapter I., page 12.\r\n\r\n[139] It has remained thus in many districts until now, vast solitudes\r\nof ruins being the chief
