  "content": "A COMPILATION OF THE MESSAGES AND PAPERS OF THE PRESIDENTS\r\n\r\nBY JAMES D. RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\r\n\r\nVOLUME IX\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS 1902\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\nThis volume comprises the papers of Benjamin Harrison and of Grover\r\nCleveland (second term). The events of these two Administrations of\r\neight years, though highly interesting, coming as they do down to March\r\n4, 1897, are so recent and fresh in the public mind that I need not\r\ncomment on them.\r\n\r\nThis volume is the last of the series, except the Appendix and Index\r\nvolume. The work of compiling was begun by me in April, 1895, just after\r\nthe expiration of the Fifty-third Congress. I then anticipated that\r\nI could complete the work easily within a year. Though I have given my\r\nentire time to the undertaking when not engaged in my official duties as\r\na Representative, instead of completing it within the time mentioned it\r\nhas occupied me for nearly four years. The labor has been far greater\r\nthan the Joint Committee on Printing or I supposed it would be. I had\r\nno idea of the difficulties to overcome in obtaining the Presidential\r\npapers, especially the proclamations and Executive orders. In the\r\nPrefatory Note to Volume I, I said: \"I have sought to bring together\r\nin the several volumes of the series all Presidential proclamations,\r\naddresses, messages, and communications to Congress excepting those\r\nnominating persons to office and those which simply transmit treaties,\r\nand reports of heads of Departments which contain no recommendation\r\nfrom the Executive.\" But after the appearance of Volume I, and while\r\npreparing the contents of Volume II, I became convinced that I had made\r\na mistake and that the work to be exhaustive should comprise every\r\nmessage of the Presidents transmitting reports of heads of Departments\r\nand other communications, no matter how brief or unintelligible the\r\npapers were in themselves, and that to make them intelligible I should\r\ninsert editorial footnotes explaining them. Having acted upon the other\r\nidea in making up Volume I and a portion of Volume II, quite a number of\r\nsuch brief papers were intentionally omitted. Being convinced that all\r\nthe papers of the Executives should be inserted, the plan was modified\r\naccordingly, and the endeavor was thereafter made to publish all of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, that the compilation may be \"accurate and\r\nexhaustive,\" I have gone back and collected all the papers--those which\r\nshould have appeared in Volumes I and II, as well as such as were\r\nunintentionally omitted from the succeeding volumes--excepting those\r\nsimply making nominations, and shall publish them in an appendix in the\r\nlast volume. While this may occasion some little annoyance to the reader\r\nwho seeks such papers in chronological order, yet, inasmuch as they all\r\nappear at their proper places in the alphabetical Index, it is not\r\nbelieved that any serious inconvenience will result.\r\n\r\nThe editor and compiler has resorted to every possible avenue and has\r\nspared no effort to procure all public Presidential papers from the\r\nbeginning of the Government to March 4, 1897. He has looked out for\r\nevery reference to the work in the public prints, has endeavored to read\r\nall the criticisms made because of omissions, and has availed himself of\r\nall the papers to which his attention has been called by anyone; has\r\ndiligently and earnestly sought for same himself, and has, as stated\r\nabove, inserted all omitted papers in the Appendix, so that he feels\r\nwarranted in saying that if he has given to the country all he could\r\nfind and all any critic or reviewer has been able to find he has done\r\nhis whole duty and reasonable complaint can not be made if any paper is\r\nstill omitted. In view of the inaccessibility of many of the messages by\r\nreason of their not having been entered on the journals of either House\r\nof Congress, and of the fact that the Government itself does not possess\r\nmany of the proclamations and Executive orders, it may be that there\r\nyet can be found a few papers omitted from this work; but with much\r\nconfidence, amounting to a positive conviction, I feel that assurance\r\nmay be safely given that only a few, if any at all, have been\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nCongress in June, 1897, by law requested me to prepare an index to the\r\nentire compilation. I am now and have been for over two years engaged in\r\nthis work. I hope to be able to give the last volume, which will include\r\nthe Appendix and Index, as above stated, to Congress and the public in\r\nabout two months. It would have been completed at this time but for the\r\nfact that in addition to making the Index simply an index to the various\r\nmessages and other papers I have added to it the encyclopedic feature.\r\nThere will therefore be found in the Index, in alphabetical order, a\r\nlarge number of encyclopedic definitions of words and phrases used by\r\nthe Chief Executives, and of other politico-historical subjects. It\r\nis believed that this feature will not detract in any manner from the\r\nIndex, but, on the other hand, will add largely to its value and to\r\nthe value of the entire compilation.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 24, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1889, to March 4, 1893\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison, twenty-third President of the United States, was born\r\nat North Bend, Ohio, August 20, 1833. His father, John Scott Harrison,\r\nwas the third son of General William Henry Harrison, ninth President\r\nof the United States, who was the third and youngest son of Benjamin\r\nHarrison, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. John\r\nScott Harrison was twice married, his second wife being Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Archibald Irwin, of Mercersburg, Pa. Benjamin was the second\r\nson of this marriage. His parents were resolutely determined upon the\r\neducation of their children, and early in childhood Benjamin was placed\r\nunder private instruction at home. In 1847 he and his elder brother were\r\nsent to a school on what was known as College Hill, a few miles from\r\nCincinnati. After remaining there two years entered the junior class at\r\nMiami University, at Oxford, Ohio, where he was graduated in 1852. Was\r\nmarried October 20, 1853, to Caroline Scott, daughter of Dr. John W.\r\nScott, who was then president of Oxford Female Seminary, from which Mrs.\r\nHarrison was graduated in 1852. After studying law under Storer & Gwynne\r\nin Cincinnati, Mr. Harrison was admitted to the bar in 1854, and began\r\nthe practice of his profession at Indianapolis, Ind., which has since\r\nbeen his home. Was appointed crier of the Federal court, at a salary of\r\n$2.50 per day. This was the first money he had ever earned. Jonathan\r\nW. Gordon, one of the leaders of the Indianapolis bar, called young\r\nHarrison to his assistance in the prosecution of a criminal tried for\r\nburglary, and intrusted to him the plea for the State. He had taken\r\nample notes of the evidence, but the case was closed at night, and the\r\ncourt-house being dimly lighted by tallow candles, he was unable to read\r\nthem when he arose to address the court and jury, paying them aside,\r\nhe depended entirely upon his memory and found it perfect. He made an\r\neloquent plea, produced a marked impression, and won the case. Since\r\nthen he has always been an impromptu speaker. Formed a partnership later\r\nwith William Wallace, but in 1860 the latter became clerk of Marion\r\nCounty, and the firm was changed to Harrison & Fishback, which was\r\nterminated by the entry of the senior partner into the Army in 1862.\r\nWas chosen reporter of the supreme court of Indiana in 1860 on the\r\nRepublican ticket. This was his first active appearance in the political\r\nfield. When the Civil War began assisted in raising the Seventieth\r\nIndiana Regiment of Volunteers, taking a second lieutenant's commission\r\nand raising Company A of that regiment. Governor Morton tendered him\r\nthe command of the regiment and he was commissioned its colonel. Mr.\r\nHarrison appointed a deputy reporter for the supreme court. In the\r\nensuing autumn the Democratic State committee, considering his position\r\nas a civil officer vacated by this military appointment, nominated and\r\nelected a successor, although his term of office had not expired. Their\r\nview was sustained by the State supreme court; but in 1864, while\r\nColonel Harrison was in the Army, the people of Indiana gave their\r\njudgment by reelecting him to the position of supreme-court reporter\r\nby an overwhelming majority. In 1862 the Seventieth Indiana went into\r\nthe field with Harrison as its colonel, their objective point being\r\nBowling Green, Ky. It was brigaded with the Seventy-ninth Ohio and the\r\nOne hundred and second, One hundred and fifth, and One hundred and\r\ntwenty-ninth Illinois regiments, under Brigadier-General Ward, of\r\nKentucky, and this organization was kept unchanged until the close of\r\nthe war. Colonel Harrison had the right of the brigade, and his command\r\nwas occupied at first in guarding railroads and hunting guerrillas, his\r\nenergies being largely spent in drilling his men. When General Rosecrans\r\nset out for Chattanooga General Ward was sent on duty to Nashville, and\r\non January 2, 1864, his command was called to the front. Later this\r\nbrigade became the First Brigade of the Third Division of the Twentieth\r\nArmy Corps, under General Hooker, General Ward resuming its command.\r\nThe campaign under General Sherman, upon which his regiment with its\r\nassociate forces entered, was directed, as is now known, against the\r\nConfederate army of General Joseph E. Johnston, and not against any\r\nparticular place. In the Federal advance one of the severest actions was\r\nfought at Resaca, Ga., May 14 and 15, 1864, and the Seventieth Indiana\r\nled the assault. His regiment participated in the fights at New Hope\r\nChurch and at Golgotha Church, Kenesaw Mountain, and Peach Tree Creek.\r\nWhen Atlanta was taken by Sherman, September 2, 1864, Colonel Harrison\r\nreceived his first furlough to visit home, being assigned to special\r\nduty in a canvass of the State to recruit for the forces in the field.\r\nReturning to Chattanooga and then to Nashville, he was placed in command\r\nof a provisional brigade held in reserve at the battle at the latter\r\nplace (December 15 and 16, 1864), and was but little engaged. When the\r\nfight was over he was sent in pursuit of the Confederate general Hood.\r\nRecalled from that pursuit, was next ordered to report to General\r\nSherman at Savannah. While passing through New York he succumbed to an\r\nattack of scarlet fever, but in a few weeks was able to proceed on his\r\nway. Joining Sherman at Goldsboro, N.C., resumed command of his old\r\nbrigade, and at the close of the war went with it to Washington to take\r\npart in the grand review of the armies. Was duly mustered out of the\r\nservice June 8, 1865, not, however, until he had received a commission\r\nas brevet brigadier-general, dated January 23, 1865. Returning to\r\nIndianapolis after the war, resumed his office of reporter of the\r\nsupreme court, but in 1867 declined a renomination, preferring to devote\r\nhimself exclusively to the practice of law. Became a member of the\r\nfirm of Porter, Harrison & Fishback, and, after subsequent changes,\r\nof that of Harrison, Miller & Elam. Took part in 1868 and 1872 in the\r\nPresidential campaigns in support of General Grant, traveling over\r\nIndiana and speaking to large audiences. In 1876 at first declined a\r\nnomination for governor on the Republican ticket, consenting to run only\r\nafter the regular nominee had withdrawn. In this contest he received\r\nalmost 2,000 more votes than his associates, but was defeated. Was a\r\nmember of the Mississippi River Commission in 1879. In 1880, as chairman\r\nof the Indiana delegation in the Republican national convention, he cast\r\nnearly the entire vote of the State for James A. Garfield for President.\r\nPresident Garfield offered him a place in his Cabinet, but he declined\r\nit, preferring the United States Senatorship from Indiana, to which\r\nhe had just been chosen, and which he held from 1881 to 1887. In the\r\nSenate he advocated the tariff views of his party, opposed President\r\nCleveland's vetoes of pension bills, urged the reconstruction and\r\nupbuilding of the Navy, and labored and voted for civil-service reform.\r\nWas a delegate at large to the Republican national convention in 1884,\r\nand in 1888 at Chicago was nominated for the Presidency on the eighth\r\nballot. The nomination was made unanimous, and in November he was\r\nelected, receiving 233 electoral votes to 168 for Grover Cleveland.\r\nWas inaugurated March 4, 1889. Was again nominated for the Presidency\r\nat the national Republican convention which met at Minneapolis in 1892,\r\nbut was defeated at the November election, receiving 145 electoral\r\nvotes, against 276 votes for Grover Cleveland. Upon his retiring from\r\noffice located at Indianapolis, Ind., where he now resides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS: There is no constitutional or legal requirement that\r\nthe President shall take the oath of office in the presence of the\r\npeople, but there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public\r\ninduction to office of the chief executive officer of the nation that\r\nfrom the beginning of the Government the people, to whose service the\r\nofficial oath consecrates the officer, have been called to witness the\r\nsolemn ceremonial. The oath taken in the presence of the people becomes\r\na mutual covenant. The officer covenants to serve the whole body of the\r\npeople by a faithful execution of the laws, so that they may be the\r\nunfailing defense and security of those who respect and observe them,\r\nand that neither wealth, station, nor the power of combinations shall be\r\nable to evade their just penalties or to wrest them from a beneficent\r\npublic purpose to serve the ends of cruelty or selfishness.\r\n\r\nMy promise is spoken; yours unspoken, but not the less real and solemn.\r\nThe people of every State have here their representatives. Surely I do\r\nnot misinterpret the spirit of the occasion when I assume that the\r\nwhole body of the people covenant with me and with each other to-day\r\nto support and defend the Constitution and the Union of the States, to\r\nyield willing obedience to all the laws and each to every other citizen\r\nhis equal civil and political rights. Entering thus solemnly into\r\ncovenant with each other, we may reverently invoke and confidently\r\nexpect the favor and help of Almighty God--that He will give to me\r\nwisdom, strength, and fidelity, and to our people a spirit of fraternity\r\nand a love of righteousness and peace.\r\n\r\nThis occasion derives peculiar interest from the fact that the\r\nPresidential term which begins this day is the twenty-sixth under our\r\nConstitution. The first inauguration of President Washington took place\r\nin New York, where Congress was then sitting, on the 30th day of\r\nApril, 1789, having been deferred by reason of delays attending the\r\norganization of the Congress and the canvass of the electoral vote. Our\r\npeople have already worthily observed the centennials of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, of the battle of Yorktown, and of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, and will shortly celebrate in New York the institution of\r\nthe second great department of our constitutional scheme of government.\r\nWhen the centennial of the institution of the judicial department,\r\nby the organization of the Supreme Court, shall have been suitably\r\nobserved, as I trust it will be, our nation will have fully entered\r\nits second century.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to note the marvelous and in great part happy\r\ncontrasts between our country as it steps over the threshold into its\r\nsecond century of organized existence under the Constitution and that\r\nweak but wisely ordered young nation that looked undauntedly down the\r\nfirst century, when all its years stretched out before it.\r\n\r\nOur people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which\r\naccompanied the institution of government under the Constitution, or to\r\nfind inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example of Washington\r\nand his great associates, and hope and courage in the contrast which\r\nthirty-eight populous and prosperous States offer to the thirteen\r\nStates, weak in everything except courage and the love of liberty, that\r\nthen fringed our Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Dakota has now a population greater than any of the\r\noriginal States (except Virginia) and greater than the aggregate of\r\nfive of the smaller States in 1790. The center of population when our\r\nnational capital was located was east of Baltimore, and it was argued\r\nby many well-informed persons that it would move eastward rather than\r\nwestward; yet in 1880 it was found to be near Cincinnati, and the new\r\ncensus about to be taken will show another stride to the westward. That\r\nwhich was the body has come to be only the rich fringe of the nation's\r\nrobe. But our growth has not been limited to territory, population, and\r\naggregate wealth, marvelous as it has been in each of those directions.\r\nThe masses of our people are better fed, clothed, and housed than their\r\nfathers were. The facilities for popular education have been vastly\r\nenlarged and more generally diffused.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their\r\ncontinued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the\r\nlives of our people. The influences of religion have been multiplied\r\nand strengthened. The sweet offices of charity have greatly increased.\r\nThe virtue of temperance is held in higher estimation. We have not\r\nattained an ideal condition. Not all of our people are happy and\r\nprosperous; not all of them are virtuous and law-abiding. But on the\r\nwhole the opportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts\r\nof life are better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they\r\nwere here one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of a large measure of sovereignty to the General\r\nGovernment, effected by the adoption of the Constitution, was not\r\naccomplished until the suggestions of reason were strongly reenforced\r\nby the more imperative voice of experience. The divergent interests\r\nof peace speedily demanded a \"more perfect union,\" The merchant,\r\nthe shipmaster, and the manufacturer discovered and disclosed to our\r\nstatesmen and to the people that commercial emancipation must be added\r\nto the political freedom which had been so bravely won. The commercial\r\npolicy of the mother country had not relaxed any of its hard and\r\noppressive features. To hold in check the development of our commercial\r\nmarine, to prevent or retard the establishment and growth of\r\nmanufactures in the States, and so to secure the American market for\r\ntheir shops and the carrying trade for their ships, was the policy of\r\nEuropean statesmen, and was pursued with the most selfish vigor.\r\n\r\nPetitions poured in upon Congress urging the imposition of\r\ndiscriminating duties that should encourage the production of needed\r\nthings at home. The patriotism of the people, which no longer found a\r\nfield of exercise in war, was energetically directed to the duty of\r\nequipping the young Republic for the defense of its independence by\r\nmaking its people self-dependent. Societies for the promotion of home\r\nmanufactures and for encouraging the use of domestics in the dress of\r\nthe people were organized in many of the States. The revival at the end\r\nof the century of the same patriotic interest in the preservation and\r\ndevelopment of domestic industries and the defense of our working\r\npeople against injurious foreign competition is an incident worthy of\r\nattention. It is not a departure but a return that we have witnessed.\r\nThe protective policy had then its opponents. The argument was made,\r\nas now, that its benefits inured to particular classes or sections.\r\n\r\nIf the question became in any sense or at any time sectional, it was\r\nonly because slavery existed in some of the States. But for this there\r\nwas no reason why the cotton-producing States should not have led or\r\nwalked abreast with the New England States in the production of cotton\r\nfabrics. There was this reason only why the States that divide with\r\nPennsylvania the mineral treasures of the great southeastern and\r\ncentral mountain ranges should have been so tardy in bringing to the\r\nsmelting furnace and to the mill the coal and iron from their near\r\nopposing hillsides. Mill fires were lighted at the funeral pile of\r\nslavery. The emancipation proclamation was heard in the depths of the\r\nearth as well as in the sky; men were made free, and material things\r\nbecame our better servants.\r\n\r\nThe sectional element has happily been eliminated from the tariff\r\ndiscussion. We have no longer States that are necessarily only planting\r\nStates. None are excluded from achieving that diversification of\r\npursuits among the people which brings wealth and contentment. The\r\ncotton plantation will not be less valuable when the product is spun in\r\nthe country town by operatives whose necessities call for diversified\r\ncrops and create a home demand for garden and agricultural products.\r\nEvery new mine, furnace, and factory is an extension of the productive\r\ncapacity of the State more real and valuable than added territory.\r\n\r\nShall the prejudices and paralysis of slavery continue to hang upon the\r\nskirts of progress? How long will those who rejoice that slavery no\r\nlonger exists cherish or tolerate the incapacities it put upon their\r\ncommunities? I look hopefully to the continuance of our protective\r\nsystem and to the consequent development of manufacturing and mining\r\nenterprises in the States hitherto wholly given to agriculture as a\r\npotent influence in the perfect unification of our people. The men who\r\nhave invested their capital in these enterprises, the farmers who have\r\nfelt the benefit of their neighborhood, and the men who work in shop or\r\nfield will not fail to find and to defend a community of interest.\r\n\r\nIs it not quite possible that the farmers and the promoters of the\r\ngreat mining and manufacturing enterprises which have recently been\r\nestablished in the South may yet find that the free ballot of the\r\nworkingman, without distinction of race, is needed for their defense as\r\nwell as for his own? I do not doubt that if those men in the South who\r\nnow accept the tariff views of Clay and the constitutional expositions\r\nof Webster would courageously avow and defend their real convictions\r\nthey would not find it difficult, by friendly instruction and\r\ncooperation, to make the black man their efficient and safe ally, not\r\nonly in establishing correct principles in our national administration,\r\nbut in preserving for their local communities the benefits of social\r\norder and economical and honest government. At least until the good\r\noffices of kindness and education have been fairly tried the contrary\r\nconclusion can not be plausibly urged.\r\n\r\nI have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special Executive policy\r\nfor any section of our country. It is the duty of the Executive to\r\nadminister and enforce in the methods and by the instrumentalities\r\npointed out and provided by the Constitution all the laws enacted by\r\nCongress. These laws are general and their administration should be\r\nuniform and equal. As a citizen may not elect what laws he will obey,\r\nneither may the Executive elect which he will enforce. The duty to\r\nobey and to execute embraces the Constitution in its entirety and the\r\nwhole code of laws enacted under it. The evil example of permitting\r\nindividuals, corporations, or communities to nullify the laws because\r\nthey cross some selfish or local interest or prejudices is full of\r\ndanger, not only to the nation at large, but much more to those who use\r\nthis pernicious expedient to escape their just obligations or to obtain\r\nan unjust advantage over others. They will presently themselves be\r\ncompelled to appeal to the law for protection, and those who would use\r\nthe law as a defense must not deny that use of it to others.\r\n\r\nIf our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal\r\nlimitations and duties, they would have less cause to complain of the\r\nunlawful limitations of their rights or of violent interference with\r\ntheir operations. The community that by concert, open or secret, among\r\nits citizens denies to a portion of its members their plain rights\r\nunder the law has severed the only safe bond of social order and\r\nprosperity. The evil works from a bad center both ways. It demoralizes\r\nthose who practice it and destroys the faith of those who suffer by\r\nit in the efficiency of the law as a safe protector. The man in whose\r\nbreast that faith has been darkened is naturally the subject of\r\ndangerous and uncanny suggestions. Those who use unlawful methods, if\r\nmoved by no higher motive than the selfishness that prompted them, may\r\nwell stop and inquire what is to be the end of this.\r\n\r\nAn unlawful expedient can not become a permanent condition of\r\ngovernment. If the educated and influential classes in a community\r\neither practice or connive at the systematic violation of laws that\r\nseem to them to cross their convenience, what can they expect when the\r\nlesson that convenience or a supposed class interest is a sufficient\r\ncause for lawlessness has been well learned by the ignorant classes?\r\nA community where law is the rule of conduct and where courts, not\r\nmobs, execute its penalties is the only attractive field for business\r\ninvestments and honest labor.\r\n\r\nOur naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry\r\ninto the character and good disposition of persons applying for\r\ncitizenship more careful and searching. Our existing laws have been in\r\ntheir administration an unimpressive and often an unintelligible form.\r\nWe accept the man as a citizen without any knowledge of his fitness,\r\nand he assumes the duties of citizenship without any knowledge as to\r\nwhat they are. The privileges of American citizenship are so great and\r\nits duties so grave that we may well insist upon a good knowledge of\r\nevery person applying for citizenship and a good knowledge by him of\r\nour institutions. We should not cease to be hospitable to immigration,\r\nbut we should cease to be careless as to the character of it. There are\r\nmen of all races, even the best, whose coming is necessarily a burden\r\nupon our public revenues or a threat to social order. These should be\r\nidentified and excluded.\r\n\r\nWe have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference with\r\nEuropean affairs. We have been only interested spectators of their\r\ncontentions in diplomacy and in war, ready to use our friendly offices\r\nto promote peace, but never obtruding our advice and never attempting\r\nunfairly to coin the distresses of other powers into commercial\r\nadvantage to ourselves. We have a just right to expect that our\r\nEuropean policy will be the American policy of European courts.\r\n\r\nIt is so manifestly incompatible with those precautions for our peace\r\nand safety which all the great powers habitually observe and enforce in\r\nmatters affecting them that a shorter waterway between our eastern and\r\nwestern seaboards should be dominated by any European Government that\r\nwe may confidently expect that such a purpose will not be entertained\r\nby any friendly power.\r\n\r\nWe shall in the future, as in the past, use every endeavor to maintain\r\nand enlarge our friendly relations with all the great powers, but they\r\nwill not expect us to look kindly upon any project that would leave\r\nus subject to the dangers of a hostile observation or environment. We\r\nhave not sought to dominate or to absorb any of our weaker neighbors,\r\nbut rather to aid and encourage them to establish free and stable\r\ngovernments resting upon the consent of their own people. We have a\r\nclear right to expect, therefore, that no European Government will\r\nseek to establish colonial dependencies upon the territory of these\r\nindependent American States. That which a sense of justice restrains\r\nus from seeking they may be reasonably expected willingly to forego.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed, however, that our interests are so exclusively\r\nAmerican that our entire inattention to any events that may transpire\r\nelsewhere can be taken for granted. Our citizens domiciled for purposes\r\nof trade in all countries and in many of the islands of the sea demand\r\nand will have our adequate care in their personal and commercial\r\nrights. The necessities of our Navy require convenient coaling stations\r\nand dock and harbor privileges. These and other trading privileges\r\nwe will feel free to obtain only by means that do not in any degree\r\npartake of coercion, however feeble the government from which we ask\r\nsuch concessions. But having fairly obtained them by methods and for\r\npurposes entirely consistent with the most friendly disposition toward\r\nall other powers, our consent will be necessary to any modification or\r\nimpairment of the concession.\r\n\r\nWe shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation or the\r\njust rights of its citizens, nor to exact the like treatment for our\r\nown. Calmness, justice, and consideration should characterize our\r\ndiplomacy. The offices of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly\r\narbitration in proper cases should be adequate to the peaceful\r\nadjustment of all international difficulties. By such methods we will\r\nmake our contribution to the world's peace, which no nation values more\r\nhighly, and avoid the opprobrium which must fall upon the nation that\r\nruthlessly breaks it.\r\n\r\nThe duty devolved by law upon the President to nominate and, by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint all public\r\nofficers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the\r\nConstitution or by act of Congress has become very burdensome and its\r\nwise and efficient discharge full of difficulty. The civil list is so\r\nlarge that a personal knowledge of any large number of the applicants\r\nis impossible. The President must rely upon the representations of\r\nothers, and these are often made inconsiderately and without any just\r\nsense of responsibility. I have a right, I think, to insist that those\r\nwho volunteer or are invited to give advice as to appointments shall\r\nexercise consideration and fidelity. A high sense of duty and an\r\nambition to improve the service should characterize all public\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which the convenience and comfort of those who\r\nhave business with our public offices may be promoted by a thoughtful\r\nand obliging officer, and I shall expect those whom I may appoint to\r\njustify their selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of\r\ntheir duties. Honorable party service will certainly not be esteemed\r\nby me a disqualification for public office, but it will in no case be\r\nallowed to serve as a shield of official negligence, incompetency, or\r\ndelinquency. It is entirely creditable to seek public office by proper\r\nmethods and with proper motives, and all applicants will be treated\r\nwith consideration; but I shall need, and the heads of Departments will\r\nneed, time for inquiry and deliberation. Persistent importunity will\r\nnot, therefore, be the best support of an application for office. Heads\r\nof Departments, bureaus, and all other public officers having any duty\r\nconnected therewith will be expected to enforce the civil-service\r\nlaw fully and without evasion. Beyond this obvious duty I hope to do\r\nsomething more to advance the reform of the civil service. The ideal,\r\nor even my own ideal, I shall probably not attain. Retrospect will be\r\na safer basis of judgment than promises. We shall not, however, I am\r\nsure, be able to put our civil service upon a nonpartisan basis until\r\nwe have secured an incumbency that fair-minded men of the opposition\r\nwill approve for impartiality and integrity. As the number of such in\r\nthe civil list is increased removals from office will diminish.\r\n\r\nWhile a Treasury surplus is not the greatest evil, it is a serious\r\nevil. Our revenue should be ample to meet the ordinary annual demands\r\nupon our Treasury, with a sufficient margin for those extraordinary but\r\nscarcely less imperative demands which arise now and then. Expenditure\r\nshould always be made with economy and only upon public necessity.\r\nWastefulness, profligacy, or favoritism in public expenditures is\r\ncriminal. But there is nothing in the condition of our country or of\r\nour people to suggest that anything presently necessary to the public\r\nprosperity, security, or honor should be unduly postponed.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty of Congress wisely to forecast and estimate\r\nthese extraordinary demands, and, having added them to our ordinary\r\nexpenditures, to so adjust our revenue laws that no considerable annual\r\nsurplus will remain. We will fortunately be able to apply to the\r\nredemption of the public debt any small and unforeseen excess of\r\nrevenue. This is better than to reduce our income below our necessary\r\nexpenditures, with the resulting choice between another change of our\r\nrevenue laws and an increase of the public debt. It is quite possible,\r\nI am sure, to effect the necessary reduction in our revenues without\r\nbreaking down our protective tariff or seriously injuring any domestic\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a sufficient number of modern war ships and of\r\ntheir necessary armament should progress as rapidly as is consistent\r\nwith care and perfection in plans and workmanship. The spirit, courage,\r\nand skill of our naval officers and seamen have many times in our\r\nhistory given to weak ships and inefficient guns a rating greatly\r\nbeyond that of the naval list. That they will again do so upon occasion\r\nI do not doubt; but they ought not, by premeditation or neglect, to\r\nbe left to the risks and exigencies of an unequal combat. We should\r\nencourage the establishment of American steamship lines. The exchanges\r\nof commerce demand stated, reliable, and rapid means of communication,\r\nand until these are provided the development of our trade with the\r\nStates lying south of us is impossible.\r\n\r\nOur pension laws should give more adequate and discriminating relief to\r\nthe Union soldiers and sailors and to their widows and orphans. Such\r\noccasions as this should remind us that we owe everything to their\r\nvalor and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of congratulation that there is a near prospect of the\r\nadmission into the Union of the Dakotas and Montana and Washington\r\nTerritories. This act of justice has been unreasonably delayed in the\r\ncase of some of them. The people who have settled these Territories are\r\nintelligent, enterprising, and patriotic, and the accession of these\r\nnew States will add strength to the nation. It is due to the settlers\r\nin the Territories who have availed themselves of the invitations of\r\nour land laws to make homes upon the public domain that their titles\r\nshould be speedily adjusted and their honest entries confirmed by\r\npatent.\r\n\r\nIt is very gratifying to observe the general interest now being\r\nmanifested in the reform of our election laws. Those who have been for\r\nyears calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about the\r\nballot box and about the elector further safeguards, in order that our\r\nelections might not only be free and pure, but might clearly appear to\r\nbe so, will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon discover\r\nthe need of reform. The National Congress has not as yet taken control\r\nof elections in that case over which the Constitution gives it\r\njurisdiction, but has accepted and adopted the election laws of the\r\nseveral States, provided penalties for their violation and a method\r\nof supervision. Only the inefficiency of the State laws or an unfair\r\npartisan administration of them could suggest a departure from this\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly, however, in the contemplation of the framers of the\r\nConstitution that such an exigency might arise, and provision was\r\nwisely made for it. The freedom of the ballot is a condition of our\r\nnational life, and no power vested in Congress or in the Executive to\r\nsecure or perpetuate it should remain unused upon occasion. The people\r\nof all the Congressional districts have an equal interest that the\r\nelection in each shall truly express the views and wishes of a majority\r\nof the qualified electors residing within it. The results of such\r\nelections are not local, and the insistence of electors residing in\r\nother districts that they shall be pure and free does not savor at all\r\nof impertinence.\r\n\r\nIf in any of the States the public security is thought to be threatened\r\nby ignorance among the electors, the obvious remedy is education. The\r\nsympathy and help of our people will not be withheld from any community\r\nstruggling with special embarrassments or difficulties connected with\r\nthe suffrage if the remedies proposed proceed upon lawful lines and are\r\npromoted by just and honorable methods. How shall those who practice\r\nelection frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot\r\nwhich is the first condition and obligation of good citizenship? The\r\nman who has come to regard the ballot box as a juggler's hat has\r\nrenounced his allegiance.\r\n\r\nLet us exalt patriotism and moderate our party contentions. Let those\r\nwho would die for the flag on the field of battle give a better proof\r\nof their patriotism and a higher glory to their country by promoting\r\nfraternity and justice. A party success that is achieved by unfair\r\nmethods or by practices that partake of revolution is hurtful and\r\nevanescent even from a party standpoint. We should hold our differing\r\nopinions in mutual respect, and, having submitted them to the\r\narbitrament of the ballot, should accept an adverse judgment with the\r\nsame respect that we would have demanded of our opponents if the\r\ndecision had been in our favor.\r\n\r\nNo other people have a government more worthy of their respect and love\r\nor a land so magnificent in extent, so pleasant to look upon, and so\r\nfull of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor. God has placed\r\nupon our head a diadem and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond\r\ndefinition or calculation. But we must not forget that we take these\r\ngifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall hold the reins\r\nof power and that the upward avenues of hope shall be free to all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI do not mistrust the future. Dangers have been in frequent\r\nambush along our path, but we have uncovered and vanquished them all.\r\nPassion has swept some of our communities, but only to give us a new\r\ndemonstration that the great body of our people are stable, patriotic,\r\nand law-abiding. No political party can long pursue advantage at the\r\nexpense of public honor or by rude and indecent methods without protest\r\nand fatal disaffection in its own body. The peaceful agencies of\r\ncommerce are more fully revealing the necessary unity of all our\r\ncommunities, and the increasing intercourse of our people is promoting\r\nmutual respect. We shall find unalloyed pleasure in the revelation\r\nwhich our next census will make of the swift development of the great\r\nresources of some of the States. Each State will bring its generous\r\ncontribution to the great aggregate of the nation's increase. And when\r\nthe harvests from the fields, the cattle from the hills, and the ores\r\nof the earth shall have been weighed, counted, and valued, we will turn\r\nfrom them all to crown with the highest honor the State that has most\r\npromoted education, virtue, justice, and patriotism among its people.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 17, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to the Senate resolution of the 11th\r\nultimo, a report of the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers,\r\nin regard to the case of Louis Riel, otherwise known as Louis David\r\nRiel.[1]\r\n\r\nBENJ.

thence north along and with the said degree to a point\r\nwhere the same intersects the Cimarron River; thence up said river,\r\nalong the right bank thereof, to a point where the same is intersected\r\nby the south line of what is known as the Cherokee lands lying west of\r\nthe Arkansas River, or as the \"Cherokee Outlet,\" said line being the\r\nnorth line of the lands ceded by the Muscogee (or Creek) Nation of\r\nIndians to the United States by the treaty of June 14, 1866;

At noon on the 30th day of April, 1789,\r\nin the city of New York, and in the presence of an assemblage of the\r\nheroic men whose patriotic devotion had led the colonies to victory and\r\nindependence, George Washington took the oath of office as Chief\r\nMagistrate of the new-born Republic. This impressive act was preceded\r\nat 9 o'clock in the morning in all the churches of the city by prayer\r\nfor God's blessing on the Government and its first President.\r\n\r\nThe centennial of this illustrious event in our history has been\r\ndeclared a general holiday by act of Congress, to the end that the\r\npeople of the whole country may join in commemorative exercises\r\nappropriate to the day.\r\n\r\nIn order that the joy of the occasion may be associated with a deep\r\nthankfulness in the minds of the people for all our blessings in the\r\npast and a devout supplication to God for their gracious continuance in\r\nthe future, the representatives of the religious creeds, both Christian\r\nand Hebrew, have memorialized the Government to designate an hour for\r\nprayer and thanksgiving on that day.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in response to this pious and reasonable request, do recommend\r\nthat on Tuesday, April 30, at the hour of 9 o'clock in the morning,\r\nthe people of the entire country repair to their respective places\r\nof divine worship to implore the favor of God that the blessings of\r\nliberty, prosperity, and peace may abide with us as a people, and that\r\nHis hand may lead us in the paths of righteousness and good deeds.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States of America to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone in the city of Washington, this 4th day of April, A.D. 1889, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\nthirteenth.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 3, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThere are few transactions in the administration of the Government\r\nthat are even temporarily held in the confidence of those charged\r\nwith the conduct of the public business. Every step taken is under the\r\nobservation of an intelligent and watchful people. The state of the\r\nUnion is known from day to day, and suggestions as to needed legislation\r\nfind an earlier voice than that which speaks in these annual\r\ncommunications of the President to Congress.\r\n\r\nGood will and cordiality have characterized our relations and\r\ncorrespondence with other governments, and the year just closed leaves\r\nfew international questions of importance remaining unadjusted. No\r\nobstacle is believed to exist that can long postpone the consideration\r\nand adjustment of the still pending questions upon satisfactory and\r\nhonorable terms. The dealings of this Government with other states have\r\nbeen and should always be marked by frankness and sincerity, our\r\npurposes avowed, and our methods free from intrigue. This course has\r\nborne rich fruit in the past, and it is our duty as a nation to preserve\r\nthe heritage of good repute which a century of right dealing with\r\nforeign governments has secured to us.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of high significance and no less of congratulation that\r\nthe first year of the second century of our constitutional existence\r\nfinds as honored guests within our borders the representatives of all\r\nthe independent States of North and South America met together in\r\nearnest conference touching the best methods of perpetuating and\r\nexpanding the relations of mutual interest and friendliness existing\r\namong them. That the opportunity thus afforded for promoting closer\r\ninternational relations and the increased prosperity of the States\r\nrepresented will be used for the mutual good of all I can not permit\r\nmyself to doubt. Our people will await with interest and confidence the\r\nresults to flow from so auspicious a meeting of allied and in large part\r\nidentical interests.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of this international conference of enlightened\r\nstatesmen will doubtless have the considerate attention of Congress and\r\nits cooperation in the removal of unnecessary barriers to beneficial\r\nintercourse between the nations of America. But while the commercial\r\nresults which it is hoped will follow this conference are worthy of\r\npursuit and of the great interests they have excited, it is believed\r\nthat the crowning benefit will be found in the better securities which\r\nmay be devised for the maintenance of peace among all American nations\r\nand the settlement of all contentions by methods that a Christian\r\ncivilization can approve. While viewing with interest our national\r\nresources and products, the delegates will, I am sure, find a higher\r\nsatisfaction in the evidences of unselfish friendship which everywhere\r\nattend their intercourse with our people.\r\n\r\nAnother international conference having great possibilities for good has\r\nlately assembled and is now in session in this capital. An invitation\r\nwas extended by the Government, under the act of Congress of July 9,\r\n1888, to all maritime nations to send delegates to confer touching the\r\nrevision and amendment of the rules and regulations governing vessels\r\nat sea and to adopt a uniform system of marine signals. The response to\r\nthis invitation has been very general and very cordial. Delegates from\r\ntwenty-six nations are present in the conference, and they have entered\r\nupon their useful work with great zeal and with an evident appreciation\r\nof its importance. So far as the agreement to be reached may require\r\nlegislation to give it effect, the cooperation of Congress is\r\nconfidently relied upon.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting, if not, indeed, an unprecedented, fact that the\r\ntwo international conferences have brought together here the accredited\r\nrepresentatives of thirty-three nations.\r\n\r\nBolivia, Ecuador, and Honduras are now represented by resident envoys of\r\nthe plenipotentiary grade. All the States of the American system now\r\nmaintain diplomatic representation at this capital.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be noted that all the nations of the Western\r\nHemisphere, with one exception, send to Washington envoys extraordinary\r\nand ministers plenipotentiary, being the highest grade accredited to\r\nthis Government. The United States, on the contrary, sends envoys of\r\nlower grades to some of our sister Republics. Our representative in\r\nParaguay and Uruguay is a minister resident, while to Bolivia we send a\r\nminister resident and consul-general. In view of the importance of our\r\nrelations with the States of the American system, our diplomatic agents\r\nin those countries should be of the uniform rank of envoy extraordinary\r\nand minister plenipotentiary. Certain missions were so elevated by the\r\nlast Congress with happy effect, and I recommend the completion of the\r\nreform thus begun, with the inclusion also of Hawaii and Hayti, in view\r\nof their relations to the American system of states.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that timely provision be made for extending to Hawaii\r\nan invitation to be represented in the international conference now\r\nsitting at this capital.\r\n\r\nOur relations with China have the attentive consideration which their\r\nmagnitude and interest demand. The failure of the treaty negotiated\r\nunder the Administration of my predecessor for the further and more\r\ncomplete restriction of Chinese labor immigration, and with it the\r\nlegislation of the last session of Congress dependent thereon, leaves\r\nsome questions open which Congress should now approach in that wise and\r\njust spirit which should characterize the relations of two great and\r\nfriendly powers. While our supreme interests demand the exclusion of\r\na laboring element which experience has shown to be incompatible with\r\nour social life, all steps to compass this imperative need should be\r\naccompanied with a recognition of the claim of those strangers now\r\nlawfully among us to humane and just treatment.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the young Emperor of China marks, we may hope, an era\r\nof progress and prosperity for the great country over which he is called\r\nto rule.\r\n\r\nThe present state of affairs in respect to the Samoan Islands is\r\nencouraging. The conference which was held in this city in the summer\r\nof 1887 between the representatives of the United States, Germany, and\r\nGreat Britain having been adjourned because of the persistent divergence\r\nof views which was developed in its deliberations, the subsequent course\r\nof events in the islands gave rise to questions of a serious character.\r\nOn the 4th of February last the German minister at this capital, in\r\nbehalf of his Government, proposed a resumption of the conference at\r\nBerlin. This proposition was accepted, as Congress in February last was\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the understanding thus reached, commissioners were appointed\r\nby me, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, who proceeded\r\nto Berlin, where the conference was renewed. The deliberations extended\r\nthrough several weeks, and resulted in the conclusion of a treaty which\r\nwill be submitted to the Senate for its approval. I trust that the\r\nefforts which have been made to effect an adjustment of this question\r\nwill be productive of the permanent establishment of law and order in\r\nSamoa upon the basis of the maintenance of the rights and interests of\r\nthe natives as well as of the treaty powers.\r\n\r\nThe questions which have arisen during the past few years between Great\r\nBritain and the United States are in abeyance or in course of amicable\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the government of the Dominion of Canada an effort has\r\nbeen apparent during the season just ended to administer the laws and\r\nregulations applicable to the fisheries with as little occasion for\r\nfriction as was possible, and the temperate representations of this\r\nGovernment in respect of cases of undue hardship or of harsh\r\ninterpretations have been in most cases met with measures of transitory\r\nrelief. It is trusted that the attainment of our just rights under\r\nexisting treaties and in virtue of the concurrent legislation of the two\r\ncontiguous countries will not be long deferred and that all existing\r\ncauses of difference may be equitably adjusted.\r\n\r\nI recommend that provision be made by an international agreement for\r\nvisibly marking the water boundary between the United States and Canada\r\nin the narrow channels that join the Great Lakes. The conventional line\r\ntherein traced by the northwestern boundary survey years ago is not in\r\nall cases readily ascertainable for the settlement of jurisdictional\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nA just and acceptable enlargement of the list of offenses for which\r\nextradition may be claimed and granted is most desirable between this\r\ncountry and Great Britain. The territory of neither should become a\r\nsecure harbor for the evil doers of the other through any avoidable\r\nshortcoming in this regard. A new treaty on this subject between the two\r\npowers has been recently negotiated and will soon be laid before the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the commerce of Cuba and Puerto Rico with the United\r\nStates, their nearest and principal market, justifies the expectation\r\nthat the existing relations may be beneficially expanded. The\r\nimpediments resulting from varying dues on navigation and from the\r\nvexatious treatment of our vessels on merely technical grounds of\r\ncomplaint in West India ports should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe progress toward an adjustment of pending claims between the United\r\nStates and Spain is not as rapid as could be desired.\r\n\r\nQuestions affecting American interests in connection with railways\r\nconstructed and operated by our citizens in Peru have claimed the\r\nattention of this Government. It is urged that other governments in\r\npressing Peru to the payment of their claims have disregarded the\r\nproperty rights of American citizens. The matter will be carefully\r\ninvestigated with a view to securing a proper and equitable adjustment.\r\n\r\nA similar issue is now pending with Portugal. The Delagoa Bay Railway,\r\nin Africa, was constructed under a concession by Portugal to an American\r\ncitizen. When nearly completed the road was seized by the agents of the\r\nPortuguese Government. Formal protest has been made through our minister\r\nat Lisbon against this act, and no proper effort will be spared to\r\nsecure proper relief.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the charter granted by Congress and under the terms of\r\nits contract with the Government of Nicaragua the Interoceanic Canal\r\nCompany has begun the construction of the important waterway between the\r\ntwo oceans which its organization contemplates. Grave complications for\r\na time seemed imminent, in view of a supposed conflict of jurisdiction\r\nbetween Nicaragua and Costa Rica in regard to the accessory privileges\r\nto be conceded by the latter Republic toward the construction of works\r\non the San Juan River, of which the right bank is Costa Rican territory.\r\nI am happy to learn that a friendly arrangement has been effected\r\nbetween the two nations. This Government has held itself ready to\r\npromote in every proper way the adjustment of all questions that might\r\npresent obstacles to the completion of a work of such transcendent\r\nimportance to the commerce of this country, and, indeed, to the\r\ncommercial interests of the world.\r\n\r\nThe traditional good feeling between this country and the French\r\nRepublic has received additional testimony in the participation of\r\nour Government and people in the international exposition held at\r\nParis during the past summer. The success of our exhibitors has been\r\ngratifying. The report of the commission will be laid before Congress\r\nin due season.\r\n\r\nThis Government has accepted, under proper reserve as to its policy in\r\nforeign territories, the invitation of the Government of Belgium to take\r\npart in an international congress, which opened at Brussels on the 16th\r\nof November, for the purpose of devising measures to promote the\r\nabolition of the slave trade in Africa and to prevent the shipment of\r\nslaves by sea. Our interest in the extinction of this crime against\r\nhumanity in the regions where it yet survives has been increased by the\r\nresults of emancipation within our own borders.\r\n\r\nWith Germany the most cordial relations continue. The questions arising\r\nfrom the return to the Empire of Germans naturalized in this country are\r\nconsidered and disposed of in a temperate spirit to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of both Governments.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of great satisfaction that the internal disturbances of\r\nthe Republic of Hayti are at last happily ended, and that an apparently\r\nstable government has been constituted. It has been duly recognized by\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nA mixed commission is now in session in this capital for the settlement\r\nof long-standing claims against the Republic of Venezuela, and it is\r\nhoped that a satisfactory conclusion will be speedily reached. This\r\nGovernment has not hesitated to express its earnest desire that the\r\nboundary dispute now pending between Great Britain and Venezuela may be\r\nadjusted amicably and in strict accordance with the historic title of\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the Empire of Japan has been evidenced by the recent\r\npromulgation of a new constitution, containing valuable guaranties of\r\nliberty and providing for a responsible ministry to conduct the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is earnestly recommended that our judicial rights and processes in\r\nKorea be established on a firm basis by providing the machinery\r\nnecessary to carry out treaty stipulations in that regard.\r\n\r\nThe friendliness of the Persian Government continues to be shown by its\r\ngenerous treatment of Americans engaged in missionary labors and by the\r\ncordial disposition of the Shah to encourage the enterprise of our\r\ncitizens in the development of Persian resources.\r\n\r\nA discussion is in progress touching the jurisdictional treaty rights of\r\nthe United States in Turkey. An earnest effort will be made to define\r\nthose rights to the satisfaction of both Governments.\r\n\r\nQuestions continue to arise in our relations with several countries in\r\nrespect to the rights of naturalized citizens. Especially is this the\r\ncase with France, Italy, Russia, and Turkey, and to a less extent with\r\nSwitzerland. From time to time earnest efforts have been made to\r\nregulate this subject by conventions with those countries. An improper\r\nuse of naturalization should not be permitted, but it is most important\r\nthat those who have been duly naturalized should everywhere be accorded\r\nrecognition of the rights pertaining to the citizenship of the country\r\nof their adoption. The appropriateness of special conventions for that\r\npurpose is recognized in treaties which this Government has concluded\r\nwith a number of European States, and it is advisable that the\r\ndifficulties which now arise in our relations with other countries on\r\nthe same subject should be similarly adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe recent revolution in Brazil in favor of the establishment of a\r\nrepublican form of government is an event of great interest to the\r\nUnited States. Our minister at Rio de Janeiro was at once instructed to\r\nmaintain friendly diplomatic relations with the Provisional Government,\r\nand the Brazilian representatives at this capital were instructed by\r\nthe Provisional Government to continue their functions. Our friendly\r\nintercourse with Brazil has therefore suffered no interruption.\r\n\r\nOur minister has been further instructed to extend on the part of this\r\nGovernment a formal and cordial recognition of the new Republic so soon\r\nas the majority of the people of Brazil shall have signified their\r\nassent to its establishment and maintenance.\r\n\r\nWithin our own borders a general condition of prosperity prevails. The\r\nharvests of the last summer were exceptionally abundant, and the trade\r\nconditions now prevailing seem to promise a successful season to the\r\nmerchant and the manufacturer and general employment to our working\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1889, has been prepared and will be presented to Congress.\r\nIt presents with clearness the fiscal operations of the Government, and\r\nI avail myself of it to obtain some facts for use here.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate receipts from all sources for the year were\r\n$387,050,058.84, derived as follows:\r\n\r\n  From customs                                          $223,832,741.69\r\n  From internal revenue                                  130,881,513.92\r\n  From miscellaneous sources                              32,335,803.23\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary expenditures for the same period were $281,996,615.60,\r\nand the total expenditures, including the sinking fund, were\r\n$329,579,929.25. The excess of receipts over expenditures was, after\r\nproviding for the sinking fund, $57,470,129.59.\r\n\r\nFor the current fiscal year the total revenues, actual and estimated,\r\nare $385,000,000, and the ordinary expenditures, actual and estimated,\r\nare $293,000,000, making with the sinking fund a total expenditure of\r\n$341,321,116.99, leaving an estimated surplus of $43,678,883.01.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year there was applied to the purchase of bonds, in\r\naddition to those for the sinking fund, $90,456,172.35, and during the\r\nfirst quarter of the current year the sum of $37,838,937.77, all of\r\nwhich were credited to the sinking fund. The revenues for the fiscal\r\nyear ending June 30, 1891, are estimated by the Treasury Department at\r\n$385,000,000, and the expenditures for the same period, including the\r\nsinking fund, at $341,430,477.70. This shows an estimated surplus for\r\nthat year of $43,569,522.30, which is more likely to be increased than\r\nreduced when the actual transactions are written up.\r\n\r\nThe existence of so large an actual and anticipated surplus should\r\nhave the immediate attention of Congress, with a view to reducing the\r\nreceipts of the Treasury to the needs of the Government as closely as\r\nmay be. The collection of moneys not needed for public uses imposes an\r\nunnecessary burden upon our people, and the presence of so large a\r\nsurplus in the public vaults is a disturbing element in the conduct\r\nof private business. It has called into use expedients for putting\r\nit into circulation of very questionable propriety. We should not\r\ncollect revenue for the purpose of anticipating our bonds beyond the\r\nrequirements of the sinking fund, but any unappropriated surplus in the\r\nTreasury should be so used, as there is no other lawful way of returning\r\nthe money to circulation, and the profit realized by the Government\r\noffers a substantial advantage.\r\n\r\nThe loaning of public funds to the banks without interest upon the\r\nsecurity of Government bonds I regard as an unauthorized and dangerous\r\nexpedient. It results in a temporary and unnatural increase of the\r\nbanking capital of favored localities and compels a cautious and gradual\r\nrecall of the deposits to avoid injury to the commercial interests. It\r\nis not to be expected that the banks having these deposits will sell\r\ntheir bonds to the Treasury so long as the present highly beneficial\r\narrangement is continued. They now practically get interest both upon\r\nthe bonds and their proceeds. No further use should be made of this\r\nmethod of getting the surplus into circulation, and the deposits now\r\noutstanding should be gradually withdrawn and applied to the purchase of\r\nbonds. It is fortunate that such a use can be made of the existing\r\nsurplus, and for some time to come of any casual surplus that may exist\r\nafter Congress has taken the necessary steps for a reduction of the\r\nrevenue. Such legislation should be promptly but very considerately\r\nenacted.\r\n\r\nI recommend a revision of our tariff law both in its administrative\r\nfeatures and in the schedules. The need of the former is generally\r\nconceded, and an agreement upon the evils and inconveniences to be\r\nremedied and the best methods for their correction will probably not be\r\ndifficult. Uniformity of valuation at all our ports is essential, and\r\neffective measures should be taken to secure it. It is equally desirable\r\nthat questions affecting rates and classifications should be promptly\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a new schedule of customs duties is a matter of great\r\ndelicacy because of its direct effect upon the business of the country,\r\nand of great difficulty by reason of the wide divergence of opinion as\r\nto the objects that may properly be promoted by such legislation. Some\r\ndisturbance of business may perhaps result from the consideration of\r\nthis subject by Congress, but this temporary ill effect will be reduced\r\nto the minimum by prompt action and by the assurance which the country\r\nalready enjoys that any necessary changes will be so made as not to\r\nimpair the just and reasonable protection of our home industries. The\r\ninequalities of the law should be adjusted, but the protective principle\r\nshould be maintained and fairly applied to the products of our farms as\r\nwell as of our shops. These duties necessarily have relation to other\r\nthings besides the public revenues. We can not limit their effects by\r\nfixing our eyes on the public Treasury alone. They have a direct\r\nrelation to home production, to work, to wages, and to the commercial\r\nindependence of our country, and the wise and patriotic legislator\r\nshould enlarge the field of his vision to include all of these. The\r\nnecessary reduction in our public revenues can, I am sure, be made\r\nwithout making the smaller burden more onerous than the larger by reason\r\nof the disabilities and limitations which the process of reduction puts\r\nupon both capital and labor. The free list can very safely be extended\r\nby placing thereon articles that do not offer injurious competition to\r\nsuch domestic products as our home labor can supply. The removal of the\r\ninternal tax upon tobacco would relieve an important agricultural\r\nproduct from a burden which was imposed only because our revenue from\r\ncustoms duties was insufficient for the public needs. If safe provision\r\nagainst fraud can be devised, the removal of the tax upon spirits used\r\nin the arts and in manufactures would also offer an unobjectionable\r\nmethod of reducing the surplus.\r\n\r\nA table presented by the Secretary of the Treasury showing the amount\r\nof money of all kinds in circulation each year from 1878 to the present\r\ntime is of interest. It appears that the amount of national-bank notes\r\nin circulation has decreased during that period $114,109,729, of which\r\n$37,799,229 is chargeable to the last year. The withdrawal of bank\r\ncirculation will necessarily continue under existing conditions. It is\r\nprobable that the adoption of the suggestions made by the Comptroller\r\nof the Currency, namely, that the minimum deposit of bonds for the\r\nestablishment of banks be reduced and that an issue of notes to the\r\npar value of the bonds be allowed, would help to maintain the bank\r\ncirculation. But while this withdrawal of bank notes has been going on\r\nthere has been a large increase in the amount of gold and silver coin in\r\ncirculation and in the issues of gold and silver certificates.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of money of all kinds in circulation on March 1,\r\n1878, was $805,793,807, while on October 1, 1889, the total was\r\n$1,405,018,000. There was an increase of $293,417,552 in gold coin,\r\nof $57,554,100 in standard silver dollars, of $72,311,249 in gold\r\ncertificates, of $276,619,715 in silver certificates, and of $14,073,787\r\nin United States notes, making a total of $713,976,403. There was during\r\nthe same period a decrease of $114,109,729 in bank circulation and of\r\n$642,481 in subsidiary silver. The net increase was $599,224,193. The\r\ncirculation per capita has increased about $5 during the time covered by\r\nthe table referred to.\r\n\r\nThe total coinage of silver dollars was on November 1, 1889,\r\n$343,638,001, of which $283,539,521 were in the Treasury vaults and\r\n$60,098,480 were in circulation. Of the amount in the vaults\r\n$277,319,944 were represented by outstanding silver certificates,\r\nleaving $6,219,577 not in circulation and not represented by\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\nThe law requiring the purchase by the Treasury of $2,000,000 worth of\r\nsilver bullion each month, to be coined into silver dollars of 412-1/2\r\ngrains, has been observed by the Department, but neither the present\r\nSecretary nor any of his predecessors has deemed it safe to exercise the\r\ndiscretion given by law to increase the monthly purchases to $4,000,000.\r\nWhen the law was enacted (February 28, 1878) the price of silver in the\r\nmarket was $1.204 Per ounce, making the bullion value of the dollar 93\r\ncents. Since that time the price has fallen as low as 91.2 cents per\r\nounce, reducing the bullion value of the dollar to 70.6 cents. Within\r\nthe last few months the market price has somewhat advanced, and on the\r\n1st day of November last the bullion value of the silver dollar was 72\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nThe evil anticipations which have accompanied the coinage and use of the\r\nsilver dollar have not been realized. As a coin it has not had general\r\nuse, and the public Treasury has been compelled to store it. But this\r\nis manifestly owing to the fact that its paper representative is more\r\nconvenient. The general acceptance and the use of the silver certificate\r\nshow that silver has not been otherwise discredited. Some favorable\r\nconditions have contributed to maintain this practical equality in their\r\ncommercial use between the gold and silver dollars; but some of these\r\nare trade conditions that statutory enactments do not control and of the\r\ncontinuance of which we can not be certain.\r\n\r\nI think it is clear that if we should make the coinage of silver at the\r\npresent ratio free we must expect that the difference in the bullion\r\nvalues of the gold and silver dollars will be taken account of in\r\ncommercial transactions; and I fear the same result would follow any\r\nconsiderable increase of the present rate of coinage. Such a result\r\nwould be discreditable to our financial management and disastrous to all\r\nbusiness interests. We should not tread the dangerous edge of such a\r\nperil. And, indeed, nothing more harmful could happen to the silver\r\ninterests. Any safe legislation upon this subject must secure the\r\nequality of the two coins in their commercial uses.\r\n\r\nI have always been an advocate of the use of silver in our currency.\r\nWe are large producers of that metal, and should not discredit it. To\r\nthe plan which will be presented by the Secretary of the Treasury for\r\nthe issuance of notes or certificates upon the deposit of silver bullion\r\nat its market value I have been able to give only a hasty examination,\r\nowing to the press of other matters and to the fact that it has been\r\nso recently formulated. The details of such a law require careful\r\nconsideration, but the general plan suggested by him seems to satisfy\r\nthe purpose--to continue the use of silver in connection with our\r\ncurrency and at the same time to obviate the danger of which I have\r\nspoken. At a later day I may communicate further with Congress upon this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the Chinese exclusion act has been found to be very\r\ndifficult on the northwestern frontier. Chinamen landing at Victoria\r\nfind it easy to pass our border, owing to the impossibility with the\r\nforce at the command of the customs officers of guarding so long an\r\ninland line. The Secretary of the Treasury has authorized the employment\r\nof additional officers, who will be assigned to this duty, and every\r\neffort will be made to enforce the law. The Dominion exacts a head tax\r\nof $50 for each Chinaman landed, and when these persons, in fraud of our\r\nlaw, cross into our territory and are apprehended our officers do not\r\nknow what to do with them, as the Dominion authorities will not suffer\r\nthem to be sent back without a second payment of the tax. An effort will\r\nbe made to reach an understanding that will remove this difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation required by section 3 of the act of March 2, 1889,\r\nrelating to the killing of seals and other fur-bearing animals, was\r\nissued by me on the 21st day of March,[2] and a revenue vessel was\r\ndispatched to enforce the laws and protect the interests of the United\r\nStates. The establishment of a refuge station at Point Barrow, as\r\ndirected by Congress, was successfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nJudged by modern standards, we are practically without coast defenses.\r\nMany of the structures we have would enhance rather than diminish the\r\nperils of their garrisons if subjected to the fire of improved guns, and\r\nvery few are so located as to give full effect to the greater range of\r\nsuch guns as we are now making for coast-defense uses. This general\r\nsubject has had consideration in Congress for some years, and the\r\nappropriation for the construction of large rifled guns made one year\r\nago was, I am sure, the expression of a purpose to provide suitable\r\nworks in which these guns might be mounted. An appropriation now made\r\nfor that purpose would not advance the completion of the works beyond\r\nour ability to supply them with fairly effective guns.\r\n\r\nThe security of our coast cities against foreign attacks should not rest\r\naltogether in the friendly disposition of other nations. There should be\r\na second line wholly in our own keeping. I very urgently recommend an\r\nappropriation at this session for the construction of such works in our\r\nmost exposed harbors.\r\n\r\nI approve the suggestion of the Secretary of War that provision be made\r\nfor encamping companies of the National Guard in our coast works for\r\na specified time each year and for their training in the use of heavy\r\nguns. His suggestion that an increase of the artillery force of the Army\r\nis desirable is also, in this connection, commended to the consideration\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of our important rivers and harbors should be promoted\r\nby the necessary appropriations. Care should be taken that the\r\nGovernment is not committed to the prosecution of works not of public\r\nand general advantage and that the relative usefulness of works of that\r\nclass is not overlooked. So far as this work can ever be said to be\r\ncompleted, I do not doubt that the end would be sooner and more\r\neconomically reached if fewer separate works were undertaken at the same\r\ntime, and those selected for their greater general interest were more\r\nrapidly pushed to completion. A work once considerably begun should not\r\nbe subjected to the risks and deterioration which interrupted or\r\ninsufficient appropriations necessarily occasion.\r\n\r\nThe assault made by David S. Terry upon the person of Justice Field,\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States, at Lathrop, Cal., in August\r\nlast, and the killing of the assailant by a deputy United States marshal\r\nwho had been deputed to accompany Justice Field and to protect him from\r\nanticipated violence at the hands of Terry, in connection with the legal\r\nproceedings which have followed, suggest questions which, in my\r\njudgment, are worthy of the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nI recommend that more definite provision be made by law not only for the\r\nprotection of Federal officers, but for a full trial of such cases in\r\nthe United States courts. In recommending such legislation I do not at\r\nall impeach either the general adequacy of the provision made by the\r\nState laws for the protection of all citizens or the general good\r\ndisposition of those charged with the execution of such laws to give\r\nprotection to the officers of the United States. The duty of protecting\r\nits officers, as such, and of punishing those who assault them on\r\naccount of their official acts should not be devolved expressly or by\r\nacquiescence upon the local authorities.\r\n\r\nEvents which have been brought to my attention happening in other\r\nparts of the country have also suggested the propriety of extending by\r\nlegislation fuller protection to those who may be called as witnesses in\r\nthe courts of the United States. The law compels those who are supposed\r\nto have knowledge of public offenses to attend upon our courts and grand\r\njuries and to give evidence. There is a manifest resulting duty that\r\nthese witnesses shall be protected from injury on account of their\r\ntestimony. The investigations of criminal offenses are often rendered\r\nfutile and the punishment of crime impossible by the intimidation of\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of providing some more speedy method for disposing of the\r\ncases which now come for final adjudication to the Supreme Court becomes\r\nevery year more apparent and urgent. The plan of providing some\r\nintermediate courts having final appellate jurisdiction of certain\r\nclasses of questions and cases has, I think, received a more general\r\napproval from the bench and bar of the country than any other. Without\r\nattempting to discuss details, I recommend that provision be made for\r\nthe establishment of such courts.\r\n\r\nThe salaries of the judges of the district courts in many of the\r\ndistricts are, in my judgment, inadequate. I recommend that all such\r\nsalaries now below $5,000 per annum be increased to that amount. It is\r\nquite true that the amount of labor performed by these judges is very\r\nunequal, but as they can not properly engage in other pursuits to\r\nsupplement their incomes the salary should be such in all cases as to\r\nprovide an independent and comfortable support.\r\n\r\nEarnest attention should be given by Congress to a consideration of the\r\nquestion how far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly\r\ncalled \"trusts\" is matter of Federal jurisdiction. When organized, as\r\nthey often are, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize\r\nthe production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity,\r\nthey are dangerous conspiracies against the public good, and should be\r\nmade the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation.\r\n\r\nThe subject of an international copyright has been frequently commended\r\nto the attention of Congress by my predecessors. The enactment of such a\r\nlaw would be eminently wise and just.\r\n\r\nOur naturalization laws should be so revised as to make the inquiry into\r\nthe moral character and good disposition toward our Government of the\r\npersons applying for citizenship more thorough. This can only be done\r\nby taking fuller control of the examination, by fixing the times for\r\nhearing such applications, and by requiring the presence of some one who\r\nshall represent the Government in the inquiry. Those who are the avowed\r\nenemies of social order or who come to our shores to swell the injurious\r\ninfluence and to extend the evil practices of any association that\r\ndefies our laws should not only be denied citizenship, but a domicile.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of a national bankrupt law of a character to be a\r\npermanent part of our general legislation is desirable. It should be\r\nsimple in its methods and inexpensive in its administration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General not only exhibits the operations\r\nof the Department for the last fiscal year, but contains many valuable\r\nsuggestions for the improvement and extension of the service, which are\r\ncommended to your attention. No other branch of the Government has so\r\nclose a contact with the daily life of the people. Almost everyone uses\r\nthe service it offers, and every hour gained in the transmission of the\r\ngreat commercial mails has an actual and possible value that only those\r\nengaged in trade can understand.\r\n\r\nThe saving of one day in the transmission of the mails between New York\r\nand San Francisco, which has recently been accomplished, is an incident\r\nworthy of mention.\r\n\r\nThe plan suggested of a supervision of the post-offices in separate\r\ndistricts that shall involve instruction and suggestion and a rating\r\nof the efficiency of the postmasters would, I have no doubt, greatly\r\nimprove the service.\r\n\r\nA pressing necessity exists for the erection of a building for the joint\r\nuse of the Department and of the city post-office. The Department was\r\npartially relieved by renting outside quarters for a part of its force,\r\nbut it is again overcrowded. The building used by the city office never\r\nwas fit for the purpose, and is now inadequate and unwholesome.\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory condition of the law relating to the transmission\r\nthrough the mails of lottery advertisements and remittances is clearly\r\nstated by the Postmaster-General, and his suggestion as to amendments\r\nshould have your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows a reorganization of the\r\nbureaus of the Department that will, I do not doubt, promote the\r\nefficiency of each.\r\n\r\nIn general, satisfactory progress has been made in the construction of\r\nthe new ships of war authorized by Congress. The first vessel of the new\r\nNavy, the _Dolphin_, was subjected to very severe trial tests and to\r\nvery much adverse criticism; but it is gratifying to be able to state\r\nthat a cruise around the world, from which she has recently returned,\r\nhas demonstrated that she is a first-class vessel of her rate.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary shows that while the effective force of the\r\nNavy is rapidly increasing by reason of the improved build and armament\r\nof the new ships, the number of our ships fit for sea duty grows very\r\nslowly. We had on the 4th of March last 37 serviceable ships, and though\r\n4 have since been added to the list, the total has not been increased,\r\nbecause in the meantime 4 have been lost or condemned. Twenty-six\r\nadditional vessels have been authorized and appropriated for; but it is\r\nprobable that when they are completed our list will only be increased to\r\n42--a gain of 5. The old wooden-ships are disappearing almost as fast as\r\nthe new vessels are added. These facts carry their own argument. One of\r\nthe new ships may in fighting strength be equal to two of the old, but\r\nit can not do the cruising duty of two. It is important, therefore, that\r\nwe should have a more rapid increase in the number of serviceable ships.\r\nI concur in the recommendation of the Secretary that the construction of\r\n8 armored ships, 3 gunboats, and 5 torpedo boats be authorized.\r\n\r\nAn appalling calamity befell three of our naval vessels on duty at the\r\nSamoan Islands, in the harbor of Apia, in March last, involving the\r\nloss of 4 officers and 47 seamen, of two vessels, the _Trenton_ and the\r\n_Vandalia_, and the disabling of a third, the _Nipsic_. Three vessels of\r\nthe German navy, also in the harbor, shared with our ships the force of\r\nthe hurricane and suffered even more heavily. While mourning the brave\r\nofficers and men who died facing with high resolve perils greater than\r\nthose of battle, it is most gratifying to state that the credit of the\r\nAmerican Navy for seamanship, courage, and generosity was magnificently\r\nsustained in the storm-beaten harbor of Apia.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits the transactions\r\nof the Government with the Indian tribes. Substantial progress has been\r\nmade in the education of the children of school age and in the allotment\r\nof lands to adult Indians. It is to be regretted that the policy of\r\nbreaking up the tribal relation and of dealing with the Indian as an\r\nindividual did not appear earlier in our legislation. Large reservations\r\nheld in common and the maintenance of the authority of the chiefs and\r\nheadmen have deprived the individual of every incentive to the exercise\r\nof thrift, and the annuity has contributed an affirmative impulse toward\r\na state of confirmed pauperism.\r\n\r\nOur treaty stipulations should be observed with fidelity and our\r\nlegislation should be highly considerate of the best interests of\r\nan ignorant and helpless people. The reservations are now generally\r\nsurrounded by white settlements. We can no longer push the Indian back\r\ninto the wilderness, and it remains only by every suitable agency to\r\npush him upward into the estate of a self-supporting and responsible\r\ncitizen. For the adult the first step is to locate him upon a farm,\r\nand for the child to place him in a school.\r\n\r\nSchool attendance should be promoted by every moral agency, and those\r\nfailing should be compelled. The national schools for Indians have been\r\nvery successful and should be multiplied, and as far as possible should\r\nbe so organized and conducted as to facilitate the transfer of the\r\nschools to the States or Territories in which they are located when the\r\nIndians in a neighborhood have accepted citizenship and have become\r\notherwise fitted for such a transfer. This condition of things will be\r\nattained slowly, but it will be hastened by keeping it in mind; and in\r\nthe meantime that cooperation between the Government and the mission\r\nschools which has wrought much good should be cordially and impartially\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe last Congress enacted two distinct laws relating to negotiations\r\nwith the Sioux Indians of Dakota for a relinquishment of a portion of\r\ntheir lands to the United States and for dividing the remainder into\r\nseparate reservations. Both were approved on the same day--March 2.\r\nThe one submitted to the Indians a specific proposition; the other\r\n(section 3 of the Indian appropriation act) authorized the President\r\nto appoint three commissioners to negotiate with these Indians for\r\nthe accomplishment of the same general purpose, and required that any\r\nagreements made should be submitted to Congress for ratification.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th day of April last I appointed Hon. Charles Foster, of Ohio,\r\nHon. William Warner, of Missouri, and Major-General George Crook, of the\r\nUnited States Army, commissioners under the last-named law. They were,\r\nhowever, authorized and directed first to submit to the Indians the\r\ndefinite proposition made to them by the act first mentioned, and only\r\nin the event of a failure to secure the assent of the requisite number\r\nto that proposition to open negotiations for modified terms under the\r\nother act. The work of the commission was prolonged and arduous, but the\r\nassent of the requisite number was, it is understood, finally obtained\r\nto the proposition made by Congress, though the report of the commission\r\nhas not yet been submitted. In view of these facts, I shall not, as at\r\npresent advised, deem it necessary to submit the agreement to Congress\r\nfor ratification, but it will in due course be submitted for\r\ninformation. This agreement releases to the United States about\r\n9,000,000 acres of land.\r\n\r\nThe commission provided for by section 14 of the Indian appropriation\r\nbill to negotiate with the Cherokee Indians and all other Indians owning\r\nor claiming lands lying west of the ninety-sixth degree of longitude for\r\nthe cession to the United States of all such lands was constituted by\r\nthe appointment of Hon. Lucius Fairchild, of Wisconsin, Hon. John F.\r\nHartranft, of Pennsylvania, and Hon. Alfred M. Wilson, of Arkansas,\r\nand organized on June 29 last. Their first conference with the\r\nrepresentatives of the Cherokees was held at Tahlequah July 29, with\r\nno definite results. General John F. Hartranft, of Pennsylvania, was\r\nprevented by ill health from taking part in the conference. His death,\r\nwhich occurred recently, is justly and generally lamented by a people he\r\nhad served with conspicuous gallantry in war and with great fidelity in\r\npeace. The vacancy thus created was filled by the appointment of Hon.\r\nWarren G. Sayre, of Indiana.\r\n\r\nA second conference between the commission and the Cherokees was begun\r\nNovember 6, but no results have yet been obtained, nor is it believed\r\nthat a conclusion can be immediately expected. The cattle syndicate now\r\noccupying the lands for grazing purposes is clearly one of the agencies\r\nresponsible for the obstruction of our negotiations with the Cherokees.\r\nThe large body of agricultural lands constituting what is known as the\r\n\"Cherokee Outlet\" ought not to be, and, indeed, can not long be, held\r\nfor grazing and for the advantage of a few against the public interests\r\nand the best advantage of the Indians themselves. The United States\r\nhas now under the treaties certain rights in these lands. These will\r\nnot be used oppressively, but it can not be allowed that those who by\r\nsufferance occupy these lands shall interpose to defeat the wise and\r\nbeneficent purposes of the Government. I can not but believe that the\r\nadvantageous character of the offer made by the United States to the\r\nCherokee Nation for a full release of these lands as compared with other\r\nsuggestions now made to them will yet obtain for it a favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nUnder the agreement made between the United States and the Muscogee (or\r\nCreek) Nation of Indians on the 19th day of January, 1889, an absolute\r\ntitle was secured by the United States to about 3,500,000 acres of land.\r\nSection 12 of the general Indian appropriation act approved March 2,\r\n1889, made provision for the purchase by the United States from the\r\nSeminole tribe of a certain portion of their lands. The delegates of the\r\nSeminole Nation, having first duly evidenced to me their power to act\r\nin that behalf, delivered a proper release or conveyance to the United\r\nStates of all the lands mentioned in the act, which was accepted by\r\nme and certified to be in compliance with the statute.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of both the acts referred to all the lands so purchased\r\nwere declared to be a part of the public domain and open to settlement\r\nunder the homestead law. But of the lands embraced in these purchases,\r\nbeing in the aggregate about 5,500,000 acres, 3,500,000 acres had\r\nalready, under the terms of the treaty of 1866, been acquired by the\r\nUnited States for the purpose of settling other Indian tribes thereon\r\nand had been appropriated to that purpose. The land remaining and\r\navailable for settlement consisted of 1,887,796 acres, surrounded on all\r\nsides by lands in the occupancy of Indian tribes. Congress had provided\r\nno civil government for the people who were to be invited by my\r\nproclamation to settle upon these lands, except as the new court which\r\nhad been established at Muscogee or the United States courts in some of\r\nthe adjoining States had power to enforce the general laws of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of things I was quite reluctant to open the lands to\r\nsettlement; but in view of the fact that several thousand persons, many\r\nof them with their families, had gathered upon the borders of the Indian\r\nTerritory with a view to securing homesteads on the ceded lands, and\r\nthat delay would involve them in much loss and suffering, I did on the\r\n23d day of March last issue a proclamation[3] declaring that the lands\r\ntherein described would be open to settlement under the provisions of\r\nthe law on the 22d day of April following at 12 o'clock noon. Two land\r\ndistricts had been established and the offices were opened for the\r\ntransaction of business when the appointed time arrived.\r\n\r\nIt is much to the credit of the settlers that they very generally\r\nobserved the limitation as to the time when they might enter the\r\nTerritory. Care will be taken that those who entered in violation of the\r\nlaw do not secure the advantage they unfairly sought. There was a good\r\ndeal of apprehension that the strife for locations would result in much\r\nviolence and bloodshed, but happily these anticipations were not\r\nrealized. It is estimated that there are now in the Territory about\r\n60,000 people, and several considerable towns have sprung up, for which\r\ntemporary municipal governments have been organized. Guthrie is said to\r\nhave now a population of almost 8,000. Eleven schools and nine churches\r\nhave been established, and three daily and five weekly newspapers are\r\npublished in this city, whose charter and ordinances have only the\r\nsanction of the voluntary acquiescence of the people from day to day.\r\n\r\nOklahoma City has a population of about 5,000, and is proportionately as\r\nwell provided as Guthrie with churches, schools, and newspapers. Other\r\ntowns and villages having populations of from 100 to 1,000 are scattered\r\nover the Territory.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the peace of this new community in the absence of\r\ncivil government, I directed General Merritt, commanding the Department\r\nof the Missouri, to act in conjunction with the marshals of the United\r\nStates to preserve the peace, and upon their requisition to use the\r\ntroops to aid them in executing warrants and in quieting any riots or\r\nbreaches of the peace that might occur. He was further directed to use\r\nhis influence to promote good order and to avoid any conflicts between\r\nor with the settlers. Believing that the introduction and sale of\r\nliquors where no legal restraints or regulations existed would endanger\r\nthe public peace, and in view of the fact that such liquors must first\r\nbe introduced into the Indian reservations before reaching the white\r\nsettlements, I further directed the general commanding to enforce the\r\nlaws relating to the introduction of ardent spirits into the Indian\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the troops has given a sense of security to the\r\nwell-disposed citizens and has tended to restrain the lawless. In one\r\ninstance the officer in immediate command of the troops went further\r\nthan I deemed justifiable in supporting the _de facto_ municipal\r\ngovernment of Guthrie, and he was so informed, and directed to limit the\r\ninterference of the military to the support of the marshals on the lines\r\nindicated in the original order. I very urgently recommend that Congress\r\nat once provide a Territorial government for these people. Serious\r\nquestions, which may at any time lead to violent outbreaks, are awaiting\r\nthe institution of courts for their peaceful adjustment. The American\r\ngenius for self-government has been well illustrated in Oklahoma; but it\r\nis neither safe nor wise to leave these people longer to the expedients\r\nwhich have temporarily served them.\r\n\r\nProvision should be made for the acquisition of title to town lots in\r\nthe towns now established in Alaska, for locating town sites, and for\r\nthe establishment of municipal governments. Only the mining laws have\r\nbeen extended to that Territory, and no other form of title to lands can\r\nnow be obtained. The general land laws were framed with reference to the\r\ndisposition of agricultural lands, and it is doubtful if their operation\r\nin Alaska would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nWe have fortunately not extended to Alaska the mistaken policy of\r\nestablishing reservations for the Indian tribes, and can deal with them\r\nfrom the beginning as individuals with, I am sure, better results; but\r\nany disposition of the public lands and any regulations relating to\r\ntimber and to the fisheries should have a kindly regard to their\r\ninterests. Having no power to levy taxes, the people of Alaska are\r\nwholly dependent upon the General Government, to whose revenues the\r\nseal fisheries make a large annual contribution. An appropriation for\r\neducation should neither be overlooked nor stinted.\r\n\r\nThe smallness of the population and the great distances between the\r\nsettlements offer serious obstacles to the establishment of the usual\r\nTerritorial form of government. Perhaps the organization of several\r\nsub-districts with a small municipal council of limited powers for each\r\nwould be safe and useful.\r\n\r\nAttention is called in this connection to the suggestions of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury relating to the establishment of another port\r\nof entry in Alaska and of other needed customs facilities and\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of the land laws the policy of facilitating in\r\nevery proper way the adjustment of the honest claims of individual\r\nsettlers upon the public lands has been pursued. The number of pending\r\ncases had during the preceding Administration been greatly increased\r\nunder the operation of orders for a time suspending final action in a\r\nlarge part of the cases originating in the West and Northwest, and by\r\nthe subsequent use of unusual methods of examination. Only those who are\r\nfamiliar with the conditions under which our agricultural lands have\r\nbeen settled can appreciate the serious and often fatal consequences to\r\nthe settler of a policy that puts his title under suspicion or delays\r\nthe issuance of his patent. While care is taken to prevent and to expose\r\nfraud, it should not be imputed without reason.\r\n\r\nThe manifest purpose of the homestead and preemption laws was to promote\r\nthe settlement of the public domain by persons having a _bona fide_\r\nintent to make a home upon the selected lands. Where this intent is well\r\nestablished and the requirements of the law have been substantially\r\ncomplied with, the claimant is entitled to a prompt and friendly\r\nconsideration of his case; but where there is reason to believe that\r\nthe claimant is the mere agent of another who is seeking to evade a law\r\nintended to promote small holdings and to secure by fraudulent methods\r\nlarge tracts of timber and other lands, both principal and agent should\r\nnot only be thwarted in their fraudulent purpose, but should be made to\r\nfeel the full penalties of our criminal statutes. The laws should be so\r\nadministered as not to confound these two classes and to visit penalties\r\nonly upon the latter.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled state of the titles to large bodies of lands in the\r\nTerritories of New Mexico and Arizona has greatly retarded the\r\ndevelopment of those Territories. Provision should be made by law for\r\nthe prompt trial and final adjustment before a judicial tribunal or\r\ncommission of all claims based upon Mexican grants. It is not just to an\r\nintelligent and enterprising people that their peace should be disturbed\r\nand their prosperity retarded by these old contentions. I express the\r\nhope that differences of opinion as to methods may yield to the urgency\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\nThe law now provides a pension for every soldier and sailor who was\r\nmustered into the service of the United States during the Civil War and\r\nis now suffering from wounds or disease having an origin in the service\r\nand in the line of duty. Two of the three necessary facts, viz, muster\r\nand disability, are usually susceptible of easy proof; but the third,\r\norigin in the service, is often difficult and in many deserving cases\r\nimpossible to establish. That very many of those who endured the\r\nhardships of our most bloody and arduous campaigns are now disabled from\r\ndiseases that had a real but not traceable origin in the service I do\r\nnot doubt. Besides these there is another class composed of men many of\r\nwhom served an enlistment of three full years and of reenlisted veterans\r\nwho added a fourth year of service, who escaped the casualties of battle\r\nand the assaults of disease, who were always ready for any detail, who\r\nwere in every battle line of their command, and were mustered out in\r\nsound health, and have since the close of the war, while fighting with\r\nthe same indomitable and independent spirit the contests of civil life,\r\nbeen overcome by disease or casualty.\r\n\r\nI am not unaware that the pension roll already involves a very large\r\nannual expenditure; neither am I deterred by that fact from recommending\r\nthat Congress grant a pension to such honorably discharged soldiers and\r\nsailors of the Civil War as, having rendered substantial service during\r\nthe war, are now dependent upon their own labor for a maintenance and by\r\ndisease or casualty are incapacitated from earning it. Many of the men\r\nwho would be included in this form of relief are now dependent upon\r\npublic aid, and it does not, in my judgment, consist with the national\r\nhonor that they shall continue to subsist upon the local relief given\r\nindiscriminately to paupers instead of upon the special and generous\r\nprovision of the nation they served so gallantly and unselfishly. Our\r\npeople will, I am sure, very generally approve such legislation. And I\r\nam equally sure that the survivors of the Union Army and Navy will feel\r\na grateful sense of relief when this worthy and suffering class of their\r\ncomrades is fairly cared for.\r\n\r\nThere are some manifest inequalities in the existing law that should be\r\nremedied. To some of these the Secretary of the Interior has called\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to state that by the adoption of new and\r\nbetter methods in the War Department the calls of the Pension Office for\r\ninformation as to the military and hospital records of pension claimants\r\nare now promptly answered and the injurious and vexatious delays that\r\nhave heretofore occurred are entirely avoided. This will greatly\r\nfacilitate the adjustment of all pending claims.\r\n\r\nThe advent of four new States--South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, and\r\nWashington--into the Union under the Constitution in the same month,\r\nand the admission of their duly chosen representatives to our National\r\nCongress at the same session, is an event as unexampled as it is\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe certification of the votes cast and of the constitutions adopted in\r\neach of the States was filed with me, as required by the eighth section\r\nof the act of February 22, 1889, by the governors of said Territories,\r\nrespectively. Having after a careful examination found that the several\r\nconstitutions and governments were republican in form and not repugnant\r\nto the Constitution of the United States, that all the provisions of the\r\nact of Congress had been complied with, and that a majority of the votes\r\ncast in each of said proposed States was in favor of the adoption of\r\nthe constitution submitted therein, I did so declare by a separate\r\nproclamation as to each--as to North Dakota and South Dakota on\r\nSaturday, November 2;[4] as to Montana on Friday, November 8,[5] and as\r\nto Washington on Monday, November 11.[6]\r\n\r\nEach of these States has within it resources the development of which\r\nwill employ the energies of and yield a comfortable subsistence to a\r\ngreat population. The smallest of these new States, Washington, stands\r\ntwelfth, and the largest, Montana, third, among the forty-two in area.\r\nThe people of these States are already well-trained, intelligent, and\r\npatriotic American citizens, having common interests and sympathies with\r\nthose of the older States and a common purpose to defend the integrity\r\nand uphold the honor of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Interstate Commerce Commission has been called to\r\nthe urgent need of Congressional legislation for the better protection\r\nof the lives and limbs of those engaged in operating the great\r\ninterstate freight lines of the country, and especially of the yardmen\r\nand brakemen. A petition signed by nearly 10,000 railway brakemen was\r\npresented to the Commission asking that steps might be taken to bring\r\nabout the use of automatic brakes and couplers on freight cars.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of State railroad commissioners and their accredited\r\nrepresentatives held at Washington in March last upon the invitation of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission a resolution was unanimously adopted\r\nurging the Commission \"to consider what can be done to prevent the loss\r\nof life and limb in coupling and uncoupling freight cars and in handling\r\nthe brakes of such cars.\" During the year ending June 30, 1888, over\r\n2,000 railroad employees were killed in service and more than 20,000\r\ninjured. It is competent, I think, for Congress to require uniformity\r\nin the construction of cars used in interstate commerce and the use of\r\nimproved safety appliances upon such trains. Time will be necessary to\r\nmake the needed changes, but an earnest and intelligent beginning should\r\nbe made at once. It is a reproach to our civilization that any class\r\nof American workmen should in the pursuit of a necessary and useful\r\nvocation be subjected to a peril of life and limb as great as that of\r\na soldier in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe creation of an Executive Department to be known as the Department of\r\nAgriculture by the act of February 9 last was a wise and timely response\r\nto a request which had long been respectfully urged by the farmers of\r\nthe country; but much remains to be done to perfect the organization of\r\nthe Department so that it may fairly realize the expectations which\r\nits creation excited. In this connection attention is called to the\r\nsuggestions contained in the report of the Secretary, which is herewith\r\nsubmitted. The need of a law officer for the Department such as is\r\nprovided for the other Executive Departments is manifest. The failure of\r\nthe last Congress to make the usual provision for the publication of the\r\nannual report should be promptly remedied. The public interest in the\r\nreport and its value to the farming community, I am sure, will not be\r\ndiminished under the new organization of the Department.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the weather service be separated from the War\r\nDepartment and established as a bureau in the Department of Agriculture.\r\nThis will involve an entire reorganization both of the Weather Bureau\r\nand of the Signal Corps, making of the first a purely civil organization\r\nand of the other a purely military staff corps. The report of the Chief\r\nSignal Officer shows that the work of the corps on its military side has\r\nbeen deteriorating.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the people of the District of Columbia should not be\r\nlost sight of in the pressure for consideration of measures affecting\r\nthe whole country. Having no legislature of its own, either municipal\r\nor general, its people must look to Congress for the regulation of all\r\nthose concerns that in the States are the subject of local control. Our\r\nwhole people have an interest that the national capital should be made\r\nattractive and beautiful, and, above all, that its repute for social\r\norder should be well maintained. The laws regulating the sale of\r\nintoxicating drinks in the District should be revised with a view to\r\nbringing the traffic under stringent limitations and control.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the power conferred upon me by the act making\r\nappropriations for the expenses of the District of Columbia for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1890, I did on the 17th day of August last appoint\r\nRudolph Hering, of New York, Samuel M. Gray, of Rhode Island, and\r\nFrederick P. Stearns, of Massachusetts, three eminent sanitary\r\nengineers, to examine and report upon the system of sewerage existing in\r\nthe District of Columbia. Their report, which is not yet completed, will\r\nbe in due course submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners of the District is herewith transmitted,\r\nand the attention of Congress is called to the suggestions contained\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to observe the four hundredth anniversary of the\r\ndiscovery of America by the opening of a world's fair or exposition in\r\nsome one of our great cities will be presented for the consideration of\r\nCongress. The value and interest of such an exposition may well claim\r\nthe promotion of the General Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March last the Civil Service Commission had but a single\r\nmember. The vacancies were filled on the 9th day of May, and since then\r\nthe Commissioners have been industriously, though with an inadequate\r\nforce, engaged in executing the law. They were assured by me that a\r\ncordial support would be given them in the faithful and impartial\r\nenforcement of the statute and of the rules and regulations adopted\r\nin aid of it.\r\n\r\nHeretofore the book of eligibles has been closed to everyone, except\r\nas certifications were made upon the requisition of the appointing\r\nofficers. This secrecy was the source of much suspicion and of many\r\ncharges of favoritism in the administration of the law. What is secret\r\nis always suspected; what is open can be judged. The Commission, with\r\nthe full approval of all its members, has now opened the list of\r\neligibles to the public. The eligible lists for the classified\r\npost-offices and custom-houses are now publicly posted in the respective\r\noffices, as are also the certifications for appointments. The purpose of\r\nthe civil-service law was absolutely to exclude any other consideration\r\nin connection with appointments under it than that of merit as tested by\r\nthe examinations. The business proceeds upon the theory that both the\r\nexamining boards and the appointing officers are absolutely ignorant\r\nas to the political views and associations of all persons on the\r\ncivil-service lists. It is not too much to say, however, that some\r\nrecent Congressional investigations have somewhat shaken public\r\nconfidence in the impartiality of the selections for appointment.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the civil service will make no safe or satisfactory\r\nadvance until the present law and its equal administration are well\r\nestablished in the confidence of the people. It will be my pleasure,\r\nas it is my duty, to see that the law is executed with firmness and\r\nimpartiality. If some of its provisions have been fraudulently evaded\r\nby appointing officers, our resentment should not suggest the repeal of\r\nthe law, but reform in its administration. We should have one view of\r\nthe matter, and hold it with a sincerity that is not affected by the\r\nconsideration that the party to which we belong is for the time in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor, on the 4th day of January, 1889, by an Executive order\r\nto take effect March 15, brought the Railway Mail Service under the\r\noperation of the civil-service law.[7] Provision was made that the order\r\nshould take effect sooner in any State where an eligible list was sooner\r\nobtained. On the 11th day of March Mr. Lyman, then the only member of\r\nthe Commission, reported to me in writing that it would not be possible\r\nto have the list of eligibles ready before May 1, and requested that the\r\ntaking effect of the order be postponed until that time, which was\r\ndone,[8] subject to the same provision contained in the original order\r\nas to States in which an eligible list was sooner obtained.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the revision of the rules, of the new classification, and\r\nof the inclusion of the Railway Mail Service, the work of the Commission\r\nhas been greatly increased, and the present clerical force is found to\r\nbe inadequate. I recommend that the additional clerks asked by the\r\nCommission be appropriated for.\r\n\r\nThe duty of appointment is devolved by the Constitution or by the law,\r\nand the appointing officers are properly held to a high responsibility\r\nin its exercise. The growth of the country and the consequent increase\r\nof the civil list have magnified this function of the Executive\r\ndisproportionally. It can not be denied, however, that the labor\r\nconnected with this necessary work is increased, often to the point of\r\nactual distress, by the sudden and excessive demands that are made upon\r\nan incoming Administration for removals and appointments. But, on the\r\nother hand, it is not true that incumbency is a conclusive argument for\r\ncontinuance in office. Impartiality, moderation, fidelity to public\r\nduty, and a good attainment in the discharge of it must be added before\r\nthe argument is complete. When those holding administrative offices so\r\nconduct themselves as to convince just political opponents that no party\r\nconsideration or bias affects in any way the discharge of their public\r\nduties, we can more easily stay the demand for removals.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that both in and out of the classified service great\r\nbenefit would accrue from the adoption of some system by which the\r\nofficer would receive the distinction and benefit that in all private\r\nemployments comes from exceptional faithfulness and efficiency in the\r\nperformance of duty.\r\n\r\nI have suggested to the heads of the Executive Departments that they\r\nconsider whether a record might not be kept in each bureau of all those\r\nelements that are covered by the terms \"faithfulness\" and \"efficiency,\"\r\nand a rating made showing the relative merits of the clerks of each\r\nclass, this rating to be regarded as a test of merit in making\r\npromotions.\r\n\r\nI have also suggested to the Postmaster-General that he adopt some plan\r\nby which he can, upon the basis of the reports to the Department and of\r\nfrequent inspections, indicate the relative merit of postmasters of each\r\nclass. They will be appropriately indicated in the Official Register and\r\nin the report of the Department. That a great stimulus would thus be\r\ngiven to the whole service I do not doubt, and such a record would be\r\nthe best defense against inconsiderate removals from office.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the General Government in the education of the\r\npeople found an early expression, not only in the thoughtful and\r\nsometimes warning utterances of our ablest statesmen, but in liberal\r\nappropriations from the common resources for the support of education\r\nin the new States. No one will deny that it is of the gravest national\r\nconcern that those who hold the ultimate control of all public affairs\r\nshould have the necessary intelligence wisely to direct and determine\r\nthem. National aid to education has heretofore taken the form of land\r\ngrants, and in that form the constitutional power of Congress to promote\r\nthe education of the people is not seriously questioned. I do not think\r\nit can be successfully questioned when the form is changed to that of a\r\ndirect grant of money from the public Treasury.\r\n\r\nSuch aid should be, as it always has been, suggested by some exceptional\r\nconditions. The sudden emancipation of the slaves of the South, the\r\nbestowal of the suffrage which soon followed, and the impairment of the\r\nability of the States where these new citizens were chiefly found to\r\nadequately provide educational facilities presented not only exceptional\r\nbut unexampled conditions. That the situation has been much ameliorated\r\nthere is no doubt. The ability and interest of the States have happily\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nBut a great work remains to be done, and I think the General\r\nGovernment should lend its aid. As the suggestion of a national grant\r\nin aid of education grows chiefly out of the condition and needs of\r\nthe emancipated slave and his descendants, the relief should as far\r\nas possible, while necessarily proceeding upon some general lines, be\r\napplied to the need that suggested it. It is essential, if much good is\r\nto be accomplished, that the sympathy and active interest of the people\r\nof the States should be enlisted, and that the methods adopted should\r\nbe such as to stimulate and not to supplant local taxation for school\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAs one Congress can not bind a succeeding one in such a case and as\r\nthe effort must in some degree be experimental, I recommend that any\r\nappropriation made for this purpose be so limited in annual amount and\r\nas to the time over which it is to extend as will on the one hand give\r\nthe local school authorities opportunity to make the best use of the\r\nfirst year's allowance, and on the other deliver them from the\r\ntemptation to unduly postpone the assumption of the whole burden\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe colored people did not intrude themselves upon us. They were brought\r\nhere in chains and held in the communities where they are now chiefly\r\nfound by a cruel slave code. Happily for both races, they are now free.\r\nThey have from a standpoint of ignorance and poverty--which was our\r\nshame, not theirs--made remarkable advances in education and in the\r\nacquisition of property. They have as a people shown themselves to\r\nbe friendly and faithful toward the white race under temptations of\r\ntremendous strength. They have their representatives in the national\r\ncemeteries, where a grateful Government has gathered the ashes of\r\nthose who died in its defense. They have furnished to our Regular Army\r\nregiments that have won high praise from their commanding officers for\r\ncourage and soldierly qualities and for fidelity to the enlistment oath.\r\nIn civil life they are now the toilers of their communities, making\r\ntheir full contribution to the widening streams of prosperity which\r\nthese communities are receiving. Their sudden withdrawal would stop\r\nproduction and bring disorder into the household as well as the shop.\r\nGenerally they do not desire to quit their homes, and their employers\r\nresent the interference of the emigration agents who seek to stimulate\r\nsuch a desire.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all this, in many parts of our country where the\r\ncolored population is large the people of that race are by various\r\ndevices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and\r\nof many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon\r\nthose whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is\r\nwronged.\r\n\r\nIt has been the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and of\r\nrespect for the law would work a gradual cure of these flagrant evils.\r\nSurely no one supposes that the present can be accepted as a permanent\r\ncondition. If it is said that these communities must work out this\r\nproblem for themselves, we have a right to ask whether they are at work\r\nupon it. Do they suggest any solution? When and under what conditions is\r\nthe black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those\r\nfull civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that\r\nequality of influence which our form of government was intended to\r\nsecure to the electors to be restored? This generation should\r\ncourageously face these grave questions, and not leave them as a\r\nheritage of woe to the next. The consultation should proceed with\r\ncandor, calmness, and great patience, upon the lines of justice and\r\nhumanity, not of prejudice and cruelty. No question in our country can\r\nbe at rest except upon the firm base of justice and of the law.\r\n\r\nI earnestly invoke the attention of Congress to the consideration of\r\nsuch measures within its well-defined constitutional powers as will\r\nsecure to all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and\r\nevery other civil right under the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates. No evil, however deplorable, can justify the assumption either\r\non the part of the Executive or of Congress of powers not granted, but\r\nboth will be highly blamable if all the powers granted are not wisely\r\nbut firmly used to correct these evils. The power to take the whole\r\ndirection and control of the election of members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives is clearly given to the General Government. A partial\r\nand qualified supervision of these elections is now provided for by law,\r\nand in my opinion this law may be so strengthened and extended as to\r\nsecure on the whole better results than can be attained by a law taking\r\nall the processes of such election into Federal control. The colored man\r\nshould be protected in all of his relations to the Federal Government,\r\nwhether as litigant, juror, or witness in our courts, as an elector for\r\nmembers of Congress, or as a peaceful traveler upon our interstate\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more justly humiliating to the national pride and\r\nnothing more hurtful to the national prosperity than the inferiority of\r\nour merchant marine compared with that of other nations whose general\r\nresources, wealth, and seacoast lines do not suggest any reason for\r\ntheir supremacy on the sea. It was not always so, and our people are\r\nagreed, I think, that it shall not continue to be so. It is not possible\r\nin this communication to discuss the causes of the decay of our shipping\r\ninterests or the differing methods by which it is proposed to restore\r\nthem. The statement of a few well-authenticated facts and some general\r\nsuggestions as to legislation is all that is practicable. That the great\r\nsteamship lines sailing under the flags of England, France, Germany,\r\nSpain, and Italy, and engaged in foreign commerce, were promoted and\r\nhave since been and now are liberally aided by grants of public money\r\nin one form or another is generally known. That the American lines of\r\nsteamships have been abandoned by us to an unequal contest with the\r\naided lines of other nations until they have been withdrawn, or in\r\nthe few cases where they are still maintained are subject to serious\r\ndisadvantages, is matter of common knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe present situation is such that travelers and merchandise find\r\nLiverpool often a necessary intermediate port between New York and some\r\nof the South American capitals. The fact that some of the delegates from\r\nSouth American States to the conference of American nations now in\r\nsession at Washington reached our shores by reversing that line of\r\ntravel is very conclusive of the need of such a conference and very\r\nsuggestive as to the first and most necessary step in the direction of\r\nfuller and more beneficial intercourse with nations that are now our\r\nneighbors upon the lines of latitude, but not upon the lines of\r\nestablished commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nI recommend that such appropriations be made for ocean mail service in\r\nAmerican steamships between our ports and those of Central and South\r\nAmerica, China, Japan, and the important islands in both of the great\r\noceans as will be liberally remunerative for the service rendered and\r\nas will encourage the establishment and in some fair degree equalize\r\nthe chances of American steamship lines in the competitions which they\r\nmust meet. That the American States lying south of us will cordially\r\ncooperate in establishing and maintaining such lines of steamships to\r\ntheir principal ports I do not doubt.\r\n\r\nWe should also make provision for a naval reserve to consist of such\r\nmerchant ships of American construction and of a specified tonnage and\r\nspeed as the owners will consent to place at the use of the Government\r\nin case of need as armed cruisers. England has adopted this policy, and\r\nas a result can now upon necessity at once place upon her naval list\r\nsome of the fastest steamships in the world. A proper supervision of the\r\nconstruction of such vessels would make their conversion into effective\r\nships of war very easy.\r\n\r\nI am an advocate of economy in our national expenditures, but it is\r\na misuse of terms to make this word describe a policy that withholds\r\nan expenditure for the purpose of extending our foreign commerce. The\r\nenlargement and improvement of our merchant marine, the development of\r\na sufficient body of trained American seamen, the promotion of rapid and\r\nregular mail communication between the ports of other countries and our\r\nown, and the adaptation of large and swift American merchant steamships\r\nto naval uses in time of war are public purposes of the highest concern.\r\nThe enlarged participation of our people in the carrying trade, the new\r\nand increased markets that will be opened for the products of our farms\r\nand factories, and the fuller and better employment of our mechanics\r\nwhich will result from a liberal promotion of our foreign commerce\r\ninsure the widest possible diffusion of benefit to all the States\r\nand to all our people. Everything is most propitious for the present\r\ninauguration of a liberal and progressive policy upon this subject,\r\nand we should enter upon it with promptness and decision.\r\n\r\nThe legislation which I have suggested, it is sincerely believed,\r\nwill promote the peace and honor of our country and the prosperity and\r\nsecurity of the people. I invoke the diligent and serious attention of\r\nCongress to the consideration of these and such other measures as may\r\nbe presented having the same great end in view.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 10, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the power vested in me by the terms of the last clause\r\nof section 3 of the act of Congress approved March 2, 1889, entitled\r\n\"An act making appropriations for the current and contingent expenses\r\nof the Indian Department and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with\r\nvarious Indian tribes for the year ending June 30, 1890, and for other\r\npurposes,\" a commission, as therein authorized, was appointed,\r\nconsisting of Charles Foster, of Ohio, William Warner, of Missouri, and\r\nGeneral George Crook, of the United States Army. This commission was\r\nspecially instructed to present to the Sioux Indians occupying the Great\r\nSioux Reservation, for their acceptance thereof and consent thereto in\r\nmanner and form as therein provided, the act of Congress approved March\r\n2, 1889, entitled \"An act to divide a portion of the reservation of the\r\nSioux Nation of Indians in Dakota into separate reservations and to\r\nsecure the relinquishment of the Indian title to the remainder, and for\r\nother purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the commission was submitted to me on the 24th day of\r\nDecember, 1889, and is, with the accompanying documents and a letter of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, herewith transmitted for the information\r\nof Congress. It appears from the report of the commission that the\r\nconsent of more than three-fourths of the adult Indians to the terms of\r\nthe act last named was secured, as required by section 12 of the treaty\r\nof 1868, and upon a careful examination of the papers submitted I find\r\nsuch to be the fact, and that such consent is properly evidenced by the\r\nsignatures of more than three-fourths of such Indians.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the negotiations the commission was confronted by\r\ncertain questions as to the interpretation and effect of the act of\r\nCongress which they were presenting for the acceptance of the Indians.\r\nUpon two or three points of some importance the commission gave in\r\nresponse to these inquiries an interpretation to the law, and it was\r\nthe law thus explained to them that was accepted by the Indians. The\r\ncommissioners had no power to bind Congress or the Executive by their\r\nconstruction of a statute, but they were the agents of the United\r\nStates, first, to submit a definite proposition for the acceptance\r\nof the Indians, and, that failing, to agree upon modified terms to\r\nbe submitted to Congress for ratification. They were dealing with an\r\nignorant and suspicious people, and an explanation of the terms and\r\neffect of the offer submitted could not be avoided. Good faith demands\r\nthat if the United States accepts the lands ceded the beneficial\r\nconstruction of the act given by our agents should be also admitted\r\nand observed.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty in the construction of the act grows out of its\r\nrelation to prior treaties, which were by section 19 continued in\r\nforce so far as they are not in conflict with the terms of the act.\r\nThe seventh article of the treaty of 1868, relating to schools and\r\nschoolhouses, is by section 17 of the act continued in force for twenty\r\nyears, \"subject to such modifications as Congress shall deem most\r\neffective to secure to said Indians equivalent benefits of such\r\neducation.\"\r\n\r\nSection 7 of the treaty of 1868 provides only for instruction in the\r\n\"elementary branches of an English education,\" while section 17 of the\r\nact, after continuing this section of the treaty in force, provides a\r\nfund which is to be applied \"for the promotion of industrial and other\r\nsuitable education among said Indians.\" Again, section 7 of the treaty\r\nprovides for the erection of a schoolhouse for every thirty children who\r\ncan be induced to attend, while section 20 of the act requires the\r\nerection of not less than thirty schoolhouses, and more if found\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners were asked by the Indians whether the cost of the\r\nEnglish schools provided for in section 7 of the treaty and of the\r\nschoolhouses provided for in the same section and in section 20 of the\r\nact would be a charge against the proceeds of the lands they were now\r\nasked to cede to the United States. This question was answered in the\r\nnegative, and I think the answer was correct. If the act, without\r\nreference to section 7 of the treaty, is to be construed to express\r\nthe whole duty of the Government toward the Indians in the matter of\r\nschools, the extension for twenty years of the provisions of that\r\nsection is without meaning.\r\n\r\nThe assurance given by the commissioners that the money appropriated by\r\nsection 27 of the act to pay certain bands for the ponies taken by the\r\nmilitary authorities in 1876 would not be a charge against the proceeds\r\nof the ceded lands was obviously a correct interpretation of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were further assured by the commissioners that the amount\r\nappropriated for the expenses of the commission could not under the law\r\nbe made a charge upon the proceeds of their lands. This, I think, is a\r\ncorrect exposition of the act.\r\n\r\nIt seems from the report of the commission that some of the Indians at\r\nthe Standing Rock Agency asked whether if they accepted the act they\r\ncould have the election to take their allotments under section 6 of the\r\ntreaty of 1868 and have the benefits of sections 8 and 10 of that\r\ntreaty, and were told that they could.\r\n\r\nAs the treaty is continued in force except where it contravenes the\r\nprovisions of the act, I do not see any difficulty in admitting this\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that the commission has submitted many recommendations,\r\nsome of them involving legislation and others appealing to powers\r\nalready possessed by the executive department. The consent of the\r\nIndians to the act was not made dependent upon the adoption of any of\r\nthese recommendations, but many of them are obviously just and promotive\r\nof the true interests of the Indians. So far as these require\r\nlegislation they are earnestly commended to the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has prepared and submits with his letter\r\ntransmitting the report of the commission the draft of a bill embodying\r\nthose recommendations of the commission requiring legislation.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations necessary to carry into effect the provisions of the\r\nact should be promptly made and be immediately available.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 12, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, respecting the\r\nInternational Marine Conference which was held in the city of Washington\r\nin the year 1889, together with a copy of the proceedings of the\r\nconference, including the final act.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 17, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of the 11th instant from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, submitting a copy of a report from the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs and accompanying draft of a bill to amend\r\nthe first section of an act entitled \"An act to provide for the\r\nallotment of lands in severalty to Indians on the various reservations,\r\nand to extend the protection of the laws of the United States and the\r\nTerritories over the Indians, and for other purposes,\" approved February\r\n8, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe matter is presented for the consideration and action of Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 18, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of the 8th instant from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, submitting a report of the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs and accompanying agreement, made with the Sisseton and\r\nWahpeton bands of Dakota or Sioux Indians, for the purchase and release\r\nof the surplus lands in the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation, in the\r\nStates of North and South Dakota, the negotiations for said purchase and\r\nrelease having been conducted under the authority contained in the fifth\r\nsection of the general allotment act of February 8, 1887 (24 U.S.\r\nStatutes at Large, p. 388), which provides, among other things, that the\r\n\"purchase shall not be complete until ratified by Congress, and the form\r\nand manner of executing such release shall also be prescribed by\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nThis agreement involves a departure from the terms of the general\r\nallotment act in at least one important particular. It gives to each\r\nmember of the tribe 160 acres of land without regard to age or sex,\r\nwhile the general law gives this allotment only to heads of families.\r\nThere are, I think, serious objections to the basis adopted in the\r\ngeneral law, especially in its application to married women; but if the\r\nbasis of the agreement herewith submitted is accepted, it would, I\r\nthink, result in some cases, where there are large families of minor\r\nchildren, in excessive allotments to a single family. Whatever is done\r\nin this case will of course become in some sense a precedent in the\r\ncases yet to be dealt with.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the question of the payment by the United States of the\r\nannuities which were forfeited by the act of February 16, 1863\r\n(12 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 652), should not have been considered in\r\nconnection with this negotiation for the cession of these lands. But it\r\nappears that a refusal to consider this claim would have terminated the\r\nnegotiation, and if the claim is just its allowance has already been\r\ntoo long delayed. The forfeiture declared by the act of 1863 unjustly\r\nincluded the annuities of certain Indians of these bands who were not\r\nonly guilty of no fault, but who rendered meritorious services in the\r\narmies of the United States in the suppression of the Sioux outbreak\r\nand in the War of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe agreement submitted, as I understand, provides for the payment of\r\nthe annuities justly due to these friendly Indians to all the members\r\nof the two bands per capita. This is said to be the unanimous wish of\r\nthe Indians, and a distribution to the friendly Indians and their\r\ndescendants only would now be very difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe agreement is respectfully submitted for the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 24, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of 18th instant from the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, submitting copy of a report from the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs, inclosing, with accompanying papers, a draft of a bill\r\nauthorizing the removal of the Indians of the Papago or Gila Bend\r\nReservation, in Maricopa County, Arizona Territory, to the Papago Indian\r\nReservation, in Pima County, in said Territory, or to the Pima and\r\nMaricopa Indian reservations, commonly known as the Gila River and Salt\r\nRiver Indian reservations, respectively, in said Territory, and for\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\nThe matter is presented for the early consideration and action of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 24, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of the 18th instant from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, submitting a copy of a report of the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs and accompanying item for insertion in\r\nthe bill making appropriations for the current and contingent expenses\r\nof the Indian Department, which makes provision for further compensation\r\nof Henry B. Carrington, special agent appointed under the act of March\r\n2, 1889, \"to provide for the sale of lands patented to certain members\r\nof the Flathead band of Indians in Montana Territory, and for other\r\npurposes,\" to secure the consent of the Indians thereto and appraise\r\nthe lands and improvements thereof; for an appropriation to remove the\r\nIndians whose lands have been sold to the Jocko Reservation, and for\r\nadditional legislation considered necessary to complete this matter,\r\nas suggested by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\nI also transmit a copy of the report of Special Agent Carrington and its\r\ninclosures.\r\n\r\nThe matter is presented for the early consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 4, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the authority and direction contained in the act of\r\nCongress approved January 14, 1889, entitled \"An act for the relief and\r\ncivilization of the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota,\" three\r\ncommissioners were appointed by the President on February 26, 1889, as\r\ntherein authorized and directed, namely, Henry M. Rice, of Minnesota,\r\nMartin Marty, of Dakota, and Joseph B. Whiting, of Wisconsin, to\r\nnegotiate with said Indians.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners have submitted their final report, with accompanying\r\npapers, showing the results of the negotiations conducted by them, and\r\nthe same has been carefully reviewed by the Secretary of the Interior in\r\nhis report to me thereon.\r\n\r\nBeing satisfied from an examination of the papers submitted that the\r\ncession and relinquishment by said Chippewa Indians of their title and\r\ninterest in the lands specified and described in the agreement with the\r\ndifferent bands or tribes of Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota\r\nwas obtained in the manner prescribed in the first section of said act,\r\nand that more than the requisite number have signed said agreement, I\r\nhave, as provided by said act, approved the said instruments in writing\r\nconstituting the agreement entered into by the commissioners with said\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners did not escape the embarrassment which unfortunately\r\ntoo often attends our negotiations with the Indians, namely, an\r\nindisposition to treat with the Government for further concessions while\r\nits obligations incurred under former agreements are unkept. I am sure\r\nit will be the disposition of Congress to consider promptly and in a\r\njust and friendly spirit the claims presented by these Indians through\r\nour commissioners, which have been formulated in the draft of a bill\r\nprepared by the Secretary of the Interior and submitted herewith.\r\n\r\nThe act of January 14, 1889 (25 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 642),\r\nevidently contemplated the voluntary removal of the body of all these\r\nbands of Indians to the White Earth and Red Lake reservations; but a\r\nproviso in section 3 of the act authorized any Indian to take his\r\nallotment upon the reservation where he now resides. The commissioners\r\nreport that quite a general desire was expressed by the Indians to avail\r\nthemselves of this option. The result of this is that the ceded land can\r\nnot be ascertained and brought to sale under the act until all of the\r\nallotments are made.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the necessary appropriations to complete the surveys\r\nand allotments be made at once available, so that the work may be begun\r\nand completed at the earliest possible day.\r\n\r\nA copy of the report made by the commissioners, with copies of all the\r\npapers submitted therewith, except the census rolls, is herewith\r\npresented for the information of the Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

Dak.\r\n\r\nThe desire of these Indians to be united upon some common reservation\r\nwith their brethren now occupying the Tongue River Reserve, in Montana,\r\nis quite natural, and such an arrangement would, I think, promote the\r\nbest interests of both of these bands.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

A copy of the tracing, with notes, is\r\ninclosed, showing an approximate survey and describing the situation\r\nof the lot.\r\n\r\nI also inclose a copy of a report of the Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office to the Secretary of the Interior, setting forth that under\r\nthe decision of Mr. Muldrow the tract of land known as the \"Cuartel\"\r\nlot belongs to the United States by conquest and by treaty, and is in a\r\nstate of reservation for national purposes, and respectfully submitting\r\nthat Congress may continue its status as fixed by said decision or enact\r\nappropriate laws providing for its disposition as public land.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 19, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the International American Conference,\r\nrecently in session at this capital, recommending the survey of a route\r\nfor an intercontinental line of railroad to connect the systems of North\r\nAmerica with those of the southern continent, and to be conducted under\r\nthe direction of a board of commissioners representing the several\r\nAmerican Republics.\r\n\r\nPublic attention has chiefly been attracted to the subject of improved\r\nwater communication between the ports of the United States and those of\r\nCentral and South America. The creation of new and improved steamship\r\nlines undoubtedly furnishes the readiest means of developing an\r\nincreased trade with the Latin-American nations. But it should not be\r\nforgotten that it is possible to travel by land from Washington to the\r\nsouthernmost capital of South America, and that the opening of railroad\r\ncommunication with these friendly States will give to them and to us\r\nfacilities for intercourse and the exchanges of trade that are of\r\nspecial value.\r\n\r\nThe work contemplated is vast, but entirely practicable. It will be\r\ninteresting to all, and perhaps surprising to most of us, to notice how\r\nmuch has already been done in the way of railroad construction in Mexico\r\nand South America that can be utilized as part of an intercontinental\r\nline.\r\n\r\nI do not hesitate to recommend that Congress make the very moderate\r\nappropriation for surveys suggested by the conference and authorize the\r\nappointment of commissioners and the detail of engineer officers to\r\ndirect and conduct the necessary preliminary surveys.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 21, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of the 20th instant from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior and accompanying correspondence in the matter\r\nof the request of the Seminole Nation of Indians for negotiations with\r\nthe Creek Nation of Indians for the purchase of an additional quantity\r\nof land, being about 25,000 acres, for the use of the Seminoles. The\r\nrequest is based upon the fact that former purchases do not embrace all\r\nof the lands upon which the Seminole Indians have made improvements, and\r\nwhich by the corrected survey were given to the Creeks. The money to be\r\npaid for these lands is to be reimbursed to the Government by the\r\nSeminoles.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

It is not proposed to\r\ninvolve the United States in any financial responsibility, but only to\r\ngive to the proposed bank a corporate franchise, and to promote public\r\nconfidence by requiring that its condition and transactions shall be\r\nsubmitted to a scrutiny similar to that which is now exercised over our\r\ndomestic banking system.\r\n\r\nThe subject is submitted for the consideration of Congress in the belief\r\nthat it will be found possible to promote the end desired by legislation\r\nso guarded as to avoid all just criticism.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of the 26th instant from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, and accompanying item of appropriation, to\r\nenable the President to continue the negotiations authorized by sections\r\n14 and 15 of the Indian appropriation act approved March 2, 1889, with\r\nthe Cherokee Indians and with all other Indians owning or claiming lands\r\nwest of the ninety-sixth degree of longitude in the Indian Territory,\r\nfor the cession to the United States of all their title, claim, or\r\ninterest of every kind or character in and to said lands, etc.\r\n\r\nThe matter is presented for the favorable action of Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 2, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n29th ultimo, the Senate concurring, I return herewith the bill (H.R.\r\n7345) entitled \"An act authorizing and directing the Secretary of War\r\nto establish new harbor lines in Portage Lake, Houghton County, Mich.\"\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 2, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe International American Conference, recently in session at this\r\ncapital, recommended for adoption by the several American Republics--\r\n\r\n1. A uniform system of customs regulations for the classification and\r\nvaluation of imported merchandise;\r\n\r\n2. A uniform nomenclature for the description of articles of merchandise\r\nimported and exported; and\r\n\r\n3. The establishment at Washington of an international bureau of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe conference also at its final session decided to establish\r\nin the city of Washington, as a fitting memorial of its meeting, a\r\nLatin-American library, to be formed by contributions from the several\r\nnations, of historical, geographical, and literary works, maps,\r\nmanuscripts, and official documents relating to the history and\r\ncivilization of America, and expressed a desire that the Government of\r\nthe United States should provide a suitable building for the shelter\r\nof such a library, to be solemnly dedicated upon the four hundredth\r\nanniversary of the discovery of America.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these suggestions is fully set forth in the letter\r\nof the Secretary of State and the accompanying documents, herewith\r\ntransmitted, to which I invite your attention.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 6, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 26th of May,\r\nrequesting me to \"communicate to the Senate such information as may\r\nbe in possession of the executive department relating to the alleged\r\nlanding of an armed force from the United States revenue cutter _McLane_\r\nat Cedar Keys, Fla., and the alleged entry of houses of citizens by\r\nforce, and their alleged pursuit of citizens of the United States in\r\nthe surrounding country, and the authority under which the commanding\r\nofficer of the cutter acted in any such matter,\" I submit for the\r\ninformation of the Senate the accompanying correspondence, which\r\ncontains all the information possessed by the executive department\r\nrelating to the matters inquired about.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the United States collector of customs at\r\nCedar Keys had been driven from his office and from the town and the\r\nadministration of the customs laws of the United States at that port\r\nsuspended by the violent demonstrations and threats of one Cottrell, the\r\nmayor of the place, assisted by his town marshal, Mitchell. If it had\r\nbeen necessary, as I do not think it can be in any case, for a United\r\nStates officer to appeal to the local authorities for immunity from\r\nviolence in the exercise of his duties, the situation at Cedar Keys did\r\nnot suggest or encourage such an appeal, for those to whom the appeal\r\nwould have been addressed were themselves the lawless instruments of\r\nthe threatened violence. It will always be agreeable to me if the local\r\nauthorities, acting upon their own sense of duty, maintain the public\r\norder in such a way that the officers of the United States shall have\r\nno occasion to appeal for the intervention of the General Government;\r\nbut when this is not done I shall deem it my duty to use the adequate\r\npowers vested in the Executive to make it safe and feasible to hold and\r\nexercise the offices established by the Federal Constitution and laws.\r\n\r\nThe means used in this case were, in my opinion, lawful and necessary,\r\nand the officers do not seem to have intruded upon any private right in\r\nexecuting the warrants placed in their hands. The letter dated August 4\r\nlast, which appears in the correspondence submitted, appealing to me\r\nto intervene for the protection of the citizens of Cedar Keys from the\r\nbrutal violence of Cottrell, it will be noticed, was written before the\r\nappointment of the new collector. That the officers of the law should\r\nnot have the full sympathy of every good citizen in their efforts to\r\nbring these men to merited punishment is matter of surprise and regret.\r\nIt is a very grim commentary upon the condition of social order at Cedar\r\nKeys that only a woman, who had, as she says in her letter, no son or\r\nhusband who could be made the victim of his malice, had the courage to\r\nfile charges against this man, who was then holding a subordinate place\r\nin the customs service.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 6, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 5th instant,\r\nthe House of Representatives concurring, I return herewith the bill\r\n(S. 1293) entitled \"An act for the relief of Charles F. Bowers.\"\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 16, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress with a view to\r\nsecuring such legislation as may be appropriate, a communication from\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, relating to the destruction by fires,\r\ncarelessly kindled or left, of the timber upon the public lands.\r\n\r\nIf proper penalties were imposed by law and a few convictions thereunder\r\nsecured, I do not doubt that much waste of our forests would be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 18, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 16th instant,\r\nrelating to the negotiations by the Cherokee Commission for the purchase\r\nof certain lands in the Indian Territory, I respectfully state that on\r\nthe 20th day of May and the 12th day of June, respectively, agreements\r\nwere Signed by the Iowa and the Sac and Fox tribes ceding to the United\r\nStates certain of their lands. The contracts and accompanying papers\r\nwere received at the Interior Department on the 2d and 17th days of\r\nJune, respectively, and are now under examination by the proper officers\r\nof that Department. When these examinations are concluded, the papers\r\nwill, if found to be complete and conformable to law, be submitted to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your information, a letter from the Secretary\r\nof State, inclosing a report of the International American Conference,\r\nwhich recommends that reciprocal commercial treaties be entered into\r\nbetween the United States and the several other Republics of this\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt has been so often and so persistently stated that our tariff laws\r\noffered an insurmountable barrier to a large exchange of products\r\nwith the Latin-American nations that I deem it proper to call especial\r\nattention to the fact that more than 87 per cent of the products of\r\nthose nations sent to our ports are now admitted free. If sugar is\r\nplaced upon the free list, practically every important article exported\r\nfrom those States will be given untaxed access to our markets, except\r\nwool. The real difficulty in the way of negotiating profitable\r\nreciprocity treaties is that we have given freely so much that would\r\nhave had value in the mutual concessions which such treaties imply.\r\nI can not doubt, however, that the present advantages which the products\r\nof these near and friendly States enjoy in our markets, though they are\r\nnot by law exclusive, will, with other considerations, favorably dispose\r\nthem to adopt such measures, by treaty or otherwise, as will tend to\r\nequalize and greatly enlarge our mutual exchanges.\r\n\r\nIt will certainly be time enough for us to consider whether we must\r\ncheapen the cost of production by cheapening labor in order to gain\r\naccess to the South American markets when we have fairly tried the\r\neffect of established and reliable steam communication and of convenient\r\nmethods of money exchanges. There can be no doubt, I think, that with\r\nthese facilities well established and with a rebate of duties upon\r\nimported raw materials used in the manufacture of goods for export our\r\nmerchants will be able to compete in the ports of the Latin-American\r\nnations with those of any other country.\r\n\r\nIf after the Congress shall have acted upon pending tariff legislation\r\nit shall appear that under the general treaty-making power, or under any\r\nspecial powers given by law, our trade with the States represented in\r\nthe conference can be enlarged upon a basis of mutual advantage, it will\r\nbe promptly done.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 24, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 23d instant, the Senate concurring, I return herewith the bill\r\n(H.R. 5702) \"granting a pension to Ann Bryan.\"\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 25, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 23d instant, the\r\nHouse of Representatives concurring, I return herewith the bill (S. 145)\r\n\"for the relief of the legal representatives of Henry S. French.\"\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 1, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my annual message I called attention to the urgent need of\r\nlegislation for the adjustment of the claims under Mexican grants to\r\nlands in Arizona and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nI now submit a correspondence which has passed between the Department\r\nof State and the Mexican Government concerning the rights of certain\r\nMexican citizens to have their claims to lands ceded to the United\r\nStates by the treaty adjusted and confirmed. I also submit a letter from\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, with accompanying papers, showing the\r\nnumber and extent of these claims and their present condition.\r\n\r\nThe United States owes a duty to Mexico to confirm to her citizens those\r\nvalid grants that were saved by the treaty, and the long delay which has\r\nattended the discharge of this duty has given just cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nThe entire community where these large claims exist, and, indeed,\r\nall of our people, are interested in an early and final settlement of\r\nthem. No greater incubus can rest upon the energies of a people in the\r\ndevelopment of a new country than that resulting from unsettled land\r\ntitles.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for legislation is so evident and so urgent that I venture\r\nto express the hope that relief will be given at the present session of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 2, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the provisions of section 14 of the act of March 2,\r\n1889, I transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, an\r\nagreement concluded between the commissioners appointed under that\r\nsection on behalf of the United States, commonly known as the Cherokee\r\nCommission, and the Sac and Fox Nation of Indians in the Indian\r\nTerritory on the 12th day of June last.\r\n\r\nThe Sac and Fox Nation have a national council, and the negotiation was\r\nconducted with that body, which undoubtedly had competent authority to\r\ncontract on behalf of the tribe for the sale of these lands. The letter\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior and the accompanying papers, which are\r\nsubmitted herewith, furnish all the information necessary to the\r\nconsideration of the questions to be determined by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe only serious question presented is as to that article of the\r\nagreement which limits the distribution of the funds to be paid by the\r\nUnited States under it to the Sac and Fox Indians now in the Indian\r\nTerritory. I very gravely doubt whether the remnant or band of this\r\ntribe now living in Iowa has any interest in these lands in the Indian\r\nTerritory. The reservation there was apparently given in consideration\r\nof improvements upon the lands of the tribe in Kansas. The band now\r\nresident in Iowa upon lands purchased by their own means, as I am\r\nadvised, left the Kansas reservation many years before the date of this\r\ntreaty, and it would seem could have had no equitable interest in the\r\nimprovements on the Kansas lands, which must have been the result of the\r\nlabors of that portion of the tribe living upon them. The right of the\r\nIowa band to a participation in the proceeds of the sale of the Kansas\r\nreservation was explicitly reserved in the treaty; but it seems to me\r\nupon a somewhat hasty examination of the treaty that the reservation\r\nin the Indian Territory was intended only for the benefit of those who\r\nshould go there to reside. The Secretary of the Interior has expressed a\r\nsomewhat different view of the effect of this treaty; but if the facts\r\nare, as I understand, that the Iowa band did not contribute to the\r\nimprovements which were the consideration for the reservation and did\r\nnot accept the invitation to settle upon the reservation lands in the\r\nIndian Territory, I do not well see how they have either an equitable or\r\nlegal claim to participate in the proceeds of the sale of those lands.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter is submitted for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 2, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of State, inclosing\r\nthe recommendations of the International American Conference for the\r\nestablishment of improved facilities for postal and cable communication\r\nbetween the United States and the several countries of Central and South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly urge upon Congress the necessity of giving this\r\nsubject immediate and favorable consideration and of making adequate\r\nappropriations to carry the recommendations into effect; and in this\r\nconnection I beg leave to call attention to what was said on the subject\r\nin my annual message.[9] The delegates of the seventeen neighboring\r\nRepublics, which have so recently been assembled in Washington at the\r\ninvitation of this Government, have expressed their wish and purpose to\r\ncooperate with the United States in the adoption of measures to improve\r\nthe means of communication between the several Republics of America.\r\nThey recognize the necessity of frequent, regular, and rapid steamship\r\nservice, both for the purpose of maintaining friendly intercourse\r\nand for the convenience of commerce, and realize that without such\r\nfacilities it is useless to attempt to extend the trade between their\r\nports and ours.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See pp. 56-57.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 2, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your information, a letter from the Secretary\r\nof State, inclosing a copy of a resolution passed by the International\r\nAmerican Conference with reference to the celebration of the fourth\r\ncentennial of the discovery of America.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 2, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, as required by section 14 of the act of March 2,\r\n1889, an agreement concluded on the 20th day of May last between the\r\ncommissioners on behalf of the United States, commonly known as the\r\nCherokee Commission, and the Iowa Indians residing in the Indian\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nA letter of the Secretary of the Interior, which is accompanied by\r\ncommunications from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Assistant\r\nAttorney-General, is also submitted.\r\n\r\nThese papers present a full and clear statement of the matters of fact\r\nand questions of law which Congress will need to consider in passing\r\nupon the question of the ratification of the agreement, which is\r\nsubmitted for its consideration and such action as may be deemed proper.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 11, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State,\r\nincluding a report of the action of the International American\r\nConference, lately in session in this city, concerning the protection of\r\npatents, trademarks, and copyrights in commerce between the American\r\nRepublics, to which I invite your attention.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 11, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the accompanying letter of the Secretary of\r\nState, submitting the recommendations of the International American\r\nConference for the better protection of the public health against the\r\nspread of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 12, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of State, inclosing a\r\ncopy of a report of the International American Conference, recently\r\nin session at this capital, recommending the establishment of an\r\ninternational American monetary union, and suggesting that the President\r\nbe authorized to invite the several American nations to send delegates\r\nto its first meeting in Washington on the first Wednesday of January\r\nnext; that authority also be granted for the appointment of three\r\ndelegates on the part of the United States, and that an appropriation\r\nbe made to meet the necessary expenses.\r\n\r\nI commend these suggestions and hope they will receive the prompt\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 14, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of State, inclosing the\r\nrecommendation of the International American Conference with reference\r\nto the adoption by the American Republics of a uniform code of\r\ninternational law, to which your attention is respectfully directed.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 14, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of State, inclosing the\r\nrecommendations of the International American Conference, recently in\r\nsession at this capital, concerning a uniform system of port dues and\r\nconsular fees to be adopted by the several American Republics, to which\r\nI invite your attention.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 15, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of State, inclosing\r\na resolution adopted by the International American Conference for\r\nthe erection of a memorial tablet in the diplomatic chamber of the\r\nDepartment of State to commemorate the meeting of that body.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 15, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your information, certain reports on the\r\nsubject of extradition adopted by the International American Conference\r\nat its recent sessions in this city.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 15, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit two agreements concluded by the commission appointed under\r\nsection 14 of the act of March 2, 1889, commonly known as the Cherokee\r\nCommission, with the Citizen band of Pottawatomie Indians and the band\r\nof Absentee Shawnees, respectively, for the cession of certain lands to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Secretary of the Interior, the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs, and the Assistant Attorney-General for the Department of the\r\nInterior relating to the same matter are also submitted.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 17, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe act making appropriations to provide for the expenses of the\r\ngovernment of the District of Columbia for the fiscal year ending June\r\n30, 1890, provides, among other things, that the President shall appoint\r\nthree competent sanitary engineers to examine and report upon the system\r\nof sewerage existing in the District of Columbia, together with such\r\nsuggestions and recommendations as may to them seem necessary and\r\ndesirable for the modification and extension of the same, which report\r\nwas to be transmitted to Congress by the President at its next session.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the authority thus conferred, on the 17th of August,\r\n1889, I appointed Rudolph Hering, of New York, Samuel M. Gray, of Rhode\r\nIsland, and Frederick P. Stearns, of Massachusetts, to make this\r\nexamination and report.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen named were believed to have such ability and experience as\r\nsanitary engineers as to guarantee an intelligent and exhaustive study\r\nof the problem submitted to them.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith their report, which has just been submitted to me,\r\nfor the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 23, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the House of Representatives requesting\r\nme, if in my judgment not incompatible with the public interest, to\r\nfurnish to the House the correspondence since March 4, 1889, between the\r\nGovernment of the United States and the Government of Great Britain\r\ntouching the subjects in dispute in the Bering Sea, I transmit a letter\r\nfrom the Secretary of State, which is accompanied by the correspondence\r\nreferred to in the resolution.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 29, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe recent attempt to secure a charter from the State of North Dakota\r\nfor a lottery company, the pending effort to obtain from the State of\r\nLouisiana a renewal of the charter of the Louisiana State Lottery, and\r\nthe establishment of one or more lottery companies at Mexican towns near\r\nour border have served the good purpose of calling public attention to\r\nan evil of vast proportions. If the baneful effects of the lotteries\r\nwere confined to the States that give the companies corporate powers\r\nand a license to conduct the business, the citizens of other States,\r\nbeing powerless to apply legal remedies, might clear themselves of\r\nresponsibility by the use of such moral agencies as were within their\r\nreach. But the case is not so. The people of all the States are\r\ndebauched and defrauded. The vast sums of money offered to the States\r\nfor charters are drawn from the people of the United States, and the\r\nGeneral Government through its mail system is made the effective and\r\nprofitable medium of intercourse between the lottery company and its\r\nvictims. The use of the mails is quite as essential to the companies\r\nas the State license. It would be practically impossible for these\r\ncompanies to exist if the public mails were once effectively closed\r\nagainst their advertisements and remittances. The use of the mails by\r\nthese companies is a prostitution of an agency only intended to serve\r\nthe purposes of a legitimate trade and a decent social intercourse.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, I am sure, for me to attempt to portray the robbery\r\nof the poor and the widespread corruption of public and private morals\r\nwhich are the necessary incidents of these lottery schemes.\r\n\r\nThe national capital has become a subheadquarters of the Louisiana\r\nLottery Company, and its numerous agents and attorneys are conducting\r\nhere a business involving probably a larger use of the mails than that\r\nof any legitimate business enterprise in the District of Columbia. There\r\nseems to be good reason to believe that the corrupting touch of these\r\nagents has been felt by the clerks in the postal service and by some of\r\nthe police officers of the District.\r\n\r\nSevere and effective legislation should be promptly enacted to enable\r\nthe Post-Office Department to purge the mails of all letters,\r\nnewspapers, and circulars relating to the business.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the Postmaster-General which I transmit herewith points\r\nout the inadequacy of the existing statutes and suggests legislation\r\nthat would be effective.\r\n\r\nIt may also be necessary to so regulate the carrying of letters by the\r\nexpress companies as to prevent the use of those agencies to maintain\r\ncommunication between the lottery companies and their agents or\r\ncustomers in other States.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem possible that there can be any division of sentiment\r\nas to the propriety of closing the mails against these companies, and\r\nI therefore venture to express the hope that such proper powers as\r\nare necessary to that end will be at once given to the Post-Office\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 30, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Acting Secretary of State, in\r\nresponse to a resolution of the Senate of the 23d instant, calling for\r\ninformation touching the alleged arrest and imprisonment of A.J.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 8, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received, under date of July 29 ultimo, a communication from Hon.\r\nGeorge W. Steele, governor of the Territory of Oklahoma, in which, among\r\nother things, he says:\r\n\r\n  A delegation from township 16, range 1, in this county, has just left\r\n  me, who came to represent that there are at this time twenty-eight\r\n  families in that township who are in actual need of the necessaries of\r\n  life, and they give it as their opinion that their township is not an\r\n  exception, and that in the very near future a large proportion of the\r\n  settlers of this Territory will have to have assistance.\r\n\r\n  This I have looked for, but have hoped to bridge over until after the\r\n  legislature meets, when I thought some arrangement might be made for\r\n  taking care of these needy people; but with little taxable property in\r\n  the Territory, and very many necessary demands to be made and met, I\r\n  doubt if the legislature will be able to make such provision until a\r\n  crop is raised next year as will be adequate to the demands. * * *\r\n\r\n  Now I know whereof I speak, and I say there are a great many people in\r\n  this Territory who have not the necessary means of providing meals for\r\n  a day to come and are being helped by their very poor neighbors. No one\r\n  regrets more than I do the necessity of making the foregoing statement,\r\n  and I have hoped to bridge the matter over, as I have said before,\r\n  until the legislature would meet and see if some provision could be\r\n  made.\r\n\r\n  I now see the utter hopelessness of such a course, and I beg of you to\r\n  call the attention of Congress to the condition of our people, with the\r\n  earnest hope that provision may be made whereby great suffering may be\r\n  relieved; and I assure you that so far as I am able to prevent it not\r\n  one ounce of provisions or a cent of money contributed to the above\r\n  need shall be improperly used.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation received by me from other sources leads me to believe that\r\nGovernor Steele is altogether right in his impression that there will\r\nbe, unless relief is afforded either by public appropriation or by\r\norganized individual effort, widespread suffering among the settlers\r\nin Oklahoma. Many of these people expended in travel and in providing\r\nshelter for their families all of their accumulated means. The crop\r\nprospects for this year are by reason of drought quite unfavorable, and\r\nthe ability of the Territory itself to provide relief must be inadequate\r\nduring this year.\r\n\r\nI am advised that there is an unexpended balance of about $45,000 of\r\nthe fund appropriated for the relief of the sufferers by flood upon the\r\nMississippi River and its tributaries, and I recommend that authority be\r\ngiven to use this fund to meet the most urgent necessities of the poorer\r\npeople in Oklahoma. Steps have been taken to ascertain more particularly\r\nthe condition of the people throughout the Territory, and if a larger\r\nrelief should seem to be necessary the facts will be submitted to\r\nCongress. If the fund to which I have referred should be made available\r\nfor relief in Oklahoma, care will be taken that so much of it as is\r\nnecessary to be expended shall be judiciously applied to the most worthy\r\nand necessitous cases.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 26, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval the bill (H.R. 7170) \"to authorize\r\nthe city of Ogden, Utah, to assume an increased indebtedness,\"\r\n\r\nThe purpose and effect of this bill is to relieve the city of Ogden from\r\nthe limitation imposed by the act of July 30, 1886, upon all municipal\r\ncorporations in the Territories as to the indebtedness which they may\r\nlawfully contract. The general law fixes the limit of 4 per cent upon\r\nthe last assessment for taxation; this bill extends the limit as to the\r\ncity of Ogden to 8 per cent. The purposes for which this legislation is\r\nasked are not peculiar or exceptional. They relate to schools, street\r\nimprovements, and to sewerage, and are common to every prosperous and\r\ngrowing town and city. If the argument by which this measure is\r\nsupported is adopted, the conclusion should be a repeal or modification\r\nof the general law; but in my opinion the limitation imposed by the act\r\nof 1886 is wise and wholesome and should not be relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the governor of Utah for 1889 states the population of\r\nOgden to be 15,000, the valuation for taxation $7,000,000, and the\r\nexisting indebtedness $100,000. It will be noticed that under the\r\nexisting limit the city has power to increase its indebtedness\r\n$180,000, which would seem to be enough to make a good beginning in the\r\nconstruction of sewers, while the cost of street improvements is usually\r\nmet in large part by direct assessment upon the property benefited.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed in the report of the House committee that any city in\r\nthe States similarly situated \"would have the making of the needed\r\nimprovements within its own power,\" while the fact is that almost all of\r\nour States have either by their constitutions or statutes limited the\r\npower of municipal corporations to incur indebtedness, and the limit is\r\ngenerally lower than that fixed by the act regulating this matter in the\r\nTerritories. A large city debt retards growth and in the end defeats\r\nthe purpose of those who think by mortgaging the future to attract\r\npopulation and property. I do not doubt that the citizens of Ogden will\r\nultimately realize that the creation of a municipal debt of over half a\r\nmillion dollars by a city of 15,000 population--being $37 per capita--is\r\nunwise.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 29, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval the bill (H.R. 848) \"to authorize the\r\nconstruction of an addition to the public building in Dallas, Tex.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill authorizes the construction of a wing or addition to the\r\npresent public building at a cost of $200,000. I find that the bill\r\nas originally introduced by the member representing the Congressional\r\ndistrict in which Dallas is situated fixed $100,000 as the limit of\r\nthe proposed expenditure, and it was so reported from the Committee\r\non Public Buildings and Grounds after conferring with the Supervising\r\nArchitect of the Treasury. A bill of the same tenor was introduced in\r\nthe Senate by one of the Senators from that State, fixing the same\r\nlimit of expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe public building at Dallas, for which a first appropriation of\r\n$75,000 was made in 1882, subsequently increased to $125,000, was only\r\ncompleted in 1889. It is probably inadequate now to the convenient\r\ntransaction of business, chiefly in that part assigned to the\r\nPost-Office Department. The material and architectural style of any\r\naddition are fixed by the present building and its ground area by\r\nthe available unoccupied space, as no provision is made for buying\r\nadditional ground. The present building is 85 by 56 feet, and Mr. John\r\nS. Witwer, the postmaster and the custodian of the building, writing\r\nto the Supervising Architect, advises that to meet the present and\r\nprospective needs of the Government an addition at least two-thirds as\r\nlarge as the present building should be provided. It will be seen from\r\nthe following extract from a letter of the Supervising Architect to the\r\nchairman of the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, dated\r\nFebruary 17, 1890, that a building larger than that suggested can be\r\nerected within the limit of $100,000. He says:\r\n\r\n  From computations made in this office based upon data received it is\r\n  found that an extension or wing about 40 by 85 feet in dimensions, three\r\n  stories high, with basement, giving 3,400 square feet, in addition to\r\n  the 4,760 square feet of the first-floor area of the building, of\r\n  fireproof construction, can be erected on the present site within the\r\n  limit of cost proposed by said bill, namely, $100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be possible that an expenditure of $325,000 for a public building\r\nat Dallas, if the questions of site, material, and architecture were all\r\nundetermined, could be defended, but under existing conditions I do not\r\nsee how an appropriation of $200,000 can be justified when one-half that\r\nsum is plainly adequate to such relief as the present site allows.\r\n\r\nThe legislation for the erection of public buildings has not proceeded,\r\nso far as I can trace it, upon any general rules. Neither population nor\r\nthe extent of the public business transacted has always indicated the\r\npoints where public buildings should first be built or the cost of the\r\nstructures. It can not be expected that, in the absence of some general\r\nlaw, the committees of Congress having charge of such matters will\r\nproceed in their recommendations upon strict or equal lines. The bills\r\nare individual, and if comparisons are attempted the necessary element\r\nof probable future growth is made to cover all apparent inequalities. It\r\nwill be admitted, I am sure, that only a public need should suggest the\r\nexpenditure of the public money, and that if all such needs can not be\r\nat once supplied the most general and urgent should have the preference.\r\n\r\nI am not unfriendly to a liberal annual expenditure for the erection of\r\npublic buildings where the safe and convenient transaction of the public\r\nbusiness demands it and the state of the revenues will permit. It would\r\nbe wiser, in my opinion, to build more and less costly houses and to fix\r\nby general law the amount of the annual expenditure for this purpose and\r\nsome order of preference between the cities asking for public buildings.\r\n\r\nBut in view of the pending legislation looking to a very large reduction\r\nof our revenues and of the urgency and necessity of a large increase\r\nin our expenditures in certain directions, I am of the opinion that\r\nappropriations for the erection of public buildings and all kindred\r\nexpenditures should be kept at the minimum until the effect of other\r\nprobable legislation can be accurately measured.\r\n\r\nThe erection of a public building is largely a matter of local interest\r\nand convenience, while expenditures for enlarged relief and recognition\r\nto the soldiers and sailors of the war for the preservation of the\r\nUnion, for necessary coast defenses, and for the extension of our\r\ncommerce with other American States are of universal interest and\r\ninvolve considerations, not of convenience, but of justice, honor,\r\nsafety, and general prosperity.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 4, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI return without my approval the bill (S. 1306) \"for the erection of\r\na public building at Hudson, N.Y.\" Hudson, from the best information\r\nattainable, is a city of only a little more than 10,000 population. If\r\nthe postal receipts are a fair indication of the growth of the city, it\r\nhas not been rapid, as they only increased about $4,000 in ten years.\r\nThe gross postal receipts for the year 1888 were but $14,809, and the\r\noffice force consists of three clerks and five carriers. There are no\r\nother Government officers at Hudson entitled under the law to offices or\r\nto an allowance for rent, unless it be a deputy collector of internal\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the bill and the correspondence with the Supervising\r\nArchitect that it is proposed to erect a two-story building, with\r\nfireproof vaults, heating and ventilating apparatus, and elevators, 40\r\nby 80 feet in dimensions. The ground-floor area of 3,200 feet, to be\r\ndevoted to the post-office, would give 400 square feet to each of the\r\npresent employees. The second story and the basement, each having the\r\nsame area, will be absolutely tenantless, unless authority is given by\r\nlaw to the custodian to rent the rooms to unofficial tenants. It seems\r\nto me to be very clear that the public needs do not suggest or justify\r\nsuch an expenditure as is contemplated by this bill.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 12, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval the bill (H.R. 7175) to provide for the\r\npurchase of a site and the erection of a public building thereon at\r\nTuscaloosa, in the State of Alabama.\r\n\r\nJudged by its postal revenues and by the force employed in the\r\noffice, the post-office at Tuscaloosa is not an important one. It has\r\none clerk, at a salary of $450, and no carriers. The report of the\r\nPostmaster-General shows that the gross receipts for the year 1888 were\r\n$6,379 and the net revenue less than $4,000. The annual receipts have\r\nonly increased about $3,000 in ten years. The rent now paid for a\r\nbuilding affording 2,200 square feet of floor space is $275.\r\n\r\nA general proposition to erect public buildings at this scale of expense\r\nin cities of the size of Tuscaloosa would not, I am sure, receive the\r\nsanction of Congress. It would involve the expenditure for buildings of\r\nten times the present net revenues of such offices, and in the case\r\nunder consideration would involve an increased cost for fuel, lights,\r\nand care greater than the rent now paid for the use of a room of ample\r\nsize. I would not insist that it must always be shown that a proposed\r\npublic building would yield an interest upon the investment, but in\r\nthe present uncertain state of the public revenues and expenditures,\r\nresulting from pending and probable legislation, there is, in my\r\nopinion, an absolute necessity that expenditures for public buildings\r\nshould be limited to cases where the public needs are very evident and\r\nvery imperative. It is clear that this is not such a case.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 17, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval the bill (S. 1762) \"to change the\r\nboundaries of the Uncompahgre Reservation.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill proposes to separate from the Ute Indian Reservation in\r\nUtah and restore to the public domain two ranges of townships along the\r\neast side of the reservation and bordering the Colorado State line.\r\nIt is said that these lands are wholly worthless to the Indians for\r\ncultivation or for grazing purposes, and it must follow, I think, that\r\nthey are equally worthless for such purposes to white men.\r\n\r\nThe object, then, of this legislation is to be sought not in any\r\npublic demand for these lands for the use of settlers--for if they\r\nare susceptible of that use the Indians have a clear equity to take\r\nallotments upon them--but in that part of the bill which confirms the\r\nmineral entries, or entries for mineral uses, which have been unlawfully\r\nmade \"or attempted to be made on said lands.\" It is evidently a private\r\nand not a public end that is to be promoted. It does not follow, of\r\ncourse, that this private end may not be wholly meritorious and the\r\nrelief sought on behalf of these persons altogether just and proper.\r\nThe facts, as I am advised, are that upon these lands there are veins\r\nor beds of asphaltum or gilsonite supposed to be of very great value.\r\n\r\nEntries have been made in that vicinity, but upon public lands, which\r\nlands have been resold for very large amounts. It is not important,\r\nperhaps, that the United States should in parting with these lands\r\nrealize their value, but it is essential, I think, that favoritism\r\nshould have no part in connection with the sales. The bill confirms all\r\nattempted entries of these mineral lands at the price of $20 per acre\r\n(a price that is suggestive of something unusual) without requiring\r\nevidence of the expenditure of any money upon the claim, or even proof\r\nthat the claimant was the discoverer of the deposits.\r\n\r\nThe bill requires \"good faith,\" but it will be next to impossible for\r\nthe officers of the Interior Department to show actual knowledge on the\r\npart of the claimant of the lines of the reservation. The case will\r\npractically be as to this matter in the hands of the claimant. But why\r\nshould good faith at the moment of attempting the entry, without any\r\nrequirement of expenditure, and followed, it may be, within twenty-four\r\nhours by actual notice that he was upon a reservation, give an advantage\r\nin the sale of these lands that may represent a very large sum of money?\r\n\r\nIn the second place, I do not think it wise, without notice even to the\r\nIndians, to segregate these lands from their reservation. It is true, I\r\nthink, that they hold these lands by an Executive order, with a contract\r\nright to take allotments upon them, and that the lands in question are\r\nnot likely to be sought as an allotment by any Indian. But the Indians\r\nhave been placed on this reservation and its boundaries explained to\r\nthem, and to take these lands in this manner is calculated to excite\r\ntheir distrust and fears, and possibly to create serious trouble.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 20, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval the bill (H.R. 3934) \"to authorize the\r\nboard of supervisors of Maricopa County, Ariz., to issue certain bonds\r\nin aid of the construction of a certain railroad.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill proposes to confer authority upon the supervisors of the\r\ncounty of Maricopa to issue county bonds at the rate of $4,000 per mile\r\nin aid of a railroad to be constructed from Phoenix northwardly to the\r\ncounty line, a distance estimated at 50 miles, but probably somewhat\r\nlonger. The bill seems to have passed the House of Representatives under\r\nan entire misapprehension of its true scope and effect. In the brief\r\nreport submitted by the Committee on Territories it is said that \"by the\r\nterms of the bill the county receives _bonds_ in payment of the money\r\nproposed to be advanced,\" and in the course of the debate the Delegate\r\nfrom Arizona mistakenly stated in response to a request for information\r\nthat the bill proposed a loan by the county, in exchange for which it\r\nwas to receive the bonds of the railroad company. In fact, the bill does\r\nnot provide for a loan to be secured by bonds, but for a subscription of\r\nstock. How far this mistake may have affected the passage of the bill\r\ncan not of course be known.\r\n\r\nThe bill does not submit the question of granting this aid to a vote\r\nof the people of the county, but confers direct authority upon the\r\nsupervisors to issue the bonds. It is said, however, that in April,\r\n1889, an election was held to obtain the views of the people upon the\r\nquestion. It does not appear from any papers submitted to me who were\r\nthe managers of this so-called election; what notice, if any, was given;\r\nwhat qualifications on the part of voters were insisted upon, if any, or\r\nin what form the question was presented. There was no law providing for\r\nsuch an election. Being wholly voluntary, the election was, of course,\r\nunder the management of those who favored the subsidy, and was conducted\r\nwithout any legal restraints as to the voting or certification. I have\r\nasked for a statement of the vote by precincts, and have been given what\r\npurports to be the vote at twelve points. The total affirmative vote\r\ngiven was 1,975 and the negative 134. But of the affirmative vote 1,543\r\nwere given at Phoenix and 188 at Tempe, a town very near to Phoenix. If\r\nthere were no other objections to this bill, I should deem this alone\r\nsufficient, that no provision is made for submitting to a vote of the\r\npeople at an election, after due notice and under the sanction of law,\r\nthe question whether this subscription shall be made.\r\n\r\nBut again, the bill proposes to suspend for this case two provisions\r\nof the act of Congress of July 30, 1886--first, that provision which\r\nforbids municipal corporations from subscribing to the stock of other\r\ncorporations or loaning their credit to such corporations, and, second,\r\nthat provision which forbids any municipal corporation from creating a\r\ndebt in excess of 4 per cent of its taxable property as fixed by the\r\nlast assessment. The condition of things then existing in Arizona had\r\nnot a little to do with the enactment by Congress of this law, intended\r\nto give to the people of the Territories that protection against\r\noppressive municipal debts which was secured to the people of most of\r\nthe States by constitutional limitations. The wisdom of this legislation\r\nis not contested by the friends of this bill, but they claim that the\r\ncircumstances here are so peculiar as to justify this exception. I do\r\nnot think so. In the States the limitation upon municipal indebtedness\r\nis usually placed in the constitution, in order that it may be\r\ninflexible. If a showing of need, gain, or advantage is to overcome the\r\nbarrier, then it is scarcely worth while to declare a limitation. Only\r\na belief that the limit is inflexible will promote care and economy in\r\nadministration. If this bill becomes a law, how can Congress refuse to\r\nany county in any of the Territories the right to subscribe to the stock\r\nof a railroad company, especially where the subscription would not\r\nexceed the debt limit, upon a showing of the advantages of better and\r\ncheaper communications?\r\n\r\nMaricopa County is one of great extent. Its northern boundary is 95\r\nmiles long, its southern boundary 66, its eastern 45, and its western\r\n102. This great area is to be taxed to construct a road which can, in\r\nthe nature of things, be of advantage to but a fraction of it. There is\r\nno unity of interest or equality of advantage. It may very well be that\r\na section of these lands along the line of the road, and especially\r\ntown lots in Phoenix, would have an added value much greater than the\r\nincreased burden imposed, but it is equally clear that much property\r\nin the county will receive no appreciable benefit.\r\n\r\nThe existing bonded indebtedness of Maricopa County is $272,000; the tax\r\nassessment of the county is about $5,000,000, and the population is\r\nestimated, by multiplying the vote cast in 1888 by 6, at about 12,000.\r\nIt will be seen that the bonded debt, to say nothing of a floating debt,\r\nwhich is said to be small, is already largely in excess of the legal\r\nlimit, and it is proposed to increase it by a subscription that will\r\ncertainly involve $200,000, and possibly $250,000. If the bill becomes a\r\nlaw, the bonded indebtedness will very closely approximate 10 per cent\r\nof the assessed valuation of the property of the county.\r\n\r\nThe condition of things in the county of Yavapai, lying immediately\r\nnorth of Maricopa, and through which this road is also to run, though\r\nnot directly affected by this legislation, is very instructive in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nBy an act of the legislature of Arizona passed the year before the act\r\nof Congress to which I have referred Yavapai County was authorized to\r\nsubscribe $4,000 per mile to this line of road. The total length of the\r\nroad in the county was 147 miles, and 74 miles, to Prescott, have been\r\nconstructed. The secretary of the Territory, in response to an inquiry,\r\nstates the debt of Yavapai County at $563,000 and the assessment for\r\ntaxation at \"between six and seven millions.\" There are 73 miles of road\r\nyet to be built from the present terminus, Prescott, to the south line\r\nof the county, for which Yavapai County must make a further issue of\r\nbonds of $292,000, making a total county debt of $855,000, or above 13\r\nper cent upon the taxable assessment (taking that at $6,500,000), and\r\na per capita county debt of nearly $85, taking the population at about\r\n10,600, as stated in the report of the Senate committee. Surely no one\r\nwill insist that the true and permanent prosperity of these communities\r\nwill be promoted by loading their energies and their industries with\r\nthese great debts. I feel the force of the suggestion that the freight\r\ncharges now imposed upon the farm and orchard products of Maricopa\r\nCounty by the railroads now in operation are oppressive. But this bill\r\ndoes not afford much relief even in that direction. There would be but\r\none competing point, viz, Phoenix. At all other points on the proposed\r\nroad the people would be subject to the exaction of just such rates as\r\nare demanded by the other lines. If this bill contained some effective\r\nprovision to secure reasonable freight rates to the people who are to be\r\ntaxed to build the road, it would go far to secure my favorable\r\nconsideration for it.\r\n\r\nI have carefully examined the reports of the committees and every\r\nargument that has been submitted to me by the friends of the bill, but\r\nI can not bring myself to believe that the permanent welfare of the\r\ncommunities affected by it will be promoted by its passage.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 9, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval the bill (H.R. 5974) entitled \"An\r\nact extending the time of payment to purchasers of land of the Omaha\r\ntribe of Indians in Nebraska, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States holds the legal title of these lands, which have been\r\nsold for the benefit of the Omaha Indians to secure the unpaid purchase\r\nmoney, the time of payment of which it is proposed by this act to\r\nextend. There is no objection that I know of, either on the part of\r\nthe United States or of the Indians, to the extension of the unpaid\r\ninstallments due from purchasers. This relief is probably due to the\r\npurchasers. The bill, however, contains the following provision:\r\n\r\n  That all the lands the payment for which is hereby extended shall be\r\n  subject to taxation in all respects by and in the State of Nebraska\r\n  as if fully paid for and patents issued.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, while it is entirely proper that the interest of the purchasers in\r\nthese lands should share the burdens of the communities in which the\r\nlands are located, the title of the United States and the beneficial\r\ninterest of the Indians in the lands should not be subjected to sale for\r\nthe delinquency of the purchasers in paying tax assessments levied upon\r\nthe lands. The effect of the provision which has been quoted would, in\r\nmy opinion, give to the purchaser at a tax sale a title superior to\r\nthe lien of the Government for purchase money. The bill should have\r\ncontained a proviso that only the interest of the purchasers from the\r\nGovernment could be sold for taxes, and that the tax sale should be\r\nsubject to the lien of the United States for unpaid purchase money.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 30, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval the joint resolution (H. Res.\r\nNo. 39) declaring the retirement of Captain Charles B. Stivers, of the\r\nUnited States Army, legal and valid, and that he is entitled as such\r\nofficer to his pay.\r\n\r\nCaptain Stivers was dismissed the service summarily by order of the\r\nPresident on July 15, 1863. A subsequent examination into the causes\r\nleading to this action seems to have satisfied the President that an\r\ninjustice had been done to the officer, and on the 11th day of August,\r\n1863, an order was issued revoking the order of dismissal and restoring\r\nCaptain Stivers to duty as an officer of the Army. On December 30, 1864,\r\nby a proper order from the War Department, after examination, Captain\r\nStivers was placed upon the retired list of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has decided in the case of The United States _vs_.\r\nCorson (114 U.S. Reports, 619):\r\n\r\nFirst. That at the time of the issuance of the order of dismissal the\r\nPresident had authority under the law to summarily dismiss an officer,\r\nand that the effect of such an order was absolutely to separate the\r\nofficer from the service.\r\n\r\nSecond. That having been thus separated from the service he could not be\r\nrestored except by nomination to the Senate and its advice and consent\r\nto the appointment.\r\n\r\nMr. Garland, as Attorney-General, gave an opinion to the Secretary of\r\nWar in the case of Captain Stivers, based upon the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court to which I have referred, holding that Captain Stivers\r\nwas not an officer on the retired list of the Army. The present\r\nAttorney-General, with whom I have conferred, takes the same view\r\nof the law. Indeed, the decision of the Supreme Court to which I have\r\nreferred is so exactly in point that there can be no doubt as to the law\r\nof the case. It is undoubtedly competent for Congress by act or joint\r\nresolution to authorize the President, by and with the advice of the\r\nSenate, to appoint Captain Stivers to be a captain in the Army of the\r\nUnited States and to place him upon the retired list. It is also\r\nperfectly competent by suitable legislation for Congress to give to this\r\nofficer the pay of his grade during the interval of time when he was\r\nimproperly carried upon the army lists. But the joint resolution which\r\nI herewith return does not attempt to deal with the case in that way.\r\nIt undertakes to declare that the retirement of Captain Stivers was\r\nlegal and valid and that he always has been and is entitled to his pay\r\nas such officer. I do not think this is a competent method of giving the\r\nrelief intended. The retirement under the law as it then existed was not\r\nlegal and valid, as the highest judicial tribunal under the Constitution\r\nhas declared, for the reason that Captain Stivers was not then an\r\nofficer on the active list. That being so, it follows, of course, that\r\nhe was not entitled to draw the pay of an office he did not hold.\r\n\r\nThe relief should have taken the form usual in such cases, which is to\r\nauthorize the appointment of the officer to a place made for him on the\r\nretired list.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 1, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return to the Senate without my approval the bill (S. 473) \"for the\r\nrelief of the Portland Company, of Portland, Me.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill confers upon the Court of Claims jurisdiction to inquire into\r\nand determine how much certain steam machinery built for the United\r\nStates under contract, and to be used in the vessels _Agawam_ and\r\n_Pontoosuc_, cost the contractors over and above the contract price and\r\nany allowances for extra work which have been made, and requires the\r\ncourt to enter judgment in favor of the claimant for the excess of cost\r\nabove such contract price and allowances.\r\n\r\nThe bill differs from others which have been presented to me, and one of\r\nwhich I have approved, in that it does not make the further allowance to\r\nthe contractors contingent upon the fact that the additional expense was\r\nthe result of the acts of the Government through its officers' causing\r\ndelays and increased cost in the construction of the work.\r\n\r\nThe bill in effect directs the court to ignore the contract entirely,\r\nexcept as payments under it are to be treated as credits, and to allow\r\nthe contractors the cost of the work, and that without reference to\r\ntheir own negligence or want of skill in executing the work. There would\r\nseem to be no object in the Government's making a contract for work if\r\nthe contract is only to be binding upon the parties in the event that\r\nthe contractor realizes a profit.\r\n\r\nI can not give my approval to the proposition applied here, which if\r\nallowed here should be given general application, that every contractor\r\nwith the Government who during the early days of the war failed to\r\nrealize, by reason of increase in the cost of labor and materials, a\r\nprofit upon the contract shall now have access to the Court of Claims\r\nto recover upon the _quantum meruit_ the cost of the work.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 1, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval Senate bill No. 1857, \"for the relief of\r\nCharles P. Chouteau, survivor of Chouteau, Harrison & Valle.\"\r\n\r\nThis claim has been once presented to the Court of Claims and fully\r\nheard. This bill authorizes a rehearing. I find upon examination that\r\nevery fact connected with the case necessary to the determination of the\r\nquestion whether the claim should be appropriated for has already been\r\nfound and stated by the Court of Claims in a published opinion. Judgment\r\nwas given against the claimant upon the ground that a settlement had\r\nbeen made and a receipt given in full. If in the opinion of Congress\r\nthis receipt, given under the circumstances which accompanied it, should\r\nnot be held a bar to such further appropriation as is equitable, all the\r\nfacts have been found that can be necessary to determine the question\r\nwhat further payment should be made to the contractors. There can be no\r\nreason, as it seems to me, for a retrial of the case in the Court of\r\nClaims in the absence of any showing of newly discovered evidence. The\r\nresult would only differ from the result already obtained in that under\r\nthe bill which I return the court would enter a judgment instead of a\r\nfinding, and the judgment could only be paid after Congressional action.\r\n\r\nThe finding which has already been made, as I have said, is a complete\r\nbasis for any such action as Congress may think should be taken in the\r\npremises.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 7, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval the bill (S. 3830) \"to prohibit bookmaking\r\nof any kind and pool selling in the District of Columbia for the purpose\r\nof gaming.\"\r\n\r\nMy objection to the bill is that it does not prohibit bookmaking and\r\npool selling, but, on the contrary, expressly saves from the operation\r\nof its prohibitions and penalties the Washington Jockey Club \"and any\r\nother regular organizations owning race tracks no less than 1 mile in\r\nlength,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIf this form of gambling is to be prohibited, as I think it should be,\r\nthe penalties should include all persons and all places.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

In case of temporary absence, from sickness or other unavoidable\r\n  cause, of clerks, copyists, or employees of other grades for which\r\n  examinations are held, there may be certified in the manner provided\r\n  for in this rule, and employed under such regulations as the heads of\r\n  the several Departments shall prescribe, substitutes for such clerks,\r\n  copyists, or other employees so absent; and such substitutes so employed\r\n  in any Department shall be appointed in the order of their employment\r\n  as substitutes to the regular grades of that Department without further\r\n  certification as vacancies to which they are eligible may occur therein\r\n  while so employed as substitutes, every such appointment to be at once\r\n  reported to the Commission: _Provided_, That no person while employed\r\n  as a substitute in one Department shall be certified as a substitute to\r\n  any other Department, and that no person employed as a substitute shall\r\n  by reason of such employment be deprived of any right of certification\r\n  for a regular place to which he maybe entitled under the rules: _And\r\n  provided further_, That service rendered as a substitute shall not be\r\n  ground for reinstatement under Departmental Rule X.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From McPherson's Hand Book of Politics for 1890.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 24, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Attorney-General_:\r\n\r\nI have had frequent occasion during the last six months to confer\r\nwith you in reference to the obstructions offered in the counties of\r\nLeon, Gadsden, Madison, and Jefferson, in the State of Florida, to\r\nthe execution of the process of the courts of the United States. It is\r\nnot necessary to say more of the situation than that the officers of\r\nthe United States are not suffered freely to exercise their lawful\r\nfunctions. This condition of things can not be longer tolerated. You\r\nwill therefore instruct United States Marshal Weeks as soon as he has\r\nqualified to proceed at once to execute such writs of arrest as may be\r\nplaced in his hands. If he apprehends resistance, he will employ such\r\ncivil posse as may seem adequate to discourage resistance or to overcome\r\nit. He should proceed with calmness and moderation, which should always\r\nattend a public officer in the execution of his duty, and at the same\r\ntime with a firmness and courage that will impress the lawless with\r\na wholesome sense of the dangers and futility of resistance. You will\r\nassure the officers of the law and those who have foolishly and wickedly\r\nthought to set the law at defiance that every resource lodged with the\r\nExecutive by the Constitution and the laws will as the necessity arises\r\nbe employed to make it safe and feasible to hold a Federal commission\r\nand to execute the duties it imposes.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 14, 1890_.[10]\r\n\r\nThe death of John C. Frémont, a major-general on the retired list of\r\nthe Army of the United States, is an event calling for some appropriate\r\nexpression of the national sorrow and of a grateful appreciation of his\r\npublic services. His career was full of adventurous and useful discovery\r\nand of devoted and conspicuous service both in civil and military\r\naffairs. He opened the passes of the Rocky Mountains and gave value to\r\nhis discoveries by aiding to create an American State on the Pacific\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\n_It is therefore ordered_, That the national flag be displayed at\r\nhalf-mast upon all the buildings of the Executive Departments in this\r\ncity until after the funeral shall have taken place.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the President:\r\n\r\nE.W.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 7, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe reports of the several Executive Departments, which will be laid\r\nbefore Congress in the usual course, will exhibit in detail the\r\noperations of the Government for the last fiscal year. Only the more\r\nimportant incidents and results, and chiefly such as may be the\r\nfoundation of the recommendations I shall submit, will be referred to\r\nin this annual message.\r\n\r\nThe vast and increasing business of the Government has been transacted\r\nby the several Departments during the year with faithfulness, energy,\r\nand success.\r\n\r\nThe revenues, amounting to above $450,000,000, have been collected and\r\ndisbursed without revealing, so far as I can ascertain, a single case\r\nof defalcation or embezzlement. An earnest effort has been made to\r\nstimulate a sense of responsibility and public duty in all officers and\r\nemployees of every grade, and the work done by them has almost wholly\r\nescaped unfavorable criticism. I speak of these matters with freedom\r\nbecause the credit of this good work is not mine, but is shared by\r\nthe heads of the several Departments with the great body of faithful\r\nofficers and employees who serve under them. The closest scrutiny of\r\nCongress is invited to all the methods of administration and to every\r\nitem of expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations of our country with the nations of Europe and of\r\nthe East have been undisturbed, while the ties of good will and common\r\ninterest that bind us to the States of the Western Hemisphere have been\r\nnotably strengthened by the conference held in this capital to consider\r\nmeasures for the general welfare. Pursuant to the invitation authorized\r\nby Congress, the representatives of every independent State of the\r\nAmerican continent and of Hayti met in conference in this capital in\r\nOctober, 1889, and continued in session until the 19th of last April.\r\nThis important convocation marks a most interesting and influential\r\nepoch in the history of the Western Hemisphere. It is noteworthy that\r\nBrazil, invited while under an imperial form of government, shared\r\nas a republic in the deliberations and results of the conference. The\r\nrecommendations of this conference were all transmitted to Congress\r\nat the last session.\r\n\r\nThe International Marine Conference, which sat at Washington last\r\nwinter, reached a very gratifying result. The regulations suggested have\r\nbeen brought to the attention of all the Governments represented, and\r\ntheir general adoption is confidently expected. The legislation of\r\nCongress at the last session is in conformity with the propositions of\r\nthe conference, and the proclamation therein provided for will be issued\r\nwhen the other powers have given notice of their adhesion.\r\n\r\nThe Conference of Brussels, to devise means for suppressing the slave\r\ntrade in Africa, afforded an opportunity for a new expression of the\r\ninterest the American people feel in that great work. It soon became\r\nevident that the measure proposed would tax the resources of the Kongo\r\nBasin beyond the revenues available under the general act of Berlin of\r\n1884. The United States, not being a party to that act, could not share\r\nin its revision, but by a separate act the Independent State of the\r\nKongo was freed from the restrictions upon a customs revenue. The\r\ndemoralizing and destructive traffic in ardent spirits among the tribes\r\nalso claimed the earnest attention of the conference, and the delegates\r\nof the United States were foremost in advocating measures for its\r\nrepression. An accord was reached the influence of which will be very\r\nhelpful and extend over a wide region. As soon as these measures shall\r\nreceive the sanction of the Netherlands, for a time withheld, the\r\ngeneral acts will be submitted for ratification by the Senate. Meanwhile\r\nnegotiations have been opened for a new and completed treaty of\r\nfriendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States and the\r\nIndependent State of the Kongo.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the past year the only independent monarchical\r\ngovernment on the Western Continent, that of Brazil, ceased to exist,\r\nand was succeeded by a republic. Diplomatic relations were at once\r\nestablished with the new Government, but it was not completely\r\nrecognized until an opportunity had been afforded to ascertain that it\r\nhad popular approval and support. When the course of events had yielded\r\nassurance of this fact, no time was lost in extending to the new\r\nGovernment a full and cordial welcome into the family of American\r\nCommonwealths. It is confidently believed that the good relations of the\r\ntwo countries will be preserved and that the future will witness an\r\nincreased intimacy of intercourse and an expansion of their mutual\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Central America has again been disturbed through a\r\nrevolutionary change in Salvador, which was not recognized by other\r\nStates, and hostilities broke out between Salvador and Guatemala,\r\nthreatening to involve all Central America in conflict and to undo\r\nthe progress which had been made toward a union of their interests.\r\nThe efforts of this Government were promptly and zealously exerted\r\nto compose their differences and through the active efforts of the\r\nrepresentative of the United States a provisional treaty of peace was\r\nsigned August 26, whereby the right of the Republic of Salvador to\r\nchoose its own rulers was recognized. General Ezeta, the chief of the\r\nProvisional Government, has since been confirmed in the Presidency by\r\nthe Assembly, and diplomatic recognition duly followed.\r\n\r\nThe killing of General Barrundia on board the Pacific mail steamer\r\n_Acapulco_, while anchored in transit in the port of San Jose de\r\nGuatemala, demanded careful inquiry. Having failed in a revolutionary\r\nattempt to invade Guatemala from Mexican territory, General Barrundia\r\ntook passage at Acapulco for Panama. The consent of the representatives\r\nof the United States was sought to effect his seizure, first at\r\nChamperico, where the steamer touched, and afterwards at San Jose.\r\nThe captain of the steamer refused to give up his passenger without a\r\nwritten order from the United States minister. The latter furnished the\r\ndesired letter, stipulating as the condition of his action that General\r\nBarrundia's life should be spared and that he should be tried only for\r\noffenses growing out of his insurrectionary movements. This letter was\r\nproduced to the captain of the _Acapulco_ by the military commander at\r\nSan Jose as his warrant to take the passenger from the steamer. General\r\nBarrundia resisted capture and was killed. It being evident that the\r\nminister, Mr. Mizner, had exceeded the bounds of his authority in\r\nintervening, in compliance with the demands of the Guatemalan\r\nauthorities, to authorize and effect, in violation of precedent, the\r\nseizure on a vessel of the United States of a passenger in transit\r\ncharged with political offenses, in order that he might be tried for\r\nsuch offenses under what was described as martial law. I was constrained\r\nto disavow Mr. Mizner's act and recall him from his post.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaragua Canal project, under the control of our citizens, is\r\nmaking most encouraging progress, all the preliminary conditions and\r\ninitial operations having been accomplished within the prescribed time.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year negotiations have been renewed for the settlement\r\nof the claims of American citizens against the Government of Chile,\r\nprincipally growing out of the late war with Peru. The reports from our\r\nminister at Santiago warrant the expectation of an early and\r\nsatisfactory adjustment.\r\n\r\nOur relations with China, which have for several years occupied so\r\nimportant a place in our diplomatic history, have called for careful\r\nconsideration and have been the subject of much correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe communications of the Chinese minister have brought into view the\r\nwhole subject of our conventional relations with his country, and at the\r\nsame time this Government, through its legation at Peking, has sought\r\nto arrange various matters and complaints touching the interests and\r\nprotection of our citizens in China.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the concurrent resolution of October 1, 1890, I have\r\nproposed to the Governments of Mexico and Great Britain to consider a\r\nconventional regulation of the passage of Chinese laborers across our\r\nsouthern and northern frontiers.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of August last Sir Edmund Monson, the arbitrator selected\r\nunder the treaty of December 6, 1888, rendered an award to the effect\r\nthat no compensation was due from the Danish Government to the United\r\nStates on account of what is commonly known as the Carlos Butterfield\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the French Republic continue to be cordial. Our\r\nrepresentative at that court has very diligently urged the removal of\r\nthe restrictions imposed upon our meat products, and it is believed that\r\nsubstantial progress has been made toward a just settlement.\r\n\r\nThe Samoan treaty, signed last year at Berlin by the representatives of\r\nthe United States, Germany, and Great Britain, after due ratification\r\nand exchange, has begun to produce salutary effects. The formation of\r\nthe government agreed upon will soon replace the disorder of the past by\r\na stable administration alike just to the natives and equitable to the\r\nthree powers most concerned in trade and intercourse with the Samoan\r\nIslands. The chief justice has been chosen by the King of Sweden and\r\nNorway on the invitation of the three powers, and will soon be\r\ninstalled. The land commission and the municipal council are in process\r\nof organization. A rational and evenly distributed scheme of taxation,\r\nboth municipal and upon imports, is in operation. Malietoa is respected\r\nas King.\r\n\r\nThe new treaty of extradition with Great Britain, after due\r\nratification, was proclaimed on the 25th of last March. Its beneficial\r\nworking is already apparent.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two Governments touching the fur-seal\r\nquestion in the Bering Sea is not yet adjusted, as will be seen by the\r\ncorrespondence which will soon be laid before the Congress. The offer\r\nto submit the question to arbitration, as proposed by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, has not been accepted, for the reason that the form of\r\nsubmission proposed is not thought to be calculated to assure a\r\nconclusion satisfactory to either party. It is sincerely hoped that\r\nbefore the opening of another sealing season some arrangement may be\r\neffected which will assure to the United States a property right derived\r\nfrom Russia, which was not disregarded by any nation for more than\r\neighty years preceding the outbreak of the existing trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the tariff act a wrong was done to the Kingdom of Hawaii which I am\r\nbound to presume was wholly unintentional. Duties were levied on certain\r\ncommodities which are included in the reciprocity treaty now existing\r\nbetween the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, without indicating\r\nthe necessary exception in favor of that Kingdom. I hope Congress will\r\nrepair what might otherwise seem to be a breach of faith on the part of\r\nthis Government.\r\n\r\nAn award in favor of the United States in the matter of the claim of\r\nMr. Van Bokkelen against Hayti was rendered on the 4th of December,\r\n1888, but owing to disorders then and afterwards prevailing in Hayti\r\nthe terms of payment were not observed. A new agreement as to the time\r\nof payment has been approved and is now in force. Other just claims of\r\ncitizens of the United States for redress of wrongs suffered during the\r\nlate political conflict in Hayti will, it is hoped, speedily yield to\r\nfriendly treatment.\r\n\r\nPropositions for the amendment of the treaty of extradition between the\r\nUnited States and Italy are now under consideration.\r\n\r\nYou will be asked to provide the means of accepting the invitation of\r\nthe Italian Government to take part in an approaching conference to\r\nconsider the adoption of a universal prime meridian from which to reckon\r\nlongitude and time. As this proposal follows in the track of the reform\r\nsought to be initiated by the Meridian Conference of Washington, held on\r\nthe invitation of this Government, the United States should manifest a\r\nfriendly interest in the Italian proposal.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I may refer with approval to the suggestion of my\r\npredecessors that standing provision be made for accepting, whenever\r\ndeemed advisable, the frequent invitations of foreign governments to\r\nshare in conferences looking to the advancement of international reforms\r\nin regard to science, sanitation, commercial laws and procedure, and\r\nother matters affecting the intercourse and progress of modern\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1889 an incident occurred which for some time\r\nthreatened to interrupt the cordiality of our relations with the\r\nGovernment of Portugal. That Government seized the Delagoa Bay Railway,\r\nwhich was constructed under a concession granted to an American citizen,\r\nand at the same time annulled the charter. The concessionary, who had\r\nembarked his fortune in the enterprise, having exhausted other means of\r\nredress, was compelled to invoke the protection of his Government. Our\r\nrepresentations, made coincidently with those of the British Government,\r\nwhose subjects were also largely interested, happily resulted in the\r\nrecognition by Portugal of the propriety of submitting the claim for\r\nindemnity growing out of its action to arbitration. This plan of\r\nsettlement having been agreed upon, the interested powers readily\r\nconcurred in the proposal to submit the case to the judgment of three\r\neminent jurists, to be designated by the President of the Swiss\r\nRepublic, who, upon the joint invitation of the Governments of the\r\nUnited States, Great Britain, and Portugal, has selected persons well\r\nqualified for the task before them.\r\n\r\nThe revision of our treaty relations with the Empire of Japan has\r\ncontinued to be the subject of consideration and of correspondence.\r\nThe questions involved are both grave and delicate; and while it will be\r\nmy duty to see that the interests of the United States are not by any\r\nchanges exposed to undue discrimination, I sincerely hope that such\r\nrevision as Will satisfy the legitimate expectations of the Japanese\r\nGovernment and maintain the present and long-existing friendly relations\r\nbetween Japan and the United States will be effected.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between our country and Mexico, born of close\r\nneighborhood and strengthened by many considerations of intimate\r\nintercourse and reciprocal interest, has never been more conspicuous\r\nthan now nor more hopeful of increased benefit to both nations. The\r\nintercourse of the two countries by rail, already great, is making\r\nconstant growth. The established lines and those recently projected add\r\nto the intimacy of traffic and open new channels of access to fresh\r\nareas of demand and supply. The importance of the Mexican railway system\r\nwill be further enhanced to a degree almost impossible to forecast if\r\nit should become a link in the projected intercontinental railway.\r\nI recommend that our mission in the City of Mexico be raised to the\r\nfirst class.\r\n\r\nThe cordial character of our relations with Spain warrants the hope\r\nthat by the continuance of methods of friendly negotiation much may be\r\naccomplished in the direction of an adjustment of pending questions and\r\nof the increase of our trade. The extent and development of our trade\r\nwith the island of Cuba invest the commercial relations of the United\r\nStates and Spain with a peculiar importance. It is not doubted that a\r\nspecial arrangement in regard to commerce, based upon the reciprocity\r\nprovision of the recent tariff act, would operate most beneficially for\r\nboth Governments. This subject is now receiving attention.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded a\r\ngratifying occasion to honor the memory of the great inventor, to whose\r\ngenius our country owes so much, and to bear witness to the unbroken\r\nfriendship which has existed between the land which bore him and our\r\nown, which claimed him as a citizen.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of September last the commission appointed to revise the\r\nproceedings of the commission under the claims convention between the\r\nUnited States and Venezuela of 1866 brought its labors to a close\r\nwithin the period fixed for that purpose. The proceedings of the late\r\ncommission were characterized by a spirit of impartiality and a high\r\nsense of justice, and an incident which was for many years the subject\r\nof discussion between the two Governments has been disposed of in\r\na manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both parties. For the\r\nsettlement of the claim of the Venezuela Steam Transportation Company,\r\nwhich was the subject of a joint resolution adopted at the last session\r\nof Congress, negotiations are still in progress, and their early\r\nconclusion is anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the past few years has evinced on the part of\r\nCongress a growing realization of the importance of the consular service\r\nin fostering our commercial relations abroad and in protecting the\r\ndomestic revenues. As the scope of operations expands increased\r\nprovision must be made to keep up the essential standard of efficiency.\r\nThe necessity of some adequate measure of supervision and inspection\r\nhas been so often presented that I need only commend the subject to\r\nyour attention.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Government from all sources for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1890, were $463,963,080.55 and the total expenditures\r\nfor the same period were $358,618,584.52. The postal receipts have not\r\nheretofore been included in the statement of these aggregates, and for\r\nthe purpose of comparison the sum of $60,882,097.92 should be deducted\r\nfrom both sides of the account. The surplus for the year, including the\r\namount applied to the sinking fund, was $105,344,496.03. The receipts\r\nfor 1890 were $16,030,923.79 and the expenditures $15,739,871 in excess\r\nof those of 1889. The customs receipts increased $5,835,842.88 and the\r\nreceipts from internal revenue $11,725,191.89, while on the side of\r\nexpenditures that for pensions was $19,312,075.96 in excess of the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury statement for the current fiscal year, partly actual\r\nand partly estimated, is as follows: Receipts from all sources,\r\n$406,000,000; total expenditures, $354,000,000, leaving a surplus of\r\n$52,000,000, not taking the postal receipts into the account on either\r\nside. The loss of revenue from customs for the last quarter is estimated\r\nat $25,000,000, but from this is deducted a gain of about $16,000,000\r\nrealized during the first four months of the year.\r\n\r\nFor the year 1892 the total estimated receipts are $373,000,000 and the\r\nestimated expenditures $357,852,209.42, leaving an estimated surplus\r\nof $15,147,790.58, which, with a cash balance of $52,000,000 at the\r\nbeginning of the year, will give $67,147,790.58 as the sum available\r\nfor the redemption of outstanding bonds or other uses. The estimates of\r\nreceipts and expenditures for the Post-Office Department, being equal,\r\nare not included in this statement on either side.\r\n\r\nThe act \"directing the purchase of silver bullion and the issue of\r\nTreasury notes thereon,\" approved July 14, 1890, has been administered\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury with an earnest purpose to get into\r\ncirculation at the earliest possible dates the full monthly amounts of\r\nTreasury notes contemplated by its provisions and at the same time to\r\ngive to the market for the silver bullion such support as the law\r\ncontemplates. The recent depreciation in the price of silver has been\r\nobserved with regret. The rapid rise in price which anticipated and\r\nfollowed the passage of the act was influenced in some degree by\r\nspeculation, and the recent reaction is in part the result of the same\r\ncause and in part of the recent monetary disturbances. Some months of\r\nfurther trial will be necessary to determine the permanent effect of the\r\nrecent legislation upon silver values, but it is gratifying to know that\r\nthe increased circulation secured by the act has exerted, and will\r\ncontinue to exert, a most beneficial influence upon business and upon\r\ngeneral values.\r\n\r\nWhile it has not been thought best to renew formally the suggestion of\r\nan international conference looking to an agreement touching the full\r\nuse of silver for coinage at a uniform ratio, care has been taken to\r\nobserve closely any change in the situation abroad, and no favorable\r\nopportunity will be lost to promote a result which it is confidently\r\nbelieved would confer very large benefits upon the commerce of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe recent monetary disturbances in England are not unlikely to suggest\r\na reexamination of opinions upon this subject. Our very large supply of\r\ngold will, if not lost by impulsive legislation in the supposed interest\r\nof silver, give us a position of advantage in promoting a permanent and\r\nsafe international agreement for the free use of silver as a coin metal.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Secretary to increase the volume of money in\r\ncirculation by keeping down the Treasury surplus to the lowest\r\npracticable limit have been unremitting and in a very high degree\r\nsuccessful. The tables presented by him showing the increase of money\r\nin circulation during the last two decades, and especially the table\r\nshowing the increase during the nineteen months he has administered the\r\naffairs of the Department, are interesting and instructive. The increase\r\nof money in circulation during the nineteen months has been in the\r\naggregate $93,866,813, or about $1.50 per capita, and of this increase\r\nonly $7,100,000 was due to the recent silver legislation. That this\r\nsubstantial and needed aid given to commerce resulted in an enormous\r\nreduction of the public debt and of the annual interest charge is matter\r\nof increased satisfaction. There have been purchased and redeemed since\r\nMarch 4, 1889, 4 and 4-1/2 per cent bonds to the amount of $211,832,450,\r\nat a cost of $246,620,741, resulting in the reduction of the annual\r\ninterest charge of $8,967,609 and a total saving of interest of\r\n$51,576,706.\r\n\r\nI notice with great pleasure the statement of the Secretary that the\r\nreceipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal\r\nyear nearly $12,000,000, and that the cost of collecting this larger\r\nrevenue was less by $90,617 than for the same purpose in the preceding\r\nyear. The percentage of cost of collecting the customs revenue was less\r\nfor the last fiscal year than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe Customs Administration Board, provided for by the act of June 10,\r\n1890, was selected with great care, and is composed in part of men whose\r\nprevious experience in the administration of the old customs regulations\r\nhad made them familiar with the evils to be remedied, and in part of men\r\nwhose legal and judicial acquirements and experience seemed to fit them\r\nfor the work of interpreting and applying the new statute. The chief aim\r\nof the law is to secure honest valuations of all dutiable merchandise\r\nand to make these valuations uniform at all our ports of entry. It had\r\nbeen made manifest by a Congressional investigation that a system of\r\nundervaluation had been long in use by certain classes of importers,\r\nresulting not only in a great loss of revenue, but in a most intolerable\r\ndiscrimination against honesty. It is not seen how this legislation,\r\nwhen it is understood, can be regarded by the citizens of any country\r\nhaving commercial dealings with us as unfriendly. If any duty is\r\nsupposed to be excessive, let the complaint be lodged there. It will\r\nsurely not be claimed by any well-disposed people that a remedy may be\r\nsought and allowed in a system of quasi smuggling.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War exhibits several gratifying results\r\nattained during the year by wise and unostentatious methods. The\r\npercentage of desertions from the Army (an evil for which both Congress\r\nand the Department have long been seeking a remedy) has been reduced\r\nduring the past year 24 per cent, and for the months of August and\r\nSeptember, during which time the favorable effects of the act of June 16\r\nwere felt, 33 per cent, as compared with the same months of 1889.\r\n\r\nThe results attained by a reorganization and consolidation of the\r\ndivisions having charge of the hospital and service records of the\r\nvolunteer soldiers are very remarkable. This change was effected in\r\nJuly, 1889, and at that time there were 40,654 cases awaiting attention,\r\nmore than half of these being calls from the Pension Office for\r\ninformation necessary to the adjudication of pension claims. On the 30th\r\nday of June last, though over 300,000 new calls had come in, there was\r\nnot a single case that had not been examined and answered.\r\n\r\nI concur in the recommendations of the Secretary that adequate and\r\nregular appropriations be continued for coast-defense works and\r\nordnance. Plans have been practically agreed upon, and there can be no\r\ngood reason for delaying the execution of them, while the defenseless\r\nstate of our great seaports furnishes an urgent reason for wise\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement that has been extended to the militia of the States,\r\ngenerally and most appropriately designated the \"National Guard,\" should\r\nbe continued and enlarged. These military organizations constitute in a\r\nlarge sense the Army of the United States, while about five-sixths of\r\nthe annual cost of their maintenance is defrayed by the States.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General is under the law submitted directly\r\nto Congress, but as the Department of Justice is one of the Executive\r\nDepartments some reference to the work done is appropriate here.\r\n\r\nA vigorous and in the main an effective effort has been made to bring to\r\ntrial and punishment all violators of the law, but at the same time care\r\nhas been taken that frivolous and technical offenses should not be used\r\nto swell the fees of officers or to harass well-disposed citizens.\r\nEspecial attention is called to the facts connected with the prosecution\r\nof violations of the election laws and of offenses against United States\r\nofficers. The number of convictions secured, very many of them upon\r\npleas of guilty, will, it is hoped, have a salutary restraining\r\ninfluence. There have been several cases where postmasters appointed by\r\nme have been subjected to violent interference in the discharge of their\r\nofficial duties and to persecutions and personal violence of the most\r\nextreme character. Some of these cases have been dealt with through the\r\nDepartment of Justice, and in some cases the post-offices have been\r\nabolished or suspended. I have directed the Postmaster-General to pursue\r\nthis course in all cases where other efforts failed to secure for any\r\npostmaster not himself in fault an opportunity peacefully to exercise\r\nthe duties of his office. But such action will not supplant the efforts\r\nof the Department of Justice to bring the particular offenders to\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nThe vacation by judicial decrees of fraudulent certificates of\r\nnaturalization, upon bills in equity filed by the Attorney-General\r\nin the circuit court of the United States, is a new application of a\r\nfamiliar equity jurisdiction. Nearly one hundred such decrees have been\r\ntaken during the year, the evidence disclosing that a very large number\r\nof fraudulent certificates of naturalization have been issued. And in\r\nthis connection I beg to renew my recommendation that the laws be so\r\namended as to require a more full and searching inquiry into all the\r\nfacts necessary to naturalization before any certificates are granted.\r\nIt certainly is not too much to require that an application for American\r\ncitizenship shall be heard with as much care and recorded with as much\r\nformality as are given to cases involving the pettiest property right.\r\n\r\nAt the last session I returned without my approval a bill entitled\r\n\"An act to prohibit bookmaking and pool selling in the District of\r\nColumbia,\" and stated my objection to be that it did not prohibit but in\r\nfact licensed what it purported to prohibit.[11] An effort will be made\r\nunder existing laws to suppress this evil, though it is not certain that\r\nthey will be found adequate.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows the most gratifying progress\r\nin the important work committed to his direction, The business methods\r\nhave been greatly improved. A large economy in expenditures and an\r\nincrease of four and three-quarters millions in receipts have been\r\nrealized. The deficiency this year is $5,786,300, as against $6,350,183\r\nlast year, notwithstanding the great enlargement of the service.\r\nMail routes have been extended and quickened and greater accuracy and\r\ndispatch in distribution and delivery have been attained. The report\r\nwill be found to be full of interest and suggestion, not only to\r\nCongress, but to those thoughtful citizens who may be interested\r\nto know what business methods can do for that department of public\r\nadministration which most nearly touches all our people.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the act to amend certain sections of the Revised Statutes\r\nrelating to lotteries, approved September 19, 1890, has been received\r\nwith great and deserved popular favor. The Post-Office Department and\r\nthe Department of Justice at once entered upon the enforcement of the\r\nlaw with sympathetic vigor, and already the public mails have been\r\nlargely freed from the fraudulent and demoralizing appeals and\r\nliterature emanating from the lottery companies.\r\n\r\nThe construction and equipment of the new ships for the Navy have made\r\nvery satisfactory progress. Since March 4, 1889, nine new vessels have\r\nbeen put in commission, and during this winter four more, including one\r\nmonitor, will be added. The construction of the other vessels authorized\r\nis being pushed both in the Government and private yards with energy and\r\nwatched with the most scrupulous care.\r\n\r\nThe experiments conducted during the year to test the relative\r\nresisting power of armor plates have been so valuable as to attract\r\ngreat attention in Europe. The only part of the work upon the new ships\r\nthat is threatened by unusual delay is the armor plating, and every\r\neffort is being made to reduce that to the minimum. It is a source of\r\ncongratulation that the anticipated influence of these modern vessels\r\nupon the _esprit de corps_ of the officers and seamen has been fully\r\nrealized. Confidence and pride in the ship among the crew are equivalent\r\nto a secondary battery. Your favorable consideration is invited to the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits with great fullness\r\nand clearness the vast work of that Department and the satisfactory\r\nresults attained. The suggestions made by him are earnestly commended,\r\nto the consideration of Congress, though they can not all be given\r\nparticular mention here.\r\n\r\nThe several acts of Congress looking to the reduction of the larger\r\nIndian reservations, to the more rapid settlement of the Indians upon\r\nindividual allotments, and the restoration to the public domain of lands\r\nin excess of their needs have been largely carried into effect so far as\r\nthe work was confided to the Executive. Agreements have been concluded\r\nsince March 4, 1889, involving the cession to the United States of about\r\n14,726,000 acres of land. These contracts have, as required by law,\r\nbeen submitted to Congress for ratification and for the appropriations\r\nnecessary to carry them into effect. Those with the Sisseton and\r\nWahpeton, Sac and Fox, Iowa, Pottawatomies and Absentee Shawnees, and\r\nCoeur d'Alene tribes have not yet received the sanction of Congress.\r\nAttention is also called to the fact that the appropriations made in the\r\ncase of the Sioux Indians have not covered all the stipulated payments.\r\nThis should be promptly corrected. If an agreement is confirmed, all of\r\nits terms should be complied with without delay and full appropriations\r\nshould be made.\r\n\r\nThe policy outlined in my last annual message in relation to the\r\npatenting of lands to settlers upon the public domain[12] has been\r\ncarried out in the administration of the Land Office. No general\r\nsuspicion or imputation of fraud has been allowed to delay the hearing\r\nand adjudication of individual cases upon their merits. The purpose has\r\nbeen to perfect the title of honest settlers with such promptness that\r\nthe value of the entry might not be swallowed up by the expense and\r\nextortions to which delay subjected the claimant. The average monthly\r\nissue of agricultural patents has been increased about 6,000.\r\n\r\nThe disability-pension act, which was approved on the 27th of June last,\r\nhas been put into operation as rapidly as was practicable. The increased\r\nclerical force provided was selected and assigned to work, and a\r\nconsiderable part of the force engaged in examinations in the field was\r\nrecalled and added to the working force of the office. The examination\r\nand adjudication of claims have by reason of improved methods been more\r\nrapid than ever before. There is no economy to the Government in delay,\r\nwhile there is much hardship and injustice to the soldier. The\r\nanticipated expenditure, while very large, will not, it is believed, be\r\nin excess of the estimates made before the enactment of the law. This\r\nliberal enlargement of the general law should suggest a more careful\r\nscrutiny of bills for special relief, both as to the cases where relief\r\nis granted and as to the amount allowed.\r\n\r\nThe increasing numbers and influence of the non-Mormon population of\r\nUtah are observed with satisfaction. The recent letter of Wilford\r\nWoodruff, president of the Mormon Church, in which he advised his people\r\n\"to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the laws of the\r\nland,\" has attracted wide attention, and it is hoped that its influence\r\nwill be highly beneficial in restraining infractions of the laws of the\r\nUnited States. But the fact should not be overlooked that the doctrine\r\nor belief of the church that polygamous marriages are rightful and\r\nsupported by divine revelation remains unchanged. President Woodruff\r\ndoes not renounce the doctrine, but refrains from teaching it, and\r\nadvises against the practice of it because the law is against it. Now,\r\nit is quite true that the law should not attempt to deal with the faith\r\nor belief of anyone; but it is quite another thing, and the only safe\r\nthing, so to deal with the Territory of Utah as that those who believe\r\npolygamy to be rightful shall not have the power to make it lawful.\r\n\r\nThe admission of the States of Wyoming and Idaho to the Union are events\r\nfull of interest and congratulation, not only to the people of those\r\nStates now happily endowed with a full participation in our privileges\r\nand responsibilities, but to all our people. Another belt of States\r\nstretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Patent Office has won from all sources very high\r\ncommendation. The amount accomplished has been very largely increased,\r\nand all the results have been such as to secure confidence and\r\nconsideration for the suggestions of the Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of the people of the United States under the provisions\r\nof the act of March 1, 1889, has been completed, and the result will\r\nbe at once officially communicated to Congress. The completion of this\r\ndecennial enumeration devolves upon Congress the duty of making a new\r\napportionment of Representatives \"among the several States according to\r\ntheir respective numbers.\"\r\n\r\nAt the last session I had occasion to return with my objections several\r\nbills making provisions for the erection of public buildings for the\r\nreason that the expenditures contemplated were, in my opinion, greatly\r\nin excess of any public need. No class of legislation is more liable\r\nto abuse or to degenerate into an unseemly scramble about the public\r\nTreasury than this. There should be exercised in this matter a wise\r\neconomy, based upon some responsible and impartial examination and\r\nreport as to each case, under a general law.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of Agriculture deserves especial attention\r\nin view of the fact that the year has been marked in a very unusual\r\ndegree by agitation and organization among the farmers looking to an\r\nincrease in the profits of their business. It will be found that the\r\nefforts of the Department have been intelligently and zealously devoted\r\nto the promotion of the interests intrusted to its care.\r\n\r\nA very substantial improvement in the market prices of the leading farm\r\nproducts during the year is noticed. The price of wheat advanced from\r\n81 cents in October, 1889, to $1.00-3/4 in October, 1890; corn from 31\r\ncents to 50-1/4 cents; oats from 19-1/4 cents to 43 cents, and barley\r\nfrom 63 cents to 78 cents. Meats showed a substantial but not so large\r\nan increase. The export trade in live animals and fowls shows a very\r\nlarge increase. The total value of such exports for the year ending June\r\n30, 1890, was $33,000,000, and the increase over the preceding year was\r\nover $15,000,000. Nearly 200,000 more cattle and over 45,000 more hogs\r\nwere exported than in the preceding year. The export trade in beef and\r\npork products and in dairy products was very largely increased, the\r\nincrease in the article of butter alone being from 15,504,978 pounds to\r\n29,748,042 pounds, and the total increase in the value of meat and dairy\r\nproducts exported being $34,000,000. This trade, so directly helpful\r\nto the farmer, it is believed, will be yet further and very largely\r\nincreased when the system of inspection and sanitary supervision now\r\nprovided by law is brought fully into operation.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Secretary to establish the healthfulness of our meats\r\nagainst the disparaging imputations that have been put upon them abroad\r\nhave resulted in substantial progress. Veterinary surgeons sent out by\r\nthe Department are now allowed to participate in the inspection of the\r\nlive cattle from this country landed at the English docks, and during\r\nthe several months they have been on duty no case of contagious\r\npleuro-pneumonia has been reported. This inspection abroad and the\r\ndomestic inspection of live animals and pork products provided for by\r\nthe act of August 30, 1890, will afford as perfect a guaranty for the\r\nwholesomeness of our meats offered for foreign consumption as is\r\nanywhere given to any food product, and its nonacceptance will quite\r\nclearly reveal the real motive of any continued restriction of their\r\nuse, and that having been made clear the duty of the Executive will be\r\nvery plain.\r\n\r\nThe information given by the Secretary of the progress and prospects of\r\nthe beet-sugar industry is full of interest. It has already passed the\r\nexperimental stage and is a commercial success. The area over which the\r\nsugar beet can be successfully cultivated is very large, and another\r\nfield crop of great value is offered to the choice of the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury concurs in the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture that the official supervision provided by the\r\ntariff law for sugar of domestic production shall be transferred to the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe law relating to the civil service has, so far as I can learn, been\r\nexecuted by those having the power of appointment in the classified\r\nservice with fidelity and impartiality, and the service has been\r\nincreasingly satisfactory. The report of the Commission shows a large\r\namount of good work done during the year with very limited\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\nI congratulate the Congress and the country upon the passage at the\r\nfirst session of the Fifty-first Congress of an unusual number of laws\r\nof very high importance. That the results of this legislation will be\r\nthe quickening and enlargement of our manufacturing industries, larger\r\nand better markets for our breadstuffs and provisions both at home and\r\nabroad, more constant employment and better wages for our working\r\npeople, and an increased supply of a safe currency for the transaction\r\nof business, I do not doubt. Some of these measures were enacted at so\r\nlate a period that the beneficial effects upon commerce which were in\r\nthe contemplation of Congress have as yet but partially manifested\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe general trade and industrial conditions throughout the country\r\nduring the year have shown a marked improvement. For many years prior to\r\n1888 the merchandise balances of foreign trade had been largely in our\r\nfavor, but during that year and the year following they turned against\r\nus. It is very gratifying to know that the last fiscal year again shows\r\na balance in our favor of over $68,000,000. The bank clearings, which\r\nfurnish a good test of the volume of business transacted, for the first\r\nten months of the year 1890 show as compared with the same months of\r\n1889 an increase for the whole country of about 8.4 per cent, while the\r\nincrease outside of the city of New York was over 13 per cent. During\r\nthe month of October the clearings of the whole country showed an\r\nincrease of 3.1 per cent over October, 1889, while outside of New York\r\nthe increase was 11.5 per cent. These figures show that the increase in\r\nthe volume of business was very general throughout the country. That\r\nthis larger business was being conducted upon a safe and profitable\r\nbasis is shown by the fact that there were 300 less failures reported\r\nin October, 1890, than in the same month of the preceding year, with\r\nliabilities diminished by about $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe value of our exports of domestic merchandise during the last year\r\nwas over $115,000,000 greater than the preceding year, and was only\r\nexceeded once in our history. About $100,000,000 of this excess was in\r\nagricultural products. The production of pig iron, always a good gauge\r\nof general prosperity, is shown by a recent census bulletin to have been\r\n153 per cent greater in 1890 than in 1880, and the production of steel\r\n290 per cent greater. Mining in coal has had no limitation except that\r\nresulting from deficient transportation. The general testimony is that\r\nlabor is everywhere fully employed, and the reports for the last year\r\nshow a smaller number of employees affected by strikes and lockouts than\r\nin any year since 1884. The depression in the prices of agricultural\r\nproducts had been greatly relieved and a buoyant and hopeful tone was\r\nbeginning to be felt by all our people.\r\n\r\nThese promising influences have been in some degree checked by the\r\nsurprising and very unfavorable monetary events which have recently\r\ntaken place in England. It is gratifying to know that these did not grow\r\nin any degree out of the financial relations of London with our people\r\nor out of any discredit attached to our securities held in that market.\r\nThe return of our bonds and stocks was caused by a money stringency\r\nin England, not by any loss of value or credit in the securities\r\nthemselves. We could not, however, wholly escape the ill effects of a\r\nforeign monetary agitation accompanied by such extraordinary incidents\r\nas characterized this. It is not believed, however, that these evil\r\nincidents, which have for the time unfavorably affected values in this\r\ncountry, can long withstand the strong, safe, and wholesome influences\r\nwhich are operating to give to our people profitable returns in all\r\nbranches of legitimate trade and industry. The apprehension that our\r\ntariff may again and at once be subjected to important general changes\r\nwould undoubtedly add a depressing influence of the most serious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe general tariff act has only partially gone into operation, some of\r\nits important provisions being limited to take effect at dates yet in\r\nthe future. The general provisions of the law have been in force less\r\nthan sixty days. Its permanent effects upon trade and prices still\r\nlargely stand in conjecture. It is curious to note that the advance in\r\nthe prices of articles wholly unaffected by the tariff act was by many\r\nhastily ascribed to that act. Notice was not taken of the fact that the\r\ngeneral tendency of the markets was upward, from influences wholly apart\r\nfrom the recent tariff legislation. The enlargement of our currency by\r\nthe silver bill undoubtedly gave an upward tendency to trade and had\r\na marked effect on prices; but this natural and desired effect of the\r\nsilver legislation was by many erroneously attributed to the tariff act.\r\n\r\nThere is neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject\r\nof tariff revision shall be again opened before this law has had a\r\nfair trial. It is quite true that every tariff schedule is subject to\r\nobjections. No bill was ever framed, I suppose, that in all of its rates\r\nand classifications had the full approval even of a party caucus. Such\r\nlegislation is always and necessarily the product of compromise as to\r\ndetails, and the present law is no exception. But in its general scope\r\nand effect I think it will justify the support of those who believe that\r\nAmerican legislation should conserve and defend American trade and the\r\nwages of American workmen.\r\n\r\nThe misinformation as to the terms of the act which has been so widely\r\ndisseminated at home and abroad will be corrected by experience, and the\r\nevil auguries as to its results confounded by the market reports, the\r\nsavings banks, international trade balances, and the general prosperity\r\nof our people. Already we begin to hear from abroad and from our\r\ncustom-houses that the prohibitory effect upon importations imputed to\r\nthe act is not justified. The imports at the port of New York for the\r\nfirst three weeks of November were nearly 8 per cent greater than for\r\nthe same period in 1889 and 29 per cent greater than in the same period\r\nof 1888. And so far from being an act to limit exports, I confidently\r\nbelieve that under it we shall secure a larger and more profitable\r\nparticipation in foreign trade than we have ever enjoyed, and that we\r\nshall recover a proportionate participation in the ocean carrying trade\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe criticisms of the bill that have come to us from foreign sources\r\nmay well be rejected for repugnancy. If these critics really believe\r\nthat the adoption by us of a free-trade policy, or of tariff rates\r\nhaving reference solely to revenue, would diminish the participation\r\nof their own countries in the commerce of the world, their advocacy\r\nand promotion, by speech and other forms of organized effort, of this\r\nmovement among our people is a rare exhibition of unselfishness in\r\ntrade. And, on the other hand, if they sincerely believe that the\r\nadoption of a protective-tariff policy by this country inures to their\r\nprofit and our hurt, it is noticeably strange that they should lead the\r\noutcry against the authors of a policy so helpful to their countrymen\r\nand crown with their favor those who would snatch from them a\r\nsubstantial share of a trade with other lands already inadequate to\r\ntheir necessities.\r\n\r\nThere is no disposition among any of our people to promote prohibitory\r\nor retaliatory legislation. Our policies are adopted not to the hurt of\r\nothers, but to secure for ourselves those advantages that fairly grow\r\nout of our favored position as a nation. Our form of government, with\r\nits incident of universal suffrage, makes it imperative that we shall\r\nsave our working people from the agitations and distresses which scant\r\nwork and wages that have no margin for comfort always beget. But after\r\nall this is done it will be found that our markets are open to friendly\r\ncommercial exchanges of enormous value to the other great powers.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of my induction into office the duty of using every\r\npower and influence given by law to the executive department for the\r\ndevelopment of larger markets for our products, especially our farm\r\nproducts, has been kept constantly in mind, and no effort has been or\r\nwill be spared to promote that end. We are under no disadvantage in any\r\nforeign market, except that we pay our workmen and workwomen better\r\nwages than are paid elsewhere--better abstractly, better relatively to\r\nthe cost of the necessaries of life. I do not doubt that a very largely\r\nincreased foreign trade is accessible to us without bartering for it\r\neither our home market for such products of the farm and shop as our own\r\npeople can supply or the wages of our working people.\r\n\r\nIn many of the products of wood and iron and in meats and bread-stuffs\r\nwe have advantages that only need better facilities of intercourse and\r\ntransportation to secure for them large foreign markets. The reciprocity\r\nclause of the tariff act wisely and effectively opens the way to secure\r\na large reciprocal trade in exchange for the free admission to our ports\r\nof certain products. The right of independent nations to make special\r\nreciprocal trade concessions is well established, and does not\r\nimpair either the comity due to other powers or what is known as the\r\n\"favored-nation clause,\" so generally found in commercial treaties. What\r\nis given to one for an adequate agreed consideration can not be claimed\r\nby another freely. The state of the revenues was such that we could\r\ndispense with any import duties upon coffee, tea, hides, and the lower\r\ngrades of sugar and molasses. That the large advantage resulting to the\r\ncountries producing and exporting these articles by placing them on the\r\nfree list entitled us to expect a fair return in the way of customs\r\nconcessions upon articles exported by us to them was so obvious that to\r\nhave gratuitously abandoned this opportunity to enlarge our trade would\r\nhave been an unpardonable error.\r\n\r\nThere were but two methods of maintaining control of this question open\r\nto Congress--to place all of these articles upon the dutiable list,\r\nsubject to such treaty agreements as could be secured, or to place them\r\nall presently upon the free list, but subject to the reimposition of\r\nspecified duties if the countries from which we received them should\r\nrefuse to give to us suitable reciprocal benefits. This latter method,\r\nI think, possesses great advantages. It expresses in advance the consent\r\nof Congress to reciprocity arrangements affecting these products, which\r\nmust otherwise have been delayed and unascertained until each treaty\r\nwas ratified by the Senate and the necessary legislation enacted by\r\nCongress. Experience has shown that some treaties looking to reciprocal\r\ntrade have failed to secure a two-thirds vote in the Senate for\r\nratification, and others having passed that stage have for years awaited\r\nthe concurrence of the House and Senate in such modifications of our\r\nrevenue laws as were necessary to give effect to their provisions. We\r\nnow have the concurrence of both Houses in advance in a distinct and\r\ndefinite offer of free entry to our ports of specific articles. The\r\nExecutive is not required to deal in conjecture as to what Congress will\r\naccept. Indeed, this reciprocity provision is more than an offer. Our\r\npart of the bargain is complete; delivery has been made; and when the\r\ncountries from which we receive sugar, coffee, tea, and hides have\r\nplaced on their free lists such of our products as shall be agreed\r\nupon as an equivalent for our concession, a proclamation of that fact\r\ncompletes the transaction; and in the meantime our own people have\r\nfree sugar, tea, coffee, and hides.\r\n\r\nThe indications thus far given are very hopeful of early and\r\nfavorable action by the countries from which we receive our large\r\nimports of coffee and sugar, and it is confidently believed that if\r\nsteam communication with these countries can be promptly improved and\r\nenlarged the next year will show a most gratifying increase in our\r\nexports of breadstuffs provisions, as well as of some important lines\r\nof manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the important bills that became laws before the\r\nadjournment of the last session, some other bills of the highest\r\nimportance were well advanced toward a final vote and now stand upon the\r\ncalendars of the two Houses in favored positions. The present session\r\nhas a fixed limit, and if these measures are not now brought to a final\r\nvote all the work that has been done upon them by this Congress is lost.\r\nThe proper consideration of these, of an apportionment bill, and of the\r\nannual appropriation bills will require not only that no working day of\r\nthe session shall be lost, but that measures of minor and local interest\r\nshall not be allowed to interrupt or retard the progress of those that\r\nare of universal interest. In view of these conditions, I refrain from\r\nbringing before you at this time some suggestions that would otherwise\r\nbe made, and most earnestly invoke your attention to the duty of\r\nperfecting the important legislation now well advanced. To some of these\r\nmeasures, which seem to me most important, I now briefly call your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI desire to repeat with added urgency the recommendations contained\r\nin my last annual message in relation to the development of American\r\nsteamship lines.[13] The reciprocity clause of the tariff bill will be\r\nlargely limited and its benefits retarded and diminished if provision is\r\nnot contemporaneously made to encourage the establishment of first-class\r\nsteam communication between our ports and the ports of such nations as\r\nmay meet our overtures for enlarged commercial exchanges. The steamship,\r\ncarrying the mails statedly and frequently and offering to passengers a\r\ncomfortable, safe, and speedy transit, is the first condition of foreign\r\ntrade. It carries the order or the buyer, but not all that is ordered or\r\nbought. It gives to the sailing vessels such cargoes as are not urgent\r\nor perishable, and, indirectly at least, promotes that important adjunct\r\nof commerce. There is now both in this country and in the nations of\r\nCentral and South America a state of expectation and confidence as to\r\nincreased trade that will give a double value to your prompt action upon\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nThe present situation of our mail communication with Australia\r\nillustrates the importance of early action by Congress. The Oceanic\r\nSteamship Company maintains a line of steamers between San Francisco,\r\nSydney, and Auckland consisting of three vessels, two of which are of\r\nUnited States registry and one of foreign registry. For the service done\r\nby this line in carrying the mails we pay annually the sum of $46,000,\r\nbeing, as estimated, the full sea and United States inland postage,\r\nwhich is the limit fixed by law. The colonies of New South Wales and New\r\nZealand have been paying annually to these lines £37,000 for carrying\r\nthe mails from Sydney and Auckland to San Francisco. The contract under\r\nwhich this payment has been made is now about to expire, and those\r\ncolonies have refused to renew the contract unless the United States\r\nshall pay a more equitable proportion of the whole sum necessary to\r\nmaintain, the service.\r\n\r\nI am advised by the Postmaster-General that the United States receives\r\nfor carrying the Australian mails, brought to San Francisco in these\r\nsteamers, by rail to Vancouver, an estimated annual income of $75,000.\r\nwhile, as I have stated, we are paying out for the support of the\r\nsteamship line that brings this mail to us only $46,000, leaving an\r\nannual surplus resulting from this service of $29,000. The trade of the\r\nUnited States with Australia, which is in a considerable part carried by\r\nthese steamers, and the whole of which is practically dependent upon the\r\nmail communication which they maintain, is largely in our favor. Our\r\ntotal exports of merchandise to Australasian ports during the fiscal\r\nyear ending June 30, 1890, were $11,266,484, while the total imports of\r\nmerchandise from these ports were only $4,277,676. If we are not willing\r\nto see this important steamship line withdrawn, or continued with\r\nVancouver substituted for San Francisco as the American terminal,\r\nCongress should put it in the power of the Postmaster-General to make a\r\nliberal increase in the amount now paid for the transportation of this\r\nimportant mail.\r\n\r\nThe South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy a very favored position toward\r\nthe new and important commerce which the reciprocity clause of the\r\ntariff act and the postal shipping bill are designed to promote.\r\nSteamship lines from these ports to some northern port of South America\r\nwill almost certainly effect a connection between the railroad systems\r\nof the continents long before any continuous line of railroads can be\r\nput into operation. The very large appropriation made at the last\r\nsession for the harbor of Galveston was justified, as it seemed to me,\r\nby these considerations. The great Northwest will feel the advantage of\r\ntrunk lines to the South as well as to the East and of the new markets\r\nopened for their surplus food products and for many of their\r\nmanufactured products.\r\n\r\nI had occasion in May last to transmit to Congress a report adopted\r\nby the International American Conference upon the subject of the\r\nincorporation of an international American bank, with a view to\r\nfacilitating money exchanges between the States represented in that\r\nconference.[14] Such an institution would greatly promote the trade we\r\nare seeking to develop. I renew the recommendation that a careful and\r\nwell-guarded charter be granted. I do not think the powers granted\r\nshould include those ordinarily exercised by trust, guaranty, and\r\nsafe-deposit companies, or that more branches in the United States\r\nshould be authorized than are strictly necessary to accomplish the\r\nobject primarily in view, namely, convenient foreign exchanges. It is\r\nquite important that prompt action should be taken in this matter,\r\nin order that any appropriations for better communication with these\r\ncountries and any agreements that may be made for reciprocal trade\r\nmay not be hindered by the inconvenience of making exchanges through\r\nEuropean money centers or burdened by the tribute which is an incident\r\nof that method of business.\r\n\r\nThe bill for the relief of the Supreme Court has after many years of\r\ndiscussion reached a position where final action is easily attainable,\r\nand it is hoped that any differences of opinion may be so harmonized as\r\nto save the essential features of this very important measure. In this\r\nconnection I earnestly renew my recommendation that the salaries of the\r\njudges of the United States district courts be so readjusted that none\r\nof them shall receive less than $5,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the unadjusted Spanish and Mexican land grants and the\r\nurgent necessity for providing some commission or tribunal for the trial\r\nof questions of title growing out of them were twice brought by me to\r\nthe attention of Congress at the last session. Bills have been reported\r\nfrom the proper committees in both Houses upon the subject, and I very\r\nearnestly hope that this Congress will put an end to the delay which\r\nhas attended the settlement of the disputes as to the title between the\r\nsettlers and the claimants under these grants. These disputes retard the\r\nprosperity and disturb the peace of large and important communities.\r\nThe governor of New Mexico in his last report to the Secretary of the\r\nInterior suggests some modifications of the provisions of the pending\r\nbills relating to the small holdings of farm lands. I commend to your\r\nattention the suggestions of the Secretary of the Interior upon this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of a national bankrupt law I still regard as very\r\ndesirable. The Constitution having given to Congress jurisdiction of\r\nthis subject, it should be exercised and uniform rules provided for the\r\nadministration of the affairs of insolvent debtors. The inconveniences\r\nresulting from the occasional and temporary exercise of this power by\r\nCongress and from the conflicting State codes of insolvency which come\r\ninto force intermediately should be removed by the enactment of a\r\nsimple, inexpensive, and permanent national bankrupt law.\r\n\r\nI also renew my recommendation in favor of legislation affording just\r\ncopyright protection to foreign authors on a footing of reciprocal\r\nadvantage for our authors abroad.\r\n\r\nIt may still be possible for this Congress to inaugurate by suitable\r\nlegislation a movement looking to uniformity and increased safety in the\r\nuse of couplers and brakes upon freight trains engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce. The chief difficulty in the way is to secure agreement\r\nas to the best appliances, simplicity, effectiveness, and cost being\r\nconsidered. This difficulty will only yield to legislation, which should\r\nbe based upon full inquiry and impartial tests. The purpose should be to\r\nsecure the cooperation of all well-disposed managers and owners; but the\r\nfearful fact that every year's delay involves the sacrifice of 2,000\r\nlives and the maiming of 20,000 young men should plead both with\r\nCongress and the managers against any needless delay.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the conservation and equal distribution of the water\r\nsupply of the arid regions has had much attention from Congress, but has\r\nnot as yet been put upon a permanent and satisfactory basis. The urgency\r\nof the subject does not grow out of any large present demand for the use\r\nof these lands for agriculture, but out of the danger that the water\r\nsupply and the sites for the necessary catch basins may fall into the\r\nhands of individuals or private corporations and be used to render\r\nsubservient the large areas dependent upon such supply. The owner of\r\nthe water is the owner of the lands, however the titles may run. All\r\nunappropriated natural water sources and all necessary reservoir sites\r\nshould be held by the Government for the equal use at fair rates of the\r\nhomestead settlers who will eventually take up these lands. The United\r\nStates should not, in my opinion, undertake the construction of dams or\r\ncanals, but should limit its work to such surveys and observations as\r\nwill determine the water supply, both surface and subterranean, the\r\nareas capable of irrigation, and the location and storage capacity\r\nof reservoirs. This done, the use of the water and of the reservoir\r\nsites might be granted to the respective States or Territories or to\r\nindividuals or associations upon the condition that the necessary\r\nworks should be constructed and the water furnished at fair rates\r\nwithout discrimination, the rates to be subject to supervision by the\r\nlegislatures or by boards of water commissioners duly constituted. The\r\nessential thing to be secured is the common and equal use at fair rates\r\nof the accumulated water supply. It were almost better that these lands\r\nshould remain arid than that those who occupy them should become the\r\nslaves of unrestrained monopolies controlling the one essential element\r\nof land values and crop results.\r\n\r\nThe use of the telegraph by the Post-Office Department as a means for\r\nthe rapid transmission of written communications is, I believe, upon\r\nproper terms, quite desirable. The Government does not own or operate\r\nthe railroads, and it should not, I think, own or operate the telegraph\r\nlines. It does, however, seem to be quite practicable for the Government\r\nto contract with the telegraph companies, as it does with railroad\r\ncompanies, to carry at specified rates such communications as the\r\nsenders may designate for this method of transmission. I recommend that\r\nsuch legislation be enacted as will enable the Post-Office Department\r\nfairly to test by experiment the advantages of such a use of the\r\ntelegraph.\r\n\r\nIf any intelligent, and loyal company of American citizens were required\r\nto catalogue the essential human conditions of national life, I do not\r\ndoubt that with absolute unanimity they would begin with \"free and\r\nhonest elections.\" And it is gratifying to know that generally there is\r\na growing and nonpartisan demand for better election laws; but against\r\nthis sign of hope and progress must be set the depressing and undeniable\r\nfact that election laws and methods are sometimes cunningly contrived to\r\nsecure minority control, while violence completes the shortcomings of\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I suggested that the development of the\r\nexisting law providing a Federal supervision of Congressional elections\r\noffered an effective method of reforming these abuses.[15] The need\r\nof such a law has manifested itself in many parts of the country, and\r\nits wholesome restraints and penalties will be useful in all. The\r\nconstitutionality of such legislation has been affirmed by the Supreme\r\nCourt. Its probable effectiveness is evidenced by the character of the\r\nopposition that is made to it. It has been denounced as if it were a\r\nnew exercise of Federal power and an invasion of the rights of States.\r\nNothing could be further from the truth. Congress has already fixed the\r\ntime for the election of members of Congress. It has declared that votes\r\nfor members of Congress must be by written or printed ballot; it has\r\nprovided for the appointment by the circuit courts in certain cases,\r\nand upon the petition of a certain number of citizens, of election\r\nsupervisors, and made it their duty to supervise the registration of\r\nvoters conducted by the State officers; to challenge persons offering to\r\nregister; to personally inspect and scrutinize the registry lists, and\r\nto affix their names to the lists for the purpose of identification and\r\nthe prevention of frauds; to attend at elections and remain with the\r\nboxes till they are all cast and counted; to attach to the registry\r\nlists and election returns any statement touching the accuracy and\r\nfairness of the registry and election, and to take and transmit to\r\nthe Clerk of the House of Representatives any evidence of fraudulent\r\npractices which may be presented to them. The same law provides for the\r\nappointment of deputy United States marshals to attend at the polls,\r\nsupport the supervisors in the discharge of their duties, and to arrest\r\npersons violating the election laws. The provisions of this familiar\r\ntitle of the Revised Statutes have been put into exercise by both the\r\ngreat political parties, and in the North as well as in the South,\r\nby the filing with the court of the petitions required by the law.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, a question whether we shall have a Federal\r\nelection law, for we now have one and have had for nearly twenty years,\r\nbut whether we shall have an effective law. The present law stops just\r\nshort of effectiveness, for it surrenders to the local authorities all\r\ncontrol over the certification which establishes the _prima facie_ right\r\nto a seat in the House of Representatives. This defect should be cured.\r\nEquality of representation and the parity of the electors must be\r\nmaintained or everything that is valuable in our system of government is\r\nlost. The qualifications of an elector must be sought in the law, not\r\nin the opinions, prejudices, or fears of any class, however powerful.\r\nThe path of the elector to the ballot box must be free from the ambush\r\nof fear and the enticements of fraud; the count so true and open that\r\nnone shall gainsay it. Such a law should be absolutely nonpartisan and\r\nimpartial. It should give the advantage to honesty and the control to\r\nmajorities. Surely there is nothing sectional about this creed, and if\r\nit shall happen that the penalties of laws intended to enforce these\r\nrights fall here and not there it is not because the law is sectional,\r\nbut because, happily, crime is local and not universal. Nor should it be\r\nforgotten that every law, whether relating to elections or to any other\r\nsubject, whether enacted by the State or by the nation, has force behind\r\nit; the courts, the marshal or constable, the _posse comitatus_, the\r\nprison, are all and always behind the law.\r\n\r\nOne can not be justly charged with unfriendliness to any section or\r\nclass who seeks only to restrain violations of law and of personal\r\nright. No community will find lawlessness profitable. No community can\r\nafford to have it known that the officers who are charged with the\r\npreservation of the public peace and the restraint of the criminal\r\nclasses are themselves the product of fraud or violence. The magistrate\r\nis then without respect and the law without sanction. The floods of\r\nlawlessness can not be leveed and made to run in one channel. The\r\nkilling of a United States marshal carrying a writ of arrest for an\r\nelection offense is full of prompting and suggestion to men who are\r\npursued by a city marshal for a crime against life or property.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that this legislation will revive race animosities, and\r\nsome have even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are\r\nmade impossible they may be supplanted by intimidation and violence.\r\nIf the proposed law gives to any qualified elector by a hair's weight\r\nmore than his equal influence or detracts by so much from any other\r\nqualified elector, it is fatally impeached. But if the law is equal and\r\nthe animosities it is to evoke grow out of the fact that some electors\r\nhave been accustomed to exercise the franchise for others as well\r\nas for themselves, then these animosities ought not to be confessed\r\nwithout shame, and can not be given any weight in the discussion without\r\ndishonor. No choice is left to me but to enforce with vigor all laws\r\nintended to secure to the citizen his constitutional rights and to\r\nrecommend that the inadequacies of such laws be promptly remedied. If to\r\npromote with zeal and ready interest every project for the development\r\nof its material interests, its rivers, harbors, mines, and factories,\r\nand the intelligence, peace, and security under the law of its\r\ncommunities and its homes is not accepted as sufficient evidence of\r\nfriendliness to any State or section, I can not add connivance at\r\nelection practices that not only disturb local results, but rob the\r\nelectors of other States and sections of their most priceless political\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the general appropriation bills should be conducted\r\nwith the greatest care and the closest scrutiny of expenditures.\r\nAppropriations should be adequate to the needs of the public service,\r\nbut they should be absolutely free from prodigality.\r\n\r\nI venture again to remind you that the brief time remaining for the\r\nconsideration of the important legislation now awaiting your attention\r\noffers no margin for waste. If the present duty is discharged with\r\ndiligence, fidelity, and courage, the work of the Fifty-first Congress\r\nmay be confidently submitted to the considerate judgment of the people.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 26, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter of the Secretary of the Interior,\r\naccompanied by a letter from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who\r\ntransmits a draft of a bill for compensating the Indians of the Crow\r\nCreek Reservation for the loss sustained by them by reason of their\r\nreceiving less land per capita in their diminished reservations than is\r\nto be received by Indians occupying other diminished reservations.\r\n\r\nThe matter is presented for the early consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 31, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of the Hon. William Windom, Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nin New York, on the evening of the 29th instant, has directed my\r\nattention to the present state of the law as to the filling of a vacancy\r\noccasioned by the death of the head of a Department.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith an opinion of the Attorney-General, from which\r\nit will be seen that under the statutes in force no officer in the\r\nTreasury Department or other person designated by me can exercise the\r\nduties of Secretary of the Treasury for a longer period than ten days.\r\nThis limitation is, I am sure, unwise, and necessarily involves in\r\nsuch a case as that now presented undue haste and even indelicacy.\r\nThe President should not be required to take up the question of the\r\nselection of a successor before the last offices of affection and\r\nrespect have been paid to the dead. If the proprieties of an occasion as\r\nsad as that which now overshadows us are observed, possibly one-half of\r\nthe brief time allowed is gone before, with due regard to the decencies\r\nof life, the President and those with whom he should advise can take up\r\nthe consideration of the grave duty of selecting a head for one of the\r\ngreatest Departments of the Government.\r\n\r\nHasty action by the Senate is also necessarily involved, and\r\ngeographical limitations are practically imposed by the necessity of\r\nselecting some one who can reach the capital and take the necessary oath\r\nof office before the expiration of the ten days.\r\n\r\nIt may be a very proper restriction of the power of the President in\r\nthis connection that he shall not designate for any great length of time\r\na person to discharge these important duties who has not been confirmed\r\nby the Senate, but there would seem to be no reason why one of the\r\nassistant secretaries of the Department wherein the vacancy exists might\r\nnot discharge the duties of Secretary until a successor is selected,\r\nconfirmed, and qualified. The inconvenience of this limitation was made\r\napparent at the time of the death of Secretary Folger. President Arthur\r\nin that case allowed one of the assistant secretaries, who had been\r\ndesignated to act in the absence of the Secretary, to continue in the\r\ndischarge of such duties for ten days, then designated the same person\r\nto discharge the duties for a further term of ten days, and then made a\r\ntemporary appointment as Secretary, in order to secure the consideration\r\nthat he needed in filling this important place.\r\n\r\nI recommend such a modification of the existing law as will permit the\r\nfirst or sole assistant, or, in the case of the Treasury Department,\r\nwhere the assistants are not graded, that one who may be designated by\r\nthe President, to discharge the duties of the head of the Department\r\nuntil a successor is appointed and qualified.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 10, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the correspondence called for by the resolution of\r\nthe Senate of the 6th instant, relating to the conduct of Commander\r\nReiter in connection with the arrest and killing of General Barrundia.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 13, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Admiral of the Navy, David Dixon Porter, died at his residence\r\nin the city of Washington this morning at 8.15 o'clock, in the\r\nseventy-eighth year of his age. He entered the naval service as a\r\nmidshipman February 2, 1829, and had been since continuously in service,\r\nhaving been made Admiral August 15, 1870. He was the son of Commodore\r\nDavid Porter, one of the greatest of our naval commanders. His service\r\nduring the Civil War was conspicuously brilliant and successful, and\r\nhis death ends a very high and honorable career. His countrymen will\r\nsincerely mourn his loss while they cherish with grateful pride the\r\nmemory of his deeds. To officers of the Navy his life will continue\r\nto yield inspiration and encouragement.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., February 14, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the sixth annual report of the Commissioner of\r\nLabor. This report relates to the cost of producing iron and steel and\r\nthe materials of which iron is made in the United States and in Europe,\r\nand the earnings, the efficiency, and the cost of living of the men\r\nemployed in such production.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 14, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe death of William Tecumseh Sherman, which took place to-day at his\r\nresidence in the city of New York, at 1 o'clock and 50 minutes p.m., is\r\nan event that will bring sorrow to the heart of every patriotic citizen.\r\nNo living American was so loved and venerated as he. To look upon his\r\nface, to hear his name, was to have one's love of country intensified.\r\nHe served his country, not for fame, not out of a sense of professional\r\nduty, but for love of the flag and of the beneficent civil institutions\r\nof which it was the emblem. He was an ideal soldier, and shared to the\r\nfullest the _esprit de corps_ of the Army; but he cherished the civil\r\ninstitutions organized under the Constitution, and was a soldier only\r\nthat these might be perpetuated in undiminished usefulness and honor.\r\nHe was in nothing an imitator.\r\n\r\nA profound student of military science and precedent, he drew from them\r\nprinciples and suggestions, and so adapted them to novel conditions that\r\nhis campaigns will continue to be the profitable study of the military\r\nprofession throughout the world. His genial nature made him comrade to\r\nevery soldier of the great Union Army. No presence was so welcome and\r\ninspiring at the camp fire or commandery as his. His career was\r\ncomplete; his honors were full. He had received from the Government the\r\nhighest rank known to our military establishment and from the people\r\nunstinted gratitude and love. No word of mine can add to his fame. His\r\ndeath has followed in startling quickness that of the Admiral of the\r\nNavy; and it is a sad and notable incident that when the Department\r\nunder which he served shall have put on the usual emblems of mourning\r\nfour of the eight Executive Departments will be simultaneously draped\r\nin black, and one other has but today removed the crape from its walls.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 26, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State and accompanying\r\ndocuments, in relation to the execution of letters rogatory in foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 26, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in reply to the resolution of the Senate of the 9th\r\ninstant, a report from the Secretary of State, accompanied by the papers\r\nrelating to the commercial arrangement recently entered into with\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 3, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the resolution of the Senate of this date, I return\r\nherewith Senate bill 1453, to provide for the purchase of a site and the\r\nerection of a public building thereon at Saginaw, in the State of\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 24, 1890_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return to the Senate, in which it originated, with my objections, the\r\nbill (No. 544) \"to provide for the purchase of a site and the erection\r\nof a public building thereon at Bar Harbor, in the State of Maine.\" The\r\nstatement of a few facts will show, I think, that the public needs do\r\nnot justify the contemplated expenditure of $75,000 for the erection\r\nof a public building at Bar Harbor. Only one public office, the\r\npost-office, is to be accommodated. It appears from a report of the\r\nPostmaster-General that the rent paid by the United States for a room\r\ncontaining 875 square feet of floor space was in 1888 $300 and the\r\nexpenditure for fuel and lights $60. One clerk was employed in the\r\noffice and no carriers. The gross postal receipts for that year were\r\n$7,000. Bar Harbor is almost wholly a summer resort. The population of\r\nthe town of Eden, of which Bar Harbor forms a part, as taken by the\r\ncensus enumerators, was less than 2,000. During one quarter of the year\r\nthis population is largely increased by summer residents and visitors,\r\nbut for the other three quarters is not much above the census\r\nenumeration. The postal receipts for 1890 by quarters show that for more\r\nthan half the year the gross receipts of the post-office are about $8\r\nper day. The salary of a janitor for the new building would be more than\r\ntwice the present cost to the Government of rent, fuel, and lights.\r\nI can not believe that upon reconsideration the Congress will approve\r\nthe contemplated expenditure.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 26, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval the bill (H.R. 12365) entitled\r\n\"An act to authorize Oklahoma City, in Oklahoma Territory, to issue\r\nbonds to provide a right of way for the Choctaw Coal and Railway Company\r\nthrough said city.\" This bill authorizes the corporation of Oklahoma\r\nCity to issue corporate bonds to the amount of $40,000 for the purpose\r\nof providing the right of way for a railroad company through the city,\r\nif the proposition shall receive the assent of a majority of the legal\r\nvoters at an election to be called for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is attempted to distinguish this case from the ordinary case of\r\na municipal grant to a railway company by the fact that this railway\r\ncompany had located its line through the lands afterwards settled upon\r\nunder the town-site law before such settlement, and that the route thus\r\nlocated cuts the plat of the city diagonally and in a way to be very\r\ninjurious to property interests.\r\n\r\nUpon an examination of the facts it appears to me to be clear that no\r\nlegal location was made by the railway company prior to the acquisition\r\nof the lands by the occupying settlers. Some preliminary surveys had\r\nbeen made, but no map of location had been filed with the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior. If the rights of this company at this point of its road\r\nas to right of way are derived from the general statute of the United\r\nStates upon that subject (U. S. Revised Statutes, Supplement, p. 87),\r\nthen section 4 distinctly saves the right of any settler who had located\r\nprior to the filing of a profile of the road and the approval by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior thereof. And if, on the other hand, the rights\r\nof the company at the point indicated are derived from the act of\r\nCongress of February 18, 1888, \"to authorize the Choctaw Coal and\r\nRailway Company to construct and operate a railway through the Indian\r\nTerritory, and for other purposes,\" section 6 of that act also plainly\r\nprotects the right of any occupying claimant. The latter statute, it\r\nseems to me, was intended to grant a right of way only through Indian\r\nlands, and if these lands were not such the general statute to which\r\nI have referred would apply; but in either event the conclusion is the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the committee that its favorable action,\r\nand, I must assume, the favorable action of Congress, proceeded upon the\r\ntheory that there was a real controversy, doubtful as to its issue, as\r\nto the right of the railroad company to hold the line of its survey\r\nthrough the city.\r\n\r\nStripped, then, of this claim the proposition is nakedly one to\r\nauthorize Oklahoma City to donate $40,000 to the Choctaw Coal and\r\nRailway Company. The general statute of the United States prohibits\r\nsuch grants, and this must stand until repealed as a continuing\r\nexpression of legislative opinion. If a departure from this rule is to\r\nbe allowed at all, certainly it should only be where the circumstances\r\nare exceptional. Such circumstances, in my opinion, do not exist in\r\nthis case. Already I have received from other cities in the Territory\r\nprotests against special legislation of this sort, accompanied by the\r\nsuggestion that if this policy is admitted other cities shall also be\r\nallowed to encourage the building of roads by donation.\r\n\r\nOklahoma City, according to the report of the Census Office, has a\r\npopulation of about 4,100, and this donation would be equivalent to\r\nnearly $10 per capita. Very little real estate, whether town-site or\r\ncountry property, in this Territory is yet subject to assessment for\r\ntaxation. The people have not yet had time to accumulate, and Congress\r\nhas received appeals for aid to relieve a prevailing distress which the\r\nTerritorial authorities have found themselves unable to deal with. It\r\ndoes not seem to me, in view of all these facts, that the wholesome rule\r\nprescribed by the general statute should be departed from.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 26, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return to the Senate without my approval the bill (S. 4620) \"to\r\nestablish the Record and Pension Office of the War Department, and for\r\nother purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill proposes to change the designation of one of the divisions of\r\nthe War Department. It is now the \"Record and Pension Division,\" and it\r\nis proposed that it shall hereafter be the \"Record and Pension Office\"\r\nof the War Department. The scope of the work assigned to this division\r\nor office is not changed, but the organization now existing under\r\na classification made by the Secretary of War is by the bill made\r\npermanent and put beyond the control of the Secretary. The change of\r\ndesignation seems to have been intended to add dignity to the position,\r\nand the effect of the bill is probably to require that the chief of this\r\noffice shall hereafter be appointed only by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, though it is not clear that any provision is made\r\nfor a chief after the particular person designated in the bill has been\r\nseparated from the place or in case he is not appointed.\r\n\r\nThe real object of the bill is disclosed in the following clause:\r\n\r\n  The President is hereby authorized to nominate and, by and with the\r\n  advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint the officer now in charge\r\n  of said Record and Pension Division to be a colonel in the Army and\r\n  chief of said office.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is fairly to be implied from the bill that in the opinion of Congress\r\nthe public interests would be promoted by making the contemplated change\r\nin the grade of this office and by giving the rank and pay of a colonel\r\nin the Army to the chief. A new and rather anomalous office is therefore\r\ncreated--that of \"colonel in the Army and chief of the Record and\r\nPension Office of the War Department\"--but upon the condition that the\r\nPresident shall nominate a particular person to fill it. I do not think\r\nit is competent for Congress to designate the person who shall fill an\r\noffice created by law, and practically nothing remains of the bill under\r\nconsideration if this person is not to be appointed. The office is an\r\nimportant one, connected with the active civil administration of the War\r\nDepartment. I can not agree that the selection of the officer shall be\r\ntaken out of the discretion of the Executive, where the responsibility\r\nfor good administration necessarily rests. It is probably true that the\r\nofficer intended to be benefited is peculiarly deserving and has had\r\nremarkable success in the discharge of the duties of the office; but\r\nthese are considerations for the appointing power, and might safely have\r\nbeen left there.\r\n\r\nIf this particular appointment was backed by reasons so obvious as\r\nto secure the support of both Houses of Congress, it should have been\r\nassumed that these reasons could have been made obvious to the Executive\r\nby the ordinary methods. In connection with the Army and Navy retired\r\nlists, legislation akin to this has become quite frequent, too frequent\r\nin my opinion; but these laws have been regarded as grants of pensions\r\nrather than of offices.\r\n\r\nIf it is to be allowed that active places connected with the Executive\r\nDepartments can be created upon condition that particular persons are or\r\nare not to be designated to fill them, the power of appointment might be\r\nwholly diverted from the Executive to the Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 2, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval the bill (S. 3270) \"for the relief\r\nof the administratrix of the estate of George W. Lawrence.\"\r\n\r\nIf I rightly construe this bill, it authorizes the Court of Claims to\r\ngive judgment in favor of the contractor with the United States for\r\nthe construction of the vessels named (_Agawam_ and _Pontoosuc_) for\r\nthe difference between the contract price and the actual cost to the\r\ncontractor of building the vessels, subject only to the condition that\r\nnothing shall be allowed for any advance in the price of labor or\r\nmaterial unless such advance occurred during the prolonged term for\r\ncompleting the work rendered necessary by delay resulting from the\r\naction of the Government. The bill is somewhat obscure, but I have,\r\nI think, correctly stated the legal effect of it.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly in contracts made for army and navy supplies and\r\nconstruction during the early days of the war there was not infrequently\r\nloss to the contractor by reason of the advance in the cost of labor\r\nresulting from the withdrawal of so large a body of men for service in\r\nthe field and the indirect result of this upon the cost of material; but\r\nI can not believe that it is the purpose of Congress to reopen such\r\ncontracts at this late day and to pay to the contractors the cost of the\r\nwork or material which they stipulated to do or deliver at fixed prices.\r\nIn the matter of another vessel constructed by this same claimant and\r\nin the case of one other similar claim I approved bills at the last\r\nsession, but they carefully limited any finding by the Court of Claims\r\nto such losses as necessarily resulted from the interference by the\r\nGovernment with the progress of the work, thus creating delays and\r\nenhanced cost.\r\n\r\nIn those cases the Government only undertook to make good losses\r\nresulting directly and unavoidably from its own acts. If the principle\r\nwhich seems to me to be embodied in the bill under consideration is\r\nadopted, I do not see how the Congress can refuse in all cases of all\r\nsorts of contracts to make good the losses resulting from appreciation\r\nin the cost of labor and material. The expenditure that such a policy\r\nwould entail is incalculable, and the policy itself is, in my judgment,\r\nindefensible. The bill at the last session for the relief of this\r\nclaimant in the case of another vessel constructed by him was, as I have\r\nsaid, carefully put upon the lines I have indicated, and if this claim\r\ncould have been maintained upon, those lines I assume that the bill\r\nwould have been similar in its provisions.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory proof has been presented to me that provision has\r\nbeen made for adequate grounds and buildings for the uses of the World's\r\nColumbian Exposition, and that a sum not less than $10,000,000, to be\r\nused and expended for the purposes of said exposition, has been provided\r\nin accordance with the conditions and requirements of section 10 of\r\nan act entitled \"An act to provide for celebrating the four hundredth\r\nanniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus by\r\nholding an international exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures,\r\nand the products of the soil, mine, and sea, in the city of Chicago,\r\nin the State of Illinois,\" approved April 25, 1890:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States, by\r\nvirtue of the authority vested in me by said act, do hereby declare and\r\nproclaim that such international exhibition will be opened on the 1st\r\nday of May, in the year 1893, in the city of Chicago, in the State of\r\nIllinois, and will not be closed before the last Thursday in October of\r\nthe same year.

It has been as wide as our country, and\r\nso special that every home has felt its comforting influence. It is too\r\ngreat to be the work of man's power and too particular to be the device\r\nof his mind.

(1) When a soldier shall be found guilty of an offense cognizable\r\nwhen committed for the first time by an inferior court-martial, his\r\npunishment therefor may exceed the prescribed limit by one-half if it\r\nshall appear that during his current enlistment and within two years\r\npreceding his trial he has been once convicted of one offense or more;\r\nit may be doubled if he has been twice so convicted, and it may be\r\nincreased by one-half of the prescribed limit for every such previous\r\nconviction: _Provided_, That upon proof of five or more previous\r\nconvictions the punishment may be that authorized for a fifth\r\nconviction, or dishonorable discharge with forfeiture of all pay and\r\nallowances. When found guilty of an offense cognizable only by a general\r\ncourt-martial, and on proof of five or more previous convictions within\r\nthe two years, dishonorable discharge with forfeiture of all pay and\r\nallowances may be added to any confinement at hard labor. And when\r\na noncommissioned officer shall be found guilty of an offense not\r\npunishable by reduction, reduction may be added to the punishment if it\r\nshall appear that he has been convicted of a military offense within one\r\nyear and during his current enlistment.\r\n\r\n(2) After arriving at the findings a court-martial may be opened to\r\nreceive evidence of previous convictions. These convictions must be\r\nproved by the records of previous trials or by duly authenticated orders\r\npromulgating the same, showing the actual offenses of which the soldier\r\nwas convicted, except in the cases of convictions by summary court, when\r\na duly authenticated copy of the record of said court shall be deemed\r\nsufficient proof. Charges forwarded to the authority ordering a general\r\ncourt-martial or submitted to a summary garrison or regimental court\r\nmust be accompanied by the proper evidence of such previous convictions\r\nas may have to be considered in determining upon a sentence. Paragraphs\r\n1017 and 1018 of the Regulations are superseded by this order.\r\n\r\nIV. This order prescribes the _maximum_ limit of punishment for the\r\noffenses named, and this limit is intended for those cases where the\r\nseverest punishment should be awarded. In other cases the punishment\r\nmust be graded down according to the extenuating circumstances. Offenses\r\nnot herein provided for remain punishable as authorized by the Articles\r\nof War and the custom of the service.\r\n\r\nV. Summary courts are subject to the restrictions named in the\r\neighty-third article of war. Soldiers against whom charges may be\r\npreferred for trial by summary court shall not be confined in the\r\nguardhouse, but shall be placed in arrest in quarters before and during\r\ntrial and while awaiting sentence, unless in particular cases restraint\r\nmay be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nVI. The following substitutions for punishments named in Section II of\r\nthis order are authorized, at the discretion of the court:\r\n\r\nDetention of pay to the extent of four times the amount of the\r\nforfeiture; two days' confinement at hard labor for $1 of forfeited pay;\r\none day's solitary confinement on bread and water diet for two days'\r\nconfinement at hard labor or for $1 of forfeited pay: _Provided_, That a\r\nnoncommissioned officer not sentenced to reduction shall not be subject\r\nto confinement: _And provided_, That solitary confinement shall not\r\nexceed fourteen days at one time nor be repeated until fourteen days\r\nhave elapsed, and shall not exceed eighty-four days in one year.\r\nWherever the limit herein prescribed for an offense or offenses may\r\nbe brought within the punishing power of inferior courts-martial,\r\nas defined by the eighty-third article of war, by substitution of\r\npunishment under the provisions of this section, the aforesaid courts\r\nshall be deemed to have jurisdiction of such offense or offenses.\r\n\r\nVII. Sergeants shall not if they object thereto be brought to trial\r\nbefore regimental, garrison, or summary courts-martial without the\r\nauthority of the officer competent to order their trial by general\r\ncourt-martial; nor shall sergeants of the post noncommissioned staff\r\nbe reduced, but they may be dishonorably discharged whenever reduction\r\nis included in the limit of punishment. Paragraphs 105 and 254 of the\r\nRegulations, the latter as amended by General Orders, No. 67, series\r\nof 1890, Adjutant-General's Office, are modified accordingly.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

Immediately after the general average shall have been ascertained\r\neach competitor shall be notified that he has passed or has failed to\r\npass.\r\n\r\n3. A competitor who has failed to pass an examination may, with the\r\nconsent of the Commission, be allowed reexamination at any time within\r\nsix months from the date of failure without filing a new application;\r\nbut if he be not allowed reexamination within six months he shall be\r\nrequired to file a new application before being again examined.\r\n\r\n4. No eligible shall be allowed reexamination during the period of his\r\neligibility unless he shall furnish satisfactory evidence to the\r\nCommission that at the time of his examination, because of illness or\r\nother good cause, he was incapable of doing himself justice; and his\r\nrating on such reexamination shall cancel and be a substitute for his\r\nrating on his former examination.\r\n\r\n5. All competitors whose claim to preference under section 1754 of the\r\nRevised Statutes have been allowed by the Commission who attain a\r\ngeneral average of 65 per cent or over, and all other competitors who\r\nattain a general average of 70 per cent or over, shall be eligible for\r\nappointment to the place for which they were examined. The names of all\r\nthe competitors thus rendered eligible shall be entered in the order of\r\ngrade on the proper register of eligibles.\r\n\r\n6. When two or more eligibles are of the same grade, preference in\r\ncertification shall be determined by the order in which the application\r\npapers are filed.\r\n\r\n7. For the Indian service there shall be four districts and a separate\r\nregister of eligibles for each grade of examination for each district,\r\nthe names of males and females being listed separately on each register.\r\nThe districts shall be comprised as follows: No. 1, of the States of\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South\r\nDakota, Montana, and Wyoming; No. 2, of the States of Idaho, Washington,\r\nOregon, Nevada, and that part of California lying north of the\r\nthirty-seventh parallel of latitude, and the Territory of Utah; No. 3,\r\nof that part of California lying south of the thirty-seventh parallel of\r\nlatitude, the Territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, the Indian\r\nTerritory, and the States of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas,\r\nLouisiana, and Texas; No. 4, of all the States of the United States not\r\nembraced in any of the foregoing districts, together with the District\r\nof Columbia. Upon the written request of any eligible his name shall be\r\nentered upon the register of any one or more of the districts other than\r\nthat in which he resides: _Provided_, That he shall state in writing his\r\nwillingness to accept service wherever assigned in any such district.\r\n\r\n8. The period of eligibility to appointment shall be one year from the\r\ndate on which the name of the eligible is entered on the register unless\r\notherwise determined by regulation of the Commission.\r\n\r\nINDIAN RULE IV.\r\n\r\n1. All vacancies, unless filled by promotion, transfer, or\r\nreappointment, shall be filled in the following manner:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, through the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, shall, in form and manner to be prescribed by the Commission,\r\nrequest the certification to him of male or female eligibles from the\r\ndistrict in which the vacancy exists.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If fitness for the vacant place is tested by competitive\r\nexamination, the Commission shall certify from the proper register of\r\nthe district in which the vacancy exists the names of the three\r\neligibles thereon of the sex called for having the highest averages:\r\n_Provided_, That the eligibles upon any register who have been allowed\r\npreference under section 1754 of the Revised Statutes shall be certified\r\naccording to their grade before all other eligibles thereon: _And\r\nprovided further_, That if the vacancy is in the grade of matron or\r\nteacher, and the wife of the superintendent of the school in which the\r\nvacancy exists is an eligible, she may be given preference in\r\ncertification if the appointing officer so requests.\r\n\r\n2. Of the three names certified to him the appointing officer shall\r\nselect one, and if at the time of making this selection there are more\r\nvacancies than one he may select more than one: _Provided_, That if the\r\nappointing officer to whom certification has been made shall object in\r\nwriting to any eligible named in the certificate, stating that because\r\nof physical incapacity or for other good cause particularly specified\r\nsuch eligible is not capable of properly performing the duties of the\r\nvacant place, the Commission may, upon investigation and ascertainment\r\nof the fact that the objection made is good and well founded, direct the\r\ncertification of another eligible in place of the one objected to.\r\n\r\n3. Each person thus designated for appointment shall be notified,\r\nand upon indicating acceptance shall be appointed for a probationary\r\nperiod--if a physician, for six months, and if a school employee, to\r\nexpire at the end of the then current school year--at the end of which\r\nperiod, if his conduct and capacity be satisfactory to the appointing\r\nofficer, he shall receive absolute appointment; but if his conduct and\r\ncapacity be not satisfactory to said officer he shall be so notified,\r\nand this notification shall be his discharge from the service:\r\n_Provided_, That any probationer may be discharged during probation for\r\nmisconduct or evident unfitness or incapacity.\r\n\r\n4. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall require the officer\r\nunder whom a probationer may be serving to carefully observe and\r\nreport in writing upon the services rendered by and the character and\r\nqualifications of such probationer as to punctuality, industry, habits,\r\nability, and adaptability. These reports shall be preserved on file, and\r\nthe Commission may prescribe the form and manner in which they shall be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n5. In case of the sudden occurrence of a vacancy in any school during a\r\nschool term which the public interest requires to be immediately filled,\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs is authorized, in his discretion,\r\nto provide for the temporary filling of the same until a regular\r\nappointment can be made under the provisions of sections 1, 2, and 3\r\nof this rule, and when such regular appointment is made the temporary\r\nappointment shall terminate. All temporary appointments made under this\r\nauthority and their termination shall at once be reported to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nINDIAN RULE V.\r\n\r\nUntil promotion regulations shall have been applied to the classified\r\nIndian service promotions therein may be made upon any test of fitness\r\ndetermined upon by the promoting officer if not disapproved by the\r\nCommission: _Provided_, That preference in promotion in any school shall\r\nbe given to those longest in the service unless there are good reasons\r\nto the contrary; and when such reasons prevail they shall, through the\r\nproper channels, be reported to the Commission: _And provided further_,\r\nThat no one shall be promoted to any grade he could not enter by\r\noriginal appointment under the minimum age limitation applied thereto\r\nby Indian Rule II, section 2, and that no one shall be promoted to the\r\ngrade of physician from any other grade.\r\n\r\nINDIAN RULE VI.\r\n\r\nSubject to the conditions stated in Rule IV, transfers may be made after\r\nabsolute appointment from one school to another and from one district to\r\nanother under such regulations as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\r\nwith the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, may prescribe.\r\n\r\nINDIAN RULE VII.\r\n\r\nUpon the requisition of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, through\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, the Commission shall certify for\r\nreinstatement in a grade or class no higher than that in which he was\r\nformerly employed any person who within one year next preceding the\r\ndate of the requisition has through no delinquency or misconduct\r\nbeen separated from the classified Indian service: _Provided_, That\r\ncertification may be made, subject to the other conditions of this rule,\r\nfor the reinstatement of any person who served in the military or naval\r\nservice of the United States in the late War of the Rebellion and was\r\nhonorably discharged therefrom, without regard to the length of time\r\nhe has been separated from the service.\r\n\r\nINDIAN RULE VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall report to the Commission--\r\n\r\n(_a_) Every probational and every absolute appointment in the classified\r\nIndian service.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Every refusal to make an absolute appointment and the reason\r\ntherefor, and every refusal to accept an appointment.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Every separation from the classified Indian service and the cause\r\nof such separation, whether death, resignation, or dismissal.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Every restoration to the classified Indian service.\r\n\r\nThese rules shall take effect October 1, 1891.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENDMENT OF CIVIL SERVICE RULES.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 9, 1891.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rule III, clause 6, is hereby amended by striking out the words\r\n\"under such regulations as the Commission may make\" and substituting\r\ntherefor the following: \"under regulations to be approved by the\r\nPresident;\" so that as amended the clause will read as follows:\r\n\r\n  So far as practicable and useful competitive examinations shall be\r\n  established in the classified civil service to test fitness for\r\n  promotion under regulations to be approved by the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\nWhereas civil-service rules for the Indian service were approved to take\r\neffect October 1, 1891; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is represented to me by the Civil Service Commission in a\r\ncommunication of this date that no persons have as yet been examined for\r\nappointment to that service, and that it seems probable that complete\r\narrangements for putting said rules into full effect will not be made\r\nsooner than March 1, 1892:\r\n\r\n_It is therefore ordered_, That said Indian rules shall take effect\r\nMarch 1, 1892, instead of October 1, 1891: _Provided_, That said rules\r\nshall become operative and take effect in any district of the Indian\r\nservice as soon as an eligible register for such district shall be\r\nprovided, if it shall be prior to the date above fixed.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 13, 1891_.\r\n\r\nUpon the recommendation of the Commission the foregoing order is\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENDMENT OF CIVIL-SERVICE RULES.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 24, 1891.\r\n\r\nSpecial Departmental Rule No. 1 is hereby amended so as to include among\r\nthe places excepted from examination the following:\r\n\r\n  In the Department of the Treasury, in the Bureau of Statistics: One\r\n  confidential clerk to the Chief of the Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 4, 1891_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[21] In my message to the first session of the Fifty-first Congress\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n  I have suggested to the heads of the Executive Departments that they\r\n  consider whether a record might not be kept in each bureau of all those\r\n  elements that are covered by the terms \"faithfulness\" and \"efficiency,\"\r\n  and a rating made showing the relative merits of the clerks of each\r\n  class, this rating to be regarded as a test of merit in making\r\n  promotions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some of the Departments this suggestion has been acted upon in part\r\nat least, and I now direct that in your Department a plan be at once\r\ndevised and put in operation for keeping an efficiency record of all\r\npersons within the classified service, with a view to placing promotions\r\nwholly upon the basis of merit.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to make provision for carrying into effect the\r\nstipulations of the civil-service law in relation to promotions in\r\nthe classified service. To that end the rule requiring compulsory\r\nexamination has been rescinded. In my opinion the examination for\r\npromotion of those who present themselves should be chiefly, if not\r\nwholly, upon their knowledge of the work of the bureau or Department to\r\nwhich they belong and the record of efficiency made by them during their\r\nprevious service. I think the records of efficiency kept from day to day\r\nshould be open to the inspection of the clerks.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Addressed to the heads of the Executive Departments.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 9, 1891_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe reports of the heads of the several Executive Departments, required\r\nby law to be submitted to me, which are herewith transmitted, and the\r\nreports of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney-General, made\r\ndirectly to Congress, furnish a comprehensive view of the administrative\r\nwork of the last fiscal year relating to internal affairs. It would be\r\nof great advantage if these reports could have an attentive perusal by\r\nevery member of Congress and by all who take an interest in public\r\naffairs. Such a perusal could not fail to excite a higher appreciation\r\nof the vast labor and conscientious effort which are given to the\r\nconduct of our civil administration.\r\n\r\nThe reports will, I believe, show that every question has been\r\napproached, considered, and decided from the standpoint of public duty\r\nand upon considerations affecting the public interests alone. Again I\r\ninvite to every branch of the service the attention and scrutiny of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe work of the State Department during the last year has been\r\ncharacterized by an unusual number of important negotiations and by\r\ndiplomatic results of a notable and highly beneficial character. Among\r\nthese are the reciprocal trade arrangements which have been concluded,\r\nin the exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 of the tariff law,\r\nwith the Republic of Brazil, with Spain for its West India possessions,\r\nand with Santo Domingo. Like negotiations with other countries have been\r\nmuch advanced, and it is hoped that before the close of the year further\r\ndefinitive trade arrangements of great value will be concluded.\r\n\r\nIn view of the reports which had been received as to the diminution of\r\nthe seal herds in the Bering Sea, I deemed it wise to propose to Her\r\nMajesty's Government in February last that an agreement for a closed\r\nseason should be made pending the negotiations for arbitration, which\r\nthen seemed to be approaching a favorable conclusion. After much\r\ncorrespondence and delays, for which this Government was not\r\nresponsible, an agreement was reached and signed on the 15th of June, by\r\nwhich Great Britain undertook from that date and until May 1, 1892, to\r\nprohibit the killing by her subjects of seals in the Bering Sea, and the\r\nGovernment of the United States during the same period to enforce its\r\nexisting prohibition against pelagic sealing and to limit the catch by\r\nthe fur-seal company upon the islands to 7,500 skins. If this agreement\r\ncould have been reached earlier in response to the strenuous endeavors\r\nof this Government, it would have been more effective; but coming even\r\nas late as it did it unquestionably resulted in greatly diminishing the\r\ndestruction of the seals by the Canadian sealers.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I stated that the basis of arbitration\r\nproposed by Her Majesty's Government for the adjustment of the\r\nlong-pending controversy as to the seal fisheries was not acceptable.\r\nI am glad now to be able to announce that terms satisfactory to this\r\nGovernment have been agreed upon and that an agreement as to the\r\narbitrators is all that is necessary to the completion of the\r\nconvention. In view of the advanced position which this Government has\r\ntaken upon the subject of international arbitration, this renewed\r\nexpression of our adherence to this method for the settlement of\r\ndisputes such as have arisen in the Bering Sea will, I doubt not, meet\r\nwith the concurrence of Congress.\r\n\r\nProvision should be made for a joint demarcation of the frontier line\r\nbetween Canada and the United States wherever required by the increasing\r\nborder settlements, and especially for the exact location of the water\r\nboundary in the straits and rivers.\r\n\r\nI should have been glad to announce some favorable disposition of the\r\nboundary dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela touching the\r\nwestern frontier of British Guiana, but the friendly efforts of the\r\nUnited States in that direction have thus far been unavailing. This\r\nGovernment will continue to express its concern at any appearance of\r\nforeign encroachment on territories long under the administrative\r\ncontrol of American States. The determination of a disputed boundary\r\nis easily attainable by amicable arbitration where the rights of the\r\nrespective parties rest, as here, on historic facts readily\r\nascertainable.\r\n\r\nThe law of the last Congress providing a system of inspection for our\r\nmeats intended for export, and clothing the President with power to\r\nexclude foreign products from our market in case the country sending\r\nthem should perpetuate unjust discriminations against any product of the\r\nUnited States, placed this Government in a position to effectively urge\r\nthe removal of such discriminations against our meats. It is gratifying\r\nto be able to state that Germany, Denmark, Italy, Austria, and France,\r\nin the order named, have opened their ports to inspected American pork\r\nproducts. The removal of these restrictions in every instance was asked\r\nfor and given solely upon the ground that we have now provided a meat\r\ninspection that should be accepted as adequate to the complete removal\r\nof the dangers, real or fancied, which had been previously urged. The\r\nState Department, our ministers abroad, and the Secretary of Agriculture\r\nhave cooperated with unflagging and intelligent zeal for the\r\naccomplishment of this great result. The outlines of an agreement have\r\nbeen reached with Germany looking to equitable trade concessions in\r\nconsideration of the continued free importation of her sugars, but the\r\ntime has not yet arrived when this correspondence can be submitted to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe recent political disturbances in the Republic of Brazil have\r\nexcited regret and solicitude. The information we possessed was too\r\nmeager to enable us to form a satisfactory judgment of the causes\r\nleading to the temporary assumption of supreme power by President\r\nFonseca; but this Government did not fail to express to him its anxious\r\nsolicitude for the peace of Brazil and for the maintenance of the free\r\npolitical institutions which had recently been established there, nor to\r\noffer our advice that great moderation should be observed in the clash\r\nof parties and the contest for leadership. These counsels were received\r\nin the most friendly spirit, and the latest information is that\r\nconstitutional government has been reestablished without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe lynching at New Orleans in March last of eleven men of Italian\r\nnativity by a mob of citizens was a most deplorable and discreditable\r\nincident. It did not, however, have its origin in any general animosity\r\nto the Italian people, nor in any disrespect to the Government of Italy,\r\nwith which our relations were of the most friendly character. The fury\r\nof the mob was directed against these men as the supposed participants\r\nor accessories in the murder of a city officer. I do not allude to this\r\nas mitigating in any degree this offense against law and humanity, but\r\nonly as affecting the international questions which grew out of it. It\r\nwas at once represented by the Italian minister that several of those\r\nwhose lives had been taken by the mob were Italian subjects, and a\r\ndemand was made for the punishment of the participants and for an\r\nindemnity to the families of those who were killed. It is to be\r\nregretted that the manner in which these claims were presented was not\r\nsuch as to promote a calm discussion of the questions involved; but this\r\nmay well be attributed to the excitement and indignation which the crime\r\nnaturally evoked. The views of this Government as to its obligations to\r\nforeigners domiciled here were fully stated in the correspondence, as\r\nwell as its purpose to make an investigation of the affair with a view\r\nto determine whether there were present any circumstances that could\r\nunder such rules of duty as we had indicated create an obligation upon\r\nthe United States. The temporary absence of a minister plenipotentiary\r\nof Italy at this capital has retarded the further correspondence, but\r\nit is not doubted that a friendly conclusion is attainable.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions growing out of this unhappy incident are worthy the\r\nattention of Congress. It would, I believe, be entirely competent for\r\nCongress to make offenses against the treaty rights of foreigners\r\ndomiciled in the United States cognizable in the Federal courts. This\r\nhas not, however, been done, and the Federal officers and courts have no\r\npower in such cases to intervene, either for the protection of a foreign\r\ncitizen or for the punishment of his slayers. It seems to me to follow,\r\nin this state of the law, that the officers of the State charged with\r\npolice and judicial powers in such cases must in the consideration of\r\ninternational questions growing out of such incidents be regarded in\r\nsuch sense as Federal agents as to make this Government answerable for\r\ntheir acts in cases where it would be answerable if the United States\r\nhad used its constitutional power to define and punish crime against\r\ntreaty rights.\r\n\r\nThe civil war in Chile, which began in January last, was continued, but\r\nfortunately with infrequent and not important armed collisions, until\r\nAugust 28, when the Congressional forces landed near Valparaiso and\r\nafter a bloody engagement captured that city. President Balmaceda at\r\nonce recognized that his cause was lost, and a Provisional Government\r\nwas speedily established by the victorious party. Our minister was\r\npromptly directed to recognize and put himself in communication with\r\nthis Government so soon as it should have established its _de facto_\r\ncharacter, which was done. During the pendency of this civil contest\r\nfrequent indirect appeals were made to this Government to extend\r\nbelligerent rights to the insurgents and to give audience to their\r\nrepresentatives. This was declined, and that policy was pursued\r\nthroughout which this Government when wrenched by civil war so\r\nstrenuously insisted upon on the part of European nations. The _Itata_,\r\nan armed vessel commanded by a naval officer of the insurgent fleet,\r\nmanned by its sailors and with soldiers on board, was seized under\r\nprocess of the United States court at San Diego, Cal., for a violation\r\nof our neutrality laws. While in the custody of an officer of the court\r\nthe vessel was forcibly wrested from his control and put to sea. It\r\nwould have been inconsistent with the dignity and self-respect of this\r\nGovernment not to have insisted that the _Itata_ should be returned to\r\nSan Diego to abide the judgment of the court. This was so clear to the\r\njunta of the Congressional party, established at Iquique, that before\r\nthe arrival of the _Itata_ at that port the secretary of foreign\r\nrelations of the Provisional Government addressed to Rear-Admiral Brown,\r\ncommanding the United States naval forces, a communication, from which\r\nthe following is an extract:\r\n\r\n  The Provisional Government has learned by the cablegrams of the\r\n  Associated Press that the transport _Itata_, detained in San Diego by\r\n  order of the United States for taking on board munitions of war, and\r\n  in possession of the marshal, left the port, carrying on board this\r\n  official, who was landed at a point near the coast, and then continued\r\n  her voyage. * * * If this news be correct this Government would deplore\r\n  the conduct of the _Itata_, and as an evidence that it is not disposed\r\n  to support or agree to the infraction of the laws of the United States\r\n  the undersigned takes advantage of the personal relations you have been\r\n  good enough to maintain with him since your arrival in this port to\r\n  declare to you that as soon as she is within reach of our orders his\r\n  Government will put the _Itata_, with the arms and munitions she took\r\n  on board in San Diego, at the disposition of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA trial in the district court of the United States for the southern\r\ndistrict of California has recently resulted in a decision holding,\r\namong other things, that inasmuch as the Congressional party had not\r\nbeen recognized as a belligerent the acts done in its interest could not\r\nbe a violation of our neutrality laws. From this judgment the United\r\nStates has appealed, not that the condemnation of the vessel is a matter\r\nof importance, but that we may know what the present state of our law\r\nis; for if this construction of the statute is correct there is obvious\r\nnecessity for revision and amendment.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the war in Chile this Government tendered its\r\ngood offices to bring about a peaceful adjustment, and it was at one\r\ntime hoped that a good result might be reached; but in this we were\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to our naval officers and to our minister at Santiago\r\nfrom the first to the last of this struggle enjoined upon them the most\r\nimpartial treatment and absolute noninterference. I am satisfied that\r\nthese instructions were observed and that our representatives were\r\nalways watchful to use their influence impartially in the interest of\r\nhumanity, and on more than one occasion did so effectively. We could not\r\nforget, however, that this Government was in diplomatic relations with\r\nthe then established Government of Chile, as it is now in such relations\r\nwith the successor of that Government. I am quite sure that President\r\nMontt, who has, under circumstances of promise for the peace of Chile,\r\nbeen installed as President of that Republic, will not desire that in\r\nthe unfortunate event of any revolt against his authority the policy\r\nof this Government should be other than that which we have recently\r\nobserved. No official complaint of the conduct of our minister or\r\nof our naval officers during the struggle has been presented to this\r\nGovernment, and it is a matter of regret that so many of our own\r\npeople should have given ear to unofficial charges and complaints that\r\nmanifestly had their origin in rival interests and in a wish to pervert\r\nthe relations of the United States with Chile.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the Government of Balmaceda brought about a condition\r\nwhich is unfortunately too familiar in the history of the Central and\r\nSouth American States. With the overthrow of the Balmaceda Government\r\nhe and many of his councilors and officers became at once fugitives for\r\ntheir lives, and appealed to the commanding officers of the foreign\r\nnaval vessels in the harbor of Valparaiso and to the resident foreign\r\nministers at Santiago for asylum. This asylum was freely given,\r\naccording to my information, by the naval vessels of several foreign\r\npowers and by several of the legations at Santiago. The American\r\nminister as well as his colleagues, acting upon the impulse of humanity,\r\nextended asylum to political refugees whose lives were in peril. I have\r\nnot been willing to direct the surrender of such of these persons as are\r\nstill in the American legation without suitable conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the Government of Chile is not in a position, in\r\nview of the precedents with which it has been connected, to broadly deny\r\nthe right of asylum, and the correspondence has not thus far presented\r\nany such denial. The treatment of our minister for a time was such as to\r\ncall for a decided protest, and it was very gratifying to observe that\r\nunfriendly measures, which were undoubtedly the result of the prevailing\r\nexcitement, were at once rescinded or suitably relaxed.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of October an event occurred in Valparaiso so serious and\r\ntragic in its circumstances and results as to very justly excite the\r\nindignation of our people and to call for prompt and decided action on\r\nthe part of this Government. A considerable number of the sailors of the\r\nUnited States steamship _Baltimore_, then in the harbor at Valparaiso,\r\nbeing upon shore leave and unarmed, were assaulted by armed men nearly\r\nsimultaneously in different localities in the city. One petty officer\r\nwas killed outright and seven or eight seamen were seriously wounded,\r\none of whom has since died. So savage and brutal was the assault that\r\nseveral of our sailors received more than two and one as many as\r\neighteen stab wounds. An investigation of the affair was promptly made\r\nby a board of officers of the _Baltimore_, and their report shows that\r\nthese assaults were unprovoked, that our men were conducting themselves\r\nin a peaceable and orderly manner, and that some of the police of the\r\ncity took part in the assault and used their weapons with fatal effect,\r\nwhile a few others, with some well-disposed citizens, endeavored to\r\nprotect our men. Thirty-six of our sailors were arrested, and some of\r\nthem while being taken to prison were cruelly beaten and maltreated.\r\nThe fact that they were all discharged, no criminal charge being lodged\r\nagainst any one of them, shows very clearly that they were innocent of\r\nany breach of the peace.\r\n\r\nSo far as I have yet been able to learn no other explanation of this\r\nbloody work has been suggested than that it had its origin in hostility\r\nto those men as sailors of the United States, wearing the uniform of\r\ntheir Government, and not in any individual act or personal animosity.\r\nThe attention of the Chilean Government was at once called to this\r\naffair, and a statement of the facts obtained by the investigation we\r\nhad conducted was submitted, accompanied by a request to be advised of\r\nany other or qualifying facts in the possession of the Chilean\r\nGovernment that might tend to relieve this affair of the appearance of\r\nan insult to this Government. The Chilean Government was also advised\r\nthat if such qualifying facts did not exist this Government would\r\nconfidently expect full and prompt reparation.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the reply of the secretary for foreign\r\naffairs of the Provisional Government was couched in an offensive tone.\r\nTo this no response has been made. This Government is now awaiting the\r\nresult of an investigation which has been conducted by the criminal\r\ncourt at Valparaiso. It is reported unofficially that the investigation\r\nis about completed, and it is expected that the result will soon be\r\ncommunicated to this Government, together with some adequate and\r\nsatisfactory response to the note by which the attention of Chile\r\nwas called to this incident. If these just expectations should be\r\ndisappointed or further needless delay intervene, I will by a special\r\nmessage bring this matter again to the attention of Congress for\r\nsuch action as may be necessary. The entire correspondence with the\r\nGovernment of Chile will at an early day be submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation of my special message dated January 16,\r\n1890,[22] for the adoption of the necessary legislation to enable this\r\nGovernment to apply in the case of Sweden and Norway the same rule in\r\nrespect to the levying of tonnage dues as was claimed and secured to the\r\nshipping of the United States in 1828 under Article VIII of the treaty\r\nof 1827.\r\n\r\nThe adjournment of the Senate without action on the pending acts for\r\nthe suppression of the slave traffic in Africa and for the reform of\r\nthe revenue tariff of the Independent State of the Kongo left this\r\nGovernment unable to exchange those acts on the date fixed, July 2,\r\n1891. A _modus vivendi_ has been concluded by which the power of the\r\nKongo State to levy duties on imports is left unimpaired, and by\r\nagreement of all the signatories to the general slave trade act the time\r\nfor the exchange of ratifications on the part of the United States has\r\nbeen extended to February 2, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe late outbreak against foreigners in various parts of the\r\nChinese Empire has been a cause of deep concern in view of the numerous\r\nestablishments of our citizens in the interior of that country. This\r\nGovernment can do no less than insist upon a continuance of the\r\nprotective and punitory measures which the Chinese Government has\r\nheretofore applied. No effort will be omitted to protect our citizens\r\npeaceably sojourning in China, but recent unofficial information\r\nindicates that what was at first regarded as an outbreak of mob violence\r\nagainst foreigners has assumed the larger form of an insurrection\r\nagainst public order.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government has declined to receive Mr. Blair as the minister\r\nof the United States on the ground that as a participant while a Senator\r\nin the enactment of the existing legislation against the introduction of\r\nChinese laborers he has become unfriendly and objectionable to China.\r\nI have felt constrained to point out to the Chinese Government the\r\nuntenableness of this position, which seems to rest as much on the\r\nunacceptability of our legislation as on that of the person chosen,\r\nand which if admitted would practically debar the selection of any\r\nrepresentative so long as the existing laws remain in force.\r\n\r\nYou will be called upon to consider the expediency of making special\r\nprovision by law for the temporary admission of some Chinese artisans\r\nand laborers in connection with the exhibit of Chinese industries at the\r\napproaching Columbian Exposition. I regard it as desirable that the\r\nChinese exhibit be facilitated in every proper way.\r\n\r\nA question has arisen with the Government of Spain touching the rights\r\nof American citizens in the Caroline Islands. Our citizens there long\r\nprior to the confirmation of Spain's claim to the islands had secured\r\nby settlement and purchase certain rights to the recognition and\r\nmaintenance of which the faith of Spain was pledged. I have had reason\r\nwithin the past year very strongly to protest against the failure to\r\ncarry out this pledge on the part of His Majesty's ministers, which has\r\nresulted in great injustice and injury to the American residents.\r\n\r\nThe Government and people of Spain propose to celebrate the four\r\nhundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by holding an\r\nexposition at Madrid, which will open on the 12th of September and\r\ncontinue until the 31st of December, 1892. A cordial invitation has\r\nbeen extended to the United States to take part in this commemoration,\r\nand as Spain was one of the first nations to express the intention to\r\nparticipate in the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, it would\r\nbe very appropriate for this Government to give this invitation its\r\nfriendly promotion.\r\n\r\nSurveys for the connecting links of the projected intercontinental\r\nrailway are in progress, not only in Mexico, but at various points along\r\nthe course mapped out. Three surveying parties are now in the field\r\nunder the direction of the commission. Nearly 1,000 miles of the\r\nproposed road have been surveyed, including the most difficult part,\r\nthat through Ecuador and the southern part of Colombia. The reports of\r\nthe engineers are very satisfactory, and show that no insurmountable\r\nobstacles have been met with.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1884, a treaty was concluded with Mexico reaffirming\r\nthe boundary between the two countries as described in the treaties of\r\nFebruary 2, 1848, and December 30, 1853. March 1, 1889, a further treaty\r\nwas negotiated to facilitate the carrying out of the principles of the\r\ntreaty of 1884 and to avoid the difficulties occasioned by reason of the\r\nchanges and alterations that take place from natural causes in the Rio\r\nGrande and Colorado rivers in the portions thereof constituting the\r\nboundary line between the two Republics. The International Boundary\r\nCommission provided for by the treaty of 1889 to have exclusive\r\njurisdiction of any question that may arise has been named by the\r\nMexican Government. An appropriation is necessary to enable the United\r\nStates to fulfill its treaty obligations in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe death of King Kalakaua in the United States afforded occasion to\r\ntestify our friendship for Hawaii by conveying the King's body to his\r\nown land in a naval vessel with all due honors. The Government of his\r\nsuccessor, Queen Liliuokolani, is seeking to promote closer commercial\r\nrelations with the United States. Surveys for the much-needed submarine\r\ncable from our Pacific coast to Honolulu are in progress, and this\r\nenterprise should have the suitable promotion of the two Governments.\r\nI strongly recommend that provision be made for improving the harbor\r\nof Pearl River and equipping it as a naval station.\r\n\r\nThe arbitration treaty formulated by the International American\r\nConference lapsed by reason of the failure to exchange ratifications\r\nfully within the limit of time provided; but several of the Governments\r\nconcerned have expressed a desire to save this important result of\r\nthe conference by an extension of the period. It is, in my judgment,\r\nincumbent upon the United States to conserve the influential initiative\r\nit has taken in this measure by ratifying the instrument and by\r\nadvocating the proposed extension of the time for exchange. These views\r\nhave been made known to the other signatories.\r\n\r\nThis Government has found occasion to express in a friendly spirit, but\r\nwith much earnestness, to the Government of the Czar its serious concern\r\nbecause of the harsh measures now being enforced against the Hebrews in\r\nRussia. By the revival of antisemitic laws, long in abeyance, great\r\nnumbers of those unfortunate people have been constrained to abandon\r\ntheir homes and leave the Empire by reason of the impossibility of\r\nfinding subsistence within the pale to which it is sought to confine\r\nthem. The immigration of these people to the United States--many other\r\ncountries being closed to them--is largely increasing and is likely\r\nto assume proportions which may make it difficult to find homes and\r\nemployment for them here and to seriously affect the labor market. It is\r\nestimated that over 1,000,000 will be forced from Russia within a few\r\nyears. The Hebrew is never a beggar; he has always kept the law--life by\r\ntoil--often under severe and oppressive civil restrictions. It is also\r\ntrue that no race, sect, or class has more fully cared for its own than\r\nthe Hebrew race. But the sudden transfer of such a multitude under\r\nconditions that tend to strip them of their small accumulations and to\r\ndepress their energies and courage is neither good for them nor for us.\r\n\r\nThe banishment, whether by direct decree or by not less certain indirect\r\nmethods, of so large a number of men and women is not a local question.\r\nA decree to leave one country is in the nature of things an order to\r\nenter another--some other. This consideration, as well as the suggestion\r\nof humanity, furnishes ample ground for the remonstrances which we have\r\npresented to Russia, while our historic friendship for that Government\r\ncan not fail to give the assurance that our representations are those of\r\na sincere wellwisher.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua shows that\r\nmuch costly and necessary preparatory work has been done during the year\r\nin the construction of shops, railroad tracks, and harbor piers and\r\nbreakwaters, and that the work of canal construction has made some\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nI deem it to be a matter of the highest concern to the United States\r\nthat this canal, connecting the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans and giving to us a short water communication between our ports\r\nupon those two great seas, should be speedily constructed and at the\r\nsmallest practicable limit of cost. The gain in freights to the people\r\nand the direct saving to the Government of the United States in the use\r\nof its naval vessels would pay the entire cost of this work within a\r\nshort series of years. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows the\r\nsaving in our naval expenditures which would result.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Alabama (Mr. Morgan) in his argument upon this subject\r\nbefore the Senate at the last session did not overestimate the\r\nimportance of this work when he said that \"the canal is the most\r\nimportant subject now connected with the commercial growth and progress\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIf this work is to be promoted by the usual financial methods\r\nand without the aid of this Government, the expenditures in its\r\ninterest-bearing securities and stock will probably be twice the actual\r\ncost. This will necessitate higher tolls and constitute a heavy and\r\naltogether needless burden upon our commerce and that of the world.\r\nEvery dollar of the bonds and stock of the company should represent a\r\ndollar expended in the legitimate and economical prosecution of the\r\nwork. This is only possible by giving to the bonds the guaranty of the\r\nUnited States Government. Such a guaranty would secure the ready sale at\r\npar of a 3 per cent bond from time to time as the money was needed. I do\r\nnot doubt that built upon these business methods the canal would when\r\nfully inaugurated earn its fixed charges and operating expenses. But if\r\nits bonds are to be marketed at heavy discounts and every bond sold is\r\nto be accompanied by a gift of stock, as has come to be expected by\r\ninvestors in such enterprises, the traffic will be seriously burdened to\r\npay interest and dividends. I am quite willing to recommend Government\r\npromotion in the prosecution of a work which, if no other means offered\r\nfor securing its completion, is of such transcendent interest that the\r\nGovernment should, in my opinion, secure it by direct appropriations\r\nfrom its Treasury.\r\n\r\nA guaranty of the bonds of the canal company to an amount necessary\r\nto the completion of the canal could, I think, be so given as not to\r\ninvolve any serious risk of ultimate loss. The things to be carefully\r\nguarded are the completion of the work within the limits of the\r\nguaranty, the subrogation of the United States to the rights of the\r\nfirst-mortgage bondholders for any amounts it may have to pay, and in\r\nthe meantime a control of the stock of the company as a security against\r\nmismanagement and loss. I most sincerely hope that neither party nor\r\nsectional lines will be drawn upon this great American project, so full\r\nof interest to the people of all our States and so influential in its\r\neffects upon the prestige and prosperity of our common country.\r\n\r\nThe island of Navassa, in the West Indian group, has, under the\r\nprovisions of Title VII of the Revised Statutes, been recognized by\r\nthe President as appertaining to the United States. It contains guano\r\ndeposits, is owned by the Navassa Phosphate Company, and is occupied\r\nsolely by its employees. In September, 1889, a revolt took place among\r\nthese laborers, resulting in the killing of some of the agents of the\r\ncompany, caused, as the laborers claimed, by cruel treatment. These men\r\nwere arrested and tried in the United States court at Baltimore, under\r\nsection 5576 of the statute referred to, as if the offenses had been\r\ncommitted on board a merchant vessel of the United States on the high\r\nseas. There appeared on the trial and otherwise came to me such\r\nevidences of the bad treatment of the men that in consideration of this\r\nand of the fact that the men had no access to any public officer or\r\ntribunal for protection or the redress of their wrongs I commuted the\r\ndeath sentences that had been passed by the court upon three of them.\r\nIn April last my attention was again called to this island and to the\r\nunregulated condition of things there by a letter from a colored\r\nlaborer, who complained that he was wrongfully detained upon the island\r\nby the phosphate company after the expiration of his contract of\r\nservice. A naval vessel was sent to examine into the case of this man\r\nand generally into the condition of things on the island. It was found\r\nthat the laborer referred to had been detained beyond the contract limit\r\nand that a condition of revolt again existed among the laborers. A board\r\nof naval officers reported, among other things, as follows:\r\n\r\n  We would desire to state further that the discipline maintained on the\r\n  island seems to be that of a convict establishment without its comforts\r\n  and cleanliness, and that until more attention is paid to the shipping\r\n  of laborers by placing it under Government supervision to prevent\r\n  misunderstanding and misrepresentation, and until some amelioration is\r\n  shown in the treatment of the laborers, these disorders will be of\r\n  constant occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nI recommend legislation that shall place labor contracts upon this and\r\nother islands having the relation that Navassa has to the United States\r\nunder the supervision of a court commissioner, and that shall provide\r\nat the expense of the owners an officer to reside upon the island, with\r\npower to judge and adjust disputes and to enforce a just and humane\r\ntreatment of the employees. It is inexcusable that American laborers\r\nshould be left within our own jurisdiction without access to any\r\nGovernment officer or tribunal for their protection and the redress of\r\ntheir wrongs.\r\n\r\nInternational copyright has been secured, in accordance with the\r\nconditions of the act of March 3, 1891, with Belgium, France, Great\r\nBritain and the British possessions, and Switzerland, the laws of those\r\ncountries permitting to our citizens the benefit of copyright on\r\nsubstantially the same basis as to their own citizens or subjects.\r\n\r\nWith Germany a special convention has been negotiated upon this subject\r\nwhich will bring that country within the reciprocal benefits of our\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe general interest in the operations of the Treasury Department has\r\nbeen much augmented during the last year by reason of the conflicting\r\npredictions, which accompanied and followed the tariff and other\r\nlegislation of the last Congress affecting the revenues, as to the\r\nresults of this legislation upon the Treasury and upon the country. On\r\nthe one hand it was contended that imports would so fall off as to leave\r\nthe Treasury bankrupt and that the prices of articles entering into the\r\nliving of the people would be so enhanced as to disastrously affect\r\ntheir comfort and happiness, while on the other it was argued that the\r\nloss to the revenue, largely the result of placing sugar on the free\r\nlist, would be a direct gain to the people; that the prices of the\r\nnecessaries of life, including those most highly protected, would not be\r\nenhanced; that labor would have a larger market and the products of the\r\nfarm advanced prices, while the Treasury surplus and receipts would be\r\nadequate to meet the appropriations, including the large exceptional\r\nexpenditures for the refunding to the States of the direct tax and the\r\nredemption of the 4-1/2 per cent bonds.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to enter at any length into a discussion of\r\nthe effects of the legislation to which I have referred; but a brief\r\nexamination of the statistics of the Treasury and a general glance at\r\nthe state of business throughout the country will, I think, satisfy\r\nany impartial inquirer that its results have disappointed the evil\r\nprophecies of its opponents and in a large measure realized the hopeful\r\npredictions of its friends. Rarely, if ever before, in the history of\r\nthe country has there been a time when the proceeds of one day's labor\r\nor the product of one farmed acre would purchase so large an amount of\r\nthose things that enter into the living of the masses of the people.\r\nI believe that a full test will develop the fact that the tariff act of\r\nthe Fifty-first Congress is very favorable in its average effect upon\r\nthe prices of articles entering into common use.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve months from October 1, 1890, to September 30, 1891,\r\nthe total value of our foreign commerce (imports and exports combined)\r\nwas $1,747,806,406, which was the largest of any year in the history of\r\nthe United States. The largest in any previous year was in 1890, when\r\nour commerce amounted to $1,647,139,093, and the last year exceeds this\r\nenormous aggregate by over one hundred millions. It is interesting,\r\nand to some will be surprising, to know that during the year ending\r\nSeptember 30, 1891, our imports of merchandise amounted to $824,715,270.\r\nwhich was an increase of more than $11,000,000 over the value of the\r\nimports of the corresponding months of the preceding year, when the\r\nimports of merchandise were unusually large in anticipation of the\r\ntariff legislation then pending. The average annual value of the imports\r\nof merchandise for the ten years from 1881 to 1890 was $692,186,522, and\r\nduring the year ending September 30, 1891, this annual average was\r\nexceeded by $132,528,469.\r\n\r\nThe value of free imports during the twelve months ending September 30,\r\n1891, was $118,092,387 more than the value of free imports during the\r\ncorresponding twelve months of the preceding year, and there was during\r\nthe same period a decrease of $106,846,508 in the value of imports of\r\ndutiable merchandise. The percentage of merchandise admitted free of\r\nduty during the year to which I have referred, the first under the new\r\ntariff, was 48.18, while during the preceding twelve months, under the\r\nold tariff, the percentage was 34.27, an increase of 13.91 per cent.\r\nIf we take the six months ending September 30 last, which covers the\r\ntime during which sugars have been admitted free of duty, the per cent\r\nof value of merchandise imported free of duty is found to be 55.37,\r\nwhich is a larger percentage of free imports than during any prior\r\nfiscal year in the history of the Government.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to exports of merchandise, the statistics are full of\r\ngratification. The value of such exports of merchandise for the twelve\r\nmonths ending September 30, 1891, was $923,091,136, while for the\r\ncorresponding previous twelve months it was $860,177,115, an increase\r\nof $62,914,021, which is nearly three times the average annual increase\r\nof exports of merchandise for the preceding twenty years. This exceeds\r\nin amount and value the exports of merchandise during any year in the\r\nhistory of the Government. The increase in the value of exports of\r\nagricultural products during the year referred to over the corresponding\r\ntwelve months of the prior year was $45,846,197, while the increase in\r\nthe value of exports of manufactured products was $16,838,240.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly nothing in the condition of trade, foreign or\r\ndomestic, there is certainly nothing in the condition of our people of\r\nany class, to suggest that the existing tariff and revenue legislation\r\nbears oppressively upon the people or retards the commercial development\r\nof the nation. It may be argued that our condition would be better if\r\ntariff legislation were upon a free-trade basis; but it can not be\r\ndenied that all the conditions of prosperity and of general contentment\r\nare present in a larger degree than ever before in our history, and\r\nthat, too, just when it was prophesied they would be in the worst state.\r\nAgitation for radical changes in tariff and financial legislation can\r\nnot help but may seriously impede business, to the prosperity of which\r\nsome degree of stability in legislation is essential.\r\n\r\nI think there are conclusive evidences that the new tariff has created\r\nseveral great industries, which will within a few years give employment\r\nto several hundred thousand American working men and women. In view of\r\nthe somewhat overcrowded condition of the labor market of the United\r\nStates, every patriotic citizen should rejoice at such a result.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows that the total\r\nreceipts of the Government from all sources for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1891, were $458,544,233.03, while the expenditures for the same\r\nperiod were $421,304,470.46, leaving a surplus of $37,239,762.57.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, actual and\r\nestimated, are $433,000,000 and the expenditures $409,000,000. For the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1893, the estimated receipts are\r\n$455,336,350 and the expenditures $441,300,093.\r\n\r\nUnder the law of July 14, 1890, the Secretary of the Treasury has\r\npurchased (since August 13) during the fiscal year 48,393,113 ounces of\r\nsilver bullion at an average cost of $1.045 per ounce. The highest price\r\npaid during the year was $1.2025 and the lowest $O.9636. In exchange for\r\nthis silver bullion there have been issued $50,577,498 of the Treasury\r\nnotes authorized by the act. The lowest price of silver reached during\r\nthe fiscal year was $O.9636 on April 22, 1891; but on November 1 the\r\nmarket price was only $O.96, which would give to the silver dollar a\r\nbullion value of 74-1/4 cents.\r\n\r\nBefore the influence of the prospective silver legislation was felt\r\nin the market silver was worth in New York about $O.955 per ounce.\r\nThe ablest advocates of free coinage in the last Congress were most\r\nconfident in their predictions that the purchases by the Government\r\nrequired by the law would at once bring the price of silver to $1.2929\r\nper ounce, which would make the bullion value of a dollar 100 cents and\r\nhold it there. The prophecies of the antisilver men of disasters to\r\nresult from the coinage of $2,000,000 per month were not wider of the\r\nmark. The friends of free silver are not agreed, I think, as to the\r\ncauses that brought their hopeful predictions to naught. Some facts are\r\nknown. The exports of silver from London to India during the first nine\r\nmonths of this calendar year fell off over 50 per cent, or $17,202,730,\r\ncompared with the same months of the preceding year. The exports of\r\ndomestic silver bullion from this country, which had averaged for the\r\nlast ten years over $17,000,000, fell in the last fiscal year to\r\n$13,797,391, while for the first time in recent years the imports of\r\nsilver into this country exceeded the exports by the sum of $2,745,365.\r\nIn the previous year the net exports of silver from the United States\r\namounted to $8,545,455. The production of the United States increased\r\nfrom 50,000,000 ounces in 1889 to 54,500,000 in 1890. The Government is\r\nnow buying and putting aside annually 54,000,000 ounces, which, allowing\r\nfor 7,140,000 ounces of new bullion used in the arts, is 6,640,000 more\r\nthan our domestic products available for coinage.\r\n\r\nI hope the depression in the price of silver is temporary and that a\r\nfurther trial of this legislation will more favorably affect it. That\r\nthe increased volume of currency thus supplied for the use of the people\r\nwas needed and that beneficial results upon trade and prices have\r\nfollowed this legislation I think must be very clear to everyone. Nor\r\nshould it be forgotten that for every dollar of these notes issued a\r\nfull dollar's worth of silver bullion is at the time deposited in the\r\nTreasury as a security for its redemption. Upon this subject, as upon\r\nthe tariff, my recommendation is that the existing laws be given a full\r\ntrial and that our business interests be spared the distressing\r\ninfluence which threats of radical changes always impart. Under existing\r\nlegislation it is in the power of the Treasury Department to maintain\r\nthat essential condition of national finance as well as of commercial\r\nprosperity--the parity in use of the coined dollars and their paper\r\nrepresentatives. The assurance that these powers would be freely and\r\nunhesitatingly used has done much to produce and sustain the present\r\nfavorable business conditions.\r\n\r\nI am still of the opinion that the free coinage of silver under existing\r\nconditions would disastrously affect our business interests at home and\r\nabroad. We could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing\r\npower of the gold and silver dollar in our own markets, and in foreign\r\ntrade the stamp gives no added value to the bullion contained in coins.\r\nThe producers of the country, its farmers and laborers, have the highest\r\ninterest that every dollar, paper or coin, issued by the Government\r\nshall be as good as any other. If there is one less valuable than\r\nanother, its sure and constant errand will be to pay them for their\r\ntoil and for their crops. The money lender will protect himself by\r\nstipulating for payment in gold, but the laborer has never been able to\r\ndo that. To place business upon a silver basis would mean a sudden and\r\nsevere contraction of the currency by the withdrawal of gold and gold\r\nnotes and such an unsettling of all values as would produce a commercial\r\npanic. I can not believe that a people so strong and prosperous as ours\r\nwill promote such a policy.\r\n\r\nThe producers of silver are entitled to just consideration, but they\r\nshould not forget that the Government is now buying and putting out of\r\nthe market what is the equivalent of the entire product of our silver\r\nmines. This is more than they themselves thought of asking two years\r\nago. I believe it is the earnest desire of a great majority of the\r\npeople, as it is mine, that a full coin use shall be made of silver\r\njust as soon as the cooperation of other nations can be secured and a\r\nratio fixed that will give circulation equally to gold and silver. The\r\nbusiness of the world requires the use of both metals; but I do not see\r\nany prospect of gain, but much of loss, by giving up the present system,\r\nin which a full use is made of gold and a large use of silver, for one\r\nin which silver alone will circulate. Such an event would be at once\r\nfatal to the further progress of the silver movement. Bimetallism is\r\nthe desired end, and the true friends of silver will be careful not to\r\noverrun the goal and bring in silver monometallism with its necessary\r\nattendants--the loss of our gold to Europe and the relief of the\r\npressure there for a larger currency. I have endeavored by the use of\r\nofficial and unofficial agencies to keep a close observation of the\r\nstate of public sentiment in Europe upon this question and have not\r\nfound it to be such as to justify me in proposing an international\r\nconference. There is, however, I am sure, a growing sentiment in Europe\r\nin favor of a larger use of silver, and I know of no more effectual way\r\nof promoting this sentiment than by accumulating gold here. A scarcity\r\nof gold in the European reserves will be the most persuasive argument\r\nfor the use of silver.\r\n\r\nThe exports of gold to Europe, which began in February last and\r\ncontinued until the close of July, aggregated over $70,000,000. The net\r\nloss of gold during the fiscal year was nearly $68,000,000. That no\r\nserious monetary disturbance resulted was most gratifying and gave to\r\nEurope fresh evidence of the strength and stability of our financial\r\ninstitutions. With the movement of crops the outflow of gold was\r\nspeedily stopped and a return set in. Up to December 1 we had recovered\r\nof our gold lost at the port of New York $27,854,000, and it is\r\nconfidently believed that during the winter and spring this aggregate\r\nwill be steadily and largely increased.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a large cash surplus in the Treasury has for many years\r\nbeen the subject of much unfavorable criticism, and has furnished an\r\nargument to those who have desired to place the tariff upon a purely\r\nrevenue basis. It was agreed by all that the withdrawal from circulation\r\nof so large an amount of money was an embarrassment to the business of\r\nthe country and made necessary the intervention of the Department at\r\nfrequent intervals to relieve threatened monetary panics. The surplus on\r\nMarch 1, 1889, was $183,827,190.29. The policy of applying this surplus\r\nto the redemption of the interest-bearing securities of the United\r\nStates was thought to be preferable to that of depositing it without\r\ninterest in selected national banks. There have been redeemed since\r\nthe date last mentioned of interest-bearing securities $259,079,350,\r\nresulting in a reduction of the annual interest charge of $11,684,675.\r\nThe money which had been deposited in banks without interest has been\r\ngradually withdrawn and used in the redemption of bonds.\r\n\r\nThe result of this policy, of the silver legislation, and of the\r\nrefunding of the 4-1/2 per cent bonds has been a large increase of\r\nthe money in circulation. At the date last named the circulation was\r\n$1,404,205,896, or $23.03 per capita, while on the 1st day of December,\r\n1891, it had increased to $1,577,262,070, or $24.38 per capita. The\r\noffer of the Secretary of the Treasury to the holders of the 4-1/2 per\r\ncent bonds to extend the time of redemption, at the option of the\r\nGovernment, at an interest of 2 per cent, was accepted by the holders of\r\nabout one-half the amount, and the unextended bonds are being redeemed\r\non presentation.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War exhibits the results of an\r\nintelligent, progressive, and businesslike administration of a\r\nDepartment which has been too much regarded as one of mere routine. The\r\nseparation of Secretary Proctor from the Department by reason of his\r\nappointment as a Senator from the State of Vermont is a source of great\r\nregret to me and to his colleagues in the Cabinet, as I am sure it will\r\nbe to all those who have had business with the Department while under\r\nhis charge.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of army affairs some especially good work has\r\nbeen accomplished. The efforts of the Secretary to reduce the percentage\r\nof desertions by removing the causes that promoted it have been so\r\nsuccessful as to enable him to report for the last year a lower\r\npercentage of desertion than has been before reached in the history\r\nof the Army. The resulting money saving is considerable, but the\r\nimprovement in the morale of the enlisted men is the most valuable\r\nincident of the reforms which have brought about this result.\r\n\r\nThe work of securing sites for shore batteries for harbor defense and\r\nthe manufacture of mortars and guns of high power to equip them have\r\nmade good progress during the year. The preliminary work of tests and\r\nplans which so long delayed a start is now out of the way. Some guns\r\nhave been completed, and with an enlarged shop and a more complete\r\nequipment at Watervliet the Army will soon be abreast of the Navy in gun\r\nconstruction. Whatever unavoidable causes of delay may arise, there\r\nshould be none from delayed or insufficient appropriations. We shall be\r\ngreatly embarrassed in the proper distribution and use of naval vessels\r\nuntil adequate shore defenses are provided for our harbors.\r\n\r\nI concur in the recommendation of the Secretary that the three-battalion\r\norganization be adopted for the infantry. The adoption of a smokeless\r\npowder and of a modern rifle equal in range, precision, and rapidity of\r\nfire to the best now in use will, I hope, not be longer delayed.\r\n\r\nThe project of enlisting Indians and organizing them into separate\r\ncompanies upon the same basis as other soldiers was made the subject\r\nof very careful study by the Secretary and received my approval. Seven\r\ncompanies have been completely organized and seven more are in process\r\nof organization. The results of six months' training have more than\r\nrealized the highest anticipations. The men are readily brought under\r\ndiscipline, acquire the drill with facility, and show great pride in the\r\nright discharge of their duty and perfect loyalty to their officers,\r\nwho declare that they would take them into action with confidence. The\r\ndiscipline, order, and cleanliness of the military posts will have a\r\nwholesome and elevating influence upon the men enlisted, and through\r\nthem upon their tribes, while a friendly feeling for the whites and\r\na greater respect for the Government will certainly be promoted.\r\n\r\nThe great work done in the Record and Pension Division of the War\r\nDepartment by Major Ainsworth, of the Medical Corps, and the clerks\r\nunder him is entitled to honorable mention. Taking up the work with\r\nnearly 41,000 cases behind, he closed the last fiscal year without a\r\nsingle case left over, though the new cases had increased 52 per cent\r\nin number over the previous year by reason of the pension legislation\r\nof the last Congress.\r\n\r\nI concur in the recommendation of the Attorney-General that the right in\r\nfelony cases to a review by the Supreme Court be limited. It would seem\r\nthat personal liberty would have a safe guaranty if the right of review\r\nin cases involving only fine and imprisonment were limited to the\r\ncircuit court of appeals, unless a constitutional question should in\r\nsome way be involved.\r\n\r\nThe judges of the Court of Private Land Claims, provided for by the act\r\nof March 3, 1891, have been appointed and the court organized. It is now\r\npossible to give early relief to communities long repressed in their\r\ndevelopment by unsettled land titles and to establish the possession and\r\nright of settlers whose lands have been rendered valueless by adverse\r\nand unfounded claims.\r\n\r\nThe act of July 9, 1888, provided for the incorporation and management\r\nof a reform school for girls in the District of Columbia; but it has\r\nremained inoperative for the reason that no appropriation has been made\r\nfor construction or maintenance. The need of such an institution is very\r\nurgent. Many girls could be saved from depraved lives by the wholesome\r\ninfluences and restraints of such a school. I recommend that the\r\nnecessary appropriation be made for a site and for construction.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement by the Treasury Department of the law prohibiting the\r\ncoming of Chinese to the United States has been effective as to such as\r\nseek to land from vessels entering our ports. The result has been to\r\ndivert the travel to vessels entering the ports of British Columbia,\r\nwhence passage into the United States at obscure points along the\r\nDominion boundary is easy. A very considerable number of Chinese\r\nlaborers have during the past year entered the United States from\r\nCanada and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Treasury Department and of the Department of Justice\r\nhave used every means at their command to intercept this immigration;\r\nbut the impossibility of perfectly guarding our extended frontier is\r\napparent. The Dominion government collects a head tax of $50 from every\r\nChinaman entering Canada, and thus derives a considerable revenue from\r\nthose who only use its ports to reach a position of advantage to evade\r\nour exclusion laws. There seems to be satisfactory evidence that the\r\nbusiness of passing Chinamen through Canada to the United States is\r\norganized and quite active. The Department of Justice has construed the\r\nlaws to require the return of any Chinaman found to be unlawfully in\r\nthis country to China as the country from which he came, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that he came by way of Canada; but several of the district\r\ncourts have in cases brought before them overruled this view of the\r\nlaw and decided that such persons must be returned to Canada. This\r\nconstruction robs the law of all effectiveness, even if the decrees\r\ncould be executed, for the men returned can the next day recross our\r\nborder. But the only appropriation made is for sending them back to\r\nChina, and the Canadian officials refuse to allow them to reenter\r\nCanada without the payment of the fifty-dollar head tax. I recommend\r\nsuch legislation as will remedy these defects in the law.\r\n\r\nIn previous messages I have called the attention of Congress to the\r\nnecessity of so extending the jurisdiction of the United States courts\r\nas to make triable therein any felony committed while in the act of\r\nviolating a law of the United States. These courts can not have that\r\nindependence and effectiveness which the Constitution contemplates so\r\nlong as the felonious killing of court officers, jurors, and witnesses\r\nin the discharge of their duties or by reason of their acts as\r\nsuch is only cognizable in the State courts. The work done by the\r\nAttorney-General and the officers of his Department, even under the\r\npresent inadequate legislation, has produced some notable results in\r\nthe interest of law and order.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General and also the Commissioners of the District of\r\nColumbia call attention to the defectiveness and inadequacy of the\r\nlaws relating to crimes against chastity in the District of Columbia.\r\nA stringent code upon this subject has been provided by Congress for\r\nUtah, and it is a matter of surprise that the needs of this District\r\nshould have been so long overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Postmaster-General some very gratifying results are\r\nexhibited and many betterments of the service suggested. A perusal of\r\nthe report gives abundant evidence that the supervision and direction\r\nof the postal system have been characterized by an intelligent and\r\nconscientious desire to improve the service. The revenues of the\r\nDepartment show an increase of over $5,000,000, with a deficiency for\r\nthe year 1892 of less than $4,000,000, while the estimate for the year\r\n1893 shows a surplus of receipts over expenditures.\r\n\r\nOcean mail post offices have been established upon the steamers of the\r\nNorth German Lloyd and Hamburg lines, saving by the distribution on\r\nshipboard from two to fourteen hours' time in the delivery of mail at\r\nthe port of entry and often much more than this in the delivery at\r\ninterior places. So thoroughly has this system, initiated by Germany and\r\nthe United States, evidenced its usefulness that it can not be long\r\nbefore it is installed upon all the great ocean mail-carrying\r\nsteamships.\r\n\r\nEight thousand miles of new postal service has been established upon\r\nrailroads, the car distribution to substations in the great cities has\r\nbeen increased about 12 per cent, while the percentage of errors in\r\ndistribution has during the past year been reduced over one-half. An\r\nappropriation was given by the last Congress for the purpose of making\r\nsome experiments in free delivery in the smaller cities and towns.\r\nThe results of these experiments have been so satisfactory that the\r\nPostmaster-General recommends, and I concur in the recommendation,\r\nthat the free-delivery system be at once extended to towns of 5,000\r\npopulation. His discussion of the inadequate facilities extended under\r\nour present system to rural communities and his suggestions with a view\r\nto give these communities a fuller participation in the benefits of the\r\npostal service are worthy of your careful consideration. It is not just\r\nthat the farmer, who receives his mail at a neighboring town, should\r\nnot only be compelled to send to the post-office for it, but to pay a\r\nconsiderable rent for a box in which to place it or to wait his turn at\r\na general-delivery window, while the city resident has his mail brought\r\nto his door. It is stated that over 54,000 neighborhoods are under the\r\npresent system receiving mail at post-offices where money orders and\r\npostal notes are not issued. The extension of this system to these\r\ncommunities is especially desirable, as the patrons of such offices\r\nare not possessed of the other facilities offered in more populous\r\ncommunities for the transmission of small sums of money.\r\n\r\nI have in a message to the preceding Congress expressed my views\r\nas to a modified use of the telegraph in connection with the postal\r\nservice.[23] In pursuance of the ocean mail law of March 3, 1891, and\r\nafter a most careful study of the whole subject and frequent conferences\r\nwith shipowners, boards of trade, and others, advertisements were issued\r\nby the Postmaster-General for 53 lines of ocean mail service--10 to\r\nGreat Britain and the Continent, 27 to South America, 3 to China and\r\nJapan, 4 to Australia and the Pacific islands, 7 to the West Indies,\r\nand 2 to Mexico. It was not, of course, expected that bids for all\r\nthese lines would be received or that service upon them all would be\r\ncontracted for. It was intended, in furtherance of the act, to secure as\r\nmany new lines as possible, while including in the list most or all of\r\nthe foreign lines now occupied by American ships. It was hoped that a\r\nline to England and perhaps one to the Continent would be secured; but\r\nthe outlay required to equip such lines wholly with new ships of the\r\nfirst class and the difficulty of establishing new lines in competition\r\nwith those already established deterred bidders whose interest had been\r\nenlisted. It is hoped that a way may yet be found of overcoming these\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe Brazil Steamship Company, by reason of a miscalculation as to\r\nthe speed of its vessels, was not able to bid under the terms of the\r\nadvertisement. The policy of the Department was to secure from the\r\nestablished lines an improved service as a condition of giving to them\r\nthe benefits of the law. This in all instances has been attained. The\r\nPostmaster-General estimates that an expenditure in American shipyards\r\nof about $10,000,000 will be necessary to enable the bidders to\r\nconstruct the ships called for by the service which they have accepted.\r\nI do not think there is any reason for discouragement or for any turning\r\nback from the policy of this legislation. Indeed, a good beginning has\r\nbeen made, and as the subject is further considered and understood by\r\ncapitalists and shipping people new lines will be ready to meet future\r\nproposals, and we may date from the passage of this law the revival of\r\nAmerican shipping interests and the recovery of a fair share of the\r\ncarrying trade of the world. We were receiving for foreign postage\r\nnearly $2,000,000 under the old system, and the outlay for ocean mail\r\nservice did not exceed $600,000 per annum. It is estimated by the\r\nPostmaster-General that if all the contracts proposed are completed it\r\nwill require $247,354 for this year in addition to the appropriation for\r\nsea and inland postage already in the estimates, and that for the next\r\nfiscal year, ending June 30, 1893, there would probably be needed about\r\n$560,000.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows a gratifying increase of\r\nnew naval vessels in commission. The _Newark, Concord, Bennington_, and\r\n_Miantonomoh_ have been added during the year, with an aggregate of\r\nsomething more than 11,000 tons. Twenty-four warships of all classes are\r\nnow under construction in the navy-yards and private shops; but while\r\nthe work upon them is going forward satisfactorily, the completion of\r\nthe more important vessels will yet require about a year's time. Some\r\nof the vessels now under construction, it is believed, will be triumphs\r\nof naval engineering. When it is recollected that the work of building\r\na modern navy was only initiated in the year 1883, that our naval\r\nconstructors and shipbuilders were practically without experience in the\r\nconstruction of large iron or steel ships, that our engine shops were\r\nunfamiliar with great marine engines, and that the manufacture of steel\r\nforgings for guns and plates was almost wholly a foreign industry,\r\nthe progress that has been made is not only highly satisfactory, but\r\nfurnishes the assurance that the United States will before long attain\r\nin the construction of such vessels, with their engines and armaments,\r\nthe same preeminence which it attained when the best instrument of ocean\r\ncommerce was the clipper ship and the most impressive exhibit of naval\r\npower the old wooden three-decker man-of-war. The officers of the Navy\r\nand the proprietors and engineers of our great private shops have\r\nresponded with wonderful intelligence and professional zeal to the\r\nconfidence expressed by Congress in its liberal legislation. We have now\r\nat Washington a gun shop, organized and conducted by naval officers,\r\nthat in its system, economy, and product is unexcelled. Experiments with\r\narmor plate have been conducted during the year with most important\r\nresults. It is now believed that a plate of higher resisting power than\r\nany in use has been found and that the tests have demonstrated that\r\ncheaper methods of manufacture than those heretofore thought necessary\r\ncan be used.\r\n\r\nI commend to your favorable consideration the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary, who has, I am sure, given to them the most conscientious\r\nstudy. There should be no hesitation in promptly completing a navy of\r\nthe best modern type large enough to enable this country to display its\r\nflag in all seas for the protection of its citizens and of its extending\r\ncommerce. The world needs no assurance of the peaceful purposes of the\r\nUnited States, but we shall probably be in the future more largely a\r\ncompetitor in the commerce of the world, and it is essential to the\r\ndignity of this nation and to that peaceful influence which it should\r\nexercise on this hemisphere that its Navy should be adequate both upon\r\nthe shores of the Atlantic and of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that a very gratifying\r\nprogress has been made in all of the bureaus which make up that complex\r\nand difficult Department.\r\n\r\nThe work in the Bureau of Indian Affairs was perhaps never so large as\r\nnow, by reason of the numerous negotiations which have been proceeding\r\nwith the tribes for a reduction of the reservations, with the incident\r\nlabor of making allotments, and was never more carefully conducted.\r\nThe provision of adequate school facilities for Indian children and the\r\nlocating of adult Indians upon farms involve the solution of the \"Indian\r\nquestion.\" Everything else--rations, annuities, and tribal negotiations,\r\nwith the agents, inspectors, and commissioners who distribute and\r\nconduct them--must pass away when the Indian has become a citizen,\r\nsecure in the individual ownership of a farm from which he derives his\r\nsubsistence by his own labor, protected by and subordinate to the laws\r\nwhich govern the white man, and provided by the General Government or\r\nby the local communities in which he lives with the means of educating\r\nhis children. When an Indian becomes a citizen in an organized State\r\nor Territory, his relation to the General Government ceases in great\r\nmeasure to be that of a ward; but the General Government ought not at\r\nonce to put upon the State or Territory the burden of the education of\r\nhis children.\r\n\r\nIt has been my thought that the Government schools and school buildings\r\nupon the reservations would be absorbed by the school systems of the\r\nStates and Territories; but as it has been found necessary to protect\r\nthe Indian against the compulsory alienation of his land by exempting\r\nhim from taxation for a period of twenty-five years, it would seem to\r\nbe right that the General Government, certainly where there are tribal\r\nfunds in its possession, should pay to the school fund of the State what\r\nwould be equivalent to the local school tax upon the property of the\r\nIndian. It will be noticed from the report of the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs that already some contracts have been made with district schools\r\nfor the education of Indian children. There is great advantage, I think,\r\nin bringing the Indian children into mixed schools. This process will\r\nbe gradual, and in the meantime the present educational provisions and\r\narrangements, the result of the best experience of those who have been\r\ncharged with this work, should be continued. This will enable those\r\nreligious bodies that have undertaken the work of Indian education with\r\nso much zeal and with results so restraining and beneficent to place\r\ntheir institutions in new and useful relations to the Indian and to his\r\nwhite neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak among the Sioux which occurred in December last is as to\r\nits causes and incidents fully reported upon by the War Department\r\nand the Department of the Interior. That these Indians had some\r\njust complaints, especially in the matter of the reduction of the\r\nappropriation for rations and in the delays attending the enactment of\r\nlaws to enable the Department to perform the engagements entered into\r\nwith them, is probably true; but the Sioux tribes are naturally warlike\r\nand turbulent, and their warriors were excited by their medicine men\r\nand chiefs, who preached the coming of an Indian messiah who was to\r\ngive them power to destroy their enemies. In view of the alarm that\r\nprevailed among the white settlers near the reservation and of the fatal\r\nconsequences that would have resulted from an Indian incursion, I placed\r\nat the disposal of General Miles, commanding the Division of the\r\nMissouri, all such forces as were thought by him to be required. He\r\nis entitled to the credit of having given thorough protection to the\r\nsettlers and of bringing the hostiles into subjection with the least\r\npossible loss of life.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of $2,991,450 for the Choctaws and Chickasaws\r\ncontained in the general Indian appropriation bill of March 3, 1891, has\r\nnot been expended, for the reason that I have not yet approved a release\r\n(to the Government) of the Indian claim to the lands mentioned. This\r\nmatter will be made the subject of a special message, placing before\r\nCongress all the facts which have come to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the Five Civilized Tribes now occupying the Indian\r\nTerritory to the United States is not, I believe, that best calculated\r\nto promote the highest advancement of these Indians. That there should\r\nbe within our borders five independent states having no relations,\r\nexcept those growing out of treaties, with the Government of the United\r\nStates, no representation in the National Legislature, its people not\r\ncitizens, is a startling anomaly.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be inevitable that there shall be before long some\r\norganic changes in the relation of these people to the United States.\r\nWhat form these changes should take I do not think it desirable now to\r\nsuggest, even if they were well defined in my own mind. They should\r\ncertainly involve the acceptance of citizenship by the Indians and a\r\nrepresentation in Congress. These Indians should have opportunity to\r\npresent their claims and grievances upon the floor rather than, as now,\r\nin the lobby. If a commission could be appointed to visit these tribes\r\nto confer with them in a friendly spirit upon this whole subject, even\r\nif no agreement were presently reached the feeling of the tribes upon\r\nthis question would be developed, and discussion would prepare the way\r\nfor changes which must come sooner or later.\r\n\r\nThe good work of reducing the larger Indian reservations by allotments\r\nin severalty to the Indians and the cession of the remaining lands to\r\nthe United States for disposition under the homestead law has been\r\nprosecuted during the year with energy and success. In September last I\r\nwas enabled to open to settlement in the Territory of Oklahoma 900,000\r\nacres of land, all of which was taken up by settlers in a single day.\r\nThe rush for these lands was accompanied by a great deal of excitement,\r\nbut was happily free from incidents of violence.\r\n\r\nIt was a source of great regret that I was not able to open at the\r\nsame time the surplus lands of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation,\r\namounting to about 3,000,000 acres, by reason of the insufficiency of\r\nthe appropriation for making the allotments. Deserving and impatient\r\nsettlers are waiting to occupy these lands, and I urgently recommend\r\nthat a special deficiency appropriation be promptly made of the small\r\namount needed, so that the allotments may be completed and the surplus\r\nlands opened in time to permit the settlers to get upon their homesteads\r\nin the early spring.\r\n\r\nDuring the past summer the Cherokee Commission have completed\r\narrangements with the Wichita, Kickapoo, and Tonkawa tribes whereby, if\r\nthe agreements are ratified by Congress, over 800,000 additional acres\r\nwill be opened to settlement in Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for the release by the Cherokees of their claim to\r\nthe Cherokee Strip have made no substantial progress so far as the\r\nDepartment is officially advised, but it is still hoped that the cession\r\nof this large and valuable tract may be secured. The price which the\r\ncommission was authorized to offer--$1.25 per acre--is, in my judgment,\r\nwhen all the circumstances as to title and the character of the lands\r\nare considered, a fair and adequate one, and should have been accepted\r\nby the Indians.\r\n\r\nSince March 4, 1889, about 23,000,000 acres have been separated from\r\nIndian reservations and added to the public domain for the use of those\r\nwho desired to secure free homes under our beneficent laws. It is\r\ndifficult to estimate the increase of wealth which will result from the\r\nconversion of these waste lands into farms, but it is more difficult\r\nto estimate the betterment which will result to the families that have\r\nfound renewed hope and courage in the ownership of a home and the\r\nassurance of a comfortable subsistence under free and healthful\r\nconditions. It is also gratifying to be able to feel, as we may, that\r\nthis work has proceeded upon lines of justice toward the Indian, and\r\nthat he may now, if he will, secure to himself the good influences of\r\na settled habitation, the fruits of industry, and the security of\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nEarly in this Administration a special effort was begun to bring up the\r\nwork of the General Land Office. By faithful work the arrearages have\r\nbeen rapidly reduced. At the end of the last fiscal year only 84,172\r\nfinal agricultural entries remained undisposed of, and the Commissioner\r\nreports that with the present force the work can be fully brought up by\r\nthe end of the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nYour attention is called to the difficulty presented by the Secretary\r\nof the Interior as to the administration of the law of March 3, 1891,\r\nestablishing a Court of Private Land Claims. The small holdings intended\r\nto be protected by the law are estimated to be more than 15,000 in\r\nnumber. The claimants are a most deserving class and their titles are\r\nsupported by the strongest equities. The difficulty grows out of the\r\nfact that the lands have largely been surveyed according to our methods,\r\nwhile the holdings, many of which have been in the same family for\r\ngenerations, are laid out in narrow strips a few rods wide upon a stream\r\nand running back to the hills for pasturage and timber. Provision should\r\nbe made for numbering these tracts as lots and for patenting them by\r\nsuch numbers and without reference to section lines.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the Pension Bureau has been characterized during\r\nthe year by great diligence. The total number of pensioners upon the\r\nroll on the 30th day of June, 1891, was 676,160. There were allowed\r\nduring the fiscal year ending at that time 250,565 cases. Of this number\r\n102,387 were allowed under the law of June 27, 1890. The issuing of\r\ncertificates has been proceeding at the rate of about 30,000 per month,\r\nabout 75 per cent of these being cases under the new law. The\r\nCommissioner expresses the opinion that he will be able to carefully\r\nadjudicate and allow 350,000 claims during the present fiscal year. The\r\nappropriation for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year 1890-91\r\nwas $127,685,793.89 and the amount expended $118,530,649.25, leaving an\r\nunexpended surplus of $9,155,144.64.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner is quite confident that there will be no call this year\r\nfor a deficiency appropriation, notwithstanding the rapidity with which\r\nthe work is being pushed. The mistake which has been made by many in\r\ntheir exaggerated estimates of the cost of pensions is in not taking\r\naccount of the diminished value of first payments under the recent\r\nlegislation. These payments under the general law have been for many\r\nyears very large, as the pensions when allowed dated from the time of\r\nfiling the claim, and most of these claims had been pending for years.\r\nThe first payments under the law of June, 1890, are relatively small,\r\nand as the per cent of these cases increases and that of the old cases\r\ndiminishes the annual aggregate of first payments is largely reduced.\r\nThe Commissioner, under date of November 13, furnishes me with the\r\nstatement that during the last four months 113,175 certificates were\r\nissued, 27,893 under the general law and 85,282 under the act of June\r\n27, 1890. The average first payment during these four months was\r\n$131.85, while the average first payment upon cases allowed during the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1891, was $239.33, being a reduction in the average\r\nfirst payments during these four months of $107.48.\r\n\r\nThe estimate for pension expenditures for the fiscal year ending June\r\n30, 1893, is $144,956,000, which, after a careful examination of the\r\nsubject, the Commissioner is of the opinion will be sufficient. While\r\nthese disbursements to the disabled soldiers of the great Civil War are\r\nlarge, they do not realize the exaggerated estimates of those who oppose\r\nthis beneficent legislation. The Secretary of the Interior shows with\r\ngreat fullness the care that is taken to exclude fraudulent claims, and\r\nalso the gratifying fact that the persons to whom these pensions are\r\ngoing are men who rendered not slight but substantial war service.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Railroads shows that the total debt of\r\nthe subsidized railroads to the United States was on December 31, 1890,\r\n$112,512,613.06. A large part of this debt is now fast approaching\r\nmaturity, with no adequate provision for its payment. Some policy for\r\ndealing with this debt with a view to its ultimate collection should be\r\nat once adopted. It is very difficult, well-nigh impossible, for so\r\nlarge a body as the Congress to conduct the necessary negotiations and\r\ninvestigations. I therefore recommend that provision be made for the\r\nappointment of a commission to agree upon and report a plan for dealing\r\nwith this debt.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Census Bureau is now far in advance and the great bulk\r\nof the enormous labor involved completed. It will be more strictly a\r\nstatistical exhibit and less encumbered by essays than its immediate\r\npredecessors. The methods pursued have been fair, careful, and\r\nintelligent, and have secured the approval of the statisticians who\r\nhave followed them with a scientific and nonpartisan interest. The\r\nappropriations necessary to the early completion and publication of the\r\nauthorized volumes should be given in time to secure against delays,\r\nwhich increase the cost and at the same time diminish the value of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary exhibits with interesting fullness the\r\ncondition of the Territories. They have shared with the States the great\r\nincrease in farm products, and are bringing yearly large areas into\r\ncultivation by extending their irrigating canals. This work is being\r\ndone by individuals or local corporations and without that system which\r\na full preliminary survey of the water supply and of the irrigable lands\r\nwould enable them to adopt. The future of the Territories of New Mexico,\r\nArizona, and Utah in their material growth and in the increase,\r\nindependence, and happiness of their people is very largely dependent\r\nupon wise and timely legislation, either by Congress or their own\r\nlegislatures, regulating the distribution of the water supply furnished\r\nby their streams. If this matter is much longer neglected, private\r\ncorporations will have unrestricted control of one of the elements of\r\nlife and the patentees of the arid lands will be tenants at will of the\r\nwater companies.\r\n\r\nThe United States should part with its ownership of the water sources\r\nand the sites for reservoirs, whether to the States and Territories or\r\nto individuals or corporations, only upon conditions that will insure to\r\nthe settlers their proper water supply upon equal and reasonable terms.\r\nIn the Territories this whole subject is under the full control of\r\nCongress, and in the States it is practically so as long as the\r\nGovernment holds the title to the reservoir sites and water sources\r\nand can grant them upon such conditions as it chooses to impose. The\r\nimprovident granting of franchises of enormous value without recompense\r\nto the State or municipality from which they proceed and without proper\r\nprotection of the public interests is the most noticeable and flagrant\r\nevil of modern legislation. This fault should not be committed in\r\ndealing with a subject that will before many years affect so vitally\r\nthousands of our people.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of Congress for the repression of polygamy has, after\r\nyears of resistance on the part of the Mormons, at last brought them to\r\nthe conclusion that resistance is unprofitable and unavailing. The power\r\nof Congress over this subject should not be surrendered until we have\r\nsatisfactory evidence that the people of the State to be created would\r\nexercise the exclusive power of the State over this subject in the same\r\nway. The question is not whether these people now obey the laws of\r\nCongress against polygamy, but rather would they make, enforce, and\r\nmaintain such laws themselves if absolutely free to regulate the\r\nsubject? We can not afford to experiment with this subject, for\r\nwhen a State is once constituted the act is final and any mistake\r\nirretrievable. No compact in the enabling act could, in my opinion,\r\nbe binding or effective.\r\n\r\nI recommend that provision be made for the organization of a simple form\r\nof town government in Alaska, with power to regulate such matters as\r\nare usually in the States under municipal control. These local civil\r\norganizations will give better protection in some matters than the\r\npresent skeleton Territorial organization. Proper restrictions as to\r\nthe power to levy taxes and to create debt should be imposed.\r\n\r\nIf the establishment of the Department of Agriculture was regarded by\r\nanyone as a mere concession to the unenlightened demand of a worthy\r\nclass of people, that impression has been most effectually removed by\r\nthe great results already attained. Its home influence has been very\r\ngreat in disseminating agricultural and horticultural information,\r\nin stimulating and directing a further diversification of crops, in\r\ndetecting and eradicating diseases of domestic animals, and, more than\r\nall, in the close and informal contact which it has established and\r\nmaintains with the farmers and stock raisers of the whole country. Every\r\nrequest for information has had prompt attention and every suggestion\r\nmerited consideration. The scientific corps of the Department is of a\r\nhigh order and is pushing its investigations with method and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe inspection by this Department of cattle and pork products intended\r\nfor shipment abroad has been the basis of the success which has attended\r\nour efforts to secure the removal of the restrictions maintained by the\r\nEuropean Governments.\r\n\r\nFor ten years protests and petitions upon this subject from the packers\r\nand stock raisers of the United States have been directed against these\r\nrestrictions, which so seriously limited our markets and curtailed the\r\nprofits of the farm. It is a source of general congratulation that\r\nsuccess has at last been attained, for the effects of an enlarged\r\nforeign market for these meats will be felt not only by the farmer, but\r\nin our public finances and in every branch of trade. It is particularly\r\nfortunate that the increased demand for food products resulting from the\r\nremoval of the restrictions upon our meats and from the reciprocal trade\r\narrangements to which I have referred should have come at a time when\r\nthe agricultural surplus is so large. Without the help thus derived\r\nlower prices would have prevailed. The Secretary of Agriculture\r\nestimates that the restrictions upon the importation of our pork\r\nproducts into Europe lost us a market for $20,000,000 worth of these\r\nproducts annually.\r\n\r\nThe grain crop of this year was the largest in our history--50 per cent\r\ngreater than that of last year--and yet the new markets that have been\r\nopened and the larger demand resulting from short crops in Europe have\r\nsustained prices to such an extent that the enormous surplus of meats\r\nand breadstuffs will be marketed at good prices, bringing relief and\r\nprosperity to an industry that was much depressed. The value of the\r\ngrain crop of the United States is estimated by the Secretary to be\r\nthis year $500,000,000 more than last; of meats $150,000,000 more, and\r\nof all products of the farm $700,000,000 more. It is not inappropriate,\r\nI think, here to suggest that our satisfaction in the contemplation of\r\nthis marvelous addition to the national wealth is unclouded by any\r\nsuspicion of the currency by which it is measured and in which the\r\nfarmer is paid for the products of his fields.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Civil Service Commission should receive the careful\r\nattention of the opponents as well as the friends of this reform. The\r\nCommission invites a personal inspection by Senators and Representatives\r\nof its records and methods, and every fair critic will feel that such\r\nan examination should precede a judgment of condemnation either of the\r\nsystem or its administration. It is not claimed that either is perfect,\r\nbut I believe that the law is being executed with impartiality and that\r\nthe system is incomparably better and fairer than that of appointments\r\nupon favor. I have during the year extended the classified service to\r\ninclude superintendents, teachers, matrons, and physicians in the Indian\r\nservice. This branch of the service is largely related to educational\r\nand philanthropic work and will obviously be the better for the change.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the several Executive Departments have been directed to\r\nestablish at once an efficiency record as the basis of a comparative\r\nrating of the clerks within the classified service, with a view to\r\nplacing promotions therein upon the basis of merit. I am confident\r\nthat such a record, fairly kept and open to the inspection of those\r\ninterested, will powerfully stimulate the work of the Departments and\r\nwill be accepted by all as placing the troublesome matter of promotions\r\nupon a just basis.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the appropriation for the Civil Service Commission be\r\nmade adequate to the increased work of the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nI have twice before urgently called the attention of Congress to the\r\nnecessity of legislation for the protection of the lives of railroad\r\nemployees, but nothing has yet been done. During the year ending June\r\n30, 1890, 369 brakemen were killed and 7,841 maimed while engaged in\r\ncoupling cars. The total number of railroad employees killed during\r\nthe year was 2,451 and the number injured 22,390. This is a cruel and\r\nlargely needless sacrifice. The Government is spending nearly $1,000,000\r\nannually to save the lives of shipwrecked seamen; every steam vessel\r\nis rigidly inspected and required to adopt the most approved safety\r\nappliances. All this is good. But how shall we excuse the lack of\r\ninterest and effort in behalf of this army of brave young men who in our\r\nland commerce are being sacrificed every year by the continued use of\r\nantiquated and dangerous appliances? A law requiring of every railroad\r\nengaged in interstate commerce the equipment each year of a given per\r\ncent of its freight cars with automatic couplers and air brakes would\r\ncompel an agreement between the roads as to the kind of brakes and\r\ncouplers to be used, and would very soon and very greatly reduce the\r\npresent fearful death rate among railroad employees.\r\n\r\nThe method of appointment by the States of electors of President and\r\nVice-President has recently attracted renewed interest by reason of a\r\ndeparture by the State of Michigan from the method which had become\r\nuniform in all the States. Prior to 1832 various methods had been\r\nused by the different States, and even by the same State. In some the\r\nchoice was made by the legislature; in others electors were chosen by\r\ndistricts, but more generally by the voters of the whole State upon a\r\ngeneral ticket. The movement toward the adoption of the last-named\r\nmethod had an early beginning and went steadily forward among the States\r\nuntil in 1832 there remained but a single State (South Carolina) that\r\nhad not adopted it. That State until the Civil War continued to choose\r\nits electors by a vote of the legislature, but after the war changed its\r\nmethod and conformed to the practice of the other States. For nearly\r\nsixty years all the States save one have appointed their electors by\r\na popular vote upon a general ticket, and for nearly thirty years this\r\nmethod was universal.\r\n\r\nAfter a full test of other methods, without important division or\r\ndissent in any State and without any purpose of party advantage, as\r\nwe must believe, but solely upon the considerations that uniformity\r\nwas desirable and that a general election in territorial divisions not\r\nsubject to change was most consistent with the popular character of our\r\ninstitutions, best preserved the equality of the voters, and perfectly\r\nremoved the choice of President from the baneful influence of the\r\n\"gerrymander,\" the practice of all the States was brought into harmony.\r\nThat this concurrence should now be broken is, I think, an unfortunate\r\nand even a threatening episode, and one that may well suggest whether\r\nthe States that still give their approval to the old and prevailing\r\nmethod ought not to secure by a constitutional amendment a practice\r\nwhich has had the approval of all. The recent Michigan legislation\r\nprovides for choosing what are popularly known as the Congressional\r\nelectors for President by Congressional districts and the two Senatorial\r\nelectors by districts created for that purpose. This legislation was, of\r\ncourse, accompanied by a new Congressional apportionment, and the two\r\nstatutes bring the electoral vote of the State under the influence of\r\nthe \"gerrymander.\"\r\n\r\nThese gerrymanders for Congressional purposes are in most cases\r\nbuttressed by a gerrymander of the legislative districts, thus making it\r\nimpossible for a majority of the legal voters of the State to correct\r\nthe apportionment and equalize the Congressional districts. A minority\r\nrule is established that only a political convulsion can overthrow. I\r\nhave recently been advised that in one county of a certain State three\r\ndistricts for the election of members of the legislature are constituted\r\nas follows: One has 65,000 population, one 15,000, and one 10,000, while\r\nin another county detached, noncontiguous sections have been united to\r\nmake a legislative district. These methods have already found effective\r\napplication to the choice of Senators and Representatives in Congress,\r\nand now an evil start has been made in the direction of applying them to\r\nthe choice by the States of electors of President and Vice-President. If\r\nthis is accomplished, we shall then have the three great departments of\r\nthe Government in the grasp of the \"gerrymander,\" the legislative and\r\nexecutive directly and the judiciary indirectly through the power of\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nAn election implies a body of electors having prescribed qualifications,\r\neach one of whom has an equal value and influence in determining the\r\nresult. So when the Constitution provides that \"each State shall\r\nappoint\" (elect), \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct,\r\na number of electors,\" etc., an unrestricted power was not given to the\r\nlegislatures in the selection of the methods to be used. \"A republican\r\nform of government\" is guaranteed by the Constitution to each State, and\r\nthe power given by the same instrument to the legislatures of the States\r\nto prescribe methods for the choice by the State of electors must be\r\nexercised under that limitation. The essential features of such a\r\ngovernment are the right of the people to choose their own officers and\r\nthe nearest practicable equality of value in the suffrages given in\r\ndetermining that choice.\r\n\r\nIt will not be claimed that the power given to the legislature would\r\nsupport a law providing that the persons receiving the smallest vote\r\nshould be the electors or a law that all the electors should be chosen\r\nby the voters of a single Congressional district. The State is to\r\nchoose, and under the pretense of regulating methods the legislature\r\ncan neither vest the right of choice elsewhere nor adopt methods not\r\nconformable to republican institutions. It is not my purpose here to\r\ndiscuss the question whether a choice by the legislature or by the\r\nvoters of equal single districts is a choice by the State, but only to\r\nrecommend such regulation of this matter by constitutional amendment as\r\nwill secure uniformity and prevent that disgraceful partisan jugglery\r\nto which such a liberty of choice, if it exists, offers a temptation.\r\n\r\nNothing just now is more important than to provide every guaranty for\r\nthe absolutely fair and free choice by an equal suffrage within the\r\nrespective States of all the officers of the National Government,\r\nwhether that suffrage is applied directly, as in the choice of members\r\nof the House of Representatives, or indirectly, as in the choice of\r\nSenators and electors of President. Respect for public officers and\r\nobedience to law will not cease to be the characteristics of our people\r\nuntil our elections cease to declare the will of majorities fairly\r\nascertained without fraud, suppression, or gerrymander. If I were\r\ncalled upon to declare wherein our chief national danger lies, I should\r\nsay without hesitation in the overthrow of majority control by the\r\nsuppression or perversion of the popular suffrage. That there is a real\r\ndanger here all must agree; but the energies of those who see it have\r\nbeen chiefly expended in trying to fix responsibility upon the opposite\r\nparty rather than in efforts to make such practices impossible by either\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible now to adjourn that interminable and inconclusive\r\ndebate while we take by consent one step in the direction of reform by\r\neliminating the gerrymander, which has been denounced by all parties as\r\nan influence in the selection of electors of President and members of\r\nCongress? All the States have, acting freely and separately, determined\r\nthat the choice of electors by a general ticket is the wisest and\r\nsafest method, and it would seem there could be no objection to a\r\nconstitutional amendment making that method permanent. If a legislature\r\nchosen in one year upon purely local questions should, pending a\r\nPresidential contest, meet, rescind the law for a choice upon a general\r\nticket, and provide for the choice of electors by the legislature, and\r\nthis trick should determine the result, it is not too much to say that\r\nthe public peace might be seriously and widely endangered.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the \"gerrymander\" as affecting the method of selecting\r\nelectors of President by Congressional districts, but the primary intent\r\nand effect of this form of political robbery have relation to the\r\nselection of members of the House of Representatives. The power of\r\nCongress is ample to deal with this threatening and intolerable abuse.\r\nThe unfailing test of sincerity in election reform will be found in a\r\nwillingness to confer as to remedies and to put into force such measures\r\nas will most effectually preserve the right of the people to free and\r\nequal representation.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made in the last Congress to bring to bear the\r\nconstitutional powers of the General Government for the correction\r\nof fraud against the suffrage. It is important to know whether the\r\nopposition to such measures is really rested in particular features\r\nsupposed to be objectionable or includes any proposition to give to\r\nthe election laws of the United States adequacy to the correction\r\nof grave and acknowledged evils. I must yet entertain the hope that\r\nit is possible to secure a calm, patriotic consideration of such\r\nconstitutional or statutory changes as may be necessary to secure\r\nthe choice of the officers of the Government to the people by fair\r\napportionments and free elections.\r\n\r\nI believe it would be possible to constitute a commission, nonpartisan\r\nin its membership and composed of patriotic, wise, and impartial men,\r\nto whom a consideration of the question of the evils connected with our\r\nelection system and methods might be committed with a good prospect of\r\nsecuring unanimity in some plan for removing or mitigating those evils.\r\nThe Constitution would permit the selection of the commission to be\r\nvested in the Supreme Court if that method would give the best guaranty\r\nof impartiality. This commission should be charged with the duty of\r\ninquiring into the whole subject of the law of elections as related\r\nto the choice of officers of the National Government, with a view to\r\nsecuring to every elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage\r\nand as near an approach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as\r\nis attainable.\r\n\r\nWhile the policies of the General Government upon the tariff, upon the\r\nrestoration of our merchant marine, upon river and harbor improvements,\r\nand other such matters of grave and general concern are liable to be\r\nturned this way or that by the results of Congressional elections and\r\nadministrative policies, sometimes involving issues that tend to peace\r\nor war, to be turned this way or that by the results of a Presidential\r\nelection, there is a rightful interest in all the States and in every\r\nCongressional district that will not be deceived or silenced by the\r\naudacious pretense that the question of the right of any body of legal\r\nvoters in any State or in any Congressional district to give their\r\nsuffrages freely upon these general questions is a matter only of local\r\nconcern or control. The demand that the limitations of suffrage shall\r\nbe found in the law, and only there, is a just demand, and no just man\r\nshould resent or resist it. My appeal is and must continue to be for\r\na consultation that shall \"proceed with candor, calmness, and patience\r\nupon the lines of justice and humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty.\"\r\n\r\nTo the consideration of these very grave questions I invite not only the\r\nattention of Congress, but that of all patriotic citizens. We must not\r\nentertain the delusion that our people have ceased to regard a free\r\nballot and equal representation as the price of their allegiance to\r\nlaws and to civil magistrates.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly rejoiced to notice many evidences of the increased\r\nunification of our people and of a revived national spirit. The vista\r\nthat now opens to us is wider and more glorious than ever before.\r\nGratification and amazement struggle for supremacy as we contemplate\r\nthe population, wealth, and moral strength of our country. A trust\r\nmomentous in its influence upon our people and upon the world is for\r\na brief time committed to us, and we must not be faithless to its first\r\ncondition--the defense of the free and equal influence of the people in\r\nthe choice of public officers and in the control of public affairs.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 5, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe famine prevailing in some of the Provinces of Russia is so severe\r\nand widespread as to have attracted the sympathetic interest of a\r\nlarge number of our liberal and favored people. In some of the great\r\ngrain-producing States of the West movements have already been organized\r\nto collect flour and meal for the relief of these perishing Russian\r\nfamilies, and the response has been such as to justify the belief that\r\na ship's cargo can very soon be delivered at the seaboard through the\r\ngenerous cooperation of the transportation lines. It is most appropriate\r\nthat a people whose storehouses have been so lavishly filled with all\r\nthe fruits of the earth by the gracious favor of God should manifest\r\ntheir gratitude by large gifts to His suffering children in other lands.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy has no steam vessel at his disposal that\r\ncould be used for the transportation of these supplies, and I therefore\r\nrecommend that he be authorized to charter a suitable vessel to receive\r\nthem if a sufficient amount should be offered, and to send them under\r\nthe charge of a naval officer to such Russian port as may be most\r\nconvenient for ready distribution to those most in need.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

It is reported\r\n  unofficially that the investigation is about completed, and it is\r\n  expected that the result will soon be communicated to this Government,\r\n  together with some adequate and satisfactory response to the note by\r\n  which the attention of Chile was called to this incident. If these\r\n  just expectations should be disappointed or further needless delay\r\n  intervene, I will by a special message bring this matter again to the\r\n  attention of Congress for such action as may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the time has now come when I should lay before the\r\nCongress and the country the correspondence between this Government\r\nand the Government of Chile from the time of the breaking out of the\r\nrevolution against Balmaceda, together with all other facts in the\r\npossession of the executive department relating to this matter. The\r\ndiplomatic correspondence is herewith transmitted, together with some\r\ncorrespondence between the naval officers for the time in command in\r\nChilean waters and the Secretary of the Navy, and also the evidence\r\ntaken at the Mare Island Navy-Yard since the arrival of the _Baltimore_\r\nat San Francisco. I do not deem it necessary in this communication to\r\nattempt any full analysis of the correspondence or of the evidence.\r\nA brief restatement of the international questions involved and of the\r\nreasons why the responses of the Chilean Government are unsatisfactory\r\nis all that I deem necessary.\r\n\r\nIt may be well at the outset to say that whatever may have been said\r\nin this country or in Chile in criticism of Mr. Egan, our minister at\r\nSantiago, the true history of this exciting period in Chilean affairs\r\nfrom the outbreak of the revolution until this time discloses no act on\r\nthe part of Mr. Egan unworthy of his position or that could justly be\r\nthe occasion of serious animadversion or criticism. He has, I think,\r\non the whole borne himself in very trying circumstances with dignity,\r\ndiscretion, and courage, and has conducted the correspondence with\r\nability, courtesy, and fairness.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while also at the beginning to say that the right of\r\nMr. Egan to give shelter in the legation to certain adherents of the\r\nBalmaceda Government who applied to him for asylum has not been denied\r\nby the Chilean authorities, nor has any demand been made for the\r\nsurrender of these refugees. That there was urgent need of asylum is\r\nshown by Mr. Egan's note of August 24, 1891, describing the disorders\r\nthat prevailed in Santiago, and by the evidence of Captain Schley\r\nas to the pillage and violence that prevailed at Valparaiso. The\r\ncorrespondence discloses, however, that the request of Mr. Egan for a\r\nsafe conduct from the country in behalf of these refugees was denied.\r\nThe precedents cited by him in the correspondence, particularly the case\r\nof the revolution in Peru in 1865, did not leave the Chilean Government\r\nin a position to deny the right of asylum to political refugees, and\r\nseemed very clearly to support Mr. Egan's contention that a safe conduct\r\nto neutral territory was a necessary and acknowledged incident of the\r\nasylum. These refugees have very recently, without formal safe conduct,\r\nbut by the acquiescence of the Chilean authorities, been placed on\r\nboard the _Yorktown_, and are now being conveyed to Callao, Peru.\r\nThis incident might be considered wholly closed but for the disrespect\r\nmanifested toward this Government by the close and offensive police\r\nsurveillance of the legation premises which was maintained during most\r\nof the period of the stay of the refugees therein. After the date of my\r\nannual message, and up to the time of the transfer of the refugees to\r\nthe _Yorktown_, the legation premises seemed to have been surrounded by\r\npolice in uniform and police agents or detectives in citizen's dress,\r\nwho offensively scrutinized persons entering or leaving the legation,\r\nand on one or more occasions arrested members of the minister's family.\r\nCommander Evans, who by my direction recently visited Mr. Egan at\r\nSantiago, in his telegram to the Navy Department described the legation\r\nas \"a veritable prison,\" and states that the police agents or detectives\r\nwere after his arrival withdrawn during his stay. It appears further\r\nfrom the note of Mr. Egan of November 20, 1891, that on one occasion at\r\nleast these police agents, whom he declares to be known to him, invaded\r\nthe legation premises, pounding upon its windows and using insulting and\r\nthreatening language toward persons therein. This breach of the right\r\nof a minister to freedom from police espionage and restraint seems to\r\nhave been so flagrant that the Argentine minister, who was dean of\r\nthe diplomatic corps, having observed it, felt called upon to protest\r\nagainst it to the Chilean minister of foreign affairs. The Chilean\r\nauthorities have, as will be observed from the correspondence, charged\r\nthe refugees and the inmates of the legation with insulting the police;\r\nbut it seems to me incredible that men whose lives were in jeopardy and\r\nwhose safety could only be secured by retirement and quietness should\r\nhave sought to provoke a collision, which could only end in their\r\ndestruction, or to aggravate their condition by intensifying a popular\r\nfeeling that at one time so threatened the legation as to require Mr.\r\nEgan to appeal to the minister of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nBut the most serious incident disclosed by the correspondence is that\r\nof the attack upon the sailors of the _Baltimore_ in the streets of\r\nValparaiso on the 16th of October last. In my annual message, speaking\r\nupon the information then in my possession, I said:\r\n\r\n  So far as I have yet been able to learn, no other explanation of this\r\n  bloody work has been suggested than that it had its origin in hostility\r\n  to those men as sailors of the United States, wearing the uniform of\r\n  their Government, and not in any individual act or personal animosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now received from the Chilean Government an abstract of the\r\nconclusions of the fiscal general upon the testimony taken by the judge\r\nof crimes in an investigation which was made to extend over nearly three\r\nmonths. I very much regret to be compelled to say that this report does\r\nnot enable me to modify the conclusion announced in my annual message.\r\nI am still of the opinion that our sailors were assaulted, beaten,\r\nstabbed, and killed not for anything they or any one of them had done,\r\nbut for what the Government of the United States had done or was charged\r\nwith having done by its civil officers and naval commanders. If that be\r\nthe true aspect of the case, the injury was to the Government of the\r\nUnited States, not to these poor sailors who were assaulted in a manner\r\nso brutal and so cowardly.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to give an outline of the facts upon which this\r\nconclusion rests I think it right to say a word or two upon the legal\r\naspect of the case. The _Baltimore_ was in the harbor of Valparaiso by\r\nvirtue of that general invitation which nations are held to extend to\r\nthe war vessels of other powers with which they have friendly relations.\r\nThis invitation, I think, must be held ordinarily to embrace the\r\nprivilege of such communication with the shore as is reasonable,\r\nnecessary, and proper for the comfort and convenience of the officers\r\nand men of such vessels. Captain Schley testifies that when his vessel\r\nreturned to Valparaiso on September 14 the city officers, as is\r\ncustomary, extended the hospitalities of the city to his officers and\r\ncrew. It is not claimed that every personal collision or injury in which\r\na sailor or officer of such naval vessel visiting the shore may be\r\ninvolved raises an international question, but I am clearly of the\r\nopinion that where such sailors or officers are assaulted by a resident\r\npopulace, animated by hostility to the government whose uniform these\r\nsailors and officers wear and in resentment of acts done by their\r\ngovernment, not by them, their nation must take notice of the event\r\nas one involving an infraction of its rights and dignity, not in a\r\nsecondary way, as where a citizen is injured and presents his claim\r\nthrough his own government, but in a primary way, precisely as if its\r\nminister or consul or the flag itself had been the object of the same\r\ncharacter of assault.\r\n\r\nThe officers and sailors of the _Baltimore_ were in the harbor of\r\nValparaiso under the orders of their Government, not by their own\r\nchoice. They were upon the shore by the implied invitation of the\r\nGovernment of Chile and with the approval of their commanding officer;\r\nand it does not distinguish their case from that of a consul that his\r\nstay is more permanent or that he holds the express invitation of the\r\nlocal government to justify his longer residence. Nor does it affect\r\nthe question that the injury was the act of a mob. If there had been\r\nno participation by the police or military in this cruel work and no\r\nneglect on their part to extend protection, the case would still be one,\r\nin my opinion, when its extent and character are considered, involving\r\ninternational rights. The incidents of the affair are briefly as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of October last Captain Schley, commanding the United States\r\nsteamship _Baltimore_, gave shore leave to 117 petty officers and\r\nsailors of his ship. These men left the ship about 1.30 p.m. No incident\r\nof violence occurred, none of our men were arrested, no complaint was\r\nlodged against them, nor did any collision or outbreak occur until about\r\n6 o'clock p.m. Captain Schley states that he was himself on shore and\r\nabout the streets of the city until 5.30 p.m.; that he met very many of\r\nhis men who were upon leave; that they were sober and were conducting\r\nthemselves with propriety, saluting Chilean and other officers as they\r\nmet them. Other officers of the ship and Captain Jenkins, of the\r\nmerchant ship _Keweenaw_, corroborate Captain Schley as to the general\r\nsobriety and good behavior of our men. The Sisters of Charity at the\r\nhospital to which our wounded men were taken when inquired of stated\r\nthat they were sober when received. If the situation had been otherwise,\r\nwe must believe that the Chilean police authorities would have made\r\narrests. About 6 p.m. the assault began, and it is remarkable that the\r\ninvestigation by the judge of crimes, though so protracted, does not\r\nenable him to give any more satisfactory account of its origin than is\r\nfound in the statement that it began between drunken sailors. Repeatedly\r\nin the correspondence it is asserted that it was impossible to learn\r\nthe precise cause of the riot. The minister of foreign affairs, Matta,\r\nin his telegram to Mr. Montt under date December 31, states that the\r\nquarrel began between two sailors in a tavern and was continued in the\r\nstreet, persons who were passing joining in it.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Talbot, an apprentice, who was with Riggin, is that\r\nthe outbreak in which they were involved began by a Chilean sailor's\r\nspitting in the face of Talbot, which was resented by a knockdown. It\r\nappears that Riggin and Talbot were at the time unaccompanied by others\r\nof their shipmates. These two men were immediately beset by a crowd of\r\nChilean citizens and sailors, through which they broke their way to a\r\nstreet car, and entered it for safety. They were pursued, driven from\r\nthe car, and Riggin was so seriously beaten that he fell in the street\r\napparently dead. There is nothing in the report of the Chilean\r\ninvestigation made to us that seriously impeaches this testimony. It\r\nappears from Chilean sources that almost instantly, with a suddenness\r\nthat strongly implies meditation and preparation, a mob, stated by the\r\npolice authorities at one time to number 2,000 and at another 1,000,\r\nwas engaged in the assault upon our sailors, who are represented as\r\nresisting \"with stones, clubs, and bright arms.\" The report of the\r\n_intendente_ of October 30 states that the fight began at 6 p.m. in\r\nthree streets, which are named; that information was received at the\r\n_intendencia_ at 6.15, and that the police arrived on the scene at 6.30,\r\na full half hour after the assault began. At that time he says that a\r\nmob of 2,000 men had collected, and that for several squares there was\r\nthe appearance of a \"real battlefield.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene at this point is very graphically set before us by the Chilean\r\ntestimony. The American sailors, who after so long an examination have\r\nnot been found guilty of any breach of the peace so far as the Chilean\r\nauthorities are able to discover, unarmed and defenseless, are fleeing\r\nfor their lives, pursued by overwhelming numbers, and fighting only to\r\naid their own escape from death or to succor some mate whose life is in\r\ngreater peril. Eighteen of them are brutally stabbed and beaten, while\r\none Chilean seems from the report to have suffered some injury, but how\r\nserious or with what character of weapon, or whether by a missile thrown\r\nby our men or by some of his fellow-rioters, is unascertained.\r\n\r\nThe pretense that our men were fighting \"with stones, clubs, and bright\r\narms\" is in view of these facts incredible. It is further refuted by the\r\nfact that our prisoners when searched were absolutely without arms, only\r\nseven penknives being found in the possession of the men arrested, while\r\nthere were received by our men more than thirty stab wounds, every one\r\nof which was inflicted in the back, and almost every contused wound was\r\nin the back or back of the head; The evidence of the ship's officer of\r\nthe day is that even the jackknives of the men were taken from them\r\nbefore leaving the ship.\r\n\r\nAs to the brutal nature of the treatment received by our men, the\r\nfollowing extract from the account given of the affair by the La Patria\r\nnewspaper, of Valparaiso, of October 17, can not be regarded as too\r\nfriendly:\r\n\r\n  The Yankees, as soon as their pursuers gave chase, went by way of the\r\n  Calle del Arsenal toward the city car station. In the presence of an\r\n  ordinary number of citizens, among whom were some sailors, the North\r\n  Americans took seats in the street car to escape from the stones which\r\n  the Chileans threw at them. It was believed for an instant that the\r\n  North Americans had saved themselves from popular fury, but such was\r\n  not the case. Scarcely had the car begun to move when a crowd gathered\r\n  around and stopped its progress. Under these circumstances and without\r\n  any cessation of the howling and throwing of stones at the North\r\n  Americans, the conductor entered the car, and, seeing the risk of the\r\n  situation to the vehicle, ordered them to get out. At the instant the\r\n  sailors left the car, in the midst of a hail of stones, the said\r\n  conductor received a stone blow on the head. One of the Yankee sailors\r\n  managed to escape in the direction of the Plaza Wheelright, but the\r\n  other was felled to the ground by a stone. Managing to raise himself\r\n  from the ground where he lay, he staggered in an opposite direction\r\n  from the station. In front of the house of Señor Mazzini he was again\r\n  wounded, falling then senseless and breathless.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo amount of evasion or subterfuge is able to cloud our clear vision\r\nof this brutal work. It should be noticed in this connection that the\r\nAmerican sailors arrested, after an examination, were during the four\r\ndays following the arrest every one discharged, no charge of any breach\r\nof the peace or other criminal conduct having been sustained against\r\na single one of them. The judge of crimes, Foster, in a note to the\r\n_intendente_ under date of October 22, before the dispatch from this\r\nGovernment of the following day, which aroused the authorities of Chile\r\nto a better sense of the gravity of the affair, says:\r\n\r\n  Having presided temporarily over this court in regard to the seamen of\r\n  the United States cruiser _Baltimore_, who have been tried on account\r\n  of the deplorable conduct which took place, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe noticeable point here is that our sailors had been tried before\r\nthe 22d of October, and that the trial resulted in their acquittal and\r\nreturn to their vessel. It is quite remarkable and quite characteristic\r\nof the management of this affair by the Chilean police authorities that\r\nwe should now be advised that Seaman Davidson, of the _Baltimore_, has\r\nbeen included in the indictment, his offense being, so far as I have\r\nbeen able to ascertain, that he attempted to defend a shipmate against\r\nan assailant who was striking at him with a knife. The perfect\r\nvindication of our men is furnished by this report. One only is found\r\nto have been guilty of criminal fault, and that for an act clearly\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\nAs to the part taken by the police in the affair, the case made by Chile\r\nis also far from satisfactory. The point where Riggin was killed is only\r\nthree minutes' walk from the police station, and not more than twice\r\nthat distance from the _intendencia_; and yet according to their\r\nofficial report a full half hour elapsed after the assault began before\r\nthe police were upon the ground. It has been stated that all but two of\r\nour men have said that the police did their duty. The evidence taken at\r\nMare Island shows that if such a statement was procured from our men it\r\nwas accomplished by requiring them to sign a writing in a language they\r\ndid not understand and by the representation that it was a mere\r\ndeclaration that they had taken no part in the disturbance. Lieutenant\r\nMcCrea, who acted as interpreter, says in his evidence that when our\r\nsailors were examined before the court the subject of the conduct of the\r\npolice was so carefully avoided that he reported the fact to Captain\r\nSchley on his return, to the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of the existence of animosity toward our sailors in\r\nthe minds of the sailors of the Chilean navy and of the populace of\r\nValparaiso are so abundant and various as to leave no doubt in the mind\r\nof anyone who will examine the papers submitted. It manifested itself\r\nin threatening and insulting gestures toward our men as they passed\r\nthe Chilean men-of-war in their boats and in the derisive and abusive\r\nepithets with which they greeted every appearance of an American sailor\r\non the evening of the riot. Captain Schley reports that boats from the\r\nChilean war ships several times went out of their course to cross the\r\nbows of his boats, compelling them to back water. He complained of the\r\ndiscourtesy, and it was corrected. That this feeling was shared by men\r\nof higher rank is shown by an incident related by Surgeon Stitt, of\r\nthe _Baltimore_. After the battle of Placilla he, with other medical\r\nofficers of the war vessels in the harbor, was giving voluntary\r\nassistance to the wounded in the hospitals. The son of a Chilean army\r\nofficer of high rank was under his care, and when the father discovered\r\nit he flew into a passion and said he would rather have his son die than\r\nhave Americans touch him, and at once had him removed from the ward.\r\nThis feeling is not well concealed in the dispatches of the foreign\r\noffice, and had quite open expression in the disrespectful treatment of\r\nthe American legation. The Chilean boatmen in the bay refused, even for\r\nlarge offers of money, to return our sailors, who crowded the Mole,\r\nto their ship when they were endeavoring to escape from the city on\r\nthe night of the assault. The market boats of the _Baltimore_ were\r\nthreatened, and even quite recently the gig of Commander Evans, of\r\nthe _Yorktown_, was stoned while waiting for him at the Mole.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of our sailors clearly shows that the attack was expected\r\nby the Chilean people, that threats had been made against our men, and\r\nthat in one case, somewhat early in the afternoon, the keeper of one\r\nhouse into which some of our men had gone closed his establishment in\r\nanticipation of the attack, which he advised them would be made upon\r\nthem as darkness came on.\r\n\r\nIn a report of Captain Schley to the Navy Department he says:\r\n\r\n  In the only interview that I had with Judge Foster, who is\r\n  investigating the case relative to the disturbance, before he was aware\r\n  of the entire gravity of the matter, he informed me that the assault\r\n  upon my men was the outcome of hatred for our people among the lower\r\n  classes because they thought we had sympathized with the Balmaceda\r\n  Government on account of the _Itata_ matter, whether with reason or\r\n  without he could of course not admit; but such he thought was the\r\n  explanation of the assault at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral of our men sought security from the mob by such complete or\r\npartial changes in their dress as would conceal the fact of their being\r\nseamen of the _Baltimore_, and found it then possible to walk the\r\nstreets without molestation. These incidents conclusively establish that\r\nthe attack was upon the uniform--the nationality--and not upon the men.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this feeling is probably found in the refusal of this\r\nGovernment to give recognition to the Congressional party before it\r\nhad established itself, in the seizure of the _Itata_ for an alleged\r\nviolation of the neutrality law, in the cable incident, and in the\r\ncharge that Admiral Brown conveyed information to Valparaiso of the\r\nlanding at Quinteros. It is not my purpose to enter here any defense of\r\nthe action of this Government in these matters. It is enough for the\r\npresent purpose to say that if there was any breach of international\r\ncomity or duty on our part it should have been made the subject of\r\nofficial complaint through diplomatic channels or for reprisals for\r\nwhich a full responsibility was assumed. We can not consent that these\r\nincidents and these perversions of the truth shall be used to excite\r\na murderous attack upon our unoffending sailors and the Government\r\nof Chile go aquit of responsibility. In fact, the conduct of this\r\nGovernment during the war in Chile pursued those lines of international\r\nduty which we had so strongly insisted upon on the part of other nations\r\nwhen this country was in the throes of a civil conflict. We continued\r\nthe established diplomatic relations with the government in power until\r\nit was overthrown, and promptly and cordially recognized the new\r\ngovernment when it was established. The good offices of this Government\r\nwere offered to bring about a peaceful adjustment, and the interposition\r\nof Mr. Egan to mitigate severities and to shelter adherents of the\r\nCongressional party was effective and frequent. The charge against\r\nAdmiral Brown is too base to gain credence with anyone who knows his\r\nhigh personal and professional character.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the evidence of our sailors, I think it is shown that there\r\nwere several distinct assaults, and so nearly simultaneous as to show\r\nthat they did not spread from one point. A press summary of the report\r\nof the fiscal shows that the evidence of the Chilean officials and\r\nothers was in conflict as to the place of origin, several places being\r\nnamed by different witnesses as the locality where the first outbreak\r\noccurred. This if correctly reported shows that there were several\r\ndistinct outbreaks, and so nearly at the same time as to cause this\r\nconfusion. The La Patria, in the same issue from which I have already\r\nquoted, after describing the killing of Riggin and the fight which from\r\nthat point extended to the Mole, says:\r\n\r\n  At the same time in other streets of the port the Yankee sailors fought\r\n  fiercely with the people of the town, who believed to see in them\r\n  incarnate enemies of the Chilean navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Captain Jenkins, of the American merchant ship\r\n_Keweenaw_, which had gone to Valparaiso for repairs, and who was a\r\nwitness of some part of the assault upon the crew of the _Baltimore_, is\r\nstrongly corroborative of the testimony of our own sailors when he says\r\nthat he saw Chilean sentries drive back a seaman seeking shelter upon\r\na mob that was pursuing him. The officers and men of Captain Jenkins's\r\nship furnish the most conclusive testimony as to the indignities which\r\nwere practiced toward Americans in Valparaiso. When American sailors,\r\neven of merchant ships, can only secure their safety by denying their\r\nnationality, it must be time to readjust our relations with a government\r\nthat permits such demonstrations.\r\n\r\nAs to the participation of the police, the evidence of our sailors shows\r\nthat our men were struck and beaten by police officers before and after\r\narrest, and that one at least was dragged with a lasso about his neck by\r\na mounted policeman. That the death of Riggin was the result of a rifle\r\nshot fired by a policeman or soldier on duty is shown directly by the\r\ntestimony of Johnson, in whose arms he was at the time, and by the\r\nevidence of Charles Langen, an American sailor, not then a member of\r\nthe _Baltimore's_ crew, who stood close by and saw the transaction. The\r\nChilean authorities do not pretend to fix the responsibility of this\r\nshot upon any particular person, but avow their inability to ascertain\r\nwho fired it further than that it was fired from a crowd. The character\r\nof the wound as described by one of the surgeons of the _Baltimore_\r\nclearly supports his opinion that it was made by a rifle ball, the\r\norifice of exit being as much as an inch or an inch and a quarter in\r\nwidth. When shot the poor fellow was unconscious and in the arms of a\r\ncomrade, who was endeavoring to carry him to a neighboring drug store\r\nfor treatment. The story of the police that in coming up the street they\r\npassed these men and left them behind them is inconsistent with their\r\nown statement as to the direction of their approach and with their duty\r\nto protect them, and is clearly disproved. In fact Riggin was not behind\r\nbut in front of the advancing force, and was not standing in the crowd,\r\nbut was unconscious and supported in the arms of Johnson when he was\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nThe communications of the Chilean Government in relation to this\r\ncruel and disastrous attack upon our men, as will appear from the\r\ncorrespondence, have not in any degree taken the form of a manly and\r\nsatisfactory expression of regret, much less of apology. The event was\r\nof so serious a character that if the injuries suffered by our men had\r\nbeen wholly the result of an accident in a Chilean port the incident was\r\ngrave enough to have called for some public expression of sympathy and\r\nregret from the local authorities. It is not enough to say that the\r\naffair was lamentable, for humanity would require that expression even\r\nif the beating and killing of our men had been justifiable. It is not\r\nenough to say that the incident is regretted, coupled with the statement\r\nthat the affair was not of an unusual character in ports where foreign\r\nsailors are accustomed to meet. It is not for a generous and sincere\r\ngovernment to seek for words of small or equivocal meaning in which\r\nto convey to a friendly power an apology for an offense so atrocious\r\nas this. In the case of the assault by a mob in New Orleans upon the\r\nSpanish consulate in 1851, Mr. Webster wrote to the Spanish minister,\r\nMr. Calderon, that the acts complained of were \"a disgraceful and\r\nflagrant breach of duty and propriety,\" and that his Government \"regrets\r\nthem as deeply as Minister Calderon or his Government could possibly\r\ndo;\" that \"these acts have caused the President great pain, and he\r\nthinks a proper acknowledgment is due to Her Majesty's Government.\"\r\nHe invited the Spanish consul to return to his post, guaranteeing\r\nprotection, and offered to salute the Spanish flag if the consul should\r\ncome in a Spanish vessel. Such a treatment by the Government of Chile of\r\nthis assault would have been more creditable to the Chilean authorities,\r\nand much less can hardly be satisfactory to a government that values its\r\ndignity and honor.\r\n\r\nIn our note of October 23 last, which appears in the correspondence,\r\nafter receiving the report of the board of officers appointed by Captain\r\nSchley to investigate the affair, the Chilean Government was advised of\r\nthe aspect which it then assumed and called upon for any facts in its\r\npossession that might tend to modify the unfavorable impressions which\r\nour report had created. It is very clear from the correspondence that\r\nbefore the receipt of this note the examination was regarded by the\r\npolice authorities as practically closed. It was, however, reopened and\r\nprotracted through a period of nearly three months. We might justly have\r\ncomplained of this unreasonable delay; but in view of the fact that the\r\nGovernment of Chile was still provisional, and with a disposition to be\r\nforbearing and hopeful of a friendly termination, I have awaited the\r\nreport, which has but recently been made.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st instant I caused to be communicated to the Government of\r\nChile by the American minister at Santiago the conclusions of this\r\nGovernment after a full consideration of all the evidence and of every\r\nsuggestion affecting this matter, and to these conclusions I adhere.\r\nThey were stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  First. That the assault is not relieved of the aspect which the early\r\n  information of the event gave to it, viz, that of an attack upon the\r\n  uniform of the United States Navy having its origin and motive in a\r\n  feeling of hostility to this Government, and not in any act of the\r\n  sailors or of any of them.\r\n\r\n  Second. That the public authorities of Valparaiso flagrantly failed in\r\n  their duty to protect our men, and that some of the police and of the\r\n  Chilean soldiers and sailors were themselves guilty of unprovoked\r\n  assaults upon our sailors before and after arrest. He [the President]\r\n  thinks the preponderance of the evidence and the inherent probabilities\r\n  lead to the conclusion that Riggin was killed by the police or soldiers.\r\n\r\n  Third. That he [the President] is therefore compelled to bring the case\r\n  back to the position taken by this Government in the note of Mr. Wharton\r\n  of October 23 last * * * and to ask for a suitable apology and for some\r\n  adequate reparation for the injury done to this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same note the attention of the Chilean Government was called to\r\nthe offensive character of a note addressed by Mr. Matta, its minister\r\nof foreign affairs, to Mr. Montt, its minister at this capital, on the\r\n11th ultimo. This dispatch was not officially communicated to this\r\nGovernment, but as Mr. Montt was directed to translate it and to give\r\nit to the press of the country it seemed to me that it could not pass\r\nwithout official notice. It was not only undiplomatic, but grossly\r\ninsulting to our naval officers and to the executive department, as it\r\ndirectly imputed untruth and insincerity to the reports of the naval\r\nofficers and to the official communications made by the executive\r\ndepartment to Congress. It will be observed that I have notified the\r\nChilean Government that unless this note is at once withdrawn and an\r\napology as public as the offense made I will terminate diplomatic\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThe request for the recall of Mr. Egan upon the ground that he was not\r\n_persona grata_ was unaccompanied by any suggestion that could properly\r\nbe used in support of it, and I infer that the request is based upon\r\nofficial acts of Mr. Egan which have received the approval of this\r\nGovernment. But however that may be, I could not consent to consider\r\nsuch a question until it had first been settled whether our\r\ncorrespondence with Chile could be conducted upon a basis of mutual\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nIn submitting these papers to Congress for that grave and patriotic\r\nconsideration which the questions involved demand I desire to say that\r\nI am of the opinion that the demands made of Chile by this Government\r\nshould be adhered to and enforced. If the dignity as well as the\r\nprestige and influence of the United States are not to be wholly\r\nsacrificed, we must protect those who in foreign ports display the flag\r\nor wear the colors of this Government against insult, brutality, and\r\ndeath inflicted in resentment of the acts of their Government and not\r\nfor any fault of their own. It has been my desire in every way to\r\ncultivate friendly and intimate relations with all the Governments of\r\nthis hemisphere. We do not covet their territory. We desire their peace\r\nand prosperity. We look for no advantage in our relations with them\r\nexcept the increased exchanges of commerce upon a basis of mutual\r\nbenefit. We regret every civil contest that disturbs their peace and\r\nparalyzes their development, and are always ready to give our good\r\noffices for the restoration of peace. It must, however, be understood\r\nthat this Government, while exercising the utmost forbearance toward\r\nweaker powers, will extend its strong and adequate projection to its\r\ncitizens, to its officers, and to its humblest sailor when made the\r\nvictims of wantonness and cruelty in resentment not of their personal\r\nmisconduct, but of the official acts of their Government.\r\n\r\nUpon information received that Patrick Shields, an Irishman and probably\r\na British subject, but at the time a fireman of the American steamer\r\n_Keweenaw_, in the harbor of Valparaiso for repairs, had been subjected\r\nto personal injuries in that city, largely by the police, I directed the\r\nAttorney-General to cause the evidence of the officers and crew of that\r\nvessel to be taken upon its arrival in San Francisco, and that testimony\r\nis also herewith transmitted. The brutality and even savagery of the\r\ntreatment of this poor man by the Chilean police would be incredible if\r\nthe evidence of Shields was not supported by other direct testimony and\r\nby the distressing condition of the man himself when he was finally able\r\nto reach his vessel. The captain of the vessel says:\r\n\r\n  He came back a wreck, black from his neck to his hips from beating,\r\n  weak and stupid, and is still in a kind of paralyzed condition, and has\r\n  never been able to do duty since.\r\n\r\n\r\nA claim for reparation has been made in behalf of this man, for while he\r\nwas not a citizen of the United States, the doctrine long held by us, as\r\nexpressed in the consular regulations, is:\r\n\r\n  The principles which are maintained by this Government in regard to\r\n  the protection, as distinguished from the relief, of seamen are well\r\n  settled. It is held that the circumstance that the vessel is American\r\n  is evidence that the seamen on board are such, and in every regularly\r\n  documented merchant vessel the crew will find their protection in the\r\n  flag that covers them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have as yet received no reply to our note of the 21st instant, but in\r\nmy opinion I ought not to delay longer to bring these matters to the\r\nattention of Congress for such action as may be deemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 25, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a communication\r\nof the 23d instant from the Secretary of the Interior, submitting an\r\nextract from the report of the commission appointed under the act of\r\nJanuary 12, 1891, entitled \"An act for the relief of the Mission Indians\r\nin the State of California,\" and other papers relating to the exchange\r\nof lands with private individuals and the purchase of certain lands and\r\nimprovements for the use and benefit of the Mission Indians, with draft\r\nof a bill to carry into effect the recommendations of said Mission\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nI have approved the report of the Mission Commission, except as much as\r\nrelates to the purchase of lands from and exchange of lands with private\r\nindividuals, which is also approved subject to the condition that\r\nCongress shall authorize the same.\r\n\r\nThe matter is presented with the recommendation for the early and\r\nfavorable action of Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 25, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nReferring to a communication of June 11, 1890, concerning the adoption\r\nby the Committee on Foreign Relations of a resolution respecting the\r\nclaim of William Webster against the Government of Great Britain, I\r\nherewith transmit a report of the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ndocuments, showing the action taken under that resolution.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 25, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompaniments, in relation to the claim of the representatives of the\r\nlate Hon. James Crooks, a British subject, against the Government of the\r\nUnited States for the seizure of the steamer _Lord Nelson_ in 1812.\r\n\r\nThe favorable action of the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses upon the\r\nbills heretofore introduced for the relief of the claimants makes it\r\nproper that I should recommend it anew for the consideration and final\r\ndisposition of the present Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 28, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith additional correspondence between this Government\r\nand the Government of Chile, consisting of a note of M. Montt, the\r\nChilean minister at this capital, to Mr. Blaine, dated January 23; a\r\nreply of Mr. Blaine thereto of date January 27, and a dispatch from\r\nMr. Egan, our minister at Santiago, transmitting the response of\r\nMr. Pereira, the Chilean minister of foreign affairs, to the note of\r\nMr. Blaine of January 21, which was received by me on the 26th instant.\r\nThe note of Mr. Montt to Mr. Blaine, though dated January 23, was not\r\ndelivered at the State Department until after 12 o'clock m. of the 25th,\r\nand was not translated and its receipt notified to me until late in the\r\nafternoon of that day.\r\n\r\nThe response of Mr. Pereira to our note of the 21st withdraws, with\r\nacceptable expressions of regret, the offensive note of Mr. Matta of\r\nthe 11th ultimo, and also the request for the recall of Mr. Egan.\r\nThe treatment of the incident of the assault upon the sailors of the\r\n_Baltimore_ is so conciliatory and friendly that I am of the opinion\r\nthat there is a good prospect that the differences growing out of\r\nthat serious affair can now be adjusted upon terms satisfactory to\r\nthis Government by the usual methods and without special powers from\r\nCongress. This turn in the affair is very gratifying to me, as I am sure\r\nit will be to the Congress and to our people. The general support of the\r\nefforts of the Executive to enforce the just rights of the nation in\r\nthis matter has given an instructive and useful illustration of the\r\nunity and patriotism of our people.\r\n\r\nShould it be necessary I will again communicate with Congress upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 9, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 13th of January last, a report from the Secretary\r\nof State and accompanying papers.[24]\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Correspondence with Spain, Brazil, Salvador, and the\r\nDominican Republic relative to reciprocal trade relations; copies of\r\ncommercial arrangements entered into with those countries; list of\r\nimport and export duties imposed by Brazil, Salvador, and the Dominican\r\nRepublic, and by Spain with respect to Cuba and Puerto Rico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 10, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, as required by law, a communication of the 6th\r\ninstant from the Secretary of the Interior, with the report of the\r\nPuyallup Indian Commission and accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 16, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThere was passed by the last Congress \"An act for the protection of the\r\nlives of the miners in the Territories,\" which was approved by me on the\r\n3d day of March, 1891. That no appropriation was made to enable me to\r\ncarry the act into effect resulted, I suppose, from the fact that it was\r\npassed so late in the session. This law recognizes the necessity of a\r\nresponsible public inspection and supervision of the business of mining\r\nin the interest of the miners, and is in line with the legislation of\r\nmost of the States.\r\n\r\nThe work of the miner has its unavoidable incidents of discomfort and\r\ndanger, and these should not be increased by the neglect of the owners\r\nto provide every practicable safety appliance. Economies which involve\r\na sacrifice of human life are intolerable.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith memorials from several hundred miners working in the\r\ncoal mines in the Indian Territory, asking for the appointment of an\r\ninspector under the act referred to. The recent frightful disaster at\r\nKrebs, in that Territory, in which sixty-seven miners met a horrible\r\ndeath, gives urgency to their appeal, and I recommend that a special\r\nappropriation be at once made for the salaries and the necessary\r\nexpenses of the inspectors provided for in the law.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 17, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Indian appropriation bill which was approved March 3, 1891, contains\r\nthe following provision:\r\n\r\n  And the sum of $2,991,450 be, and the same is hereby, appropriated,\r\n  out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to pay\r\n  the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations of Indians for all the right, title,\r\n  interest, and claim which said nations of Indians may have in and to\r\n  certain lands now occupied by the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians under\r\n  Executive order, said lands lying south of the Canadian River, and now\r\n  occupied by the said Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians; said lands have\r\n  been ceded in trust by article 3 of the treaty between the United\r\n  States and said Choctaw and Chickasaw nations of Indians which was\r\n  concluded April 28, 1866, and proclaimed on the 10th day of August of\r\n  the same year, and whereof there remains, after deducting allotments as\r\n  provided by said agreement, a residue ascertained by survey to contain\r\n  2,393,160 acres; three-fourths of this appropriation to be paid to such\r\n  person or persons as are or shall be duly authorized by the laws of\r\n  said Choctaw Nation to receive the same, at such time and in such sums\r\n  as directed and required by the legislative authority of said Choctaw\r\n  Nation, and one-fourth of this appropriation to be paid to such person\r\n  or persons as are or shall be duly authorized by the laws of said\r\n  Chickasaw Nation to receive the same, at such times and in such sums as\r\n  directed and required by the legislative authority of said Chickasaw\r\n  Nation; this appropriation to be immediately available and to become\r\n  operative upon the execution by the duly appointed delegates of said\r\n  respective nations specially authorized thereto by law of releases and\r\n  conveyances to the United States of all the right, title, interest, and\r\n  claim of said respective nations of Indians in and to said land (not\r\n  including Greer County, which is now in dispute), in manner and form\r\n  satisfactory to the President of the United States; and said releases\r\n  and conveyances, when fully executed and delivered, shall operate to\r\n  extinguish all claim of every kind and character of said Choctaw and\r\n  Chickasaw nations of Indians in and to the tract of country to which\r\n  said releases and conveyances shall apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this section had been submitted to me as a separate measure,\r\nespecially during the closing hours of the session, I should have\r\ndisapproved it; but as the Congress was then in its last hours a\r\ndisapproval of the general Indian appropriation bill, of which it was a\r\npart, would have resulted in consequences so far-reaching and disastrous\r\nthat I felt it my duty to approve the bill. But as a duty was devolved\r\nupon me by the section quoted, viz, the acceptance and approval of the\r\nconveyances provided for, I have felt bound to look into the whole\r\nmatter, and in view of the facts which I shall presently mention to\r\npostpone any Executive action until these facts could be submitted to\r\nCongress. Very soon after the passage of the law it came to my knowledge\r\nthat the Choctaw Legislature had entered into an agreement with three\r\ncitizens of that tribe to pay to them as compensation for procuring this\r\nlegislation 25 per cent of any appropriation that might be made by\r\nCongress. The amount to be secured by these three agents under this\r\nagreement out of the three-fourths interest in the appropriation of the\r\nChoctaw Nation is $560,896. I have information that a contract was made\r\nby the Chickasaws to pay about 10 per cent of their one-fourth interest\r\nto the agents and attorneys who represented them.\r\n\r\nWithin a month after the passage of the law R.J. Ward, one of the\r\nagents, who was to divide with his associates the enormous sum to be\r\npaid by the Choctaws, presented to me an affidavit dated April 4, 1891,\r\nwhich is herewith submitted. It appears from his statement that the\r\naction of the Choctaw Council in this matter was corruptly influenced\r\nby the execution of certain notes signed by Ward for himself and his\r\nassociates in sums varying from $2,500 to $15,000. His associates deny\r\nany knowledge of this, but the giving and existence of these notes is\r\nnot refuted. The statement of the two associates of Ward denying any\r\nknowledge or participation in this fraud is also submitted, together\r\nwith other papers relating to the matter. Whatever may be the fact as to\r\nthe use or nonuse of corrupt methods to secure this legislation from the\r\nChoctaw Council, I do not think the Congress of the United States should\r\nso legislate upon this matter as to give effect to such a contract,\r\nwhich I am sure must have been unnoticed when the measure was pending.\r\nIf the relations of these Indians to the United States are those of a\r\nward, Congress should protect them from such extortionate exactions.\r\nWe can not assume that the expenses and services of a committee of three\r\npersons to represent this claim before Congress should justly assume\r\nsuch proportions. The making of such a contract seems to convey\r\nimplications which I am sure are wholly unjust.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the appropriation bill legislation was had by the\r\nChoctaw Nation looking to the completion of the contract made with their\r\ndelegates as to the payment of this money; but subsequently, when it\r\nwas supposed that this extraordinary arrangement might require me to\r\nbring the matter to the attention of Congress, an act was passed by\r\nthe Choctaw General Council, approved October 19, 1891, declaring all\r\ncontracts made by the Choctaw delegates with any attorneys in connection\r\nwith this appropriation void and of no effect. A copy of this law will\r\nbe found with the papers submitted. There has also been submitted to me\r\nan unofficial copy of the opinion of the attorney-general of the Choctaw\r\nNation holding that this last legislation is unconstitutional and void.\r\nI am of the opinion that if this appropriation is to stand provision\r\nshould be made for protecting these tribes against extortionate claims\r\nfor compensation in procuring action by Congress. Copies of the several\r\nlaws passed by the Choctaw Nation with reference to this matter will\r\nbe found in the accompanying papers. It will be noticed that the\r\ndistribution proposed is limited to Choctaws by blood, excluding the\r\nfreedmen and the white men who have been given full citizenship from any\r\nparticipation. A protest against this method of distribution has been\r\nfiled by a white citizen of the tribe, and also a representation by Hon.\r\nThomas C. Fletcher, their attorney, on behalf of the freedmen. In view\r\nof the fact that the stipulations of the treaty of 1866 in behalf of\r\nthe freedmen of these tribes have not, especially in the case of the\r\nChickasaws, been complied with, it would seem that the United States\r\nshould in a distribution of this money have made suitable provision\r\nin their behalf. The Chickasaws have steadfastly refused to admit the\r\nfreedmen to citizenship, as they stipulated to do in the treaty referred\r\nto, and their condition in that tribe and in a lesser degree in the\r\nother strongly calls for the protective intervention of Congress.\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat careful examination of the question I do not believe\r\nthat the lands for which this money is to be paid were, to quote the\r\nlanguage of section 15 of the Indian appropriation bill, already set\r\nout, \"ceded in trust by article 3 of the treaty between the United\r\nStates and said Choctaw and Chickasaw nations of Indians which was\r\nconcluded April 28, 1866,\" etc. It is agreed that that treaty contained\r\nno express limitation upon the uses to which the United States might put\r\nthe territory known as the leased district. The lands were ceded by\r\nterms sufficiently comprehensive to have passed the full title of the\r\nIndians. The limitation upon the use to which the Government might put\r\nthem is sought to be found in a provision of the treaty by which the\r\nUnited States undertook to exclude white settlers and in the expressions\r\nfound in the treaties made at the same time with the Creeks and other\r\ntribes of the purpose of the United States to use the lands ceded by\r\nthose tribes for the settlement of friendly Indians.\r\n\r\nThe stipulation as to the exclusion of white settlers might well have\r\nreference solely to the national lands retained by the Choctaw and\r\nChickasaw tribes, and the reason for the nonincorporation in the treaty\r\nwith them of a statement of the purpose of the Government in connection\r\nwith the use of the lands is well accounted for by the fact that as\r\nto these lands the Government had already, under the treaty of 1855,\r\nsecured the right to use them perpetually for the settlement of friendly\r\nIndians. This was not true as to the lands of the other tribes referred\r\nto. The United States paid to the Choctaws and Chickasaws $300,000, and\r\nthe failure to insert the words that are called words of limitation\r\nin this treaty points, I think, clearly to the conclusion that the\r\ncommissioners on the part of the Government and the Indians themselves\r\nmust have understood that this Government was acquiring something\r\nmore than a mere right to settle friendly Indians, which it already\r\npossessed, and something more than the mere release of the right which\r\nthe Choctaws and Chickasaws had under the treaty of 1855 to select\r\nlocations on these lands if they chose.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it was the policy of this Government for the time to\r\nhold these and the adjacent lands as Indian country, and many of the\r\nexpressions in the proclamations of my predecessors and in the reports\r\nof the Indian Bureau and of the Secretary of the Interior mean this and\r\nnothing more. This is quite different from a conditional title, which\r\nlimits the grant to a particular use and works a reinvestment of full\r\ntitle in the Indian grantors when that use ceases. But those who hold\r\nmost strictly that a use for Indian purposes, where it is expressed,\r\nis a limitation of title seem to agree that the United States might\r\npass a fee absolute to other Indian tribes in the lands ceded for their\r\noccupancy. Certainly it was not intended that in settling friendly\r\nIndians upon these lands the Government was to be restrained in its\r\npolicy of allotment and individual ownership. If for an adequate\r\nconsideration, by treaty, the United States placed upon these lands\r\nother Indian tribes, it was competent to give them patents in fee for\r\na certain and agreed reservation. This being so, when the policy of\r\nallotment is put into force the compensation for the unused lands should\r\ncertainly go to the occupying tribe, which in the case supposed had paid\r\na full consideration for the whole reservation.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be contended that in such case this Government should\r\npay twice for the lands. In the appropriation under discussion this\r\nprinciple is in part recognized, for no claim is made by the Choctaws\r\nand Chickasaws for the lands allotted to the Cheyennes and Arapahoes.\r\nThe claim is for unallotted or surplus lands. The case of the Cheyennes\r\nand Arapahoes is this: In consideration of other lands the Government\r\ngave them a treaty reservation in the Cherokee Outlet, but never\r\nperfected it by paying the Cherokees the stipulated price and placing\r\nthese Indians upon it. The Cheyennes and Arapahoes declined to go upon\r\nthe strip and located themselves farther south, where they now are. The\r\nGovernment subsequently recognized their right to remain there, and set\r\napart the lands now being allotted to members of that tribe and the\r\nlands for which payment is now claimed by the Choctaws and Chickasaws as\r\nthe Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation. I think the United States must be\r\nheld to have assented to the substitution of these lands for the treaty\r\nlands in the Cherokee Strip, and that being true, when the reservation\r\nis broken up, as now, by allotments, it would seem that the Cheyennes\r\nand Arapahoes were entitled to be compensated for these surplus lands.\r\nIn fact, a commission which has been dealing with the tribes in the\r\nIndian Territory has concluded an arrangement with them by which the\r\nGovernment pays $1,500,000 for these surplus lands and for the release\r\nof any claim to the Cherokee Strip, so that in fact in this agreement\r\nwith the Cheyennes and Arapahoes the Government has paid for the lands\r\nfor which payment is now claimed by the Choctaws and Chickasaws.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten also that the allotment to the Cheyennes and\r\nArapahoes is still incomplete. The method of calculation which resulted\r\nin stating the claim of the Choctaws and Chickasaws at $2,991,450 is\r\nexplained by a letter of Mr. J.S. Standley, one of the Choctaw\r\ndelegates, dated April 6, 1891. The agent for the Cheyennes and\r\nArapahoes wrote Mr. Standley that there were 600 Indians residing upon\r\nthe lands south of the Canadian River, and who it was supposed would\r\ntake allotments there, and upon this statement the legislation was\r\nbased. Now it must be borne in mind that the Cheyennes and Arapahoes\r\nhave the right to locate anywhere within their reservation, and that\r\ninstead of 600 double that number might have taken their allotments\r\nsouth of the Canadian River upon these lands. This is not probable, but\r\na later report indicates that the number will certainly be in excess of\r\n600. If the sum to be paid to the Choctaws and Chickasaws depended\r\nupon a knowledge of the number of acres of unallotted land south of\r\nthe Canadian River, it would seem to have been reasonable that the\r\nappropriation should have been delayed until the exact number of acres\r\ntaken for allotment had been officially ascertained. This has not yet\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\nIt is right also, I think, that Congress in dealing with this matter\r\nshould have the whole question before it, for the declaration of Indian\r\ntitle contained in this item of appropriation extends to a very large\r\nbody of land and will involve very large future appropriations. The\r\nChoctaw and Chickasaw leased district, embracing the lands in the Indian\r\nTerritory between the ninety-eighth and one hundredth degrees of west\r\nlongitude and extending north and south from the main Canadian River to\r\nthe Red River, including Greer County, contains, according to the public\r\nsurveys, 7,713,239 acres, or, excluding Greer County, 6,201,663 acres.\r\nThis leased district is occupied as follows:\r\n\r\nGreer County, by white citizens of Texas, 1,511,576 acres. The United\r\nStates is now prosecuting a case in the courts to obtain a judicial\r\ndeclaration that this county is part of the Indian country. If a\r\ndecision should be rendered in its favor, the claim of the Choctaws\r\nand Chickasaws to be paid for these lands at the rate named in this\r\nappropriation would at once be presented.\r\n\r\nThe Wichita Reservation is also upon the leased lands and is occupied\r\nby the Wichitas, Caddoes, Delawares, and remnants of other tribes by\r\nDepartment orders, made to depend upon the treaty with the Delawares in\r\n1866 and some other unratified agreements with tribes or fragments of\r\ntribes in 1872. This reservation contains 743,610 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Reservation is occupied by those Indians\r\nunder a treaty proclaimed August 25, 1868, which provides that said\r\ndistrict of country \"shall be, and the same is hereby, set apart for the\r\nabsolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the tribes herein named,\r\nand for such friendly tribes or individual Indians as from time to time\r\nthey may be willing (with the consent of the United States) to admit\r\namong them.\" This reservation contains 2,968,893 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Cheyennes and Arapahoes, whose surplus lands are to be paid for by\r\nthis appropriation, have occupied the country between the Washita and\r\nCanadian rivers, extending west to the one hundredth degree of\r\nlongitude. This reservation contains 2,489,160 acres.\r\n\r\nI have stated these facts in order that it may be seen what further\r\nappropriations are involved in a settlement for all these lands upon the\r\nbasis which Congress has adopted. It does not seem to me to be a wise\r\npolicy to deal with this question piecemeal. It would have been better,\r\nif a remnant of title remains in the Choctaws and Chickasaws to the\r\nlands in the leased district, to have settled the whole matter at once.\r\nUnder the treaty of 1855 the Choctaws and Chickasaws quitclaimed any\r\nsupposed interest of theirs in the lands west of the one hundredth\r\ndegree. The boundary between the Louisiana purchase and the Spanish\r\npossessions by our treaty of 1819 with Spain was as to these lands fixed\r\nupon the one hundredth degree of west longitude.\r\n\r\nOur treaty with the Choctaws and Chickasaws made in 1820 extended their\r\ngrant to the limit of our possessions. It followed, of course, that\r\nthese lands were included within the boundaries of the State of Texas\r\nwhen that State was admitted to the Union, and the release of the\r\nChoctaws and Chickasaws, whatever it was worth, operated for the benefit\r\nof the State of Texas and not of the United States. The lands became\r\npublic lands of that State. For the release of this claim and for the\r\nlease of the lands west of the ninety-eighth degree the Government of\r\nthe United States paid the sum of $800,000. In the calculations which\r\nhave been made to arrive at the basis of the appropriation under\r\ndiscussion no part of this sum is treated as having been paid for the\r\nlease. I do not think that is just to the United States. It seems\r\nprobable that a very considerable part of this consideration must have\r\nrelated to the leased lands, because these were the lands in which the\r\nIndian title was recognized, and the treaty gave to the United States a\r\npermanent right of occupation by friendly Indians. The sum of $300,000,\r\npaid under the treaty of 1866, is deducted, as I understand, in arriving\r\nat the sum appropriated. It seems to me that a considerable proportion\r\nof the sum of $800,000 previously paid should have been deducted in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\nI have felt it to be my duty to bring these matters to the attention of\r\nCongress for such action as may be thought advisable.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 24, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, the annual report\r\nof the World's Columbian Commission; a supplementary report of the\r\nsame commission, submitted February 16, 1892; the report of the board\r\nappointed by me under section 16 of the act of April 25, 1890, to have\r\ncharge of the exhibit to be made by the Executive Departments, the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, the Fish Commission, and the National Museum;\r\nand the report of the board of lady managers, provided for by section\r\n6 of the act referred to.\r\n\r\nThe information furnished by these reports as to the progress of the\r\nwork is not only satisfactory, but highly gratifying. The plan and scope\r\nadopted and the site and buildings selected and now being erected are\r\nfully commensurate with the national and international character of the\r\nenterprise contemplated by the legislation of Congress. The Illinois\r\ncorporation has fully complied with the condition of the law that\r\n$10,000,000 should be provided, and the Government commission reports\r\nthat \"the grounds and buildings will be the most extensive, adequate,\r\nand ornate ever devoted to such purposes.\" It seems, however, that from\r\nfive to eight millions of dollars more will, in the opinion of the\r\nlocal board and the national commission, be necessary to prepare the\r\nexposition for a complete and successful inauguration. It will be\r\nnoticed from the reports that it was first proposed by the local\r\ncommission to ask of Congress a loan of $5,000,000, to be repaid from\r\nreceipts, and that the national commission approved this suggestion.\r\nSubsequently the Illinois exposition corporation reconsidered its action\r\nand determined to ask a subscription of $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe supplementary report of the national commission seems to approve\r\nthis amended proposition. I have not myself that detailed information as\r\nto the financial necessities of the enterprise which would enable me to\r\nform an independent judgment of the additional amount necessary, and am\r\nnot, therefore, prepared to make any specific recommendation to Congress\r\nupon the subject. The committees of Congress having this matter in\r\ncharge will undoubtedly obtain full and accurate information before\r\nfinal action. The exposition, notwithstanding the limitations which\r\nthe act contains, is an enterprise to which the United States is so\r\nfar committed that Congress ought not, I think, to withhold just and\r\nreasonable further support if the local corporation consents to proper\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nLiberality on the part of the United States is due to the foreign\r\nnations that have responded in a friendly way to the invitation of this\r\nGovernment to participate in the exposition, and will, I am sure, meet\r\nthe approval of our people. The exposition will be one of the most\r\nillustrious incidents in our civic history.\r\n\r\nI transmit also certain resolutions adopted by representatives of the\r\nNational Guard of the various States appointed by the governors to\r\nattend a convention which was held in Chicago on the 27th of October,\r\n1891, with a view to consider the subject of holding a military\r\nencampment at Chicago during the exposition.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 9, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a communication\r\nof the 5th instant from the Secretary of the Interior, submitting the\r\nagreement concluded by and between the commissioners for the United\r\nStates and the Cherokee Nation of Indians of the Indian Territory, for\r\nthe cession of certain lands and for other purposes.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 18, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 3d\r\nultimo, a report from the Acting Secretary of State of the 17th instant,\r\ntransmitting information relative to and his opinion as to the purchase\r\nof the unpublished correspondence and manuscripts of President James\r\nMonroe.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 24, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Board of Commissioners of\r\nthe District of Columbia, accompanied by a letter from the chairman of\r\nthe executive committee organized by the citizens of Washington for the\r\nreception and entertainment of the Twenty-sixth Annual Encampment of the\r\nGrand Army of the Republic, which is to be held in Washington during\r\nSeptember next. An appeal is made for an appropriation by Congress of\r\n$100,000, one-half to be paid out of the District revenues, to aid in\r\ndefraying the expenses attending this reception.\r\n\r\nThe event is one of very high and, as I believe, of national interest,\r\nand the attendance of the surviving Union soldiers will, I do not doubt,\r\nbe larger than at any annual encampment that has ever been held.\r\nThe public authorities of the cities or States, or both, in which\r\nthe encampments have been held have, I believe, usually appropriated\r\nliberally to make the occasions worthy and the entertainment hospitable.\r\nThe parade of the survivors of our great armies upon Pennsylvania avenue\r\nwill bring vividly back to us those joyful and momentous days when the\r\ngreat victorious armies of the East and of the West marched through the\r\nstreets of Washington in high parade and were received by our citizens\r\nwith joyful acclaim. It seems to me that it will be highly appropriate\r\nfor Congress suitably to aid in making this demonstration impressive and\r\nin extending to those soldiers whose lives a beneficent Providence has\r\nprolonged an opportunity to see in the security and peace, development\r\nand prosperity, which now so happily pervade the national capital the\r\nfruits of their sacrifice and valor.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 26, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have received the resolution of the Senate of April 23, requesting\r\nthat, if not incompatible with the public interest, I inform the Senate\r\nwhat steps have been taken toward the securing of an international\r\nconference to consider the question of the free coinage of silver at\r\nthe mints of the nations participating in such conference, or as to the\r\nenlarged use of silver in the currency system of said countries, and\r\nthat I transmit to the Senate any correspondence between the United\r\nStates and other governments upon the subject, and in response thereto\r\nbeg respectfully to inform the Senate that in my opinion it would not\r\nbe compatible with the public interest to lay before the Senate at this\r\ntime the information requested, but that at the earliest moment after\r\ndefinite information can properly be given all the facts and any\r\ncorrespondence that may take place will be submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nIt may not be inappropriate, however, to say here that, believing that\r\nthe full use of silver as a coined metal upon an agreed ratio by the\r\ngreat commercial nations of the world would very highly promote the\r\nprosperity of all their people, I have not and will not let any\r\nfavorable opportunity pass for the promotion of that most desirable\r\nresult, or, if free international silver coinage is not presently\r\nattainable, then to secure the largest practicable use of that metal.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 25, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of the Secretary of War, dated May\r\n24, from which and from the accompanying papers it appears that the late\r\nGeneral George W. Cullum, of the United States Army, has by will devised\r\n$250,000 to the Government of the United States for the erection of a\r\nmemorial hall upon the grounds of the Military Academy at West Point, to\r\nbe used as a \"receptacle of statues, busts, mural tablets, and portraits\r\nof distinguished deceased officers and graduates of the Military\r\nAcademy, of paintings of battle scenes, trophies of war, and such other\r\nobjects as may tend to give elevation to the military profession.\"\r\n\r\nThis ample and patriotic gift is hampered by no conditions and involves\r\nno appropriation beyond the sum so generously donated.\r\n\r\nThe executors in order to facilitate action have prepared, and the same\r\nis herewith submitted, the outline of a bill to carry into effect the\r\nprovisions of General Cullum's will.\r\n\r\nThere can be no occasion to urge upon Congress the immediate enactment\r\nof a suitable law to carry into effect the patriotic purpose expressed\r\nin the will.\r\n\r\nI suggest that in the bill itself, or by a separate joint resolution,\r\nsuitable expression be given of the public appreciation of this crowning\r\nservice to the military profession and to his country rendered by\r\nGeneral Cullum.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 25, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of section 4119 of the Revised\r\nStatutes of the United States, I lay before you for revision a copy of\r\nthe regulations for the consular courts of the United States in Korea,\r\nas decreed by the minister of this Government at Seoul March 31, 1892. I\r\nalso transmit an accompanying report by the Acting Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 20, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe following resolution was passed by the Senate on the 24th day of\r\nFebruary last:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be requested, if in his opinion not\r\n  incompatible with the public interests, to inform the Senate of the\r\n  proceedings recently had with the representatives of the Dominion of\r\n  Canada and of the British Government as to arrangements for reciprocal\r\n  trade between Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response thereto I now submit the following information:\r\n\r\nOn the 15th day of April last the Secretary of State submitted to me a\r\nreport, which is herewith transmitted. Shortly after the report came\r\ninto my possession I was advised by the Secretary that the British\r\nminister at this capital had informed him that the Canadian government\r\ndesired a further conference on the subject of the discriminating canal\r\ntolls of which this country had complained. This information was\r\naccompanied by the suggestion that a response to the resolution of the\r\nSenate might properly be delayed until this further conference was held.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d instant the British minister, in connection with Hon.\r\nMacKenzie Bowell and Hon. George E. Foster, members of the Canadian\r\nministry, were received by the Secretary of State and a further\r\nconference took place. In both of the conferences referred to Hon. John\r\nW. Foster, at the request of the Secretary of State, appeared with him\r\non behalf of this Government; and the report of the latter conference\r\nwas submitted to me on the 6th instant by Mr. Foster, and is herewith\r\ntransmitted. The result of the conference as to the practicability of\r\narranging a reciprocity treaty with the Dominion of Canada is clearly\r\nstated in the letter of Mr. Blaine, and was anticipated, I think, by him\r\nand by every other thoughtful American who had considered the subject.\r\nA reciprocity treaty limited to the exchange of natural products would\r\nhave been such only in form. The benefits of such a treaty would have\r\ninured almost wholly to Canada. Previous experiments on this line had\r\nbeen unsatisfactory to this Government. A treaty that should be\r\nreciprocal in fact and of mutual advantages must necessarily have\r\nembraced an important list of manufactured articles and have secured to\r\nthe United States a free or favored introduction of these articles into\r\nCanada as against the world; but it was not believed that the Canadian\r\nministry was ready to propose or assent to such an arrangement. The\r\nconclusion of the Canadian commissioners is stated in the report of\r\nMr. Blaine as follows:\r\n\r\n  In the second place, it seemed to be impossible for the Canadian\r\n  government, in view of its present political relations and obligations,\r\n  to extend to American goods a preferential treatment over those of\r\n  other countries. As Canada was a part of the British Empire, they did\r\n  not consider it competent for the Dominion government to enter into\r\n  any commercial arrangement with the United States from the benefits of\r\n  which Great Britain and its colonies should be excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not for this Government to argue against this announcement of\r\nCanadian official opinion. It must be accepted, however, I think, as\r\nthe statement of a condition which places an insuperable barrier in\r\nthe way of the attainment of that large and beneficial intercourse and\r\nreciprocal trade which might otherwise be developed between the United\r\nStates and the Dominion.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Mr. Blaine reports as one of the results of the\r\nconference \"an informal engagement to repeal and abandon the drawback\r\nof 18 cents a ton given to wheat (grain) that is carried through to\r\nMontreal and shipped therefrom to Europe. By the American railways\r\nrunning from Ogdensburg and Oswego and other American ports the shippers\r\npaid the full 20 cents a ton, while in effect those by the way of\r\nMontreal pay only 2 cents. It was understood that the Canadian\r\ncommissioners, who were all three members of the cabinet, would see to\r\nthe withdrawal of this discrimination.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the recent conference by Mr. Foster it will be\r\nseen that the Canadian commissioners declare that this statement does\r\nnot conform to their understanding, and that the only assurance they\r\nhad intended to give was that the complaint of the Government of the\r\nUnited States should be taken into consideration by the Canadian\r\nministry on their return to Ottawa. Mr. Foster, who was present at the\r\nfirst conference, confirms the statements of Mr. Blaine. While this\r\nmisunderstanding is unfortunate, the more serious phase of the situation\r\nis that instead of rescinding the discriminating canal tolls of which\r\nthis Government complains the Canadian ministry, after the return of\r\nthe commissioners from their visit to Washington, on April 4, reissued,\r\nwithout any communication with this Government, the order continuing\r\nthe discrimination, by which a rebate of 18 cents a ton is allowed upon\r\ngrain going to Montreal, but not to American ports, and refusing this\r\nrebate even to grain going to Montreal if transshipped at an American\r\nport.\r\n\r\nThe report of Mr. Partridge, the Solicitor of the Department of State,\r\nwhich accompanies the letter of the Secretary of State, states these\r\ndiscriminations very clearly. That these orders as to canal tolls and\r\nrebates are in direct violation of Article XXVII of the treaty of\r\n1871 seems to be clear. It is wholly evasive to say that there is no\r\ndiscrimination between Canadian and American vessels; that the rebate\r\nis allowed to both without favor upon grain carried through to Montreal\r\nor transshipped at a Canadian port to Montreal. The treaty runs:\r\n\r\n  To secure to the citizens of the United States the use of the Welland,\r\n  St. Lawrence, and other canals in the Dominion on terms of equality\r\n  with the inhabitants of the Dominion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was intended to give to consumers in the United States, to our people\r\nengaged in railroad transportation, and to those exporting from our\r\nports equal terms in passing their merchandise through these canals.\r\nThis absolute equality of treatment was the consideration for\r\nconcessions on the part of this Government made in the same article of\r\nthe treaty, and which have been faithfully kept.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that the Canadian government has not responded\r\npromptly to our request for the removal of these discriminating tolls.\r\n\r\nThe papers submitted show how serious the loss inflicted is upon our\r\nlake vessels and upon some of our lake ports. In view of the fact that\r\nthe Canadian commissioners still contest with us the claim that these\r\ntolls are discriminating and insist that they constitute no violation\r\nof the letter or spirit of Article XXVII of the treaty, it would seem\r\nappropriate that Congress, if the view held by the Executive is\r\napproved, should with deliberation and yet with promptness take such\r\nsteps as may be necessary to secure the just rights of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn view of the delays which have already taken place in transmitting\r\nthis correspondence to Congress, I have not felt justified in awaiting\r\nthe further communication from the government of Canada which was\r\nsuggested in the recent conference.\r\n\r\nShould any proposition relating to this matter be received it will\r\nbe immediately submitted for the consideration of the Senate, and if\r\nforwarded within the time suggested will undoubtedly anticipate any\r\nfinal action by Congress.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 20, 1802_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate dated March 14, 1892,\r\nrequesting that certain specified correspondence in regard to the claim\r\nof Antonio Maximo Mora against the Government of Spain be communicated\r\nto it; if not incompatible with the public interests, I transmit\r\nherewith the report of the Acting Secretary of State on the matter.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 1, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nFor the information of the Senate and in further response to the\r\nresolution of the Senate of February 24 last, I transmit herewith\r\na communication of the 24th ultimo from Mr. Herbert, the acting\r\nrepresentative of the British Government at this capital, addressed to\r\nMr. Wharton, Acting Secretary of State, upon the subject of Canadian\r\ncanal tolls; also a memorandum prepared and submitted to me by Mr. Adee,\r\nSecond Assistant Secretary of State, reviewing the communication of Mr.\r\nHerbert, and a letter of the 28th ultimo from Mr. John W. Foster, who,\r\nas I have previously stated, with Mr. Blaine represented this Government\r\nin the conferences with the Canadian commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe position taken by this Government, as expressed in my previous\r\ncommunication to the Senate, that the canal tolls and regulations of\r\nwhich complaint has been made are in violation of our treaty with Great\r\nBritain, is not shaken, but rather confirmed.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that a serious discrimination against our\r\ncitizens and our commerce exists, and quite as little doubt that this\r\ndiscrimination is not the incident but the purpose of the Canadian\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nIt has not seemed to me that this was a case in which we could yield to\r\nthe suggestion of further concessions on the part of the United States\r\nwith a view to securing treaty rights for which a consideration has\r\nalready been given.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 19, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval the bill (S. 2729) entitled\r\n\"An act to amend an act entitled 'An act to establish circuit courts of\r\nappeals, and to define and regulate in certain cases the jurisdiction\r\nof the courts of the United States, and for other purposes.'\"\r\n\r\nThe original act to which this amendment is proposed, constituting an\r\nintermediate court of appeals, had for its object the relief of the\r\nSupreme Court by limiting the cases which might be brought up for\r\nhearing in that court. The first section of the bill under consideration\r\nallows appeals in criminal cases where the sentence imposes no\r\nimprisonment and the fine is as much as $1,000. The effect of this\r\nprovision will be to bring to the Supreme Court many cases that in my\r\nopinion should be finally determined in the intermediate appellate\r\ncourt, and so in part to defeat the general purpose of Congress in\r\nconstituting the intermediate court. But this objection would not alone\r\nhave sufficient weight in my mind to induce me to return the bill.\r\nSection 3 of the bill is as follows:\r\n\r\n  That no appeal shall hereafter be allowed from judgments of the Court\r\n  of Claims in cases under the act of March 3, 1891, entitled \"An act to\r\n  provide for the adjudication and payment of claims arising from Indian\r\n  depredations,\" except where the adjudication involves the construction\r\n  or application of the Constitution or the validity or construction of\r\n  a treaty or the constitutionality of a law of the United States:\r\n  _Provided, however_, That upon such appeal it shall be competent for\r\n  the Supreme Court to require, by certiorari or otherwise, the whole\r\n  case to be certified for its review and determination upon the facts\r\n  as well as the law.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am advised by the Attorney-General that under the Indian-depredations\r\nact 8,000 cases, involving an aggregate of damages claimed of about\r\n$30,000,000, have already been filed. A number of these cases involve as\r\nmuch as $100,000 each, while a few involve as much as $500,000 each and\r\none something over $1,000,000. The damages which may be awarded in these\r\ncases by the Court of Claims are to be paid out of the trust funds of\r\nthe Indians held by the United States, or, if there are no such funds,\r\nout of the Treasury of the United States. The law referring these cases\r\nto the Court of Claims has had no judicial interpretation, and many\r\nnovel and difficult questions are likely to arise. It is quite a\r\nstartling proposition, and a very novel one, I think, that there shall\r\nbe absolutely no opportunity for the review in an appellate court,\r\nin cases involving such large amounts, of questions involving the\r\nconstruction of the statute under which the court is proceeding, or\r\nthose various questions of law, many of them new, which necessarily\r\narise in such cases.\r\n\r\nNeither the claimants, the Indians, nor the Government of the United\r\nStates should be absolutely denied opportunity to bring their exceptions\r\nto review by some appellate tribunal. I would not suggest that an appeal\r\nshould be allowed in all cases. Some limitation as to amount would be\r\nreasonable, and perhaps some discretion might be lodged in the Supreme\r\nCourt as to granting appeals. The limitations, however, imposed by the\r\nsection I have quoted are so severe and unreasonable, in my judgment,\r\nthat I have felt compelled to return the bill to the Senate with a view\r\nto its reconsideration.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 29, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval the bill (S. 1958) entitled \"An\r\nact to submit to the Court of Private Land Claims, established by an act\r\nof Congress approved March 3, 1891, the title of William McGarrahan to\r\nthe Rancho Panoche Grande, in the State of California, and for other\r\npurposes.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill came to me on the 20th instant, at a time when very many other\r\nbills were submitted for my consideration, and it has not been possible\r\nfor me to make such an examination of the history of Mr. McGarrahan's\r\nclaim as would be necessary to form an intelligent judgment as to its\r\nmerits and just extent. It is quite possible that he has been wronged\r\nand that he has a claim for some reparation from the Government. I can\r\nnot, however, think that this bill proceeds upon a just basis. It\r\nprovides that Mr. McGarrahan shall file his claim as the assignee of\r\nGomez in the Court of Private Land Claims for the lands described in the\r\ntitle, and that if the court establishes the grant to Gomez it shall be\r\nconfirmed to McGarrahan. No evidence that he is the assignee of Gomez\r\nis, I think, required by the bill, which assumes that fact instead of\r\nsubmitting it to the court. If the claim is established, it is provided\r\nin substance that all lands part of said grant which have been conveyed\r\nby the Government or are in the occupancy of actual settlers, or \"upon\r\nwhich there are any smelting or reduction works, or the lands claimed\r\nin connection with such reduction or smelting works,\" shall be excepted\r\nfrom the patent which the Secretary of the Interior is directed to issue\r\nto McGarrahan. By this provision the title of the New Idria Mining\r\nCompany, which has long contested with McGarrahan the title to a large\r\npart of this property, is established and that company is relieved from\r\nany responsibility to account for the profits made in mining. On the\r\nother hand, the United States waives all benefit of judicial proceedings\r\nwhich have resulted in its favor and gives Mr. McGarrahan an opportunity\r\n_de novo_ to try all such questions; and the decision, if in his favor,\r\nis not only to restore to him all the lands yet undisposed of, but the\r\nUnited States assumes to pay him the value of the lands appropriated by\r\nothers and of their use for all these years and to account to him for\r\nall profits that have been made by the New Idria Mining Company or\r\nanyone else in quicksilver or other mining.\r\n\r\nThis seems to me to be wholly inadmissible. The amount involved must be\r\nenormously large, though at present incapable of any accurate estimate.\r\nIf the title of the New Idria Company has been established by final\r\ndecrees of court placing that title beyond question and that company\r\nbeyond any call to respond for use and profits, why should the\r\nGovernment of the United States, waiving in its behalf these decrees,\r\nwhich would protect it also, assume a responsibility to account for the\r\nvalue of the lands and for their use and for the net value of minerals\r\nextracted by that company or others? It will be noticed in the quotation\r\nI have made from the act that this company is allowed to take all the\r\nland it may claim, but at the expense of the United States, not of\r\nMr. McGarrahan.\r\n\r\nThe bill is so framed as to give full protection to the New Idria Mining\r\nCompany to the full extent of its largest claim, while throwing upon the\r\nUnited States a responsibility which that company should bear if the\r\ntitle of Mr. McGarrahan is established.\r\n\r\nThe United States provided a proper tribunal for the trial of claims\r\nfounded upon Mexican grants. This claim was there tried, and if fraud\r\naffected the judgment it is not, I think, chargeable to the Government;\r\nthe contest was chiefly between rival claimants. In this state of the\r\ncase it would seem that if the United States consents to open the\r\nlitigation and to wipe out all judicial findings and decrees a less\r\nexacting measure of damages than that proposed in the bill should be\r\nagreed on.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose, as I have intimated, to express the opinion that\r\nMr. McGarrahan is entitled to no relief. It seems to me, however, clear\r\nthat he is not entitled to the relief given by this bill, and that it\r\ndoes not adequately protect the interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 3, 1892_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval the bill (S. 1111) entitled \"An\r\nact to amend the act of Congress approved March 3, 1887, entitled 'An\r\nact to provide for the bringing of suits against the Government of the\r\nUnited States.'\"\r\n\r\nIf I may judge from the very limited discussion of this measure in\r\nCongress, the sweeping effects of it upon the administration of the\r\npublic lands could hardly have been fully realized. From the beginning\r\nof the Government the administration of the public lands and the issuing\r\nof patents under the land laws have been an Executive function.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the courts as to contesting claims for patents has\r\nawaited the action of the General Land Office. Land offices have been\r\nestablished and maintained in all the districts where public lands were\r\nfound, located with reference to the convenience of the settlers, and\r\nthe proceedings have been informal and inexpensive. It is true that at\r\ntimes, by an administration of the Land Office unfriendly toward the\r\nsettlers, unnecessary delays involving much hardship have intervened in\r\nthe issuing of patents, but such is not the case now. The work of the\r\nLand Office within the last three years has been so efficient and so\r\nfriendly to the _bona fide_ settler that the large accumulation of cases\r\nthere has been swept away, and the office, as I am informed by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, is now engaged upon current business.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that a transfer in whole or in part of this business to\r\nthe courts, some of whose dockets are already loaded with cases, can not\r\ntend to expedition, while it is very manifest that, by reason of the\r\ngreater formality in the taking and presentation of evidence which would\r\nbe required in court and of the long distances which settlers would have\r\nto traverse in order to attend court, the costs in such cases would be\r\nenormously increased.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to give what is called concurrent\r\njurisdiction to the district courts of the United States and to the\r\nCourt of Claims to hear and determine all claims for land patents under\r\nany law or grant of the United States. Whether concurrent with each\r\nother or with each other and the Land Office is not clear.\r\n\r\nIt is quite doubtful under the rulings of the Supreme Court whether the\r\ncourts now provided by law for the Territories are \"district courts of\r\nthe United States\" within the meaning of this bill. The effect of this\r\nlegislation would, if they were held not to be such, be that as to all\r\nsuits relating to lands in the Territories of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah,\r\nand Oklahoma no other forum is provided than the Court of Claims at\r\nWashington. In this state of the case a settler, or one who has taken\r\na mineral claim in any of these Territories, would be subject to be\r\nbrought to the city of Washington for the trial of his case.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that all recent legislation of Congress has been\r\nin the direction of subdividing judicial districts and of bringing the\r\nUnited States courts nearer to the litigants, I can only attribute to\r\noversight the passage of this bill, which in my opinion would burden the\r\nhomesteader and preemptor whose claim is contested, whether by another\r\nindividual or by any corporation, by compelling him to appear at\r\nWashington and to conduct with the formality and expense incident to\r\ncourt proceedings the defense of his title. But even in the case of\r\nland contests arising in the States where district courts exist the\r\nplaintiff, it will be observed, by this act is given the option to sue\r\nin those courts or to bring his adversary to Washington to litigate\r\nthe claim. Why should he have this advantage, one that is not given so\r\nfar as I know in any other law fixing the forum of litigation between\r\nindividuals? Not only is this true, but the Court of Claims was\r\nestablished for the trial of cases between individuals and corporations\r\non the one side and the United States on the other, and so far as I now\r\nrecall wholly for the trial of money claims.\r\n\r\nThere are no adequate provisions of law, if any at all, for conducting\r\nsuits between individuals contesting private rights. The court has one\r\nbailiff and one messenger, no marshal, and is not provided, I think,\r\neither with the machinery or with the appropriation to send its\r\nprocesses to the most distant parts of the country. Yet it is apparent\r\nthat under this bill the real issue would frequently be between rival\r\nclaimants, and not between either and the United States. This court,\r\ntoo, is already burdened with business since the reference to it of the\r\nIndian depredation claims, the French spoliation claims, etc., and it\r\ncertainly can not be thought that a more speedy settlement of land\r\nclaims could be there obtained than is now given.\r\n\r\nAgain, the bill is so indefinite in its provisions that it can not be\r\ntold, I think, what function, if any, remains to be discharged by the\r\nGeneral Land Office. It was said in answer to an interrogatory when the\r\nbill was under consideration that it did not affect claims pending in\r\nthe Land Office; and yet it seems to me that its effect is to allow any\r\ncontestant in the Land Office at any stage of the proceedings there to\r\ntransfer the whole controversy to the courts. He may take his chances of\r\nsuccess in the Land Office, and if at any time he becomes apprehensive\r\nof an adverse decision he may begin _de novo_ in the courts.\r\n\r\nIf it was intended to preserve the jurisdiction of the Land Office and\r\nto hold cases there until a judgment had been reached, the bill should\r\nhave so provided, for it is capable of, and indeed seems to me compels,\r\nthe construction that either party may forsake the Land Office at any\r\nstage of a contest. I am quite inclined to believe that if provision\r\nwere made, as in section 1063 of the Revised Statutes, relating to\r\nclaims in other departments, for the transfer to a proper court, under\r\nproper regulations, of certain contest cases involving questions\r\naffecting large classes of claims, it would be a relief to the Land\r\nOffice and would tend to a more speedy adjustment of land titles in such\r\ncases, a result which would be in the interest of all our people.\r\n\r\nNothing is more disadvantageous to a community, its progress and peace,\r\nthan unsettled land titles. This bill, however, as I have said, is so\r\nradical and seems to me to be so indefinite in its provisions that\r\nI can not give it my approval.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

FOSTER,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of Congress approved July 26, 1892, entitled \"An act\r\nto enforce reciprocal commercial relations between the United States and\r\nCanada, and for other purposes,\" it is provided--\r\n\r\n  That with a view of securing reciprocal advantages for the citizens,\r\n  ports, and vessels of the United States, on and after the 1st day\r\n  of August, 1892, whenever and so often as the President shall be\r\n  satisfied that the passage through any canal or lock connected with the\r\n  navigation of the St. Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, or the waterways\r\n  connecting the same of any vessels of the United States, or of cargoes\r\n  or passengers in transit to any port of the United States, is\r\n  prohibited or is made difficult or burdensome by the imposition of\r\n  tolls or otherwise which, in view of the free passage through the St.\r\n  Marys Falls Canal now permitted to vessels of all nations, he shall\r\n  deem to be reciprocally unjust and unreasonable, he shall have the\r\n  power, and it shall be his duty, to suspend, by proclamation to that\r\n  effect, for such time and to such extent (including absolute\r\n  prohibition) as he shall deem just, the right of free passage through\r\n  the St. Marys Falls Canal so far as it relates to vessels owned by the\r\n  subjects of the government so discriminating against the citizens,\r\n  ports, or vessels of the United States or to any cargoes, portions of\r\n  cargoes, or passengers in transit to the ports of the government making\r\n  such discrimination, whether carried in vessels of the United States or\r\n  of other nations.\r\n\r\n  In such case and during such suspension tolls shall be levied,\r\n  collected, and paid as follows, to wit: Upon freight of whatever kind\r\n  or description not to exceed $2 per ton, upon passengers not to exceed\r\n  $5 each, as shall be from time to time determined by the President:\r\n  _Provided_, That no tolls shall be charged or collected upon freight\r\n  or passengers carried to and landed at Ogdensburg, or any port west of\r\n  Ogdensburg and south of a line drawn from the northern boundary of the\r\n  State of New York through the St. Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, and\r\n  their connecting channels to the northern boundary of the State of\r\n  Minnesota.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. All tolls so charged shall be collected under such\r\n  regulations as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\n  who may require the master of each vessel to furnish a sworn statement\r\n  of the amount and kind of cargo and the number of passengers carried\r\n  and the destination of the same, and such proof of the actual delivery\r\n  of such cargo or passengers at some port or place within the limits\r\n  above named as he shall deem satisfactory; and until such proof is\r\n  furnished such freight and passengers may be considered to have been\r\n  landed at some port or place outside of those limits, and the amount\r\n  of tolls which would have accrued if they had been so delivered shall\r\n  constitute a lien, which may be enforced against the vessel in default\r\n  wherever and whenever found in the waters of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the government of the Dominion of Canada imposes a toll\r\namounting to about 20 cents per ton on all freight passing through the\r\nWelland Canal in transit to a port of the United States, and also a\r\nfurther toll on all vessels of the United States and on all passengers\r\nin transit to a port of the United States, all of which tolls are\r\nwithout rebate; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the government of the Dominion of Canada, in accordance with\r\nan order in council of April 4, 1892, refunds 18 cents per ton of the\r\n20-cent toll at the Welland Canal on wheat, Indian corn, pease, barley,\r\nrye, oats, flaxseed, and buckwheat upon condition that they are\r\noriginally shipped for and carried to Montreal or some port east of\r\nMontreal for export, and that if transshipped at an intermediate point\r\nsuch transshipment is made within the Dominion of Canada, but allows no\r\nsuch nor any other rebate on said products when shipped to a port of\r\nthe United States or when carried to Montreal for export if transshipped\r\nwithin the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the government of the Dominion of Canada by said system of\r\nrebate and otherwise discriminates against the citizens of the United\r\nStates in the use of said Welland Canal, in violation of the provisions\r\nof Article XXVII of the treaty of Washington concluded May 8, 1871; and\r\n\r\nWhereas said Welland Canal is connected with the navigation of the Great\r\nLakes, and I am satisfied that the passage through it of cargoes in\r\ntransit to ports of the United States is made difficult and burdensome\r\nby said discriminating system of rebate and otherwise and is\r\nreciprocally unjust and unreasonable:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Benjamin, Harrison, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, by virtue of the power to that end conferred upon me by said\r\nact of Congress approved July 26, 1892, do hereby direct that from and\r\nafter September 1, 1892, until further notice a toll of 20 cents per\r\nton be levied, collected, and paid on all freight of whatever kind or\r\ndescription passing through the St. Marys Falls Canal in transit to any\r\nport of the Dominion of Canada, whether carried in vessels of the United\r\nStates or of other nations; and to that extent I do hereby suspend from\r\nand after said date the right of free passage through said St. Marys\r\nFalls Canal of any and all cargoes or portions of cargoes in transit\r\nto Canadian ports.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 18th day of August, A.D. 1892, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and\r\nseventeenth.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

A comparison of the existing conditions with those of the\r\nmost favored period in the history of the country will, I believe, show\r\nthat so high a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the\r\ncomforts of life were never before enjoyed by our people.\r\n\r\nThe total wealth of the country in 1860 was $16,159,616,068. In 1890 it\r\namounted to $62,610,000,000, an increase of 287 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe total mileage of railways in the United States in 1860 was 30,626.\r\nIn 1890 it was 167,741, an increase of 448 per cent; and it is estimated\r\nthat there will be about 4,000 miles of track added by the close of the\r\nyear 1892.\r\n\r\nThe official returns of the Eleventh Census and those of the Tenth\r\nCensus for seventy-five leading cities furnish the basis for the\r\nfollowing comparisons:\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the capital invested in manufacturing was $1,232,839,670.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the capital invested in manufacturing was $2,900,735,884.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the number of employees was 1,301,388.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the number of employees was 2,251,134.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the wages earned were $501,965,778.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the wages earned were $1,221,170,454.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the value of the product was $2,711,579,899.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the value of the product was $4,860,286,837.\r\n\r\nI am informed by the Superintendent of the Census that the omission of\r\ncertain industries in 1880 which were included in 1890 accounts in part\r\nfor the remarkable increase thus shown, but after making full allowance\r\nfor differences of method and deducting the returns for all industries\r\nnot included in the census of 1880 there remain in the reports from\r\nthese seventy-five cities an increase in the capital employed of\r\n$1,522,745,604, in the value of the product of $2,024,236,166, in wages\r\nearned of $677,943,929, and in the number of wage earners employed of\r\n856,029. The wage earnings not only show an increased aggregate, but an\r\nincrease per capita from $386 in 1880 to $547 in 1890, or 41.71 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe new industrial plants established since October 6, 1890, and up\r\nto October 22, 1892, as partially reported in the American Economist,\r\nnumber 345, and the extension of existing plants 108; the new capital\r\ninvested amounts to $40,449,050, and the number of additional employees\r\nto 37,285.\r\n\r\nThe Textile World for July, 1892, states that during the first six\r\nmonths of the present calendar year 135 new factories were built, of\r\nwhich 40 are cotton mills, 48 knitting mills, 26 woolen mills, 15 silk\r\nmills, 4 plush mills, and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton mills 21 have\r\nbeen built in the Southern States. Mr. A.B. Shepperson, of the New York\r\nCotton Exchange, estimates the number of working spindles in the United\r\nStates on September 1, 1892, at 15,200,000, an increase of 660,000 over\r\nthe year 1891. The consumption of cotton by American mills in 1891 was\r\n2,396,000 bales, and in 1892 2,584,000 bales, an increase of 188,000\r\nbales. From the year 1869 to 1892, inclusive, there has been an increase\r\nin the consumption of cotton in Europe of 92 per cent, while during the\r\nsame period the increased consumption in the United States has been\r\nabout 150 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe report of Ira Ayer, special agent of the Treasury Department,\r\nshows that at the date of September 30, 1892, there were 32 companies\r\nmanufacturing tin and terne plate in the United States and 14 companies\r\nbuilding new works for such manufacture. The estimated investment in\r\nbuildings and plants at the close of the fiscal year June 30, 1893,\r\nif existing conditions were to be continued, was $5,000,000 and the\r\nestimated rate of production 200,000,000 pounds per annum. The Actual\r\nproduction for the quarter ending September 30, 1892, was 10,952,725\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe report of Labor Commissioner Peck, of New York, shows that during\r\nthe year 1891, in about 6,000 manufacturing establishments in that State\r\nembraced within the special inquiry made by him, and representing 67\r\ndifferent industries, there was a net increase over the year 1890 of\r\n$31,315,130.68 in the value of the product and of $6,377,925.09 in the\r\namount of wages paid. The report of the commissioner of labor for the\r\nState of Massachusetts shows that 3,745 industries in that State paid\r\n$129,416,248 in wages during the year 1891, against $126,030,303 in\r\n1890, an increase of $3,335,945, and that there was an increase of\r\n$9,932,490 in the amount of capital and of 7,346 in the number of\r\npersons employed in the same period.\r\n\r\nDuring the last six months of the year 1891 and the first six months\r\nof 1892 the total production of pig iron was 9,710,819 tons, as against\r\n9,202,703 tons in the year 1890, which was the largest annual production\r\never attained. For the same twelve months of 1891-92 the production of\r\nBessemer ingots was 3,878,581 tons, an increase of 189,710 gross tons\r\nover the previously unprecedented yearly production of 3,688,871 gross\r\ntons in 1890. The production of Bessemer steel rails for the first six\r\nmonths of 1892 was 772,436 gross tons, as against 702,080 gross tons\r\nduring the last six months of the year 1891.\r\n\r\nThe total value of our foreign trade (exports and imports of\r\nmerchandise) during the last fiscal year was $1,857,680,610, an increase\r\nof $128,283,604 over the previous fiscal year. The average annual value\r\nof our imports and exports of merchandise for the ten fiscal years prior\r\nto 1891 was $1,457,322,019. It will be observed that our foreign trade\r\nfor 1892 exceeded this annual average value by $400,358,591, an increase\r\nof 27.47 Per cent. The significance and value of this increase are shown\r\nby the fact that the excess in the trade of 1892 over 1891 was wholly in\r\nthe value of exports, for there was a decrease in the value of imports\r\nof $17,513,754.\r\n\r\nThe value of our exports during the fiscal year 1892 reached the highest\r\nfigure in the history of the Government, amounting to $1,030,278,148,\r\nexceeding by $145,797,338 the exports of 1891 and exceeding the value of\r\nthe imports by $202,875,686. A comparison of the value of our exports\r\nfor 1892 with the annual average for the ten years prior to 1891 shows\r\nan excess of $265,142,651, or of 34.65 per cent. The value of our\r\nimports of merchandise for 1892, which was $829,402,462, also exceeded\r\nthe annual average value of the ten years prior to 1891 by $135,215,940.\r\nDuring the fiscal year 1892 the value of imports free of duty amounted\r\nto $457,999,658, the largest aggregate in the history of our commerce.\r\nThe value of the imports of merchandise entered free of duty in 1892 was\r\n55.35 per cent of the total value of imports, as compared with 43.35 per\r\ncent in 1891 and 33.66 per cent in 1890.\r\n\r\nIn our coastwise trade a most encouraging development is in progress,\r\nthere having been in the last four years an increase of 16 per cent. In\r\ninternal commerce the statistics show that no such period of prosperity\r\nhas ever before existed. The freight carried in the coastwise trade of\r\nthe Great Lakes in 1890 aggregated 28,295,959 tons. On the Mississippi,\r\nMissouri, and Ohio rivers and tributaries in the same year the traffic\r\naggregated 29,405,046 tons, and the total vessel tonnage passing through\r\nthe Detroit River during that year was 21,684,000 tons. The vessel\r\ntonnage entered and cleared in the foreign trade of London during 1890\r\namounted to 13,480,767 tons, and of Liverpool 10,941,800 tons, a total\r\nfor these two great shipping ports of 24,422,568 tons, only slightly in\r\nexcess of the vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit River. And it\r\nshould be said that the season for the Detroit River was but 228 days,\r\nwhile of course in London and Liverpool the season was for the entire\r\nyear. The vessel tonnage passing through the St. Marys Canal for the\r\nfiscal year 1892 amounted to 9,828,874 tons, and the freight tonnage of\r\nthe Detroit River is estimated for that year at 25,000,000 tons, against\r\n23,209,619 tons in 1891. The aggregate traffic on our railroads for\r\nthe year 1891 amounted to 704,398,609 tons of freight, compared with\r\n691,344,437 tons in 1890, an increase of 13,054,172 tons.\r\n\r\nAnother indication of the general prosperity of the country is found in\r\nthe fact that the number of depositors in savings banks increased from\r\n693,870 in 1860 to 4,258,893 in 1890, an increase of 513 per cent, and\r\nthe amount of deposits from $149,277,504 in 1860 to $1,524,844,506 in\r\n1890, an increase of 921 per cent. In 1891 the amount of deposits in\r\nsavings banks was $1,623,079,749. It is estimated that 90 per cent\r\nof these deposits represent the savings of wage earners. The bank\r\nclearances for nine months ending September 30, 1891, amounted\r\nto $41,049,390,808. For the same months in 1892 they amounted to\r\n$45,189,601,947, an excess for the nine months of $4,140,211,139.\r\n\r\nThere never has been a time in our history when work was so abundant or\r\nwhen wages were as high, whether measured by the currency in which they\r\nare paid or by their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of\r\nlife. It is true that the market prices of cotton and wheat have been\r\nlow. It is one of the unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the\r\nfarmer can not produce upon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance of\r\nthe aggregate production of the year, and is peculiarly subject to the\r\ndepreciation which follows overproduction. But while the fact I have\r\nstated is true as to the crops mentioned, the general average of prices\r\nhas been such as to give to agriculture a fair participation in the\r\ngeneral prosperity. The value of our total farm products has increased\r\nfrom $1,363,646,866 in 1860 to $4,500,000,000 in 1891, as estimated by\r\nstatisticians, an increase of 230 per cent. The number of hogs January\r\n1, 1891, was 50,625,106 and their value $210,193,925; on January 1,\r\n1892, the number was 52,398,019 and the value $241,031,415. On January\r\n1, 1891, the number of cattle was 36,875,648 and the value $544,127,908;\r\non January 1, 1892, the number was 37,651,239 and the value\r\n$570,749,155.\r\n\r\nIf any are discontented with their state here, if any believe that wages\r\nor prices, the returns for honest toil, are inadequate, they should not\r\nfail to remember that there is no other country in the world where the\r\nconditions that seem to them hard would not be accepted as highly\r\nprosperous. The English agriculturist would be glad to exchange the\r\nreturns of his labor for those of the American farmer and the Manchester\r\nworkmen their wages for those of their fellows at Fall River.\r\n\r\nI believe that the protective system, which has now for something more\r\nthan thirty years continuously prevailed in our legislation, has been a\r\nmighty instrument for the development of our national wealth and a most\r\npowerful agency in protecting the homes of our workingmen from the\r\ninvasion of want. I have felt a most solicitous interest to preserve to\r\nour working people rates of wages that would not only give daily bread,\r\nbut supply a comfortable margin for those home attractions and family\r\ncomforts and enjoyments without which life is neither hopeful nor sweet.\r\nThey are American citizens--a part of the great people for whom our\r\nConstitution and Government were framed and instituted--and it can not\r\nbe a perversion of that Constitution to so legislate as to preserve in\r\ntheir homes the comfort, independence, loyalty, and sense of interest\r\nin the Government which are essential to good citizenship in peace, and\r\nwhich will bring this stalwart throng, as in 1861, to the defense of\r\nthe flag when it is assailed.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to renew here the argument in favor of a protective\r\ntariff. The result of the recent election must be accepted as having\r\nintroduced a new policy. We must assume that the present tariff,\r\nconstructed upon the lines of protection, is to be repealed and that\r\nthere is to be substituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with\r\nreference to revenue; that no duty is to be higher because the increase\r\nwill keep open an American mill or keep up the wages of an American\r\nworkman, but that in every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as\r\nwill bring to the Treasury of the United States the largest returns of\r\nrevenue. The contention has not been between schedules, but between\r\nprinciples, and it would be offensive to suggest that the prevailing\r\nparty will not carry into legislation the principles advocated by it and\r\nthe pledges given to the people. The tariff bills passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives at the last session were, as I suppose, even in the\r\nopinion of their promoters, inadequate, and justified only by the fact\r\nthat the Senate and House of Representatives were not in accord and that\r\na general revision could not therefore be undertaken.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the\r\nincoming Congress. It is matter of regret that this work must be delayed\r\nfor at least three months, for the threat of great tariff changes\r\nintroduces so much uncertainty that an amount, not easily estimated, of\r\nbusiness inaction and of diminished production will necessarily result.\r\nIt is possible also that this uncertainty may result in decreased\r\nrevenues from customs duties, for our merchants will make cautious\r\norders for foreign goods in view of the prospect of tariff reductions\r\nand the uncertainty as to when they will take effect. Those who have\r\nadvocated a protective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous\r\nforecasts of a change of policy disappointed. If a system of customs\r\nduties can be framed that will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe\r\nin motion and crowd our warehouses with foreign-made goods and at the\r\nsame time keep our own mills busy; that will give us an increased\r\nparticipation in the \"markets of the world\" of greater value than the\r\nhome market we surrender; that will give increased work to foreign\r\nworkmen upon products to be consumed by our people without diminishing\r\nthe amount of work to be done here; that will enable the American\r\nmanufacturer to pay to his workmen from 50 to 100 per cent more in wages\r\nthan is paid in the foreign mill, and yet to compete in our market and\r\nin foreign markets with the foreign producer; that will further reduce\r\nthe cost of articles of wear and food without reducing the wages of\r\nthose who produce them; that can be celebrated, after its effects have\r\nbeen realized, as its expectation has been in European as well as in\r\nAmerican cities, the authors and promoters of it will be entitled to the\r\nhighest praise. We have had in our history several experiences of the\r\ncontrasted effects of a revenue and of a protective tariff, but this\r\ngeneration has not felt them, and the experience of one generation is\r\nnot highly instructive to the next. The friends of the protective system\r\nwith undiminished confidence in the principles they have advocated will\r\nawait the results of the new experiment.\r\n\r\nThe strained and too often disturbed relations existing between the\r\nemployees and the employers in our great manufacturing establishments\r\nhave not been favorable to a calm consideration by the wage earner of\r\nthe effect upon wages of the protective system. The facts that his\r\nwages were the highest paid in like callings in the world and that a\r\nmaintenance of this rate of wages in the absence of protective duties\r\nupon the product of his labor was impossible were obscured by the\r\npassion evoked by these contests. He may now be able to review the\r\nquestion in the light of his personal experience under the operation of\r\na tariff for revenue only. If that experience shall demonstrate that\r\npresent rates of wages are thereby maintained or increased, either\r\nabsolutely or in their purchasing power, and that the aggregate volume\r\nof work to be done in this country is increased or even maintained, so\r\nthat there are more or as many days' work in a year, at as good or\r\nbetter wages, for the American workmen as has been the case under the\r\nprotective system, everyone will rejoice. A general process of wage\r\nreduction can not be contemplated by any patriotic citizen without the\r\ngravest apprehension. It may be, indeed I believe is, possible for the\r\nAmerican manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign rival in\r\nmany branches of production without the defense of protective duties if\r\nthe pay rolls are equalized; but the conflict that stands between the\r\nproducer and that result and the distress of our working people when\r\nit is attained are not pleasant to contemplate. The Society of the\r\nUnemployed, now holding its frequent and threatening parades in the\r\nstreets of foreign cities, should not be allowed to acquire an American\r\ndomicile.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the heads of the several Executive Departments which are\r\nherewith submitted, have very naturally included a resume of the whole\r\nwork of the Administration with the transactions of the last fiscal\r\nyear. The attention not only of Congress but of the country is again\r\ninvited to the methods of administration which have been pursued and\r\nto the results which have been attained. Public revenues amounting to\r\n$1,414,079,292.28 have been collected and disbursed without loss from\r\nmisappropriation, without a single defalcation of such importance as\r\nto attract the public attention, and at a diminished per cent of cost\r\nfor collection. The public business has been transacted not only with\r\nfidelity, but progressively and with a view to giving to the people in\r\nthe fullest possible degree the benefits of a service established and\r\nmaintained for their protection and comfort.\r\n\r\nOur relations with other nations are now undisturbed by any serious\r\ncontroversy. The complicated and threatening differences with Germany\r\nand England relating to Samoan affairs, with England in relation to the\r\nseal fisheries in the Bering Sea, and with Chile growing out of the\r\n_Baltimore_ affair have been adjusted.\r\n\r\nThere have been negotiated and concluded, under section 3 of the tariff\r\nlaw, commercial agreements relating to reciprocal trade with the\r\nfollowing countries: Brazil, Dominican Republic, Spain for Cuba and\r\nPuerto Rico, Guatemala, Salvador, the German Empire, Great Britain for\r\ncertain West Indian colonies and British Guiana, Nicaragua, Honduras,\r\nand Austria-Hungary.[31]\r\n\r\nOf these, those with Guatemala, Salvador, the German Empire, Great\r\nBritain, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Austria-Hungary have been concluded\r\nsince my last annual message. Under these trade arrangements a free or\r\nfavored admission has been secured in every case for an important list\r\nof American products. Especial care has been taken to secure markets for\r\nfarm products, in order to relieve that great underlying industry of the\r\ndepression which the lack of an adequate foreign market for our surplus\r\noften brings. An opening has also been made for manufactured products\r\nthat will undoubtedly, if this policy is maintained, greatly augment\r\nour export trade. The full benefits of these arrangements can not be\r\nrealized instantly. New lines of trade are to be opened. The commercial\r\ntraveler must survey the field. The manufacturer must adapt his goods\r\nto the new markets and facilities for exchange must be established.\r\nThis work has been well begun, our merchants and manufacturers having\r\nentered the new fields with courage and enterprise. In the case of food\r\nproducts, and especially with Cuba, the trade did not need to wait, and\r\nthe immediate results have been most gratifying. If this policy and\r\nthese trade arrangements can be continued in force and aided by the\r\nestablishment of American steamship lines, I do not doubt that we shall\r\nwithin a short period secure fully one-third of the total trade of the\r\ncountries of Central and South America, which now amounts to about\r\n$600,000,000 annually. In 1885 we had only 8 per cent of this trade.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics show the increase in our trade with the\r\ncountries with which we have reciprocal trade agreements from the date\r\nwhen such agreements went into effect up to September 30, 1892, the\r\nincrease being in some almost wholly and in others in an important\r\ndegree the result of these agreements:\r\n\r\nThe domestic exports to Germany and Austria-Hungary have increased in\r\nvalue from $47,673,756 to $57,993,064, an increase of $10,319,308, or\r\n21.63 per cent. With American countries the value of our exports has\r\nincreased from $44,160,285 to $54,613,598, an increase of $10,453,313,\r\nor 23.67 per cent. The total increase in the value of exports to\r\nall the countries with which we have reciprocity agreements has been\r\n$20,772,621. This increase is chiefly in wheat, flour, meat, and dairy\r\nproducts and in manufactures of iron and steel and lumber. There has\r\nbeen a large increase in the value of imports from all these countries\r\nsince the commercial agreements went into effect, amounting to\r\n$74,294,525, but it has been entirely in imports from the American\r\ncountries, consisting mostly of sugar, coffee, india rubber, and crude\r\ndrugs. The alarmed attention of our European competitors for the South\r\nAmerican market has been attracted to this new American policy and to\r\nour acquisition and their loss of South American trade.\r\n\r\nA treaty providing for the arbitration of the dispute between Great\r\nBritain and the United States as to the killing of seals in the\r\nBering Sea was concluded on the 29th of February last. This treaty was\r\naccompanied by an agreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the\r\narbitration, and a vigorous effort was made during this season to drive\r\nout all poaching sealers from the Bering Sea. Six naval vessels, three\r\nrevenue cutters, and one vessel from the Fish Commission, all under\r\nthe command of Commander Evans, of the Navy, were sent into the sea,\r\nwhich was systematically patrolled. Some seizures were made, and it is\r\nbelieved that the catch in the Bering Sea by poachers amounted to less\r\nthan 500 seals. It is true, however, that in the North Pacific, while\r\nthe seal herds were on their way to the passes between the Aleutian\r\nIslands, a very large number, probably 35,000, were taken. The existing\r\nstatutes of the United States do not restrain our citizens from taking\r\nseals in the Pacific Ocean, and perhaps should not unless the\r\nprohibition can be extended to the citizens of other nations. I\r\nrecommend that power be given to the President by proclamation to\r\nprohibit the taking of seals in the North Pacific by American vessels\r\nin case, either as the result of the findings of the Tribunal of\r\nArbitration or otherwise, the restraints can be applied to the vessels\r\nof all countries. The case of the United States for the Tribunal of\r\nArbitration has been prepared with great care and industry by the Hon.\r\nJohn W. Foster, and the counsel who represent this Government express\r\nconfidence that a result substantially establishing our claims and\r\npreserving this great industry for the benefit of all nations will\r\nbe attained.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year a suggestion was received through the British\r\nminister that the Canadian government would like to confer as to the\r\npossibility of enlarging upon terms of mutual advantage the commercial\r\nexchanges of Canada and of the United States, and a conference was\r\nheld at Washington, with Mr. Blaine acting for this Government and the\r\nBritish minister at this capital and three members of the Dominion\r\ncabinet acting as commissioners on the part of Great Britain. The\r\nconference developed the fact that the Canadian government was only\r\nprepared to offer to the United States in exchange for the concessions\r\nasked the admission of natural products. The statement was frankly made\r\nthat favored rates could not be given to the United States as against\r\nthe mother country. This admission, which was foreseen, necessarily\r\nterminated the conference upon this question. The benefits of an\r\nexchange of natural products would be almost wholly with the people\r\nof Canada. Some other topics of interest were considered in the\r\nconference, and have resulted in the making of a convention for\r\nexamining the Alaskan boundary and the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay\r\nadjacent to Eastport, Me., and in the initiation of an arrangement for\r\nthe protection of fish life in the coterminous and neighboring waters\r\nof our northern border.\r\n\r\nThe controversy as to tolls upon the Welland Canal, which was presented\r\nto Congress at the last session by special message,[32] having failed of\r\nadjustment, I felt constrained to exercise the authority conferred by\r\nthe act of July 26, 1892, and to proclaim a suspension of the free use\r\nof St. Marys Falls Canal to cargoes in transit to ports in Canada.[33]\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury established such tolls as were thought to\r\nbe equivalent to the exactions unjustly levied upon our commerce in the\r\nCanadian canals.\r\n\r\nIf, as we must suppose, the political relations of Canada and the\r\ndisposition of the Canadian government are to remain unchanged, a\r\nsomewhat radical revision of our trade relations should, I think, be\r\nmade. Our relations must continue to be intimate, and they should be\r\nfriendly. I regret to say, however, that in many of the controversies,\r\nnotably those as to the fisheries on the Atlantic, the sealing interests\r\non the Pacific, and the canal tolls, our negotiations with Great Britain\r\nhave continuously been thwarted or retarded by unreasonable and\r\nunfriendly objections and protests from Canada. In the matter of the\r\ncanal tolls our treaty rights were flagrantly disregarded. It is hardly\r\ntoo much to say that the Canadian Pacific and other railway lines which\r\nparallel our northern boundary are sustained by commerce having either\r\nits origin or terminus, or both, in the United States. Canadian\r\nrailroads compete with those of the United States for our traffic, and\r\nwithout the restraints of our interstate-commerce act. Their cars pass\r\nalmost without detention into and out of our territory.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway brought into the United States from China\r\nand Japan via British Columbia during the year ended June 30, 1892,\r\n23,239,689 pounds of freight, and it carried from the United States, to\r\nbe shipped to China and Japan via British Columbia, 24,068,346 pounds of\r\nfreight. There were also shipped from the United States over this road\r\nfrom Eastern ports of the United States to our Pacific ports during the\r\nsame year 13,912,073 pounds of freight, and there were received over\r\nthis road at the United States Eastern ports from ports on the Pacific\r\nCoast 13,293,315 pounds of freight. Mr. Joseph Nimmo, jr., former chief\r\nof the Bureau of Statistics, when before the Senate Select Committee on\r\nRelations with Canada, April 26, 1890, said that \"the value of goods\r\nthus transported between different points in the United States across\r\nCanadian territory probably amounts to $100,000,000 a year.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no disposition on the part of the people or Government of the\r\nUnited States to interfere in the smallest degree with the political\r\nrelations of Canada. That question is wholly with her own people. It\r\nis time for us, however, to consider whether, if the present state of\r\nthings and trend of things is to continue, our interchanges upon lines\r\nof land transportation should not be put upon a different basis and our\r\nentire independence of Canadian canals and of the St. Lawrence as an\r\noutlet to the sea secured by the construction of an American canal\r\naround the Falls of Niagara and the opening of ship communication\r\nbetween the Great Lakes and one of our own seaports. We should not\r\nhesitate to avail ourselves of our great natural trade advantages.\r\nWe should withdraw the support which is given to the railroads and\r\nsteamship lines of Canada by a traffic that properly belongs to us and\r\nno longer furnish the earnings which lighten the otherwise crushing\r\nweight of the enormous public subsidies that have been given to them.\r\nThe subject of the power of the Treasury to deal with this matter\r\nwithout further legislation has been under consideration, but\r\ncircumstances have postponed a conclusion. It is probable that a\r\nconsideration of the propriety of a modification or abrogation of the\r\narticle of the treaty of Washington relating to the transit of goods\r\nin bond is involved in any complete solution of the question.\r\n\r\nCongress at the last session was kept advised of the progress of the\r\nserious and for a time threatening difference between the United States\r\nand Chile. It gives me now great gratification to report that the\r\nChilean Government in a most friendly and honorable spirit has tendered\r\nand paid as an indemnity to the families of the sailors of the\r\n_Baltimore_ who were killed and to those who were injured in the\r\noutbreak in the city of Valparaiso the sum of $75,000. This has been\r\naccepted not only as an indemnity for a wrong done, but as a most\r\ngratifying evidence that the Government of Chile rightly appreciates the\r\ndisposition of this Government to act in a spirit of the most absolute\r\nfairness and friendliness in our intercourse with that brave people.\r\nA further and conclusive evidence of the mutual respect and confidence\r\nnow existing is furnished by the fact that a convention submitting to\r\narbitration the mutual claims of the citizens of the respective\r\nGovernments has been agreed upon. Some of these claims have been pending\r\nfor many years and have been the occasion of much unsatisfactory\r\ndiplomatic correspondence.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored in every way to assure our sister Republics of Central\r\nand South America that the United States Government and its people have\r\nonly the most friendly disposition toward them all. We do not covet\r\ntheir territory. We have no disposition to be oppressive or exacting in\r\nour dealings with any of them, even the weakest. Our interests and our\r\nhopes for them all lie in the direction of stable governments by their\r\npeople and of the largest development of their great commercial\r\nresources. The mutual benefits of enlarged commercial exchanges and of a\r\nmore familiar and friendly intercourse between our peoples we do desire,\r\nand in this have sought their friendly cooperation.\r\n\r\nI have believed, however, while holding these sentiments in the\r\ngreatest sincerity, that we must insist upon a just responsibility for\r\nany injuries inflicted upon our official representatives or upon our\r\ncitizens. This insistence, kindly and justly but firmly made, will,\r\nI believe, promote peace and mutual respect.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Hawaii have been such as to attract an increased\r\ninterest, and must continue to do so. I deem it of great importance that\r\nthe projected submarine cable, a survey for which has been made, should\r\nbe promoted. Both for naval and commercial uses we should have quick\r\ncommunication with Honolulu. We should before this have availed\r\nourselves of the concession made many years ago to this Government\r\nfor a harbor and naval station at Pearl River. Many evidences of the\r\nfriendliness of the Hawaiian Government have been given in the past,\r\nand it is gratifying to believe that the advantage and necessity of\r\na continuance of very close relations is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe friendly act of this Government in expressing to the Government of\r\nItaly its reprobation and abhorrence of the lynching of Italian subjects\r\nin New Orleans by the payment of 125,000 francs, or $24,330.90, was\r\naccepted by the King of Italy with every manifestation of gracious\r\nappreciation, and the incident has been highly promotive of mutual\r\nrespect and good will.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the action of the French Government in proclaiming a\r\nprotectorate over certain tribal districts of the west coast of Africa\r\neastward of the San Pedro River, which has long been regarded as the\r\nsoutheastern boundary of Liberia, I have felt constrained to make\r\nprotest against this encroachment upon the territory of a Republic which\r\nwas founded by citizens of the United States and toward which this\r\ncountry has for many years held the intimate relation of a friendly\r\ncounselor.\r\n\r\nThe recent disturbances of the public peace by lawless foreign marauders\r\non the Mexican frontier have afforded this Government an opportunity to\r\ntestify its good will for Mexico and its earnest purpose to fulfill the\r\nobligations of international friendship by pursuing and dispersing the\r\nevil doers. The work of relocating the boundary of the treaty of\r\nGuadalupe Hidalgo westward from El Paso is progressing favorably.\r\n\r\nOur intercourse with Spain continues on a friendly footing. I regret,\r\nhowever, not to be able to report as yet the adjustment of the claims of\r\nthe American missionaries arising from the disorders at Ponape, in the\r\nCaroline Islands, but I anticipate a satisfactory adjustment in view of\r\nrenewed and urgent representations to the Government at Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the religious and educational establishments of\r\nAmerican citizens in Turkey has of late called for a more than usual\r\nshare of attention. A tendency to curtail the toleration which has so\r\nbeneficially prevailed is discernible and has called forth the earnest\r\nremonstrance of this Government. Harassing regulations in regard to\r\nschools and churches have been attempted in certain localities, but not\r\nwithout due protest and the assertion of the inherent and conventional\r\nrights of our countrymen. Violations of domicile and search of the\r\npersons and effects of citizens of the United States by apparently\r\nirresponsible officials in the Asiatic _vilayets_ have from time to time\r\nbeen reported. An aggravated instance of injury to the property of an\r\nAmerican missionary at Bourdour, in the Province of Konia, called forth\r\nan urgent claim for reparation, which I am pleased to say was promptly\r\nheeded by the Government of the Porte. Interference with the trading\r\nventures of our citizens in Asia Minor is also reported, and the lack of\r\nconsular representation in that region is a serious drawback to instant\r\nand effective protection. I can not believe that these incidents\r\nrepresent a settled policy, and shall not cease to urge the adoption of\r\nproper remedies.\r\n\r\nInternational copyright has been extended to Italy by proclamation[34]\r\nin conformity with the act of March 3, 1891, upon assurance being given\r\nthat Italian law permits to citizens of the United States the benefit of\r\ncopyright on substantially the same basis as to subjects of Italy. By a\r\nspecial convention proclaimed January 15, 1892, reciprocal provisions\r\nof copyright have been applied between the United States and Germany.\r\nNegotiations are in progress with other countries to the same end.\r\n\r\nI repeat with great earnestness the recommendation which I have made in\r\nseveral previous messages that prompt and adequate support be given to\r\nthe American company engaged in the construction of the Nicaragua ship\r\ncanal. It is impossible to overstate the value from every standpoint of\r\nthis great enterprise, and I hope that there may be time, even in this\r\nCongress, to give to it an impetus that will insure the early completion\r\nof the canal and secure to the United States its proper relation to it\r\nwhen completed.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has been already advised that the invitations of this\r\nGovernment for the assembling of an international monetary conference\r\nto consider the question of an enlarged use of silver were accepted by\r\nthe nations to which they were addressed. The conference assembled at\r\nBrussels on the 22d of November, and has entered upon the consideration\r\nof this great question. I have not doubted, and have taken occasion\r\nto express that belief as well in the invitations issued for this\r\nConference as in my public messages, that the free coinage of silver\r\nupon an agreed international ratio would greatly promote the interests\r\nof our people and equally those of other nations. It is too early to\r\npredict what results may be accomplished by the conference. If any\r\ntemporary check or delay intervenes, I believe that very soon commercial\r\nconditions will compel the now reluctant governments to unite with us in\r\nthis movement to secure the enlargement of the volume of coined money\r\nneeded for the transaction of the business of the world.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will attract especial\r\ninterest in view of the many misleading statements that have been made\r\nas to the state of the public revenues. Three preliminary facts should\r\nnot only be stated but emphasized before looking into details: First,\r\nthat the public debt has been reduced since March 4, 1889, $259,074,200\r\nand the annual interest charge $11,684,469; second, that there have been\r\npaid out for pensions during this Administration up to November 1, 1892,\r\n$432,564,178.70, an excess of $114,466,386.09 over the sum expended\r\nduring the period from March 1, 1885, to March 1, 1889; and, third, that\r\nunder the existing tariff up to December 1 about $93,000,000 of revenue\r\nwhich would have been collected upon imported sugars if the duty had\r\nbeen maintained has gone into the pockets of the people, and not into\r\nthe public Treasury, as before. If there are any who still think that\r\nthe surplus should have been kept out of circulation by hoarding it in\r\nthe Treasury, or deposited in favored banks without interest while the\r\nGovernment continued to pay to these very banks interest upon the bonds\r\ndeposited as security for the deposits, or who think that the extended\r\npension legislation was a public robbery, or that the duties upon sugar\r\nshould have been maintained, I am content to leave the argument where it\r\nnow rests while we wait to see whether these criticisms will take the\r\nform of legislation.\r\n\r\nThe revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, from all sources\r\nwere $425,868,260.22, and the expenditures for all purposes were\r\n$415,953,806.56, leaving a balance of $9,914,453.66. There were paid\r\nduring the year upon the public debt $40,570,467.98. The surplus in the\r\nTreasury and the bank redemption fund passed by the act of July 14,\r\n1890, to the general fund furnished in large part the cash available and\r\nused for the payments made upon the public debt. Compared with the year\r\n1891, our receipts from customs duties fell off $42,069,241.08, while\r\nour receipts from internal revenue increased $8,284,823.13, leaving the\r\nnet loss of revenue from these principal sources $33,784,417.95. The net\r\nloss of revenue from all sources was $32,675,972.81.\r\n\r\nThe revenues, estimated and actual, for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1893, are placed by the Secretary at $463,336,350.44, and\r\nthe expenditures at $461,336,350.44, showing a surplus of receipts over\r\nexpenditures of $2,000,000. The cash balance in the Treasury at the end\r\nof the fiscal year it is estimated will be $20,992,377.03. So far as\r\nthese figures are based upon estimates of receipts and expenditures for\r\nthe remaining months of the current fiscal year, there are not only the\r\nusual elements of uncertainty, but some added elements. New revenue\r\nlegislation, or even the expectation of it, may seriously reduce the\r\npublic revenues during the period of uncertainty and during the process\r\nof business adjustment to the new conditions when they become known.\r\nBut the Secretary has very wisely refrained from guessing as to the\r\neffect of possible changes in our revenue laws, since the scope of those\r\nchanges and the time of their taking effect can not in any degree be\r\nforecast or foretold by him. His estimates must be based upon existing\r\nlaws and upon a continuance of existing business conditions, except so\r\nfar as these conditions may be affected by causes other than new\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe estimated receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, are\r\n$490,121,365.38, and the estimated appropriations $457,261,335.33,\r\nleaving an estimated surplus of receipts over expenditures of\r\n$32,860,030.05. This does not include any payment to the sinking fund.\r\nIn the recommendation of the Secretary that the sinking-fund law be\r\nrepealed I concur. The redemption of bonds since the passage of the law\r\nto June 30, 1892, has already exceeded the requirements by the sum of\r\n$990,510,681.49. The retirement of bonds in the future before maturity\r\nshould be a matter of convenience, not of compulsion. We should not\r\ncollect revenue for that purpose, but only use any casual surplus, To\r\nthe balance of $32,860,030.05 of receipts over expenditures for the year\r\n1894 should be added the estimated surplus at the beginning of the year,\r\n$20,992,377.03, and from this aggregate there must be deducted, as\r\nstated by the Secretary, about $44,000,000 of estimated unexpended\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\nThe public confidence in the purpose and ability of the Government to\r\nmaintain the parity of all of our money issues, whether coin or paper,\r\nmust remain unshaken. The demand for gold in Europe and the consequent\r\ncalls upon us are in a considerable degree the result of the efforts of\r\nsome of the European Governments to increase their gold reserves, and\r\nthese efforts should be met by appropriate legislation on our part. The\r\nconditions that have created this drain of the Treasury gold are in an\r\nimportant degree political, and not commercial. In view of the fact that\r\na general revision of our revenue laws in the near future seems to be\r\nprobable, it would be better that any changes should be a part of that\r\nrevision rather than of a temporary nature.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the Secretary purchased under the act\r\nof July 14, 1890, 54,355,748 ounces of silver and issued in payment\r\ntherefor $51,106,608 in notes. The total purchases since the passage of\r\nthe act have been 120,479,981 ounces and the aggregate of notes issued\r\n$116,783,590. The average price paid for silver during the year was 94\r\ncents per ounce, the highest price being $1.02-3/4 July 1, 1891, and the\r\nlowest 83 cents March 21, 1892. In view of the fact that the monetary\r\nconference is now sitting and that no conclusion has yet been reached,\r\nI withhold any recommendation as to legislation upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War brings again to the attention of\r\nCongress some important suggestions as to the reorganization of the\r\ninfantry and artillery arms of the service, which his predecessors have\r\nbefore urgently presented. Our Army is small, but its organization\r\nshould all the more be put upon the most approved modern basis. The\r\nconditions upon what we have called the \"frontier\" have heretofore\r\nrequired the maintenance of many small posts, but now the policy of\r\nconcentration is obviously the right one. The new posts should have the\r\nproper strategic relations to the only \"frontiers\" we now have--those\r\nof the seacoast and of our northern and part of our southern boundary.\r\nI do not think that any question of advantage to localities or to States\r\nshould determine the location of the new posts. The reorganization and\r\nenlargement of the Bureau of Military Information which the Secretary\r\nhas effected is a work the usefulness of which will become every year\r\nmore apparent. The work of building heavy guns and the construction of\r\ncoast defenses has been well begun and should be carried on without\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General is by law submitted directly to\r\nCongress, but I can not refrain from saying that he has conducted the\r\nincreasing work of the Department of Justice with great professional\r\nskill. He has in several directions secured from the courts decisions\r\ngiving increased protection to the officers of the United States and\r\nbringing some classes of crime that escaped local cognizance and\r\npunishment into the tribunals of the United States, where they could\r\nbe tried with impartiality.\r\n\r\nThe numerous applications for Executive clemency presented in behalf\r\nof persons convicted in United States courts and given penitentiary\r\nsentences have called my attention to a fact referred to by the\r\nAttorney-General in his report, namely, that a time allowance for good\r\nbehavior for such prisoners is prescribed by the Federal statutes only\r\nwhere the State in which the penitentiary is located has made no such\r\nprovision. Prisoners are given the benefit of the provisions of the\r\nState law regulating the penitentiary to which they may be sent. These\r\nare various, some perhaps too liberal and some perhaps too illiberal.\r\nThe result is that a sentence for five years means one thing if the\r\nprisoner is sent to one State for confinement and quite a different\r\nthing if he is sent to another. I recommend that a uniform credit for\r\ngood behavior be prescribed by Congress.\r\n\r\nI have before expressed my concurrence in the recommendation of the\r\nAttorney-General that degrees of murder should be recognized in the\r\nFederal statutes, as they are, I believe, in all the States. These\r\ngrades are founded on correct distinctions in crime. The recognition of\r\nthem would enable the courts to exercise some discretion in apportioning\r\npunishment and would greatly relieve the Executive of what is coming to\r\nbe a very heavy burden--the examination of these cases on application\r\nfor commutation.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of claims pending against the Government in the Court of\r\nClaims is enormous. Claims to the amount of nearly $400,000,000 for the\r\ntaking of or injury to the property of persons claiming to be loyal\r\nduring the war are now before that court for examination. When to these\r\nare added the Indian depredation claims and the French spoliation\r\nclaims, an aggregate is reached that is indeed startling. In the defense\r\nof all these cases the Government is at great disadvantage. The\r\nclaimants have preserved their evidence, whereas the agents of the\r\nGovernment are sent into the field to rummage for what they can find.\r\nThis difficulty is peculiarly great where the fact to be established is\r\nthe disloyalty of the claimant during the war. If this great threat\r\nagainst our revenues is to have no other check, certainly Congress\r\nshould supply the Department of Justice with appropriations sufficiently\r\nliberal to secure the best legal talent in the defense of these claims\r\nand to pursue its vague search for evidence effectively.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows a most gratifying increase\r\nand a most efficient and progressive management of the great business\r\nof that Department. The remarkable increase in revenues, in the number\r\nof post-offices, and in the miles of mail carriage furnishes further\r\nevidence of the high state of prosperity which our people are enjoying.\r\nNew offices mean new hamlets and towns, new routes mean the extension of\r\nour border settlements, and increased revenues mean an active commerce.\r\nThe Postmaster-General reviews the whole period of his administration\r\nof the office and brings some of his statistics down to the month of\r\nNovember last. The postal revenues have increased during the last year\r\nnearly $5,000,000. The deficit for the year ending June 30, 1892, is\r\n$848,341 less than the deficiency of the preceding year. The deficiency\r\nof the present fiscal year it is estimated will be reduced to\r\n$1,552,423, which will not only be extinguished during the next fiscal\r\nyear, but a surplus of nearly $1,000,000 should then be shown. In these\r\ncalculations the payments to be made under the contracts for ocean mail\r\nservice have not been included. There have been added 1,590 new mail\r\nroutes during the year, with a mileage of 8,563 miles, and the total\r\nnumber of new miles of mail trips added during the year is nearly\r\n17,000,000. The number of miles of mail journeys added during the last\r\nfour years is about 76,000,000, this addition being 21,000,000 miles\r\nmore than were in operation in the whole country in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe number of post-offices has been increased by 2,790 during the year,\r\nand during the past four years, and up to October 29 last, the total\r\nincrease in the number of offices has been nearly 9,000. The number of\r\nfree-delivery offices has been nearly doubled in the last four years,\r\nand the number of money-order offices more than doubled within that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFor the three years ending June 30, 1892, the postal revenue amounted to\r\n$197,744,359, which was an increase of $52,263,150 over the revenue for\r\nthe three years ending June 30, 1888, the increase during the last three\r\nyears being more than three and a half times as great as the increase\r\nduring the three years ending June 30, 1888. No such increase as that\r\nshown for these three years has ever previously appeared in the revenues\r\nof the Department. The Postmaster-General has extended to the\r\npost-offices in the larger cities the merit system of promotion\r\nintroduced by my direction into the Departments here, and it has\r\nresulted there, as in the Departments, in a larger volume of work and\r\nthat better done.\r\n\r\nEver since our merchant marine was driven from the sea by the rebel\r\ncruisers during the War of the Rebellion the United States has been\r\npaying an enormous annual tribute to foreign countries in the shape of\r\nfreight and passage moneys. Our grain and meats have been taken at our\r\nown docks and our large imports there laid down by foreign shipmasters.\r\nAn increasing torrent of American travel to Europe has contributed a\r\nvast sum annually to the dividends of foreign shipowners. The balance\r\nof trade shown by the books of our custom-houses has been very largely\r\nreduced and in many years altogether extinguished by this constant\r\ndrain. In the year 1892 only 12.3 per cent of our imports were brought\r\nin American vessels. These great foreign steamships maintained by our\r\ntraffic are many of them under contracts with their respective\r\nGovernments by which in time of war they will become a part of their\r\narmed naval establishments. Profiting by our commerce in peace, they\r\nwill become the most formidable destroyers of our commerce in time of\r\nwar. I have felt, and have before expressed the feeling, that this\r\ncondition of things was both intolerable and disgraceful. A wholesome\r\nchange of policy, and one having in it much promise, as it seems to me,\r\nwas begun by the law of March 3, 1891. Under this law contracts have\r\nbeen made by the Postmaster-General for eleven mail routes. The\r\nexpenditure involved by these contracts for the next fiscal year\r\napproximates $954,123.33 As one of the results already reached sixteen\r\nAmerican steamships, of an aggregate tonnage of 57,400 tons, costing\r\n$7,400,000, have been built or contracted to be built in American\r\nshipyards.\r\n\r\nThe estimated tonnage of all steamships required under existing\r\ncontracts is 165,802, and when the full service required by these\r\ncontracts is established there will be forty-one mail steamers under\r\nthe American flag, with the probability of further necessary additions\r\nin the Brazilian and Argentine service. The contracts recently let for\r\ntransatlantic service will result in the construction of five ships of\r\n10,000 tons each, costing $9,000,000 to $10,000,000, and will add, with\r\nthe _City of New York_ and _City of Paris_, to which the Treasury\r\nDepartment was authorized by legislation at the last session to give\r\nAmerican registry, seven of the swiftest vessels upon the sea to our\r\nnaval reserve. The contracts made with the lines sailing to Central and\r\nSouth American ports have increased the frequency and shortened the time\r\nof the trips, added new ports of call, and sustained some lines that\r\notherwise would almost certainly have been withdrawn. The service to\r\nBuenos Ayres is the first to the Argentine Republic under the American\r\nflag. The service to Southampton, Boulogne, and Antwerp is also new,\r\nand is to be begun with the steamships _City of New York_ and _City\r\nof Paris_ in February next.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge the continuance of the policy inaugurated by\r\nthis legislation, and that the appropriations required to meet the\r\nobligations of the Government under the contracts may be made promptly,\r\nso that the lines that have entered into these engagements may not\r\nbe embarrassed. We have had, by reason of connections with the\r\ntranscontinental railway lines constructed through our own territory,\r\nsome advantages in the ocean trade of the Pacific that we did not\r\npossess on the Atlantic. The construction of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway and the establishment under large subventions from Canada and\r\nEngland of fast steamship service from Vancouver with Japan and China\r\nseriously threaten our shipping interests in the Pacific. This line\r\nof English steamers receives, as is stated by the Commissioner of\r\nNavigation, a direct subsidy of $400,000 annually, or $30,767 per trip\r\nfor thirteen voyages, in addition to some further aid from the Admiralty\r\nin connection with contracts under which the vessels may be used for\r\nnaval purposes. The competing American Pacific mail line under the\r\nact of March 3, 1891, receives only $6,389 per round trip.\r\n\r\nEfforts have been making within the last year, as I am informed,\r\nto establish under similar conditions a line between Vancouver and some\r\nAustralian port, with a view of seizing there a trade in which we have\r\nhad a large interest. The Commissioner of Navigation states that a\r\nvery large per cent of our imports from Asia are now brought to us by\r\nEnglish steamships and their connecting railways in Canada. With a\r\nview of promoting this trade, especially in tea, Canada has imposed a\r\ndiscriminating duty of 10 per cent upon tea and coffee brought into\r\nthe Dominion from the United States. If this unequal contest between\r\nAmerican lines without subsidy, or with diminished subsidies, and the\r\nEnglish Canadian line to which I have referred is to continue, I think\r\nwe should at least see that the facilities for customs entry and\r\ntransportation across our territory are not such as to make the Canadian\r\nroute a favored one, and that the discrimination as to duties to which\r\nI have referred is met by a like discrimination as to the importation\r\nof these articles from Canada.\r\n\r\nNo subject, I think, more nearly touches the pride, the power, and the\r\nprosperity of our country than this of the development of our merchant\r\nmarine upon the sea. If we could enter into conference with other\r\ncompetitors and all would agree to withhold government aid, we could\r\nperhaps take our chances with the rest; but our great competitors have\r\nestablished and maintained their lines by government subsidies until\r\nthey now have practically excluded us from participation. In my opinion\r\nno choice is left to us but to pursue, moderately at least, the same\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits great progress in the\r\nconstruction of our new Navy. When the present Secretary entered upon\r\nhis duties, only 3 modern steel vessels were in commission. The vessels\r\nsince put in commission and to be put in commission during the winter\r\nwill make a total of 19 during his administration of the Department.\r\nDuring the current year 10 war vessels and 3 navy tugs have been\r\nlaunched, and during the four years 25 vessels will have been launched.\r\nTwo other large ships and a torpedo boat are under contract and the work\r\nupon them well advanced, and the 4 monitors are awaiting only the\r\narrival of their armor, which has been unexpectedly delayed, or they\r\nwould have been before this in commission.\r\n\r\nContracts have been let during this Administration, under the\r\nappropriations for the increase of the Navy, including new vessels and\r\ntheir appurtenances, to the amount of $35,000,000, and there has been\r\nexpended during the same period for labor at navy-yards upon similar\r\nwork $8,000,000 without the smallest scandal or charge of fraud or\r\npartiality. The enthusiasm and interest of our naval officers, both\r\nof the staff and line, have been greatly kindled. They have responded\r\nmagnificently to the confidence of Congress and have demonstrated to\r\nthe world an unexcelled capacity in construction, in ordnance, and in\r\neverything involved in the building, equipping, and sailing of great\r\nwar ships.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Secretary Tracy's administration several difficult\r\nproblems remained to be grappled with and solved before the efficiency\r\nin action of our ships could be secured. It is believed that as the\r\nresult of new processes in the construction of armor plate our later\r\nships will be clothed with defensive plates of higher resisting power\r\nthan are found on any war vessels afloat. We were without torpedoes.\r\nTests have been made to ascertain the relative efficiency of different\r\nconstructions, a torpedo has been adopted, and the work of construction\r\nis now being carried on successfully. We were without armor-piercing\r\nshells and without a shop instructed and equipped for the construction\r\nof them. We are now making what is believed to be a projectile superior\r\nto any before in use. A smokeless powder has been developed and a\r\nslow-burning powder for guns of large caliber. A high explosive capable\r\nof use in shells fired from service guns has been found, and the\r\nmanufacture of gun cotton has been developed so that the question of\r\nsupply is no longer in doubt.\r\n\r\nThe development of a naval militia, which has been organized in eight\r\nStates and brought into cordial and cooperative relations with the Navy,\r\nis another important achievement. There are now enlisted in these\r\norganizations 1,800 men, and they are likely to be greatly extended.\r\nI recommend such legislation and appropriations as will encourage and\r\ndevelop this movement. The recommendations of the Secretary will, I do\r\nnot doubt, receive the friendly consideration of Congress, for he has\r\nenjoyed, as he has deserved, the confidence of all those interested in\r\nthe development of our Navy, without any division upon partisan lines.\r\nI earnestly express the hope that a work which has made such noble\r\nprogress may not now be stayed. The wholesome influence for peace and\r\nthe increased sense of security which our citizens domiciled in other\r\nlands feel when these magnificent ships under the American flag appear\r\nis already most gratefully apparent. The ships from our Navy which will\r\nappear in the great naval parade next April in the harbor of New York\r\nwill be a convincing demonstration to the world that the United States\r\nis again a naval power.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Interior Department, always very burdensome, has been\r\nlarger than ever before during the administration of Secretary Noble.\r\nThe disability-pension law, the taking of the Eleventh Census, the\r\nopening of vast areas of Indian lands to settlement, the organization of\r\nOklahoma, and the negotiations for the cession of Indian lands furnish\r\nsome of the particulars of the increased work, and the results achieved\r\ntestify to the ability, fidelity, and industry of the head of the\r\nDepartment and his efficient assistants.\r\n\r\nSeveral important agreements for the cession of Indian lands negotiated\r\nby the commission appointed under the act of March 2, 1889, are awaiting\r\nthe action of Congress. Perhaps the most important of these is that for\r\nthe cession of the Cherokee Strip. This region has been the source of\r\ngreat vexation to the executive department and of great friction and\r\nunrest between the settlers who desire to occupy it and the Indians who\r\nassert title. The agreement which has been made by the commission is\r\nperhaps the most satisfactory that could have been reached. It will be\r\nnoticed that it is conditioned upon its ratification by Congress before\r\nMarch 4, 1893. The Secretary of the Interior, who has given the subject\r\nvery careful thought, recommends the ratification of the agreement, and\r\nI am inclined to follow his recommendation. Certain it is that some\r\naction by which this controversy shall be brought to an end and these\r\nlands opened to settlement is urgent.\r\n\r\nThe form of government provided by Congress on May 17, 1884, for Alaska\r\nwas in its frame and purpose temporary. The increase of population and\r\nthe development of some important mining and commercial interests make\r\nit imperative that the law should be revised and better provision made\r\nfor the arrest and punishment of criminals.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary shows a very gratifying state of facts\r\nas to the condition of the General Land Office. The work of issuing\r\nagricultural patents, which seemed to be hopelessly in arrear when\r\nthe present Secretary undertook the duties of his office, has been so\r\nexpedited that the bureau is now upon current business. The relief thus\r\nafforded to honest and worthy settlers upon the public lands by giving\r\nto them an assured title to their entries has been of incalculable\r\nbenefit in developing the new States and the Territories.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Private Land Claims, established by Congress for the\r\npromotion of this policy of speedily settling contested land titles,\r\nis making satisfactory progress in its work, and when the work is\r\ncompleted a great impetus will be given to the development of those\r\nregions where unsettled claims under Mexican grants have so long\r\nexercised their repressive influence. When to these results are added\r\nthe enormous cessions of Indian lands which have been opened to\r\nsettlement, aggregating during this Administration nearly 26,000,000\r\nacres, and the agreements negotiated and now pending in Congress for\r\nratification by which about 10,000,000 additional acres will be opened\r\nto settlement, it will be seen how much has been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe work in the Indian Bureau in the execution of the policy of recent\r\nlegislation has been largely directed to two chief purposes: First,\r\nthe allotment of lands in severalty to the Indians and the cession to\r\nthe United States of the surplus lands, and, secondly, to the work of\r\neducating the Indian for his own protection in his closer contact with\r\nthe white man and for the intelligent exercise of his new citizenship.\r\nAllotments have been made and patents issued to 5,900 Indians under the\r\npresent Secretary and Commissioner, and 7,600 additional allotments\r\nhave been made for which patents are now in process of preparation. The\r\nschool attendance of Indian children has been increased during that time\r\nover 13 per cent, the enrollment for 1892 being nearly 20,000. A uniform\r\nsystem of school text-books and of study has been adopted and the work\r\nin these national schools brought as near as may be to the basis of the\r\nfree common schools of the States. These schools can be transferred and\r\nmerged into the common-school systems of the States when the Indian has\r\nfully assumed his new relation to the organized civil community in which\r\nhe resides and the new States are able to assume the burden. I have\r\nseveral times been called upon to remove Indian agents appointed by me,\r\nand have done so promptly upon every sustained complaint of unfitness or\r\nmisconduct. I believe, however, that the Indian service at the agencies\r\nhas been improved and is now administered on the whole with a good\r\ndegree of efficiency. If any legislation is possible by which the\r\nselection of Indian agents can be wholly removed from all partisan\r\nsuggestions or considerations, I am sure it would be a great relief to\r\nthe Executive and a great benefit to the service. The appropriation for\r\nthe subsistence of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians made at the last\r\nsession of Congress was inadequate. This smaller appropriation was\r\nestimated for by the Commissioner upon the theory that the large fund\r\nbelonging to the tribe in the public Treasury could be and ought to be\r\nused for their support. In view, however, of the pending depredation\r\nclaims against this fund and other considerations, the Secretary of the\r\nInterior on the 12th of April last submitted a supplemental estimate for\r\n$50,000. This appropriation was not made, as it should have been, and\r\nthe oversight ought to be remedied at the earliest possible date.\r\n\r\nIn a special message to this Congress at the last session[35] I stated\r\nthe reasons why I had not approved the deed for the release to the\r\nUnited States by the Choctaws and Chickasaws of the lands formerly\r\nembraced in the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation and remaining after\r\nallotments to that tribe. A resolution of the Senate expressing the\r\nopinion of that body that notwithstanding the facts stated in my special\r\nmessage the deed should be approved and the money, $2,991,450, paid over\r\nwas presented to me May 10, 1892. My special message was intended to\r\ncall the attention of Congress to the subject, and in view of the fact\r\nthat it is conceded that the appropriation proceeded upon a false basis\r\nas to the amount of lands to be paid for and is by $50,000 in excess\r\nof the amount they are entitled to (even if their claim to the land is\r\ngiven full recognition at the rate agreed upon), I have not felt willing\r\nto approve the deed, and shall not do so, at least until both Houses of\r\nCongress have acted upon the subject. It has been informally proposed by\r\nthe claimants to release this sum of $50,000, but I have no power to\r\ndemand or accept such a release, and such an agreement would be without\r\nconsideration and void.\r\n\r\nI desire further to call the attention of Congress to the fact that the\r\nrecent agreement concluded with the Kiowas and Comanches relates to\r\nlands which were a part of the \"leased district,\" and to which the claim\r\nof the Choctaws and Chickasaws is precisely that recognized by Congress\r\nin the legislation I have referred to. The surplus lands to which this\r\nclaim would attach in the Kiowa and Comanche Reservation is 2,500,000\r\nacres, and at the same rate the Government will be called upon to pay to\r\nthe Choctaws and Chickasaws for these lands $3,125,000. This sum will be\r\nfurther augmented, especially if the title of the Indians to the tract\r\nnow Greer County, Tex., is established. The duty devolved upon me in\r\nthis connection was simply to pass upon the form of the deed; but as in\r\nmy opinion the facts mentioned in my special message were not adequately\r\nbrought to the attention of Congress in connection with the legislation,\r\nI have felt that I would not be justified in acting without some new\r\nexpression of the legislative will.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Pensions, to which extended notice is\r\ngiven by the Secretary of the Interior in his report, will attract great\r\nattention. Judged by the aggregate amount of work done, the last year\r\nhas been the greatest in the history of the office. I believe that the\r\norganization of the office is efficient and that the work has been done\r\nwith fidelity. The passage of what is known as the disability bill has,\r\nas was foreseen, very largely increased the annual disbursements to the\r\ndisabled veterans of the Civil War. The estimate for this fiscal year\r\nwas $144,956,000, and that amount was appropriated. A deficiency\r\namounting to $10,508,621 must be provided for at this session.\r\nThe estimate for pensions for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, is\r\n$165,000,000. The Commissioner of Pensions believes that if the present\r\nlegislation and methods are maintained and further additions to the\r\npension laws are not made the maximum expenditure for pensions will be\r\nreached June 30, 1894, and will be at the highest point $188,000,000\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\nI adhere to the views expressed in previous messages that the care\r\nof the disabled soldiers of the War of the Rebellion is a matter of\r\nnational concern and duty. Perhaps no emotion cools sooner than that\r\nof gratitude, but I can not believe that this process has yet reached\r\na point with our people that would sustain the policy of remitting the\r\ncare of these disabled veterans to the inadequate agencies provided by\r\nlocal laws. The parade on the 20th of September last upon the streets of\r\nthis capital of 60,000 of the surviving Union veterans of the War of the\r\nRebellion was a most touching and thrilling episode, and the rich and\r\ngracious welcome extended to them by the District of Columbia and the\r\napplause that greeted their progress from tens of thousands of people\r\nfrom all the States did much to revive the glorious recollections of the\r\nGrand Review when these men and many thousand others now in their graves\r\nwere welcomed with grateful joy as victors in a struggle in which the\r\nnational unity, honor, and wealth were all at issue.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I called attention to the fact that some\r\nlegislative action was necessary in order to protect the interests of\r\nthe Government in its relations with the Union Pacific Railway. The\r\nCommissioner of Railroads has submitted a very full report, giving exact\r\ninformation as to the debt, the liens upon the company's property, and\r\nits resources. We must deal with the question as we find it and take\r\nthat course which will under existing conditions best secure the\r\ninterests of the United States. I recommended in my last annual message\r\nthat a commission be appointed to deal with this question, and I renew\r\nthat recommendation and suggest that the commission be given full power.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of Agriculture contains not only a most\r\ninteresting statement of the progressive and valuable work done under\r\nthe administration of Secretary Rusk, but many suggestions for the\r\nenlarged usefulness of this important Department. In the successful\r\nefforts to break down the restrictions to the free introduction of our\r\nmeat products in the countries of Europe the Secretary has been untiring\r\nfrom the first, stimulating and aiding all other Government officers at\r\nhome and abroad whose official duties enabled them to participate in the\r\nwork. The total trade in hog products with Europe in May, 1892, amounted\r\nto 82,000,000 pounds, against 46,900,000 in the same month of 1891; in\r\nJune, 1892, the export aggregated 85,700,000 pounds, against 46,500,000\r\npounds in the same month of the previous year; in July there was\r\nan increase of 41 per cent and in August of 55 per cent over the\r\ncorresponding months of 1891. Over 40,000,000 pounds of inspected\r\npork have been exported since the law was put into operation, and a\r\ncomparison of the four months of May, June, July, and August, 1892, with\r\nthe same months of 1891 shows an increase in the number of pounds of\r\nour export of pork products of 62 per cent and an increase in value of\r\n66-1/2 per cent. The exports of dressed beef increased from 137,900,000\r\npounds in 1889 to 220,500,000 pounds in 1892, or about 60 per cent.\r\nDuring the past year there have been exported 394,607 head of live\r\ncattle, as against 205,786 exported in 1889. This increased exportation\r\nhas been largely promoted by the inspection authorized by law and the\r\nfaithful efforts of the Secretary and his efficient subordinates to\r\nmake that inspection thorough and to carefully exclude from all cargoes\r\ndiseased or suspected cattle. The requirement of the English regulations\r\nthat live cattle arriving from the United States must be slaughtered\r\nat the docks had its origin in the claim that pleuro-pneumonia existed\r\namong American cattle and that the existence of the disease could only\r\ncertainly be determined by _post mortem_ inspection.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has labored with great energy and\r\nfaithfulness to extirpate this disease, and on the 26th day of September\r\nlast a public announcement was made by the Secretary that the disease\r\nno longer existed anywhere within the United States. He is entirely\r\nsatisfied after the most searching inquiry that this statement was\r\njustified, and that by a continuance of the inspection and quarantine\r\nnow required of cattle brought into this country the disease can be\r\nprevented from again getting any foothold. The value to the cattle\r\nindustry of the United States of this achievement can hardly be\r\nestimated. We can not, perhaps, at once insist that this evidence shall\r\nbe accepted as satisfactory by other countries; but if the present\r\nexemption from the disease is maintained and the inspection of our\r\ncattle arriving at foreign ports, in which our own veterinarians\r\nparticipate, confirms it, we may justly expect that the requirement that\r\nour cattle shall be slaughtered at the docks will be revoked, as the\r\nsanitary restrictions upon our pork products have been. If our cattle\r\ncan be taken alive to the interior, the trade will be enormously\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAgricultural products constituted 78.1 per cent of our unprecedented\r\nexports for the fiscal year which closed June 30, 1892, the total\r\nexports being $1,030,278,030 and the value of the agricultural products\r\n$793,717,676, which exceeds by more than $150,000,000 the shipment of\r\nagricultural products in any previous year.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and a promising work for the benefit of the American\r\nfarmer has been begun through agents of the Agricultural Department in\r\nEurope, and consists in efforts to introduce the various products of\r\nIndian corn as articles of human food. The high price of rye offered a\r\nfavorable opportunity for the experiment in Germany of combining corn\r\nmeal with rye to produce a cheaper bread. A fair degree of success has\r\nbeen attained, and some mills for grinding corn for food have been\r\nintroduced. The Secretary is of the opinion that this new use of the\r\nproducts of corn has already stimulated exportations, and that if\r\ndiligently prosecuted large and important markets can presently be\r\nopened for this great American product.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the Secretary for an enlargement of the work of\r\nthe Department are commended to your favorable consideration, It may,\r\nI think, be said without challenge that in no corresponding period has\r\nso much been done as during the last four years for the benefit of\r\nAmerican agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe subject of quarantine regulations, inspection, and control was\r\nbrought suddenly to my attention by the arrival at our ports in August\r\nlast of vessels infected with cholera. Quarantine regulations should be\r\nuniform at all our ports. Under the Constitution they are plainly within\r\nthe exclusive Federal jurisdiction when and so far as Congress shall\r\nlegislate. In my opinion the whole subject should be taken into national\r\ncontrol and adequate power given to the Executive to protect our people\r\nagainst plague invasions. On the 1st of September last I approved\r\nregulations establishing a twenty-day quarantine for all vessels\r\nbringing immigrants from foreign ports. This order will be continued\r\nin force. Some loss and suffering have resulted to passengers, but a\r\ndue care for the homes of our people justifies in such cases the utmost\r\nprecaution. There is danger that with the coming of spring cholera will\r\nagain appear, and a liberal appropriation should be made at this session\r\nto enable our quarantine and port officers to exclude the deadly plague.\r\n\r\nBut the most careful and stringent quarantine regulations may not be\r\nsufficient absolutely to exclude the disease. The progress of medical\r\nand sanitary science has been such, however, that if approved\r\nprecautions are taken at once to put all of our cities and towns in\r\nthe best sanitary condition, and provision is made for isolating any\r\nsporadic cases and for a thorough disinfection, an epidemic can, I am\r\nsure, be avoided. This work appertains to the local authorities, and the\r\nresponsibility and the penalty will be appalling if it is neglected or\r\nunduly delayed.\r\n\r\nWe are peculiarly subject in our great ports to the spread of\r\ninfectious diseases by reason of the fact that unrestricted immigration\r\nbrings to us out of European cities, in the overcrowded steerages of\r\ngreat steamships, a large number of persons whose surroundings make them\r\nthe easy victims of the plague. This consideration, as well as those\r\naffecting the political, moral, and industrial interests of our country,\r\nleads me to renew the suggestion that admission to our country and to\r\nthe high privileges of its citizenship should be more restricted and\r\nmore careful. We have, I think, a right and owe a duty to our own\r\npeople, and especially to our working people, not only to keep out the\r\nvicious, the ignorant, the civil disturber, the pauper, and the contract\r\nlaborer, but to check the too great flow of immigration now coming by\r\nfurther limitations.\r\n\r\nThe report of the World's Columbian Exposition has not yet been\r\nsubmitted. That of the board of management of the Government exhibit\r\nhas been received and is herewith transmitted. The work of construction\r\nand of preparation for the opening of the exposition in May next has\r\nprogressed most satisfactorily and upon a scale of liberality and\r\nmagnificence that will worthily sustain the honor of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia is left by a decision of the supreme court\r\nof the District without any law regulating the liquor traffic. An old\r\nstatute of the legislature of the District relating to the licensing\r\nof various vocations has hitherto been treated by the Commissioners\r\nas giving them power to grant or refuse licenses to sell intoxicating\r\nliquors and as subjecting those who sold without licenses to penalties;\r\nbut in May last the supreme court of the District held against this\r\nview of the powers of the Commissioners. It is of urgent importance,\r\ntherefore, that Congress should supply, either by direct enactment\r\nor by conferring discretionary powers upon the Commissioners, proper\r\nlimitations and restraints upon the liquor traffic in the District.\r\nThe District has suffered in its reputation by many crimes of violence,\r\na large per cent of them resulting from drunkenness and the liquor\r\ntraffic. The capital of the nation should be freed from this reproach\r\nby the enactment of stringent restrictions and limitations upon the\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nIn renewing the recommendation which I have made in three preceding\r\nannual messages that Congress should legislate for the protection\r\nof railroad employees against the dangers incident to the old and\r\ninadequate methods of braking and coupling which are still in use upon\r\nfreight trains, I do so with the hope that this Congress may take action\r\nupon the subject. Statistics furnished by the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission show that during the year ending June 30, 1891, there were\r\nforty-seven different styles of car couplers reported to be in use, and\r\nthat during the same period there were 2,660 employees killed and 26,140\r\ninjured. Nearly 16 per cent of the deaths occurred in the coupling and\r\nuncoupling of cars and over 36 per cent of the injuries had the same\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Service Commission ask for an increased appropriation for\r\nneeded clerical assistance, which I think should be given. I extended\r\nthe classified service March 1, 1892, to include physicians,\r\nsuperintendents, assistant superintendents, school-teachers, and matrons\r\nin the Indian service, and have had under consideration the subject of\r\nsome further extensions, but have not as yet fully determined the lines\r\nupon which extensions can most properly and usefully be made.\r\n\r\nI have in each of the three annual messages which it has been my duty\r\nto submit to Congress called attention to the evils and dangers\r\nconnected with our election methods and practices as they are related\r\nto the choice of officers of the National Government. In my last annual\r\nmessage I endeavored to invoke serious attention to the evils of unfair\r\napportionments for Congress. I can not close this message without again\r\ncalling attention to these grave and threatening evils. I had hoped that\r\nit was possible to secure a nonpartisan inquiry by means of a commission\r\ninto evils the existence of which is known to all, and that out of this\r\nmight grow legislation from which all thought of partisan advantage\r\nshould be eliminated and only the higher thought appear of maintaining\r\nthe freedom and purity of the ballot and the equality of the elector,\r\nwithout the guaranty of which the Government could never have been\r\nformed and without the continuance of which it can not continue to\r\nexist in peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is time that mutual charges of unfairness and fraud between the\r\ngreat parties should cease and that the sincerity of those who profess\r\na desire for pure and honest elections should be brought to the test of\r\ntheir willingness to free our legislation and our election methods from\r\neverything that tends to impair the public confidence in the announced\r\nresult. The necessity for an inquiry and for legislation by Congress\r\nupon this subject is emphasized by the fact that the tendency of the\r\nlegislation in some States in recent years has in some important\r\nparticulars been away from and not toward free and fair elections and\r\nequal apportionments. Is it not time that we should come together upon\r\nthe high plane of patriotism while we devise methods that shall secure\r\nthe right of every man qualified by law to cast a free ballot and give\r\nto every such ballot an equal value in choosing our public officers and\r\nin directing the policy of the Government?\r\n\r\nLawlessness is not less such, but more, where it usurps the functions of\r\nthe peace officer and of the courts. The frequent lynching of colored\r\npeople accused of crime is without the excuse, which has sometimes been\r\nurged by mobs for a failure to pursue the appointed methods for the\r\npunishment of crime, that the accused have an undue influence over\r\ncourts and juries. Such acts are a reproach to the community where\r\nthey occur, and so far as they can be made the subject of Federal\r\njurisdiction the strongest repressive legislation is demanded. A public\r\nsentiment that will sustain the officers of the law in resisting mobs\r\nand in protecting accused persons in their custody should be promoted\r\nby every possible means. The officer who gives his life in the brave\r\ndischarge of this duty is worthy of special honor. No lesson needs to\r\nbe so urgently impressed upon our people as this, that no worthy end\r\nor cause can be promoted by lawlessness.\r\n\r\nThis exhibit of the work of the Executive Departments is submitted to\r\nCongress and to the public in the hope that there will be found in it\r\na due sense of responsibility and an earnest purpose to maintain the\r\nnational honor and to promote the happiness and prosperity of all our\r\npeople, and this brief exhibit of the growth and prosperity of the\r\ncountry will give us a level from which to note the increase or\r\ndecadence that new legislative policies may bring to us. There is no\r\nreason why the national influence, power, and prosperity should not\r\nobserve the same rates of increase that have characterized the past\r\nthirty years. We carry the great impulse and increase of these years\r\ninto the future. There is no reason why in many lines of production we\r\nshould not surpass all other nations, as we have already done in some.\r\nThere are no near frontiers to our possible development. Retrogression\r\nwould be a crime.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 2, 1893_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of July last the following resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives was communicated to me:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be requested to inform the House, if not\r\n  incompatible with the public interests, what regulations are now in\r\n  force concerning the transportation of imported merchandise in bond or\r\n  duty paid, and products or manufactures of the United States, from one\r\n  port in the United States, over Canadian territory, to another port\r\n  therein, under the provisions of section 3006 of the Revised Statutes;\r\n  whether further legislation thereon is necessary or advisable, and\r\n  especially whether a careful inspection of such merchandise should not\r\n  be had at the frontiers of the United States upon the departure and\r\n  arrival of such merchandise, and whether the interests of the United\r\n  States do not require that each car containing such merchandise while\r\n  in Canadian territory be in the custody and under the surveillance of\r\n  an inspector of the customs department, the cost of such surveillance\r\n  to be paid by the foreign carrier transporting such merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolution is limited in its scope to the subject of the transit\r\nof merchandise from one port in the United States, through Canadian\r\nterritory, to another port in the United States, under the provisions of\r\nsection 3006 of the Revised Statutes; but I have concluded that a review\r\nof our treaty obligations, if any, and of our legislation upon the whole\r\nsubject of the transit of goods from, to, or through Canada is\r\ndesirable, and therefore address this message to the Congress.\r\n\r\nIt should be known before new legislation is proposed whether the United\r\nStates is under any treaty obligations which affect this subject growing\r\nout of the provisions of Article XXIX of the treaty of Washington. That\r\narticle is as follows:\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that for the term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII of\r\n  this treaty goods, wares, or merchandise arriving at the ports of New\r\n  York, Boston, and Portland, and any other ports in the United States\r\n  which have been or may from time to time be specially designated by\r\n  the President of the United States, and destined for Her Britannic\r\n  Majesty's possessions in North America, may be entered at the proper\r\n  custom-house and conveyed in transit, without the payment of duties,\r\n  through the territory of the United States, under such rules,\r\n  regulations, and conditions for the protection of the revenue as the\r\n  Government of the United States may from time to time prescribe; and\r\n  under like rules, regulations, and conditions goods, wares, or\r\n  merchandise may be conveyed in transit, without the payment of duties,\r\n  from such possessions through the territory of the United States for\r\n  export from the said ports of the United States.\r\n\r\n  It is further agreed that for the like period goods, wares, or\r\n  merchandise arriving at any of the ports of Her Britannic Majesty's\r\n  possessions in North America and destined for the United States may be\r\n  entered at the proper custom-house and conveyed in transit, without the\r\n  payment of duties, through the said possessions, under such rules and\r\n  regulations and conditions for the protection of the revenue as the\r\n  governments of the said possessions may from time to time prescribe;\r\n  and under like rules, regulations, and conditions goods, wares, or\r\n  merchandise may be conveyed in transit, without payment of duties, from\r\n  the United States through the said possessions to other places in the\r\n  United States, or for export from ports in the said possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that provision is here made--\r\n\r\n  First. For the transit in bond, without the payment of duties, of goods\r\n  arriving at specified ports of the United States, and at others to be\r\n  designated by the President, destined for Canada.\r\n\r\n  Second. For the transit from Canada to ports of the United States,\r\n  without the payment of duties, of merchandise for export.\r\n\r\n  Third. For the transit of merchandise arriving at Canadian ports,\r\n  destined for the United States, through Canadian territory to\r\n  the United States, without the payment of duties to the Dominion\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  Fourth. For the transit of merchandise from the United States to\r\n  Canadian ports for export without the payment of duties.\r\n\r\n  Fifth. For the transit of merchandise, without the payment of duties,\r\n  from the United States, through Canada, to other places in the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first and second of these provisions were concessions by the\r\nUnited States and were made subject to \"such rules, regulations, and\r\nconditions for the protection of the revenue as the Government of the\r\nUnited States may from time to time prescribe.\" The third, fourth, and\r\nfifth provisions of the articles are concessions on the part of the\r\nDominion of Canada and are made subject to \"such rules and regulations\r\nand conditions for the protection of the revenue as the governments of\r\nthe said possessions may from time to time prescribe.\" The first and\r\nsecond and the third and fourth of these provisions are reciprocal in\r\ntheir nature. The fifth, which provides for the transit of merchandise\r\nfrom one point in the United States, through Canada, to another point in\r\nthe United States, is not met by a reciprocal provision for the passage\r\nof Canadian goods from one point in Canada to another point in Canada\r\nthrough the United States. If this article of the treaty is in force,\r\nthe obligations assumed by the United States should be fully and\r\nhonorably observed until such time as this Government shall free\r\nitself from them by methods provided in the treaty or recognized by\r\ninternational law. It is, however, no part of the obligation resting\r\nupon the United States under the treaty that it will use the concessions\r\nmade to it by Canada. This Government would undoubtedly meet its full\r\nduty by yielding in an ample manner the concessions made by it to\r\nCanada. There could be no just cause of complaint by Great Britain or\r\nCanada if the compensating concession to the United States should not\r\nbe exercised. We have not stipulated in the treaty that we will permit\r\nmerchandise to be moved through Canadian territory from one point of the\r\nUnited States to another at the will of the shipper. The stipulation is\r\non the part of Canada that it will permit such merchandise to enter its\r\nterritory from the United States, to pass through it, and to return to\r\nthe United States without the exaction of duties and without other\r\nburdens than such as may be necessary to protect its revenues.\r\n\r\nThe questions whether we shall continue to allow merchandise to pass\r\nfrom one point in the United States, through Canadian territory, to\r\nanother point in the United States, and, if so, to what exactions and\r\nexaminations it shall be subjected on reentering our territory, are\r\nwholly within the power of Congress without reference to the question\r\nwhether Article XXIX is or is not in force.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Washington embraced a number of absolutely independent\r\nsubjects. Its purpose, as recited, was \"to provide for an amicable\r\nsettlement of all causes of difference between the two countries.\"\r\nIt provided for four distinct arbitrations of unsettled questions,\r\nincluding the Alabama claims, for a temporary settlement of the\r\nquestions growing out of the fisheries, and for various arrangements\r\naffecting commerce and intercourse between the United States and the\r\nBritish North American possessions. Some of its provisions were made\r\nterminable by methods pointed out in the treaty. Articles I to XVII,\r\ninclusive, provide for the settlement of the Alabama claims and of the\r\nclaims of British subjects against the United States, and have been\r\nfully executed. Articles XVIII to XXV, inclusive, relate to the subject\r\nof the fisheries, and provide for a joint commission to determine what\r\nindemnity should be paid to Great Britain for the fishing privileges\r\nconceded. These articles have been terminated by the notice provided\r\nfor in the treaty.\r\n\r\nArticle XXVI provides for the free navigation of the St. Lawrence,\r\nYukon, Porcupine, and Stikine rivers. Article XXVII provides for the\r\nequal use of certain frontier canals and waterways, and contains no\r\nprovision for termination upon notice. Article XXVIII opens Lake\r\nMichigan to the commerce of British subjects under proper regulations,\r\nand contains a provision for its abrogation, to which reference will\r\npresently be made. Article XXX provides for certain privileges of\r\ntransshipment on the Lakes and northern waterways, and contains the\r\nsame provision as Article XXIX as to the method by which it may be\r\nterminated. Article XXXI provides for the nonimposition of a Canadian\r\nexport duty on lumber cut in certain districts in Maine and floated\r\nto the sea by the St. Johns River, and contains no limitation as to\r\ntime and no provision for its abrogation. Article XXXII extended to\r\nNewfoundland in the event of proper legislation by that Province the\r\nfishery provisions of Articles XVIII to XXV, and was of course abrogated\r\nwith those articles. Article XXXIII, which provides a method for the\r\nabrogation of certain articles of the treaty, I will presently quote\r\nat length. The remaining articles of the treaty, namely XXXV to XLII,\r\nprovide for the arbitration of the dispute as to the Vancouver Island\r\nand De Haro Channel boundary, and have been fully executed. Articles\r\nXVIII, XIX, XXI, XXVIII, XXIX, and XXX each contains a provision\r\nlimiting their life to \"the term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII of\r\nthis treaty.\" The articles between XVIII and XXX, inclusive, which do\r\nnot contain this provision, are those that provide for an arbitration of\r\nthe fishery question, which were of course terminable by the completion\r\nof the arbitration; Article XXVI, relating to the navigation of the St.\r\nLawrence and other rivers, and Article XXVII, relating to the use of the\r\ncanals. The question whether Article XXIX is still in force depends,\r\nso far as the construction of the treaty goes, upon the meaning of the\r\nwords \"the term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII.\" That article is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  The foregoing Articles XVIII to XXV, inclusive, and Article XXX of this\r\n  treaty shall take effect as soon as the laws required to carry them\r\n  into operation shall have been passed by the Imperial Parliament of\r\n  Great Britain, by the parliament of Canada, and by the legislature of\r\n  Prince Edwards Island on the one hand and by the Congress of the United\r\n  States on the other. Such assent having been given, the said articles\r\n  shall remain in force for the period of ten years from the date at\r\n  which they may come into operation, and, further, until the expiration\r\n  of two years after either of the high contracting parties shall have\r\n  given notice to the other of its wish to terminate the same; each of\r\n  the high contracting parties being at liberty to give such notice to\r\n  the other at the end of the said period of ten years or at any time\r\n  afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of construction here presented is whether the reference to\r\n\"the term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII\" is to be construed as\r\nlimiting the continuance of Article XXIX to the duration of Articles\r\nXVIII to XXV and XXX in such a way that the abrogation of those articles\r\nnecessarily carried with it the other articles of the treaty which\r\ncontained the reference to Article XXXIII already quoted, or whether\r\nthe reference to this \"term of years\" in Articles XXVIII and XXIX was\r\nintended to provide a method of abrogation after ten years from the time\r\nof their taking effect, viz, a notice of two years of an intention to\r\nabrogate. The language of the treaty, considered alone, might support\r\nthe conclusion that Article XXXIII was intended to provide a uniform\r\nmethod of abrogation for certain other articles. It will be noticed that\r\nthe treaty does not expressly call for legislation to put Article XXIX\r\ninto operation. Senator Edmunds, in the discussion in the Senate of\r\nthe joint resolution terminating the fisheries article, took the view\r\nthat no legislation was necessary. It seems to me, however, that such\r\nlegislation was necessary, and Congress acted upon this view in the law\r\nof 1873, to which reference will presently be made. An examination of\r\nthe discussion between the plenipotentiaries who framed the treaty\r\nfurnishes this entry, which President Cleveland thought to be conclusive\r\nof the intention of the plenipotentiaries, viz:\r\n\r\n  The transit question was discussed, and it was agreed that any\r\n  settlement that might be made should include a reciprocal arrangement\r\n  in that respect for the period for which the fishery articles should\r\n  be in force.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1873, Congress passed an act entitled \"An act to carry into\r\neffect the provisions of the treaty between the United States and Great\r\nBritain signed in the city of Washington the 8th day of May, 1871,\r\nrelating to the fisheries.\" The act consisted of five sections, the\r\nfirst and second of which provided for carrying into effect the\r\nprovisions of the treaty \"relating to the fisheries.\" The fourth section\r\nprovided for carrying into effect section 30 of the treaty. These three\r\nsections furnished the legislation contemplated by Article XXXIII of\r\nthe treaty to carry into effect Articles XVIII to XXV and XXX. The act,\r\nhowever, went further, as will be seen by an examination of section 3,\r\nwhich is as follows:\r\n\r\n  That from the date of the President's proclamation authorized by the\r\n  first section of this act, and so long as the Articles XVIII to XXV,\r\n  inclusive, and Article XXX of said treaty shall remain in force,\r\n  according to the terms and conditions of Article XXXIII of said treaty,\r\n  all goods, wares, or merchandise arriving at the ports of New York,\r\n  Boston, and Portland, and any other ports in the United States which\r\n  have been or may from time to time be specially designated by the\r\n  President of the United States, and destined for Her Britannic\r\n  Majesty's possessions in North America, may be entered at the proper\r\n  custom-house and conveyed in transit, without the payment of duties,\r\n  through the territory of the United States, under such rules,\r\n  regulations, and conditions for the protection of the revenue as the\r\n  Secretary of the Treasury may from time to time prescribe; and under\r\n  like rules, regulations, and conditions goods, wares, or merchandise\r\n  may be conveyed in transit, without the payment of duties, from such\r\n  possessions through the territory of the United States, for export\r\n  from the said ports of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that provision is here made for carrying into effect\r\nthe two provisions of Article XXIX which I have already characterized as\r\nthe concessions on the part of the United States, namely, the passage\r\nduty free from certain designated ports of the United States to Canada\r\nof imported goods, and the passage duty free to ports of the United\r\nStates of Canadian goods for export. Section 3 of the law of 1873, which\r\nI have quoted, however, contains a legislative construction of Article\r\nXXIX of the treaty in the limitation that the provisions therein\r\ncontained as to the transit of goods should continue in force only so\r\nlong as Articles XVIII to XXV, inclusive, and XXX of the treaty should\r\nremain in force.\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 1883, Congress passed a joint resolution entitled as\r\nfollows: \"Joint resolution providing for the termination of articles\r\nnumbered XVIII to XXV, inclusive, and article numbered XXX of the treaty\r\nbetween the United States of America and Her Britannic Majesty concluded\r\nat Washington May 8, 1871.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution provided for the giving of notice of the abrogation of\r\nthe articles of the treaty named in the title, and of no others. Section\r\n3 contained the following provision:\r\n\r\n  And the act of Congress approved March 1, A.D. 1873, entitled * * * so\r\n  far as it relates to the articles of said treaty so to be terminated,\r\n  shall be and stand repealed and be of no force on and after the time\r\n  of the expiration of said two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn examination of the debates at the time of the passage of this joint\r\nresolution very clearly shows that Congress made an attempt to save\r\nArticle XXIX of the treaty and section 3 of the act of 1873. In the\r\nSenate on the 21st of February, 1883, the resolution being under\r\nconsideration, several Senators, including Mr. Edmunds, the chairman of\r\nthe Judiciary Committee, expressed the opinion that Article XXIX would\r\nnot be affected by the abrogation of Articles XVIII to XXV and XXX, and\r\nan amendment was made to the resolution with a view to leave section 3\r\nof the act of 1873 in force. The same view was taken in the debates in\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nThe subject again came before Congress in connection with the\r\nconsideration of a bill (S. 3173) to \"authorize the President of the\r\nUnited States to protect and defend the rights of American fishing\r\nvessels, American fishermen, American trading and other vessels in\r\ncertain cases, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate upon the bill in the Senate January 24,\r\n1887, and in the House February 23 following, the prevailing opinion\r\nwas, though not without some dissent, that Article XXIX was still in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of July, 1887, in response to an inquiry by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, Mr. Bayard wrote a letter, a copy of which accompanies\r\nthis message, in which he expresses the opinion that Article XXIX of\r\nthe treaty was unaffected by the abrogation of the fisheries articles\r\nand was still in force. In August, 1888, however, Mr. Cleveland, in\r\na message to Congress, expresses his opinion of the question in the\r\nfollowing language:\r\n\r\n  In any event, and whether the law of 1873 construes the treaty or\r\n  governs it, section 29 of such treaty, I have no doubt, terminated with\r\n  the proceedings taken by our Government to terminate Articles XVIII to\r\n  XXV, inclusive, and Article XXX of the treaty. * * *\r\n\r\n  If by any language used in the joint resolution it was intended to\r\n  relieve section 3 of the act of 1873, embodying Article XXIX of the\r\n  treaty, from its own limitations, or to save the article itself, I am\r\n  entirely satisfied that the intention miscarried.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have asked the opinion of the Attorney-General upon this question, and\r\nhis answer accompanies this message. He is of the opinion that Article\r\nXXIX has been abrogated.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the United States has continuously, through the\r\nTreasury Department, conducted our trade intercourse with Canada as if\r\nArticle XXIX of the treaty and section 3 of the act of 1873 remained\r\nin force, and that Canada has continued to yield in practice the\r\nconcessions made by her in that article. No change in our Treasury\r\nmethods was made following Mr. Cleveland's message from which I have\r\nquoted. I am inclined to think that, using the aids which the protocol\r\nand the nearly contemporaneous legislation by Congress in the act of\r\n1873 furnish in construing the treaty, the better opinion is that\r\nArticle XXIX of the treaty is no longer operative. The enactment of\r\nsection 3 of the act of 1873 was a clear declaration that legislation\r\nwas necessary to put Article XXIX of the treaty into operation, and that\r\nunder the treaty our obligation to provide such legislation terminated\r\nwhenever Articles XVIII to XXV and XXX should be abrogated. This\r\nlegislation was accepted by Great Britain as a compliance with our\r\nobligations under the treaty. No objection was made that our statute\r\ntreated Article XXIX as having force only so long as the other articles\r\nnamed were in force.\r\n\r\nBut the question whether Article XXIX is in force has less practical\r\nimportance than has been supposed, for it does not, if in force, place\r\nany restraints upon the United States as to the method of dealing with\r\nimported merchandise destined for the United States arriving at a\r\nCanadian port for transportation to the United States, or of merchandise\r\npassing through Canadian territory from one place in the United States\r\nto another. It would be no infraction either of the letter or of the\r\nspirit of the treaty if we should stop, unload, and carefully inspect\r\nevery vehicle arriving at our border with such merchandise; nor, on the\r\nother hand, would Canada violate her obligations under the treaty by a\r\nlike treatment of merchandise imported through the port of New York on\r\nits arrival in Canada. Neither Government has placed itself under any\r\nrestraint as to merchandise intended for the use of its own people\r\nwhen such merchandise comes within its own territory. The question,\r\ntherefore, as to how we shall deal with merchandise imported by our own\r\npeople through a Canadian port and with merchandise passing from one\r\nplace in the United States to another through Canadian territory is\r\nwholly one of domestic policy and law.\r\n\r\nI turn now to consider the legislation of Congress upon this subject,\r\nupon which, as it seems to me, the duties of the Treasury and the rights\r\nof our people as to those phases of the transportation question to which\r\nI have just alluded wholly depend. Sections 3005 and 3006 of the Revised\r\nStatutes, which are taken from the act of July 28, 1866, entitled\r\n\"An act to protect the revenue, and for other purposes\" (14 U.S.\r\nStatutes at Large, p. 328), are as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 3005. All merchandise arriving at the ports of New York, Boston,\r\n  Portland in Maine, or any other port specially designated by the\r\n  Secretary of the Treasury, and destined for places in the adjacent\r\n  British Provinces, or arriving at the port of [_Point Isabel_]\r\n  [Brownsville] in Texas, or any other port specially designated by the\r\n  Secretary of the Treasury, and destined for places in the Republic of\r\n  Mexico, may be entered at the custom-house and conveyed in transit\r\n  through the territory of the United States without the payment of\r\n  duties, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may\r\n  prescribe.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 3006. Imported merchandise in bond, or duty paid, and products\r\n  or manufactures of the United States, may, with the consent of the\r\n  proper authorities of the British Provinces or Republic of Mexico, be\r\n  transported from one port in the United States to another port therein,\r\n  over the territory of such Provinces or Republic, by such routes and\r\n  under such rules, regulations, and conditions as the Secretary of the\r\n  Treasury may prescribe; and the merchandise so transported shall,\r\n  upon arrival in the United States from such Provinces or Republic, be\r\n  treated in regard to the liability to or exemption from duty or tax as\r\n  if the transportation had taken place entirely within the limits of\r\n  the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3102 of the Revised Statutes is also related to this subject,\r\nand is as follows:\r\n\r\n  To avoid the inspection at the first port of arrival, the owner,\r\n  agent, master, or conductor of any such vessel, car, or other vehicle,\r\n  or owner, agent, or other person having charge of any such merchandise,\r\n  baggage, effects, or other articles, may apply to any officer of\r\n  the United States duly authorized to act in the premises to seal or\r\n  close the same, under and according to the regulations hereinafter\r\n  authorized, previous to their importation into the United States, which\r\n  officer shall seal or close the same accordingly; whereupon the same\r\n  may proceed to their port of destination without further inspection.\r\n  Every such vessel, car, or other vehicle shall proceed without\r\n  unnecessary delay to the port of its destination, as named in the\r\n  manifest of its cargo, freight, or contents, and be there inspected.\r\n  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to exempt such\r\n  vessel, car, or vehicle, or its contents, from such examination as\r\n  may be necessary and proper to prevent frauds upon the revenue and\r\n  violations of this title.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that section 3005 does not provide for the transit of\r\nmerchandise through our territory from Canada to ports of the United\r\nStates for export, nor have I been able to find any other law now in\r\nforce that does provide for such transit. It would seem, therefore, that\r\nas to this concession made by the United States in Article XXIX of the\r\ntreaty, legislation to put it into force was necessary, and that there\r\nis no such legislation unless section 3 of the act of 1873 was saved by\r\nthe amendment to the joint resolution abrogating the fisheries articles\r\nand Article XXX, limiting the repeal to so much of said act as \"relates\r\nto the articles of said treaty so to be terminated.\" The joint\r\nresolution certainly did not repeal section 3, and if that section has\r\nceased to be operative it is by virtue of the limitation contained in\r\nthe section itself. I think it did expire by its own express limitation.\r\n\r\nThe question has presented itself whether section 3 of the act of 1873\r\n(U.S. Revised Statutes, sec. 2866) repealed by implication that section\r\nof the act of July, 1866, which is now section 3005 of the Revised\r\nStatutes; but I am of the opinion that the last-named section was not\r\nrepealed. Section 3 of the act of 1873 was expressly intended to carry\r\ninto effect a treaty obligation and was limited as to time. It contained\r\nno express repeal of the act of 1866, and while its provisions were\r\nbroader than the last-named act, they were not inconsistent, save in the\r\nprovision that while the act of 1873 was in force the additional ports\r\nin the United States at which Canadian goods might be received were\r\nto be designated by the President, whereas under the act of 1866 the\r\ndesignation was by the Secretary of the Treasury. The last-named act\r\nrelated also to intercourse with Mexico, and I think was unaffected\r\nby the act of 1873.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the law permits merchandise arriving at the ports\r\nof New York, Boston, Portland in Maine, and at other ports specially\r\ndesignated by the Secretary of the Treasury, for places in the adjacent\r\nBritish Provinces, to be entered at the custom-house of the port where\r\nit is landed and conveyed through the territory of the United States\r\nwithout the payment of duty, under regulations to be prescribed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. As these goods come immediately and fully\r\nunder the inspection of our customs officers at the principal ports, are\r\nentered there and remain until they cross our border into Canada fully\r\nunder our supervision, there is little or no danger involved to our\r\nrevenue. The regulations prescribed by the Treasury for conducting this\r\ntraffic seem to me to be adequate.\r\n\r\nAs to merchandise imported into the United States from a contiguous\r\nforeign country, it is provided by section 3102 that the inspection at\r\nthe first port of arrival in the United States may be avoided if the\r\nvehicle in which the same arrives has been sealed or closed by some\r\nofficer of the United States duly authorized at some point in the\r\ncontiguous country. When the act of closing or sealing conformably\r\nto the regulations of the Treasury has been effected, the car or\r\nother vehicle may proceed without unnecessary delay to the port of\r\nits destination, as named in the manifest of its cargo, freight, or\r\ncontents, and be there inspected. This privilege, however, is subject\r\nto such examination at the point of entry to the United States as may\r\nbe necessary to prevent fraud. It is important to be noticed that the\r\nmerchandise to which this section refers is described in section 3100 as\r\nmerchandise, etc., \"imported into the United States from any contiguous\r\nforeign country.\"\r\n\r\nA practice has grown up, and a traffic of considerable dimensions\r\nunder it, of allowing merchandise from China and Japan, purchased and\r\nimported from those countries by our own citizens and landed at ports\r\nin the Dominion of Canada, to be there loaded into cars, which, being\r\nsealed by an officer of the United States or some one supposed to\r\nrepresent him, are forwarded through the territory of Canada, across\r\nthe entire continent, and allowed to cross our frontier without other\r\ninspection than an examination of the seals. The real fact is that the\r\nAmerican consul can not and does not either compare the manifest with\r\nthe contents of the cars or attach the seals. The agents of the\r\ntransportation companies are furnished by the consul with the seals and\r\nplace them upon the cars. The practice of sealing such merchandise,\r\nnotwithstanding it has been allowed by the Treasury for some years,\r\nI think is unauthorized. Such merchandise is not imported from a\r\n\"contiguous country,\" but from China and Japan.\r\n\r\nIt has never become subject to the Canadian revenue laws as an\r\nimportation from Japan to Canada, but by force of the treaty or by the\r\ncourtesy of that government has been treated as subject to the revenue\r\nlaws of the United States from the time of landing at the Canadian port.\r\nOur Treasury seal has been placed upon it; Canada only gives it passage.\r\nIt is no more an importation from Canada than is a train load of wheat\r\nthat starts from Detroit and is transported through Canada to another\r\nport of the United States. Section 3102 was enacted in 1864, two years\r\nbefore sections 3005 and 3006, and could not have had reference to the\r\nlater methods of importing merchandise through one country to the other.\r\n\r\nThe practice to which I have referred not only equalizes the advantages\r\nof Canadian seaports with our own in the importation of goods for our\r\ndomestic consumption, but makes the Canadian ports favored ports of\r\nentry. The detentions under this system at the Canadian ports are less\r\nthan when the merchandise is landed at a port of the United States to be\r\nforwarded in bond to another port therein. Full effect should be given\r\nto section 3102 as to merchandise imported into the United States from\r\nCanada, so far as the appropriations enable the Treasury to provide the\r\nofficers to do the work of closing and sealing. It will, however, be\r\nrequired that all this kind of work be done, and carefully done, by\r\nan officer of the United States, and that the duty shall in no case\r\nbe delegated to the employees of the transportation companies. The\r\nconsiderations that it is quite doubtful whether a fraud committed in\r\nCanada by one of our agents upon our revenue would be punishable in our\r\ncourts, and that such a fraud committed by anyone else certainly would\r\nnot be, and that even if such acts are made penal by our statutes\r\nthe criminal would be secure against extradition, seem to me to be\r\nconclusive against the policy of attempting to maintain such revenue\r\nagents in Canadian territory.\r\n\r\nI come now to discuss another element of this international traffic,\r\nnamely, the transportation of merchandise from one \"port\" in the United\r\nStates to another \"port\" therein over the territory of Canada. This\r\ntraffic is enormous in its dimensions, and very great interests have\r\ngrown up in the United States in connection with it. Section 3006\r\nauthorizes this traffic, subject to \"such rules, regulations, and\r\nconditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe;\" but the\r\nimportant limitation is from \"port\" to \"port.\" Section 3007 of the\r\nRevised Statutes, which exempts sealed cars from certain fees, preserves\r\nthe terms of the preceding section--from \"port\" to \"port.\" It seems to\r\nme that sections 3006 and 3007 contemplate the delivery of the sealed\r\ncars at a \"port\" of the United States, there to be examined by a revenue\r\nofficer and their contents verified; but in practice the car, if the\r\nseal is found at the border to be intact, is passed to places not\r\n\"ports\" and is opened and unloaded by the consignee, no officer being\r\npresent. The bill or manifest accompanying the merchandise and the\r\nunbroken seal on the car may furnish _prima facie_ evidence that the\r\namount and kind of merchandise named in the manifest and said to be\r\ncontained in the car came from a port in the United States, but\r\ncertainly it was not intended that the merchandise should go to the\r\nowner without an official ascertainment of the correspondence between\r\nthe bill and the actual contents of the car.\r\n\r\nI pass at this point any discussion of the question whether as a\r\nnational policy this traffic should be promoted. It is enough to say\r\nthat as the law stands it is authorized between \"ports\" of the United\r\nStates, and that the rules, regulations, and conditions to be prescribed\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury must not, in view of this declaration\r\nof the legislative will, be further restrictive of the traffic than may\r\nreasonably be necessary to protect the revenues of the United States.\r\nIn determining whether further regulations are reasonably necessary to\r\nprevent frauds against our revenue it is not conclusive, at least, to\r\nsay that frauds against the revenue under the existing system have not\r\nbeen discovered. The question is, Are the regulations such as to provide\r\nproper safeguards against fraud, or are they such as to make fraud easy\r\nto those who have the disposition to commit it? If all cars carrying\r\nthis merchandise are carefully and honestly inspected at the point of\r\nlading and are securely closed during the transit, the revenue would be\r\nsecure, for the proper lading of these cars is not subject to duty.\r\nFrauds can only be perpetrated by introducing products not subject to\r\nfree entry. In practice the seals and locks provided by the Treasury\r\nDepartment do not give security that these cars, in the long transit in\r\nwhich they are free from observation by officers of the revenue, may not\r\nbe opened and dutiable merchandise added.\r\n\r\nThe duplication of the seals used, composed of wire and lead, is easy,\r\nand the opening of locks scarcely less so. If, however, the cars, when\r\nthey arrive in the United States, either at the point where our boundary\r\nis crossed or at some other port of the United States, were subject to\r\nthe inspection of a revenue officer before the delivery to the consignee\r\nor owner, the manifest could be verified. The inspection, however, is\r\nnow limited to an examination of the lock or seal. The car is not\r\nweighed or opened to verify its contents. I do not think this is an\r\nadequate protection against the surreptitious introduction into the\r\ncars, while on foreign territory, of dutiable articles. It will be seen\r\nby the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury that grain the product\r\nof the United States is now largely transported in American vessels to\r\nCanadian lake ports, and after being there placed in elevators is sent\r\neast in cars sealed by agents of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nNo observation is taken of this grain until its arrival in Canada, where\r\nonly the amount and grade are noted by a Treasury agent, and a like\r\namount in grade and quantity (though it may be not the identical grain)\r\nis by such agent billed and sealed in cars for carriage to the United\r\nStates. I do not find any statute authorizing this practice. Section\r\n3006, which authorizes this interstate trade through Canada, is limited\r\nto merchandise passing from \"port\" to \"port\" of the United States, and\r\nplainly means that such merchandise shall be taken up by our revenue\r\nofficers at a \"port\" of the United States as a starting point.\r\n\r\nThe following are the conclusions at which I have arrived:\r\n\r\nFirst. That Article XXIX of the treaty of Washington has been abrogated.\r\n\r\nSecond. That even if this article were in force there is no law in force\r\nto execute it.\r\n\r\nThird. That when in force the treaty imposed no obligation upon the\r\nUnited States to use the concessions as to transit made by Canada, and\r\nno limitation upon the powers of the United States in dealing with\r\nmerchandise imported for the use of our citizens through Canadian ports\r\nor passing from one place in the United States to another through\r\nCanada, upon the arrival of such merchandise at our border.\r\n\r\nFourth. That therefore, treaty or no treaty, the question of sealing\r\ncars containing such merchandise and the treatment of such sealed cars\r\nwhen they cross our border is and always has been one to be settled by\r\nour laws, according to our convenience and our interests as we may see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFifth. That the law authorizing the sealing of cars in Canada containing\r\nforeign merchandise imported from a contiguous country does not apply to\r\nmerchandise imported by our own people from countries not contiguous and\r\ncarried through Canada for delivery to such owners.\r\n\r\nSixth. That the law did not contemplate the passing of sealed cars to\r\nany place not a \"port,\" nor the delivery of such cars to the owner or\r\nconsignee, to be opened by him without the supervision of a revenue\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nSeventh. That such a practice is inconsistent with the safety of the\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThe statutes relating to the transportation of merchandise between\r\nthe United States and the British possessions should be the subject\r\nof revision. The Treasury regulations have given to these laws a\r\nconstruction and a scope that I do not think was contemplated by\r\nCongress. A policy adapted to the new conditions, growing in part out of\r\nthe construction of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, should be declared,\r\nand the business placed upon a basis more just to our people and to our\r\ntransportation companies.\r\n\r\nIf we continue the policy of supervising rates and requiring that they\r\nshall be equal and reasonable upon the railroads of the United States,\r\nwe can not in fairness at the same time give these unusual facilities\r\nfor competition to Canadian roads that are free to pursue the practices\r\nas to cut rates and favored rates that we condemn and punish if\r\npracticed by our own railroads.\r\n\r\nI regret that circumstances prevented an earlier examination by me of\r\nthese questions, but submit now these views in the hope that they may\r\nlead to a revision of the laws upon a safer and juster basis.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the correspondence between the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury and the Attorney-General upon some phases of this question.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 15, 1893_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, with a view to its ratification, a treaty of\r\nannexation concluded on the 14th day of February, 1893, between John W.\r\nFoster, Secretary of State, who was duly empowered to act in that behalf\r\non the part of the United States, and Lorin A. Thurston, W.R. Castle,\r\nW.C. Wilder, C.L. Carter, and Joseph Marsden, the commissioners on the\r\npart of the Government of the Hawaiian Islands. The provisional treaty,\r\nit will be observed, does not attempt to deal in detail with the\r\nquestions that grow out of the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the\r\nUnited States. The commissioners representing the Hawaiian Government\r\nhave consented to leave to the future and to the just and benevolent\r\npurposes of the United States the adjustment of all such questions.\r\n\r\nI do not deem it necessary to discuss at any length the conditions which\r\nhave resulted in this decisive action. It has been the policy of the\r\nAdministration not only to respect but to encourage the continuance of\r\nan independent government in the Hawaiian Islands so long as it afforded\r\nsuitable guaranties for the protection of life and property and\r\nmaintained a stability and strength that gave adequate security against\r\nthe domination of any other power. The moral support of this Government\r\nhas continually manifested itself in the most friendly diplomatic\r\nrelations and in many acts of courtesy to the Hawaiian rulers.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the monarchy was not in any way promoted by this\r\nGovernment, but had its origin in what seems to have been a reactionary\r\nand revolutionary policy on the part of Queen Liliuokalani, which put\r\nin serious peril not only the large and preponderating interests of the\r\nUnited States in the islands, but all foreign interests, and, indeed,\r\nthe decent administration of civil affairs and the peace of the islands.\r\nIt is quite evident that the monarchy had become effete and the Queen's\r\nGovernment so weak and inadequate as to be the prey of designing and\r\nunscrupulous persons. The restoration of Queen Liliuokalani to her\r\nthrone is undesirable, if not impossible, and unless actively supported\r\nby the United States would be accompanied by serious disaster and the\r\ndisorganization of all business interests. The influence and interest of\r\nthe United States in the islands must be increased and not diminished.\r\n\r\nOnly two courses are now open--one the establishment of a protectorate\r\nby the United States, and the other annexation full and complete. I\r\nthink the latter course, which has been adopted in the treaty, will be\r\nhighly promotive of the best interests of the Hawaiian people, and is\r\nthe only one that will adequately secure the interests of the United\r\nStates. These interests are not wholly selfish. It is essential that\r\nnone of the other great powers shall secure these islands. Such a\r\npossession would not consist with our safety and with the peace of the\r\nworld. This view of the situation is so apparent and conclusive that no\r\nprotest has been heard from any government against proceedings looking\r\nto annexation. Every foreign representative at Honolulu promptly\r\nacknowledged the Provisional Government, and I think there is a general\r\nconcurrence in the opinion that the deposed Queen ought not to be\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nPrompt action upon this treaty is very desirable. If it meets the\r\napproval of the Senate, peace and good order will be secured in the\r\nislands under existing laws until such time as Congress can provide\r\nby legislation a permanent form of government for the islands. This\r\nlegislation should be, and I do not doubt will be, not only just to the\r\nnatives and all other residents and citizens of the islands, but should\r\nbe characterized by great liberality and a high regard to the rights of\r\nall people and of all foreigners domiciled there. The correspondence\r\nwhich accompanies the treaty will put the Senate in possession of all\r\nthe facts known to the Executive.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

The law creates two new officers, whose aggregate\r\ncompensation may be $12,000 per annum, without, it seems to me, a\r\njustifying necessity. But the most serious objection to the legislation\r\nis that it creates at once upon the taking effect of the law the offices\r\nof district attorney and marshal for each of the three districts, and\r\nthe effect, it seems to me, must be to abolish the offices as they now\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nNo provision is made for a continued discharge of the duties of marshal\r\nand district attorney by the present incumbents. A serious question\r\nwould be raised as to whether these officers were not at once legislated\r\nout of office and vacancies created. As these vacancies could not be\r\nfilled immediately, the business of the courts would seriously suffer.\r\nThe law should at least have contained a provision for the continued\r\ndischarge of their duties by the incumbents until the new officers were\r\nappointed and qualified.\r\n\r\nBENJ.

In 1876 he was elected to the Senate. He resigned\r\nhis seat in that body in 1881 to accept the position of Secretary of\r\nState in the Cabinet of President Garfield. After the tragic death\r\nof his chief he resigned from the Cabinet, and, devoting himself to\r\nliterary work, gave to the public in his Twenty Years of Congress a\r\nmost valuable and enduring contribution to our political literature.\r\nIn March, 1889, he again became Secretary of State, and continued to\r\nexercise this office until June, 1892. His devotion to the public\r\ninterests, his marked ability, and his exalted patriotism have won for\r\nhim the gratitude and affection of his countrymen and the admiration\r\nof the world. In the varied pursuits of legislation, diplomacy, and\r\nliterature his genius has added new luster to American citizenship.\r\n\r\nAs a suitable expression of the national appreciation of his great\r\npublic services and of the general sorrow caused by his death, I direct\r\nthat on the day of his funeral all the Departments of the executive\r\nbranch of the Government at Washington be closed, and that on all public\r\nbuildings throughout the United States the national flag shall be\r\ndisplayed at half-staff, and that for a period of thirty days the\r\nDepartment of State be draped in mourning.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 27th day of January, A.D. 1893, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and\r\nseventeenth.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN W. FOSTER,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.",
