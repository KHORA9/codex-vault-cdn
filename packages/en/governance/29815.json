It has been criticised from different\r\npoints of view with directly opposing results. The political scientist\r\nand the historian, thoroughly appreciating its importance, have\r\nrepeatedly come to the conclusion that the Declaration had no small part\r\nin the anarchy with which France was visited soon after the storming of\r\nthe Bastille. They point to its abstract phrases as ambiguous and\r\ntherefore dangerous, and as void of all political reality and practical\r\nstatesmanship. Its empty pathos, they say, confused the mind, disturbed\r\ncalm judgment, aroused passions, and stifled the sense of duty,--for of\r\nduty there is not a word.[1] Others, on the contrary, and especially\r\nFrenchmen, have exalted it as a revelation in the world's history, as a\r\ncatechism of the \"principles of 1789\" which form the eternal foundation\r\nof the state's structure, and they have glorified it as the most\r\nprecious gift that France has given to mankind.\r\n\r\nLess regarded than its historical and political significance is the\r\nimportance of this document in the history of law, an importance which\r\ncontinues even to the present day. Whatever may be the value or\r\nworthlessness of its general phrases, it is under the influence of this\r\ndocument that the conception of the public rights of the individual has\r\ndeveloped in the positive law of the states of the European continent.\r\nUntil it appeared public law literature recognized the rights of heads\r\nof states, the privileges of class, and the privileges of individuals or\r\nspecial corporations, but the general rights of subjects were to be\r\nfound essentially only in the form of duties on the part of the state,\r\nnot in the form of definite legal claims of the individual. The\r\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man for the first time originated in all\r\nits vigor in positive law the conception, which until then had been\r\nknown only to natural law, of the personal rights of the members of the\r\nstate over against the state as a whole. This was next seen in the first\r\nFrench constitution of September 3, 1791, which set forth, upon the\r\nbasis of a preceding declaration of rights, a list of _droits naturels\r\net civils_ as rights that were guaranteed by the constitution.[2]\r\nTogether with the right of suffrage, the \"_droits garantis par la\r\nconstitution_\", which were enumerated for the last time in the\r\nconstitution of November 4, 1848,[3] form to-day the basis of French\r\ntheory and practice respecting the personal public rights of the\r\nindividual.[4] And under the influence of the French declaration there\r\nhave been introduced into almost all of the constitutions of the other\r\nContinental states similar enumerations of rights, whose separate\r\nphrases and formulas, however, are more or less adapted to the\r\nparticular conditions of their respective states, and therefore\r\nfrequently exhibit wide differences in content.\r\n\r\nIn Germany most of the constitutions of the period prior to 1848\r\ncontained a section upon the rights of subjects, and in the year 1848\r\nthe National Constitutional Convention at Frankfort adopted \"the\r\nfundamental rights of the German people\", which were published on\r\nDecember 27, 1848, as Federal law. In spite of a resolution of the\r\n_Bund_ of August 23, 1851, declaring these rights null and void, they\r\nare of lasting importance, because many of their specifications are\r\nto-day incorporated almost word for word in the existing Federal law.[5]\r\nThese enumerations of rights appear in greater numbers in the European\r\nconstitutions of the period after 1848. Thus, first of all, in the\r\nPrussian constitution of January 31, 1850, and in Austria's \"Fundamental\r\nLaw of the State\" of December 21, 1867, on the general rights of the\r\nstate's citizens. And more recently they have been incorporated in the\r\nconstitutions of the new states in the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy exception to this are the constitutions of the North German\r\nConfederation of July 26, 1867, and of the German Empire of April 16,\r\n1871, which lack entirely any paragraph on fundamental rights. The\r\nconstitution of the Empire, however, could the better dispense with such\r\na declaration as it was already contained in most of the constitutions\r\nof the individual states, and, as above stated, a series of Federal laws\r\nhas enacted the most important principles of the Frankfort fundamental\r\nrights. Besides, with the provisions of the Federal constitution as to\r\namendments, it was not necessary to make any special place for them in\r\nthat instrument, as the Reichstag, to whose especial care the\r\nguardianship of the fundamental rights must be entrusted, has no\r\ndifficult forms to observe in amending the constitution.[6] As a matter\r\nof fact the public rights of the individual are much greater in the\r\nGerman Empire than in most of the states where the fundamental rights\r\nare specifically set forth in the constitution. This may be seen, for\r\nexample, by a glance at the legislation and the judicial and\r\nadministrative practice in Austria.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be one's opinion to-day upon the formulation of\r\nabstract principles, which only become vitalized through the process of\r\ndetailed legislation, as affecting the legal position of the individual\r\nin the state, the fact that the recognition of such principles is\r\nhistorically bound up with that first declaration of rights makes it an\r\nimportant task of constitutional history to ascertain the origin of the\r\nFrench Declaration of Rights of 1789. The achievement of this task is of\r\ngreat importance both in explaining the development of the modern state\r\nand in understanding the position which this state assures to the\r\nindividual. Thus far in the works on public law various precursors of\r\nthe declaration of the Constituent Assembly, from Magna Charta to the\r\nAmerican Declaration of Independence, have been enumerated and arranged\r\nin regular sequence, yet any thorough investigation of the sources from\r\nwhich the French drew is not to be found.\r\n\r\nIt is the prevailing opinion that the teachings of the _Contrat Social_\r\ngave the impulse to the Declaration, and that its prototype was the\r\nDeclaration of Independence of the thirteen United States of North\r\nAmerica. Let us first of all inquire into the correctness of these\r\nassumptions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: First of all, as is well known, Burke and Bentham, and\r\nlater Taine, _Les origines de la France contemporaine: La révolution_,\r\nI, pp. 273 _et seq._; Oncken, _Das Zeitalter der Revolution, des\r\nKaiserreiches und der Befreiungskriege_, I, pp. 229 _et seq._; and\r\nWeiss, _Geschichte der französischen Revolution_, 1888, I, p. 263.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Titre premier: \"Dispositions fondamentales garanties par la\r\nconstitution.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Hélie, _Les constitutions de la France_, pp. 1103 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Cf._ Jellinek, _System der subjektiven öffentlichen\r\nRechte_, p. 3, n. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Binding, _Der Versuch der Reichsgründung durch die\r\nPaulskirche_, Leipzig, 1892, p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: When considering the constitution, the Reichstag rejected\r\nall proposals which aimed to introduce fundamental rights. _Cf._ Bezold,\r\n_Materialen der deutschen Reichsverfassung_, III, pp. 896-1010.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nROUSSEAU'S _CONTRAT SOCIAL_ WAS NOT THE SOURCE OF THIS DECLARATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his _History of Political Science_--the most comprehensive work of\r\nthat kind which France possesses--Paul Janet, after a thorough\r\npresentation of the _Contrat Social_, discusses the influence which this\r\nwork of Rousseau's exercised upon the Revolution. The idea of the\r\ndeclaration of rights is to be traced back to Rousseau's teachings. What\r\nelse is the declaration itself than the formulation of the state\r\ncontract according to Rousseau's ideas? And what are the several rights\r\nbut the stipulations and specifications of that contract?[7]\r\n\r\nIt is hard to understand how an authority upon the _Contrat Social_\r\ncould make such a statement though in accord with popular opinion.\r\n\r\nThe social contract has only one stipulation, namely, the complete\r\ntransference to the community of all the individual's rights.[8] The\r\nindividual does not retain one particle of his rights from the moment he\r\nenters the state.[9] Everything that he receives of the nature of right\r\nhe gets from the _volonté générale_, which is the sole judge of its own\r\nlimits, and ought not to be, and cannot be, restricted by the law of any\r\npower. Even property belongs to the individual only by virtue of state\r\nconcession. The social contract makes the state the master of the goods\r\nof its members,[10] and the latter remain in possession only as the\r\ntrustees of public property.[11] Civil liberty consists simply of what\r\nis left to the individual after taking his duties as a citizen into\r\naccount.[12] These duties can only be imposed by law, and according to\r\nthe social contract the laws must be the same for all citizens. This is\r\nthe only restriction upon the sovereign power,[13] but it is a\r\nrestriction which follows from the very nature of that power, and it\r\ncarries in itself its own guarantees.[14]\r\n\r\nThe conception of an original right, which man brings with him into\r\nsociety and which appears as a restriction upon the rights of the\r\nsovereign, is specifically rejected by Rousseau. There is no fundamental\r\nlaw which can be binding upon the whole people, not even the social\r\ncontract itself.[15]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Rights, however, would draw dividing lines between\r\nthe state and the individual, which the lawmaker should ever keep before\r\nhis eyes as the limits that have been set him once and for all by \"the\r\nnatural, inalienable and sacred rights of man.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThe principles of the _Contrat Social_ are accordingly at enmity with\r\nevery declaration of rights. For from these principles there ensues not\r\nthe right of the individual, but the omnipotence of the common will,\r\nunrestricted by law. Taine comprehended better than Janet the\r\nconsequences of the _Contrat Social_.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of August 26, 1789, originated in opposition to the\r\n_Contrat Social_. The ideas of the latter work exercised, indeed, a\r\ncertain influence upon the style of some clauses of the Declaration, but\r\nthe conception of the Declaration itself must have come from some other\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"Est-il nécessaire de prouver, qu'un tel acte ne vient\r\npoint de Montesquieu, mais de J.-J. Rousseau?... Mais l'acte même de la\r\ndéclaration est-il autre chose que le contrat passé entre tous les\r\nmembres de la communauté, selon les idées de Rousseau?

It had already\r\nappeared in a number of _cahiers_. The _cahier_ of the _Bailliage_ of\r\nNemours is well worth noting, as it contained a chapter entitled \"On the\r\nNecessity of a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens\",[18]\r\nand sketched a plan of such a declaration with thirty articles. Among\r\nother plans that in the _cahier des tiers état_ of the city of Paris has\r\nsome interest.[19]\r\n\r\nIn the National Assembly, however, it was Lafayette who on July 11,\r\n1789, made the motion to enact a declaration of rights in connection\r\nwith the constitution, and he therewith laid before the assembly a plan\r\nof such a declaration.[20]\r\n\r\nIt is the prevailing opinion that Lafayette was inspired to make this\r\nmotion by the North American Declaration of Independence.[21] And this\r\ninstrument is further declared to have been the model that the\r\nConstituent Assembly had in mind in framing its declaration. The sharp,\r\npointed style and the practical character of the American document are\r\ncited by many as in praiseworthy contrast to the confusing verbosity and\r\ndogmatic theory of the French Declaration.[22] Others bring forward, as\r\na more fitting object of comparison, the first amendments to the\r\nconstitution of the United States,[23] and even imagine that the latter\r\nexerted some influence upon the French Declaration, in spite of the fact\r\nthat they did not come into existence until after August 26, 1789. This\r\nerror has arisen from the French Declaration of 1789 having been\r\nembodied word for word in the Constitution of September 3, 1791, and so\r\nto one not familiar with French constitutional history, and before whom\r\nonly the texts of the constitutions themselves are lying, it seems to\r\nbear a later date.\r\n\r\nBy practically all those, however, who look further back than the French\r\nDeclaration it is asserted that the Declaration of Independence of the\r\nUnited States on July 4, 1776, contains the first exposition of a series\r\nof rights of man.[24]\r\n\r\nYet the American Declaration of Independence contains only a single\r\nparagraph that resembles a declaration of rights. It reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\r\nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable\r\nRights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness;\r\nThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,\r\nderiving their just powers from the consent of the governed; That\r\nwhenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is\r\nthe Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new\r\nGovernment, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its\r\npowers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their\r\nSafety and Happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThis sentence is so general in its content that it is difficult to read\r\ninto it, or deduct from it, a whole system of rights. It is therefore,\r\nat the very start, improbable that it served as the model for the French\r\nDeclaration.\r\n\r\nThis conjecture becomes a certainty through Lafayette's own statement.\r\nIn a place in his _Memoirs_, that has as yet been completely overlooked,\r\nLafayette mentions the model that he had in mind when making his motion\r\nin the Constituent Assembly.[25] He very pertinently points out that the\r\nCongress of the newly formed Confederation of North American free states\r\nwas then in no position to set up, for the separate colonies, which had\r\nalready become sovereign states, rules of right which would have binding\r\nforce. He brings out the fact that in the Declaration of Independence\r\nthere are asserted only the principles of the sovereignty of the people\r\nand the right to change the form of government. Other rights are\r\nincluded solely by implication from the enumeration of the violations of\r\nright, which justified the separation from the mother country.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of the separate states, however, were preceded by\r\ndeclarations of rights, which were binding upon the people's\r\nrepresentatives. _The first state to set forth a declaration of rights\r\nproperly so called was Virginia._[26]\r\n\r\nThe declarations of Virginia and of the other individual American states\r\nwere the sources of Lafayette's proposition. They influenced not only\r\nLafayette, but all who sought to bring about a declaration of rights.\r\nEven the above-mentioned _cahiers_ were affected by them.\r\n\r\nThe new constitutions of the separate American states were well known at\r\nthat time in France. As early as 1778 a French translation of them,\r\ndedicated to Franklin, had appeared in Switzerland.[27] Another was\r\npublished in 1783 at Benjamin Franklin's own instigation.[28] Their\r\ninfluence upon the constitutional legislation of the French Revolution\r\nis by no means sufficiently recognized. In Europe until quite recently\r\nonly the Federal constitution was known, not the constitutions of the\r\nindividual states, which are assuming a very prominent place in modern\r\nconstitutional history. This must be evident from the fact, which is\r\neven yet unrecognized by some distinguished historians and teachers of\r\npublic law, that the individual American states had the first written\r\nconstitutions. In England and France the importance of the American\r\nstate constitutions has begun to be appreciated,[29] but in Germany they\r\nhave remained as yet almost unnoticed. For a long time, to be sure, the\r\ntext of the older constitutions in their entirety were only with\r\ndifficulty accessible in Europe. But through the edition, prepared by\r\norder of the United States Senate,[30] containing all the American\r\nconstitutions since the very earliest period, one is now in a position\r\nto become acquainted with these exceptionally important documents.\r\n\r\nThe French Declaration of Rights is for the most part copied from the\r\nAmerican declarations or \"bills of rights\".[31] All drafts of the French\r\nDeclaration, from those of the _cahiers_ to the twenty-one proposals\r\nbefore the National Assembly, vary more or less from the original,\r\neither in conciseness or in breadth, in cleverness or in awkwardness of\r\nexpression. But so far as substantial additions are concerned they\r\npresent only doctrinaire statements of a purely theoretical nature or\r\nelaborations, which belong to the realm of political metaphysics. To\r\nenter upon them here is unnecessary. Let us confine ourselves to the\r\ncompleted work, the Declaration as it was finally determined after long\r\ndebate in the sessions from the twentieth to the twenty-sixth of\r\nAugust.[32]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: \"De la nécessité d'établir quels sont les droits de\r\nl'homme et des citoyens, et d'en faire une déclaration qu'ils puissent\r\nopposer à toutes les espèces d'injustice.\"--_Archives parlementaires I.\r\nSérie_, IV, pp. 161 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Archives parl._, V, pp. 281 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Arch. parl._, VIII, pp. 221, 222.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Cf. e.g._ H. v.

Of the thirteen states that originally made up the Union,\r\neleven had responded to this appeal before the outbreak of the French\r\nRevolution. Two retained the colonial charters that had been granted\r\nthem by the English crown, and invested these documents with the\r\ncharacter of constitutions, namely, Connecticut the charter of 1662, and\r\nRhode Island that of 1663, so that these charters are the oldest written\r\nconstitutions in the modern sense.[33]\r\n\r\nOf the other states Virginia was the first to enact a constitution in\r\nthe convention which met at Williamsburg from May 6 to June 29, 1776. It\r\nwas prefaced with a formal \"bill of rights\",[34] which had been adopted\r\nby the convention on the twelfth of June. The author of this document\r\nwas George Mason, although Madison exercised a decided influence upon\r\nthe form that was finally adopted.[35] This declaration of Virginia's\r\nserved as a pattern for all the others, even for that of the Congress of\r\nthe United States, which was issued three weeks later, and, as is well\r\nknown, was drawn up by Jefferson, a citizen of Virginia. In the other\r\ndeclarations there were many stipulations formulated somewhat\r\ndifferently, and also many new particulars were added.[36]\r\n\r\nExpress declarations of rights had been formulated after Virginia's\r\nbefore 1789 in the constitutions of\r\n\r\n   Pennsylvania of September 28, 1776,\r\n   Maryland of November 11, 1776,\r\n   North Carolina of December 18, 1776,\r\n   Vermont of July 8, 1777,[37]\r\n   Massachusetts of March 2, 1780,\r\n   New Hampshire of October 31, 1783, (in force June 2, 1784.)\r\n\r\nIn the oldest constitutions of New Jersey, South Carolina, New York and\r\nGeorgia special bills of rights are wanting, although they contain many\r\nprovisions which belong in that category.[38] The French translation of\r\nthe American Constitutions of 1778 includes a _déclaration expositive\r\ndes droits_ by Delaware that is lacking in Poore's collection.[39]\r\n\r\nIn the following section the separate articles of the French Declaration\r\nare placed in comparison with the corresponding articles from the\r\nAmerican declarations. Among the latter, however, I have sought out only\r\nthose that most nearly approach the form of expression in the French\r\ntext. But it must be once more strongly emphasized that the fundamental\r\nideas of the American declarations generally duplicate each other, so\r\nthat the same stipulation reappears in different form in the greater\r\nnumber of the bills of rights.\r\n\r\nWe shall leave out the introduction with which the Constituent Assembly\r\nprefaced its declaration, and begin at once with the enumeration of the\r\nrights themselves. But even the introduction, in which the National\r\nAssembly \"_en présence et sous les auspices de l'Être supréme_\" solemnly\r\nproclaims the recognition and declaration of the rights of man and of\r\ncitizens, and also sets forth the significance of the same, is inspired\r\nby the declaration of Congress and by those of many of the individual\r\nstates with which the Americans sought to justify their separation from\r\nthe mother country.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Connecticut in 1818, and Rhode Island first in 1842, put\r\nnew constitutions in the place of the old Colonial Charters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Poore, II, pp. 1908, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: On the origin of Virginia's bill of rights, _cf._\r\nBancroft, _History of the United States_, London, 1861, VII, chap. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Virginia's declaration has 16, that of Massachusetts 30,\r\nand Maryland's 42 articles.

Les\r\ndistinctions sociales ne peuvent être fondées que sur l'utilité\r\ncommune._\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Le but de toute association politique est la conservation des droits\r\nnaturels et imprescriptibles de l'homme. Ces droits sont la liberté, la\r\npropriété, la sûreté et la résistance à l'oppression._\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA, I. That all men are by nature equally free and independent,\r\nand have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state\r\nof society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their\r\nposterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of\r\nacquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness\r\nand safety.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA, IV. That no man, or set of men, are entitled to exclusive or\r\nseparate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in\r\nconsideration of public services.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, Preamble to the Constitution. The end of the institution,\r\nmaintenance, and administration of government is to secure the existence\r\nof the body-politic, to protect it, and to furnish the individuals who\r\ncompose it with the power of enjoying, in safety and tranquillity, their\r\nnatural rights and the blessings of life.\r\n\r\nMARYLAND, IV. The doctrine of non-resistance, against arbitrary power\r\nand oppression, is absurd, slavish and destructive of the good and\r\nhappiness of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Le principe de toute souveraineté réside essentiellement dans la\r\nnation. Nul corps, nul individu ne peut exercer d'autorité qui n'en\r\némane expréssement._\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA, II. That all power is vested in, and consequently derived\r\nfrom, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and\r\nat all times amenable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _La liberté consiste à pouvoir faire tout ce qui ne nuit pas à\r\nautrui; aussi l'exercise des droits naturels de chaque homme n'a de\r\nbornes que celles qui assurent aux autres membres de la société la\r\njouissance de ces mêmes droits. Ces bornes ne peuvent être déterminées\r\nque par la loi._\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, Preamble. The body-politic is formed by a voluntary\r\nassociation of individuals; it is a social compact by which the whole\r\npeople covenants with each citizen and each citizen with the whole\r\npeople that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, X. Each individual of the society has a right to be\r\nprotected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property,\r\naccording to standing laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _La loi n'a le droit de défendre que les actions nuisibles à la\r\nsociété. Tout ce qui n'est pas défendu par la loi ne peut être empêché\r\net nul ne peut être contraint à faire ce qu'elle n'ordonne pas._\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, XI. Every subject of the commonwealth ought to find a\r\ncertain remedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries or\r\nwrongs which he may receive in his person, property, or character.\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA, XIII. That every freeman, restrained of his liberty, is\r\nentitled to a remedy, to inquire into the lawfulness thereof, and to\r\nremove the same, if unlawful; and that such remedy ought not to be\r\ndenied or delayed.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA, VII. That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of\r\nlaws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives of the\r\npeople, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _La loi est l'expression de la volonté générale. Tous les citoyens\r\nont le droit de concourir personnellement ou par leurs représentants à\r\nsa formation. Elle doit être la même pour tous, soit qu'elle protège,\r\nsoit qu'elle punisse. Tous les citoyens étant égaux à ses yeux, sont\r\négalement admissibles à toutes dignités, places et emplois publics,\r\nselon leur capacité, et sans autre distinction que celle de leurs vertus\r\net leurs talents._\r\n\r\nMARYLAND, V. That the right in the people to participate in the\r\nLegislature, is the best security of liberty, and the foundation of all\r\nfree government.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, IX. All elections ought to be free;[41] and all the\r\ninhabitants of this commonwealth, having such qualifications as they\r\nshall establish by their frame of government, have an equal right to\r\nelect officers, and to be elected, for public employments.\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE, XII. Nor are the inhabitants of this State controllable\r\nby any other laws than those to which they or their representative body\r\nhave given their consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Nul homme ne peut être accusé, arrêté, ni détenu que dans les cas\r\ndéterminés par la loi et selon les formes qu'elle a prescrites. Ceux qui\r\nsollicitent, expédient, exécutent ou font exécuter des ordres\r\narbitraires, doivent être punis; mais tout citoyen appelé ou saisi en\r\nvertu de la loi doit obéir à l'instant; il se rend coupable par sa\r\nrésistance._\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, XII. No subject shall be held to answer for any crimes\r\nor no offence until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and\r\nformally, described to him; or be compelled to accuse, or furnish\r\nevidence against himself; and every subject shall have a right to\r\nproduce all proofs that may be favorable to him; to meet the witnesses\r\nagainst him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by\r\nhimself, or his counsel at his election. And no subject shall be\r\narrested, imprisoned, despoiled, or deprived of his property,\r\nimmunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled\r\nor deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his\r\npeers, or the law of the land.[42]\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA, X. That general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may\r\nbe commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact\r\ncommitted, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offence\r\nis not particularly described and supported by evidence, are grievous\r\nand oppressive, and ought not to be granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _La loi ne doit établir que des peines strictement nécessaires et nul\r\nne peut être puni qu'en vertu d'une loi établie et promulguée\r\nantérieurement au délit et légalement appliquée._\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE, XVIII. All penalties ought to be proportioned to the\r\nnature of the offence.[43]\r\n\r\nMARYLAND, XIV. That sanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is\r\nconsistent with the safety of the State; and no law, to inflict cruel\r\nand unusual pains and penalties, ought to be made in any case, or at any\r\ntime hereafter.[44]\r\n\r\nMARYLAND, XV. That retrospective laws, punishing facts committed before\r\nthe existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are\r\noppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no _ex post\r\nfacto_ law ought to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Tout homme étant présumé innocent jusqu' à ce qu'il ait été déclaré\r\ncoupable, s'il est jugé indispensable de l'arrêter, toute rigueur qui ne\r\nserait pas nécessaire pour s'assurer de sa personne doit être sévèrement\r\nréprimée par la loi._\r\n\r\n_Cf._ above, MASSACHUSETTS, XII; further\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, XIV. Every subject has a right to be secure from all\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his\r\npapers, and all his possessions.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, XXVI. No magistrate or court of law shall demand\r\nexcessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines[45] ...\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Nul doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, même religieuses, pourvu\r\nque leur manifestation ne trouble pas l'ordre public établi par la loi._\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE, V. Every individual has a natural and unalienable right\r\nto worship GOD according to the dictates of his own conscience, and\r\nreason; and no subject shall be hurt, molested or restrained in his\r\nperson, liberty or estate for worshipping GOD, in the manner and season\r\nmost agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience, or for his\r\nreligious profession, sentiments or persuasion; provided he doth not\r\ndisturb the public peace, or disturb others, in their religious worship.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _La libre communication des pensées et des opinions est un des\r\ndroits les plus précieux de l'homme; tout citoyen peut donc parler,\r\nécrire, imprimer librement sauf à répondre de l'abus de cette liberté\r\ndans les cas determinés par la loi._\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA, XII. That the freedom of the press is one of the great\r\nbulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA, XII. That the people have a right to freedom of speech,\r\nand of writing, and publishing their sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _La garantie des droits de l'homme et du citoyen nécessité une force\r\npublique. Cette force est donc instituée pour l'avantage de tous, et non\r\npour l'utilité particulière de ceux auxquels elle est confiée._\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA, V. That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the\r\ncommon benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or\r\ncommunity; and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any\r\nsingle man, family, or sett of men, who are a part only of that\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Pour l'entretien de la force publique et pour les dépenses\r\nd'administration, une contribution commune est indispensable; elle doit\r\nêtre également répartie entre tous les citoyens en raison de leurs\r\nfacultés._\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, X. Each individual of the society has a right to be\r\nprotected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property,\r\naccording to standing laws. He is obliged, consequently, to contribute\r\nhis share to the expense of this protection; to give his personal\r\nservice, or an equivalent, when necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _Tous les citoyens ont le droit de constater, par eux mêmes ou par\r\nleur représentants, la nécessité de la contribution publique, de la\r\nconsentir librement, d'en suivre l'emploi, et d'en déterminer la\r\nqualité, l'assiette, le recouvrement et la durée._\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, XXIII. No subsidy, charge, tax, impost, or duties, ought\r\nto be established, fixed, laid or levied, under any pretext whatsoever,\r\nwithout the consent of the people, or their representatives in the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _La société a le droit de demander compte à tout agent public de son\r\nadministration._\r\n\r\nSee above, VIRGINIA, II; further\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS V. All power residing originally in the people, and being\r\nderived from them, the several magistrates and officers of government\r\nvested with authority, whether legislative, executive, or judicial, are\r\nthe substitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. _Toute société, dans laquelle la garantie des droits n'est pas\r\nassurée, ni la séparation des pouvoirs déterminée, n'a point de\r\nconstitution._\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE, III. When men enter into a state of society, they\r\nsurrender up some of their natural rights to that society, in order to\r\ninsure the protection of others; and without such an equivalent, the\r\nsurrender is void.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, XXX. In the government of this commonwealth, the\r\nlegislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial\r\npowers, or either of them; the executive shall never exercise the\r\nlegislative and judicial powers, or either of them; the judicial shall\r\nnever exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them;\r\nto the end it may be a government of laws, and not of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. _La propriété étant un droit inviolable et sacré, nul ne peut en\r\nêtre privé, si ce n'est lors que la nécessité publique, légalement\r\nconstatée, l'exige évidemment, et sous la condition d'une juste et\r\npréalable indemnité._\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, X. ... But no part of the property of any individual can,\r\nwith justice, be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his\r\nown consent, or that of the representative body of the people.... And\r\nwhenever the public exigencies require that the property of any\r\nindividual should be appropriated to public uses, he shall receive a\r\nreasonable compensation therefor.\r\n\r\nVERMONT, II. That private property ought to be subservient to public\r\nuses, when necessity requires it; nevertheless, whenever any particular\r\nman's property is taken for the use of the public, the owner ought to\r\nreceive an equivalent in money.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Cf._ English Bill of Rights, 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: English Bill of Rights, 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Magna Charta, 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Magna Charta, 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: English Bill of Rights, 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: English Bill of Rights, 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE AMERICAN AND ENGLISH DECLARATIONS OF RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the American and French declarations shows at once\r\nthat the setting forth of principles abstract, and therefore ambiguous,\r\nis common to both, as is also the pathos with which they are recited.\r\nThe French have not only adopted the American ideas, but even the form\r\nthey received on the other side of the ocean. But in contrast to the\r\ndiffuseness of the Americans the French are distinguished by a brevity\r\ncharacteristic of their language. Articles 4-6 of the Declaration have\r\nthe most specific French additions in the superfluous and meaningless\r\ndefinitions of liberty[46] and law. Further, in Articles 4, 6 and 13 of\r\nthe French text special stress is laid upon equality before the law,\r\nwhile to the Americans, because of their social conditions and\r\ndemocratic institutions, this seemed self-evident and so by them is only\r\nbrought out incidentally. In the French articles the influence of the\r\n_Contrat Social_ will have been recognized; but yet it brought out\r\nnothing essentially new, or unknown to the American stipulations.\r\n\r\nThe result that has been won is not without significance for the student\r\nof history in passing judgment upon the effects of the French\r\nDeclaration. The American states have developed with their bills of\r\nrights into orderly commonwealths in which there has never been any\r\ncomplaint that these propositions brought consequences disintegrating to\r\nthe state. The disorders which arose in France after the Declaration of\r\nthe Rights of Man cannot therefore have been brought about by its\r\nformulas alone. Much rather do they show what dangers may lie in the too\r\nhasty adoption of foreign institutions. That is, the Americans in 1776\r\nwent on building upon foundations that were with them long-standing. The\r\nFrench, on the other hand, tore up all the foundations of their state's\r\nstructure. What was in the one case a factor in the process of\r\nconsolidation served in the other as a cause of further disturbance.\r\nThis was even recognized at the time by sharp-sighted men, such as\r\nLally-Tollendal[47] and, above all, Mirabeau.[48]\r\n\r\nBut from the consideration of the American bills of rights there arises\r\na new problem for the historian of law: How did Americans come to make\r\nlegislative declarations of this sort?\r\n\r\nTo the superficial observer the answer seems simple. The very name\r\npoints to English sources. The Bill of Rights of 1689, the Habeas Corpus\r\nAct of 1679, the Petition of Right of 1628, and finally the _Magna\r\nCharta libertatum_ appear to be unquestionably the predecessors of the\r\nVirginia bill of rights.\r\n\r\nAssuredly the remembrance of these celebrated English enactments, which\r\nthe Americans regarded as an inherent part of the law of their land, had\r\na substantial share in the declarations of rights after 1776. Many\r\nstipulations from Magna Charta and the English Bill of Rights were\r\ndirectly embodied by the Americans in their lists.\r\n\r\nAnd yet a deep cleft separates the American declarations from the\r\nEnglish enactments that have been mentioned. The historian of the\r\nAmerican Revolution says of the Virginia declaration that it protested\r\nagainst all tyranny in the name of the eternal laws of man's being: \"The\r\nEnglish petition of right in 1688 was historic and retrospective; the\r\nVirginia declaration came directly out of the heart of nature and\r\nannounced governing principles for all peoples in all future times.\"[49]\r\n\r\nThe English laws that establish the rights of subjects are collectively\r\nand individually confirmations, arising out of special conditions, or\r\ninterpretations of existing law. Even Magna Charta contains no new\r\nright, as Sir Edward Coke, the great authority on English law, perceived\r\nas early as the beginning of the seventeenth century.[50] The English\r\nstatutes are far removed from any purpose to recognize general rights of\r\nman, and they have neither the power nor the intention to restrict the\r\nlegislative agents or to establish principles for future legislation.\r\nAccording to English law Parliament is omnipotent and all statutes\r\nenacted or confirmed by it are of equal value.\r\n\r\nThe American declarations, on the other hand, contain precepts which\r\nstand higher than the ordinary lawmaker. In the Union, as well as in the\r\nindividual states, there are separate organs for ordinary and for\r\nconstitutional legislation, and the judge watches over the observance of\r\nthe constitutional limitations by the ordinary legislative power. If in\r\nhis judgment a law infringes on the fundamental rights, he must forbid\r\nits enforcement. The declarations of rights even at the present day are\r\ninterpreted by the Americans as practical protections of the\r\nminority.[51] This distinguishes them from the \"guaranteed rights\" of\r\nthe European states. The American declarations are not laws of a higher\r\nkind in name only, they are the creations of a higher lawmaker. In\r\nEurope, it is true, the constitutions place formal difficulties in the\r\nway of changing their specifications, but almost everywhere it is the\r\nlawmaker himself who decides upon the change. Even in the Swiss\r\nConfederacy judicial control over the observance of these forms is\r\nnowhere to be found, although there, as in the United States, the\r\nconstitutional laws proceed from other organs than those of the ordinary\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\nThe American bills of rights do not attempt merely to set forth certain\r\nprinciples for the state's organization, but they seek above all to draw\r\nthe boundary line between state and individual. According to them the\r\nindividual is not the possessor of rights through the state, but by his\r\nown nature he has inalienable and indefeasible rights. The English laws\r\nknow nothing of this. They do not wish to recognize an eternal, natural\r\nright, but one inherited from their fathers, \"the old, undoubted rights\r\nof the English people.\"\r\n\r\nThe English conception of the rights of the subject is very clear upon\r\nthis point. When one looks through the Bill of Rights carefully, one\r\nfinds but slight mention there of individual rights. That laws should\r\nnot be suspended, that there should be no dispensation from them, that\r\nspecial courts should not be erected, that cruel punishments should not\r\nbe inflicted, that jurors ought to be duly impanelled and returned, that\r\ntaxes should not be levied without a law, nor a standing army kept\r\nwithout consent of Parliament, that parliamentary elections should be\r\nfree, and Parliament be held frequently--all these are not rights of the\r\nindividual, but duties of the government. Of the thirteen articles of\r\nthe Bill of Rights only two contain stipulations that are expressed in\r\nthe form of rights of the subject,[52] while one refers to freedom of\r\nspeech in Parliament. When nevertheless all the stipulations of the Bill\r\nof Rights are therein designated as rights and liberties of the English\r\npeople,[53] it is through the belief that restriction of the crown is\r\nat the same time right of the people.\r\n\r\nThis view grew directly out of the mediæval conception of the Teutonic\r\nstate. While the ancient state appears at the beginning of its history\r\nas [Greek: polis] or _civitas_, as an undivided community of citizens,\r\nthe monarchical Teutonic state is from the beginning dualistic in\r\nform,--prince and people form no integral unity, but stand opposed to\r\neach other as independent factors. And so the state in the conception of\r\nthe time is substantially a relation of contract between the two. The\r\nRoman and Canonical theory of law under the influence of ancient\r\ntraditions even as early as the eleventh century attempts to unite the\r\ntwo elements in that, upon the basis of a contract, it either makes the\r\npeople part with their rights to the prince, and accordingly makes the\r\ngovernment the state, or it considers the prince simply as the\r\nauthorized agent of the people and so makes the latter and the state\r\nidentical. The prevailing opinion in public law, however, especially\r\nsince the rise of the state of estates, sees in the state a double\r\ncondition of contract between prince and people. The laws form the\r\ncontent of this compact. They established, therefore, for the prince a\r\nright of demanding lawful obedience, and for the people of demanding\r\nadherence to the limitations placed by the laws. The people accordingly\r\nhave a right to the fulfilment of the law by the prince. Thus all laws\r\ncreate personal rights of the people, and the term people is thought of\r\nin a confused way as referring to the individuals as well as to the\r\nwhole--_singuli et universi_.[54] From this point of view it is a right\r\nof the people that Parliament should be frequently summoned, that the\r\njudge should inflict no cruel punishments, and however else the\r\ndeclarations of the English charters may read.\r\n\r\nThis conception of law as two-sided, establishing rights for both\r\nelements of the state, runs through all the earlier English history. The\r\nright which is conferred by law passes from generation to generation, it\r\nbecomes hereditary and therefore acquirable by birth as one of the\r\npeople. Under Henry VI. it is declared of the law: \"La ley est le plus\r\nhaute inheritance que le roy ad; car par la ley il même et toutes ses\r\nsujets sont rulés, et si la ley ne fuit, nul roy et nul inheritance\r\nsera.\"[55] And in the Petition of Right Parliament makes the appeal that\r\nthe subjects have inherited their freedom through the laws.[56] The\r\nlaws, as the Act of Settlement expresses it, are the \"birthright of the\r\npeople\".[57]\r\n\r\nAnd so we find only ancient \"rights and liberties\" mentioned in the\r\nEnglish laws of the seventeenth century. Parliament is always demanding\r\nsimply the confirmation of the \"laws and statutes of this realm\", that\r\nis, the strengthening of the existing relations between king and people.\r\nOf the creation of new rights there is not a word in all these\r\ndocuments. Consequently there is no reference whatever to the important\r\nfundamental rights of religious liberty, of assembling, of liberty of\r\nthe press, or of free movement. And down to the present day the theory\r\nof English law does not recognize rights of this kind, but considers\r\nthese lines of individual liberty as protected by the general principle\r\nof law, that any restraint of the person can only come about through\r\nlegal authorization.[58] According to the present English idea the\r\nrights of liberty rest simply upon the supremacy of the law,--they are\r\nlaw, not personal rights.[59] The theory, founded in Germany by Gerber,\r\nand defended by Laband and others, according to which the rights of\r\nliberty are nothing but duties of the government, sprang up in England,\r\nwithout any connection with the German teaching, from the existing\r\nconditions after the conception of the public rights of the individual\r\nas natural rights, which was based on Locke and Blackstone, had lost its\r\npower.\r\n\r\nBut with Locke even this conception stands in close connection with the\r\nold English ideas. When Locke considers property--in which are included\r\nlife and liberty--as an original right of the individual existing\r\nprevious to the state, and when he conceives of the state as a society\r\nfounded to protect this right, which is thus transformed from a natural\r\nto a civil right, he by no means ascribes definite fundamental rights to\r\nthe man living in the state, but rather places such positive\r\nrestrictions upon the legislative power as follow from the purposes of\r\nthe state.[60] When closely examined, however, these restrictions are\r\nnothing else than the most important stipulations of the Bill of Rights,\r\nwhich was enacted the year before the _Two Treatises on Government_\r\nappeared.[61]\r\n\r\nBlackstone was the first (1765) to found his doctrine of the absolute\r\nrights of persons upon the idea of the personal rights of the\r\nindividual. Security, liberty, and property are the absolute rights of\r\nevery Englishman, which from their character are nothing else than the\r\nnatural liberty that remains to the individual after deducting the legal\r\nrestraints demanded by the common interest.[62] Laws appear likewise as\r\nprotectors of these rights,--the whole constitution of Parliament, the\r\nlimitation of the royal prerogative, and along with these the protection\r\nof the law courts, the right of petition, and the right to carry arms\r\nare treated, exactly in the manner of the Bill of Rights, as rights of\r\nEnglishmen, and indeed as subordinate rights to assist in guarding the\r\nthree principal rights.[63] But in spite of his fundamental conception\r\nof a natural right, the individual with rights was for Blackstone not\r\nman simply, but the English subject.[64]\r\n\r\nThe American declarations of rights, on the other hand, begin with the\r\nstatement that all men are born free and equal, and these declarations\r\nspeak of rights that belong to \"every individual\", \"all mankind\" or\r\n\"every member of society\". They enumerate a much larger number of rights\r\nthan the English declarations, and look upon these rights as innate and\r\ninalienable. Whence comes this conception in American law?\r\n\r\nIt is not from the English law. There is then nothing else from which to\r\nderive it than the conceptions of natural rights of that time. But there\r\nhave been theories of natural rights ever since the time of the Greeks,\r\nand they never led to the formulation of fundamental rights. The theory\r\nof natural rights for a long time had no hesitation in setting forth the\r\ncontradiction between natural law and positive law without demanding\r\nthe realization of the former through the latter. A passage from Ulpian\r\nis drawn upon in the _Digests_, which declares all men to be equal\r\naccording to the law of nature, but slavery to be an institution of the\r\ncivil law.[65] The Romans, however, in spite of all mitigation of slave\r\nlaws, never thought of such a thing as the abolition of slavery. The\r\nnatural freedom of man was set forth by many writers during the\r\neighteenth century as compatible with lawful servitude. Even Locke, for\r\nwhom liberty forms the very essence of man, in his constitution for\r\nNorth Carolina sanctioned slavery and servitude.\r\n\r\nLiterature alone never produces anything, unless it finds in the\r\nhistorical and social conditions ground ready for its working. When one\r\nshows the literary origin of an idea, one has by no means therewith\r\ndiscovered the record of its practical significance. The history of\r\npolitical science to-day is entirely too much a history of the\r\nliterature and too little a history of the institutions themselves. The\r\nnumber of new political ideas is very small; the most, at least in\r\nembryo, were known to the ancient theories of the state. But the\r\ninstitutions are found in constant change and must be seized in their\r\nown peculiar historical forms.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: It harks back finally to the old definition of Florentinus\r\nL. 4 D. 1, 5: \"Libertas est naturalis facultas eius, quod cuique facere\r\nlibet, nisi si quid vi aut jure prohibetur.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Arch. parl._ VIII, p. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Ibid._, pp. 438 and 453.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Bancroft, VII, p. 243.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Cf._ Blackstone, _Commentaries on the Laws of England_,\r\nI, 1, p. 127.

They declared the Church, which was identical with the\r\nparish, to be a community of believers who had placed themselves under\r\nobedience to Christ by a compact with God, and they steadfastly\r\nrecognized as authoritative only the will of the community at the time\r\nbeing, that is, the will of the majority.[66] Persecuted in England\r\nBrownism transformed itself on Dutch soil, especially through the\r\nagency of John Robinson, into Congregationalism, in which the earliest\r\nform of the Independent movement made its appearance. The principles of\r\nCongregationalism are first complete separation of Church and State and\r\nthen the autonomy of each separate parish,--as a petition addressed to\r\nJames I. in 1616 expresses it: the right is exercised \"of spiritual\r\nadministration and government in itself and over itself by the common\r\nand free consent of the people, independently and immediately under\r\nChrist.\"[67]\r\n\r\nThis sovereign individualism in the religious sphere led to practical\r\nconsequences of extraordinary importance. From its principles there\r\nfinally resulted the demand for, and the recognition of, full and\r\nunrestricted liberty of conscience, and then the asserting of this\r\nliberty to be a right not granted by any earthly power and therefore by\r\nno earthly power to be restrained.\r\n\r\nBut the Independent movement could not confine itself to ecclesiastical\r\nmatters, it was forced by logical necessity to carry its fundamental\r\ndoctrines into the political sphere. As the Church, so it considered\r\nthe state and every political association as the result of a compact\r\nbetween its original sovereign members.[68] This compact was made indeed\r\nin pursuance of divine commandment, but it remained always the ultimate\r\nlegal basis of the community. It was concluded by virtue of the\r\nindividual's original right and had not only to insure security and\r\nadvance the general welfare, but above all to recognize and protect the\r\ninnate and inalienable rights of conscience. And it is the entire people\r\nthat specifically man for man concluded this compact, for by it alone\r\ncould every one be bound to respect the self-created authority and the\r\nself-created law.\r\n\r\nThe first indications of these religious-political ideas can be traced\r\nfar back, for they were not created by the Reformation. But the\r\npractice which developed on the basis of these ideas was something\r\nunique. For the first time in history social compacts, by which states\r\nare founded, were not merely demanded, they were actually concluded.\r\nWhat had until then slumbered in the dust-covered manuscripts of the\r\nscholar became a powerful, life-determining movement. The men of that\r\ntime believed that the state rested upon a contract, and they put their\r\nbelief into practice. More recent theory of public law with only an\r\nimperfect knowledge of these events frequently employed them as examples\r\nof the possibility of founding a state by contract, without suspecting\r\nthat these contracts were only the realization of an abstract theory.\r\n\r\nOn October 28, 1647, there was laid before the assembled Council of\r\nCromwell's army a draft, worked out by the Levellers, of a new\r\nconstitution for England,[69] which later, greatly enlarged and\r\nmodified,[70] was delivered to Parliament with the request that it be\r\nlaid before the entire English people for signature.[71] In this\r\nremarkable document the power of Parliament was set forth as limited in\r\na manner similar to that later adopted by the Americans, and particulars\r\nwere enumerated which in future should not lie within the legislative\r\npower of the people's representatives. The first thing named was matters\r\nof religion, which were to be committed exclusively to the command of\r\nconscience.[72] They were reckoned among the inherent rights, the\r\n\"native rights\", which the people were firmly resolved to maintain with\r\ntheir utmost strength against all attacks.[73]\r\n\r\nHere for the first and last time in England was an inherent right of\r\nreligious liberty asserted in a proposed law. This right is recognized\r\nto-day in England in legal practice, but not in any expressly formulated\r\nprinciple.[74]\r\n\r\nThe religious conditions in England's North American colonies developed\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nThe compact is celebrated which the persecuted and exiled Pilgrim\r\nFathers concluded on board the Mayflower, November 11, 1620, before the\r\nfounding of New Plymouth. Forty-one men on that occasion signed an act\r\nin which, for the glory of God, the advancement of the Christian faith,\r\nand the honor of their king and country, they declare their purpose to\r\nfound a colony. They thereupon mutually promised one another to unite\r\nthemselves into a civil body politic, and, for the maintenance of good\r\norder and accomplishment of their proposed object, to make laws, to\r\nappoint officers, and to subject themselves to these.[75]\r\n\r\nTherewith began the series of \"Plantation Covenants\" which the English\r\nsettlers, according to their ecclesiastical and political ideas,\r\nbelieved it necessary to make on founding a new colony. Here they are\r\nonly to be considered in their connection with religious liberty.\r\n\r\nIn 1629 Salem, the second colony in Massachusetts, was founded by\r\nPuritans. Unmindful of the persecutions they themselves had suffered in\r\ntheir native land, they turned impatiently against such as did not agree\r\nwith them in their religious ideas. Roger Williams, a young Independent,\r\nlanded in Massachusetts in 1631 and was at once chosen by the community\r\nin Salem to be its minister. But he preached complete separation of\r\nChurch and State, and demanded absolute religious liberty, not only for\r\nall Christians but also for Jews, Turks, and heathen. They should have\r\nin the state equal civil and political rights with believers. A man's\r\nconscience belongs exclusively to him, and not to the state.[76] Exiled\r\nand in danger, Williams forsook Salem and with a faithful few founded,\r\n1636, the city of Providence in the country of the Narragansett Indians,\r\nwhere all who were persecuted on account of their religion should find a\r\nrefuge. In the original compact the seceders promised obedience to laws\r\ndetermined by a majority of themselves, but \"only in civil\r\nthings\"--religion was to be in no way a subject of legislation.[77] Here\r\nfor the first time was recognized the most unrestricted liberty of\r\nreligious conviction, and that by a man who was himself glowing with\r\nreligious feeling.\r\n\r\nNineteen settlers from Providence in 1638 founded Aquedneck, the second\r\ncolony in the present state of Rhode Island, after having concluded a\r\nmost remarkable compact: \"We whose names are underwritten do here\r\nsolemnly, in the presence of Jehovah, incorporate ourselves into a Bodie\r\nPolitik, and as he shall help, will submit our persons, lives and\r\nestates unto our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords,\r\nand to all those perfect and absolute laws of his given us in his holy\r\nword of truth, to be guided and judged hereby.--Exod. xxiv, 3, 4; 2\r\nChron. xi, 3; 2 Kings xi, 17.\"[78]\r\n\r\nBut such as did not go so far as Roger Williams in the recognition of\r\nliberty of conscience were yet dominated by the idea of the necessity of\r\na social compact in founding a new colony. In the Fundamental Orders of\r\nConnecticut, a colony founded by Puritans who also had emigrated from\r\nMassachusetts, the settlers in 1638 declared that they united themselves\r\nin a body politic in pursuance of the word of God in order to guard the\r\nliberty of the Gospel and the church discipline to which they were\r\naccustomed, and in order also in civil affairs to be ruled according to\r\nthe laws.[79] In the opposition in which they stood to the religious\r\nconditions in England, the Puritans, although themselves little inclined\r\nto toleration, proceeded invariably upon the idea that their state had\r\nfirst of all to realize religious liberty, which was for them the free\r\nexercise of their own religious convictions.\r\n\r\nThe idea that state and government rested upon a compact--so significant\r\nfor the development of the American conceptions of individual\r\nliberty--was strengthened by the force of historical circumstances. A\r\nhandful of men went forth to found new communities. They began their\r\nwork of civilization scattered over wide stretches in the loneliness of\r\nthe primeval forest.[80] And so they believed that it was possible to\r\nlive outside of the state, in a condition of nature, and that when they\r\nstepped out of that condition of nature they did it of their own free\r\nwill and were not constrained by any earthly power. With their small\r\nnumbers, representation was at first unnecessary, and the decisions were\r\nreached in the town meetings of all belonging to the community,--the\r\nform of a direct democracy grew naturally out of the given conditions\r\nand strengthened the conviction, which does not correspond to the old\r\nEnglish conception, that the sovereignty of the people is the basis of\r\nlegislation and of government. To a generation that could point to such\r\nbeginnings for their state, the political ideas which later animated\r\nthe men of 1776 seemed to bear their surety in themselves: they were\r\n\"self-evident\", as it reads in the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nThe inherent fundamental right of religious liberty, for which Roger\r\nWilliams had striven so earnestly, found also in the seventeenth century\r\nits official recognition in law, first in the laws of 1647 of Rhode\r\nIsland, and then in the charter which Charles II. granted the colony of\r\nRhode Island and Providence Plantations in 1663.[81] It was therein\r\nordered in fulfilment of the colonists' request, in a manner ever\r\nmemorable, that in future in the said colony no person should be\r\nmolested, punished or called in question for any differences of opinion\r\nin matters of religion; but that all persons at all times should have\r\nfull liberty of conscience, so long as they behaved themselves peaceably\r\nand did not misuse this liberty in licentiousness or profaneness, nor\r\nto the injury or disturbance of others.[82] Thus a colony was granted\r\nthat which in the mother-country at the time was contested to the\r\nutmost. Similar principles are found for the first time in Europe in the\r\nPractice of Frederick the Great in Prussia. But the principles of\r\nreligious liberty were recognized to a greater or less extent in other\r\ncolonies also. Catholic Maryland in 1649 granted freedom in the exercise\r\nof religion to every one who acknowledged Jesus Christ.[83] Also that\r\nremarkable constitution which Locke prepared for North Carolina and that\r\nwent into force there in 1669, and which agrees so little with the\r\ntenets of his _Two Treatises on Government_, is based upon the principle\r\nnot, it is true, of full equality of rights, but of toleration of\r\nDissenters, and also of Jews and heathen.[84] It was permitted every\r\nseven persons of any religion to form a church or communion of\r\nfaith.[85] No compulsion in matters of religion was exercised, except\r\nthat every inhabitant when seventeen years of age had to declare to\r\nwhich communion he belonged and to be registered in some church,\r\notherwise he stood outside of the protection of the law.[86] All\r\nviolence toward any religious assembly was strictly prohibited.[87] It\r\nwas not the principle of political liberty that lay on Locke's heart,\r\nbut the opening of a way to full religious liberty. In spite of the fact\r\nthat in his treatise _On Civil Government_ there is not a word upon the\r\nright of conscience, which he had so energetically defended in his\r\ncelebrated _Letters on Toleration_, the constitution of North Carolina\r\nshows that in his practical plans it held the first place. And so with\r\nLocke also liberty of conscience was brought forward as the first and\r\nmost sacred right, overshadowing all others. This philosopher, who held\r\nfreedom to be man's inalienable gift from nature, established servitude\r\nand slavery under the government he organized without hesitation, but\r\nreligious toleration he carried through with great energy in this new\r\nfeudal state.\r\n\r\nOf the other colonies New Jersey had proclaimed extensive toleration in\r\n1664, and New York in 1665.[88] In the latter, which had already\r\ndeclared under Dutch rule in favor of liberal principles in religious\r\nmatters, it was ordered in 1683 that no one who believed on Jesus Christ\r\nshould on any pretext whatever be molested because of difference of\r\nopinion. In the same year William Penn conferred a constitution with\r\ndemocratic basis upon the colony granted to him by the Crown and which\r\nhe had named after his father Pennsylvania, in which it was declared\r\nthat no one who believed on God should in any way be forced to take part\r\nin any religious worship or be otherwise molested,[89] and in the\r\nconstitution, which Penn later (1701) established and which remained in\r\nforce until 1776, he emphasized above all that even when a people were\r\nendowed with the greatest civil liberties they could not be truly happy,\r\nunless liberty of conscience were recognized,[90] and at the close he\r\nsolemnly promised for himself and his heirs that the recognition of this\r\nliberty, which he had declared, should remain forever inviolable and\r\nthat the wording of the article should not be changed in any\r\nparticular.[91] The constitutional principle was thus given at once the\r\nforce of a _lex in perpetuum valitura_.\r\n\r\nIn 1692 Massachusetts received a charter from William III. in which,\r\nfollowing the example of the Toleration Act of 1689, full liberty was\r\ngranted to all Christians except Catholics;[92] and Georgia was given a\r\nsimilar law in 1732 by George II.[93]\r\n\r\nThus the principles of religious liberty to a greater or less extent\r\nacquired constitutional recognition in America. In the closest\r\nconnection with the great religious political movement out of which the\r\nAmerican democracy was born, there arose the conviction that there\r\nexists a right not conferred upon the citizen but inherent in man, that\r\nacts of conscience and expressions of religious conviction stand\r\ninviolable over against the state as the exercise of a higher right.\r\nThis right so long suppressed is no \"inheritance\", is nothing handed\r\ndown from their fathers, as the rights and liberties of Magna Charta and\r\nof the other English enactments,--not the State but the Gospel\r\nproclaimed it.\r\n\r\nWhat in Europe at that time and even much later had received official\r\nexpression only in scanty rudiments,[94] and aside from that was only\r\nasserted in the literature of the great intellectual movement which\r\nbegan in the seventeenth century and reached its height in the\r\nclearing-up epoch of the century following, was in Rhode Island and\r\nother colonies a recognized principle of the state by the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century. The right of the liberty of conscience was\r\nproclaimed, and with it came the conception of a universal right of\r\nman. In 1776 this right was designated by all the bills of rights,\r\nmostly in emphatic form and with precedence over all others, as a\r\nnatural and inherent right.[95]\r\n\r\nThe character of this right is emphasized by the bill of rights of New\r\nHampshire, which declares that among the natural rights some are\r\ninalienable because no one can offer an equivalent for them. Such are\r\nthe rights of conscience.[96]\r\n\r\nThe idea of legally establishing inalienable, inherent and sacred rights\r\nof the individual is not of political but religious origin. What has\r\nbeen held to be a work of the Revolution was in reality a fruit of the\r\nReformation and its struggles. Its first apostle was not Lafayette but\r\nRoger Williams, who, driven by powerful and deep religious enthusiasm,\r\nwent into the wilderness in order to found a government of religious\r\nliberty, and his name is uttered by Americans even to-day with the\r\ndeepest respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Weingarten, _Die Revolutionskirchen Englands_, p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Ibid._, p. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: The connection of the Puritan-Independent doctrine of the\r\nstate-compact with the Puritan idea of church covenants is brought out\r\nby Borgeaud, p. 9.

In the\r\nfollowing century political and economic interests pressed into the\r\nforeground of historical movement. The democratic institutions of the\r\ncolonies were repeatedly in opposition to those of the mother-country,\r\nand the ties that bound them to her lost more and more of their\r\nsignificance. The great antagonism of their economic interests began to\r\nmake itself widely felt. The economic prosperity of the colonies\r\ndemanded the least possible restriction upon free movement. Finally they\r\nfelt that they were ruled not by their old home but by a foreign\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThen the old Puritan and Independent conceptions became effective in a\r\nnew direction. The theory of the social compact which played so\r\nimportant a rôle in the founding of the colonies, and had helped to\r\nestablish religious liberty, now supported in the most significant way\r\nthe reconstruction of existing institutions. Not that it changed these\r\ninstitutions, it simply gave them a new basis.\r\n\r\nThe colonists had brought over the ocean with them their liberties and\r\nrights as English-born subjects. In a series of charters from the\r\nEnglish kings it was specifically stated that the colonists and their\r\ndescendants should enjoy all the rights which belonged to Englishmen in\r\ntheir native land.[97] Even before the English Bill of Rights the most\r\nof the colonies had enacted laws in which the ancient English liberties\r\nwere gathered together.[98] There occurred, however, in the second half\r\nof the eighteenth century a great transformation in these old rights.\r\nThe inherited rights and liberties, as well as the privileges of\r\norganization, which had been granted the colonists by the English kings\r\nor had been sanctioned by the colonial lords, do not indeed change in\r\nword, but they become rights which spring not from man but from God and\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nTo these ancient rights new ones were added. With the conviction that\r\nthere existed a right of conscience independent of the State was found\r\nthe starting-point for the determination of the inalienable rights of\r\nthe individual. The theory of a Law of Nature recognized generally but\r\none natural right of the individual--liberty or property. In the\r\nconceptions of the Americans, however, in the eighteenth century there\r\nappears a whole series of such rights.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Locke, the theories of Pufendorf[99] and the ideas of\r\nMontesquieu, all powerfully influenced the political views of the\r\nAmericans of that time. But the setting forth of a complete series of\r\nuniversal rights of man and of citizens can in no way be explained\r\nthrough their influence alone.\r\n\r\nIn 1764 there appeared in Boston the celebrated pamphlet of James Otis\r\nupon _The Rights of the British Colonies_. In it was brought forward the\r\nidea that the political and civil rights of the English colonists in no\r\nway rested upon a grant from the crown; even Magna Charta, old as it\r\nmight be, was not the beginning of all things. \"A time may come when\r\nParliament shall declare every American charter void; but the natural,\r\ninherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens\r\nwould remain, and, whatever became of charters, can never be abolished\r\ntill the general conflagration.\"[100]\r\n\r\nIn this pamphlet definite limitations of the legislative power \"which\r\nhave been established by God and by Nature\" are already enumerated in\r\nthe form of the later bills of rights. As the center of the whole stood\r\nthe principal occasion of strife between the colonies and the\r\nmother-country, the right of taxation. That the levying of taxes or\r\nduties without the consent of the people or of representatives of the\r\ncolonies was not indeed contrary to the laws of the country, but\r\ncontrary to the eternal laws of liberty.[101] But these limitations were\r\nnone other than those enumerated by Locke, which \"the law of God and of\r\nNature has set for every legislative power in every state and in every\r\nform of government\".\r\n\r\nBut these propositions of Locke's are here found in a very radical\r\ntransformation. They are changing namely from law to personal right.\r\nWhile Locke, similar to Rousseau later, places the individuals in\r\nsubjection to the will of the majority of the community, upon which,\r\nhowever, restrictions are placed by the objects of the state, now the\r\nindividual establishes the conditions under which he will enter the\r\ncommunity, and in the state holds fast to these conditions as rights. He\r\nhas accordingly rights in the state and claims upon the state which do\r\nnot spring from the state. In opposition to England's attempt to\r\nrestrict these rights, the idea formally to declare them and to defend\r\nthem grew all the stronger.\r\n\r\nThis formulation was influenced by a work that was published anonymously\r\nat Oxford in 1754, in which for the first time \"absolute rights\" of the\r\nEnglish are mentioned.[102] It originated from no less a person than\r\nBlackstone.[103] These rights of the individual were voiced in\r\nBlackstone's words for the first time in a Memorial to the legislature,\r\nwhich is given in an appendix to Otis's pamphlet.[104] On November 20,\r\n1772, upon the motion of Samuel Adams a plan, which he had worked out,\r\nof a declaration of rights of the colonists as men, Christians and\r\ncitizens was adopted by all the assembled citizens of Boston. It was\r\ntherein declared, with an appeal to Locke, that men enter into the state\r\nby voluntary agreement, and they have the right beforehand in an\r\nequitable compact to establish conditions and limitations for the state\r\nand to see to it that these are carried out. Thereupon the colonists\r\ndemanded as men the right of liberty and of property, as Christians\r\nfreedom of religion, and as citizens the rights of Magna Charta and of\r\nthe Bill of Rights of 1689.[105]\r\n\r\nFinally, on October 14, 1774, the Congress, representing twelve\r\ncolonies, assembled in Philadelphia adopted a declaration of rights,\r\naccording to which the inhabitants of the North American Colonies have\r\nrights which belong to them by the unchangeable law of nature, by the\r\nprinciples of the constitution of England and by their own\r\nconstitutions.[106]\r\n\r\nFrom that to the declaration of rights by Virginia is apparently only a\r\nstep, and yet there is a world-wide difference between the two\r\ndocuments. The declaration of Philadelphia is a protest, that of\r\nVirginia a law. The appeal to England's law has disappeared. The state\r\nof Virginia solemnly recognizes rights pertaining to the present and\r\nfuture generations as the basis and foundation of government.[107]\r\n\r\nIn this and the following declarations of rights by the now sovereign\r\nstates of North America, by the side of the rights of liberty that had\r\nbeen thus far asserted,--liberty of person, of property and of\r\nconscience,--stand new ones, corresponding to the infringements most\r\nrecently suffered at England's hands of other lines of individual\r\nliberty: the right of assembly, the freedom of the press and free\r\nmovement. But these rights of liberty were not the only ones therein\r\nasserted, there were the right of petition, the demand for the\r\nprotection of law and the forms to be observed in insuring that, a\r\nspecial demand for trial by an independent jury, and in the same way\r\nwith regard to other acts of the state; and the foundations of the\r\ncitizen's political rights were also declared. They thus contained\r\naccording to the intentions of their authors the distinctive features of\r\nthe entire public right of the individual. Besides these were included\r\nthe principle of the division of powers, of rotation of office, of\r\naccountability of office-holders, of forbidding hereditary titles, and\r\nthere were further contained certain limitations on the legislature and\r\nexecutive, such as forbidding the keeping of a standing army or creating\r\nan established church,--all of which do not engender personal rights of\r\nthe individual at all, or do so only indirectly. The whole is based upon\r\nthe principle of the sovereignty of the people, and culminates in the\r\nconception of the entire constitution being an agreement of all\r\nconcerned. In this particular one sees clearly the old Puritan-Independent\r\nidea of the covenant in its lasting influence, of which new power was to\r\nbe significantly displayed later. When to-day in the separate states of\r\nthe Union changes in the constitution are enacted either by the people\r\nthemselves, or through a constitutional convention, there still lives in\r\nthis democratic institution the same idea that once animated the settlers\r\nof Connecticut and Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the bill of rights forms the first part of the constitution,\r\nfollowing which as second part comes the plan or frame of government.\r\nThe right of the creator of the state, the originally free and\r\nunrestricted individual, was first established, and then the right of\r\nthat which the individuals created, namely, the community.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the general accord of these fundamental principles, when it\r\ncame to carrying them out in practical legislation great differences\r\narose in the various states, and though these differences were afterward\r\ngreatly lessened they have not entirely disappeared even to-day. Thus,\r\nas mentioned above, religious liberty, in spite of its universal\r\nrecognition in the constitutions, was not everywhere nor at once carried\r\nout in all of its consequences. In spite of the assertion that all men\r\nare by nature free and equal the abolition of slavery was not then\r\naccomplished. In the slave states in place of \"man\" stood \"freeman\".\r\n\r\nThe rights thus formally declared belonged originally to all the\r\n\"inhabitants\", in the slave states to all the \"whites\". It was only\r\nlater that the qualification of citizenship of the United States was\r\nrequired in most of the states for the exercise of political rights.\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen by what a remarkable course of development there arose\r\nout of the English law, old and new, that was practised in the\r\ncolonies, the conception of a sphere of rights of the individual, which\r\nwas independent of the state, and by the latter was simply to be\r\nrecognized. In reality, however, the declarations of rights did nothing\r\nelse than express the existing condition of rights in definite universal\r\nformulas.\r\n\r\nThat which the Americans already enjoyed they wished to proclaim as a\r\nperpetual possession for themselves and for every free people. In\r\ncontrast to them the French wished to give that which they did not yet\r\nhave, namely, institutions to correspond to their universal principles.\r\nTherein lies the most significant difference between the American and\r\nFrench declarations of rights, that in the one case the institutions\r\npreceded the recognition of rights of the individual, in the other they\r\nfollowed after. Therein lay also the fatal mistake of the German\r\nNational Assembly at Frankfort which wished to determine first the\r\nrights of the individual and then establish the state. The German state\r\nwas not yet founded, but it was already settled what this state not yet\r\nexisting dare not do and what it had to concede. The Americans could\r\ncalmly precede their plan of government with a bill of rights, because\r\nthat government and the controlling laws had already long existed.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, has resulted from this investigation with\r\nirrefutable certainty. The principles of 1789 are in reality the\r\nprinciples of 1776.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Kent, _Commentaries on American Law_, 10th ed., I, p.\r\n611.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: _Cf._ Kent, I, pp. 612 _et seq._; Stevens, _loc. cit._,\r\npp. 208 _et seq._ They are universally designated to-day in America as\r\n\"bills of rights\".

Why is it that\r\nthe doctrine of an original right of the individual and of a state\r\ncompact, arising as far back as the time of the Sophists in the ancient\r\nworld, further developed in the mediæval theory of Natural Law, and\r\ncarried on by the currents of the Reformation,--why is it that this\r\ndoctrine advanced to epoch-making importance for the first time in\r\nEngland and her colonies? And in general, in a thoroughly monarchical\r\nstate, all of whose institutions are inwardly bound up with royalty and\r\nonly through royalty can be fully comprehended, how could republican\r\nideas press in and change the structure of the state so completely?\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause thereof lies clearly before us. The antagonism\r\nbetween the dynasty of the Stuarts, who came from a foreign land and\r\nrelied upon their divine right, and the English national conceptions of\r\nright, and also the religious wars with royalty in England and Scotland,\r\nseem to have sufficiently favored the spreading of doctrines which were\r\nable to arouse an energetic opposition. Yet similar conditions existed\r\nin many a Continental state from the end of the sixteenth to the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century. There, too, arose a strong opposition of the\r\nestates to royalty which was striving more and more towards absolutism,\r\nfearful religious wars broke out and an extensive literature sought with\r\ngreat energy to establish rights of the people and of the individual\r\nover against the rulers. The revolutionary ideas on the continent led it\r\nis true in France to regicide, but there was nowhere an attempt made at\r\na reconstruction of the whole state system. Locke's doctrines of a Law\r\nof Nature appear to have had no influence at all outside of England. The\r\nContinental doctrines of natural law played their important part for the\r\nfirst time at the end of the eighteenth century in the great social\r\ntransformation of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIt was not without result that England in distinction from the Continent\r\nhad withstood the influence of the Roman Law. The English legal\r\nconceptions have by no means remained untouched by the Roman, but they\r\nhave not been nearly so deeply influenced by them as the Continental.\r\nThe public law especially developed upon an essentially Teutonic basis,\r\nand the original Teutonic ideas of right have never been overgrown with\r\nthe later Roman conceptions of the state's omnipotence.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic state, however, in distinction from the ancient, so far as\r\nthe latter is historically known to us, rose from weak beginnings to\r\nincreasing power. The competence of the Teutonic state was in the\r\nbeginning very narrow, the individual was greatly restricted by his\r\nfamily and clan, but not by the state. The political life of the Middle\r\nAges found expression rather in associations than in a state which\r\nexhibited at first only rudimentary forms.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of modern times the power of the state became more and\r\nmore concentrated. This could happen in England all the easier because\r\nthe Norman kings had already strongly centralized the administration.\r\nAs early as the end of the sixteenth century Sir Thomas Smith could\r\nspeak of the unrestricted power of the English Parliament,[108] which\r\nCoke a little later declared to be \"absolute and transcendent\".[109]\r\n\r\nBut this power was thought of by Englishmen as unlimited only in a\r\nnominal legal sense. That the state, and therefore Parliament and the\r\nKing have very real restrictions placed upon them has been at all times\r\nin England a live conviction of the people.\r\n\r\nMagna Charta declares that the liberties and rights conceded by it are\r\ngranted \"_in perpetuum_\".[110] In the Bill of Rights it was ordained\r\nthat everything therein contained should \"remain the law of this realm\r\nforever\".[111] In spite of the nominal omnipotence of the state a limit\r\nwhich it shall not over-step is specifically demanded and recognized in\r\nthe most important fundamental laws.\r\n\r\nIn these nominally legal but perfectly meaningless stipulations, the old\r\nTeutonic legal conception of the state's limited sphere of activity\r\nfinds expression.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the Reformation was also based on the idea of the\r\nrestriction of the state. Here, however, there entered the conception of\r\na second restriction which was conditioned by the entire historical\r\ndevelopment. The mediæval state found restrictions not only in the\r\nstrength of its members, but also in the sphere of the church. The\r\nquestion as to how far the state's right extended in spiritual matters\r\ncould only be fully raised after the Reformation, because through the\r\nReformation those limits which had been fixed in the Middle Ages again\r\nbecame disputable. The new defining of the religious sphere and the\r\nwithdrawal of the state from that sphere were also on the lines of\r\nnecessary historical development.\r\n\r\nSo the conception of the superiority of the individual over against the\r\nstate found its support in the entire historical condition of England in\r\nthe seventeenth century. The doctrines of a natural law attached\r\nthemselves to the old conceptions of right, which had never died, and\r\nbrought them out in new form.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the theories that arose on the Continent. Since the\r\npredominance of the historical school, one is accustomed to look upon\r\nthe doctrines of a natural law as impossible dreaming. But an important\r\nfact is thereby overlooked, that no theory, no matter how abstract it\r\nmay seem, which wins influence upon its time can do so entirely outside\r\nof the field of historical reality.\r\n\r\nAn insight into these historical facts is of the greatest importance for\r\na correct legal comprehension of the relation of the state and the\r\nindividual. There are here two possibilities, both of which can be\r\nlogically carried out. According to the one the entire sphere of right\r\nof the individual is the product of state concession and permission.\r\nAccording to the other the state not only engenders rights of the\r\nindividual, but it also leaves the individual that measure of liberty\r\nwhich it does not itself require in the interest of the whole. This\r\nliberty, however, it does not create but only recognizes.\r\n\r\nThe first conception is based upon the idea of the state's omnipotence\r\nas it was most sharply defined in the absolutist doctrines of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Its extreme consequence has been\r\ndrawn by the poet in his question of law:\r\n\r\n   \"Jahrelang schon bedien' ich mich meiner Nase zum Riechen;\r\n   Hab' ich denn wirklich an sie auch ein erweisliches Recht?\"[112]\r\n\r\nThe second theory on the other hand is that of the Teutonic conception\r\nof right corresponding to the historical facts of the gradual\r\ndevelopment of the state's power. If natural right is identical with\r\nnon-historical right, then the first doctrine is for the modern state\r\nthat of natural right, the second that of historical right. However much\r\nthe boundaries of that recognized liberty have changed in the course of\r\ntime, the consciousness that such boundaries existed was never\r\nextinguished in the Teutonic peoples even at the time of the absolute\r\nstate.[113]\r\n\r\nThis liberty accordingly was not created but recognized, and recognized\r\nin the self-limitation of the state and in thus defining the intervening\r\nspaces which must necessarily remain between those rules with which the\r\nstate surrounds the individual. What thus remains is not so much a right\r\nas it is a condition. The great error in the theory of a natural right\r\nlay in conceiving of the actual condition of liberty as a right and\r\nascribing to this right a higher power which creates and restricts the\r\nstate.[114]\r\n\r\nAt first glance the question does not seem to be of great practical\r\nsignificance, whether an act of the individual is one directly permitted\r\nby the state or one only indirectly recognized. But it is not the task\r\nof the science of law merely to train the judge and the administrative\r\nofficer and teach them to decide difficult cases. To recognize the true\r\nboundaries between the individual and the community is the highest\r\nproblem that thoughtful consideration of human society has to solve.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: \"The most high and absolute power of the realm of England\r\nconsisteth in the Parliament ... all that ever the people of Rome might\r\ndo, either in _centuriatis comitiis_ or _tributis_, the same may be done\r\nby the Parliament of England, which representeth and hath the power of\r\nthe whole realm, both the head and the body.\" _The Commonwealth of\r\nEngland_, 1589, Book II, reprinted in Prothero, _Select Statutes and\r\nDocuments of Elizabeth and James I._, Oxford, 1894, p. 178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: 4 _Inst._ p. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Art. 63.

The\r\nmost authentic text has been used; the antiquated and often absurd\r\npunctuation--largely due to incompetent early printers--has been\r\nrationalized; and an introduction, abundant cross-references, and a\r\n_full index_ materially increase the value of this edition for both\r\nstudents and lawyers. Matter of obsolete or minor interest has been put\r\nin distinctive type. An appendix of 149 pages contains The Constitution\r\nwith all the amendments, and the references to U.S. Reports, besides\r\nother documents important to constitutional development.\r\n\r\n_Roger Foster, author of Commentaries on the Constitution_: \"The best\r\nedition of _The Federalist_ that has been published.\"\r\n\r\n_Right Hon.

A soundly edited text; ... an introductory\r\nessay which really puts the touch of finality upon questions that have\r\nbeen in dispute for nearly a century.... For the purposes of critical\r\nstudy and precise reference Mr. Ford's edition, it seems to us, most of\r\nnecessity exclude all others. Quite apart from the extremely valuable\r\neditorial work included in the introductory part of the volume, Mr.\r\nFord's index (_The Federalist_ has never before been indexed) would\r\nentitle him to a vote of thanks by Congress.\"\r\n\r\n_Prof. Edward G. Bourne_, of Yale: \"The most useful edition for the\r\nworking student.\"\r\n\r\n_The Dial_: \"Mr. Paul Leicester Ford has many titles to the gratitude of\r\nstudents interested in American history, and none more clear than that\r\nwhich is due him for his edition of _The Federalist_.... The work is\r\nadmirably done in all important respects, and should be upon the desk of\r\nevery teacher of American constitutional history.\"\r\n\r\n_Prof. Carl Evans Boyd_ of University of Chicago: \"His edition leaves\r\nnothing to be desired, and will undoubtedly become the standard.\"\r\n\r\n_The Outlook_: \"A singularly illuminative introduction; ... one of the\r\nbest planned and most valuable contributions ever made towards the\r\nclearer understanding of our history.\"\r\n\r\nHENRY HOLT & CO.,\r\n\r\n29 West 23rd Street,\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nGORDY'S POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES Vol. I, 1783-1809. 598\r\npp. 12 mo. $1.75, _net, special_.\r\n\r\nA work intended for the thoughtful reader without much previous\r\nknowledge of the subject.

To improve the census was General Walker's work for\r\nmany years, and his experience cannot fail to be of interest to the\r\npresent generation.... Economics in the hands of this master was no\r\ndismal science, because of his broad sympathies, his healthy\r\nconservative optimism, his belief in the efficacy of effort; and, in a\r\nmore superficial sense, because of his saving sense of humor and his\r\nhappy way of putting things, ... he was the fortunate possessor of a\r\nvery pleasing literary style, ... clear and interesting to the general\r\nreader, as well as instructive to the careful student.\"\r\n\r\n_The Outlook_: \"This book makes accessible for students the\r\nmiscellaneous work of one of America's greatest political economists....\r\nDr. Dewey has performed his critical work with the reverence of a\r\ndisciple, and reprinted in full all the more important contributions.\"\r\n\r\n_Political Science Quarterly_: \"The collection embraces between fifty\r\nand sixty articles, all of them characterized by the forceful reasoning\r\nand balanced judgment of the gifted author.\"\r\n\r\nHENRY HOLT & CO.\r\n\r\n29 W. 23d St., NEW YORK\r\n378 Wabash Ave., CHICAGO\r\n\r\n\"A fitting memorial to its author.\"--_The Dial_\r\n\r\n\r\n_A NOTABLE BOOK BY THE LATE_\r\n\r\nFRANCIS A.
