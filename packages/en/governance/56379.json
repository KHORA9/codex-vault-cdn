Every faction and\r\n     every group tells only that part of the truth which reflects\r\n     discredit on its neighbour. Thus our political literature is\r\n     interesting only as an archive of monstrosities. The other part of\r\n     the truth--that which deals with the good qualities of the\r\n     neighbour--is so out of fashion that nobody believes in its\r\n     existence. To tell the truth to our politicians would be the\r\n     greatest proof of friendship that could be offered to them. But who\r\n     has sufficient courage to attempt it? No one in this world would\r\n     venture upon so difficult, so disagreeable, and so dangerous a\r\n     task. The result is that in Spain the only respect paid to the\r\n     truth is to leave it unspoken.”--NUEVO MUNDO, Madrid, Feb. 24,\r\n     1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I have endeavoured to show what the people of\r\nSpain believe to be the truth about those who exercise authority over\r\nthem, as gathered from conversation with Spaniards of all classes, but\r\nprincipally working people, in town and country, and from my own reading\r\nand observation. Whether my informants are right or wrong in their\r\nopinions and beliefs I do not pretend to decide; all I can declare is\r\nthat I have faithfully reported what I have heard and seen. The\r\nimportance of the opinions I have collected lies in the fact that,\r\nwhether they are justified or not, _the people believe them to be true_,\r\nand on that belief they will assuredly act as soon as circumstances\r\nallow.\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge with thanks the courteous permission of the\r\nEditors of the _Spectator_ and the _Standard_ to incorporate in this\r\nvolume the gist of various articles, notes, &c., which first appeared in\r\ntheir pages.

On the contrary, he is a\r\nquiet, industrious, law-abiding citizen, whose chief desire is to be\r\nleft to go about his business and make a living for himself and his\r\nfamily. If he has to fight he fights well, for he does not lack courage,\r\nand he has often been compelled to fight for causes in which he takes no\r\ninterest, as the alternative to losing the employment which stands\r\nbetween him and starvation. But he does not want to fight, because he is\r\nconvinced that all Spain’s wars, whatever their ostensible object, are\r\narranged by his “betters” to put money into their own pockets,\r\nregardless of the true interests of the nation. You may talk as you will\r\nabout the wealth, health, and happiness that might be obtained, say, in\r\nMelilla, should it become a well-administered colony of Spain. The\r\nSpanish working man has an invariable reply to all such suggestions. He\r\nsays: “That might be so under other Governments, but not under ours.\r\nLook at Cuba!”\r\n\r\nEmigration goes on to an extent which causes the gravest apprehension to\r\nthose who have\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACTORY GIRLS.\r\n\r\n[To face page 14.]\r\n\r\ntheir country’s good at heart, and the reason is that owing to the\r\ncontinual increase in taxation, the Spanish labourer cannot make a\r\nliving at home. Of all the taxes which crush him, the most oppressive is\r\nthe _consumo_, or octroi. Little is heard of this outside Spain, because\r\nthose who profit by it have every reason to keep silence, while those\r\nwho suffer have not hitherto dared to raise their voice against the\r\npowerful interests which profit by the system. Any statesman who could\r\nabolish this iniquitous tax would gain thereby an amount of popular\r\nsupport to which ministers of the Crown in Spain have long been\r\nstrangers. But he would have to contend with an organised opposition in\r\nthe monied classes which would be hard to overcome, and hitherto,\r\nalthough the reform is constantly talked of, little or nothing has been\r\ndone to bring it about.\r\n\r\nNext to bread the chief desire of the Spaniard is education for his\r\nchildren. He is thoroughly conscious of the disadvantages of his own\r\nignorance, which he bitterly resents, and the blame for which he lays at\r\nthe door of the Church. The Inquisition is not forgotten, and if there\r\nis no priest or “pious” person within sight, an interested listener may\r\nhear strange tales told in explanation of the popular detestation of the\r\nreligious Orders. Some of these tales are no doubt traditional, handed\r\ndown from the time when the Holy Office was an ever-present terror. It\r\nis not easy for more advanced nations to realise the influence of\r\ntradition among a people necessarily dependent on oral teaching for\r\neverything they know, or the extent to which it colours their thoughts\r\nand affects their actions in every direction. Although the working\r\nclasses in Spain are of course aware that the Inquisition no longer\r\nexists, the effects of the nightmare of three hundred years continue,\r\nand the fear and hatred with which that tribunal was regarded are now\r\ntransferred to the priests, and especially the Religious Orders. The\r\nChurch has ruled in Spain, with one short interval, ever since Isabella\r\nand Torquemada revived the Holy Office, and, like all autocracies, it\r\nhas come to look upon the nation over which it rules as a tool to be\r\nused for its own ends, an insentient thing, a mere machine to be driven\r\nhither and thither as the interests of the Church dictate.\r\n\r\nAnd now the inevitable is happening. The machine has become sentient,\r\nand instead of submitting to be driven it is beginning to take its own\r\ncourse and carry its quondam drivers into regions unknown.\r\n\r\nThe crucial question to-day in Spain is the religious question. Not the\r\nbelief or disbelief of the people in their religion, but the relations\r\nof the Church--_i.e._, that of the priests and, far more, of the\r\nReligious Orders--to the nation.\r\n\r\nFrom tradition and from the circumstances of their lives, the mass of\r\nthe people have come to look upon the Religious Orders as their evil\r\ngenius, and at every turn one meets with evidences of their distrust of\r\nand hostility to those who should be their spiritual guides. Until July,\r\n1909, this feeling, although for long past there have been clear\r\nindications of it, was not openly expressed by the people in public\r\nplaces. They not only hated the “good fathers,” as they satirically call\r\nthem, but dreaded their vengeance upon those who offended them. Since\r\nthe rising against the Religious Orders in Cataluña, however, the\r\nattitude of the two parties towards each other has been reversed. It is\r\nnow the priests and the Religious Orders who are afraid. So little do\r\nthey understand the people whom they are supposed to teach, that they go\r\nin fear of their lives lest the working classes should rise _en masse_\r\nagainst them; whereas the working classes _en masse_ desire nothing\r\nbetter than a peaceable solution which shall ensure their daily bread to\r\nthem and their children.\r\n\r\nOn every side the people see the baneful hand of the Church, interfering\r\nor trying to interfere in their domestic life, ordering the conditions\r\nof employment, draining them of their hard-won livelihood by trusts and\r\nmonopolies established and maintained in the interests of the Religious\r\nOrders, placing obstacles in the way of their children’s education,\r\nhindering them in the exercise of their constitutional rights, and\r\ndeliberately ruining those of them who are bold enough to run counter to\r\npriestly dictation. Riots suddenly break out in Barcelona: they are\r\ninstigated by the Jesuits. The country goes to war in Morocco: it is\r\ndragged into it solely in defence of the mines owned, actually if not\r\nostensibly, by the Jesuits. The _consumos_ cannot be abolished, because\r\nthe Jesuits are financially interested in their continuance, and so\r\nforth. Rightly or wrongly, the people attribute all the ills under which\r\nthey suffer to the influence of the Church, and sooner or later, unless\r\nmeasures are taken to restrain the interference of the Church in public\r\nand private life, an explosion will come which will sweep the whole\r\ninstitution away. Moreover, the steady and continuous efforts made by\r\nthe Church to upset the existing regime and bring back a reign of\r\nabsolutism with the proscribed branch of the House of Bourbon, though\r\nnot continually present in the minds of the people, are not unknown to\r\nor ignored by them.\r\n\r\nBut with all this intensely anti-clerical feeling, the mass of the\r\npeople are untouched by modern scepticism, and are deeply and sincerely\r\nreligious. Their religion is simple in the extreme: many would call it\r\ngross superstition, but such as it is, it suits their stage of\r\nintellectual development and undoubtedly has a considerable effect on\r\ntheir conduct. To represent the Spanish working man--as the Church\r\nnewspapers always do--as an atheist and an anarchist, only to be\r\nrestrained by force from overthrowing the social order, merely proves\r\nhow completely ignorant the Clericalists are of his real character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRACIAL AND CLASS DIVISIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nRACIAL AND CLASS DIVISIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations between rich and poor, between rulers and ruled, between\r\nemployers and employed, in Spain are peculiar and not easy to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe immediate dependents of a well-to-do family are allowed a freedom of\r\nmanner and intercourse which is incomprehensible to English\r\nexclusiveness, and a sense of responsibility for their dependents, and\r\nespecially for those who have rendered long domestic service, is almost\r\nuniversal among employers. Thus there is hardly a family of means that\r\ndoes not, as a matter of course, support for the rest of their lives one\r\nor more of the wet-nurses who brought up the children; and during the\r\nfamine in Andalusia a few years ago, most, if not all, of the landowners\r\ncontinued to pay, to the limit of their means, the wages of their\r\npermanent labourers, although owing to the drought no field work could\r\nbe done for months. But with all this very real generosity towards\r\nthose with whom they are brought in contact, the rich have no corporate\r\nor class sense of responsibility for the working classes, and make no\r\neffort to understand or provide for their needs as a whole. Spaniards\r\nare liberal in alms-giving, and every good Catholic gives doles on one\r\nday of the week to his or her regular pensioners; but there is no public\r\nprovision for the destitute, and it is not in the least realised that an\r\norganised system of poor relief would be less costly, and certainly far\r\nless demoralising, than the haphazard distribution of pence to all and\r\nsundry. It is true that in some towns benevolent societies are carrying\r\non good work according to their means, but these, consisting only of\r\nvoluntary gifts, are not sufficient to do more than touch the fringe of\r\nthe poverty produced by the conditions of the country.\r\n\r\nThe original causes of this combination of an almost patriarchal\r\nrelation between the master and his immediate dependents, and complete\r\nignorance of and indifference to the lot of those outside of the home or\r\nestate, lie deep, and must be sought in the relations between Christians\r\nand Moslems when the Castilians re-conquered Spain. It must be\r\nremembered that the Arabs had brought agriculture and many industries\r\nto a high state of perfection, and after the conquest they continued to\r\ncultivate the land and work at their manufactures for the benefit of\r\ntheir conquerors. Thus for some hundreds of years the dominant was\r\nliving with the subject race, and the conquerors would feel for the\r\nconquered the contempt of the fighting man for the labourer, of the\r\nWestern for the Oriental, of the victor for the vanquished, and of the\r\nChristian for the infidel. It is easy to see that when the mass of the\r\nindustrial population was of alien race, any idea of responsibility on\r\nthe part of the employers for the employed as a class would be unlikely\r\nto arise, while on the other hand the personal relation between master\r\nand servant would become intimate, as it did in the Southern States of\r\nAmerica in the slave-holding days, and as it is in the East to-day. This\r\naccounts for the relation between rich and poor already remarked on:\r\nliberal protection of immediate dependents, coupled with indifference to\r\nthe general welfare of the working classes. The tradition, handed down\r\nfrom the time when the bulk of the proletariat were aliens, has\r\npersisted for two hundred years after the last of the Moslem inhabitants\r\nwas expelled.[1]\r\n\r\nA right understanding both of the past history of Spain and of its\r\nsocial and political condition to-day is made still more difficult by\r\nthe claim made by Castile, with Madrid as the capital, to speak for\r\nSpain as a whole. Most histories of Spain are written from the Castilian\r\npoint of view, and foreign writers naturally go to the capital in search\r\nof their material. But this procedure leaves out of sight the very\r\nimportant distinctions between the different parts of Spain, and\r\nespecially those between the Castilian and the Aragonese of the centre\r\nand north, and the Andalusian, Valencian, and Murcian of the south.\r\nSetting aside Cataluña and the Basque Provinces, with a population in\r\nround numbers of 2,500,000, the rest of Spain north of the Sierra Morena\r\nhas a population of 9,000,000, while the three ancient southern\r\nkingdoms, Valencia, Murcia, and Andalusia, have between them a\r\npopulation of 6,000,000. The distinctive characteristics of these\r\nprovinces, which contain about a third of the total inhabitants of the\r\ncountry, are left unnoticed by Castilian writers and those who follow\r\nthem, or, if the southerners are mentioned at all, it is usually with\r\nsome expression of contempt. This applies especially to the Andalusian,\r\nwho is always spoken of as lazy and incompetent, without ambition,\r\ncontent to sit in the sun and smoke a cigarette, a windbag who talks\r\neverlastingly and does nothing, and generally a negligible quantity in\r\nSpanish politics, and a person unworthy of serious consideration in\r\nMadrid.\r\n\r\nThe ingrained orientalism of the south is at the root of the hostility\r\nwith which it is regarded by Castile and the north. Andalusia and\r\nValencia were under Moslem rule for some 500 years--Granada for nearly\r\n750--and this long occupation and colonisation has left an indelible\r\nimpress on the race, language, customs, and modes of thought of the\r\nsouth. On the other hand, the Arab invasion of the north was soon driven\r\nback beyond the Sierra de Guadarrama, and even in New Castile and\r\nEstremadura, north of the Guadiana, their occupation was more in the\r\nnature of a military tenure than a colonisation, and, such as it was,\r\ncame to an end 160 years before the Christians were able to win any\r\nfooting in the southern provinces. There is, therefore, comparatively\r\nlittle Eastern blood in the veins of the Castilian, while in those of\r\nthe southerner the Arabic strain is at least as strong as the European.\r\n\r\nHow little sympathy exists between Castile and Andalusia may be judged\r\nfrom the following facts: In 1904 the south-west of Spain was afflicted\r\nby ten months of drought, causing the worst famine known for many\r\nyears. Men literally died of starvation by the roadside, and the\r\nsuffering among women and children was something terrible. No national\r\nor combined effort was attempted for the relief of the distress, which,\r\nindeed, the Clericalist organs of Madrid minimised and almost mocked at,\r\nsaying that “every one knew that the Andalusians were all farmers, and\r\nfarmers would grumble whatever the weather was.” On the other hand, when\r\ncomparatively small districts in Castile, Leon, and Galicia suffered\r\nfrom floods in 1910, over 100,000 pesetas were collected by voluntary\r\nsubscription within a week.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that, while the reconquest of the whole of Spain\r\nexcept the Kingdom of Granada was completed by the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century, there was no large exodus of the Moslem inhabitants\r\nuntil their expulsion in 1609,[2] and that, until Isabella’s religious\r\nfervour made things unpleasant for them, they lived side by side with\r\ntheir Spanish conquerors, and were, on the whole, not badly treated\r\nuntil the persecution and expulsion ordered by Philip III. Indeed, all\r\nthe evidence goes to show that a steady amalgamation of the races went\r\non, with so much intermarriage, that in some parts of the country there\r\nis hardly a family without Eastern blood in its veins. But necessarily\r\nand naturally the conquered race gradually fell more and more into the\r\nposition of servants and slaves.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great preponderance of the Arabs and Moriscos was in the\r\nsouth, numbers of them were scattered over other parts of Spain, even so\r\nlate as the beginning of the sixteenth century, which accounts for the\r\nposition of the working classes elsewhere being much on a par, so far as\r\ntheir employers’ view of them is concerned, with that of their fellows\r\nin the south.\r\n\r\nThus Spain is now divided into two unconsciously hostile camps, with an\r\ningrained tradition of racial and religious hostility at the root of\r\ntheir antagonism, which is a fatal obstacle to mutual understanding. The\r\nSpanish labourer has replaced his predecessor of alien race, but the\r\ntradition of contempt and indifference remains, and the employer--and\r\nespecially the employer who is “addicted to the priests”--still regards\r\nhim, as his predecessor regarded his Moslem servant, as a hewer of wood\r\nand drawer of water, whose duty is to pay his taxes, and to use the\r\nsuffrage nominally bestowed on him by the Constitution in the interests\r\nof his master. The working classes, if we are to believe the assertions\r\nof their “superiors,” are a godless lot with anarchical leanings, whose\r\nvandalistic tendencies have to be suppressed with a strong hand lest\r\nthey break out to the total subversion of society. But ask a peasant\r\nabout his politics, and he will say that all he wants is a sufficient\r\nwage to provide for his family and a decent education for his children,\r\nand he will add that he has no hope that any political party will help\r\nhim to realise this modest ambition, or do anything whatever for him,\r\nbecause “all Governments, whatever they call themselves, are of one\r\nkidney, and care for nothing but pocketing the public funds, and\r\npleasing the Religious Orders; the Conservatives because they love them,\r\nand the Liberals because they fear them, and both because the Jesuits\r\nare the richest people in Spain.”\r\n\r\nThe patient submission of the labourer to conditions which he believes\r\nto be unalterable is partly the result of three hundred years of corrupt\r\ngovernment, during which he has been steadily squeezed to provide money\r\nfor the wars, luxuries, and amusements of the governing classes; partly\r\nof the terror of the Inquisition and the tradition of silence that it\r\nhas left behind it; partly of Oriental fatalism; but is certainly not\r\ndue to the animal indifference and stupidity to which his “betters”\r\nattribute it. The peasant refrains from open complaint, not because he\r\nis contented and has nothing to complain of, but because long experience\r\nhas taught him the uselessness and the danger of protest. He may offend\r\nhis employer and lose his place, or, still worse, he may offend the\r\nChurch and the Jesuits, in which case he will be a marked man, and can\r\nnever hope to get permanent employment again.\r\n\r\nHere is a paragraph which appeared in a leading Clericalist organ on\r\nDecember 1, 1909:\r\n\r\n     “Canovas and Sagasta attracted to the Monarchy the most\r\n     aristocratic elements of the Carlist and Republican masses, through\r\n     the mediation of Pidal and Castelar. Señor Moret (leader of the\r\n     Liberal-Monarchist party) does not act in this way. Instead of\r\n     considering the honourable people he considers the masses, the\r\n     elements which bring about disturbances of the social order.”\r\n\r\nThis summarises in a few words the attitude which has always been\r\nmaintained by the Church, and the aristocracy attached to the Church,\r\ntowards the democracy. The people must be restrained from making their\r\nvoice heard in the counsels of the nation, although they have nominally\r\npossessed the suffrage for some forty years, because, if the masses are\r\ngiven the free use of the vote, they will disturb a social order\r\nmaintained exclusively in the interests of the classes. Such sentiments\r\nwere common in France before 1789, but one hardly expects to find them\r\nso badly expressed in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe upper classes in Spain are in the majority thoroughly materialised.\r\nTheir object in life is simple--wealth and power, with all that they\r\nbring in their train, often without too nice a regard for the means\r\nwhereby those ambitions are realised. Their religion consists in a\r\ndiligent observance of the ordinances of the Church, and submission to\r\nthe dictates of the priesthood.[3] Of any higher ideals--of any\r\namelioration in the general lot of the poor, of any improvement in the\r\ndeplorably backward state of education, of any attempt to raise the low\r\nmoral tone which prevails in their own class, little or nothing is ever\r\nheard. There is, however, an increasing number of educated young men who\r\nare doing what lies in their power to promote a better state of things.\r\nThey have to contend, not only against the active hostility of the\r\nclericals, but against the dead weight of middle-class apathy and\r\nignorance, and in consequence their labour is as that of Sisyphus. Yet\r\nthey patiently struggle on against all discouragements, and their circle\r\nof influence is widening every year.\r\n\r\nBut while the upper-class Spaniard is intent on the pursuit of wealth\r\nand indifferent to higher things, the peasant has an ideal which he has\r\nset before him, and for which he makes every effort in his power,\r\nagainst obstacles which anywhere but in Spain would be inconceivable.\r\nAnd that ideal, as has been said, is some sort of education for his\r\nchildren, whom he does not wish to be handicapped, as he has been, by\r\ninability to read and write. If he can only pay for the schooling of one\r\nchild, that child has to share his knowledge with the rest of the\r\nfamily, reading to them all he can get to read, and sometimes even\r\npassing on the little instruction he has received, and teaching his\r\nparents and brothers and sisters their letters at night, after the\r\nday’s work is done.[4] And his chosen reading is not the republican, or\r\nsocialist, or anarchical stuff against which the Church inveighs with\r\ntheological fervour as the mental pabulum beloved of the masses, but\r\ncertain papers with moderate Liberal views, which preach education and\r\nloyalty to existing institutions as the best hope for the country. These\r\npapers point out that any upheaval of the social order, with its\r\nnecessarily attendant paralysis of trade and agriculture, can only\r\nresult in making the hard lot of the labourer harder still; and the\r\npeasant, whom his masters take to be indifferent and half brutal, has\r\nthe sense to see the wisdom of this teaching and to be guided by it.\r\nThat the Ultramontane party should maintain, as they do, that every\r\ndisturbance that may occur in Spain is the fruit of the working man’s\r\nattachment to seditious and anti-religious literature, is only another\r\nproof of their determination to misrepresent or slander him. Had this\r\nbeen the case, no measures of repression would have saved Spain, in July\r\n1909, from an outburst of rage against the Religious Orders all over the\r\ncountry. That the fires lighted in Barcelona did not spread was not due\r\nto the suspension of the Constitution or to any terrorism exercised by\r\nthe priest-ridden Government of Señor Maura. The people were kept in\r\nbounds by the influence of their chosen organ, the _Liberal_, which\r\ncosts less than a farthing and has the largest circulation of any paper\r\nin Spain. And this paper, like the others of its party and all the best\r\nof the Radical and Republican Press, throughout all the turmoil of the\r\nthree months before the Maura Ministry fell, steadily urged the people\r\nto have patience, keep the peace, and show by their actions that they\r\nwere worthy of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGION OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEASANT WOMEN.\r\n\r\n[To face page 39.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGION OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you ask upper-class Spaniards, priestly or lay, about the religion of\r\nthe people of Spain, you will be told that half the nation are bigots\r\nand the other half free-thinkers and atheists, or at best indifferent\r\nLaodiceans: a sweeping assertion that has so often been made that it has\r\nbecome a commonplace with foreign journalists and magazine writers.\r\n\r\nTo accuse the nation at large of bigotry, atheism, or indifferentism, is\r\nnevertheless as unjust as to accuse the army of cowardice. Small though\r\nis the attendance of the working classes at Mass, and hostile though\r\nthey are to the practice of confession, they are none the less deeply\r\nreligious--firm believers in the efficacy of prayer, and loyal to the\r\nfundamental tenets of their faith, such as dependence on the will of\r\nGod, gratitude for small mercies vouchsafed by a good Providence, and\r\ndevotion to the Virgin and the saints.\r\n\r\nIn the middle class there is, no doubt, a good deal of rather shallow\r\nfree-thinking, although it usually goes little beyond a scoff at\r\nsuperstition and contempt for miracles and images, and is confined to\r\nthe men. The women usually follow in their mothers’ footsteps, attend\r\nMass, run through the rosary, and thoroughly enjoy the processions which\r\nenliven so many Church festivals. Confession, however, is perfunctory\r\neven among middle-class women, and the poor avoid it altogether. For\r\nstrict observance of the ordinances and for material support of the\r\nChurch you must go to women of higher social position, ladies of title\r\nand the wives of rich men, whose political relations keep them hand in\r\nhand with the priests and the Religious Orders. They are the bulwark of\r\nthe Church in Spain. Indeed, it is often said that if all the ladies of\r\nthe aristocracy could be locked up for a few years, the Church of Spain\r\nwould go to pieces, so little real hold has it on any other element in\r\nthe national life.\r\n\r\nThese ladies attend Mass every day and confess with great regularity.\r\nThey consider it the highest privilege to be “wardrobe keepers” for the\r\n_santos_ (saints-images) in their favourite churches; they dress and\r\nundress the image of the Virgin with their own hands for festivals, and\r\nthey keep in their own houses the jewels and other treasures belonging\r\nto her. In some cases they also look after the vestments of the priests\r\nand take charge of the altar linen. And they give or bequeath large\r\nfortunes to different monasteries and convents, and to religious houses\r\nbuilt to receive orphans and old people, repentant Magdalens, and girls\r\nin training for domestic service. But no one is admitted to institutions\r\nsupported by ladies of devout life save on condition of daily attendance\r\nat Mass and regular confession and communion. And therefore the people\r\nsay that such charity is not dictated by love for their poorer brethren,\r\nbut is merely given in order to prop up a decadent Church, and many will\r\nstarve rather than ask for it.\r\n\r\nThe people have a word of contempt for the religious principles of women\r\nsuch as these. They call them _beata_, which according to the dictionary\r\nmeans “devout,” but which the poor translate as “canting.” There is a\r\nworld of difference to them between the lady who is _religiosa_\r\n(religious) and the one who is _beata_. _Religiosa_ is applied to a\r\nwoman who devotes her life to God and works for the sake of doing good;\r\n_beata_ means one who lives, moves, and has her being under the thumb of\r\nthe priests and the Religious Orders.\r\n\r\nThe poor say that unless they are prepared to attend Mass and confess\r\nregularly, they can expect nothing from women, however rich, who are\r\nknown to be _beatas_. For alms given unquestioningly and without\r\ninsistence on previous compliance with the rules of the Church, the sick\r\nand needy turn by preference either to persons recognised as “religious”\r\nor to those who “have nothing to do with those follies.” That is how the\r\npractice of confession is characterised by the democracy in the privacy\r\nof their own homes. They dread and distrust the confessors, and no poor\r\nman or woman will speak freely in the presence of one of their own class\r\nwho is in the habit of confessing.\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding their antagonism to this primary dogma of their\r\nreligion, the working classes, and especially the peasantry, are, as\r\nalready stated, deeply and sincerely devout, and firmly uphold the\r\nChristian faith as they understand it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable features in the spiritual life of the nation\r\nis the clear comprehension of even the least educated among them that\r\nthe sins of the priests and the Religious Orders stand apart from and\r\nleave unsmirched the national religion.\r\n\r\n“What have I to do with those people?” said a young fisherman to the\r\nwriter. “Confess to a priest? Never! I confess to God and my mother, and\r\nI want no priest to come between me and my God.”\r\n\r\n“I? Confess to a priest? What for? Every night when I go to bed I\r\nconfess my sins to the Virgin, and I can die as well after that as if I\r\nhad received the holy oils,” said an old woman of deep and sincere\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n“I do not allow my wife to go to confession,” said a master mason. “If\r\nshe insisted I should refuse to provide for her. I will have no traffic\r\nwith the gentry of the long skirts in _my_ family.”\r\n\r\n“No, I did not call in a priest when my husband was dying. He would have\r\ndied all the sooner if I had, he hated them so. We poor people never\r\ncall the priest if we can help it. We say ‘death gave us no time.’ The\r\npriests pretend to believe it; they are glad enough to be saved the\r\ntrouble of coming to our houses because, if we send for them, they have\r\nto give the holy oils gratis. And we get buried all the same,” said a\r\nyoung widow who had lost husband and child within three months of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“And you are not afraid the dead will stay longer in purgatory if they\r\ndie without the holy oils?” I have frequently asked on hearing such\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\n“Why should they? My brother, may his soul rest in peace! was a good\r\nman. God will look after him without any priest putting in his oar. Yes,\r\nit is true that the priests talk of purgatory, but for my part I have\r\nnever well understood what it is, and I do not care. I say a prayer for\r\nmy dead on All Souls’ Day, and there is an end of it. There may be\r\npurgatory, God knows. But certainly I will not pay money to a priest on\r\nthat account. I want it more than he does.”\r\n\r\nThe popular idea of purgatory is very confused, and many declare that\r\nthey do not believe in it, while betraying in every word that they pray\r\nheartily for the souls that they assume to be there.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I could believe that my brother or my mother are in\r\npurgatory, or that _I_ shall go there, I, who would give the clothes off\r\nmy back to the poor?”\r\n\r\nYou cannot pay a greater compliment to a sceptic of this kind than to\r\nsay: “By your good deed of this or that kind you have certainly taken a\r\nsoul (or two souls) out of purgatory to-day.” “Taking souls out of\r\npurgatory” is a favourite occupation. It is effected by prayer or by\r\ngood works, not necessarily, so far as the popular belief can be\r\nunderstood, by both practices together.\r\n\r\n“There are always seven souls clinging to the cloak of the Virgin--not\r\nthe Virgin on any altar, but the real Virgin in heaven. They are all\r\nclimbing up, one above the other, and by prayers or good works you can\r\nhelp the uppermost to get out and make room for the next.”\r\n\r\n“And where do they go then?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. To heaven, I suppose. Purgatory is not a very bad place\r\nto be in, it is pretty fair. The wicked people go to the _Tinieblas_\r\n[tenebræ]. I do not know what that is, but it is very bad. It is always\r\nwell to say a prayer for those in _Tinieblas_.”\r\n\r\n“But do you suppose that any of _your_ friends are there?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed; but you never know who may be clinging to the robe of the\r\nVirgin, and some one belonging to you might just be climbing up. At\r\nleast, nothing is lost by saying a prayer.”\r\n\r\n“If the souls in the _Tinieblas_ are allowed to cling to the Virgin, I\r\nsuppose she also is there?”\r\n\r\n“How do I know? Perhaps these are all lies--things of priests\r\n[_mentiras, cosas de sacerdotes_]. What does it matter? What is needful\r\nis to share your _puchero_[5] with any poor man who is hungrier than\r\nyou, and God knows I do that.”\r\n\r\nThe custom of attending a Mass for the dead on All Souls’ Day is very\r\ngeneral. There are thousands of men and women who never set foot in a\r\nchurch during the rest of the year, yet rise an hour earlier than usual\r\nto go to Mass before beginning their work on November 2nd. But the\r\nproportion of communicants even on this occasion is very small. I have\r\ncounted the congregations present at churches attended by the working\r\nand the lower middle classes on All Souls’ Day. At one early Mass, out\r\nof forty present, four communicated; at another, two out of thirteen;\r\nand so on. Communion involves previous confession, and the poor will not\r\nconfess. Nevertheless, their faces show that this Mass is not a mere\r\nempty form to them. They do not, of course, understand a syllable of the\r\nwords the priest mutters at the altar, but they are absorbed in earnest\r\nintercession for the dead whom they are commemorating. Then they go\r\ntheir way to take up the round of work, and probably do not attend\r\nanother Mass until All Souls’ Day comes round again, while the rich\r\ncelebrate the “Day of the Dead” by paying for and attending frequent\r\nMasses, and by taking or sending wreaths of flowers to adorn the graves\r\nof relatives in the distant cemetery.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, infant baptism bulks far larger in the religion of the\r\npoor than any other office of the Church, and the parents, and\r\nespecially the mother, will make heavy sacrifices to obtain the fee\r\ndemanded for the performance of this rite. The ceremony itself has some\r\nsingular features, for the mother must on no account be present, and\r\neven the father remains in the background. But the social function which\r\nfollows the ceremony in the Church is almost as important an event in\r\nthe family life as a wedding, and the festivities are kept up far into\r\nthe night. It may seem fanciful to trace these baptismal customs back to\r\nthe time of Islam, but it is a fact that the accounts of the\r\nbirth-feasts (_buenas fadas_) among the Moslems of Spain offer certain\r\nresemblances to those of to-day, while the term used to describe an\r\nunbaptized child among the peasantry links us directly to the time when\r\nto be a follower of the Prophet was to be an object of contumely. The\r\nexplanation of the efforts made by the family and friends of a child of\r\npoor parents to scrape together the 7.50 pesetas demanded by the priest\r\nfor the performance of the baptismal office is: “I could not leave him a\r\nMoor” (_No podia dejarle Moro_).\r\n\r\nBurial often takes place without the offices of the Church, for there\r\nare few among the working classes who can afford to pay for a funeral\r\nMass, and very many are unaware that they can insist upon the attendance\r\nof a priest even without a fee. And since the charge for a marriage in\r\nchurch amounts in many parishes to as much as 25 pesetas--the average\r\nweekly wage of the agricultural labourer certainly not exceeding half\r\nthat sum--it is only to be expected that the civil ceremony, which costs\r\none peseta, or the stolen “blessing” snatched from an unwilling priest\r\nby the pair proclaiming themselves man and wife at the close of any\r\nMass, should be more frequently resorted to than the orthodox function.\r\nMany couples, moreover, live all their lives as husband and wife, as\r\nfaithfully as if married by the Church or the mayor, without any\r\nreligious or legal tie at all.\r\n\r\n“The women don’t like it,” said a working man to the writer, “but what\r\nis one to do? How can we pay twenty-five pesetas to get married? And the\r\nwomen are only now beginning to understand that the civil marriage is\r\nquite as good as the other, if there is any question of money to be\r\nleft to the children. I could show you plenty among my neighbours who\r\nlive as if married, and no one takes notice that they are not. The\r\npriests only say such couples are living in sin because they have not\r\ngot the marriage fee out of them.”\r\n\r\n“It is true that my daughter-in-law could leave my son if she liked,”\r\nsaid an old woman when discussing a quarrel between her hot-tempered son\r\nand his hotter-tempered “wife.” “There was no money for the marriage, so\r\nI consented to their marrying without going to church. They will never\r\nseparate: it does not occur to them that it would be possible. It is not\r\nas if they were not faithful to each other. My son does not look at\r\nother women, and as for my daughter-in-law (_mi nuera_), he would kill\r\nher if she set her eyes on another man, and well she knows it. There is\r\nno sin in marriages like that, whatever the priests may say about it. Of\r\ncourse I would have preferred that they should be married in church, and\r\nso would my daughter-in-law, but what are you to do when there is no\r\nmoney?”\r\n\r\nThe use of the term _nuera_ here is significant. No social stigma\r\nattaches to these “wives” who are no wives at all, unless they leave one\r\nman to go to another. Then they are branded as “women of bad repute” by\r\ntheir neighbours, and shunned accordingly.\r\n\r\nThus the religion of the people seems to be entirely dissociated from\r\nthe forms imposed by the Church upon its members, save only that of\r\nbaptism, which is respected mainly owing to an unconscious traditional\r\nantipathy to the unbaptized;--the “Moor” or Moslem, of bygone days--and\r\nan almost complete indifference to the rites of marriage and death has\r\nsprung up as a consequence of inability to pay the fees demanded for\r\ntheir performance. In the towns perhaps few really care if their dead\r\nare buried without a prayer, but in the villages there still remains\r\nenough feeling about it to arouse an occasional growl of indignation\r\nwhen a coffin is borne through the streets attended only by the\r\nmourners, without the priest, the acolytes, and the censer-bearers, who\r\nlend distinction to the last journey of those who possess a few pesetas.\r\nAs for the children, who are born and die like flies, the poor have\r\nbecome so accustomed to see the little coffins carried by on the\r\nshoulders of small elder brothers or school friends, led by the father\r\nor uncle of the dead child, that the piteous sight no longer calls forth\r\na comment. It is often only one out of half a dozen of the same family\r\nwho have gone the same way, and notwithstanding the heartbroken\r\nlamentations of the mother when the breath leaves the little body, every\r\none knows she will soon be consoled. The lot of the poor is too hard for\r\nindulgence in sorrow, and it is not uncommon to hear a woman who is\r\napproaching childbirth say with the utmost unconcern, “We shall see what\r\nhappens. Perhaps it will please God to allow the infant to be born\r\ndead.” It is not heartlessness or want of love for her offspring, for\r\nSpanish parents of both sexes and of every class are very affectionate,\r\nand indulge their children to excess. It is simply that every extra\r\nmouth to feed means so much less to fill the stomachs of the rest, while\r\nthe national custom of suckling the child for at least a year, and often\r\nfor two renders the mother meanwhile weak and unfit for the washing,\r\nsewing, or charing which helps out the family resources. That a great\r\neffort should be made to baptize the new baby when it comes shows the\r\nstrength of the feeling in regard to this religious duty, and would make\r\nthe general indifference to the intervention of the Church in marriage\r\nand death doubly remarkable, were it not that the tradition connected\r\nwith the first ceremony does not extend to the other two.\r\n\r\nAmong the upper classes more attention seems to be paid to the\r\nreligious funeral ceremony than to the actual committal to the grave.\r\nWhen a death takes place in a family of social position, all the friends\r\nand relatives are invited to attend the funeral Mass, which takes place\r\nin the parish church of the defunct, and it is expected of the guests\r\nthat they shall accompany the funeral procession on foot as far as the\r\noutskirts of the town or village, the cemetery generally being some\r\nlittle distance beyond. There, however, the party disperse; few attend\r\nthe coffin to the grave itself, and very often it is shuffled into its\r\nlast resting-place with what to English eyes seems indecent haste and\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\nIndeed, whatever be the reason, small respect is shown for the empty\r\nshell, once the spirit of life has fled. The rich buy a freehold grave\r\nfor themselves and their family, but the poor can seldom afford to pay\r\nfor more than a six years’ concession, if that; and if they do not renew\r\npayment the bones of their dead are disinterred and thrown on a heap in\r\nthe _osario_ or bone-house, a building with a locked door built for the\r\npurpose within the walls of the cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe mental attitude of the people towards images is intricate and\r\ndifficult to disentangle. Even persons who have had what ought to be a\r\nliberal education in many cases believe in the miraculous virtues of\r\nthe images, scapulars, and medals of their particular devotion.\r\n\r\n“If you would only wear this medal,” a devout lady said to the writer,\r\n“I know you would be converted to the true faith, for it is very\r\nmiraculous, and has converted many. But you would not wear it, so it is\r\nuseless to give it to you.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a woman of culture, artistic, and fairly well read for a\r\nSpanish lady, yet she was obviously sincere in her belief in the virtues\r\nof the little cast-lead medal washed over with silver.\r\n\r\nNor is this singular simplicity confined to women. Every year men of the\r\nupper classes (never, I think, of the lower) may be seen during Holy\r\nWeek walking barefoot before the images carried in procession through\r\nthe streets; and since their faces are covered and there is nothing to\r\nreveal their identity to the world at large, it cannot be supposed that\r\nthe act of penance is performed for political reasons, as,\r\nunfortunately, is too often the case with public demonstrations of\r\nadherence to the Church. Moreover, these processions are attended by men\r\nof Liberal as well as Conservative opinions. That the particular image\r\nplays an important part is shown by the fact that the act of penitence\r\nis never performed save in connection with its appearance in the\r\nstreets. The penitent walks barefoot before or after the platform on\r\nwhich is carried the Virgin of his adoration, and although it may be one\r\namong fifty representations of the Virgin in his city, it is understood\r\nthat no other would have the same efficacy in cleansing his particular\r\nsin. It must be a genuinely penitential experience for a man used to\r\nluxury to tramp barefoot over badly paved streets at a rate of progress\r\nwhich makes the two or three miles of distance occupy twice as many\r\nhours of time, and sometimes these aristocratic penitents reach the end\r\nof their journey in a state of complete exhaustion. But there does not\r\nseem to be any sentiment of shame or disgrace attached to the act, as\r\nthough there were some great sin to purge, for it is not unusual to hear\r\na young man of orthodox proclivities say to a girl whom he meets in\r\nsociety shortly before Holy Week: “You must look out for me at such a\r\nplace in the route of the procession; I am going in penitence and I will\r\nlift my hood there for you to know it is I.” Yet, frivolous as such\r\npenitence may appear, the rich man shares with his poor and ignorant\r\nbrother a personal feeling for the image of his devotion, which leads\r\nhim to disregard even danger to life in connection with it, should the\r\nneed arise. This is quite dramatically shown in the case of the fires\r\nwhich frequently occur in churches and chapels, where lights burn\r\ncontinually before images adorned with lace and other combustible\r\nfabrics. The _santos_ are always the first thought of the crowd on these\r\noccasions, and even men who scoff aloud at “all those fooleries” in\r\ndaily life will be seen risking personal injury to save “the Virgin of\r\nHope” or “Our Lady of Miracles” from destruction.\r\n\r\nOne very puzzling question in connection with this worship of the images\r\nis how far even the better educated Spaniards recognise the fact that\r\nthe different images, _e.g._, of the Virgin--the Virgin of Sorrows, of\r\nMiracles, of the Pillar, of the Kings, and hundreds more--are all\r\nrepresentations of one and the same Virgin Mary, and how far they\r\nconsider them to be distinct individuals. Probably the worshippers\r\nthemselves are not at all clear on the point: that the prayers offered\r\nbefore these images are in most cases addressed, not to the Person\r\nrepresented, but to the image itself, there seems little doubt. In the\r\ncase of the populace the images certainly seem to be distinct\r\nindividuals; indeed, I have been pitied more than once by kindly\r\npeasants for having “only one Christ.” “_We_ have many: there is the\r\nChrist of the Descent from the Cross, and the Christ of the Waters,\r\nbesides the Christ of the Flagellation in the Parish Church, all very\r\nmiraculous.”\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man of middle age, better educated than most of his\r\nclass, said to me in reference to the affection of the Spanish peasants\r\nfor their images of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n“You would be shocked if you could hear what we say to the Virgin in our\r\nhouses and when we see her in the streets. But it is not irreverence or\r\ndisrespect, as you would consider it. It is that we feel towards her as\r\none of the family and talk to her as we should to one of ourselves.”\r\n\r\nThe return of certain confraternities after carrying their images\r\nthrough the streets in Holy Week presents an extraordinary spectacle.\r\nThis is especially the case with images belonging to the poorer\r\nquarters. In one town the procession of one of these images returns\r\nearly on the morning of Easter Eve, after moving slowly through the\r\nstreets, from its church to the distant cathedral and back, all through\r\nthe night. The bearers of the platform, which is a great weight, the\r\nmembers of the confraternity, the soldiers--for the Army always has a\r\nplace in these functions--and the band in attendance, are all worn out\r\nwith fatigue, but when they reach the threshold of the church they\r\nrevive, the band strikes up an animated march, and the whole crowd\r\nassembled to do honour to “Our Lady” seem to go crazy with joy at having\r\nbrought her safely back to her “home” (_á su casa_). The richly dressed\r\nlife-sized image is lifted down from the platform by many eager hands,\r\nand swayed to and fro in time to the music almost as if dancing, and the\r\nwhole atmosphere of the scene is that of a rejoicing welcome to a\r\nbeloved being who has returned to her family after a long absence\r\nfraught with danger. Nothing brings home to the observer the intense\r\nreality of the people’s feeling for their _santos_ like such a scene as\r\nthis. It is, however, seldom witnessed by foreigners or even by the\r\nwell-to-do of their own nation. It is so much a matter of course in\r\nSpain that no one goes out of his way to see it, and I was present on\r\nsuch an occasion only by the merest chance.\r\n\r\nA bright, clever woman of the working classes, with a strong sense of\r\nhumour, told me that she could only pray to a certain Christ. “All the\r\nothers are only sticks (_palos_) to me. I can never pass our Lord of\r\nPity without kneeling down, and I know by the look in his eyes if he is\r\ngoing to grant my prayer, but I cannot pray to any of the others.”\r\n\r\n“Then when you pray to that image of Our Lord, it really is the Christ\r\nto you?”\r\n\r\n“No; the Christ is in heaven with His Mother, but I pray to our Lord of\r\nPity, and he always answers me. No other is the same. When I pass Our\r\nLord of the Miracles, for instance, in the Church of San José, I have to\r\nsay: ‘Excuse me, Lord, but you are only a stick to me, and I cannot pray\r\nto you. I do not know why this should be so, Lord, but that is how I\r\nfind it.’” All this was said quite gravely, and the prayer addressed to\r\n“Our Lord of Pity” was recited with sincere piety.\r\n\r\nA good old widow of my acquaintance finds St. Anthony of Padua\r\nparticularly sympathetic, and feels constrained to pray for the soul of\r\nher husband at 7 a.m. on All Souls’ Day before one particular St.\r\nAnthony in one particular chapel at a quite inconvenient distance from\r\nher home. On any other occasion the first St. Anthony of Padua she comes\r\nacross serves her purpose, and I once saw her stop short and break into\r\na fervent prayer under her breath at the sight of an abominable penny\r\nchromo of the saint which suddenly attracted her attention in a shop\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORALITY AND CEREMONIAL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWSPAPER SELLERS IN MADRID.\r\n\r\n(At the offices of the _Nuevo Mundo_.)\r\n\r\n[To face page 61.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMORALITY AND CEREMONIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThat it is a duty to speak the truth is a proposition practically\r\nunrecognised in Spain. This is chiefly, if not entirely, due to the\r\ninfluence of the Church, for, as a great historian says in reference to\r\nthis question, “when credulity is inculcated as a virtue, falsehood will\r\nnot long be stigmatised as a vice.”[6] I have heard the peasant’s creed\r\non this point put into a nutshell, thus:\r\n\r\n“Very often it is necessary to lie, either for your own or for some one\r\nelse’s benefit. There is nothing wrong in that. But to tell an\r\nunnecessary lie is a sin.”\r\n\r\nThis sophism, which I have translated word for word, seems altogether\r\ntoo subtle to be instinctive, and we trace in it some echo of the\r\nChurch’s teaching, instilled into the mind of the uneducated, who have\r\ncome to adopt it as an axiom of common morality.\r\n\r\nThe honesty of the Spaniard is, according to our views, relative. It is\r\nvery rare for a working man or woman to take cash which does not belong\r\nto him. But the same people--_e.g._, servants--who would consider it a\r\ndisgrace to steal a peseta in coin, will have no hesitation in\r\nfalsifying their accounts and cheating their employer out of ten or\r\ntwenty times that amount.\r\n\r\nIn certain matters there is extreme sensitiveness to any suspicion of\r\ndishonesty, but it is not clear that any conscious religious principle\r\nunderlies this feeling. It seems rather an instinct of self-protection;\r\nfor when we learn that it is a common practice for employers to examine\r\ntheir servants’ boxes when they leave a situation, even although their\r\ngood conduct has not been called into question, we see that the\r\nfriendliest relations between master and man do not necessarily imply\r\nconfidence in the honour of the latter. The result of assuming evil\r\nwhere there is none is to encourage its genesis. I have heard\r\nworking-class Spaniards say bitterly: “The rich people believe that we\r\nare all thieves, so what is the use of being honest? Yet most of us are\r\nhonest, even though we go hungry for being so.” Stealing is considered\r\nby the poor as a sin, but I am inclined to think that the degree of\r\nsinfulness depends in the criminal’s eyes upon the nature of the theft.\r\nThus, while no respectable peasant will steal money or clothes, servants\r\nhave no hesitation in appropriating sweets and wine, to which, indeed,\r\nthey think they have a right, very possibly dating from the time when\r\ndomesticated aliens were fed on the leavings of their masters’ table. It\r\nwould be difficult to convince them that to drink their employer’s wine\r\nwithout permission is just as immoral as to steal his cash.\r\n\r\nThe instruction given by the Church on these points is hardly ambiguous,\r\nif one may judge by a parish leaflet in my possession. It contains the\r\nfollowing questions of conscience resolved under the head of\r\n“Consultations.”\r\n\r\n     “May a servant give to the poor the food which remains over,\r\n     without asking permission of her master?”\r\n\r\n     “She may do so when her master does not make use of or dispose of\r\n     it.”\r\n\r\n     “And may she give it to her poor relations?”\r\n\r\n     “Without any doubt; but _it is better_ to consult her master”\r\n     (italics mine).\r\n\r\nSuch moral teaching as this would quite account for the conduct of a\r\npious cook once in my employ, who fed her entire family for some time at\r\nmy expense. She, it is perhaps needless to say, did not “consult her\r\nmaster” on the point. She may have consulted her priest, for all I know,\r\nand if she did was probably told that it was a meritorious act to rob a\r\nheretic.\r\n\r\nTo turn to another branch of the subject, it will probably be news to\r\nmany people that a “Bull of the Crusade” is still largely sold in Spain.\r\nThis indulgence was first instituted in the days of the Moorish wars, to\r\npermit those who were fighting the infidel to keep up their strength by\r\neating meat whenever they could get it. Few or none of the poor purchase\r\nthis or any other indulgence nowadays, but it is still freely sold to\r\npeople of means, and the day of its issue is kept as a minor feast day.\r\nIt now costs the modest sum of pesetas 1.75, having been gradually\r\nreduced from pesetas 7.50, and is a source of income to the Government,\r\nproducing, according to the Budget for 1909, 2,670,000 pesetas, or, say,\r\n£106,800. Any one can obtain it, as no questions are asked as to the\r\nreligion of the purchaser.\r\n\r\nAn interesting survival is the penitential purple dress, with yellow\r\ncord and tassels round the neck and waist, which is worn on occasion by\r\nwomen of all classes in the rural districts, and by the poor in many\r\ncities. It is not, generally speaking, a penance imposed by the priest,\r\nbut a free-will offering to the Virgin, made on behalf of some one dear\r\nto the wearer. A woman will promise to wear the _hábito_ or penitential\r\nrobe for a specified number of months, or a year, or sometimes even for\r\nlife, if the Virgin will intercede for her invalid husband; or a girl\r\nwill undertake to wear nothing else until the dress is torn or worn past\r\nrepair, when the sacrifice is completed. A girl of seventeen explained\r\nthat she had volunteered to assume the _hábito_ she was wearing because\r\nher only sister was very ill.\r\n\r\n“But my sister got better and persuaded me to put it out of my head.\r\nThen she suddenly became very ill again; all one night she seemed to be\r\ndying, so I knew I must keep my promise to the Virgin, and after that I\r\nwould not let any of them put it out of my head.”\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards have two distinct ways of crossing themselves. One,\r\ndescribed by the verb _santiguar_, consists in making the sign of the\r\ncross with the first and middle finger from the forehead to the breast\r\nand from the left to the right shoulder, invoking the Trinity. The\r\nother, called _signar_, consists in making, with the thumb and first\r\nfinger crossed, or with the thumb alone, the sign of the cross on the\r\nforehead, mouth, and breast, praying God by the sign of our Redemption\r\nto deliver us from our enemies. In some parts a third method is often\r\nemployed, which peasants will tell you “is from the times of the Moors.”\r\nIn this the nose is touched as well as the forehead and mouth, with the\r\nthumb-nail, which is kissed at the end. The two forms are usually\r\ncombined (_persignarse_), and the invocation is divided as follows:\r\n\r\n    By    the sign of the Holy    Cross    from our\r\n    (forehead) (nose) (L. cheek) (R. cheek) (nose) (chin)\r\n\r\n    enemies       deliver us       Lord.\r\n    (L. cheek) (R. cheek)    (L. shoulder)    (R. shoulder)\r\n\r\n    In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\n       (breast)    (L. shoulder)    (R. shoulder)\r\n\r\n       Amen.\r\n    (thumb kissed).\r\n\r\nA good Catholic, say the peasants, must _persignarse_ thirty-three times\r\nin the course of the Mass, “and that would be very well if we understood\r\nthe language and knew why we were doing it.”\r\n\r\nIn the south people always take up a handful of water and cross\r\nthemselves before bathing in the sea or in a river, some even before\r\ntaking an ordinary bath at home. It will be remembered that the Moslem,\r\nwhen preparing for prayer, washes his nose, mouth, and ears, as well as\r\nhis hands and feet, and possibly this elaborate mode of making the sign\r\nof the cross may be a survival of the Moslem ceremonial of purification,\r\nespecially when combined with the water. One distinctly Islamic\r\ntradition is seen in the custom of touching anything unclean, if it has\r\nto be touched, with the left hand, the right being put behind the back.\r\nA woman of Andalusia when washing the dead for burial always begins\r\noperations with the left hand, just as the Moslem does, and will not use\r\nthe right until it becomes necessary. Thus it is not impossible that the\r\ncurious sign of the cross described, like the traditional reason for\r\ninsistence on infant baptism, even when the other offices of the Church\r\nare viewed with indifference, may be connected more or less closely, as\r\nthe peasants say, with Mohammedan practices.\r\n\r\nIn the south and west the peasants never put on clean underlinen without\r\nthe _persignar_, and previous to the crossing they recite the following\r\nprayer:\r\n\r\n“Blessed and washed be the most holy Sacrament of the Altar, pure and\r\nclean, of the always Virgin Mary, Our Lady, conceived without spot of\r\noriginal sin from the first instant of her most pure human nature.\r\nAmen.”\r\n\r\nNo matter how great their aversion from the Confessional and\r\nindifference to the offices of the Church, the most careless never omit\r\nthis invocation when they change their underclothes.\r\n\r\nAnother prayer, which is universal, reminds one of the--\r\n\r\n    “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,\r\n     Bless the bed that I lie on”\r\n\r\nof our own peasantry in bygone days. It runs thus:\r\n\r\n    “_Con Dios me acuesto,\r\n     Con Dios me levanto,\r\n     Con la Virgen Maria,\r\n     Y el Espíritu Santo_.”\r\n\r\n(“With God I lie down, with God I arise, with the Virgin\r\nMary, and the Holy Ghost.”)\r\n\r\nAs will be observed, the Virgin here takes the place of Christ in the\r\nTrinity. I have inquired of a number of people how the verse goes, and\r\nfind it does not vary. They say that evil would befall them if they\r\nfailed to recite the lines every morning and night.\r\n\r\nThe Radicals, Republicans, and Socialists, who are all branded alike as\r\natheists by the Ultramontanes, understand the people’s faith better than\r\ntheir priests do. The cry of the Church is that the nation is\r\nindifferent to all things holy. But men like Melquiades Alvarez, the\r\nnovelist Galdos, Sol y Ortega, and many other leaders of the Lefts,\r\ncontinually explain that the national quarrel is only with the priests\r\nand the Religious Orders, not with the Church as an institution, for\r\nthey recognise and proclaim that religion is an essential part of\r\nSpanish national life.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, no room for doubt that the mass of the people love\r\nGod, Christ, the Virgin, and the saints with a warmth and sincerity rare\r\nin these materialistic days. His God is a living God to the peasant of\r\nSpain, his Virgin a mother always prepared to protect him, her image and\r\nthose of the saints the most beautiful things in the world to his\r\nunsophisticated eyes. This may seem to the enfranchised intellect a\r\ndegrading superstition. But the fact remains that the religion of the\r\nworking classes of Spain in the mass does what many a more advanced\r\ncreed cannot do, for it carries conviction and comfort to its\r\npossessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFESSIONAL AND CHURCH ABUSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CONFESSIONAL AND CHURCH ABUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething must now be said about the way in which the people refer to\r\nthe confessional, and this I will endeavour to do in their own words,\r\npremising that I offer no opinion as to the truth or falsehood of their\r\nstories, most of which have been told me by women. The abuse of the\r\nconfessional is such a heinous sin that Catholics of other nations will\r\nnot believe what is currently said as to its prevalence in Spain; they\r\nhold that such things are impossible, and it is to be hoped, for the\r\nsake of the Church, that prejudice distorts the popular view, and that\r\nwhat the working classes in town and country assert to be of frequent\r\noccurrence does not in fact take place. But whatever be the actual\r\ntruth, it is impossible to doubt that the people are convinced that the\r\nconfessional is habitually abused, and this conviction--which nothing\r\ncan shake--constitutes a peril which must ultimately endanger the very\r\nexistence of the Church in this country.\r\n\r\nWhen first I was told, several years ago, that the secrets of the\r\nconfessional were betrayed, as a matter of course, in the interests of\r\nthe rich as against the poor, I flatly said that I did not believe it.\r\nThe thing was unthinkable to one brought up in the belief that such\r\nsecrets were inviolate. I was given actual instances of domestic\r\nservants sent to confession “so that the mistress might learn from the\r\npriest what the maid had been doing wrong.” As my informant was a young\r\nforeigner, born and bred a Catholic, in the employment of a family of\r\ntitle, and with a somewhat limited knowledge of Spanish, I found it\r\neasier to assume that he had misunderstood what was said in his presence\r\nthan to believe that he had accurately repeated his employer’s words,\r\nalthough he declared that the above remark had been made in his hearing\r\non several occasions. It should be said that he was in a house noted for\r\nits clerical leanings.\r\n\r\nA similar assertion was made to a member of my family by the daughter of\r\na professional man, better educated than most of her class, and touched\r\nwith the superficial scepticism prevalent among clever young Spaniards,\r\nwhose hatred of the priests and the Religious Orders tends to alienate\r\nthem altogether from the religion in which they were brought up. In this\r\ninstance I attributed the accusation to prejudice, and attached no more\r\nimportance to it than to the young man’s story. And as it is not a\r\nmatter that can be discussed with practising Catholics, the two\r\nmentioned, and one other, who confirmed their statements, are the only\r\neducated persons whose opinions I can quote.\r\n\r\nBut among the poor this offence is spoken of freely, and they accuse the\r\npriests, not only of betraying their trust by repeating what is told\r\nthem under the seal of the confessional, but also of using the\r\nopportunities it offers to ruin young and foolish women who obey the\r\nChurch’s order to confess with frequency. Indeed, many working men have\r\ngravely assured me that such is their distrust of the priests that\r\nnothing would induce them to allow their women-folk to go to confession\r\non any pretence whatever.\r\n\r\nThe following are some among many stories of this kind, which I give as\r\nthey were told me, only omitting the expressions of anger with which\r\nsome of them were punctuated:\r\n\r\n     “I was laundress in a priest’s house for several years. His sister\r\n     lived with him, and she really was his sister, for a wonder; not\r\n     the sort they generally call their ‘sisters.’ They also kept a\r\n     young girl to help in the house, for the priest was well off. One\r\n     day my fellow-servant committed a sin, for the devil tempted her to\r\n     steal a ring belonging to the Señora. But she could not rest happy\r\n     with it, and at last she went to a priest and confessed that she\r\n     had stolen it, and asked what she should do. He told her to put it\r\n     back, and gave her a penance. So she put it back. And the priest\r\n     went and told her mistress, and she sent the girl to prison.”\r\n\r\n     “There are several maidservants in the house of Doña Dolores, and\r\n     one of them goes to confession frequently. The others all have to\r\n     be very careful what they say before her, for the priest repeats it\r\n     all to Doña Dolores, and then it is ‘into the street’ with those\r\n     who have done anything silly or wrong in the kitchen or elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nA friend of mine--a foreigner--was begged by her servants not to engage\r\nan attractive-looking housemaid from one of the convent training schools\r\nwho applied for a situation. “She will repeat everything that is done in\r\nthe house to her priest, and he will make unpleasantness for you and us\r\ntoo. That is done every day here. We who have not had the misfortune to\r\nbe brought up in a convent never, if we can help it, take a situation\r\nwhere a convent-trained girl lives.”\r\n\r\n     “Juan Cabrito was hung through the priest telling the authorities\r\n     that he had confessed that he was a murderer. The priest went\r\n     straight to the Governor and told him everything Cabrito had said.\r\n     He well deserved hanging, and no one thought anything of the priest\r\n     betraying his confession. We are quite used to that in Spain.”\r\n\r\n     “I often used to be called in to help to wait in the evening in the\r\n     house of a priest who had a _tertulia_ for priests every week. His\r\n     niece kept house for him. I have often heard the priests laughing\r\n     and joking about the confessions of the nuns. They would imitate\r\n     their voices, speaking high up and whining: ‘Father, I lost my\r\n     temper and spoke harshly to the dog or the cat to-day.’ ‘How\r\n     tedious they are with their dogs and their cats and their tempers!’\r\n     the priest who confessed the nuns would say, and then they all\r\n     laughed together, very much amused. But it was wrong, for the\r\n     priest is forbidden to repeat a confession. I am not very fond of\r\n     the nuns myself, but I did not like to hear those coarse men\r\n     [_nombres brutos_] making jokes about their penitence.”\r\n\r\n     “It is many years since I have confessed. When I went to confess\r\n     before my wedding the priest asked me a question which no man\r\n     should put to a decent woman, so I never went again.”\r\n\r\n     “In my last situation my mistress made me go to Mass with her every\r\n     Sunday. I had to get up at five in the morning, so as to be back in\r\n     time to do my work in the house. Every Sunday she asked me if I had\r\n     confessed so that I might take the Communion, but I always told her\r\n     I had not had time and would confess next time. I will not go to\r\n     confession. I would rather lose my place.”\r\n\r\n     “It is true that I am over seventy, and it is very hard to earn my\r\n     bread and pay a penny a day for rent by picking up rags and rubbish\r\n     for sale. I am ill too: I have never been well since my daughter\r\n     ran away from me to live with a priest. But I do not wish to go\r\n     into the Asylum of the ---- Sisters. They not only make the poor\r\n     people there confess and communicate every day, but they make them\r\n     work quite as hard as I am working now. And in my own place, though\r\n     I may be hungry, at least I am not obliged to get up at six in the\r\n     morning to go to Mass, and then carry firewood for the convent, as\r\n     my poor old brother was.”\r\n\r\nIn another town in the diocese where the rag-picker lived, an old\r\nacquaintance of mine thankfully accepted an opportunity I was able to\r\nobtain for her, through friends, of entering an asylum for aged paupers,\r\nmanaged by nuns under the supervision of the municipality. That town has\r\nlong been markedly Liberal in its politics, and possibly this may have\r\nsomething to do with the more humane administration of the asylum. With\r\nthis instance in my mind I was surprised at the rag-picker’s rejection\r\nof a similar refuge for her old age, but further inquiries convinced me\r\nthat the rule of the one convent was in truth very different from that\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\n     “Every one knows that Higuero was the son of the Bishop, and that\r\n     was why they didn’t hang him. There was no doubt at all that he\r\n     murdered his paramour: he was caught almost in the act. How upset\r\n     the Bishop was! His son and his daughter married a brother and\r\n     sister, and both turned out badly, very badly. The son--Higuero was\r\n     his nickname--and the daughter’s husband--Pepita her name was--fell\r\n     in love with the same woman, and that was the cause of the murder.\r\n     If the Bishop had not used all his influence with the Government\r\n     Higuero would not have escaped hanging. He was taken away to ----\r\n     Prison, and no one ever heard of him again. Of course he was not\r\n     really taken to prison, he was allowed to escape. How did we know\r\n     he was the son of the Bishop? Very simply. His mother had been _ama\r\n     de gobierno_ [housekeeper] in the Bishop’s house before he was made\r\n     bishop. No, she was never married. She was well provided for, and\r\n     the children had some education, but they were bad from the\r\n     beginning. I lived for some years in the same tenement house with\r\n     them. Many of the priests’ children turn out ill. What can be\r\n     expected of the children of such bad men?”\r\n\r\nThese are a few out of hundreds of such stories told. _And the people\r\nbelieve they are true._\r\n\r\nCertain scandals, relating to the disappearance of valuable paintings\r\nfrom one Spanish cathedral or another, are familiar to all who travel in\r\nSpain. One such incident has always been a mystery to the outside world,\r\nowing to the seeming impossibility of a thief getting access to the\r\npicture in question, which was in a chapel in the cathedral, protected\r\nby a heavy grille extending from floor to ceiling, the door of which was\r\nalways kept locked.\r\n\r\nThe following explanation was given by the widow of a former cathedral\r\nservant:\r\n\r\n     “I know quite well how it was done. The assistant-keeper of the\r\n     keys was on duty that night, his superior having leave of absence\r\n     because his daughter was ill. The priest in charge of the chapel\r\n     made some excuse to take the keys from him that afternoon. Next day\r\n     he and several others were sent to prison, accused of having been\r\n     concerned in the theft. They were released in a week, for there was\r\n     no evidence against them, and the proof is that not one of them\r\n     lost his place. The priest soon after left the city. It was said\r\n     that he had been promoted, but no one ever heard of him again.” The\r\n     husband of the speaker was one of those accused.\r\n\r\nA scandal which gave rise to a question in the Cortes was the\r\ndisappearance of two valuable pictures from the Cathedral of Toledo. It\r\nappears that these pictures were in a chapel which had been built and\r\nendowed in the seventeenth century by a certain family. Two or three\r\nyears ago their descendants claimed these pictures as their private\r\nproperty, and entered into treaty to sell them to a “foreigner.” The\r\nState intervened, declaring the whole contents of the cathedral to be\r\ninviolate. Soon afterwards “it was found necessary to repair” the chapel\r\nin question, and the pictures were taken down “for safe custody”\r\nmeanwhile. What happened after that has never been cleared up, but a\r\n“foreigner” and a motor figure in the story, and the chapel is now\r\nwithout the pictures. No steps were ever taken, so far as the public\r\ncould learn, to bring the matter home to any one.\r\n\r\nThat quantities of valuable old laces and embroideries have disappeared\r\nfrom the cathedrals and parish churches of Spain there is no doubt. I\r\nknow of one case myself in which an antique chasuble was exchanged for\r\none of cheap jute imitating brocade. The explanation given was that the\r\nold one was worn out, but as it now figures in a private museum it is\r\ndifficult not to believe, as the people say, that some money changed\r\nhands with the chasuble.\r\n\r\nIn the cathedrals each canon had, until quite lately, entire control of\r\nthe chapel he served, and was responsible to no one for its contents.\r\nThe temptation to sell old lace and vestments and altar fittings, and to\r\nreplace them by new, was no doubt great, especially if there is any\r\ntruth in the popular belief that the priests in many cases maintain a\r\nhome and bring up families like men to whom marriage is not forbidden.\r\nAnd no one could bring him to book for any change made in the\r\nappointments of his chapel or (in the case of a parish priest) his\r\nchurch, because, as a rule, no one in authority over him knew what it\r\ncontained when he took possession. Even after his death it would\r\ngenerally be impossible to prove peculation, did the superior officers\r\nof the Church desire to do so, for it is a rare thing for any cathedral\r\nor church to keep an inventory of the valuables it is supposed to\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the priests in many cathedrals and parish churches allow\r\ntheir linen vestments and altar fittings to be taken away from the\r\nprecincts for laundry purposes. The facility with which valuable old\r\nlaces can be exchanged for modern machine-made stuff in these cases need\r\nnot be dwelt on.\r\n\r\nAnother opportunity for those who wished to profit by the sale of church\r\ntreasures was said to be afforded by the fact that fabrics, sometimes\r\nseveral centuries old, stand in occasional need of repair. I have heard\r\nthe “store-room” or “workshop” laughed at by employees of the church.\r\n\r\n“Once anything worth money goes into the store-room for repairs we never\r\nexpect to see it again.”\r\n\r\n“And where is this store-room?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know? The dealers in antiques can tell you.”\r\n\r\nThe hostility of the people towards the priests doubtless colours their\r\nviews in these as in all other matters relating to them. But it is a\r\nfact that a distinguished Spanish archæologist a few years ago was\r\nrefused further access to the archives of a certain cathedral after he\r\nhad asked the Chapter to permit him to publish an inventory of the\r\ntreasures under their charge. Now, I am glad to say there are at any\r\nrate some dioceses in which all this has been changed. The archbishops\r\nhave had the contents of the churches examined and catalogued, to the\r\nannoyance of certain persons, but to the satisfaction of the\r\nparishioners, who obtained no benefit from the sale of the Church\r\ntreasures under the old system.\r\n\r\nThe following incident was reported to the Press at the end of the year\r\n1909. I have not seen any contradiction published, and I give the story\r\nfor what it is worth.\r\n\r\nIn one of the great cities a certain church was condemned as unsafe, and\r\nthe congregation were told that ere long they would have to attend other\r\nchurches in the neighbourhood. One of the Religious Orders entered into\r\ntreaty for the purchase of the condemned building, in order to build on\r\nthe site. But nothing was settled, and as the danger of collapse was not\r\nimmediate the services continued to be conducted as usual. When the time\r\ncame to collect money for Masses to be said on All Souls’ Day, the\r\nparish priest found his usual request for alms refused, on the ground\r\nthat the ---- Brothers had already been round to say that the church was\r\ngiven up and its congregation attached to the Brothers’ Church in such a\r\nstreet, and this being so they had come to collect the payment for the\r\nAll Souls’ Masses, which was usually given to the parish priest. He\r\nindignantly reported the affair to his superiors, and so it got into the\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nIt was added that the priest declined to say the Masses for the dead, as\r\nhe had not been paid for them, and the ---- Brothers, although they got\r\nthe money, provided no special service for the congregation who had paid\r\nfor it. So that the souls for whom these poor folk had given their alms\r\nwill--in their belief--remain so much longer in purgatory. That the alms\r\nwere given by the poor, not by the rich of the parish, is evident from\r\nthe donors not knowing that their parish church still existed. The whole\r\naffair throws an instructive light on the relations of the poor with\r\ntheir Church or their parish priest. Had he been in the habit of\r\nvisiting them, or did they make a practice of attending Mass even\r\noccasionally, the mistake could never have arisen. But, as the story\r\nshows, the priest had no intercourse with his people save when he went\r\nto beg from them. The incident, even allowing a wide margin for\r\njournalistic exaggeration, goes a long way to support the assertion of\r\nthe woman who gave as her reason for not going to confession, that “the\r\npriest would only ask her for money, which she wanted more than he did.”\r\n\r\nOne more case, and I have done with this unattractive subject.\r\n\r\nSome twenty years ago a large dole to the poor, which had been given\r\nannually for about four centuries in a certain chapel, was suddenly cut\r\noff, and has never been renewed. It came out that the priest in charge\r\nhad sold the bonds in which the capital was invested, with the\r\nconnivance of a Government official in the Finance Department, and the\r\ntwo between them spent the money. The priest was convicted and\r\nimprisoned for a twelvemonth. Then he was released and appointed to\r\nanother church in the same diocese. My informant said he had been a\r\nwitness at the trial. “And to-day,” said he, “that bad man holds the\r\nsacred Elements in his hands, and gives the people his blessing. Such\r\nthings ought not to be allowed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POOR AND THE RELIGIOUS ORDERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE POOR AND THE RELIGIOUS ORDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy readers may be inclined to think that the Religious Orders are a kind\r\nof King Charles’ head, which I, a twentieth century Mr. Dick, am unable\r\nto keep out of this book. The truth is that in an attempt such as this\r\nto make intelligible the views and aspirations of the working classes of\r\nSpain, the Religious Orders are the central and dominating fact which\r\novershadows everything else. Whether we discuss the material condition\r\nof the poor, their education, their political disabilities, or whatever\r\nit may be, and make any attempt to analyse the matter and discover the\r\nreasons of their deplorably backward condition, we always get back to\r\nthe Religious Orders as the cause--if not in actual fact, at any rate in\r\nthe firm and unshakeable conviction of the people--of all their\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, in connection with the Religious Orders, that the\r\nposition of nearly all of them in Spain is illegal. According to the\r\nConcordat, made before the expulsion of Isabel II., the only Orders\r\nallowed in Spain are those of St. Vincent of Paul, St. Philip Neri, and\r\none other, to be nominated by the Pope by agreement with the Government,\r\nwhile all closed Orders of nuns are prohibited. The Pope has never yet\r\nnamed the third Order, and apparently no steps are ever taken to oblige\r\nhim to carry out his part of the bargain.\r\n\r\nI will now give--generally in the words of the narrators--typical\r\ninstances of the way in which the Religious Orders are said to interfere\r\nwith the livelihood of the working classes, and of the manner in which\r\nonce wealthy families have been brought to ruin through their\r\nmachinations.\r\n\r\nThe porter of a Jesuit college--for the servants of these institutions\r\nlove their employers no better than do their friends and relatives\r\noutside--told his brother, who told me, that every night during the\r\nfirst two or three weeks in August, 1909, after the Barcelona riots,\r\nrefugees were admitted to the college. At least eighty, he said, came in\r\nall. They slipped in secretly, after the lights were out, disguised in\r\nlay dress, often of the poorest description, having travelled half dead\r\nwith fear [_muertos de miedo_] from Cataluña. That the porter’s story\r\nwas true was proved by the large purchases of provisions made by the\r\ncollege during that month. A baker told me that the _frailes_ were more\r\ninsistent than ever that all the waste bread should be given to them\r\n“for the poor.” And, he added, the “good Fathers” were already buying\r\ntwice their usual supply of him. “The _frailes_ always demand all the\r\nbread we put by for the poor,” said my friend. “We would prefer to give\r\nit direct to the poor ourselves, for we do not feel sure how much of it\r\nthey get from the _frailes_, whose house-keepers are great hands at\r\nmaking _pasteles_ and _dulces_[7] for sale to good Catholic families.\r\nThese good Catholic families prefer to buy their _pasteles_ cheap from\r\nthe friars, who say that they are sold for the good of the Church. We do\r\nnot care to give our stale bread to be used in injuring the trade of our\r\ncompanions the confectioners; for the friars, having no taxes to pay,\r\ncan naturally undersell ordinary tradesmen, and all the more when they\r\nget the bread for their confectionery free. But if we said that we\r\nwished to give our bread to our own acquaintances among the poor, the\r\nJesuits would ruin us. They would tell all their clients that we were\r\nbad men and enemies of the Church, and we should lose all our trade. We\r\nknow this by experience. So we give our stale bread to the _frailes_\r\nand they let us live. But the poor are getting no bread from the\r\n_frailes_ since the Barcelona business.”\r\n\r\nDuring the disturbances in Cataluña it was said that “shiploads” of\r\nmonks and nuns were being landed in the middle of the night at sundry\r\nports along the coast, and that they so effectually betrayed themselves\r\nby their nervousness of manner that the country people had not the\r\nslightest doubt as to who and what they were. But as the people had no\r\ndesire to injure them personally--notwithstanding a certain amount of\r\ntalk about cutting throats and hanging--they were permitted to pass\r\nunmolested, though it is true that there were occasional scowls at\r\nill-clad individuals who wore their trousers “with a difference,” as\r\nthough they missed the flowing skirts of their cloth.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be remembered that at the very time that these frightened\r\nmen and women were travelling the country in disguise, numbers of\r\nfamilies were sorrowfully bidding farewell to sons, brothers, and\r\nhusbands, on their departure to the war which, as the people will always\r\nbelieve, was begun in the interest of Jesuit capitalists, sheltering\r\ntheir ownership of the Morocco mines and the great steamer companies\r\nbehind the names of lay millionaires.\r\n\r\nThe popular suspicion of Jesuit interference in these, as in almost all\r\nthe other big commercial concerns in the Peninsula, may or may not be\r\njustified, but its effect on the attitude of the people towards the\r\nReligious Orders cannot be over-rated. Not the least extraordinary\r\nfeature in the situation is that the Religious Orders profess to\r\ndisregard the feeling that exists against them, although it is apparent\r\non every hand to any one who goes about with eyes and ears open.\r\n\r\nFor years past I have noticed that no member of the working classes\r\nsalutes a priest or friar in the streets. Day after day one summer I saw\r\nthe same priests taking their afternoon walk along the same by-way,\r\nwhere the same artisans, to the number of twenty or thirty, watched the\r\n“long skirts” from the doors of their workshops. I never saw an artisan\r\ngreet a priest or friar, or vice versa. The flowing robes of the\r\necclesiastics swept against the patched garments of the workmen, but no\r\nglance was exchanged. The priests kept their eyes bent on the ground,\r\none hand grasping the skirts and the other pressed on the breast, a\r\ntypical attitude, which is jeered at by the poor as “canting.” The\r\nworkmen kept their eyes fixed on the work on which they were engaged. It\r\nis impossible to imagine anything more hostile than the silent defiance\r\nof the men, as they turned to watch the “long skirts” out of sight. I\r\nhave seen single instances of the same thing elsewhere in many places,\r\nbut here I had special facilities for observing the daily exhibition of\r\narmed neutrality, owing to the accident of my room at the back of the\r\nlittle country hotel looking out on the by-path. “I hate to see them,”\r\none of the men said to me; “they are the ruin of us and our country.”\r\nWhat made it the more significant was that these same workmen had a\r\npleasant word of greeting for every lay person, man or woman,\r\nacquaintance or stranger, who passed by them.\r\n\r\nThe economic question bulks largely among the causes of the popular\r\nhostility to the Religious Orders, and if only half the complaints\r\ngenerally made are based on fact, the people have reason on their side.\r\n\r\nFormerly, say the women, it was easy to obtain a day’s wage by washing\r\nin well-to-do houses, and a laundress could make a decent living. Now in\r\nevery town of any importance there are one or more convents called\r\n“Domestic Colleges,” where orphans or servants out of place are\r\nreceived, and these girls repay the nuns for their board and lodging by\r\ndoing laundry-work for rich Catholic families. If the girls were allowed\r\nto keep even a portion of what they earn, the women say that they would\r\nnot feel the system to be so unjust. But they declare that this is not\r\nthe case. Whatever is paid goes to the nuns, and as they, having no\r\ntaxes or wages to pay, can undersell the laundresses, who are called\r\nupon to provide both charges, the lay laundry trade is steadily\r\ndeclining, although the quality of the work is on a par with that done\r\nin the convents.\r\n\r\nThe nuns teach their protégées every class of needlework, lace-making,\r\nand a kind of embroidery or net-work which is largely used for priests’\r\nvestments, altar-cloths, &c. This competition, which was one of the\r\nreasons given for the presence of women (if, indeed, they were present)\r\nin the attack on the convents in Barcelona, is felt in every part of\r\nSpain, but perhaps especially in the south and south-west, where skilled\r\nneedlework, which is almost the only employment of women above the\r\ndomestic servant class, is exceedingly common and badly paid at best.\r\nNowadays, say such women, it is increasingly difficult to obtain\r\nemployment of this kind at any price, owing to the quantity done in the\r\nconvents and the reduced prices at which the nuns undertake it.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, although this does not so directly affect women, the nuns\r\ndo a large trade in the sweetmeats and _patisserie_ already referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe grievances against the nuns, then, are chiefly related to their\r\ninterference with the industrial market, and this, although a very real\r\nsource of hardship, has not yet, except in a few isolated instances,\r\ngiven birth to anything like the active hostility that is expressed\r\nagainst the male Religious Orders. The closed Orders of nuns are\r\nregarded with aversion and contempt, as living at the expense of the\r\nnation and leading lives which, to the working classes, seem purely idle\r\nand self-indulgent--“doing nothing all day but pray for their own souls,\r\nor worse,” as they describe the life of contemplation. I have never\r\nheard working women express any desire to injure the nuns, much though\r\nthey dislike them as a class. But when we come to the Jesuits, Maristas,\r\nCarmelites, Franciscans, Dominicans, and all the long list of Orders\r\nlumped together in one condemnation by both men and women under the\r\nderisive name of “long skirts” (_sayones_), we find a much worse state\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\nThe people declare that in many places the leading industries have been\r\ncompletely ruined by the competition of persons in the employ of the\r\nJesuits--for they call all the friars indiscriminately Jesuits, although\r\nthey are perfectly aware of the distinctions between the various Orders.\r\nAnd they will point out to you one family after another who have been\r\nreduced to penury by the “good Fathers,” and will relate innumerable\r\ninstances of the methods they believe to have been employed to this end.\r\nPerhaps the best way to explain these will be to give a literal\r\ntranslation of one or two of the stories I have heard from the people,\r\nwhich, told as they are with an absolute conviction of their truth, show\r\nwhat ground the working classes have for distrusting and detesting those\r\nwho ought to set an example of virtue and self-abnegation.\r\n\r\n“A man I know saved 5,000 _duros_ [about £1,000], and he lent it all to\r\nthe Jesuits for a building they were putting up, a building attached to\r\nthe monastery, so that he looked upon it as a work for God. Some years\r\nwent by, and my friend was growing old and wished to retire from his\r\nlittle business and live on his capital. So he asked the Jesuits to\r\nrepay his loan. ‘Oh, no!’ they said, ‘do you not know, my son, that he\r\nwho lends to God must expect no return? A loan to God is a gift for the\r\nsalvation of thy soul.’ As I say, he was an old man, and he found\r\nhimself ruined, without hope of earning more money. He left the good\r\nFathers and went and cut his throat.”\r\n\r\n     “Why is the old Marquesa de Fulano starving? I will tell you. When\r\n     her father, the last Marquis, was dying, the Jesuits never left him\r\n     for a moment, and at last they persuaded him that his soul was of\r\n     more consequence than his daughter’s livelihood, and he made a will\r\n     by which he left all his money to found a college for boys in ----.\r\n     When he was dead his daughter discovered that all she had was the\r\n     family land, and not a farthing of the capital her father had\r\n     invested. Soon afterwards a famine came, and there was no rain for\r\n     nine months. The Marquesa gave food to all the labourers on the\r\n     estate, although there was no work for them, for she is a very\r\n     charitable lady. She spent all the money she had, and then sold all\r\n     her jewels and other valuables to buy them food. You see, she is a\r\n     widow without family to advise and help her. Of course she was too\r\n     proud to betray her poverty, but even if she had told her friends\r\n     they could have done nothing, for many landowners were ruined that\r\n     year. Now the estate is mortgaged to the last acre, and she has\r\n     sold everything she has and is almost without food for herself. If\r\n     you wish to hear about the Jesuits, ask the Marquesa de Fulano! And\r\n     you will understand that all the people employed on the estate lost\r\n     their livelihood too, for it is now long since she has been able to\r\n     afford to have it cultivated.”\r\n\r\n     “Yes, it is a pity to see that fine old oil-mill falling to ruin.\r\n     It used to belong to a very rich man, but when he died the Jesuits\r\n     got hold of his widow and induced her to build a large new chapel\r\n     in the monastery of ----. Millions of pesetas they squeezed out of\r\n     her for the work, and when it was finished, there was nothing left\r\n     of the business. One of the sons meanwhile became a Jesuit, and as\r\n     they have a big business in oil over there he naturally took the\r\n     olive-groves for his share of the property. This happened twenty\r\n     years ago: the younger brothers are married and have children to\r\n     bring up. They have to earn their bread as they can. One of them\r\n     rents ten acres and cultivates them himself, so he does not starve,\r\n     but the other poor fellow has taken to drink, and he and his family\r\n     mostly go hungry. It is all the work of the Jesuits.”\r\n\r\nThere are many such stories of gifts made to the Church _in articulo\r\nmortis_. The priests are said to urge the dying penitent to save his\r\nsoul by benefiting the Religious Orders instead of providing for his\r\nfamily, on the ground that if he acts as his duty and instincts dictate\r\nhe will lengthen his stay in purgatory. There seems no room for doubt\r\nthat many once wealthy families have been reduced to poverty in\r\nconsequence of such legacies to the Church. Indeed, it almost seems as\r\nif a new class of society is gradually arising among the very people who\r\nformerly were the strongest supporters of the Church--people of good\r\nbirth and gentle breeding, with a family tradition of injury at the\r\nhands of the Jesuits, which has alienated them for ever from a Church to\r\nwhich they owe their worldly misfortunes, and is converting them into\r\nearnest recruits to the cause of Free Thought. From these men of gentle\r\nbreeding will eventually come the leaders of the people in their final\r\nstruggle against the Ultramontanes.\r\n\r\nThe ways which the Jesuits are reputed to employ in order to ruin those\r\nwho defy them are many. The following story shows how easily it can be\r\ndone, if it is true that the Company of Jesus condescends to such\r\ncontemptible action against the industrial and working classes.\r\n\r\n     “Francisco Mengano used to have a very good business. He employed\r\n     nine men to work for him. But he hated the friars, and he used to\r\n     talk against them to a man who pretended to think as he did and\r\n     came to sit with him every day, and encouraged him to say he would\r\n     never let his daughters go to confession because he was afraid the\r\n     priest would make love to them, and many other things. That vile\r\n     man always talked in the same sort of way himself, and poor\r\n     Francisco looked upon him as a friend. But when his eldest girl was\r\n     old enough for her first Communion and Francisco refused to let her\r\n     go to confession, he discovered that the man he trusted was himself\r\n     a Jesuit, and had told the Jesuits everything Francisco had said.\r\n     They waited to be sure his daughter was not going to confession,\r\n     and then set to work to ruin him. It was quite simple. He was a\r\n     cart-builder and wheelwright, and depended on the landowners in the\r\n     neighbourhood for most of his work. The Jesuits merely sent word\r\n     round that he was charging too much and doing bad work, and his\r\n     trade was ruined and he became what you see--a poor old jobbing\r\n     carpenter, who cannot even afford to employ a boy to do his heavy\r\n     work.”\r\n\r\nWhen I heard this story I recollected that about a year earlier, when\r\npassing Francisco’s workshop in company with a gentleman reputed to be\r\nfriendly with the Jesuits, he had remarked, _apropos des bottes_, “Don’t\r\nemploy Francisco if you should want any carpentering done; his work is\r\nbad and he overcharges abominably.” It naturally did not occur to me\r\nthat this observation could have any other object than to save me, as a\r\nforeigner, from being cheated, and, all unconscious of what I afterwards\r\ndiscovered to be its injustice, I gave my work elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNot only do the people accuse the Religious Orders of depriving them of\r\nemployment by underselling them and destroying their trade by slanders,\r\nbut they also bring grave charges of indifference, if not actual\r\nbrutality, to the poor who ask them for help of any kind.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a fact that no assistance was volunteered by any\r\nReligious House during the epidemic of typhus in Madrid in 1909. In\r\nanother town, where a seminary for priests was temporarily converted\r\ninto a hospital for the sick and wounded from Melilla, the cisterns ran\r\ndry one night owing to the unusual quantity of water used for the\r\ninvalids. Not a man or a boy among the seminarists would take the\r\ntrouble to pump more water, though a quarter of an hour’s work would\r\nhave done all that was needed for the time, so workmen had to be fetched\r\nin the middle of the night to supply what was immediately required for\r\nthe sufferers. This I heard from one of the men who did the work.\r\n\r\nThe working classes have as yet no plan of campaign against the\r\nReligious Orders. They are waiting in the hope that at no distant day\r\nthey will have the suffrage in fact, not, as at present, in name only.\r\nBut the bitterness of their hostility may be judged from the following\r\nincident, related to me by an eye-witness.\r\n\r\nThree country people, dealers in charcoal, were sitting in a tramcar. My\r\ninformant was sitting immediately behind them, and at his side was a\r\npriest. One of the charcoal-merchants, pretending to be unaware of the\r\npriest’s presence, related how he had been overtaken by night on the\r\nmountains, where he was buying wood in pursuit of his trade, and how he\r\nhad gone to a large Jesuit college standing alone on the hillside, to\r\nask permission to sleep under the portico, the season being mid-winter\r\nand the weather bitterly cold. The “good Father” who opened the door at\r\nhis knock refused to admit him, telling him that “the college was not a\r\nhouse of call for tramps, and he could go and sleep under a tree by the\r\nroadside.” The narrator had no option but to do this, for the door was\r\nshut in his face, and “he thought he would have died of cold before\r\nmorning.” “I wish,” he concluded, “that all the _frailes_ in Spain would\r\ncome to my house some cold night and ask for shelter. Before morning I\r\nwould leave every one of them under my trees with his throat cut.”\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the charcoal merchant uttered his theatrical threat\r\non purpose to frighten the priest, and if that was his object he\r\ncertainly succeeded, for the poor man turned white and trembled with\r\nalarm; but it is certain that no one of his class would have dared to\r\nexpress such sentiments before a priest or a monk previous to the\r\nBarcelona affair.\r\n\r\nI have heard a gentle-looking old woman say deliberately: “I wish all\r\nthe _frailes_ were going out to be shot this morning! How I should enjoy\r\nseeing them killed!”\r\n\r\nAnd I have heard an artisan remark as a couple of “long skirts” went by:\r\n\r\n“How I hate those vermin! It makes me sick to see them near me.”\r\n\r\nThe people who say these things are not Socialists nor Anarchists, nor\r\neven Republicans. They are decent, quiet, industrious working people,\r\nwho know and care little about current politics, and simply judge of the\r\npriests and the Religious Orders by what they see. Once the confidence\r\nof such people is won, you will hear similar remarks by the score\r\nwherever two or three of the working class are gathered together,\r\nwhether in town or country. Nor are their wives and daughters one whit\r\nbehind the men in their expressions of hostility.\r\n\r\nHere is an outburst which I took down word for word from a clever but\r\nquite illiterate working woman. The reference to the “ovens,” as will be\r\nseen, tallies with what I have quoted about the bakers, although the\r\nspeakers were in different provinces, far apart.\r\n\r\n     “While we have that lot here we cannot live. The alms which ought\r\n     to be given to the poor are given to them. I don’t believe they\r\n     give to the poor the bread which they beg from the ovens. I believe\r\n     they use it all to make _alforjillas_ and _piñonates_ for sale.[8]\r\n     They cannot make them without bread. The Jesuits do not make them\r\n     themselves. All the monasteries keep _amas de gobierno_[9] to cook\r\n     and wash and mend and do everything required. They are quite\r\n     independent, answerable to nobody. They eat us up as if they were\r\n     ants. They let no one live, meddling with everything that doesn’t\r\n     concern them. They tack themselves to a lady, an acquaintance, and\r\n     she has linen to launder, and they order her to send it at once to\r\n     be washed in one of the [religious] houses where poor unfortunates\r\n     are taken in. Many of them are the children of the friars\r\n     themselves and of the priests. There is a family in ---- Street whom\r\n     they call ‘Curitas,’ five brothers and sisters, all children of one\r\n     parish priest [_cura_]. Their ‘Uncle Cura,’ as they called him,\r\n     brought them up and educated them and left them all he possessed.\r\n     They were all the children of one mother; it was the same as if the\r\n     priest had been married to her. He lived with her and maintained\r\n     her all his life. But that is a great sin for the priest! They say\r\n     that in your country the priests are allowed to marry. If it were\r\n     the same here the Church would be purged of many sins, for all the\r\n     priests live with women. If they are faithful to one woman I do not\r\n     see what sin there is in it. It is natural. But it is more usual\r\n     for them to have many women. I know that one old priest had at\r\n     least ten or twelve children in ---- [a low quarter of the town], all\r\n     by different women. He brought them all up, and gave them every\r\n     year enough for their food. He was very rich. They called him ‘the\r\n     Prior.’ The mothers said to the children: ‘Run along; the Prior\r\n     will give thee money to buy food.’ I know this because my father\r\n     used to work for him. The priest often said to him: ‘Look, what\r\n     pretty children mine are!’ He was not in the least ashamed of\r\n     owning that they were his.”\r\n\r\nAnd here is another statement made by the father of growing lads whom he\r\nwas educating as best he could to try for appointments in the Civil\r\nService.\r\n\r\n     “You should be careful not to say anything about the Jesuits in\r\n     those letters you are always writing,” he said. “In Madrid or\r\n     Barcelona it may be all very well, but in a little country town\r\n     like this you can never be sure how much the ‘good Fathers’ will\r\n     find out. It is well known that Paco, who attends to the registered\r\n     letters here, is the son of a Jesuit. Many of the clerks in the\r\n     post-offices are the sons of priests or _frailes_, and that is why\r\n     honest lads like my sons have no chance of getting a place there.\r\n     The Jesuits have a plan by which their sons slip in without the\r\n     examination imposed on others. Do you think that fool Paco would be\r\n     where he is if he had had to pass a competitive examination? But be\r\n     warned! He has been clever enough to learn how to open letters and\r\n     seal them up again. The ‘good Fathers’ have taken care of that. And\r\n     if they suspect that you write stories about them, they will take\r\n     care to read your letters before they leave the post-office.”\r\n\r\nIn this connection I may mention a curious incident. A book sent to me\r\nfrom England went astray, and some six months later, after inquiry made\r\nby the English post-office, reached me minus its wrapper, with a note of\r\napology from the local post-office, explaining that it had been\r\nrecovered from a Jesuit college at least fifty miles from the place to\r\nwhich it had been addressed and registered by the publisher. Why it was\r\ndelivered at the college instead of to me was not explained. I thought\r\nat the time it was merely a piece of characteristic Spanish\r\ncarelessness, but I was reminded of the occurrence by my friend’s\r\nremarks about “Paco” and the post-office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHY AND THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN AND THE QUEEN-MOTHER OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\n[To face page 111.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHY AND THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Spain at large had attributed the misfortunes of 1909--the war in\r\nMelilla, the outbreak in Cataluña, the suspension of the Constitution,\r\nthe attacks on the country made by the foreign Press--to the influence\r\nof Don Alfonso, the throne would have been in greater danger than at any\r\ntime since the expulsion of Isabel II., for the whole nation was roused\r\nto indignation by the general conduct of the Clericalist Ministry then\r\nin power.\r\n\r\nBut happily for Spain, and indeed for Europe, since civil war in the\r\nPeninsula would be an European disaster, not even the most violent of\r\nthe Republicans or Socialists taxed the King, the Queen, or any member\r\nof the Royal Family with indifference to the feelings of the people or a\r\ndisregard of the sufferings of the poor.\r\n\r\nA fact not recognised in England is the extent to which conscription\r\ntends to consolidate the Monarchy in a country where the King, the head\r\nof the Army, enjoys personal popularity among his working-class\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nUnder an unpopular ruler conscription would probably lend itself to the\r\nspeedy establishment of a Republic. But every year that King Alfonso\r\nlives he binds the Army, which is the very flesh and blood of the\r\nnation, more firmly to himself by ties of personal affection. And\r\npersonal affection is a stronger force than political conviction alone\r\never has been or ever can be.\r\n\r\nIn the seventies the Army stood for liberty and the Republic against\r\nCarlism and Ultramontanism, until Alfonso XII. was brought from his\r\nEnglish college and offered to the nation which had seen his mother\r\ndethroned, as the mass of the nation always will believe, at the\r\ninstigation of the Church. It was his mother’s personal popularity with\r\nthe masses which made her son’s path comparatively smooth,\r\nnotwithstanding the chaos of conflicting interests among which his lot\r\nwas cast. His own honesty of purpose, his devotion to his people’s\r\nwelfare, the Spartan simplicity of his private life, and the personal\r\ncharm which he, in common with all his race, possessed, gave him a\r\nhigher place in the affections of the nation than is at all realised\r\noutside of Spain, and the greatest hope expressed for King Alfonso XIII.\r\nby the poor is that he may take after his father. “He was a _man_,”\r\nthey say. It was for the father’s sake that all parties agreed to call a\r\ntruce during the anxious months that followed on his premature death,\r\nuntil his son was born, and it would be difficult to say how many times,\r\nwhile Queen Maria Cristina held the reins of Regency, the memory of her\r\ndead husband may have turned the tide in favour of their child, when the\r\nUltramontanes would have used the national unrest to the profit of the\r\nproscribed branch.\r\n\r\nFrom the day that Alfonso XII. breathed his last, the Ultramontanes have\r\nconsistently tried to represent the Queen Mother as closely attached to\r\ntheir party. The accusation is manifestly absurd. No mother would\r\nsupport a policy directed in the interests of a Pretender before that\r\nwhich maintains the rights of her own son. It is, indeed, a matter of\r\nhistory that in order to give the Opposition no excuse for agitation,\r\nCanovas, with true patriotism, recommended the grief-stricken Regent in\r\nthe early days of her widowhood to entrust the Government to his\r\nopponents, the Liberals under Sagasta, in order to avoid a contest, so\r\nthat to the latter fell the duty of proclaiming to the waiting nation\r\nthe birth of Alfonso XIII., on May 17, 1886.[10] Canovas would not have\r\nacted thus had there been any real doubts of the loyalty of the Liberal\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe _Imparcial_, in an article dealing with Señor Maura’s assertion,\r\nimmediately after his fall in 1909, that the Conservatives are the only\r\nbulwark against revolution and the only support of the Throne, recalled\r\nthis fact, and added that “without the Liberals the Throne would not\r\nexist now, because the Liberals rescued it from revolution after it had\r\nbeen shaken by the bloody attacks of Carlism. Without Sagasta, without\r\nCastelar, the Spanish monarchy would not be.”\r\n\r\nYet so persistently has the story of the Queen Mother’s clericalist\r\nleanings been repeated by those interested in its acceptance during the\r\ntwenty-three years that King Alfonso XIII. has been on the throne, that\r\nthe mass of the people still believe that she defers to the Jesuits even\r\nin matters in which their interference cannot fail to injure the King in\r\nthe eyes of his people--a preposterous misconception, which cannot be\r\ncorrected too soon. Quite lately I heard a working woman say:\r\n\r\n     “She cannot be a Jesuit, as they say. A Jesuit mother could not\r\n     have borne such children as hers. Look at the King! He has none too\r\n     much love for the _curas_ (priests). Yet we have always been told\r\n     that Queen Cristina is a Jesuit! Why should that be said? These are\r\n     _cosas de los frailes_ (doings of the friars) ‘said to make us\r\n     dislike her.’”\r\n\r\nIn one town where I had some acquaintances among the clergy, I was\r\nstruck by the malicious things that were said by them about the young\r\nQueen, and especially about her relations with the Queen Mother. Not\r\nlong before I went there I happened to have heard a very pleasant\r\naccount of the private life of the Royal Family from a foreigner,\r\nentirely outside of politics, who was for a short time employed in one\r\nof the palaces while the Royal Family were in residence. His description\r\nleft no doubt at all as to the happiness of their home life.\r\n\r\nWith this in my mind I did not feel greatly concerned at being informed\r\nby various Ultramontanes that “Queen Victoria was on the worst terms\r\nwith the Queen Mother, who had never forgiven her for having been\r\nbrought up a Protestant,” and that “Maura had refused to let her go to\r\nEngland after the Barcelona affair, because she was so miserable in\r\nMadrid that she had declared she would never return to Spain if once she\r\ngot back to her own country.”\r\n\r\nNo one who has seen the young King and Queen together believes this kind\r\nof thing, although it has been repeated in clericalist circles ever\r\nsince the marriage. But, unfortunately, comparatively few of their\r\nsubjects have the opportunity of seeing them, and during the last\r\nhalf-year of the Maura administration photographs and picture postcards\r\nof the Royal Family, which formerly were on sale everywhere, became\r\nnoticeably absent. Throughout the three months that the press was\r\ncensured it was almost impossible to find an illustrated paper\r\ncontaining any picture of the King, the Queen, the Queen Mother, the\r\nInfanta Maria Teresa, or the Royal children. During that time everything\r\nthat could tend to recall the King and Queen to the minds of the people\r\nand increase their popularity was suppressed. My attention was first\r\ncalled to this state of affairs by finding that in one large town not a\r\nsingle picture postcard of King Alfonso could be bought. The shops had\r\nsold out their last year’s stock, and no new photographs of any kind had\r\nbeen issued since the war broke out.\r\n\r\nIt would have been natural that portraits of the Queen should appear in\r\nconnection with the War Fund initiated by her Majesty and taken up with\r\nenthusiasm all over the country. But no. A portrait and several pictures\r\nof the Marquesa de Squilache, who acted as honorary secretary, were\r\npublished, showing that lady at work in her office, distributing money\r\nto applicants, &c. But I have not been able to discover that any such\r\npictures appeared with the young Queen as the central figure. The\r\nMarquesa de Squilache is a philanthropist whose fame deservedly extends\r\nall over Spain, and the admirable organisation of the fund was certainly\r\ndue in a great measure to her clear-headed and business-like methods.\r\nBut she would be the first to acknowledge that the Queen, and not\r\nherself, should have been represented in the picture-papers as the head\r\nand front of this effort to alleviate the misery caused by the war. It\r\nis difficult to believe that the marked omission of her Majesty’s\r\nportrait in the illustrated papers during the clericalist\r\nPress-censorship was accidental, while at the same time a series of\r\nthirty-six postcards of Don Jaime of Bourbon in the Castle of Frohsdorf\r\nwas being freely advertised in Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe War Fund, initiated and presided over by the young Queen, was\r\nperhaps the first charitable appeal ever issued direct from the Court to\r\nthe nation, without the intervention of the Church. At first it was\r\nstated that applicants for relief from this Fund must bring certificates\r\nof birth, baptism, marriage, &c., from their parish priests.[11] But\r\nthe _Heraldo_, one of the leading Liberal-Monarchist papers, pointed out\r\nthat such a condition would deprive all those who had been married by\r\nthe civil authority of participation in the Fund, and put in a further\r\nplea for the children of soldiers not born in wedlock. The Queen and her\r\ncommittee of ladies decided on the widest interpretation of the family\r\nlimitation, and at an early stage in the war relief was given to a child\r\nwhose father was at the front, although the mother did not bear his\r\nname. This broadly charitable decision commended the Fund warmly to the\r\nmass of the people, for, as already shown, the prohibitive cost of the\r\nmarriage licence in many, if not all, the Spanish dioceses compels\r\nnumbers of decent couples to use the civil rite or none. Thus the\r\ndecided action taken by, the Queen and her committee, notwithstanding\r\nthe recommendations of the Church, endeared Queen Victoria Eugénie to\r\nthousands of mothers who, if the first conditions proposed had been made\r\nobligatory, would have been without the pale.\r\n\r\nThe interminable lists of subscribers, appearing day after day and week\r\nafter week, and the innumerable small subscriptions, often not exceeding\r\nten centimes, and sometimes falling as low as five, proved how\r\nwhole-heartedly the poor gave of their penury, and various incidents\r\nwhich occurred showed a real spirit of self-sacrifice in the\r\nwage-earners. Such was the action of the cigarette-makers of Seville,\r\nthe two thousand women of all ages whose fame has been so often sung in\r\nthe opera of “Carmen.” They were ordered to make up several thousand\r\nboxes of cigarettes with the legend “For the Army at Melilla.” They\r\nimmediately asked to be allowed to do the whole work gratis as a tribute\r\nto the Army; and on being informed that this could not be permitted,\r\nbecause the consignment was a gift to the troops from the Company which\r\nrents the tobacco rights from the Crown, the _cigarreras_ volunteered to\r\nforfeit a whole day’s pay, to be given to the Queen’s Fund for the\r\nWounded. Numbers of these women are mothers of families, and many of\r\nthem have only three or four days’ work weekly, at a wage ranging from\r\n75 centimes to pesetas 1.50, so that a whole day’s pay was a serious\r\nconsideration to them. Nor were they by any means alone in their\r\ngenerosity, for many industrial guilds, companies, trade unions, and\r\ncivil servants, such as, _e.g._, the minor post-office officials and\r\ntelegraph operators, also gave a day’s wage.\r\n\r\nJudging from the results of previous appeals to the public for\r\ncharitable purposes, it is safe to say that the enthusiastic response to\r\nthe Queen’s Fund was due in a great measure to the national confidence\r\nthat the money would be well and wisely administered under her Majesty’s\r\nauspices, for it is a melancholy fact that similar confidence is not\r\nfelt by the poor in the case of subscriptions raised under the patronage\r\nof the Church.\r\n\r\nI have quoted at random a few observations from among many betraying\r\nanimus against her Majesty on the part of the priests. Here is another,\r\nwhich shows why they dislike the young Queen so much. I met one day in a\r\nmountain village a Franciscan friar who had come from a neighbouring\r\ncity to deliver a course of sermons. He mistook me for a Frenchman, and\r\ntherefore had the less hesitation in enlarging upon the evils that the\r\nKing’s marriage would bring upon the country. One remark particularly\r\nimpressed me, as expressing in a few words the attitude of the Church\r\ntowards education.\r\n\r\n“She will do untold harm by trying to introduce her English ideas about\r\nthe education of women. The women of Spain have quite as much education\r\nas is good for them. More would only do them harm.”\r\n\r\nIn this connection it seems worth while to mention that what most\r\nappealed to the working women (who certainly are not over-burdened with\r\neducation) in relation to the birth of the Prince of Asturias was the\r\nannouncement that the Queen intended to nurse her baby herself, instead\r\nof following the old-fashioned custom, universal among the upper\r\nclasses, of employing a wet-nurse. This is not the place to discuss the\r\nunhappy, results of the system on the general health and morale of the\r\nnation. But the announcement was seized upon by the poor as bringing the\r\nroyal mother into close contact with themselves.\r\n\r\n“Have you heard that she is suckling her child, just as we do?”\r\n\r\nAnd when soon after it was stated that “owing to the Queen’s state of\r\nhealth, and having regard to the duties of her position” the infant\r\nPrince had been handed over to a wet-nurse like any other rich man’s\r\nchild, a sigh of disappointment went up.\r\n\r\n“You see, the doctors would not let her do as she wished. Health?\r\nRubbish! Any one can see that she is the picture of health. But what\r\nwould become of the commissions the doctors get from the wet-nurses for\r\nrecommending them if the Queen put wet-nursing out of fashion?”\r\n\r\nThe Queen was not blamed for relinquishing her maternal duties. Every\r\npoor mother believed that she would have nursed her baby, had the\r\ndecision rested with her. This is characteristic of the attitude of the\r\nmass of the people towards both the King and the Queen. Whatever they do\r\nthat is worthy of respect and admiration is taken as fresh evidence of\r\ntheir intrinsic virtues. But whatever happens in regard to them that\r\ndoes not please the country people is attributed to the malign influence\r\nof those who stand between them and their subjects.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the popular comments on the announcement that Don\r\nAlfonso was not going to Melilla, among which this was one:\r\n\r\n“Do we not know that he is dying to go? He is young and brave, and he\r\nloves our soldiers. It is Maura who forbids him to go to the war.”\r\n\r\nA suggestive remark was made by a journeyman plumber with whom I had a\r\nlong conversation while the war was at its height.\r\n\r\n“No doubt he would have liked to lead the Army. He is brave enough. But\r\nkings are too expensive to be risked in that way. If we have a king he\r\nmay as well be taken care of.”\r\n\r\n“You do not seem a very enthusiastic Monarchist,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I? Monarchist! I am republican to the bones.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Then I suppose you would like to turn Don Alfonso out of the\r\ncountry?”\r\n\r\n“I? Why? What harm has that boy done me? Everybody likes him.”\r\n\r\nAnd he seemed quite puzzled by the smile I found it impossible to\r\nrepress at this exposition of “republicanism to the bones.”\r\n\r\nFor fully a year before the fall of the Maura Ministry anecdotes of the\r\ncharity and generosity shown by the King, the Queen, and the Royal\r\nFamily were growing rarer in the papers which had formerly supplied\r\nthese little pieces of information to the many people who like thus to\r\nbe brought into contact with the home life of their rulers. The omission\r\nwas introduced so gradually that at first no one noticed it. But when\r\nsoldiers returning from the war talked of gifts sent out by the Queen,\r\nand other evidences of active sympathy shown by the Royal Family, it was\r\nrealised that no steps had been taken to make these things known to the\r\npublic at home. The King’s gift of thirty thousand solar topees out of\r\nhis private purse was one instance. The Queen’s present of thousands of\r\nwarm vests to wear under the uniform was another. Queen Maria-Cristina,\r\nand the Infanta Maria Teresa (who by her gentleness and unassuming\r\nmanner has won for herself an affectionate nickname among the poor of\r\nMadrid), as well as the Infantas Doña Isabel, Doña Paz (Princess Louis\r\nof Bavaria) and Doña Eulalia, the King’s aunts, all devoted themselves\r\nduring the war to working with their own hands for the soldiers, besides\r\ngiving generously to the Queen’s fund, but not a word of this appeared\r\nin any of the papers. I heard something of their work from private\r\nsources: the public heard nothing.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that the ladies of the Royal Family, who are\r\ninstinct with patriotism and love of their fellow-countrymen, may have\r\npreferred that their charities should pass unpraised by the nation. But\r\neven were that so, one would expect that the expenditure of some £11,000\r\nout of the King’s private purse would have been reported far and wide,\r\nespecially since it had been impossible to conceal that the troops were\r\nsuffering severely from want of proper headgear in the tropical summer\r\nof North Africa. But beyond the bare announcement that the King had\r\nordered this immense number of sun-helmets to be procured for the troops\r\nin urgent haste, from abroad, because they could not be purchased at\r\nhome, no comment was made on an act of truly royal generosity. A Liberal\r\npaper said that information on the subject was held back by ministerial\r\ninstructions “until a suitable time for publication arrived,” but\r\nbeyond the bare fact of the number given and the price said to have been\r\npaid, no further details were ever published. The Conservative organs\r\nconfined themselves to commenting unfavourably on the size, shape, and\r\ncolour of the new headgear, and one of their correspondents turned the\r\nwhole affair into ridicule, describing the soldiers in the new helmets\r\nas “having the appearance of walking mushrooms, which destroyed all that\r\nhad hitherto been picturesque in the campaign.” But when the illustrated\r\npapers brought out one picture after another in which the men were seen\r\nwearing these solar topees, and the soldiers began to write home to\r\ntheir families that “the King’s helmets” not only protected them from\r\nthe sun by day, but kept their heads dry and warm while sleeping on the\r\ndamp ground by night, the people scored another black mark against Señor\r\nMaura, crediting him with a deliberate intention to conceal evidences of\r\nthe King’s care for the soldiers from the people at home.\r\n\r\nThe vests sent out by the Queen were never mentioned at all by the\r\nPress. Yet my informant, a returned soldier, told me they must have\r\nnumbered thousands, for, said he, “there seemed to be enough for all of\r\nus; at any rate, all I knew had them.”\r\n\r\nIt was thanks to these, he said, that there were not many more fever\r\npatients when the torrential rains of October fell on an Army destitute\r\nof winter clothing and even of sufficient sleeping accommodation, so\r\nthat for nights at a stretch “men lay on soaked mattresses or blankets\r\nonly, sunk in a bed of mud.” “The Queen’s vests kept us warm in the\r\nmiddle, and that helped us to bear the wet and cold,” he said.\r\n\r\nWhy was the Queen’s gift, equally with the King’s, treated with such\r\ndiscourteous silence under the Press censorship of the Clericalist\r\nMinistry? It was not for want of space in the papers, nor for want of\r\ngoodwill on the part of the editors, for full particulars were given of\r\ninnumerable generous offerings by commercial houses and private\r\nindividuals, and column after column was daily filled with names of\r\nsubscribers to the War Fund, which was designated “The Patriotic Fund\r\npresided over by H.M. the Queen,” or “The Patriotic Fund under the\r\nCommittee of Ladies,” according to the political bias of the paper\r\npublishing the lists.\r\n\r\nIf anything had been wanting to arouse national enthusiasm for the\r\nQueen, her prompt action in initiating this fund would have provided it.\r\nTo English people it seems natural that the Queen should undertake the\r\nwork, for the Queen of England has been for many a long day regarded as\r\nthe head and front of charity organised on behalf of the nation. But\r\nSpanish women, accustomed for centuries to bow to the dictates of the\r\nChurch, had come to believe that what the Church looked on coldly could\r\nnot be carried out at all, and least of all by a woman. The Church, with\r\ncertain exceptions, stood aloof from the Queen’s Fund on the pretext\r\nthat men of peace might not aid in any matter connected with war. The\r\nnation translated this into a protest on the part of the Ultramontanes\r\nagainst a national work of charity headed by a Queen who is not popular\r\nwith the priesthood. And the response to the Queen’s appeal for the sick\r\nand wounded is not only a testimony of the love of the nation for the\r\nArmy, but also evidence of its confidence in the Monarchy as opposed to\r\nthe Ultramontanes.\r\n\r\nA pretty incident in regard to another royal gift made on the first\r\nvisit of the young King and Queen to a certain large provincial town may\r\nbe worth relating. The usual largesse of so many thousand pesetas to the\r\nmunicipality, for the poor, was announced in the newspapers when they\r\nleft. But by chance I heard how much farther their unannounced charity\r\nhad extended. They had given a considerable sum to a convent in each\r\ndistrict of the city to buy bread for the poor, and of this no notice\r\nwas taken by the papers. I heard of it from a journeyman painter, whose\r\nsick wife had received two loaves.\r\n\r\n“Her aunt is portress at the Convent of ----, so she was able to get her\r\nshare. Everybody in our parish was very pleased. The only thing we\r\nshould have liked better would be to receive the bread from the King’s\r\nand Queen’s own hands, so that we might have thanked them as they\r\ndeserve. But such a crowd of people would have gone to the palace that\r\nthe Queen would have got very tired, which was no doubt the reason why\r\nthey did not give us the bread themselves.”\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the Queen’s Protestant upbringing, which prejudices\r\nthe Ultramontanes so strongly against her, has just the opposite effect\r\nupon the people. They look upon her as being, like themselves, a victim\r\nof clericalist injustice, and so deep-rooted is the conviction that\r\nwhatever the Jesuits object to must be good for the people, that the\r\nknowledge of their oppositions to the marriage would have been\r\nsufficient in itself to secure her a welcome from the proletariat.\r\n\r\nBut her hold upon the masses goes deeper than this. The peasants\r\nappreciate, far more than many of the upper classes seem to do, the\r\nvital importance to the nation of a settled Dynasty and Constitution.\r\nThey know that for many years the Monarchy hung on a thread, while the\r\nfrail life of a little child was all that preserved Spain from the chaos\r\nthat another conflict between Republicans, Carlists, and Monarchists\r\nwould have produced. Therefore when King Alfonso grew up, married, and\r\nbecame the father of an heir to the throne, the rejoicing of the nation\r\nwas heartfelt and sincere. The discussions which arose in 1905 on the\r\ndeath of the poor young Infanta Mercedes, the King’s eldest sister, as\r\nto whether her son was or was not entitled to be Prince of Asturias in\r\nthe absence of a direct heir, had aroused all serious-minded Spaniards\r\nto the ever-present dangers that would take shape in action should King\r\nAlfonso die unmarried or childless. So that when the birth of the little\r\nPrince of Asturias--the first son born to a reigning King of Spain for\r\nover a century--was speedily followed by that of a second, the poor,\r\nalways the worst sufferers from civil discord and changes of Government,\r\nlearnt to look upon the young Queen who has given these hostages for\r\npeace to the nation, with a feeling compounded of admiration and\r\naffection. And each fresh child that comes to fill the royal nurseries\r\nseem a fresh bulwark to the State in the eyes of the working classes,\r\nwho remember how their own flesh and blood were thrown to the dogs of\r\nwar time after time by opposing forces during the century when Spain had\r\neither no King or no Crown Prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF CARLISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF CARLISM\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time past it has been assumed abroad that Carlism is dead in\r\nSpain, and probably few even among diplomatists in other countries could\r\nsay off-book what the proscribed branch of the Spanish Bourbons now\r\nconsists of, where the different members of the family live, and what\r\nrelations they maintain with each other and with the country from which\r\nthey have been exiled since 1876. Even so careful an observer as Major\r\nMartin Hume wrote in 1899 that Carlism as a political system was dead in\r\nSpain, and the absolutism upon which that party pin their faith, past\r\nrevival.[12]\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, hardly surprising that the Carlists have been left out\r\nof account by those who observe Spanish political troubles from outside.\r\nIndeed, the very existence of the old Pretender seemed to have been\r\nforgotten by the generation which has grown up in England in the\r\nthirty-four years which have elapsed since the close of the last civil\r\nwar. But the Spanish working classes have not forgotten Don Carlos, nor\r\nhave they for a moment lost sight of the continued existence of this\r\nparty in their own country.\r\n\r\nThe root of their long memory lies in their antipathy to the Religious\r\nOrders. To the people the Carlists are indissolubly associated with the\r\nUltramontanes, and who says Jesuit says Carlist in their vocabulary of\r\ndistrust. And that the people have reason on their side has been proved\r\nby the words and actions of the Ultramontanes themselves since the\r\nevents that took place in the summer of 1909.\r\n\r\nThe Catalonian question has been discussed at such length and with so\r\nmuch confidence by writers living in other countries that I may be\r\nforgiven if I add to their pronouncements on the causes and effects of\r\nthe “Red Week” certain information which is not common knowledge beyond\r\nthe Pyrenees, unless possibly at the Castle of Frohsdorf or in the\r\npalaces of the proscribed branch in Venice or Trieste. The censorship\r\nexercised over the press, and over telegrams and even letters addressed\r\nto newspaper offices, was so severe while the country was under martial\r\nlaw, and, indeed, right up to the fall of the Maura Cabinet in October,\r\n1909, that representatives of foreign journals who tried to put the\r\nfacts before their leaders found it impossible to do so. Any man who had\r\nonce tried--and failed--to get off even the most cryptic telegram\r\nrelating to the part played by the Ultramontanes in the riots, was\r\nthenceforth marked by the Intelligence Department of the Society of\r\nJesus, and if he continued his efforts to communicate what he knew, he\r\nnot only found his telegrams suppressed after they had been accepted and\r\npaid for, but stood a good chance of having his personal liberty\r\ninterfered with. There was plenty of excitement about the work of a\r\nforeign correspondent in Spain in the summer of 1909, wherever he\r\nhappened to be stationed. But it was not precisely the form of danger\r\nsuggested by the reports of revolution and anarchy which were supplied\r\nto the foreign Press. Notices of that class could be procured and sent\r\nthrough without the slightest difficulty. The newspaper correspondent\r\nwho was in danger was the man who crossed the frontier to telegraph the\r\nfacts as he saw them, and who was not unlikely to meet with an\r\n“accident” as he made his way back to the scene of his labours.\r\n\r\nThe result of this regime of espionage was that all Europe was\r\nhoodwinked as to the real crisis in Spain, for naturally as soon as\r\naffairs in Cataluña ceased to be sensational, the foreign Press relapsed\r\ninto its usual indifference to what was going on in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nForeign residents, living as quietly and comfortably as usual, were\r\nconsiderably astonished when their home newspapers reached them, packed\r\nwith sensational tales of revolution, incendiarism, military sedition,\r\nand wholesale executions, and asked what on earth the Spanish Government\r\nwas about that it allowed these slanders to be propagated all over the\r\nworld? Who was responsible for these perversions of the truth? What\r\nadvantage was hoped for by those who fostered so colossal a\r\nmisrepresentation of the conduct of the inarticulate proletariat of\r\nSpain?[13]\r\n\r\nThe Censor handled the national Press even more sternly than the\r\nforeign, for the suspension of the Constitution gave the Government a\r\nperfectly free hand, and although the Constitutional rights were\r\nnominally restored everywhere except in Cataluña a few weeks after the\r\nrising, the Press was in reality gagged as long as Señor Maura remained\r\nin office. The Opposition indeed was placed on the horns of an\r\nimpossible dilemma. So long as the party kept silence as to what they\r\nknew, Spain would continue to be held up to foreign contumely for a\r\ncondition of affairs which did not exist. Yet if any Liberal dared to\r\ncriticise the Government, he was clapped into prison until such time as\r\nit might suit the Government to release him.\r\n\r\nThe position was recognised by Señor Moret, the veteran\r\nLiberal-Monarchist leader. He possesses the invaluable quality of\r\nknowing when to speak and when to keep silence. And throughout the time\r\nwhen the fair fame of his nation was being dragged in the dust, he urged\r\npatience and submission upon his followers, pointing out that when the\r\ntime came to call the Ultramontanes to account for their conduct of the\r\nGovernment, the strong men of his party must not be found in prison, for\r\nit would be their business to speak: and the Liberal-Monarchist\r\nstatesmen, without exception, supported their leader in his patriotic\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nOnly a very strong man could have controlled the rising tide of wrath\r\nagainst the Religious Orders, whom the people hold responsible for\r\neverything that goes wrong with the nation. Señor Maura, the leader of\r\nthe Ultramontane party, is supposed, by those who do not know the facts,\r\nto be the only really strong man in Spain, and it appears to be honestly\r\nbelieved abroad that he holds the Conservative party together by sheer\r\nforce of statesmanship. The truth is that Maura is a weak man who owes\r\nhis position as the leader of the party he is supposed to control only\r\nto the unflagging energy and intrigue of the Ultramontanes--the richest\r\nmen and the subtlest intellects in the Peninsula; while Moret’s power,\r\non the other hand, is based upon unswerving political rectitude,\r\nmaintained against the onslaughts of corrupt politicians, and upon his\r\ncapacity for silence among men who spend half their lives in talking.\r\nThis is why he has obtained such a hold upon the people that the whole\r\nforces of political immorality have laboured to bring about his\r\noverthrow each time that he has taken office, lest he end by leading the\r\nnation into paths where corruption will have no standing ground. Maura’s\r\npolicy of repression gave a great impetus to the revolutionary spirit\r\nagainst which it professed to be directed. And yet Moret’s influence was\r\nstrong enough to keep the nation quiet, because the nation trusts him.\r\n\r\nFor once the low level of popular education, which Moret and his\r\nfollowers are working hard to raise, was on the side of the Liberal\r\nleader. Only some twenty-five per cent. or so of the nation can read,\r\nand of that number few indeed know any language but their own. Had the\r\nworking classes realised that the Army, of which all Spain is so proud,\r\nwas being traduced by the foreigner, neither Moret nor Maura could have\r\ncontrolled the storm of wrath that would have overwhelmed those held\r\nresponsible for the lie.\r\n\r\nHappily for Spain, the syndicate of newspapers known as the _Sociedad\r\nEditorial de España_, which is edited under the direction of the\r\nLiberal-Monarchist party in Madrid, and read by thousands, as against\r\nhundreds of readers of the journals which support a different policy,\r\nnever wavered for a day in upholding Moret’s recommendation of patience\r\nand submission to the law, and refrained from increasing their sales by\r\npandering to popular excitement with allusions to what was going on\r\noutside of Spain, notwithstanding the grossest insults from the\r\nUltramontane press. Those who control the organs of the party knew well\r\nenough that if they had raised the cry of “Down with the Jesuits!” they\r\nwould have called up a tempest not easily or speedily to be allayed. But\r\nthey knew that their adversaries wished for nothing better, and they\r\nkept on their own course and saved Spain from a violent revolution\r\nagainst the Church. The syndicate of Liberal-Monarchist papers is\r\ncontinually accused by the Ultramontane press of being responsible for\r\nthe attack on the religious houses in Cataluña, and is held up to\r\nreprobation for “encouraging the destruction of the country by\r\nmaintaining the right of the people to have lay schools.” But the truth\r\nis, and the Ultramontanes know it, that to the Liberal-Monarchist press\r\nis due the present security of innumerable buildings belonging to the\r\nChurch, which, but for the influence of the Liberal party, would be in\r\nsmoke-blackened ruins to-day.\r\n\r\nMany members of the educated middle classes of Barcelona assert that the\r\ndisturbances in Cataluña in July, 1909, were deliberately instigated by\r\nthe Jesuits. The object was, they say, by hook or by crook, to close the\r\nlay schools, and that it had long been an open secret that the\r\nUltramontane party were determined to take the first excuse they could\r\nfind to destroy an educational movement which they find inimical to\r\ntheir interests. And the link connecting the Jesuits of Barcelona with\r\nDon Jaime, the son of the recently deceased Pretender, Don Carlos, was\r\nprovided by an indignant disclaimer of Carlist participation in the\r\naffair, published by a Carlist organ edited in Paris, long before any\r\nsuggestion had been made that such participation was suspected. This was\r\nso clearly a case of _qui s’excuse s’accuse_ that no thoughtful\r\nobserver, unbiassed by political passion, could fail to put two and two\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe peasants had no doubt whatever as to the origin of the disturbances.\r\nOne of them gave me his view of the situation, as follows:\r\n\r\n“The Carlists and the Jesuits plotted to turn out Isabel II., and now\r\nthey are trying to overthrow King Alfonso. They ruined Queen Isabel\r\nbecause she loved the people and hated the priests, and now they are\r\ntrying to do the same with _los Reyes_ because they are popular in the\r\ncountry. But let them try! There are still many of us who remember what\r\nwe suffered in the last Carlist war, and we do not intend to have\r\nanother. Let them try to touch _los Reyes_! We will kill every priest in\r\nthe country before they shall put a hand to that work!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I objected, “this is very fine talk now that Don Carlos is dead\r\nand buried, but if you did not want him for your king, why did so many\r\nof you fight for him?”\r\n\r\n“If you were ordered to fight and knew that you and your children would\r\nbe put in the street if you refused, would you not fight rather than let\r\nyour family starve? The men who paid our wages said: ‘You will go with\r\nus to fight for Don Carlos or you will never have another day’s work\r\nfrom us.’ What help had we against our masters? Do you think we wished\r\nto take arms against Queen Isabel? If the Jesuits had not been in the\r\naffair, no one would have taken notice of her little faults. The Jesuits\r\nintended her to commit faults when they married her to a man who was no\r\nman. If she had not been good to us they would have let her stay.”\r\n\r\nThe popular songs expressing loyalty to Queen Isabella have not been\r\nforgotten in the forty odd years that have elapsed since she was\r\ndethroned, for in 1909 they were revived, with such slight alterations\r\nas were needed to bring them up to date. Here is a specimen:\r\n\r\n    “_Si la Reina de España moriera\r\n     Y Don Carlos quisiera reinar,\r\n     Los arroyos de sangre correrian\r\n     Por el campo de la libertad._”\r\n\r\n(“If the Queen of Spain were to die and Don Carlos wanted\r\nto reign, the streams would run with blood on the field of\r\nliberty.”)\r\n\r\nThe intricacies of succession being little understood by the people,\r\nthis song was modernised by substituting “Victoria” for “de España” and\r\n“Don Jaime” for “Don Carlos.” During the suspension of the Constitution\r\nthe song was not sung aloud: the people said that “Maura had forbidden\r\nit.” Directly the Liberals came in it was heard again everywhere.\r\n\r\nHere is another:\r\n\r\n    “_No reinará Don Jaime,\r\n     No reinará, no, no!\r\n     Mientras España tenga\r\n     Bayoneta y cañon._”\r\n\r\n(“Don Jaime shall not reign while Spain has a bayonet and\r\na cannon.”)\r\n\r\nAnd another, perhaps in some ways the most interesting of the three:\r\n\r\n    “_Dicen de Barcelona\r\n     De un mitin clerical,\r\n     Que Don Jaime asistió\r\n     Provisto de un disfraz.\r\n     Al ver la bronca de palos y morral\r\n     Creyó que le tiraban bomba encima de nocedal!_”\r\n\r\nThe literal translation is as follows: “They say from Barcelona, of a\r\nclerical meeting, that Don Jaime attended it provided with a disguise.\r\nWhen he saw the row with sticks and a nosebag, he thought they were\r\nthrowing a bomb on the top of a walnut-copse.” Taken in its literal\r\nmeaning it is of course nonsense, and the popularity of the song was\r\nevidently due to the puns on “_morral_” and “_nocedal_.” By writing\r\nthese words with capitals we get the names of the man who threw the bomb\r\nat the King’s wedding (Morral), and of a well-known Carlist leader\r\n(Nocedal). This song was sung in Barcelona when the colonies were lost,\r\nwith another name in place of Morral’s, and was revived in 1909, brought\r\nup to date as above, until with the suspension of the Constitution it\r\nwas severely repressed. It expresses the popular opinion as to the\r\nauthorship of the bomb of 1906 and the troubles in Cataluña.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to observe how constantly the Carlist and Cuban wars\r\nseemed to be in the minds of the people during the regime of repression.\r\nFrequent comparisons were drawn between the reign of Queen Isabella and\r\nthe rule of Señor Maura, all highly unfavourable to the latter. It was\r\nalways Maura and the Jesuits: never was the King blamed in Spain for the\r\nsins of his ministers. The Carlist war seemed as fresh in the minds of\r\nthe unlettered masses as Mellila itself. Tales were raked up of shocking\r\ncruelty to the rank and file, and of a callous disregard of their\r\nsufferings in Cuba and the Philippines, and it seemed to be believed by\r\nmany of the speakers that similar abuses were being repeated in Morocco.\r\n\r\nA nation which has been prevented from developing its intellectual life\r\nis inevitably thrown back upon its recollections, and traditions of\r\nclass injury cannot fail to be more permanent among a people who have no\r\nother occupation for their thoughts.\r\n\r\nFor nearly forty years the uneducated Spanish peasantry, and the artisan\r\nclasses, have nursed their wrath against the body whom their parents\r\nbelieved to have dethroned, for their own ends and at the cost of a\r\nbloody civil war, a Queen desirous of ameliorating the lot of her\r\npeople; and for ten years of that time their resentment has been\r\nincreased by the conviction that the same body plotted to sell the last\r\nof the once world-wide Spanish colonies, and strewed the road to that\r\nsale with the corpses of Spanish peasants, set to fight, without arms or\r\nequipment, against the overwhelming forces of the enemy, while the\r\nJesuits appropriated to their own purposes the money wrung from the\r\nnation for the expenses of the war.\r\n\r\nHow much of the indictment against the Jesuits is justified I do not\r\npretend to decide; but all the world knows that the Spanish Army again\r\nand again went into action in Cuba and the Philippines so destitute of\r\nmunitions as to be practically unarmed, while the tragic loss of the\r\nSpanish Navy at Santiago will never be forgotten by those whose friends\r\nand relatives were sent to an inevitable death “by order of the\r\nGovernment in Madrid.”\r\n\r\nHad the people been allowed to educate themselves during the years that\r\nhave passed since those fatal adventures, the wound, though it will long\r\nremain unhealed, would have been skinned over by consoling comparisons\r\ndrawn between these and the great disasters of other nations. But the\r\nReligious Orders have always opposed the spread of popular education.\r\nThe people have been driven back upon tradition, old and new, for their\r\nmental nourishment, while other nations have been forging ahead. Thus\r\nthe Religious Orders have sharpened a sword for their own undoing. The\r\nlonger the Spanish peasant is left to nurse the memory of his\r\ngrievances, the more bitter grows his resentment against those whom he\r\nholds responsible for them.\r\n\r\nTo the Jesuits the people attribute the downfall of Isabel II. and the\r\nyears of internecine strife which followed; to the Jesuits they\r\nattribute the fiasco of the Spanish-American War, with all the suffering\r\nit entailed upon the poor; to the Jesuits they attribute the war in\r\nMorocco, with its heavy account of bloodshed, sickness, and money-cost;\r\nand to the Jesuits they impute the chronic unrest in Cataluña, which\r\nthey believe to be fostered in the interests of Don Jaime of Bourbon.\r\nThey are convinced that all these things were and are engineered by the\r\nCarlist party, being well aware that, as the Pretender himself stated,\r\nin a published document, the “Monarch” of the Ultramontanes has no hope\r\nof entering Spain again, save on the waves of a national revolution,\r\nwhich would bring misery and desolation to thousands of homes.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what evidence may be found in incidents that have\r\noccurred and statements that have been published since the regime of\r\nrepression was abolished, to support the popular theory of\r\nJesuit-Carlist intervention in the events of 1909.\r\n\r\nThe belief, industriously promulgated in Spain and abroad, that Ferrer\r\nengineered and conducted the July outbreak, fell flat, generally\r\nspeaking, among the Spanish working people; always excepting, of course,\r\nthe more educated elements in the larger industrial cities.\r\n\r\n“They are saying that this Ferrer, whoever he may be, paid Morral to\r\nthrow the bomb at the King and Queen. If that is true he deserved to be\r\nshot. But others say that the Jesuits themselves paid Morral, and\r\nothers again say that Don Carlos employed him.[14] What do _I_ know\r\nabout it? The only thing certain is that the Jesuits had a hand in this\r\nBarcelona business, for they have a hand in everything that is bad for\r\nthe country. Where the Jesuits are, there are the Carlists also. As for\r\nthis Ferrer, who is he? We never heard of him till Maura shot him.”\r\n\r\nThis commentary on “the execution of an anarchist” or “the martyrdom of\r\nan enthusiast” is, of course, that of the peasantry alone, not that of\r\nthe Republicans and Socialists, to whom he was well known long before\r\nthe Barcelona riots took place. But let it be remembered that the\r\nunlettered peasant forms the great majority of the working classes in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe calm with which the mass of the nation regarded the affair was,\r\nhowever, shaken when a report got about that Ferrer was denounced by or\r\nat the instigation of a Dominican monk--even a name being given--who,\r\nhaving quarrelled with him some years before, had determined to contrive\r\nhis destruction. I do not say that there was any foundation for this\r\nvague story. But its ready acceptance as exculpating\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEÑOR MAURA.\r\n\r\nLeader of the Ultramontanes.\r\n\r\n[To face page 149.]]\r\n\r\nFerrer, by those who had previously been indifferent or hostile to him,\r\nshows how the people twist everything to the prejudice of the Religious\r\nOrders, and believe all evil possible to them. Had the Liberal papers\r\nlent themselves to agitation then, the result might have been serious.\r\nNo better incitement to riot could have been found than the story of the\r\nDominican. The death of Ferrer in itself left the mass of the people\r\nunmoved, but the ease with which churches and monasteries were destroyed\r\nin Barcelona had already set many aggrieved people thinking how easy it\r\nwould be to follow Barcelona’s example in other towns where the Jesuits\r\nare numerous, and only a leader and a party-cry were needed to raise the\r\nworking classes against the Religious Orders.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Opposition Press, however, in spite of great\r\nprovocation, as usual stuck to its guns and steadily, continued to\r\ncondemn violence and to point out that the duty of the nation, unjustly\r\ndeprived of its constitutional rights, was to prove by its\r\nself-restraint and moderation how entirely it was worthy to be trusted.\r\n\r\n“If we could only kill Maura without hurting the King,” a working man\r\nsaid to me, “he would have been dead long ago, for he is the cause of\r\nall our troubles. But the Jesuits would make out that any act of\r\nviolence on our part was directed, not against Maura himself, but\r\nagainst the party which is supposed to support the King; they would\r\nnever admit that it was only their friend Maura whom we were attacking,\r\nand it would be made to appear that we were trying to overthrow the\r\nMonarchy. That is why Maura is still alive.” The conviction, and the\r\nrancour expressed in these words, cannot be rendered in print.\r\n\r\nThe speaker could not read or write. He and some ten or twelve of his\r\nfriends were in the habit of meeting quietly together after nightfall,\r\nwhen no priest or Jesuit was likely to see them. One of the better\r\ninstructed, generally a reservist who had “got education while serving\r\nthe King,” would read aloud to the rest, and all would discuss the\r\npronouncements of their chosen newspaper and form a collective opinion\r\non them. I have sat with many such groups, in small towns and country\r\nvillages, and have taken care to notice what newspaper they read. It was\r\ninvariably the _Libéral_. It often struck me, during the three months of\r\n“repression,” that Señor Maura literally owed his life to the organs of\r\nthe so-called “Trust,” which he and his party accuse of working hand in\r\nhand with the anarchists; for the sentiment recorded above was\r\nexpressed in my presence many times by members of the working classes in\r\nconnection with Barcelona, the war, the want of education, and all their\r\nother grievances. Maura, the Jesuits, and the Carlists, are regarded as\r\none by the mass of the nation, and the three-fold hostility is\r\nconcentrated on each member of the trinity in turn.\r\n\r\nWhen you have some twelve or thirteen million people brooding over their\r\ngrievances, and cherishing the conviction that a certain party in the\r\nState refuses to recognise or redress those grievances because by\r\npreserving the _status quo_ they put money in their own pockets, the\r\nsituation becomes serious for the party to which such action, or\r\ninaction, is attributed. And it must be remembered that though the\r\nSpanish peasant can read but little of the literature disseminated by\r\nrevolutionaries--anarchists and such-like--across the Pyrenees, an echo\r\nof their campaign can hardly fail to reach him sooner or later.\r\n\r\nSeveral little incidents occurred about this time which, though trivial\r\nin themselves, lend support to the popular view that the Carlists were\r\nat the bottom of the trouble.\r\n\r\nThus we have the disclaimer of participation in the outbreak, by the\r\n_Correo Catalan_, the official organ of the party, synchronising with\r\nthe publication of extracts from a “forthcoming” manifesto of Don\r\nJaime, suggesting the possible expulsion of the King by a revolution, to\r\nwhich I have already alluded; while early in August the Ultramontane\r\njournals said that a quantity of weapons, which they allege to have been\r\ntaken from the hands of the mob, were stored in the Carlist club in\r\nBarcelona. Don Jaime’s full manifesto was not published till November,\r\nwhen the equivocal passage did not appear. But it is worth observing\r\nthat some time before the expected death of the old Pretender his\r\nsupporters in the Press had been hinting that those who believed Carlism\r\nto be dead in Spain “would presently see things that would surprise\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nThen we have the inexplicable favours accorded by the Government to\r\nSeñor Llorens, a Carlist Deputy to Cortes and one of the most prominent\r\nof the “Court” of Don Jaime. This gentleman paid more than one visit to\r\nthe Army at Melilla, and was allowed privileges at the front which were\r\ngranted to no other civilian. The favours shown to him and his own\r\nproceedings were so marked as to call forth outspoken comment from the\r\n_Ejército Español_, a military paper professedly without political bias,\r\nwhich, after recalling the fact that he is a well-known supporter of the\r\nanti-dynastic party, and had\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DON JAIME OF BOURBON IN MOROCCO.\r\n\r\n[To face page 153.]\r\n\r\ntaken part in the last Carlist war, plainly warned him that any attempt\r\nto tamper with the loyalty of the Army would be in vain, and asked what\r\nwas the meaning of the exceptional privileges he enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOn July 24th a great meeting of the Carlists was held at Trieste on the\r\noccasion of the funeral of Don Carlos, the most noteworthy feature of\r\nwhich was that on the evening of the same day Don Jaime left his\r\nfollowers to be entertained by his mother and sisters, and went himself,\r\nit was said, to Frohsdorf. Why did he, on the very day of his father’s\r\nfuneral, abandon the delegates of his party when they travelled long\r\ndistances to see him and discuss the situation? The rioting at Barcelona\r\nwas just then at its height, having begun, it was said, some days sooner\r\nthan was intended.\r\n\r\nAbout this time all sorts of reports were spread, calculated to alarm\r\nthe country and prejudice it against the Monarchy. The story of the\r\nmutiny and execution of soldiers on their arrival at the front I have\r\nalready mentioned. The details of this varied with each telling:\r\nsometimes two men were shot, sometimes nine, often a whole battalion,\r\nonce several of them. The immediate preparation of accommodation was\r\ncalled for for the thousands of sick and wounded, who could not be\r\nreceived in the already overflowing hospitals. Real sacrifices were made\r\nby the poor to help in these preparations, for every one wished to do\r\nhis share for the sufferers; and when at length it became clear that no\r\nwounded were coming, at any rate at that time, and that the demands made\r\non the public sympathy--for the moment at least--were a sham, much\r\nindignation was naturally aroused. These alarmist reports circulated\r\nwith great rapidity, even in remote villages where no one received\r\nnewspapers. The people had no hesitation in attributing them to the\r\nparish priests, “who have their own ways of spreading what Jesuits wish\r\nthem to make known,” and tales of all sorts of horrors for which they\r\nhad been held responsible in the past began to be raked up and repeated\r\nas happenings of the moment. One such tale was of a walled-up nun found\r\nin a convent in Barcelona during the July riots. I took some trouble to\r\ntrack this story, and finally convinced myself that it was merely an\r\necho from the past--a tale of the Inquisition or of some monastic crime.\r\nBut it formed another instance of the hold that tradition has on the\r\nSpanish peasant, and of the way in which it is combined with the events\r\nof the day to pile up the indictment against the Religious Orders.\r\n\r\nI asked some of my middle-class acquaintances on one occasion where was\r\nto be found the “army” of Don Jaime, which I had seen mentioned in the\r\nreport of a Carlist meeting. One of them laughed and said it existed\r\nonly in the region of comic opera, but another proceeded to explain with\r\nconviction that the Pretender had a strong following in Cataluña and the\r\nBasque Provinces and a good many adherents in Andalusia, and expatiated\r\nat length on the benefits the nation would derive from the autocracy and\r\nthe abolition of popular rights, which he seemed to think would bring\r\nabout a social millennium.\r\n\r\nAnd while he was speaking I mentally recalled the commentary of one of\r\nthe people, to whom I had read aloud Don Jaime’s manifesto, asking\r\nwhether he would welcome the advent of the “Legitimist Monarch” in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n“Don Jaime? I? I would like to burn him and then blow his ashes to the\r\nwinds, and so would all my friends, both men and women. What dealings do\r\nwe desire with the seed of Don Carlos? There is no poor man in Spain who\r\nliked Don Carlos or wishes ever to see his son.”\r\n\r\nA Basque friend of mine, a highly educated man, whose position as a\r\nlarge employer of labour enables him to judge fairly of the political\r\nleanings of the people, made the following remark to me one day:\r\n\r\n“The Carlists,” he said, “may think they have the Basque Provinces with\r\nthem, but they are completely mistaken. The working classes of my\r\ncountry have no more desire for civil war than those of any other part\r\nof Spain.”\r\n\r\nThis gentleman is not a man who would use illicit means to influence the\r\nvotes of his dependants, and his opinion may be taken as representing\r\nthe true state of public opinion in his district. On the other hand, he\r\nsaid that among his wealthy clients there was no attempt to disguise the\r\ndesire for a dynastic change: the portrait of Don Jaime hangs in a place\r\nof honour in many of the great houses which he visits in the course of\r\nhis business, and the general devotion of this class to Carlism is open\r\nand avowed.\r\n\r\n“But,” he said, “what can be done by a party which is all head and no\r\nbody? The army of Don Jaime may be well supplied with would-be officers\r\nand with all the munitions of war, but they have no troops behind them,\r\nin the Basque Provinces or anywhere else.”\r\n\r\nHis description of the Carlist “army” reminded me of the famous raid of\r\nthe Fhairshon:\r\n\r\n    “For he did resolve to extirpate the vipers\r\n     With four and twenty men and five and thirty pipers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH MILITANT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH MILITANT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church of Spain asserts that its mission is peace, and as has been\r\nsaid, supported the assertion, when Queen Victoria initiated the\r\npatriotic fund for the sick and wounded at Melilla, by declining as a\r\nbody to contribute, on the ground that men of peace would be stultifying\r\ntheir office if they supported a war fund. When it was pointed out that\r\nthe healing of the sick and the binding up of wounds, however incurred,\r\nwas as much the Church’s mission as the preaching of peace, the reply\r\nwas given that the priests as a class were poor men who could not afford\r\nto give away money. It may be remarked that what they call their poverty\r\nis so well recognised by the working classes that they never dream of\r\napplying to their parish priests when they are in distress; they say it\r\nwould be useless to do so, because “the priests do nothing without\r\nsecuring their fee in advance.”\r\n\r\nBut for a body whose first duty, on their own showing, is the preaching\r\nof peace, it cannot be denied that the Religious Orders, if not the\r\nsecular clergy, are distinctly militant.\r\n\r\nWhile Maura was in office nothing about priests and firearms would have\r\nbeen allowed to appear in the papers, but about a fortnight after his\r\nfall the _Pais_ asserted that previous to the Barcelona outbreak the\r\nCarlists and Jesuits had accumulated a great quantity of arms in some of\r\nthe small towns in Cataluña, which were subsequently conveyed at night\r\nfrom one religious house to another in Barcelona. And, said the _Pais_,\r\nwhile the local authorities were imprisoning luckless working men who\r\nneither possessed weapons nor made any sort of revolutionary movement,\r\nthe contraband purchase of arms was still going on, “the priests and the\r\nReligious Orders shamelessly lending their aid to it, and the people\r\nkeeping silence because they believe that every Government, whatever it\r\nmay be called, is either friendly to Carlism or is afraid of it and\r\ncannot or will not interfere with it.”\r\n\r\nOn reading this article (which the Ultramontane organs did not\r\ncontradict) I was reminded of a story which had been told me three\r\nmonths before by one of my working class friends. A pious old woman, the\r\nwife of a small shopkeeper in a town where there are many religious\r\nhouses, went one night to a service at a church attached to a\r\nmonastery.[15] The weather was hot and the old woman tired. She fell\r\nsound asleep in a dark corner and woke at midnight to find the church\r\nempty and the doors locked.\r\n\r\nRecognising at once that she had no choice but to stay where she was\r\nuntil morning, she was looking about for the most comfortable bench on\r\nwhich to pass the night, when she saw a light in the sacristy\r\ncommunicating with the monastery and heard steps approaching. Fearing\r\nlest the fathers should accuse her of being there with intent to rob the\r\nchurch, she crawled under a bench and lay trembling. From this position\r\nshe saw a number of monks and priests file into the nave, form up in\r\nranks, and go through various military exercises under the command of\r\none of the number, who looked and spoke like an officer. The drill\r\ncontinued for some time, and after it was over the unwilling witness had\r\nto stay where she was until the doors were opened for early Mass, when\r\nshe made her escape, ran home as fast as her poor old legs would carry\r\nher, and related what she had seen to her husband and neighbours. This\r\nwas told me by a lad who sold fruit to the husband, who declared that he\r\nhad heard it from the old woman herself.\r\n\r\nAt the time I paid no attention to the story, knowing how the dramatic\r\ninstinct of the Spaniard lends itself to exaggeration in repeating\r\nanything that appeals to the imagination, and thinking that the whole\r\nthing might have been a dream. But later on I found reason to think\r\nthere might be some basis of fact in what was related by my young\r\nfruit-seller. When the _Pais_ article appeared I was told, in the course\r\nof a conversation about it, that a priest in a neighbouring town had\r\nsaid in the hearing of my interlocutor--of course unaware that he was\r\nlistening--that his party were all armed and prepared to shoot “on\r\nsight” every one whom they knew to be inimical to them, directly the\r\nopportunity offered. And thenceforward for some weeks constant reports\r\nof the arming of friars and their lay allies--the “Young Catholics,”\r\n“Luises,” and other such associations--were published by the one party\r\nand denied by the other with equal frequency.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the following passages from an article in the _Correo\r\nEspañol_ are rather significant.\r\n\r\n“In Barcelona ten Carlists sufficed to prevent the burning of a church,\r\nand put the mob to flight, so that they left in the hands of our friends\r\nthe weapons they were carrying in pursuit of their vandalic designs” [an\r\nincident already referred to]. “And there are 100,000 brave men such as\r\nthese in Spain.... We are prepared for all! all!! all!!!” (in crescendo\r\ncapitals). “The fight, which inevitably had to come sooner or later, has\r\nnow begun between Catholics and sectarians, between civilisation and\r\nbarbarism, and we must not stop till we have destroyed them.”\r\n\r\nIt all reads like transpontine melodrama, and as such I at first\r\nregarded it. But when day after day announcements appeared that new\r\nCarlist clubs were being opened in one small town after another, when\r\nSeñor Llorens returned from his second sojourn with the troops, loaded\r\nwith plans, sketches, reports, and what not, relating to the campaign\r\nand the general condition of the Army there, and openly announced that\r\nhe had obtained them for Don Jaime, and when, although the people were\r\nshouting songs of defiance to the Carlists and their “King,” the\r\nmilitant “Catholic Association of Social Defence” announced that it had\r\nincreased its working class membership from 31,000 to 200,000, one began\r\nto wonder whether the Carlist “army” might be something more than comic\r\nopera.[16]\r\n\r\nThe stories related of secret arming and drilling in the churches at\r\nnight are obviously not capable of verification by a layman and a\r\nforeigner,[17] but that the Jesuits in Barcelona were armed before the\r\nrevolt began, and used their arms with skill, seems certain. A near\r\nrelative of one of these warlike men of religion told me that they had\r\ntwice driven back the mob by firing from their balconies, so it seems\r\nfair to assume that when the newspapers talked of the shooting down of\r\nthe crowd by the Jesuits they had some ground for their statement.\r\nCivilians in Barcelona found in the possession of arms were arrested,\r\neven though they had not used them, but it does not appear that the\r\nJesuits incurred any penalty for using their weapons on the mob.\r\n\r\nOne mysterious feature in the events of that week has never been cleared\r\nup, and possibly never will be.\r\n\r\nOn the first two days of the rioting there was fighting about the\r\nbarricades which had been raised in many of the central streets, but the\r\nscarcity of firearms among the rioters was noticeable, a large number of\r\nthem being without arms of any kind. Mainly, no doubt, in consequence of\r\nthis, the struggle was practically over by the third day, after which\r\nthere was no more street fighting, the troops occupied the city, and the\r\nattack on the Religious Orders, which might so easily have spread all\r\nover Spain, was at an end.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding that the fighting was over, shooting from the roofs\r\nof the houses went on for two days more. No one ever saw those who\r\nfired: the shots came from invisible persons concealed behind the\r\nparapets and other sheltered positions. And, what was the more\r\nremarkable, whether the shooting was in working class districts, or, as\r\nwas frequently the case, from houses in those quarters of the city where\r\nrich men live, the noise of the report and the bullets which were found\r\nwere always the same. The “man on the roof” invariably used a Browning\r\npistol, a weapon not easily procured by a poor artisan. Thirty, forty,\r\nfifty such shots would be fired in succession, the troops would hurry up\r\nto the roof from which the bullets came, find no one there, and see\r\nnothing suspicious, yet hear the rattle of the shots again as they\r\nreturned to their duty in the street below. A civilian who ran up the\r\nstairs from the ground floor in one of the “haunted” houses told me that\r\nalthough several shots were fired as he ran, no one was to be seen\r\nabove, except a young priest professedly on the same errand as his own.\r\n\r\nIt was said that among the many people arrested there was at least one\r\npriest. But nothing more was heard of him, and whether he was released\r\nas innocent, or allowed to disappear, was not revealed to the public.\r\n\r\nNo one has yet explained who organised the expensively-armed\r\nsharpshooters who displayed such remarkable skill in firing from an\r\nelevation without being caught in the act. The people believe that they\r\nwere members of the clerical party whose object was to exasperate the\r\ntroops against the rioters who were supposed to be firing at them, and\r\nthus to bring about a fight in which the whole town should be involved.\r\nMeanwhile Don Jaime was to convert the mêlée into an organised\r\nrevolution against the established order of things, which should spread\r\nfrom Barcelona all over Cataluña, and from Cataluña throughout Spain.\r\nThis, for what it is worth, is the popular explanation of one of the\r\nmost mysterious features in the “anarchist” rising of July, 1909.\r\n\r\nBut the people go farther still. They attribute not only the incidents\r\nof July, but the whole of the political unrest in Cataluña to the\r\nunderground activities of the Carlists and their allies the\r\nUltramontanes. It is firmly believed by the unlettered peasantry, who\r\nread or listened to the accounts of the beginnings and endings of the\r\n“Red Week,” that the emissaries of the Pretender planned and carried out\r\nevery incident that led up to the general strike with which the rioting\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nThe protest against the calling out of the reservists--the greatest\r\nerror of the many committed by the Government at that time--was said to\r\nhave been engineered by the Carlists. It was not spontaneous and found\r\nno real echo in the feeling of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to proclaim a general strike, but even then there was\r\nso little idea among the working classes that anything like violence was\r\nintended, that women and children strolled out to the meeting-place as\r\nfor an outing, with the men who were unconsciously being led into\r\naction which was to brand them as revolutionaries and assassins.\r\n\r\nTo this day no one has been able to say how or why the rioting began.\r\nThe only thing clear is that the great majority of the strikers expected\r\nand intended to proceed peaceably to formulate their demands, although\r\nno one knows exactly what these were to be, for no formal report of the\r\nstrikers’ complaints, or even of the factories they worked in, has ever\r\nbeen published.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Governor, Señor Osorio, objected to the calling out of the\r\ntroops, and fell into permanent disgrace with Maura and his Cabinet for\r\nsaying that but for the undue harshness employed by the military\r\nauthorities, the rising would never have attained serious proportions.\r\nHe was dismissed from his post--perhaps inevitably, since he had not\r\nforeseen events. It is worth noting that the week before the riots the\r\nGovernment had expressed themselves as perfectly satisfied with the\r\ntranquil condition of Barcelona under Señor Osorio, and had withdrawn\r\nmost of the troops in garrison in the province.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Ultramontane Press never wearied of repeating\r\nblood-curdling tales of the awful scenes of carnage, rapine, and\r\nsacrilege, brought about by the teaching given in the lay schools, a\r\nhundred of which, they said, Maura had been compelled to close in order\r\nto put an end to a system of education which produced such horrors: and\r\nsince the Opposition newspapers were not allowed to publish a line\r\nwithout the sanction of Señor La Cierva, the Minister of the Interior,\r\nthe nation, had it read the Ultramontane papers, would have supped its\r\nfill of uncontradicted libels upon the working people of Cataluña. But\r\nthe nation does not read the Ultramontane papers. The Press of that\r\nparty, indeed, admits the exiguousness of its circulation by pathetic\r\nappeals to the faithful to furnish money for the propaganda which in\r\nUltramontane opinion constitutes the only hope of arresting the crimes\r\nborn of the instruction given in the lay schools, and fostered by the\r\nseditious labours of the _Liberal_. But although the people closed their\r\nears to the fulminations of the Church papers, the hand of the Church\r\nlay heavy on all Spain in 1909, for the continual reports of bombs and\r\narrests, and the whispered tales of the secret drilling and arming of\r\n“good Catholics,” kept everybody on the rack, fearing they knew not\r\nwhat. The slow progress of the campaign in Melilla, the constant arrival\r\nof shiploads of sick and wounded, and the impossibility of obtaining\r\ntrustworthy news of what was really going on, filled the cup of anxiety,\r\nand every one was in low spirits, for every family had friends or\r\nrelatives in the war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Don Jaime, in his castle of Frohsdorf, was occupied in editing\r\na verbose document which he published later on, addressed “to those\r\nloyal to me.” The gist of this was that as long as Spain was engaged in\r\nwar he would make no move, but that when the flag waved victorious he\r\nwould remember that he had to fulfil unavoidable duties imposed by his\r\nbirth. “And,” said he, “social order, shaken by the revolution, is\r\ntottering to its foundations. And this not so much from the attack of\r\nanarchical crowds as from the cowardice of the powers who make compact\r\nwith them, delivering themselves as hostages in order to save their life\r\nand property. In the violent struggle which is approaching between\r\ncivilisation and barbarism I yield to no one the first place in the\r\nvanguard in the fight for society and the country.”\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, an incident in which the nation at large took very\r\nlittle interest nearly proved the last straw. This was the execution of\r\nFerrer.\r\n\r\nEverything had been done beforehand to excite the public over the\r\naffair. Columns upon columns of matter prejudging the case had filled\r\nthe Ultramontane Press for weeks, while the _Sociedad Editorial_ and the\r\nrepublican _Pais_ were accused of complicity with the prisoner because\r\nthey pointed out that the publication of incriminating documents alleged\r\nto have been found in his house, before the Court had pronounced them\r\ngenuine, was contrary to all the principles of justice. In Republican\r\nand Socialist circles this action on the part of the Government--for\r\ncopies of the documents in question were sent to the Press by persons in\r\nGovernment employ--produced the indignation that might be\r\nexpected--indignation that probably was counted upon to bring about an\r\noutbreak of violence. But the mass of the people, thanks to their lack\r\nof education, knew and cared very little about Ferrer and his alleged\r\noffences against society.\r\n\r\nWhile all Europe was excited about the fate of the founder of the lay\r\nschools, the Spanish people, believed abroad to be seething with anarchy\r\nand sedition, were peaceably if dispiritedly pursuing their usual\r\navocations, only interested in Ferrer, if they took any interest in him\r\nat all, as another victim of the tyranny of the Church, whose “tool,” as\r\nthey call Maura, had brought Spain so low.\r\n\r\nThis was because the _Sociedad Editorial_, and especially the\r\n_Liberal_, laboured as indefatigably to keep the temper of the people\r\nwithin bounds as their opponents on the Ultramontane press laboured to\r\nproduce irritation. At one period in the protracted controversy I\r\nwondered whether the editors or staff of the _Sociedad Editorial_ could\r\nactually be unaware of the lies spread broadcast concerning the\r\npolitical party for which they stand, so temperate in quality and so\r\nlimited in quantity were their comments on the foreign campaign against\r\nthe honour of the Spanish nation. But I soon came to understand that it\r\nwas not ignorance of what was going on, although the Censorship used all\r\nits wits to keep foreign newspapers out of the Liberal-Monarchist\r\nnewspaper offices. It was the deliberate policy of the wise and\r\nfar-sighted Liberal-Monarchist party to keep their working-class readers\r\nin the dark about the Ferrer incident, because they knew that if the\r\nmass of the people became aware of the attack upon their honour, a civil\r\nwar between the Ultramontanes and the people would have broken out\r\nwithin a week.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to doubt that the desire of those who pull the\r\nstrings that work the Ultramontane party leaders was to provoke such a\r\nwar. The declaration of the _Correo Catalan_ that a hundred thousand\r\ngood Catholics were ready to follow the example of the Jesuits who\r\nfired on the crowd in Barcelona and to “go all lengths” against the\r\nforces of “anarchy” bears no other interpretation. The\r\nLiberal-Monarchists, who know that in any such war the people would\r\nstand as one man for the King and the Constitution against the\r\nUltramontanes with the hated Pretender at their head, might have been\r\nexcused had they dallied with the idea of sweeping out the Religious\r\nOrders by force, and thus settling once for all the eternal quarrel\r\nbetween the State and the Church of Rome. But no such course of action\r\nwould have been admitted as possible by Moret, who is, and will remain\r\nwhile he lives, the spiritual if not the ostensible leader of his party.\r\nWell aware that he was offending the more advanced and impetuous among\r\nhis followers, and that he was being accused of lukewarmness in\r\ndefending the Liberal party from attacks both at home and abroad, Moret\r\nfirmly pursued his lifelong policy of conciliation instead of\r\nprovocation, and it was thanks to his firmness alone, during the last\r\nthree months of Maura’s rule, that Spain was not once more thrust into\r\nthe horrors of internecine strife.\r\n\r\nThe week before Maura’s Government fell the Radical and Republican party\r\nin Madrid demanded permission to hold a meeting on the following\r\nSunday, to protest against what they considered the illegality of a\r\ntrial in which witnesses for the defence were not summoned. The\r\norganising committee frankly stated that whether Maura gave leave or\r\nnot, the demonstration would equally take place.\r\n\r\nWhat might have happened had the Ultramontane Government still been in\r\noffice on the day of the demonstration, no one can pretend to say. But\r\nin the meantime the climax came and the Maura Government fell, amid\r\ngeneral rejoicings. The demonstrations took place, not only in Madrid\r\nbut in all the large towns, and were in every case conducted with the\r\nmost perfect order. Their original object seemed to be lost sight of in\r\nthe satisfaction at the change of Government. The speakers said very\r\nlittle about Ferrer, because Ferrer was of so little interest to the\r\npeople; in the majority of cases the demonstrators limited themselves to\r\na protest against Maura’s policy and a demand that he should never hold\r\noffice again.\r\n\r\nThe Religious Orders were, or professed to be, in a state of panic\r\nterror when the demonstrations were announced. They declared that they\r\nexpected violence, incendiarism, and robbery; treasures of gold and\r\nsilver work, images, paintings, &c., were removed to private houses for\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DEMONSTRATION OF REJOICING AT THE FALL OF THE\r\nULTRAMONTANE MINISTRY, NOVEMBER, 1909.\r\n\r\n[To face page 174.]]\r\n\r\nsafe keeping; and the general exhibition of alarm on the part of friars,\r\nnuns, and parish priests made them a laughing-stock to the working\r\nclasses for the month during which the demonstrations continued. The\r\nCivil Guard were sent, at the request of the ecclesiastical authorities,\r\nto assist the friars in their projected self-defence and to instil\r\ncourage into the trembling nuns, and the garrisons were everywhere kept\r\nin barracks in readiness for attacks which nobody dreamed of making. A\r\nCivil Guard told me, with a twinkle in his eye, that he and his\r\ncompanion had sat up all night in the portal of a convent, knowing all\r\nthe time that they might just as well have been in their beds for all\r\nthe danger the convent was in. No doubt many nuns seriously believed\r\ntheir houses to be in peril, although the Jesuits must have been\r\nperfectly aware of the truth, and it is not easy to find words in which\r\nto characterise the folly, to say no worse, of a policy which tries to\r\nforward its ends by permitting women cut off and completely ignorant of\r\nthe world to spend hours of misery anticipating dangers which their\r\nleaders must know to be imaginary.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be denied that the deep-seated and chronic hostility\r\nof the people to the Religious Orders became manifest all over Spain,\r\nas reports of panic-stricken friars spread from mouth to mouth,\r\nconverting their traditional dread of the Church into a feeling of\r\ncontempt. The working-class Spaniards fear the underground action of the\r\nChurch because they know it may mean starvation for their wives and\r\nchildren. But it was something new for them to see the “long skirts”\r\nfleeing from Cataluña in fear of their lives, and the spectacle led to\r\nopen exhibitions of scorn, which are a new feature in the history of the\r\nChurch in Spain.\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting either journalists or private persons to hint\r\nthat the alarm shown by the Religious Orders at the demonstrations\r\nagainst Señor Maura was fictitious, and a renewal of the Catalonian\r\nriots would have suited their plans. It was said that the slightest\r\nhostile action on the part of the working classes would have been made\r\nthe signal for a Carlist rising, and that numbers of priests and monks,\r\nas well as civilians of that party, were armed in readiness for such a\r\ncontingency.\r\n\r\nThis was why the organisers of the demonstration so urgently appealed to\r\ntheir followers not to be provoked into recrimination by “persons\r\nsubsidised by the other party, who would place themselves among the\r\ndemonstrators with the intention of causing disturbances.” They thought\r\nit necessary to warn the public that what might seem the merest act of\r\npersonal aggression on the part of an ordinary loafer might really be\r\nthe initiation of an organised plan to raise a serious revolt. And they\r\nprayed their friends to bear in mind that persons committing such acts\r\nof aggression might be the secret agents of the Jesuits, and therefore\r\non no account to be induced to retaliate. These appeals were issued in\r\nleaflets which were distributed by the thousand in all the towns where\r\ndemonstrations were to be held, and no doubt contributed largely to the\r\nself-restraint and good conduct of the crowd everywhere.\r\n\r\nIf the organisers were justified in believing that the Jesuits wanted to\r\ncreate disturbances, the angry and exceedingly untruthful comments on\r\nthese leaflets in the Ultramontane Press might be accounted for. They\r\nwere described as deliberate incentives to the usual list of\r\ncrimes--incendiarism, sacrilege, &c.--and “good Catholics” were ordered\r\nto destroy any that fell into their hands without reading the infamies\r\nuttered by the “anarchist canaille.” Naturally the description given by\r\nthe Clericalists of their opponents’ circular only excited the curiosity\r\nof the “good Catholics.” The “good” working man read the paper with the\r\nadded interest given by its prohibition, and finding nothing criminal\r\nin it, went with the rest to the meeting to hear what it was all about.\r\nIt is quite likely that the Church’s anathema of the essentially\r\nconstitutional leaflets issued in most of the industrial cities on the\r\nfirst two Sundays of November, 1909, resulted in making new converts to\r\nLiberalism among the small minority of working men who till then were\r\nstill following the dictates of the priests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARCELONA AND THE LAY SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBARCELONA AND THE LAY SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the popular belief that the riots in\r\nBarcelona in July, 1909, were deliberately instigated by the Jesuits and\r\nthe Carlists acting in concert, the object of the Churchmen being\r\nprimarily to provide an excuse for closing the lay schools established\r\nby Ferrer, the hope of the Pretender and his party being that the\r\ndisturbances would spread and assume the proportions of a revolution,\r\n“on the waves” of which he hoped to ride to the throne.\r\n\r\nAs the course of events in Barcelona which culminated in the “Red Week”\r\nhas not unnaturally perplexed foreign observers, it may be worth while,\r\nin the absence of any proof as to who was at the bottom of the trouble,\r\nto suggest a hypothesis which at any rate has the merit of giving a\r\nplausible explanation of the incidents.\r\n\r\nThroughout the three years that Señor Maura was at the head of affairs,\r\nBarcelona had been in a state of continual unrest and anxiety. Bomb\r\noutrages were reported every two or three weeks with monotonous\r\nregularity, but strange to say, the explosions seldom or never took\r\nplace in public buildings or in places where people congregate. Now and\r\nthen some inoffensive passerby was killed or wounded, and once in a way\r\nan insignificant house would be damaged more or less seriously. But the\r\ntotal injuries inflicted by this long series of bombs were so few that\r\nthe object of their authors must have been to terrorise rather than to\r\nkill. When the King and Queen went to Barcelona in the autumn of 1908,\r\nthe inevitable bomb was let off--or was reported to have been let\r\noff--on the sea shore, where no one could possibly have been hurt by it.\r\n\r\nHere, by way of parenthesis, I should like to call attention to the\r\ncourage and devotion to duty shown by both the King and the Queen on\r\nthis occasion. It was considered advisable by the Ultramontane\r\nGovernment that the young wife and mother should accompany her husband\r\nto the city which has been made to bear such an evil reputation as the\r\nhome of anarchy and sedition. The nation watched the proceedings with\r\nadmiration. “What courage the Queen had, to face the chance of another\r\nbomb being exploded in her presence so soon after that tragedy in\r\nMadrid!” said those who appreciated the human fear which they knew must\r\nbe concealed under the smiles demanded by the exigencies of her\r\nposition. Not a word of this was permitted to appear in the Press, of\r\ncourse. It was only the common talk of the common people. But one little\r\nparagraph slipped, through some mismanagement, into a popular paper,\r\nwhich revealed the Queen’s realisation of the danger she might be\r\nrunning. It was to the effect that “the alteration of their Majesties’\r\nitinerary, by which they would spend two days in Madrid instead of\r\ntravelling direct to Cataluña from Vienna, was dictated by the Queen’s\r\nwish to embrace her children before going to Barcelona.” The next day\r\nthe paragraph was corrected by a careful explanation that the Queen had\r\nwished to see the royal children because they were suffering from\r\nchildish ailments. But the people were not deceived by the second\r\nnotice. They said that Doña Victoria’s conduct was worthy of a Queen of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the people of Barcelona would hurt a hair of Queen\r\nVictoria’s head, nor that they would have raised a hand against King\r\nAlfonso had he appeared there during the riots of 1909: what advantage\r\nhis secret enemies might have taken of his presence during the\r\ndisturbances is another matter. And my personal belief is that the\r\npeople of Barcelona were not responsible for any of the bomb outrages\r\nwhich have made their city a byword in Europe.\r\n\r\nTwo things go to show that the industrial classes in Barcelona had\r\nnothing to do with the bombs. The first is that they are too clever to\r\ncommit stupid crimes by which their class could not possibly benefit.\r\nThe second is that during the “Red Week,” when Barcelona was given over\r\nto mob law, the mob, said to be responsible for the bomb outrages, did\r\nnot explode a single bomb. It is not likely that if letting off bombs\r\nwere the favourite occupation of the criminal classes of Barcelona, they\r\nwould have lost the opportunities afforded them during the first three\r\ndays of the riots. Yet when the rising was quelled and the whole\r\nprovince was under martial law, the bombs began again, and twenty-three\r\nwere reported to have been exploded between August 15th and October\r\n20th.\r\n\r\nThe stringent censorship exercised then and for three months afterwards\r\nprevented Europe from hearing of either this remarkable feature of the\r\nriots or their real object. But every one in Spain knew perfectly well\r\nthat the riots were directed solely against the Religious Orders,\r\nwhereas the bomb outrages never affected a building belonging to the\r\nChurch or a person attached to the Clericalist party so long as Maura\r\nheld office.\r\n\r\nIs there any previous instance in history of a mob, said to be composed\r\nof the lowest and most degraded of the community, firing monasteries,\r\nconvents, and churches, while they left public buildings, banks, and\r\nrich men’s dwellings untouched? Is there any other revolt on record in\r\nwhich troops of people containing the dregs of the criminal classes\r\nprotected and brought food to orphanages supported by the objects of\r\ntheir attack? And can we find a parallel, in the circumstances, to the\r\norganisation which had the markets opened for two hours every morning\r\nand kept its forces under such complete discipline that during those two\r\nhours persons of either sex could walk all over the town secure from\r\nmolestation?\r\n\r\nThese things I have heard from people of unimpeachable veracity who were\r\nin Barcelona at the time; not only Catalans and Spaniards, but also\r\nforeigners unconnected with any political party. I do not attempt to\r\ndeny that some half-hundred or so of buildings belonging to the Church\r\nand the Religious Orders were damaged or destroyed, nor that many evil\r\ndeeds were done by the criminal hangers-on of the movement; nor do I at\r\nall desire to minimise the crime of destroying property to gratify\r\nfeelings of personal revenge. But I do say that the mob, as a mob,\r\nbehaved with extraordinary self-restraint, and proved by their conduct\r\nthat they had no complicity with the miscreants who for so long\r\nterrorised the unoffending inhabitants of Barcelona by exploding bombs,\r\nwithout apparent intent to injure.\r\n\r\nNo one disputes that every suspect in the province was imprisoned or\r\nfled from the country when the iron hand of military law closed on the\r\ninsurgents. Nevertheless the bomb outrages began again after the “Red\r\nWeek” came to an end, and only ceased with the fall of Maura and his\r\nCabinet of repression.\r\n\r\nI have related in the previous chapter the continued shooting from the\r\nroofs of the town, after the riots were quelled, by persons who were\r\nnever seen, and the stories that were told of the secret arming of the\r\nReligious Orders. When we remember that the hope of the Ultramontanes\r\nlies in a Carlist restoration, which is only possible through a\r\nrevolution, and that a revolution cannot be brought about except by\r\nfomenting unrest and discontent in the country, and when further we\r\nrecall that the bomb explosions ceased with the fall of Maura’s\r\nMinistry, when the officials of a Government not in sympathy with the\r\naspirations of the Religious Orders might have instituted inconvenient\r\ninquiries had the bombs continued, it may at any rate be conjectured, in\r\nthe absence of any evidence as to who instigated this long series of\r\ncomparatively harmless outrages, that their authors were the only party\r\nwho expected to benefit by a subversion of the social order such as\r\nmight have ensued had the patience of the people given way under this\r\nlong series of provocations. This theory of the bombs, I may add, is\r\nthat held by the working classes.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that Moret took office in October, 1909, Barcelona began\r\nto resume her normal aspect, although the constitutional rights were not\r\nrestored until the new Civil Governor and the new Captain-General had\r\ntaken possession of their respective offices and reported that the whole\r\nprovince was quiet.\r\n\r\nFrom that date a strict watch was kept upon newspaper reports of\r\nexplosions, and the _Heraldo_ got into trouble for publishing a\r\nparagraph saying that what proved to have been merely a slight explosion\r\nof gas was a bomb. The authorities at once explained to the Press that\r\nthe explosion was purely accidental, and that no one in Barcelona had\r\nfor a moment believed it to be otherwise, yet the report that it was a\r\nbomb had reached the _Heraldo_ office in a form circumstantial enough to\r\ndeceive an experienced editor.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that doubts are now expressed whether a\r\ngood many of the alleged bombs may not have been as fictitious as this\r\nlast. The persons who let them off, or were supposed to have let them\r\noff, in order to maintain unrest in Barcelona, could certainly have\r\nprovided means to deceive the Press, as in the attempt upon the\r\n_Heraldo_, frustrated by the prompt action of the Civil Governor.\r\n\r\nTwo or three bombs, if they can be given so imposing a name, were\r\nexploded in Zaragoza in December, 1909, under the conditions which had\r\nbecome so familiar to Barcelona under the Maura regime. They were made\r\nof bits of old iron, mixed with some mild form of explosive and placed\r\nin a meat tin, the whole being wrapped in a black cotton material, said\r\nto be of the same make as that found on remains of bombs at Barcelona.\r\nThe tin cans on these occasions were placed in or near the porch of a\r\nconvent church, and no harm was done beyond some slight damage to the\r\nplaster on the walls. The progressive Press, freed from censorship,\r\nexpressed the conviction that this affair was the work of the monks,\r\ndesirous of raising disturbances in Zaragoza because they were now\r\npowerless to do so in Barcelona, with the result that the public\r\nremained entirely indifferent to the incident. One cannot but hope,\r\ntherefore, that that may have been the expiring effort of the\r\nbomb-throwers, whatever their real purpose was and whoever their\r\nemployers may have been.\r\n\r\nI should like, before closing this branch of my subject, to point out\r\nonce more the wide differences that exist between the methods, objects,\r\nand results of the Barcelona and Zaragoza bomb outrages and those of\r\nsimilar attempts elsewhere on the Continent. The murderous anarchist\r\nmakes a direct attack on the personage whose death he believes to be\r\nnecessary to the furtherance of his political creed, and when he lets\r\noff a bomb he takes care that it shall do as much damage as possible,\r\nregardless of risk to himself. Abhorrent though the creed of the\r\nmilitant anarchist is, he has at least the courage of his convictions,\r\nsince he so frequently pays the penalty of his act with his life. The\r\nwretch who tried to murder the King and Queen of Spain on their\r\nwedding-day was the tool of some one working on the usual anarchist\r\nlines, and his crime bore no resemblance in detail to the work of the\r\nmysterious party interested in terrorising, without injuring, the\r\ninhabitants of Barcelona.\r\n\r\nA volume of school statistics published in November, 1909, to which\r\nfurther reference is made in another chapter, shows that there are in\r\nSpain 91 protestant and 107 lay schools, 43 of which are in Barcelona.\r\nOn the other hand, there are 5,000 private Catholic schools, in addition\r\nto some 25,000 Government schools, in which the rudiments of the\r\nCatholic religion are supposed to be taught. These few Protestant and\r\nlay schools are the subject of furious and unceasing abuse from the\r\nClericalist party and Press, who make every effort to traduce and vilify\r\nthem. It would not be edifying, nor is it necessary, to cull specimens\r\nof their flowers of invective: the language in which the _odium\r\ntheologicum_ is habitually expressed is tolerably well known. The\r\nschools in Barcelona, many of which were established by Ferrer, who\r\ndevoted his fortune to the work of education, are the special subject of\r\nclerical hostility, and there is no doubt that they cost him his life.\r\nAs far as can be learnt about these schools the teaching given in them\r\ncontains absolutely nothing of the socialistic or anarchistic or other\r\ndoctrines subversive of society of which their enemies so freely accuse\r\nthem. They are more or less hostile to the form of religion taught by\r\nthe Church in Spain, which is the chief reason for the venom with which\r\nthey are attacked; but setting this on one side, there is, I am credibly\r\ninformed, nothing either in the text-books used or the teaching given to\r\nwhich objection need be taken.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the Clericalist campaign against these schools is carried\r\non without intermission, and at the end of February, 1910, about the\r\ntime that Moret fell, unusual efforts were made against them. Thus in\r\nValencia several thousands of priests and friars, ladies of the\r\naristocracy, and members of the militant religious associations filled\r\nthe great open-air theatre of Jai-Alai: a telegram giving the Papal\r\nbenediction to the objects of the meeting was read, and cheers for the\r\nPretender were raised at intervals during the afternoon. The reactionary\r\npapers asserted that twenty thousand people were present on this\r\noccasion, and although this was doubtless an exaggeration, no one\r\nattempted to deny that a very large number attended.\r\n\r\nThe number of public bodies and associations said to have sent letters\r\nand telegrams of adherence to the objects of the meeting would be\r\nalarming to any one unacquainted with the arithmetical methods employed\r\non these occasions in Spain. The grand total was given at 280,000,\r\n“composed of 100 newspapers, 83 town councils, 135 mayors, 429 clubs,\r\n1,714 congregations, and 272 parishes.” But no names of these parishes\r\nand congregations were given, and verification of the figures is\r\nimpossible. It was also said that “9,000” ladies who had been present at\r\nthe meeting subsequently left their cards on the Civil Governor.\r\n\r\nAdmission to the meeting was by ticket, and there were not wanting\r\nworking men who declared that whole villages had been coerced into\r\nattending by the action of their priests and their caciques, but I give\r\nthis for what it is worth. It is, however, safe to say that the great\r\nmajority of those present were priests and friars, and members of the\r\nupper classes. Only one speech by a working man was mentioned in the\r\nlong report published in the _Correo Español_, although the Clericalist\r\npapers always give prominence to the smallest indication of sympathy\r\nwith their cause on the part of the people.\r\n\r\nThe really serious feature in the affair was the Papal benediction of\r\nthe speakers and the audience. There is nothing in the Constitution to\r\nforbid the existence of the lay schools, to protest against which the\r\nmeeting was held. Thus the Pope, by his benediction, set the seal of his\r\napproval upon an effort to subvert, in this respect, the Constitution\r\nof the country. But, further, the introduction by the speakers of the\r\nname of the Pretender and the reception given to references to him\r\nturned the whole affair into a frankly seditious gathering. The Pope’s\r\nsupport of the meeting was the more significant because his official\r\nreception of Don Jaime at the Vatican had been reported by the Spanish\r\nand foreign Press a few days before.\r\n\r\nThe Valencia meeting was followed by others in many of the large towns,\r\nand about this time Count Romanones, in his capacity of Minister of\r\nEducation, closed a lay school[18] on the pretext that it was\r\ninsanitary, but this only irritated the Liberals without conciliating\r\nthe Church party, and Romanones hastily declared that the school would\r\nbe re-opened as soon as certain structural alterations had been made.\r\n\r\nOn February 27th a Clericalist meeting was held at Bilbao, at which,\r\nnotwithstanding the efforts of the police and Civil Guards, serious\r\ndisturbances occurred. The circulars inviting people to the meeting were\r\nso inflammatory in tone that the Civil Governor found it necessary to\r\nsuppress some of them. The following extracts from one of these will\r\ngive an idea of the kind of language employed.\r\n\r\n“In the name of religion outraged, and society menaced with total ruin\r\n... and in the name of our own personal independence, closely bound up\r\nwith the faith in our souls, let us go to the Catholic meeting to\r\nprotest against the ignorance of those who desire to separate us from\r\nall other civilised nations, tearing faith and Christian morality from\r\nthe souls of the young, together with all decency, all virtue, and every\r\nquality necessary to human dignity.... We unite our voices with those of\r\nall Catholics, speaking through the mouths of the most eminent men of\r\nscience, to condemn this monstrous birth engendered by error and lies.”\r\n\r\nThe Liberal element in Bilbao is strong, and naturally great indignation\r\nwas created among the working classes by these insults to their politics\r\nand religion. Down to that date there had been no lay school in the\r\ncity, but now it was announced that one would be opened immediately.\r\n\r\nThe noteworthy feature of this meeting was a denunciation of the\r\nConservatives by a Carlist speaker, who included them with the Liberals\r\nin his fulmination against the “cowardly incendiaries of Barcelona,”\r\nurging the Catholics “to have done with patient endurance and enter\r\nupon the period of action.” The result of this was that the\r\nConservatives of Bilbao refrained from sending any representative of\r\ntheir party to the banquet given after the meeting to the orators who\r\nhad spoken at it, thus definitely dissociating themselves from the\r\npolicy of the Clericalists in their city.\r\n\r\nI have made special mention of two of these demonstrations against the\r\nlay schools, one because of its magnitude and importance, the other\r\nbecause of its results. To chronicle more of them would be tedious and\r\nunnecessary. The campaign against these schools is unceasing: the\r\ndefence is by no means equal in vigour to the attack, and is limited to\r\narticles now and then in the _Pais_ and an occasional meeting in their\r\nsupport. Whether this apparent indifference is due to weakness on the\r\npart of those who uphold the lay schools, or to a feeling of strength\r\nwhich can afford to despise the fulminations of opponents, I am unable\r\nto say. It is a quarrel, as the satirist says,\r\n\r\n    “_Ubi tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY, PAST AND PRESENT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CONSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n[To face page 199.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY, PAST AND PRESENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is allowed that great abuses were committed by those in power during\r\nthe long war in Cuba, which ended with the struggle in the United States\r\nand the final expulsion of Spain from the last of her American colonies,\r\nand it is common knowledge that the munitions, provisions, and all the\r\nsupplies of the Army fell lamentably short of what was required. It may\r\nbe imagined, therefore, that the survivors of these long years of\r\nwarfare brought back stories of experiences little calculated to inspire\r\ntheir friends with confidence in the governing classes, who were\r\nresponsible for such shortcomings. Fully to appreciate the difference\r\nbetween the sentiment of the Army to-day and what it was so late as\r\n1901, when the defeated troops from the lost colonies came home with\r\ntheir tale of suffering, it is necessary to show what convictions have\r\nhad to be changed and what prejudices overcome by Don Alfonso before he\r\ncould win the place which he now holds in the affections of his\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nI will only deal with the rank and file, whose loyalty is even of more\r\nimportance to the nation than that of the officers. My own impression is\r\nthat, after making all due allowance for differences in politics and\r\ntraditions, the great majority of the Spanish officers to-day are\r\nstaunch supporters of the Monarchy and the Constitution they have sworn\r\nto uphold. But beyond putting on record my private opinion, formed on\r\nthe utterances of officers of all arms, I do not propose to deal with\r\nthis side of the question.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that reminiscences of the Cuban and American Wars should\r\nbe continually brought forward during the operations in Morocco, and\r\nthat the popular expectation of the treatment the troops would there\r\nreceive should be based on what took place in Cuba; and it was\r\ninevitable that the unlettered mass of the community, agitated as they\r\nwere in the early days of the war by rumours of wholesale massacre and\r\ntales of thousands of dead and wounded, should have imagined that their\r\nfriends and relatives were once more being sacrificed without mercy on\r\nthe altar of political corruption. Not long ago I heard the following\r\nconversation among a party of working people who were entertaining a\r\nsoldier at a tavern on the eve of his departure for Melilla.\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” said a stout elderly matron, with a tear in her eye. “So\r\nyoung and so good-looking, to be killed by the Moors!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t distress yourself, Señora,” said the lad, a slim, active young\r\nfellow. “I’m going to make mincemeat of at least eight before they kill\r\nme, and I shall be in no greater danger there than up at the mines\r\nof ----, where I was knocked to pieces by a landslide. Three months I’ve\r\nbeen in hospital, and it’s just like my luck to be called out to Melilla\r\nthe moment I get out. I’m not afraid. If they kill me it can’t hurt more\r\nthan that landslide did.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll sing a different song when he gets out there,” remarked an\r\nelderly man gloomily. “I know how the soldiers are treated--not enough\r\nto eat, and that bad, no clothes, no beds, and no cartridges to put into\r\ntheir rifles when they go into action. I saw it with my own eyes in\r\nCuba.”\r\n\r\nI ventured to suggest that Melilla was nearer to the resources of Spain\r\nthan Cuba, and that the general condition of military affairs had\r\nconsiderably improved of late years.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you believe it!” said the old soldier. “The Government sold Cuba\r\nto put money into their own pockets, and they will do the same in\r\nMorocco. Do you know what happened to us one day in the Cuban War? We\r\nfound ourselves attacked by the enemy, and we had nothing, _nothing_ to\r\nfight with. There were no officers; the chiefs were in a safe place,\r\nspending the money they had robbed us of (for we got no pay), and the\r\ninferiors were hiding from the Cubanos wherever they could, behind us,\r\nto be out of the fighting. I assure you this is true. When the Cubanos\r\ncame upon us we tried to load the guns, but many of the balls did not\r\nfit, and we had no wadding.[19] We tore up our white drawers and our\r\nshirts to make wadding, but what was the good? It was hopeless for us to\r\nfight. And seeing the enemy upon us and we helpless to defend ourselves,\r\nwe went mad with rage and despair and turned on each other, not knowing\r\nwhat we were doing. It was all the fault of the Jesuits at home, who\r\nstole the money which the nation gave for the Army. And it will be the\r\nsame thing now with this Maura and his Jesuits, you will see!”\r\n\r\n“It is all quite true,” said another old man. “My son has often told me\r\nthe same. He said they tied their officers to the gun-carriages in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FORT ON MOUNT GURUGÚ.\r\n\r\nThe War in Melilla.]\r\n\r\nhis company more than once to prevent them from running away. They said:\r\n‘If we, the common soldiers, are to be killed like flies, at least you,\r\nthe officers, shall take your share.’”\r\n\r\nWith such traditions firmly embedded in the popular belief, it would not\r\nhave been surprising had a real spirit of mutiny been shown on the\r\ncalling out the reservists in July, 1909. But this was not the case.\r\n\r\nIn an interview given to a representative of _Le Journal_ of Paris, in\r\nNovember, 1909, by General Primo de Rivera, who was Minister of War\r\nprevious to the disasters of July, that officer threw some light on\r\nSeñor Maura’s conduct of military affairs, and explained why he had no\r\nalternative but to retire from office, to be abused by the Clericalists\r\nin power as “unpatriotic” for so doing. Here is a brief résumé of his\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n“From the moment I took office, foreseeing what was brewing at Melilla,\r\nI began to fortify our positions in the Riff. Expecting that General\r\nMarina would need reinforcements, I brought the regiments of the\r\nCazadores del Campo de Gibraltar up to their full strength, and put the\r\nOrozco Division, in all three arms of the service, on a war footing. In\r\norder to secure rapidity of transport, I contracted with the\r\nTransatlantica Company to make the voyage in twenty-four hours, on only\r\nfour hours’ notice. When General Linares replaced me in the Ministry, he\r\nthought fit to improvise all that was required, and this caused complete\r\ndisorganisation in the Army. He refused to call out the divisions which\r\nI had held in readiness, and by drawing the troops from Cataluña not\r\nonly gave rise to the melancholy events of the “Red Week,” but rendered\r\nit necessary to incorporate many reservists who had married and set up\r\nhomes in the belief that they were free from service, thus bringing\r\nmisery on thousands of previously contented families. And after all this\r\nmismanagement it was necessary in the end to send the Orozco Division\r\nwhich I had prepared so long before.”\r\n\r\nAt the time one heard on all sides the question: “Why does the\r\nGovernment call out the reservists while the Orozco Division stands idle\r\nat home?” to which there has never been any reply but that of the\r\npeople, who said: “The Government wants the war to go on because it\r\nsuits the Jesuits, who are making a fortune out of it.”\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the acute distress throughout the country, the\r\nreports of an organised and widespread protest against the calling out\r\nof the reserves, which flooded the foreign Press at the time, were\r\nentirely unjustified and incorrect. Parents in Madrid wrote, full of\r\nanxiety, to their children in provincial towns, saying: “What is all\r\nthis we hear about disturbances in your city? What is happening? What\r\nhave the reservists been doing?” While the children were writing with\r\nequal urgency to ask what was amiss in the capital, that “such bad\r\nthings” were being said of the soldiers in Madrid. I know these reports\r\nwere spread, for I was asked to read aloud more than one such letter by\r\nworking people who could not read for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the people discovered that they had been deceived\r\nand vilified by some persons unknown, who were making it their business\r\nto represent Spain as in the throes of a revolution, and it was then\r\nthat they became convinced that the rising in Cataluña, represented by\r\nthe Government as springing from a protest against the calling out of\r\nthe reserves, was in fact a Carlist plot, gone wrong so far as the\r\nCarlists were concerned.\r\n\r\nAs one travelled about the country in 1909 it seemed as if every village\r\nhad sent one or more of its sons to Melilla. Yet, although their\r\nfamilies made sure that they were going straight to destruction, few\r\nendeavours were made to evade the call to arms.\r\n\r\nI heard one man, an artisan, say with a shrug of his shoulders that he\r\nwas going because he might as well be shot in action as shot for a\r\ndeserter at home, and I saw another fling himself flat on the platform\r\nwhen the train came in, howling that “he was afraid of being killed and\r\ndidn’t want to go to the war.” The first was a professed republican; the\r\nsecond, as the bystanders promptly informed me, was “drunk, as usual.”\r\n\r\nVery likely there were other cases of the same kind, but they were\r\ncertainly exceptional. I made it my business to travel as much as I\r\ncould at that time, on purpose to observe the people, for, knowing the\r\nSpanish peasant, I did not believe the tales current in the foreign\r\nPress of his cowardly and mutinous conduct, and I wished to see for\r\nmyself how he behaved. I saw no such disgraceful exhibitions as were\r\ndescribed by English and French journalists.\r\n\r\nThe conversations that I overheard were very naïve: not at all the talk\r\nof a rebellious people, notwithstanding the tales of suffering in Cuba\r\nand in the Carlist wars which balked so large in the popular\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n“My son! my son!” wailed one woman. “They will kill thee! I shall never\r\nsee thee again!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, mother!” answered the young man. “Rest assured that if they do\r\nkill me I shall have killed plenty of them first.”\r\n\r\n“Why will they not let us women go too!” cried another mother. “We could\r\nkill all the _Moras_ [female Moors] and then they would bring no more\r\nlittle Moors into the world to be the ruin of Spain.”\r\n\r\nIt was curious to observe how the eternal race-hatred came out at the\r\nvery name of Moor--the tradition of the long contest between Christian\r\nand Moslem. The Moors of Morocco cannot be held to have inflicted any\r\nserious injury on the nation for many centuries past, yet such is the\r\nforce of ancient tradition among the peasantry that the very name of\r\n_Moro_ calls forth the cry, “They are the ruin of Spain,” and if you ask\r\nfor an explanation you will be told that “The Moors are always pressing\r\nupon us and trying to take our country from us.”\r\n\r\nOne pathetic yet humorous incident was related by the Infanta Doña Paz\r\n(aunt to Don Alfonso) in a letter which she wrote to the Press about\r\nthis time, exhorting her fellow-countrywomen to have patience and be of\r\ngood courage. Describing her experiences of the patriotism of the men\r\nand the devotion of the women, she told how a poor mother, learning that\r\nher son was ordered to report himself for service, followed him from\r\nvillage to village, as he pursued his avocation of pedlar, carrying his\r\nregimental trousers, which had been put away in the family\r\nclothes-chest. When she found him at last, there was barely time for him\r\nto catch the appointed train, and the two hurried together to the\r\nstation with the trousers flapping like a flag as they ran.\r\n\r\nThe sons of mothers like these do not shirk their duty when called upon\r\nto fight for their country. I believe that if the whole truth were told,\r\nwe should find that no one was more indignant at the protest supposed to\r\nhave been initiated by the working classes of Barcelona than the\r\nreservists whose grievances were its ostensible object.\r\n\r\nFresh from an exceptionally rough crossing, weak with sea-sickness,\r\nrusty in their drill after three years of home life, the reservists who\r\nsailed from Barcelona found themselves led straight from the ship on to\r\nthe field of battle. This I had from a naval officer on the man-of-war\r\nthat took them out.\r\n\r\n“If they had been veterans,” he said, “such a situation would have been\r\ntrying to them, and they were only raw fellows who hardly remembered the\r\nwords of command. And yet I tell you they behaved with such courage and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RESERVIST At THE FRONT.\r\n\r\n[To face page 208.]\r\n\r\ndiscipline that I felt proud to be among them. I was sorry and ashamed\r\nto see those sea-sick boys ordered into action, but now I am glad to\r\nremember what I saw my compatriots do that day.”\r\n\r\nThe naval officer spoke of an incident in the early days of the war,\r\nbefore the foreign correspondents had reached the scene of action. But\r\nfor some time the censors, both at the front and in Madrid, had made it\r\nimpossible for the truth about the campaign to be told; and England, at\r\nany rate, was for several weeks allowed to remain under the impression\r\nthat the Spanish rank and file were a cowardly lot, driven into action\r\nat the point of their officers’ swords. That impression was corrected as\r\ntime went on, and it is, I believe, now generally admitted that the\r\nSpanish troops do not lack courage.\r\n\r\nIn Spain the conscripts join at the age of eighteen, and serve three\r\nyears with the colours, when they are drafted into the first reserve.\r\nBut those who can afford it may buy exemption from service for 1,500\r\npesetas (say £60), and from this source the Government makes an income\r\nestimated in the Budget for 1909 at pesetas 12,800,000 (about £512,000).\r\nNaturally the well-to-do always buy themselves out, as do also a certain\r\nnumber of the more prosperous of the working classes in the industrial\r\ntowns. Señor Maura’s Government, not long before they went out, suddenly\r\nmade an order calling on all those who had already bought their\r\nexemption to pay another 500 pesetas or join the colours at once, a\r\nproceeding which, differing as it does in no respect from highway\r\nrobbery, naturally caused a good deal of indignation. No one likes to be\r\ncalled on to pay a second time over for what he has already bought; and\r\nin the case of the workmen, who generally secure themselves against\r\nservice by means of one of the numerous insurance companies formed _ad\r\nhoc_, the premiums they had already paid were of course thrown away, and\r\nfew indeed of them could produce 500 pesetas at a moment’s notice.\r\n\r\nA scheme is on foot for doing away with the present unjust system, and\r\nmaking service compulsory on all alike. It provides for six months’\r\ninstead of three years’ service with the colours, the term to be\r\nextended, in the case of the illiterate, until they can read and write.\r\n\r\nThis scheme obtained from the first the support of the whole Liberal,\r\nRadical, and Republican Press, but the opposition of the Clericalists\r\nmust always be counted on in Spain, and the proposals most obviously\r\nbeneficial to the nation are usually those which meet with the\r\nstrongest opposition. Another popular clause in the scheme affects the\r\nofficers, whose pay is small. At present the officers live where they\r\ncan: they have no mess, and their quarters in barracks are so much the\r\nreverse of luxurious that a lieutenant in a smart regiment apologised\r\nfor not asking me to visit him there, as he, knowing our English\r\ncustoms, would have liked to do, because, said he, “it is not fit for an\r\nEnglishman to see.”\r\n\r\nIt is now proposed, in order to reduce the cost of living in the Army,\r\nthat quarters and a mess shall be provided for the officers in barracks.\r\nMost Spanish officers have to live on their pay, and even a captain in\r\nthe cavalry only gets about £140 a year. On the other hand, their social\r\nexpenses are very small, subscription dances, dinners, sports, and the\r\nnumerous calls on the purse of a British officer being unknown in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE POLICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Spain is frequently struck with the number of persons\r\nwhom he meets on all sides clad in various uniforms and armed, some with\r\ncutlasses alone, others with revolvers in addition. If he asks who they\r\nare, he is told that they are the police, and then he is perplexed to\r\nfind such a large number of distinct bodies, all apparently performing\r\nmuch the same duties. A few words of explanation as to the various\r\npolice-forces of the country and their different functions may not be\r\nout of place.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, every town has its body of municipal police, under\r\nthe orders of the Alcalde. Their chief duty is to regulate the traffic,\r\nto maintain order in the streets, and to report to the Town Council any\r\ninfraction of the municipal by-laws, and to another body of police\r\nanything or any person whom they may regard as suspicious or a possible\r\ndanger to the public security. They do not themselves, as a rule,\r\narrest malefactors, though no doubt they are empowered to do so on\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThese policemen are well-intentioned, but on the whole ineffective, not\r\nfrom any fault of their own so much as from the conditions of their\r\nappointment and tenure of place. In Spain anything can be done by\r\ninfluence, and it is practically impossible to enforce the by-laws\r\nagainst a person in high place who chooses to break them. Not long ago I\r\nwas at an exhibition, which a very great number of people had gone to\r\nsee on that particular day. The municipal police were doing their best\r\nto make the crowd “pass along,” but at one point there was a block,\r\ncaused by one or two well-dressed men who refused to move. I asked the\r\npoliceman why he did not make them, and he replied that one of them was\r\nSo-and-so (a person of local importance) and that if he said anything to\r\nhim he would find himself dismissed the next day![20] In a certain town\r\nnot long ago a body of police inspectors was established, whose duty it\r\nwas to supervise the municipal police and report derelictions of duty,\r\nand as far as I could learn they were doing useful work. After about\r\nthree months they all disappeared. On inquiry I was told that the\r\nreason of their suppression was that one of them had reported the\r\ncarriage of some duke or marquis for obstructing the traffic, and that\r\nthe indignant nobleman had insisted on and obtained the abolition of the\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThe municipal police go off duty about 8 p.m., and are replaced by the\r\n_serenos_ or night-watchmen, who patrol the streets all night carrying a\r\npike and a lantern, and in some towns still cry the hours. Hence their\r\nname, from their not unmusical cry, “_Las doce han dado y sereno_”\r\n(“twelve o’clock”--or whatever the hour is--“and a fine night.”)\r\n\r\nAlongside of the municipal police is what is known as the _Vigilancia_.\r\nIt is they who have to deal with criminals of all sorts within their own\r\ndistricts, arrest pickpockets and other offenders, investigate thefts,\r\nmurders, &c., and catch the guilty. To them the hotels report the\r\narrival and departure of guests, and it is their business to find any\r\npersons who are wanted on extradition warrants. In short, they perform\r\nmost of the ordinary police duties except those assigned to the\r\nmunicipal police.\r\n\r\nThere is also a body of rural police, whose duty it is to patrol the\r\ncountry districts; they are few in number and not particularly\r\neffective. It is not often that one runs across any of them, even in\r\ntheir own districts.\r\n\r\nThe most important and by far the finest body of men in Spain is the\r\nCivil Guard, popularly known as the _Benemerita_ (well-deserving). This\r\nforce is one which, both in physique and morale, would do credit to any\r\ncountry in the world. They are under very strict discipline, and are\r\nprevented as far as possible from associating with any one outside of\r\ntheir own body--for instance, with the ordinary police-forces. Even the\r\nofficers are under stricter regulations than those of the regular Army.\r\nI was told of one case where a junior officer, after due warning, was\r\nbroke for gambling. The force is officered from the regular Army, and so\r\nhighly is the service esteemed that an officer who obtains a commission\r\nin the Civil Guard _ipso facto_ loses a step. Very great care is\r\nexercised both in their selection and in recruiting the rank and file.\r\n\r\nThey are something in the nature of a military police, and may be\r\ngenerally compared to the Irish Constabulary; they do not perform\r\nordinary police duties, but in case of anything serious, such as a riot,\r\nthey would act, and they are expected to hunt down and catch malefactors\r\nwho are escaping from justice--which, indeed, they usually succeed in\r\ndoing. They practically have power of life and death, as if, in the\r\nexecution of their duty, they think it necessary to shoot, no questions\r\nare asked. They always go about in couples, a young man accompanying an\r\nolder one, sometimes on foot, generally on horseback. They are the\r\nterror of evildoers, and some years ago entirely stamped out the\r\nbrigandage which was then rife in the South of Spain, by the simple\r\nexpedient of shooting down the brigands wherever they caught them. But I\r\nhave never heard it suggested that they abuse their powers, and every\r\none, foreigners as well as Spaniards, speaks well of them. Moreover--and\r\nthis is rare in Spain--they are said, I believe with truth, to be\r\nincorruptible, and everybody has the utmost confidence in them.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to this force being called on to protect the\r\nnervous nuns and the ostensibly non-militant clergy during the\r\nanticlericalist demonstrations in November, 1909. It may be interesting\r\nto show how they regarded the political situation at that time,\r\npremising that as they are in daily contact with the people, no body in\r\nthe kingdom has its finger more closely pressed on the public pulse.\r\n\r\n“You seem to have had your work for nothing,” I remarked to a couple of\r\nmy friends at their barracks on the evening after one of the\r\ndemonstrations. “I never saw a more orderly crowd.”\r\n\r\n“What did you expect?” they replied. “These are political matters in\r\nwhich we take no part beyond going where we are ordered. It seems to be\r\nthe fashion to talk about the prevalence of anarchical ideas in our\r\ncountry, so presumably it suits some persons that the public should\r\nthink our people are anarchists. But _we_ see no symptoms of it. No\r\ndoubt it is right for the authorities to take precautions if they\r\nbelieve there are fellows of that sort about. It is not our place to\r\ninquire why they believe in a condition of affairs which we know does\r\nnot exist. The Civil Governor naturally does not ask for our opinion on\r\nmatters connected with politics. If he did we could tell him that he\r\nneed not be nervous, for anarchy is a disease which does not progress in\r\nour nation, at any rate in any part of the districts _we_ have to travel\r\nover.”\r\n\r\nRemarks of this tenour have been made to me by members of the force in\r\nmany times and in many places. A couple of Civil Guards accompany every\r\ntrain, and detachments of them are stationed in every town and village,\r\nin addition to mounted men charged with the care of the rural districts.\r\nThey are continually changed from place to place, to prevent any danger\r\nof becoming too friendly with those they are intended to control, and\r\nthe result is that they have an exhaustive knowledge of the feeling of\r\nthe people. A Government genuinely desirous of gauging the popular point\r\nof view at any crisis need only apply to the _Benemerita_ for\r\ninformation. But so long as the Civil Governors who command the Civil\r\nGuard are appointed for party purposes and changed with every change in\r\nthe Government, this means of contact between the Government and the\r\ngoverned will be neglected in the interests of party.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the Civil Guard talk in public about the\r\nduty with which they are entrusted. On the contrary, their non-committal\r\nattitude is always honourably maintained before their fellow-countrymen.\r\nBut when I travel alone with them--for I frequently take a second-class\r\nticket merely for the sake of their company--they are not unwilling to\r\nexpress an opinion on affairs in general, feeling secure that I, as an\r\nEnglishman, can be trusted not to turn anything they may say to their\r\ndisadvantage. Before Spaniards they are extremely reserved, but when the\r\ncompartment is empty save for myself and them conversation runs easily.\r\n\r\nI was struck by this one day when a hot-headed individual shouted his\r\nvehemently Radical views to a friend at the opposite end of the\r\ncarriage. The second-class carriages in many parts of the country are\r\nonly divided half-way up, so that it is not unusual to talk from one end\r\nto the other on country lines where simple manners prevail. The Radical\r\nknelt on his seat and his opponent stood up on his, and the passengers\r\nsitting between them chimed in at intervals. The Constitution was\r\nsuspended at the time, and Señor Maura would certainly have had the\r\nwhole company clapped into prison had he heard what was said. But the\r\nCivil Guards turned a deaf ear, affecting to be entirely absorbed in\r\ntheir cigarettes. Later on I took an opportunity of asking what they\r\nthought of the oratorical exhibition we had been favoured with.\r\n\r\n“We think nothing at all, and that is just how much it is worth,” they\r\nsaid. “We know that gentleman very well, and he would no more commit an\r\nact of violence or an offence against the law than we would ourselves.\r\nBut all Spaniards love talking, and if he could not relieve himself by\r\nthat sort of gabble he might become a danger to the public peace. There\r\nare a fair number of his kidney scattered about the country, though they\r\nare chiefly to be found in the big northern cities. They revel in the\r\nnonsense spouted at Republican meetings and love to read out violent\r\narticles from the _Pais_ and the _Motin_, but they are quite satisfied\r\nwith talking. Very few indeed of them would fire a shot for what they\r\ncall their principles. That is why we never take any notice of what they\r\nsay before us in the trains or elsewhere. We know it means nothing and\r\nis an excellent safety-valve. If Maura had done as we always do--let\r\nthem talk and take no notice--there would have been no riots in\r\nBarcelona. But Spaniards have hot tempers, and if you make them angry,\r\ntrouble begins. What harm does their talk do to any one? You have only\r\nto reflect that they are pretty nearly all fathers of families, who know\r\nvery well that any such revolution as they romance about would only make\r\nit ten times harder for them to earn a living for their children, and\r\nGod knows it is hard enough already to live in our country. We have to\r\neat beans and bread, and often don’t get enough even of that. Do you\r\nimagine that any working man wants civil war in the country to make his\r\nfood dearer still? _Ca!_ Let them talk! It amuses them and it makes no\r\ndifference to the Government. Whichever party is in power the poor have\r\nthe same difficulty in bringing up their families.”\r\n\r\nThe Civil Guards had to shut their ears to a good deal of conversation\r\nwhich the Ultramontane Government would have found it desirable to\r\nsuppress, during the three months after the “Red Week” in Cataluña; for\r\nthe attitude of the people towards the priests and Religious Orders, not\r\nonly in the North of Spain, but all over the country, became daily more\r\naggressive, and I have frequently admired the tact and good temper with\r\nwhich members of that force contrived to do their duty and yet avoid\r\nfanning the embers of discontent into a blaze of passion.\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes remarked to me that it is the Civil Guard who\r\nreally govern Spain, and that without them anarchy would shortly ensue.\r\nSo far as the maintenance of public order is concerned, there is a good\r\ndeal of truth in this remark. They go quietly about their business,\r\nnever interfering with any one unless there is need, but if there is,\r\ntheir intervention is immediately and conclusively efficacious. They are\r\nat once feared and respected, and it is only in extreme cases that\r\nresistance to them is ever attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DON SEGISMUNDO MORET.\r\n\r\nLeader of the Liberal-Monarchists.\r\n\r\n[To face page 227.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPOLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparently purposeless and kaleidoscopic changes in Spanish politics\r\nare very apt to puzzle foreign observers, who cannot understand what has\r\nhappened to bring about the resignation of a Minister or an entire\r\nCabinet, for which the cause, if any, alleged in the papers seems wholly\r\ninadequate. Internal and external affairs appear to be pursuing a\r\ntranquil course: no disputed question is agitating the country or the\r\nCortes, when suddenly comes a bolt from the blue in the shape of an\r\nannouncement of a Ministerial crisis, and the Government is changed.\r\nThus, early in the year 1910, Señor Moret, who after overthrowing the\r\nGovernment of Maura in the previous October, seemed to be pretty firmly\r\nseated in the saddle, suddenly resigned, in spite of the fact that at\r\nthe municipal elections a month or so before his policy had been\r\nendorsed by overwhelming majorities all over the country. One of the\r\nEnglish newspapers, in commenting on this seemingly inexplicable change\r\nof Ministry, frankly confessed that it was useless for foreigners to\r\nattempt to understand Spanish politics.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, Ministerial changes in Spain are the outcome of a\r\ntacit arrangement made some thirty years ago between Canovas and\r\nSagasta, the then leaders of the two main parties, the Liberals and the\r\nConservatives, and continued by their successors, that each side should\r\nhave its fair share of the loaves and fishes. After one party had been\r\nin office three or four years it was agreed by common consent that the\r\ntime had come for the other side to have a turn. Thus, as Major Martin\r\nHume says:[21] “Dishonest Governments are faced in sham battle by\r\ndishonest Oppositions, and parliamentary institutions, instead of being\r\na public check upon abuses, are simply a mask behind which a large\r\nnumber of politicians may carry on their nefarious trade with impunity.”\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, though more rarely, another cause operates to upset\r\nGovernments, and that is the underground intrigues of disappointed\r\nplace-hunters. If the Premier in his distribution of appointments\r\nhappens to omit any important person or section of people who think\r\nthemselves entitled to a share in the plums of office, they will not\r\nhesitate to join with political opponents and turn out their own nominal\r\nleader, if circumstances happen to make this possible.\r\n\r\nIt is often said by foreign critics that the people--the mass of the\r\nnation--are to blame for the sins of their Governments. They have the\r\nfranchise: if they are not satisfied, why do they not elect better men?\r\n\r\nThis criticism proceeds from ignorance of an important factor in Spanish\r\npolitics--one of the tentacles of the octopus of corruption which holds\r\nthe whole country in its grip.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact is that the great mass of the people have no voice at\r\nall in the election of their representatives. Nominally voting is free:\r\nactually it is not.[22]\r\n\r\nThe whole administrative system is centralised in Madrid, and the\r\nvarious Government offices interfere in local affairs to an extent\r\ninconceivable to an Englishman, accustomed for generations to manage his\r\nown affairs his own way. One result of this is that the elections to the\r\nCortes are, in fact if not in theory, conducted from Madrid. In every\r\nsmall town and rural district there is a person known as the _Cacique_,\r\nusually a large employer of labour or a moneylender, to whom most of the\r\nworking population of the district look for employment, or in whose debt\r\nthey are. So enormous is the usury that once a loan has been raised,\r\nmany a borrower has been unable to free himself from debt for the rest\r\nof his life. I have known cases where as much as 75 per cent. per annum\r\nhas been paid for a trifling loan. Thus the _Cacique_, whether as\r\nemployer or moneylender, or both, has the majority of the constituency\r\nunder his thumb. He receives his instructions from Madrid, and issues\r\nhis orders accordingly. If by chance the voting goes wrong, the returns\r\nare falsified; but this does not often happen, for the voters are so\r\nconvinced that the exercise of their legal right of choice, if in\r\nopposition to the wish of the authorities, will result in loss of\r\nemployment, that either they abstain or they vote as they are ordered.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the _Cacique_ is one of the great obstacles to any\r\neffective decentralisation. If the villages and rural districts were\r\ngiven the management of their own affairs, the _Cacique_ would be more\r\nabsolute than ever. One can hardly open a paper without finding a report\r\nof some case of his arbitrary interference with local matters. If he is,\r\nas he usually is, the friend or creature of the Civil Governor of the\r\nProvince, who is the nominee of the Ministry, he does what he likes and\r\nthere is no redress against his illegal and oppressive action.\r\n\r\nThe following stories illustrate the method of conducting elections in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne man complained that a Conservative had given him a dollar for his\r\nvote, and after he had voted he found that the dollar was bad. “Had I\r\nnot already voted, how gladly would I have given you gentlemen the\r\nadvantage!” he said to a group of Liberals. “But you see I am left\r\nwithout my vote in exchange for a bad dollar. Never again will I sell my\r\nvote to the Conservatives!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother rascal went to the office of a Liberal paper to complain that “a\r\nthief” had contracted with him to engage some twenty fellow-rogues to\r\nvote to order. He fulfilled his part of the contract and took his twenty\r\nto the poll, but when he went to claim his pay the contractor had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n“And here I am many pesetas out of pocket,” he lamented; “for not only\r\nhave I lost the large profit the thief offered me, but I had to pay my\r\nfriends two reals apiece before they would stir out of the wine-shop.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one district the Liberals boasted that for years they had never\r\nbought a vote. “Partly,” as my informant ingenuously said, “because we\r\nhave always had a safe majority, but partly also because we prefer to be\r\nhonest. But,” he continued, “we learnt this time that a party of\r\nConservatives intended to interfere with us, so we prepared a party of\r\nthe same kind to receive them. ‘Do not begin to fight,’ said my father,\r\n‘but if they begin, hit hard.’ They did begin, and our leader obeyed\r\norders. He hit the leader of the other side so hard that he knocked out\r\nfour of his front teeth, and that was the end of the fighting in our\r\ndistrict.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll these incidents are said to have occurred in the municipal elections\r\nof 1909. One more is worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nIn a town of some twenty thousand inhabitants, where for many years past\r\nan Ultramontane _Cacique_ has been supreme, that gentleman rose early on\r\nthe polling-day and personally roused the dwellers in the gipsy\r\nquarters--mostly the biggest ruffians in the place--out of their beds.\r\n\r\n“Get up, my sons,” he said, “and go and vote, and there will be a dollar\r\napiece for you when you leave the polling-booth.”\r\n\r\n“They said they would go and vote,” said my informant, “and they got\r\ntheir dollars. But the Republicans came out at the head of the poll, and\r\nthe Liberals next, and the _Cacique_ and his Conservatives were\r\nnowhere.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI happen to be aware that the _Cacique_ in this instance is a man of\r\ngreat wealth and high social position, whose clericalist leanings are\r\nwell known. If, indeed, it be the fact that the working classes have\r\ngained courage to defy men like him, the rising in Cataluña, the Maura\r\nregime of repression, and the campaign led against Spain by\r\nUltramontanes and Socialists abroad will have borne fruit.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one political leader in Spain who stands for purity\r\nof election and is the lifelong foe of the “caciquism” and corruption\r\nwhich paralyse any and every effort at political regeneration. Don\r\nSegismundo Moret has thrice been Premier of Spain. Each time he could\r\nhave retained office had he consented to purchase the favour of the\r\nplace-hunters by giving posts in the Ministry, not to those best\r\nqualified for the work, but to those who could command the largest\r\nfollowing among the “Liberal mercenaries” who, as long as the system of\r\n“caciquism” continues, can make or mar electoral majorities. This he has\r\nnever consented to do. So it has happened that each time that he has\r\nbeen in office he has had to sacrifice place and power rather than\r\npander to an evil system.\r\n\r\nThe story of his late short tenure of the Premiership, and of the\r\nintrigues by which he was ousted is worth telling at some little length,\r\nbecause it throws light on the workings of the political machine, and on\r\nsome of the difficulties with which a reformer has to contend in Spain.\r\n\r\nMoret took office in 1909 against his own better judgment, for he would\r\nhave preferred that the Conservatives should bear the responsibility of\r\ntheir own misdeeds, and solve the many difficulties resulting from\r\nMaura’s “policy of repression.” But the country had been brought to such\r\na pitch of irritation and unrest by the reactionaries that the\r\nsituation was becoming dangerous. The Riff question was attracting the\r\nunfriendly attention of foreign diplomatists; Barcelona was impatient\r\nunder a rigid application of martial law, and the Ferrer incident had\r\ncalled forth a storm of condemnation from all the countries where the\r\nassumption that a prisoner is innocent until he has been proved guilty\r\nis an axiom of criminal law, while the advanced parties in the State\r\nwere getting out of hand and had begun to defy the Government, as,\r\n_e.g._, in the matter of the demonstrations already referred to.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that Moret accepted office he was assailed by a stream\r\nof the most virulent abuse, not only by the Carlist but also by the\r\nConservative and Ultramontane newspapers. He was “the destruction of\r\nSpain,” “the ruin of the nation,” “the arch-priest of irreligion and\r\nimmorality,” and not only was his policy attacked in terms of unmeasured\r\nvilification, but the editors of these papers, which are owned and\r\nsupported by some of the best born and wealthiest men in the country,\r\ndid not hesitate to descend to vulgar personal abuse. His “grey hair,”\r\nfor instance, was a favourite subject of their ridicule, and his\r\n“vacillation,” “infirmity of purpose,” and “inability to keep his party\r\ntogether” were accounted for by jeers at his “senile decay,” his\r\n“failing intellect,” his “body bent double by the weight of years,” and\r\nso forth, while the party led by him are usually spoken of in the\r\nclericalist organs as _canaille_.\r\n\r\nBut on his acceptance of the Premiership the aspect of affairs underwent\r\na complete and immediate change. The political horizon began to clear.\r\nTerms of peace were arrived at in Morocco. Foreign susceptibilities were\r\nsoothed. Cataluña was immediately relieved from the burden of martial\r\nlaw, and the constitutional rights were restored in Barcelona. The\r\ntroops began to return from the war and were received with the greatest\r\nenthusiasm; the trials of persons arrested in connection with the\r\ndisorders in Cataluña, who had been kept in prison on suspicion for four\r\nor five months, were pushed forward, and numbers of them were released\r\nfor want of any evidence against them. Most of the lay schools were\r\nreopened, on showing that nothing seditious had been taught in them. The\r\ndepleted treasury was replenished, and means were found to provide three\r\nmonths’ pay for the Melilla forces, which the outgoing Ministry had left\r\nout of account. A great project of irrigation was vigorously promoted by\r\nMoret’s Minister of Public Works, Gasset, who has devoted practically\r\nthe whole of his political life to this subject, and has produced a\r\nscheme which would convert vast tracts, now arid waste, into fertile\r\nland. And the municipal elections, which took place about six weeks\r\nafter the change of Government, were conducted, so far as time had\r\npermitted any modification of existing conditions, according to law,\r\nwith the result that the Liberal-Monarchists swept the board all over\r\nthe country. The official figures were as follows: Liberal-Monarchists,\r\n2,961; Conservatives, 1,213; Carlists, 185; Republicans, 193;\r\nSocialists, 4. Thus Moret’s party nearly doubled the Conservatives,\r\nCarlists, and Republicans put together. The smallness of the Socialist\r\nvote should be noticed.\r\n\r\nIn any other country it would have been certain that a leader who could\r\nso well and so quickly convert popular indignation into contentment and\r\nhope was in for a long term of office. Not so in Spain.\r\n\r\nDuring his four months of office, from October, 1909, to February, 1910,\r\nMoret tried hard to obtain the decree of dissolution of the Conservative\r\nCortes, in order that the nation might have an opportunity of expressing\r\nits opinion on recent events. At first it almost seemed as if he would\r\nobtain the King’s consent to dissolve. But the place-hunters were\r\nafraid, and the Ultramontanes were more afraid. They played so\r\nsuccessfully into each other’s hands that the decree of dissolution was\r\npostponed day after day, while all his enemies proclaimed the incapacity\r\nof a Premier who was “afraid” to go to the country.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to upset him was a so-called “military demonstration”\r\nin front of the offices of the _Ejercito Español_, a military paper\r\nwhich had been confiscated for publishing an article written by a\r\nCarlist, accusing the Premier of unjust favouritism in the distribution\r\nof rewards for good service in Melilla. The demonstration was described\r\nby the Conservative papers as of “overwhelming importance,” and the\r\nnumber of demonstrators was placed by some of them at two thousand. The\r\ntruth is that it was confined to a few officers well known for their\r\nCarlist leanings, and the rank and file of their regiments stood\r\nresolutely aloof. Moret and his Minister of War, General Luque, retired\r\nthe Captain-General of Madrid and the colonels of the regiments in\r\nquestion for failure to maintain discipline, and ordered the actual\r\nparticipants a couple of months’ arrest--a proceeding which called forth\r\ngeneral applause from all except the reactionaries. The small\r\nsignificance of the affair was made manifest when it came out that\r\nthese arrests did not exceed half a dozen, including the editor (also an\r\nofficer) responsible for the publication of the seditious article.\r\n\r\nThe result of this fiasco was still more to strengthen Moret’s influence\r\nwith the nation, and it became evident that he would sweep the country\r\nshould he obtain the long-deferred decree of dissolution. All the\r\ningenuity of the Church was therefore exercised to secure his fall\r\nbefore this could take place, and the cupidity of a cabal of\r\ndisappointed candidates for place was skilfully used to bring about--the\r\ncatastrophe, I was going to say, but the triumph of morality would be a\r\ntruer expression.\r\n\r\nAt the municipal elections in December, 1909, an endeavour had been made\r\nby Moret to secure something in the direction of freedom of voting for\r\nthe working classes, and the result, as I have shown, was a triumph for\r\nthe Liberal-Monarchists. The Republicans--to their honour be it said,\r\nfor they did not do as well in these elections as they had\r\nexpected--worked harder than ever after this to secure to the electors\r\nthe free exercise of their legal privileges, and Moret accepted their\r\nprogramme, so far as it was designed to help in cleansing the Augean\r\nstable of corruption by limiting the powers of the local _Caciques_.\r\nThis gave an opportunity to those who live by political immorality, and\r\nthe intrigue which followed is typical of Spanish politics.\r\n\r\nIn the December elections Madrid returned a Republican majority to the\r\nTown Council. The Alcalde, Señor Aguilera, an old and staunch ally of\r\nSeñor Moret’s, although himself a Monarchist, ranged himself on the side\r\nof the Republicans by supporting their demand for the limitation of the\r\nAlcalde’s power to appoint and thus control the votes of the very\r\nnumerous municipal employees. It was proposed that the Alcalde, instead\r\nof being, as now, nominated by the Government, should be elected by the\r\nCouncillors, who in their turn have been elected by the popular vote,\r\nand that the posts under the Council should be filled by open\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nMost of the Alcaldes, even in the small towns, enter office poor and\r\nleave rich. But it is admitted even by his opponents that Señor\r\nAguilera, a man with but small private means, who has twice been Alcalde\r\nof Madrid under Moret, has each time gone out of office as poor as when\r\nhe came in.\r\n\r\nA crisis was deliberately provoked by the President of the so-called\r\n“Liberal” election committees of Madrid, Count Romanones, a man who held\r\noffice under Moret in a former Cabinet, and has long been suspected of\r\naspiring to the Premiership of the party to which he belongs. The\r\nelection committees, represented by Count Romanones, although nominally\r\nLiberal, objected to the proposed limitation of the power of the\r\nAlcalde, and finding Moret firm on the point, went so far as to hand him\r\nan ultimatum. Briefly, their terms were, “Leave to the Alcaldes” (often\r\nthe _Caciques_) “throughout Spain the appointment of the municipal\r\nemployees, or we will refuse to act, and leave you without any electoral\r\norganisation at all when the Cortes are dissolved.” It is not denied\r\nthat this resolution was handed to the Premier by Count Romanones a day\r\nor two before his resignation. Meanwhile other opponents took advantage\r\nof Aguilera’s temporary alliance with the Republicans, and represented\r\nthat if a programme of electoral reform supported by that party were\r\ncarried out, the Throne would be endangered by a Republican majority in\r\nthe new Cortes. This danger was imaginary, for there is no doubt that\r\nboth the numerical strength of the Republicans and their hostility to\r\nthe reigning House have always been greatly exaggerated by all the\r\nvarious factions desirous of clogging the wheels of reform.\r\n\r\nSeñor Moret of course declined to compromise with Count Romanones on\r\nany terms, which in a man of his recognised probity was a certainty,\r\ndoubtless counted upon by the “Liberal” cabal and by the Ultramontanes.\r\nHe then once more asked the King for the decree of dissolution, that he\r\nmight place his programme of reform before those whom it most concerned.\r\nExactly what passed at this interview was not divulged, but at its\r\nconclusion he placed his resignation in Don Alfonso’s hands. It was\r\naccepted, and the veteran Liberal-Monarchist, after forty years’ service\r\nto the Throne and the country, found himself dismissed at a moment’s\r\nnotice, through the machinations of the opponents of electoral reform.\r\n\r\nNo plausible reason was given for the dismissal of Moret. It was\r\nreported that “the representative men of the party,” when applied to by\r\nthe King for advice, recommended the appointment of Canalejas, on the\r\nground that Moret had lost their confidence. But it was not stated who\r\nthese representative men were. The _Daily Mail_ gave half a dozen names,\r\nwhich had been telegraphed by its correspondent in Madrid, but that list\r\nwas obviously untrustworthy because Montero Rios figured in it, and it\r\nis well known that the leader of the Radical group sets the unity of the\r\nparty above every other consideration, and has always urged loyalty to\r\nMoret upon Liberals of all shades.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances were calculated to embitter the most even temper;\r\nnevertheless Moret’s first thought was for the welfare of the nation,\r\nwhose whole governmental machinery was thrown out of gear. Some of his\r\nfollowers wanted to make a complete split with Canalejas, and one or two\r\narticles were published in the heat of the moment, expressed in terms\r\ntending to a final division in the Liberal camp. But in his own\r\nutterances for the Press Moret showed himself true to his ideal--the\r\ngood of the country before personal ambition.\r\n\r\n“The most serious feature in this crisis,” he said, “is that both the\r\nevent and its solution were foretold by the reactionary newspapers,\r\nproving the intervention of the reactionary party in the intrigue. They\r\ninterfered because they wish to prevent my conducting the elections in\r\naccordance with my programme of electoral reform.”\r\n\r\nMoret’s assertion that the intrigue which brought about his fall was\r\nengineered by the Ultramontanes received confirmation from the _Correo\r\nCatalan_, a Carlist paper, which committed itself to the following\r\nprophecy:\r\n\r\n“Canalejas will govern without altering the Cabinet until the autumn.\r\nBefore the re-opening of the Cortes there will be ministerial changes.\r\nAnd in order to make compensation to Señor Moret a couple of\r\nunconditional friends of his will enter the Government. In the autumn\r\nMaura will have become tired of acting as guardian to Canalejas, who\r\nwill fall irremediably. The Maurist restoration will be inaugurated next\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\nWorking-class opinion on the situation was quite definite. For a day or\r\ntwo satisfaction was expressed, because Canalejas was reputed to be\r\ndevoted to the interests of the people. But no sooner was suspicion\r\naroused that his elevation to the Premiership had been engineered by the\r\nUltramontanes than the poor were up in arms: the mere suggestion that\r\nthe Jesuits were at work being sufficient to revive all the irritation\r\nand anxiety that Moret had succeeded in allaying.\r\n\r\n“Canalejas talks a great deal, and we have long looked upon him as our\r\nfriend,” a journeyman mason remarked to me. “But here we are again with\r\neverything in a state of confusion, and work in every direction waiting\r\nwhile our employers are busy with their politics. We shall get nothing\r\ndone now till things have quieted down, so I don’t see what advantage it\r\nis to us to have Canalejas in power.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nGENERAL MARINA.      SEÑOR CANALEJAS.\r\n\r\nCommander-in-Chief at Melilla.      Leader of the Liberal Democrats.\r\n\r\n[To face page 244.]\r\n\r\n“If it is true that Canalejas is in league with the Jesuits to bring\r\nMaura back, there will be trouble,” said another man. “We will not have\r\nMaura ruining the country again just when it was beginning to pick up. I\r\nwould rather shoot him myself. The poor can’t live under Maura, so I\r\nshould lose nothing by killing him, even if I paid for it with my life.”\r\n\r\nA woman burst out crying when she heard her husband talking about Maura.\r\n\r\n“Why does the good God let that man live?” she sobbed. “If it is true\r\nthat he is coming into power again, all our sons will be sent to Melilla\r\nto be killed. And we have been so contented because we thought we had\r\ngot rid of him!”\r\n\r\nThe hope of the Ultramontanes was that the downfall of Moret would bring\r\nabout a final and irremediable split in the Liberal party, which would\r\nfacilitate the overthrow of Canalejas when the time came. And at first\r\nit seemed probable that this hope would be realised, for practically the\r\nwhole of Moret’s Cabinet resigned with him, and refused to take office\r\nunder Canalejas, while Canalejas himself at first acted as though he\r\ndesired a permanent breach, by claiming that his appointment as Premier\r\nnecessarily carried with it the leadership of the party--a proposition\r\nto which the party was by no means disposed to agree. But in time better\r\ncounsels prevailed, and an interview between the Premier and his\r\npredecessor has lately been reported in the Press, in the course of\r\nwhich Canalejas frankly admitted the obligations of the party to Moret\r\nand the need that exists for his co-operation and advice--which Moret\r\nfor his part professed himself quite ready to give, as indeed he had\r\ndone ever since his resignation. So that it looks as though the danger\r\nof a breach had been avoided, at any rate for the present.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the Government of Spain can be carried on for an\r\nindefinite time without the sessions of the Cortes. The Cortes adjourned\r\nfor the summer recess in June, 1909, before the troubles began in\r\nBarcelona, and never met again. Throughout his tenure of office Moret\r\ntried without success to obtain the Royal decree for a dissolution.\r\nCanalejas was in office two months before he could get the decree\r\nsigned, but at length, in April, 1910, it was announced that the General\r\nElection would definitely be held in May. The outgoing Cortes has a\r\nConservative majority: what the next will be no man can say, although,\r\nhaving regard to the fact that a Liberal Ministry is in power, the\r\npresumption is that a Liberal majority will be returned. There is,\r\nhowever, no shadow of doubt that if the elections were conducted fairly\r\nand freely and the people could vote in accordance with their\r\nconvictions, a Cortes would be returned with an overwhelming majority in\r\nfavour of the Constitutional Monarchy, reform of abuses, and the\r\ndestruction of the political influence and privileges of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the whole of the Conservative party shares\r\nthe Carlist and Ultramontane views of the majority. The old school of\r\nConservatives, led by Canovas, supported the Constitutional Monarchy as\r\nstrongly as do the Liberals, and even now a contingent of strong\r\nconstitutional Conservatives exists, although it is not easy to detect\r\ntheir influence on the general policy of the party with which they act.\r\nTheir existence, however, was proved in October, 1909, when some of the\r\nleading men of Señor Maura’s party withdrew their adhesion to his\r\nleadership upon his declaration of “implacable hostility” towards the\r\nwhole of the Liberal party. They saw, as did every one else, that the\r\nreactionary policy of the Ultramontane Premier was imperilling the\r\nexistence of the Constitutional Monarchy.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the disinterestedness of men who thus cut themselves off\r\nfrom the acknowledged leader of their party, whether in office or in\r\nopposition, the unwritten law of an alternate share of the spoils must\r\nbe borne in mind. Thus a politician who deliberately deserts his party,\r\nfrom whatever motive, loses all chances of a salaried appointment when\r\nthat party again has power to confer these political plums.\r\n\r\nI make no apology for putting the facts thus plainly. They are spoken of\r\nwith cynical frankness by all Spaniards, and it is considered a matter\r\nof course that any statesman who refuses to sell his favours to the\r\nhighest bidder will be removed from place at the earliest opportunity by\r\nthe intrigues of the many who live by political corruption.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that once the rule of alternating office by mutual\r\narrangement be broken, the end of the whole system of gerrymandering the\r\nelections would be brought within sight, for any Government which\r\nenjoyed the confidence of the nation would remain in office year after\r\nyear, once the people were permitted to make their voice heard in the\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nSeñor Maura, or those who inspired him, of course foresaw this after the\r\nfall of his Cabinet in October, 1909, and his address to his party on\r\nthat occasion marks an epoch in the history of political reform in\r\nSpain, although perhaps not precisely on the lines he intended.\r\n\r\nHis party, he said, must fight without truce against the Liberals,\r\n“ex-Ministers and ex-Presidents of Council who reach office in\r\ncollaboration with anarchists.” Nor must his own party stand alone, he\r\nsaid, for it would be necessary to seek the alliance of all, no matter\r\nhow different their political ideals, who desired to check the advance\r\nof revolution. From that moment all relations between Liberals and\r\nConservatives must cease. Any other course would be treachery, for only\r\nthus could the nation be saved from the reproach and the ruin with which\r\nit was threatened.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of Señor Maura, the party against which he thus\r\nproclaimed war to the knife includes every shade of Liberalism in Spain,\r\nfrom the most loyal Monarchists down to the rioters in Cataluña, while\r\nhis right-hand man, Señor La Cierva, Minister of the Interior in the\r\nUltramontane Cabinet, went so far as to accuse Señor Moret of being at\r\n“one end of a chain which linked Liberals, Radicals, Democrats,\r\nRepublicans, and Socialists with the persons who fired the Religious\r\nHouses in Barcelona and scattered anarchy broadcast by encouraging the\r\nabominable sedition taught in the lay schools.”\r\n\r\nWhen Señor Maura declared that all relations between the two parties\r\nmust cease, he no doubt expected that the party to obtain power and\r\nkeep it would be his own. But the dissatisfaction caused in his own\r\nparty by his violent speech showed that they did not all share his\r\nviews, and for a time it looked as though there might be a split in the\r\ncamp. The Clericalists foresaw days of leanness, for if Maura’s\r\ncalculations went wrong and Moret was able to carry out his project of\r\nelectoral reform, their occupation and their livelihood would be gone.\r\nHow the dissentients were brought into line we need not inquire. But the\r\noccasion forced one of the most statesmanlike of the Conservatives to\r\nmake a public confession of his faith, and it then became manifest that\r\nin Señor Sanchez Toca, ex-Minister and ex-Alcalde of Madrid, the spirit\r\nof Canovas and Silvela still survives, although he with one or two more\r\nseem to stand almost alone among their party against the tide of\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nAfter three years of loyal support, said Sanchez Toca, in an interview\r\nwith the representative of the Conservative _Correspondencia de\r\nEspaña_--the organ of all that is left of the old Conservative\r\npolicy--Señor Maura should have consulted his Cabinet before taking a\r\nresolution which completely alters the normal course of national\r\npolitics. “I stood aghast,” said he, “at the thought of the incalculable\r\nresults that must spring from those furious voices convoking the whole\r\nChristian world to a holy war against Ministers holding office under the\r\nCrown, to whom even the name of Liberals was denied, and shouting with\r\nanathemas that he was no true Conservative who held other relations than\r\nthose of implacable hostility with men appointed to office by the King.”\r\nAnd he concluded by pointing out that the true Conservative faith\r\nirresistibly impels those who hold it towards conciliation instead of\r\nprovocation, and that if this reason for its existence failed, the\r\nConservative party must disappear.\r\n\r\nWhether Sanchez Toca could have formed a party under his own leadership\r\non the old Conservative lines it is not possible to guess; for after\r\nmaking the protest of which the above is a brief abstract, he left\r\nMadrid, and it was announced that he intended to make a protracted\r\nsojourn abroad, so that no one was able to accuse him of self-seeking in\r\nhis secession from the Ultramontane party. The dignity of his position,\r\nas compared with that taken up by the supporters of the “implacable\r\nhostility” which has become a byword among the scoffers, needs no\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at perhaps undue length upon his part in the affair,\r\nbecause it is assumed abroad that Señor Maura represents an united\r\nConservative party, which, as the above declaration proves, is by no\r\nmeans the case.\r\n\r\nHow completely this was misunderstood by many of the English journalists\r\nwho wrote about Spain in 1909 was shown by their comments upon the\r\nstrength displayed by Maura in holding the whole “Conservative” forces\r\ntogether, and their complete misapprehension of the real causes of the\r\ndissensions which have always prevailed in the Liberal camp.\r\n\r\nThe modern Conservatives and the modern Liberals are so nearly alike in\r\ntheir policy as regards the Crown and the Constitution, that they might\r\nalmost be classed as one party, under the general name of Monarchists.\r\nIn the matter of electoral reform there seems hardly anything to choose\r\nbetween them, although on the question of the Religious Orders Moret’s\r\nviews are perhaps rather more advanced than those of Sanchez Toca, Dato,\r\nor Gonzalez Besada, the three most prominent Conservative-Monarchists of\r\nto-day. Unfortunately, the popular distrust of the very name of\r\nConservative is so great that it would be difficult for any one thus\r\nlabelled to convince the people that he meant fairly by them. Even\r\nMoret’s policy of conciliation is taken by the masses to indicate fear\r\nof the Jesuits, rather than as a calculated avoidance of action which\r\nmight lead to disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe constant commendation given by the Conservative and even by the\r\nLiberal Press of England to the strength and unity of the “Conservative”\r\nparty under Señor Maura, and their adverse comments on the dissensions\r\nin the Liberal camp, have materially added to the difficulties, already\r\nserious enough, which block the path of Moret and those of his creed,\r\nand have strengthened the party of clerical reaction and absolutism.\r\n\r\nThe _Heraldo_, in an article on the benefits to the nation to be\r\nexpected from Moret’s support of Canalejas’ Government, spoke as follows\r\nof the influence of England upon Spanish affairs:\r\n\r\n“It now appears probable that the democratic Government will be\r\nconsolidated by the disappearance of the danger to which we have\r\nreferred [the split with Moret’s party]. If this proves the case, all\r\nEurope will recognise with satisfaction how the personal convictions of\r\nthe monarch, strengthened perhaps by the healthy influence of his\r\nillustrious connections by marriage, are leading Spain along the paths\r\nof prosperity and gradually relieving us of the nightmare of reaction\r\nwhich has weighed so heavily upon our nation during the minority of Don\r\nAlfonso and the early years of his manhood.”\r\n\r\nCenturies of government by the rich for the rich, and by the Church for\r\nthe Church, have contributed to make reform exceedingly difficult, but\r\nat length the issues between political morality and the maintenance of\r\nthe old abuses have been clearly set before the nation, in the struggle\r\nwhich ended with the dismissal of Señor Moret. He determined to have the\r\ncountry freed from the tyranny of the _Cacique_. His opponents desired\r\nto maintain the system. That was the whole point at issue.\r\n\r\nAt the moment it seemed as if those interested in the maintenance of a\r\ncorrupt system had won a signal victory, and the men who are working for\r\nthe moralising of political life would have been more than human had\r\nthey spoken no word of the bitterness they felt at seeing, as it seemed,\r\ntheir work undone and their hopes frustrated. But there are apparent\r\ndefeats which mark a stage on the road to final victory, and such a\r\nstage was marked, for the people of Spain, by the fall of Moret in\r\nFebruary, 1910.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other main body of political opinion, the Liberal party,\r\nwith its offshoot, the Republicans, it is worth noting that many of\r\nthese, including several of their most prominent and influential\r\nleaders, although professing republican opinions, are in reality\r\nstaunch upholders of the constitutional Monarchy, their republicanism\r\nbeing more in the nature of a political counsel of perfection than a\r\npolicy that they are actively forwarding. Thus Montero Rios, the leader\r\nof the Radical wing of the Liberals, who, if not avowedly a Republican,\r\nis closely allied to that party, recently said, _à propos_ of the split\r\nin the Liberal camp which seemed imminent after the resignation of\r\nMoret, “I have always urged that our group should submit to the\r\nleadership of Moret, because he alone can hold the party together.”\r\nMelquiades Alvarez, one of the acknowledged leaders of the Republicans,\r\nmade in October, 1909, an important speech in which he offered “a final\r\ntruce” with the Monarchy, and Republican support to a programme of\r\nliberty of worship, restriction of the power of the Religious Orders,\r\nneutral schools, and social reform. “With the adoption of this programme\r\npermanent stability would be afforded to the Throne on the model of the\r\nEnglish dynasty--a crowned Republic.” And Soriano, another prominent man\r\nin that party, said about the same time “The Republican revolution\r\nshould be spiritual, not material. _We do not desire to overthrow the\r\nMonarchy_, but to implant education and progress” (italics mine). The\r\nterm “Republican,” as used by the men of this school of thought, seems\r\nto connote a social and political Utopia rather than a particular form\r\nof government, and “republican” principles are quite compatible with an\r\nundeviating support of the Constitutional Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThese “idealist” Republicans would not thus group their party with the\r\nsupporters of the Monarchy if they believed that the existence of the\r\nThrone were prejudicial to the nation. Nor would the Liberal-Monarchists\r\naccept without protest such an association with themselves, did they\r\nbelieve that these men were working to overthrow the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that all Spanish politicians who have the good of their\r\ncountry at heart recognise, even though they may disapprove, the\r\ntraditional respect for the kingly office which is implanted in the mind\r\nof most peoples who have lived from childhood under the Monarchical\r\nsystem. In Spain, where the King who united Castile with Leon and\r\nexpelled the Moslems from nearly the whole of the South is venerated as\r\na saint, the tradition exists more strongly and has greater weight in\r\ndetermining the action of the masses at any given moment than in any\r\nother country except perhaps Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET HAWKER DESCRIBING BATTLE SCENES TO AN ILLITERATE\r\nAUDIENCE.\r\n\r\n[To face page 263.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many evils that afflict Spain, one of the gravest, for it lies at\r\nthe root of most of the others, is the deplorably backward state of\r\neducation. It is commonly said that 75 per cent. of the population\r\ncannot read or write. This figure may or may not be exaggerated, but it\r\nis certainly the exception to find a member of the working classes who\r\ncan do either. And this ignorance is not confined to the working\r\nclasses, but extends, in a relative degree, throughout all social ranks.\r\nPeople of good position, presumably educated, frequently cannot write\r\nand spell their own language correctly. I have even been told as a fact\r\nthat there are, or were until quite recently, grandees of Spain who\r\ncould not sign their names. And ignorance of the commonest facts of\r\ngeography and history is astonishingly prevalent even in the middle\r\nclasses. It would not in the least surprise any one who knows Spanish\r\nsociety to be asked whether Germany lies to the south of Switzerland,\r\nor if Berlin is the capital of London. Even in the universities things\r\nare no better. The course of study in any subject consists in the\r\nscholar getting up a textbook written _ad hoc_ by the professor of that\r\nsubject, in which alone he is examined for his certificate or diploma,\r\nand outside of which he is not expected to travel. Indeed, in some of\r\nthe universities the students are actively discouraged from reading\r\nanything except the prescribed textbook of the subject they are\r\nstudying, and the natural consequence is that a young man who has passed\r\nthrough the University with credit may be, and often is in fact, quite\r\nilliterate.\r\n\r\nThe administrative educational system in Spain is as follows:\r\n\r\nAt the head is the Minister of Public Instruction, assisted by a\r\nconsultative Council, which includes the Rectors of the universities.\r\nCertain of the functions of the Minister are delegated to the\r\nsub-secretary, who is the second authority in the department.\r\n\r\nThe local administration is complicated. The whole country is divided\r\ninto ten university districts, at the head of each of which is the\r\nRector of the university. He, _inter alia_, exercises a general\r\nsupervision over all the schools in his district, appoints teachers\r\nwhose salary is below 1,000 pesetas per annum, and proposes to the\r\nMinister of Education the appointment of those of higher grade or\r\nsalary. He is assisted by a consultative Council. The teachers are\r\nappointed after some sort of competitive examination.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Governor of each province is responsible for the fulfilment of\r\nall the obligations imposed by the law, but has no voice in the internal\r\nmanagement, teaching, &c., of the schools and colleges. He, too, is\r\nassisted by a provincial consultative Council. Lastly, in the\r\nmunicipality, the Alcalde, the President of the _Ayuntamiento_, has the\r\nsame functions in his district as those of the Civil Governor in the\r\nprovince.[23] The Alcalde also has his local consultative committee,\r\nwhose functions are not unlike those of school managers in England.\r\n\r\nThe inspection of all schools except the elementary is the duty of the\r\nRector of the university. The inspection of elementary schools is\r\ncommitted to an Inspector-General, under the immediate orders of the\r\nsub-Secretary of State, and forty-nine inspectors, one for each\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nElementary education in Spain has been compulsory since 1857, and free,\r\nsince 1901, to children whose parents “are unable to pay.” The\r\ncompulsory school age is from 6 to 12. The provision of schools and the\r\nupkeep of the buildings is the duty of the _Ayuntamiento_, and a small\r\nsum is set aside in the annual Budget of the kingdom for grants in aid\r\nto poor districts.\r\n\r\nThe system under which the teachers are paid is peculiar. The locality\r\nfinds the money and hands it to the Ministry of Education, which pays\r\nthe salaries. The reason for this arrangement is characteristic. It was\r\nmade because of the irregularities in the payment of the teachers which\r\nfrequently occurred when the local authority administered the funds. The\r\nsalaries of the teachers in the Elementary schools are from 500 to 3,000\r\npesetas--say £20 to £120 a year, with a house, and they are entitled\r\nafter twenty years’ service or upwards, to a pension of from 50 to 80\r\nper cent. of their salary. They also have a right to the fees of\r\n“children who can pay them.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that this system of overlapping authorities and\r\ndivided responsibility must necessarily lead to waste of time and\r\ngeneral inefficiency, even assuming that every one concerned is\r\ngenuinely anxious to do his duty and to work for the good of education,\r\nan assumption which it would be very rash to make.\r\n\r\nThe teachers in the Government schools have to hold a Government\r\ncertificate, which is obtained after a two years’ course in a normal\r\nschool. In the higher-grade schools a superior certificate is required,\r\ninvolving an additional two years’ training. Private schools are\r\nreckoned as part of the school supply, in a proportion to the total\r\nwhich varies with the population of the school district. The school\r\nsupply is calculated, not on the basis of school places but of teachers;\r\nroughly speaking, one master and one mistress are allowed to each\r\nthousand of population. The total number of qualified teachers of both\r\nsexes is eventually to be brought up to 30,000. The private schools have\r\nto satisfy the inspector as to sanitary requirements only: no control\r\nseems to be exercised over the instruction, nor is any certificate of\r\ncompetence demanded of the teacher.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the elementary schools, the law provides for the\r\nestablishment of infant and night schools, schools for the deaf and\r\ndumb, and all the machinery of a complete and comprehensive system of\r\nsecondary and higher education.\r\n\r\nSo much for the theory: the practice is another matter.\r\n\r\nIn the universities all the elements of university education are\r\nlacking. The professors in many cases are ignorant and incompetent, and\r\nthose who are properly qualified for their work--and some of them are\r\nmen of scholastic and scientific attainments of no mean order, often\r\nacquired abroad--are isolated, working in unsympathetic and even hostile\r\nsurroundings, and their knowledge is almost useless in the lecture-room,\r\nowing to the fact that the students are absolutely destitute of the\r\ngrounding necessary in order to benefit by proper teaching. When by\r\nchance a group of professors with real knowledge and enthusiasm happens\r\nto be formed in an university, the results are surprising. This has\r\noccurred at Oviedo, where, thanks to the existence of such a teaching\r\nstaff, an educational atmosphere was formed, the students were educated\r\nand not merely crammed with a few useless facts, and extension lectures\r\nwere established with extraordinary success, especially among the\r\nworking classes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a body of competent professors, the universities, if they\r\nare to fulfil their function, need (_a_) a certain amount of\r\nautonomy--at present they are merely bureaus for conducting\r\nexaminations and issuing diplomas; (_b_) reorganisation of studies, with\r\nsome liberty of choice to the student; (_c_) reform of the examination\r\nsystem in the direction of substituting for the present examination by\r\nsubjects either a certificate based on attendance and general\r\nproficiency or a final examination on leaving; (_d_) in scientific\r\nsubjects, a good deal more practical work; and in all branches of study\r\nthe abolition of the textbook, the committing of which to memory is now\r\nthe sole demand made on the candidate for examination.\r\n\r\nA professor at one of the universities has summed up to me the present\r\nstate of these centres of learning in the following words:\r\n\r\n“There is an absolute lack of any educational spirit, of any contact\r\nbetween teachers and pupils, of any feeling of solidarity among the\r\nstudents, of any organisation of games, excursions, &c., of any artistic\r\nrefinement, and of any organised effort to raise the moral standard,\r\nto-day perhaps the most degraded in the world.”\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the administration of the elementary schools, the part\r\nof the educational system which more directly and immediately affects\r\nthe working classes, we find the same general state of inefficiency and\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\nA volume of school statistics was officially issued not long ago, of\r\nwhich a useful summary was published in the _Heraldo de Madrid_ in\r\nNovember, 1909.\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that while four provinces have the full complement\r\nof Elementary schools required by the law, the supply in all the\r\nremaining 45 is deficient, the shortage per province being from 772\r\nschools downwards, and the total deficiency amounting to 9,505 schools.\r\nThe total increase of school supply between 1870 and 1908 is 2,150\r\nschools, or an average of about 56 schools per year. At this rate it\r\nwould take over 150 years to catch up even to the school provision\r\nrequired by the school law of 1857, without allowing for any increase of\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nBut in another way, about two-thirds of the school districts of Spain,\r\nor some thirty thousand towns and villages, have no Government school.\r\nIn Madrid about half the schools required by law are wanting. Barcelona\r\nhas a somewhat similar deficiency. And be it remembered that the school\r\nsupply is calculated in accordance with the law of 1857, the\r\nrequirements of which are far below those which obtain in any other\r\ncountry in Europe, so that even in the very few districts where there is\r\nnominally sufficient school accommodation there is actually a serious\r\ndeficiency according to modern standards of what is necessary. The\r\nconsequence, as the _Heraldo_ observes, is that some 12,000,000 of the\r\npopulation do not know their letters.\r\n\r\nBut the towns where there is a school are not really much better off,\r\neducationally, than those that have none. Save in very exceptional\r\ncases, no attempt is made to enforce school attendance, and though some\r\nof the parents send their children to school, the careless and\r\nindifferent do not. The Alcalde, whose business it is to see that the\r\nlaw is carried out, probably is--except in the larger towns--entirely\r\nuneducated himself, and is not going to stir up possible ill-feeling by\r\nenforcing a law which does not benefit him personally, and of which he\r\ndoes not see the necessity. The Civil Governor, who is over the Alcalde,\r\nand whose duty it is to see that the education laws are carried out,\r\nprobably is equally indifferent, and in any case has not the time to\r\nsupervise all the Alcaldes of the scores of towns and villages in his\r\nprovince. The schoolmaster naturally does not trouble himself; his\r\nsalary does not depend on the number of his pupils, but on the\r\npopulation of the school district. And, lastly, any attempt to enforce\r\nthe attendance required by law, were it made, must necessarily fail,\r\nsimply for lack of school accommodation, for already most if not all of\r\nthe elementary schools have many more children on the register than\r\nthere is room for. Thus school attendance, although nominally\r\ncompulsory, is in fact purely voluntary, with the usual results.\r\n\r\nThe supply of school material is the duty of the Central Government, as\r\nalready stated. This duty the Government delegates, not to the local\r\nauthority, but to the schoolmaster, who receives, in addition to his\r\nsalary, an allowance to scale for providing books, &c. The natural\r\nresult is that he looks on this allowance as an augmentation of salary,\r\nand reduces the supply of books to the barest minimum, or to zero. It is\r\nnot to be expected that the schools should be liberally or even decently\r\nsupplied with these necessaries when every penny that can be saved on\r\nthem is so much clear profit to the teacher. The consequence--seeing\r\nthat books cannot be altogether dispensed with--is that the children\r\nhave to pay for them, and the intention of the law, that schooling\r\nshould be free to the poor, is frustrated.\r\n\r\nThe working classes, who, as has been said, honestly desire that their\r\nchildren may receive some rudiments of education, do not as a rule like\r\nthe Government schools, because, they say, nothing is taught in them. It\r\nis not at all uncommon for the teacher to absent himself altogether\r\nfrom school during school hours. He may or may not set the children some\r\nlesson--for instance, a passage to repeat over and over again--and he\r\nmay or may not lock the door after him when he goes away, but very often\r\nthe children are left entirely alone during the hours when the school is\r\nopen and they are supposed to be receiving instruction. Parents say, and\r\nno doubt with truth, that the moral consequences of this lack of\r\nsupervision are exceedingly bad, and that a great deal of harm is done\r\nto the majority by uncontrolled association with a few demoralised\r\nchildren. A working man in a small provincial town complained to me that\r\na whole school had been corrupted by the evil influence of one boy older\r\nthan the rest.\r\n\r\nIt will naturally be asked why such a state of things is tolerated. The\r\nanswer is easy. It is the duty of the Alcalde to see that the\r\nschoolmaster does his work and does not absent himself without leave.\r\nBut the Alcalde may be a friend or relative of the schoolmaster, or may\r\nhave other reasons for not worrying him by pedantically insisting that\r\nhe do his duty. Besides which, it is quite probable that the\r\nschoolmaster is not being paid. His salary may not have been sent to the\r\n_Ayuntamiento_, or if sent may not have reached him. According to the\r\narticle in the _Heraldo_ above referred to, the _Ayuntamientos_ are now\r\nin debt to the school teachers for arrears of salary amounting to\r\n7,000,000 pesetas--say £280,000. Therefore the negligent schoolmaster is\r\nnot unlikely to have a conclusive answer to any remonstrance that the\r\nAlcalde might be inclined to make: “Pay me my wages and I’ll do my\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\nThe parents dare not complain. The Alcalde or the teacher, or both of\r\nthem, would make things unpleasant for the audacious parent who hinted\r\nthat either of them was not doing all he should, and there is further\r\nthe tradition of hopeless submission to misrule of all kinds, from long\r\nexperience of the uselessness and danger of protesting, which in itself\r\nmakes the working man reluctant to take any steps against those in\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nAs far as can be gathered, the working classes seem on the whole to\r\nprefer the private schools, in spite of the fee charged, on the ground\r\nthat in these schools the children are under some sort of supervision\r\nand do learn something, if only, a little. But the fee, even where quite\r\nlow, is a serious obstacle to a labourer with a large family, who is\r\nonly earning some ten or twelve pesetas a week, and, as has been already\r\nsaid, it often happens that only one child can be sent, who in the\r\nevenings passes on what he has learnt to the rest of the family. But in\r\nthese schools it is the custom for the children to bring presents to the\r\nmaster on certain occasions, and it is said that a child who does not\r\nbring his present is neglected. “Only the children of those who have\r\nmoney get any teaching,” the parents say.\r\n\r\nIn many towns most of the private schools are kept by nuns. These\r\nschools, generally speaking, have not a good name. It is said that the\r\nchildren who attend them are taught nothing but catechism and\r\nneedlework, and that the punishments given are often cruel and sometimes\r\ndisgusting. There was a great scandal lately in a town in the south, on\r\naccount of a punishment of a nature impossible to describe, inflicted on\r\na little girl in one of these schools. The father took steps to bring an\r\naction against the convent in question, but the Civil Governor\r\ninterfered, and compensation was paid in order to have the matter hushed\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThere are schools, both public and private, where a better state of\r\nthings prevails, where the master is more or less of an enthusiast, and\r\nwhere in consequence the children get decent elementary teaching;\r\nindeed, in one village I was told that “the master of the Government\r\nschool taught very well, when he was sober.” Nevertheless it is a fact\r\nthat most of those few of the working classes who can read and write do\r\nso badly; indeed, to decipher a letter, say from a domestic servant, or\r\na workman or small tradesman, is a labour of great difficulty, not only\r\nowing to the bad writing, but to the extraordinary spelling, although\r\nSpanish is the easiest of languages to spell correctly.\r\n\r\nStill, in spite of all the obstacles created by administrative\r\nincompetence, neglect, and corruption, some progress is being\r\nmade--enough at least to prove that the people would take immediate\r\nadvantage of a decently efficient school system. If any members of a\r\nfamily can read, it is usually the children. I have often seen little\r\ngroups of older people seated round some child who reads the paper to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe desire of the working classes for education has brought about a\r\nremarkable change in their attitude towards the conscription. This\r\nchange is the growth of recent years, and is the result of personal\r\nefforts on the part of certain distinguished officers. Their feeling in\r\nthe matter may be summed up in the words of Colonel Ibañez Marin, who\r\nmet his death in the early days of the Melilla War: “My ambition is that\r\nno conscript shall return to his home, after serving his first three\r\nyears, without being able at least to read and write.”\r\n\r\nI am continually asked about the education of the working classes in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n“They say that in your country every one is taught to read. Is it\r\npossible that that is true? But you have a different kind of Government\r\nfrom ours. Over there it seems that they attend to the interests of the\r\npoor. Here you must be able to pay if you wish to learn anything.\r\n\r\n“England must do something for us now that our King has married your\r\nKing’s daughter. If things here were conducted as they are over there,\r\nSpain would be the happiest country in the world. But England will take\r\nour part in everything now, so matters will improve.”\r\n\r\nIf the connection between King Edward and the Queen of Spain is\r\nexplained, and it is observed that one nation cannot interfere with the\r\ninternal affairs of another on the sole ground of relationship between\r\ntheir respective rulers, the speaker will reply:\r\n\r\n“You say that because Governments talk in that way, but we know better.\r\nAre not kings human beings like ourselves? And if the Spanish Government\r\nknows that Don Alfonso asks the King of England for advice, will they\r\nnot have to respect the advice he gives? It is not possible that England\r\nshould take no interest in our affairs when our Queen is your King’s\r\nniece.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps one ought to explain that the only influence that England could\r\nexert in their favour is that of public opinion, and that England is too\r\nbusy with her own affairs to have time to form an opinion about those of\r\nSpain, far less to express it in a convincing manner. But it would be\r\ncruel to deprive these people of the gleam of hope which has come to\r\nthem through the King’s marriage, so perhaps I say, “In the meantime\r\nhere are a few little reals for teaching,” and get the reply: “May God\r\nrepay you! My second boy can go to the night school for a month for\r\nseven reals.”\r\n\r\nA movement which has in it great promise for the future was started a\r\nfew years ago by certain able young university professors, who fully\r\nrealise how much of the backwardness of their country is due to lack of\r\neducation, with its resultant narrowness of mind and outlook, and\r\nignorance of the modes of life and thought of other nations.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea of this movement, as described to me by its\r\noriginator, is to create an organic body, independent of political\r\nchanges, which shall endeavour little by little to promote contact\r\nbetween the teachers of all grades in Spain and their foreign\r\ncolleagues, and to form within the country small nuclei of workers to\r\ndiffuse in Spain the ideas brought from abroad, and to create an\r\natmosphere of sympathy and enthusiasm, without which scientific work\r\ncannot flourish. On these lines two Committees were formed by Royal\r\nDecree in January, 1907. One of these was charged with reforms in\r\nelementary teaching, to be carried out by the establishment of classes\r\nfor teachers, by school inspection on modern lines, by sending selected\r\nteachers abroad (the Government gives a grant for this purpose, the\r\nadministration of which was entrusted to the committee) and by grouping\r\nand grading the schools, and encouraging and supervising holiday resorts\r\nfor teachers, school games, &c.--the whole of the reforms to be\r\nintroduced gradually, as circumstances might permit. To the other body\r\nthen created, a “Committee for the development of studies and scientific\r\nresearch,” was entrusted the gradual formation of a staff of competent\r\nteachers and professors for higher education generally and for\r\nscientific studies.\r\n\r\nBut the work of these Committees, which, if steadily pursued, offers the\r\nbest hope for the intellectual regeneration of Spain, was paralysed in\r\nthe first year by Government interference. Between the formation of the\r\nCommittees and the issue of their first Annual Report a change of\r\nGovernment took place, and the Ministry of Señor Maura, true to the\r\ntraditions of Clericalism, did their best to bring all effective work to\r\nan end. They suppressed altogether the Committee charged with reforms in\r\nelementary education, and set up in its place a mere official bureau,\r\npowerless and useless. And though they did not actually abolish the\r\nCommittee for Higher Education, they succeeded in putting an end to all\r\neffective work, by overriding its statutory constitution and curtailing\r\nits freedom of action, by stopping supplies, and by delaying or refusing\r\nthe necessary official consent to measures proposed by the Committee.\r\nFor instance, whereas the Committee had made arrangements with the\r\nFrench Ministry of Public Instruction for the disposal of the teachers\r\nwho held grants for study abroad, the Government refused to recognise\r\nthese arrangements unless they were made officially through the\r\nambassadors, with the result that in the year 1908 none of these\r\nteachers were sent abroad. In the Budget for that year the sum set aside\r\nfor foreign study was reduced by 110,000 pesetas (about £4,400),\r\nalthough in the previous year a quite exceptional number of applicants\r\nfor these grants had come forward. These instances are sufficient to\r\nshow the attitude of the Clericalists towards education, but the whole\r\nReport of the Committee shows how at every turn their work was checked\r\nand hampered after Señor Maura took office. With the return of a Liberal\r\nMinistry to power it is hoped that the work will be once more\r\neffectively taken up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the above chapter was written a Report on the present condition of\r\neducation, addressed to the Cortes, has been prepared by the Minister of\r\nEducation, and summarised in the Spanish Press. The following quotations\r\nfrom this summary throw a lurid light on the actual state of affairs.\r\n\r\n“More than 10,000 schools are on hired premises, and many of these are\r\nabsolutely destitute of hygienic conditions. There are schools mixed up\r\nwith hospitals, with cemeteries, with slaughterhouses, with stables. One\r\nschool forms the entrance to a cemetery, and the corpses are placed on\r\nthe master’s table while the last responses are being said. There is a\r\nschool into which the children cannot enter until the animals have been\r\ntaken out and sent to pasture. Some are so small that as soon as the\r\nwarm weather begins the boys faint for want of air and ventilation. One\r\nschool is a manure-heap in process of fermentation, (_sic_) and one of\r\nthe local authorities has said that in this way the children are warmer\r\nin the winter. One school in Cataluña adjoins the prison. Another, in\r\nAndalusia, is turned into an enclosure for the bulls when there is a\r\nbullfight in the town.\r\n\r\n“The school premises are bad, but most of the Town Councils do not pay\r\nthe rent, for which reason the proprietors refuse to let their houses.\r\nNinety per cent. of the buildings in which the schools are held are the\r\nworst dwellings in the town.\r\n\r\n“In Lucena the salary of a mistress is held back because she guaranteed\r\nthe school rent. The Municipality did not pay it, the school was going\r\nto be evicted and the teaching to be interrupted, and that mistress, in\r\norder to prevent this, pledged her miserable pay.”\r\n\r\nComment is needless: the facts, vouched for by the Minister of\r\nEducation, speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAXATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAFFRON PICKERS SORTING THEIR CROP.\r\n\r\nTo face page 285.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTAXATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the sources of the national revenue of Spain there are several\r\nwhich more especially affect the poorer portion of the community, or, by\r\nhampering trade and manufactures, put obstacles in the way of the\r\nnational prosperity. Among these may be especially mentioned the Customs\r\nduties, the tax on trades, business, and professions (_contribucion\r\nindustrial_) the _octroi_, or _consumo_, the creation and sale of\r\nmonopolies, and the national lottery. The total taxation of the country\r\nis absolutely crushing, and makes Spain one of the dearest places of\r\nresidence in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Customs are excessively high, especially for a country that has\r\ncomparatively few manufactures of its own to protect. To take a few\r\ninstances at random from the Tariff: Straw hats pay about 20 pesetas per\r\nkilogramme; preserves, 3 pesetas per kilogramme; typewriters, 8 pesetas\r\nper kilogramme; timber in boards, 6 pesetas per cubic metre; materials\r\nof silk and velvet, from 30 pesetas per kilogramme; woollen materials,\r\nfrom 13 pesetas per kilogramme; drugs at various rates from 36 pesetas\r\nper kilogramme downwards, and so forth. The consequence is seen in the\r\nprices charged in the shops for ordinary commodities. Thus Danish tinned\r\nbutter costs pesetas 2.75 per lb.; tapioca, 1 peseta per packet of about\r\n¼ lb.; coffee, pesetas 2.50 to 3 per lb.; Keiller’s marmalade, 3 to 4\r\npesetas the 1 lb. pot; Burroughs & Welcome’s tabloids, pesetas 2.50 the\r\nsmall bottle of 25; and most other things in about the same\r\nproportion.[24] The Customs receipts form, with the exception of the tax\r\non real estate, the largest single item in the Budget. For the year 1909\r\nthey were estimated at pesetas 153,600,000 (£6,144,000).\r\n\r\nThe _Contribucion industrial_ is a tax upon every imaginable trade,\r\nprofession, and industry that can be exercised: on merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, shopkeepers, professional men of all sorts, on means of\r\ntransit, on public entertainments, on schools, newspapers--in short, it\r\nis almost impossible to find any kind of business or occupation that is\r\nnot taxed.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the tax varies with the population, a scale of ten\r\ndifferent rates being drawn up according to the size of the town.\r\nBankers pay from about £300 a year downwards, according to the place of\r\nresidence; merchants from £200; shopkeepers from £70; hotels from £60;\r\ncontractors 6 per mil. on their contracts; railways £10 per kilometre\r\nconstructed, and a tax on their receipts; brokers from £80; newspapers\r\nfrom £35; publishers from £25; private schools from £10; and so on. It\r\nis tedious and unnecessary to accumulate instances.[25]\r\n\r\nThat such a burdensome tax as this necessarily hampers trade and goes to\r\nprevent commercial and industrial development needs no demonstration:\r\nthe thing is self-evident. The compiler of the manual of this law says\r\nin his Introduction, with perfect truth, that it has the radical defect\r\nof making heavier demands as the trader’s profits fall, and that the\r\nframers of the law, so far from attempting to harmonise the interests of\r\nthe Treasury with those of the taxpayer, thought only how to squeeze\r\nhim, so that the tax nips in the bud whatever might aid in the increase\r\nof prosperity or open new fields for the productiveness of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis tax immediately affects the professional and commercial classes:\r\nthe poor, such as street hawkers, journeymen labourers, fishermen, &c.,\r\nare exempt; but indirectly they too suffer, as naturally it helps to\r\nincrease the price of necessaries.\r\n\r\nThe greatest burden on the working classes--and it is a very grievous\r\none--is the _octroi_, or _consumo_, a heavy tax on nearly every kind of\r\nfood, drink, and fuel, and on timber, stone, lime, &c.; in short, on\r\nnearly everything that is consumed in use. The fisherman has to pay\r\n_consumo_ on his catch before he can sell it; the farmer on his dead\r\nmeat, poultry, and eggs brought to market; the charcoal-burner on his\r\ncharcoal; and so on. The tax, varying in details, is levied in every\r\ntown and village, and thus may be, and often is, paid twice over by the\r\nsame goods, if they happen to be conveyed from one town to another.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that such a tax on the necessaries of life presses with\r\nexceptional severity on the poor, and it is, moreover, steadily rising,\r\nwhile wages remain stationary. It is usually farmed out to syndicates\r\nwhich are said, and no doubt with truth, to be making enormous profits\r\nout of it. These syndicates are believed by the people to consist in\r\nmany cases of persons who\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nA SELLER OF PALM-LEAF BRUSHES AND FANS.\r\n\r\n[To face page 289.]\r\n\r\nrepresent the Jesuits, and the oppressiveness of the tax and the steady\r\nrise in its amount form another count in the heavy indictment of the\r\npoor against the Religious Orders. The estimated receipts from this tax\r\nin the Budget for 1909 were pesetas 58,000,000 (about £3,520,000).\r\n\r\n“Everything in the country is dying of the _consumos_,” said a working\r\nwoman of about sixty years of age, who remembers with regret how much\r\neasier the life of the poor was in the days of Isabel II. “Every four\r\nyears the contract for the _consumos_ in our province is put up to\r\nauction, and every time they are sold the price is raised four or five\r\nthousand duros,[26] and _we_ have to pay the difference. Yesterday\r\nManolo paid four duros _consumo_ for the fish he sold in the market, and\r\nall he had for himself after twenty-four hours’ work was ten reals. The\r\nman who rents the _consumos_ from the Government is rotten with money\r\n(_podrido de dinero_): millions and millions of pesetas he has, all\r\nwrung from the necessities of the poor. Don Alfonso does not like it;\r\nevery one knows that. If he had his own way there would be no _consumo_\r\nfor the poor. Already since he came into power we have been relieved of\r\nthe _consumo_ on wine, green vegetables, and potatoes, and they say that\r\ntwo years hence, when the contract runs out, he wishes that it shall not\r\nbe renewed. But that would not suit the Government nor the Jesuits, who\r\nare mixed up in this business. They would lose too much which they now\r\nare able to put into their own pockets. So they would like to make\r\nanother revolution to get rid of Don Alfonso, as they got rid of his\r\ngrandmother, before their contract comes to an end. In her time bread\r\ncost just half what it does now, twenty-five eggs cost five reals\r\n(pesetas 1.25) instead of two pesetas a dozen, and for four cuartos we\r\ncould buy a piece of pork as big as we get now for two reals.[27] Salt\r\nwas free of _consumo_, so was oil, so was cheese, and shell-fish and\r\nchestnuts sold in the street were not taxed, so that they could be\r\nbought for much less than now, and the whole reason is because the\r\nGovernment lets the taxes instead of taking the trouble to collect them\r\nas was done in the time of Queen Isabella.”\r\n\r\nWhether this good lady, whose words I have translated literally from\r\nnotes made at the time, was right or wrong in her supposition as to the\r\ninterest of the Jesuits in this tax, and as to the quadrennial increase\r\nin the amount paid for it by the syndicate of farmers who exploit it, I\r\ncannot say. I quote her words as an instance of what is said on all\r\nsides by her class whenever the subject is mentioned, and as far as I\r\ncan learn she is quite correct in her comparison of the prices of food\r\nnow with those of forty years or so ago.\r\n\r\nTobacco and sugar are Government monopolies, farmed out to companies,\r\nwhich also are popularly believed to be under the control of the\r\nJesuits. I have never seen any accounts of the profits of the Tobacco\r\nCompany, but their shares are quoted at about 390 to 400, which speaks\r\nfor itself. The tobacco they supply is very bad, and outrageously dear.\r\nThe estimated receipts from this source were pesetas 140,400,000\r\n(£5,616,000).\r\n\r\nThe sugar trust was created comparatively recently. A short account of\r\nthe last annual meeting of the shareholders was published by the Press\r\nin November, 1909, from which it appears that the trust made a profit in\r\nthe year, in round figures, of pesetas 8,400,000 on a gross income of\r\npesetas 14,600,000 (say £336,000 on £584,000), and pays a dividend of 8\r\nper cent. And during the past twelve months the price of sugar has been\r\nrising, and now stands at about 7d. per lb. Figures like these,\r\nrelating to a necessary of life which is the one luxury of the poor, do\r\nnot require comment, especially in view of the fact that enough cane and\r\nbeetroot sugar for the entire needs of the population could be produced\r\nin the country, where both soil and climate are suitable in a great part\r\nof the southern provinces. But one company after another has been\r\ncrushed out of existence, and only ruined factories remain to remind the\r\ntraveller of what ought to be prosperous undertakings, beneficial to the\r\nwhole nation. From this source the State gets pesetas 31,600,000\r\n(£1,264,000).\r\n\r\nMatches are another monopoly, also farmed out. They are of course bad\r\nand very dear--½d. or 1d. for fifty matches, according to quality. The\r\nconditions under which the operatives work are, I am told on good\r\nauthority, simply deplorable, and growing worse instead of better. The\r\nestimated receipts are pesetas 10,000,000 (£400,000).\r\n\r\nA tax which combines a maximum of irritation with a minimum of profit is\r\none which is levied on the business books of persons engaged in\r\ncommerce. Every page of the ledger, cash book, press copy book, &c., has\r\nto be officially stamped at a charge of so much per page: the total\r\ncharge for a complete set of commercial books sometimes amounting to 500\r\npesetas (£20), and not only so, but the Government--presumably in order\r\nto get more out of the tax--prescribes the method by which the merchant\r\nmust keep his books. I was told by the manager of a large foreign\r\nindustrial concern that he has to employ twice as many clerks as he\r\nneeds, solely because the authorities insist on a cumbrous and obsolete\r\nsystem of book-keeping.\r\n\r\nThe law enacts that pious foundations which offer their manufactures for\r\npublic sale are liable to taxation. It is currently said that this\r\nobligation is evaded. Whether this is the case or not I cannot say from\r\npersonal knowledge, but certainly any visitor can purchase sweets or\r\nneedlework made in the convents. Indeed, some of them are celebrated for\r\ntheir confectionery, which is always sold a trifle under the cost of\r\nsimilar goods made by a lay tradesman.\r\n\r\nIf the taxes were fairly and honestly collected, their amount could be\r\nmaterially reduced. But as a matter of fact many are not collected at\r\nall from the persons most able to pay. The tax-collector is usually\r\nwilling, for a consideration, to play the part of the unjust steward,\r\nand take less than the proper amount. It is sometimes said that only\r\nfools and foreigners pay the taxes, and cases have occurred in my own\r\nknowledge where bribery in the proper quarter has effected a\r\nsubstantial reduction in the amount accepted. Every resident in Spain\r\nknows of such instances: the thing is notorious, is talked of quite\r\nopenly, and is done with hardly any attempt at concealment. It is\r\nimpossible to conjecture what proportion of the total taxes due is thus\r\ninformally remitted, but it must be something considerable.\r\n\r\nComplaints about evasions of taxation frequently appear in the papers:\r\nthus it was stated as a fact in the _Liberal_ in February, 1910, that\r\nabout 45 per cent, of those liable for _Contribution industrial_ evade\r\npayment. In the same newspaper, in the same month, appeared a long\r\nstatement, signed by the officials of the Guild of Cab Proprietors in\r\none of the large towns, accusing certain owners of livery stables, who\r\nlet smart carriages for hire, of defrauding the municipality of some\r\n50,000 pesetas (about £2,000) a year by falsifying the declarations on\r\nwhich they take out their licences, and no attempt was made to show that\r\nthe accusation was unfounded. Complaints about evasion of taxation by\r\nlarge landowners also are of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nQuite recently the Government has seriously taken up this question of\r\nfalsified returns, especially in the case of real estate, and is making\r\na systematic inspection of the properties liable for taxation. An\r\nimmense amount of fraud has already been discovered in the towns, and\r\nthe case of the rural estates is probably worse. I was lately told of an\r\ninstance where, to my informant’s knowledge, an estate which adjoins his\r\nown has been paying 60 pesetas a year, whereas it should have paid about\r\n2,000. In some parts of the country the large landowners are doing their\r\nutmost to oppose the carrying on of the Ordnance Survey, because the\r\neffect of it would be to define and make public the extent of their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious mode of defrauding the exchequer of succession duties is\r\npractised on a gigantic scale. This consists in depositing personal\r\nproperty in the banks in the joint names of all concerned, actual\r\nholders and heirs apparent, to the order of any one of them. Thus on the\r\ndeath of the father, the owner of the personal estate, it passes to his\r\nson without any legal intervention, and the Treasury is powerless to\r\ncollect the succession duties. Under the Spanish law as it now stands,\r\nif one of the owners of such a joint deposit dies, the deposit pays a\r\nproportion of the duties corresponding to the number of names in which\r\nit stands: a half if there are two, a third if there are three, and so\r\non. In January, 1910, there were “undefined deposits” (_depósitos\r\nindistintos_) as they are called amounting to nearly 519,700,000\r\npesetas (about £20,788,000) in the Bank of Spain alone, and Alvarado,\r\nMoret’s Minister of Finance, obtained a Royal Decree dealing with these\r\ndeposits. His plan was simple: merely to make the joint deposit liable\r\nfor the whole duty on the death of any one of those interested. As this\r\nwould oblige the owner to pay if the heir died first, it is obvious that\r\nthe practice of depositing in joint names would at once come to an end.\r\nBut Cobian, Alvarado’s successor in Canalejas’ Ministry, suspended the\r\ndecree, a proceeding inexplicable in a Minister whose Chief loudly\r\nproclaims his democratic principles. Meanwhile the depositors took\r\nimmediate advantage of the respite afforded them by the suspension of\r\nthe decree to transfer some 200,000,000 pesetas (about £8,000,000) to\r\nbanks abroad, and most probably a good deal more will go the same way.\r\nThe Religious Orders are fighting the decree tooth and nail, because\r\nwhile legally formed associations, who do not desire to conceal their\r\ncapital, do not object to the decree, illegal associations, who have\r\nreasons for secrecy as to their affairs, find in the system of joint\r\ndeposits an easy way of escaping their liabilities. It must be\r\nremembered that most of the Religious Orders now established in Spain\r\nare illegal, the Concordat only allowing of two, together with a third\r\nnot yet named.\r\n\r\nIt is always assumed, as a matter of course, that the whole\r\nadministration of the country is corrupt. When an unexpected deficit\r\nappears in public accounts, governmental or municipal, when a sum of\r\nmoney voted for a certain purpose has evidently not been spent as\r\nintended, when, as frequently happens, money owing by the State or the\r\nMunicipality is not paid--in short, whenever there is anything in the\r\nnational or local administration of the public funds which calls for\r\nexplanation, it is taken for granted that some one in office has been\r\nstealing. Whether this assumption is justified or not I do not pretend\r\nto say. All I know is that it is universally made.\r\n\r\nI asked a Spaniard on one occasion why a certain public building had\r\nnever been finished. “No doubt the Alcalde uses the money to keep up his\r\ncarriage,” was the reply. The man certainly did not know the facts, but\r\nthis was to him the most plausible explanation. When a few years ago\r\nAdmiral Cervera was ordered to fight the United States with ships armed\r\nwith obsolete guns and shells that did not fit them, every one said, and\r\nstill says, if the subject is spoken of, that officials in the\r\nGovernment stole the money that ought to have been spent on the Navy.\r\nThe system extends, or is said to extend, from the highest ranks of\r\nofficialdom downwards, and if this is true, it must necessarily operate\r\nin substantially reducing the total funds available for the Treasury.\r\n\r\nA minor matter, which I only mention because, it goes to illustrate once\r\nmore the system of over-taxation with no adequate result, is the postal\r\nservice. A letter in Spain does not cost a penny, as it does everywhere\r\nelse; it costs twopence: of this three-halfpence are paid by the sender\r\nand a halfpenny by the receiver. In exchange for this, the Government\r\ngives a service which is indifferent in the large towns, and infamously\r\nbad in the smaller towns and the rural districts, where there is no\r\nsecurity whatever that any given letter will reach sender or receiver,\r\nand where, to my own knowledge, a very large number are lost.\r\n\r\nGambling in the national lottery, which is drawn about three times a\r\nmonth, is almost universal, and an immense amount of money must be\r\nwasted on it. I remember seeing a man in a second-class railway\r\ncarriage, after borrowing my newspaper to see the result of a drawing,\r\nthrow away at least a dozen tickets, representing a cost of either three\r\nor five pesetas each. The lottery is conducted with absolute fairness,\r\nand it might be argued that, as people will gamble, it is better that\r\nthey should do so on a straightforward lottery than, _e.g._, on\r\nhorse-racing or some other sport of doubtful honesty. On the other hand,\r\nthere is no doubt that the fact of these lottery tickets being thrust\r\nunder the noses of the public all day long, coupled with the reports\r\ncurrent in conversation and the particulars given in the Press of the\r\nsudden wealth which has accrued to this and the other working man\r\nthrough a lucky number, must foment the gambling spirit, which is\r\nsufficiently rife in Spain without any such official encouragement. The\r\nestimated net receipts from the lottery for 1909 were pesetas 35,250,000\r\n(£1,410,000).\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind, in connection with the universal venality of\r\nthe lower grades of the bureaucracy, that a certain amount of excuse is\r\nto be found in the salaries they receive, which are miserably small in\r\namount and often in arrears. When a man has to keep himself and his\r\nfamily on two pesetas a day, it is not surprising that he takes\r\nadvantage of the opportunities which his official position gives him to\r\nincrease by illicit means a wage on which it is quite impossible that he\r\nshould live decently and honestly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS OF REGENERATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS OF REGENERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regeneration of Spain must necessarily be a slow process, for the\r\ncauses of her degradation are deep-seated, and are not to be removed by\r\nmere legislative enactments or alteration of the machinery of\r\ngovernment. One of the principal difficulties with which the country has\r\nto contend is the dishonesty of the bureaucracy, which paralyses any\r\nreform that may be attempted. Of what use is legislation, when the laws\r\nare not honestly administered? If what is the common talk of all classes\r\nhas any foundation whatever in fact, the whole of the bureaucracy, from\r\ntop to bottom, not excluding the inferior judiciary, is venal and\r\ncorrupt, and until a tradition of honest administration is established\r\namendment will be difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe history of Spain for the last three hundred years affords an\r\nillustration of the proposition established by Lecky[28] that “the\r\nperiod of Catholic ascendancy was on the whole one of the most\r\ndeplorable in the history of the human mind.” In no country in Western\r\nEurope has the Church of Rome been so entirely absolute and dominant,\r\nsince the Reformation, as in Spain, where the Inquisition instantly and\r\nfinally crushed out all freedom of thought and all opposition to\r\ntheological orthodoxy. The Church in Spain to-day enjoys the unique\r\nposition of holding a monopoly of the spiritual direction of the nation.\r\nAlthough other creeds and forms of worship are tolerated, there is no\r\nreligious liberty. Everywhere else, even in Catholic countries, there is\r\na vigilant and hostile body of opinion, of more or less weight, which\r\nnecessarily contributes by its very existence to moralise the Church and\r\nto enforce on the priesthood a certain standard of duty. In Spain this\r\ncheck is absent. There is no rival Church, for the Spanish Protestants\r\nare too few in number and too insignificant in position to make their\r\ninfluence felt, and the working classes, who, as has been shown, are\r\nbitterly hostile to the priesthood, are inarticulate, and powerless as\r\nan influence corrective of abuses, while the middle classes, who might\r\ndo something towards enforcing a higher standard, are generally\r\nspeaking, indifferent.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the corruption of the spiritual power in Spain is\r\nresponsible for the low moral standard of the laity is an exceedingly\r\ndifficult question, on which I am not capable of pronouncing an opinion.\r\nThere is no doubt that Spain for the last three hundred years has\r\nsuffered from a succession of some of the worst, the most incompetent,\r\nand the most corrupt rulers known to history. During all this time,\r\nexcept perhaps during the thirty years when Charles III. was on the\r\nthrone, the Church was supreme. If the clergy, the directors of the\r\nconscience of the nation, armed with the power of the confessional and\r\nsupported if necessary by the secular arm, had deliberately set their\r\nfaces against the system of public venality and corruption instituted by\r\nLerma and Olivares and continued by their subordinates and successors,\r\nit is difficult to believe that the upas-tree would have grown so tall\r\nand struck its roots so deeply as it has.\r\n\r\nThe excessive centralisation of the whole administration in Madrid,\r\ncoupled with the Spanish habit of writing long letters and reports about\r\nevery trivial question, which reports are referred for further\r\ninformation from one official to another before the Minister or other\r\nauthority gives his final decision, paralyses all initiative and causes\r\ninfinite delays and annoyances over the simplest matters. On the other\r\nhand, if effective local self-government were given under existing\r\nconditions, the _Cacique_ would be even more powerful than he now is,\r\nand Spain would be ruled, not by a single bureaucracy, but by a number\r\nof irresponsible autocrats.\r\n\r\nThus before Spain can effectually reform herself there is needed a\r\nchange of heart, a vital conviction that only through honest and\r\nfearless administration is redemption possible. An educated Spaniard\r\nonce observed to me, when discussing this matter: “In England you act on\r\nthe supposition that a person in office is an honest man, and if you\r\nfind that he is not, you punish him severely. In Spain we presuppose\r\ndishonesty, and do not chastise the rogue when he is found out.” This is\r\nperfectly true. There are swarms of official inspectors who are supposed\r\nto inspect everything connected with the public administration. But the\r\ninspectors themselves are venal, and for a sufficient consideration will\r\nreport that all is well when it is far from well. _Quis custodiet ipsos\r\ncustodes?_ It is the rarest thing to hear of any official being punished\r\nfor peculation or receiving bribes.\r\n\r\nEvery educated Spaniard is fully aware of this canker, which is rotting\r\nthe whole body politic: they talk to each other and to foreigners about\r\nit with the utmost frankness, entirely recognising the greatness of the\r\nevil and usually despairing of any amendment.\r\n\r\nTo turn to another side of the same question. In a different way the\r\nbullfight is responsible for an amount of moral degradation that no one\r\nbut a Spaniard can adequately estimate. It is not only that the\r\nspectacle of broken-down horses gored to death and a wild beast worried\r\nfor half an hour at a stretch is in itself debasing, but the whole\r\natmosphere created by the amusement is thoroughly vicious and degrading.\r\nThis is not merely my private opinion: I repeat what has been told me by\r\ncultured and thoughtful Spaniards, who see in its popularity one of the\r\nmany obstacles to the growth of a higher standard of morality. Happily\r\nthere are indications that the taste for the sport is on the wane. I\r\nknow numerous members of the upper middle class and many working people,\r\nboth men and women, who object strongly to the institution, and never\r\nattend a bullfight, and bullrings have been closed in many of the\r\nsmaller towns during the last ten years or so, for want of support. But\r\nthe vested interests--the cattle-breeders who make their living by\r\nbreeding the bulls, the impresarios who get up the shows, the companies\r\nwho have invested millions of pesetas in building bullring’s, the\r\nthousands of men employed in them in various capacities, and the\r\nbull-fighters themselves--form together a very powerful combination with\r\na good deal of political influence, and it will be many years yet before\r\nthis blot on civilisation disappears.[29]\r\n\r\nOne deplorable fact connected with the bullfights is the extent to which\r\nthey are patronised by foreign visitors, and of these the English are\r\namong the worst offenders. I have been told, though I cannot vouch for\r\nthe truth of the statement, that one bullring close to Gibraltar is\r\npractically kept going by the English spectators, and that but for their\r\nsupport it would be closed. I know that Englishmen and English women, in\r\nscores and hundreds, every year, some of them ardent supporters at home\r\nof the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, make a point,\r\nwhen they come to Spain, of going to see the show. “No, I daresay I\r\nshan’t like it,” they will say, “but when one is in Spain it is one of\r\nthe things one ought to see.” Let us hope that they do not realise that\r\ntheir example goes to make the task of the Spanish social reformers\r\neven more up-hill and heart-breaking than it need be.\r\n\r\nI may instance an University professor who was wearing himself out in\r\nthe endeavour to raise the moral and intellectual standard of his\r\npupils. He himself was educated in England, and had the highest respect\r\nfor English customs and institutions and for the general code of English\r\nhonour. He told me that he had lain awake all one night trying to find a\r\nreply to his lads when they said: “If the English, whom you hold up to\r\nus as an example in so many ways, support the bullfight, there can be no\r\nreason why we should condemn it.”\r\n\r\n“And meanwhile,” said the professor bitterly, “your English ladies come\r\nout of the bullring and tell me that what they have seen there proves us\r\nto be a nation of barbarians.”\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should be remembered that Spaniards of all classes\r\nhave a great admiration for England and English institutions, which has\r\nbeen recently increased thanks to the popularity of the Queen. One sees\r\nthis in all directions. English is beginning to replace French as the\r\nfirst foreign language a young Spaniard learns; English games and\r\nEnglish fashions are rapidly being introduced; and one of the leaders\r\nof the Republican party has proclaimed a democratic Monarchy on English\r\nlines to be the best compromise possible under existing conditions in\r\nSpain. So that the support which English visitors give to the bullring\r\nis probably more influential for harm than that of other foreigners.\r\n\r\nMaterially, moreover, the bullring operates in a manner prejudicial to\r\nthe country. All the best land has to be given up to the bulls, which\r\nrequire immense space to keep them from fighting each other. Thus great\r\nestates, which, if cultivated, would employ numerous labourers and\r\nproduce a rich return, are lost to the nation.\r\n\r\nIn this matter, too, the Church might exercise a good influence and does\r\nnot. On the contrary, the Clericalist newspapers give at least as much\r\nspace to reports of the bullfights as do any others, and one of the\r\nreproaches levelled against the clergy by the working classes is that\r\nthey attend these shows disguised in lay dress, and associate with\r\nbullfighters, regardless of the prohibition of the Church. In the parish\r\nleaflet already quoted, one of the cases of conscience put is “whether\r\nit is a sin to attend a bullfight”: to which the answer returned is,\r\n“No, it is not.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSetting aside the question of a moral reform, without which legislative\r\nand administrative changes can produce little or no fruit, it may be\r\nuseful to consider what measures are urgently needed to contribute to\r\nthe intellectual and material development of the country.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost the Church should be confined to its spiritual\r\nfunctions, and restrained from active interference in politics,\r\neducation, and business.\r\n\r\nIn a circular issued by the Bishop of Madrid in December, 1909, on the\r\nduties of Catholics in the elections, it is laid down that the Catholic\r\nvoter must not vote for a Liberal as against a Catholic, and that a\r\nLiberal is, _inter alia_, “one who refuses adhesion to the propositions\r\nand doctrines laid down by the Apostolic See, _principally in reference\r\nto the relations of the Church to the State_” (italics mine).\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Rome to what it calls “liberalism” is so well known that\r\nthere is no need to dilate upon it here. It is quite certain that unless\r\nand until the Church can be excluded from intervention in the State, no\r\nprogress will be possible. The struggle will, no doubt, be severe, for\r\nSpain is now the last stronghold of the Roman Church; but once the\r\ndemocracy can make its voice effectively heard, the end will not be\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nIn education the dominance of the Church is, if possible, more\r\nprejudicial, more of an obstacle to progress of the best kind, than it\r\nis in other branches of the work of the State, and the clergy in Spain,\r\nas elsewhere, are resisting with might and main every attempt to set up\r\nschools which are not under their control. A sufficiency of good and\r\nwell-conducted schools is one of the crying needs of the country; the\r\nClericalists say they are unable to finance even the Catholic schools\r\nwhich already exist, yet the lay schools supported by the party of\r\nprogress, although trivial in number, are not only virulently attacked,\r\nbut are made the basis of a campaign against the Crown and the\r\nConstitution, and every nerve is strained to rally “good Catholics” to\r\nthe fight against the spread of education among the poor.\r\n\r\nDecentralisation of the machinery of administration is badly needed,\r\nbecause under the present system vexatious and unnecessary delays must\r\noccur, even were there every desire for progress on the part of all\r\nconcerned. But local government cannot be effective, as has already been\r\nsaid, until the _Cacique_ is abolished.\r\n\r\nAmong what may be called the material elements of progress may be\r\nbriefly mentioned the need of improved means of communication,\r\nespecially good roads. Most of the roads which do exist in Spain are\r\nvery bad, and there are officially stated to be five thousand villages\r\nto which there is no road at all--nothing but a track or path,\r\nimpassable for wheeled vehicles.\r\n\r\nMuch needs to be done to encourage agriculture, and to introduce\r\nimproved methods. Systematic irrigation would render fertile hundreds of\r\nsquare miles of land, now sterile for lack of water. Phylloxera is\r\nravaging the vineyards, and a contagious blight is devastating the\r\norange plantations all over the southern provinces. Neither of these\r\nplagues can be effectively combated by private enterprise: public aid\r\nand public organisation are essential.\r\n\r\nThe postal service requires to be overhauled, and security taken, which\r\nnow does not exist, that postal matter shall reach its destination, and\r\nthat the contents be not stolen _en route_, as not infrequently happens.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the conduct of elections must be reformed, so that\r\nthe working classes may have an effectual, instead of, as now, a merely\r\nnominal vote. With a few notable exceptions they distrust their rulers,\r\nof whatever party; it should be made possible for them to return to the\r\nlocal councils and to the Cortes men in whom they have confidence, who\r\nknow what they want, and who will devote themselves with singleness of\r\nmind to getting it. The hope for the future of Spain lies in the\r\ndemocracy. The peasantry, from whose ranks the whole of the working\r\nclasses are more or less directly recruited, are sober, honest, and\r\nindustrious. They work long hours for low wages without complaint, and\r\nemployers--English, American, and so on--who come into contact with\r\nlarge numbers of them in the numerous industries established by foreign\r\nenterprise in the Peninsula, all speak in the highest terms of them as\r\nlabourers. In America, too, they are highly valued, and it is said that\r\nthe men who in the long run prove the most satisfactory and the best\r\nable to bear the trying conditions of work on the Panama Canal are the\r\nSpanish emigrants, of whom thousands cross the Atlantic every year.\r\n\r\nAs yet practically no member of this class, no matter what his natural\r\ngifts may have been, has ever risen to a position in which he could make\r\nhis voice heard in the counsels of his nation. Many Spanish peasants\r\nhave, no doubt, succeeded in Spanish South America, and some of them\r\nhave come home again to spend their money and their declining years in\r\ntheir native land. I am not aware that such men have been encouraged to\r\nplay a part in the politics of Spain, although their experience of the\r\noutside world would be of the greatest value. But the frequent\r\ninstances of Spanish peasants rising to affluence abroad show that it is\r\nnot their own incapacity, but the crushing burdens imposed on them by\r\nthose in power, which are the cause of the miserable condition of the\r\npeasantry at home. When a Spanish peasant gets a chance, he is well able\r\nto profit by it.\r\n\r\nSpain always seems to me like a great tree which for centuries has been\r\nallowed to go unpruned. It is half smothered with branches which bear no\r\nfruit, and the top is a mass of decay. Yet the trunk and the roots are\r\nsound and strong, so that once the barren wood which saps the life of\r\nthe tree is cut away, a new and healthy growth will soon replace it. But\r\nthe longer the difficult and painful process of pruning away the dead\r\nwood is delayed, the greater must grow the danger of a storm which will\r\ntear up the tree, roots and all.\r\n\r\nStill, in spite of all the drags on the wheels of progress, in spite of\r\nignorance, incapacity, and corruption, in spite of all the forces of\r\nreaction and all their efforts to keep Spain in the Slough of Despond\r\nfrom which she is struggling to emerge, one may say with Galileo, “_e\r\npur si muove_.” Some little advance is being made, slight and slow\r\nthough it be, and among the more thoughtful members of the younger\r\ngeneration one sees signs of a new spirit--an intelligent appreciation\r\nof the needs of the country and an honest and sincere resolve to work\r\nfor their attainment, which cannot fail to spread and to bear fruit in\r\ndue season. From the older generation nothing is to be hoped, but ere\r\nlong they will have yielded their places to the young men--university\r\nprofessors, officers in the Army, journalists, and so forth, many of\r\nwhom have ideas and ideals, and only lack power and opportunity to put\r\nthem in practice. The little leaven is working, and though as yet it is\r\nsmall in amount and the lump is large, those who wish Spain well need\r\nnot despair.\r\n\r\n    “For while the tired waves, vainly breaking,\r\n       Seem here no painful inch to gain,\r\n     Far back, through creeks and inlets making,\r\n       Comes silent, flooding in, the main.\r\n\r\n     And not by eastern windows only,\r\n       When daylight comes, comes in the light,\r\n     In front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly!\r\n       But westward, look! the land is bright.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this book was in the press, the Spanish Government took a step,\r\nthe ultimate consequences of which may be of the utmost moment for the\r\ncountry. In June, 1910, Señor Canalejas resolved to take definite action\r\nin the matter of the Religious Orders.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of his determination appears to have been the\r\ngeneral discontent created by the numerous cases of clerical corruption\r\nand intimidation alleged to have occurred in the recent elections to the\r\nCortes. A great meeting of protest was held at Madrid, in which both\r\nRepublicans and Socialists took part, and Señor Melquiades Alvarez, the\r\nRepublican leader, who not many months before had expressed his\r\nwillingness to compromise with the Monarchists on the lines of a\r\ndemocratic Monarchy like that of England, deliberately went over to the\r\nSocialists. This important _volte face_, coupled with the fact that at\r\nthe elections Madrid returned an overwhelming majority of Republicans,\r\nseems to have spurred Canalejas to action.\r\n\r\nThis action consisted of a modest Royal Order requiring the fulfilment\r\nof an edict of 1902, which compels the registration of all Religious\r\nOrders established in the country since that date, and the payment of\r\nthe industrial tax on the trades they carry on. This was followed by a\r\ndecree permitting members of other than the State religion to display\r\nemblems and notices outside their places of worship, and to hold funeral\r\nprocessions, in accordance with the provision made by the law of the\r\nland for liberty of conscience.\r\n\r\nThese two decrees hardly strike one as revolutionary; but they have been\r\nenough to set the whole of the Church party in an uproar; and the\r\nPrimate, the Archbishop of Toledo, has thrown down the gauntlet, defying\r\nthe Government to put the decrees in force, on the ground that the\r\nChurch owes obedience to Rome alone, and that the State has no power to\r\ninterfere with it. At the moment of writing the Vatican is trying to\r\nbully the Government by threatening to break off relations, the Catholic\r\nAssociations have telegraphed their grief and distress at the outrage\r\ninflicted upon the Pope by these Royal Orders, the ladies of the\r\nUltramontane aristocracy have petitioned the Premier to reconsider his\r\ndetermination to destroy the national Church and drag Spain’s religion\r\nin the dust, and the whole clerical party are preparing a furious\r\ncampaign against the Government, which, needless to say, is warmly\r\nsupported by all the Liberal elements in the country. The working\r\nclasses are naturally delighted, and several of them have congratulated\r\nthemselves in my hearing on this excellent result of the King’s\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n“He has seen what religious liberty means in England, and that has given\r\nhim courage to defy the Jesuits. Viva Alfonsito!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nNOTES ON POLITICIANS AND PERIODICALS\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERAL-MONARCHISTS\r\n\r\nWhen Sagasta died three men were proposed as leaders of the Liberal\r\nparty, Moret, Montero Rios, and Canalejas, Montero Rios gave way in\r\nfavour of Moret, in order to secure the unity of the party, but\r\nCanalejas preferred to lead a group of his own.\r\n\r\n=Moret.=--Was a Republican until Alfonso XII. was proclaimed. He then\r\njoined the Monarchical forces, the road being opened to him and many\r\nothers by the broadly liberal policy of Sagasta. He is English on the\r\nmother’s side.\r\n\r\n=Montero Rios.=--Also was a Republican until the Monarchy was\r\nre-established. Then he also adhered to Sagasta, bringing in with him\r\nhis own group, thenceforth to be known as the Radical wing of the\r\nLiberal-Monarchists.\r\n\r\n=Rafael Gasset.=--A staunch supporter of Moret’s policy. He is the author\r\nof the great irrigation scheme which is one of the most popular features\r\nin Moret’s programme. His enthusiasm for this improvement in the\r\nconditions of agriculture is so strong that his opponents have nicknamed\r\nhim “The Duke of the Reservoirs.” He is one of the strongest of the\r\nyounger Liberals, and his sincerity and devotion to the interest of the\r\nworking-classes have won him their confidence and respect.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Liberal-Monarchist party is supported by the _Sociedad\r\nEditorial de España_, which publishes three daily papers, all sold at 5\r\ncmes. per copy, or 1 peseta per month:\r\n\r\n=El Liberal.=--This paper has by far the largest circulation of any in\r\nSpain. Its political news is edited in Madrid, and telegraphed thence\r\ntwice daily, for the morning and evening editions, to branch offices at\r\nBilbao, Murcia, Barcelona, and Seville, where the local notes and news\r\nare added. Although conducted on Liberal-Monarchical lines, it is tinged\r\nwith democratic feeling. The Reactionists profess to consider it a\r\ndangerous enemy to religion, and label its readers atheists and\r\nanarchists. It is universally popular with the working classes.\r\n\r\n=El Heraldo de Madrid.=--Edited and published in the capital on\r\nRadical-Monarchical lines. On sale all over the country, but with a\r\ncomparatively small circulation among the working men outside of Madrid.\r\n\r\n=El Imparcial.=--Edited on Liberal-Monarchical lines in the interest of\r\nthe working classes, with full reports and articles on public works of\r\nevery description, trades unions, schemes for social and industrial\r\nreform, &c. It is on sale everywhere, and probably has the largest\r\ncirculation of any Madrid paper among the working classes in the\r\nprovinces, but does not come near _El Liberal_ in popularity.\r\n\r\nThe literary style of the writers employed by the _Sociedad Editorial_\r\nis cultivated and refined, the flying of political kites is discouraged,\r\nand personal abuse of opponents in politics finds no favour with the\r\ndirectors. The Society is abusively called a “Trust” by the Opposition,\r\nand reactionary journals daily publish headlines proclaiming that they\r\ndo not belong to the “Trust.” As a matter of fact the _Sociedad_ is an\r\nordinary limited liability company, well managed, and paying a good\r\ndividend, and partaking in no respect of the evils of the Trust system.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERAL DEMOCRATIC GROUP\r\n\r\n=Canalejas.=--Was a Republican, but maintained his independence, although\r\nadhering to Sagasta’s party, by proclaiming himself chief of a group of\r\nprogressive Liberals with Republican sympathies. The main plank in his\r\nprogramme has always been a direct attack upon the Church and Religious\r\nOrders. His policy is supported by the _Diario Universal_, but it has a\r\nsmall sale and is hardly known by working men outside of Madrid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY\r\n\r\nThe three most distinguished men in this party--=Melquiades Alvarez=,\r\n=Blasco Ibañez= and =Rodrigo Soriano=,--are all celebrated for their\r\nliterary and oratorical gifts, and enjoy the respect and confidence of\r\nthe veteran Liberal leaders, Moret and Montero Rios. Their policy may be\r\ndescribed as Republican in idea, but democratically Monarchical in\r\npractice, and their demands for vigorous measures of reform have\r\nmaterially strengthened the hands of the Liberal-Monarchists.\r\n\r\nThe organ of this party is _El Pais_, which, although its sale is very\r\nmuch smaller, has the largest circulation among the working classes\r\nafter _El Liberal_. The paper, as might be expected from the literary\r\nrenown of the leaders who direct it, is extremely well written, the\r\nstaff including some of the most highly educated Progressives in Spain.\r\nIt is possible, however, that the standard of intellectuality maintained\r\nin its leading articles militates against its success with the people.\r\nThe numerical strength of the Republicans is small. Thus, the\r\ncirculation of _El Pais_ being comparatively limited, the Reactionists\r\nare not nearly so much afraid of its influence on the country as of that\r\nof _El Liberal_, and indeed seem to treat it almost with indifference.\r\nIt is sold at the same price as the papers of the _Sociedad Editorial_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIALIST PARTY\r\n\r\n=Lerroux, Pablo Iglesias, Nakens.=--The Socialists in Spain have a very\r\nsmall following, and that confined to a few of the industrial cities,\r\nchiefly in the north. They formed a coalition with the Republicans to\r\nsecure the rout of the Clericalists at the Municipal Elections of 1909,\r\nbut the party is disunited, Iglesias and Lerroux seldom coming into line\r\nwith each other, while neither of them goes so far as Nakens, editor of\r\nthe Socialist organ _El Motin_ and a violent revolutionary. _El Motin_\r\nhas a very small circulation, and the programme of the Socialists has no\r\nserious influence in Spanish politics.\r\n\r\nThe Separatist, Regionalist, and other groups of Catalans exist solely\r\nfor the political purposes of that province, and play no part in the\r\nprogramme of either of the national parties.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Anarchist party, of which so much has been heard abroad,\r\nis practically non-existent. Their sporadic publications have no genuine\r\ncirculation and seldom live for over a month.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REACTIONARY, CLERICALIST, OR ULTRAMONTANE PARTY\r\n\r\nThe leader of this party, =Maura=--for many years a Liberal and the\r\nintimate friend of Moret--adopted Conservative principles under Silvela,\r\nand on his death was chosen to be leader of the Conservative party. His\r\nLiberal proclivities at first influenced him in the direction of reform,\r\nand gave him a strong and united following among the true Conservatives.\r\nBut as time passed he developed so much religious fervour that he has\r\nnow become recognised as the protagonist of the Religious Orders and the\r\nhope of the Church in the rapidly approaching final struggle with the\r\nState. Down to July, 1909, Maura was able to hold the Conservative party\r\ntogether, notwithstanding the marked development of reaction in his\r\npolicy. But after the events at Barcelona the Conservatives proper\r\nwithdrew their support on his programme of repression, and since his\r\nCabinet fell in October of that year, he has been universally regarded\r\nmore as the tool of the Ultramontanes than the leader of the\r\nConservative party.\r\n\r\nThe organ of Maura is _La Epoca_. It is sold in Madrid at 10 cmes., but\r\nis never seen on the bookstalls at any distance from the capital, and\r\ncan only be obtained in provincial towns by paying three months’\r\nsubscription to the Madrid office in advance. Its circulation is\r\nexclusively confined to the Clericalist aristocracy and plutocracy, by\r\nwhom it is subsidised.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARLIST, JAIMIST, OR TRADITIONALIST PARTY\r\n\r\nThis party, which numbers many of the richest men in Spain among its\r\nadherents, besides all the Religious Orders, with their enormous wealth\r\nand influence, is directed from the Castle of Frohsdorf by =Don Jaime,\r\nDuke of Madrid=, through persons whom he appoints in every province of\r\nSpain. The name brought most frequently before the public in connection\r\nwith the party, after the Pretender’s own, is that of =Llorens=, whose\r\nwork in the Melilla campaign is referred to in Chapter VII. The\r\nPretender has a complete organisation all over Spain, with _Caciques_ in\r\na large number of provincial towns and villages, and is supported by\r\nnumerous religious associations, clubs, colleges, &c., of a confessedly\r\nmilitant character, but confined to the upper classes.\r\n\r\nThe leading organs of the Carlists are the _Correo Español_ and the\r\n_Correo Catalan_, with offices in Madrid, Paris, and Barcelona; but\r\npractically all the reactionary Press supports the claims of the\r\nPretender more or less openly. The Carlist papers have no sale among the\r\nworking classes, and can only be obtained outside of Madrid (like _La\r\nEpoca_) by paying three months’ subscriptions in advance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong military politicians much in the public eye may be mentioned\r\nGenerals =Luque=, =Weyler=, and =Lopez Dominguez=, all on the Liberal side,\r\nand all strong men, in whom the people feel confidence. =Aguilera=, twice\r\nAlcalde of Madrid under Moret, who has been referred to in Chapter\r\nXIII., is highly popular with the poor of Madrid, owing to his\r\nconsistent kindness to the children, whom he takes under his special\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nCount =Romanones=, who engineered the crisis of February, 1910, is\r\ncredited by the working classes with having large interests in the mines\r\nof Beni-bu-Ifrur, and with having schemed to bring about the war in\r\nMorocco, in order to put money into his own pockets. This impression,\r\nwhether well or ill founded, is sufficient to make him cordially hated\r\nby them. He is credited with aspiring to the leadership of the Liberal\r\nparty, but it is hardly probable that his following would prove strong\r\nenough to give him that position.\r\n\r\n=La Cierva=, Minister of the Interior in Maura’s Cabinet, obtained an\r\nunenviable reputation in 1909, through his share in administering\r\nMaura’s policy of repression. Since his leader went out of office La\r\nCierva’s name has hardly been mentioned among the working classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSERVATIVE-MONARCHIST PARTY\r\n\r\n=Dato=, =Sanchez Toca=, and _Gonzalez Besada_ are the three leading\r\ndissentients from Maura’s policy of reaction, and now stand for the old\r\nConservative-Monarchical programme of peace and conciliation without\r\nsensational reforms. Their organ is the _Correspondencia de España_, an\r\neight-paged paper, well printed and got up, containing the fullest\r\nmilitary intelligence and the best foreign news to be found in the\r\nSpanish Press. It has a far larger circulation than any other\r\nConservative or Clericalist paper, and is to be seen on most of the\r\nkiosks in large towns. If it were not believed by the people to be\r\nsubsidised by the party opposed to electoral and social reforms, its\r\ninfluence in the country would doubtless be considerably stronger than\r\nit is. At present the working classes do not read it, although no other\r\npaper gives nearly as much matter for the price, which is 5 cmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAguilera, Señor, 240\r\n\r\n_Alcalde_, the, 265 note\r\n\r\nAlfonso XII., 112\r\n\r\nAlfonso XIII., 122-4, 182, 318\r\n\r\nAll Souls’ Day, observation of, 46;\r\n  scandal connected with Masses on, 84-6\r\n\r\n_Ayuntamiento_, the, 265 note;

applied to the head servant in the\r\nhouse of a priest or other man living alone.\r\n\r\n[10] Hume, “Modern Spain,” p. 550.\r\n\r\n[11] It is said--although I repeat the statement with all reserve--that\r\nthere are “parish” doctors employed by the Municipality of Madrid who\r\nrefuse to prescribe for a dying child unless the mother can show her\r\nmarriage certificate.\r\n\r\n[12] “Modern Spain,” p. 563.\r\n\r\n[13] It was stated as a fact that nineteen men in one regiment had\r\nbeen shot for refusing to go into action, and an Ultramontane of my\r\nacquaintance, who never reads anything but the newspapers of his own\r\nparty and never travels ten miles from his own village, solemnly\r\nassured me that the tale was true!\r\n\r\n[14] I was told at the time that many people in Madrid thought the bomb\r\nwas thrown on behalf of the Pretender.\r\n\r\n[15] The names of the monastery and of all the people concerned were\r\ngiven me, but I refrain for obvious reasons from publishing them.\r\n\r\n[16] It is said that the Association of Social Defence promises its\r\nworking men members a retaining fee of 3 pesetas a day should political\r\nexigencies compel them to leave their work at any time, the average\r\nlabourer’s wages all over the country being from 1.50 to 2 pesetas. It\r\nhas not been possible to obtain trustworthy information, either as to\r\nterms of membership or the actual numbers who have joined the league\r\nduring the last twelve months, but there is evidence that it has no\r\ninfluence among the working classes generally.\r\n\r\n[17] I have been told by an English friend that a Spanish acquaintance\r\nof his has, to his knowledge, lately made a substantial sum by selling\r\narms to the Religious Orders.\r\n\r\n[18] Most of them had been re-opened after Moret took office in\r\nOctober, 1909, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[19] This story evidently relates to the early days of the Cuban war.\r\n\r\n[20] This is not the only statement of the kind that I have heard.\r\n\r\n[21] “Modern Spain,” p. 531.\r\n\r\n[22] So clearly is this recognised on all sides, and so impossible does\r\npolitical honesty on the part of the rich appear to Spaniards, that the\r\n_Heraldo_, the leading moderate-Liberal paper, in the course of its\r\ncomments on the rejection by the English House of Lords of the Budget\r\nof 1909, said that if the Lords permitted the people to vote as they\r\npleased, this action on their part would have been justifiable, but\r\nthat naturally they would take the usual means to secure the suffrages\r\nof those over whom they had control, and with the immense wealth at\r\ntheir command would easily influence the elections in the direction\r\nthey desired.\r\n\r\n[23] In Spain not only every city, but every town and nearly every\r\nvillage, has its _Ayuntamiento_, more or less equivalent to our town or\r\nvillage Council, and its Alcalde, who has a good deal more power than\r\nthe Mayor of a Corporation.\r\n\r\n[24] The peseta is the same as the franc.\r\n\r\n[25] The sums set down in the schedules are less than those named. The\r\ntax has been increased at different times, and the additions amount in\r\nall to about 66 per cent.\r\n\r\n[26] The Spanish dollar, value five pesetas, and counted by the poor as\r\ntwenty reals.\r\n\r\n[27] The cuarto was a little over two centimes.\r\n\r\n[28] “History of European Morals,” Chap. IV.\r\n\r\n[29] In a decaying town of some 15,000 inhabitants, once wealthy and\r\nprosperous, two large new buildings have been erected during the last\r\nhalf-century, while on all sides dwelling-houses, great and small, are\r\nfalling into ruin. These are the Jesuit College and the bullring; and\r\nthe people say that the one is the parent of the other.\r\n\r\n[30] For a full account of the political parties in Spain see “The\r\nBackwardness of Spain,” by John Chamberlain. The author has an\r\nexhaustive knowledge of the country, and of many phases of society in\r\nSpain, but in my opinion he has not informed himself of the mind of\r\nthe provincial and rural population. This class, if only from their\r\nnumbers, cannot fail to exercise a strong influence over politics, when\r\nonce they obtain the right to vote which the Constitution gives them.",
