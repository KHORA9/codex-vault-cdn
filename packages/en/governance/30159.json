A Satyr_, and went through numerous editions in Defoe's\r\nlifetime. This e-book was prepared from _The Novels and Miscellaneous\r\nWorks of Daniel De Foe_, Volume 5 (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1855), in\r\nwhich the spelling, punctuation, and capitalization have apparently\r\nbeen modernized. Obvious printer errors have been corrected.

And I must\r\nadd, that had we been an unmix'd nation, I am of opinion it had been\r\nto our disadvantage: for to go no farther, we have three nations about\r\nus as clear from mixtures of blood as any in the world, and I know not\r\nwhich of them I could wish ourselves to be like; I mean the Scots, the\r\nWelsh, and the Irish; and if I were to write a reverse to the Satire,\r\nI would examine all the nations of Europe, and prove, that those\r\nnations which are most mix'd, are the best, and have least of\r\nbarbarism and brutality among them; and abundance of reasons might be\r\ngiven for it, too long to bring into a Preface.\r\n\r\nBut I give this hint, to let the world know, that I am far from\r\nthinking, 'tis a Satire upon the English nation, to tell them, they\r\nare derived from all the nations under heaven; that is, from several\r\nnations. Nor is it meant to undervalue the original of the English,\r\nfor we see no reason to like them worse, being the relicts of Romans,\r\nDanes, Saxons and Normans, than we should have done if they had\r\nremain'd Britons, that is, than if they had been all Welshmen.\r\n\r\nBut the intent of the Satire is pointed at the vanity of those who\r\ntalk of their antiquity, and value themselves upon their pedigree,\r\ntheir ancient families, and being true-born; whereas 'tis impossible\r\nwe should be true-born: and if we could, should have lost by the\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nThese sort of people, who call themselves true-born, and tell long\r\nstories of their families, and like a nobleman of Venice, think a\r\nforeigner ought not to walk on the same side of the street with them,\r\nare own'd to be meant in this Satire. What they would infer from their\r\nlong original, I know not, nor is it easy to make out whether they are\r\nthe better or the worse for their ancestors: our English nation may\r\nvalue themselves for their wit, wealth and courage, and I believe few\r\nnations will dispute it with them; but for long originals, and ancient\r\ntrue-born families of English, I would advise them to wave the\r\ndiscourse. A true Englishman is one that deserves a character, and I\r\nhave nowhere lessened him, that I know of; but as for a true-born\r\nEnglishman, I confess I do not understand him.\r\n\r\nFrom hence I only infer, that an Englishman, of all men, ought not to\r\ndespise foreigners as such, and I think the inference is just, since\r\nwhat they are to-day, we were yesterday, and to-morrow they will be\r\nlike us. If foreigners misbehave in their several stations and\r\nemployments, I have nothing to do with that; the laws are open to\r\npunish them equally with natives, and let them have no favour.\r\n\r\nBut when I see the town full of lampoons and invectives against\r\nDutchmen, only because they are foreigners, and the king reproached\r\nand insulted by insolent pedants, and ballad-making poets, for\r\nemploying foreigners, and for being a foreigner himself, I confess\r\nmyself moved by it to remind our nation of their own original, thereby\r\nto let them see what a banter is put upon ourselves in it; since\r\nspeaking of Englishmen _ab origine_, we are really all foreigners\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nI could go on to prove it is also impolitic in us to discourage\r\nforeigners; since it is easy to make it appear that the multitudes of\r\nforeign nations who have taken sanctuary here, have been the greatest\r\nadditions to the wealth and strength of the nation; the essential\r\nwhereof is the number of its inhabitants; nor would this nation ever\r\nhave arrived to the degree of wealth and glory it now boasts of, if\r\nthe addition of foreign nations, both as to manufactures and arms,\r\nhad not been helpful to it. This is so plain, that he who is ignorant\r\nof it, is too dull to be talked with.\r\n\r\nThe Satire therefore I must allow to be just, till I am otherwise\r\nconvinced; because nothing can be more ridiculous than to hear our\r\npeople boast of that antiquity, which if it had been true, would have\r\nleft us in so much worse a condition than we are in now: whereas we\r\nought rather to boast among our neighbours, that we are part of\r\nthemselves, of the same original as they, but bettered by our climate,\r\nand like our language and manufactures, derived from them, and\r\nimproved by us to a perfection greater than they can pretend to.\r\n\r\nThis we might have valued ourselves upon without vanity; but to disown\r\nour descent from them, talk big of our ancient families, and long\r\noriginals, and stand at a distance from foreigners, like the\r\nenthusiast in religion, with a Stand off, I am more holy than thou:\r\nthis is a thing so ridiculous, in a nation derived from foreigners, as\r\nwe are, that I could not but attack them as I have done.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas I am threatened to be called to a public account for this\r\nfreedom; and the publisher of this has been newspapered into gaol\r\nalready for it; tho' I see nothing in it for which the government can\r\nbe displeased; yet if at the same time those people who with an\r\nunlimited arrogance in print, every day affront the king, prescribe\r\nthe parliament, and lampoon the government, may be either punished or\r\nrestrained, I am content to stand and fall by the public justice of my\r\nnative country, which I am not sensible I have anywhere injured.\r\n\r\nNor would I be misunderstood concerning the clergy; with whom, if I\r\nhave taken any license more than becomes a Satire, I question not but\r\nthose gentlemen, who are men of letters, are also men of so much\r\ncandor, as to allow me a loose at the crimes of the guilty, without\r\nthinking the whole profession lashed who are innocent. I profess to\r\nhave very mean thoughts of those gentlemen who have deserted their own\r\nprinciples, and exposed even their morals as well as loyality; but not\r\nat all to think it affects any but such as are concerned in the fact.\r\n\r\nNor would I be misrepresented as to the ingratitude of the English to\r\nthe king and his friends; as if I meant the English as a nation, are\r\nso. The contrary is so apparent, that I would hope it should not be\r\nsuggested of me: and, therefore when I have brought in Britannia\r\nspeaking of the king, I suppose her to be the representative or mouth\r\nof the nation, as a body. But if I say we are full of such who daily\r\naffront the king, and abuse his friends; who print scurrilous\r\npamphlets, virulent lampoons, and reproachful public banters, against\r\nboth the king's person and his government; I say nothing but what is\r\ntoo true; and that the Satire is directed at such, I freely own; and\r\ncannot say, but I should think it very hard to be censured for this\r\nSatire, while such remain unquestioned and tacitly approved. That I\r\ncan mean none but such, is plain from these few lines, page 453.\r\n[Transcriber's Note: This reference is to a page number in the 1855\r\nreprint edition.]\r\n\r\n     Ye heavens regard! Almighty Jove, look down,\r\n     And view thy injured monarch on the throne.\r\n     On their ungrateful heads due vengeance take,\r\n     Who sought his aid, and then his part forsake.\r\n\r\nIf I have fallen rudely upon our vices, I hope none but the vicious\r\nwill be angry. As for writing for interest, I disown it; I have\r\nneither place, nor pension, nor prospect; nor seek none, nor will have\r\nnone: if matter of fact justifies the truth of the crimes, the Satire\r\nis just. As to the poetic liberties, I hope the crime is pardonable; I\r\nam content to be stoned, provided none will attack me but the\r\ninnocent.\r\n\r\nIf my countrymen would take the hint, and grow better natured from my\r\nill-natured poem as some call it; I would say this of it, that though\r\nit is far from the best Satire that ever was wrote, it would do the\r\nmost good that ever Satire did.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I am ready to ask pardon of some gentlemen too; who though\r\nthey are Englishmen, have good nature enough to see themselves\r\nreproved, and can hear it. These are gentlemen in a true sense, that\r\ncan bare to be told of their _faux pas_, and not abuse the reprover.\r\nTo such I must say, this is no Satire; they are exceptions to the\r\ngeneral rule; and I value my performance from their generous\r\napprobation, more than I can from any opinion I have of its worth.\r\n\r\nThe hasty errors of my verse I made my excuse for before; and since\r\nthe time I have been upon it has been but little, and my leisure less,\r\nI have all along strove rather to make the thoughts explicit, than the\r\npoem correct. However, I have mended some faults in this edition, and\r\nthe rest must be placed to my account.\r\n\r\nAs to answers, banters, true English Billingsgate, I expect them till\r\nnobody will buy, and then the shop will be shut. Had I wrote it for\r\nthe gain of the press, I should have been concerned at its being\r\nprinted again, and again, by pirates, as they call them, and\r\nparagraph-men; but would they but do it justice, and print it true,\r\naccording to the copy, they are welcome to sell it for a penny, if\r\nthey please.\r\n\r\nThe pence, indeed, is the end of their works. I will engage if nobody\r\nwill buy, nobody will write: and not a patriot poet of them all, now\r\nwill in defence of his native country, which I have abused, they say,\r\nprint an answer to it, and give it about for God's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of satire is reformation: and the author, though he doubt the\r\nwork of conversion is at a general stop, has put his hand in the\r\nplough. I expect a storm of ill language from the fury of the town.\r\nAnd especially from those whose English talent it is to rail: and,\r\nwithout being taken for a conjuror, I may venture to foretel, that I\r\nshall be cavilled at about my mean style, rough verse, and incorrect\r\nlanguage, things I indeed might have taken more care in. But the book\r\nis printed; and though I see some faults, it is too late to mend them.\r\nAnd this is all I think needful to say to them.\r\n\r\nPossibly somebody may take me for a Dutchman; in which they are\r\nmistaken: but I am one that would be glad to see Englishmen behave\r\nthemselves better to strangers, and to governors also, that one might\r\nnot be reproached in foreign countries for belonging to a nation that\r\nwants manners.\r\n\r\nI assure you, gentlemen, strangers use us better abroad; and we can\r\ngive no reason but our ill-nature for the contrary here.\r\n\r\nMethinks an Englishman who is so proud of being called a good fellow,\r\nshould be civil. And it cannot be denied, but we are, in many cases,\r\nand particularly to strangers, the most churlish people alive.\r\n\r\nAs to vices, who can dispute our intemperance, while an honest drunken\r\nfellow is a character in a man's praise? All our reformations are\r\nbanters, and will be so till our magistrates and gentry reform\r\nthemselves, by way of example; then, and not till then, they may be\r\nexpected to punish others without blushing.\r\n\r\nAs to our ingratitude, I desire to be understood of that particular\r\npeople, who pretending to be Protestants, have all along endeavoured\r\nto reduce the liberties and religion of this nation into the hands of\r\nKing James and his Popish powers: together with such who enjoy the\r\npeace and protection of the present government, and yet abuse and\r\naffront the king who procured it, and openly profess their uneasiness\r\nunder him: these, by whatsoever names or titles they are dignified or\r\ndistinguished, are the people aimed at; nor do I disown, but that it\r\nis so much the temper of an Englishman to abuse his benefactor, that I\r\ncould be glad to see it rectified.\r\n\r\nThey who think I have been guilty of any error, in exposing the crimes\r\nof my own countrymen to themselves, may, among many honest instances\r\nof the like nature, find the same thing in Mr. Cowley, in his\r\nimitation of the second Olympic Ode of Pindar; his words are these:--\r\n\r\n     But in this thankless world, the givers\r\n     Are envied even by the receivers.\r\n     'Tis now the cheap and frugal fashion,\r\n     Rather to hide than pay an obligation.\r\n     Nay, 'tis much worse than so;\r\n     It now an artifice doth grow,\r\n     Wrongs and outrages they do,\r\n     Lest men should think we owe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeak, Satire, for there's none can tell like thee,\r\nWhether 'tis folly, pride, or knavery,\r\nThat makes this discontented land appear\r\nLess happy now in times of peace, than war:\r\nWhy civil feuds disturb the nation more,\r\nThan all our bloody wars have done before.\r\n\r\n  Fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place,\r\nAnd men are always honest in disgrace:\r\nThe court preferments make men knaves in course:\r\nBut they which wou'd be in them wou'd be worse.\r\n'Tis not at foreigners that we repine,\r\nWou'd foreigners their perquisites resign:\r\nThe grand contention's plainly to be seen,\r\nTo get some men put out, and some put in.\r\nFor this our Senators make long harangues.\r\nAnd florid Ministers whet their polish'd tongues.\r\nStatesmen are always sick of one disease;\r\nAnd a good pension gives them present ease.\r\nThat's the specific makes them all content\r\nWith any King and any government.\r\nGood patriots at court abuses rail,\r\nAnd all the nation's grievances bewail:\r\nBut when the sov'reign balsam's once apply'd,\r\nThe zealot never fails to change his side;\r\nAnd when he must the golden key resign,\r\nThe railing spirit comes about again.\r\n\r\n  Who shall this bubbl'd nation disabuse,\r\nWhile they their own felicities refuse?\r\nWho at the wars have made such mighty pother,\r\nAnd now are falling out with one another:\r\nWith needless fears the jealous nations fill,\r\nAnd always have been sav'd against their will:\r\nWho fifty millions sterling have disburs'd\r\nTo be with peace, and too much plenty, curs'd;\r\nWho their old monarch eagerly undo,\r\nAnd yet uneasily obey the new.\r\nSearch, Satire, search; a deep incision make:\r\nThe poison's strong, the antidote's too weak.\r\n'Tis pointed truth must manage this dispute,\r\nAnd down-right English, Englishmen confute.\r\n\r\n  Whet thy just anger at the nation's pride;\r\nAnd with keen phrase repel the vicious tide,\r\nTo Englishmen their own beginnings show,\r\nAnd ask them, why they slight their neighbours so:\r\nGo back to elder times, and ages past,\r\nAnd nations into long oblivion cast;\r\nTo elder Britain's youthful days retire,\r\nAnd there for true-born Englishmen inquire,\r\nBritannia freely will disown the name,\r\nAnd hardly knows herself from whence they came;\r\nWonders that they of all men should pretend\r\nTo birth, and blood, and for a name contend.\r\nGo back to causes where our follies dwell,\r\nAnd fetch the dark original from hell:\r\nSpeak, Satire, for there's none like thee can tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nTRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nWherever God erects a house of prayer,\r\nThe Devil always builds a chapel there:\r\nAnd 'twill be found upon examination,\r\nThe latter has the largest congregation:\r\nFor ever since he first debauch'd the mind,\r\nHe made a perfect conquest of mankind.\r\nWith uniformity of service, he\r\nReigns with general aristocracy.\r\nNo non-conforming sects disturb his reign,\r\nFor of his yoke, there's very few complain.\r\nHe knows the genius and the inclination,\r\nAnd matches proper sins for ev'ry nation.\r\nHe needs no standing army government;\r\nHe always rules us by our own consent:\r\nHis laws are easy, and his gentle sway\r\nMakes it exceeding pleasant to obey.\r\nThe list of his vicegerents and commanders,\r\nOut-does your Cæsars, or your Alexanders.\r\nThey never fail of his infernal aid,\r\nAnd he's as certain ne'er to be betray'd.\r\nThro' all the world they spread his vast command,\r\nAnd death's eternal empire is maintain'd.\r\nThey rule so politicly and so well,\r\nAs if they were Lords Justices of hell;\r\nDuly divided to debauch mankind,\r\nAnd plant infernal dictates in his mind.\r\n\r\n  Pride, the first peer, and president of hell,\r\nTo his share, Spain, the largest province fell.\r\nThe subtle Prince thought fittest to bestow\r\nOn these the golden mines of Mexico,\r\nWith all the silver mountains of Peru;\r\nWealth which in wise hands would the world undo;\r\nBecause he knew their genius was such,\r\nToo lazy and too haughty to be rich:\r\nSo proud a people, so above their fate,\r\nThat, if reduced to beg, they'll beg in state:\r\nLavish of money, to be counted brave,\r\nAnd proudly starve, because they scorn to save;\r\nNever was nation in the world before,\r\nSo very rich, and yet so very poor.\r\n\r\n  Lust chose the torrid zone of Italy,\r\nWhere blood ferments in rapes and sodomy:\r\nWhere swelling veins o'erflow with living streams,\r\nWith heat impregnate from Vesuvian flames;\r\nWhose flowing sulphur forms infernal lakes,\r\nAnd human body of the soil partakes.\r\nThere nature ever burns with hot desires,\r\nFann'd with luxuriant air from subterranean fires:\r\nHere undisturbed, in floods of scalding lust,\r\nTh' infernal king reigns with infernal gust.\r\n\r\n  Drunkenness, the darling favourite of hell,\r\nChose Germany to rule; and rules so well,\r\nNo subjects more obsequiously obey,\r\nNone please so well, or are so pleased as they;\r\nThe cunning artist manages so well,\r\nHe lets them bow to heav'n, and drink to hell.\r\nIf but to wine and him they homage pay,\r\nHe cares not to what deity they pray;\r\nWhat god they worship most, or in what way.\r\nWhether by Luther, Calvin, or by Rome,\r\nThey sail for heaven, by wine he steers them home.\r\n\r\n  Ungovern'd passion settled first in France,\r\nWhere mankind lives in haste, and thrives by chance;\r\nA dancing nation, fickle and untrue,\r\nHave oft undone themselves, and others too;\r\nPrompt the infernal dictates to obey,\r\nAnd in hell's favour none more great than they.\r\n\r\n  The pagan world he blindly leads away,\r\nAnd personally rules with arbitrary sway:\r\nThe mask thrown off, plain devil, his title stands;\r\nAnd what elsewhere he tempts, he there commands;\r\nThere, with full gust, th' ambition of his mind,\r\nGoverns, as he of old in heaven design'd:\r\nWorshipp'd as God, his Paynim altars smoke,\r\nImbrued with blood of those that him invoke.\r\n\r\n  The rest by deputies he rules so well,\r\nAnd plants the distant colonies of hell;\r\nBy them his secret power he firm maintains,\r\nAnd binds the world in his infernal chains.\r\n\r\n  By zeal the Irish, and the Russ by folly,\r\nFury the Dane, the Swede by melancholy;\r\nBy stupid ignorance, the Muscovite;\r\nThe Chinese, by a child of hell, call'd wit;\r\nWealth makes the Persian too effeminate;\r\nAnd poverty the Tartar desperate:\r\nThe Turks and Moors, by Mah'met he subdues;\r\nAnd God has given him leave to rule the Jews:\r\nRage rules the Portuguese, and fraud the Scotch;\r\nRevenge the Pole, and avarice the Dutch.\r\n\r\n  Satire, be kind, and draw a silent veil,\r\nThy native England's vices to conceal:\r\nOr, if that task's impossible to do,\r\nAt least be just, and show her virtues too;\r\nToo great the first, alas! the last too few.\r\n\r\n  England, unknown, as yet unpeopled lay,--\r\nHappy, had she remain'd so to this day,\r\nAnd still to ev'ry nation been a prey.\r\nHer open harbours, and her fertile plains,\r\nThe merchant's glory these, and those the swain's,\r\nTo ev'ry barbarous nation have betray'd her;\r\nWho conquer her as oft as they invade her,\r\nSo beauty, guarded out by Innocence,\r\nThat ruins her which should be her defence.\r\n\r\n  Ingratitude, a devil of black renown,\r\nPossess'd her very early for his own:\r\nAn ugly, surly, sullen, selfish spirit,\r\nWho Satan's worst perfections does inherit;\r\nSecond to him in malice and in force,\r\nAll devil without, and all within him worse.\r\n\r\n  He made her first-born race to be so rude,\r\nAnd suffer'd her to be so oft subdued;\r\nBy sev'ral crowds of wandering thieves o'er-run,\r\nOften unpeopled, and as oft undone;\r\nWhile ev'ry nation that her powers reduced,\r\nTheir languages and manners introduced;\r\nFrom whose mix'd relics our compounded breed,\r\nBy spurious generation does succeed;\r\nMaking a race uncertain and uneven,\r\nDerived from all the nations under heaven.\r\n\r\n  The Romans first with Julius Cæsar came,\r\nIncluding all the nations of that name,\r\nGauls, Greek, and Lombards; and, by computation,\r\nAuxiliaries or slaves of ev'ry nation.\r\nWith Hengist, Saxons; Danes with Sweno came,\r\nIn search of plunder, not in search of fame.\r\nScots, Picts, and Irish from th' Hibernian shore;\r\nAnd conq'ring William brought the Normans o'er.\r\n\r\n  All these their barb'rous offspring left behind,\r\nThe dregs of armies, they of all mankind;\r\nBlended with Britons, who before were here,\r\nOf whom the Welch ha' blest the character.\r\n\r\n  From this amphibious, ill-born mob began,\r\nThat vain ill-natured thing, an Englishman.\r\nThe customs, sirnames, languages, and manners,\r\nOf all these nations, are their own explainers;\r\nWhose relics are so lasting and so strong,\r\nThey've left a Shiboleth upon our tongue;\r\nBy which, with easy search, you may distinguish\r\nYour Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman, English.\r\n\r\n  The great invading Norman let us know\r\nWhat conquerors in after-times might do.\r\nTo every musqueteer he brought to town,\r\nHe gave the lands which never were his own;\r\nWhen first the English crown he did obtain,\r\nHe did not send his Dutchmen home again.\r\nNo re-assumptions in his reign were known,\r\nDavenant might there ha' let his book alone.\r\nNo parliament his army could disband;\r\nHe raised no money, for he paid in land.\r\nHe gave his legions their eternal station,\r\nAnd made them all freeholders of the nation.\r\nHe canton'd out the country to his men,\r\nAnd every soldier was a denizen.\r\nThe rascals thus enrich'd, he called them lords,\r\nTo please their upstart pride with new-made words,\r\nAnd doomsday book his tyranny records.\r\n\r\n  And here begins the ancient pedigree\r\nThat so exalts our poor nobility.\r\n'Tis that from some French trooper they derive,\r\nWho with the Norman bastard did arrive:\r\nThe trophies of the families appear;\r\nSome show the sword, the bow, and some the spear,\r\nWhich their great ancestor, forsooth, did wear.\r\nThese in the herald's register remain,\r\nTheir noble mean extraction to explain,\r\nYet who the hero was no man can tell,\r\nWhether a drummer or a colonel:\r\nThe silent record blushes to reveal\r\nTheir undescended dark original.\r\n\r\n  But grant the best. How came the change to pass;\r\nA true-born Englishman of Norman race?\r\nA Turkish horse can show more history,\r\nTo prove his well-descended family.\r\nConquest, as by the moderns 'tis express'd,\r\nMay give a title to the lands possess'd;\r\nBut that the longest sword should be so civil,\r\nTo make a Frenchman English, that's the devil.\r\n\r\n  These are the heroes that despise the Dutch,\r\nAnd rail at new-come foreigners so much;\r\nForgetting that themselves are all derived\r\nFrom the most scoundrel race that ever lived;\r\nA horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones\r\nWho ransack'd kingdoms, and dispeopled towns;\r\nThe Pict and painted Briton, treach'rous Scot,\r\nBy hunger, theft, and rapine, hither brought;\r\nNorwegian pirates, buccaneering Danes,\r\nWhose red-hair'd offspring everywhere remains;\r\nWho, join'd with Norman French, compound the breed\r\nFrom whence your true-born Englishmen proceed.\r\n\r\n  And lest, by length of time, it be pretended,\r\nThe climate may this modern breed have mended;\r\nWise Providence, to keep us where we are,\r\nMixes us daily with exceeding care;\r\nWe have been Europe's sink, the jakes, where she\r\nVoids all her offal out-cast progeny;\r\nFrom our fifth Henry's time the strolling bands,\r\nOf banish'd fugitives from neighb'ring lands,\r\nHave here a certain sanctuary found:\r\nThe eternal refuge of the vagabond,\r\nWhere in but half a common age of time,\r\nBorrowing new blood and manners from the clime,\r\nProudly they learn all mankind to contemn,\r\nAnd all their race are true-born Englishmen.\r\n\r\n  Dutch Walloons, Flemmings, Irishmen, and Scots,\r\nVaudois, and Valtolins, and Hugonots,\r\nIn good Queen Bess's charitable reign,\r\nSupplied us with three hundred thousand men:\r\nReligion--God, we thank thee!--sent them hither,\r\nPriests, Protestants, the devil, and all together;\r\nOf all professions, and of ev'ry trade,\r\nAll that were persecuted or afraid:\r\nWhether for debt, or other crimes, they fled,\r\nDavid at Hackelah was still their head.\r\n\r\n  The offspring of this miscellaneous crowd,\r\nHad not their new plantations long enjoy'd,\r\nBut they grew Englishmen, and raised their votes,\r\nAt foreign shoals of interloping Scots;\r\nThe royal branch from Pict-land did succeed,\r\nWith troops of Scots and scabs from north of Tweed;\r\nThe seven first years of his pacific reign,\r\nMade him and half his nation Englishmen.\r\nScots from the northern frozen banks of Tay,\r\nWith packs and plods came whigging all away,\r\nThick as the locusts which in Egypt swarm'd,\r\nWith pride and hungry hopes completely arm'd;\r\nWith native truth, diseases, and no money,\r\nPlunder'd our Canaan of the milk and honey;\r\nHere they grew quickly lords and gentlemen,\r\nAnd all their race are true-born Englishmen.\r\n\r\n  The civil wars, the common purgative,\r\nWhich always use to make the nation thrive,\r\nMade way for all that strolling congregation,\r\nWhich throng'd in pious Charles's restoration.\r\nThe royal refugee our breed restores,\r\nWith foreign courtiers, and with foreign whores:\r\nAnd carefully re-peopled us again,\r\nThroughout his lazy, long, lascivious reign,\r\nWith such a blest and true-born English fry,\r\nAs much illustrates our nobility.\r\nA gratitude which will so black appear,\r\nAs future ages must abhor to bear:\r\nWhen they look back on all that crimson flood,\r\nWhich stream'd in Lindsey's, and Caernarvon's blood;\r\nBold Strafford, Cambridge, Capel, Lucas, Lisle,\r\nWho crown'd in death his father's fun'ral pile.\r\nThe loss of whom, in order to supply\r\nWith true-born English nobility,\r\nSix bastard dukes survive his luscious reign,\r\nThe labours of Italian Castlemain,\r\nFrench Portsmouth, Tabby Scott, and Cambrian;\r\nBesides the num'rous bright and virgin throng,\r\nWhose female glories shade them from my song.\r\nThis offspring if our age they multiply,\r\nMay half the house with English peers supply:\r\nThere with true English pride they may contemn\r\nSchomberg and Portland, new-made noblemen.\r\n\r\n  French cooks, Scotch pedlars, and Italian whores,\r\nWere all made lords or lords' progenitors.\r\nBeggars and bastards by this new creation\r\nMuch multiplied the peerage of the nation;\r\nWho will be all, ere one short age runs o'er,\r\nAs true-born lords as those we had before.\r\n\r\n  Then to recruit the commons he prepares,\r\nAnd heal the latent breaches of the wars;\r\nThe pious purpose better to advance,\r\nHe invites the banish'd Protestants of France;\r\nHither for God's sake, and their own, they fled\r\nSome for religion came, and some for bread:\r\nTwo hundred thousand pair of wooden shoes,\r\nWho, God be thank'd, had nothing left to lose;\r\nTo heaven's great praise did for religion fly,\r\nTo make us starve our poor in charity.\r\nIn ev'ry port they plant their fruitful train,\r\nTo get a race of true-born Englishmen;\r\nWhose children will, when riper years they see,\r\nBe as ill-natured, and as proud as we;\r\nCall themselves English, foreigners despise,\r\nBe surly like us all, and just as wise.\r\n\r\n  Thus from a mixture of all kinds began,\r\nThat heterogeneous thing, an Englishman:\r\nIn eager rapes, and furious lust begot,\r\nBetwixt a painted Briton and a Scot:\r\nWhose gend'ring offspring quickly learn'd to bow,\r\nAnd yoke their heifers to the Roman plough;\r\nFrom whence a mongrel half-bred race there came,\r\nWith neither name nor nation, speech or fame,\r\nIn whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran,\r\nInfused betwixt a Saxon and a Dane;\r\nWhile their rank daughters, to their parents just,\r\nReceived all nations with promiscuous lust.\r\nThis nauseous brood directly did contain\r\nThe well-extracted blood of Englishmen.\r\n\r\n  Which medley, canton'd in a heptarchy,\r\nA rhapsody of nations to supply,\r\nAmong themselves maintain'd eternal wars,\r\nAnd still the ladies loved the conquerors.\r\n\r\n  The Western Angles all the rest subdued,\r\nA bloody nation, barbarous and rude;\r\nWho by the tenure of the sword possess'd\r\nOne part of Britain, and subdued the rest:\r\nAnd as great things denominate the small,\r\nThe conquering part gave title to the whole;\r\nThe Scot, Pict, Briton, Roman, Dane, submit,\r\nAnd with the English Saxon all unite:\r\nAnd these the mixture have so close pursued,\r\nThe very name and memory's subdued;\r\nNo Roman now, no Briton does remain;\r\nWales strove to separate, but strove in vain:\r\nThe silent nations undistinguish'd fall,\r\nAnd Englishman's the common name for all.\r\nFate jumbled them together, God knows how;\r\nWhate'er they were, they're true-born English now.\r\n\r\n  The wonder which remains is at our pride,\r\nTo value that which all wise men deride;\r\nFor Englishmen to boast of generation\r\nCancels their knowledge, and lampoons the nation,\r\nA true-born Englishman's a contradiction,\r\nIn speech an irony, in fact a fiction:\r\nA banter made to be a test of fools,\r\nWhich those that use it justly ridicules;\r\nA metaphor intended to express,\r\nA man a-kin to all the universe.\r\n\r\n  For as the Scots, as learned men have said,\r\nThroughout the world their wand'ring seed have spread,\r\nSo open-handed England, 'tis believed,\r\nHas all the gleanings of the world received.\r\n\r\n  Some think of England, 'twas our Saviour meant,\r\nThe Gospel should to all the world be sent:\r\nSince when the blessed sound did hither reach,\r\nThey to all nations might be said to preach.\r\n\r\n  'Tis well that virtue gives nobility,\r\nElse God knows where had we our gentry,\r\nSince scarce one family is left alive,\r\nWhich does not from some foreigner derive.\r\nOf sixty thousand English gentlemen,\r\nWhose names and arms in registers remain,\r\nWe challenge all our heralds to declare\r\nTen families which English Saxons are.\r\n\r\n  France justly boasts the ancient noble line\r\nOf Bourbon, Montmorency, and Lorraine.\r\nThe Germans too, their house of Austria show,\r\nAnd Holland, their invincible Nassau.\r\nLines which in heraldry were ancient grown,\r\nBefore the name of Englishman was known.\r\nEven Scotland, too, her elder glory shows,\r\nHer Gordons, Hamiltons, and her Monro's;\r\nDouglas', Mackays, and Grahams, names well known,\r\nLong before ancient England knew her own.\r\n\r\n  But England, modern to the last degree,\r\nBorrows or makes her own nobility,\r\nAnd yet she boldly boasts of pedigree;\r\nRepines that foreigners are put upon her,\r\nAnd talks of her antiquity and honour:\r\nHer Sackvills, Savils, Cecils, Delamers,\r\nMohuns, Montagues, Duras, and Veeres,\r\nNot one have English names, yet all are English peers.\r\nYour Houblons, Papillons, and Lethuliers,\r\nPass now for true-born English knights and squires,\r\nAnd make good senate-members, or lord-mayors.\r\nWealth, howsoever got, in England makes\r\nLords of mechanics, gentlemen of rakes.\r\nAntiquity and birth are needless here;\r\n'Tis impudence and money makes a peer.\r\n\r\n  Innumerable city knights we know,\r\nFrom Blue-coat Hospitals, and Bridewell flow.\r\nDraymen and porters fill the city chair,\r\nAnd foot-boys magisterial purple wear.\r\nFate has but very small distinction set\r\nBetwixt the counter and the coronet.\r\nTarpaulin lords, pages of high renown,\r\nRise up by poor men's valour, not their own;\r\nGreat families of yesterday we show,\r\nAnd lords, whose parents were the Lord knows who.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nThe breed's described: now, Satire, if you can,\r\nTheir temper show, for manners make the man.\r\nFierce as the Briton, as the Roman brave,\r\nAnd less inclined to conquer than to save;\r\nEager to fight, and lavish of their blood,\r\nAnd equally of fear and forecast void.\r\nThe Pict has made them sour, the Dane morose,\r\nFalse from the Scot, and from the Norman worse.\r\nWhat honesty they have, the Saxon gave them,\r\nAnd that, now they grow old, begins to leave them.\r\nThe climate makes them terrible and bold:\r\nAnd English beef their courage does uphold:\r\nNo danger can their daring spirit dull,\r\nAlways provided when their belly's full.\r\n\r\n  In close intrigues, their faculty's but weak;\r\nFor, gen'rally, whate'er they know they speak.\r\nAnd often their own councils undermine\r\nBy their infirmity, and not design.\r\nFrom whence, the learned say, it does proceed,\r\nThat English treason never can succeed:\r\nFor they're so open-hearted, you may know\r\nTheir own most secret thoughts, and others too.\r\n\r\n  The lab'ring poor, in spite of double pay,\r\nAre saucy, mutinous, and beggarly;\r\nSo lavish of their money and their time,\r\nThat want of forecast is the nation's crime.\r\nGood drunken company is their delight;\r\nAnd what they get by day they spend by night.\r\nDull thinking seldom does their heads engage,\r\nBut drink their youth away, and hurry on old age.\r\nEmpty of all good husbandry and sense;\r\nAnd void of manners most when void of pence.\r\nTheir strong aversion to behaviour's such,\r\nThey always talk too little or too much.\r\nSo dull, they never take the pains to think;\r\nAnd seldom are good natured but in drink.\r\n\r\n  In English ale their dear enjoyment lies,\r\nFor which they starve themselves and families.\r\nAn Englishman will fairly drink as much,\r\nAs will maintain two families of Dutch:\r\nSubjecting all their labours to the pots;\r\nThe greatest artists are the greatest sots.\r\nThe country poor do by example live;\r\nThe gentry lead them, and the clergy drive;\r\nWhat may we not from such examples hope?\r\nThe landlord is their god, the priest their pope;\r\nA drunken clergy, and a swearing bench,\r\nHas given the reformation such a drench,\r\nAs wise men think, there is some cause to doubt,\r\nWill purge good manners and religion out.\r\n\r\n  Nor do the poor alone their liquor prize,\r\nThe sages join in this great sacrifice;\r\nThe learned men who study Aristotle,\r\nCorrect him with an explanation bottle:\r\nPraise Epicurus rather than Lysander,\r\nAnd Aristippus more than Alexander;\r\nThe doctors too their Galen here resign,\r\nAnd generally prescribe specific wine;\r\nThe graduate's study's grown an easy task,\r\nWhile for the urinal they toss the flask;\r\nThe surgeon's art grows plainer every hour,\r\nAnd wine's the balm which into wounds they pour.\r\n\r\n  Poets long since Parnassus have forsaken,\r\nAnd say the ancient bards were all mistaken.\r\nApollo's lately abdicate and fled,\r\nAnd good king Bacchus reigneth in his stead:\r\nHe does the chaos of the head refine,\r\nAnd atom thoughts jump into words by wine:\r\nThe inspiration's of a finer nature,\r\nAs wine must needs excel Parnassus water.\r\n\r\n  Statesmen their weighty politics refine,\r\nAnd soldiers raise their courages by wine.\r\nCecilia gives her choristers their choice,\r\nAnd lets them all drink wine to clear the voice.\r\n\r\n  Some think the clergy first found out the way,\r\nAnd wine's the only spirit by which they pray.\r\nBut others, less profane than so, agree,\r\nIt clears the lungs, and helps the memory:\r\nAnd, therefore, all of them divinely think,\r\nInstead of study, 'tis as well to drink.\r\n\r\n  And here I would be very glad to know,\r\nWhether our Asgilites may drink or no;\r\nThe enlightening fumes of wine would certainly\r\nAssist them much when they begin to fly;\r\nOr if a fiery chariot should appear,\r\nInflamed by wine, they'd have the less to fear.\r\n\r\n  Even the gods themselves, as mortals say,\r\nWere they on earth, would be as drunk as they:\r\nNectar would be no more celestial drink,\r\nThey'd all take wine, to teach them how to think.\r\nBut English drunkards, gods and men outdo,\r\nDrink their estates away, and senses too.\r\nColon's in debt, and if his friend should fail\r\nTo help him out, must die at last in jail:\r\nHis wealthy uncle sent a hundred nobles,\r\nTo pay his trifles off, and rid him of his troubles:\r\nBut Colon, like a true-born Englishman,\r\nDrunk all the money out in bright champaign,\r\nAnd Colon does in custody remain.\r\nDrunk'ness has been the darling of the realm,\r\nE'er since a drunken pilot had the helm.\r\n\r\n  In their religion, they're so uneven,\r\nThat each man goes his own byway to heaven.\r\nTenacious of mistakes to that degree,\r\nThat ev'ry man pursues it sep'rately,\r\nAnd fancies none can find the way but he:\r\nSo shy of one another they are grown,\r\nAs if they strove to get to heaven alone.\r\nRigid and zealous, positive and grave,\r\nAnd ev'ry grace, but charity, they have;\r\nThis makes them so ill-natured and uncivil,\r\nThat all men think an Englishman the devil.\r\n\r\n  Surly to strangers, froward to their friend,\r\nSubmit to love with a reluctant mind,\r\nResolved to be ungrateful and unkind.\r\nIf, by necessity, reduced to ask,\r\nThe giver has the difficultest task:\r\nFor what's bestow'd they awkwardly receive,\r\nAnd always take less freely than they give;\r\nThe obligation is their highest grief,\r\nThey never love where they accept relief;\r\nSo sullen in their sorrows, that 'tis known\r\nThey'll rather die than their afflictions own;\r\nAnd if relieved, it is too often true,\r\nThat they'll abuse their benefactors too;\r\nFor in distress their haughty stomach's such,\r\nThey hate to see themselves obliged too much;\r\nSeldom contented, often in the wrong,\r\nHard to be pleased at all, and never long.\r\n\r\n  If your mistakes there ill opinion gain,\r\nNo merit can their favour re-obtain:\r\nAnd if they're not vindictive in their fury,\r\n'Tis their inconstant temper does secure ye:\r\nTheir brain's so cool, their passion seldom burns;\r\nFor all's condensed before the flame returns:\r\nThe fermentation's of so weak a matter,\r\nThe humid damps the flame, and runs it all to water;\r\nSo though the inclination may be strong,\r\nThey're pleased by fits, and never angry long:\r\n\r\n  Then, if good-nature show some slender proof,\r\nThey never think they have reward enough;\r\nBut, like our modern Quakers of the town,\r\nExpect your manners, and return you none.\r\n\r\n  Friendship, th' abstracted union of the mind,\r\nWhich all men seek, but very few can find;\r\nOf all the nations in the universe,\r\nNone can talk on't more, or understand it less;\r\nFor if it does their property annoy,\r\nTheir property their friendship will destroy.\r\nAs you discourse them, you shall hear them tell\r\nAll things in which they think they do excel:\r\nNo panegyric needs their praise record,\r\nAn Englishman ne'er wants his own good word.\r\nHis first discourses gen'rally appear,\r\nPrologued with his own wond'rous character:\r\nWhen, to illustrate his own good name,\r\nHe never fails his neighbour to defame.\r\nAnd yet he really designs no wrong,\r\nHis malice goes no further than his tongue.\r\nBut, pleased to tattle, he delights to rail,\r\nTo satisfy the letch'ry of a tale.\r\nHis own dear praises close the ample speech,\r\nTells you how wise he is, that is, how rich:\r\nFor wealth is wisdom; he that's rich is wise;\r\nAnd all men learned poverty despise:\r\nHis generosity comes next, and then\r\nConcludes, that he's a true-born Englishman;\r\nAnd they, 'tis known, are generous and free,\r\nForgetting, and forgiving injury:\r\nWhich may be true, thus rightly understood,\r\nForgiving ill turns, and forgetting good.\r\n\r\n  Cheerful in labour when they've undertook it,\r\nBut out of humour, when they're out of pocket.\r\nBut if their belly and their pocket's full,\r\nThey may be phlegmatic, but never dull:\r\nAnd if a bottle does their brains refine,\r\nIt makes their wit as sparkling as their wine.\r\n\r\n  As for the general vices which we find,\r\nThey're guilty of in common with mankind,\r\nSatire forbear, and silently endure,\r\nWe must conceal the crimes we cannot cure;\r\nNor shall my verse the brighter sex defame,\r\nFor English beauty will preserve her name;\r\nBeyond dispute agreeable and fair,\r\nAnd modester than other nations are;\r\nFor where the vice prevails, the great temptation\r\nIs want of money more than inclination;\r\nIn general this only is allow'd,\r\nThey're something noisy, and a little proud.\r\n\r\n  An Englishman is gentlest in command,\r\nObedience is a stranger in the land:\r\nHardly subjected to the magistrate;\r\nFor Englishmen do all subjection hate.\r\nHumblest when rich, but peevish when they're poor,\r\nAnd think whate'er they have, they merit more.\r\n\r\n  The meanest English plowman studies law,\r\nAnd keeps thereby the magistrates in awe,\r\nWill boldly tell them what they ought to do,\r\nAnd sometimes punish their omissions too.\r\n\r\n  Their liberty and property's so dear,\r\nThey scorn their laws or governors to fear;\r\nSo bugbear'd with the name of slavery,\r\nThey can't submit to their own liberty.\r\nRestraint from ill is freedom to the wise!\r\nBut Englishmen do all restraint despise.\r\nSlaves to the liquor, drudges to the pots;\r\nThe mob are statesmen, and their statesmen sots.\r\n\r\n  Their governors, they count such dang'rous things,\r\nThat 'tis their custom to affront their kings:\r\nSo jealous of the power their kings possess'd,\r\nThey suffer neither power nor kings to rest.\r\nThe bad with force they eagerly subdue;\r\nThe good with constant clamours they pursue,\r\nAnd did King Jesus reign, they'd murmur too.\r\nA discontented nation, and by far\r\nHarder to rule in times of peace than war:\r\nEasily set together by the ears,\r\nAnd full of causeless jealousies and fears:\r\nApt to revolt, and willing to rebel,\r\nAnd never are contented when they're well.\r\nNo government could ever please them long,\r\nCould tie their hands, or rectify their tongue.\r\nIn this, to ancient Israel well compared,\r\nEternal murmurs are among them heard.\r\n\r\n  It was but lately, that they were oppress'd,\r\nTheir rights invaded, and their laws suppress'd:\r\nWhen nicely tender of their liberty,\r\nLord! what a noise they made of slavery.\r\nIn daily tumults show'd their discontent,\r\nLampoon'd their king, and mock'd his government.\r\nAnd if in arms they did not first appear,\r\n'Twas want of force, and not for want of fear.\r\nIn humbler tone than English used to do,\r\nAt foreign hands for foreign aid they sue.\r\n\r\n  William, the great successor of Nassau,\r\nTheir prayers heard, and their oppressions saw;\r\nHe saw and saved them: God and him they praised\r\nTo this their thanks, to that their trophies raised.\r\nBut glutted with their own felicities,\r\nThey soon their new deliverer despise;\r\nSay all their prayers back, their joy disown,\r\nUnsing their thanks, and pull their trophies down;\r\nTheir harps of praise are on the willows hung;\r\nFor Englishmen are ne'er contented long.\r\n\r\n  The reverend clergy too, and who'd ha' thought\r\nThat they who had such non-resistance taught,\r\nShould e'er to arms against their prince be brought\r\nWho up to heav'n did regal power advance;\r\nSubjecting English laws to modes of France\r\nTwisting religion so with loyalty,\r\nAs one could never live, and t'other die;\r\nAnd yet no sooner did their prince design\r\nTheir glebes and perquisites to undermine,\r\nBut all their passive doctrines laid aside,\r\nThe clergy their own principles denied;\r\nUnpreach'd their non-resisting cant, and pray'd\r\nTo heav'n for help, and to the Dutch for aid;\r\nThe church chimed all her doctrines back again,\r\nAnd pulpit-champions did the cause maintain;\r\nFlew in the face of all their former zeal,\r\nAnd non-resistance did at once repeal.\r\n\r\n  The Rabbi's say it would be too prolix,\r\nTo tie religion up to politics,\r\nThe churches' safety is _suprema lex_:\r\nAnd so by a new figure of their own,\r\nTheir former doctrines all at once disown;\r\nAs laws _post facto_ in the parliament,\r\nIn urgent cases have attained assent;\r\nBut are as dangerous precedents laid by,\r\nMade lawful only by necessity.\r\n\r\n  The rev'rend fathers then in arms appear,\r\nAnd men of God became the men of war:\r\nThe nation, fired by them, to arms apply,\r\nAssault their antichristian monarchy;\r\nTo their due channel all our laws restore,\r\nAnd made things what they should have been before.\r\nBut when they came to fill the vacant throne,\r\nAnd the pale priests look'd back on what they'd done,\r\nHow England liberty began to thrive,\r\nAnd Church of England loyality outlive;\r\nHow all their persecuting days were done,\r\nAnd their deliv'rer placed upon the throne:\r\nThe priests, as priests are wont to do, turn'd tail,\r\nThey're Englishmen, and nature will prevail;\r\nNow they deplore their ruins they have made,\r\nAnd murmur for the master they betray'd;\r\nExcuse those crimes they could not make him mend,\r\nAnd suffer for the cause they can't defend;\r\nPretend they'd not have carried things so high,\r\nAnd proto-martyrs make for popery.\r\n\r\n  Had the prince done as they design'd the thing,\r\nHigh set the clergy up to rule the king:\r\nTaken a donative for coming hither,\r\nAnd so have left their king and them together;\r\nWe had, say they, been now a happy nation;\r\nNo doubt we had seen a blessed reformation:\r\nFor wise men say 'tis as dangerous a thing,\r\nA ruling priesthood, as a priest-rid king;\r\nAnd of all plagues with which mankind are curst,\r\nEcclesiastic tyranny's the worst.\r\n\r\n  If all our former grievances were feign'd,\r\nKing James has been abused, and we trepann'd;\r\nBugbear'd with popery and power despotic,\r\nTyrannic government, and leagues exotic;\r\nThe revolution's a fanatic plot,\r\nWilliam's a tyrant, King James was not;\r\nA factious army and a poison'd nation,\r\nUnjustly forced King James's abdication.\r\n\r\n  But if he did the subjects' rights invade,\r\nThen he was punish'd only, not betrayed;\r\nAnd punishing of kings is no such crime,\r\nBut Englishmen have done it many a time.\r\n\r\n  When kings the sword of justice first lay down,\r\nThey are no kings, though they possess the crown.\r\nTitles are shadows, crowns are empty things,\r\nThe good of subjects is the end of kings;\r\nTo guide in war, and to protect in peace,\r\nWhere tyrants once commence the kings do cease;\r\nFor arbitrary power's so strange a thing,\r\nIt makes the tyrant and unmakes the king:\r\nIf kings by foreign priests and armies reign,\r\nAnd lawless power against their oaths maintain,\r\nThen subjects must have reason to complain:\r\nIf oaths must bind us when our kings do ill,\r\nTo call in foreign aid is to rebel:\r\nBy force to circumscribe our lawful prince,\r\nIs wilful treason in the largest sense:\r\nAnd they who once rebel, must certainly\r\nTheir God, and king, and former oaths defy;\r\nIf ye allow no mal-administration\r\nCould cancel the allegiance of the nation,\r\nLet all our learned sons of Levi try,\r\nThis ecclesiastic riddle to untie;\r\nHow they could make a step to call the prince,\r\nAnd yet pretend the oath and innocence.\r\n\r\n  By th' first address they made beyond the seas,\r\nThey're perjur'd in the most intense degrees;\r\nAnd without scruple for the time to come,\r\nMay swear to all the kings in Christendom:\r\nNay, truly did our kings consider all,\r\nThey'd never let the clergy swear at all,\r\nTheir politic allegiance they'd refuse,\r\nFor whores and priests do never want excuse.\r\n\r\n  But if the mutual contract was dissolved,\r\nThe doubt's explain'd, the difficulty solved;\r\nThat kings, when they descend to tyranny,\r\nDissolve the bond, and leave the subject free;\r\nThe government's ungirt when justice dies,\r\nAnd constitutions are nonentities.\r\nThe nation's all a mob, there's no such thing,\r\nAs lords, or commons, parliament, or king;\r\nA great promiscuous crowd the Hydra lies,\r\nTill laws revive and mutual contract ties;\r\nA chaos free to choose for their own share,\r\nWhat case of government they please to wear;\r\nIf to a king they do the reins commit,\r\nAll men are bound in conscience to submit;\r\nBut then the king must by his oath assent,\r\nTo _Postulata's_ of the government;\r\nWhich if he breaks he cuts off the entail,\r\nAnd power retreats to its original.\r\n\r\n  This doctrine has the sanction of assent\r\nFrom nature's universal Parliament:\r\nThe voice of nations, and the course of things,\r\nAllow that laws superior are to kings;\r\nNone but delinquents would have justice cease,\r\nKnaves rail at laws, as soldiers rail at peace:\r\nFor justice is the end of government,\r\nAs reason is the test of argument:\r\nNo man was ever yet so void of sense,\r\nAs to debate the right of self-defence;\r\nA principle so grafted in the mind,\r\nWith nature born, and does like nature bind;\r\nTwisted with reason, and with nature too,\r\nAs neither one nor t'other can undo.\r\n\r\n  Nor can this right be less when national,\r\nReason which governs one should govern all;\r\nWhate'er the dialect of courts may tell,\r\nHe that his right demands can ne'er rebel;\r\nWhich right, if 'tis by governors denied,\r\nMay be procured by force or foreign aid;\r\nFor tyranny's a nation's term of grief,\r\nAs folks cry fire to hasten in relief;\r\nAnd when the hated word is heard about,\r\nAll men should come to help the people out.\r\n\r\n  Thus England groan'd, Britannia's voice was heard,\r\nAnd great Nassau to rescue her appear'd:\r\nCall'd by the universal voice of fate,\r\nGod and the people's legal magistrate:\r\nYe heavens regard! Almighty Jove look down,\r\nAnd view thy injured monarch on the throne;\r\nOn their ungrateful heads due vengeance take\r\nWho sought his aid, and then his part forsake:\r\nWitness, ye powers! it was our call alone,\r\nWhich now our pride makes us ashamed to own;\r\nBritannia's troubles fetch'd him from afar,\r\nTo court the dreadful casualties of war;\r\nBut where requital never can be made,\r\nAcknowledgment's a tribute seldom paid.\r\n\r\n  He dwelt in bright Maria's circling arms,\r\nDefended by the magic of her charms,\r\nFrom foreign fears and from domestic harms;\r\nAmbition found no fuel for her fire,\r\nHe had what God could give or man desire,\r\nTill pity roused him from his soft repose,\r\nHis life to unseen hazards to expose;\r\nTill pity moved him in our cause to appear,\r\nPity! that word which now we hate to hear;\r\nBut English gratitude is always such,\r\nTo hate the hand that does oblige too much.\r\n\r\n  Britannia's cries gave birth to his intent,\r\nAnd hardly gain'd his unforeseen assent;\r\nHis boding thoughts foretold him he should find\r\nThe people fickle, selfish, and unkind;\r\nWhich thought did to his royal heart appear\r\nMore dreadful than the dangers of the war;\r\nFor nothing grates a generous mind so soon,\r\nAs base returns for hearty service done.\r\n\r\n  Satire, be silent! awfully prepare\r\nBritannia's song, and William's praise to hear;\r\nStand by, and let her cheerfully rehearse\r\nHer grateful vows in her immortal verse.\r\nLoud fame's eternal trumpet let her sound,\r\nListen, ye distant poles, and endless round,\r\nMay the strong blast the welcome news convey,\r\nAs far as sound can reach or spirit fly!\r\nTo neighb'ring worlds, if such there be, relate\r\nOur heroes fame for theirs to imitate;\r\nTo distant worlds of spirits let her rehearse,\r\nFor spirits without the helps of voice converse:\r\nMay angels hear the gladsome news on high,\r\nMix'd with their everlasting symphony;\r\nAnd hell itself stand in surprise to know,\r\nWhether it be the fatal blast or no.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITANNIA.\r\n\r\n  The fame of virtue 'tis for which I sound,\r\nAnd heroes with immortal triumphs crown'd;\r\nFame built on solid virtue swifter flies,\r\nThan morning light can spread the eastern skies:\r\nThe gath'ring air returns the doubling sound;\r\nAnd loud repeating thunders force it round;\r\nEchoes return from caverns of the deep,\r\nOld Chaos dreams on't in eternal sleep:\r\nTime hands it forward to its latest urn,\r\nFrom whence it never, never shall return:\r\nNothing is heard so far, or lasts so long,\r\n'Tis heard by ev'ry ear, and spoke by every tongue.\r\n\r\n  My hero, with the sails of honour furl'd,\r\nRises like the great genius of the world;\r\nBy fate and fame wisely prepared to be\r\nThe soul of war and life of victory;\r\nHe spreads the wings of virtue on the throne,\r\nAnd ev'ry wind of glory fans them on;\r\nImmortal trophies dwell upon his brow,\r\nFresh as the garlands he has won but now.\r\n\r\n  By different steps the high ascent he gains,\r\nAnd differently that high ascent maintains:\r\nPrinces for pride and lust of rule make war,\r\nAnd struggle for the name of conqueror;\r\nSome fight for fame, and some for victory,\r\nHe fights to save, and conquers to set free.\r\n\r\n  Then seek no phrase his titles to conceal,\r\nAnd hide with words what actions must reveal;\r\nNo parallel from Hebrew stories take,\r\nOf godlike kings my similies to make;\r\nNo borrowed names conceal my living theme,\r\nBut names and things directly I proclaim;\r\nHis honest merit does his glory raise,\r\nWhom that exalts let no man fear to praise;\r\nOf such a subject no man need be shy,\r\nVirtue's above the reach of flattery;\r\nHe needs no character but his own fame,\r\nNor any flattering titles but his own name.\r\n\r\n  William's the name that's spoke by every tongue,\r\nWilliam's the darling subject of my song;\r\nListen, ye virgins, to the charming sound,\r\nAnd in eternal dances hand it round;\r\nYour early offerings to this altar bring,\r\nMake him at once a lover and a king;\r\nMay he submit to none but to your arms,\r\nNor ever be subdued, but by your charms;\r\nMay your soft thoughts for him be all sublime,\r\nAnd ev'ry tender vow be made for him;\r\nMay he be first in ev'ry morning thought,\r\nAnd heav'n ne'er hear a prayer where he's left out;\r\nMay every omen, every boding dream,\r\nBe fortunate by mentioning his name;\r\nMay this one charm infernal powers affright,\r\nAnd guard you from the terror of the night;\r\nMay ev'ry cheerful glass as it goes down\r\nTo William's health, be cordials to your own:\r\nLet ev'ry song be chorust with his name,\r\nAnd music pay her tribute to his fame;\r\nLet ev'ry poet tune his artful verse,\r\nAnd in immortal strains his deeds rehearse:\r\nAnd may Apollo never more inspire\r\nThe disobedient bard with his seraphic fire\r\nMay all my sons their grateful homage pay,\r\nHis praises sing, and for his safety pray.\r\n\r\n  Satire, return to our unthankful isle,\r\nSecured by heaven's regards, and William's toil:\r\nTo both ungrateful, and to both untrue,\r\nRebels to God, and to good nature too.\r\n\r\n  If e'er this nation be distress'd again,\r\nTo whomsoe'er they cry, they'll cry in vain;\r\nTo heav'n they cannot have the face to look,\r\nOr, if they should, it would but heav'n provoke;\r\nTo hope for help from man would be too much,\r\nMankind would always tell 'em of the Dutch:\r\nHow they came here our freedoms to maintain,\r\nWere paid, and cursed, and hurried home again;\r\nHow by their aid we first dissolved our fears,\r\nAnd then our helpers damn'd for foreigners:\r\n'Tis not our English temper to do better,\r\nFor Englishmen think ev'ry one their debtor.\r\n\r\n  'Tis worth observing, that we ne'er complain'd\r\nOf foreigners, nor of the wealth we gain'd,\r\nTill all their services were at an end:\r\nWise men affirm it is the English way,\r\nNever to grumble till they come to pay;\r\nAnd then they always think, their temper's such,\r\nThe work too little, and the pay too much.\r\n\r\n  As frighted patients, when they want a cure,\r\nBid any price, and any pain endure:\r\nBut when the doctor's remedies appear,\r\nThe cure's too easy, and the price too dear:\r\nGreat Portland near was banter'd when he strove,\r\nFor us his master's kindest thoughts to move:\r\nWe ne'er lampoon'd his conduct, when employ'd\r\nKing James's secret councils to divide:\r\nThen we caress'd him as the only man,\r\nWho could the doubtful oracle explain;\r\nThe only Hushai, able to repel\r\nThe dark designs of our Achitophel:\r\nCompared his master's courage to his sense,\r\nThe ablest statesman, and the bravest prince;\r\nOn his wise conduct we depended much,\r\nAnd liked him ne'er the worse for being Dutch:\r\nNor was he valued more than he deserved,\r\nFreely he ventured, faithfully he served;\r\nIn all King William's dangers he has shared,\r\nIn England's quarrels always he appear'd:\r\nThe revolution first, and then the Boyne,\r\nIn both, his counsels and his conduct shine;\r\nHis martial valour Flanders will confess,\r\nAnd France regrets his managing the peace;\r\nFaithful to England's interest and her king,\r\nThe greatest reason of our murmuring:\r\nTen years in English service he appear'd,\r\nAnd gain'd his master's and the world's regard;\r\nBut 'tis not England's custom to reward,\r\nThe wars are over, England needs him not;\r\nNow he's a Dutchman, and the Lord knows what.\r\n\r\n  Schonbergh, the ablest soldier of his age,\r\nWith great Nassau did in our cause engage;\r\nBoth join'd for England's rescue and defence,\r\nThe greatest captain and the greatest prince;\r\nWith what applause his stories did we tell,\r\nStories which Europe's volumes largely swell!\r\nWe counted him an army in our aid,\r\nWhere he commanded, no man was afraid;\r\nHis actions with a constant conquest shine,\r\nFrom Villa Vitiosa to the Rhine;\r\nFrance, Flanders, Germany, his fame confess,\r\nAnd all the world was fond of him but us:\r\nOur turn first served, we grudged him the command,\r\nWitness the grateful temper of the land.\r\n\r\n   We blame the King, that he relies too much,\r\nOn Strangers, Germans, Hugonots, and Dutch;\r\nAnd seldom does his great affairs of state,\r\nTo English counsellors communicate:\r\nThe fact might very well be answer'd thus:\r\nHe had so often been betray'd by us,\r\nHe must have been a madman to rely,\r\nOn English gentlemen's fidelity;\r\nFor, laying other argument aside:\r\nThis thought might mortify our English pride;\r\nThat foreigners have faithfully obey'd him,\r\nAnd none but Englishmen have e'er betray'd him:\r\nThey have our ships and merchants bought and sold,\r\nAnd barter'd English blood for foreign gold;\r\nFirst to the French they sold our Turkey fleet,\r\nAnd injured Talmarsh next at Cameret;\r\nThe king himself is shelter'd from their snares,\r\nNot by his merits, but the crown he wears;\r\nExperience tells us 'tis the English way,\r\nTheir benefactors always to betray.\r\n\r\n   And, lest examples should be too remote,\r\nA modern magistrate of famous note,\r\nShall give you his own history by rote;\r\nI'll make it out, deny it he that can,\r\nHis worship is a true-born Englishman;\r\nBy all the latitude that empty word,\r\nBy modern acceptation's understood:\r\nThe parish books his great descent record,\r\nAnd now he hopes ere long to be a lord;\r\nAnd truly, as things go, it would be pity,\r\nBut such as he bore office in the city;\r\nWhile robb'ry for burnt-offering he brings,\r\nAnd gives to God what he has stole from kings;\r\nGreat monuments of charity he raises,\r\nAnd good St. Magnus whistles out his praises;\r\nTo city jails he grants a jubilee,\r\nAnd hires huzza's from his own mobile.\r\n\r\n  Lately he wore the golden chain and gown,\r\nWith which equipp'd he thus harangued the town.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FINE SPEECH, &c.\r\n\r\n  With clouted iron shoes, and sheep-skin breeches,\r\nMore rags than manners, and more dirt than riches,\r\nFrom driving cows and calves to Leyton market,\r\nWhile of my greatness there appear'd no spark yet,\r\nBehold I come to let you see the pride,\r\nWith which exalted beggars always ride.\r\n\r\n   Born to the needful labours of the plough,\r\nThe cart-whip graced me, as the chain does now.\r\nNature and fate in doubt what course to take,\r\nWhether I should a lord or plough-boy make;\r\nKindly at last resolv'd they would promote me,\r\nAnd first a knave, and then a knight they vote me.\r\nWhat fate appointed, nature did prepare,\r\nAnd furnish'd me with an exceeding care,\r\nTo fit me for what they design'd to have me;\r\nAnd every gift but honesty they gave me.\r\n\r\n  And thus equipp'd, to this proud town I came,\r\nIn quest of bread, and not in quest of fame.\r\nBlind to my future fate, an humble boy,\r\nFree from the guilt and glory I enjoy.\r\nThe hopes which my ambition entertain'd,\r\nWhere in the name of foot-boy, all contain'd.\r\nThe greatest heights from small beginnings rise;\r\nThe gods were great on earth, before they reach'd the skies.\r\n\r\n  Backwell, the generous temper of whose mind,\r\nWas always to be bountiful inclin'd:\r\nWhether by his ill fate or fancy led,\r\nFirst took me up, and furnish'd me with bread:\r\nThe little services he put me to,\r\nSeem'd labours, rather than were truly so.\r\nBut always my advancement he design'd;\r\nFor 'twas his very nature to be kind:\r\nLarge was his soul, his temper ever free;\r\nThe best of masters and of men to me:\r\nAnd I who was before decreed by fate,\r\nTo be made infamous as well as great,\r\nWith an obsequious diligence obey'd him,\r\nTill trusted with his all, and then betray'd him.\r\n\r\n  All his past kindnesses I trampled on,\r\nRuin'd his fortunes to erect my own:\r\nSo vipers in the bosom bred begin,\r\nTo hiss at that hand first which took them in;\r\nWith eager treach'ry I his fall pursu'd,\r\nAnd my first trophies were ingratitude.\r\n\r\n  Ingratitude's the worst of human guilt,\r\nThe basest action mankind can commit;\r\nWhich, like the sin against the Holy Ghost,\r\nHas least of honour, and of guilt the most;\r\nDistinguished from all other crimes by this,\r\nThat 'tis a crime which no man will confess;\r\nThat sin alone, which should not be forgiv'n\r\nOn earth, altho' perhaps it may in heaven.\r\n\r\n  Thus my first benefactor I o'erthrew;\r\nAnd how shou'd I be to a second true?\r\nThe public trust came next into my care,\r\nAnd I to use them scurvily prepare:\r\nMy needy sov'reign lord I play'd upon,\r\nAnd lent him many a thousand of his own;\r\nFor which great interest I took care to charge,\r\nAnd so my ill-got wealth became so large.\r\n\r\n  My predecessor Judas was a fool,\r\nFitter to have been whipt and sent to school,\r\nThan sell a Saviour: had I been at hand,\r\nHis Master had not been so cheap trepann'd;\r\nI would have made the eager Jews have found,\r\nFor thirty pieces, thirty thousand pound.\r\n\r\n  My cousin Ziba, of immortal fame,\r\n(Ziba and I shall never want a name:)\r\nFirst-born of treason, nobly did advance\r\nHis Master's fall, for his inheritance:\r\nBy whose keen arts old David first began\r\nTo break his sacred oath to Jonathan:\r\nThe good old king 'tis thought was very loth\r\nTo break his word, and therefore broke his oath.\r\nZiba's a traitor of some quality,\r\nYet Ziba might have been inform'd by me:\r\nHad I been there, he ne'er had been content\r\nWith half th' estate, nor half the government.\r\n\r\n  In our late revolution 'twas thought strange,\r\nThat I of all mankind should like the change,\r\nBut they who wonder'd at it never knew,\r\nThat in it I did my old game pursue:\r\nNor had they heard of twenty thousand pound,\r\nWhich ne'er was lost, yet never could be found.\r\n\r\n  Thus all things in their turn to sale I bring,\r\nGod and my master first, and then the king;\r\nTill by successful villanies made bold,\r\nI thought to turn the nation into gold;\r\nAnd so to forgery my hand I bent,\r\nNot doubting I could gull the Government;\r\nBut there was ruffl'd by the Parliament.\r\nAnd if I 'scaped th' unhappy tree to climb,\r\n'Twas want of law, and not for want of crime;\r\n\r\n  But my old friend,[A] who printed in my face\r\nA needful competence of English brass;\r\nHaving more business yet for me to do,\r\nAnd loth to lose his trusty servant so,\r\nManaged the matter with such art and skill,\r\nAs sav'd his hero, and threw out the Bill.\r\n\r\n  And now I'm grac'd with unexpected honours,\r\nFor which I'll certainly abuse the donors:\r\nKnighted, and made a tribune of the people,\r\nWhose laws and properties I'm like to keep well:\r\nThe custos rotulorum of the city,\r\nAnd captain of the guards of their banditti.\r\nSurrounded by my catchpoles, I declare\r\nAgainst the needy debtor open war.\r\nI hang poor thieves for stealing of your pelf,\r\nAnd suffer none to rob you, but myself.\r\n\r\n  The king commanded me to help reform ye,\r\nAnd how I'll do't, Miss ---- shall inform ye.\r\nI keep the best seraglio in the nation,\r\nAnd hope in time to bring it into fashion;\r\nNo brimstone whore need fear the lash from me,\r\nThat part I'll leave to Brother Jefferey:\r\nOur gallants need not go abroad to Rome,\r\nI'll keep a whoring jubilee at home;\r\nWhoring's the darling of my inclination;\r\nAn't I a magistrate for reformation?\r\nFor this my praise is sung by ev'ry bard,\r\nFor which Bridewell wou'd be a just reward.\r\nIn print my panegyric fills the street,\r\nAnd hired gaol-birds their huzzas repeat;\r\nSome charities contriv'd to make a show,\r\nHave taught the needy rabble to do so;\r\nWhose empty noise is a mechanic fame,\r\nSince for Sir Beelzebub they'd do the same.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Devil.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n  Then let us boast of ancestors no more,\r\nOr deeds of heroes done in days of yore,\r\nIn latent records of the ages past,\r\nBehind the rear of time, in long oblivion plac'd;\r\nFor if our virtues must in lines descend,\r\nThe merit with the families would end,\r\nAnd intermixtures would most fatal grow;\r\nFor vice would be hereditary too;\r\nThe tainted blood would of necessity,\r\nInvoluntary wickedness convey.\r\n\r\n  Vice, like ill-nature, for an age or two,\r\nMay seem a generation to pursue;\r\nBut virtue seldom does regard the breed,\r\nFools do the wise, and wise men fools succeed.\r\n\r\n  What is't to us, what ancestors we had?\r\nIf good, what better? or what worse, if bad?\r\nExamples are for imitation set,\r\nYet all men follow virtue with regret.\r\n\r\n  Could but our ancestors retrieve their fate,\r\nAnd see their offspring thus degenerate;\r\nHow we contend for birth and names unknown,\r\nAnd build on their past actions, not our own;\r\nThey'd cancel records, and their tombs deface,\r\nAnd openly disown the vile degenerate race:\r\nFor fame of families is all a cheat,\r\nIt's personal virtue only makes us great.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The True-Born Englishman, by Daniel Defoe",
