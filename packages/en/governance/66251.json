R. Knickerbocker way back in 1927 or thereabouts. Those were\r\nthe good old days. They were the days of the Long Armistice. No one\r\nhad ever heard of the Rome-Berlin Axis, Stuka dive bombers, or the\r\nHaushofer Plan. Mr. Roosevelt was out of politics, Mr. Churchill was\r\na chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Lindbergh had just flown the\r\nAtlantic. We talked of such neolithic creatures as Pilsudski of Poland\r\nand Alexander of Jugoslavia, and most of us thought that Hitler was a\r\nbad Austrian joke, more or less. Those were the good old days. Even so,\r\nthunderheads were gathering.\r\n\r\nI first met Mr. Knickerbocker in Berlin. This was fitting, since\r\nBerlin was his bailiwick. We all had bailiwicks in those days. Duranty\r\nwas in Moscow, Raymond Swing was in London, and Dorothy Thompson had\r\njust left Berlin. I was bouncing all over the place. I didn’t have my\r\nbailiwick yet. We were all very good friends. We formed a kind of fluid\r\ninternational community. We were buzzards in every foreign office, and\r\nkings on every wagon-lit.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t meet often, since we lived in different cities, and it took\r\nsomething of a catastrophe to bring us all together. When we did meet,\r\nthe vault of heaven shook. I remember days--and nights--in Geneva,\r\nBucharest, Cairo, Helsingfors. I think of Sheean, the Mowrers, Webb\r\nMiller, Shirer, Jay Allen, Fodor, Whitaker, and many more. Don’t let me\r\nsound nostalgic. I am thinking merely that we have all grown up. We are\r\nnot cameras any longer.\r\n\r\nThis foreword is not about Mr. Knickerbocker’s book. Let that speak\r\nfor itself. Knick is the most pertinacious, plausible, and inquisitive\r\nquestion-asker I ever met. In this book he answers questions instead\r\nof asking them. I like to see the tables turned. I don’t know that I\r\nagree with all his answers. But let him answer them.\r\n\r\nThis foreword is about Mr. Knickerbocker himself. His flaming red\r\nhair, his flaming red personality (I mean “red” chromatically, not\r\npolitically) are famous on four continents. He needs no introduction.\r\nBut certain nuggets of memory stay fixed in mind. I remember the time\r\nhe fed me caviar inside a baked potato, at Horcher’s in Berlin, and\r\nI remember the time I fed him a dinner in London that, deliberately,\r\nwe planned so that it would cost exactly five pounds. I remember the\r\ntime that he took me to hear Putzi Hanfstaengl hammer out a tornado\r\nof Wagner in the Hotel Kaiserhof, and I remember the time I took him\r\nacross the freezing Danube, on the way to Sofia, in what was supposed\r\nto be a rowboat. I remember week-ends on the Semmering, bad oysters\r\nin Madrid, evenings in the Café Royal, drinks in Rome, Budapest, and\r\npoints beyond.\r\n\r\nKnick’s career has been spectacular in more than one dimension. He\r\nonce set out to fly the Atlantic, as a passenger in a German plane,\r\nlong before the Lindbergh flight; he was the only correspondent during\r\nthe Ethiopian war to glimpse the front from the air; he has had more\r\ninterviews with European heads of state, I imagine, than any other\r\nnewspaper man alive.\r\n\r\nMr. Knickerbocker was born in Texas in 1898. He went to Europe in\r\n1923, and, a student of psychiatry at the University of Munich, walked\r\nstraight into Hitler’s Beerhall Putsch. He studied briefly in Vienna,\r\nand then got a job in Berlin on the _New York Evening Post-Philadelphia\r\nPublic Ledger_ foreign service. Since then his career has been a\r\ncalendar of most of the great events of our time. He spent two years in\r\nMoscow as correspondent for the International News Service (this was in\r\n1924-26, when Trotsky was declining and the N.E.P. expanding), and in\r\n1928 took over Dorothy Thompson’s job as chief correspondent in Berlin\r\nfor the _Public Ledger_. He won a Pulitzer prize for distinguished\r\nforeign correspondence--a series of articles on Russia’s Five Year\r\nPlan, but for almost ten years Berlin was the blazing focus of his life.\r\n\r\nMeantime there were trips to take. In 1933 he travelled all over Europe\r\nfor a series, “Will War Come in Europe?” for I.N.S. He saw the death\r\nof Dollfuss in Vienna, and the burial of Hindenburg in Germany. He met\r\nMussolini, Masaryk, King Alexander, King Boris, Otto Habsburg, and\r\nhosts of others. He did one series of articles on Russia and the Baltic\r\nstates, comparing living standards under communism and capitalism, and\r\nanother surveying economic aspects of the Europe that was crumbling.\r\nCame the war in Ethiopia in 1935, which he covered on Haile Selassie’s\r\nside. I will never forget the agitated days in London when Knick was\r\naccumulating the vast equipment he took along. In 1936 came the Spanish\r\ncivil war, and the next year the war in China. He saw bombings all\r\nthe way from Toledo to Nanking. He returned to Europe to cover the\r\nAnschluss crisis and the Munich disaster; then he dipped briefly into\r\nSouth America, and reached Peru. Then Europe called again; he saw the\r\nbeginning of World War II in London and France, and in 1940 accompanied\r\nthe French armies till they collapsed, and then saw the battle of\r\nBritain at its fiercest climax, in September.\r\n\r\nBut let me go back to those days in Berlin. The main point I want to\r\nmake has to do with Knickerbocker in Berlin. During the turbulent\r\n1930’s he was much more than a journalist covering Germany; he was a\r\ndefinite public character in German political life. After Hindenburg\r\nand Hitler, he was practically the best known man in the country. His\r\n_réclame_ was fabulous, personally and politically. Everyone knew the\r\nlithe, active, red-haired Herr Knickerbocker (pronounce the K, please).\r\nOnce a musical comedy was named for him--supreme tribute!\r\n\r\nPartly this was because he published half a dozen books in German,\r\ncompiled from the long newspaper articles he wrote, which appeared\r\nserially in the _Vossische Zeitung_ or the _Berliner Tageblatt_. The\r\nbooks were extraordinarily successful in Germany; they introduced\r\nGerman readers to a new type of American journalism. Among them were\r\n_Der Rote Handel Droht!_, _Der Rote Handel Lockt!_, _Kommt Europe\r\nWieder Hoch?_, _Rote Wirtschaft und Weisse Wohlstand!_, _England’s\r\nWirtschaft und Schwarzhemden!_, _Deutschland So oder So!_, and _Kommt\r\nKrieg in Europa?_\r\n\r\nKnick knew practically every human being of consequence in Germany. He\r\nexplored the country from top to bottom. He talked to Hitler, Spengler,\r\nBrüning, Goering, Goebbels. Then Hitler came to power. At the time\r\nKnickerbocker was in the middle of a German lecture tour that had begun\r\nin the Lessing Hochschule in Berlin. Knick watched the Nazi revolution\r\ncrushingly obliterate all opposition. He wrote a series exposing the\r\nBrown Terror that caused violent comment in New York as well as Berlin.\r\nPresently he was excluded from the country. There are hate affairs as\r\nwell as love affairs. The hate affair between Hitler and Knickerbocker\r\nis one of the most torrid in political history.\r\n\r\nBut this should not detract from the main point, which is that Knick\r\nknows the real Germany, loves it, and respects it. He is a Nazi-hater,\r\nbut not a German-hater. His authority on the subject is authentic and\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n  _John Gunther_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as winning a fight without passion. France went\r\nto war apologetically; France fought the war without music, and so\r\nFrance lost. Britain went to war apologetically, but Britain had the\r\ninestimable advantage of being bombed, and today for the first time\r\nin 100 years Britain is angry and is fighting as she has never fought\r\nbefore. We, the United States, are today apologetic, so sorry that it\r\nseems we after all are called upon to fight, and some of us still say\r\nwe should not fight, and others say we must fight only with aviators\r\nand sailors, and never with infantrymen, and very few indeed are the\r\nstrains of martial music throughout the land. From all sides we are\r\ncalled upon to restrain our emotions, and it is said that the cool head\r\nis the shrewd head, and that is correct, of course, but a cool head\r\nwithout a hot heart is useless on a battlefield. Without anger there\r\ncan be no victory and useful anger is based upon understanding. Unless\r\nthe American people can be brought to understand that our national\r\nexistence and our individual security are today in peril, and unless\r\nthe American people become angry at the enemy, we shall become a part\r\nof Hitler’s Reich.\r\n\r\nHistory may eventually record that Britain was saved by the bombs\r\nHitler has rained upon her since the fall of France. Unless they\r\nannihilate the British, these bombs will have fulfilled a function\r\nHitler never imagined. He thought they would terrorize the British into\r\nsurrender; instead the bombs aroused a resistance such as no other\r\npopulation has ever shown, for the prolonged punishment of Britain’s\r\ncities has been worse than anything we know of elsewhere, including\r\nBelgrade, Warsaw, Rotterdam, Madrid, Barcelona, or Chungking. The\r\nBritish required this experience to awaken them. They had been at war\r\neight months when the Germans finally attacked in the West, but they\r\nhad not given up the grand old British custom of the Friday to Tuesday\r\nweek end. It took the German break-through on the Meuse, and then the\r\nGerman bombs on London, to shock every inhabitant of the British Isles\r\ninto the realization that they faced death for their nation and death\r\nor slavery for themselves unless they fought with a ferocity even\r\ngreater than that of their jungle enemies.\r\n\r\nWe are today as sound asleep as the British were before May 1940.\r\nWe are as sound asleep as the French were before they saw their\r\nfortifications fall and their army of 4,500,000 soldiers with the\r\ntradition of Napoleon dissolve between May 10 and June 17, in five\r\nweeks of the greatest military debacle of all time. We have had no\r\nbombs on America, and presumably shall not have them until it is time\r\nto trek for the Rocky Mountains. A sober American patriot remarked,\r\n“How fortunate Britain has been to have had the bombs to arouse her\r\nmartial spirit before it was too late. If Hitler were to have a lapse\r\nin judgment and send just half a dozen bombers over New York, and drop\r\njust half a dozen bombs, it might be the salvation of America.” But\r\nHitler will do no such thing. He is glad to accommodate those Americans\r\nwho refuse to believe they are threatened until they are physically\r\nattacked. When and if the Germans break through upon America we shall\r\nawake to find ourselves alone, cut off, surrounded, outnumbered,\r\noutgunned, and outlawed amid a world of enemies.\r\n\r\nA few of us, chiefly correspondents formerly in Germany, have been\r\ntrying to do duty for German bombs on America, and for the German\r\nbreak-through. We have been called alarmists. For years the world of\r\ninternational observers was divided into two groups: the one composed\r\nof nearly everybody on earth outside of Germany, who understood nothing\r\nof the true character of Hitler’s Third Reich; and the second tiny\r\ngroup, small enough to be contained within a lecture hall, composed\r\nof correspondents, diplomats, and a few businessmen who had firsthand\r\nknowledge of what the Nazis mean. Today a good many persons without\r\nthis intimate knowledge of Nazi Germany have been able to decide for\r\nthemselves about the character of a regime which has overrun fifteen\r\ncountries in three years, but the danger to America still looks very\r\nremote and impersonal to millions of patriotic citizens. I have been\r\ntalking to about 100,000 of these citizens, during a lecture series.\r\n\r\nMy thesis was in brief: That the United States should be in a state of\r\nformal, shooting war with Germany as speedily as possible because only\r\nby this means can we make the world safe for America; and that we must\r\nrealize that after going to war we have only begun a task which may\r\nlast for many years and one which we can fulfill only by learning to\r\nfight with even more fervor than the demoniac Nazi shock troops, and by\r\ngreater national self-sacrifice than we have ever been called upon to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nOn this thesis I was asked around 3,000 questions during the question\r\nperiod following the lectures. For this book I have chosen around\r\n200 as representative of what the American people are thinking. I\r\nhave arranged the questions in categories and have added many recent\r\nones to bring the Forum up to date. Eager, painful, almost agonizing\r\nconcern for the future of America was the background of these queries\r\nfrom audiences in 128 communities, including two-thirds of all cities\r\nof more than 100,000 population and scores of towns and villages. The\r\npeople with whom I talked ranged from millionaire winter tourists\r\nin Florida to coal miners in Pennsylvania, applegrowers in Yakima,\r\noilmen in Oklahoma, college boys in the Great Lakes states, farmers\r\nin the Midwest, workers, bankers, club ladies, teachers, cowhands,\r\nCatholics, Jews, Protestants, atheists, Yankees, Southerners, Texans,\r\nWesterners--Americans.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that these earnest Americans, representing through\r\ntheir family and friendly connections at least ten times their number,\r\nor more than 1,000,000 persons, are far in advance of the President’s\r\nmoves toward active defense, just as the President has always been far\r\nahead of the Congress. They wanted action even before the President\r\noffered it. Among 3,000 questioners there were not more than six openly\r\nhostile hecklers from the floor. Would it be too hopeful to say that\r\nAmerica is 2,994 to 6 in favor of liberty?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Have you ever met Hitler?_\r\n\r\nA. Many times. From 1923 until today I have watched and studied him\r\nand a good part of that time I was close enough to have opportunities\r\nfor firsthand observation. I first heard him speak in August 1923, not\r\nlong before his unsuccessful attempt to seize power, in the famous\r\nBeer Hall Putsch, and then I witnessed the Putsch, and reported his\r\ntrial with Ludendorff for treason. He was released from Landsberg\r\nPrison in December 1924 where he had been held in comfortable “fortress\r\nconfinement” just long enough for him to have time conveniently to\r\nwrite _Mein Kampf_. I interviewed him for the first time in the Brown\r\nHouse in Munich in 1932. Thereafter I had a series of interviews with\r\nhim, and was present at many of the great moments of his career.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What impression does he make when you meet him?_\r\n\r\nA. The first impression he makes upon any non-German is that he looks\r\nsilly. Not to a German, mind you, and I suppose he did not look silly\r\nto any of those heads of European states who crawled to Berchtesgaden\r\nto get their orders. But to a foreigner not subject to his commands he\r\ncertainly looks silly. I know that is a strong word to use about a man\r\nwho has already conquered a continent but it fits.\r\n\r\nI remember well the first time I ever laid eyes on him, in August\r\n1923, when he was speaking at the Zirkus Krone in Munich--I broke out\r\nlaughing. Even if you had never heard of him you would be bound to\r\nsay, “He looks like a caricature of himself.” The moustache and the\r\nlock of hair over the forehead help this look, but chiefly it is the\r\nexpression of his face, and especially the blank stare of his eyes,\r\nand the foolish set of his mouth in repose. Sometimes he looks like a\r\nman who ought to go around with his mouth open, chin hanging in the\r\nstyle of a surprised farm hand. Other times he clamps his lips together\r\nso tightly and juts out his jaw with such determination that again he\r\nlooks silly, as though he were putting on an act.\r\n\r\nIndeed Hitler is, more than anything else, an actor. He will go on\r\nbeing one the rest of his life, a great actor who in his role as tyrant\r\nconqueror will have affected the destinies of more millions of people\r\nthan any other human being in history, but an actor to the last, a\r\ntragedian whom no one would take seriously until he began shooting at\r\nhis audience. Even in the midst of his triumphs he manages to look\r\nsilly to any outsider capable for the moment of detaching himself from\r\nhorrified contemplation of the fate inflicted upon his victims.\r\n\r\nI remember watching him roll down the Ringstrasse in Vienna standing\r\nbeside the chauffeur in a cream-colored Mercedes car, with his arm\r\noutstretched in the stiff salute he affects on such occasions, the\r\nhand rigidly held at a slight angle downward. It was the moment of\r\nhis conquest of Austria. The streets were crowded with half a million\r\npeople, a few cheering sincerely, many cheering out of fear, and\r\nhundreds of thousands grim-faced, weeping inwardly.\r\n\r\nAt that moment when I, too, felt like weeping at the abasement of the\r\ncity where I had worked and danced and studied and played when I first\r\ncame to Europe fifteen years before, even at such a moment I found\r\nmyself smiling and saying to friends looking out the window of my room\r\nin the Hotel Bristol, “Doesn’t he look silly?” That oversized cap of\r\nhis, the military cap with the too-large crown and the visor which\r\ncompletely hides his low forehead!\r\n\r\nThere is something absurd even about his stance as he rides his\r\nvictorious chariot through freshly conquered cities. He is softly fat\r\nabout the hips and this gives his figure a curiously female appearance.\r\nA scientist friend of mine watching him once remarked that Hitler\r\nseemed afflicted by _steatopygia_, which he defined as “an excessive\r\ndevelopment of fat on the buttocks, especially in _females_.” It is\r\npossible that the strongly feminine element in Hitler’s character\r\nis one of the reasons for his violence. He realizes his femininity,\r\nis ashamed of it, wishes to be a man, and overcompensates by brutal\r\nbehavior. This little fatty-hipped, slope-shouldered, lonely figure,\r\nstanding so inflexibly, his arm outstretched so tautly, his eyes\r\nstaring over the heads of his subjects, is incredible. “No,” you say to\r\nyourself, “this can’t be true.”\r\n\r\nIf this odd creature finally conquers the world, his last victims,\r\nwe once proud Americans, would still be saying as we filed into\r\nconcentration camp, “It’s impossible. He looks too silly.” But he is\r\nnot silly. My friend, Captain Philippe Barres of the French Army, one\r\nof those who did not surrender, remarked to another Frenchman: “You\r\nsay Hitler is merely a madman, an idiot. I suppose you must be one of\r\nthose Frenchmen who prefer to have been conquered by an idiot than by a\r\nclever man.”\r\n\r\nOh no, he certainly is not an idiot; but is it not incredible that\r\nthis mighty conqueror, now master over two hundred and fifty million\r\nEuropeans--more civilized white human beings than ever before came\r\nunder the tyranny of a single despot--and now reaching out to drive\r\nanother thousand million under his yoke, that this man usually looks\r\ncompletely insignificant? I am sure that was the first impression\r\nMussolini had of him. I saw the two dictators when they first met and\r\nHitler never looked sillier in his life than at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How did the two behave toward each other? Did they seem to like\r\neach other?_\r\n\r\nA. Not much. It was June 14, 1934 when Hitler first visited Italy to\r\nmeet the Duce and discuss with him the fate of Austria. Hitler had\r\nnot yet created his army and Mussolini could still talk on terms of\r\nequality, or even a little better. Mussolini wanted to impress his\r\nguest as much as possible with the power and glory of Fascist Italy.\r\nHitler had to try to impress Mussolini with the coming strength of Nazi\r\nGermany. Mussolini, being at home, had all the advantage. For Hitler\r\nthe trip itself must have been a great experience because it was the\r\nfirst time he had ever been out of Germany or Austria in his whole\r\nlife, if you except the time he spent as a soldier in the trenches of\r\nNorthern France.\r\n\r\nMussolini proved a great stage manager. He arranged the meeting to take\r\nplace in Venice, and had his guest land on the airfield of the Lido.\r\nThe fact that it was an island made it easy for the authorities to\r\nexclude the public, and when Hitler arrived he stepped directly into a\r\nperfectly appointed theater.\r\n\r\nThere were representatives of all the Italian armed forces, companies\r\nof Bersaglieri, Alpini, Sailors, Airmen, and the Black Shirt Fascist\r\nMilitia, and a group of the highest civilian officials in black uniform\r\nwith the black-tasseled fez caps of the party, surrounding the Duce\r\nhimself who was in the powder-blue uniform of a Corporal of the Fascist\r\nMilitia.\r\n\r\nMussolini used to think of himself as the successor to the Corsican\r\nCorporal. I remember once noticing that the only ornament on his desk\r\nwas a framed portrait of Napoleon. I remarked on it, and Mussolini\r\nexclaimed, “A great Italian!” One of the Duce’s most ambitious literary\r\nventures was a play called _The Hundred Days_. Whether he is still able\r\nafter Greece, Libya, and Ethiopia to fancy himself in the role of a\r\nconqueror when he meets Hitler now, he still appears in the uniform of\r\na corporal as when he met Hitler the first time.\r\n\r\nThe only persons on the field not in uniform were the foreign\r\ncorrespondents and we looked very dim compared with the brilliant\r\nItalians. Mussolini appeared a few minutes early and when he strode\r\ndown the line and looked over his warriors he made a most vigorous\r\nimpression. He had an electric step; his feet seemed to bounce off the\r\nground, and the air vibrated with his personality. After he finished\r\nreviewing his troops he came over and stood within a few feet of us and\r\nwe waited.\r\n\r\nPresently Hitler’s Junkers plane roared down out of the sky, landed,\r\ntaxied up to us, and came to a full stop. The door opened. The Italian\r\ntroops, dazzling in full dress, presented arms. The Fascist officials\r\nstood at attention. The sunshine sparkled on Mussolini’s gold braid\r\nand the Duce, stepping close to the open door of the airplane, flung\r\nout his arm in a Roman salute with so much energy that it seemed as\r\nthough he might lose his hand. He trembled with passion. Then, out of\r\nthe shadow of the door, emerged Hitler. There, before the splendid\r\nItalians, he stood, a faint little man arrayed in his old worn\r\nraincoat, his blue serge suit, and a brand-new Fedora hat. His right\r\nhand faltered up in the Nazi salute.\r\n\r\nHe gives the salute two ways. For reviewing his own troops or crowds\r\nhe gives it stiff-arm. This is his Prussian style. For greeting\r\nindividuals he gives the salute, Viennese style, with a limp hand, the\r\narm not outstretched but bent at the elbow and the hand flopping back\r\nuntil it almost touches his shoulder, then flopping forward feebly. He\r\nused the Viennese version on Mussolini. Hitler was embarrassed. Later\r\nwe learned he had threatened to dismiss Baron von Neurath, then chief\r\nof protocol, for having advised him to come in civilian clothes.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer stood for a moment, blinking in the sunlight, then\r\nawkwardly came down the steps, and the two dictators shook hands.\r\nThey were not over three yards from me, and I was fascinated to watch\r\nthe expressions on their faces. Beneath the obligatory cordiality I\r\nfancied I could see an expression of amusement in Mussolini’s eyes and\r\nof resentment in Hitler’s. At any rate Hitler’s embarrassment did not\r\ndiminish, for when Mussolini led him down the line of troops he did not\r\nknow how to carry it off. This was the first time he had ever had to\r\ninspect foreign troops, but that was not the chief trouble. The chief\r\ntrouble was his hat.\r\n\r\nHe had taken it off as a salute to the Italian flag, and he started to\r\nput it back on his head, thought better of it, and held it in his right\r\nhand. Then, as he walked beside the Duce, who was chattering all the\r\ntime in his fluent German, Hitler shifted the hat to his left hand,\r\nthen back to the right, and so back and forth until one could feel he\r\nwould have given anything to be able to throw the hat away. Finally,\r\nwhen they reached the end of the line, he clapped the hat back on his\r\nhead, but he had not yet recovered his poise because when they came to\r\nthe launch which was to carry them to Venice, Hitler, flustered, tried\r\nto insist that Mussolini, the host, precede him on board. The Duce\r\nfinally got behind the Fuehrer and shooed him down the gangplank first.\r\n\r\nMussolini arranged that his visitor should constantly be reminded that\r\nalthough Germany might have her great man, Italy had a greater. With\r\ntrue totalitarian courtesy Mussolini ordered thousands of young Black\r\nShirts to cheer him and keep up a continuous howl of “Duce, Duce,\r\nDuce!” whenever Hitler appeared. They jammed St. Mark’s square and that\r\nnight when Mussolini gave his guests a banquet in the wonderful old\r\nPalace of the Doges, the Black Shirts yelled so much and so powerfully\r\nthat nobody could hear the speeches. Finally Mussolini had to send word\r\nfor the boys to quiet down.\r\n\r\nThe show had its desired effect as far as the Italian populace was\r\nconcerned. The climax of the evening was a procession on the Grand\r\nCanal. They had taken from museums the most treasured old gondolas,\r\nand decorated them with lanterns. You may imagine what a spectacle they\r\nmade under a June moon. My wife had a gondolier who spoke a few words\r\nof broken English. She asked him, “What do you think of Hitler?” “Oh,”\r\nsaid the gondolier, “Eetlaire, Eetlaire is only a _piccolo_ Mussolini.”\r\nI wonder if the gondolier still thinks Hitler is a “little Mussolini”?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What did the two dictators accomplish by their meeting? Did they\r\nlay the basis for the Axis there?_\r\n\r\nA. No, just the contrary. They laid the basis for nearly going to\r\nwar with each other. The Axis was not formed until much later, after\r\nMussolini had been compelled to recognize Hitler’s supremacy and take\r\norders from him. At the time they first met, Mussolini still fancied\r\nhimself Hitler’s superior. At Venice they were supposed to negotiate an\r\nagreement about Austria.\r\n\r\nAt that time Mussolini wanted very much to take Austria himself, or to\r\nkeep it independent as a buffer state between Italy and the Germany\r\nwhich he felt was going some day to become strong enough to menace him\r\nas well as the rest of Europe. Hitler, on the other hand, was bent upon\r\nthe Anschluss, upon annexing Austria as the first item on his program\r\nof expansion.\r\n\r\nMussolini had an army of unknown quality but big enough compared with\r\nHitler’s to make the Duce feel superior and Hitler feel cautious. So\r\nthey talked on this basis and Count Ciano, Mussolini’s son-in-law and\r\nalready Propaganda Minister, took me aside the afternoon of the second\r\nday and triumphantly whispered that a “gentleman’s agreement” had been\r\nreached that both parties would respect the integrity and independence\r\nof Austria. It was all I could do to restrain myself from putting in my\r\ncable some obvious crack about the agreement between those two notable\r\n“gentlemen,” but one does not do that under censorship.\r\n\r\nWhat happened then? I must say that everything that has happened in\r\nEurope since the gangsters took over has the quality of a caricature.\r\nSure enough, Hitler and Mussolini made their “gentlemen’s agreement” to\r\nkeep hands off Austria on June 15, and just forty days later, on July\r\n25, Hitler sent a band of Nazi revolutionaries to seize the Austrian\r\ngovernment. They murdered Chancellor Dollfuss, but were overpowered by\r\nloyal troops, and before Hitler could move, Mussolini had mobilized on\r\nthe Brenner mechanized forces strong enough to make Hitler back down\r\nand disavow the whole action. I reached Vienna and the Ballhaus Platz\r\nwhile the loyal troops were still besieging the Reichskanzlei. Dollfuss\r\nhad not died yet. In the midst of it all I had to laugh at the thought\r\nof that “gentlemen’s agreement.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _That must have made Mussolini cocky, to make Hitler back down?_\r\n\r\nA. Decidedly! I went from Vienna where I had covered the Dollfuss\r\nPutsch, back to Berlin for the death of Hindenburg--and incidentally\r\nfor a sidelight on Hitler, let me remark this. You still hear repeated\r\nthe wishful thought that the German Army will some day “do something”\r\nabout Hitler. Nobody who knows anything about Germany believes that\r\nfor a moment now, but I admit I thought it possible until the day\r\nHindenburg died that the army might stop Hitler.\r\n\r\nThat was August 7, 1934, and at the moment Goebbels announced on the\r\nradio the death of the President he also announced that Hitler had\r\nassumed the presidency, which meant he was commander in chief of the\r\narmed forces as well as Reichs Chancellor, and thus had sole executive\r\npower. That morning I came early to the office in Berlin and as I\r\nentered the door Goebbels’ voice began to come over the radio. I worked\r\non the cables until mid-afternoon and then Dosch-Fleurot and I went out\r\nto witness the swearing in of the Berlin garrison. That was where I\r\nlearned that the army would from then on do nothing to stop Hitler.\r\n\r\nThe regiment was drawn up in hollow square and in the middle stood\r\nthe commanding general on a platform. Every one of the 2,000 men and\r\nofficers held his right hand above his head with the two fingers\r\nextended as in taking an oath in court. The general repeated the words\r\ntwo at a time and the troops repeated in sonorous chorus, “I swear--by\r\nGod--eternal allegiance--to my Fuehrer--Adolf Hitler--to obey him,”\r\nand so on, with no word about the flag, the Constitution, or even\r\nthe Fatherland. The oath was a personal oath to Hitler himself, as\r\ncommander in chief. I believe it is unique; at any rate I have never\r\nheard of such an oath in any other army.\r\n\r\nThe officers corps knew what it meant, so much so that thousands\r\nof officers absented themselves that day from duty “on account\r\nof illness,” but when they came back each had to take the oath\r\nindividually. The significance of that is that no German army has ever\r\nmutined, and this oath bound every soldier of Germany to the person of\r\nAdolf Hitler. It was a most impressive ceremony and I carried away from\r\nit the conviction that this army would never break its oath and turn on\r\nHitler until it met defeat. I am still convinced this is true.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Yes, but what about Mussolini? You said he was decidedly cocky\r\nabout defeating Hitler over Austria._\r\n\r\nA. I started to say that after having covered the death of Hindenburg\r\nand the accession to the Presidency of Hitler, I went down and reported\r\nthe Nuremberg Party Congress, and directly thereafter went to Rome\r\nand met Mussolini. It was October 1934. I had met him several times\r\npreviously and he always used to insist on asking more questions than\r\nhe answered; so he began our conversation by saying, “I hear you have\r\nbeen to Nuremberg--what did you learn there? What did they think of me?”\r\n\r\nI answered that frankly the Italians were not popular in Nuremberg,\r\nand that one of my English colleagues, Chris Holmes of Reuters, who is\r\ntall, dark, and handsome, had once been mistaken for an Italian and had\r\nsome trouble with Nazi Storm Troopers until he identified himself. “So\r\nwe are unpopular there,” Mussolini ruminated. “And go on, what else did\r\nyou observe in that line?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I continued, “one night I met a group of officers of the SS\r\n[_Schutzstaffel_] and we were talking about affairs, and one of them\r\nasked me what you, Your Excellency, would have done with those troops\r\nyou mobilized on the Brenner during the Dollfuss Putsch if you had\r\nmarched into Austria.” “Yes,” said the Duce leaning forward. “Yes, yes,\r\ngo on, what did they want to know?” “Well,” I hesitated, “they wanted\r\nto know if you had marched into Austria, would you have stopped there,\r\nor would you have gone on and marched into Germany?” Mussolini put his\r\nhands on the desk and leaned halfway over it, and a great smile came on\r\nhis face as he ejaculated, “Ahhhh! Were they afraid?” I laughed and he\r\nlaughed and it was agreed that the Germans had been afraid, and if ever\r\nthere was a delighted man it was Mussolini, reveling in the thought\r\nthat he had frightened his gentlemen friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You have told us that the first impression one gets of Hitler\r\nis that he looks silly, but you remarked that this was a false\r\nimpression.... Do you imply that on closer acquaintance his personality\r\ngrows upon you?_\r\n\r\nA. In a way, perhaps. At any rate you realize after several meetings\r\nthat the silly appearance is due to superficialities. His moustache,\r\nthe lock of hair over his forehead, and his staring eyes make his face\r\neasy work for a cartoonist, and a world of them have taken advantage\r\nof it. It is almost like a mask. He frequently looks as though he were\r\ngazing into space when he is looking straight at you. He has terrific\r\npower of concentration and sometimes when he talks he appears to forget\r\nhis surroundings, and to be conversing with himself, although he may be\r\nshouting loud enough to be heard by a great multitude.\r\n\r\nHis manner is various, and he can be quietly affable just as another\r\ntime he may rave and bellow until his voice breaks. Once, during his\r\ntrial for treason, I heard him bellow and then surrender to a louder\r\nvoice. This was an incident worth recording, because as far as I know\r\nit is the only time Hitler has been literally shouted down. All during\r\nhis trial the courtroom was dominated by the figure of Ludendorff,\r\nthe great Ludendorff who for the last two years of the war had been\r\nmaster of Germany. Ludendorff of course was as guilty of treason as\r\nHitler, and if the court had done its duty both Ludendorff and Hitler\r\nwould have been sentenced to death and executed. Ludendorff, however,\r\nhad such prestige that even this republican court was afraid to find\r\nhim guilty, and as you know, they acquitted him. And having acquitted\r\nLudendorff it was not possible to sentence Hitler to death. They gave\r\nhim the lightest possible sentence, fortress confinement for five\r\nyears, and later commuted by a general amnesty to less than a year.\r\n\r\nLudendorff used to bark at the court in _Kommandostimme_, the tone of\r\nthe parade ground, every syllable clipped harsh, and when his imperious\r\nvoice rose, the little Chief Justice in the middle of the Bench would\r\nquiver until his white goatee flickered so badly he had to seize it\r\nto keep it quiet. Hitler at that time had nothing like the authority\r\nof Ludendorff but he made up for that by his volubility and his rough\r\ntreatment of the witnesses against him. As defendant he had the right\r\nto question witnesses and he bullied them unmercifully until the turn\r\ncame of General von Lossow, the chief witness for the state. Von Lossow\r\nwas in command of the Bavarian Reichswehr.\r\n\r\nA few days before the Putsch, Hitler had given his personal word of\r\nhonor to von Lossow that he would not try a revolution. On the night\r\nof the Putsch, Hitler, brandishing a revolver, forced von Lossow to\r\njoin the revolution and yield the Bavarian Reichswehr to the new Hitler\r\ngovernment. But the moment von Lossow was free, he mobilized his troops\r\nand crushed the Putsch. So the two men hated each other, and each\r\nconsidered the other a double-crosser.\r\n\r\nWhen von Lossow took the stand, Hitler stood up and yelled a question.\r\nThereupon the General, a tall bony man, with a corrugated shaven\r\nhead and a jaw of steel, pulled himself up to his full height and\r\nbegan yelling at Hitler and throwing his long forefinger as if it\r\nwere a weapon at Hitler’s face. Hitler started to shout back, but the\r\nGeneral shouted so much louder, and looked so menacing, that presently\r\nHitler fell back in his seat as if he had collapsed under a physical\r\nblow. Hitler had his revenge on June 30, 1934 when he had von Lossow\r\nassassinated along with the hundreds of others who perished in the\r\nBlood Purge. In retrospect it is fascinating to reflect that Hitler,\r\nthe most successful bully our world has seen, can himself be bullied.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you think that Hitler is personally responsible, or largely\r\nresponsible, for this war? Is it possible to ascribe that much\r\nimportance to one individual?_\r\n\r\nA. I do ascribe that much importance to the individual Hitler. We would\r\nno more have had this war, in the form it has taken, and at the time it\r\nhas taken place, without Hitler, than we would have had the Napoleonic\r\nwars without Napoleon. Without Hitler, Germany would either have forged\r\nslowly ahead as she was doing under the Weimar Republic, or she would\r\nhave come under some other leader of Pan-German Imperialism who would\r\nhave attempted on a lesser and not so successful scale something like\r\nthe thing Hitler has attempted. It is extremely unlikely that anyone\r\nelse could have been found with Hitler’s genius. It is more likely that\r\nthe Weimar Republic would have persisted. Remember, when Hitler was\r\nsentenced to fortress confinement for his 1923 Putsch, his National\r\nSocialist German Workers Party practically disappeared, but immediately\r\nupon his emergence from prison it began to grow until by 1928 he had 12\r\nseats, and in 1930, 130 seats in the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nYou may say this growth of a radical party would have been inevitable\r\nunder the circumstances of economic crisis, unemployment, and so on. I\r\nagree that the growth of radical votes would have been inevitable, but\r\nit was far from inevitable that so many of these radical votes should\r\nbe canalized into one great, super-efficient, terroristic, militaristic\r\nparty. This was the accomplishment of one man, Adolf Hitler.\r\n\r\nI was a correspondent in Germany from 1923 on, and during that\r\nparticular decade, 1923 to 1933, when Hitler took power, two-thirds\r\nof the German electorate voted consistently in favor of some form\r\nof collectivism, either Social Democracy, or National Socialism, or\r\nCommunism. I contend that it was solely the genius of Adolf Hitler\r\nwhich eventually brought the whole country under his particular brand\r\nof collectivism. Without him the votes given the Nazis would have\r\nbeen split in half a dozen ways, and the probability is that the\r\nconservative parties representing one-third of the votes, with the\r\nSocial Democrats who wanted a democratic republican collectivism, would\r\nhave won out in the long run, and we should have had a republican\r\nGermany today and no war. This is sheer retrospective speculation, but\r\nit is useful to point out the importance of the personality of Hitler.\r\n\r\nThe Marxists have always insisted that individuals do not count; that\r\nhistory is made by economic and social forces which in the long run\r\naccomplish their destiny no matter who lives or dies. The longer I\r\nlive the less I believe in this explanation of history, at any rate as\r\nit applies to our span of life.\r\n\r\nOver centuries it may be that the great forces carry mankind\r\nirresistibly along no matter what leaders it has, but within a single\r\ngeneration we are bound to feel that the history of our nation\r\nwould have been quite different if this or that individual had not\r\nexisted. Objectively it may be true that over long periods of time\r\nthe individual leader counts for little. But subjectively, for short\r\nperiods of time, the individual leader counts for nearly everything.\r\nWhat a difference it would have made for the Jews of the whole world,\r\nif a Hitler had not obtained control of the collectivist movement in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing inherently anti-Semitic in the German yearning for a\r\n_Gemeinschaft_, a collective. Anti-Semitism need not have played any\r\npart in National Socialism any more than it did in Communism or Social\r\nDemocracy. Yet, because Hitler from his early youth had been infected\r\nwith this curious kind of psychic sickness, anti-Semitism became a part\r\nof the German state religion, and from this accident of history has\r\ngrown the tragedy of twelve million people.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is Hitler really the boss of Germany, or is there not someone\r\nbehind the throne?_\r\n\r\nA. There is nobody behind the throne. Hitler is the whole regime, its\r\nauthor, its parent, its spirit, its brains, and its boss.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What about the men around Hitler; are any of them of the caliber to\r\nsucceed him?_\r\n\r\nA. None of them is of the caliber to succeed Hitler, but Hitler has\r\npublicly announced Goering as his successor, and he would automatically\r\ntake the position if der Fuehrer should die now. In the Party there\r\nis nobody to compete with him. The bloodthirsty Himmler, head of\r\nthe SS Elite Guards and the Gestapo, is merely a policeman, one of\r\ngreat ability, ranking perhaps with the notorious Fouché of the\r\nFrench Revolution, but out of the question as Fuehrer. Goebbels, the\r\nadvertising director, is the cleverest man in the Party, but he would\r\nbe lucky to remain alive twenty-four hours after Hitler’s protective\r\nhand was removed. He and Himmler are rivals in unpopularity. Who are\r\nthe rest? Minor figures, as Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the upstart\r\n“Bismarck” of the champagne trade, who if anything is more widely\r\ndisliked and despised than Goebbels. Hess, of course, has fled. Dr.\r\nLey, the head of the Labor Front, is the type of drunken, racketeering\r\nlabor gangster who in this country would have gone to the penitentiary\r\nunder the lash of Westbrook Pegler. Alfred Rosenberg, the Party’s\r\n“brain,” could no more succeed Hitler than he could take Joe Louis’s\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe more one scrutinizes the German scene the more one realizes that\r\nthe war has moved all the big party figures far into the background,\r\nleaving only Goering a modest place miles beneath the Fuehrer. The\r\noutside world has believed Goering would be an improvement on Hitler,\r\nin that he would be more amenable to reason, less aggressive. He would\r\nbe an improvement only in that he would be weaker. His instincts and\r\nintentions are not more Christian than Hitler’s. He would have neither\r\nHitler’s magic hold on the German people nor Hitler’s genius in action,\r\nbut he is as cruel a man as ever exercised power in a modern state.\r\nAt the same time he has all the sentimentality which is an almost\r\ninvariable accompaniment of brutality in this type of German. During\r\nthe period of the worst Terror, the active Nazi revolution in 1933,\r\nGoering was over Himmler in charge of the concentration camps, and at\r\nthe moment when the Nazi sadists and criminals in charge of the camps\r\nwere beating to death and torturing and hanging scores of men daily,\r\nGoering decreed the severest law against cruelty to animals ever to be\r\npassed anywhere.\r\n\r\nGoering’s most marked characteristics, aside from his high animal\r\nspirits, his callous cruelty, and his sentimentality, are his energy,\r\ncourage, and will power. He looks too fat to be self-disciplined, but\r\nhe twice cured himself of the morphine habit, which he had contracted\r\nafter his wounding in the World War, and again after his wounding on\r\nthe Odeon’s Platz during the Munich Putsch. A glandular derangement\r\nresulting from his wounds made him monstrously obese, but appears to\r\nhave endowed him with an excess of energy which he demonstrates by\r\ndoing the work of half a dozen men. He works incomparably harder than\r\nHitler who by any ordinary standards is a fitful worker, given to long\r\nspells of dreamy idleness.\r\n\r\nEverybody else in Germany quails before Goering, but Reichs Marshal\r\nGoering becomes a trembling, whipped child when Hitler yells at him,\r\ndespite fanciful newspaper stories about Goering’s disputing with der\r\nFuehrer. The Army prefers Goering to any other Nazi leader except\r\nHitler, because Goering is the only soldier and the only gentleman by\r\nbirth among the Nazi chiefs. Yet when one has reviewed all the points\r\nin favor of Goering’s position, it becomes more and more obvious that\r\nthe war has made a successor to Hitler almost unthinkable. Hitler has\r\nthe power now more than ever, but the power now is the Army; it is no\r\nlonger, as it was until September 1939, the Party. If Goering were to\r\ntake over automatically, after Hitler’s death, how long could he keep\r\nthe apparatus running; what would the Army do; how would the German\r\npeople and the people of Europe respond to their new and obviously so\r\nimmensely inferior master? The more one considers the condition of\r\nGermany today the more it seems that Hitler is indispensable to German\r\nsuccess. His successors would probably succeed one another with Blitz\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What about Karl Haushofer, who is said to be his one-man brain\r\ntrust?_\r\n\r\nA. Haushofer is one of the men Hitler consults. Hitler likes\r\nHaushofer’s theory of what they call _Geopolitik_ because it fits\r\nin with Hitler’s own theory that politics should always go ahead\r\nof economics, which is his particular way of proving the Marxists\r\nwrong. But Haushofer has no more influence than perhaps half a dozen\r\nof Hitler’s advisers. Hitler hates experts, because they advance\r\nobjections to his projects. The only experts who have a chance with\r\nhim are yes-men, except in the Army. He listens to technical advice\r\nfrom generals he respects, although even from them he would tolerate no\r\nshadow of opposition to his grand strategy. You may be sure Haushofer\r\nhas never said no.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is Hitler also in the military sphere the real war lord? Does he\r\nactually direct his battles as did Napoleon?_\r\n\r\nA. Hitler is the nearest thing to Napoleon since Napoleon. I remember\r\njust before the beginning of the war, in August 1939, I asked a Colonel\r\nof the French General Staff if they had heard that Hitler had taken\r\nover active command of the Army, in fact, and that when war began he\r\nwould direct the fighting. The French Colonel said yes, that the French\r\nGeneral Staff knew that was true. Then he surprised me by saying that\r\nthey did not like it.\r\n\r\nI had expected him to rub his hands and exclaim over French good\r\nluck in having an amateur at the head of the German Army. Not at\r\nall. This French Colonel went on to explain that Hitler had already\r\ndemonstrated the most miraculous sense of timing, and this was perhaps\r\nthe most important talent a field marshal could have, and that with\r\nthe technical advice of his generals, Hitler might prove a formidable\r\nadversary indeed. Less than a year later the French Colonel who had\r\nforeseen so well was one of the vast army of military refugees fleeing\r\nbefore the New Napoleon.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that Hitler blueprints each battle and determines\r\nwhere each division is to go. He simply determines the grand strategy,\r\nnames the objective, and sets the time. For instance, in the case of\r\nPoland, some time before the German attack, Hitler called his General\r\nStaff together and said, “Gentlemen, I want you to work out a plan for\r\nthe crushing of Poland as swiftly as possible. The problem is how to\r\nknock out Poland before the French and British can bring any help or\r\nalleviation by attacking in the West. Now, how many divisions can we\r\nhave fully mobilized within a month? So, and how many do we need to\r\nhold the French? So. That will leave us so and so many for the Polish\r\ncampaign. Now, gentlemen, at how many different points can we attack\r\nPoland, from every available entrance? You say five, including East\r\nPrussia. All right, now within forty-eight hours I want you to bring me\r\na sketch plan of attack, with the outline of the number of divisions to\r\nattack at each point.”\r\n\r\nWith these data in hand Hitler orders the general disposition of the\r\ntroops. Then he waits, and takes into account each of a score or\r\nhundred other factors besides military factors that may enter into\r\nthe supreme decision to choose the exact time to strike. He considers\r\nthe attitude of all the powers involved, the British and French\r\nmorale, their military strength, the weather, the attitude of Poland’s\r\nneighbors, the Polish preparations, and finally when he is ready he\r\ngives the fateful order to march at 2 A.M. on September 1, 1939. Before\r\nthe order reaches the commanding generals probably not more than half a\r\ndozen men in the world know the time.\r\n\r\nHe may meet technical criticism from his generals; he often does. But\r\nunlike Mussolini, whose staff is so subservient and sycophantic that\r\nthey say “Yes” when the Duce has outlined some impossible campaign such\r\nas his fiasco in Greece, the German generals voice their objections.\r\nIf the objections are valid, Hitler may change his plans. As a rule,\r\nhowever, Hitler’s grand strategy is seldom affected, because the great\r\nsweeping decisions are based upon Hitler’s appreciation of the problem,\r\nthe campaign, the scene as a whole. His generals will be thinking of\r\nthe local problem, and their opinion in this respect carries weight.\r\nBut Hitler will be thinking in terms first of the whole war, second of\r\nthe whole campaign, as against Poland. To these great decisions the\r\ngenerals invariably bow.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why? How has this man who was able to become only a corporal in\r\nthe last war suddenly obtained such an ascendancy over the German Army\r\nand in particular over the General Staff? I always understood that\r\nthe General Staff of the German Army was one of the proudest, most\r\nprofessionally capable, and vain and exclusive organizations in the\r\nwhole world._\r\n\r\nA. How has Hitler done it? By being always right. Well, nearly always.\r\nHe has so far made two mistakes, either or both of which may prove\r\nfatal, or not, as destiny will have it. The first was when, instead of\r\nlaunching an all-out assault on Britain immediately after Dunkirk, he\r\npursued the crumbling French Army, which as he later learned, could not\r\nhave been a danger to him; thus he postponed too late his attack on\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why didn’t he attack England at that time?_\r\n\r\nA. Because Hitler did not expect France to collapse as speedily as she\r\ndid. Neither he nor anyone else in the world expected it. He may say\r\nhe did but the best proof that he did not is the fact that he failed\r\nto take advantage of it. When the German armies broke through the\r\nLow Countries, and began to press upon the French line at the famous\r\n“hinge” at Montmedy, they were like a man who is pressing hard on a\r\nlocked and bolted door when suddenly the bolt breaks, the door flies\r\nopen, and the man pitches forward into the room.\r\n\r\nSo the German armies pitched forward into France when they broke across\r\nthe Meuse and staggered on, almost losing their balance for lack of\r\nthe opposition they had expected to find. They lurched on until at the\r\nend of five weeks the French Army had dissolved; the French government\r\nhad surrendered; the nation of France had ceased to exist. Then Hitler\r\npulled his army together, turned it around, started it for the Channel\r\nports. But it takes time to turn an army around; it takes time to\r\nestablish air bases and collect the thousands of flat-bottomed vessels\r\nto ferry an army across the channel.\r\n\r\nThe time required was fifty-five days from June 17, the day the French\r\nasked for an armistice, to August 8, when the Germans made their first\r\nmass air attack on Britain as preliminary to invasion. It was those\r\nfifty-five days which saved Britain. I arrived in London on June 20,\r\nfull of the apprehension that Hitler’s army was about to sweep the\r\nworld. After all it is impressive to have believed all your life that\r\nthe French Army was the best in the world and then to witness it\r\ndisappear in thirty-seven days of fighting.\r\n\r\nIt is more impressive to become a refugee. I had established in Paris\r\nthe first home I had had in twenty years of vagabond newspaper work.\r\nAs the German armies came closer to the French capital I congratulated\r\nmyself that I could now live at home and motor daily to the front. Then\r\none night around midnight the American military attaché, my old friend\r\nColonel Horace M. Fuller, our wisest professional observer of the war\r\nabroad, and Lieutenant-Commander Hillenkoetter, our naval attaché,\r\nveteran submarine expert, called on me and said: “Knick, you must leave\r\ntonight; the Germans will be here by morning.”\r\n\r\nIn Edgar Mowrer’s overfull Ford, followed by Lilian Mowrer valiantly\r\ndriving her tiny Simca, we left Paris about three o’clock in the\r\nmorning, passing through empty streets, the great boulevards stretching\r\nwide and forlorn without so much as a policeman in sight, while fog\r\neddied above the paving. We passed through the gates of the city where\r\nnot even a sentry stood.\r\n\r\nParis was already broken, already humiliated. We fled on down, stopping\r\nwith the demoralized government at Tours, and then on to Bordeaux\r\nwhere with 1,600 other refugees I found a place on the British India\r\nLine S.S. _Madura_, built to accommodate 160. On the way from Paris\r\nto Bordeaux we had traveled with six to eight million other refugees,\r\nthe largest number of fugitives ever to assemble on the roads of the\r\nWestern World. Flight, flight, flight! Anything to get away! That was\r\nthe panic spirit which had gripped the whole population of France, as\r\nof the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nThe German Army could not even come in contact with the main body\r\nof refugees, except in the contact of murder when the Luftwaffe\r\nmachine-gunned the roads. From the moment, eleven days after the grand\r\nassault began, when the Germans reached the sea at Abbeville, May 21,\r\nfrom that moment on French resistance disappeared. But Hitler could\r\nnot begin to attack England until the British Expeditionary Force and\r\nthe Northern French Army were destroyed. Actually the B.E.F. escaped\r\nfrom Dunkirk June 4, and from that date on Hitler was free to turn in\r\neither direction, and many observers believed he would drive straight\r\nat England.\r\n\r\nInstead, he chose to pursue the French Army another thirteen days,\r\nuntil it surrendered. If Hitler, immediately after Dunkirk, had\r\nconcentrated every resource on invading England, nobody can say what\r\nwould have happened. Dunkirk had shocked the British more deeply than\r\nanything in 100 years, but the French capitulation shocked them worse.\r\n\r\nBy the time I arrived at Falmouth, after four days on deck with my\r\nfellow refugees, the British were still dazed, dismayed, not panicky,\r\nbut desperately aware that they stood closer to national destruction\r\nthan ever in 1,000 years. The truth was they had no army, or rather\r\ntheir army had no weapons. The B.E.F., which had possessed about 75 per\r\ncent of all the weapons possessed by all the British Land Forces, had\r\nbeen compelled to leave behind at Dunkirk all their tanks, cannon, and\r\nmost of their machine guns and even their rifles. It was terrifying to\r\nstand on the curb in London and watch battalions of the Guards march by\r\nwith only half a dozen rifles to a battalion.\r\n\r\nThe British Land Forces immediately after Dunkirk were practically\r\nweaponless. The R.A.F. which was soon to give so gallant an account of\r\nitself, needed reorganization; all the units which had been in France\r\nhad to be brought back and reintegrated for the defense of the island.\r\nIf ever the German invasion could succeed, it could have succeeded\r\nthen, but Hitler did not move until the night of August 8, when he sent\r\nover his first mass of 400 bombers and fired the docks of London in a\r\nblaze so high I was able to read a newspaper by its light on the roof\r\nof the Ministry of Information building, eight miles from the fire. Had\r\nthat attack been launched June 8 or even June 18, instead of August 8,\r\nwho knows what the result would have been? By August 8 the British had\r\nbeen transformed.\r\n\r\nThree things had happened to them which had not happened for over 100\r\nyears, since the time of Napoleon. First, they had become frightened;\r\nsecond, they had become angry; third, they had been forced, again I\r\nrepeat, for the first time in 100 years, forced to go to work. Until\r\nthe fall of France the British had been as easygoing as we are now,\r\ndespite the fact they had been formally at war for eight months; but\r\nafter the fall of France every able-bodied human being in the United\r\nKingdom went to work at the rate of ten to twelve hours a day seven\r\ndays a week.\r\n\r\nIn a miraculously short time they tripled their production of weapons,\r\nplanes, ammunition; meanwhile we sent them 1,000 cannon, many machine\r\nguns, and 750,000 rifles. The R.A.F. trained, reorganized, expanded,\r\nlaid out new fields. In short, when Hitler attacked he struck a new\r\nBritain, aroused as never since 1066. It was a dazzling example of what\r\ndanger can do to a people. The British of August 1940 were not the\r\nBritish of June 1940.\r\n\r\nHistorians will wonder why Hitler did not move earlier against England.\r\nI suppose they will go on wondering why for centuries, even after\r\nHitler has explained it in his memoirs, for his own benefit, and to\r\nthe satisfaction of few. My estimate is that he simply overvalued the\r\nFrench Army and undervalued the British spirit. Surprised by the French\r\ncollapse he was carried along by the momentum of his drive to destroy\r\nthe possibility of further French resistance before trying to invade\r\nEngland. He lost thereby what may prove to have been his greatest\r\nchance when he failed to throw his whole air force, army, and navy at\r\nEngland in the moment of her greatest weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What was Hitler’s second mistake?_\r\n\r\nA. His second mistake was when he went into Russia, apparently\r\nexpecting the Red Army to fold up at least as fast as the French Army,\r\nprobably hoping to be able to turn around and launch a second attack\r\non Britain in 1941 before American aid became effective. The initial\r\neffect of the invasion of Russia was a disappointment to Hitler,\r\nhowever it may eventually end. So was the First Battle of Britain, but\r\nthe final outcome of both battles must be awaited to determine how they\r\nwill affect Hitler’s reputation as a master of war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his generals have not had reason to change fundamentally\r\nthe judgment they formed on the basis of their experience with him\r\nsince 1933. That experience began when he took over the Presidency and\r\nobtained the oath of allegiance which, as we have seen, laid at least a\r\nlegal foundation for his ascendancy over the armed forces. Then he set\r\nout to build out of the 100,000-man Reichswehr the mightiest military\r\nmachine the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nHe denounced the military clauses of the Versailles treaty, and thus\r\nrelieved the Army of its crushing sense of being condemned forever to\r\ninferiority. He boldly announced the creation of an Air Force, and\r\nassigned to it the explosive energies of his first Paladin, Goering.\r\nThereafter, all the resources of the nation were poured into the armed\r\nforces. Nothing was too good for the troops. They were given barracks\r\nsuch as no European army had ever had, as good as anything the United\r\nStates Army has ever known. The food of the army and navy and air force\r\nwas improved until it was on the average far better, even in peacetime,\r\nthan anything the German soldier had to eat at home.\r\n\r\nDiscipline was kept at its highest point, but at the same time a new\r\nspirit of comradeship came into the German armed forces. For the first\r\ntime in the history of the German Navy, officers and men would eat at\r\nthe same table. All this was bound to have its effect upon the services\r\nand to make them think at any rate gratefully of Hitler, but of course\r\nthe test had still to come. What would this commander in chief order\r\nhis troops to do? Would he lead them into some impossible adventure\r\nprematurely? Would this amateur after building his beautiful machine\r\nsacrifice it in some vainglorious maneuver? It seemed as though he\r\nwould do just that.\r\n\r\nThe first test of Hitler’s fitness to command his army came on March 7,\r\n1936, when he ordered it into the Rhineland to reoccupy that portion of\r\nGermany adjoining France which had been demilitarized by the Versailles\r\ntreaty. France had insisted that Germany should promise never to\r\nquarter troops on the right bank of the Rhine. This was to make up\r\nfor the fact that France had been prevented from occupying the right\r\nbank of the Rhine, and for the fact that the United States in 1919 had\r\nrefused to join the proposed tripartite pact of France, England, and\r\nthe United States, to guarantee the French from invasion by Germany.\r\n\r\nAs long as the Germans kept out of the Rhineland, France was safe. If\r\nthe Germans ever reoccupied the Rhineland, it meant that they intended\r\nsooner or later to use it as a jumping-off-place from which to attack\r\nFrance. France therefore had insisted upon and had obtained this clause\r\nin the Versailles treaty, and had thereafter frequently announced that\r\nits violation would mean war. Nevertheless, Hitler toward the middle\r\nof February 1936 informed his General Staff that in the first week of\r\nMarch he intended to reoccupy the Rhineland. At that moment Hitler met\r\nhis first opposition from the Army. The generals protested that they\r\ncould not be responsible for what would happen, because if the French\r\nmobilized and fought, the German Army was not strong enough--it would\r\nhave to retreat. Unspoken was the conclusion that if the German Army\r\nretreated, it would mean the end of the Nazi regime, the end of Hitler.\r\n\r\nHitler replied that it was the duty of the Army to obey orders; it was\r\nhis duty as Fuehrer to give orders which could be successfully obeyed.\r\n“I know,” he told them, “that the French will not mobilize. I know the\r\nFrench will not fight. I know the English don’t want them to fight.\r\nDon’t ask me how I know. I know. It is my business to know.”\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, I learned under\r\nunusual circumstances something of what went on inside the German\r\nGeneral Staff during those days of March 1936, which were to decide\r\nthe history of the continent. At Burgos, headquarters of Franco’s\r\ngovernment, I met Major von der Osten, who was ostensibly in charge of\r\ncertain economic investigations or negotiations, but as a matter of\r\nfact was the chief of the German Gestapo in Spain. He was an agreeable\r\nfellow, father of eight children, highly intelligent, amusing, and\r\nit did not matter to me that some months before, his organization,\r\nthe Gestapo, had had me arrested and thrown into a death cell in San\r\nSebastian for thirty-six hours, whence I escaped by the determined\r\nvocal and political efforts of my friend and fellow correspondent,\r\nRandolph Churchill.\r\n\r\nThe Major knew that I knew that he was chief of the Gestapo and he knew\r\nthat I would do all I could to get information from him of value to me,\r\nas I knew he would do likewise with me. So we got along famously, and\r\none day he included me in a picnic with several other correspondents.\r\nThere, on the banks of a clear stream while the Major’s soldier\r\nservants served us grilled frankfurters and Rhine wine, I led the\r\nconversation into discussion of what the Army thought of Hitler. The\r\ntheme reached the reoccupation of the Rhineland, and at this the Major\r\nbecame enlightening.\r\n\r\n“I was assigned to the Bendlerstrasse [headquarters of the General\r\nStaff] then,” the Major said. “I can tell you that for five days and\r\nfive nights not one of us closed an eye. We knew that if the French\r\nmarched, we were done. We had no fortifications, and no army to match\r\nthe French. If the French had even mobilized, we should have been\r\ncompelled to retire.” He confirmed that the opinion of virtually the\r\nentire General Staff was against Hitler; they considered the move\r\nsuicidal, and when they did move, it was only to obey orders, not\r\nbecause they were convinced it was right.\r\n\r\n“And what did they think after the thing was all over and Hitler had\r\nbeen proved right? Did they think that Hitler had proved himself a\r\ngenius or that he just had extraordinarily good luck?”\r\n\r\nThe Major smiled. “We thought there was a good deal of kind fortune\r\nconcerned,” he said.\r\n\r\nThat was Hitler’s first brush with his army, and his generals may\r\nwell have put him down as lucky. He won, and later events proved how\r\ntremendous his victory was. For the occupation of the Rhineland enabled\r\nHitler to build there his Siegfried line, and the Siegfried line\r\nenabled him eventually to hold France until he was ready to fall upon\r\nand destroy her as he did in 1940.\r\n\r\nThis first demonstration that he was “always right,” strengthened\r\nhis position with the General Staff enormously. The second test was\r\naccordingly easier. It was Austria.\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of the Rhineland, so in the case of Austria, France\r\nhad often declared that any German attempt to annex Austria would be a\r\ncause of war. This made good sense, just as it had made good sense for\r\nthe French to have said they would go to war to prevent reoccupation\r\nof the Rhineland. Once the Germans had the Rhineland and began to\r\nfortify it, they made it difficult for the French to defend Austria.\r\nOnce the Germans had Austria they made it difficult for the French to\r\ndefend Czechoslovakia. Once the Germans had Czechoslovakia they made it\r\ndifficult for the French to defend France.\r\n\r\nThe German generals understood this series of steps as well as or\r\nbetter than the French, and therefore they could not believe that the\r\nFrench would allow each step to be taken without trying to stop it.\r\nTherefore, as Hitler ordered each step taken, his generals protested,\r\nsince like all generals they did not want to start a war without the\r\ncertainty of winning.\r\n\r\nThey protested vigorously over the decision to go into Austria, but\r\nonce again Hitler said: “Gentlemen, it is your business to take the\r\naction I direct. It is my business to direct only action which will be\r\nsuccessful. I can assure you now, as I assured you on the reoccupation\r\nof the Rhineland, that now also France will not move, the British will\r\nnot move; we can do as we like.” He was right again, and now with two\r\nmajor victories to his credit, he could face his generals with an even\r\nmore momentous and critical order--to occupy Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nThis third move, against Czechoslovakia, was the most critical,\r\nbecause here France was pledged by her solemn word of honor to fight\r\nfor her ally, and because the possession of Czechoslovakia would make\r\nit possible finally to attack France herself. These two facts were of\r\ncourse amply known to the German generals and once more they assumed\r\nthat the French generals and the French government would now awaken\r\nand fight for the life of their country.\r\n\r\nSo, in spite of the two lessons Hitler had given them, the German\r\ngenerals once more pointed out the dangers. Their Siegfried line was\r\nnot nearly complete. If they threw crushing weight at Czechoslovakia,\r\nthey would have to weaken their West Front so badly that the French, if\r\nthey wished to plunge, might break through. Hitler this time was beside\r\nhimself. He not only knew the French and British would not fight if the\r\nCzechs asked them to fight, but he believed, and I think he was right,\r\nthat the French and British would not have fought even if the Czechs\r\nhad fought.\r\n\r\nSo he wanted above all things at this juncture to meet a little\r\nopposition to blood his sword. He wanted the Czechs to fight, and\r\nknowing he would have them alone, he longed for a chance to show what\r\nhis vast army and air force could do with overwhelming odds on their\r\nside. In my opinion it is just the opposite of true to say that Hitler\r\nwanted another bloodless victory. He did not. He wanted a bloody one,\r\nthe blood of course, to be shed by the hopelessly outnumbered enemy.\r\nIt seemed to him absolutely idiotic that any of his generals should\r\nobject. They did, but feebly.\r\n\r\nOnce more Hitler overrode them, with the same arguments. “France will\r\nnot fight. The British will not fight. We can do as we like with the\r\nCzechs. I only hope they do fight.” Hitler this time got everything\r\nhe wanted but one thing. The Czechs, brutally betrayed by their ally\r\nFrance and bullied by England, did not fight. Hitler was cheated of\r\nhis desire to do violence. At Munich the bad temper he displayed when\r\nChamberlain and Daladier gave in to him on every point was caused by\r\nthe fact that he realized these good gentlemen were going to make the\r\nCzechs surrender. He was not going to be given the chance to drop one\r\nbomb. He had to wait a whole year for his bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIf you doubt this analysis of Hitler’s bloodthirstiness, recollect that\r\nhe never gave Poland a chance to imitate Czechoslovakia’s surrender.\r\nWould it not be a matter for wonderment if the German generals\r\nhad failed to be impressed by this third example of the Fuehrer’s\r\ninfallibility?\r\n\r\nYet when he proposed to destroy Poland even after the British and\r\nFrench had “guaranteed” her, some of Hitler’s generals still cautiously\r\noffered objections on the grounds that this would inevitably mean\r\nthe Great War and maybe they could not win the Great War. For the\r\nfourth time Hitler overcame constantly lessening opposition of “timid”\r\ngenerals. He explained that he would knock out Poland before the French\r\nor British could strike, if indeed they intended to strike at all.\r\n\r\nThere was some doubt whether the Allies would really fight. Ribbentrop\r\ninsisted Britain was through, and although they might declare war and\r\nmobilize, the British would do so only to save face, and would take\r\nthe first opportunity to quit with a negotiated peace. But even if the\r\nBritish and the French did go to war, Hitler explained, he would finish\r\nPoland swiftly, and then turn such heat on France, bring such terrific\r\nforces to bear on the Western Front, that she would probably also be\r\nready to negotiate peace, and if not he would knock her out also.\r\n_That_ he was sure he could do, and once he had done that, the British\r\nwould capitulate.\r\n\r\nIf there was any opposition lingering among the generals, it\r\ndisappeared upon the signature of the Russo-German Pact, August 23,\r\n1939. This most brilliant of all Hitler’s foreign political coups\r\nconvinced his generals first that they would not have to fight a war on\r\ntwo major fronts, second that they were in the hands of an invincible\r\nmilitary-political genius of the first category.\r\n\r\nHow gloriously right Hitler seemed to be. At first everything appeared\r\nto depend upon the speed with which Hitler could knock out the Poles,\r\nwhether he could finish them off before the French could mobilize for a\r\ngreat offensive on the West. Optimistic Poles said they could hold out\r\nfor three years; pessimistic Poles said one year. The French thought\r\nthe Poles could hold for six months. The German generals thought it\r\nwould take three months to break the Poles. Hitler gave them six weeks\r\nto do the job. They conquered Poland in eighteen days!\r\n\r\nThen came Norway and then came France!\r\n\r\nNo matter what the German generals had thought before, by May 1940 they\r\nhad the feeling Hitler was another Napoleon. Sure enough, on May 10,\r\nthey attacked and on June 17 the French Army, the mighty French Army of\r\n4,500,000 men only three generations from Napoleon, surrendered. The\r\nGermans, led by Hitler, had accomplished the greatest victory in the\r\nhistory of the German Army, and had inflicted upon their age-old enemy\r\nthe most colossal defeat in the history of France. Indeed from the\r\npoint of view of the numbers of men involved, and the issues at stake,\r\nit may be said to be dimensionally the greatest victory of military\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHow can anyone now wonder that after the fall of France the German\r\nGeneral Staff with all its professional vanity would be proud to take\r\nand if necessary blindly obey orders from Corporal Hitler?\r\n\r\nHitler had brought his General Staff to this position of unquestioning\r\nobedience when he gave the orders to attack Russia. Here was truly the\r\nplace for caution. If Hitler was another Napoleon, here was the same\r\nRussia. It meant a two-front war. It would give time for United States\r\naid to become effective. At the best it meant lengthening the war by\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n“No,” Hitler ordered, “we shall conquer Russia before the summer is\r\nout, and conquer England before the year is out and before the United\r\nStates can do anything about it. _Vorwaerts!_” Only the prestige built\r\nup by Hitler’s uninterrupted series of victories from the Rhineland to\r\nCrete could have won the acquiescence of the German General Staff to\r\nthe Russian adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is Hitler personally brave?_\r\n\r\nA. It is hard to say. I could put it this way: Hitler is not the sort\r\nof man about whom one would unhesitatingly say that he is personally\r\nbrave, as one would say about Churchill, for example. Perhaps we shall\r\nnot count the story he told me about his winning the Iron Cross in the\r\nlast war, since many Germans say it is not a true story. Yet it is an\r\ninteresting one. He told it to me the night of March 11, 1932 on the\r\neve of the Presidential election when he ran against Hindenburg and\r\nscored eleven million to Hindenburg’s eighteen million votes.\r\n\r\nI asked him how he had won his Iron Cross. He always wore it but his\r\npolitical enemies declared there was no record in the army archives of\r\nits having been awarded him and neither in _Mein Kampf_ nor elsewhere\r\ncould there be found any account of how he got it. I was afraid when I\r\nasked the question that it might irritate him, but he seemed amused,\r\nand even pleased.\r\n\r\n“You know,” he said, “I was a dispatch bearer in the war. One day,\r\ntoward the first of June 1918, I was ordered to take a message to\r\nanother part of the front, and had to traverse a section of no man’s\r\nland. Presently I passed a dugout which I thought abandoned, but\r\nsuddenly I heard French voices below.\r\n\r\n“Being alone, and armed only with a pistol, I stopped a moment, then\r\ndrew my pistol and shouted below in my very bad French, ‘Come up,\r\nsurrender!’ Then I shouted in German as though to a squad of soldiers,\r\norders to ‘Fix bayonets! Draw your hand grenades!’ First one French\r\nsoldier, and then another, and then another came up with their hands\r\nin the air until there were seven. I marched them to the rear and\r\nturned them over as prisoners of war. Now,” he paused, and smiled at\r\nTom Delmer of the London _Daily Express_, who was with me, “if they had\r\nbeen English soldiers, or,” turning to me and continuing to smile, “if\r\nthey had been American soldiers, I am not sure I should have been able\r\nto make them surrender so easily, and perhaps I would not have my Iron\r\nCross or be here today.”\r\n\r\nThis is the only time I have observed a sense of humor in Hitler,\r\nand of course if his story is correct, it proves that he had on that\r\noccasion a considerable amount of personal bravery.\r\n\r\nThen there is the time when, during the 1923 Munich Beer Hall Putsch,\r\nhe threw himself down when the Reichswehr armored car began to fire its\r\nmachine gun at him and Ludendorff and Goering and the rest of them.\r\nI was about a hundred yards away, jammed in the crowd, when I heard\r\nthat machine-gun fire, the first I had ever heard in my life. That\r\none whiff of fire killed sixteen of Hitler’s men including the body\r\nservant of Ludendorff standing next to the General whom he had served\r\nthroughout the war. Hitler was injured because he had thrown himself\r\ndown so violently that he broke his collarbone. Would you consider that\r\na sign of cowardice? I do not know. It was the proper reaction for a\r\nfront-line soldier.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Ludendorff not only refused to take shelter but\r\ncontemptuously stalked across the Odeon’s Platz and, in his uniform\r\nof a Lieutenant General, gave himself up to the Reichswehr Lieutenant\r\nin charge of the armored car, with the words: “Arrest me, Lieutenant.\r\nI shall never wear this uniform again.” Now there was a man about\r\nwhom one would unhesitatingly say he is a brave man. You remember how\r\nLudendorff, then a Colonel, took the fortress of Liege singlehanded,\r\nsimply drove in his staff car to the Belgian lines, by amazing luck got\r\nthrough, drove straight to the entrance of the fortress, knocked, and\r\nwalked in. When the Belgian commander saw before him a German Colonel,\r\nhe assumed the game was up and surrendered. That won for Ludendorff the\r\nPour le Merite, Germany’s Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Hitler displayed indubitable personal courage.\r\nThat was when he arrested Captain Ernst Roehm, the head of his\r\n2,500,000 Storm Troops, on the famous June 30, 1934, the day of the\r\nBlood Purge. Roehm had been Hitler’s close, if not closest, personal\r\nassociate. I cannot use the word friend, because Hitler has never had\r\na friend. He was the only man in the party, in the world, as a matter\r\nof fact, with whom Hitler exchanged the intimate “Du” or “Thou.” We\r\nAmericans can never understand the significance of this continental\r\ncustom. If you are on “Du Fuss” or “Thou Footing” with another man, it\r\nmeans you are brothers, and it is taken very seriously indeed by all\r\nexcept the proletariat, who in the informal brotherhood of the working\r\nclasses, call each other indiscriminately “Thou.” But this intimacy of\r\nHitler and Roehm did not prevent Hitler from cold-bloodedly ordering\r\nhis friend’s execution when once Hitler had convinced himself Roehm was\r\nplotting treason. Cold blood is one of Hitler’s chief characteristics.\r\nIt reminds one of Robespierre.\r\n\r\nRoehm was hiding out with his staff at the hamlet of Wiessee, not far\r\nfrom Munich. His guards, heavily armed, had strictest orders to stop\r\neveryone, but _everyone_, and by that underlining emphasis in the\r\norders, _everyone_ was meant to include Hitler himself. Nevertheless,\r\non the fateful morning, Hitler with two automobiles containing among\r\nothers the canny Goebbels, several high SS officers, and a handful of\r\nSS gunmen, drove into Wiessee at daybreak, and when Roehm’s guards saw\r\nthe All-Highest, instead of stopping him they saluted “Heil Hitler!”\r\nThere was at least some bravery in Hitler’s daring to go personally to\r\narrest Roehm, surrounded by his bodyguards. Once he had penetrated the\r\nsentry lines, there was not much for Hitler to fear, especially not in\r\nhis personal encounter with Roehm. He found Roehm in bed with what they\r\ncall in German a _Lust Knabe_.\r\n\r\nRoehm was a barrel-chested, scar-faced desperado whose only two\r\nweaknesses were his homosexuality and drink. He had grown potbellied,\r\nand invariably woke with a hangover. He slept in a nightgown. When\r\nHitler flung open his bedroom door at daybreak and routed him out\r\nof bed, Roehm must have been distinctly at a disadvantage. There he\r\nstood, bleary-eyed, nightgowned, potbellied, before his Fuehrer roaring\r\ncharges of treason, yelling that he was under arrest, ordering him to\r\ndress and be quick about it.\r\n\r\nI passed through Munich on my way from Rome to Berlin to cover the\r\nBlood Purge the next night. From SS officers who boarded my train at\r\nMunich, via the good-looking Italian Wagon-Lit conductor who had been\r\nfrom time to time propositioned by Roehm, I learned that Major Buch,\r\nHitler’s chief SS executioner, had that evening gone to Roehm’s cell\r\nwhere a revolver had been left to let him commit suicide, and had shot\r\nRoehm as he cried, “Tell Adolf to come kill me if he has the nerve!”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is it true that Hitler is a homosexual?_\r\n\r\nA. No, it is not true. He came seriously under suspicion because of\r\nhis intimacy with Roehm, and because for so many years he tolerated\r\nthe blatant homosexuality of Roehm and his cohorts. This was a scandal\r\nso colossal that it surely has no counterpart in history. Roehm as\r\nthe head of 2,500,000 Storm Troops had surrounded himself with a\r\nstaff of perverts. His chiefs, men of the rank of Gruppenfuehrer or\r\nObergruppenfuehrer, commanding units of several hundred thousand Storm\r\nTroopers, were almost without exception homosexuals. Indeed, unless a\r\nStorm Troop officer were homosexual, he had no chance of advancement.\r\n\r\nAll this was known to every intelligent observer in Germany and of\r\ncourse was known in every detail to Hitler. His moral indignation when\r\nhe made his Blood Purge and cleaned out this “nest of immorality” was\r\none of his more brazen pieces of hypocrisy. He purged Roehm not on\r\naccount of his distasteful habits but because Roehm was plotting to\r\nseize power, make himself head of the Army, and form what would have\r\nbeen, incidentally, a homosexual government.\r\n\r\nNobody knows whether he intended to do away with Hitler or merely\r\nforce Hitler to go along with him. At any rate Hitler would have\r\nno part of it, and Roehm was killed, though not for his abnormal\r\nlove life. Thereafter Hitler passed the most stringent edicts\r\nagainst homosexuality and this odd feature of German life was driven\r\nunderground. It remains, nevertheless, characteristic of the Germans,\r\nthat they, outwardly the most brutally masculine of all European\r\npeoples, are the most homosexual nation on earth.\r\n\r\nNaturally because Hitler never showed any sign of interest in women,\r\nhe came under suspicion, but prolonged observation has convinced all\r\nthe witnesses I know, including Germans and foreigners, that Hitler is\r\nsimply asexual, has no sex life at all, or rather has sublimated it in\r\nhis “marriage to the German people.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How do you mean, “marriage to the German people”?_\r\n\r\nA. That is precisely the relationship Hitler conceives himself to have\r\nwith the Germans, and I must say millions of Germans appear to feel as\r\nthough they constituted his wife. Incidentally it was Lord D’Abernon,\r\nlong-time British Ambassador to Germany, who remarked that the world\r\ndid not properly understand the meaning of masculinity and femininity\r\nas applied to nations, and that in his opinion the Germans were the\r\nmost feminine people in Europe and the French the most masculine.\r\nWhether D’Abernon would today be of the same opinion, I do not know.\r\nAt any rate Hitler certainly obtains from his contact with the German\r\npeople a more than adequate surrogate for normal sex life.\r\n\r\nJust imagine what his feelings must be when he stands, as in peacetime\r\nhe used to stand, on the platform at the Tempelhofer Field in Berlin,\r\nand before him are a million Germans. This is the largest crowd that\r\nany man has ever had before him in person. You could never assemble\r\nsuch a crowd in a democracy, because it takes them twelve hours to\r\nmarch into place and twelve hours to march away.\r\n\r\nOn the night before the first of May, which the Nazis stole from\r\nthe Communists and Socialists and made their own Labor Day, the\r\nBerlin population is herded into line and marched off in battalions.\r\nEverything is meticulously arranged by a General Staff, so that by the\r\ntime Hitler appears one million persons, no less, are standing to hear\r\nhim. When Hitler appears, from a million throats roars the cry “Heil\r\nHitler! Heil! Heil! Heil!” time and time and time again.\r\n\r\nThen he speaks and at every possible opportunity comes again the bellow\r\nfrom a million German voices “Heil! Heil! Heil!” Sounds silly? Oh no,\r\nnot any more than the German goose step is silly. It looks silly only\r\nin the movies. In real life it is tremendously impressive--ten thousand\r\nsteel-shod boots striking the ground with all the force ten thousand\r\nmuscular legs can put into it. They shake the ground, and when the\r\nmillion Germans shout “Heil!” they make the firmament quiver. I defy\r\nanyone to hear such a mass yell without trembling at the sheer brute\r\npower of it.\r\n\r\nSuppose you were the recipient of this ovation! Hitler obtains his\r\nlife’s satisfaction from this sort of power orgasm. Now, of course, he\r\nhas the whole continent of Europe to trample upon. Every man who loves\r\npower for its own sake as Hitler does, has a strong streak of sadism,\r\nof enjoyment in the infliction of pain or humiliation upon others. So\r\nnow Hitler has a double stream of enjoyment in which to wallow. I do\r\nnot think he will ever marry.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Are women attracted to Hitler?_\r\n\r\nA. Soon after he came to power he had to pass an edict forbidding\r\nGerman women to crawl out of the crowd and attempt to kiss the hem of\r\nhis raincoat as he passed by. This was forbidden partially for the\r\nsame reason as the _Verbot_ against throwing flowers, which was issued\r\nbecause it would be easy to conceal a bomb in a bouquet. Whenever he\r\nappeared in public, scores of German women tried to get near enough to\r\nhim to touch his raincoat or come into some kind of personal contact\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nIt is, regrettably, impossible to record that this is a purely German\r\nphenomenon. An American woman distinguished herself at the Olympic\r\nGames, and incidentally brought about a disciplinary shake-up among\r\nHitler’s bodyguards, by brushing past his gunmen and kissing him on\r\nthe cheek. All this is, perhaps, only evidence of the traditional\r\nregard women have for strength, whether exhibited by the champion prize\r\nfighter, wrestler, chess master, millionaire, or by the Fuehrer of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _I have heard scores of you fellows, foreign correspondents and\r\nothers, say they “know the truth about Hitler,” and constantly\r\nrecommend that we find out what he means, but that seems to be a pretty\r\ncomplicated business, and we cannot all live in Germany long enough to\r\nfind out about it. Can you tell us in a few words just what he does\r\nmean, for us?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, in the fewest words: Hitler means exactly what he says. He\r\nsays the German people are a master race, destined to rule the world.\r\nHe says the German people have the power to enforce their rule on the\r\nworld. He intends that they shall rule the world during his lifetime.\r\nHe includes the United States in the world he intends to rule.\r\n\r\nFinally, he does have the power to carry out his world conquest unless\r\nwe fight him in time. That is the shortest way to put it. The reason\r\nyou think it hard to understand or find out what Hitler means is that\r\nyou refuse to believe these things because they upset you, and if\r\nyou believed them then you might have to work harder, or sacrifice\r\nsomething such as your automobile, or blood, or maybe your life. Read\r\n_Mein Kampf_. It is all there.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What kind of public speaker is Hitler? Is he truly a great orator?\r\nHow does he compare with others?_\r\n\r\nA. He is probably the greatest spellbinder of all time. He literally\r\ntalked himself into power in Germany and thereafter he talked the great\r\nGerman nation into becoming his blindly obedient and fanatically loyal\r\nHerculean slave. With his slave he has laid a continent in chains. But\r\nhe never delivered an oration in his life, because an oration according\r\nto Webster is “An elaborate discourse, delivered in public, treating an\r\nimportant subject in a formal and dignified manner,” and that Hitler\r\nnever did. In this respect, Goebbels is incomparably his superior.\r\n\r\nAn oration by Goebbels has a beginning, a middle, and a crescendo\r\nend; it has form, style, and the language is chosen, the gestures\r\nsparing but effective, the voice clear and only now and then distorted\r\nby passion. Hitler begins any old way, rambles, digresses, becomes\r\nexcited, rants, shouts until his voice is hoarse, and frequently breaks\r\ninto a falsetto scream.\r\n\r\nThe quality of Hitler’s voice is unpleasant. It is thick in the middle\r\nregister, guttural in the low, and its high notes are rasping. In\r\nevery speech at some time he becomes angry and then the tone is either\r\nterrifying or embarrassing to the listener, depending upon his relation\r\nto Hitler’s power. I speak, of course, of the foreign listener, as\r\nit would affect you if you understood German. His anger frequently\r\noverpowers him, but he never splutters, he roars. I sometimes felt as I\r\nlistened to him, and I have heard him fifty times or more, as though he\r\nwere a wild beast.\r\n\r\nThen he can shift in a twinkling to the tone of irony, contemptuous,\r\nderisive. Much of his speech is ungrammatical; many of his sentences\r\ndo not “read,” do not make German. He pays apparently no attention to\r\nthe structure of his speech. He sometimes ends so abruptly that his\r\naudience is shocked, having expected him to finish his thought, or even\r\ncomplete a sentence. His gestures are extravagant, and resemble those\r\nof an old-fashioned camp-meeting preacher. He mimics well, and delights\r\nin ridiculing his opponents by caricaturing them.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a rule of oratory he does not ignore. He is\r\nseldom dignified. All of this, of course, is in reference to his\r\nextemporaneous public speaking which brought him to power, not to the\r\nspeeches he reads, as he has read nearly everything since he took\r\npower. As Chancellor of the Reich he can read a speech with dignity,\r\nas he read the funeral oration over Hindenburg, which I heard in\r\nTannenberg.\r\n\r\nYet with all the criticism one can bring to bear on his public\r\nspeaking, he remains the most effective mob master ever to step on a\r\nplatform. He sweeps his audience with him. Sometimes they are slow to\r\ncome along, as the time when after seven days of slaughter in Germany\r\nhe rose in his own uniformed Reichstag to explain the Blood Purge of\r\nJune 30, 1934. That time he spoke for twenty minutes before he received\r\na single handclap. He had just killed more than a thousand people\r\nincluding leaders of his own party, Ernst Roehm, his closest friend\r\nand head of the 2,500,000 Storm Troops; Gregor Strasser, one-time\r\nrival for leadership of the Nazis; General Kurt von Schleicher, former\r\nReichs Chancellor, and his wife; Karl Ernst, head of the 250,000 Berlin\r\nand Brandenburg Storm Troopers; General von Lossow and former Reichs\r\nCommissar von Kahr of Bavaria, who had defeated his first effort at\r\nseizing power in Munich, and hundreds of others.\r\n\r\nThe nation was stunned; the Nazi Party itself was partially paralyzed\r\nwith fear. Hitler had turned his SS (_Schutzstaffel_) Black Guards\r\nagainst his SA (_Sturmabteilung_) Storm Troops, and hundreds of Brown\r\nShirt officers had died before the Black Shirt firing squads, many of\r\nthem shouting “Heil Hitler!” as they fell. Most of the members of the\r\nReichstag, that curious gesture of Hitler before democracy, were active\r\nor honorary officers in the Storm Troops. A score of seats were empty.\r\nTheir lawful occupants were dead. The survivors were appalled and not\r\nless bewildered than the public. Nobody knew what had happened; what to\r\nexpect. When Hitler began to speak, for the first time in his life he\r\nwas received in silence.\r\n\r\nAs I sat in the press gallery of the Kroll Opera House, I noted this\r\nwith amazement, but I felt the silence was that of stupefaction, not of\r\nindifference and certainly not of rejection. The listeners were simply\r\nstricken dumb. Yet the silence continued, for five, ten, fifteen,\r\ntwenty minutes. By then I began to think that Hitler might have made\r\na mistake, that perhaps his dummy Reichstag was actually disapproving\r\ntheir idol. Many of them had close friends among the dead. Then came\r\nthe breaking point. I think it was the most dramatic moment in any\r\nspeech I have ever heard of Hitler’s.\r\n\r\nIn his intolerably repetitious way he had started with a description\r\nof Germany’s suffering under the Versailles treaty, and under the\r\n“fourteen years of servitude to the traitors of November,” then\r\nsketched the events leading up to the Blood Purge, described his\r\ndiscovery of the plot against the State, and then with a leap he\r\nshifted into his most passionate style. He had come to the moment of\r\nordering the executions. Raising his right hand, forefinger pointed on\r\nhigh, he stood on his toes and roared: “_Meine Herren_, at that moment\r\n_I_ was the Supreme Court of Germany; _I_ was the Supreme Judge of\r\nGermany; _I_ was Germany!”\r\n\r\nThe silence in the Reichstag broke, and as though hypnotized, the 500\r\nBrown-Shirted members roared: “Heil! Heil! Heil!” There, they had\r\nrecognized their master. He had spoken as a master. He had consented\r\nagain to be their master, and from a mood of bewilderment and fear they\r\nburst into the joyful acknowledgment of their abasement. Forgotten were\r\nthe friendships with the dead, blotted out in the keen pleasure of\r\nhearing the crack of the lash. From then on his lengthy accounting was\r\nconstantly punctuated by the traditional applause.\r\n\r\nIncidentally it might be pointed out here that there is after all a\r\nvery significant difference between the tyrants of long ago and the\r\ntyrants of today. It is a fact that the tyrants of today exercise\r\ngreater power over the lives of their subjects than any we can\r\nrecollect from former times. Historians have to search to find a\r\nPtolemy, a Caesar, or a Mongol Khan who had so complete a discipline\r\nover their populations, so profound a control over the individual lives\r\nof their subjects as have the despots of the modern totalitarian states.\r\n\r\nBut all the modern despots find it necessary to report to their\r\nsubjects, to speak and explain, to take them into their alleged\r\nconfidence, however mendacious the report may be. They find it\r\nexpedient, no matter how they spurn the principles of democracy, to\r\npretend to treat their subjects as free to exercise a judgment. Why\r\nelse does Hitler constantly come before his people to talk? In the\r\nwestern tyrannies of antiquity and the Middle Ages, in the European\r\nmonarchies of divine right and in the Oriental despotisms, the rulers\r\nconsidered it unnecessary to deliver an accounting to their people.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that the short experience the world has had with\r\ndemocracy, not yet two hundred years in duration, has left with the\r\nmost imperious ruler a sense of responsibility to the ruled, or is it\r\nmerely fear? Hitler despises the masses, I know. But he fears them\r\nalso. If Louis XVI had possessed a fraction of Hitler’s speaking\r\ntalent, or King Charles of England, or Czar Nicholas of Russia, perhaps\r\nthey might have had a different fate.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to _Mein Kampf_ Hitler indicates the paramount\r\nimportance he attaches to the art of political speaking. He wrote: “I\r\nknow that one is able to win people far more by the spoken than by the\r\nwritten word, and that every great movement on this globe owes its rise\r\nto the great speakers and not to the great writers.” He then wrote a\r\nbook of 1,000 pages which is said by now to have been distributed to\r\neight million people, but it was still the spoken word. He dictated\r\nevery line of it. You ask, what kind of public speaker is Hitler? I\r\nanswer, read _Mein Kampf_.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of a man named Korff. Korff was the brains of the\r\nUllstein Verlag, pre-Hitler Germany’s greatest publishing concern.\r\nKorff originated the _Berliner Illustrierte_, first of the world’s\r\ngreat picture weeklies, forerunner of _Life_, and _Look_, and the\r\nFrench _Match_. He raised his _Berliner Illustrierte_ to more than two\r\nmillion circulation, undreamed of on the continent before. His salary\r\nwas record breaking, his prestige likewise.\r\n\r\nOne day in 1931, more than a year before Hitler came to power, Korff\r\ncame before his board of directors and said, “Gentlemen, I’m through.\r\nI am going to resign. I wish you to release me and to make your\r\narrangements accordingly.” Astounded, the board asked why. “Because\r\nI’ve read the book, gentlemen,” replied Korff. “What book?” they asked.\r\n“_Mein Kampf_,” Korff said, and began to explain, but couldn’t on\r\naccount of the laughter. Dear old Korff had to have his joke. But no,\r\nit was not a joke. Korff resigned, liquidated his property, got out\r\nof Germany and in 1933 when Hitler came to power the Nazis bought out\r\nUllstein’s at forced sale.\r\n\r\nThe laughing members of the board and stockholders--those not yet dead,\r\nshot attempting to escape, or hanged by their belts in concentration\r\ncamp--received a fraction of one per cent of the value of their\r\nholding. Of all the house of Ullstein, only the man who read the book\r\nescaped. I advise you to read the book.\r\n\r\nAs an orator, Hitler has many superiors. I have mentioned Goebbels in\r\nGermany. Trotzky was certainly better. I heard Trotzky speak in Moscow\r\nthe last time he ever appeared on a Russian platform. It was in 1926.\r\nHe had been in disgrace for more than a year, but was allowed to speak\r\non the innocuous theme, “The United Sates of America and Siberia,” a\r\nlecture with paid admissions. The proceeds were to go to the benefit\r\nof needy students of Moscow University. Why Stalin allowed it I do\r\nnot know, but he never permitted a return engagement, for Trotzky’s\r\npopularity proved so great that the mounted police had to be called\r\nout to move the crowds which, despite the exorbitant admission price,\r\njammed the street before the lecture hall.\r\n\r\nI paid thirty roubles for a balcony seat. It was worth the price.\r\nTrotzky appeared, dapper in a light-gray whipcord suit, and for an hour\r\nand a half in Russian which I only faintly understood, moved me and the\r\nthree thousand other listeners to intense appreciation of his forensic\r\ntalents. I was surprised to hear Trotzky’s voice, a clear high tenor.\r\nI had expected a deeper, more rotund tone. They said, however, that\r\nthe clarity of his delivery and its carrying power were such that he\r\nalone among Bolshevik orators could speak in the Red Square and without\r\na microphone be heard by half a million listeners. Without being able\r\nto understand more than one word in ten, as at that time I had been\r\nin Russia less than a year, I was nevertheless convinced by this one\r\nhearing of Trotzky that he was one of history’s greatest orators.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What sort of eyes has Hitler? Are they magnetic? What color are\r\nthey?_\r\n\r\nA. It seems to depend on who is looking at them. I noticed that Francis\r\nHackett in his useful book, _What Mein Kampf Means to America_, cites\r\nthree descriptions of Hitler’s eyes, all different. Otto Tolischus\r\ncalls them “small, greenish brown and almost poetically introspective\r\neyes.” William D. Bayes calls them “faded blue eyes between colorless\r\nbrows and puffy sallow cheeks.” John McCutcheon Raleigh wrote: “The\r\nfanaticism in his eyes was the most commanding thing about him ... they\r\npossess a hypnotic quality that can easily persuade his followers to do\r\nanything the mind behind the eyes desires.”\r\n\r\nThese differences evoked from Mr. Hackett the remark: “If you want\r\nto feel discouraged about the art of reporting, consider these three\r\naccounts of Hitler’s eyes.” But what about these additions? Dorothy\r\nThompson says in her interview, reprinted in _Dictators and Democrats_:\r\n“The eyes alone were notable. Dark gray and hyperthyroid, they have\r\nthe peculiar shine which often distinguishes geniuses, alcoholics and\r\nhysterics.” In the same book Lothrop Stoddard writes: “His eyes are\r\nvery dark blue.” Likewise, in the same compilation, I have reported\r\nthat “He fixed his flat, non-magnetic, China-blue eyes on me....” I\r\nwill stick to my version. His eyes were certainly not magnetic as far\r\nas I was concerned, though I am convinced they would be highly magnetic\r\nto any German. As for the color, they are of such an intermediate,\r\nshifting shade that it may well be they could show in different lights\r\nall the way from greenish brown, faded blue, dark gray, dark blue, to\r\nChina blue.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is Hitler really the tough man he claims to be? I remember he was\r\nreported in a recent speech to have remarked: “I am the hardest man\r\never to rule Germany.”_\r\n\r\nA. When a man talks too much about his strength, it may mean he is not\r\nso strong after all. Francis Hackett sorted out in his index of _Mein\r\nKampf_ all the references to “Qualities, concepts or practises Hitler\r\napproves,” and to the ones he disapproves. The two lists throw a good\r\ndeal of light on Hitler’s character, or rather on what he thinks his\r\ncharacter ought to be.\r\n\r\nThe things Hitler approves are: First, “Advance by sections,” by which\r\nhe means that to achieve, one must concentrate upon one goal at a time,\r\nas he has brilliantly exemplified in his conduct of the war so far.\r\nThen in alphabetic order, Hitler approves: “Brutality; Discipline;\r\nExecutions for Treason; Faith; Fanaticism; Force; Hardness; Idealism;\r\nJoy in responsibility; Loyalty; Obedience; Passion; Perseverance;\r\nRuthlessness; Sacrifice; Self-preservation; Self-sufficiency, national;\r\nSilence and discretion; Social justice; Social responsibility;\r\nTerrorism; Toughness; Will power and determination.”\r\n\r\nHitler condemns: “Cowardice; Eroticism; Half measures; Humaneness;\r\nLiberty; Pacifism; Passive resistance.”\r\n\r\nMy impression is that of the qualities he named, Hitler possesses\r\nbrutality, discipline, faith, fanaticism, force, hardness, idealism,\r\njoy in responsibility, passion, perseverance, ruthlessness, sacrifice,\r\ndiscretion, terrorism, will power and determination; but that he does\r\nnot possess loyalty or a true sense of social justice, or social\r\nresponsibility, or toughness. He is hard without being tough. That\r\nis, I believe he will one day prove brittle. As for loyalty, he is\r\nnotoriously able to discard a lifelong friend, and if necessary kill\r\nhim, as he did Roehm, without visible compunction.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is the secret of Hitler’s power?_\r\n\r\nA. That is a question that has interested me for eighteen years,\r\nsince I first saw Hitler and heard him speak. During all this time I\r\nhave heard hundreds of explanations of his power and have thought of\r\nsome myself. But the most interesting and plausible discussion of his\r\npersonality I have ever heard was given me by Dr. Carl G. Jung, the\r\ngreat Swiss psychiatrist, when I visited him in his home in Zurich\r\nto ask him to diagnose the dictators. It was in October 1938, and\r\nI had come directly from Prague where I had witnessed the death of\r\nCzechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nDr. Jung’s analysis of Hitler has been remarkably confirmed by the\r\nevents since that time. He had been personally fascinated by the\r\nproblem of Hitler’s personality, and had studied it for years. He said:\r\n“There were two types of strong men in primitive society. One was the\r\nchief who was physically powerful, stronger than all his competitors,\r\nand another was the medicine man who was not strong in himself but was\r\nstrong by reason of the power which the people projected into him. Thus\r\nwe had the Emperor and the Pope.\r\n\r\n“Hitler belongs in the category of the truly mystic medicine man. His\r\nbody does not suggest strength. The outstanding characteristic of his\r\nphysiognomy is its dreamy look. I was especially struck by that when I\r\nsaw pictures taken of him in the Czechoslovakian crisis; there was in\r\nhis eyes the look of a seer.”\r\n\r\nI asked, “Why is it that Hitler who makes nearly every German fall down\r\nand worship him, produces next to no impression on any foreigner?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” Dr. Jung assented. “Few foreigners respond at all, yet\r\napparently every German in Germany does. It is because Hitler is the\r\nmirror of every German’s unconscious, but of course he mirrors nothing\r\nfrom a non-German.\r\n\r\n“He is the loud-speaker which magnifies the inaudible whispers of the\r\nGerman soul until they can be heard by the German’s conscious ear. He\r\nis the first man to tell every German what he has been thinking and\r\nfeeling all along in his unconscious about German fate, especially\r\nsince the defeat in the World War, and the one characteristic which\r\ncolors every German soul is the typically German inferiority complex,\r\nthe complex of the younger brother, of the one who is always a bit late\r\nto the feast. Hitler’s power is not political; it is _magic_.\r\n\r\n“To understand magic you must understand what the unconscious is. It is\r\nthat part of our mental constitution over which we have little control\r\nand which is stored with all sorts of impressions and sensations;\r\nwhich contains thoughts and even conclusions of which we are not\r\naware. Besides the conscious impressions which we receive, there are\r\nall sorts of impressions constantly impinging upon our sense organs of\r\nwhich we do not become aware because they are too slight to attract our\r\nconscious attention. They lie beneath the threshold of consciousness.\r\nBut all these subliminal impressions are recorded; nothing is lost.\r\nSomeone may be speaking in a faintly audible voice in the next room\r\nwhile we are talking here. You pay no attention to it, but the\r\nconversation next door is being recorded in your unconscious as surely\r\nas though the latter were a dictaphone record.\r\n\r\n“Now the secret of Hitler’s power is not that Hitler has an\r\nunconscious more plentifully stored than yours or mine. Hitler’s secret\r\nis twofold; first, that his unconscious has exceptional access to his\r\nconsciousness, and second, that he allows himself to be moved by it.\r\nHe is like a man who listens intently to a stream of suggestions in a\r\nwhispered voice from a mysterious source, and then _acts upon them_.\r\n\r\n“In our case, even if occasionally our unconscious does reach us\r\nthrough dreams, we have too much rationality, too much cerebrum to obey\r\nit--but Hitler listens and obeys. The true leader is always _led_.\r\n\r\n“We can see it work in him. He himself has referred to his Voice.\r\nHis Voice is nothing other than his own unconscious, into which the\r\nGerman people have projected their own selves; that is, the unconscious\r\nof seventy-eight million Germans. That is what makes him powerful.\r\nWithout the German people he would be nothing. It is literally true\r\nwhen he says that whatever he is able to do is only because he has the\r\nGerman people behind him, or, as he sometimes says, because he _is_\r\nGermany. So with his unconscious being the receptacle of the souls of\r\nseventy-eight million Germans, he is powerful, and with his unconscious\r\nperception of the true balance of political forces at home and in the\r\nworld, he has so far been infallible.\r\n\r\n“That is why he makes political judgments which turn out to be right\r\nagainst the opinions of all his advisors and against the opinions\r\nof all foreign observers. When this happens it means only that the\r\ninformation gathered by his unconscious, and reaching his consciousness\r\nby means of his exceptional talent, has been more nearly correct than\r\nthat of all others, German or foreign, who attempted to judge the\r\nsituation and who reached conclusions different from his.”\r\n\r\nI remarked that if Hitler’s Voice continued to be always right, we were\r\nin for a very interesting period. This was five months before Hitler\r\nswallowed the whole of Czechoslovakia, and eleven months before he\r\nlaunched the Second World War by assaulting Poland.\r\n\r\nDr. Jung gravely answered: “Yes, it seems that the German people are\r\nnow convinced they have found their Messiah. In a way the position of\r\nthe Germans is remarkably like that of the Jews of old.\r\n\r\n“Since their defeat in the World War the Germans have awaited a\r\nMessiah, a Savior. That is characteristic of people with an inferiority\r\ncomplex. The Jews got their inferiority complex from geographical and\r\npolitical factors. They lived in a part of the world which was a parade\r\nground for conquerors from both sides, and after their return from\r\ntheir first exile to Babylon, when they were threatened with extinction\r\nby the Romans, they invented the solacing idea of a Messiah who was\r\ngoing to bring all the Jews together into a nation once more and save\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“The Germans got their inferiority complex from comparable causes. They\r\ncame up out of the Danube Valley too late, and founded the beginnings\r\nof their nation long after the French and English were well on their\r\nway to nationhood. They were too late for the scramble for colonies\r\nand for the foundation of empire. Then when they did get together and\r\nmade a unified nation, they looked around them and saw the British, the\r\nFrench, and others with rich colonies and all the equipment of grown-up\r\nnations and they became jealous, resentful, like a younger brother\r\nwhose older brothers have taken the lion’s share of the inheritance.\r\n\r\n“So the Germans slept through the division of the world into colonial\r\nempires and thus they got their inferiority complex which made them\r\nwant to fight the World War; and of course when they lost it their\r\nfeeling of inferiority grew even worse and developed a desire for\r\na Messiah, and so they have their Hitler. If he is not their true\r\nMessiah, he is like one of the Old Testament prophets; his mission is\r\nto unite his people and lead them to the Promised Land. This explains\r\nwhy the Nazis have to combat every other form of religion besides\r\ntheir own idolatrous brand. I have no doubt but that the campaign\r\nagainst the Catholic and Protestant churches will be pursued with\r\nrelentless and unremitting vigor, for the very sound reason, from the\r\nNazi point of view, that they wish to substitute the new faith of\r\nHitlerism.”\r\n\r\nI asked Dr. Jung: “Do you consider it possible that Hitlerism\r\nmight become for Germany a permanent religion for the future, like\r\nMohammedanism for the Moslems?”\r\n\r\n“I think it is highly possible,” Dr. Jung replied. “Hitler’s ‘religion’\r\nis the nearest to Mohammedanism, realistic, earthy, promising the\r\nmaximum of rewards in this life, but with a Moslem-like Valhalla into\r\nwhich worthy Germans may enter and continue to enjoy themselves. Like\r\nMohammedanism, it teaches the _virtue_ of the sword. Hitler’s first\r\nidea is to make his people powerful because the spirit of the Aryan\r\nGerman deserves to be supported by might, by muscle and steel. It\r\nis not a spiritual religion in the sense in which we ordinarily use\r\nthe term. But remember that in the early days of Christianity it was\r\nthe church which made the claim to total power, both spiritual and\r\ntemporal. Today the church no longer makes this claim, but the claim\r\nhas been taken over by the totalitarian states which demand not only\r\ntemporal but spiritual power.\r\n\r\n“Incidentally it occurs to me that the religious character of Hitlerism\r\nis also emphasized by the fact that the German communities throughout\r\nthe world far from the political power of Berlin, have adopted\r\nHitlerism. Look at South America.”\r\n\r\nDr. Jung said he had closely observed Hitler at his meeting with\r\nMussolini in Berlin. “I was only a few yards away from the two men and\r\ncould study them well. In comparison with Mussolini, Hitler made upon\r\nme the impression of a sort of scaffolding of wood covered with cloth,\r\nan automaton with a mask, like a robot or a mask of a robot. During the\r\nwhole performance he never laughed; it was as though he were in a bad\r\nhumor, sulking. He showed no human sign.\r\n\r\n“His expression was that of an inhumanly single-minded purposiveness,\r\nwith no sense of humor. He seemed as if he might be a double of a real\r\nperson, and that Hitler the man might perhaps be hiding inside like\r\nan appendix, and deliberately so hiding in order not to disturb the\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\n“With Hitler you do not feel that you are with a man. You are with a\r\nmedicine man, a form of spiritual vessel, a demi-deity, or even better,\r\na myth. With Hitler you are scared. You know you would never be able to\r\ntalk to that man; because there is nobody there. He is not a man, but\r\na collective. He is not an individual, but a whole nation. I take it\r\nto be literally true that he has no personal friend. How can you talk\r\nintimately with a nation?”\r\n\r\nFinally Dr. Jung delivered a prophecy which was to prove woefully\r\naccurate just five months later. “England and France,” he said, “will\r\nnot honor their new guarantee to Czechoslovakia any more than France\r\nhonored her previous pledge to Czechoslovakia. No nation keeps its\r\nword. A nation is a big, blind worm, following what? Fate perhaps. A\r\nnation has no honor, it has no word to keep. That is the reason why\r\nin the old days, they tried to have kings who did possess personal\r\nhonor, and a word. But you know if you choose one hundred of the most\r\nintelligent people and get them all together, they are a stupid mob?\r\nTen thousand of them together would have the collective intelligence\r\nof an alligator. Haven’t you noticed at a dinner party that the more\r\npeople you invite the more stupid the conversation? In a crowd, the\r\nqualities which everybody possesses multiply, pile up, and become the\r\ndominant characteristics of the whole crowd.\r\n\r\n“Not everybody has virtues, but everybody has the low animal instincts,\r\nthe basic primitive caveman suggestibility, the suspicious and vicious\r\ntraits of the savage. The result is that when you get a nation of\r\nmany millions of people, it is not even human. It is a lizard or a\r\ncrocodile, or a wolf. Its statesmen cannot have a higher morality than\r\nthe animal-like mass morality of the nation, although individual\r\nstatesmen of the democratic states may attempt to behave a little\r\nbetter. For Hitler, however, more than for any other statesman in the\r\nmodern world, it would be impossible to expect that he should keep the\r\nword of Germany against her interest, in any international bargain,\r\nagreement, or treaty. Because Hitler is the nation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Isn’t there anything constructive about Hitlerism? Is it all\r\ndestructive? Won’t they get over their period of madness and settle\r\ndown and make good world citizens?_\r\n\r\nA. In 1934 I talked with President Thomas G. Masaryk of Czechoslovakia\r\nin the old Hradzin Palace in Prague. The venerable statesman was\r\neighty-four years old, but he was still able to deliver measured\r\nphilosophical replies. One of them was to the question: “Aren’t you\r\nas head of the Republic of Czechoslovakia which Hitler and his Nazis\r\nthreaten so violently, afraid he may some day attack you?” The old\r\nman slowly replied, “No, because every revolutionary movement such as\r\nthe Nazis’ has its period of ecstasy, and the Nazis are going through\r\ntheirs now, but in a little while more they will subside and we will be\r\nable to get along peaceably with them.”\r\n\r\nI went away with my first example of the fact that no man over seventy\r\never seems to be able to understand Hitler. I beg the pardon of the\r\ngrand exception, Senator Glass, whose early and persistent advocacy of\r\neffective action against Hitler has distinguished him among Senators,\r\nsome of whom approach treason in their imbecilic refusal to comprehend\r\nthe life-and-death issue facing America.\r\n\r\nJust five years after the founder of Czechoslovakia had expressed\r\nhis faith in the fundamental normality of the Nazis, his conviction\r\nthat they were after all like other people, and that their revolution\r\nwould follow the natural course of other radical movements and become\r\nstabilized, Hitler sat at the very desk in the Hradzin where Masaryk\r\nhad sat. Czechoslovakia had ceased to exist precisely because Masaryk\r\nand all the other heads of states in Europe blindly refused to see\r\nthat in Hitlerism the world was faced with a brute which always had to\r\nmove forward, steadily became bigger and hungrier as it was fed, and\r\nwould never cease to destroy and devour until stopped by force. To the\r\nGerman there is something mystically attractive about this Nazi Wave\r\nof Destruction. They feel their fate is being achieved by violence so\r\nfierce that it intoxicates them, as the young Nazi Shock Troops are\r\nintoxicated by battle lust when they fling themselves upon the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is the Nazis’ ability to combine this berserk, mystic rage with cold\r\nscientific mastery of the intricate instruments of mechanized war that\r\nmakes them so formidable. They even loot scientifically, as witness the\r\nway they have bled France. I know an amusing and typical example of the\r\nGerman’s aptitude for plundering profitably.\r\n\r\nIn Spain I met a young German Nazi machine gunner serving with Franco.\r\nHis name was Franz, and he had been an SS officer in Duesseldorf. He\r\nhad come to Spain, he declared, for idealistic motives, to fight the\r\nBolsheviks, and now after three months’ service his idealism had been\r\nrewarded with a small fortune. I asked him how he had been able to make\r\nany money serving as a noncommissioned officer.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he explained, “I have the advantage over these Spaniards and\r\nMoors of having an academic education. I did not finish school but I\r\nhad enough _Naturwissenschaft_ to know my way about in a physics or\r\nchemistry laboratory. Now what do these poor ignorant Spaniards and\r\nMoors do when they enter a town we have just taken. They go busting\r\naround breaking into homes and offices, looking for cash and jewelry\r\nand such things, but nobody ever leaves cash and jewelry lying around.\r\nWhat do I do? I go straight to the _Kino_, the motion picture theater,\r\nand straight to the projection room, and there I remove the lenses\r\nwhich are worth from ten to twenty thousand pesetas, and I put the\r\nlenses in my suitcase when I get back, and now I have two suitcases\r\nfull of lenses. They are worth a fortune. You see the beauties of\r\neducation?”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How has Hitler run his show without money, without gold, without\r\nforeign exchange? Can the Nazi economy continue to run indefinitely on\r\nits present basis?_\r\n\r\nA. The Nazi economy can continue to run only as long as the war lasts.\r\nThis is the economic compulsion on Hitler to go on fighting. The Nazi\r\neconomy is one of scarcity. There are not enough workers, since most\r\nable-bodied men are in the army; not enough food, or clothing, or\r\nfuel, or manufactured articles. Everybody not in the armed forces has\r\nto work very hard, very long hours in order to feed the colossal war\r\nmachine and produce the minimum necessary for the civilians to subsist.\r\nScarcity would normally shove prices upward; but not in the Nazi\r\neconomy where the Terror makes price control really work. The Gestapo\r\nis a more potent backing for the currency than gold. The workings of a\r\ntotalitarian economy seem queer to us only because we continue to think\r\nof Adam Smith’s “economic man,” and because we still believe that man\r\nwill always act freely in accord with the law of supply and demand.\r\nBut man under the Nazis is not free, does not act according to the law\r\nof supply and demand but according to the Nazi law. This compulsion by\r\nTerror makes a different kind of economic unit of him; our economic\r\nlaws do not apply to him any more. In our bourgeois society when civil\r\nlaw condemns a man to go hungry, appetite is likely to make him break\r\nthe law. In the totalitarian state the punishments of the concentration\r\ncamp subdue almost every impulse to rebel.\r\n\r\nFor foreign trade the Nazis use an infinitely flexible, complex system\r\nof barter, often three-way. They confidently assert they have outgrown\r\nthe use of gold; although one of the reasons Walther Darre advanced\r\nfor a Nazi conquest of America was to lay hands on the American gold\r\nreserve at Fort Knox. The Nazis have demonstrated that they can do\r\nwithout gold, but this is no proof that gold is not more convenient\r\nthan barter; it is proof only that anything can be used for money\r\nas long as the people believe in it, by natural inclination or by\r\ncompulsion--wampum, cows, brass, paper, or the muzzle of a Gestapo\r\npistol. It is one of our commonest fallacies to believe that financial\r\nconsiderations affect very much the beginning or the middle or the end\r\nof a war. Can you recall any war that had to stop because one side ran\r\nout of money? In wartime a nation becomes a collective and money a\r\nmere bookkeeping item. Only after the war when accounts are presented,\r\ndoes bankruptcy become real. Hitler inherited a bankrupt, bourgeois,\r\npeacetime economy and turned it overnight, from the moment he came to\r\npower in 1933, into a wartime economy. Real peace would mean the total\r\ncollapse of Hitler’s totalitarian economic machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why do the Nazis call theirs the Third Reich?_\r\n\r\nA. Historically the First Reich was the Holy Roman Empire, the second\r\nwas the one founded by Bismarck, and the third is Hitler’s. When I\r\ndiscussed this once with Dr. Jung, he pointed out deeper meanings.\r\nHe said, “Nobody called Charlemagne’s kingdom the First Reich, nor\r\nWilliam’s the Second Reich. Only the Nazis call theirs the Third Reich,\r\nbecause it has a profound _mystical_ meaning.”\r\n\r\nDr. Jung said the Nazis feel a parallel between the Biblical triad,\r\nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the _Third_ Reich, and that in fact\r\nmany Nazis refer to Hitler as the Holy Ghost. “Again,” Dr. Jung\r\ncontinued, “consider the widespread revival in the Third Reich of\r\nthe cult of Wotan, God of Wind. Take the name _Sturmabteilung_,\r\nStorm Troops. The swastika is a revolving form making a vortex moving\r\never toward the left--which means in Buddhistic symbolism sinister,\r\nunfavorable, directed toward the unconscious. All these symbols of a\r\nThird Reich led by its prophet under the banners of wind and storm\r\nand whirling vortices point to a mass movement which is to sweep the\r\nGerman people in a hurricane of unreasoning emotion on to a destiny\r\nwhich perhaps none but the seer, the prophet, the Fuehrer himself can\r\nforetell--and perhaps not even he.”\r\n\r\nThis psychiatric explanation of the Nazi names and symbols may sound\r\nto a layman fantastic, but can anything be as fantastic as the bare\r\nfacts about the Nazi Party and its Fuehrer? Be sure there is much\r\nmore to be explained in them than can be explained by merely calling\r\nthem gangsters. They are products of that most hysterical, illogical,\r\nemotional mentality in Europe, the German.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But I thought the Germans were stolid, phlegmatic, sensible people.\r\nHow can you describe them as hysterical?_\r\n\r\nA. The commonest mistake the outside world makes about the Germans\r\nis to describe them the way you have done. We Americans seem to\r\nhave judged most European nations exactly opposite from what they\r\nreally are. We consider the Italian to be emotional, easily swayed,\r\nthe Frenchman to be volatile, the Spaniard passionate, and so on.\r\nWell, all the Latin races are models of calm, common sense and\r\nmiddle-of-the-road, essentially stable people compared with the\r\nGermans. As Dr. Jung put it, “The Italians are stable. Their minds do\r\nnot roll and wallow and leap and plunge through all the extravagant\r\necstasies which are the daily exercise of the German mind.” The Germans\r\ncarry everything to excess.\r\n\r\nWhat other nation in Europe would have been inundated in one decade by\r\na wave of hysteria which was to sweep them into idolatrous worship\r\nof a former building-trades laborer and corporal and lift them into\r\nconquest of the entire continent of Europe and promise the conquest of\r\nthe world? Surely this is the most extraordinary yielding by a great\r\npeople to a mass emotion ever observed in our so-called civilized world.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, the first time that similar things have happened\r\nin Germany. Hitler has had some notable predecessors in the turbulent\r\nperiod of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe Anabaptists of Munster were forerunners of the Nazis, and their\r\nFuehrer, John of Leyden, was a figure comparable to Hitler in ambition\r\nand in his mystic hold over his followers. Leyden and his associates\r\nseized the city of Munster in Westphalia in 1532 and, establishing a\r\ntotalitarian theocracy, set out to conquer the world and make Munster\r\nits capital. Is that any more or less fantastic than Adolf Hitler,\r\nsetting out to proceed from Munich to the conquest of the world?\r\n\r\nJohn of Leyden differed in one respect, however, from Hitler. He\r\nnot only encouraged polygamy as Hitler’s Black Guards encourage\r\npromiscuity, but he had four wives of his own, one of whom he, in a\r\ntypically Hitlerian fit of rage, beheaded with his own hand in the\r\nmarket place. Munster for three years was the scene of excesses,\r\nprofligacy, and inhuman tortures committed upon the foes of the\r\nmedieval Nazis, until they were finally overcome by a coalition of\r\noutraged neighbors, comparable in a smaller way, one might say, to the\r\npresent coalition against the Third Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Doesn’t the life of Hitler, as far as we know it, show that he\r\nsuffered very much from poverty in his youth and then when Germany was\r\ndefeated, he suffered along with his fellow Germans so deeply that we\r\nought to be able to understand and forgive instead of hating and making\r\nwar upon him?_\r\n\r\nA. That seems the equivalent of appealing for sympathy and\r\nunderstanding for a mad dog, because the poor dog had been bitten and\r\ngiven rabies without wanting it. It was not his fault, and he had\r\nsuffered from it, so why shoot him? Hitler, we know, did suffer as a\r\nyouth from many disabilities, including extreme poverty, and we ought\r\nto be sorry that he did, not merely as Christians from love of our\r\nneighbor, but because Hitler is causing us such infinite trouble and\r\nmisery, partially perhaps, on account of these early discomforts.\r\n\r\nBut we can do nothing to correct Hitler’s personal history. By the time\r\nhe came into our lives his character was fixed in rigid, implacable\r\nhatred for every human being on earth not willing or suitable to help\r\nhim place Deutschland in command of the world with himself the globe’s\r\nsupreme ruler. He is as little susceptible to reformation today as a\r\nrattlesnake. As for the German people and their sufferings after the\r\ndefeat in the last war, there are several things to say.\r\n\r\nFirst, they did not suffer nearly so much as a nation usually suffers\r\nafter losing a four-years’ war. I can testify to that from personal\r\nobservation of the Germans from 1923 on, a period including the most\r\ndesperate months of the inflation. It is simply not correct to say\r\nas Hackett says about the Germans after the war, “They were just as\r\nunhappy, as despairing and as demoralized, in the midst of their\r\nReconstruction Period, as the old South in the years after the Civil\r\nWar.”\r\n\r\nThe old South was physically devastated by the war. Germany surrendered\r\nbefore the enemy reached her territory; she came off materially\r\nscot-free. The people of the old South felt permanently beaten and for\r\na long time hopeless because they had failed in their attempt to defend\r\ntheir right to be independent. The people of Germany felt temporarily\r\nfrustrated of their ambition to dominate the world; just twenty years\r\nlater they set forth to try it again. Do you think the old South, if it\r\nhad wanted to do so, would have been able physically or economically\r\nto have resumed the struggle with the North in 1885, twenty years after\r\nthe end of the Civil War, as the Germans did with the Allies in 1939,\r\ntwenty years after Versailles?\r\n\r\nMy second point about the German suffering is that before Versailles\r\nthey demonstrated their intention in the treaties of Bucharest and\r\nBrest-Litovsk, to inflict upon their enemies terms incomparably more\r\nsevere than Versailles.\r\n\r\nThird, in the course of the present war the Germans have proved that\r\nthe sort of peace they intend to grant the countries they vanquish now\r\nwill make the Versailles treaty appear to be a dispensation from Heaven.\r\n\r\nFourth, although these facts do not of course excuse the flaws in\r\nthe Versailles treaty, none of its defects could possibly excuse the\r\nbestial behavior of the Germans toward the especial objects of their\r\npathological antipathy, the Jews, Czechs, and Poles, nor provide a\r\nreasonable basis for their desire to inflict vengeance upon the entire\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFinally, it makes no difference what the reasons for present German\r\nbehavior are, that behavior threatens to destroy us and unless we check\r\nit by force, we shall perish.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What should we do with Hitler after we beat him? Will he be allowed\r\nto escape to a lifetime of comfort the way Kaiser Wilhelm did?_\r\n\r\nA. When this question is asked I am reminded of an old Texas recipe for\r\ncooking rabbit. It begins, “First catch your rabbit.” I do not know\r\nwhat will be done with Hitler. There are many people who say he will\r\nnever be taken alive; that he will commit suicide. I do not believe\r\nthat. My guess is that Hitler would either “do a Hess” and escape to\r\nEngland or seek death in battle as the Kaiser once claimed he would do.\r\n\r\nIf he remains alive, our people being incurably sentimental, we should\r\nprobably treat him the way the Allies treated Napoleon after Leipzig.\r\nThey sent him, as you may remember, to Elbe, and gave him an annual\r\nincome of 2,000,000 francs, which was about $400,000 and equivalent to\r\n$1,000,000 in purchasing power today. Perhaps we would not, though,\r\nespecially if the American people have to live through a great deal of\r\nhardship and bloodletting on account of this man. Maybe we will become\r\nlike the British, who, after all, are going to have something to say\r\nabout the fate of Hitler if and when he is ever caught.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Mail_ of London ran a questionnaire asking its readers what\r\nthey thought should be done with Hitler after the war. The largest\r\nnumber, twenty-five per cent, wanted him shown about the country in a\r\ncage. This is an idea which had been suggested for the former Kaiser,\r\nand it shows a surprising insight into the source of the deepest\r\nemotions for extremely vain men of the type of Hitler and the Kaiser;\r\nthey certainly would suffer more from such public humiliation than from\r\nany other punishment.\r\n\r\nAnother twenty per cent wanted him executed by hanging, shooting, or\r\nbeheading, in that order. Fifteen per cent wanted him exiled to remote,\r\nunpleasant places, as Devil’s Island, the Andaman Islands, Ascension\r\nIsland, Arctic wastes, and the African desert. Another fifteen per cent\r\nwanted him condemned to lifelong solitary confinement. Ten per cent\r\nwanted to make him live the rest of his life under the same conditions\r\nthe English are living under now, with bombs, rationing, and so on.\r\nFive per cent wanted to hand him over to the Poles or Jews. Five per\r\ncent would have him treated as a certified lunatic.\r\n\r\nFive per cent suggested all sorts of miscellaneous treatment, including\r\nconfinement under precisely the same conditions as normally obtain\r\nin a Nazi torture chamber. There were no suggestions at all that he\r\nshould be treated well, as Napoleon was treated. The question is not\r\ntrivial and the answers of the British are really important, because\r\nthey throw light on the temper of the British people after the brutal\r\nmanhandling they have received from Nazi bombers. The most constructive\r\nsuggestion I ever heard on the subject of what to do with Hitler came\r\nfrom my brilliant friend, Edgar Mowrer, who had a decade of experience\r\nin Germany. He suggests that after we have defeated Hitler we put him\r\nin a cage and send him about Germany to explain to the Germans how\r\nwrong he had been.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What would happen if Hitler were to be killed?_\r\n\r\nA. It would reduce the German war effort by one-half, and would\r\nguarantee that Germany would lose. Hitler is irreplaceable, unique, and\r\nif he were to be killed, or died, or anyhow left the scene, Germany\r\nwould not collapse but she would be as an automobile going at top\r\nspeed, suddenly run out of gasoline. The momentum of the car would\r\ncarry it forward a certain distance, but it would eventually stop.\r\n\r\nThat, in my opinion, is what would happen to Germany if deprived of\r\nHitler. It is not his technical ability that would be missed so much,\r\nnor his administrative brains, nor even his incredibly accurate,\r\nintuitive knowledge of his enemies, nor even his uncanny sense of\r\ntiming. What would be missed would be his inspiration to the German\r\npeople. If they lost their medicine man the faith in his name would\r\nflicker on, but the confidence in his infallibility which now upholds\r\nthe civil population in the hardships of war and promotes the courage\r\nof the troops in battle would disappear. The effect would be disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why doesn’t somebody kill Hitler?_\r\n\r\nA. For the last two years that has been the question most frequently\r\nasked me on the lecture platform all over America. Sometimes a fourth\r\nof all the written questions sent up would be this one. An average\r\nof twenty-five persons out of every thousand in the audience would\r\nput this question and they have been doing that ever since Hitler’s\r\nvictory over the Allies in Munich in September 1938. This itself is\r\nan interesting light on the American attitude. Most of the time the\r\nquestion was framed, “Why doesn’t some Jew, or some Britisher, or some\r\nFrenchman kill Hitler?”\r\n\r\nIt is bewildering to reflect that up until September 1939, any young\r\nman, Jew or Gentile, British, French, or of any of the thirteen nations\r\nHitler has conquered, any brave, intelligent man could have killed\r\nHitler within two months of making the resolution to do so. Only one\r\nrequirement was essential--that the assassin be willing to give up his\r\nlife. Now, however, it may cost the lives of millions of young men on\r\nthe battlefield before this author of evil is destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But wasn’t he always too closely guarded to be killed?_\r\n\r\nA. Not at all. Now it is another matter. Since the war began he is so\r\nwell guarded that it might be impossible to get at him. Before the war\r\nbegan it would have been easy to kill him. It might even have been\r\npossible for a bold and shrewd assassin to have killed him without\r\nbeing captured. I give you one instance.\r\n\r\nAt every Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg there are hundreds of\r\nthousands of strangers in the city. The Gestapo with all its resources\r\ncannot possibly check on them all. A resourceful foreigner, speaking\r\nGerman and posing as a German, could obtain a room in a hotel facing\r\nthe main street down which the parades pass. During the course of the\r\nCongress Hitler appears in at least one parade a day down this street.\r\nHe always uses a long black Mercedes car and he stands in the front,\r\nnext to his chauffeur. Hitler stands there holding on now and then with\r\nhis left hand, and giving the Nazi salute with his right.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of his car are four SS men, and on the running boards are\r\ntwo others, and behind Hitler’s car is another identical Mercedes with\r\nsix to eight more SS men. The SS men, who are the best pistol shots\r\nin Germany, lean out of their cars, peering at the crowds, and they\r\nkeep their right hands always on their pistols. You say that sounds as\r\nthough he were well guarded? Not at all. The crowd in Nuremberg is so\r\ngreat that it encroaches on the path of the automobiles until they are\r\nslowed to a walk. That means Hitler passes underneath your window at a\r\nwalking speed.\r\n\r\nAn assassin could lean out of his window and toss a bomb into Hitler’s\r\ncar with absolute accuracy. He could not miss. I have often leaned out\r\nand looked down at Hitler and remarked in a whisper to my comrades,\r\n“How easy it would be, wouldn’t it, to drop a grapefruit?” And if you\r\nthink a bomb is too uncertain, why not try a sub-machine gun? That\r\nwould be 100 per cent sure. You would have him at a distance of about\r\nthirty yards. With one burst you could riddle him, put perhaps twenty\r\nbullets into him before the guards could turn around.\r\n\r\nYou ask how the assassin could get the sub-machine gun or the bombs\r\ninto the hotel? The Gestapo is good, but it is a long way from being\r\nperfect. They overlook a great many things. We were in Vienna when\r\nHitler marched in. The Gestapo had been in control of the city for\r\ndays. But on the very day Hitler came to Vienna my wife borrowed a\r\nradio set from Tess Shirer and had the porter carry it into the hotel\r\nand up to our room. It was the size of a large thick suitcase. Nobody\r\nstopped her, or asked to investigate it. It might have contained two\r\nor three sub-machine guns with sufficient ammunition and a few hand\r\ngrenades.\r\n\r\nYou object that the assassin would certainly be caught and executed. I\r\nagree. Political assassins almost never escape. But political assassins\r\nmust always and nearly always are willing to take this chance. You\r\ncan take it as a rule of political assassination, however, that if\r\nthe assassin is bold enough, he can always get his man. Remember the\r\nMacedonian gunman, Vlada Georgiev, who killed King Alexander and Louis\r\nBarthou in Marseilles, October 9, 1934? He was a husky fellow who\r\nwaited behind the police line until the royal automobile came opposite\r\nhim and then burst through the line like a football player and with one\r\nleap was on the running board of the automobile pumping bullets from\r\nhis automatic into his two victims. It was all over in thirty seconds.\r\nThe police had no chance to intervene before Alexander was dead.\r\nGeneral Georges, later the unhappy second in command of the French\r\nArmy, cut down the assassin with his saber.\r\n\r\nThis is the classic street assassination, resembling in every detail\r\nthe killing by Gavril Princip of the Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand in\r\nSarajevo, June 28, 1914, which touched off the first World War. But the\r\nNuremberg situation would give an assassin a chance for his life. You\r\nsee, the SS guards are constantly watching the crowds in the street.\r\nNone of them pays attention to the windows of the houses and hotels\r\nalong the street. The crowds are so thick that between our hotel and\r\nthe path of Hitler’s automobile would be standing twenty to thirty\r\nthousand people.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the assassin drops his bomb or fires his machine gun, or to\r\nmake assurance doubly sure, drops bombs _and_ fires his machine gun.\r\nHitler falls. The crowd panics. How long would it take the SS men or\r\nother police to get through the crowd to the hotel entrance, climb the\r\nstairs, and search for the assassin? It would take several minutes at\r\nleast. And in the midst of that howling mob of panic-stricken people\r\nit would take minutes more before the police could surround the block.\r\nMeanwhile the assassin would have plenty of time to run upstairs to the\r\nroof, across to another building, and down a rear fire escape to mingle\r\nwith the crowd. Whatever the later details of escape, there would be\r\na chance of his getting away from the scene of the shooting if he had\r\nlaid his plans carefully in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You haven’t told us yet why nobody ever tried it?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, it has been clumsily tried, but without the proper preparation.\r\nFour or five attempts were made on Hitler’s life during his first\r\ntwo years in office, 1933 and 1934, while I was in Berlin. They were\r\nall hushed up so closely that we never had more than the skeleton of\r\nthe story. They were hushed up because the Nazis and especially the\r\nGestapo, and especially its chief, Heinrich Himmler, know that there is\r\nnothing so infectious as the idea of political assassination.\r\n\r\nThe news of an attempt at assassination will set off a series of\r\nimitative attempts. Therefore Himmler gave up his original idea which\r\nwas expressed in his announcement through the German press a few weeks\r\nafter Hitler took office. Himmler declared in a formal proclamation\r\nthat if anyone were to assassinate or attempt to assassinate the\r\nFuehrer, there would be, and these are his exact words, “a massacre\r\nsuch as the world has never seen.” He specified that the Gestapo would\r\nmassacre all of the Nazis’ opponents, and implied they would kill every\r\nJew in Germany.\r\n\r\nHimmler’s announcement was calculated to deter assassins, but he never\r\nmeant to put it into effect unless Hitler were actually killed. We\r\ncorrespondents, however, heard of several attempts on Hitler. One was\r\nsaid to have taken place the day before the great Blood Purge of June\r\n30, 1934, and was believed to have contributed to Hitler’s decision\r\nto exterminate his enemies. In this case the assassin fired with a\r\nrifle at Hitler’s automobile. Another time his car was narrowly saved\r\nfrom crashing into an obstacle supposed to have been placed in the\r\nroad with the purpose of killing him. Other attempts were even more\r\nvaguely rumored. Himmler took care that the public should learn nothing\r\nabout these attempts, not only because of the infectious nature of\r\nthe news of the assassinations, but because the Gestapo considered it\r\nundesirable to reveal that anybody in Germany could want to kill the\r\nFuehrer.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _That’s all right about Germans, but why not a Britisher, or a\r\nFrenchman, or a Jew?_\r\n\r\nA. The question why doesn’t a Jew, or why didn’t a Jew, kill Hitler is\r\none that I have often heard asked of my Jewish friends, and the answer\r\nusually is that if a Jew killed Hitler the Nazis would slaughter every\r\nJew in their dominions. The Nazis now have under their despotism in the\r\nReich and the fifteen conquered countries perhaps five or six million\r\nJews still. I agree that it is perfectly possible that the Nazis\r\nmight try to slaughter them all if a Jew were to kill Hitler, but if\r\nHitler is not defeated these unfortunate victims of Nazi hatred will\r\nultimately perish anyway.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, even the very courageous young Jews who used to operate\r\nan organization to counter Arab terror argued the same way with me when\r\nI was in Palestine, that if they killed Hitler they would doom hundreds\r\nof thousands if not millions of Jews to death. It seems that they can\r\nbelieve rationally that Hitler does intend eventually to exterminate\r\nall the Jews in Europe, and so it would not make much difference\r\nif they were all or many of them killed as a result of Hitler’s\r\nassassination, but emotionally they cling to the subconscious hope that\r\nsomething will happen to save them. Of course, the only thing that can\r\nsave the Jews of Europe is for Hitler to be defeated before they all\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nAs for a young Britisher or Frenchman killing Hitler, before the war\r\nbegan, as I have said, it would have been easy, but consider if a man\r\nhad killed Hitler before the war, what would the world have said?\r\nWhat sort of judgment would the world have delivered on the assassin?\r\nWould he have been considered a hero, a savior of mankind? Not at all,\r\nbecause Hitler up to that time was only a potential menace to Britain,\r\nFrance, and the other peaceful states. If he had been killed, his\r\nassassin would have been declared a madman, and his act would have been\r\ncondemned by all save the small group of persons who perceived the\r\ninevitability and the catastrophic course of the war Hitler planned\r\nagainst the world. No assassin kills out of pure idealism. A man who\r\nkilled Hitler would want a little credit for it, and until the war\r\nbegan he would have received none.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _He would receive plenty of credit now. Why doesn’t the British\r\ngovernment organize the killing of Hitler? Haven’t they plenty of\r\nagents in Germany?_\r\n\r\nA. I have no doubt the killer of Hitler would be decorated by\r\nfifteen governments or more, but there are still millions of muddled\r\nsentimentalists in this country who would shudder at the thought of\r\nassassination. There were few, I suppose, who objected to the G-men\r\nshooting the rabid Dillinger, but millions denounced the little doctor,\r\nWeiss, who shot the far more dangerous criminal, Huey Long. So it would\r\nhave fared with anyone who would have assassinated Hitler. Imagine how\r\ndifferent the history of Germany and of the world might have been if\r\nHitler had been among the victims of the machine gun which fired on him\r\non the morning of November 10, 1923, on the Odeon’s Platz in Munich.\r\n\r\nBefore this war there were just as many sentimentalists in England, but\r\nyou would have to look a long time to find one now. During an air raid\r\nin London I asked an old English lady, one of the gentlest creatures I\r\nhave ever known, what she would do if she were driving an automobile\r\nand suddenly Hitler were to appear in front of the car. Would she turn\r\nand save him, or would she drive ahead and hit him? “I would press the\r\naccelerator and drive straight over him,” she said firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What was the explanation of the bombing attempt on Hitler in the\r\nMunich Beer Hall?_\r\n\r\nA. It bore every earmark of being an admirably well thought-out and\r\nexecuted plan by the British which just failed by a few minutes. I\r\nshould think the British government has done all it could to have\r\nHitler killed. Certainly the British know how supremely important it\r\nwould be to do away with the heart and brains of Nazidom. The bomb\r\nattempt on Hitler in the _Buergerbraeu Keller_ in Munich, November\r\n8, 1939, the anniversary of the Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch, nearly\r\nsucceeded. To refresh your memory: Hitler and his “Old Fighters” left\r\nthe beer hall twelve minutes before a time bomb exploded, killing seven\r\npersons and wounding sixty-three. The Germans blamed it on the British\r\nsecret agents, and announced they had captured two such agents, a Mr.\r\nBest and a Captain Stevens, on the day after the bomb explosion.\r\n\r\nThe Gestapo had gone over into Holland to kidnap the two Britishers who\r\nincautiously made a rendezvous close to the frontier.\r\n\r\nSome persons analyzed this affair thus: The Gestapo itself arranged the\r\nbomb to go off after Hitler left. The Gestapo did it for one of two\r\nreasons. Either Himmler wanted to kill Hitler, or Hitler wanted the\r\nbomb attempt in order to arouse sympathy for himself among his people,\r\nand hatred of the English. Neither of these explanations makes sense to\r\nme. No Nazi leader in his right mind wants Hitler to be killed, because\r\nevery Nazi is aware that his party, his job, and his very life are\r\ndependent upon the continued existence and leadership of Hitler. I will\r\nnot say anything further about the plain fact that most of Hitler’s\r\nsubordinates literally worship him. Just on the basis of individual\r\nself-interest, it would be unlikely that any Nazi leader should wish to\r\nweaken the Nazi position so disastrously.\r\n\r\nI do not believe Himmler or any other Nazi was behind the attempt. Nor\r\nis it credible that Hitler planted the bomb to arouse sympathy for\r\nhimself among the German people. He has all the sympathy he needs, and\r\nGerman hatred for the English is quite adequate. Neither of these two\r\nreasons could balance the danger involved in the infectious quality\r\nof a public attempt at assassination such as this was. This attempt,\r\nwhich took place before a large public, could not be concealed.\r\n\r\nFinally, it seems that the German capture of the two British secret\r\nagents crippled the British Intelligence Service in Germany for many\r\nmonths. They were men high in the service and could be presumed to\r\nhave known a good deal about the whole Intelligence Service setup\r\nin Germany. With the Gestapo at work on them in the approved style\r\nrecently made so vivid and bloodcurdling by Jan Valtin in _Out of the\r\nNight_, it is not likely that many British Intelligence agents in\r\nGermany remained unidentified. At any rate there have not been any\r\nfurther attempts on Hitler, at least none that we know about.\r\n\r\nThe time-bomb attempt was compared by some correspondents to the\r\nReichstag fire, but I fail to see the basis for comparison. The\r\nReichstag was set afire by the Nazis for the specific, rational purpose\r\nof blaming it on the Communists, suppressing their party, jailing\r\ntheir deputies, and thus obtaining for the Nazis a majority vote in\r\nthe Reichstag. These purposes were achieved to the great profit of\r\nthe Nazis. What profit could the Nazis have had in staging a near\r\nassassination of Hitler? When the Reichstag was burned, my cabled\r\nreport was censored, the first censorship I had experienced in eight\r\nyears of work as a correspondent in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe freshly appointed censor cut out a paragraph in which I had pointed\r\nout that police when seeking the perpetrator of a crime, always try to\r\nfind out first who would have profited by the crime. So in the case of\r\nthe Reichstag fire it was only necessary to look for the persons who\r\nwould profit by the fire. The answer was as plain as daylight. Only the\r\nNazis would profit by the fire. The censor deleted this commonplace\r\nbut accurate observation. Who would profit by the death of Hitler? The\r\nNazis? Of course not. The British? Of course! If they had succeeded\r\nthey would have earned the thanks of a thousand million beneficiaries\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Hitler and his staff saved their lives by leaving the\r\n_Buergerbraeu Keller_ earlier than had been their custom in former\r\nyears is the basis of the peculiar claim that the whole thing was a\r\nNazi plot. Why, it is argued, should Hitler have not stayed as usual to\r\nchat with the comrades of the early days? Why indeed? Because this was\r\nwartime, the first anniversary of the Putsch to be celebrated since the\r\nwar began. Hitler has not been known to waste much time since the war\r\nbegan. He could be assumed to have had a number of things to do more\r\nimportant than chatting with his Beer Cellar veterans. This time his\r\nindustry saved his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why is it there are so few assassinations or attempted\r\nassassinations in any of the totalitarian states? You would think their\r\ncruelties would lead many desperate men to seek revenge._\r\n\r\nA. Yes, you would, and this is a matter that many of us in Russia used\r\nto discuss. How odd it was that in the history of the Soviet Union\r\nthere were only three known assassinations or attempts at assassination\r\nof Soviet leaders.\r\n\r\nLenin was shot and seriously wounded in 1918 by Dora Kaplan, a Social\r\nRevolutionary; Uritzky, police chief of Leningrad, was killed at the\r\nsame time; and sixteen years later, December 4, 1934, Sergei Kirov,\r\npolitical boss of Leningrad, was shot by a half-demented former\r\nCommunist, Nikolaev. I shall not forget the Kirov killing because I was\r\nin Moscow at the time and saw Stalin, in the bitter cold of a Moscow\r\nDecember, help carry barehanded the coffin of Kirov to its grave on the\r\nRed Square, and then hurry back to his office to plan his revenge, the\r\nmost colossal ever enjoyed by a human being since the prophet wrote\r\nthat vengeance was reserved to the Almighty.\r\n\r\nIt was the Kirov killing, of course, which touched off Stalin’s great\r\npurge. It illustrates perfectly the first of several reasons why\r\nassassinations are rare in the totalitarian states. Let me say here\r\nthat one of those reasons is not the one most popularly believed. It\r\nis not due to the impenetrable guard kept around the tyrants. There at\r\nthe funeral of Kirov, we in the press box were not more than twenty\r\nyards from Stalin as he stood on top of Lenin’s tomb, and when he\r\nwalked to the grave he came within almost touching distance of me.\r\n\r\nGranted that the correspondents have unusual facilities, and that the\r\nG.P.U. checks all of them to be confident none of them is dangerous.\r\nBut there in the Red Square hundreds of thousands of men and women\r\nmarched past Stalin, the nearest only a few feet away. Any one of them\r\ncould have shot at him or hurled a hand grenade at him before any of\r\nthe police surrounding the tomb could have intervened.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Stalin could have been killed any time during the two decades\r\nby any person with the initiative to attend the Bolshoi Theater when\r\nStalin was there, sitting in the rear of his first floor forward box.\r\nHe could have been shot from a score of seats in the first two rows of\r\nthe orchestra. It would have been even easier to wait for one of the\r\nbig Communist meetings in the Bolshoi Theater when Stalin was there\r\nwith all the leaders of the party. I have seen him with the entire\r\nPolitburo and forty or fifty others, sitting bunched together on the\r\nstage of the Bolshoi Theater, while we in the Press box in the Gallery,\r\nalmost overhanging the stage, leaned over the rail and quietly observed\r\nhow easy it would be to drop something in Stalin’s lap.\r\n\r\nA single bomb small enough to be concealed beneath an overcoat would\r\nhave killed Stalin and perhaps the entire top rank of the Communist\r\nParty. Why hasn’t anyone tried it? Stalin surely has more enemies who\r\nwould like to see him dead than any man in the world except Hitler.\r\nStalin probably has more personal enemies than Hitler, because Stalin\r\nhas executed more people. When you think of the millions who died as\r\nvictims of the Revolution, and of the millions who died in the famine\r\nof 1932-33, when Stalin ordered the peasants of the Ukraine to be\r\nstripped of all their food to teach them a lesson, it seems singular\r\nthat no bereaved survivor should have lifted his hand against the\r\ntyrant.\r\n\r\nThe first reason, however, why a modern despot enjoys relative security\r\nis the character of totalitarian terror. In a normal democratic country\r\nan assassin has to fear only the loss of his own life, and the lives\r\nof his immediate conspirators, if any. In Russia, after Kirov’s death,\r\nStalin executed in this wise:\r\n\r\nFirst, 103 persons who were not even accused of having had anything\r\nto do with the assassination but had been held in jail for various\r\npolitical offenses. This was simply the first gesture of the Terror,\r\nintended to shock the country. Then as the police rounded up Nikolaev’s\r\nfamily, friends, and acquaintances, and read his diary, they came to\r\nknow virtually every human being Nikolaev had known during his whole\r\nlife. Every one of these persons was arrested and after being squeezed\r\ndry of information was executed; at any rate they all disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut that was only the beginning. The purges which were occasioned, not\r\ncaused, by the Kirov killing lasted about four years, from 1935 to\r\n1938 inclusive. The Purge became so huge that Nikolaev was forgotten,\r\nbut before the G.P.U. finished with the Nikolaev complex, they had\r\nliquidated in this wise: Every relative of Nikolaev to the third\r\ncousins; every acquaintance of Nikolaev and every acquaintance of an\r\nacquaintance of Nikolaev, and every acquaintance of every acquaintance\r\nof every acquaintance of Nikolaev. You think this is an exaggeration?\r\nNot at all. The number of executions ran into thousands.\r\n\r\nNow what would be the effect upon a would-be assassin, if, as he\r\ncontemplated his deed, he reflected that as a consequence of his\r\nkilling Stalin, not merely would he himself be executed, but every\r\nhuman being in the world with whom he had ever come in contact? Man\r\nexperiences the world largely as a series of contacts with other men.\r\nSuppose the assassin knew by just such an experience as the Russian\r\npeople had in the case of the killing of Kirov, that his entire world\r\nwould be blotted out if he went on with his plans. Would not this deter\r\nalmost any man?\r\n\r\nHe might be motivated by the highest idealism, and would plan to give\r\nhis own life in order to rid his country of a cruel despot, but if he\r\nwere thinking of helping the people in his own world he would be bound\r\nto admit that far from helping them, he was about to condemn to death\r\neverybody on earth he had ever known. This surely is the most important\r\ndeterrent to assassination in despotic states and it is corroborated by\r\nthe experience of Italy.\r\n\r\nMussolini’s Fascist state is the least terroristic of the three\r\ntotalitarian states. The terror is so mild in comparison with\r\nthe Soviet or Nazi varieties, that it almost fails to qualify as\r\nterroristic at all. The best proof I know of this is the experience of\r\nan Italian friend of mine who before Fascism came to Italy was chief\r\ncorrespondent of one of Italy’s greatest newspapers.\r\n\r\nHe occupied a position which might be compared with that of chief\r\nWashington correspondent of the _New York Times_. When Mussolini took\r\npower this friend, whom I may call Luigi, was dismissed from his\r\nnewspaper because he refused to become a Fascist. If he had wished to\r\nserve Mussolini, he would have been made a Senator, and would have\r\nbecome a rich man. But no, he was a courageous, passionately sincere\r\nliberal. He used to declare, “I would approve of nearly all Mussolini’s\r\nprogram (he doubtless would not say that now), but as long as he wants\r\nto compel me to approve, I disapprove. I shall only approve when I am\r\nat liberty to disapprove.”\r\n\r\nNow what would have happened to this sort of man in Soviet Russia? A\r\nleading journalist under the Czar defies Bolshevik power! You know\r\nas well as I what would happen to him. He would be shot at once.\r\nThey would not even waste on him food for a day’s extra meals. He\r\nwould have been shot the moment the Cheka noticed him. And what would\r\nhave happened to Luigi in Germany? He would have been sent to a\r\nconcentration camp and there he would have been tortured and either\r\ngradually killed or turned out a broken emasculated creature, not a man\r\nany more.\r\n\r\nBut what happened to him in Italy? First, his newspaper, with which\r\nhe had a contract, bought off the contract for a sum sufficient for\r\nhim to live on in a modest way the rest of his life. At the same time\r\nthe police established a twenty-four hour surveillance of him. Three\r\ndetectives working in eight-hour shifts were assigned to watch him.\r\nMind you, he wasn’t arrested, and was even allowed to become the\r\ncorrespondent of a foreign newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe detectives were there all the time. Luigi came to know them well.\r\nIf they behaved decently and he liked them, he never gave them any\r\ntrouble. But if one of them was rude, this is the way Luigi would\r\ndo. He would get all his newspapers, a dozen or more to read in the\r\nmorning, and though ordinarily he would take a taxi or walk to his\r\noffice, now to discipline the detective, Luigi would get on one of\r\nthe streetcars which circle Rome and he would sit there, going around\r\nand around the city for a couple of hours, reading his papers. The\r\ndetective had to follow him. The detective rode a bicycle. Two hours\r\nof hard road work usually corrected the manners of the worst of them.\r\nThink of that kind of police “Terror,” and you have a fair idea of the\r\ncomparative mildness of the Italian kind of totalitarianism. We used to\r\ntake delight in counting up how many hundreds of thousands of lire it\r\nhad cost the Italian government to keep three detectives employed for\r\nfifteen years.\r\n\r\nWhat has this to do with our theme of assassination? Just this, that\r\nduring the first twelve years of Mussolini’s dictatorship he was\r\nattacked twelve times, and several of the attempts only failed by the\r\nnarrowest margin.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and most serious attempts was by a former general\r\nwho hired a room a couple of hundred yards away from the Palazzo\r\nChigi, equipped himself with a sporting rifle fitted with telescopic\r\nsights, and waited for Mussolini to come out on the balcony to speak.\r\nThis event may have inspired Geoffrey Household’s _Rogue Male_. The\r\ngeneral was betrayed at the last moment, arrested, and sentenced to\r\nlife imprisonment on the Lipari Islands. That is another index of the\r\ncomparatively mild character of the Italian despotism. At that time the\r\nFascist legal code still had no provision for the death penalty for a\r\nplot against the life of the head of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _In spite of everything you say it still seems difficult to see why\r\nsome person half-demented by persecution or the cruelties inflicted\r\nupon his family and friends should not have tried to take vengeance\r\nagainst the tyrant. There must certainly be among the victims of Nazi\r\nor Bolshevik brutality many persons too tortured in mind to be able to\r\nremember all those considerations you have advanced?_\r\n\r\nA. Undoubtedly there are, but these persons are generally too\r\ndemoralized to act. If they are sufficiently distorted by their\r\nsuffering to forget the consequences to their family and friends of an\r\nattack on the tyrant, they are too enfeebled to move. Fear paralyzes\r\nthem. The modern totalitarian tyranny, as the German and Russian, by\r\nreason of the ideology of the ruling party and superior organization\r\nof its police force, ferrets out, identifies, and disciplines a larger\r\npercentage of its opponents than any tyranny was ever able to do in the\r\npast. The ideology of the party makes an ex-officio police agent out of\r\nevery Communist in Russia and every Nazi in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe G.P.U. and Gestapo are superior to the police systems of former\r\nmodern tyrannies because this is the first time that tyrannies have\r\nnot been ashamed of their political police, but acknowledge, boast of\r\nthem, and coerce the population to cooperate with them. The amorality\r\nof Bolshevism and Nazism, or rather their rejection of the Christian\r\nstandard of behavior, is best illustrated by the exceptional position\r\nof the political police systems. Under a regime such as the Czar’s,\r\nthe political police, the Okhrana, was likewise an instrument of\r\nrepression, and as such the regime showed constant evidence of being\r\nashamed of it.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the Okhrana suffered correspondingly. Today, in view\r\nof our experience with the G.P.U. and the Gestapo, the Okhrana seems\r\nlike a benevolent association for the benefit of wayward Russians.\r\nIt is instructive now to go back and read the memoirs of that great\r\nopponent of the Czar, the noble revolutionary, Prince Kropotkin.\r\nTo note the comparative triviality of the offenses charged by the\r\nrevolutionaries against the regime, and then to note the comparative\r\nleniency of the punishments inflicted by the Czar upon his enemies is\r\nto measure the chasm which the Bolshevik Revolution and the Red Terror\r\ndug between our New Dark Age and the imperfect, liberal, easygoing\r\nPast, the like of which no one in our generation shall ever see again.\r\n\r\nUnder the Okhrana the number of political assassinations in Russia\r\nculminating with the killing of Alexander the Second, reached an\r\nall-time high. This fact, like the attempts on Mussolini’s life,\r\ncorroborate the thesis that mild Terror is ineffective, while extreme\r\nTerror may be completely effective. It seems to me to be useful to\r\nstress this fact about the Nazi or Bolshevik Terror, because one of our\r\nAmerican democratic illusions to which we cling most fondly is that\r\ngood will always triumph, liberty will eventually win over tyranny, and\r\ndespots will ultimately be overthrown by their oppressed victims.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is not only false, but one of the most harmful of our\r\nwishful thoughts, since it leads us to believe that all may come right\r\nwith this very wrong world without our having to do anything about it.\r\nAnother instructive pursuit is to get a copy of the old _Who’s Who of\r\nthe Russian Communist Party_ and observe that there was not a single\r\nleading member of the Party who had not been at one time or another,\r\nand frequently many times, under arrest by the Okhrana. Stalin,\r\nsupreme butcher of the lot, was five times in the hands of the men whom\r\nhe later was to help exterminate. One can conservatively say that if\r\nthe Okhrana had been operated on the principles of the Soviet Police,\r\nnot a single leader of the Bolsheviks would have been left alive, and\r\nthere would have been no Bolshevik Revolution as we know it, and no\r\nSoviet Union with its melancholy record of life-taking failure, and\r\nperhaps no Nazi party in Germany, and who knows, perhaps no World War\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nAbsolute Terror not only physically removes the more dangerous\r\nopponents of the tyranny but it reduces the survivors to morbid\r\nobeisance, to a sort of unwilling, servile, unconscious idolatry of\r\nthe tyrant. The tyrant, when he attains the stature of Hitler or\r\nStalin, becomes the Omnipotent Father in the subconsciousness of all\r\nhis subjects, including those hostile to him. This makes it all the\r\nmore difficult for the rebel to raise his hand in patricide. Those who\r\ninsist that the modern tyrants are mere gangsters overlook the aura\r\nof mystic power which is created around the figure of a ruler daily\r\ngreeted by choruses of adulation and abasement from tens of millions of\r\nhis people. It is no more to be resisted than the rhythm of tom-toms.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lion of Judah, Emperor Haile Selassie, declared formal\r\nmobilization of his ragged soldiers, he had two batteries of war drums,\r\none in major, one in minor key, beating their defiant message all day\r\nand all night from his palace in Addis Ababa. The pulsations of the\r\ndrums at the Ghibi more than two miles away came to me in my room in\r\nthe stables of the Imperial hotel with a mesmeric force that made me\r\nlong to follow their rhythmic directions. The same effect is obtained\r\nin the great tyrannies by the mass salutations of the tyrant worshipers.\r\n\r\nNever in history have there been such vast numbers of people to add\r\nthe influence of the multitude to the herd instinct to conform. The\r\ngreatest tyrannies of long ago, when the human tribe was a fraction\r\nof its size today, the Roman Empire, the Mongol Khanates, or even\r\nthe Indian Mogul Kingdoms, disposed of power over small populations\r\ncompared with the more than 250,000,000 now ruled by Hitler or the\r\n200,000,000 by Stalin. In this day of electric communications the\r\nhuge bulk of such aggregates does not become unmanageable. The more\r\nterritory Hitler conquers, the more loot he has, the more permanent\r\nresources to exploit, and the more people to enslave at work useful for\r\nthe Nazis. Our only hope against him is for his military defeat at the\r\nhands of ourselves and our friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You have made discouragingly plain why there are so few political\r\nassassinations in Germany, but couldn’t somebody like the fellow who\r\nkilled King Alexander and Barthou in Marseilles be found?_\r\n\r\nA. I do not think so. That fellow, Vlada Georgiev, was a member of\r\nthe famous Imro, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization,\r\nwhich had the only system I ever heard of to guarantee that their\r\nmembers carry out assigned assassinations, no matter what the police\r\nterror might be. The Imro’s object was to unify and obtain the greatest\r\npossible degree of independence for Macedonia, divided among Bulgaria,\r\nGreece, and Jugoslavia. Their chief weapon was assassination, and\r\nwhen the Imro decreed a person’s death it was about as certain to be\r\ncarried out as any human decision can be. The procedure was to appoint\r\na killer and provide that he be killed unless he fulfilled his task. To\r\nmake this principle work it was necessary that the appointed assassin\r\nrealize he would more surely die if he failed than if he succeeded and\r\nrisked legal execution. A long tradition of killings within the Imro\r\nmade this fearful compulsion effective.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics of the system were simple. Like the Russian Nihilists\r\nunder Boris Savinkov, the Imro used to try and formally condemn their\r\nvictims to death. Thereupon the committee would draw beans from a bag.\r\nThe man drawing a black bean was the appointed assassin. He was _A_.\r\nHe had to leave the room. The others drew again. The man drawing the\r\nsecond black bean, _B_, was appointed to kill _A_ if _A_ didn’t kill\r\nthe chosen victim. _B_ then left the room and a third black bean, _C_,\r\nwas appointed to kill _B_ if _B_ failed to carry out his assignment,\r\nand so on until the whole committee had lined up, each with a gun\r\nin the back of another. No one knew who among his comrades was his\r\npotential executioner, but each knew that death was certain if the\r\ndecisions of the committee were not obeyed. Now this sort of system\r\nwould work, I believe, even in Nazi Germany, but the democracies are\r\nfar too squeamish to indulge in such practical methods.[1]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] A German statistician objected to this description of the Imro\r\nsystem on the ground that the second to the last man would know that it\r\nwas the last man who was delegated to kill him if necessary; and the\r\nlast man would not have a gun in his back. True enough mathematically,\r\nbut the Imro system was run by practical assassins, not mathematicians.\r\nThey never let it get to the last man; the existence of the chain,\r\nincomplete though it had to be, guaranteed that the originally\r\nappointed assassin performed his duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Did the Nazis or the Bolsheviks practice assassination?_\r\n\r\nA. They both rather looked down on individual killings as dilettante.\r\nThey preferred to do away with their victims en masse; especially the\r\nBolsheviks. I remember at the time of the Blood Purge of June 30, 1934,\r\nwhen Hitler had murdered one thousand or more of his opponents, a\r\nPolish correspondent in Moscow was expelled by the Soviet authorities\r\nbecause he commented in a dispatch from the Russian capital that the\r\nBolsheviks regarded Hitler’s purge with the same disdain a wholesaler\r\nwould have toward the operations of a retailer. One thousand dead would\r\nbe retail business for the Bolsheviks. The Communists, however, stood\r\nprogrammatically on the platform of no “individual terror” as they put\r\nit, because they considered that assassinations of single persons were\r\nineffective, time and energy wasting.\r\n\r\nThe Nazis spurned no weapon, and so they murdered right and left from\r\nthe beginning. It was their type of young men, whether yet organized\r\nin the Nazi Party or not, who committed most of the political\r\nassassinations of postwar Germany from Rathenau and Erzberger until\r\nHitler came to power. Meanwhile, they deliberately provoked battles\r\nwith the young men of every other faction, Democrats as well as\r\nCommunists, in assemblies and on the streets, and the deaths from these\r\nclashes numbered hundreds yearly.\r\n\r\nAfter Hitler came to power you might have expected individual\r\nassassinations to cease. But no, the murders by individual Nazis of\r\nindividual enemies, business rivals, or of anyone they happened to\r\ndislike, continued through the year 1933 and it was not until 1934 that\r\nthe Gestapo took over the monopoly of murder. No claim of Hitler’s is\r\nmore ridiculous than his boast that the Nazi revolution was bloodless.\r\nThere is no record of how many Germans perished at the hands of the\r\nuniformed bullies of the Nazi Party for strictly personal reasons, but\r\nthe numbers surely ran into thousands. I was a correspondent in Berlin\r\nduring that bloody year and I can testify as an eyewitness.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But weren’t those stories about atrocities exaggerated? You know\r\nwe were fed so much propaganda in the last war that later turned out\r\nuntrue, like the Belgian baby’s hands being cut off--how much can we\r\nbelieve of the atrocity stories we hear now?_\r\n\r\nA. No, the atrocity stories of today and of yesterday and of the last\r\nwar were not exaggerated. The truth is that we shall never learn of\r\nmore than the tiniest fraction of the atrocities committed by the\r\nGermans, and I am sure we never learned about more than a fraction of\r\ntheir atrocities in the last war.\r\n\r\nNow by all means let some earnest young man arise and declare that the\r\nBritish and the French and the Americans also commit atrocities. Do\r\nthey? Perhaps, because among our troops as among the troops of every\r\nnation are some exceptionally brutal men, who when they are possessed\r\nof the fury and license of battle become criminals. But only among the\r\nGermans was and is atrocious behavior, torture, and murder, an official\r\npolicy, calculatedly carried out upon the authority of the government\r\nto terrorize or exterminate the vanquished. When I came to Germany\r\nI was intensely sympathetic with the Germans and refused to believe\r\nany of the atrocity stories of the last war. It took many years of\r\nresidence in Germany and the experience of living through the bloodiest\r\nperiod of the Nazi revolution to realize that there was almost no\r\natrocity charged against the Germans which could not have happened.\r\n\r\nWhat a beautiful example of German propaganda the Belgian baby atrocity\r\nstory was. Dr. Goebbels must often have jealously admired the person,\r\nwhoever he was, who thought up the Belgian baby. Do we wish to cast\r\nin doubt reports about the atrocities our people are committing?\r\nVery well, let us plant a monstrous charge against ourselves, which\r\nwe can prove untrue, then we can claim (and many of our softheaded\r\nopponents will believe us) that all other charges are untrue. This was\r\nthe effect of the charge that German troops had cut off the hands of\r\nBelgian babies. Strangely enough, it was Northcliffe’s _Daily Mail_\r\nwhich obliged the Germans by first picking up the story of the Belgian\r\nbaby, and then offering a reward for proof, and finally printing as\r\na journalistic scoop the fact that no proof could be found that the\r\nGermans had ever cut off a Belgian baby’s hands. Thus in the minds of\r\nmillions of simple British and Americans the Germans were exculpated of\r\n_any atrocities_. The bombarded British are not likely to make such a\r\nmistake again.\r\n\r\nWas there anything in the first World War to equal the deliberate\r\nmachine-gunning by German warplanes of the fleeing populations on the\r\nroads of Poland, France, and the Lowlands? I do not believe it has a\r\ncounterpart in modern history, and only Genghis Khan and Tamerlane\r\ncould have matched it in earlier days. There were thousands of children\r\nincluding babes in arms among the dead along the roads scarified by\r\nthe Luftwaffe. An American diplomat in Paris estimated that in France\r\nand the Lowlands 100,000 civilians, two-thirds of them women and\r\nchildren, were killed thus by the Germans, or approximately the same\r\nas the number of French soldiers who died in battle. The slaughter of\r\ncivilians in Poland surpassed this figure many times.\r\n\r\nI do not know why I should boggle at the lopped-off Belgian baby’s\r\nhands, except that nobody could ever find an authentic example, and\r\nI cannot imagine what good it would do the Germans, nor believe that\r\neven Nazi Germans like to torture babies. The machine-gunning of the\r\nroads in Europe had a military object, to cause panic and to clog the\r\nmovements of the Allied troops. But I have seen enough purposeless acts\r\nof brutality committed by the Nazis to know what they are capable of\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nI wish Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whose sensitivity as a poet I sincerely\r\nadmire, could have been with me one day in the women’s ward of a Berlin\r\nhospital as I listened to a woman explain to me why she lay there\r\nbandaged from head to foot, with the blood still oozing through. It\r\nwas in the spring of 1933, and the Brown Terror was getting into its\r\nstride, but the Nazis had not yet learned to bar correspondents from\r\nhospitals. After this story they were all barred.\r\n\r\nThe woman was Frau Marie Jankowsky, forty-eight years old, mother of\r\nfive sons. She was a Social Democratic welfare worker. “Night before\r\nlast,” she related to me, pausing only when pain made her gasp, “a\r\ngroup of Storm Troopers came to our flat. One of them backed my husband\r\nand sons into the kitchen and held them at the point of his revolver.\r\nThe others took me away to a Storm Troop barracks on the second floor\r\nof a building not far from my house. There they stripped me naked. In\r\nthe middle of the room was a table, and covering the table a flag. They\r\nasked me what the flag was.\r\n\r\n“I answered it was the Black Red Gold flag of the Republic. They said\r\n‘No,’ and commanded me to repeat that it was Black Red Ordure. I\r\nrefused and four Storm Troopers pulled me face down over the table, the\r\nfifth pushed my face into a bundle of rags to stop me screaming, and a\r\nsixth began beating me across the back with a light steel rod.\r\n\r\n“It cut the skin and made blood come with every blow. The Storm Troop\r\nCaptain said, ‘Give her twenty blows, the Jewish sow.’ I am not Jewish\r\nbut that did not make any difference. Then they jerked me off the table\r\nand said, ‘You stole shoes from your welfare section, didn’t you?’ I\r\nsaid, ‘No,’ and the Captain said, ‘Give her another twenty.’ I was\r\nbleeding badly when they pulled me off the table again and yelled at\r\nme, ‘What’s this?’ and showed me our flag of the Iron Front with three\r\narrows. I told them, but they demanded that I say it was a manure fork.\r\nI refused and the Captain ordered another twenty blows.\r\n\r\n“That made sixty, and I was very weak, but finally when they pulled me\r\noff the table again and yelled at me, ‘You served Communists in your\r\nsoup kitchen,’ I still had enough strength left to say, ‘You ought to\r\nbe ashamed to say that because I served you and you and you, but no\r\nCommunists.’ This made them angrier than ever and the last twenty blows\r\nwere the worst, and when I rolled off the table they picked me up, and\r\nthe Captain struck me across the face with his riding crop, and then a\r\nStorm Trooper hit me on the jaw with his fist and knocked me across the\r\nroom so that I fell and wrenched my knee.”\r\n\r\nThe livid scar of the riding crop flamed across her face, and the\r\ndressing on her knee confirmed that injury. I asked the medical\r\nattendant to describe her injuries as they were when she arrived and he\r\nconfirmed that her back had been cut deep into the musculature. Yes, I\r\nwish Anne Morrow Lindbergh had been with me to see and hear this story,\r\nalthough it is only one of hundreds of thousands which could have been\r\nrelated first by German victims of the Nazis and now by the vanquished\r\nof the entire continent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lindbergh says the “Wave of the Future,” by which she means the\r\nwave of collectivism, the wave of Nazism, is irresistible, and hence we\r\nwould be wrong to try to resist it, because by resisting we would only\r\nincrease the casualty list. She dismisses the brutalities, atrocities,\r\ninhumanities of the conquering Nazis as merely the “scum” on the wave,\r\nsomething which will pass away and leave the clear blue water of the\r\nNew Order. But she has not viewed this Wave of the Future at firsthand\r\nand so she has not been able to perceive that the scum reaches all the\r\nway from the top to the bottom of the Nazi wave; that there is no clear\r\nwater beneath the surface brutality of the New Order, that from its\r\nbeginning until today and until it is destroyed it has been, is, and\r\nwill be unqualifiedly evil.\r\n\r\nAtrocities? I assure you there are more atrocities being committed\r\nthis very moment by the hosts of the Gestapo, the Black Guards, the\r\nStorm Troops, and all the other ruffians of Hitler throughout prostrate\r\nEurope than you have ever dreamed about. If only we could arrange to\r\nhave all our isolationists, our weasel-worded noninterventionists,\r\nand our complaisant converts to the Wave of the Future take a trip to\r\nEurope and let them observe the fate of the 150,000,000 under Hitler’s\r\nheel. The Wave of the Future is a wave of blood and tears. What\r\nAmerican in his right mind can wish to live if this wave engulfs our\r\nworld?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You mentioned Jan Valtin’s book_, Out of the Night. _Do you\r\nconsider the book authentic?_\r\n\r\nA. It is the most accurate description of Nazi and Bolshevik Terror I\r\nhave ever seen in print. Valtin tells from the inside of the G.P.U. and\r\nthe Gestapo what an American newspaperman working in Russia and Germany\r\ncould observe in fragments from the outside. There is not an incident\r\nin the book, however gruesome, which could not have happened, no matter\r\nhow improbable it may appear to a reader far away from the horrors of\r\ntotalitarian police methods. I recommend the book to every American,\r\nbecause these two evil weapons of the tyrant states are operating today\r\nin our country and Valtin has given us the most authoritative picture\r\nof their activities we have ever had. Whatever he was in the past, this\r\nstrange young German has done more for democracy by writing these grim\r\nmemoirs than most democrats who have been democrats all their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Since Hitler attacked Russia, don’t you think it is no longer\r\ncorrect to say Nazism and Communism are the same? Hasn’t Hitler proved\r\nnow that he is really an enemy of Bolshevism and is protecting the\r\nworld against it?_\r\n\r\nA. That would be the equivalent of saying that one monarchy would not\r\nattack another or that you could not have war between two republics.\r\nThe war between Hitler and Stalin is a war between two terroristic\r\ncollectives. The collectivist form of their economy is almost\r\nidentical, both of them being a form of state capitalism; both are\r\nsupported by police terror and both found their principle motive power,\r\nthe fuel to run their society, in hatred.\r\n\r\nBoth avowed that the end justifies the means and both thereupon\r\nemployed every conceivable form of fraud, deceit, and violence to\r\nattain their ends. Pagan, atheistic rejection of Christianity,\r\ndeliberate denial of even the desirability of the principle of\r\nuniversal brotherly love was common to the two totalitarian creeds.\r\nThe fact that the two monsters of malevolence finally turned their\r\nhatred upon one another actively only emphasizes the identical\r\ncharacter of the fratricidal twins. What of their essential features\r\nhas changed since they warred upon each other? Nothing whatever. Does\r\nthe Russo-German war prove Hitler’s thesis that he was an implacable\r\nenemy of Bolshevism? Nonsense! Hitler’s brand of Bolshevism is\r\ninfinitely more menacing to us all than any produced in Russia. The\r\nbibles of the twin regimes, _Mein Kampf_ and _Das Kapital_, preach\r\nidentical doctrine: Here, hate everybody of a different race; there,\r\nhate everybody of a different class. Since Jesus Christ was on earth\r\nthe Communist Party and the Nazi Party and the states they founded are\r\nthe first institutions of such dimensions to be built avowedly and\r\nofficially on hatred.\r\n\r\nIn Russia they began by saying they had to hate and kill in order to\r\nclear the land of all classes hostile to a socialist world, in order\r\nto make room for a happier life. But hatred becomes a habit, grows,\r\nexpands monstrously until it cannot find enough victims. Before the\r\nBolsheviks even gained a far-off glimpse of a happier life their hatred\r\nhad become an end in itself. They began, by hating, as they thought,\r\nrationally; they finished by hating and killing themselves.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat and peasantry, instructed by the Communists, began by\r\nhating the Czar, the aristocrats, bankers, factory managers, engineers,\r\ntechnicians, schoolteachers, dentists, undertakers, physicians,\r\nlawyers, priests and policemen, everyone who occupied any position\r\nnoticeably superior to that of the masses. It took them about ten\r\nyears to slaughter this lot, and then they began hating and killing\r\nthe better-off farmers. I was there during the final mopping up of the\r\nfirst victims and again for the extermination of the second group, and\r\nas the last of the identifiable enemies of the Bolsheviks disappeared\r\nin the cellars of the G.P.U., or in the wastes of Siberia, we in Moscow\r\nused to discuss quite seriously what these furious haters were going to\r\ndo when they ran out of “classes” to hate.\r\n\r\nIt was no joke. It had become indispensable to Bolshevik life to have\r\nan object of hatred and when the object was exterminated another had\r\nto be found. We guessed they would have to begin hating and killing\r\nthemselves, and we were right. To us it was not surprising. When you\r\nlived among them, you realized that Communist “class hatred” is hatred\r\nof anyone who gets along better than oneself and there is just as much\r\nhatred of Communists by Communists as of capitalists.\r\n\r\nIn no organization has there ever been more back-stabbing, poisoning,\r\nstrangling, murderous mutual hatred of one another than in the\r\nCommunist Party, from the malignant Russian Central Committee through\r\nall its verminous offspring in the Comintern. They used to boast of the\r\n“monolithic” character of the Russian Communist Party. It was like a\r\nblock of granite without a crevice. The Russian Jacobins declared they\r\nwould never commit the error of their French forebears who found they\r\ncould not stop killing when once they had started to kill one another.\r\nFor years the outside world observed this Bolshevik self-restraint and\r\nthere was much fear of it.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the prodigious store of hatred within the Bolshevik\r\nbreast burst the bounds of self-preserving sanity and the apostles of\r\nMarx fell to killing each other with bewildering ferocity. Howling\r\n“Wrecker,” “Saboteur,” “Trotzkyist,” “Bukharinist,” “Rightist,”\r\n“Leftist,” “Nazi,” “Fascist,” they shot their own Soviet-reared\r\nprofessional men, generals, admirals, government officials, in a\r\nwhirl of self-destroying madness which left even persistent Soviet\r\nsympathizers unable to explain what was going on because nobody,\r\npossibly including Stalin, understood it. It was like a mad dog biting\r\nhimself, tearing out his own viscera. What could be the fate of the\r\neviscerated animal?\r\n\r\nEven before the war, in both Germany and Russia, the omnipotent,\r\nomnivorous State had devoured all but a vestige of happiness. As the\r\ntwo regimes of hatred went forward along their respective paths each\r\nlost gradually even the desire to promote the happiness of anybody,\r\neven of its own people.\r\n\r\nIn the land of the Bolsheviks, the bigoted struggle against men of\r\nanother class became a struggle against men of another view. The\r\ninternal political conflict impaired production, hampered the campaign\r\nagainst poverty, and protracted the wretchedness of the population.\r\nNobody ate, drank, slept, lived even decently, much less comfortably,\r\nand there was no security. They had given up liberty for security. Now\r\nsecurity was gone, for to their dismay the Bolsheviks saw that the one\r\nthing for which everything had been sacrificed, the defense apparatus,\r\nwas inadequate.\r\n\r\nIn the land of the Nazis, the attempts of the Supermen to rule the\r\nworld led the Germans to forget individual happiness as completely\r\nas the Bolsheviks. The Nazis believed that if they gave up butter\r\nfor guns today, they could tomorrow win with their guns more butter;\r\nbut the Nazi chief never had any intention of stopping for butter.\r\nIn comfort-loving, once-bourgeois Germany, food, clothing, fuel,\r\ntransportation deteriorated until it was impossible to find even a\r\nphysically happy person outside the young armed forces for whom the\r\nnation sacrificed all. These favored youths found their chief pleasure\r\nin the exercise of a technical skill and lust in combat which enabled\r\nthem to crush a continent with playful ease.\r\n\r\nNow from the Atlantic to the Pacific, across the greatest continuous\r\nland surface on the globe, from the English Channel to the Sea of Japan\r\nthere exists not one comfortable, secure, happy family. Not among the\r\nmore than five hundred million persons now in Europe with its neighbor\r\nstates could be discovered a trace of the happiness, imperfect though\r\nit was, which used to exist. The Nazi Bolsheviks had achieved triumph\r\nas far as Europe was concerned. The Wave of the Future had swept\r\nhappiness from its path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is the best way for the United States to help the Russians\r\nfight the German Army?_\r\n\r\nA. The best way for the United States to help the Russians fight the\r\nGerman Army is for us to go to war against Germany. Our declaration\r\nof war against Germany would be of more value to Russian resistance\r\nthan all the war supplies we shall ever be able to send to the Soviet\r\nUnion. We ought to try to send the Red Army as much as we can spare\r\nof airplanes and arms and anything else it needs to help it hold the\r\nGermans, but all such aid would be trivial compared with the effect of\r\nour declaration of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why? What practical effect on the Russian war effort would we have\r\nby going to war with Germany?_\r\n\r\nA. It would have the moral effect of convincing the Russians that they\r\nwould win in the long run; hence it should obviate any chance, however\r\nfaint, of Stalin’s capitulating. As we have said before, it would\r\nconvince the Germans they would lose the war and hence would halve\r\ntheir determination to go on. It would triple our war effort overnight,\r\nand result speedily in a vast increase of production here of the\r\nmaterials the Russians as well as the British need to carry on the war.\r\nIt would enable us to base our Pacific Fleet on Singapore and other\r\nBritish bases in the Far East, and our Air Force, if it were found\r\nexpedient, on Russian bases in Kamchatka and near Vladivostok within\r\nbombing distance of Tokyo. This would not only check the Japanese from\r\nadvancing farther south but from indulging in any military adventure,\r\nsuch as attacking Siberia, while the danger existed of our immediate\r\nintervention against them. This would relieve pressure on the Far\r\nEastern Red Army and permit it to send urgently needed reinforcements\r\nto the troops fighting the Germans in European Russia.\r\n\r\nThe use of our Atlantic antisubmarine vessels in complete cooperation\r\nwith the British Navy in all the war zones would help break the\r\nGerman counter-blockade and permit a greater quantity of supplies to\r\nreach the British armed forces. It would enable us to seize those\r\npositions we need off the west coast of Africa and on the coast, and\r\nthus provide the first step toward establishing another take-off\r\nplace for an expeditionary force against the Reich. The example of\r\nAmerica’s entering the war could lead Weygand, or other authorities in\r\nMorocco, to consider collaboration with us instead of with the Germans;\r\nthe north African coast has long been kept in mind as a possible\r\nspringboard for invading Europe. America’s entry into the war would for\r\nthe first time enable the British to attempt invasion of the continent.\r\nUntil now the British have had to keep at home more reserves than they\r\nwould need if they knew the American Army would soon be at their side.\r\n\r\nEven with our Army in its present state of semi-preparedness, we have\r\nenough completely trained Regular Army and Marine units to be able to\r\nsend abroad for active service an important contingent which would\r\neither take its place immediately in an invasion force or replace\r\nBritish units assigned to that task. The first effect upon the Germans\r\nof the intelligence that the British were seriously preparing to\r\nattempt an invasion would be to compel them to send back troops from\r\nRussia to threatened points in Europe.\r\n\r\nFinally, from the broadest strategical standpoint, the entry of the\r\nUnited States would turn the tables on the Germans who until now have\r\nhad the advantage of initiative and surprise. Throughout the world\r\nuntil now Hitler has kept the world wondering “where is he going to\r\nstrike next?” With the United States in the war, it would be the turn\r\nof the Axis powers to wonder where the Anglo-American-Russian forces\r\nwere going to strike next, and Hitler would be forced to keep large\r\nnumbers of troops stationed at every point where our forces could\r\npossibly attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _The Russian resistance to the German attack seems to have surprised\r\nnearly everybody. How do you explain it?_\r\n\r\nA. There are many reasons for it. It is true that almost every expert\r\nexpected the Russians to collapse within a few weeks after Hitler began\r\nhis drive. Walter Duranty is the only one I know who said from the\r\noutset that the Red Army would hold much longer than the outside world\r\nseemed to expect.\r\n\r\nThe first reason for Russian resistance is that this was the first\r\ntime Hitler ever tackled a country with _lives to waste_ and _miles\r\nto waste_. Its 200,000,000 population lived almost like animals, but\r\nmost of them flourished like healthy animals on their black bread\r\nand cabbage and made sturdy fighting material. They claimed around\r\n12,000,000 soldiers in their standing army and reserve. Thus they could\r\nlose as many men as the entire German Army and still have left an army\r\nas big as the former French Army. In fighting against the Germans\r\nthey could afford to lose two to one and still have superiority in\r\nnumbers. Their high command knew this and wasted lives with abandon but\r\nsometimes to advantage. The same advantage in size held with respect to\r\nterrain. They could afford to retreat over distances equivalent to the\r\nwidth of many European countries and still have room to live in, just\r\nas the Chinese did.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for Russian resistance is that this was the first\r\ntime Hitler had ever struck an army and a generation untouched by the\r\nhumanizing influence of Christianity, immune to any form of pacifism,\r\nunsoftened by Western civilization. It was the first time Hitler had\r\never struck an army that had been taught that all life is struggle,\r\nthat to fight for the Soviet Union was the noblest thing a man or woman\r\ncould do, the first time the Nazis had met a fanaticism sharper than\r\ntheirs. The Bolsheviks invented totalitarian fanaticism; the Nazis only\r\ncopied it.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time the Germans had come up against a people more\r\nsavage than themselves. The Bolsheviks were ahead of the Nazis in\r\npronouncing that the end justifies the means, and the oriental Russians\r\nsurpassed the occidental Germans in cruelty. The Germans have known\r\nHitlerism only since 1933 and until that time they had normal contacts\r\nwith the outside world. The Russians have known nothing but Bolshevism\r\nsince 1918 and from that moment on have been hermetically sealed from\r\nthe outside world.\r\n\r\nFor war-making this savage insularity has its uses. The Red Army is\r\neven more fanatically homogeneous in its political faiths and hatreds\r\nthan is the Nazi Army. Everybody under the age of forty in Russia today\r\nhas experienced either throughout life or in adult life nothing but\r\nthe Soviet regime. The Russians have the advantage that they have been\r\npracticing totalitarians all their lives and are used to it. For the\r\ncivilian population not immediately in the path of the battles there\r\nwas less change in the move from peace to war in the Soviet Union than\r\nin any other belligerent state, because the Russians have been living\r\non a war footing since 1918.\r\n\r\nDuring this generation of hardships their Asiatic characteristics have\r\nbeen deepened, their fatalistic contempt for death increased. They are\r\ncontent to let the Party guide their emotions. There are no Hamlets\r\namong them. The Russians Dostoevsky wrote about, who dreamed and\r\nsorrowed and could not act--all these have long been eliminated. Also\r\nno living inhabitant of the Soviet Union has been corrupted by ease or\r\nluxury! Yet because they are completely cut off from the outside world\r\nthe Russians think the Soviet Union superior to any other country. This\r\nis an advantage in war.\r\n\r\nIsolated and youthful, the Russians after twenty-three years of\r\nsuffering and historically unparalleled loss of life through\r\nrevolution, famine, and terror, still were not disillusioned by a\r\npolitical, social, and economic system which had given them a standard\r\nof living and culture beneath that of any large white community in the\r\nworld. There were no ideological divisions to rend the nation, since\r\nall who differed with the ruling clique were liquidated the moment\r\nthe difference became apparent. Hence there was no Fifth Column in\r\nRussia. Since Soviet justice or Stalin policy goes on the principle\r\nthat it is better to execute a hundred innocents than to let one guilty\r\nescape, the purge of 1934-1938 probably did eliminate important Fifth\r\nColumnists, together with many valuable military and industrial leaders.\r\n\r\nA third reason for the strength of the Russian resistance is that the\r\nRed Army for the past twenty-three years has received a larger share\r\nof the national income in peacetime than any other defense force of\r\nany nation has ever enjoyed, including Germany. Though Russia starved,\r\nthe Red Army ate well. On the four occasions--1925-1927, 1930, 1934,\r\nand 1937--when I visited the Soviet Union and worked there as a\r\ncorrespondent, I noticed that no matter how poorly the rest of the\r\npopulation was dressed, Red Army soldiers always wore good uniforms\r\nand strong leather boots. This was because ever since the Soviet Union\r\nwas born, every leader from Lenin and Trotzky to Stalin was profoundly\r\nconvinced that “the capitalist world will never permit the Socialist\r\nState to exist and some day will seek to destroy us.”\r\n\r\nOf course this attack of Hitler’s is not the attack of the capitalist\r\nworld upon the Socialist State, and the Socialist State now finds\r\nthe capitalist world its only ally. Nevertheless the unshakable and\r\ncorrect Bolshevik belief in inevitable war led the regime to impose the\r\ngreatest sacrifices upon the people for the sake of the armed forces,\r\nand even though the Soviet economy was most backward, the enormous\r\namounts expended were bound to have effect.\r\n\r\nEven in American terms the Soviet defense budget was large. In 1940 it\r\nwas the equivalent of $11,000,000,000, and represented one-third of the\r\nnational expenditure. Measure this against the fact that the infinitely\r\nricher United States will approximate the expenditure of that much\r\nyearly only in 1942 after two years of our greatest defense effort.\r\n\r\nMost of the money spent on the Red Army and Air Force went for machines\r\nof war. Twenty-three years ago when the Bolshevik revolution took place\r\nthere were few machines in Russia. Marx said Communism must come in a\r\nhighly industrialized society. The Bolsheviks identified their dreams\r\nof socialist happiness with machines which would multiply production\r\nand reduce hours of labor until everyone would have everything he\r\nneeded and would work only as much as he wished. Somehow this has not\r\ncome about, but the Russians still worship machines, and this helped\r\nmake the Red Army the most highly mechanized in the world, except\r\nperhaps the German Army now.\r\n\r\nLike Americans, the Russians admire size, bigness, large numbers. They\r\ntook pride in building a vast army of tanks, some of them the largest\r\nin the world, armored cars, airplanes, motorized guns, and every\r\nvariety of mechanical weapon. Their quality was seldom the best. Few\r\nthings produced in the Soviet Union have attained high quality, but the\r\nattempt is made to compensate by quantity.\r\n\r\nBolshevik love of novelty, eagerness to experiment and try new things\r\n(they invented parachute troops), their willingness to discard\r\ntraditional methods, and their liking for youthful leadership all were\r\nadvantages. The Red Army apparently was the only one to learn from\r\nthe lessons of the German campaign in Poland--which were open for the\r\ninstruction of the French, British, Dutch, Belgians, and every other\r\ncountry in Europe, but were ignored by all of them. Stalin’s purge of\r\nthe Red Army wherein he executed or otherwise eliminated one-fourth of\r\nthe senior officers was believed at the time to have done unmitigated\r\nharm, but besides the probability that it disposed of some real Fifth\r\nColumnists, it destroyed nearly all the older generals, and left the\r\nfield for men under fifty. Voroshiloff and Budenny were vestigial\r\nexceptions. In this day of brand-new warfare youth has an advantage.\r\n\r\nWe have to include here also the fact that the Russian is an excellent\r\npilot. He has reckless courage, keen eyesight, abounding health,\r\ncontempt for the enemy, and fanatical belief in his cause. The Russians\r\nhave a word they like to apply to themselves, _Shirokaya Natura_,\r\nmeaning broad-natured, lavish-tempered. That is a characteristic of all\r\nthe good pilots I have ever known. It means they are ready to spend\r\nthemselves, their lives, as readily as they spend their money. The\r\nR.A.F. has it, Udet has it, Goering has it, the American and Canadian\r\npilots have it, and the Russians have it. I dare say Lindbergh must\r\nhave had it once. There are millions of boys in Russia of pilot age.\r\n\r\nThe fourth set of reasons for Russian resistance is based upon the\r\nimmense benefit the Red Army won through the occupation of the Finnish\r\nMannerheim line, the Baltic states, Eastern Poland, and Bessarabia\r\nduring the time Hitler was busy conquering the rest of Europe. This\r\naction of Stalin’s was typical of the principle that the end justifies\r\nthe means. If you believed in this principle and in the righteousness\r\nof the Soviet cause, you would now have to admit that the end did\r\njustify the means in this case, since the creation of this screen of\r\nterritory enabled the Red Army to defeat the Blitz.\r\n\r\nThe term Blitzkrieg, frequently misused, technically means the\r\ndestruction of your enemy by action so swift that he is not able to\r\nmobilize, or bring up his forces to meet yours at the decisive point.\r\nThe screen of occupied territory slowed up the Germans long enough for\r\nthe Red Army to mobilize fully. Thereafter the great distances, the\r\nbad roads, the unfavorable weather, and the scorched-earth policy\r\nimpeded the German advance, while Russian guerilla warfare proved more\r\neffective than anything of the kind the Germans had ever met.\r\n\r\nRussian guerilla fighting is not the old-fashioned kind, where a farmer\r\nhides with a shotgun to catch an enemy sentry with his back turned.\r\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the most ferocious conflict of modern\r\ntimes until its Spanish equivalent, the Reds especially developed\r\nPartisan warfare. This consisted in deliberately hiding companies of\r\nseveral score or hundred heavily armed men until the enemy passed\r\nforward. These guerillas would then attack from the rear, usually by\r\nnight, and often annihilate whole detachments of the enemy. Their\r\nambushes, ruses, and surprises were endlessly ingenious. The guerillas\r\nseldom wore uniforms. They were invariably shot if captured. They\r\nalso never took prisoners except to obtain information by torture.\r\nThey were extremely successful. Heretofore the Germans have been able\r\nto terrorize their conquered populations by the exercise of utterly\r\nruthless Terror. They will have less success with the Russians than\r\nwith any people they have yet tried to break, except perhaps the Serbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But that is a very long list of reasons for Russian resistance.\r\nCan’t you sum them up for us in a word?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, the answer is morale, or better, faith. That word with its\r\ndeep Christian connotations may sound blasphemous when applied to the\r\natheist Bolsheviks, but it is a true faith, in reverse, founded upon\r\nhatred. It may be objected that faith is a positive force and it may\r\nbe asked in what do the Russians have faith? In their dogma, their\r\ndoctrine, their nation, or faith in themselves, or the faith that lies\r\nin their deep attachment to their soil? Or is it not their faith in the\r\nunspeakably evil character of their enemies? I think it is the last.\r\nThe Bolsheviks have taught all Russians to hate the Fascists, as they\r\ngenerically call the Nazis, with a ferocity which surpasses anything\r\nin our experience. This sort of faithful hatred is a terrific force.\r\nIt inspires to limitless valor. It is a priceless asset in war. The\r\nRussians see the Nazi legions as the incarnation of wickedness, led by\r\nthe devil himself. They are right. Furthermore they are inspired to\r\nfight by the belief, also correct, that if they lose they will suffer\r\nintolerable punishment. Unlike the French they have no illusions about\r\nthe fate that awaits them at the hands of the man who has called them\r\nthe “scum of the earth.”\r\n\r\nThis hatred of their enemies and fear of the consequences of defeat\r\nare probably the strongest feelings animating the Russians in battle,\r\nbut they have also an incredible faith in themselves. It makes no\r\ndifference that this faith is founded for the most part on lack of\r\nknowledge of the outside world, and the absence of any chance to\r\ncompare themselves with other nations and other systems: they are\r\nunshakably convinced that they are what would have been called in\r\nanother time and another place, “God’s anointed.” An American general\r\ndefined morale as “when a soldier thinks his army is the best in the\r\nworld, his regiment the best in the army, his company the best in the\r\nregiment, his squad the best in the company, and that he himself is\r\nthe best blankety-blank soldier man in the outfit.” This is what the\r\nRed Army soldier thinks. The Red Army was not impressed by the German\r\nvictory in France. After all, the defeated were “just Frenchmen, just\r\n_bourgeoisie_.”\r\n\r\nThe average Russian has a strong conviction, unspecified and\r\nunsupported by evidence, but forming a subconscious background for all\r\nhis thinking about the war, that the citizens of the outside world, in\r\n“capitalist-imperialist” and “capitalist-fascist” states alike, are\r\ncomposed of two classes, depraved slave drivers and spiritless slaves.\r\nHe even looks down on the proletariat abroad which has gone these\r\ntwenty years without making the revolution the Russians made. It was\r\na bitter revelation to many an American and other foreign Communist\r\nleader on visiting Moscow the first time, to be assigned a cubbyhole\r\nin the old Lux Hotel, and to be forced to wait hours for an audience\r\nwith a Russian official who scarcely troubled to conceal his contempt\r\nfor the inferior foreign communist.\r\n\r\nWe are surprised that the Russians, after all these years of starving\r\nand pain and suffering, should still possess the morale to fight, but\r\nwe overlooked the fact that faith thrives on tribulation. The British\r\nhad no faith and no morale until they were threatened with death and\r\npunished with fire. Today they have a faith in their cause such as\r\nthey have not had since they became a nation, and now they announce\r\nthey will scorch the earth, and if necessary burn London before the\r\nadvance of an invader. Today the British are poor in food and clothes\r\nand lodgings, but rich in spirit. The Russians are likewise, and though\r\nit is painful to say it, so are the Germans. We alone among the nations\r\nare still rich in material goods and poor in spirit, for we lack faith.\r\nWhere are those among us furious to fight for liberty and democracy?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you mean to say the Russians have more faith in their cause than\r\nwe do in ours?_\r\n\r\nA. I do.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How can you say such a thing, how do you mean it?_\r\n\r\nA. I think you are surprised because you confuse faith and morality.\r\nThey have nothing to do with each other.\r\n\r\nThe morality of the Nazis and the Bolsheviks is abhorrent. That has\r\nnothing to do with the fact that their faith was strong enough to\r\nmake them great warriors. The best fighters in the Spanish Civil War,\r\nErnest Hemingway testifies, were the Moors. Those skinny brown men,\r\nwho looked so insignificant and whose behavior was so abominable, were\r\nalways chosen, if available, to be the shock troops, as when they\r\nrelieved the Alcazar. They fought with the bravery traditional of the\r\nMohammedan warrior from the Ottoman Turks to the Afghans. Their morals\r\nwere criminal. They butchered, looted, raped with neither compunction\r\nnor discrimination.\r\n\r\nI have seen them walking down a village street laden with sewing\r\nmachines, women’s clothing, surgical instruments, and chicken feed to\r\nset up shop in a Cathedral underneath the image of the Saviour whose\r\nhead they had hacked off. Decent folk on Franco’s side were appalled,\r\nbut Franco could not do without them. They had a faith that only the\r\nCatholic Requetés on the one hand and the Communists on the other could\r\nequal, and when they went into battle the Moors sang. I have heard them\r\nand reflected that good and evil have nothing to do with faith which\r\nmoves mountains and wins wars. Are we today in the United States going\r\ninto battle singing? We are not even going into battle, although we\r\nadmit it is ours.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you mean to say the Moors fought for the Mohammedan faith in\r\nSpain?_\r\n\r\nA. I do not. I mean to say that they fought because they believe the\r\nprofession of a man is to fight, and in fighting they are upheld in\r\nspirit by their belief in Allah, and their faith in his promises.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What do the Russians fight for? They have no Allah and believe in\r\nno hereafter._\r\n\r\nA. I am not sure that either of those statements is correct. The images\r\nof Lenin, Stalin, and Marx blend in the primitive Soviet Russian mind\r\ntogether with dim memories of Orthodox ritual to make up a kind of ikon\r\nof Communism. In some minds it may be only the figure of Father Lenin,\r\nnow mummified, deified, or at least sanctified, in his glass coffin\r\non the Red Square, but in all save the minds of the intellectualized\r\nleaders there is some personification of the faith. As for belief in a\r\nhereafter, I have sometimes wondered if even the highest leaders of the\r\nParty are always as sure as their Bezbozhnik Society, the Society of\r\nthe Godless, professes to be.\r\n\r\nThe Bezbozhniks’ battle against God would be meaningless unless they\r\nthought, however subconsciously, that there must be something there to\r\nfight. Twice I have seen Stalin stand at the graveside of a lifetime\r\ncomrade, once at the burial of Frunze and once at Kirov’s, and each\r\ntime as the final words were spoken and the earth fell and the bells of\r\nthe Kremlin tolled, I scrutinized his face for a sign of his thoughts\r\nand under the spell of the moment I always thought I could see the\r\nflicker of a question across his gloomy face. As a matter of fact I\r\nsuppose he was absorbed in thinking how to finish the ceremony as\r\nquickly as possible in order to get back to his office and ensure that\r\na good Stalin man succeeded the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is it true that in order to curry favor with the outside world the\r\nSoviet government has restored freedom of worship?_\r\n\r\nA. Freedom of worship in the Soviet Union was never frankly and\r\npublicly prohibited; it was merely quietly strangled. Today its public\r\nrestoration is a gesture toward the outside world and an effort to\r\ncanalize even the religious energies sleeping in the hearts of the\r\nolder people, into national defense. All the old shibboleths of\r\nreligion and patriotism and nationalism and local pride and mystic\r\nfaith in Holy Russia which for two decades had been banned have now\r\nbeen revived. In the supreme trial of war the Russian people have\r\nreturned instinctively to the deep primitive traditions common to man\r\neverywhere. Their Bolshevik masters have apparently recognized the\r\ndesirability of kindling fighting energy from any fuel, and have\r\npermitted a veritable carnival of emotions which a short while ago\r\nwould have been condemned as “bourgeois” and “counterrevolutionary.”\r\nWho knows what further changes the war may bring?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _American friends of the Soviet Union claim that her present\r\nresistance to the Germans entitles her now to our moral approval, and\r\nthat we are obligated to give it to our “Ally.” Is this true?_\r\n\r\nA. I am sure Stalin does not care for our moral approval. He would\r\nmuch rather have our material support. Those Americans who changed\r\ntheir views of the Soviet Union either when Stalin signed his pact with\r\nHitler in August 1939, or when the Red Army attacked Finland, or when\r\nit marched into Poland, the Baltic states, and Bessarabia, or again\r\nwhen the Germans attacked Russia and the Red Army fought back--such\r\nobservers only proved that their judgment of Stalin’s system was\r\nfounded on mere day-to-day, surface events. When they approved of the\r\nSoviet Union it was for wrong reasons; when they disapproved it was for\r\nwrong reasons.\r\n\r\nNone of the events just named meant any change in the nature of the\r\nSoviet regime. If one approved of it today for resisting Germany, one\r\nought to have approved of it in August 1939 for having signed up with\r\nGermany. Both acts had the same motive: the self-interest of the Stalin\r\nregime.\r\n\r\nWhether we wish to extend our moral approval to the Stalin regime or\r\nnot, we all owe profound gratitude and respect to the Russian people.\r\nIt is said that every people gets the kind of government it deserves,\r\nbut I do not think this has ever been true of the Russian people; they\r\nhave never had as good a government as they deserved. Today they are\r\ndemonstrating a spirit on the battlefield which places us forever in\r\ndebt to them. Whatever his regime, the Russian soldier is giving his\r\nlife to defeat the Germans and every sacrifice of a Russian life means\r\nthe possible saving of an American life.\r\n\r\nTo the Russian people we owe our friendship as well as all our support.\r\nOur support can reach the Russian people only through their regime. Let\r\nus keep the distinction sharp and the supplies moving.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Aren’t we running a risk if we support the Russians?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, we are compelled to run a risk no matter what we do. The time\r\nwhen we could have made ourselves secure without risk is long past; our\r\nisolationists saw to that. Today we risk much if we support the Soviet\r\nUnion, but we risk more if we do not. If we do not support her, we risk\r\nHitler’s winning the resources of Russia. If we do support her, we risk\r\ntwo things, first, that after we have poured supplies and munitions,\r\nairplanes, gasoline, and guns into Russia, Stalin might capitulate and\r\nthese war materials would fall into the hands of the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe other risk is that with our help the Red Army should not only hold\r\nthe Germans but actually defeat them and invade and occupy Germany. I\r\npurposely draw this picture crudely. This is a small immediate risk,\r\nfor the Red Army has not the offensive power to do it. But suppose the\r\nRed Army were able to hold the Germans for another year, the while\r\nBritain with the United States’ help grows strong enough in the air\r\nto obtain supremacy over the Luftwaffe on the Western Front. Suppose\r\nduring this time, with the aid of shipments from the United States the\r\nRed Air Force recovers and also grows strong enough to dominate the\r\nLuftwaffe on the Eastern Front. It is then possible to imagine a time\r\nwhen the Germans, disintegrating from within, would begin to withdraw\r\nfrom the East and the Red Army begin to attack.\r\n\r\nWhen once Germany begins to crumble, it is the conviction of all who\r\nknow that brittle country that she will fall apart at once. It will be\r\na miracle, indeed, if she finds a Hindenburg to lead her armies home\r\nand demobilize them in orderly fashion. It will be more of a miracle if\r\na Prince Max of Baden can be found in Germany to apply for an armistice\r\nor negotiated peace.\r\n\r\nThe German Army will have been defeated, disrupted, demoralized. For\r\na time there will be anarchy. Then all will depend upon which forces\r\nreach German territory and the German capital first, the Red Army or\r\nthe armies of the West. If we have stayed out of the war, or have\r\nparticipated only as a naval and air power; if the Western Allies have\r\nconquered Germany on the sea and in the air, but have left the land\r\nto be conquered by the Red Army; then if the Red Army pushes into\r\nGermany before our forces can arrive, it will mean Communist revolution\r\nthroughout Europe.\r\n\r\nWhy has the world not gone Communist long ago? It is because Communism,\r\nor its Soviet version, in the only country it was ever tried, had been\r\na peacetime failure. Let us not argue the definition of Communism and\r\nwhether we ought to call it State Capitalism. The world had made up its\r\nmind that the collectivist system as practiced by the Russians could\r\nnot produce enough to make its population as well off as the people\r\nwere even under old-fashioned, broken-down, rickety capitalism. Now,\r\nvictory by the Red Army would be evidence that Russian Communism could\r\ndo what Western capitalism could not do--defeat Hitler. The populations\r\nof Europe would count that power victorious whose land armies were on\r\nthe spot to occupy the territory of the defeated. If the Red Army were\r\nto get there first, it would prove to millions of uncritical observers\r\nthat the Soviet system had won, that it was a success to be emulated,\r\nand in the circumstances of disorder and unemployment which would\r\nprevail at the conclusion of the war, such a judgment could lead to\r\ncontinental upheaval.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How can we prevent this and at the same time see that Nazi Germany\r\nis defeated?_\r\n\r\nA. Only by going to war against Germany now. Never since the war began\r\nhave we had any stronger reasons for entering the war than now. We\r\ncannot afford to stay out and allow Hitler the possibility of winning\r\nthe war by getting Russia. We cannot afford to stay out and allow the\r\nBolshevik regime the possibility of winning the continent of Europe to\r\nCommunism.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But can Stalin be trusted?_\r\n\r\nA. Certainly not. His agreement with Churchill not to conclude a\r\nseparate peace is worth even less than the solemn promise the French\r\ngovernment made on March 28, 1940 to make no separate peace, just three\r\nmonths before it made a separate peace over the protest of its Ally,\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why do you say Stalin’s promise is worth even less than that?_\r\n\r\nA. Because Bolsheviks, from whom the Nazis have copied their ethics,\r\ndo not believe in keeping their word. I do not mean this frivolously\r\nor cynically. On page 323 of volume XVII of the collected works of\r\nLenin, the father of Bolshevism wrote: “Morality is that which serves\r\nthe destruction of the old exploiter’s society ... which creates a\r\nnew society of communists. Communist morality is that which serves\r\nthis struggle.... We do not believe in eternal morality and we expose\r\nthe deceit of all legends about morality.” As the end justifies the\r\nmeans and the end is the State, so treaty breaking is justified when\r\nit serves the State. For a Bolshevik or a Nazi, one of the most absurd\r\nphrases in the Bible is the reference to the obviously bourgeois\r\nsimpleton who sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not. For both\r\nBolshevik and Nazi the theory is that individual honor must always\r\nbe sacrificed if necessary to the State, and the State itself has no\r\nobligation of honor to any other State, or individual.\r\n\r\nYou may say that the only difference between a Bolshevik’s or Nazi’s\r\nbreaking his word and a bourgeois’ doing the same is that the Bolshevik\r\nor Nazi would be proud of it and the bourgeois would not. True enough,\r\nand that makes all the difference between a moral world and an amoral\r\nworld. It is the difference between the recognition of morality and the\r\ndefiance of it--the difference between civilization and the jungle.\r\nThis jungle attitude we hope to eliminate by defeating Hitler.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How do you expect to eliminate this jungle by fighting on the side\r\nof the Bolsheviks?_\r\n\r\nA. We would not be “fighting on the side of the Bolsheviks.” We would\r\nbe fighting disease with disease. As a youth I studied medicine for a\r\nwhile in Vienna, and one of my professors was the great Wagner-Jauregg,\r\nthe discoverer of the malaria treatment for the tertiary stage of\r\nsyphilis. Wagner-Jauregg observed that some of his paretic patients\r\nwho contracted another disease accompanied by high fever would\r\nafter the recession of the fever often be almost cured of their\r\nsyphilitic disabilities. He began to inoculate his syphilitic patients\r\nwith malaria and thus by using one disease against another won a\r\nconsiderable number of victories over the more dangerous of the two\r\nafflictions. After curing the syphilis it was relatively easy to cure\r\nthe malaria. Nazi Germany is at this moment as much more dangerous\r\nthan Bolshevik Russia to our world as syphilis is more malignant than\r\nmalaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _So you think Bolshevism, after it has helped eliminate Nazism, will\r\nbe as easy to cure as malaria?_\r\n\r\nA. Probably not, but we may entertain reasonable hopes that in case the\r\nRed Army as distinct from the Bolshevik Party is victorious, or even\r\nsemi-victorious over the invading Germans, it will have more to say in\r\nthe affairs of Russia than ever in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you consider that would be an improvement?_\r\n\r\nA. Decidedly. Armies are usually conservative and pacifist. If we want\r\nto get rid of the Communist International and have Russia re-enter\r\nthe family of nations, let the Red Army take hold of affairs in the\r\nKremlin. Stalin is afraid of it.\r\n\r\nIn the purge of 1934-1938 Stalin arrested no less than 30,000 officers\r\naccording to an estimate quoted by Louis Fischer. He started by\r\nexecuting the head of the army, Tukhachevsky, and seven other of the\r\nhighest generals, then three more, and so on until there were left of\r\nthe original staff only Voroshiloff and Budenny. Some may have been\r\nguilty of wishing to cooperate with the Nazis, but most were killed\r\nbecause Stalin feared they were plotting against him.\r\n\r\nStalin’s principal instrument of espionage against his own army is the\r\nsystem of political commissars, whereby a Stalin party man is allocated\r\nto each Red commander, with the prime duty of watching his every move,\r\nlistening to his every word, and if possible trapping him into an\r\nindiscretion. This obviously hinders military efficiency, and in times\r\nwhen Stalin feels safe or when he wants military efficiency more than\r\nan immediate sense of personal security, he gives it up.\r\n\r\nWhen he attacked Finland, for example, he felt strong enough personally\r\nto give it up, and the Red Army improved sufficiently to win. There was\r\nmuch boasting among Communists that the Red Army now no longer would\r\nneed political commissars again, but to their disappointment, shortly\r\nafter the German attack on Russia, Stalin reinstalled his commissars.\r\nThis at the moment when the Soviet Union was more gravely threatened\r\nthan ever in its history meant that Stalin felt himself less menaced\r\nby the defeat of the Red Army than by the Red Army itself.\r\n\r\nIs it farfetched to imagine that since Stalin has played the part of a\r\nsuper-Robespierre, the time may come when he will suffer Robespierre’s\r\nend?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _If you say, as you did, that Stalin would make a separate peace if\r\nit suited him, despite his agreement not to do so, what was the use of\r\nBritain’s offering and entering into such an agreement?_\r\n\r\nA. It was useful to make the agreement in order to convince Stalin\r\nthat Britain, for her part, intends to keep on fighting no matter\r\nwhat happens. This might encourage Stalin to fight a little longer\r\nthan he might have done if he thought that at any moment he might be\r\ndeserted by his Ally. You remember the _New Yorker_ anecdote about the\r\nsuburbanite who met the town Communist soon after Germany attacked\r\nRussia, and twitted him about the German-Soviet pact, but without\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe Communist said blandly that it was only to be expected, that it\r\nproved Russia was the dominant figure on the international scene, and\r\nso on. Then he added: “The only time I was worried was when I was\r\nlistening to Churchill’s speech on the radio. For a minute, at the\r\nbeginning, I thought he was going to rat on us.” So the Anglo-Soviet\r\nagreement is strictly one-way, but it has its uses. It may persuade\r\nStalin that Churchill is not going to rat on him!\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Under what circumstances do you think Stalin would make a separate\r\npeace?_\r\n\r\nA. At any time Hitler would let him have peace and remain in power and\r\nretain sufficient of the framework of the Soviet system to promise its\r\ncontinuance after the Western powers had defeated Hitler. It is plain\r\nnow that, once the Germans had attacked, Stalin must have realized\r\nhe had to fight or die, for Hitler was evidently sure of quick,\r\ncomplete victory. If Stalin had tried to capitulate, as some thought\r\nhe would, without fighting, he could have obtained nothing better than\r\nobliteration of himself and his regime. Therefore Stalin fought, but\r\nthis does not necessarily mean he intends to fight to the bitter end,\r\nwith the Red Army backing up to the Urals, to Siberia, and the Soviet\r\ngovernment moving to Sverdlovsk or Novosibirsk, as romantic enthusiasts\r\nwould have it.\r\n\r\nStalin probably defines his task to fight Hitler so well, make it\r\ncost the Germans so much, that Hitler will finally offer a peace\r\nStalin could afford to accept on the basis of his expectation that\r\nGermany would in the long run lose the war. The Bolshevik surrender\r\nat Brest-Litovsk in 1918 was based on similar reasoning, that the\r\nBolsheviks’ enemy, Germany, would eventually be removed by world\r\nrevolution and that good Bolshevik strategy would seek first to\r\npreserve the structure, if only a skeleton structure, of the Soviet\r\nSocialist State, at any cost of immediate humiliation and suffering.\r\n\r\nThe Russians have proved now by their destruction of the great dam at\r\nDniepropetrovsk that they mean truly to scorch the earth before Hitler\r\neven if it means the destruction of their most precious possessions.\r\nThe destruction of the Dnieper dam was to my mind the most important\r\nsingle event of the Russian-German war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why was the blowing up of the Dnieper dam so important?_\r\n\r\nA. Because Dnieprostroy was an object almost of worship to the Soviet\r\npeople. Its destruction demonstrates a will to resist which surpasses\r\nanything we had imagined. I know what that dam meant to the Bolsheviks.\r\nI visited it in 1930 when it was being built under the supervision\r\nof the American engineer, Hugh Cooper. It was the largest, most\r\nspectacular, and most popular of all the immense projects of the First\r\nFive-Year Plan. It was the principal source of hydroelectric power for\r\nthe Ukraine.\r\n\r\nDuring all the years under the Soviet government the Russian people\r\nhad to do without romance, until the Five-Year Plan was begun. Then\r\nthey began to find glamour in statistics. They glorified in figures\r\nshowing that this or that project in the Soviet Union was the largest\r\nof its kind in the world. The Dnieper dam when it was built was the\r\nbiggest on earth and so it occupied a place in the imagination and\r\naffection of the Soviet people difficult for us to realize. I remember\r\nstanding in the middle of the mile-long dam and listening to a young\r\nSoviet engineer rhapsodically exclaim: “You see there, that forest\r\nof cranes, that army of excavating machines! There is more machinery\r\nconcentrated on this construction site than was ever concentrated\r\nanywhere in the world! Look at those gravel mixers. We are pouring here\r\nfive thousand cubic meters of gravel, more per day than any body of men\r\never poured in the history of the world! See those immense snail-shaped\r\nturbo dynamos! They are the biggest ever made. We will supply more\r\nelectricity from a single point than ever....” And so he went on\r\nendlessly, and back in Moscow people would eagerly scan the newspapers\r\nfor the latest bulletins on Dnieprostroy.\r\n\r\nStalin’s order to destroy it meant more to the Russians emotionally\r\nthan it would mean to us for Roosevelt to order the destruction of the\r\nPanama Canal. Suppose our troops defending the canal were to have been\r\ndriven back by the invading Japanese until it became evident they would\r\ncapture the canal if we did not destroy it. If our troops then blew up\r\nthe locks, it would be an act of determination which could be compared\r\nto that of the Russians in blowing up the Dnieper dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Well then, doesn’t this prove that the Russians will fight to the\r\nbitter end and never make a separate peace?_\r\n\r\nA. Perhaps, but not necessarily. They may fight to the bitter end but\r\neven the Dnieper dam does not prove it. The task of Stalin, it appears\r\nnow, is by just such a demonstration of stubborn courage, to whittle\r\ndown Hitler’s demands until they reach Stalin’s ability to accede to\r\nthem. If he can get Hitler to offer to keep the Soviet government and\r\nbureaucracy in power and to withdraw the bulk of the German troops, and\r\nnot to demand too much in the way of demobilization of the Red Army,\r\nthe two tyrants might once more get together.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But why should Stalin quit? Why should he ever be willing to make\r\nsuch a compromise peace if in the long run he believes Germany will be\r\nbeaten?_\r\n\r\nA. Because the Soviet Union is not strong enough economically to go on\r\nfighting indefinitely, particularly if the industries and mines and\r\nagriculture of Southern Russia are cut off by the Germans. It would be\r\na miracle if the Russians could endure a long war. Most peoples have a\r\nsurplus they can do without in wartime. The Soviet Union has no surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What about the Chinese? They didn’t seem to have a surplus either,\r\nbut they have gone on fighting the Japanese now for over four years._\r\n\r\nA. That is true and important, but the Chinese economy was\r\ndecentralized. The Chinese lives locally. Chinese communities could\r\nbe cut off from the outside world and live almost normally. The\r\nSoviet economy is centralized, a closely knit system of collective\r\nfarms-mines-factories, which if ruptured at one point would tend to go\r\nto pieces. Nevertheless there is a significant similarity between the\r\nprimitive character of the Russian and the Chinese peasants, and their\r\nability to improvise a living and keep on fighting when more highly\r\ncivilized folk, as the French, would give in.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Under what circumstances do you think Hitler would offer Stalin a\r\ncompromise peace?_\r\n\r\nA. The moment he believes he has defeated the Red Army sufficiently\r\nto force Stalin to accept a peace which would include substantial\r\ndemobilization of the Red Army--enough to ensure that it could not\r\nbe used for a sudden attack on the German Army after it had returned\r\nits attention to the West. It is probable that Hitler had much more\r\ntotalitarian goals in view when he first attacked Russia; but the Red\r\nArmy has probably made him content for the moment with less.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Isn’t there some evidence that Hitler is after an all-out victory\r\nover Russia and intends no compromise, but complete conquest?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, the most direct evidence we have of such an intention is\r\ncontained in his speech of September 12, 1936 at Nuremberg, when he\r\nsaid: “If the Ural mountains with their immeasurable wealth of raw\r\nmaterials, Siberia with its rich forests, and the Ukraine with its\r\nimmense grain fields, were lying within Germany, this country under\r\nNational Socialist leadership would be swimming in wealth. We would\r\nproduce so much that every single German would have more than enough to\r\nlive on.”\r\n\r\nThis does not sound as though he intended to stop short of anything,\r\nbut the fact still remains that unless he believes he can make\r\npeace with the West (and he cannot have much hope for that after\r\nthe Roosevelt-Churchill proclamations of peace terms), his most\r\nadvantageous solution of the war would be compromise, with Stalin or\r\nsome other Russian leader as his Gauleiter.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Wouldn’t Hitler obtain more supplies if he took them than if he\r\ntrusted to the Soviets to deliver them, even if they promised to do so\r\nafter having been conquered?_\r\n\r\nA. Not for a very long time, probably several years. If Hitler,\r\ncompletely defeating the Red Army, were to try to replace the Soviet\r\nsystem with something of his own devising, imagine the chaos! There are\r\nseveral million employees of the Soviet bureaucracy. Suppose they all\r\nsabotaged as the Czarist bureaucracy sabotaged the Bolsheviks when they\r\nseized power. It took the Bolsheviks five years to work back up from\r\nstarvation in 1918 to the level of subsistence in 1923.\r\n\r\nSuppose the scorched-earth policy is extended to the oil fields of\r\nthe Caucasus. Really determined skilled effort can make an oil field\r\nunproductive for a year or more. To pursue the Red forces into the\r\nUrals and beyond and then to hold down the whole country would be a\r\ntask which would absorb the energies of even the German war machine.\r\nThere would thus be bargaining points on both sides.\r\n\r\nHitler could say to Stalin: “I can utterly destroy you and your system\r\nif I choose.” Stalin could say to Hitler: “Yes, but I can make your\r\nconquest futile as far as supplies are concerned, and if you try to\r\ndestroy me and my system I will starve you and tire you until you are\r\ntoo weak to win in the West.” Stalin’s argument might well run that by\r\nmaking a compromise peace he could save something, including his own\r\njob, from the wreck; then by waiting patiently for the victory of the\r\nAllies which he probably foresees in the long run, he would win back\r\neverything, just as the Bolsheviks did after they had deserted the\r\nAllies in the first World War.\r\n\r\nHitler, on the other hand, knows that without Stalin’s help he cannot\r\nbegin to obtain the materials he needs from Russia in time to serve his\r\nnecessity. Douglas Miller points out that in the two summers of 1917\r\nand 1918 when the Germans occupied the Ukraine, they got only 43,000\r\nsmall carloads of grain, which scarcely paid the costs of occupation.\r\nOnly with Stalin as his Gauleiter can Hitler make his Russian\r\ninvestment pay economically during the critical next two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What would be the effect of such a compromise peace between Germany\r\nand Russia on the United States and Great Britain?_\r\n\r\nA. It would be a disaster even worse than the signing of the original\r\nSoviet-German pact in August 1939.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why worse? It would be just about the same, wouldn’t it?_\r\n\r\nA. No, because this time Hitler would have obtained what he thought he\r\nhad obtained but had not obtained from Russia through his 1939 pact. He\r\nwould have nearly complete security on the Eastern frontier and would\r\nnot have to pin down there more than a fraction of the divisions he had\r\nthere from 1939 on.\r\n\r\nHe would have obtained guaranteed deliveries of the oil and grain and\r\nother products he needs. His guarantee would be the disarmament of the\r\nRed Army to the point where the Germans could march in at any moment\r\nand enforce their demands. He would also have obtained the right to\r\nmarch his troops across the Ukraine, or sail across the Black Sea and\r\nfrom the Caucasus drive at Suez, or eventually India. Furthermore\r\nthe re-neutralization, or the military emasculation, of the Soviet\r\nUnion would free Japan’s rear from the danger of attack, and would\r\nproportionately increase the chances of Japan’s attacking southward in\r\nthe area of our vital interests. Such a compromise peace would enable\r\nHitler to endure many years longer than if he had to fight on to the\r\ncomplete conquest of Russia, against a nationwide, scorched-earth,\r\nguerilla warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You make it seem as though a compromise peace were quite possible.\r\nWhy then did Stalin fight at all?_\r\n\r\nA. You mean, when the Germans attacked? Because he was given no choice.\r\nThere was rumor of Hitler’s having submitted an ultimatum or terms to\r\nStalin, but as it turned out Hitler submitted no demands at all; he\r\nsimply attacked.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why didn’t Hitler at least make the attempt and demand of Stalin\r\nthe things he wanted, including the demobilization of the Red Army?_\r\n\r\nA. I suppose he knew that even Stalin could not successfully order\r\nthe demobilization of the Red Army without suffering the danger of\r\nrevolution. Hitler had successfully brought the armies of several\r\npowers under his control without fighting: Czechoslovakia, Hungary,\r\nRumania, Bulgaria, but they were small states which would never have\r\nstood a chance for more than a few hours or days of resistance against\r\nthe Germans. It seemed to many people that Hitler could have done the\r\nsame with Russia. The acquiescence of Stalin in every other German\r\ndemand encouraged this belief. But Hitler never made the trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _I still do not see why he did not try._\r\n\r\nA. Perhaps because of Napoleon. This is only a theory of mine, but in\r\nanalyzing Hitler’s motives for attacking Russia, it struck me that\r\nhis vanity may have led him to wish to impose his will by force upon\r\nStalin, his only remaining rival on the continent, and to do the\r\nthing Napoleon failed to do, conquer Russia. Hitler is an admirer of\r\nNapoleon. When he first visited Paris he spent half an hour alone\r\nby the tomb of Napoleon, then ordered the remains of Napoleon’s son\r\nbrought from Vienna to be re-interred beside his father. Hitler does\r\nnot collect ordinary Napoleonana as Mussolini does. Hitler collects the\r\nsame countries which Napoleon once collected or tried to collect. He is\r\nnot merely going over the same territory, he is consciously emulating\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nThe French Emperor’s excuse for attacking Russia was that Alexander\r\nrefused to join Napoleon’s blockade of England, the “Continental\r\nSystem.” Historians now agree, however, that Napoleon went into Russia\r\nin 1812 chiefly to satisfy his vanity and his lust for war and to\r\nappease his jealousy of Alexander, his only remaining rival on the\r\ncontinent. Alexander was willing to do almost everything Napoleon\r\nwanted, but Napoleon wanted to impose his will by force. So with\r\nHitler. He had even less excuse than Napoleon for attacking Russia.\r\n\r\nI share the opinion of many observers that Hitler could have had\r\nanything he liked from Stalin, beginning with the delivery of\r\nall available materials even if it meant stripping the Russians,\r\nand including the permission to pass troops through Russia, and\r\neven including perhaps consent to as much of a demobilization of\r\nthe Red Army as Stalin believed he could order without danger of\r\nrevolt--possibly enough to have satisfied Hitler that the Red Army\r\ncould not attack him. Nor does it seem likely that the Red Army ever\r\nwould have attacked the Germans except after they had definitely lost\r\nthe war in the West, and then it would have made little difference who\r\ndelivered the final blow.\r\n\r\nThe Russians would probably have behaved toward Germany exactly as the\r\nItalians behaved toward France. In their anxiety to run no risks, the\r\nItalians waited until their intervention made no difference; the French\r\nwere already defeated. So Stalin would probably have waited until the\r\nGerman Army was knocked out before he moved.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But wasn’t it likely that Stalin would have attacked if Hitler\r\nattempted to invade the British Isles?_\r\n\r\nA. Not unless it had become apparent that the invasion had not only\r\nfailed but that the German Army had lost practically all its Air Force\r\nand was about to collapse. If this contention is correct, there was no\r\ndanger to Hitler from the Russians, and the material supplies he seeks\r\ncould certainly have been obtained in greater quantity by peaceful\r\ncoercion than by war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You have given us quite a number of strong points of the Soviet\r\nUnion. Can you outline its weak points?_\r\n\r\nA. Without pleasure. It is no pleasure to expose the demerits of a\r\nforce which for the time being, at any rate, is fighting against our\r\nmajor enemy, and has fought gallantly and has lost more blood than\r\nall the other opponents of our enemy put together. Yet it seems to\r\nme useful always to keep our eyes open and to know as much as we can\r\nabout the characteristics of friend and foe and especially of the sort\r\nof ally which has the ambiguous role of the Soviet Union toward both\r\nBritain and America, neither friend nor foe, but possessed merely of\r\nthe same enemy.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental weakness of the Soviet Union and the root of all its\r\nevil is the fact that the Bolsheviks believe and practice as their\r\nfirst rule of political conduct that the end justifies the means. This\r\nrule led to adoption of the Terror as the chief weapon in the struggle\r\nto establish Socialism, and the Terror in turn made it impossible to\r\nestablish Socialism. The Terror destroyed democracy. Without political\r\ndemocracy, the vaunted economic democracy of the Soviet Union became\r\na farce. Constant coercion of the masses through the Terror benumbed\r\nthem. Production was concentrated on war materials and the output of\r\nconsumption goods never rose above subsistence level. The Soviet Union\r\nbecame a permanent pauper state. The level from the standpoint of\r\nculture and comfort remained barbarian, but the Russians showed they\r\nhad the virtues of barbarians. When the time came to fight they proved\r\nthey could stand up better to their Nazi brother barbarians than any of\r\nthe civilized folk of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe principle that the end justifies the means works in wartime as\r\nit is a barbarous principle and war is a barbarous business, and that\r\nis one reason why the Russians have done as well as they have against\r\nthe Germans. In peacetime the principle that the end justifies the\r\nmeans defeats itself because peaceful processes are not promoted by\r\nviolence. The Bolsheviks used the Terror to force every member of the\r\nvast community of Russia into a pattern of National Planned Economy,\r\nbut after thirteen years of watching the Five-Year plans, now in the\r\nmidst of the Third, we can scan the whole Russian scene and soberly\r\nobserve that National Planned Terror plus Bolshevik zeal have not\r\nbeen able to produce anything like as much for the whole population\r\nas free capitalist economy running on the profit motive with a\r\ncompetitive labor market. I am not for Hoover capitalism, but even it\r\nis incomparably better than Stalin’s economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What authority have you to speak about Russia?_\r\n\r\nA. Possibly no authority, but a good deal of experience. I was for two\r\nyears a correspondent in Moscow, from 1925 to 1927--that was during the\r\nNEP--and thereafter made three long trips and visited every part of the\r\ncountry from Vladivostok to Odessa and Leningrad to Tiflis. I was the\r\nfirst correspondent to visit the huge industrial plants of the First\r\nFive-Year Plan from the Urals to the Caucasus, and after a 17,000-mile\r\ntrip which lasted three months I wrote a series of twenty-four\r\narticles, which were given a Pulitzer prize. That was in 1930, and I\r\nmade another study trip in 1934 and another in 1937. I keep up as well\r\nas one can by diligent reading and contact with friends fresh from the\r\nSoviet Union and it appears that the conditions there today, aside from\r\nthe war, are about as they were when I was last there. Most capitalist\r\ncritics of the Soviet Union oppose it because it has done away with\r\nthe institution of private property and of profit, and substituted\r\na collectivist system. It would not make much difference to these\r\ncapitalist critics whether the Soviet collectivist system worked or\r\nnot. What irks them is that it has eliminated the form of economic\r\norganization which has enabled them to become well to do.\r\n\r\nThis is not of any interest to me. The only thing that interests me\r\nabout the Soviet collectivist system is whether it works or not. If it\r\nworks better than ours, to bring more happiness to everybody in the\r\ncommunity than our system, then let us have it. But the trouble with\r\nthe Soviet collectivist system is that it simply does not work to make\r\nmen happier. It’s only success has been to make men fight. That is what\r\nwe need now, but it is not enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Can you prove that the Soviet system does not work?_\r\n\r\nA. I am not going to try to do it with statistics. I have played and\r\nworked and sweated with Soviet statistics as much as the next man, but\r\nif there ever was a country on earth where the old saying, “Figures\r\ndon’t lie but liars figure,” is true, it is the Soviet Union, where\r\navowedly and openly it is announced that the Statistical Office must\r\nconsider itself in the service of propaganda for the national good. I\r\ncan give you only a reproduction of the impressions I had, and which\r\nyou would have had if you had been with me.\r\n\r\nThe two chief impressions you get from the Soviet Union are its extreme\r\npoverty and the all-pervading Terror. True, the Terror diminishes as\r\none gets away from Moscow and the large cities, but it is present\r\nin greater or less degree everywhere. The population as a whole is\r\ndesperately poor and always afraid. I thought when I read of the German\r\nattack on the Soviet Union, and then of the valiant initial Soviet\r\nresistance, that the war must have come to the Soviet population as a\r\nsort of release.\r\n\r\nAlthough “the NKVD instituted severe police measures to round up Fifth\r\nColumnists,” nevertheless the net effect of the impact of the war\r\nupon the Soviet population must have been very much like the opening\r\nof jail doors. The national emergency and the necessity for all to\r\nget together and fight for their lives, I am sure had an inspiriting\r\neffect even greater than it would have in a less primitive Western\r\ncommunity. That wartime spirit of exaltation is not true of the Soviet\r\nUnion in peacetime. In ordinary times, the Soviet population is\r\nsurely the unhappiest 200,000,000 ever to live under one flag in one\r\nvast succession of barracks and slums covering one-sixth of the land\r\nsurface of the globe and stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Black\r\nSea and from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Baltic. Think of that immense\r\narea with its huge population and reflect that from one end of the\r\ncountry to the other there cannot be found a single household (aside\r\nfrom those of high Soviet officials, and a few artists, journalists,\r\nand other privileged classes--not more than a few thousand out of\r\n200,000,000) possessing the food, clothing, furniture, the necessities\r\nand conveniences of an ordinary workman’s family in the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of warfare and bombing and blockade it would be\r\ndifficult to find in all England a workman compelled to live as\r\nuncomfortably, unhygienically, and with as poor food and clothing\r\nas the ordinary Moscow workman. The average family on relief in\r\nAmerica lives better than the privileged Moscow workman’s family. I\r\nparticularly emphasize “Moscow workman” because he is the best-off\r\nperson in the Soviet Union with the exception of the tiny privileged\r\ngroup I have mentioned. The revolution was made for the proletariat and\r\nwhat there is to enjoy goes to the workman.\r\n\r\nThe peasants on their collective farms live on the whole on a level\r\nbeneath that of any large group of white people in the world. The\r\nSoviet peasant’s condition is substantially that of a serf. He is bound\r\nto his collective and may not leave without permission. He is paid\r\nchiefly in kind and his pittance of cash is almost useless, since there\r\nare such small supplies of anything in the stores to buy. He eats day\r\nin and day out, year in and year out, for breakfast, dinner, and supper\r\nblack bread and cabbage soup and little else.\r\n\r\nThe average Russian peasant does not taste meat more than a few times\r\na year. He is able to live on this diet because his black rye bread\r\ncontains everything necessary for complete nutrition save fat, which\r\nhe gets from a meager ration of salt pork. His relationship to the\r\ncollective is the relationship of serf to master. The serf under\r\nthe Czar could be punished by his master; so can the Soviet serf be\r\npunished by the NKVD, without trial, and whereas under the Czar the\r\nlandowner had no power of life and death over his serfs, the NKVD has\r\nthat power not only over the peasants but over every human being in the\r\nSoviet Union except Stalin himself and his immediate cohorts.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _If the peasant is such a serf, why has he not revolted now that the\r\nadvance of Hitler’s armies has given him a chance to do so?_\r\n\r\nA. It may sound flippant but it is the sober truth that the Russian\r\npeasant serf does not know that he is a serf; he is convinced that\r\nhe lives better than any farm hand in the world. He has utterly no\r\nstandard of comparison. He is as incapable of judging his position\r\nin the world as the Eskimos in _Kabloona_ who had never seen a white\r\nman until Gontran de Poncins visited them. The Russian peasant is as\r\nshut off from the outside world as an inhabitant of old Japan before\r\nPerry. Within his world he has no neighbors better off than himself.\r\nThis makes him a happier man than if he were able to observe and become\r\nenvious of more pleasant ways of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is the NKVD?_\r\n\r\nA. That is the name given the Soviet Political Police in 1934. It has\r\nhad three names, first the Cheka, then the G.P.U., pronounced Gay Pay\r\nOo, and now NKVD, pronounced En Kah Vay Day, which is an abbreviation\r\nfor the _Narkomvnudel_, itself an abbreviation of four Russian words\r\nmeaning Peoples Commissariat of Internal Affairs. Whenever the\r\nPolitical Police has accumulated too much blood on its name, it is\r\nchanged, but its functions remain the same: to administer the Terror.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Are the people in the collective farms better off than when they\r\nwere individual farmers?_\r\n\r\nA. I did not know the Russia of the Czars, but the peasant himself gave\r\na very good answer to that when he refused to go into the collectives,\r\nand rather than enter with his livestock, killed it by the thousands\r\nof head, until within a year more than half the cattle, horses, pigs,\r\nand sheep of the country had been slaughtered. The Soviet Union has\r\nnot yet entirely recovered from this animal massacre. The peasants\r\nslaughtered their livestock because once collectivized, the livestock\r\npassed completely out of control of the peasants. Stalin later conceded\r\neach collective farm peasant the right to own one cow and one pig as\r\nhis private possession. Otherwise the members of the collective may not\r\ndispose of the product of their own toil.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But isn’t that precisely the nature of a collective, for all\r\nmembers to pool their resources and labor and then draw the dividends?_\r\n\r\nA. That is the theory, but the dividends for the Soviet peasant consist\r\nof the barest subsistence. They must turn over to the State trusts\r\na stipulated amount or share of whatever their collective produces,\r\nwheat, or dairy products, beef or pork, and this share is usually so\r\nhigh that there is nothing left for the peasants to eat but black bread\r\nand cabbage. It is the settled policy of the Five-Year Plans to take\r\nfrom the soil all its produce except the minimum subsistence for the\r\npeasants and devote it to industrialization, by distribution at high\r\nprices to the workmen, and by export, in exchange for machines from\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Then, surely the Russian workman is much better off, since the\r\nwhole system is supposed to be for the benefit of the proletariat._\r\n\r\nA. He is better off than the peasant, but he is worse off than any\r\nother white workman in the world. In the winter of 1934-1935 I made\r\na survey of the Russian standard of living and compared it with\r\nthe standard of living in capitalist states. In order to make the\r\ncomparison as fair as possible I chose the little capitalist states\r\nwhich used to be a part of Imperial Russia--Finland, Esthonia, Latvia,\r\nLithuania, and Poland.\r\n\r\nFirst I spent two months in Moscow, studying the standard of living\r\nof the workmen in the best Moscow factories. These workmen were more\r\nfavorably situated than any others in the Soviet Union. Then I spent\r\nthree months studying the standard of living of typical working-class\r\nfamilies in the little capitalist states. To my surprise I found\r\nthat the poorest workmen’s families in the capitalist states lived\r\nconsiderably better than the Moscow workers, who were the most\r\nprosperous in all Russia.\r\n\r\nThis was after seventeen years of Communism, and the capitalist states\r\nused for comparison were among the poorest in the world. They had all\r\nsuffered more from the World War than Russia as a whole had suffered,\r\nand they began their new national lives from scratch, without capital\r\nor credit. Yet the average workman in Finland, Esthonia, Latvia,\r\nLithuania, and Poland was living at least twice as well as the best-off\r\nworkmen in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How did you get your facts?_\r\n\r\nA. By visiting scores of homes and talking with the housewives. I asked\r\neach one fifty to a hundred questions, and found out the total family\r\nincome, how it was earned, and how it was spent. Then I made up a\r\ntheoretical basket, to contain a week’s supply of food for a workman,\r\nand found out by direct inquiry the number of hours a man would have\r\nto work to earn the basket. I found that in order to buy the basket the\r\nSoviet workman had to spend an average of twice as many working hours\r\nas his fellow worker in the small capitalistic states, while he would\r\nhave to spend over three times as many working hours as a workman in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe Moscow workers, as the workers in most parts of the Soviet Union,\r\nlive in barracks, one or more families to a room, brutally overcrowded.\r\nThe Soviet Union has never succeeded in solving its housing problem and\r\nseems, indeed, to be slipping steadily backward, each year jamming more\r\nand more people into tenements fantastically full. It is not unusual\r\nto find four families sharing a single room. Imagine how much privacy\r\nthey have, with each family’s quarter of the room partitioned off by a\r\nhanging sheet. In the little capitalist states, many workmen had their\r\nown cottage homes, a thing utterly unknown in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe food eaten by the capitalist workmen was incomparably better in\r\nquality and greater in quantity than the Soviet workman’s food. The\r\nclothing worn by the Soviet workmen and their families was pathetically\r\nthreadbare, sleazy and cheap, while the capitalist workmen were\r\nwell-dressed in comparison. Now these Russian workmen, it must be\r\nremembered, were in the midst of their Second Five-Year Plan, and\r\nwere the recipients of the cream of its production. They were the\r\nbeneficiaries of that vast scheme of National Planned Economy which was\r\nto produce so much more efficiently than the capitalist system that\r\nbefore long everybody in the Soviet Union would be living like rich\r\nmen in the United States. It was their idea that the time would soon\r\ncome when production of every conceivable kind of commodity would be\r\nso prolific in the Soviet Union that everybody could have his every\r\nmaterial want satisfied. “From each according to his ability--to each\r\naccording to his need,” the classic Communist ideal would be finally\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nNow after twenty-three years of trial it seems certain that in\r\nplace of Soviet State Capitalism, any form of private capitalism\r\nunder a democracy would have given Russia not only the blessings of\r\nindividual liberty, but far greater industrial production, which of\r\ncourse is the prime measure of any economic system’s success. This is\r\nnot a mere speculation. If you take the graph of Imperialist Russian\r\nindustrial production before the last war, and prolong it over the\r\nnext twenty-three years at the same rate of increase as the years\r\n1900 to 1914, you will find that Czarist Russia would have produced\r\nmore in 1940 than the Soviet Union with all its Five-Year Plans. What\r\nRussia could have accomplished under a liberal democratic, or a free\r\ndemocratic-socialist regime, we can only guess.\r\n\r\nBoth Lenin and Trotzky once remarked that no matter what else the\r\nSoviet Union did, if it did not succeed in producing more than the\r\ncapitalist system produced, the Soviet system must be called a failure.\r\nIf it is objected that the Soviet Union had to spend its surplus\r\non defense, one can reply that a system which is so poor that the\r\npopulation has to live on a bare subsistence level in order to maintain\r\nits armed services, is a failure also. Twenty-three years is a long\r\nenough trial for any system to show at least some hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is State Capitalism and what has this to do with the war?_\r\n\r\nA. It has a great deal to do with the war, because Soviet weakness\r\ntempted Hitler to attack and Soviet weakness is a direct outcome\r\nof Soviet State Capitalism. This term means that the State is the\r\nmonopolizer of all industry, trade, and agriculture. It is the sole\r\nemployer. It is the owner and manager of all factories, mines, shops,\r\nfarms, fisheries, transport systems, in short of every means of\r\nproduction and distribution in the country.\r\n\r\nNo one can work for any other employer except the State and the State\r\nhas absolute power to order every minute detail of the daily lives of\r\nits employees, the whole population. The Soviet workman is no less a\r\nserf than the Soviet peasant, for the workman also cannot leave his job\r\nwithout permission, and he also has no control of any kind over his\r\nemployer, no means of bringing pressure on him, because his employer\r\nis the State and the State is not elected, but its representatives are\r\nappointed from the top down, beginning with Stalin.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You say the State is not elected, but how about the Soviet\r\nelections we hear about?_\r\n\r\nA. The voters are presented with a ticket chosen by the Party and they\r\nare allowed to accept the Party candidates. Citizens of the Soviet\r\nUnion have exactly as much voice in their government as citizens of\r\nNazi Germany have in theirs, that is, none at all. It is nevertheless\r\ninteresting to note that the tyrant in the Soviet Union still thinks\r\nit worth while to preserve the farce of elections while the tyrant in\r\nGermany has apparently dispensed with them altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But cannot the Soviet workmen bring pressure to bear on the\r\nauthorities by striking?_\r\n\r\nA. Strikes have been outlawed _de facto_ in the Soviet Union since its\r\nearliest years. Soviet trades unions are merely the instruments for\r\nhelping the State enforce discipline. They are the classic type of\r\ncompany unions. We can sum up this aspect of Soviet State Capitalism by\r\nsaying that whereas this form of collectivism was intended originally\r\nto free the workman from all the disabilities, injustices, and\r\ninequalities suffered by the workman under the individual capitalist\r\nemployer, all that has happened is that the workman has exchanged a\r\ncomparatively weak, sometimes well-meaning, individual or corporate\r\ncapitalist employer for a monster, all-powerful, completely egocentric,\r\nimpersonal, soulless monopoly, the State, which has all the faults of\r\nthe worst individual employer multiplied a millionfold. It is just as\r\ngreedy as the worst individual, but has no check upon its greed, and\r\nit is never as efficient as the least efficient individual. It is Jack\r\nLondon’s Iron Heel in reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _It was the original Bolshevik theory, was it not, that their\r\nPlanned National Economy would be superior to Unplanned Capitalist\r\nEconomy because it would prevent the cyclic recurrence of economic\r\ncrises, such as 1929-1930? It was to end all booms and depressions by\r\nending overproduction. Hasn’t the Soviet Union done at least that much?_\r\n\r\nA. We cannot tell, because the Soviet Union has never, in the\r\ntwenty-three years of its existence, had anything like sufficient\r\nproduction, much less overproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why couldn’t the Soviet Planned Economy succeed?_\r\n\r\nA. We can split the total failure into five parts: First, failure\r\nadequately to replace the profit system; second, failure of planned\r\nproduction; third, failure of planned distribution; fourth, failure\r\nof the monetary system; fifth, failure of Soviet construction to keep\r\nup with deterioration. Behind all these four failures looms the black\r\nfather of them all, the Terror.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why do you devote so much importance to the Soviet Terror?_\r\n\r\nA. From having witnessed its importance in the Soviet Union. Aside\r\nfrom that, we ought to be able to recognize purely theoretically its\r\nparamount role in any attempt swiftly to transform an individualistic\r\nsociety into a collectivist society. For thousands of years men have\r\nbeen living more or less free individual lives. Suddenly it is decided\r\nto create a collective, as the Bolsheviks decided in Russia. At the\r\ntime of the Revolution there were said to have been no more than ten\r\nthousand Bolsheviks. Eventually they were to impose their will upon\r\n200,000,000 people and reorganize them into a vast, badly functioning,\r\nbut nevertheless authentic anthill. To do this as swiftly as the\r\nBolsheviks wanted it done required compulsion, applied without stint,\r\nto every unit in the ant heap. Having no say in the matter these\r\nmultitudes of human beings were required to change every habit of their\r\nlives; were ordered even to change their instincts. It took unlimited\r\ncompulsion to achieve a semblance of the goal. The instrument of\r\ncompulsion was the Terror.\r\n\r\nIt produced an ant heap, but the ant heap never was able to do more\r\nthan provide minimum food, lodging, and clothing for its ants. For a\r\nlong time outside observers leniently agreed that this must be due\r\nto the strain of reorganizing an individualistic into a collectivist\r\nsociety, but now that a generation has passed, the tendency is to\r\nconsider that more fundamental faults are to blame.\r\n\r\nFirst, it appeared that the motive for work was not so effective in\r\nthe ant heap as it was in the outside world, since from the day of\r\nits foundation until this moment the Soviet workman has produced less\r\nper capita per hour than capitalist workmen anywhere in the world.\r\nFurthermore, higher ranks, as engineers, technicians, superintendents,\r\nmanagers, and directors in the Soviet Union were so notably inefficient\r\ncompared with their capitalist colleagues that for a time the anthill\r\nauthorities imported and paid highly trained specialists from the\r\noutside world to set an example and teach.\r\n\r\nThis effort too was a failure, as Soviet production usually declined to\r\nits original level after departure of the foreign specialist. Also the\r\nmen of enterprise who in a free society risk their capital and brains\r\nto found factories, dig mines, and sometimes swindle their fellow men,\r\nwere assigned in the anthill to the Gosplan, the Government Planning\r\nCommission. There, in the effort to plan production for 200,000,000\r\npeople, the anthill failed most dismally. The conclusion was that the\r\ncollective with its rigid wage scales, limited incomes, prohibited\r\nlabor market, and ban on profits had not provided a motive for work\r\nas stimulating and productive as the profit motive and the competitive\r\nwage system in the free capitalist world.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How can you call it a free capitalist world? There isn’t any\r\nfreedom left in the capitalist world. Look at all the checks on\r\nbusiness here in the United States. Do you consider our farmers free?\r\nThey can’t even plant what they want._\r\n\r\nA. Yes, I call it free, as free as bird life compared with the Soviet\r\nUnion or with Nazi Germany. The trouble with you and with all of us\r\nwho complain about the checks on business, on agriculture, and so\r\non, is that we lack the experience of being really without freedom.\r\nUnless you have lived in a slave state, under a real tyranny, you\r\nsimply do not know what freedom means. All these checks about which you\r\ncomplain are legal checks imposed by law made by representatives of\r\nyour choosing and passed upon by courts which are eventually also of\r\nyour choosing, and drawn within a constitution which was also chosen\r\nand is now maintained by the people’s free will. If you dislike any of\r\nthese checks, you have only to get a majority to agree with you and you\r\ncan change it. To compare the lack of absolute freedom in our world\r\nwith the absolute lack of freedom in the totalitarian world, whether\r\nBolshevik or Nazi, is the same as to compare a traffic policeman with\r\nthe warden of a penitentiary.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely this effort at penitentiary production on a\r\ncontinental scale that broke down the Russian effort at planned\r\nnational economy. It proved impossible to plan effectively for so\r\nenormous an aggregate of human beings every detail of their production.\r\nA few of the population, perhaps two per cent, were zealous Communists\r\nwho were willing to work harder to make the collective successful than\r\nthey would have worked for any amount of profit.\r\n\r\nTerror was used to make the other ninety-eight per cent fit in and\r\nwork. But the Terror took away from the managers, supervisors, and\r\ntechnicians the willingness to take responsibility. A mistake, honest\r\nthough it might be, could cost a factory manager his life. In the\r\nSoviet Union the man who makes a mistake is automatically suspected and\r\naccused of sabotage. The only way to be safe is to make no decisions,\r\npass every responsibility to a higher authority. This is the rule today\r\nthroughout the Soviet economic apparatus.\r\n\r\nParallel with this effect of the Terror is the benumbing influence of\r\nthe unforgiving rigidity of the Plan. Each factory manager is given a\r\nquota to fulfill. Quotas are calculated at a trifle more than normal\r\nmaximum capacity. No excuses are accepted for nonfulfillment. In the\r\nchaos of Soviet economic life it is seldom that raw materials, fuel,\r\ntools, and labor can easily be brought together to fulfill a quota,\r\nyet failure may cost the factory manager “liquidation,” which means\r\nanything from dismissal or exile at hard labor to death.\r\n\r\nConsequently, nearly all quotas are fulfilled in quantity, but quality\r\nis in practice ignored. The number of units of production is easily\r\nchecked; quality is more difficult to check. Hence, Soviet industrial\r\nproduction is lower in quality than in the capitalist world, and this\r\nis a partial explanation for the divergence between Soviet industrial\r\nstatistics which show a high level of production, and the facts of\r\nSoviet economic life which demonstrate to the naked eye how low the\r\nlevel of production is. Some observers have estimated that at least\r\nthirty per cent should be taken off all Soviet industrial production\r\nstatistics to allow for the quantities of entirely unusable goods\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But we used to prize highly many objects of Russian manufacture,\r\nand you can still see in jewelry and antique stores all kinds of finely\r\nmade things, enamel work, and leather goods, wonderfully printed books.\r\nWhat has become of them?_\r\n\r\nA. Nearly all that fine handicraft is gone now. The Russian artisan\r\nused to be one of the best in the world. Home handicrafts formerly\r\nsupplied a sizable fraction of Russian consumption goods, not only\r\nthe things you mention, but furniture, pottery, textiles--wonderful\r\nhand-woven linen and wool--and lacquer work. Most of these artisans,\r\nor such of them as outlived the hardships of the Revolution, have\r\nbeen forced into factories today to turn out mass production articles\r\ninferior to any in the world, including the Japanese.\r\n\r\nI often wonder what a Moscow citizen would say if he could walk through\r\nan American five-and-ten-cent store. I am sure he would think he was\r\nbeing deceived. He could not imagine such a wealth of high-grade,\r\nluxurious articles. Once one of the younger members of the Rosenwald\r\nclan visited Moscow and as we looked in the pitiful shopwindows I\r\nremarked that if he wanted to start a revolution in Russia all he\r\nwould have to do would be to distribute a few million Sears Roebuck\r\ncatalogues among the workers and peasants of the greatest poorhouse in\r\nhistory. Such a system of nationwide mail-order distribution would be\r\nutterly beyond the comprehension of a Soviet citizen, for one of the\r\nweakest links in the weak chain of Soviet economy is the distribution\r\nof goods.\r\n\r\nPoor as the goods are, they are not so poor as the method of putting\r\nthem in the hands of the consumers. Since there is always a goods\r\nshortage, the consumer is placed in the permanent position of a\r\nsupplicant, glad to get anything even if it is a substitute for a\r\nsubstitute for the article he wants. Allocation of the scanty supplies\r\nis made from the top down. The local community is not asked what it\r\nneeds. The Planners arbitrarily ship certain quantities of shoes, hoe\r\nhandles, and seed, and the recipients have learned to be grateful, no\r\nmatter if what they needed was kerosene, matches, and cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But you said something about the monetary system, that it had\r\nfailed too. How can a monetary system fail in a completely planned\r\nnational economy?_\r\n\r\nA. The monetary system under the Soviets seems just as difficult to\r\nhandle as it is in the capitalist system. The authorities incessantly\r\njuggle wages against prices, raising the one, lowering the other,\r\ninflating the currency, selling bonds and even lottery bonds, as\r\nblatantly gambling as the old Louisiana lottery. Yet the answer never\r\nseems to be achieved satisfactorily. Always the citizen’s purchasing\r\npower is behind his needs. Fundamentally, of course, the answer is that\r\nthere is never enough of anything to go around.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But isn’t the answer to that the fact that the Soviet State is\r\ntaking away from the citizens today in order to invest in productive\r\nindustry from which the citizens will draw a dividend tomorrow? At\r\nleast I should have thought that was the theory._\r\n\r\nA. That is the theory, but one of the tragic aspects of the epic\r\nstruggle of the Russian Bolsheviks to make their collectivist system\r\nwork is that their investments in factories and machinery wear out\r\nalmost as fast and sometimes faster than they can replace them and\r\nbuild new ones. The bad workmanship of the buildings and the poor\r\nquality and rough handling of the machines results in a speed of\r\ndeterioration far beyond the normal in the capitalist world. If they\r\nhad given their population slightly better food and living conditions\r\nand had therefore been compelled to limit their investment in new\r\nbuildings and machines to something like a capitalist standard of new\r\ninvestment, deterioration would probably have taken away more plant\r\nthan they could replace.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How do you explain such inefficiency and wastefulness?_\r\n\r\nA. For all the reasons given before, and for another which I left for\r\na different category since it is, so to speak, historical, while these\r\nreasons we have discussed are current. The historical fact of import at\r\nleast during the life of this generation is that the Bolsheviks twice\r\nin twenty years exterminated their ablest people in the country, or\r\nrather I should say, the Bolsheviks first killed off the ablest people\r\nof old Russia and then Stalin killed off the ablest Bolsheviks. It has\r\nbeen so long ago, and the popular interest and sympathy in the Soviet\r\nexperiment was at the time so great, that we have almost forgotten what\r\nthe Bolsheviks did to their own countrymen.\r\n\r\nTheir conviction was that they could not establish Communism, or\r\nSocialism, without physically exterminating the persons who had\r\nbecome, under capitalism, better off than the mass of the people.\r\nThey reasoned that no capitalist, and by that they meant any person\r\nwho lived a little better than the poorest member of the community,\r\nwould ever tolerate willingly the establishment of a Socialist State.\r\nThey believed all such people would attempt to wreck the new Socialist\r\neconomy. The professional revolutionaries had spent half their lives\r\nattempting to wreck the capitalist system, and they attributed to the\r\ncapitalists a similar resolution.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the Nazis succeeded in coercing the capitalists into\r\nbecoming useful members of the National Socialist Collective. In\r\nRussia, the Bolsheviks set out to destroy the capitalists as a\r\nclass, or rather every human being who by his birth, or position, or\r\naccomplishment, had become identified as an active member of the old\r\nsystem. First, they killed off the aristocracy and landed proprietors,\r\nnumbering several hundred thousand, and including of course the\r\nCzar and his family. Then they exterminated the industrialists, not\r\nvery numerous, because Russia was the least industrialized of the\r\ngreat nations. Nevertheless they were important. With them a little\r\nlater were exterminated the managers, supervisors and technicians,\r\nthe scientists, the professional men, dentists, surgeons, lawyers,\r\nteachers, and judges. These numbered a million or more.\r\n\r\nBy the time I got to Russia in 1925 all these were fully exterminated.\r\nBy extermination I mean just that. They were either shot, or sent\r\ninto exile in the Arctic or the deserts of Central Asia, or condemned\r\nto penal labor under such conditions that they died within a few\r\nyears. They were nearly all killed. Only the most meager remnant\r\nremained, a few accidents of survival. I shall never forget the man\r\nwho peddled cigarettes. I shared a house in Moscow with Theo Seibert,\r\ncorrespondent of the _Hamburger Fremdenblatt_, today, alas, editor of\r\nthe _Voelkischer Beobachter_. Theo and I used to try to get the old man\r\nto talk, but he was too frightened to make much sense. The baldheaded\r\ntrembling man who begged us to buy his cigarettes had been a Justice of\r\nthe Moscow Supreme Court! His survival was just an accident.\r\n\r\nAfter this initial massacre the Bolsheviks let a pause ensue and\r\nfor several years no great killings took place, just the routine\r\nscore or so of executions per month. But when the Five-Year Plan was\r\ninaugurated, the decision was made to exterminate the kulaks. A kulak\r\nwas the term applied originally to a peasant who had risen sufficiently\r\nabove his neighbors to employ labor. That made him an exploiter, a\r\nperson who lived from the surplus value produced by his hired hands.\r\nThe Bolsheviks, however, chose to amplify this category to include all\r\npeasants who, even if they did not employ labor, had become in the\r\nleast degree more prosperous than their neighbors. This prosperity,\r\nbased for the most part upon the individual industry and sagacity\r\nof the kulak, might consist in the possession of two cows to the\r\nneighbor’s one. In any case the reasoning of the Bolsheviks was that\r\nthey could not afford to tolerate the existence of any peasant who,\r\nforced to join a collective farm, would at the beginning have to live\r\nworse than he had lived as an individual farmer.\r\n\r\nSuch peasants, the Bolsheviks reasoned, would be just as incorrigible\r\nenemies to collectivism as the aristocrats and industrialists. They\r\nhad to die. They did die. This was the greatest Soviet mass slaughter,\r\nbecause there were a great many more such peasants than there were\r\naristocrats, or industrialists, or intelligentsia. It took about two\r\nyears to do away with the kulaks. Tens of thousands of G.P.U. troops\r\nand agents sought out every family of better-than-average peasants\r\nthroughout the entire Soviet Union, and forced them into boxcars\r\nand herded them off to places of exile, down to Kazakstan or up to\r\nNarimsky Krai, to places where it was too hot or too cold to live. It\r\nis a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 of these more\r\nenterprising farm workers and their families died at once, or within a\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\nThis process destroyed what there was left of the originally\r\nnon-Communist party talent in Russia. You would have thought that this\r\nought to satisfy the Bolsheviks. It did, but it did not satisfy Stalin.\r\nThere was no more opposition to the Bolshevik program. There was not a\r\nhuman being left in Russia who had any connection with the old regime.\r\nNot in modern history has there been such a clean wiping of the slate.\r\nThe Bolsheviks were left not only as absolute masters, but containing\r\na country in which every living person was their hopeful or cowed\r\ncollaborator. Then came the fatal quarrel between Stalin and Trotzky.\r\nOut of this quarrel came the great purges by Stalin which destroyed for\r\nthe second time within a generation the principal talent of Russia.\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as the most fateful slaughter of all. Bolsheviks\r\ncould argue that the extermination of every vestige of Czarist Russia\r\ncould be justified on account of the inefficiency, inhumanity,\r\nunproductivity of the old regime, and the fact that, according to\r\nBolshevik reasoning, members of the old regime would never cooperate\r\nwith the new. But now Stalin was destroying not the old, but the new\r\nregime, all its talents, its best intellects, its best characters if\r\nyou like.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the politicians, he killed off in the course of four\r\nyears of uninterrupted purges, the top fourth or fifth, to estimate it\r\nconservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air Force\r\nleaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the foremost\r\ntechnicians, managers, supervisors, scientists. There is, of course,\r\nenough youth among 200,000,000 for the nation to recover even after\r\nsuch a purge. The youth whom Stalin spared have proved in battle how\r\nboundless are the forces of Russia, the first country Hitler ever\r\ntackled with lives to waste!\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You have not made it clear, if the Soviet system is so brutal a\r\ntyranny, how it is that the Red Army has been able to stand up so well\r\nto the Germans._\r\n\r\nA. The answer is that the Red Army has fought as Russians have always\r\nfought under any regime, bravely, enduringly, stubbornly, gallantly.\r\nRussians have always had to fight despite their government; as they did\r\nin the last war, as they are doing in this war. The general distaste\r\nof the outside world for the Bolshevik system led many to forget that\r\nthe Russian soldier retains in the Red Army all the martial virtues he\r\npossessed in the past. And have we forgotten that the Imperial Army in\r\nthe last war held the Germans for three years? If the Red Army does as\r\nwell we will be eternally thankful. True, the Germans in the last war\r\nhad to divide their forces into two fronts, while today the Red Army\r\nhas to bear the shock of nearly the full force of the whole German land\r\nforces. The task of the Red Army is accordingly heavier.\r\n\r\nBut our appraisal of the Red Army’s resistance has been strongly\r\ninfluenced by an element which has colored and distorted our judgment\r\nof the quality of any army which faces the Germans. That element is\r\nour recollection of the collapse of the French Army, which was due to\r\na score of causes besides the excellence of the German Army. It was\r\nso overwhelming, bewildering, and impressive that it gave rise to the\r\ninvoluntary, subconscious feeling that the Germans were invincible.\r\nNow when any troops stand up to the Germans we are inclined to judge it\r\na miracle of valor and military effectiveness. This is not to take away\r\none whit of the immense credit due the Russians for holding up Hitler’s\r\njuggernaut but it is fair to point out that if we had not seen France\r\nfall, if for example Germany had attacked Russia before attacking\r\nFrance, everybody would have expected the Russians to put up just\r\nabout the resistance they have put up. After all, Russia is a nation\r\nof double the population of Germany, with incomparably greater natural\r\nresources, and with twenty-three years of unflagging preparation for\r\nprecisely this war. If there had been the exceptional virtue in the\r\nSoviet collectivist system which is ascribed to it by its disciples in\r\nAmerica, it should not merely have stopped but should have defeated,\r\nrouted, and conquered the Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Aside from the fact that everybody was influenced by the French\r\nexample, most military experts seem to have been deceived about the\r\nfighting ability of the Red Army. Why was that?_\r\n\r\nA. It seemed almost as though Stalin wanted the outside world to\r\nthink his army less strong than it was. None but the most acute of\r\nprofessional observers, among them Colonel Faymonville, for years\r\nAmerican military attaché to Moscow, and now a member of the Allied\r\nmilitary mission there, had a correct view of the Red Army. Hitler for\r\nthe first time in his life admitted he had “had no idea” how strong the\r\nRed Army was. No outsider was ever allowed to see more than fragments\r\nof it. No newspaper correspondent, for example, ever put foot over the\r\nthreshold of a Red Army barracks. Maneuvers were nearly always carried\r\nout in secret without the presence of military attachés. One almost had\r\nthe feeling that Stalin had deliberately arranged the initial debacle\r\nof his attack on Finland in the first Soviet-Finnish war in order to\r\ndeceive the world into thinking his army inferior to its real strength.\r\nOf course that makes no sense, and the fact was that Stalin had been\r\nled to think he could walk over Finland with ease and hence had not\r\nproperly prepared his attack. Nevertheless the net effect of the first\r\nFinnish war combined with the secrecy thrown about the Red Army was to\r\nmake even military attachés in observation posts around Russia believe\r\nthe Red Army extremely weak. There was always the greatest difficulty\r\nin obtaining the most elementary facts about the Red Army. The Soviet\r\ngovernment published less about its military establishment than any\r\nother great power. It kept concealed the very existence of important\r\narmaments factories; it never published production figures in the arms\r\nindustry; it furnished the League of Nations less information about its\r\nvast army than any other members of the League. The G.P.U. Terror made\r\nit possible to envelop the Red Army in an impenetrable blanket which\r\neven the Germans were not able to pierce.\r\n\r\nThis secrecy emphasized the surprise that many felt at the outbreak of\r\nthe war, when the Soviet economy was now indisputably revealed to have\r\nbeen a totally one-purpose economy, for the single end of making war.\r\nEvery student of the Soviet Union had realized the great emphasis laid\r\nupon national defense, but everyone had supposed that at the same time\r\nthe Soviet Planners were working primarily, if ineffectively, to create\r\na thousand-purpose economy for the satisfaction of the myriad needs of\r\nthe population. No one had divined what turned out to be the fact, that\r\nthis huge economy was being organized for nothing but fighting.\r\n\r\nIt proved effective, as was to be expected. A brutal, simplified\r\neconomy which ignores most of the people’s wants and devotes all its\r\nenergy and materials to preparing for war, is better able to prepare\r\nand to make war than a more complete economy devoted to satisfying\r\nits people’s peacetime needs. Sparta was stronger in battle than\r\nAthens, but should we measure the value of a society by the efficiency\r\nwith which it makes war? If so, we ought to value the Nazis above\r\nall others, since they are still leading in this activity. Hitler’s\r\nsociety took Sparta as its model; Stalin’s took Spartacus. The Nazis\r\nmet their identical twin when they struck the Red Army in battle.\r\nHitler wishes us to believe he is crusading against a fundamentally\r\ndifferent regime in a “crusade for civilization.” We shall not be\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What would be the result if Stalin were really to try to hold out\r\nindefinitely? Could he do so? Has he the resources in the Urals to\r\ncarry on there?_\r\n\r\nA. He has almost everything he needs in the Urals except sufficient\r\noil. If he were cut off from oil in the Caucasus, he would have to\r\nimport supplies over the trans-Siberian, already overburdened. If he\r\nreally were determined to carry on in spite of all odds, and could make\r\nSverdlovsk or Cheliabinsk another Chungking, it would compel Hitler to\r\nkeep an important fraction of his total forces in action in Russia;\r\nit would probably prevent Hitler from being able to attempt to invade\r\nEngland; it would lead to a deadlock which could be turned into victory\r\nby our intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Would it be possible for us to supply the Russians with sufficient\r\nto make up for their losses? Could we enable them to carry on?_\r\n\r\nA. Our shipments to Russia are as important morally as materially;\r\nindeed their token strength is greater than their real strength. We\r\nshall never be able to make up for the territory Russia has lost to\r\nthe Germans--60 per cent of their steel supply, 45 per cent of their\r\nmanganese, 49 per cent of their tire production, and so on. Our\r\nshipments will always be limited by the transportation facilities of\r\nthe trans-Siberian railway and the route through Iran, both of which\r\nare long and time-consuming. Actually we can scarcely hope to get\r\nenough American supplies in the hands of the Red Army to make much\r\nreal difference before next spring, no matter how hard we try, and\r\nwe ought to do our best. It is the publicly announced policy of both\r\nWashington and London that Russia shall have priority on the vital\r\nwar materials. But everything is up to Stalin. If he wishes to quit\r\nand announce that he had not received sufficient aid from Britain and\r\nthe United States, he will be able to do so any time during the next\r\nseveral months, and make a case at least among his friends.\r\n\r\nIf Stalin decides to hold on, we have a two to one chance to beat\r\nHitler in the long run; if he decides to quit it means we face much\r\nworse odds. There is only one way we can persuade him that we are going\r\nto put our full powers into the struggle. It is our crystal-clear duty\r\nto ourselves, our children, and our national future to keep Stalin in\r\nthe war by ourselves going formally to war against Germany. It is a\r\ncrime against America to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What place do you think Churchill will have in history?_\r\n\r\nA. If Churchill brings his country victorious out of this war, he\r\nwill without a doubt go down as the greatest man in English history.\r\nNo Prime Minister of the sixty ministries since Walpole, and none of\r\nthe Monarchs when they exercised unlimited power, nor any Admiral or\r\nGeneral has upon his tombstone: “He saved England from death.” Many\r\nhave saved England from defeat. Many have added to England’s power and\r\nglory. But only Churchill will be entitled to the supreme rank, for\r\nnever before has England been threatened with the supreme penalty of\r\nnational extinction. Among the Prime Ministers Lloyd George would have\r\na place near Churchill, but the alternative to victory in the first\r\nWorld War was not the alternative in this war. Among the defenders of\r\nEngland, Nelson, Wellington, and the Great Duke of Marlborough would\r\nrank near Churchill. But the alternative to victory against Napoleon or\r\nLouis XIV was not the alternative England faces now. And no England of\r\nthe past ever faced such odds as Churchill and his people faced at the\r\nfall of France. Whatever the decision, Churchill has already achieved\r\ngreatness. This man who used to be accused of playing at politics and\r\nacting only for himself has been lifted by his responsibility to forget\r\nhimself in the Battle of Mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is Mr. Churchill really backed by all the British people?_\r\n\r\nA. Mr. Churchill is the most popular and trusted leader the British\r\npeople have had within the memory of living man. The man who caused\r\nthe defeat of the General Strike in 1926 is if anything more popular\r\namong the working classes than among the upper classes. In the House\r\nof Commons he usually receives heartier applause from Labor members\r\nthan from Conservatives even though he is the head of the Conservative\r\nparty. This is partly because the Conservatives cannot rid themselves\r\nof a tinge of resentment at the man who was always, consistently,\r\nunfailingly right about the coming of the war, and what it would be\r\nlike, while they were always, consistently, unfailingly wrong. The\r\nConservatives out of a rooted misconception of the character and\r\nintentions of Hitler, felt an instinctive sympathy for him almost up to\r\nthe time he actually began to drop bombs upon them. The Labor party on\r\nthe other hand shared Churchill’s antipathy for Hitler from the very\r\nbeginning, and there was thus early established a bond between the\r\ngreat British aristocrat and the British working classes which has been\r\ngreatly strengthened by his leadership of the war. I doubt if there\r\nis a single Labor party leader with as devoted a following among the\r\nBritish workers as Churchill has.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What part in the war has the British workingman played under\r\nChurchill’s leadership?_\r\n\r\nA. The British workingman, inspired and informed by Churchill, has been\r\nsuperbly and intelligently patriotic. It is this union of Churchill\r\nwith Labor which has warded off defeat in the most desperate hour,\r\nand which with our help will eventually win the war. British Labor’s\r\nattitude toward the struggle which will decide the fate of all the\r\nworld for generations to come is a reproach to that minority of\r\nAmerican labor which has failed to understand the fact that the liberty\r\nand the life of every individual American workingman depends on the\r\noutcome of this war. During those awful months following the evacuation\r\nof Dunkirk, the British trades unions voluntarily gave up all the\r\ntrades unions rules which, designed to protect the interests of labor\r\nin peacetime, hampered production and became a danger in war. They\r\nlengthened hours, took less pay for more work, stayed on the job to the\r\npoint of complete exhaustion. In the course of about three months the\r\nBritish workingman doubled the production of weapons and munitions, and\r\nalmost tripled airplane production by the end of the year. It could not\r\nhave been done without Churchill. From 1932 to 1939, for seven years,\r\nChurchill had been tirelessly teaching, preaching, exhorting, and\r\npleading with the British public and the British government to meet the\r\nGerman menace. By the time the war came the British working classes had\r\nlearned from Churchill what it was about. They learned much faster than\r\nthe Chamberlains and many a muddleheaded rich appeaser.\r\n\r\nAnother impressive sign of the wisdom of the British Labor Party from\r\nthe leaders to the rank and file is that you do not hear from them the\r\ndemands for a “definition of war aims” which are so loudly voiced by\r\ngroups of American liberals. These Americans who are so concerned about\r\nestablishing the chemical purity of British intentions, and who insist\r\non a blueprint of the peace settlement, and a guarantee that the world\r\nwill be made over in a style that meets with their approval--these\r\nAmericans show precisely the incomprehension of Hitler that Chamberlain\r\nshowed with his appeasement. Your ordinary British dock worker knows\r\nmore about the meaning of the war than scores of American intellectuals\r\nwho are still bleating about war aims. As the British Labor publicist,\r\nG. D. H. Cole, put it, “The Labor leaders and the great majority\r\nof their followers alike believed firmly that the defeat of Hitler\r\nmattered immeasurably more than anything else. For this reason they\r\nwere ready to put aside even their socialism and the greater part of\r\ntheir reforming policy and even to abstain from criticizing openly\r\nthe government’s mistakes rather than run any risk of dividing the\r\nnational elements which stood for a vigorous prosecution of the war.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is Churchill what you would call a realist or an idealist?_\r\n\r\nA. Churchill is both. He is a hardheaded, tough-minded idealist and\r\nan imaginative, generous realist. He is convinced that the policy\r\nwhich works for the good of all will also work best for the good of\r\nthe individual. This is the foundation stone of civilization. Hitler\r\nbelieves that the smart man is the man who exploits others. Hitler’s\r\nare the ethics of the “heel,” the gangster, the racketeer, the cheat\r\nwho is always on the lookout for a chance to swindle, or rob, betray,\r\nor murder for profit. The Churchill attitude is that of the moral man,\r\nthe member of society. The Hitler attitude is that of the amoral man,\r\nthe bandit preying upon society.\r\n\r\nI do not think Churchill is formally a religious man, although he\r\nattends divine services and thus sets an example for the nation under\r\nhis leadership. But Churchill’s beliefs add up to something closely\r\napproaching practical Christianity. It seems to me that very few\r\nAmericans really understand what Churchill stands for. He is so much in\r\nthe public eye as a war leader, that we are bound to think of him as\r\na warrior first. We forget or never were told that he is first of all\r\na builder. Before the war, in the field of international relations he\r\nbelieved passionately in the life-and-death necessity of sustaining the\r\nLeague, of collective security through the League.\r\n\r\nThen as now, and in England as here in America, there were great\r\nnumbers of persons who thought they were being hardheaded realists\r\nby rejecting the League as romantic. Their successors today are our\r\nisolationists or noninterventionists, as they shamefacedly call\r\nthemselves now. Churchill remorselessly revealed how suicidal was this\r\nrefusal to cooperate among nations for the maintenance of security for\r\nall. Long before Litvinoff coined the phrase Churchill was preaching\r\nthat “peace is indivisible,” that only through collective security\r\ncould the security of any single state be secured. His scorn for the\r\nBritish counterpart of our isolationists was withering: “It is of the\r\nutmost consequence to the unity of British national action that the\r\npolicy of adhering to the Covenant of the League of Nations shall not\r\nbe weakened or whittled away. I read in the _Times_ a few days ago a\r\nletter in which a gentleman showed that these ideas of preventing war\r\nby international courts and by reasonable discussion had been tried\r\nover and over again. He said they had been tried after Marlborough had\r\ndefeated Louis XIV and after Europe had defeated Napoleon, but, he\r\nsaid, they had always failed. If that is true it is a melancholy fact\r\nbut what was astonishing was _the crazy glee_ with which the writer\r\nhailed such lapses from grace. I was told the other day of a sentence\r\nof Carlyle’s in which he describes ‘the laugh of the hyena on being\r\nassured that, after all, the world is only carrion.’”\r\n\r\nIt is of course plain to everybody now that the world is being torn\r\napart because _crazy_ people prevented the League of Nations from\r\nfunctioning, _crazy_ people who believed they were as shrewd as the\r\nAmericans who today would like us to wait for the Germans to land on\r\nUnited States soil before we fight. It has always been considered by\r\ncheap and vulgar men that it is clever to be entirely selfish, and so\r\nour Lindberghs, Wheelers, and Nyes even whisper temptingly the base\r\nsuggestion that we may profit by this war if Britain falls and her\r\nEmpire crumbles. What retribution would be ours were we to listen to\r\nsuch voices! Churchill, whom no detractor has ever called a stupid\r\nman, is not afraid to come out boldly and declare: “I think we ought\r\nto place our trust in those moral forces which are enshrined in the\r\nCovenant of the League of Nations. Do not let us mock at them, for they\r\nare surely on our side. Do not mock at them for this may well be a time\r\nwhen the highest idealism is not divorced from strategic prudence.\r\nDo not mock at them, for these may be years, strange as it may seem,\r\nwhen Right may walk hand in hand with Might.” This he spoke in 1937.\r\nHow the words are crammed with meaning now for America whose vital\r\nself-interest to bring about the defeat of our enemy is identical with\r\nthe highest idealism.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Can Churchill be trusted?_\r\n\r\nA. I will answer by citing Mr. Churchill’s attitude toward Ireland. In\r\n1938 when the bill to turn the Irish naval bases back from British to\r\nIrish control was being discussed, Churchill protested that when war\r\ncame, if Ireland refused to lend the ports to England, there would be\r\nno way to get them back. Because, he said, “It will be no use saying,\r\n‘Then we will retake the ports.’ You will have no right to do so. To\r\nviolate Irish neutrality should it be declared at the moment of a\r\ngreat war may put you out of court in the opinion of the world and may\r\nvitiate the cause by which you may be involved in war. If ever we have\r\nto fight again we shall be fighting in the name of law, or respect for\r\nthe rights of small countries.” Can you imagine Hitler nourishing such\r\nscruples? Churchill has proved, moreover, the hardest way, that he\r\nmeant what he said. The British still abstain from occupying and using\r\nthe Irish ports. They have lost scores of ships to German submarines\r\nwhich might have been stopped if the Royal Navy had the use of the\r\nIrish bases. Many people think it wrong for the British to imperil\r\ntheir cause by respecting the neutrality of Ireland, which like every\r\nother country outside the Axis owes its hopes for national independence\r\nto a British victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What does Churchill think of the United States? I know that his\r\nmother was American and that now during the war he wants as much help\r\nfrom us as he can get, but what does he really think of America?_\r\n\r\nA. We can go as far back as 1932 and find that he had this to say: “Of\r\ncourse if the United States were willing to come into the European\r\nscene as a prime factor, if they were willing to guarantee to those\r\ncountries who take their advice that they would not suffer for it, then\r\nan incomparably wider and happier prospect would open to the whole\r\nworld. If they were willing not only to sign but to ratify treaties of\r\nthat kind, it would be an enormous advantage. It is quite safe for the\r\nBritish Empire to go as far in any guarantee in Europe as the United\r\nStates is willing to go, and _hardly any difficulty in the world could\r\nnot be solved by the faithful cooperation of the English speaking\r\npeoples_.” This was his view of the possibilities of Anglo-American\r\ncooperation before the war; his faith in it now is stronger than ever.\r\nAs for his opinion of the American people, one can deduce a good deal\r\nfrom some of the adjectives he has used about us in the past. He has\r\ncalled us “active, educated, excitable and harassed”; and “the most\r\nnumerous and ebullient of civilized communities.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What does Churchill think of Roosevelt and the New Deal?_\r\n\r\nA. I am sure he has a profound admiration for Mr. Roosevelt quite\r\naside from the help he wants from him. Churchill and Roosevelt are\r\nboth aristocrats, both expert politicians, both highly cultured men,\r\nboth believers in humanity, and in the destiny of the English-speaking\r\npeoples. There are only two factors to make them differ. The first is\r\nthat they are rivals, friendly rivals, of course, and allied rivals for\r\nthe duration of the war, but rivals just the same, and when the time\r\ncomes to translate victory into peace terms it is going to be exciting\r\nto see which of these powerful, determined men will do the leading. It\r\nwill be a struggle of titans. As one reviews the chief characteristics\r\nof each man it seems as though each possesses to the ultimate possible\r\ndegree the qualities of courage, intelligence, imagination, and\r\nstubbornness.\r\n\r\nChurchill has called Roosevelt “this great man, this thrice chosen\r\nhead of a nation of 130,000,000.” Another time in 1934 he described\r\nRoosevelt’s administration as a dictatorship, writing: “Although the\r\nDictatorship is veiled by constitutional forms it is none the less\r\neffective.” Hastily he added: “To compare Roosevelt’s effort with that\r\nof Hitler is not to insult Roosevelt but civilization.” Now both men\r\nhave become dictators in the classical sense of the word as it has\r\nbeen so sapiently defined by Frederick L. Schuman. “‘Dictatorship’ is\r\na form of power which is resorted to voluntarily and temporarily by\r\ndemocracies to meet dangers of invasion or revolution. It is a device\r\nto save democracy, not to destroy it.... The disposition of democrats\r\nto regard dictatorship in times of crisis as fatal to democracy rather\r\nthan as fundamental to its preservation reflects a tragic confusion\r\nresting upon ignorance of history and misuse of labels.” Schuman points\r\nout that Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini are tyrants or despots, but not,\r\nif one uses the word properly, “dictators.”\r\n\r\nThe reassuring fact is that both Roosevelt and Churchill believe that\r\na Pax Anglo-Americana is the key to the future. Churchill believes\r\nthat the British ought to take the leading role in such an arrangement\r\nbecause they have borne the heat of battle to a greater degree than\r\nwe shall have done even with our troops in Europe. Roosevelt believes\r\nAmerica ought to be the leader since we are coming out of the war\r\nconsiderably stronger than Great Britain and the younger nation is now\r\nready to take over guidance of world affairs from the parent country.\r\nOut of this fundamental difference could come a massive dispute, but\r\nsince it will have been based on victory we can hope fervently that the\r\nopportunity for the discussion be provided as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nChurchill has a second difference with Roosevelt in the field of\r\neconomic theory and practice. He is distinctly against the New Deal.\r\nThere was a time during the period of the Blue Eagle when Churchill\r\nseemed almost to fear that communism was coming to the United States.\r\nHe warned: “It is irrational to tear down or cripple the capitalist\r\nsystem without having the fortitude of spirit and ruthlessness of\r\naction to create a new communist system.” With Churchillian directness\r\nhe proclaims his belief in profits. “There can never be good wages or\r\ngood employment for any length of time without good profits.”\r\n\r\nWith equal candor and with much wit he defends rich men. “A second\r\ndanger to President Roosevelt’s valiant and heroic experiments seems\r\nto arise from the disposition to hunt down rich men as if they were\r\nnoxious beasts.... It is a very attractive sport, and once it gets\r\nstarted quite a lot of people everywhere are found ready to join in the\r\nchase.... The question arises whether the general well-being of the\r\nmasses of the community will be advanced by an excessive indulgence\r\nin this amusement. The millionaire or multi-millionaire is a highly\r\neconomic animal. He sucks up with sponge-like efficiency money from all\r\nquarters. In this process, far from depriving ordinary people of their\r\nearnings, he launches enterprise and carries it through, raises values,\r\nand he expands that credit without which on a vast scale no fuller\r\neconomic life can be opened to the millions. To hunt wealth is not to\r\ncapture commonwealth.” All this, his own economic philosophy, he sums\r\nup in the formula: “Whether it is better to have equality at the price\r\nof poverty or well-being at the price of inequality.”\r\n\r\nDoes this indicate a narrowly selfish interest by Churchill in his\r\nown class? Not at all. He believes profoundly in the possibility of\r\nextending leisure and well-being to all mankind through the benefits\r\nof science. He takes the evidence of Soviet Russia that the means to\r\ngeneral affluence is not communism, nor does he think it can come\r\nthrough any form of nationalization of production. He believes the\r\nessence of the problem is monetary. He believes the rights of man are\r\nmore important than the success of any economic system. He believes in\r\nthe British Empire as a mighty instrument of civilization. He believes\r\nprofoundly in cooperation with us. There is no reason why the two\r\nmightiest democratic dictators, Roosevelt and Churchill, should not\r\nemerge from the Peace Conference with a harmonious plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is it true that Churchill is gifted with a peculiar power to\r\nforesee the event?_\r\n\r\nA. I know of no statement which summed up in so few words a complete\r\nforecast of history as was contained in one sentence of Churchill’s\r\ndelivered April 6, 1936 in a speech on the fortification of the\r\nRhineland. You will remember that Hitler reoccupied the Rhineland March\r\n6, 1936. Mr. Churchill had this to say: “The creation of a line of\r\nforts opposite to the French frontier will enable the German troops to\r\nbe economized on that line and will enable the main forces to swing\r\nround through Belgium and Holland.” There in thirty-six words you have\r\nthe entire story of the Battle of France, told four years before it\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Tell us what you know of Mr. Churchill as a person. What are his\r\nprincipal characteristics?_\r\n\r\nA. Courage is his principal characteristic. I hesitated a moment but\r\ndecided to put his courage ahead of his intelligence, because courage\r\nis a more important quality than intelligence. I remember I once had\r\na spirited argument on this point with Henri Bernstein, the French\r\nplaywright. We were at the country home of Louis Bromfield in Senlis,\r\nthe point outside Paris where the Germans during the last war came\r\nnearest to the capital. Bernstein insisted intelligence was the most\r\nvaluable quality a man could have, and with enough of it he would not\r\nneed more than a minimum of courage. I argued that without courage\r\nthe keenest intelligence is useless in a world of action. A couple\r\nof years later Bernstein and I were on the same refugee ship, the\r\n_Madura_ of the British India Line, fleeing from Bordeaux to England\r\nafter the fall of France. I reminded Bernstein of our argument and\r\ninsisted that the disaster of France proved my contention was right.\r\nSurely the French were still what they have often been called, the most\r\nintelligent people on the continent, but for some reason which nobody\r\nhas yet completely fathomed, they had at this moment of their national\r\nhistory lost the desire or the willingness to fight. I suppose it would\r\nbe fair to define that as lack of courage, although I would be the last\r\nto assert that this is a permanent state of mind or of heart on the\r\npart of the French.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the French was the signal for Churchill to display the\r\nfinest quality of his character. Senator Gerald P. Nye once, with the\r\ngood taste characteristic of our isolationists, said: “Britain is a\r\ndead horse. America should not team up with a lost cause.” To France in\r\nher death agony Churchill made the offer that she merge with Britain\r\nand establish a single Franco-British government and cabinet, unite\r\nthe resources of the French and British Empires, and fight on to the\r\nlast drop of British blood, even if all France were occupied. It took\r\na Churchill’s imagination, generosity, and audacity to make such an\r\noffer. The French did not have enough strength left to reach out and\r\naccept the hand of rescue. We have heard a great deal about fighting to\r\nthe last drop of blood, but Churchill is the only man I have ever seen\r\namong the belligerents who makes it absolutely convincing.\r\n\r\nI was in London during those peak months of the Battle of Britain,\r\nAugust and September 1940 when the Germans were bombing by day as\r\nwell as by night, trying to conquer the R.A.F. to make invasion\r\npossible. One day I was driving through London with Mr. Churchill, and\r\nas we passed a particularly large and well-camouflaged machine-gun\r\nemplacement at a street intersection, the Prime Minister called my\r\nattention to it. “Do you see that?” “Yes,” I said, “it seems you really\r\nmeant it when you said the British would fight in the streets.” “Meant\r\nit!” exclaimed Mr. Churchill. “Why the Germans could if they liked\r\ndrop a hundred thousand parachutists on London, and if they did we\r\nwould chew them up and spit them out.” There was in his voice a note\r\nof delight at the prospect. This note is present in all of Churchill’s\r\nreferences to getting at the enemy. Although no man would act more\r\nquickly to relieve his people of the necessity of shedding their blood,\r\nwhile the fight is on Churchill revels in it. The responsibilities\r\nwhich are his now must be greater than those carried by any other human\r\nbeing on earth. One would think such a weight would have a crushing\r\neffect upon him. Not at all. The last time I saw him, while the Battle\r\nof Britain was still raging, he looked twenty years younger than before\r\nthe war began. As we walked across the garden in the rear of Number Ten\r\nDowning Street I had to quicken my pace and almost trot to keep up with\r\nhim, so swiftly did he stride along the gravel path.\r\n\r\nHis uplifted spirit is transmitted to the people and it is my\r\nimpression that the British are, just as Churchill said, “proud to\r\nbe under the fire of the enemy.” You may think it overdrawn but if\r\nyou had shared with them the experience of heavy air bombardment, you\r\nwould agree that Churchill was only expressing the exact truth when he\r\nsaid: “The sublime but also terrible experience and emotions of the\r\nbattlefield which for centuries have been reserved for soldiers and\r\nsailors now are shared for good or ill by the entire population.” Even\r\nin the midst of the most fearful danger Churchill taunts the enemy--“We\r\nare waiting for that long promised invasion. So are the fishes.” I\r\nwould not be surprised if Churchill really wanted the Germans to try,\r\nfor if they were to try and fail it would be a defeat so disastrous\r\nthat it might well lead to a German collapse.\r\n\r\nWithout courage nothing can be accomplished. With it plus intelligence\r\neverything can be done. Churchill’s courage is of every variety. He has\r\nthe simple battle courage of the Hussar. Remember the cavalry charge at\r\nOmdurman in the Sudan when the young Lieutenant Churchill fought his\r\nway through a tangle of howling dervishes? He has the enduring physical\r\ncourage to play a championship game of polo with a dislocated shoulder.\r\nHe has the moral courage to lead a lost cause. It was he who defended\r\nthe Duke of Windsor at the abdication, when the once most popular man\r\nin the British Empire had lost every other friend. He has the courage\r\nto take responsibility, and since he has been Prime Minister he has\r\npersonally taken the criticism for every ill turn of fortune, every\r\nplan gone wrong. He can meet a hostile mob and talk it down. He can\r\nlead in battle. He can lead in war. Above all he can infuse his courage\r\ninto others.\r\n\r\nOne’s pulse quickens at that immortal peroration of his delivered on\r\nJune 18, 1940, when France had surrendered, the British Expeditionary\r\nForce had escaped with the loss of all its tools, and England stood\r\nweaponless before the foe, in greater mortal peril than ever in ten\r\ncenturies. The words Churchill spoke then were the equivalent of a\r\nstrong army to defend the British Isles. Translated into the deeds of\r\nthe R.A.F., they defeated the enemy. Churchill said: “What General\r\nWeygand called the Battle of France is over. The Battle of Britain is\r\nabout to begin. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long\r\ncontinuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might\r\nof the enemy must very soon be turned upon us. Hitler knows that he\r\nwill have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand\r\nup to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move\r\nforward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole\r\nworld, including the United States and all that we have known and cared\r\nfor, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister and\r\nperhaps more prolonged by the lights of a perverted science. Let us\r\ntherefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that if\r\nthe British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men\r\nwill still say ‘This was their finest hour.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What was it Churchill said about carrying on even if the British\r\nIsles were conquered?_\r\n\r\nA. On August 20, 1940 in the midst of the Battle of Britain, Churchill\r\nsaid: “If we had been put in the terrible position of France, a\r\ncontingency now happily impossible, although, of course, it would have\r\nbeen the duty of all war leaders to fight on here to the end, it would\r\nalso have been their duty, as I indicated in my speech of June 4, to\r\nprovide as far as possible for the Naval security of Canada and our\r\nDominions and to make sure they had the means to carry on the struggle\r\nfrom beyond the oceans.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _That would be fine for us if we could depend upon it, but do you\r\nthink Churchill really meant it? What good would it do for the British\r\nNavy to carry on if the British Isles were conquered?_\r\n\r\nA. I am sure that Churchill himself would do exactly as he said he\r\nwould. He would perish with his troops or with his Navy--who can tell\r\nhow or where--but he would never surrender. Can you doubt it when you\r\nhear those words of his which are as much an inspiration for us today\r\nas they were for the British when he uttered them on the last day of\r\nthe evacuation of Dunkirk? They deserve to be memorized by us all.\r\n“Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous states have\r\nfallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious\r\napparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to\r\nthe end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas, and\r\noceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength\r\nin the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we\r\nshall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we\r\nshall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the\r\nhills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a\r\nmoment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and\r\nstarving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the\r\nBritish Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time,\r\nthe new world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue\r\nand the liberation of the old.”\r\n\r\nWith Churchill’s picture these words are placarded in homes and\r\noffices throughout the British Empire. Their spirit is the spirit of\r\nBritain. But having said this I am compelled to add that it would be\r\nfeeble-minded for us to expect that the British Navy would continue\r\nresistance to the Germans after the British Isles had been conquered.\r\n\r\nLet us examine what the position would be if the British Isles fell.\r\nFirst let us ask a British Naval Officer what would happen to the Royal\r\nNavy if the British Isles were conquered. He will tell you: “There\r\nwouldn’t be any Navy left.” I can see readily how this would be true.\r\nIf the Germans try invasion, the Royal Navy is going to throw itself\r\nbetween the home island and the invaders with a desperation such as\r\nhas never been equaled in British Naval history, and that is saying a\r\nvery great deal. The Germans cannot capture the British Isles by air\r\npower alone. They can land men and machine guns by air as they did at\r\nCrete, but the heavy weapons they need to beat off and batter down\r\nthe formidable British artillery and heavy tanks now massed at home,\r\nthey will have to land by sea. Without these weapons they cannot win.\r\nThe Royal Navy will prevent their landing or perish in the attempt.\r\nThe Germans will try to clear the way for their invading craft by\r\ntorpedoes, mines, speedboats, Stukas, burning oil on the water, and\r\nevery conceivable means, and by some perhaps not now conceivable to us.\r\nThe British defenders will discard caution and risk everything. They\r\nwill hurl themselves at the invader. If they lose there will surely be\r\nlittle left of the Navy.\r\n\r\nBut suppose there were left a British naval force large enough when\r\ntaken in combination with what we could spare from the Pacific to\r\ncontinue to maintain practical control of the Atlantic, enough anyway\r\nto prevent any German attempt at sending an invading army to America.\r\nCould we then expect this remnant of the British Navy to retire to\r\nCanada or the United States, and continue resistance to the Germans? I\r\ndo not think so.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, what would be the purpose of the British Navy in\r\ncontinuing resistance to the Germans after the British Isles had been\r\ncaptured? Would it be for the purpose of eventually reconquering the\r\nBritish Isles? No, because that would be impossible. This is one of\r\nthose grim facts which are too ugly for most people to look at, but\r\nthere is no use turning our eyes away and refusing to see that if the\r\nGermans do invade and conquer the British Isles, the British people\r\nwill have finished their life. It would be the end for them, not for\r\nthe duration of this war, which would in fact be ended then, but for as\r\nfar into the future as the imagination can travel. The Germans might\r\nremain in possession of the British Isles or in effective control for\r\nthe thousand years Hitler so often boasts about, or until they became\r\nweak through centuries of good living. Hitler would disarm the people\r\nof Britain and allow hunger to decimate them. He could count on forty\r\nper cent of the population dying of starvation in a year or so. Does\r\nthis seem an exaggeration? It is only one more of those facts about\r\nHitler which nobody would believe. The trusting Dutch would not believe\r\nwhat Hitler was like until he taught the people of Rotterdam. But the\r\nBritish people have now learned their lesson. They have totally lost\r\nthe wide-eyed faith of our Lindberghs, that Hitler is “human after\r\nall.” The British know Hitler would do just what I have said, he would\r\ndeliberately destroy a great part of the population, allowing to remain\r\nalive only those sufficiently broken to become good slaves. But why,\r\nyou ask, could not the British Navy reconquer the British Isles, if\r\nthey had our wholehearted help? The answer is that there would be no\r\nbase from which to operate.\r\n\r\nWe can now contemplate reconquering Europe from the Nazis because we\r\nhave a base or several possible bases from which to operate against\r\nthe Reich. We have the British Isles and Russia and the Middle East,\r\nand parts of North Africa, and may have other bases before the war is\r\nover. But if the British Isles were captured, where could the British\r\nNavy land to invade and repossess them? And with what troops would this\r\nengagement be fought? With the Canadians and Australians? Nobody would\r\ndare disparage the fighting qualities of these magnificent men, but if\r\nthe 46,000,000 Britishers in the British Isles had failed to throw back\r\nthe German Army is it likely that 16,000,000 Canadians and Australians\r\ncould defeat it? What about the United States? If we had not entered\r\nthe war before the conquest of the British Isles, is it likely we would\r\ngo to war after the British had been beaten? Moreover, if we did, it\r\nis inconceivable that we should beat the Germans after they had seized\r\nthe resources of the United Kingdom. They would then have added to the\r\nshipbuilding capacity of the continent all the British shipyards, at\r\nthis moment the most productive in the world. It might be worth our\r\nwhile to glance an instant at the shipbuilding situation which would\r\nexist if Germany takes the British Isles.\r\n\r\nThe shipbuilding capacity of each of the following countries is listed\r\nas of the most productive year since 1917. This was usually 1919.\r\n\r\n                    _Tons_\r\n  Germany           600,000\r\n  Denmark           140,000\r\n  France            210,000\r\n  Holland           240,000\r\n  Norway             60,000\r\n  Sweden            165,000\r\n  Italy             220,000\r\n  Japan             700,000\r\n                  ---------\r\n                  2,335,000\r\n  United Kingdom  2,000,000\r\n                  ---------\r\n  Total           4,335,000\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of Britain, Germany and her allies would possess the\r\ncapacity to build 4,335,000 tons of ships a year, which is more than\r\nfour times our 1941 production of around 1,000,000 tons and is even\r\nlarger than our record performance in 1919 when we turned out 4,075,000\r\ntons of ships. Admiral Land’s prediction that we would eventually\r\nbuild 6,000,000 tons a year remains to be fulfilled. As matters now\r\nstand if the Germans were to capture Britain, time would be on their\r\nside for the building of ships. Furthermore, of course, the Germans\r\nwould inherit the vast British industrial machine, and save for the\r\nproduction of steel, would have the power to turn out more airplanes\r\nand munitions than we could for many years. All of this is merely to\r\nemphasize what the fall of Britain and the end of the British Navy as a\r\nfighting force against Hitler would mean to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But isn’t Churchill often wrong in his military judgment? Hasn’t he\r\nmade mistakes due to overconfidence?_\r\n\r\nA. It is true that Mr. Churchill has the vices of his virtues, and\r\nsince his most prominent virtue is courage, he also possesses what has\r\nseemed at times to be recklessness. His sanguine temperament makes him\r\nideally equipped to lead a nation in desperate circumstances, but his\r\ncritics of whom a few still exist will never cease insisting on the\r\nobvious, that he makes mistakes, as though it were not the hoariest of\r\nadages that only the man who never does anything commits no errors.\r\nThey list a roll of his alleged military failures, beginning with his\r\nunsuccessful defense of Antwerp and the costly attempt to take the\r\nDardanelles in the last war; and in this war Norway, Greece, and Crete.\r\nBut if these events are analyzed it will be seen that each of them had\r\nits justification.\r\n\r\nMany military critics looking back at the last war now agree that Mr.\r\nChurchill was right to advocate holding Antwerp as an Allied strong\r\npoint behind the German lines, and if the Allied High Command had\r\nsupported him sufficiently Churchill’s defense might have succeeded.\r\nThe Dardanelles attempt--which used to be the failure his enemies\r\nmost enjoyed--was in the view of most military men today a brilliant\r\nconception which would have ended the war victoriously for the Allies\r\ntwo years earlier, if Churchill’s plan had been carried out as it could\r\nhave been. We know now not only that the campaign could have succeeded\r\nfrom the outset and at comparatively little cost, if the Churchill\r\ntimetable had been scrupulously kept, but also that the straits could\r\nhave been captured even at the very end if one last push had been\r\nmade. One of Raymond Swing’s best stories is of his experience as a\r\nwar correspondent with the Turks, whom he saw hoarding their last few\r\nrounds of ammunition as, to their astonishment, the British steamed\r\naway, losing with a completely un-British lack of persistence. It was\r\njealousy more than anything else that spoiled the Dardanelles campaign,\r\nKitchener’s jealousy of Churchill.\r\n\r\nIn his old age, Kitchener, the Army chief, obstinately refused to do\r\nwhat the Navy chief advised, and the end was failure. It was perhaps\r\nthe most keenly felt failure in the life of Churchill when he resigned\r\nafter the Dardanelles. Anyone who reads the painstaking account he\r\nhas written of the campaign in his history of the war, _The World\r\nCrisis_, may perceive how heavy the blow was. Even clearer evidence are\r\nthe pictures of him in his country place at Chartwell. One for which\r\nhe sat immediately after the Dardanelles campaign shows him looking\r\nyears older than a picture of him before the campaign began. No, the\r\nDardanelles ought to be remembered to Churchill’s credit, and it will\r\nbe eventually.\r\n\r\nIn this war its place has been given by his critics to Norway,\r\nCrete, and Greece. Ed Angly, my companion in flight from France,\r\nused humorously to wonder if the British were ever going to cease\r\nretreating and my reply was that they probably never would until they\r\nhad retreated to victory. The Norwegian campaign discouraged many, and\r\ncritics on both sides of the Atlantic demanded to know why the British\r\nsecret service had not known in advance of the German intention to\r\ninvade Norway; why the Royal Navy had not prevented invasion; why the\r\nBritish Army landed in the north could not hold on.\r\n\r\nThe reproach of faulty information can be leveled only by persons not\r\nacquainted with the nature of the Gestapo. It must not have escaped\r\ngeneral attention that when the German Army marches into a captured\r\nterritory, for a few days news of a sort continues to trickle out, and\r\nwe may hope that British or other enemy agents continue to function\r\nduring this time. But as soon as the Gestapo appears, with Himmler\r\ndirecting its hordes of agents in civilian clothes, and its tens of\r\nthousands of black-uniformed SS, it is as though an asbestos curtain\r\nhad fallen on the frontiers of the country, and from then on the\r\nsilence of the grave envelops the land. I was not surprised that\r\nHitler could strike with such devastating secrecy; what victim of his\r\nhas been warned except by the general reputation of the invader? Even\r\nthe Bolsheviks were plaintively surprised when the “assassin of the\r\nworking classes” so violently dissolved his friendship with the “scum\r\nof the earth.” We may be sure that if Hitler were ever put, by the fall\r\nof Britain, in a position to attack the Western Hemisphere, we would\r\nalso be surprised, not by the action but by the time and method. The\r\nNorwegian surprise was no fault of Churchill.\r\n\r\nThe question why the British could not hold on is one that is put not\r\nonly about Norway but about Crete and Greece and it may be put again\r\nbefore the last battle is fought. The answer is one which may have to\r\nbe borne in mind for a long time. It is contained in the simplest facts\r\nabout the war, which tend to be forgotten in the riot of daily news.\r\nThe principal fact is that Britain after two years of war has not yet\r\ncaught up with the numbers and equipment of the German war machine\r\nbuilt by a population double that of the British over seven years of\r\npeacetime preparation and two of war. The British have fought on nearly\r\nevery one of their battlefields so far with inferior numbers against\r\nsuperior material and better-trained men. Let those of us in America\r\nwho imagine we have only to call a few million boys to the colors\r\nand train them a year in order to have an army, consider the British\r\nexperience. The British soldiers are only now after more than two years\r\nof war training, becoming a capable modern army, about one-third the\r\nsize of Britain’s “medium-sized” army.\r\n\r\nFinally we heard the criticism that Churchill’s decision to send troops\r\nto Greece was a mistake, since he knew they could not hold out against\r\nthe Germans. “Political” reasons, it was said, ought not to govern\r\nmilitary decisions. But what is the war being fought about if not to\r\nre-establish honor among nations? Britain was sworn to come to the\r\naid of Greece. Had she failed to do so, forlorn though the hope was\r\nof immediate success, she would have lost a good part of that moral\r\nreputation which is worth more than many army corps to her today. This\r\n“political” decision was made in the sense of the classical definition\r\nof politics, “that branch of ethics dealing with the ethical relations\r\nand duties of states.”\r\n\r\nChurchill did make one public mistake, and it was shared by hopeful\r\nmillions, when he said at the beginning of the Norwegian campaign,\r\n“Herr Hitler has committed a grave strategic error in spreading the war\r\nso far to the north.” The man who had almost never underestimated the\r\nGermans did so that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Wasn’t that apparent error in judgment perhaps really a piece of\r\ngood-cheer propaganda for the people?_\r\n\r\nA. I do not think so; it was a real mistake based on his own audacity,\r\nyet who would not prefer a leadership which tries and fails to one\r\nwhich does not try at all? In Churchill the British have one leader\r\nwho understands that wars are never won on the defensive, and we may\r\nbe sure that he can be depended upon to seize the first conceivable\r\nopportunity to carry the war into Hitler’s territory. The offensive\r\nspirit never had a more consistent exponent than Churchill, as in his\r\nproclamation:\r\n\r\n“We are resolved to destroy Hitler and every vestige of his Nazi\r\nregime; from this nothing will turn us--nothing. We will never parley,\r\nwe will never negotiate with Hitler or any of his men. We shall fight\r\nhim by land, we shall fight him by sea, we shall fight him in the\r\nair, until, with God’s help, we have rid the earth of his shadow and\r\nliberated his peoples from the yoke.”\r\n\r\nThis eloquence of Churchill is a gift from Heaven for our side during\r\nthese terrible years, when confusion of mind is the greatest foe of\r\nthe democracies. One of the most famous sayings of Hitler, quoted\r\nby Rauschning is: “Mental confusion, contradiction of feeling,\r\nindecisiveness, panic; these are our weapons.”\r\n\r\nWe in America can see how effective these weapons are. Consider the\r\nmental confusion, indecisiveness, and conflicting feelings aroused in\r\nthe United States by the speeches of Hitler’s American Quislings, the\r\nLindberghs and Wheelers. The counterpart of these circles existed in\r\nEngland but they were long ago rendered powerless and even speechless\r\nby the analytical eloquence of Churchill. Take the case of Hitler’s\r\ninvasion of Russia. Hitler undoubtedly expected to divide the outside\r\nworld by proclaiming his “Holy Crusade” against Bolshevism. But\r\nChurchill choked this deceit in its inception. The Germans began their\r\nattack on Russia at four o’clock in the morning, and before the day was\r\nout Churchill had given the world his answer. Other statesmen might\r\nhave waited a day or even a week. Churchill gave Hitler no time to\r\nspread mental confusion. “Any man or state,” Churchill declared, “who\r\nfights against Nazidom will have our aid. Any man or state who marches\r\nwith Hitler is our foe.... Hitler’s invasion of Russia is no more than\r\na prelude to an attempted invasion of the British Isles.... The Russian\r\ndanger is therefore our danger and the danger of the United States....\r\nLet us redouble our exertions and strike with united strength while\r\nlife and power remain.” This declaration, swift and uncompromising as\r\na bullet, was equivalent to the loss of a great battle for Hitler. I\r\nam sure he entertained hopes that he could induce Britain even to stop\r\nfighting in order that he could more easily destroy Bolshevik Russia.\r\nChurchill’s speed prevented the question from even being debated. This\r\nis the finest example of leadership. The Prime Minister did not wait to\r\nfind out by Gallup poll or otherwise what the British people thought.\r\nHe boldly led them.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you think the flight of Hess to England had any connection with\r\nthe German attack on Russia which followed six weeks later?_\r\n\r\nA. Hess fled to England May 10, and Hitler attacked Russia June 21. I\r\nthink there must have been a connection, and I have my theory of it,\r\nbut it is only a theory. I think Hess may have carried Churchill a\r\nmessage from Hitler saying he was going to attack Russia, offering a\r\nnegotiated peace, and soliciting the benevolent neutrality if not the\r\nactive aid of Britain to destroy the Bolshevik menace. We may be sure\r\nthat whatever was the purpose of Hess’s visit, Churchill knows all\r\nabout it by now.\r\n\r\nThere are two passages in Churchill’s speech after the invasion of\r\nRussia which might bear on Hess. In one place he says, “All this was\r\nno surprise to me. I gave clear and precise warnings to Stalin of\r\nwhat was coming.” And then, as though he realized that this statement\r\nmight indicate that he had specific foreknowledge of the German plans\r\nagainst Russia, Churchill adds, “I gave him warnings as I have given\r\nwarnings to others before. I can only hope that these warnings did not\r\nfall unheeded.” Then at another point Churchill emphasized: “We will\r\nnever parley, we will never negotiate with Hitler or any of his men.”\r\nThat might refer to Hess’s effort to negotiate. We know that if Hess\r\nhad carried such a proposal to Churchill it would have been rejected,\r\nand if Churchill warned Stalin it is very likely Stalin profited by\r\nthe warning. It has been argued, however, that the British could have\r\nallowed Hess to believe, and to transmit to Hitler his belief, that the\r\nproposal would be accepted. This would have served to encourage Hitler\r\nto go ahead with his plans and attack Russia. We can be certain that in\r\nthe meeting between Hess and Churchill, the Prime Minister did not come\r\noff second best.\r\n\r\nI knew Hess personally--not very well, but well enough to have formed\r\nan estimate of his character. On the basis of his character I would\r\nsay we could exclude a great many alleged explanations of his flight.\r\nHe was brave and led a life of hazardous adventure. He was not likely\r\nto flee for cowardly reasons. He was first in the personal esteem\r\nof Hitler and Hitler was the only person who could have threatened\r\nhis life. Himmler could not do so, nor Goering. He was a quiet,\r\nunambitious fellow and had few enemies. I do not believe fear had\r\nanything to do with the flight. He was devoted to Hitler and it is\r\nalmost inconceivable that he should have done anything contrary to the\r\nFuehrer’s wishes. He was never a policy maker, meddled not at all in\r\nthe high politics of the party or state, but merely delivered speeches\r\non order, and acted as a sort of super-private secretary and valet\r\nto his master. It is not likely that he went to England to advance a\r\npolicy of his own, as was widely believed before the German attack\r\non Russia. Many signs point to the probability that Hess was acting\r\nas Hitler’s emissary to try to dupe Churchill into withdrawing from\r\nthe war and sanctioning the attack on Russia. The objections are, of\r\ncourse, that it is hard to believe that Hitler could have been such a\r\nfool as to think such an attempt feasible, or that he would risk losing\r\nhis valued confederate on a mission with such little likelihood of\r\nsuccess, or that he would have risked the revelation of his plans to\r\nthe Russians. Yet if Hess had fled because he was afraid, or because he\r\nthought Germany was losing, or because he had split with Hitler, or for\r\nany other reason discreditable to the Nazi cause, surely the British by\r\nnow would have given the facts to the public. It would have made the\r\nbest propaganda in the world. I heard Jan Valtin, author of _Out of the\r\nNight_, advance the suggestion that Hess, who was always a sensitive\r\nfellow, with a touch of sissy in his carriage, and who was attached to\r\nthe Fuehrer with an almost morbid devotion, might have succumbed to a\r\nfit of pique; he might have been slighted by Hitler before one of his\r\nrivals, as Goering or Himmler or Goebbels or Rosenberg, and might have\r\nleaped into his plane and left the country to “make Hitler sorry.” This\r\nis an engaging theory. I will stick to mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is the secret of Churchill’s success?_\r\n\r\nA. His appetite for creation. He is as eager to create as Hitler is\r\nto destroy life. He cannot live without creating. Hitler cannot live\r\nwithout destroying. Churchill’s courage, wit, and eloquence are matched\r\nby his industry. He does an incredible amount of work. Before he came\r\nback into the government he never let a day go by without writing at\r\nleast 2,000 or 3,000 words. His powers of concentration are phenomenal.\r\nHis memory is prodigious. He dictates everything he writes. I have\r\nvisited him in his workroom on the top floor of his country home at\r\nChartwell in Kent. A shelf about breast-high runs the length of the\r\nroom, and on it he has arranged his books of reference, notes, and\r\ndocuments. I was there when he was finishing his monumental life of his\r\nancestor, the Duke of Marlborough. There were twenty or thirty volumes\r\nlying open on the shelf, with paper slips marking other passages to\r\nbe consulted. His practice is to walk up and down the room, glancing\r\nhere and there at his various works of reference, dictating all the\r\ntime to a secretary. As in the composition of his speeches, he has a\r\nfirst draft typed with plenty of space for corrections and interlining.\r\nThis is returned for recopying and sometimes half a dozen drafts are\r\nnecessary before the final form is completed. The result of this\r\nstriving after perfection is something as near approaching perfection\r\nas one can find in the works of any writer of, what I might call,\r\ninspired history. I remember once a conversation about Churchill’s\r\nwriting ability with Alexander Woollcott. I thought I had been as\r\nappreciative as one could be, but Aleck broke in: “No, Knick, you\r\nhaven’t said enough. Churchill is the greatest master of the English\r\nlanguage since the men who wrote the King James version of the Bible.”\r\nThere is a nobility and grandeur about Churchill’s oratory which no\r\nliterature I know outside the Bible can approach. On July 14, 1940 when\r\nHitler’s army had swept all before it save the British Isles, Churchill\r\nsaid: “And now it has come to us to stand alone in the breach, and\r\nface the worst that the tyrant’s might and enmity can do. Bearing\r\nourselves humbly before God, but conscious that we serve an unfolding\r\npurpose, we are ready to defend our native land against the invasion\r\nby which it is threatened. We are fighting _by_ ourselves alone; but\r\nwe are not fighting _for_ ourselves alone. Here in this strong City of\r\nRefuge which enshrines the title deeds of human progress and is of deep\r\nconsequence to Christian civilization; here, girt about by the seas\r\nand oceans where the Navy reigns; shielded from above by the prowess\r\nand devotion of our airmen--we await undismayed the impending assault.\r\nPerhaps it will come tonight. Perhaps it will come next week. Perhaps\r\nit will never come. We must show ourselves equally capable of meeting\r\nsudden violent shock, or what is perhaps a harder test, a prolonged\r\nvigil. But be the ordeal sharp or long, or both, we shall seek no\r\nterms, we shall tolerate no parley; we may show mercy--we shall ask for\r\nnone.”\r\n\r\nCan this language be matched except by the adjurations of the prophets\r\nof old? And what could surpass the fiery blast of his invective turned\r\nupon Hitler? “This wicked man,” he said, “the repository and embodiment\r\nof many forms of soul-destroying hatred, this monstrous product of\r\nformer wrongs and shame, has now resolved to try to break our famous\r\nisland race by a process of indiscriminate slaughter and destruction.\r\nWhat he has done is to kindle a fire in British hearts, here and\r\nall over the world, which will glow long after all traces of the\r\nconflagration he has caused in London have been removed. He has lighted\r\na fire which will burn with a steady and consuming flame until the last\r\nvestiges of Nazi tyranny have been burnt out of Europe and until the\r\nOld World--and the New--can join hands to rebuild the temples of man’s\r\nfreedom and man’s honor, upon foundations which will not soon or easily\r\nbe overthrown.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to catalogue the various words Churchill has used to\r\ndescribe Hitler, and to note that he prefers the simplest descriptives,\r\n“wicked,” “evil,” and “bad.” What other speaker could use the childish\r\nadjective “bad” and make it so effective as did Churchill on April 27,\r\n1941 when he said: “In February, as you may remember, _that bad man_ in\r\none of his raving outbursts threatened us with a terrifying increase\r\nin numbers and activities of his U-boats....” And again on February\r\n9: “We must all of us have been asking ourselves what is _that wicked\r\nman_ whose crime-stained regime and system are at bay and in the toils,\r\nwhat has he been preparing during these winter months?” And earlier on\r\nOctober 1, 1939: “How soon victory will be gained depends upon how long\r\nHerr Hitler and his group of _wicked men_, whose hands are stained with\r\nblood and soiled with corruption, can keep their grip upon the docile,\r\nunhappy German people.” Once he calls him a “cornered maniac,” and in\r\nthe same speech of November 12, 1939 says: “I have the sensation and\r\nalso the conviction that _that evil man_ over there and his cluster of\r\nconfederates are not sure of themselves as we are sure of ourselves;\r\nthat they are harassed in their guilty souls by the thought and by\r\nthe fear of an ever approaching retribution for their crimes, and for\r\nthe orgy of destruction into which they have plunged us all....” On\r\nMarch 30, 1940 he refers to “Hitler’s murderous rage,” and says, “In\r\nhis frenzy, this _wicked man_ and the criminal regime which he has\r\nconceived and erected, increasingly turn their malice upon the weak.”\r\n\r\nConstantly recurs the simile of bloodstained, foul hands, perhaps best\r\nin Churchill’s speech of June 12, 1941 when he said: “We can not yet\r\nsee how deliverance will come or when it will come, but nothing is more\r\ncertain than that every trace of Hitler’s footsteps, every stain of his\r\ninfected and corroding fingers will be sponged and purged and if need\r\nbe, blasted from the surface of the earth.”\r\n\r\nThe most famous of Churchill’s epigrams is the one now known by the\r\nentire English-speaking world, about the Royal Air Force, delivered\r\nin his speech of August 20, 1940 on “The War Situation” in the House\r\nof Commons. I heard that speech and particularly noted the epigram,\r\nbut I cannot now certify which of the two current versions he actually\r\ndelivered. As I remember, he said, “Never in the field of human\r\nconflict have so many owed so much to so few.” But in the collected\r\nvolume of his speeches edited by his son, Randolph, the sentence runs,\r\n“Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to\r\nso few.” I have seen both of these versions on placards in British\r\nstores and offices. Hansard must have the original version and it is\r\npossible Churchill or his son may have made an amendment in the volume\r\nof speeches.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What are Churchill’s principal interests?_\r\n\r\nA. I am going to make an omnibus answer to this and include replies to\r\na score of questions usually asked about Mr. Churchill. Roughly, in\r\norder of importance Mr. Churchill’s principal interests are England;\r\nthe war, the Royal Navy; his family, past, present, and future; power;\r\npolitics; the English language; public speaking; writing history and\r\nmaking it; writing journalism; reading history, biography, literature;\r\nthe English-speaking people; Scotch whisky; good food, good wines,\r\ncigars; the French people; all other people; conversation; favorable\r\npublicity; unfavorable publicity; ceremony; painting; bricklaying;\r\nswimming (in younger days polo); six-pack bezique; his hats; his shoes;\r\nhis clothes; and of course “that bloodthirsty guttersnipe.”\r\n\r\nCompare this with Hitler’s interests: power; Hitler-Germany; the war;\r\nthe German Army; barbarism; haranguing crowds in public; haranguing\r\nfriends in private; propaganda; rewriting history; reading military\r\nhistory (and making it); suppressing journalism; the Jews; colossal\r\narchitecture; the movies; vegetarian food; and of course “the warmonger\r\nChurchill.”\r\n\r\nBy this comparison I do not put the two men on the same level, for\r\nmorally they cannot be considered as belonging to the same species, but\r\nit is interesting to note the contrasts that come out in such a list.\r\nIt is not merely the contrast between the aristocrat who is striving\r\nto preserve free life for common men and the “guttersnipe” who is bent\r\nupon enslaving them all; it is a contrast of two worlds.\r\n\r\nChurchill has a profound historical sense and the thought of himself\r\nas a part of the broad stream of the British people, flowing from\r\nthe distant past into the limitless future, is never absent from his\r\nspeaking and writing. He is never just Churchill, he is Churchill of\r\nBritish history, of the Marlboroughs, but now more than ever Churchill\r\nof the British people, with whom he has established a community of\r\nfeeling seldom equaled in the relationship of leader to people. It has\r\nalways been Hitler’s boast that “I _am_ Germany!” An Italian journalist\r\nthinking to jibe at England during the tormented months of the Blitz\r\nsaid mockingly that the British Isles seemed to be inhabited by “forty\r\nmillion Churchills.” He was right, for under Churchill’s leadership\r\nthe entire population has become animated with his courage and he _is_\r\nEngland to the same degree and by the same psychological process as\r\nHitler _is_ Germany. Hitler obtained his ascendancy over the German\r\npeople by expressing their hitherto largely unconscious aspirations,\r\nfor revenge, aggression, expansion, and conquest. At the height of the\r\nBritish people’s peril they turned spontaneously and unanimously to\r\nChurchill whom Providence seemed to have reserved for this critical\r\nhour, and they entrusted to him the fulfillment of their aspirations\r\nto beat off the enemy, save their families, and win victory. I was\r\nthere and for four months watched the British people and in particular\r\nthe eight million Londoners endure the anxiety of expected invasion\r\nand the full blast of the greatest attack ever made on a civilian\r\npopulation in history and I know that their faith in Churchill was a\r\nmost important factor in their endurance. Every Londoner thought as\r\nthe bombs fell, “Churchill is there; he can’t be beaten; we can’t be\r\nbeaten.” Churchill “became” England. This is the experience that has\r\nelevated him above himself, fulfilled his character, made him great.\r\nToday Churchill’s every faculty of soul, mind, and body is devoted to\r\nthe service of the British Commonwealth. Today every soul and resource\r\nin the German Commonwealth is devoted to the service of Hitler.\r\n\r\nChurchill actively directs the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force but\r\nhis love is the Navy. One can tell from his speeches how frequently his\r\nmind dwells upon it. It remains his favorite branch of the services,\r\ndespite the noble tribute he has paid the R.A.F. He reserves for it\r\nwords such as he would use otherwise only to describe Old England\r\nherself. “Amphibious” is the term he likes best to define the power\r\nof Britain in arms. His conviction of the paramount importance of the\r\nFleet was thus dramatically expressed: “On them, as we conceived,\r\nfloated the might, majesty, dominion and power of the British Empire.\r\nAll our long history built up century after century, all our great\r\naffairs in every part of the globe, all the means of livelihood and\r\nsafety of our faithful, industrious, active population depended upon\r\nthem. Open the seacocks and let them sink beneath the surface and in a\r\nfew minutes, half an hour at the most--the whole outlook of the world\r\nwould be changed. The British Empire would dissolve like a dream; each\r\nisolated community struggling forward by itself; the central power of\r\nunion broken; mighty provinces, whole Empires in themselves, drifting\r\nhelplessly out of control, and falling a prey to strangers; and Europe\r\nafter one sudden convulsion passing into the iron grip and rule of\r\nthe Teuton and of all that the Teutonic system meant. There would\r\nonly be left far off across the Atlantic, unarmed, unready and as yet\r\nuninstructed America, to maintain single-handed law and freedom among\r\nmen.” That was written about the Royal Navy mobilized for war in August\r\n1914 but with what melancholy accuracy it reflects the situation of\r\ntoday, except that this time the Teutonic might is such that Europe\r\nhas already had its one sudden convulsion and has passed under the\r\nrule of a Teutonic system far grimmer than anything the Hohenzollerns\r\nwould have imposed. And once again, after a score of years of warning,\r\nAmerica still finds herself “unarmed, unready and as yet uninstructed,”\r\ndependent now for her very life upon the continued existence of that\r\nNavy which Churchill apostrophizes.\r\n\r\nNow of course the war takes all of Churchill’s time, but in normal\r\ncircumstances he has an enormous number of interests and activities.\r\nHe concentrates fiercely upon each in turn, and everything he does he\r\ndoes at least well, some things he does excellently, and some he does\r\nsuperlatively. Fighting, speaking, writing, eating, drinking, sleeping,\r\nsmoking, all are the source of intense satisfaction. He relishes every\r\nmoment in his life. This war was made for him, because fighting is\r\nlife itself to Churchill. In the last war he was a subordinate and\r\ncould not thoroughly enjoy the fight when others checked his combat\r\nplans. Now he is unchecked by anybody except the British people, and\r\nthey have shown they are only too glad to let him savor to the full\r\nwhat are to him the joys of responsibility in the greatest fight with\r\nthe greatest consequences in the memory of mankind. Before the war the\r\nmost exciting form of conflict was politics, about which Churchill once\r\nsaid, “Politics are almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous.”\r\nHe takes the keenest pleasure in writing, but he would always give up\r\nhis work on a book to go back into politics, as he did when this war\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nHe was just finishing his monumental _History of the English Speaking\r\nPeoples_ when he was called to the Admiralty. I understand the\r\n_History_ is to be in several volumes, but despite its size Churchill\r\nwrote the whole thing in a year, dictating thousands of words a day. He\r\nhad worked on it, gathering material for many years, and such is the\r\norganization of his mind and so precise and comprehensive is his memory\r\nthan when he once began he was able to dictate it almost as fast as he\r\ncould talk. I have heard that the publisher has already set the book up\r\nbut is waiting presumably for the end of the war to release it.\r\n\r\nToday his prewar books, as _My Early Days_, are reprinted and have\r\nbecome best sellers. Even his prewar newspaper articles are eagerly\r\ndragged out, and reprinted both here and in England to sell at high\r\nprices. His books have been phenomenally successful and his income\r\nfrom them, from journalism, and from lectures has been for most of his\r\nlife considerably higher than the $50,000 a year he receives as Prime\r\nMinister. It was always a financial sacrifice for him to go into office\r\ndespite the comparatively liberal salaries of British ministers. He has\r\nno interest in money. His earnings have been large ever since he was\r\na war correspondent in South Africa, but he has spent money as fast\r\nas it came, on his estate, his family, and on good living. One of his\r\nbest American friends, Bernard Baruch, once tried to instruct him in\r\nthe art of stock exchange speculation but nothing came of it. Churchill\r\nhad for it the interest he has for everything in life, and wanted to\r\nlearn it, but he lacked the indispensable requirement for amassing a\r\nfortune, namely an overwhelming desire to make money. The power given\r\nby the possession of money is so paltry compared with political power\r\nthat none of the great statesmen, or even the wicked dictators, have\r\nexhibited any interest in it. What use has Hitler for money? I doubt\r\nthat he has touched any for years.\r\n\r\nUntil this war began it was power that appealed to Churchill more than\r\nanything else in the world. It is ironical that now he possesses it\r\nto a greater degree than he could ever have dreamed of, power for its\r\nown sake he no longer wants. But that has not lessened his aesthetic\r\ncapacity to enjoy it. No stress of war, nor the imminence of awful\r\ndanger, can prevent him from enjoying the power of his spoken or\r\nwritten word. You can feel his artistic satisfaction as you hear him in\r\nthe House of Commons, delivering on a desperate day passages calculated\r\nnot only to encourage, guide, and inspire, but to excite admiration for\r\ntheir felicity.\r\n\r\nWe American correspondents in London used regularly to attend the\r\nHouse every time Churchill spoke, although none of us need have\r\ndone so, since the speeches were delivered into our offices almost\r\ninstantaneously by ticker. We wanted to hear him in person not only for\r\nthe stirring drama of it but because as journalists we wished to listen\r\nto the greatest living master of our craft. The trouble of attending\r\nParliament was considerable, for the old House, now in ruins, was too\r\nsmall to accommodate even the Members if they all attended, and the\r\nforeign press was allotted so few seats it was necessary to apply days\r\nin advance to get a place. The narrow seats with too little space for\r\nknees and feet were uncomfortable, the acoustics poor, but the view\r\nfrom our gallery was perfect.\r\n\r\nThere sits the government, the bald head of Mr. Churchill shining\r\namong the Members with unmistakable authority. The benches are nearly\r\nempty until the time draws near for the Prime Minister to speak; a\r\nfew minutes before he rises the House is jammed with Members sitting\r\neven on the foot of the Speaker’s dais. The Prime Minister rises.\r\nThere is dead silence as Mr. Churchill lays before him a sheaf of\r\nwhat are technically called notes, as it is prohibited in the House\r\nfor any member, even the Prime Minister, to read a speech. This rule\r\nis presumably to prevent a member from using a speech written by\r\nsomeone else. The familiar Washington ghost writers would have little\r\nemployment in Westminster. Mr. Churchill would have about as much\r\nuse for one as Shakespeare would have had. Mr. Churchill’s “notes”\r\nare in fact his completely written speech which he has memorized by\r\nrereading the final copy quickly on the way to the House. He has\r\nworked on this speech for several hours a day for eight days, writing,\r\nrewriting, until he finally has it typed on sheets half the size of\r\nstandard typewriter paper. Thereafter he never looks at it. He has it\r\nbefore him, and he automatically turns the pages, but his delivery\r\nis perfectly extemporaneous, and you would imagine as you sat there\r\nwatching and listening that those incomparable phrases were conceived\r\nat the moment, and to the satisfaction of hearing them is added the\r\nillusion of being present at their creation. Mr. Churchill himself\r\ninsists he cannot speak well impromptu and I have heard that his son\r\nRandolph, recently seated in Parliament, is considered a better offhand\r\nspeaker than his father.\r\n\r\nIt is an extraordinary coincidence that this greatest orator of modern\r\ntimes should have an impediment of speech similar, we may imagine, to\r\nthat of the greatest orator of ancient times, Demosthenes. Churchill\r\nhas almost overcome the impediment. His delivery is not what we would\r\nconsider the best. He depends not at all on gesture. Now and then\r\nhe pauses to glance over the top of his spectacles with defiance or\r\ncuriosity. His stance is determined, not graceful. For the most part\r\nhe stands quietly in the same spot, and only moves a step backward or\r\nforward when he wishes to emphasize a passage. His voice is sonorous,\r\nstrong, not the golden voice of a William Jennings Bryan, but also not\r\nthe vulgar guttural of Hitler. Yet when Churchill speaks of Hitler\r\nthere comes into his tone a note that promises to meet all the Nazi’s\r\nbrutality and pay interest. Churchill’s voice is ideally adapted to the\r\nradio and the millions of Americans who listen to him on the air have\r\nheard him at his best. Many have exclaimed at his accent that he does\r\nnot talk like an Englishman. His is the accent of Sandhurst, Britain’s\r\nWest Point, which is nearer the American way of speaking than the\r\ncurious upper-class cockney affected by some graduates of Oxford and\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nI do not know why Mr. Churchill avoids as much as possible making\r\nextemporaneous speeches, unless it is his passion for perfection,\r\nbecause as a conversationalist he is without superior and he has few\r\npeers. One of them was his intimate friend, Lord Birkenhead, whose\r\npower of expression was almost on a par with Churchill’s, as I had the\r\nopportunity to observe once in Berlin when the then most brilliant\r\nlawyer in England attended a luncheon of the Anglo-American Press\r\nAssociation and dazzled us with his talk. I remember the answer he\r\ngave when someone asked what he thought of Mussolini. “Mussolini,” he\r\nremarked, “bestrides Italy like a Colossus, but to judge a rider one\r\nmust consider the kind of horse he rides.”\r\n\r\nI have listened to Mr. Churchill talk at the dinner table and\r\nhe is as brilliant there as he is in the House of Commons. His\r\nconversational style has the same classical quality of his writing\r\nand public speaking. Every sentence is rounded and balanced; none\r\nis left incomplete, and I should think that ninety-five per cent of\r\neverything he says in talking with his friends could be taken down\r\nby a stenographer and reproduced without changing a syllable. At the\r\nsame time there is no studied effect and the listeners have not the\r\nfeeling they are attending a recitation or declamation. They are\r\ntransported back to the time when, either in Ancient Greece or in\r\neighteenth century Europe, men cultivated the art of speaking and\r\nespecially of conversation. Who knows what effect it will have upon\r\nEnglish education and English habits of conversation to have had as\r\na Prime Minister during the war a master of the word such as appears\r\nonly seldom in centuries. The oratory of Churchill must already have\r\ninfluenced the language standards of the English-speaking world, even\r\nthough imperceptibly, for it is impossible that so many millions should\r\nhave listened to him and read his speeches without having their taste\r\nimproved. As a contrast it is interesting to observe what the effect\r\nhas already been upon the German language to have had the apostle\r\nof illiteracy as the head of the German Reich for eight years; the\r\nlanguage of Goethe and Heine has been supplanted deliberately by a\r\ncoarse vulgarization of German chosen for its appeal to the lowest\r\ninstincts of the population.\r\n\r\nChurchill attracted much attention when in a memorandum to all\r\ngovernment offices he asked for a more effective and economic use\r\nof the English language in official communications and demanded the\r\nabandonment of the jargon currently in use by bureaucrats. He can be\r\ncolloquial. The first time I met Mr. Churchill was at a luncheon given\r\nby Lady Colefax, who has done more to help American correspondents in\r\nLondon than almost anyone there. Present were Mr. Churchill, J. L.\r\nGarvin, the crusty, brilliant editor of the _Observer_ and one-time\r\neditor of the _Encyclopaedia Brittanica_, Somerset Maugham, Mrs.\r\nSimpson, not yet the wife of Edward, Harold Nicolson, Peter Fleming,\r\nJan Masaryk, and a number of others. The conversation was almost\r\nexclusively between Churchill and Garvin, and well it might be, for\r\nGarvin is one of the few who can talk on anything like equal terms\r\nwith the master, and indeed on this occasion Garvin practically talked\r\nChurchill silent. It was just two years before the war, but the topic\r\nwas even then the position of Russia, and Garvin exclaimed, “Do you\r\nmean to say you would throw in your lot with the Bolsheviks?” The\r\nChurchillian reply was, “I mean just that, old cock!” with a remark to\r\nthe effect that when one had to face an enemy like Germany it would\r\nbe only common sense to try for the help of any ally no matter how\r\ndistasteful otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe can see from Churchill’s policy of helping Russia since the German\r\nattack how consistent he has remained. On the day after the Russians\r\nmarched into Poland--and horrified the world of fellow travelers and\r\ncaused all except party-liners and a few foresighted realists to draw\r\nback in aversion from this manifestation of Red Imperialism--I had\r\na talk with Mr. Churchill, who had been appointed First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty a fortnight before. I asked him whether, since Great Britain\r\nhad guaranteed the territory of Poland against aggression and had\r\ngone to war with Germany because of the German attack on Poland, one\r\ncould now consider that Great Britain was at war with Russia since the\r\nRussians also had attacked Poland? I am not at liberty to quote him,\r\nbut he gave the answer in public a fortnight later when after the fall\r\nof Warsaw he declared: “We could have wished that the Russian Armies\r\nshould be standing on their present line as the friends and allies of\r\nPoland instead of as invaders. _But that the Russian armies should\r\nstand on this line was clearly necessary for the safety of Russia\r\nagainst the Nazi menace...._ I can not forecast to you the action of\r\nRussia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma: but\r\nperhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.”\r\n\r\nThus early and late Churchill maintained that it was desirable to\r\nattempt to bring Russia into arms as an ally against the Germans, and\r\nhe was one of the few men in Britain who could advocate such a policy\r\nwithout being suspected of sympathizing with the Bolsheviks. Only\r\nFinland shook his resolution to do nothing to alienate the Russians and\r\nit is interesting now to recall his words uttered in the midst of the\r\nRussian assault on Finland: “Only Finland, superb, nay, sublime in the\r\njaws of peril--Finland shows what free men can do. The service rendered\r\nby Finland to mankind is magnificent. They have exposed for all the\r\nworld to see, the military incapacity of the Red Army and of the Red\r\nAir Force. Many illusions about Soviet Russia have been dispelled in\r\nthese few fierce weeks of fighting in the Arctic Circle. Everyone can\r\nsee how Communism rots the soul of a nation; how it makes it abject and\r\nhungry in peace and proves it base and abominable in war.”\r\n\r\nHis reaction of sympathy with the people of Finland fighting against\r\n“servitude worse than death” is only one of countless examples that\r\ncould be named of the little-appreciated fact that he is an extremely\r\nsensitive man. His gruff way sometimes conceals it, but there is not\r\na man in public life anywhere who feels the miseries of this stricken\r\nworld with more compassion than Churchill. When eighteen months after\r\nthese caustic remarks about the Communist regime, Russia was attacked\r\nand Mr. Churchill expressed his sympathy with the Russian people, it is\r\ncertain he meant it, although it was good politics too. Incidentally\r\nI am convinced that one of the reasons why he is loath to discuss\r\ndetailed plans for what a victorious Britain would like the postwar\r\nworld to be, is the problem of Russia. Certainly the vast majority of\r\nBritish people would like to see the Bolshevik government replaced by\r\nsome democratic regime.\r\n\r\nI am sure one reason for Churchill’s aversion to Bolshevism is his\r\nstrong family feeling, and his repugnance for the Communist attempt\r\nto subordinate the family, if not to abolish it, as was originally\r\nattempted in the Soviet Union. For his family in the past, his noble\r\nand famous ancestors, he has profound respect and a feeling of proud\r\naffectionate gratitude which has led him to devote a good part of\r\nhis literary labors to the biography of his father, Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill, and to the massive life of the Duke of Marlborough. To his\r\npresent family, his wife Clementine, his daughters Sarah, Diana, and\r\nMary, and his son Randolph, he devotes more time and attention than\r\nmost men with a fraction of his responsibilities. Randolph’s marriage\r\nto the beautiful Pamela Digby was a delight to Mr. Churchill. It\r\nrepresented the only chance of the perpetuation of the Churchill name,\r\nand when Winston Spencer, the first grandchild to bear his name was\r\nborn, he became the favorite member of the dynasty.\r\n\r\nChurchill’s aversions are just as strong and notable as his\r\npredilections. They might be listed, without order: Hitler, Mussolini,\r\nTrotzky, Nazism, Communism, the New Deal, Prohibition, hypocrisy,\r\ncruelty, thick soup, bores, mediocrity, cowardice, stupidity,\r\nsentimentality, bigotry, muddling, proletarianism, poor English, poor\r\nfood, poor anything except poor people. He is intolerant of anything\r\nbut the best. He is the perfect exemplar of a gentleman who never\r\noffends anyone except intentionally. His manners to his friends are\r\nof an old-fashioned courtliness. When he bids a guest farewell Mr.\r\nChurchill comes to the driveway to see him off with a handshake and a\r\nGodspeed. His manners to his enemies are savage and the lash of his\r\ntongue is feared from Berlin to Whitehall. He can be wounding to a\r\ncolleague who has failed to meet requirements. One Cabinet Minister\r\ncomplained that when Churchill dismissed him he “kicked me out as\r\nthough I had been a servant.” As the war wears on and the duties of\r\noffice become heavier, his patience has frayed and the single criticism\r\none can frequently hear is that he has become short-tempered. He\r\nis particularly intolerant of Parliamentary inquiries which would\r\nrequire the Government to reveal facts of military value to the enemy.\r\nConstantly, naive Members ask such questions, and if Mr. Churchill\r\nchooses personally to reply he frequently makes his answer blister. Yet\r\nthere has never been a Prime Minister with a more meticulous regard for\r\nthe rights, functions, and ceremonies of Parliament than Mr. Churchill.\r\nThis regard is such that he has sometimes been criticized for delaying\r\naction until all forms are duly complied with by Parliament.\r\n\r\nChurchill’s restless energy is such that his associates are both\r\ninspired and compelled to work harder than they ever did with anyone\r\nelse. Shortly after he went to the Admiralty I visited his office and\r\nchatted with his secretaries. They were obviously sincere in their\r\nhero worship of him, but equally sincere in their sighs of weariness\r\nover the strenuous schedule they have to follow. Rauschning describes\r\nHitler as an essentially lazy man who “does not know how to work\r\nsteadily. Indeed is incapable of working. He hates to have to read with\r\nconcentration. He rarely reads a book through; usually he only begins\r\nit.” Could there be found a greater contrast than this with the habits\r\nof Churchill whose perpetual industry and powers of concentration are\r\nas important elements in his genius as intellect? As an illustration\r\nof his ability to concentrate I know no better anecdote than the one\r\ntold me by Randolph. It was during the months before the war when Mr.\r\nChurchill was writing the _History of the English Speaking Peoples_,\r\nand every day world without end, he turned out, generally in the\r\nevening, his stint of words from 2,000 upward. It made no difference\r\nwhat was happening in international affairs, or what other demands\r\nwere made upon his time. No excitements or exigencies were allowed\r\nto disturb his writing. But events grew bigger and bigger and to the\r\nprescient eye of Mr. Churchill it became every day more clear that\r\nwar was certain to come, and that a violent gesture by Hitler might\r\nprecipitate it any moment. Suddenly Hitler marched into Prague,\r\nbreaking the fresh vows he had made at Munich, deliberately insulting\r\nBritain and France, cynically strangling the rump state he had sworn\r\nto respect. Throughout Europe ran a shudder and the mind of every man\r\nwas absorbed with anxious exploration of the possibilities. On that\r\nevening Mr. Churchill rose from dinner, and as he started upstairs to\r\nhis workroom to write his stint, he exclaimed to his family, “It will\r\nbe difficult for me tonight to concentrate my undivided attention upon\r\nthe reign of King James II, but I shall do so.”\r\n\r\nAnother time I visited Chartwell with Randolph and as we walked through\r\nthe garden I saw a new brick building and remarked that it had not\r\nbeen there before. “No,” Randolph explained. “Father just built it.”\r\n“You mean, had it built?” I asked. “Oh no, built it with his own\r\nhands.” I had heard about Mr. Churchill’s bricklaying but had no idea\r\nit extended to building whole houses. This one I found was his studio.\r\nHe had laid every brick in the building, and evidently was expert as\r\na professional. He particularly likes difficult jobs such as arches\r\nand corners and curves. The Brick-layers Union at one time admitted\r\nhim to membership, but later called in his card on instructions from\r\nthe central office which objected to the Union’s accepting a Tory\r\npolitician as a member! This brick house, however, was not built by\r\nany honorary bricklayer. If Mr. Churchill ever falls upon evil times\r\nit may serve to recommend him for employment. While Churchill, without\r\nhaving to do so and merely as a hobby, became a qualified artisan in\r\nthe building trades, Hitler could not even out of dire necessity keep\r\na job in the building trades. Churchill might earn a living also as a\r\npainter. The studio walls were hung from top to bottom with the product\r\nof his brush, signed Charles Morin. There were landscapes, seascapes,\r\nand every variety of scene, many of them recording vacations on the\r\nFrench Riviera, his favorite resort. Presently we joined Mr. Churchill\r\nswimming in the outdoor pool he had also personally constructed. Later\r\nhe played cards with his wife. Six-pack bezique was the game. Guests\r\nhad tea on the lawn in the shade of the trees.\r\n\r\nThese were the last peaceful days before the hurricane which it\r\nis fashionable to say will sweep away all that comfortable, easy,\r\ncountry-home England. I do not believe it will do anything of the\r\nkind. The war will certainly leave little of parasitic England. The\r\nvast accumulations of inherited wealth are being swept now into the\r\nhopper of war. It will no longer be possible for Francis Williams\r\nto declare that eighty per cent of the wealth of England belongs to\r\nsix per cent of the population, and that nearly half of the national\r\nincome goes to ten percent of the people. But Churchill’s type of good\r\nliving, country house and all, will not disappear, for it is based upon\r\nhis own labors, as we could see demonstrated before our eyes. After\r\nthe card game Mr. Churchill went upstairs to his workroom and about\r\nan hour later came down with the manuscript of a 1,500-word article\r\nfor the _Daily Telegraph_ which he had just dictated. I read it with\r\nprofessional envy, for in only a few minutes he had produced one of\r\nhis characteristic gems, informative, learned, witty, for which he\r\nwould receive a remuneration about equivalent to the annual income of\r\nan average American newspaperman. He frequently surpasses this feat in\r\neconomizing time. He used to write many of his newspaper articles on\r\nthe way up to London in his automobile, dictating to his secretary.\r\n\r\nChurchill has now by act of Parliament completely dictatorial powers\r\nand can order any British citizen to perform any service or can\r\nconfiscate any property, but he has yet to be criticized for ruling\r\narbitrarily. He hates silly questions and will walk away from a bore,\r\nor cut a hypocrite down with an epigram. Whisky, he believes, is a boon\r\nto mankind, and he has never been the worse, but often the better for\r\nit. The two men he most abhors in our time are Hitler and Trotzky, both\r\nteetotalers. He is a gourmand, that is to say a man with a sensitive\r\ntaste in food who likes a lot of it. Once he was in ill health and\r\nwent to a noted specialist who, contrary to the fashion of the day and\r\ndespite the patient’s well-upholstered body, advised him to eat more\r\nfood. He follows the prescription enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nOne night, about eighteen months before the war, traveling from\r\nLondon to Paris, I had the good luck to be on the same train with Mr.\r\nChurchill. After he had finished his work he invited me to join him.\r\nAll the way from London to Dover he had dictated to a secretary who\r\nwas to return to London. This is the way he works, incessantly, never\r\nwasting a moment. Our train was run onto a massive ferryboat, a new\r\nsystem of crossing the Channel and this was Mr. Churchill’s first\r\nexperience of it. It was bitterly cold. Mr. Churchill wore a heavy\r\nfur-lined coat. We started to explore the ferryboat. Word got about\r\namong the crew that Winston Churchill was aboard, and speedily men\r\ngathered to salute him and mention their service in the Royal Naval\r\nVolunteer Reserve, which he organized. The Captain invited us to the\r\nbridge. Steaming out of Dover harbor with an icy wind cutting our\r\nfaces, we listened as the Captain pointed out the lights of two wrecks\r\nnear the harbor and ventured the opinion that “You, Sir, I believe\r\nordered those ships sunk to block the harbor entrance to submarines?”\r\nMr. Churchill believed the skipper was right.\r\n\r\nWith unflagging energy Mr. Churchill led the way about the ship from\r\nthe bridge to the hold, stopping now and then to exchange a few\r\nsentences with his admirers. Churchill had been out of the government\r\nthen for many years, but he remained the best-known figure in the\r\nrealm and one could measure his popularity by the reception he received\r\non the ferryboat. Toward midnight we climbed to the smoking room where\r\nMr. Churchill as a nightcap consumed a large platter of thick slices\r\nof rare roast beef with the appetite of John Bull. As I watched him I\r\nthought to myself that this is the way he deals with life, he devours\r\nit. When during the quiet period of the war he made an intensive\r\ninspection of the French and British positions and the Maginot line,\r\nFrench officers were astonished at his ability to sit up with his hosts\r\nstudying and discussing the problems of war and probably a hundred\r\nother things, including certainly the dry vintage champagne he likes\r\nso well, and then appear again a few hours later at dawn for a hearty\r\nbreakfast with cigar! No Frenchmen and few of any other nationality\r\nsmoke cigars for breakfast, but Mr. Churchill finds them invigorating.\r\nHe is seldom without one in his waking hours.\r\n\r\nThe last time I visited him he received me at about 9:30 A.M. in the\r\nupper bedroom at Number Ten Downing Street. The Prime Minister was\r\nsitting up in bed, cigar in mouth, hard at work with a kind of bed desk\r\nin front of him to hold his papers, and pinned within easy reaching\r\ndistance on the wall a rack for various colored folders to hold\r\ndocuments of different urgencies. This man who might justly be called\r\nthe most industrious human being on earth, is a believer in the maxim\r\nof Mark Twain who did most of his voluminous writing in bed: “A man’s a\r\nfool who runs when he can stand still, or stands when he can sit down,\r\nor sits when he can lie down.”\r\n\r\nFor serious writing Mr. Churchill requires the stimulus of striding up\r\nand down, but he finds that for reading and working over state papers\r\nand for dictating letters and memoranda, there is no more efficient\r\nposition than sitting up in bed. To sleep Mr. Churchill does not\r\nnecessarily require a bed, for such are his powers of endurance that\r\nnow in his sixty-seventh year he frequently when on tours of inspection\r\ntakes his night’s rest in his automobile. I remember saying good-by to\r\nhim one afternoon before the Admiralty and as he was climbing into his\r\ncar to drive to one of the great naval ports, his aide-de-camp asked\r\nhim where he would spend the night. Mr. Churchill replied, “In the car\r\ndriving back.” No Prime Minister has ever moved about his constituency\r\nso much, so tirelessly, and so dangerously as Mr. Churchill who travels\r\nday and night by blackout and under bombardment. He manages the total\r\nwar effort of the Empire, but as he has repeatedly emphasized, the\r\nwar will be won or lost in the British Isles, and inside this mighty\r\nfortress the Prime Minister gives the major part of his attention to\r\nhis duties as Commander in Chief. He is incessantly on inspection.\r\n\r\nLike the Captain of an old-time castle under siege, he roams from\r\nbattlement to battlement, from the South of England to the North of\r\nScotland, viewing the coast defenses, visiting naval stations, driving\r\nthe newest tanks, witnessing test flights of the latest warplanes,\r\ncheering the R.A.F., the troops, the civilian population, sharing their\r\ndangers, striding through the dust of bombs, and always everywhere\r\ncomprehending instantly, offering suggestions, giving the orders of the\r\nexpert he is in every branch of defense. It is sometimes forgotten that\r\nif Hitler is indeed the Marshal in Chief of the German war machine,\r\nso is Churchill of the British war machine, and if Hitler has proved\r\na military leader of intuitive genius, Churchill has incomparably\r\nmore experience and scientific education in war, and certainly no\r\nless imagination than Hitler even in the narrow field of strictly\r\nmilitary affairs. Hitler had four years of the last war as a private\r\nand corporal; has read military history; since he became Chancellor\r\nhas had the counsel of the Prussian General Staff; and now has had two\r\nyears’ experience of war. Churchill’s military education began with\r\nthe exacting instruction of Sandhurst and for practical experience in\r\nold-fashioned combat he witnessed or took part in the Boer War, the\r\nRiver War in India, civil war in Cuba, and the Sudan campaign. In the\r\nfirst World War he helped direct the struggle from one of its most\r\nimportant posts, the Admiralty, conceived the tank and numerous other\r\nnew devices of war, fought in France as a colonel, and all the while\r\nbefore and since, studied and wrote about war until he became one of\r\nits foremost historians. These experiences and studies are those of a\r\nDoctor of Philosophy compared to Hitler’s grammar school course. In the\r\nlong run, granting all of Hitler’s genius, I am convinced Churchill,\r\ngiven the tools, will win--but not without America.\r\n\r\nYou may object that it seems absurd to compare favorably the military\r\nabilities of a commander of forces which have constantly been on the\r\ndefensive with those of the chief of troops so far ever victorious. But\r\nthe war is a long way from its end, and before that goal is reached,\r\nthe military qualifications of Churchill may prove their superiority\r\nover Hitler’s. Churchill has not yet had the opportunity to show\r\nwhat he can do as a war leader pitted with equal weapons against the\r\nenemy, because the war machine he inherited from the feeble hands\r\nof Chamberlain was for a long time capable of nothing but defense.\r\nMeanwhile as the British plus American war machine is growing, it\r\nis encouraging to remember that Churchill with his background of\r\nforty years of war, study of war and leadership in war, his youthful\r\ninventive mind and eager imagination, is capable of taking everything\r\nthe Germans have devised or used successfully, and improving it until\r\nwith the eventually superior resources he will command, victory will be\r\ncertain, provided always that the United States enters the war in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. WAR AIMS\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What are Britain’s war aims?_\r\n\r\nA. We Americans may still find it interesting to inquire “What are\r\nthey fighting for?” but if we stood in the midst of the ruins of\r\nWestminster Abbey or the House of Commons, it would not occur to us\r\nto ask the question. Mr. Churchill has joined President Roosevelt\r\nin a formal statement, the so-called Atlantic Charter, but it seems\r\nto me that he has twice expressed himself far more eloquently and\r\naccurately than he did in the Eight Points. In those dread days when\r\ndespair touched nearly every soul but his, and he had just accepted the\r\nresponsibility of leading his country at the moment of its greatest\r\nperil, Mr. Churchill said: “You ask what is our policy? I say: It is\r\nto wage war by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the\r\nstrength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny\r\nnever surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime.\r\nThat is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word:\r\nVictory! Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory\r\nhowever long and hard the way may be; for without victory there is no\r\nsurvival.”\r\n\r\nSimple survival does not seem enough for some comfortably situated\r\ncritics in this country sheltered by British resistance, but that is\r\nonly because it is so difficult for those who have not experienced\r\nthe near threat of death to understand what life means. Mr. Churchill\r\nexpressed the irritation at such questions that must seize anyone\r\nwho has witnessed the effect of Hitler’s terrible force when in a\r\ndiscussion of Poland he exclaimed: “What a frightful fate has overtaken\r\nPoland! Here was a community of nearly thirty-five millions of people\r\nwith all the organization of a modern government and all the traditions\r\nof an ancient state, which in a few weeks was dashed out of civilized\r\nexistence to become an incoherent multitude of tortured and starving\r\nmen, women and children, ground beneath the heel of two rival forms of\r\nwithering and blasting tyranny. Although the fate of Poland stares them\r\nin the face, there are thoughtless dilettanti or purblind worldlings\r\nwho sometimes ask us: ‘What is it that Britain is fighting for?’ To\r\nthis I answer, ‘If we left off fighting you would soon find out.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _I understand that, but after victory, what? That won’t be the\r\nend of the world; after we win we shall have a lot to do. What was\r\nthe meaning of the Churchill-Roosevelt meeting and their eight-point\r\ndeclaration?_\r\n\r\nA. The meeting and its published result, which Churchill calls the\r\nAtlantic Charter, made an interesting commentary and answer to the\r\ndemand for a statement of war aims. Its first importance lay in the\r\nfact of the meeting of the two men; its second importance lay in the\r\nconfidential discussion of ways and means of beating Hitler; its\r\nthird importance was a statement of war aims. I have not been able\r\nto understand why the statement was labeled in this country as an\r\nAmerican statement, as though the President had imposed it upon the\r\nPrime Minister, or as though the principal ideas contained in it\r\nwere characterized more by American unselfishness than by British\r\nhardheadedness. It may very well be that Churchill was reluctant to\r\nmake any statement of war aims at all, but now that it has been made it\r\nseems to me to be hardheaded, and frankly Churchillian and not at all\r\nthe sort of statement that American liberals had been discussing.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why not; is there anything not liberal in the statement?_\r\n\r\nA. Not to my way of thinking, but the average liberal argued there\r\nshould be a statement of war aims in order first of all to impress\r\nthe good German people that we are kindly disposed toward them and if\r\nthey knew how well we intended to treat them after they were defeated\r\nthey would give up now. What is the sense of the Atlantic Charter? Its\r\nchief meaning is that the main war aim and peace aim is to make the\r\nworld safe against Germany. It names two ways of accomplishing this\r\naim: A. By destruction of the Nazi power and disarmament of Germany\r\nand her allies. B. By restoration of the nations now enslaved. Does\r\nthis constitute an encouragement for the Germans to give up? Hardly.\r\nChurchill and Roosevelt were too clear-sighted and too candid to\r\nfall in with the argument that the German people could be fooled by\r\na dishonest statement of war aims. They knew that the Germans are\r\nbound to realize if they lose this war they will be worse off than\r\nif they win. War is Hell, but much more hellish for the defeated\r\nside. It is untrue that war never settles anything. It always settles\r\nsomething, whether for a short time, as for the twenty years following\r\nthe uncompleted war of 1914-1918, or forever as the Third Punic War.\r\nThe Germans know this better than almost any other people. But now\r\nthey have had a crushingly frank statement of basic British-American\r\nwar aims: abolition of German military power. This time they cannot\r\ncomplain they have been deceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Wasn’t that true of Wilson’s Fourteen Points? Weren’t they a\r\nfrank statement to the Germans of the terms they could expect if they\r\nsurrendered?_\r\n\r\nA. No. In the first place, one great difference between Wilson’s\r\nFourteen Points and the Eight Points of the Atlantic Charter is that\r\nWilson acted alone, and issued his Fourteen Points to the world in\r\nJanuary 1918, without consulting Britain or France, so that when the\r\nGermans in October finally in the extremity of defeat accepted them,\r\nBritain and France were not bound by them at all. In the second place,\r\nthe Fourteen Points declared there should be general disarmament, and\r\nnot just a one-sided German disarmament, so that when as a matter of\r\ncommon prudence, the British and French insisted upon and obtained\r\nGerman disarmament ahead of their own, the Germans protested they had\r\nbeen betrayed by Wilson particularly and by the Allies in general.\r\nHitler based his campaign for power in Germany largely upon his\r\ncomplaint that Germany had never been fairly beaten on the battlefield,\r\nbut had been betrayed by the Fourteen Points. Now it is hard to see how\r\nany future Hitler can raise again such a complaint since the Germans\r\nare now given fair warning that when they are beaten their present\r\ngovernment will be abolished, and their arms will be taken from them\r\nwhile the British and Americans keep their arms intact. This is a\r\nrefreshing example of common-sense honesty. It seems almost as though\r\nChurchill’s and Roosevelt’s clear-sighted candor might finally brush\r\naway the mists of false feeling and thinking which have obscured our\r\nview of the war and of our own interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You have named what might be called a negative side of the Atlantic\r\nCharter as being its most important side._\r\n\r\nA. It is, if you call it negative to aim to destroy the power which has\r\ntorn the whole world apart.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Yes, but after that power is destroyed, or rendered impotent, what\r\nare we or the British going to do to consolidate the gains of victory?\r\nHow are we going to be better off?_\r\n\r\nA. If you think we are going to be better off, or could be better off\r\nthan we were before 1939, the answer is that we cannot be because\r\nno matter which side wins the world as a whole is going to be very\r\nmuch worse off for a long time than it was before the war began. We\r\nare not offered the choice now of fighting in order to improve our\r\npresent position. Our choice is, either to fight and save something\r\nof our most precious spiritual as well as material possessions; or\r\nnot to fight and lose everything. The world as a whole is bound to be\r\nmaterially much poorer after this war no matter who is victor, although\r\nthe United States ought to come out of it in better condition than any\r\nother country. Think of the immense demolition which has been wrought\r\nand is now being wrought in Europe. Just to name a few of the cities\r\nwhich have been bombarded and have suffered varying degrees of damage\r\nis to compile a roll of casualties never equaled: London, Manchester,\r\nLiverpool, Portsmouth, Southampton, Plymouth, Coventry; Berlin,\r\nHamburg, Bremen, Cologne, Duisburg, Essen, Dortmund; Warsaw; Belgrade;\r\nLeningrad, Moscow, Minsk, Smolensk, Odessa, Kiev; Alexandria; Nanking,\r\nHankow, Chungking. From China to Egypt and from England to Central\r\nRussia, fire and high explosives have blasted scars it will take a\r\ncentury to heal.\r\n\r\nThe diversion of billions of man-hours from productive work to the\r\nmaking of war supplies, the loss of lives, and the dislocation of\r\nmillions of human existences, and of the whole world economy, will\r\nimpoverish us all for a certain length of time. Happily there are\r\nreasons for believing the United States will suffer less than almost\r\nany other part of the human family, provided only that we enter the\r\nwar soon enough to ensure the defeat of the Nazi power and do not\r\nwait to face that power alone. We must keep one thing firmly in mind,\r\nthat though our condition may be poor if we are victorious, it will\r\nbe definitely better than if we are defeated, and though we may lack\r\nin goods and comforts as a result of our participation in the war, we\r\nshall be far richer and easier in body, mind, and soul after hard-won\r\nvictory than if we attempted to purchase from the conquering Nazis a\r\nhumiliating security.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why should the United States, as you suggested, come out of the war\r\nin a better economic condition than the others?_\r\n\r\nA. First, because if we enter the war in time to have any Allies, we\r\nshall probably be physically undamaged. That is, as long as the British\r\nIsles, our foremost fortress, persists in its resistance it is not\r\nlikely that we shall suffer any important injuries by air bombardment\r\nor otherwise. You can see how important this factor is if you consider\r\nthe condition of the cities of England now, and how much money, labor,\r\nand time it will take to restore them. Second, the economic structure\r\nof the United States can more easily be transferred back from war to\r\npeace production than most countries. After this war there will be an\r\nincrease in the private use of airplanes comparable to the increase\r\nin automobile ownership after the first successful Ford. Our warplane\r\nproduction can be easily switched to the production of private planes,\r\nand many observers would not be surprised to see American private plane\r\nproduction go into six figures and then into seven.\r\n\r\nThe United States, as the most self-contained of the belligerent\r\npowers, at the end of the war will have everything necessary to resume\r\nits own economic progress and to help the world recover.\r\n\r\nEurope will be starving and desperately in need of our agricultural\r\nproducts, our cotton, and of almost everything else we produce. If\r\nwe wish decisively to influence the organization of the world, one\r\npowerful lever will be our economic power after the war, our ability\r\nif we like, to finance the reconstruction of Europe. With wisdom and\r\nfar-sight in control of our administration we ought to be able to put\r\nback into circulation some of our monstrous hoard of gold, for our\r\nown good as well as that of the world. Sometimes when one succumbs\r\nto optimism, it seems possible that there may come after this war a\r\nmarvelous opportunity to reshape the affairs of mankind into a happier\r\npattern. We shall have an opportunity such as we have never had before,\r\nnot even after the last war, to make our hopes and aspirations\r\npractically effective, but only of course if we enter the war in time.\r\nThere is a fourth reason why we should be economically or financially\r\nbetter off at the end of this war than at the end of the last one:\r\nwe now have no war-debt problem. Who will deny now that everyone\r\nwould have been better off after the last war if international debts,\r\nincluding reparations, had been canceled all around. This aspect of\r\nthe Lend-Lease program may go down in history as Roosevelt’s cleverest\r\ndevice.\r\n\r\nThis sounds almost as though I thought the war would be a blessing to\r\nAmerica, emerging undamaged, easily reverting to peacetime production,\r\nstored with goods for our own consumption and for export to clamoring\r\nmillions abroad, and with no delinquent war debtors to confuse our\r\nfinancial affairs. Actually I do not think the war will be a blessing,\r\nexcept as it unifies us and does something to cleanse us of the scum\r\nof materialism. This view of America’s chances of coming relatively\r\nunscathed out of the war depends entirely upon comparison of our fate\r\nwith that of other countries, maimed by bombardment, mutilated by the\r\nloss of millions of breadwinners, fiscally bankrupt, economically\r\nparalyzed, politically divided, and in the case of some, the prey of\r\nanarchy. Think what the problem of leadership will be in most of the\r\ncountries of Europe. In Germany and Italy the tyrants have long ago\r\nexecuted, imprisoned, exiled or otherwise effectively removed from the\r\npolitical scene every possible candidate for office not in agreement\r\nwith them. In France the demoralization caused by defeat and Vichy’s\r\ncollaboration with the enemy has left few men with the initiative and\r\ncourage to become leaders of a renascent republic. If, as so frequently\r\nhappens, we become inclined to take an over-cheerful view of ourselves\r\nand our prospects, we ought to be sobered by the thought of our\r\nresponsibilities in the postwar world. Whether we like it or not, and\r\nour isolationists to the contrary notwithstanding, the United States\r\nafter this war is going to be compelled to assume the leadership of\r\nthe Western World, not only economically but politically. But we shall\r\nbe able effectively to influence the peace only if we have effectively\r\ntaken part in the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What will the peace conference be like?_\r\n\r\nA. It might be more instructive in the first place to discuss what\r\nthe peace will be like if Hitler wins. Of course there will not be\r\nany peace _conference_ if Hitler wins. The Quislings and Darlans will\r\nbe called to function for the states of Europe in the same way as\r\nHitler’s rubber-stamp Reichstag functions for Germany. We know now\r\nwhat Hitler plans to impose upon the world. Let us begin with Europe.\r\nEurope is to belong exclusively to the Germans. They as a master race\r\nwill occupy the top of a pyramid at the bottom of which are the Poles,\r\nCzechs, Serbs, and other “subhuman Slavs” who constitute the lowest\r\nclass of slaves. Between these “untouchables” and the Germans will\r\ncome all the other peoples of Europe, arranged in order depending\r\npartially upon their degree of racial kinship with the noble Teutons,\r\nbut more on the degree of their subservience and “collaboration.”\r\nThe Dutch and Scandinavians, for example, are considered by the\r\nNazis to be semi-Teutonic cousins, but they will not be ranked as\r\nhigh as the French if the Vichy appeasers succeed in their policy of\r\n“collaboration.”\r\n\r\nNow that Italy has proved an even feebler war partner than her worst\r\ndetractors had imagined, Hitler obviously is considering the grant to\r\nFrance of the position of First Vassal instead of Italy. Spain, if she\r\neventually enters the war, will be given a role perhaps second to that\r\nof Italy, chiefly because Spanish influence will be helpful in the\r\nconquest of South America. Sweden and Switzerland will of course be\r\n_gleichgeschaltet_, or “coordinated” into the Nazi system and given a\r\nrank corresponding to their servility. But all are slaves, including\r\nthe Axis “allies” Italy, Hungary, Spain, and they differ one from\r\nanother only in the degree of their degradation. None of them will\r\nbe permitted to bear arms capable of threatening their Nazi masters,\r\nand none will have a word in the formulation of the major laws which\r\ndetermine their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _In what sense will the conquered people be slaves?_\r\n\r\nA. Politically, they will be disfranchised, without a vote, unable to\r\ninfluence their own fate except by humble petition to Berlin. For the\r\nmost part they will be ruled by Nazi governors. States like Poland\r\nwill also have Nazis ruling the smallest organs of government, as\r\nmunicipalities. States like France may be permitted to operate their\r\nown provincial and municipal governments under a Nazi _Gauleiter fuer\r\nFrankreich_.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But Germans also have no vote under the Nazi system. How does the\r\nposition of these other nationalities under the Nazis differ from that\r\nof the Germans themselves?_\r\n\r\nA. It differs as the night from day. Every ruling made and every\r\naction taken by the Nazi governors of the vassal states is intended\r\nto procure tribute for the Great German Reich, tribute which,\r\nscientifically extracted, will prove greater over the years than any\r\namount of old-fashioned looting could have produced. This tribute,\r\nwhich is to be paid not merely for generations to come, but as Hitler\r\nmodestly estimates, for 1,000 years, will go to elevate the standard\r\nof living of all Germans, and to depress the standard of living of all\r\nnon-Germans. It makes no difference that most Germans have no voice\r\nin their government; every German will be under Hitler’s New Order, a\r\nslaveholder, and every non-German inhabitant of occupied territory is\r\nautomatically a slave of the whole German tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How is this to be accomplished? Isn’t it difficult to extract\r\ntribute? Didn’t the Allies have trouble getting reparations from\r\nGermany?_\r\n\r\nA. The Allies were innocent children compared with the Nazis in the\r\nart of obtaining advantage from one’s beaten adversary. No one knows\r\nwhether Hitler’s system will work for 1,000 years, or for ten or two\r\nyears, but it certainly is a grandiose design without any parallel in\r\nthe history of human conquest. First is the movement of populations.\r\nHitler has moved upward of two million Poles from Western Poland,\r\ndumped them indiscriminately in Central Poland, and replaced them\r\nwith Germans, some from the Baltic states, some from the Tyrol, some\r\nfrom the Reich. The Poles as a rule were visited by the Gestapo after\r\nmidnight, given half an hour’s notice to leave their homes forever,\r\nallowed to take but a single suitcase with food for three days and\r\nthe clothes on their backs. They were forbidden to take any of their\r\nown articles of value, not even a silver spoon from the kitchen or a\r\nrake from the barn. The German families moving in were fewer than the\r\nevacuated Poles, so that the Germans became wealthier per capita than\r\nthe Poles had been. The Poles died for the most part, or else are still\r\nin process of dying from starvation and exposure; it was part of the\r\nGerman calculation that they should die. Similar methods were used to\r\nevacuate the French from Lorraine.\r\n\r\nOther desirable parts of Europe contiguous to the Great German Reich\r\nwill be evacuated of their native populations and settled by the\r\nGermans. This constitutes looting on a grand scale. Sir Norman Angell,\r\nprofound thinker on war, once held in his Nobel prize-winning thesis\r\n“The Great Illusion,” that modern conquest cannot pay in this Christian\r\nday and age, because the acquisition of mere political control over an\r\nenemy’s territory, the advancing of the flag over foreign lands, does\r\nnot pay even for the cost of the war. The usual incidental looting by\r\nthe soldiery amounts of course to nothing from the point of view of\r\nthe nation’s economics. Sir Norman could not be blamed for failing\r\nto foresee the grand-scale looting practiced by the Nazis. There is\r\nan evident economic advantage to the nation if a million of its farm\r\nfamilies are moved into rich, fully equipped farms robbed from the\r\nconquered and expelled enemy. But this sort of looting is only the\r\nbeginning of Nazi total plunder. In France the major part of the\r\nproductive apparatus in industry, trade, and the professions is being\r\nsystematically taken over by the Nazis. This is only a step toward\r\nthe huge permanent system of eternal tribute, which is based upon the\r\nexploitation of the labor power of Europe.\r\n\r\nNo conqueror since the Romans has ever been able profitably to exploit\r\nthe labor power of his conquests, but the Nazis propose to do so and\r\nare doing so and boast they will continue to do so for centuries. The\r\nNazis intend to concentrate all industry in Germany, and to convert\r\nthe rest of Europe into an agricultural colony growing food and raw\r\nmaterials for the master state, the Great German Reich. The entire\r\npopulation of non-German Europe is to be turned and is already being\r\nturned as fast as possible into a vast army of coolies of the soil,\r\ntoiling to supply the Third Reich. The coolies will likewise be\r\nrequired to buy all their industrial products from Germany. The price\r\nthe Germans pay for the coolies’ agricultural products and the price\r\nthe coolies pay for the German goods will be fixed by the Germans. Nice\r\ncalculation will arrive at the precise prices which will bring the\r\nHerrenvolk the maximum advantage. The Germans with their traditional\r\nscientific acumen will certainly find it to their advantage to pay\r\ntheir coolies such prices for agricultural products as will enable the\r\ncoolies to buy liberally of German manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nThus with a little reasonableness and spirit of accommodation on\r\nthe side of the coolies, who ought to be happy to give up the\r\nresponsibility of liberty, and glad to dispense with the obligations\r\nconnected with free speech, press, assembly, and thought, Hitler\r\nEurope might settle down into one great unhappy family, orderly as a\r\npenitentiary, quiet as a grave. It is important also to note that by\r\nturning their conquered populations into farm hands the Nazis make\r\nit much easier to keep their victims permanently disarmed, since\r\nonly industry on a large scale can turn out tanks, machine guns, and\r\nwarplanes necessary for insurrection against a totalitarian tyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But Hitler has not destroyed or removed the factories from France\r\nand not even from Poland, since we constantly read that he is obtaining\r\nconsiderable war supplies from the industrial plants in the occupied\r\nregions._\r\n\r\nA. That is because the war is not over yet and Hitler has not had\r\ntime to move these factories into Germany. He needs their products\r\nimmediately for the war against England and Russia. After his\r\nconquest of Poland he kept many Polish factories, notably locomotive\r\nand freight-car plants, running in Poland with German supervisors,\r\nbut after the fall of France, during that period when he was sure\r\nEngland would capitulate also, he ordered these factories transferred\r\nto Germany. Then after the British failed to surrender and as soon\r\nas it became plain that the war would last some time longer, Hitler\r\ncountermanded the transfer of the Polish factories, and many of them\r\nare running today on Polish soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Where is Hitler going to get the man power to run such a huge\r\nindustrial machine, comprising the manufactories formerly owned in all\r\nthe rest of Europe?_\r\n\r\nA. That is a question which closely concerns us all in America. Hitler\r\nwill get the man power in part from his own partially demobilized\r\narmies, but in part also from the conquered coolies, millions of\r\nwhom are not agricultural workers at all, but skilled mechanics and\r\ntechnicians. German authorities admit, or boast, that today 2,000,000\r\nprisoners of war and “others” are working in German factories, mines,\r\nand on farms. It is against the products of this essentially slave\r\nlabor that American industrial products would have to compete if Hitler\r\nafter conquering Britain offered merely to compete with the United\r\nStates in foreign trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Would we not then be at a great disadvantage? How could we compete\r\nat all?_\r\n\r\nA. We could not compete successfully. Under the Nazi system, precisely\r\nas under its twin brother, the Soviet system, all foreign trade is\r\ncarried on by a foreign trade monopoly. It has a hundred different\r\nnames in Germany but in reality every foreign trade transaction is a\r\ngovernment transaction. Competition among Germans is thus eliminated\r\nand any foreigner attempting to compete with the Nazi Colossus has\r\nas much chance to succeed as a one-well oil producer trying to trade\r\nagainst the Standard Oil Company. No American manufacturer, no matter\r\nhow big, including our automobile manufacturers, could buck the Nazi\r\nmachine, because in addition to its slave labor prices, and its\r\ngovernment foreign trade monopoly, it would have the advantage of\r\nterrific political-military pressure on all the states in the world\r\nnot yet an integral part of the Nazi Empire. What South American state\r\ndo you think would have the nerve to stand up to a Germany which had\r\njust finished off the whole of Europe and the British Empire? Which one\r\nof them would refuse to give Nazi goods favored tariff treatment over\r\nAmerican goods notwithstanding any existing treaties?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _If these are Hitler’s plans for Europe, what does he intend to do\r\nwith Africa, Asia, and America if he wins?_\r\n\r\nA. He intends to swallow piece by piece the entire world, but since he\r\ncannot do so by immediate, world-wide conquest, he would like to be\r\nallowed periods of negotiated peace during which he could allow his\r\nforces to recuperate while by soothing reassurances he lulls that part\r\nof the world not yet under his dominion, into a state of helplessness.\r\nIf he could, after the conquest of Russia, make a negotiated peace with\r\nBritain and tacitly, with the United States, he would expect, after a\r\nbreathing spell, to be stronger relative to the combined strength of\r\nBritain and America than he is now. When his superiority in strength\r\nhad reached a certain point, he would attack again.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How could Hitler expect to be stronger since we are now building\r\nour two-ocean Navy and our great Air Force and Army? Even if Hitler\r\nwere now or soon to obtain negotiated peace, wouldn’t we continue\r\nto forge ahead and grow stronger? Wouldn’t we in the face of a\r\nHitler-dominated world which would result from a negotiated peace be\r\ncompelled to turn the United States into an armed camp, and wouldn’t we\r\nincrease our armaments until we were invulnerable?_\r\n\r\nA. That is not at all certain. If we continue in our present state of\r\ncomplacency, we might take a negotiated peace to be a sign that we\r\ncould disarm. The House of Representatives passed the bill extending\r\nthe service of selectees beyond one year by a vote of 203 to 202.\r\nOne vote preserved the existence of our embryo army. It was not a\r\nmere technical question of how long an army man ought to serve. The\r\nquestion was whether we were to have an army at all. In the midst of\r\nthe war, when every qualified expert declared the United States faced\r\nmortal perils, the House of Representatives could find a majority of\r\nbut one-tenth of one per cent in favor of maintaining or attempting to\r\nconstruct an effective army. I know the majority would have been larger\r\nif the administration leaders had known the vote could come so close,\r\nbut the fact remains that in this crisis of our national life, with the\r\nenemy rampant and untamed, the House took this complacent view of our\r\ndefense necessities.\r\n\r\nNow what would be the attitude of Congress if a peace should be\r\nnegotiated? Would not our isolationists say this was a God-given\r\nopportunity to reduce our tremendous expenditures, whittle the\r\nArmy down to police size, confine our Air Force to a few thousand\r\nplanes, and stop building our two-ocean Navy? Certainly they would,\r\nand all the immense propaganda resources of the Nazis would be\r\nemployed to encourage throughout the United States such a move toward\r\n“common-sense pacifism.” Now, the argument would run, the war is over,\r\nHitler is satisfied, let us go back to normalcy. Whether we actually\r\nsuccumbed entirely to this temptation or not, there would be a strong\r\nisolationist campaign in favor of our disarmament, and this would\r\nsurely slow up our defense effort. Meanwhile Hitler would be bringing\r\nhis New Order slave states with their industries and agriculture into\r\nthe service of the Reich, increasing his Navy, rebuilding his Air\r\nForce, re-equipping his Army and in general growing stronger relative\r\nto us. He would never want a negotiated peace unless he believed this\r\nwould be its result.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Have you any idea what kind of negotiated peace Hitler would\r\nconsider acceptable? Would such a peace be as desirable for us as\r\nWheeler and Lindbergh say? I notice Lindbergh recently urged that the\r\nonly alternative to a negotiated peace was “either a Hitler victory\r\nor a prostrate Europe or a prostrate Europe and possibly a prostrate\r\nAmerica as well.”_\r\n\r\nA. Fortunately Axis sources have given us a rather complete blueprint\r\nof what they would consider acceptable terms of a negotiated peace.\r\nReduced to a few words, their terms are: Surrender by Britain and\r\nAmerica of control of the seas by reduction of the British and American\r\nnavies to parity with the Axis and demilitarization of British and\r\nAmerican naval bases outside home waters; German dominion over all\r\nEurope, most of Africa, and parts of Asia; Japanese control of the rest\r\nof Asia; and the United States to open the doors of Latin America to\r\nAxis enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you mean that those are serious terms suggested for a so-called\r\nnegotiated peace? What is the source of these terms?_\r\n\r\nA. It is the version put out by the Japanese Foreign Office through its\r\norgan the _Japan Times Advertiser_, April 29, 1941, as a trial balloon.\r\nIt remains the most comprehensive statement of Axis terms yet issued.\r\nSince the British government ignored it, and the British and American\r\npress derided it, Germany dropped the idea for the moment, but you\r\nmay be sure it has not been dropped for good. Seven weeks after its\r\npublication Hitler sent his armies into Russia. When he has attained\r\nhis goal there, it seems highly probable he will again offer peace and\r\nwhen he does, the general outline of his terms will probably follow\r\nthis statement. One has only to remember that since the issuance of\r\nthis provisional peace text Russia has been stricken from the list of\r\n“the nations called upon to settle world peace” and has been added as a\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But didn’t the meeting of Churchill and Roosevelt exclude the\r\npossibility of a negotiated peace, since they declared in their\r\neight-point program that “final destruction of the Nazi tyranny” was\r\nthe precondition to peace?_\r\n\r\nA. They did, but Hitler, though he may have little hope of actually\r\nachieving a negotiated peace, may offer it in order to appeal over the\r\nheads of Churchill and Roosevelt to those elements of the British and\r\nAmerican populations he considers vulnerable to his propaganda. There\r\nare few such elements left in England, but many here. Hitler knows\r\nby now that he has only to furnish the ammunition and Lindbergh and\r\nWheeler will do the firing for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Have you the text of these Hitler terms?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, and it would be most instructive to compare it with the\r\neight-point Atlantic Charter.\r\n\r\n JOINT DECLARATION\r\n\r\n The President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister,\r\n Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty’s Government in the United\r\n Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain\r\n common principles in the national policies of their respective\r\n countries on which they base their hopes for a better future of the\r\n world.\r\n\r\n First: Their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other;\r\n\r\n Second: They desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord\r\n with the freely expressed wishes of the people concerned;\r\n\r\n Third: They desire to respect the right of all peoples to choose the\r\n form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see\r\n sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been\r\n forcibly deprived of them;\r\n\r\n Fourth: They will endeavor, with due respect for their existing\r\n obligations, to further the enjoyment by all states, great or small,\r\n victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to\r\n the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic\r\n prosperity;\r\n\r\n Fifth: They desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between\r\n all nations in the economic field, with the object of securing\r\n for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social\r\n security;\r\n\r\n Sixth: After the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to\r\n see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of\r\n dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford\r\n assurance that all the men in the lands may live out their lives in\r\n freedom from fear and want;\r\n\r\n Seventh: Such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas\r\n and oceans without hindrance;\r\n\r\n Eighth: They believe that all of the nations of the world, for\r\n realistic as well as spiritual reasons, must come to the abandonment\r\n of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if\r\n land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which\r\n threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they\r\n believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of\r\n general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential.\r\n They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures\r\n which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of\r\n armaments.\r\n\r\n    _Franklin D. Roosevelt._\r\n    _Winston S. Churchill._\r\n\r\nTo this the President added in his message to Congress: “It is also\r\nunnecessary for me to point out that the declaration of principles\r\nincludes of necessity the world need for freedom of religion and\r\nfreedom of information. No society of the world organized under the\r\nannounced principles could survive without these freedoms which are\r\na part of the whole freedom for which we strive.” And Mr. Churchill\r\nmade this significant comment in his broadcast: “There are, however,\r\ntwo distinct and marked differences in this joint declaration from\r\nthe attitude adopted by the Allies during the latter part of the last\r\nwar, and no one should overlook them. The United States and Great\r\nBritain do not now assume that there will never be any more war again.\r\nOn the contrary, we intend to take ample precautions to prevent its\r\nrenewal in any period we can foresee by effectively disarming the\r\nguilty nations while remaining suitably protected ourselves. The second\r\ndifference is this: That instead of trying to ruin German trade by\r\nall kinds of additional trade barriers and hindrances as was the mood\r\nof 1917, we have definitely adopted the view that it is not in the\r\ninterests of the world and of our two countries that any large nation\r\nshould be unprosperous, or shut off from means of making a decent\r\nliving for itself and its people by industry and enterprise. These\r\nare far-reaching changes of principle upon which all countries should\r\nponder.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Axis statement begins with the declaration that the day of small or\r\nweak nations is over, and no nation which cannot stand on its own feet\r\nmay be permitted to exist.\r\n\r\n“1. The strongest powers must have the greatest opportunities of\r\ndeveloping the world and disposing of such questions as spheres of\r\ninfluence, resources, and type of government. This is the law of nature\r\nand attempts to maintain the status quo of dominant powers who cannot\r\ncontinue to function through their strength but only through alliances\r\nmust break down.”\r\n\r\nThe reference here of course is to such colonial powers as France,\r\nHolland, Belgium, etc.\r\n\r\n“2. The nations called upon to settle world peace would be Germany,\r\nwith Italy as a junior partner, Japan, the British Empire, and the\r\nUnited States. Such a peace should include: a. Parity of naval strength\r\nof Britain and the United States on one hand, and the Axis powers on\r\nthe other hand, with a naval holiday after this is established.”\r\n\r\nThis is the key to the intention of the whole peace. Since the British\r\nand American navies are about double the strength of the Axis powers,\r\nso long as the British hold out we together could continue effectively\r\nto control the seas. If we were to consent to a naval agreement\r\nreducing our and the British strength to the strength of the Axis, and\r\nat the same time demilitarize our naval bases as demanded in other\r\nparagraphs, effective sea power would pass to the Axis.\r\n\r\n“b. Demilitarization of such strongholds as Gibraltar, the Eastern\r\nMediterranean, Malta, Aden, Red Sea, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well\r\nas all United States bases in the Pacific and any projects in the\r\nAleutian Islands reaching out toward Japan.”\r\n\r\nThis paragraph would complete the conquest of sea power by the Axis\r\nand would render defenseless all the British Empire’s Far Eastern\r\npossessions and our Philippines and Alaska.\r\n\r\n“c. Complete withdrawal of the British Navy from the Mediterranean and\r\njoint Anglo-Axis administration of the Suez Canal.”\r\n\r\nWithdrawal of the British Navy would give mastery of the Mediterranean\r\nto the Axis, which would automatically control the Suez Canal. To offer\r\n“joint Anglo-Axis administration of the Suez Canal” is a sop which only\r\nunderlines the grotesque nature of a Hitler-negotiated peace.\r\n\r\n“d. All North Africa from the Straits of Gibraltar to Somaliland to be\r\nplaced at the disposition of the Axis, though France may be permitted\r\nto retain colonies under certain conditions of co-administration.\r\nCertain British and African colonies to be placed under German and\r\nItalian control. South Africa would be required to have complete\r\nindependence and abolish trade preference tariffs.”\r\n\r\nThe last sentence means that South Africa should leave the British\r\nEmpire. The fleeting, condescending mention of the French who _may_\r\nbe permitted to share colonies is the only reference made to them. It\r\nought to be noted carefully by the men of Vichy who pretend at any rate\r\nto believe that Hitler would not rob them if they abased themselves\r\nsufficiently. For the United States, the significant thing here is that\r\nGermany would control the naval, air, and military bases of Africa\r\nincluding Dakar opposite Brazil.\r\n\r\n“e. Continental Europe to be organized into a corporate state under\r\nthe Reich with domestic autonomy for unit members whose economic and\r\npolitical cooperation would be based on Berlin.”\r\n\r\nThere for all to read is the future map of Europe. The name of Europe\r\nitself will scarcely be needed any more, save as a geographical term\r\nonce used to identify the continent now known as Great Germany. No more\r\nFrance, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland. All\r\nwill come under the Nazi yoke, even Spain and Portugal and the states\r\nwhich yielded without a struggle, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria. You\r\nask, but isn’t this the unification of Europe we have all been hoping\r\nfor? The answer is no, because what the world needed was a Europe\r\nvoluntarily united in a United States of Europe, or whatever else you\r\nwanted to call it, for the purpose of promoting the mutual prosperity,\r\nhealth, and happiness of all its members. Hitler Europe’s avowed object\r\nis to confiscate and exploit the resources of the conquered states\r\nand to employ their man power as slaves for the exclusive, perpetual\r\nbenefit of the “master race.” This is not a new Commonwealth of\r\nNations; it is the first step in the Nazis’ program for the systematic\r\ndegradation of the human race. The only parallel for it is in Aldous\r\nHuxley’s _Brave New World_. His robot human race was divided into Alpha\r\nmasters and various classes of slaves, down to the Epsilon automatons\r\nwho would correspond to Hitler’s Slavic serfs.\r\n\r\n“f. The United Kingdom to remain the heart of the British Empire with a\r\ngradual transfer of authority to Canada.”\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a covert bid for isolationist approval in the United\r\nStates, a hint that as the British Empire will not exist at all much\r\nlonger, the United States may profit by absorbing Canada and whatever\r\nother vestigial remnants of the Empire may be granted Canada as the\r\nresiduary legatee. This profit-taking by the United States has already\r\nbeen proposed by Lindbergh in his suggestion that we take over Canada.\r\n\r\n“g. The German sphere of influence may go as far as the Sea of Marmora\r\nunless that were handed over to the joint administration of Turkey and\r\nSoviet Russia. But Germany may demand participation in the oil wells of\r\nIraq and Iran.”\r\n\r\nThis paragraph has been rendered obsolete by the German invasion of\r\nRussia. Germany certainly hopes eventually to get all the oil of Iraq\r\nand Iran.\r\n\r\n“h. The United States’ sphere of influence would be Canada, Central and\r\nSouth America, Newfoundland, and Greenland with islands and regional\r\nwaters, but the United States would undertake not to form any hegemony\r\nover South America inimical to the Axis and would accord the fullest\r\nfreedom and equality of opportunity to Germany and her Allies in that\r\ncontinental brotherhood. No American naval bases would be west of\r\nHawaii, and that stronghold would be reduced in importance.”\r\n\r\nHow does it feel to an American to hear this sort of dictation? It is\r\ndignified treatment compared with what we would receive if we acceded.\r\nNever was a proverb more true than the old Russian one, based on the\r\nbitter experience of their vassalage to the Tartars. “A nation is never\r\ntoo poor to pay the first installment of tribute and never rich enough\r\nto pay the last.” We are asked to give up all our naval bases in the\r\nPacific west of Hawaii, but there is no hint of Japanese reciprocity.\r\nThe Japanese when the time came would move in and fortify the bases we\r\nhad dismantled.\r\n\r\n“i. In the Pacific the Netherlands Indies might be detached from the\r\nNetherlands and placed under an independent government with native\r\nparticipation, and British possessions would obtain increasing\r\nindependence. Throughout all these Pacific islands, Japanese advisors\r\nwould be admitted and entrusted with the duty of rationalizing forms\r\nof cooperation in the ‘co-prosperity sphere.’ French Indo-China would\r\nreceive independence on the same terms.”\r\n\r\nWe see now what this “independence” is. Just twelve weeks after the\r\npublication of these “peace terms” the Japanese took over Indo-China.\r\n\r\nThese peace terms are not even hypocritically polite. They simply\r\nassume the opposite “negotiators” are beaten, and that of course\r\nincludes the United States, as we may see from our prominent position\r\namong its stipulations. Lindbergh declares we would be beaten from the\r\nstart if we entered the war, and that a negotiated peace would be more\r\nacceptable than outright military defeat. But these terms, vouched for\r\nby the Imperial Japanese Foreign Office organ, show us that we would be\r\ntreated as a conquered nation if we negotiated a peace.\r\n\r\n“j. Australia would remain within the British Empire, but would\r\neliminate immigration bars and allow Japanese settlement on terms of\r\nequality.”\r\n\r\nThe exclusively Japanese interests would be safeguarded by Germany in\r\na negotiated peace only if Japan had earned it by following German\r\norders. Japan, however, may disappoint her senior partner.\r\n\r\nThe next to last paragraph reads ironically:\r\n\r\n“k. India would obtain self-government.”\r\n\r\nWe may be sure that if the Axis wins, India will not receive\r\nself-government. Both Germany and Japan want India. Somewhere in the\r\npath of this war appears the possibility of a clash between the Germans\r\nand the Japanese. Already Japan shows signs of being afraid that if\r\nGermany wins, Japan will suffer the same fate as Italy and Russia.\r\nJapan likewise shows signs of wanting to wait for better evidence that\r\nthe Allies are going to win. Stranger things have happened in this war\r\nthan that Japan should finally quit the Axis and go to war on the side\r\nof Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\nBut the most ironic paragraph of this peace offer is the last:\r\n\r\n“l. Religious and political liberty would be enjoined throughout the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nThat’s all. That completes the offer of negotiated peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why do they call it a negotiated peace?_\r\n\r\nA. It is not “negotiated.” It is a dictated peace; it represents a\r\ncomplete Hitler victory but that is the only kind of negotiated peace\r\nhe would consider until he is himself defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But is it possible that these are authentic, genuine terms of the\r\nAxis? It seems to me that the publication of such arrogant demands upon\r\nAmerica was an undiplomatic step, contrary to the interests of the\r\nAxis, since it would be bound to arouse our indignation._\r\n\r\nA. It was a “semi-official” publication of the Japanese Foreign Office\r\nat the very time when the then Foreign Minister Matsuoka advised\r\nAnthony Eden that Japan was ready to mediate a negotiated peace if\r\nshe were requested to do so. Its authentic character can hardly be\r\nquestioned. If it is arrogant it is because the Axis is arrogant, and\r\nconsiders that Britain is already beaten and that the United States\r\nwas beaten before she began to fight. As the _Japan Times Advertiser_\r\nput it: “These may be called victors’ terms but the Axis powers have\r\nachieved a dominant position permitting liberty of dictation.” These\r\nterms could not be worse if we had entered the war and lost it. They\r\nwould mean that from now on until perhaps centuries later when the\r\nNazis shall have become soft and self-indulgent and until some new,\r\nrougher race arose to oust them, the Germans would rule the earth. For\r\nof course if Britain or America were to be willing to accept such terms\r\nit would prove they really were beaten.\r\n\r\nDuring the period immediately after the signing of the negotiated\r\npeace which would be used by the Germans to consolidate and strengthen\r\ntheir military position, we should probably be allowed to retain our\r\nnominal sovereignty, although we should not be able to do anything\r\nin the realm of foreign politics or economics that was not permitted\r\nby Germany. During this period our Lindberghs would declaim that they\r\nhad been right after all since we had not been invaded and we still\r\nelected our own president and still sang “God Bless America,” and still\r\ncalled ourselves the land of the free and home of the brave; and the\r\nLindberghs would insist that the sacrifices we had made were far better\r\nthan to have fought a war. But soon we should find that Hitler’s idea\r\nof “equality” in South America meant complete Nazi monopoly. Soon we\r\nshould find we had lost all our world trade save that permitted us by\r\nthe Axis with the Axis on Axis terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Would the Nazi use of slave labor be an advantage? Can’t free\r\nAmerican labor always produce better and cheaper than slave labor?_\r\n\r\nA. That is one of our popular fallacies. We proclaim this doctrine at\r\nthe same time that we use tariffs to protect American industry from\r\nthe products of foreign workers who receive lower wages than American\r\nworkers. Japanese manufactured articles, the cheapest in the world\r\nbecause they are made by virtually slave labor, were able to flood our\r\nmarket in spite of our high tariffs. For ordinary mass production, for\r\nnearly every type of manufactured article save quality goods, slave\r\nlabor is more profitable than free labor. If it is not so efficient,\r\nit makes up for that by being so much cheaper. If Hitler were to get\r\nhis slave Europe organized, he could turn out products which would\r\nundersell anything we could make.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Wouldn’t he try to make us take his goods also?_\r\n\r\nA. He would. We are talking now of the alternative to our going to war\r\nand defeating Hitler. We are visualizing the situation as it would be\r\nafter Hitler had won, and had made all of those arrangements with the\r\nrest of the world which we have described, and was now in process of\r\nadjusting his Empire to the United States, or rather of adjusting the\r\nUnited States to his Empire. We are discussing now how we would have to\r\nbehave if we wished to continue to be at peace with Hitler. We would of\r\ncourse have to make some kind of trade agreement with him. What kind\r\nof trade agreement do you think Hitler would propose? We can suppose\r\nhe would offer us the same kind of agreement he has concluded with\r\nother states before they fell, or before they volunteered to become\r\nhis vassals--the sort of agreements he had with Jugoslavia, or Greece,\r\nand with Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria. These agreements provide\r\nthat German goods may enter at lower tariffs than the goods of other\r\ncountries or that tariffs on German goods are abolished altogether, and\r\nusually the country concerned must promise to take a minimum quantity\r\nof whatever articles Germany wishes to export. If we hoped to have\r\nany kind of trade agreement with the victorious Germans at all, it\r\nwould have to be one like this. We should probably have to consent to\r\nreceive German goods in such quantities and at such prices that our\r\nown industry would step by step be ruined. This would be the German\r\naim. They intend to make German industry not only the only industry in\r\nEurope, but the master of the manufacturing world. They intend to wreck\r\nany industry they cannot control.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But you don’t think we would put up with such treatment as that, do\r\nyou? It would be better to go to war, wouldn’t it?_\r\n\r\nA. By that time it might be too late to go to war. Now is the time\r\nto go to war. Now is the time to avoid those calamities we have just\r\ndiscussed. If we had done nothing to protect ourselves while we still\r\nhad the power to protect ourselves and still had strong allies\r\nfighting in the field, what use would there be to try to resist Hitler\r\nafter he had become master of the world outside America? We should then\r\nface the alternative of submission to Hitler or fighting an almost\r\nhopeless war.\r\n\r\nOur isolationists like the Quislings and the Darlans and Lavals\r\nabroad, are working themselves into the position of the French\r\ncollaborationists. That is, they are going so far out on the limb\r\nof isolation-appeasement that eventually they will not be able to\r\nwithdraw. Even today they refuse to admit their error. If the worst\r\ncame to the worst and we remained out of the war, and Hitler won, and\r\nall these things we are discussing came to pass, our isolationists\r\nwould be bound to continue to contend that they were right, and they\r\nwould have to advocate collaboration with Hitler, as indeed many of\r\nthem do now. We can see what collaboration means in France. Ninety-five\r\nper cent of the French people are against it, and five per cent who\r\nadvocate and practice it are now considered traitors. This would be\r\nthe history of our isolationists also. When the alternative, war or\r\nsurrender, was offered, their answer would be that war was hopeless,\r\nand the only sensible thing to do would be to collaborate with Hitler.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But isn’t there another way out for us? Couldn’t we simply give\r\nup our foreign trade? In 1939 it amounted to only about six billion\r\ndollars. What is that compared with the monstrous expense of war? It\r\nis only one-seventh of the amount we have already agreed to spend for\r\ndefense. It is only one-tenth of our national income._\r\n\r\nA. Even if our total foreign trade represented only one-tenth of our\r\ntotal business activity, that would make it vitally important, for\r\nas you know, in an economy such as ours, ten per cent means all the\r\ndifference between failure and success. Hitler said of Germany, “we\r\nmust export or die.” Our case is not that desperate, but it would be\r\nfair to say we must export or suffer a lower standard of living and\r\nincreased unemployment. Witness the effect on this country of our\r\nwar export business which has revitalized the entire economic system\r\nand practically wiped out unemployment. Before long the last of our\r\nunemployed ought to be at work, as they have all found jobs in England.\r\nOf course if we wished to crawl into a completely abject isolation,\r\nwe could give up our foreign trade, recall our ships from the seven\r\nseas, seal our ports, and retire into a kind of hillbilly life, eating\r\nour corn bread and sowbelly, drinking our home-brew, and supporting a\r\npermanent mass of millions of unemployed.\r\n\r\nEven if we attempted such a thing we would not be permitted to\r\ncontinue to live peacefully behind our imagined walls. The world wants\r\nwhat we can produce. Nazi Germany wants it. If we were to carry the\r\nisolationist argument to its final absurdity and really try to set up\r\na complete autarchy and live within the continental borders of the\r\nUnited States, the Nazis would never let us do so. From within and\r\nfrom without the Nazis would attack us. Our own Nazis would labor to\r\nbring us into Hitler’s New Order, while the German Nazis would assume\r\nthe role of our own Commodore Perry and as he broke open the Japanese\r\nclosed door in 1854 the Nazis would smash the locks of American\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nWe are discussing what would be a comparatively short period of time,\r\nthe period between the end of the war with a Hitler-negotiated peace\r\nand the moment when he felt himself strong enough to resume the war,\r\nthis time to conquer all that was left unconquered at the first truce.\r\nAs soon as he had his machine in order and perceived that his strength\r\nhad risen relative to ours to such a point that he considered victory\r\ncertain, he, with Japan, would attack Britain, then America. If we\r\nhad agreed to any such negotiated peace such as the one we have been\r\ndiscussing, we would be lost. Britain and America have held out so\r\nfar because despite the importance of air power, sea power is still\r\nparamount and we have had sea power. We would not have it after a\r\nnegotiated peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But aren’t these terms of a negotiated peace somewhat dated now\r\nsince the German attack on Russia? Hasn’t the unexpectedly strong\r\nRussian resistance diminished Hitler’s feeling that he can already\r\ndictate as a victor?_\r\n\r\nA. No doubt Hitler’s arrogance has been reduced at least a little\r\nsince the “scum of the earth” checked his warriors, but the Russian\r\nsetback to Hitler has been only that, and it has not yet changed his\r\nlong-range plans. He still aspires to conquer the world and he still\r\nbelieves he can do it, and any negotiated peace he may offer, whether\r\nit is the one whose terms we have just discussed, or some other terms\r\nmore fitted to the moment, will be calculated to give the Germans a\r\nrespite in preparation for resumption of the war. That, after all, is\r\nthe important point to remember. Specific terms are at this juncture\r\nunimportant. It is only essential to remember that _any_ negotiated\r\npeace with Hitler would not be a peace at all, but only a truce to\r\nwhich Hitler would never agree unless he believed he would thereby be\r\nstrengthened for renewal of the war. We can never emphasize too much\r\nthat there is no such thing as a peace with Hitler; there is no such\r\nthing as a peaceful Hitler; Hitler will either conquer or be conquered.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But if Britain and the United States had agreed to the sort of\r\nnegotiated peace offered through Tokyo, they would have surrendered\r\npractically everything, so why should Hitler go to the trouble of\r\nattacking us?_\r\n\r\nA. Because Hitler does not want “practically” everything; he wants\r\nabsolutely everything. Also Hitler cannot stop making war; it will\r\ntake a greater Nazi than he to convert the German war machine to\r\ngarrison duties and the Nazi hordes to peaceful production.\r\n\r\nNo conqueror ever stops conquering until he is stopped by some outside\r\nforce. Alexander was just getting into his stride and longing for\r\nmore worlds to conquer when he died of a fever after drinking too\r\nmuch. Hitler will never be stopped that way. Caesar was stopped by\r\nthe assassin’s dagger. That could stop Hitler but it would be foolish\r\nto depend upon it. Napoleon was stopped at Waterloo by superior\r\nforce. That we hope will be Hitler’s end. But never did a conqueror\r\nstop as our Lindberghs believe Hitler would stop, of his own accord,\r\nsatisfied with what he had won. Far more true is the analysis by my old\r\nfriend Douglas Miller, who during his fifteen years as United States\r\nCommercial Attaché in Berlin was the constant source of knowledge about\r\nthe Nazis for all of us American newspapermen, and who now has written\r\nthe wisest book about the Nazis to appear from the pen of an American,\r\n_You Can’t Do Business with Hitler_.\r\n\r\nMiller puts the matter with hair-fine accuracy thus: “The essential\r\nsterility of the Fascist system is one explanation of its\r\naggressiveness. The totalitarians are a group of bandits who have\r\nlearned no useful trade or occupation but are well armed and have no\r\nscruples about attacking their neighbors. Germany has, under Hitler,\r\nthrown away her possibilities of peaceful trade and understanding with\r\nall the world and has no option but to go forward in the campaign of\r\naggression. She must not, in Hitler’s words, ‘export or die’; she must\r\nfight or die. Under these circumstances it is completely useless to\r\nawait any peaceful settlement of Europe’s troubles. The Nazis are not\r\norganized for peace. They are not prepared for it. They would not know\r\nwhat to do with it.”\r\n\r\nBut beyond these reasons for attacking Britain and America even after\r\nthey had accepted such humiliating, emasculating terms as those\r\nwe have sketched, Hitler would have the same reason to attack the\r\nAnglo-American combination that he had to attack Russia. He attacked\r\nRussia partly to remove the remote possibility of a Russian attack\r\nwhile he was attempting to invade England, but he attacked Russia also\r\nto get complete control over the Russian resources which Stalin was\r\ndoling out to him too slowly and meagerly. So it would be with the\r\nresources of the rump British Empire and of the United States. Hitler\r\nwould not be satisfied with the necessity for negotiating or trading\r\nwith Anglo-America. He would demand the power to dictate. So in the\r\nlong run Hitler by achieving such a negotiated peace as is advocated by\r\nWheeler, Nye, Lindbergh, and others, would have conquered America.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What kind of a peace would we make if we win the war?_\r\n\r\nA. That is more difficult to forecast than to sketch the outlines of\r\na Hitler world. His peace is engraved in his past and blueprinted in\r\nhis program. We know what it is like, a simple pattern of masters and\r\nslaves. All we can say positively about our postwar world is that\r\nthe British and Americans and the populations of Hitler’s conquered\r\nterritory, wish it to be a world in which there shall be no masters or\r\nslaves; we want justice for everybody, and all the liberty possible,\r\nand we want to get rid of fear and want. We know we will not be able to\r\nget all this but the difference between us and Hitler is that Hitler\r\ndoes not even want such a world. If he could have such a world by\r\nmerely asking for it, he would prefer to battle for his sort of world,\r\nbecause violent struggle and the infliction of pain upon others is an\r\nessential part of the satisfactions of the Nazis.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What chance has Communism in a defeated Germany?_\r\n\r\nA. If Hitler is defeated it is possible that the Communists will be\r\nthe strongest party or political group of any kind in Germany. When he\r\ncame to power Hitler dissolved all parties, and only the Communists\r\ncontinued a militant, underground organization. The bourgeois,\r\ndemocratic parties completely disappeared, and it is hard to imagine\r\ntheir revival. It is easy to imagine the revival of the Communist\r\nParty. It won six million votes at the last honest election before\r\nHitler seized the government. A great many Germans who voted Communist\r\nentered the Nazi Party or Nazi organizations such as the SA Brownshirts\r\nand the SS Elite Guards. This confirmed the observation that between\r\nNazism and Communism as systems there existed more similarity than\r\ndifference. It would be easy for those who had been Communists before\r\nHitler came to power to return to the Communist cause after Hitler\r\nfell. A Communist program promising immediate peace for the German\r\npeople and vengeance on the Nazi leaders would appeal more and more to\r\nthe masses of German workingmen as the war lengthens and shows no signs\r\nof ending. We should not forget that the Soviet government, or rather\r\nJoseph Stalin, unless he capitulates, will have something to say when\r\nthe time comes to think about the kind of government Germany is to have.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Q. Well then, it seems to me that the first problem of our Peace\r\nConference will be what to do with the Germans._\r\n\r\nA. It is likely that an even more urgent problem, demanding the first\r\nattention of the Peace Conference, will be how to keep millions of\r\npeople in Europe from starving to death; how to restore the railroad\r\nlines and other means of transportation; and how to prevent sheer\r\nanarchy, or gutter-communism from seizing the continent. In the period\r\nimmediately after the Nazis collapse--and be sure of one thing, and\r\nthat is that when Hitler cracks he and his regime will crack all at\r\nonce in one frightful cataclysmic smash beside which the German\r\nsurrender in the last war will look like a fight to the finish--the\r\nlikelihood is that throughout Europe law and order will disappear for\r\na time at least until Allied troops arrive. For years the only law and\r\norder will have been the German troops and Gestapo. The former leading\r\ncitizens of the occupied territories, Norwegian, Dutch, Czech, French,\r\netc., will all have been either killed, exiled, or demoralized. There\r\nwill be no firm group of strong men left to restore order anywhere in\r\nEurope. In Germany itself the disorder will reach its height as the\r\nNazi masters flee and the German people take vengeance upon them. There\r\nwill be throughout the continent a universal struggle, as of beasts,\r\nfor the scanty food left. It is possible that more lives will be lost\r\nin the immediate postwar period than in the war itself. Therefore I say\r\nthe most urgent problem before the Peace Conference will be how to give\r\nEurope the physical means and the police force to keep it alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _That is such a horrible picture that in spite of myself I must ask\r\nif it would not be better to let Hitler have his way?_\r\n\r\nA. It is natural for us to recoil from such horrors. But let us\r\nremember that whereas the agony of Europe and of the world, brought\r\nabout by the struggle to expel Hitler from power, will be severe but\r\nbrief, the degradation of all mankind which would result from the\r\nfailure to expel Hitler, would last perhaps for generations, certainly\r\nfar beyond the length of time it would take to restore order in a\r\nEurope purged of the Nazis. What did it cost to achieve liberty in the\r\nfirst place? Think of all the wars it has taken to enable each of us\r\nto stand up and say, “I am the equal of any man on earth.” If we are\r\nnot able to face the prospect of fighting and suffering and starving\r\nand dying for liberty and if we are not confident enough in the\r\nrighteousness of our cause to demand, not request but demand, that our\r\nfellow citizens do likewise, then we do not deserve liberty, we deserve\r\nour place with the rest of Hitler’s slaves. Better that half the\r\ngeneration of men alive today go down to early death than that Hitler\r\nshould enslave all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Very well, I agree, but isn’t it understandable that we, away over\r\nhere in America, should shrink from such a future?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, but unless we learn not to shrink we shall surely die as\r\na nation. How many Americans today understand and fully realize,\r\nemotionally as well as intellectually, that in order to retain our\r\nliberty and our national independence and make secure the lives of our\r\nchildren, we have to face now the prospect of years of war, hardship,\r\nand the loss of many American lives, and the wounding and maiming of\r\nmany more? Certainly it is brutal, not my words, but the reality. It\r\nis unworthy of a nation of 130,000,000 for its leaders to suggest that\r\nall will be well if only we pass this piece of legislation or take that\r\nstand or appropriate another trillion dollars. Nothing will save this\r\ncountry except our own blood and our own tears. And please do not go\r\naway and say that I “blithely” recommended blood and tears. I bitterly\r\ndeclare there is no alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _After we have been able, as we hope, to install temporary law and\r\norder and emergency rations throughout the continent, isn’t the problem\r\nof Germany next on the agenda of the Peace Conference?_\r\n\r\nA. It must be. There is a still larger, the largest problem, that of\r\ntrying to reorganize the world into a scheme for living without war,\r\nfor some kind of Federated Humanity, but for us in the Western World\r\nnothing can be done until we discover what to do with Germany. Here is\r\na nation of 80,000,000 whose leaders, clamoring for “living space,”\r\nshamelessly declare they intend to multiply into 250,000,000 within\r\na century and use their superior force to exterminate or enslave\r\neverybody else. Here is a nation which thrice in the memory of living\r\nman, in 1870, 1914, and 1939 has launched its war machine against its\r\nneighbors, taken the lives of millions, and now has disrupted the\r\ncivilization of the entire world. Here is a nation, distinguished in\r\nits past history by precious contributions to the arts and sciences,\r\nwhich today, led by the lust for conquest, has discarded Christ, truth,\r\njustice, and has debased a whole generation of its youth to the moral\r\nand ethical level of savages.\r\n\r\nHere is a nation which is one of the most talented on earth in\r\nthe theory and practice of the natural sciences, capable of world\r\nleadership in bending nature to the peaceful services of mankind, to\r\nthe amelioration of suffering and the increase of prosperity, and what\r\ndoes this nation do? It devotes all its talents to the cultivation of\r\nthe science of warfare, and becomes adept beyond all other nations\r\nin the arts of destruction. Why? What is behind all this evil? Never\r\nin modern history has any nation in the Western World displayed such\r\nincorrigible tendencies to raid, rob, seize, invade, plunder, conquer,\r\nand torture. Torture! For the deepest blot upon Nazi Germany is its\r\ndark love of torture, its base delight in pain endured by others, its\r\ncruel concentration camps. Never in any quarter of the globe at any\r\ntime in mankind’s history has any nation revealed so determined a will\r\nand clever a method to exploit permanently as slaves the unfortunate\r\nvictims of its martial skill. The problem then is, how to restrain\r\nGermany, or how to reform Germany, how, if possible, to bring her into\r\nour world family.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why not say the problem is how to destroy her or at least paralyze\r\nher?_\r\n\r\nA. For several reasons. First, because it is impracticable to destroy\r\n80,000,000 persons even if we were Nazi enough to wish to do so. You\r\ncan be sure that if Hitler as head of a non-German Alliance were faced\r\nwith the German problem he would solve it precisely that way, by\r\nextermination of the Germans. But we are not Nazis, and even suppose\r\nsome on our side were to advocate destruction of the Germans by mass\r\nemasculation, you can be sure that millions of Americans and Britons\r\nwould arise and cry out in defense of the poor German people, misguided\r\nvictims, innocent souls. Politically and morally this solution is out\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is there no way we could render Germany impotent to do harm, no way\r\nwe could deprive her of the possibility of attacking the world again?_\r\n\r\nA. There are two ways: military occupation or deindustrialization\r\nof the Reich. It is plain that if Germany is allowed the least\r\nopportunity, she would rearm and attack with the same swift ferocity\r\nshe has just displayed. There must be physical restraint to keep her\r\nfrom doing so. Military occupation is the obvious, traditional method,\r\nbut it has serious drawbacks. It is expensive and tiring. Nevertheless\r\nif the Nazis are defeated in this war, it will be imperative to\r\noccupy Germany far more thoroughly than after the last war, if only\r\nto preserve order. There are some advocates of deliberately allowing\r\nGermany a period of disorder during which it could be hoped that the\r\nGermans would themselves exterminate a great number of Nazis. This\r\nwould only render more formidable the task which already appears\r\nstaggeringly difficult, to re-establish a state of law in the Reich,\r\nwhere since 1933, law as we know it, has been abolished. Whatever\r\npermanent system of controlling Germany is eventually adopted, the\r\nfirst step will have to be military occupation. Theoretically, military\r\noccupation could be continued indefinitely. Actually it never is\r\ncontinued long, because the occupying troops and their people at\r\nhome grow tired of it. Even the French, who directly after the war\r\nwere fanatically determined to secure their frontier by taking the\r\nRhineland, and who did get in the Treaty of Versailles permission to\r\noccupy the Rhineland for fifteen years, even these prudent and wary\r\nFrench grew so tired of it that they evacuated the Rhineland three\r\nyears ahead of time, in June 1930.\r\n\r\nSix years later the Nazis moved in and constructed the Siegfried\r\nline along the very positions which had been occupied by the French\r\ntroops. I know there were other reasons for the French to give up the\r\nRhineland. The British had pressed them to appease the Germans. The\r\nGermans had agreed in the Young Plan to a new system of reparations and\r\nas reward received the Rhineland ahead of schedule. But the moment the\r\nlast French troops left Germany the period of fulfillment of the war\r\ntreaties came to an end, and Germany began the period of repudiation\r\nand revision which ended in this war and for France in her present\r\nnational humiliation. Looking backward one can see that nothing should\r\nhave moved the French to leave the Rhineland. That they did so is a\r\nclassic example of how people grow so careless, lazy, forgetful and\r\npeace-minded that they become insensible to a threat to their very\r\nlives. That is the state of mind of America today.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You mentioned a second possibility for physically retraining\r\nGermany and you used the word deindustrialization. What does that mean?_\r\n\r\nA. It is an ugly word but I know no other to describe the process of\r\ntaking away a country’s factories and leaving it without industry.\r\nThat of course would also leave it without the means of making war.\r\nThis is what Germany plans to do to the rest of Europe, as we have\r\nseen. The civilized world would have every right to impose the same\r\ntreatment on the inventor of the scheme. Briefly the plan would be to\r\noccupy Germany militarily; to disarm her rigorously; to dismantle all\r\nher factories capable of making instruments of war; to prohibit the\r\nimport into Germany of raw materials which could be used for making\r\nsuch instruments; to confiscate and turn over to Allied ownership and\r\noperation all German mines producing iron or other metals; and to\r\nappoint a permanent Inter-allied Control Commission to supervise these\r\nrestrictions. It would be necessary to forbid all manufacture or use of\r\nairplanes by Germans in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How does this proposal fit in with the fourth paragraph of the\r\neight-point Atlantic Charter which reads, “They will endeavor, with due\r\nrespect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by\r\nall states, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal\r\nterms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are\r\nneeded for their economic prosperity.”_\r\n\r\nA. There is the difficulty. Adherence to this paragraph would prevent\r\nany such solution as deindustrialization, because there could be no\r\neconomic prosperity for a deindustrialized Germany. The first effect\r\nof it would be a widespread return to the land, as Germans would have\r\nno manufactured articles for export, and hence nothing with which to\r\nbuy abroad, and hence would be forced to grow all their own food. The\r\npopulation would decline, young folks would emigrate if any country\r\nwould take them, and in general it would be a very unhappy period for\r\nthe Herrenvolk. Apparently Roosevelt and Churchill have rejected this\r\nsolution in favor of simple old-fashioned military occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _They said nothing in their statement about militarily occupying\r\nGermany._\r\n\r\nA. No, but they said plainly they intended to disarm the aggressor\r\nnations. You do not suppose you could disarm Germany without occupying\r\nher, do you? It ought to be possible to devise something more effective\r\nand novel than the thousand-year-old method of sending in troops. One\r\nsuggestion is that all German officers (there may be around 500,000\r\nof them) should be exiled to an island under perpetual guard where\r\nthey could make their own living and end their lives in contemplation\r\nof their sins. The German Army would be abolished entirely; not as in\r\n1919 reduced to 100,000 men who were to become the cadre of the present\r\nseven-million-man machine. For a decade or more the Allies would\r\nhave to accept the responsibility of policing Germany. All military\r\nmanuals and textbooks would be destroyed. Aviation of all kinds and the\r\nbuilding of airplanes would likewise be forbidden. These measures would\r\nbe for the purpose of demilitarizing the population, and it is possible\r\nthat, deprived of military instructors or any means of military\r\ninstruction, the plan might work, as least for a time.\r\n\r\nIn any plan dealing with postwar Germany it is important to avoid\r\nvindictiveness. Nothing should be done as a punishment of Germany’s\r\ncrimes in the past; everything should be done to restrain her from\r\ncrime in the future. How much better it would have been if there had\r\nbeen no reparations imposed upon Germany after the last war, but the\r\nAllies had kept their Military Control Commission permanently in\r\nGermany while Allied troops permanently occupied the Rhineland. There\r\nis no use, however, in hoping for any such _permanent_ resolution on\r\nour part. We have only one hope of being able to restrain Germany for\r\nany considerable period, by the humane means which are the only ones\r\nopen to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What hope have we of being able to restrain Germany?_\r\n\r\nA. It is the hope that while we occupy Germany with our troops, say\r\nfor the next thirty or forty years, a new generation of Germans would\r\ngrow up which would forego its desire to conquer the world, forget\r\nthat it was a Herrenvolk, and would gradually learn the habits of\r\ncivilization. Meanwhile we would try to develop a World Federation or\r\nLeague of Nations under Anglo-American leadership to such a point of\r\neffectiveness that we could afford to allow Germany to become a member\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But do you suppose our people or the British would put up with the\r\ntrouble and expense of occupying Germany militarily for thirty or forty\r\nyears? Wouldn’t there be an outcry on behalf of the Germans?_\r\n\r\nA. Many of our people would probably try to sabotage any realistic\r\nhandling of the Germans. After the last war and at the beginning of\r\nthis one you could hear many Americans remarking: “How could you expect\r\nthe Germans or any upstanding, self-respecting people to tolerate being\r\ntreated unequally, to put up with being disarmed while their neighbors\r\nwere armed?” These remarks disclosed misapprehension of the German\r\nmind which will surely be duplicated at the end of this war by similar\r\npersons. That will not matter so much since the British will have a\r\ngreat deal to say about how the Germans are to be restrained, and this\r\ntime the British will not be as shortsighted as they were after the\r\nlast war.\r\n\r\nYou may remember that the French in 1919 wanted to occupy permanently\r\nvarious strategic points in Germany, including the Rhineland, but the\r\nBritish said no. They had two principal reasons for not consenting to\r\nproper restraint of the Germans and both reasons were, as we can see\r\nfrom our perspective of today, completely invalid. First, they did not\r\nwant France to become too strong; they believed they had to maintain a\r\nbalance of power with Germany, apparently leaving out of account the\r\nenormous, patent facts that there were 80,000,000 Germans to 40,000,000\r\nFrenchmen, that the French birth rate was nearing the point of racial\r\nsuicide, that Frenchmen were concerned not at all with expansion but\r\nonly to keep what they had in their beloved “security.” Second, the\r\nBritish people had failed during the war to suffer any of the pain and\r\ntribulation the Germans had visited upon the French, who had seen their\r\ntowns and villages destroyed, their families blown to bits by German\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nToday when the British sit down to a Peace Table they will be a\r\ndifferent people. In Britain today are upward of 44,000,000 persons who\r\nhave been under bombardment for two years and have suffered a strain\r\nupon their courage such as has no parallel. They have witnessed the\r\nmutilation of their dear ones, the destruction of their monuments. They\r\nhave heard the menace from their enemy that he intended to destroy\r\nEngland as Carthage was destroyed. Is it likely that when the British\r\nsit down victorious in a Peace Conference they will shrink from the\r\napplication of methods, no matter how severe, to prevent the recurrence\r\nof this horror? We shall not earn the right to speak at all at the\r\nPeace Conference until we have borne our share of the heat of the day.\r\nI hope we shall not try to exercise our influence to obstruct whatever\r\nsolutions may seem appropriate at the end of years of war, to solve\r\nthis essentially insoluble problem of the Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why do you call the German problem insoluble?_\r\n\r\nA. Because no matter what we do, short of destroying the Germans, which\r\nwe have agreed is impossible, the Germans are likely to break out again\r\non the warpath some time. Let us assume that we take the view that\r\nthe Versailles treaty was too harsh, and this time we will avoid all\r\nthe mistakes of harshness. We grant Germany a peace treaty which not\r\nonly takes nothing from her, but allows her to retain a considerable\r\nquantity of the territorial spoils she has accumulated by violence. We\r\nagree to let her retain all the territory inhabited for the most part\r\nby German-speaking people. Thus she is allowed to keep Western Poland\r\nwhence she has so brutally expelled the native Polish population. She\r\nis allowed to keep the German Sudetenland, formerly Czechoslovakian,\r\nand until the men of Munich gave it to Hitler, never before a part of\r\nGermany. She is allowed to keep Belgian Eupen Malmedy; and even any\r\npart of Lorraine which may desire to opt for Germany. She is allowed to\r\nkeep Austria. In short, Germany is allowed to keep all her 80,000,000\r\nGermans together. More than that, in order to “right every wrong,”\r\nGermany is given back her old colonies, all of them. Thus there is no\r\nthought of dividing the country. There are of course no reparations.\r\nThere are no punitive measures of any kind. Germany is invited to join\r\nthe new World Federation as soon as it has been formed. Certainly\r\nthis sort of treatment ought to mollify any people. This ought to be\r\na perfect peace. But wait, there is a crucial point. Shall Germany be\r\nallowed now, at once, to bear arms again? Or ever again? And how many\r\narms? What kind?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Haven’t Churchill and Roosevelt already declared the aggressors\r\nwould be disarmed?_\r\n\r\nA. Very well, the victors will insist that Germany is to have no\r\narms at least for a period of years. Do you think that then the\r\nGermans, even with a treaty such as we have sketched, granting every\r\nconceivable amelioration, would be satisfied? No. If we restricted\r\ntheir armed forces in any degree, for example, by depriving them of\r\noffensive weapons, of tanks and bombing planes, you can be sure that\r\nthe complaint of the Germans would be as great as though they had been\r\nstripped of half their population, the Reich divided into a score of\r\npuppet states, and their cities occupied by divisions of Senegalese.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Aren’t the Germans merely demanding absolute, uncompromising\r\nequality?_\r\n\r\nA. They always demand absolute, uncompromising superiority. Look back\r\non Hitler’s reign. He had several chances to stop this side of war,\r\nafter having gained for his people not mere equality with his greatest\r\nrival, France, and not mere equality with the political and military\r\nforces of all his neighbors put together, but with real superiority in\r\narms and in political power over all Europe. Look at the chances he\r\nhad to stop short of war and build in peace, and perhaps go down as\r\na greater man than he will appear after this bloody debacle is over.\r\nHe could have stopped after he got the Sudetenland, and had finally\r\nunited nearly all of his 80,000,000 Germans. He could have stopped\r\nafter he took Austria; after he occupied the Rhineland; after he got\r\nthe Saar back into Germany. The taking of the Sudetenland would have\r\nbeen a place to stop at the pinnacle. Suppose he had done that, and\r\nhad used his power and talent to transfer his war machine into a\r\npeace machine, and had used his mighty prestige to bring Europe into\r\na new economic order. Germany had attained practical “equality” with\r\nFrance by 1936 when Hitler’s troops entered the Rhineland, and they\r\nhad “equality” with all the rest of Europe put together--as Hitler has\r\nnow so disastrously proved--by 1938 when they got the Sudetenland. So\r\nthe point is that the Germans never wanted equality, will never be\r\nsatisfied with equality, but will always demand to be what they believe\r\nthemselves to be, namely, the _master_ race.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Aren’t you confusing the Germans with Hitler and the Nazis?_\r\n\r\nA. No, the Germans have done that themselves. By their so-called\r\nplebiscites which document their uniformly spineless behavior since\r\nHitler came to power, they have identified themselves with him and\r\npermitted him uncontradicted to define himself as Deutschland.\r\n\r\nThere is just a chance that a combination of generosity and firmness\r\nmay impress a minority of Germans which may grow and eventually bring\r\nthe whole nation into our hoped-for World Federation. If, on the\r\ncontrary, the Germans secretly arm, and prepare another ambush for\r\ncivilization, our only hope is to find it out in time. We should have\r\nno hope at all if our sobbing societies succeeded in inducing the\r\nPeace Conference to give the Germans equality in arms. Let us remember\r\nthat if we were all to disarm, including Germany, it would be just as\r\ndisadvantageous for us as if we remained armed and allowed Germany\r\nto keep equal arms. For at any stage of armament or disarmament the\r\nGermans are superior to almost any combination of their opponents.\r\nGermany is not just another nation. It is a nation, not exceptionally\r\nnumerous, but so highly talented in the mechanics, chemistry, and\r\nphysics of warfare and so professionally skilled in the staff work\r\nof war, and so obediently brave in the practice of battle, that its\r\nmilitary power is greater than that of any other single nation on\r\nearth, with no exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What are we going to do with all the former nations of Europe,\r\nespecially the fifteen or so which were conquered? Are we going to\r\nreconstitute them all as they were?_\r\n\r\nA. We shall try to reconstitute all those which are capable of\r\nmaintaining a national life, but how can one foresee the fate of\r\nsuch unfortunate little states as Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania?\r\nThe Soviet government, through its ambassador to London, Mr. Maisky,\r\nnow declares that it approves the Atlantic Charter’s Eight Points,\r\nincluding the right of self-determination of all nations. This has been\r\nhailed as a great step forward; but I should prefer to wait to see the\r\nRed Army evacuate voluntarily any territory it may hold at the end of\r\nthis war.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Soviet government toward the rights of small\r\nnations is brilliantly illustrated by Stalin’s treatment of the Baltic\r\nStates. First, he asked Britain and France for them to be handed him\r\non a platter, as roast chicken. Having been refused, he waited until\r\nthe war began, then forcibly occupied the three little states, which\r\nwere among the more attractive and in many ways more admirable little\r\ncountries in Europe. We have almost completely overlooked the grisly\r\nfate of the middle-class population of the Baltic states--virtually\r\nexterminated by Stalin’s gunmen in one of those side shows of horror\r\nwhich only the great war could obscure. The Baltic population is\r\nsuffering an epic of agony. After Stalin’s G.P.U. had killed or exiled\r\nall the professional and business people and all those suspected\r\nof being Nazi sympathizers, and then after war had swept the three\r\ncountries, the Germans and the Gestapo moved in and killed all the\r\nCommunist and other labor leaders and anti-Nazis. Now that Stalin has\r\nbeen driven out of the Baltic states, and they are occupied by the\r\nNazis, the Soviet policy is ceremoniously announced to be in favor of\r\nrestoration of full national independence to all states.\r\n\r\nThat must ring bitterly in the ears of the pitiful remnant of the\r\npopulation of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Is there enough of them\r\nleft to make it possible to resuscitate their nations? The experience\r\nof these countries shows how difficult it will be in our postwar\r\nsettlement to give national independence to small states and at the\r\nsame time allow them the possibility of national security. Many a\r\nsmall state will have to choose between the one or the other. If it\r\nstands alone, it may be devoured by a larger neighbor. If it enters a\r\nlarger unit, it will have to sacrifice some of its sovereignty. All\r\nthis points to the necessity of making the larger unit big enough to\r\ncomprise all nations.\r\n\r\nWhatever we do, the Soviet Union will present us with almost as many\r\nproblems as Germany. How can Britain and the United States confidently\r\noutline specific war aims as long as we do not know what the position\r\nof the Soviet Union will be at the end of this war? And if the Soviet\r\nUnion survives in her present form and temper, and has not defected\r\nfrom the war, how is she to fit into our world peace organization?\r\nThere are in it only two durable points of reference: the United States\r\nand Great Britain, and one great hope of success for the organization\r\nof peace, the firm friendship of the two countries, braced by their\r\ncontrol of the seas. Our only chance of realizing such a peace is\r\nby cherishing between ourselves a mutual trust which will override\r\nour selfish ambitions, for there are many points and places on the\r\nglobe where our material interests conflict. We cannot maintain this\r\nrelationship until we Americans begin to carry our full share of the\r\nburden of the war and the British in turn make us feel we are welcome\r\nto the comradeship as well as the responsibilities of the war and the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do the British want such a Pax Anglo-Americana which would divide\r\ntheir victory with us?_\r\n\r\nA. Let us not be sentimental about the British in spite of our\r\npartnership and friendship with them. The British would like nothing on\r\nearth so much as to be able to win this war without the United States’\r\nhelp. They would dearly love to win alone and enjoy the fruits of\r\nvictory alone. But they know now they cannot win alone. They know they\r\ncannot beat the Germans without our full, shooting participation in the\r\nwar. And so they are resigned to accepting our companionship in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _“Resigned to accepting our companionship in battle”? Is that the\r\nway the British feel? Well, then, I for my part...._\r\n\r\nA. Yes, I know what you are going to say: that you for your part would\r\njust as soon not help the British if that’s the way they feel about it.\r\nHow many Americans there are left who still think in terms of “helping\r\nthe British”! Cannot we finally understand that we are helping first\r\nof all ourselves, and that it would make no difference to us if the\r\nBritish were not human beings at all, but a race of perspicacious,\r\npugnacious penguins?\r\n\r\nSo long as these penguins are fighting off our common enemy who would\r\nattack us if the penguins fell, is it not just good sense to throw our\r\nwhole combat aid to the penguins, no matter what the penguins may think\r\nof us? If the British were to have a mental breakdown and declare they\r\ndisliked us so thoroughly that they would accept no more help from\r\nus of any kind and would rather be beaten by the Nazis than win with\r\nAmerican help, we should be compelled from our own vital self-interest\r\nto beg to be allowed to help them and then we should have to urge and\r\neven threaten until reluctantly the British made room for us in the\r\nbattle line. It is good luck that the British are people who would be\r\nworth saving even if thereby we were not going to save ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Will you recapitulate how you visualize the organization of peace?_\r\n\r\nA. First, a Pax Anglo-Americana, based on our naval control of the\r\nworld. This may take one of several forms, including Union Now,\r\nClarence Streit’s thoughtful plan for amalgamating the democracies. Its\r\nimmediate purpose would be to unite the coercive power of the nations\r\nof good will to restrain those of ill will until time and repentance\r\nhad made it possible to bring them into our second organization.\r\nThis World Federation of some kind might be a resuscitated League of\r\nNations, or it might have another name or form. All we know positively\r\nis that unless we organize for peace, we shall have war again; and we\r\nknow now that the nations of good will on earth are not strong enough\r\nwithout the United States to impose peace on the world. We know that if\r\nwe stay out of the peace we shall surely be drawn into the succeeding\r\nwar. Perhaps by the end of this present struggle we shall have learned\r\nour lesson and will never again attempt to withdraw into an illusory\r\nisolation which must always bring us into the very war it tried to\r\navoid. Perhaps for the first time in our history we will with open\r\neyes and clear plan enter the strength of the United States into the\r\norganization of peace with the same zeal we use to make war. If we do,\r\nwho knows but that the peace established after this war could endure\r\nfor longer than we even dare to guess at this melancholy moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is it a fact that because of the war England is becoming Socialist\r\nand will come out of the war with a government and social system just\r\nas repugnant to us as the Nazis’?_\r\n\r\nA. It is true that the government and social system of England have\r\nbecome Socialist but in the Christian and democratic sense of the\r\nword. British society has become a Christian collective. If they could\r\nmaintain after the war as ideal a spirit of cooperation and love of\r\ntheir neighbors as they have today under fire, we might call it the\r\nfirst step toward the millennium. Far from being a government and\r\nsocial system we disapproved, they would be worthy of our emulation. To\r\ncompare such a system of voluntary, democratic, unselfish devotion to\r\nthe common good as exists today in wartime England with the Nazi regime\r\nis to compare good with evil. Beaten by the blows of war the British\r\npeople have attained in a period of months a degree of social progress\r\nthey would not have reached in decades otherwise.\r\n\r\nBritain was forced to adopt a system of wartime socialism, if you want\r\nto call it that, because that form of socialism under the inspiration\r\nof life-and-death battle can produce so much more than uncontrolled\r\ncapitalism. Production is the materialist index of the value of any\r\neconomic system. Under British wartime socialism, capitalists and\r\nworkers genuinely pool their interests and restrict their demands to\r\nthe minimum, while men and women of all classes risk and give their\r\nlives in battle for the community. Until we adopt such a system and\r\nare inspired by the same dire necessity which animates the British,\r\nour system of production, man for man, and unit for unit, will not\r\nequal British production. As for the Nazis, their system of Socialism,\r\nbased on Terror and megalomania, aims to enslave the world; the\r\nBritish system of Socialism, based on free choice and democracy, aims\r\nto liberate the world. No, there is no possibility that any form of\r\ngovernment should emerge in England after the war which would be “as\r\nrepugnant to us as the Nazis’,” unless Britain is conquered and becomes\r\na satrapy of Hitler.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is this British wartime Socialism not really equivalent to\r\nCommunism? How does it differ from capitalism?_\r\n\r\nA. It is the sort of communism anyone would approve if it could work\r\nin peacetime, though it seems that it really works only in war. In\r\nwartime the motive that makes men work is defense of their lives, their\r\nfamilies, their nation, against an enemy from without. This leads to a\r\ndegree of self-sacrifice that is never even approximated in peacetime.\r\nWitness the invariable collapse of national morale after every war.\r\nOne of the chief reasons, if not the chief reason, why communism\r\nin peacetime does not work, either in Russia or anywhere else, is\r\nbecause except under the duress of war, individuals primarily work for\r\nthemselves. The Russian Bolshevik party tried for twenty-three years\r\nto make the Russians work for the community, but they never succeeded\r\nuntil now, when they have gone to war. No matter how the Battle of\r\nRussia turns out, when the war is over, if the Soviet Union is still\r\nCommunist, it will revert to its accustomed slackness and poverty.\r\nIf the British were to try to continue their wartime socialism into\r\npeacetime, they would find it impossible. Strikes would break out;\r\nemployers would begin to reach out for profits and soon the old-time,\r\nthough modified capitalism would return, with many of its faults, but\r\nstill far more productive than peacetime communism anywhere in the\r\nworld. Capitalism in peace; collectivism in war appears to be the law\r\nfor democracies in our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why did France fall?_\r\n\r\nA. Because the French people were hypnotized by their low birth rate;\r\nbecause their Maginot line had imprisoned their army; because, ignorant\r\nof the character and intentions of their enemy, they did not know\r\nwhy they had to fight the Germans and so preferred to fight among\r\nthemselves; because they had no Churchill; because they were betrayed\r\nby a powerful group of their leaders including senior officers of the\r\nArmy; and because the French were stultified by their debased and venal\r\npress.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But I thought they lost chiefly because they lacked the proper\r\nweapons: airplanes and tanks._\r\n\r\nA. They did not possess anything like the number of tanks and airplanes\r\nused by the Germans; but I would rank this deficiency at the bottom\r\nof any list of causes of the French defeat. If they had ignored their\r\nbirth rate, been willing to spend lives, had retained the old offensive\r\nspirit traditional in the French Army, had known that they had to win\r\nor perish, had possessed a Churchill to inspire and lead them, and had\r\nhad no traitors in their ranks, their comparative lack of weapons would\r\nnot have mattered; they would still be fighting the Germans in France.\r\nThe inferiority of their equipment consisted, as you indicate, in the\r\nlack of a sufficient number of planes and tanks, but if they had had\r\nthe spirit to win they could have held the Germans until the deficiency\r\ncould be made up.\r\n\r\nTanks cannot cross properly defended rivers, and there were several\r\nsets of rivers which the French could have held if they chose: the\r\nMeuse, the Somme and the Oise, the Aisne, the Marne, the Seine, and\r\nfinally the Loire, but they held not at all at any of these natural\r\nbarriers. At most of these rivers I was present during the retreat, and\r\nit astonished all of us, including United States officers, to visit a\r\nFrench position along a river one day and observe how strong it was,\r\nand how difficult it would be to take, and then the next day learn the\r\nGermans had taken it within a few hours of our departure.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But surely the reason was the German dive bombers who could fly\r\nacross the rivers and drive the defenders away. I have heard that they\r\nwere the principal weapon used to break the French who didn’t have\r\nenough pursuit planes to down them. It seems to me that if the dive\r\nbomber is anything like as lethal as it is said to be, you must put\r\nmore of the blame for the French collapse on it than on the failure of\r\nFrench morale._\r\n\r\nA. No, the dive bombers are not effective against brave determined\r\ntroops. They are not as effective as artillery. I have an authority\r\nfor that, General Charles Huntziger, now Minister of War of the\r\nVichy government. I met him when he was Commander of the Second Army\r\noccupying the left wing of the Maginot line. It was about May 31, 1940\r\nin the second week after the German break-through.\r\n\r\nGeneral Huntziger received me in his headquarters, an old fortress\r\nof Verdun. He explained that he had now taught his men how to meet\r\nthe terrible German tank-plus-dive-bomber attack. He said that he had\r\nexplained to his men that the dive bomber was not nearly so deadly as\r\nartillery, and that its effect was chiefly psychological, and that if\r\nthe soldiers could master their first fright they could hold their\r\nground and win. The great thing was to hold long enough to learn that\r\nyour chance of being killed by dive bombers was much less than your\r\nchance of being killed by artillery fire, since artillery shells may\r\nfall uninterruptedly for an indefinite time, while a dive bomber has\r\nonly one or at the most a few bombs to discharge, and once it has\r\ndropped them, has to return to its base for more, and the number of\r\ndive bombers is limited.\r\n\r\nHe emphasized that French soldiers had never been afraid to stand\r\nartillery fire, so why should they run from the less dangerous dive\r\nbombers? He said he instructed all soldiers not serving antiaircraft\r\nguns to go under cover for the few seconds while the dive bombers\r\ndived, but to emerge immediately upon hearing the detonation of the\r\nbombs, and meet the advancing tanks. If they were small thinly armored\r\ntanks, and the French possessed adequate antitank guns, they should\r\nattempt to destroy the tanks. If the tanks were too large and heavily\r\narmored, the French should permit the tanks to go through and emerge in\r\ntime to stop the German infantry following the tanks.\r\n\r\nGeneral Huntziger admitted that it had been extremely difficult at\r\nfirst to persuade his troops of the comparative harmlessness of the\r\ndive bombers and mentioned the fact that in the first thirteen days\r\nof the German attack his troops had been overwhelmed and he had lost\r\nfifty per cent of his effectives, more than ninety per cent of whom\r\nwere captured, but he believed that now the troops were experienced\r\nand could not be frightened as they were at first. As we were soon to\r\nobserve, the French troops never did get used to the dive bomber which\r\nis truly the most terrifying weapon ever invented. General Huntziger\r\ncompared it to a locomotive with its whistle wide open falling upon you\r\nfrom the sky.\r\n\r\n“You are certain it is coming just for you,” the General said, “and you\r\nbelieve it is not merely going to drop bombs upon you, but you are sure\r\nthe plane itself is going to crash upon you and leave you smashed like\r\na beetle.”\r\n\r\nThe noise of the dive bomber is its most terrifying quality. An\r\nordinary airplane diving makes a loud rushing noise familiar to\r\neveryone nowadays, but many of the German dive bombers were equipped\r\nwith sirens attached to loud-speakers, so that when they dived each\r\nplane screamed with the noise of a score of ordinary diving planes.\r\nIn addition to that they were often equipped with screaming bombs.\r\nGeneral Touchon, commander of the Sixth Army, showed me one at his\r\nheadquarters. It had four whistles, each about the size of a cannon\r\ncracker, in the vanes of its tail. They made each falling bomb sound\r\nas loud as four American locomotives with the whistles open. “But,”\r\nGeneral Huntziger said, “all you have to do is to realize that noise\r\ndoesn’t hurt anyone, and I have explained that to my soldiers and from\r\nnow on they will stand firm.”\r\n\r\nHuntziger gave me a copy of his orders of the day. I cannot read it\r\neven now without feeling the terrible weight of despair that settled\r\nupon all of us as we realized that the end of France was near. It is\r\ndated May 18, 1940 and begins: “The war has commenced,”--it was to\r\nbe all over in exactly thirty days--“and, in order to win, the enemy\r\nalways attacks your morale. In this first shock, his tactic, his ruses\r\nof warfare and his weapons have but one object, _to demoralize you_.\r\nThe enemy is reckoning only upon fighting you with fright. It is\r\nnecessary therefore that you know this.\r\n\r\n“Know also that the massive bombardments of the enemy aviation, no\r\nmatter how impressive they are, make few victims, as you may have\r\nalready noted. You know the total lost; they are a minimum. Take refuge\r\nwhen the enemy aircraft passes and immediately afterward take up again\r\nyour combat post. Never forget our aviation protects you. _Even when\r\nyou cannot see it._ Know that our airplanes have knocked down more than\r\na thousand enemy machines in less than eight days and that among the\r\nenemy our bombers are giving blow for blow.\r\n\r\n“Know that against infantry the tank is not able to accomplish big\r\nthings if you hide yourself and the tanks cannot see you. Let them pass\r\nwithout showing yourself, then fire on the guides who accompany them.\r\nWithout them the tank is almost blind; sooner or later it will have\r\nto abandon the field to refuel if our antitank guns have not already\r\nknocked it out.\r\n\r\n“These guns are very efficient; they have given many proofs of it in\r\nthe last few days.\r\n\r\n“Do not allow yourself to be influenced by tales of parachutists but\r\nif you actually find some, remember that an armed man can always beat\r\nthem. Guard yourself against imaginary dangers. As though you were in\r\nactive combat, you have to defend yourself against false rumors which\r\nmay be spread by a traitor or an imbecile seized with panic.\r\n\r\n“If you listen to such tales they may be able to provoke serious\r\ndefection. Listen to no one but your superior officers and those you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n“A man can overcome his fear. It is his duty to surmount it and to\r\ncombat the fears of others. If a man spreads fear he not only commits\r\nan act of cowardice. He commits treason.\r\n\r\n“Know finally that the enemy is not so strong as some people think.\r\nOppose to him your will. It is your will which will sweep the enemy\r\naway. Never forget what you are defending. If you let the enemy pass\r\nyou will lose more than your life. You will be pitilessly separated\r\nfrom your families to suffer far from them a slavery worse than death.”\r\n\r\nThe intelligence and courage of Huntziger as displayed in these orders\r\nwere of no avail, because he could not, as Churchill can, transmit his\r\nspirit to others. His soldiers listened to his talk and read his orders\r\nof the day but still they yielded to their fear. It must be seldom in\r\nmilitary history that a commanding general has to devote his principal\r\norders to adjuring his troops not to be afraid. The French Army was\r\nalready panic-stricken.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You say there was treachery among senior officers of the French\r\nArmy and among the government. Why do you say that and what proof of it\r\nhave you?_\r\n\r\nA. There were both treachery and treason. High French officers and\r\nofficials conspired to overthrow the Republic. Pétain himself was their\r\nleader. They were so fanatical in their desire to destroy the Republic\r\nthat they fell into the German trap and acquiesced in what the Germans\r\ntold them would be a fake defeat, after which they would set up the\r\nFascist government which they did set up at Vichy. After that Hitler\r\nwould withdraw his troops and restore France to all her old power\r\nand glory, an equal partner and friend of Nazi Germany. They were of\r\ncourse deceived and now most of them must realize they were deceived,\r\nand that Hitler has no intention of ever allowing France to be a great\r\npower again. But this awakening is too late and the guilty men, many\r\nof them now in Pétain’s government, have a life-and-death interest in\r\npreserving their secret, since in the present temper of the French\r\npeople if the truth were known many another assassination would follow\r\nthe attempts on Laval and Deat.\r\n\r\nThis is a rough outline of what I believe to have happened in France.\r\nI will be glad to give you all the evidence I have, admitting that\r\nit probably is not sufficient to win a verdict of guilty in a court\r\nof law, but maintaining that it is convincing to one who witnessed\r\nthe debacle and was bewildered by the lack of adequate explanation.\r\nYou see, after we had added up all the other reasons for the fall\r\nof France, there was still something lacking; something to explain\r\nthe fact that the French Army of nearly five million men, with its\r\ncenturies of glorious tradition, and its reputation among experts as\r\nthe best in the world, never once held firm after the Germans broke\r\nthrough the Low Countries, never once stopped the enemy for as much as\r\na day, but steadily, day by day retreated, crumbled, broke up, and at\r\nthe end of five weeks ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nReview our list of causes now and see if all of them put together\r\nexplain this phenomenon. Complacency and trust in the Maginot line\r\nand the softening effect of eight months of inactivity, comparative\r\nlack of leadership, man power and planes and tanks; lack of faith,\r\nanger, and the spirit to fight to kill; conflict between communists\r\nand conservatives. No, all these reasons together do not explain the\r\nconduct of the French Army between May 11 and June 17, 1940.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But the thesis you present is too astounding. That French Army\r\nofficers should have conspired with the enemy is almost beyond belief.\r\nDo you mean the French General Staff?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, the French General Staff. Not all of it; only a few members\r\nwere necessary. If you find it difficult to believe, remember that\r\nthe French officers and officials concerned did not believe they were\r\nbetraying France; they believed that Hitler would keep his word and\r\nrestore France as soon as the Republic was overthrown. To make this\r\naspect of the matter clear: suppose you were a young Frenchman today,\r\nwould you think of it as treason if you worked to overthrow the Vichy\r\ngovernment? Would you think of yourself as a traitor if you conspired\r\nwith the British to throw out Pétain and reorganize a democratic\r\ngovernment? No.\r\n\r\nWell, in so far as one can credit such Fascists with sincerity, we\r\nhave to admit that these men also thought they were serving the best\r\ninterests of France when they conspired to overthrow the Republic.\r\nRemember that French officers as a class have generally been\r\nanti-Republican. Napoleon’s officers soon forgot Republican principles\r\nin their devotion to the Emperor. The hierarchy of the Army did not\r\nfavor the equalitarianism of the French Republic. Aristocratic officers\r\ngenerally set the tone for the majority of the higher ranks. Time and\r\nagain I was astonished to note that upper-class Frenchmen seemed to\r\nremember as though it had been yesterday the bloody events of the\r\nFrench Revolution, and were more afraid of their own working class than\r\nof any foreign enemy.\r\n\r\nI visited once the famous deep cellar vaults of the Bank of France\r\nwhere they kept the gold, and while walking through the doorway,\r\npiercing its twenty-foot thick steel and concrete walls, I asked why\r\nthey needed such formidable and expensive protection. Was it against\r\nthe Germans? It could not be, because if ever the Germans occupied\r\nParis, as they do today, no underground fortification such as these\r\nvaults could prevent them from getting the gold, especially since the\r\nGermans would be holding as hostages the men with the keys. No, it was\r\nnot against a foreign enemy; the vaults were built against the Paris\r\nmob, against revolutionaries, against another 1789.\r\n\r\nThis spirit was shared by many French senior officers, and it is\r\nironic that their conspiracy to bring about a feigned defeat in order\r\nto overthrow the Republic was greatly helped by the defection of the\r\nParisian Communist troops in Corap’s Ninth Army at the Meuse. The\r\nvery workingmen who had most to lose by the fall of the Republic and\r\nthe establishment of a Fascist France, helped bring about their own\r\ndownfall under the mistaken guidance of Moscow. The treachery to France\r\ncame from the two opposite poles of French society.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How did this treason manifest itself in the operations of the army?_\r\n\r\nA. I will give you one example, from personal experience and the\r\ntestimony of French friends. You remember the Germans, when they broke\r\nthrough the Low Countries and across the Meuse, dashed with their\r\nPanzer divisions for the coast, pell-mell, at top speed, not bothering\r\nor wasting time at first to widen their column of penetration, which\r\nwas still only a few miles wide for much of its length when the first\r\nGerman detachments reached the sea at Abbeville. North of this thin\r\nGerman column was the strong French Army under General Prioux, while\r\nsouth of it were the main French forces. It was the constant fervid\r\nhope of the French that their armies would cut across the German\r\ncolumn, roll it up in two directions, and win not merely the battle of\r\nFrance but perhaps the war.\r\n\r\nMilitary experts, foremost our own, thought it possible; some held it\r\nprobable. This hope reached its climax after Weygand made an inspection\r\nflight to the Low Countries and returned to Paris. That day at the\r\nMinistry of Information as I was waiting in the office for Colonel\r\nSchieffer, in charge of American correspondents, the gaunt, one-eyed,\r\nblack-monocled, fiercely patriotic Colonel came in with a bang, dropped\r\nhis customary stillness and exclaimed: “Weygand says he won’t leave a\r\nGerman alive, not one. He’s going to cut the column and bottle them up\r\nand he says there won’t be left one living.” Like wildfire the word of\r\nWeygand spread through the building, through Paris, through France. It\r\nwas the only bright moment in the whole Battle of France.\r\n\r\nBut it did not happen. Why didn’t it? A captain from General Prioux’s\r\nstaff may have the answer. This is the story he told. “After the\r\nGermans reached Abbeville and cut us off from the South, General Prioux\r\ncalled us all together one day and said, ‘I have orders from General\r\nHeadquarters that you must blow up your tanks and guns and retreat as\r\nspeedily as possible to the seashore. I must tell you that personally\r\nI do not approve these orders. I am convinced we are strong enough to\r\nmake an offensive southward and cut the Germans and reunite with our\r\ntroops in France. However, orders are orders and one does not discuss\r\norders. You will do as I have told you and I shall stay here where I\r\nam.’\r\n\r\n“We did as we were told and Prioux became a prisoner of war. That was\r\nour last chance. The failure to cut the German column was the end of\r\nthe Battle of France. We could have done it; we were ordered not to.”\r\n\r\nCounterattack, always we waited for the famous French counterattack,\r\nthe fulfillment of the French Army tradition of aggression, _à la\r\nbaionette!_ but it never came. Orders stopped it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Who gave the orders? Pétain was not an active officer then._\r\n\r\nA. No, but General George was. I want to give you my evidence in the\r\nform of a firsthand quotation from a French friend, but before I do so\r\nit is important to point out that between General Gamelin, commander in\r\nchief of all the Allied land forces, and General George, commander of\r\nthe French armies fighting against Germany, there existed a jealousy so\r\nstrong that it amounted to hatred, and their headquarters staffs became\r\nso permeated with it that they actually withheld information from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHere then, were the principal elements and forces involved in the\r\ngreat conspiracy: First, Pétain, towering above all other figures and\r\nforces; then the Deuxième Bureau, the famous Second Bureau in charge of\r\nIntelligence of the French Army; General George and General Dusseigneur\r\nand Colonel Eugene Deloncle; the Cagoulards, that secret society of\r\nso-called Hooded Men, which most people considered merely absurd but\r\nwhose importance turned out to be greater than that of any French\r\nsecret society since the Revolution; the group operating the Fascist\r\nweekly, _Je Suis Partout_; and on the German side Otto Abetz, now\r\nHitler’s ambassador to France, and the unlimited money and propaganda\r\nof Himmler’s Gestapo, Goebbels’ Ministry, Ribbentrop’s Foreign Office,\r\nand the Ausland’s Buro.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Now I shall let my French friend talk. This is his report: from here\r\nto page 262 he is speaking in the first person._\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1940, I found myself standing outside a wayside tavern in\r\nFrance. I was one of the millions retreating southward from occupied\r\nParis ahead of the German Army. I had stopped by the roadside because,\r\nthrough the open window of the inn, I heard a radio broadcasting the\r\npathetic voice of an old man. Marshal Pétain was telling the French\r\nnation that he had decided to ask Hitler to grant France an armistice.\r\n\r\nStanding beside me was a young artillery lieutenant. As the last words\r\nof the old Marshal died away, he turned toward me, pale as ivory, and\r\nexclaimed: “Now I begin to understand! They forced us to retreat so\r\nthat we would have to accept this armistice, so that the Germans could\r\ncome in to do their dirty work for them!”\r\n\r\nI didn’t dare understand. “How do you mean?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be so naive!” he exploded. “Can’t you see what’s happened?\r\nDon’t you remember that handful of enthusiastic young fools who were\r\nalways shouting ‘Pétain in power!’ Well, now he is in power. He can\r\ngovern with the aid of German troops. He has opened the way for them to\r\noccupy the country. The Germans will make the arrests and carry out the\r\nexecutions, and when their opponents have all been put out of the way,\r\nPétain and his friends will be in possession of the kind of Nazified\r\ncountry they like. Mark my words--this is not the end, but only the\r\nbeginning. This is not war; it’s a domestic political maneuver!”\r\n\r\nAt that moment it seemed that only a man completely out of his mind\r\ncould have believed what the young officer had just said. A higher\r\nofficer who had been listening broke in to correct him. Pétain, he\r\nsaid, was very old and possibly not very intelligent. But he certainly\r\ncould not be a traitor.\r\n\r\n“His first consideration,” this officer went on, “will be to obtain\r\nreasonable terms from the enemy. I doubt very much whether he will give\r\nany time at all to internal political questions. All Frenchmen, all the\r\nlegislators, all the people, will be behind him in his struggle against\r\nthe Germans. What greater power could he gain by bringing about an\r\ninternal political transformation?”\r\n\r\nI said nothing but I was deeply anxious. _Why had Pétain announced\r\npublicly that he had asked for an armistice before he was sure\r\nthat honorable conditions would be granted?_ The mere fact of an\r\nannouncement’s having been made would complete the shattering of army\r\nmorale and all hope of further resistance, and make it impossible, in\r\ncase satisfactory terms could not be achieved, to reshape a fighting\r\narmy and resume the struggle. Pétain’s radio speech seemed at the very\r\nleast unwise--_unless its object were to eliminate the slightest chance\r\nthat the armistice might not go through_. And in that case, the young\r\nofficer was probably right.\r\n\r\nTwo dominant theories to explain the fall of France emerge: (1)\r\nFrance’s rapid debacle was due to complete unpreparedness, both\r\nphysical and spiritual; (2) France was sold out, and what happened\r\nis to be explained primarily by the operations of treason. Both\r\nexplanations are a part of the truth; neither of them is the whole\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThere was a lack of matériel of all sorts--infantry weapons and\r\nartillery, ammunition, tanks, planes, etc. It was true also that\r\nproduction in the munitions factories was increasing slowly, and that\r\nthe pace would have been insufficient if the intense warfare of the\r\nlast five weeks had had to be continued over a long period. But the\r\nfact was that the period of intense warfare was very short; and it is\r\nhardly logical to say that France was beaten because she would have\r\nlacked ammunition if the war had lasted longer.\r\n\r\nSome observers have imagined that France lacked munitions even for so\r\nshort a war, for it has been established that there were shortages at\r\nmany vital points. I talked with literally hundreds of soldiers and\r\nofficers during the retreat of June. Infantrymen complained that they\r\nwere given only three or four bullets per rifle; artillerymen said that\r\nwhole batteries were left without shells; tanks ran out of gasoline at\r\nthe very beginning of action and had no chance to refuel, and worst\r\nof all (everyone stressed this as having been the most discouraging\r\nfactor), German planes had complete and undisputed freedom in the air.\r\nAgain and again soldiers told me that during engagements, with hundreds\r\nof German planes above, on not one occasion did French aviation\r\ncome to the aid of the infantry. It was not surprising, under such\r\nconditions, that morale gave way, and that the army was psychologically\r\nprepared for the final collapse.\r\n\r\nBut was this lack of matériel at points essential to the defense the\r\nresult of a general shortage or simply of failure to get existing\r\nmunitions to the necessary centers? It seems indisputable that it was\r\nthe distributing system which was at fault. And was this breakdown\r\nof the supply lines simply due to lack of organization, or to a much\r\nmore serious cause--treason? Whatever the case, it is a fact that the\r\nretreating soldiers and officers, drawing their conclusions from such\r\nfacts as they had been able to witness, were unanimous in exclaiming:\r\n“We have been sold out!”\r\n\r\nNow listen to the story of a reserve officer, a captain of a\r\nmachine-gun detachment, one of the many with whom I talked.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me,” he said, “that our General Headquarters lacked\r\nexperience in supply problems, or that they forgot to send us\r\ncartridges for our machine guns. In 1914-1918 they had no trouble of\r\nthis kind. There were situations quite as complicated as this one\r\nagain and again during that war, but the ammunition always arrived.\r\nThis short action hasn’t exhausted our reserve of matériel. The depots\r\nare still full. Yet we at the front lines had to destroy our machine\r\nguns to save them from the enemy when we ran out of ammunition for\r\nthem and had to fall back. The same thing happened all along the\r\nfront, for machine guns, artillery of all calibers, and antitank guns.\r\nYou can call it disorganization, if you want. I call it intentional\r\ndisorganization--sabotage, directed, probably, from the same central\r\npoint. But I don’t dare yet to try to form any conclusions, to\r\nunderstand why such sabotage took place. Perhaps one day we shall all\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\nOn the roads choked with retreating columns and fleeing refugees,\r\nwhere military trucks and civilian cars were inextricably mingled,\r\nsoldiers talked of their misgivings during the waits, often hours long,\r\nfor jammed highways to be cleared so that traffic could resume its\r\ninterminable southward crawl. Scores of times, caught in such blocks,\r\nI heard soldiers or officers say: “Why are we constantly ordered to\r\nretreat? We haven’t been in any real engagement since the Somme. We’re\r\nnot afraid to fight, but the retreat orders keep us moving to the rear\r\nas fast as we can get over these encumbered roads. What is the cause of\r\nthis continual flight? Aren’t they ever going to establish a line of\r\nresistance and order us to hold it?”\r\n\r\nThey never did. One June 16, two days after Paris had been occupied\r\nby the Germans, I found myself on the right bank of the Loire, at the\r\nNevers bridge. My car, heavily loaded with the members of my family\r\nand all our luggage, had developed motor trouble. Our most urgent need\r\nwas to get across that river; for we supposed of course, that the\r\nretreating troops would stop on the other side of the natural line of\r\ndefense constituted by the Loire, which it should have been possible to\r\nhold for weeks, and possibly forever. Across that bridge, we thought,\r\nlay safety.\r\n\r\nWe tried to persuade passing cars to tow us across. All of them,\r\ncivilian and military vehicles alike, passed us by. Their occupants\r\nintent on the pursuing Germans, had no thought for anything except to\r\nget across that bridge themselves. So we all got out except a young\r\ngirl who took the steering wheel, and pushed the car over what seemed\r\nto be the longest bridge in the world.\r\n\r\nWe felt better when we got to the other side, with the wide river\r\nbetween us and the enemy. I found a colonel supervising the retreat\r\nof his troops, and asked him if he could direct me to the officer in\r\ncharge of the sector, thinking that he could probably let me have a\r\nmechanic to repair the car.\r\n\r\n“There is no officer in charge here,” the colonel said. “We are all\r\npassing through without stopping, so there is no organization at this\r\npoint. I’m sorry I can’t do anything for you. You had better get out\r\nof here as quickly as you can. The Germans will probably be here in an\r\nhour.” From these words I realized with a shock that the defense of\r\nthe left bank of the Loire was not even being considered, and that the\r\narmy was retreating indefinitely. I looked up and down the long banks\r\nof the river. There were no fortified positions whatsoever. I saw only\r\none lonely soldier standing by the side of a machine gun. He seemed to\r\nbe wondering whether he had been forgotten there.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Loire, the bewilderment of the troops deepened, for all\r\nof them had expected that that line would be held. Time and again I\r\nheard the question asked: “Where are we going?” Those who clung to hope\r\nto the last declared desperately: “The generals must have a plan. Our\r\norders are to retreat as quickly as we can. There must be reasons for\r\nit.” But most of them simply gave up the attempt to understand what was\r\ngoing on, and why no effort was being made to resist.\r\n\r\nFor three months after the armistice I remained in France. I wanted\r\nto find out the story behind the defeat. What I have to tell is not\r\npure hypothesis. It is the only possible explanation which can be\r\ndeduced from a number of unknown or little known facts which I took the\r\ngreatest trouble to verify. Here is the story:\r\n\r\nThere has been ample occasion in recent years to observe Nazi\r\npropaganda tactics, among them the method which consists in selecting\r\nthe most appropriate arguments to convince any group the Nazis wish to\r\nwin over, even when those arguments are directly contrary to those used\r\nwith another group. Such a procedure would seem on the surface likely\r\nto defeat its own aims; but it is the tendency of each group to believe\r\nwhat it wants to believe, that Hitler is telling the truth, while\r\ndeceiving its adversaries. It is the same state of mentality which\r\nconfidence men evoke in such tested swindles as the rosary game, in\r\nwhich the sucker is led to see himself as the accomplice in victimizing\r\nsomeone else and thus never imagines that he is marked for the role of\r\nvictim himself.\r\n\r\nIt was in this fashion that Germany laid the foundation for France’s\r\ndefeat by corrupting different groups of the population in different\r\nways. Agents of Berlin told the French Communists, for instance, that\r\nGermany was Soviet Russia’s ally, and that if Hitler won the war, he\r\nwould not oppose a Communist Revolution in France. The new French\r\nSoviet Republic could then conclude an alliance with Germany, Russia,\r\nand Italy and take part in the totalitarian reconstruction of postwar\r\nEurope. French Communist leaders swallowed this propaganda, and the\r\nresult was slowing down of production in munitions plants due to\r\ninsidious Communist propaganda against which the Interior Ministry\r\ntried in vain to take effective measures.\r\n\r\nThere were many evidences that Communists believed they were working\r\nin accord with Germany. After the armistice, Communist factory workers\r\nin the occupied region on several occasions started the singing of the\r\n_Internationale_ in the factories where they were employed with the\r\nidea that this would please their new masters, and were surprised that\r\nit didn’t.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the Communists had been given reasons for believing\r\nthat they were on the side of the Germans. Some of the French Bolshevik\r\nleaders who deserted during the war fled to Germany. Findings of\r\nFrench radiogoniometric services proved that Communist short-wave\r\nstations broadcasting in French were operating from Germany. After the\r\nGerman troops reached Paris, several young French writers known for\r\ntheir Communist sympathies, who had remained behind when most other\r\nLeftists had fled, were immediately given important places, such as\r\nthe editing of Paris daily papers, by the Nazi authorities. These\r\nincidents demonstrate that the Germans had succeeded in establishing\r\nrelationships with French Communist leaders during the war; but it must\r\nbe recorded that the majority of Communist workmen remained definitely\r\nhostile to the Nazis.\r\n\r\nThis failure to enlist the support among the Communist rank and file\r\nwhich had been found among the leaders convinced the German secret\r\nservice early that there was no real chance of bringing about the\r\ndefeat of France by fomenting a Bolshevik revolution. If such a method\r\nhad been feasible, Nazi Germany would certainly not have hesitated to\r\napply it, just as Imperial Germany did not hesitate to send Lenin and\r\nhis companions in their famous sealed railroad coach into Russia in\r\n1917.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, the Communist movement was taken advantage\r\nof by the Germans only to the extent of being employed to create as\r\nmuch unrest as possible among French workers, who did not even realize\r\nto what influences they were being exposed. The chief effort of\r\nGerman secret agents was concentrated on conservative circles, which,\r\naccording to reports received at the Wilhelmstrasse, were in a much\r\nbetter position to exert effective influence on the outcome of the war.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing contradictory about this willingness on the part of\r\nthe Nazis to cooperate with either the extreme Left or the extreme\r\nRight, or even with both simultaneously, since their object, whatever\r\ntheir dupes might think, was not to help them to victory, but to use\r\nthem as a tool to weaken the unity and the power of the government.\r\nNazi propaganda welcomed any loophole through which it might penetrate\r\ninto the vitals of a foreign country with the aid of any resistance to\r\nthe regime which might already exist there.\r\n\r\nFor years before the war, the Nazis had established contact with\r\nreactionary Rightist circles in France. One such circle which in\r\nAmerica has been accused of having been influenced by the Germans and\r\nhaving perhaps contributed to France’s downfall is the Croix de Feu,\r\nat one time generally considered as the future Fascist movement of\r\nFrance. I must say that I could find neither proof nor indication that\r\nthe Croix de Feu had played Germany’s game. On the contrary, the _Petit\r\nJournal_, published by Colonel François de la Rocque, the Croix de Feu\r\nleader, assumed a more courageously anti-German attitude after the\r\narmistice than did most other papers published under the control of\r\nthe Vichy government.\r\n\r\nTwo other less conspicuous, but perhaps more influential Right-wing\r\ngroups were, however, definitely approached by the Germans during the\r\nprewar years. One of them was the secret revolutionary organization\r\npopularly known as the Cagoulards (the Hooded ones); the other was the\r\ngroup which published the weekly, _Je Suis Partout_. These contacts\r\nwere established chiefly by Otto Abetz, infamous “special delegate”\r\nof Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop, who was expelled from France\r\nshortly before the war. On his initiative, members of both groups\r\nundertook several trips to Berlin between 1937 and 1939 to discuss\r\nmeans of action.\r\n\r\nThe German secret service had a particular interest in these two groups\r\nbecause, while entirely independent of each other, they had one thing\r\nin common--far-reaching ties with the French Army.\r\n\r\nThe Cagoulard group was headed by French officers of high rank--majors,\r\ncolonels, and even generals. General Dusseigneur was among those\r\narrested when the Cagoulard movement was uncovered shortly before\r\nthe war after it had planted bombs in Paris. The dissolution of the\r\nmovement made its members more cautious, but its underground activities\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nIf any further evidence of German support for the Cagoulards had been\r\nneeded beyond that already turned up by the French police, it was\r\nprovided by the Germans themselves. When they occupied Paris, one\r\nof the first things they did was to demand that the French national\r\npolice turn over the files on the Cagoulard case. From these files, the\r\nGermans learned the names of the police commissioners who had unearthed\r\nthe Cagoulard plot, and immediately arrested those who were in occupied\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThis was in striking contrast to the treatment of the arrested\r\nCagoulard leaders, all of whom had been released by the French\r\ngovernment by the beginning of the war. Shortly after the start of\r\nhostilities I met in the train the brother of one of the Cagoulards\r\nwho had been arrested. In the ensuing conversation, I remarked that I\r\nwas astonished that responsible adults should have indulged at such a\r\ntime in what then appeared to have been a somewhat childish imitation\r\nof a motion picture conspiracy. Nettled by my attitude, my interlocutor\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand how serious this movement was. It was organized\r\nby the Deuxième Bureau (the department of the army concerned with\r\nespionage and counterespionage). It was at the instigation of the\r\nmilitary secret service that my brother and his friends organized the\r\nCagoulards. That can’t be told now, of course, but the day will come\r\nwhen all the truth will be known, and my brother will be considered a\r\nhero for the time he has spent in prison.”\r\n\r\n“The Deuxième Bureau!” I exclaimed incredulously. “Why in the world\r\nshould the Deuxième Bureau want to foster a revolutionary movement when\r\nit’s already so near the power itself?”\r\n\r\n“Ever since the 1936 elections,” he answered, “important members of the\r\nFrench secret service have been very much worried about the influence\r\nthe Communist movement has gained in this country, and so they decided\r\nto take matters into their own hands. The Cagoulard movement was formed\r\nto do that. The Popular Front ministers got my brother and his friends\r\nput in jail, but you’ll see that they haven’t said their last word yet.”\r\n\r\n_Je Suis Partout_, the weekly which was another outpost of German\r\npropaganda in France, belonged originally to the publishing house of\r\nFayard, which put out books and another and more prosperous political\r\nweekly, _Candide_. _Je Suis Partout_ was a money loser and publisher\r\nArthème Fayard decided several years ago to discontinue it. When\r\nthe news got out, Pierre Gaxotte, editor of the paper, proposed to\r\nFayard that he turn the paper’s name over to him instead of giving him\r\nseverance pay, since he thought he might be able to keep the magazine\r\ngoing himself. Fayard agreed, and _Je Suis Partout_ continued to appear\r\nwithout interruption, and so far as the public knew, without any change\r\nin its control. Circulation did not increase. Advertising continued\r\nlow. The paper showed no signs of prosperity--but it did not show any\r\nsigns of having financial difficulties any more either.\r\n\r\nPierre Gaxotte, as well as some other members of his editorial staff,\r\nhad begun his political career in the Royalist _Action Française_\r\nmovement, but had apparently decided to strike out for himself and\r\ncut his own political tracks. Under Gaxotte’s direction, _Je Suis\r\nPartout_ assumed a definitely pro-German attitude, arguing that France\r\nand Germany should come to an understanding between themselves as the\r\ntwo great continental powers, leaving England out in the cold. Paul\r\nFerdonnet, who won fame later as the “traitor of Stuttgart” delivering\r\npropaganda broadcasts in French from the Stuttgart radio station during\r\nthe war (he is now supervisor of the French radio in Paris), was\r\nalso on the editorial staff until he went to Berlin to establish his\r\npermanent residence and his own press syndicate there. From that time\r\non, he was the secret liaison agent between the German authorities and\r\nGaxotte’s paper.\r\n\r\nThe German sympathies of _Je Suis Partout_ were apparent enough, but\r\nno one bothered much about it, for circulation was low and the paper’s\r\ninfluence was considered to be negligible. This must have been the\r\nviewpoint of the Daladier government also, for except for friendly\r\narguments with the censors, the paper was able to continue publishing\r\nunhampered even after the war broke out.\r\n\r\nWhen Daladier resigned and Paul Reynaud came in, he appointed Georges\r\nMandel Minister of the Interior, and thus head of the French police\r\norganization. Although Mandel, zealous, patriotic, and uncompromising,\r\nlike his master Clemenceau whose secretary he had been during the\r\nlast war, undertook to hunt down defeatists of all descriptions, _Je\r\nSuis Partout_ continued to appear as usual. Mandel also apparently\r\nconsidered it too insignificant to be dangerous.\r\n\r\nBut one day a well-known French journalist brought to Mandel the\r\nproof that the principal members of the editorial staff of _Je Suis\r\nPartout_ were simultaneously agents of the Deuxième Bureau. Mandel was\r\nastounded. He who knew all the undercurrents of French political life,\r\nwho for years had kept secret files about all public figures, had not\r\ndreamed that any connection could have existed between this outspokenly\r\npro-German magazine and one of the most influential departments of\r\nthe French Army. He had put the editors of _Je Suis Partout_ down as\r\ninnocuous fools. He now realized that though the circulation of the\r\npaper was small, the private influence of its editors might have been\r\nboth great and disastrous.\r\n\r\nHe did not hesitate an instant. He ordered immediately the arrest of\r\nfive members of the staff. Among them was an obscure journalist, not\r\ngenerally known as a member of the staff, named Pierre Mouton, who some\r\nyears before had founded a small press syndicate called _Prima Presse_\r\nin partnership with Ferdonnet. Mandel quickly obtained proof that the\r\ntwo men were still cooperating. Mouton, while maintaining permanent\r\ncontact with _Je Suis Partout_, was also flooding the French daily\r\npress with cleverly prepared pro-German articles which were supplied to\r\nthe newspapers free of charge.\r\n\r\nWith the known leaders of the _Je Suis Partout_ group in jail, Mandel\r\napparently thought that there was no immediate urgency for delving\r\nfurther into this particular case when so many other vital matters\r\npressed for attention. The same attitude had been taken a few years\r\nbefore in regard to the Cagoulards, who seemed to have been set down\r\nas definitely muzzled because their figureheads had been imprisoned.\r\nNeither the stern and Spartan Mandel, who had arrested the _Je Suis\r\nPartout_ group, nor the vivacious and epicurean Albert Sarraut, his\r\npredecessor, who had handled the Cagoulard case, imagined that either\r\nof these two groups had achieved a real and lasting penetration into\r\nthe high command--a penetration which seems to have contributed largely\r\nto the debacle of May and June.\r\n\r\nPossibly the two cases had never been laid side by side so that the\r\ntelltale fact that both times a trail led to the Deuxième Bureau\r\nhad not been observed. Perhaps also the two Interior Ministers had\r\nhesitated each time before venturing to have civilian authorities\r\ninvestigate the most powerful of the military departments. The Deuxième\r\nBureau of the French Army was sometimes called “a state within the\r\nstate.” It might more exactly have been called “several states within\r\nthe state,” for it was a complicated organism with its own currents\r\nand undercurrents, comprising a number of competing groups. Somewhere\r\nwithin this complicated office existed the only link between the\r\npro-German _Je Suis Partout_ and the German-inspired Cagoulards; but\r\non the surface, at least at the beginning, no relation seemed to exist\r\nbetween these two separate activities.\r\n\r\nThe Cagoulard movement, although it had started in the Deuxième Bureau,\r\nsoon succeeded through the interlinking relationships of high officers,\r\nsome of whom supported its activities, in putting out tentacles into\r\nthe first and third bureaus of the army as well--those concerned\r\nrespectively with direction of operations and supplies--in other words\r\nthe two departments which in June were responsible respectively for\r\nthe orders to retreat and for the failure of the front-line troops to\r\nreceive ammunition and aid from the aviation.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted also that several of these high officers who were\r\nsympathetic to the Cagoulard movement were in particularly close\r\ncontact with Marshal Pétain who had his own devoted followers in the\r\narmy, just as all other first-rank military leaders, like Gamelin and\r\nWeygand, had also, whether they were on the active list or retired.\r\n\r\nAll this may seem incredible. It is difficult to believe that French\r\nofficers of high rank should have acted in the interests of Germany\r\nduring the war, thus contributing to bring about their country’s\r\ndownfall. Even though the Cagoulards, an emanation of the Deuxième\r\nBureau, may have maintained contact with the Germans several years\r\nbefore the war; even if unsuccessful newspapermen like Gaxotte may have\r\nmade up for deficits by accepting subsidies from the Nazis, it still\r\nseems fantastic that the military leaders of France, whose patriotism\r\nno one has ever doubted, should have acted as traitors in time of war.\r\nIt seems to be a moral impossibility.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is simple. Neither the Cagoulards, nor the editors\r\nof _Je Suis Partout_, nor the French officers who were in relations\r\nwith them, ever believed at any moment that they were traitors. If\r\nhistory sets them down as having betrayed France, the verdict will be\r\nincomprehensible to them. They believed themselves to be patriots. It\r\nis our privilege, if we wish, to see them rather as pitiful victims of\r\nGerman Propaganda.\r\n\r\nWhat happened was this: Long before the war, the Nazi secret service\r\nrealized that both the Cagoulards and the staff of _Je Suis Partout_\r\nwere worth cultivating because of their connections with members of\r\nthe French General Staff, and with officers of influence close to such\r\nleaders as Pétain, among others.\r\n\r\nFriendly relations were established, and the Germans hammered away with\r\narguments like these:\r\n\r\n“You Frenchmen consider that we Germans are your hereditary enemies.\r\nThere’s no reason why you should think so. Our two peoples should\r\nbe able to live and work side by side without friction. It’s true\r\nwe’ve had trouble in the past, but why? Because England, who can only\r\nmaintain her influence on the continent if the continental nations are\r\ndivided, has constantly stirred us up against each other.\r\n\r\n“Besides that, we have not fought against the real France. Our wars\r\nwere against the French Republic. For 150 years that regime has usurped\r\nthe place of the real France. In 1789 the English provoked the French\r\nRevolution to weaken your nation, and since then your people seem to\r\nhave forgotten its great destiny.\r\n\r\n“The Revolution of France started in the lodges of Freemasonry, which\r\nwere implanted in your country by England. The Freemasons operated\r\nwith English and Jewish help; for the last 150 years, you have been\r\nunder the control of the same powers. For the last twenty years these\r\npowers have been cooperating with international Communism and thus have\r\nbrought another danger into your country.\r\n\r\n“Wake up! Denounce the English alliance, expel the Jews from important\r\npositions, suppress Freemasonry, as we have done in Germany. The danger\r\nof Communism will be over, and there will be no obstacle to a happy and\r\npeaceful understanding between France and Germany.”\r\n\r\nThis bait was eagerly taken. It made no difference that this account\r\nwas inaccurate, and might easily have been refuted. It was the sort of\r\nthing that right-wing Frenchmen of anti-Republican and antidemocratic\r\nleanings were ready to hear, and it provided a moral basis for\r\ncooperation between them and the Germans. Supplied with a patriotic\r\nmotive for destroying their domestic political opponents, convinced\r\nthat in so doing they would not open the way to the hereditary enemy\r\nbut on the contrary make him a friend, these Frenchmen no longer had\r\nany scruples about accepting subsidies for the arming of the Cagoulards\r\nand the publication of _Je Suis Partout_ from an ally in the common\r\ncause of continental peace and friendship.\r\n\r\nThe Germans had found the ideal sophism with which to gain friends\r\nwithin the French Army. They realized, of course, that they could\r\nnot hope to influence a majority of General Staff officers, but they\r\nknew also that an active minority, so convinced it is right that it\r\nis willing to use any methods to achieve its aims, can arrive at its\r\nobjectives at decisive moments by obstructing the course of action\r\ndecided upon by the majority. And among the officers whom German\r\npropaganda had reached were many so placed that they could easily block\r\nthe complicated intermeshing gears of the army machine at the critical\r\njuncture.\r\n\r\nRelationships between the Germans and their friends in France were\r\nmaintained even after the beginning of the war through various neutral\r\ncountries. Ferdonnet continued to communicate with Mouton and the staff\r\nof _Je Suis Partout_. Michelin, the big automobile tire manufacturer\r\nwhose name was whispered all over France as that of one of the men\r\nbehind the Cagoulards, sent frequent messengers to Switzerland. Pétain\r\nhimself was French Ambassador to Spain, and several members of his\r\nentourage maintained contact with members of the German Embassy in\r\nMadrid. There were even rumors that Pétain had secret meetings with the\r\nGerman Ambassador, though this was denied. The theme the Germans were\r\nsinging to their French friends now was a development of that which\r\nthey had dinned into them earlier. It had evolved into this:\r\n\r\n“We did not want this war. You yourselves did your utmost to avoid it.\r\nBut now that it has come it is a fact which we cannot leave out of\r\naccount. Both of us wanted to create a better understanding between our\r\ntwo countries, to be followed by an alliance. The war now prevents us\r\nfrom reaching our goal by direct means.\r\n\r\n“If you concluded a separate peace with us, we could still become your\r\nallies. We know, of course, that you and your friends, who have the\r\ntrue interests of your country at heart, and can see into the future\r\nmore clearly than the others, would eagerly accept this solution. But\r\nyou have not the power to do it; and even if you had, the people who\r\nhave been worked up by war propaganda to hate us, would never agree to\r\nit. There is only one case now in which the French people would accept\r\na separate peace; and that, unfortunately, is if France suffers a\r\nmilitary defeat.\r\n\r\n“It must seem monstrous to you even to envisage a French defeat. We\r\nunderstand that. We sympathize with you. But suppose you knew that\r\nit would not be a real defeat. Suppose we could arrange a simulated\r\ndefeat, which would bring the French people to accept the idea of an\r\narmistice whether the English are ready to fight or not?\r\n\r\n“We can give you a binding promise that if France can be apparently\r\ndefeated in this manner, she will not be treated as a defeated nation.\r\nOn the contrary, you will immediately become Germany’s ally and we will\r\ncooperate to build up a new order in Europe. You have only to break\r\ndefinitely with England as proof of your good faith.\r\n\r\n“Of course, a brief occupation of certain parts of France by German\r\ntroops would be necessary to make the defeat look real and to persuade\r\nthe population to accept it. One of the purposes of the occupation\r\nwould be to purge France of the elements which you dislike just as much\r\nas we do, and which stand in your way in your task of resuscitating the\r\nreal France from her torpor of a century and a half. But when it is\r\nall over, when our troops have been withdrawn, you will be in control\r\nof a new and reborn France which with the new Germany will impose upon\r\nEurope an era of strength and prosperity for both of us.”\r\n\r\nOnce again the bait was taken. Its effect was felt in extremely\r\ninfluential circles. I have personally been able to verify conclusively\r\nthe fact that Marshal Pétain, having invited two highly placed\r\nSpaniards to dine with him in Hendaye in November 1939, said to his\r\nguests: “Do not judge France by its present appearance. Democracy\r\nis finished everywhere. Next spring will see a movement in France\r\ncomparable to your own national uprising.”\r\n\r\nSuch a phrase in the mouth of a French Ambassador who was at the same\r\ntime a French military leader was extremely significant. What other\r\nmeaning could a revolt in wartime have except that its intent was to\r\nend the war? What other reason could there have been for waiting until\r\nspring except that this period was the best for a German offensive?\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary, as I have already noted above, to transform all\r\nor even a majority of the officers of the French General Staff, into\r\naccomplices in order to provoke a French defeat. If in a big business,\r\na few accountants, an assistant cashier, the head of the sales\r\ndepartment, and one or two keymen in the stock department took part in\r\na conspiracy to ruin the firm, their simultaneous coordinated sabotage\r\nwould inevitably achieve their aim--and with particular ease if the\r\norganization of the company were faulty.\r\n\r\nThere were some faults with the French Army, certainly. Was morale\r\nunsatisfactory? Was equipment inadequate? Undoubtedly, but the\r\nsituation in these respects was not strikingly different from that of\r\n1914-1918. The decisive factor seems to have been faults in the high\r\ncommand--important information regarding the movements of the enemy\r\nwas not relayed in time, orders to army corps suffered considerable\r\ndelays, the supply service left equipment and matériel of all sorts in\r\nthe depots instead of sending it to strategically important points.\r\nFrom June 13 on, troops in good fighting shape received everywhere\r\nmysterious orders for retreat which puzzled them most of all, at the\r\nsame time that French statesmen were hearing from French generals (most\r\nof them may have spoken with complete good faith), that all troops were\r\nfleeing in disorder. Confusion was so great and news of the retreat so\r\nunexpected that nobody thought to investigate the hidden causes of the\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nShortly after the armistice, the same announcement was repeated in\r\nFrench by the Stuttgart radio several evenings in succession. It was\r\nthis: “Frenchmen, in a few days we will give you the name of an\r\noutstanding countryman of yours who was our principal agent in France,\r\nand who helped to bring about your defeat.”\r\n\r\nEveryone in the French unoccupied zone either heard this broadcast or\r\nheard about it. There was naturally a good deal of guessing as to the\r\nname that would be given by the Germans. For my part, I made a bet that\r\nno name would ever be given by Stuttgart. My reasoning was this: That\r\nthere was such a man or men I didn’t doubt for an instant. But I didn’t\r\ndoubt also that he had not expected the terrible armistice conditions\r\nimposed upon France. He had led his country into what he had thought\r\nwould be a fake defeat on the basis of his confidence in the honesty of\r\nthe Germans. By then he had discovered that they were not honest, and\r\nthat it was a real defeat that had been inflicted upon the country. He\r\nsaw that the Nazis intended to treat the country with all the severity\r\nof genuine conquerors, and that he and his friends had been dupes.\r\n\r\nI supposed then, that this man had tried to force the Germans to live\r\nup to their promises and to treat France as an ally. He would have\r\npointed out that the new Pétain government had turned against England,\r\nas had been agreed. And he would have threatened to reveal everything\r\nif Germany did not hold to her bargain, thus ending the acceptance of\r\ndefeat on the part of the French people by letting them know that they\r\nhad not in fact been militarily defeated.\r\n\r\nGermany’s answer was the Stuttgart broadcast. Her French agent had\r\ntried to threaten her. She simply returned the blackmail, reminding him\r\nforcefully that the Reich no longer cared whether the French people\r\nknew how it had been defeated or not, since the Army was disbanded,\r\nthe strategic points occupied, and the people helpless to resume the\r\nfight. He was reminded also what his own position would be if the story\r\ncame out. He saw that he had to keep silence to save himself, and the\r\nGermans, perfectly willing that silence should be kept, never honored\r\ntheir promise to reveal his name.\r\n\r\nIt was on the basis of this theory that I expected in advance that the\r\nStuttgart radio would not follow up its announcement. Since it did not,\r\nI feel justified in assuming that the reasoning which enabled me to\r\narrive at a correct prediction was probably correct itself.\r\n\r\nAs if to confirm all this, Pétain himself later made a very mild speech\r\nin which he timidly asked the Germans whether they intended to accept\r\nthe new France as a full-fledged partner in the reconstruction of\r\nEurope. France’s new rulers have kept all the promises they had given\r\nthe Germans. They have cut off relationships with England, dissolved\r\nthe Freemasons, attacked the Jews, delivered up anti-Hitler German\r\nrefugees, fought the British at Oran, Dakar, and in Syria. They have\r\nslavishly obeyed Hitler’s commands and now they are naively surprised\r\nbecause Hitler has not kept his promise to free France and make her\r\nindependent again. With the true psychology of a dupe they had believed\r\nthat Hitler might fool others, but never themselves.\r\n\r\n_That ends the statement of my French friend._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How would you sum up Pétain? Is he a patriot or a traitor, or\r\nmisguided, or what?_\r\n\r\nA. He is first of all a very old, too-old man. Only a man who had\r\nlost his judgment could surrender his country to Hitler as Hindenburg\r\ndid and as Pétain did, both under a profound misconception of\r\nHitler. Pétain is intensely religious and identifies Communism with\r\nanti-Christ, the only enemy, failing to perceive that the most powerful\r\nfoe of Christianity to appear on earth since Christ lived is Hitler.\r\nIt is a mistake to call Pétain a Fascist; he is a medievalist. He\r\nbelieves the principal goal of life is to prepare for the other\r\nworld, and the man who can do that best is the man whose activity is\r\nclosest to nature, the peasant, and the man whose mind is not confused\r\nby learning, the illiterate peasant. Therefore he wants a France of\r\nuneducated, devout peasants; he does not mind at all the plan of Hitler\r\nto abolish French industry.\r\n\r\nHe is a defeatist at heart; the affairs of this earth are not worth\r\nfighting for. It is on record that at Verdun he several times wished\r\nto surrender. As a defeatist he believes in superior force and can be\r\nas ruthless when he is in possession of it as he can be submissive\r\nwhen he has lost it. His suppression of the mutinies in the French\r\nArmy was notoriously harsh; the statistics of the killed have yet to\r\nbe published. He accepts the French birth rate as a fact of superior\r\nforce to which France must bow and his experience of the bloodletting\r\nat Verdun reinforced his conviction that France ought not to try to\r\nmaintain a predominant place in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs an old man his vivid memories are of the past, and Germany, though\r\nmarching under the pirate swastika, remained for him in 1940 the\r\nGermany which let France off lightly in 1871. He once told a friend\r\nhow impressed he was with the behavior of the German commander at\r\nVerdun who allowed French officers to retain their swords after one of\r\nthe surrenders of Douaumont. In this venerable confidence that he was\r\ndealing with gentlemen, he gave up. The most pathetic words uttered in\r\nthis war were those of Pétain when he addressed his petition for an\r\narmistice to Hitler with the words, “I speak as soldier to soldier.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why was that pathetic; isn’t Hitler a soldier?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, indeed, but the meaning of the old marshal’s words was,\r\n“I speak to you as gentleman to gentleman,” and that is the most\r\npathetic sentence of the war, because it contains the utter failure\r\nof the French to understand that not only is Hitler not a gentleman,\r\nbut Hitler would be the first indignantly to repudiate a title he\r\ndespises. The code of a gentleman is derived from the Christian code,\r\nwhich Hitler and his Nazi-Nietzchean followers despise. They curse\r\nChrist as a Jewish weakling whose religion is for slaves. They spit\r\nupon the elementary idea of fair play. A group of devoted young Nazis,\r\na dozen strong, who have just beaten to death a crippled Jew, will be\r\nclear of conscience, joyful as though they had done a good deed, and\r\nutterly unable to understand the American or British notion that it is\r\nnot even enjoyable sport to attack with odds of twelve to one. It is\r\nsport to them. Pétain had not the faintest notion that the sons of the\r\nGermans he had known had come to this. So with his eyes closed, and\r\ndreaming of the past, he accepted the promise of a position for France\r\nof junior partner to Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is Pétain moved by personal ambition?_\r\n\r\nA. He is consumed by it. He did not accept with reluctance the post\r\nof “Chief of the Government” after Reynaud fell, but gladly, feeling\r\nthat he had finally received the recognition denied him when Foch was\r\nmade Commander in Chief. He does not consider himself a Fuehrer or a\r\nDuce. He is much nearer the position of his fellow clericalist, the\r\n_caudillo_, Franco, who never clearly understood the meaning of Nazism\r\nand was repelled by what he did understand.\r\n\r\nPétain does not understand Fascism or Nazism but only sees that they\r\ncontrol the mob, and he wishes above all to see the mob controlled as\r\nan army, to be drilled and disciplined into hardworking, God-fearing\r\nFrenchmen, obedient in civil as in religious life. His religious\r\nfeeling dominates all his actions. In Bordeaux, the day Reynaud\r\nresigned, I was told Pétain’s words as he heard the debacle was\r\nreaching its end: “France must suffer for her sins!” Mystically he\r\nsurrendered, and mystically he still exclaimed a year later to a nation\r\nwhich had endured twelve months of injury and abasement with no\r\nprospect of relief, “You are suffering and must suffer for a long time\r\nstill because we have not yet paid for all our mistakes.”\r\n\r\nTo the old Marshal, France’s troubles began with the Revolution of\r\n1789, and to cure them he wants to take France back to the Ancien\r\nRegime. He wants to do away with liberty, because liberty is synonymous\r\nwith license and license with sin. Theoretically he is a monarchist,\r\nbut now that he has become Regent, like Horthy of Hungary, he does not\r\nwant a king. This period Pétain regards as France’s purgatory, which he\r\ngladly endures, confident of a better world. Many Frenchmen recognize\r\nPétain’s good intentions but do not believe they will save him from\r\nHell.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why, if the Germans have such a hold over Pétain, have they not\r\nforced him to surrender the French fleet and to give them the use of\r\nthe North African naval and air bases? If Pétain is in fear of being\r\nrevealed by the Germans as one who helped bring about the French\r\ndefeat, why can’t the Germans get anything they want from him?_\r\n\r\nA. First, because Pétain is more useful to the Germans than the French\r\nfleet and the North African bases. Who else could lead so many of the\r\nFrench people to submit and collaborate as they are doing today under\r\nPétain? Pétain does Hitler’s work for him. Pétain coaxes the plunder\r\nfrom the French people in the form of taxes and hands it to Hitler in\r\nthe form of payment for maintenance of the army of occupation. If the\r\nGermans ever exposed him, he would lose his position and they would\r\nlose their most useful servant.\r\n\r\nSecond, the more time that elapses since the armistice, the less\r\neffective is the German blackmail threat on Pétain, because as time\r\npasses people become less interested in what happened, and as\r\nexperience with the Germans deepens, fewer people can be found to\r\nbelieve any German explanation.\r\n\r\nThird, Pétain, with all his senility, must have realized that it is\r\nnot nearly as certain now that Germany will win, as it was when he\r\nsurrendered. The Russian resistance, much as Pétain hates and despises\r\nBolshevism, must have made him think; and the growing belligerence of\r\nAmerica must have had some effect upon him. As he becomes less and less\r\nconvinced that Germany is certain to win he should logically become\r\nless submissive to the Germans. On the other hand, he is not likely to\r\nrevolt openly until he is convinced Germany will lose; and the only way\r\nto give him such conviction is for the United States to enter the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What would Hitler do if he finally tired of fooling with Vichy?_\r\n\r\nA. He would simply march in and occupy all of France. He could do\r\nit with a handful of divisions, since the French have been totally\r\ndisarmed or at least as fully disarmed as it was possible for\r\nthe Germans to do. But from then on he would have the trouble of\r\nadministering the whole country and collecting the taxes which Pétain\r\ncollects for him now. I do not think he is anxious to increase his\r\nresponsibilities that way now. Pétain knows this too, and that stiffens\r\nthe old man’s backbone a little. Essentially though the Vichy attitude\r\nwill always depend on the question who is going to win the war. I\r\nshould think that when the defeat of Hitler is assured, the Vichy\r\ngovernment may be overthrown and another or Free French, de Gaulle\r\ngovernment may re-enter the war on our side. Pétain and Darlan it seems\r\nto me are too compromised ever to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What about Darlan?_\r\n\r\nA. Darlan undoubtedly sees more clearly than Pétain, but he is less\r\nhonorable; indeed I have heard highly placed Englishmen who knew\r\nhim intimately curse him with concentrated bitterness as the vilest\r\ntraitor of the lot. Few people would describe Pétain as consciously\r\ndishonorable. Few of the men around Pétain are spared the charge by\r\nFrenchmen who know them best.\r\n\r\nDarlan has no respect from anybody. He has been all his life a\r\npolitical sailor, having had his start from his father, one-time\r\nMinister of Justice. His politics were consistently opportunistic.\r\nToday he helps head a government that has suppressed Freemasonry; yet\r\nhe was a Freemason when to be a Freemason was an asset. He helps keep\r\nLeon Blum in confinement; yet he supported Blum when Blum was in power.\r\nHe is now the fiercest advocate of fighting England; yet until Reynaud\r\nfell he supported the policy of moving the government to North Africa\r\nand carrying on.\r\n\r\nHe switched when he perceived the chance of becoming head man in the\r\nappeasement government. His change of heart was literally overnight.\r\nIn London immediately after the fall of France, an old friend of mine,\r\nan officer of the French Navy whose ship had broken away and come to\r\nEngland, told me Darlan had issued an order to all vessels of the Navy\r\nthat with the signing of the Armistice they should make for French\r\nAfrican or other friendly ports and prepare to go on with the war;\r\ntwenty-four hours later another code message from Darlan countermanded\r\nthe order and directed all ships to make for French ports. In the\r\ninterval Darlan had been promised a seat next to the Chief of the Vichy\r\nState.\r\n\r\nNothing in Darlan’s record indicates that he has ever acted except\r\nfor the purpose of furthering his career; he is characterized by the\r\nFrench as the perfect careerist, and the word has even less flattering\r\nconnotations in French than in English. The one instinct in him\r\nwhich seems to have persisted without variance is his hatred of the\r\nBritish, based upon the centuries-old rivalry of the French and British\r\nnavies. While the French were in the war we Americans forgot that the\r\nmemory of Trafalgar is for the French Navy, or for its older officers\r\nanyway, stronger than the memory of the four years of Franco-British\r\ncomradeship on the battlefields of 1914-1918.\r\n\r\nIn Darlan this feeling was always strong. At the London Naval\r\nConference of 1930 he fought for parity with the British, but they\r\nrefused it to him, with a prescience blessed by the event. Suppose\r\nthe French had possessed as powerful a navy as the British when the\r\nFrench Army fell and Darlan had commanded a force able to challenge\r\nthe British! After the Battle of Oran, July 3, 1940 when the British,\r\nrightly suspecting the intentions of Darlan, attempted to disable the\r\nFrench Fleet at Mers-el Kebir in order to prevent its falling into the\r\nhands of the Germans, Darlan led the outcry against the “perfidious”\r\nassault. The British are convinced that if ever the chance comes Darlan\r\nwill use every means in his power to injure them. Whatever his motives\r\nmay have been at the beginning for joining the capitulation, Darlan\r\nlike most of the men of Vichy has by now so compromised himself with\r\nthe French people that, as one French friend of mine expressed it: “If\r\nGermany is defeated the best these men of Vichy could hope for would\r\nbe dishonorable, furtive retirement, but I think most of them would be\r\nkilled.”\r\n\r\nAnd if Germany wins? For a while Darlan and his colleagues seemed to\r\nfeel confident that Hitler would be good to them, but now he exclaims:\r\n“If we do not get an honorable peace, if France is cut up into many\r\ndepartments and deprived of important overseas territories, and enters\r\ndiminished and bruised into the New Europe, it will not recover and\r\nour children will live in the misery and hatred which breed war.”\r\nThese words of the appeaser indicate that he has already discerned the\r\noutlines of the fate Hitler has in store for France; yet what is the\r\nalternative for him and those like him now? Free Frenchmen declare the\r\nalternative is death, as traitors.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _And Laval?_\r\n\r\nA. He is wounded but he is surely enjoying himself because for the\r\nmoment he can say, “I told you so.” He is probably the world’s most\r\ndelighted observer of the Battle of Russia. My last glimpse of him\r\nwas in Bordeaux at the restaurant “Chapon Fin” the night France\r\ncapitulated. The restaurant was crowded with the wealthy, the powerful,\r\nthe noted and notorious of France. The door was locked; without an\r\nintroduction from at least a Cabinet Minister or a millionaire nobody\r\ncould get in. That night ten thousand refugees were pounding for\r\nadmission to the restaurants of Bordeaux. Our Ambassador to Poland,\r\nTony Biddle, unmarked from his harrowing escape across Poland under\r\nLuftwaffe machine-gun fire, and as fresh here at the collapse of the\r\nworld as though he were attending a bridge party at home, rescued us\r\nand with a gesture which implied we were all ambassadors, requisitioned\r\na table for our party of American newspapermen. From one corner Otto of\r\nHabsburg greeted us in his cordial democratic way. He was one victim\r\nHitler would have liked to catch. I looked around the grotesque dining\r\nroom, decorated as an artificial rock garden of papier-mâché and now\r\npopulated by as queer a throng as ever assembled to dine at the funeral\r\nof a nation. Nearly every French politician I had ever seen was there,\r\nmost of them drinking copiously of the wine for which the city was\r\nfamous. There was no gloom perceptible; not among the Frenchmen. The\r\natmosphere was excited, laughter was frequent and high-pitched. Perhaps\r\nit was bravery; the gay talk and conviviality sounded very courageous\r\nor else very frivolous at that moment. Who could have realized that\r\nthere were Frenchmen there calculating to improve their careers by the\r\nfall of their country? We American newspapermen looked more depressed\r\nthan any of the men whose motherland was about to be strangled.\r\nPresently a waiter brought me a note from Laval inviting me to his\r\ntable. I had not seen him enter. There he was, swarthy, ebony-haired,\r\nwith his famous white string tie, presiding over a company of half\r\na dozen friends, all talking, as everybody in the Western World was\r\ntalking, about the fate of France.\r\n\r\nAbruptly Laval asked, “What do you think, M. Knickerbocker?”\r\n\r\nI spoke with all the emphasis I could muster and placing my fist on\r\nthe table to help express my sincerity talked directly to him: “Mr.\r\nPresident, I think that if you give up, if you surrender, it will\r\nmean the end of France as a nation, the end of France forever unless\r\nanother, outside power comes to your rescue. But Mr. President, if you\r\ngo on fighting, if you refuse to surrender, even if you have to go to\r\nNorth Africa and base your government on Morocco, then France will live\r\nbecause she and her friends will win this war, however long it may\r\ntake. But please believe me, Mr. President, when I say I know what the\r\nNazis mean to do to France, and I know because I have lived for nine\r\nyears in Germany as a professional observer and I know Adolf Hitler,\r\nand the Nazis, and the German people better than I know any politician,\r\nor political party, or people in the world, and I know they mean the\r\nutter destruction of France.”\r\n\r\nThere was dead silence, and to my gratification everybody at the\r\ntable, all of Laval’s friends, nodded in agreement with me, but M.\r\nLaval himself, grave as a judge, leaned back and with that inscrutable\r\nMoorish air of his said, “No, M. Knickerbocker, you do not understand.\r\nHitler does not want to destroy France; Hitler only wants to destroy\r\nthe Soviet Union.”\r\n\r\nThat was Laval’s belief, and because this belief was shared by so many\r\nother Frenchmen, it became one of the principal reasons for the fall of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nWhatever else one may think of him, Laval has guts and is no hypocrite.\r\nHe hates democracy and says so. He is out to promote the fortunes of\r\nM. Laval and admits it. He calls himself a realist; and realistically\r\nhe long ago estimated the strength of France as inadequate to stand\r\nup against Germany. He learned to hate Britain during those long years\r\nwhen every French move to bolster their position against the doubly\r\npowerful Reich was checked by an imbecile British Foreign Office which\r\ncontinued to think that the balance of power required a stronger\r\nGermany and a weaker France. So Laval’s belief in the desirability of a\r\nFranco-German “understanding” was not born of defeat alone.\r\n\r\nHe was the first French Premier to visit Germany after the war. I was\r\nin Berlin when he arrived in the autumn of 1931 with the aging and\r\nfeeble but still brilliant Briand, then Foreign Minister. Bruening was\r\nChancellor and that farsighted benevolent statesman, whom the Allies\r\ncould have helped suppress the growing menace of Hitler, wished to make\r\nthe visit the foundation for a new era of Franco-German friendship. How\r\nfutile his hopes were came to light as the train bearing the French\r\nministers rolled in. I was standing with a small crowd of Germans at\r\nthe foot of the steps of the Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof, and noticed\r\nthat the streets had been cleared and roped off all the way to the\r\nHotel Adlon. Masses of police manned the ropes but there was almost no\r\ncrowd to hold back. Around the station were about five hundred people.\r\nI noticed they looked curiously alike, as though all from the same\r\nneighborhood, the same class. Presently I saw a friend, a plain-clothes\r\nman from Police Headquarters, all dressed up in his Sunday best, with\r\ngloves and a derby hat and the inevitable big detective’s shoes. I\r\ngreeted him. He introduced his wife and children. A little surprised,\r\nI asked if he were such a great advocate of Franco-German friendship\r\nthat he had brought his whole family to cheer the visitors from Paris.\r\n“_Ja wohl!_” he replied. “Orders, you see. They sent us all down here.\r\nEverybody here is from Police Headquarters, _mit Frau und Kinder_.\r\nNobody else; no outsiders. We get a day off for coming.” Sure enough,\r\nthat was the makeup of the entire crowd. They dutifully thronged around\r\nthe steps and shouted “_Hoch Frankreich!_” Laval and Briand then passed\r\nthrough empty streets to the Hotel Adlon where another group of\r\npolicemen and their wives and children cried “_Hoch!_” again. And that\r\nwas the length and breadth and depth of Franco-German friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Has Laval a chance to come back?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, if the Germans win he has the best of chances. Laval today is\r\nthe only master politician left in France; Pétain is senile; Darlan\r\nis ward-heel size; none of the others in the Vichy camp is even that\r\nlarge, and the politicians of the Republic are dead and buried. Laval\r\nis the best-hated Frenchman alive; the shots fired into him by Colette\r\nwere cheered from one end of France to the other, but he is still the\r\nonly Frenchman capable of ruling France as a dictator.\r\n\r\nHe is much like Stalin, an Asiatic, with more than his share of the\r\nEastern blood of the Auvernacs. He has the psychology of the Oriental\r\nand like Stalin he has the Oriental’s lack of human consideration. As\r\nStalin regards Russia without love, as an object, so Laval regards\r\nFrance. He has few real friends but possesses a marvelous power of\r\nextemporized comradeship and can talk the language of any man with whom\r\nhe converses, including, as one of his enemies suggested, “even an\r\nhonest man.” Once a friend of his exclaimed, “You ought to be dictator\r\nof a South American Republic!” “How did you know?” asked Laval,\r\ngenuinely surprised. “Oh, just a joke,” answered the friend. “But no,”\r\nsaid Laval, “I am amazed, because when I was a boy that was just what\r\nI always dreamed of becoming--dictator of a South American state.”\r\nPerhaps he may get his wish yet, as the malicious wits of the Riviera\r\nhave called Vichy France, “a banana republic without bananas.”\r\n\r\nLaval’s hatred of England is extended now to America, because American\r\nsupport upholds Britain, and Laval will never be safe until Britain\r\nis defeated. He is still unwavering in his conviction that Germany\r\nwill win, but even if we entered the war and it became evident Germany\r\nwould lose, Laval cannot now change his position. He is one of those so\r\ntotally committed to the German cause that he stands or falls with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You have said that we Americans were very much like the French; now\r\nin what way are we? Have we also traitors in our ranks?_\r\n\r\nA. No, we have not, I am convinced, any traitors among our officers, as\r\nthe French had. There are many Nazi agents among us, and a few may have\r\npenetrated to positions of some importance, but I do not believe they\r\ncould affect the issue of the war as they did in France. There are many\r\nCommunists as well among us, probably more than there are Nazis, and\r\nwe ought never to forget that whether they are native-born Americans\r\nor not makes no difference. Nor does the fact that Soviet Russia is\r\nmomentarily engaged in fighting our enemy change the essential fact\r\nthat Communists cannot be loyal Americans. Their loyalty is to Moscow\r\nalone, and if a change in Russia’s position should make it expedient\r\nfor the Kremlin to order American Communists to sabotage America’s war\r\neffort, the order would be zealously obeyed.\r\n\r\nOur chief danger of this sort lies in the wrongheaded activity of\r\nour isolationists who, whether they wish it or not, serve the cause\r\nof Hitler more effectively than all the paid agents of Germany and\r\nItaly and Japan could do if their numbers were multiplied many times.\r\nConsider carefully the account given you by my French friend of the\r\nway the Germans appealed to Parisian conservative circles, and ask\r\nyourself if their arguments do not sound remarkably like the speeches\r\nof Lindbergh and Wheeler.\r\n\r\nTreason can be difficult to define. I had a French friend, whom\r\nI can call a friend no longer because he became one of the chief\r\ncollaborationists with the Germans. I think--I am not sure--but I\r\nthink we have no one like him in America, but he was so representative\r\nof the group that betrayed France, that I want to quote a conversation\r\nI had with him just before the war began. I said, “Jean, you seem to\r\nbelieve profoundly that Germany is strong enough to win a war no matter\r\nhow France fights to prevent it; and you also seem to believe that the\r\nGerman kind of National Socialism would be a good thing for the whole\r\ncontinent, including France. Now what would you do, believing as you\r\ndo, if France were to be at war with Germany, and you thought defeat\r\nwas inevitable, and you foresaw a long and bloody conflict, and you\r\nsuddenly found yourself in possession of a military secret which would\r\nend the war immediately in favor of Germany if the Germans knew it.\r\nWould you give this decisive military secret to the Germans?” Jean\r\nanswered, “Yes, of course I would.” “But wouldn’t that be treason?” I\r\nasked. “Not at all,” Jean answered. “It wouldn’t be treason to France;\r\nit would only be a blow at what I consider the treasonable government\r\nof the Republic.” Now I submit that even our rabid isolationists would\r\nreject a position like Jean’s, but we ought nevertheless clearly to see\r\nthe fact that Lindbergh and Wheeler by their powerful discouragement of\r\nthe whole war effort of America are doing this country the same kind of\r\nharm that came to France.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _In what other ways do we compare with the French?_\r\n\r\nA. It is astonishing to see how many points of similarity we can\r\ndiscover, beginning with the well-known Maginot line complex which we\r\nparallel with our Atlantic Ocean complex. I remember back in 1930 at\r\na cocktail party in Berlin a German Lieutenant Colonel remarked to me\r\nabout the Maginot line, which the French were just completing: “That\r\nline of fortifications will be the death of France. If soldiers have\r\nsuch an impregnable fortress to live in, they will never willingly\r\nleave it to take the offensive, and without taking the offensive you\r\ncan’t win a war. The Maginot line will give the French Army a permanent\r\ndefense complex and out of its sense of security we will eventually\r\ndefeat it.” Our complacency behind the Atlantic Ocean, which we fondly\r\nfancy could always protect us from attack, is precisely the same as\r\nthe French had. The French also were brought down by their skepticism;\r\nthey had ceased to have any faith in anything, whether the Republic, or\r\ndemocracy, or God, just as millions of Americans lack faith in anything\r\nand think it smart to deride any kind of ideals, particularly anything\r\nso old-fashioned as sacrifice for one’s country.\r\n\r\nThe French had up to the bitter end, so little primitive, full-blooded\r\nspirit that they neither sang on the way to battle nor cursed while in\r\naction; they harbored no anger toward the enemy, no hatred for him, and\r\nthey had no will to kill. They were apologetic for being at war, until\r\ncatastrophe was upon them, and it was too late. Most Americans feel\r\napologetic about the war and behave as though they were not sure of the\r\nrightness of our cause.\r\n\r\nAnother curious and not unimportant item of coincidence is that there\r\nwas a strong current of anti-British feeling in France at the beginning\r\nof the war, just as there is here. In France it was grounded largely in\r\nthe argument, which had much truth in it, that Great Britain had been\r\nlargely responsible for the war by her shortsighted support of Germany\r\nagainst France for so many years, and that the British would “fight\r\nto the last Frenchman.” This latter argument seemed silly to me when\r\nI first met it early in the Battle of France, at the front near Sedan\r\nwhere I picked up a little printed leaflet in French, dropped by German\r\naviators.\r\n\r\nIt read:\r\n\r\n “Where is Tommy? The units of the British army which had occupied\r\n certain sectors of the Maginot line were immediately withdrawn after\r\n the beginning of the German offensive. They were transported as\r\n quickly as possible in the direction of the Channel. For political\r\n reasons it was necessary to conceal this movement, so it was carried\r\n out at night. Nevertheless the population of Lorraine could observe\r\n easily enough that the English were retiring, and in various cities\r\n and towns hostile demonstrations took place against them. Several\r\n times the police and French troops had to intervene to calm the\r\n crowds and suppress the demonstrations. _French Soldiers!_ You see\r\n how the English are trying to get out just as they did in Norway.\r\n _They are taking ‘English leave.’_ They are leaving you alone on the\r\n battlefield. Are you stupid enough to die for those who are quitting\r\n you to save their precious skins? You had better give the English the\r\n answer they deserve for having betrayed you.”\r\n\r\nNow there was not a word of truth in this propaganda about trouble\r\nbetween British troops and French civilians, and I thought the leaflet\r\nfar too crude to have any effect, but I was mistaken; it corresponded\r\nto the unreasoning feeling of many Frenchmen that the French Army\r\nwas bearing all the burden. They particularly resented the fact that\r\nwhereas at the beginning of the war the French mobilized all men from\r\ntwenty to forty-seven years old, the British at first mobilized only\r\nthose from twenty to twenty-five years old. The British Fleet, the\r\nFrench knew theoretically, was just as important for beating Hitler as\r\nthe French Army, but the British Fleet was far away and its actions\r\nwere unobserved. Just so today in America we all know theoretically\r\nthat the presence of the British Fleet in the Atlantic is imperative\r\nfor our safety, but the British Fleet is far away, and so even when\r\nwe are sending supplies to the British Fleet and other arms standing\r\nbetween us and our enemy, many Americans think of it as “aiding\r\nBritain,” and feel quite unselfish about it.\r\n\r\nA minor group in America also persists in blaming the British so\r\nheavily for their now amply admitted and fully atoned faults of the\r\npast, that some of them would almost rather see Munich revenged by\r\nGerman troops in England than have America defend herself there.\r\nFinally we have our anti-British Americans of Irish origin who\r\nconsider Oliver Cromwell more blameworthy than Hitler, although all\r\nIrish-Americans are not so purblind by any means. Taking it all in\r\nall, however, I should say that there is an even stronger anti-British\r\nsentiment in America today than there was in France during the war, and\r\nthis when coupled to the broader anti-Europe feeling of a great many\r\nAmericans, increases the difficulty of our acting realistically against\r\na powerful enemy who is taking every advantage of these enfeebling\r\nprejudices of ours.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _You have named so many similarities between ourselves and the\r\nFrench that it is discouraging indeed, but we have one undeniable\r\nadvantage of a large population, and we surely are not obsessed by our\r\nbirth rate._\r\n\r\nA. It is true that we do not worry about our birth rate, although\r\nperhaps we ought to, but we suffer just the same from something\r\nvery much like the French obsession with theirs. It was the French\r\npreoccupation with their inferiority in numbers, and their falling\r\nbirth rate, which prevented them not merely from wasting lives, but\r\neven from using them thriftily on the battlefield, and the result\r\nwas the debacle. During the Battle of France I seldom saw Colonel\r\nSchieffer, in the French Ministry of Information, that he did not\r\nexclaim, “We cannot bleed like this again. Twice in a generation is\r\ntoo much. We have only twenty million Frenchmen. This time we must\r\nmake an end of the Boches so they can never empty our veins again.”\r\nThe Colonel, who was personally most warlike, was under the impression\r\nwe all had that the French Army was losing lives heavily, and he was\r\nwilling that it be done to prevent ever again such bloodshed in the\r\nfuture, yet as a matter of fact, the impulse to save French lives had\r\nalready become so strong in the Army High Command that it governed all\r\ngreat decisions and contributed seriously to the defeat.\r\n\r\nNow despite the fact that we are a nation of 130,000,000 we are\r\nobsessed to an equal degree with the fear of having to fight in large\r\nnumbers; we have what amounts to a phobia against sending an American\r\nExpeditionary Force to Europe. We seem not to mind nearly so much the\r\nidea of American boys in the Navy or the Air Force fighting and dying\r\nabroad, but when it comes to the Army we recoil at the idea of an\r\nA.E.F. Why the life of an infantryman should be more precious than that\r\nof an aviator or sailor is not clear. The explanation of this attitude\r\nmust be found in the comparative numbers of men involved.\r\n\r\nA.E.F. brings up the idea of millions of American boys laying down\r\ntheir lives on the battlefield, and most Americans completely forget,\r\nif they ever did know, that although we had 4,355,000 men mobilized\r\nduring the last war, the total number of them killed in action and died\r\nof wounds received in action was 50,475. This is roughly one-half of\r\nthe number of persons killed by accident in the United States every\r\nyear. We nevertheless erected in every village and city of the land\r\nlarge expensive monuments to our war dead, and the impression became\r\nindelibly fixed in the American mind that we had lost millions, or\r\nat any rate hundreds of thousands of dead. The vision of this mass\r\nsacrifice of American youth is what moves the American people to reject\r\nso violently the idea of an expeditionary force. We ought now to be\r\nadult enough to see that our penurious attitude toward our precious\r\nAmerican blood reflects the same feeling as the French, with more\r\njustification, had toward their birth rate, and that if persisted in,\r\nthis attitude will lead us to similar disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Aren’t there any encouraging differences between ourselves and the\r\nunfortunate French?_\r\n\r\nA. I am glad to say there are, and enough, I devoutly hope, to save\r\nus from their fate. We have a leader; the French had none. We are not\r\ndivided as badly as the French were divided. Despite the fierceness of\r\nour political passions, it would be a very exceptional American indeed\r\nwho would say, “I’d rather have Hitler than Roosevelt,” as so many\r\nFrenchmen used to say, “We’d rather have Hitler than Leon Blum.” We are\r\nphysically a healthier people than the French. There is hardly one of\r\nthe weaknesses now perceptible in the American people that would not be\r\nswept away by the fact of our going to war, but there is hardly one of\r\nthem which can be removed by any other means.\r\n\r\nThe most encouraging difference between the French and American\r\ndemocracies is the quality and character of our newspapers. American\r\nnewspapers bring to their readers today a greater volume of news,\r\nof greater accuracy, than has ever been delivered to an audience of\r\nnewspaper readers in the history of the world. It has been my job for\r\nnearly two decades to study the newspapers of a score of countries, not\r\nsuperficially but with the businesslike object of gleaning news. I had\r\nto read thirty-two German newspapers a day when I was correspondent\r\nin Berlin; and a dozen or so daily in Paris. It is no exaggeration\r\nto say that the reader of the _New York Times_, or the _New York\r\nHerald-Tribune_, or the _Chicago Daily News_, or any one of half a\r\ndozen of our great metropolitan dailies, has more detailed and true\r\ninformation about what is going on in the world than if he were able\r\nby magic to accumulate all the newspapers published everywhere else on\r\nearth, and were able equally by magic to read them all in the original.\r\n\r\nOften I am asked, “How can we know the truth? Everything is so\r\nconfusing. Aren’t we fed with propaganda?” The answer is you can know\r\nthe truth by reading your newspapers thoroughly and exercising common\r\nsense in balancing the reports from the belligerent countries against\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nNo war has ever been fought in such a blazing light of information.\r\nNever has such a quantity of news been put before a people as we\r\nAmericans have before us at breakfast every day and from then on until\r\nmidnight. American newspapers are doing today the most superb job ever\r\ndone by daily journals. But that is not their chief merit. Their chief\r\nmerit is their honesty and incorruptibility and their sincere endeavor\r\nto be fair and objective. These qualities have enabled the American\r\npress, since the foundation of the United States, to be the equal in\r\nimportance to the executive or the legislative or the judicial branch\r\nof government. It is the vigilant watchman over the functioning of the\r\nother three branches of government.\r\n\r\nIn no other country has the newspaperman the rights and privileges that\r\nhe has here. He is as important for the preservation of our liberties\r\nand our security as any legislator, judge, or executive. One can almost\r\nformulate a law that one can judge the quality of a democracy and its\r\nexpectancy of life by its press. By that standard France was doomed to\r\nfall. France under the Republic had the most venal newspapers on earth.\r\nAs the American press is honest, so was the French press dishonest. The\r\nFrench government was a faithful reflection of its press, one might\r\nsay almost a creation of its press. Some good Frenchmen even go so far\r\nas to lay the major responsibility for the fall of France on their\r\nnewspapers whose editorial opinions for the most part were as plainly\r\nfor sale as the vegetables in the market.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for their venality go back to the period at the end of\r\nthe nineteenth century when all the states of Europe were floating\r\ngovernment loans in Paris, the banking center of the continent. The\r\nFrench peasant, who kept his gold in his _bas de laine_, his woolen\r\nstocking, was the chief investor, and the French newspapers were the\r\nchief salesmen. Profits from the flotation were so enormous that the\r\ngovernments concerned could afford to pay very large bribes to the\r\nFrench newspapers to recommend their bonds. The French peasants at\r\nthat time believed their newspapers, bought the bonds, and the corrupt\r\nnewspapers grew rich and content. This easy money made it unnecessary\r\nfor them to go out and get advertising, and from that day to this\r\nFrench newspapers have lacked the economic foundation that American\r\nnewspapers have. After the war, the bribes from financial quarters\r\nlargely disappeared and the French newspapers, without advertising, and\r\nwith the habit of venality, became more unscrupulous, because hungrier\r\nthan ever. French newspapermen, worse paid than ever, were reduced to\r\nselling their services cheaper than ever before, and the corruption\r\nbecame almost universal.\r\n\r\nOne famous French correspondent was fired by his famous newspaper\r\nbecause he had taken a bribe from a foreign government--and had failed\r\nto split it with the managing editor. Hardly a newspaper in Paris would\r\nrefuse a subsidy from a foreign government, but all this giving and\r\ntaking of bribes became trivial when Hitler came to power in 1933. From\r\nthen on the French press was inundated with German money, and from then\r\non could be dated the certainty that France would fall.\r\n\r\nI want above all things to emphasize that there were a few honest,\r\ncapable, patriotic, and incorruptible French journalists. It is\r\nsufficient commentary on the Vichy government that most of them had to\r\nflee when the Germans came.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is there any hope for the French? Do you think they can come back?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, because they have learned to hate; the Germans have taught\r\nthem. I know it sounds most un-Christian to insist upon the necessity\r\nof hatred, but the thoughtful will remember that Christ hated evil,\r\nand when he scourged the money-changers from the Temple he did it with\r\nfury. Who will dispute that Hitler is more evil than money-changers in\r\na Temple, and that all the forces of Christianity ought to be ranged\r\ntogether to destroy his hateful power. You cannot win a battle, you\r\ncannot win a war, you cannot win any kind of fight that involves\r\nkilling unless you have the spirit to kill. You cannot have that spirit\r\nunless you are convinced of the justice of your cause, and you know\r\nthat God is on your side, and that God approves your killing your\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThe French never had any such spirit during the war, except perhaps\r\nat the very end, but they have it now. During the war they were all\r\nthe time debating in their hearts whether it would not be better to\r\nquit and make friends with the Germans. They thought in terms of the\r\nlast war. They thought of the Germans as the same sort of human beings\r\nas the Germans of 1870 or of 1914-1918. They simply failed to grasp\r\nthe most important fact in the world of international affairs today,\r\nnamely that the Nazi Germans under Hitler are a new species of creature\r\nnever seen before in modern times, a deliberately amoral species of\r\nmen who reject every tenet of Christianity or of any other religion\r\nwhich enjoins kindness, truth, and justice, and who are possessed of\r\nsuch unique talents for war that they could conceivably achieve their\r\nambition to conquer the world if they were not stopped by a coalition\r\nof all the decent peoples on earth. The French above all failed to\r\ntake seriously Hitler’s cool, considered statement that he intended to\r\nexterminate France as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How about the treatment Hitler has given France so far; he hasn’t\r\ntried to exterminate them, has he?_\r\n\r\nA. No, but Hitler is not through with the French; he has not even begun\r\nto treat them the way he intends to ultimately. There are several\r\nreasons why he has been comparatively lenient to France so far. First,\r\nhe wished to end French resistance immediately in order that the whole\r\nforce of the German Army might be thrown at England. Second, he wished\r\nto lull the French into a belief that by collaborating with the Germans\r\nthey might obtain the “honorable peace” Pétain talks about. Third, he\r\nwished to make it appear to the British and eventually to the Americans\r\nthat surrender to Hitler is not so bad. Finally, he wished to get from\r\nthe Vichy government several important things he either did not dare\r\ndemand or was refused at the Compiègne armistice, chiefly that the\r\nFrench should go to war against Britain or at any rate turn over the\r\nFrench fleet and naval bases to the Germans for use against the British.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you imply that later on Hitler’s treatment of France will be\r\ndifferent?_\r\n\r\nA. I do indeed. He will eventually fulfill the one principle which\r\nhas guided his foreign policy more than any other; to destroy the\r\npower of France _ever_ to threaten Germany again. How could any\r\nFrenchman forget the words of Hitler in _Mein Kampf_ when he wrote:\r\n“We must at last become entirely clear about this: the German people’s\r\nirreconcilable mortal enemy is and remains France”? And again: “The\r\npolitical testament of the German nation ... must read substantially:\r\nSee an attack on Germany in any attempt to organize a military power\r\n[_i.e._, France] on the frontiers of Germany, be it only in the form of\r\nthe creation of a state capable of becoming a military power [_i.e._,\r\nFrance] and in that case regard it not only a right but a duty to\r\nprevent the establishment of such a state [_i.e._, France] by all means\r\nincluding the application of armed force, or in the event that such a\r\none be already founded, to repress it.” So you see what the fate of\r\nFrance is bound to be, now that she has given up her arms and her will\r\nto fight.\r\n\r\nIf left alone her fate will surely be that defined by Churchill in\r\nhis address to the French people while Vichy still hesitated: “I tell\r\nyou truly and what you must believe when I say this evil man, this\r\nmonstrous abortion of hatred and deceit, has resolved on nothing\r\nless than the complete wiping out of the French nation and the\r\ndisintegration of its whole life and future. By all kinds of sly and\r\nsavage means he is plotting and working to crush forever the fountain\r\nof characteristic French culture and French inspiration to the world.\r\nIt is not defeat that France will now be made to suffer at German\r\nhands, but the doom of complete obliteration. Army, navy, air force,\r\nreligions, laws, language, culture, institutions, literature, history,\r\ntradition, all are to be effaced by the brute strength of a triumphant\r\narmy and the scientific low cunning of a ruthless Police Force.”\r\n\r\nThis is true. This will be the fate of France unless the United States\r\nand Britain and Russia defeat Hitler. Of course so long as the French\r\nunder the men of Vichy remain the strictly obedient vassal, Hitler will\r\nhave no need for sharper measures until the time comes for him to shape\r\nFrance into her ultimate permanent role of coolie agricultural colony\r\nof the Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What did Hitler promise Pétain?_\r\n\r\nA. He promised that if Pétain would sign the armistice, very soon\r\nafterward he would give France a permanent and just peace, that German\r\ntroops would evacuate France, and in the New Order of Europe Germany\r\nwould help France become a free and independent partner. All this\r\nwas, however, tacitly contingent on the defeat of Britain. The German\r\nexcuse for not freeing France now is that the battle against Russia and\r\nBritain is still going on. France meanwhile is compelled to suffer in\r\na slavery worse than she ever suffered in her entire national history.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What do you mean by the term “slavery”? The French people are not\r\nbeing driven about in slave gangs, are they, with an overseer carrying\r\na black-snake whip and all that as in_ Uncle Tom’s Cabin_? I understood\r\nthe Germans were behaving very “correctly.”_\r\n\r\nA. It is true that only the prisoners of war, who still number about\r\na million and a half, are in this literal, physical sense enslaved.\r\nThe rest of the French people, though, are just as much the slaves of\r\nthe Germans as if they were housed in slave pens and driven to work\r\nin chains. Why? Because they must give up to their German masters\r\nall the fruits of their labors except a bare subsistence. The French\r\npeople have been paying the Germans an indemnity of roughly ten million\r\ndollars a day, or $3,650,000,000 a year, and with this money the\r\nGermans have been buying from the French, who are forced to sell, all\r\nthe property of any value in the country, from objects of art to great\r\nindustrial plants. Consider the size of this indemnity. The maximum\r\nyearly reparations payment Germany had to make after the last war was\r\n$600,000,000. That is one sixth of what the French have had to pay in\r\nthe first twelve months of German rule in this war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How was this indemnity fixed?_\r\n\r\nA. In the armistice agreement which Pétain so trustfully signed, it\r\nwas stipulated that the French would pay for the cost of maintaining\r\nthe German Army in France. No sum was named. You can imagine the\r\nastonishment of the French when, after they had laid down their arms\r\nand there was no possibility of refusing, they learned they had to\r\npay the Germans 400,000,000 francs, or roughly $10,000,000 a day. It\r\nwill give you some notion of the difference between the old-fashioned\r\nGerman conqueror and the new-fashioned Nazi to recollect that after\r\nthe Franco-German War of 1870 Bismarck exacted a _total_ indemnity of\r\n$1,250,000,000, or one-third of what the French of today are forced to\r\npay _yearly_.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How does this French payment compare with the total amounts Germany\r\npaid for reparation after the last war?_\r\n\r\nA. The maximum estimate of German reparations payments in cash and kind\r\nis about $5,000,000,000, which is almost precisely the amount of money\r\nAmericans lent Germany and never got back. It is the literal truth\r\nthat Germany paid no reparations. The United States paid them. I was a\r\ncorrespondent in Germany during all those crucial years from the French\r\noccupation of the Ruhr onward, and most of us who were on the spot\r\nagree that despite the dislocation of wealth in Germany the country as\r\na whole had not lost wealth through payment of reparations, since for\r\nevery dollar that went to France or England, an American dollar came in.\r\n\r\nAll critics of the Versailles treaty insist that its worst feature was\r\nthe reparations, but if you keep in mind the fundamental fact that the\r\nGermans borrowed (and never repaid) every cent they used to meet the\r\nreparations claims, the Versailles treaty and the German complaints\r\nabout it take on a very different aspect. This is so important that it\r\ncannot be overemphasized, because one of the principal reasons why the\r\nUnited States withdrew from the peace and why England and eventually\r\nFrance relaxed their vigilance and permitted Germany to arm and grow\r\ninto the terrible power she is today, was the feeling that the Germans\r\nafter all had been treated unjustly.\r\n\r\nYou could make a case for the argument that our own “guilt complex”\r\nabout Versailles allowed Hitler to tear up the treaty and finally\r\nattack the world. Paul Birdsall has pointed out that this “guilt\r\ncomplex” received powerful encouragement from John Maynard Keynes,\r\nwho correctly analyzed the economic impossibility of the reparations\r\nclauses, but went on from there to condemn the whole treaty as a\r\nCarthaginian peace. It has taken Hitler, who climbed to power on his\r\ndenunciation of Versailles, to show us how lenient a peace it was.\r\n\r\nRemembering that the Germans actually paid no reparations, it is\r\ninstructive to examine what they formally paid in comparison with\r\nwhat they are now extorting from the French. The Allies at the London\r\nconference in April 1921 fixed their demands on Germany for “damage\r\ndone to civilians” at $33,000,000,000--which at the time was considered\r\ninsanely high, but incidentally is $11,000,000,000 less than the\r\n$44,000,000,000 the United States has now appropriated and recommended\r\nfor national defense. Isn’t this a startling confirmation of the\r\nmistake the American Congress made in repudiating the League of Nations\r\nand refusing to ratify the security treaty with England and France?\r\n\r\nIt is fantastic to realize that we could have paid the entire bill\r\nfor the last war and if by so doing we could have prevented this war,\r\nwe would still have saved money. We will eventually learn that the\r\nisolationists’ or appeasers’ program for America is not only the most\r\ndangerous but infinitely the most costly. France has certainly learned\r\nhow true this is.\r\n\r\n_At the rate they are now paying, the French will have paid the Germans\r\nin about seventeen months an amount equivalent to all the reparations\r\npayments ($5,000,000,000) made by the Germans with American money in\r\nthe twelve years during which the Germans pretended to pay._ They\r\nstopped even the pretense of payment you remember after the Lausanne\r\nConference in 1932, even before Hitler came to power. This immense\r\nindemnity the French are paying now is merely an interim payment for\r\nthe alleged cost of maintaining the German Army. Actually the cost of\r\nmaintaining the army is estimated to be not 400,000,000 but 125,000,000\r\nfrancs, so that the Germans have a surplus of 275,000,000 francs or\r\naround $7,000,000 for their daily “purchases.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why did the Germans select the figure 400,000,000 francs daily?_\r\n\r\nA. Because this was the amount the French were spending on the war.\r\nIn their 1940 war budget they allocated 106 billion francs to the air\r\nforce, 36 billion to the army, and 15 billion to the navy, making a\r\ntotal of 157 billion, which is roughly 400,000,000 francs a day. Hitler\r\nreckoned if the French could afford to spend this sum on fighting the\r\nGermans, they could spend the same amount to feed, clothe, transport,\r\nlodge, amuse, and otherwise support the Germans as they are doing now.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But if the French were spending this much money on the war anyway,\r\nhow are they economically worse off by continuing the same expenditure?_\r\n\r\nA. They are incomparably worse off because formerly the proceeds\r\nof this sum were consumed by Frenchmen; today they are consumed by\r\nGermans. The money formerly circulated throughout the French economic\r\nbody as healthy blood; today it is sucked and swallowed by the vast\r\nGerman leech. Furthermore the French expenditure on the war did not\r\ncease with their defeat; they still have large expenses besides their\r\ntribute to Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What means do the Germans use to buy up French businesses? Why\r\ndon’t the French refuse to sell?_\r\n\r\nA. Some of them do, but the Germans always have the power to force them\r\nto sell.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why do the Germans bother to go through the form of buying, if they\r\ncan confiscate whatever they want?_\r\n\r\nA. Because they can get what they want with much less trouble and in\r\nbetter shape and be able to make better use of it if they go through\r\nthe form of purchase. They had their whole system of plundering France\r\nworked out before the war. During the prewar period thousands of\r\nGermans crisscrossed France, as tourists or traveling salesmen. They\r\nlocated the most desirable industrial or other properties, nearly all,\r\nincidentally, in the rich Northern half now Occupied France. When the\r\nGermans came in they rushed a specially trained corps of experts to\r\nall the banks and business houses, embargoed banking transactions and\r\nordered every security holder in France to give a list of his property.\r\nSoon they knew the precise financial position of every important\r\ncorporation or individual in France. With this knowledge they were able\r\nto buy into the control of all the businesses they wanted. Sometimes if\r\nthe French owner refused to sell, the Germans could make the owner’s\r\nbank foreclose on his loan and thus force the owner to raise money\r\nby selling a share of his business. The Germans were modest; usually\r\nthey wanted only 51 per cent. Sometimes the Germans would withhold\r\nraw materials from a stubborn industrialist. Sometimes the German\r\nauthorities forcibly confiscated the property; just often enough to\r\nremind Frenchmen that, if they liked, the Germans could take every\r\nmachine, sack of flour, and stick of furniture in the country without\r\nrecompense.\r\n\r\nAnother most effective weapon used by the Germans to force the French\r\nto sell their businesses is the German edict that all concerns, from\r\nshops to factories, must remain open and keep their full roll of\r\nemployees. Since almost no business is being done, and most concerns\r\nwould normally have closed, this rule drives most businessmen into\r\nbankruptcy, as it was intended to do. By these and other similar means,\r\nthe Germans, using the francs paid them by the French, have gone far\r\ntoward buying “legal” control of the most valuable property in France.\r\nWith appalling swiftness the French people are being pauperized and\r\nreduced to slaves in what used to be their own homes.\r\n\r\nThey are like the Negroes on a pre-Civil War plantation in our own\r\nSouth. The Germans, like the white folks, live in the big house, eat\r\ncaviar and chicken, drink the wonderful wines of France, clothe their\r\nwomen with the creations of the great couturiers, and promenade the\r\nBoulevards while the French people, half-starving, broken, humiliated,\r\nwork desperately hard to support their masters. The French are now not\r\neven being treated as well as slaves under a master considerate enough\r\nto wish to keep his slaves in good health and fit working order. I\r\nshould think it would be fair to say that out of an eight-hour day the\r\nFrenchman today has to devote four hours to working for the Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _If these are the interim armistice terms imposed on France, what\r\nwill the final terms of peace be like?_\r\n\r\nA. You can be sure that the German demands will be limited only by the\r\ntotal wealth of France. We know Hitler intends the total productive\r\nwealth of the country to pass into German hands. Without waiting for\r\npeace, the Germans are, as we noted, already systematically stripping\r\nFrance of her movable valuables and taking them to Germany, and\r\nbuying control of the immovable property they want. But if the time\r\never comes, when Hitler makes a so-called peace with France, we may\r\nexpect that he will take pleasure in basing his demands partly on the\r\nVersailles treaty.\r\n\r\nHe will first demand that the reparations Germany paid after the last\r\nwar be paid back; then he will demand full compensation for the German\r\nmerchant and fishing fleets, and the railroad equipment, cattle, etc.,\r\nturned over to the Allies after the last war to make up for similar\r\nitems seized by the Germans; he will demand replacement of all the\r\nshipping Germany was compelled to build for the Allies to take the\r\nplace of the ships sunk by the Imperial Navy; he will bill the Allies\r\nfor the coal Germany delivered the Allies to replace the coal taken\r\nfrom the mines of Northern France during the war. After the broad\r\ncategory of claims from the last war has been put down, Hitler will\r\nthen ask for reparations for this war, and of course he can set any sum\r\nhe likes.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But why should Hitler take so much trouble to claim formal\r\nreparations? Since he obviously intends permanently to cripple his\r\nvictim, why should he bother to go through the legalistic form of\r\nitemizing his claims?_\r\n\r\nA. Because that is the way Hitler and his Nazis always do things. The\r\nGerman, even the Nazi, is an orderly fellow. The first principle of\r\nall Germans is “_Ordnung muss sein._” Aside from that, or above it, is\r\nthe fact that Hitler, deeply conscious of the illegality of all his\r\nactions, beginning with the seizure of power, has always insisted on\r\nclothing everything he does with the appearance of lawfulness. When he\r\nseized power he did it by banning the Communist and then the Socialist\r\nparties from the Reichstag, and thus obtaining a majority vote in the\r\nReichstag. Whenever he attacks a nation he announces a long list of\r\nreasons, backed sometimes by an extraordinary array of documents, many\r\nof them forged, to prove he not only had a right to attack but was\r\ncompelled to do so.\r\n\r\nThis necessity for self-justification explains also one of the\r\nqueerest Nazi practices in their torture chambers. When they have\r\nfinished torturing a victim, they invariably make him sign a statement\r\ntestifying that he had been well treated. One would think since the\r\nNazi power is absolute, they would not care, or bother to take this\r\ntrouble, but they seem to be under a profound compulsion to make this\r\ngesture toward the justice they have in practice abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is the use of our maintaining diplomatic relations with Vichy?\r\nIn view of all that you have said I should think we ought to withdraw\r\nour recognition of Vichy and transfer it to de Gaulle and the Free\r\nFrench._\r\n\r\nA. I suppose the chief reason we do not break diplomatic relations\r\nwith Vichy is the same reason why we have not broken formal relations\r\nwith Germany: in both cases we wish to keep a diplomatic observer on\r\nthe scene. That is understandable in the case of Germany, since we\r\nare only formally at peace with her, and are morally at war and all\r\nthe world knows it. In other words, until we begin to shoot, it would\r\nnot make much difference whether we broke relations with Germany or\r\nnot. But in the case of Vichy, it would make a world of difference if\r\nwe took our recognition away from Pétain and gave it to de Gaulle. It\r\nis true that de Gaulle is actually in control of only some central\r\nAfrican French territory while Pétain nominally rules all France, but\r\nwe have continued our recognition of all the governments in exile and\r\nrefused any kind of recognition to the Quislings and Rexists, and in\r\nthis spirit we ought to withdraw our recognition from Pétain. It would\r\nimmensely hearten the Free French to have our recognition and if we\r\nextended Lease-Lend aid to de Gaulle’s forces it could have important\r\nmilitary consequences. However, I suppose Washington is still hoping\r\nagainst hope that we may one day be able to gain some profit from\r\nhaving treated Pétain as well as we have. I personally do not believe\r\nwe ever will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is the greatest danger we face as a nation?_\r\n\r\nA. Our complacency. It is colossal, cosmic, suicidal.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Can you still call us complacent after we have conscripted an\r\nArmy, begun to create an Air Force, gone far toward building a\r\ntwo-ocean Navy, flung a line of outposts from Iceland to South America,\r\nappropriated and recommended fifty billion dollars for defense, and\r\ntold our Navy to sink German fighting ships?_\r\n\r\nA. The very list you name reeks with complacency. All of that put\r\ntogether does not equal a week of what even the “despised” Russians\r\nare doing now. The bitterest thing yet said about us was: “Better a\r\nBolshevik who kills Germans than a Democrat who kills time.” We still\r\nunwaveringly and unblushingly expect somebody else to do the job for\r\nus. Now it is Russia.\r\n\r\nTo begin with we said France and England would do the job; then Norway;\r\nthen the Low Countries; then the Balkans; and now we sit back and\r\nactually rely on the Russians. We cheer the news that the Navy is\r\ngoing to fight but shrink at the idea of an American Expeditionary\r\nForce. Why? For the same reason that war with Japan has many more\r\nadvocates than war with Germany, because we could leave a sea war to\r\nthe professional fighting men of the Navy. We shirk calling things by\r\ntheir proper names. Never have we used so many weasel words. Conscripts\r\nare “selectees”; naval war is “hunting pirates”; hiring the British\r\nto do our fighting for us is “lease-lend”; isolationists become\r\n“noninterventionists”; interventionists argue tediously for “all-out\r\naid,” but few of them ever come out plainly and say we ought to go to\r\nwar. All of this evasion stems from the refusal to face the supreme\r\nreality, namely that we have to go to war, that it is our war and was\r\nour war from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But haven’t we gone far toward recognizing that it is our war by\r\nour lease-lend appropriations of around thirteen billion dollars?_\r\n\r\nA. Do you realize that we actually delivered only $190,000,000 worth\r\nof goods in the first six months of lease-lend to Britain and China?\r\nThat is only a little over one per cent of the total lease-lend money\r\ninvolved. If it takes us six months to deliver one per cent, how\r\nlong will it take to deliver 100 per cent? Certainly, the beginning\r\nis slowest; certainly speed of deliveries will increase almost\r\ngeometrically after the new factories begin to produce. But the fact\r\nis that we will never produce enough to win this war without going\r\nformally to war. As Donald M. Nelson, chief defense buyer, suggested,\r\nthe only way to get capacity production for armaments is to make the\r\nprogram so big that civilian needs will be irresistibly pushed into the\r\nbackground, and every factory capable of producing armaments will be\r\nforced to drop its civilian business and go immediately to work on war\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nWhat does “pushing our civilian needs into the background” mean?\r\nIt means sacrifice; it means a lowering of our standard of living.\r\nDo you know anyone, have you a single person in your acquaintance\r\nin civilian life, whose standard of living has deteriorated as a\r\nresult of sacrifice for our so-called defense effort? Leaf through\r\nyour smart magazines, read the news of the shops, and ask yourself\r\nwhat the fighting folk of Europe would think of the war effort of a\r\ncountry whose rugged males in the bloody autumn of 1941 are asked in\r\nfull-page advertisements: “Have you seen the new brown diamonds for\r\nmen? These interesting, subdued stones are rapidly becoming a major\r\nitem in the well-dressed man’s wardrobe.” Would this make very good\r\nevidence against Hitler’s assertion that we are a “decadent, degenerate\r\ndemocracy not to be taken seriously in war”?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But how can we expect to improve morale by criticism? Isn’t it true\r\nthat if you tell a healthy man he looks ill, and tell him frequently\r\nenough, he may actually fall ill?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, but if you tell an ill man he looks well, and he therefore\r\nfails to take care of himself, he may die. It is not fear that we need;\r\nit is awareness. What was the common cause of the death of the fifteen\r\nnations which have fallen to Hitler? It was lack of awareness of his\r\nthreat to their national existence. From Poland to Greece they were\r\nall overconfident and hence for six long years did nothing to bring\r\nabout that coalition which might have saved them. Overconfidence is our\r\ndanger, not defeatism. The moment our Navy was given orders to convoy\r\nand shoot, one prominent voice was raised to suggest that now we might\r\ndiminish our Army, as though the war were virtually won.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Our morale is very bad, then?_\r\n\r\nA. No, that is not true. Our morale is high. That sounds like a\r\ncontradiction but it is not. It is my conviction after talking to\r\naudiences all over the country that the American people are eager\r\nto find out the truth and when they hear it they are eager to act;\r\nthat they are far ahead of their leaders in Congress, and even of the\r\nPresident; and that if the President wanted it, he could get directly\r\nfrom the American people, not from Congress, but from the twenty-seven\r\nmillion Americans who voted for him, plus many million more, approval\r\nof any measure he advocated, including a formal declaration of war.\r\nNational morale depends so much on leadership that a great figure, as\r\nRoosevelt in this country and Churchill in England, can influence it to\r\ngreat decisions with one broadcast.\r\n\r\nBut without leadership we soon sink back into smug apathy, and the kind\r\nof thoughtlessness which led Americans in the first six months of 1941\r\nto buy 35 per cent more automobiles, 42 per cent more refrigerators,\r\nand 51 per cent more electric ranges than in the same period of\r\n1940--all of these luxury articles being built of materials vital for\r\nour defense industry. The French too, right up to the collapse, went on\r\neating tremendous meals, loafing behind their Maginot line, and reading\r\nillustrated magazines with pictures just like ours showing magnificent\r\nfleets of planes and tanks. An unwitting reader of some of our great\r\nperiodicals would get the impression that we have one of the world’s\r\nmost powerful tank armies and that our warplanes could darken the\r\nskies. We lay down the magazine with a sigh of content. Good old U.S.A.\r\nWe knew we could do it. What was all that talk about unpreparedness?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Haven’t we a tank army?_\r\n\r\nA. We have four armored divisions now being organized. We see them\r\nunder such titles as “Uncle Sam’s Mighty Tanks Move Into Action,” and\r\nonly the closest examination of the picture reveals that most of the\r\ntanks are armored cars. In 1940 we produced 20 light, no medium, and\r\nno heavy tanks a month; in 1941, 260 light, 130 medium, and no heavy\r\ntanks a month; and in 1942 we shall produce 390 light, 300 medium, and\r\nstill no heavy tanks a month. I quote from an authoritative release of\r\nJuly 4, 1941: “None of the four existing armored divisions is regarded\r\nas complete and ready for combat on the European scale because medium\r\nand heavy tanks have not arrived yet, and because _coordinated practice\r\nwith the air arm regularly attached to the divisions has not yet been\r\npossible_ and because much of the training time must be devoted to\r\nthe basic training of new men.” There is the mechanized force of the\r\nUnited States of America in the third year of the mechanized world war.\r\nOur armored strength consists of light tanks only, completely useless\r\nagainst heavy or medium tanks. But most appalling is the revelation\r\nthat this late in a war in which every victory has been won by the\r\nfamous dive bomber plus tank team, we seem not to possess any such team\r\nat all, for that must be the meaning of the statement that there has\r\nbeen no practice of coordination between planes and tanks. These teams\r\ncannot be improvised. An army without them today is like an army would\r\nhave been without artillery yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn effect we still do not possess an effective armored force and the\r\nproduction figures indicate we shall not have one in 1942 either, for\r\nuntil we have heavy tanks we cannot face heavy tanks. What have the\r\nGermans in the way of mechanized armament? We cannot tell what changes\r\nhave taken place since the Battle of Russia began, but we know that\r\ntheir losses are constantly replenished from the industrial plants of\r\nall Europe now working feverishly for the Germans. At the Battle of\r\nFrance the Germans had ten Panzer divisions and it was these steel hack\r\nsaws which cut the body of France into bleeding ribbons and ended the\r\nFrench nation in five weeks. The Germans captured from the French 4,000\r\nor 5,000 tanks and since that time have produced incessantly until it\r\nis estimated that they entered the Battle of Russia with a total of 20\r\nto 30 Panzer divisions and with at least 25,000 tanks. The German Army\r\nis obviously the army we are preparing to fight. Its armored strength\r\nis conservatively estimated about twenty-five times ours, and it has\r\nmore than two years of battle experience. We not only have not got an\r\narmy that could take part in modern warfare at all, but we are not even\r\npreparing to create such an army. We may get one. We will get one if\r\nwe have time. We will get an army if we go to war in time to keep the\r\nBritish between us and our enemy for the period it will take to build\r\nan army. We will never get an army so long as we are satisfied with\r\nwhat we have.\r\n\r\nWe American people have been like a neurotic who refuses to listen to\r\nbad news; who will not go to a physician for fear of what he may find\r\nout. We could afford to view the matter less darkly if it appeared\r\nthat our production would give us an effective fighting machine\r\nsometime in the future, but this does not seem to be the case. Our\r\ngun production indicates that we expect to be ready to fight a modern\r\narmy sometime around the 1950’s. It shows that in the middle of 1941\r\nwe had a production of 4 big, 29 medium, and 20 small antiaircraft\r\nguns per month. At that rate it would take a year to make enough\r\nantiaircraft guns to guard New York City alone. In mid-1942 we shall,\r\nif we are lucky, have a production of 22 big, 23 medium, and 300 small\r\nantiaircraft guns monthly. At this rate we should be able properly to\r\nguard the large cities of the Eastern seaboard in about ten years.\r\n\r\nIn 1941 we did not produce any 155 mm. cannon, but we will make\r\nfourteen of them monthly in 1942; just as we produced no 105 mm. cannon\r\nin 1940, but put out 22 per month in 1941 and in 1942 hope to make 155\r\na month. At this rate we ought to be able to finish enough artillery\r\nto match the German artillery in about 1951. We are still turning out\r\n37 mm. antitank guns, although tests have shown that this gun will not\r\npenetrate the armor of the tanks it would have to meet. Even our famous\r\nGarand rifle apparently cannot be manufactured anything like fast\r\nenough to supply the growing army. In mid-1941 it was being turned out\r\nat the rate of 22,500 a month; and in 1942 it is due to be produced at\r\nthe rate of 52,000 a month. That is only 624,000 a year. At this rate\r\nit would take well over three years to equip the two-million-man army\r\nwhich is our initial goal in the face of the fact that the forces it is\r\nbeing built to meet number upward of ten million.\r\n\r\nIn airplanes we have the one advantage that we came so late into the\r\nfield that we have few obsolescent types. The British and Germans\r\nhave the immense advantage of daily contact with battle experience.\r\nIn mid-1941 we produced 206 fighters and 60 bombers per month for\r\nourselves and sent an average of 390 planes monthly to Britain. Our aid\r\nto Britain, “all out, short of war,” amounted to this, that after two\r\nyears of war we were sending Britain about one-eighth as many warplanes\r\nas Germany’s production, believed to be around 3,000 a month. Even in\r\n1942 when we shall have reached capacity production, we expect to send\r\nBritain only 650 planes a month, and to make only 600 bombers and 600\r\nfighters monthly for ourselves. That is, even in the third year of war\r\nwe propose to have a production of only about three-quarters the German\r\nproduction. We have pitched our sights far too low. We might as well\r\nquit if we cannot set the sights up.\r\n\r\nRaymond Swing always tells me as he rakes in the pot, “Knick, it is\r\nnot good hands that win in poker; it is better hands.” So it is in\r\nthis war. We shall never win with a good army, navy, and air force;\r\nthey have to be better than the enemy’s and bigger too. Before the\r\nBattle of Russia some military critics held that we did not need even\r\nthe 1,500,000 men we now have under arms; that we needed only a highly\r\nmechanized force. Now we see that to win in this war an army needs mass\r\nas well as machines. As yet we have neither.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why haven’t we at any rate planned an adequate army of four or five\r\nmillion men with at least as many armored divisions as the Germans?_\r\n\r\nA. Because to plan an adequate army would indicate we intended to go\r\nto war. To make it big enough and well enough equipped to fight the\r\nGermans would indicate that we intended to fight the Germans. The\r\nconsequence of our ostrich hypocrisy, our faint-hearted catering to the\r\npacifist, isolationist-obscurantist bloc is that we not only do not\r\nbut we cannot build an army to perform the function for which it was\r\ncalled into existence: fight the Nazis. If we equip it to go abroad, up\r\ngo cries of alarm from the Wheeler-Lindbergh crowd: “Foreign war! See,\r\nthe President is going to put us into a foreign war!”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But if we have nothing to fight with, how can we go to war?_\r\n\r\nA. Only by going to war can we guarantee the continued existence of the\r\nBritish fighting machine and the control of the Atlantic by the British\r\nNavy and our own. As long as the Atlantic is thus controlled we can arm\r\nourselves in safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But why can’t we arm ourselves, as we are now doing, without going\r\nto war, and after we are thoroughly prepared, then, if it is still\r\nnecessary, go in and win? Wouldn’t that be more sensible?_\r\n\r\nA. No, because until we go to war we shall never arm ourselves\r\nadequately or send to Britain and Russia anything like the supplies\r\nwe would send if we went to war. Second, if we do not go to war at\r\nonce there exists always the possibility of German victory. Although\r\nthe German Army is busy for the time being in Russia, Hitler knows he\r\nhas to conquer Britain to win. He intends to return to the Battle of\r\nBritain. The Battle of the Atlantic is constantly going on. Events move\r\nwith such lightning speed in this war that a sudden overwhelming Hitler\r\nvictory is still quite conceivable. Beaverbrook only the other day said\r\nhe was convinced Hitler still intended to try to invade the British\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you think Hitler could succeed in invading Britain?_\r\n\r\nA. If Hitler is willing to lose half a million or a million men in a\r\nsuper-Blitz--and we know that he is quite willing to invest that many\r\nmore German lives in his dream of 1,000 years of Nazi Empire--even\r\nBritish authorities admit he might get a foothold in England. The\r\nGerman tactics would probably be similar to the attack on Crete, except\r\nthat against the British Isles they would try many more landings by\r\nsea. Everything would be on a gigantic scale. The air bombardment to\r\nprecede the attempt would surpass anything experienced in the Blitz\r\nof the autumn of 1940 which I witnessed. In this super-Blitz the\r\nGermans would attempt to paralyze the R.A.F. They were not able to do\r\nit before. The R.A.F., as Churchill said, won the climacteric victory\r\nof the First Battle of Britain by knocking down three German planes\r\nto every one they lost, and in that fight the Germans outnumbered the\r\nBritish three to one. But if Hitler gets the airplane factories of\r\nRussia, to add to the production of the French, Czech, Belgian, and\r\nGreater German production, is there anyone who would undertake to prove\r\nthat he could not concentrate in one furious attack more force than\r\neven the dauntless R.A.F. could repel?\r\n\r\nThe Germans can never beat the British but they might suffocate them.\r\nHitler so far has never used more than 500 or 600 warplanes in a single\r\nattack on England. Suppose he uses 5,000. Why has he not done this\r\nbefore? Every aviation and military authority I talked with during the\r\nBlitz in England was baffled at this. There were scores of guesses. The\r\nmost popular answer now is that the Germans did not have the airfields\r\nfrom which to launch so many planes at once. This is a limiting factor\r\nin air warfare which is now given great weight. It is pointed out that\r\nit takes a huge airfield to send off 100 planes. It is even argued\r\nthat the British are bound to lose the war eventually because their\r\nisland can accommodate only a restricted number of airfields, which\r\nfix an upper limit for their R.A.F., while the Germans can build an\r\nindefinitely large force. Since the First Battle of Britain the Germans\r\nhave had plenty of time to build airfields from Norway to France\r\nsufficient to take care of the air fleets of all the world. We know\r\nthey have built many secretly along the coast of Northern France and\r\nthe Low Countries. Hitler’s tactic of surprise would lead him to keep\r\nthem in reserve for the great invasion. Few observers would exclude the\r\npossibility that the Germans may be able to use thousands of planes in\r\nthe Second Battle of Britain where they used hundreds in the first.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why doesn’t Hitler use poison gas?_\r\n\r\nA. I am convinced he will use it whenever he becomes desperate. Why has\r\nhe not used it before? The British know he has vast quantities of it.\r\nHe may be afraid of reprisals. When he uses gas at all I should think\r\nit would be in a once-for-all storm. Imagine what the effect of a giant\r\nattack with a heavy gas might be on London where as many as 4,000,000\r\npersons sleep in underground shelters. The English have virtually\r\nceased to carry gas masks. At the beginning of the war not one person\r\nin a hundred appeared on the streets of London without one. Today not\r\none person in fifty carries one.\r\n\r\nHitler would probably not use gas at all except as a part of a knockout\r\nblow so violent that the British would not have a chance to strike\r\nback. Whatever the outcome, it is possible that such a mass gas assault\r\nmight kill hundreds of thousands in one night. While the gas attack\r\nwas being poured upon the large cities, in the hope also of wiping\r\nout the government and other leaders in urban headquarters, swarms of\r\nflat-bottomed scows and other vessels would put out from the coasts\r\nof the Channel and the North Sea, to make for landings at perhaps\r\na dozen different places, anywhere along the coast of both England\r\nand Scotland. Some of these objectives would be feigned to divert\r\nEnglish defense forces from the real ones, which might number five or\r\nsix. Meanwhile great numbers of parachute troops would be landed to\r\ncapture British airfields and hold them long enough for troop planes\r\nand gliders to land reinforcements, and these landings would also be\r\nattempted at the immediate rear of the coastal points where the German\r\ntroops were coming in by sea.\r\n\r\nBritish authorities admit that it would be a serious matter if the\r\nGermans could establish one or more such bridgeheads on the coast and\r\nland heavy tanks, for the British even yet are not satisfactorily\r\nequipped with this indispensable weapon. The British believe they\r\ncould concentrate and recapture any points seized by the Germans, but\r\nwho knows? Crete showed what could be done with air-borne troops, and\r\nalthough the British Isles would be in most respects more difficult to\r\ncapture than Crete, they would not be in all respects. The Germans are\r\nmuch nearer the British Isles, and could concentrate many times the\r\nforce they used on Crete.\r\n\r\nIf the invasion of Britain ever takes place, Hitler will doubtless make\r\nit a win-the-war or lose-the-war battle, on a scale of the highest\r\nconcentrated violence. Neither side will hold back reserves, as the\r\nR.A.F. did even in the worst days of the 1940 Blitz, because they were\r\nwaiting to use their last fighters and bombers against the expected\r\ninvaders. The British Navy will drive regardless of mines or submarines\r\nthrough the narrow waters of the Channel to throw itself between the\r\ninvaders and the island. The odds would still be on the British to win,\r\nin my judgment. They are in an incomparably stronger position than in\r\n1940 when after Dunkirk they were practically weaponless. Today they\r\nhave two to three million first-class, well-equipped, and well-trained\r\ntroops and over a million Home Guards on the island; their coast\r\ndefenses, as I have seen on visits around the island, are formidable\r\nand deep; the R.A.F. is present in full strength on its home bases,\r\nand the British claim it is growing steadily stronger relative to the\r\nLuftwaffe; and the Royal Navy, sallying from its home ports, here\r\nhas the protection of air forces which were not available at Crete.\r\nFinally, the British would be defending their homes, and this lends an\r\nastonishing extra strength to fighting men. I would not like to be a\r\nmember of the German Army trying to occupy and pacify England. At the\r\nschool of Cad’s Warfare, run by Tom Wintringham outside of London, they\r\nhave taught the old fellows and the youngsters in the Home Guard many\r\nodd and useful tricks, from the best way to strangle a German sentry\r\nfrom behind, to the best way to stab a German sentry from in front.\r\n\r\nEven if the chances are in favor of the British, there are so many\r\nsurprises in war, and especially in this war, that it would be folly\r\nfor us to behave as though we knew Britain would win without us. If she\r\nfalls, we must be prepared to meet the whole German war machine alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Is it true that the Germans once tried to invade Britain and failed\r\nas we heard rumored here?_\r\n\r\nA. I am convinced those rumors were without foundation; I do not think\r\nthe Germans have ever tried to invade the British Isles. I remember\r\nthe September story. I was in England then and about mid-September I\r\nlearned that the highest British authorities believed the invasion\r\nmight come at any moment. With the invincible Virginia Cowles we went\r\n“Looking for Trouble” and motored to Dover and spent a week along the\r\ncoast, in constant contact with the British military authorities. We\r\nheard not a whisper of the yarn about invasion until later in London\r\nwhen rumors came from the continent that the R.A.F. had broken up a\r\nfleet of German invasion vessels and drowned or burned with flaming\r\noil on the surface of the sea thousands of German soldiers. Now it is\r\nperfectly possible that the R.A.F. may have surprised and thus treated\r\nGerman invasion vessels engaged in maneuver or in moving from one\r\nport to another, but it is out of the question that it should have\r\nbeen a serious attempt at invasion. When that happens there will be\r\n500,000 Germans concerned, not 50,000, and there will be no attempt at\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\nThe decisive consideration is that if the Germans had tried an invasion\r\nand the British had beaten it back, the British would have been\r\ncertain to advertise their victory as widely as possible. But British\r\nauthorities never said anything about a repulsed invasion attempt. We\r\nmay be sure that when and if the invasion attempt comes, there will be\r\nno question about what is happening; not even the most enterprising\r\nAmerican newspaperman will be able to get a scoop on the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Would the Germans first invade Ireland in order to be able to\r\nattack the British Isles from all sides?_\r\n\r\nA. Possibly, though not necessarily. The Germans might consider the\r\ndisadvantages of taking Ireland greater than the advantages. The Irish\r\nChannel is as wide as the English; the Germans would be no nearer\r\nEngland than they are now. The possession of submarine bases in Ireland\r\nwould be the most important gain for the Germans. Against this the\r\nGermans have to balance the cost of the operation, since there are\r\nstrong British units in Northern Ireland; the time lost; the alarm\r\ngiven; and the effect on the Irish in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why doesn’t Ireland allow the British to take over for the duration\r\nof the war or at any rate let them use the Irish naval bases they need\r\nso badly?_\r\n\r\nA. Because the Irish still consider Oliver Cromwell a far more\r\nunpleasant fellow than Adolf Hitler. They still distrust and to a\r\ndegree hate the British. Also they know they would be enslaved if\r\nHitler won; but they do not expect Hitler to win. They expect Britain\r\nto win, but they will do nothing or practically nothing to help win.\r\nTo be fair to the Irish, their attitude is based less on historical\r\nprejudice than on today’s life or death. If De Valera were to give\r\nthe British permission to occupy the Irish ports, the moment the news\r\nbecame known, the Germans would bombard Dublin and other Irish cities,\r\nand deliberately attempt to kill as many Irish men, women, and children\r\nas possible to punish them for siding with the English. This is the\r\nthreat that so far has kept the Irish from allowing the British in.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _If the Russians hold the German Army long enough, won’t the time\r\ncome when the German people will revolt? Why not wait for that?_\r\n\r\nA. Because it is extremely unlikely ever to happen unless we go to war.\r\nThe German people will revolt only when, as Walter Lippmann expressed\r\nit, they feel that it has become more dangerous to go on with Hitler\r\nthan to get rid of him. Such a time will come only when the German\r\npeople become convinced that they are going to be defeated and invaded.\r\nIt will not come merely because the German Army falls into a prolonged\r\ndeadlock with the Russians.\r\n\r\nThere has to be the conviction that foreign troops are going to enter\r\nGermany itself, and that if the German people overthrow Hitler they\r\nwill receive milder treatment at the hands of their liberated victims.\r\nThe danger of going on with Hitler has to be very imminent and great\r\nto move the German people to revolt, because the crimes of the Nazis\r\nhave been so atrocious that the Nazis know they will be killed if they\r\nare overthrown. There must be ten thousand Nazis who anticipate death\r\nif they lose their power either by revolt or by loss of the war. They\r\nwill meet any attempt at revolt with the utmost mercilessness. In the\r\nlast war there were no Germans who expected to be killed if Germany\r\nlost. The Nazi gang whose life and death hang on the outcome of the\r\nwar is larger than the clique of the German ruling class which had an\r\nurgent, though not life-and-death interest, in seeing the last war to\r\na successful conclusion. Any hopes that a German revolt would end the\r\nwar if the deadlock lasts long enough are based on wishful thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What makes you think Hitler would want to destroy us?_\r\n\r\nA. First, because he could not afford to allow any democracy, any free\r\nstate, to exist in his totalitarian world. In his world there would be\r\nonly one kind of freedom, the freedom of the German to do as he likes\r\nwith all other varieties of men. If Hitler is not interfered with and\r\nhas time to accustom his slaves to slavery, his dynasty of tyrants\r\nmight last far beyond our lifetime, but not if a single democracy\r\npersists to tempt and challenge his slaves to revolt. Witness today how\r\nfor a long time the subjugated peoples of Europe seemed sunk in abject\r\napathy, but awakened to demonstrate against their despot the moment\r\nRussia’s resistance awakened the hope of eventual victory. If Hitler\r\nwins over the rest of the world, he must destroy us in order to be safe\r\nin his own Empire.\r\n\r\nAs long as a democracy exists on earth it will hold out before the eyes\r\nof hundreds of millions of Hitler’s subjects the vision of a place on\r\nearth where the body and soul of a man belong to himself and there\r\nare no masters and slaves. Especially dangerous to his rule would be\r\na democracy which not only offered this vision but was potentially\r\npowerful enough to be a positive threat, as the United States. For this\r\nreason alone Hitler could not allow us to continue to exist, a free\r\noasis in his vast helot Reich.\r\n\r\nSecond, Hitler could not afford to give us time to translate our\r\npotential into real strength. He professes two opinions of America.\r\nOne is that we are negligible; the other is that as the last war was\r\ndecided by America, this one may be. He once told a diplomatic official\r\nof his who still occupies a high post in this country: “The United\r\nStates is a degenerate democracy in the backwash of civilization\r\nand too demoralized by pacifism to play any important role in the\r\nwar to come.” He is truly contemptuous of our democracy, as of all\r\ndemocracies, which he judges on the basis of those he has overthrown or\r\nconquered, from the German to the French. He concludes that we must be\r\nweak, since our democratic system dispenses justice, as far as humanly\r\npossible, to the weak as well as to the strong, and because since the\r\nconquest of the continental United States we have shown little or no\r\ninterest in building an empire. To the Nazi heart justice to the weak\r\nis a proof of weakness; and to the Nazi mind only one thing prevents\r\na human being from seizing the property of a neighbor, weakness.\r\nSo Hitler on the one hand thinks us weak, but on the other hand he\r\nrecognizes that we could become strong.\r\n\r\nAs he once told me that he admitted the entry of the United States into\r\nthe last war had decided the struggle, so now when America is preparing\r\nto throw its whole weight against him, he shows signs of wishing to\r\nkeep us out. By now Britain has taught him that even a democracy can\r\nbecome tough if it has time. Would Hitler, after he had crushed the\r\nBritish, willingly give us time to become morally strong enough to\r\nfight him as the British fought him? Could he afford to let us have the\r\ntwo years or more still necessary for the physical job of creating the\r\ncannon, tanks, airplanes, and naval vessels and for the training of the\r\nofficers and men for an armed force strong enough to face his?\r\n\r\nThe third simple reason for his wishing to subjugate the United States\r\nis that he wants the loot of America, richest on earth, and wants us\r\nto pay tribute to the Greater German Reich as France and the other\r\nconquered countries are doing now.\r\n\r\nFourth, and not the least, important reason to believe that Hitler\r\nwishes to destroy the United States, is because he has said so. You\r\nremember his speech in the second year of the war when he said, “We\r\nshall destroy Britain and every country which has fed Britain.” To whom\r\ndo you suppose he referred if not to the United States? And do you\r\nnot think now that it is high time to pay attention to this no longer\r\nfunny little man when he announces what he intends to do? He is unique\r\namong conquerors, because he always, by one means or another, warned\r\nhis victims of what he intended to do to them, and in most cases, the\r\nLindberghs of the world have looked up appeasingly and archly inquired,\r\n“Oh no, Mr. Hitler, you surely don’t mean that, do you?”\r\n\r\nAs someone expressed it, Hitler has never kept a promise but never\r\nfailed to carry out, or at least try to carry out, a threat. His threat\r\nto destroy us has been documented scores of times. Hermann Rauschning\r\nquotes Hitler as declaring privately to friends that he would conquer\r\nthe United States first from within, with his Fifth Column, and\r\nWalther Darre, his Minister of Agriculture, has developed the topic\r\nthus: “I have been asked about my opinion of America, especially the\r\nUnited States, and the danger of this pseudo-democratic Republic’s\r\npossible attempts to hinder us in our historical development. There\r\nis no fear that this demoralized country will mix in this German war.\r\nIn the first place, as in France and other countries, also in the\r\nUnited States, we have many of our compatriots and even more friends\r\namong the citizens of the United States. Many of the latter hold the\r\nmost important positions in political and economic life and will not\r\npermit public opinion to allow something so senseless and insane as war\r\nagainst Germany.... The United States is at present so demoralized and\r\nso corrupted that, like England and France, it need not be taken into\r\nconsideration as a military adversary.... The United States will also\r\nbe forced by Germany to complete and final capitulation.”\r\n\r\nFinally, as we discussed before, Hitler as every conqueror, cannot stop\r\ntrying to conquer, and after he had finished with the Old World, his\r\nmomentum would force him to attack the New.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Haven’t we plenty to do at home, without getting into a foreign\r\nwar? Why don’t we try to make a real democracy in America before we go\r\nout to try to improve the rest of the world?_\r\n\r\nA. This argument that we should pay no attention to the fire in the\r\nhouse next door because we are busy cleaning the windows of our house,\r\npolishing the floor, and cleaning up the kitchen has the same amount\r\nof logic and common sense as the doctrine that we ought not to fight\r\non our enemy’s territory but only on our own. President Hutchins of\r\nthe University of Chicago has put this argument of perfectionism in\r\nscholarly form. He maintains that we are going to war to establish\r\nthroughout the world the Four Freedoms--of speech, of worship, from\r\nwant, and from fear--but he says we have no right to crusade for them\r\nuntil we have established them at home. But we are not going to war to\r\ncrusade for the Four Freedoms; as we have pointed out before, we are\r\ngoing to war to make the world safe for the United States, and at the\r\nsame time or thereafter do what we can to establish the Four Freedoms\r\nelsewhere as well as in America. If we do not go to war, we risk losing\r\neven what we have of the Four Freedoms, even the small quantities of\r\nthem measured by Dr. Hutchins.\r\n\r\nSomething of what he says about the failure of the Four Freedoms in\r\nthis country to reach perfection is true; not all of it. He says we\r\nhave freedom of speech to say only what everybody else is saying, but\r\nDr. Hutchins will admit we have more of this kind of freedom than any\r\nother country at this moment. He will also admit that everyone else is\r\nnot saying the things Dr. Hutchins is saying and yet he may say them\r\nwithout let or hindrance. He says we have “freedom of worship if we\r\ndon’t take our religion too seriously,” but one must ask oneself what\r\nexamples of religious intolerance have given rise to such a statement?\r\nWhere are the persecuted religionists and to what country would they\r\nflee to escape from the alleged deficiency of freedom of worship in\r\nAmerica?\r\n\r\nDr. Hutchins says that as for freedom from want and freedom from\r\nfear, so long as one-third of the nation is ill-fed, ill-clothed,\r\nand ill-housed, as Roosevelt says it is, we have no right to try to\r\nestablish these freedoms in other countries. Again, we can admit that\r\nthe matter is precisely as President Roosevelt has stated it, and yet\r\nassert that the people of the United States have as a whole better\r\nfood, clothing, and living conditions than those of any other country\r\nwith comparable climatic conditions. He says that as for democracy, “we\r\nknow that millions of men and women are disfranchised in this country\r\nbecause of their race, color, or condition of economic servitude.”\r\nBut if by reason of the passive attitude toward the war advocated by\r\nDr. Hutchins, this country should fall under Hitler’s power, whether\r\ndirectly, with der Fuehrer in Washington, or indirectly with der\r\nFuehrer’s Gauleiter, chosen from the America First Committee as our\r\nPresident, all of America’s 133,000,000 men and women would be wholly\r\ndisfranchised.\r\n\r\nDr. Hutchins says that we must abandon the Four Freedoms if we go\r\nto war, and that “We cannot suppose, because civil liberties were\r\nrestricted in the last war and expanded after it, that we can rely\r\non their revival after the next one.” Why not? If we cannot rely on\r\nexperience, what can we rely on? In every war the United States has\r\never fought we have delegated to the executive the powers necessary\r\nto win victory and afterward we have always taken them back, but\r\nwithout even an argument, much less any forcible attempt to prevent\r\nsuch action. Dr. Hutchins says, “If we go to war we cast away our\r\nopportunity and cancel our gains. For a generation, perhaps for\r\nhundreds of years, we shall not be able to struggle back to where we\r\nwere. In fact, the changes that total war will bring may mean that\r\nwe shall never be able to struggle back. Education will cease. Its\r\nplace will be taken by vocational and military training. The effort to\r\nestablish a democratic community will stop. We shall think no more of\r\njustice, of the moral order and the supremacy of human rights. We shall\r\nhave hope no longer.”\r\n\r\nWhy should these things happen to us if they have never happened in\r\npast wars? Because, says Dr. Hutchins, “this war, if we enter it,\r\nwill make the last one look like a stroll in the park.” But has the\r\nwar done any of these things to Britain? On the contrary it is the\r\nunanimous judgment of observers of Britain in wartime that the British\r\nare more just, humane, democratic, and obedient to a higher moral\r\nregime than ever before in their history. The British are nearer their\r\nenemy and more deeply immersed in total war than we can ever be. Why\r\nshould we be expected to fare worse than the British?\r\n\r\nDr. Hutchins expresses concern for “suffering humanity” and declares\r\nwe could best serve it by staying out of war, and extending aid to\r\nBritain and China “on the basis most likely to keep us at peace\r\nand least likely to involve us in war.” Is it really helpful to\r\nsuffering humanity in Britain, China, France, Russia, Norway, Poland,\r\nCzechoslovakia, Luxembourg, Holland, Belgium, Austria, yes and in Italy\r\nand Germany itself, to practice a policy directed solely to avoiding\r\nconflict with the author of the misery of half the world?\r\n\r\nAside from that, there is only one choice before America now and the\r\nchoice is not between going to war or not going to war. The choice\r\ntoday is between going to war in time to win it, and going to war too\r\nlate to win it. We can best serve “suffering humanity” by attempting\r\nwith all the strength of our bodies and souls to destroy the prime,\r\nimmediate mundane cause of humanity’s suffering. Finally, Dr. Hutchins\r\ndeclares that the argument that we should go to war now when we have\r\nBritain to help us, to avoid having to go to war later, when we should\r\nhave to face the whole world alone, rests on the improvable assumptions\r\nthat Britain must fall and that the totalitarian powers will wish to,\r\nand be able to, and will attack us. We could debate on these grounds\r\nand make a strong case for even this simplest, most direct form of\r\npossible events. But the argument for war now does not rest alone on\r\nthis succession of possible events.\r\n\r\nGermany may not be able to conquer Britain, but Britain may become so\r\nweary and so convinced that she cannot defeat Germany without us,\r\nand so persuaded that we shall never come into the war, that Britain\r\nmight make a negotiated peace. Such a peace would be as disastrous to\r\nus as a lost war; to prevent it is as strong a motive for our going\r\nto war now as is the motive of preventing the actual fall of Britain.\r\nAgain, unless Britain falls or makes a negotiated peace, how is any\r\nkind of peace to come to the world? By Britain’s defeating Germany?\r\nNo, if Russia falls or defects, Britain alone certainly cannot conquer\r\nGermany; no informed person thinks it possible. Does Dr. Hutchins think\r\nBritain could? Does he think it would be desirable to allow Bolshevik\r\nRussia the credit and opportunity of the land conquest of Germany,\r\nwhich by now is Europe?\r\n\r\nFailing to enter the war, we have to face the alternatives; First: Fall\r\nof Britain followed by Axis economic, political, and military attack\r\non the Western Hemisphere and probable American defeat by Nazis within\r\nas well as without. Second: A negotiated peace between Britain and\r\nGermany; followed by Nazi attack on the Western Hemisphere as before.\r\nThird: Defeat of Germany by Britain at sea and in the air, and by\r\nRussia on land; followed by Russian Communism throughout Europe. Does\r\nDr. Hutchins believe this a desirable end, or that the United States\r\nwould remain immune from its effects? Fourth: An interminable deadlock\r\nin Europe with the entire world from year to year slipping backward\r\npolitically, economically, and morally with no prospect of anything\r\nexcept more ruined cities, more starving people, more dead from battle\r\nand bombardment, famine and pestilence. Is it helping suffering\r\nhumanity to remain aloof and permit any of these alternatives to come\r\nto pass?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why do you think we ought to go to war with Germany today?_\r\n\r\nA. Because until Nazi Germany is defeated the world will never be safe\r\nfor us to live in; because it will require the total war effort of the\r\nUnited States and Britain and Russia to defeat Germany; and because our\r\nformal declaration of war would be worth more in the struggle against\r\nGermany than all the material aid we shall be able to send the Allies\r\nfor the next year or more.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But wouldn’t it be better to wait and let Hitler declare war on us?_\r\n\r\nA. It would best serve our interests if Hitler would declare war,\r\nbut since he knows this is true, he is not likely to do so under any\r\nprovocation. I should think he would hesitate to declare war even if\r\nwe were to have a pitched naval battle and sink his ships and announce\r\nit. He knows that even if our Navy is fighting his, there is still a\r\nbody of American public opinion which is opposed to the participation\r\nof our Army in an A.E.F. He knows that if he declared war it would help\r\nimmensely to unify the American people. He might go into a fury and\r\ndeclare war, but it would be unlike him. Behind all his tantrums there\r\nis usually calculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But isn’t our present state of “undeclared war” just as effective\r\nas being formally at war? Why would our declaration of war be worth so\r\nmuch immediately?_\r\n\r\nA. Because of its moral effect upon ourselves, our enemies, and our\r\nfriends. We can talk all we like about being in a state of undeclared\r\nwar, but until we are formally at war we will continue to behave\r\nas though we were at peace. Only by going to war can we discipline\r\nourselves, our workingmen, and our employers to defeat the Axis in\r\nthe battle of production. At this moment when Britain and Germany are\r\ndevoting four hours of each working day to making arms, we are devoting\r\nthirty minutes to making arms. Only by going to war can our citizens’\r\narmy get the morale to be a fighting force.\r\n\r\nOn the Germans the effect of our declaration of war would be\r\ncatastrophic. Every German would say to himself, “Now we can’t win;\r\nwe can hold on for a long time, perhaps, but we can’t win.” On the\r\nItalians the effect would be to depress their feeble efforts still\r\nfurther toward zero.\r\n\r\nOn the British the effect would be to give them what they lack and what\r\nthey most need: the assurance of victory. The British are convinced\r\nthat they cannot be defeated, but how are they going to defeat the\r\nGermans without the United States actively in the war?\r\n\r\nUpon the Soviet Union the effect would be to strengthen the resolution\r\nof Stalin and the Russian people not to make a compromise peace nor\r\nsuccumb to any of the temptations Hitler may offer; and the longer the\r\nRed Army fights the Germans the fewer sacrifices will have to be made\r\nby the United States to help win the war.\r\n\r\nTo France our declaration of war would bring the will to live again.\r\nBelief in eventual German victory over Britain was the basis upon which\r\nthe French surrendered. It was the foundation of Vichy’s policy. Our\r\ndeclaration of war might not change Pétain and his men of Vichy, for\r\nthey are prisoners of their own deeds, and probably cannot withdraw\r\nfrom their fatal collaboration with the Germans, but it would move\r\nthe people of France profoundly. Pétain does not represent the people\r\nof France. I believe far more in the spirit of my French friend who\r\nwrote me: “Soon we shall all be starving, but send no food. When we are\r\nstarving will be a good moment to throw by parachute on every French\r\nfarm and on the suburbs of Paris thousands of small machine guns,\r\nwith the necessary bullets. Then the German Army will be in France\r\nas Napoleon’s Army was in Spain in 1813.” America’s entry into the\r\nwar would be worth to Frenchmen like this more than machine guns. It\r\nwould give them the certainty that France will live again. General de\r\nGaulle’s army would swell by the tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nWe could reckon on the possibility of being able to occupy the\r\nstrategic positions we need in North Africa and on any other\r\nadvantages within the power of the French to give us. We could for the\r\nfirst time anticipate serious revolt by the peoples of all the occupied\r\nterritories when the time came; and help for the Allied Expeditionary\r\nForce which some day must invade the continent. All the enslaved\r\npeoples would be equally affected. The Nazi Terror works perfectly so\r\nlong as its victims feel that it is hopeless to revolt. Revolt becomes\r\npossible only when the victims feel that they can afford to risk all,\r\nsince freedom will eventually be the reward.\r\n\r\nA very important effect of our declaration of war upon Germany would\r\nbe the effect upon Japan. The Japanese mental processes are difficult\r\nindeed to understand but I venture to guess that if they saw us\r\nformally aligned with the British for the duration, they would be\r\nlikely to take a milder rather than stronger attitude toward us.\r\nNeeding principally smaller vessels in the Atlantic, we could base our\r\nmain Battle Fleet on Singapore and confidently await any move Japan\r\nmight make. Our declaration of war might well force Japan out of the\r\nAxis.\r\n\r\nChina, like Britain, would be given the most precious possession in\r\nwarfare, the assurance of final victory. For even if Japan continued\r\nto fight China, once the Allies’ main task was performed and Germany\r\ndefeated, the combined British and American navies could be counted\r\non to bring Japan back to reason without much difficulty. On all the\r\nother countries, as neutral Portugal, non-belligerent Spain, encapsuled\r\nSweden and Switzerland, the effect of our going to war would be\r\nrevolutionary. Our South American friends would become even better\r\nneighbors. All over the world the conviction that now Germany will\r\nbe defeated would become the decisive element in the policy of every\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But would we really go to work if we did declare war? Britain\r\ndidn’t at first and neither did France. What makes you think we would?_\r\n\r\nA. You are right. It took Dunkirk to wake Britain up and France never\r\ndid awake; she passed without regaining consciousness from deep sleep\r\nto death. Perhaps we too would not awaken even if we went to war, but\r\nwe will never awaken until we do go to war. Most nations in this war\r\nhave remained curiously apathetic until their first battle experience;\r\nthis may be true of us. But the fact of our being actively belligerent\r\nwould be bound to improve our spirit since it would put our moral\r\nposition right. Ever since the beginning of the war we Americans\r\nhave suffered from a divided personality. Half of our minds clung\r\nto the idea that we could keep at peace if we wished for peace hard\r\nenough, and this half declared: “It is not our war.” This half of our\r\nminds made the Neutrality Act. The other half of our minds realized\r\nall along that we should have been in the war from the beginning,\r\nthat Hitler was fighting to conquer the world, that it was for us a\r\nmatter of life or death to keep him from succeeding and that every\r\nconsideration of self-interest, as of honor, urged us to take our full\r\npart in the world-wide struggle against the new Barbarism. This half\r\nwas responsible for the Lease-Lend Bill, a half-measure, condemned by\r\nthe very definition: “All aid to Britain _short of war_!” Our souls\r\nremained divided, and this division has made us an ailing nation,\r\nhypochondriac, complaining of low morale, nervous, and subject to fits\r\nof depression alternating with elation. We are unreasonably discouraged\r\nor cheered as the tide of battle ebbs and flows, and always we try to\r\ninterpret whatever happens as a sign at last that we do not have to do\r\nour duty, that after all we can get out of this task, so onerous, so\r\npainful, and so unavoidable.\r\n\r\nCompletely opposite arguments are employed to prove that we may escape\r\nour obligation. If the British suffer a setback, up goes the cry: “The\r\nBritish are already beaten; there’s no use trying to save them now;\r\nlet’s not throw good money after bad.” If the British win a victory,\r\nthere is a rousing cheer: “The British are winning without us; thank\r\nGod now we will not have to fight.” When I came home from the Battle\r\nof Britain, it struck me as it had struck many others who have come to\r\nAmerica from the war zone, that we were far more nervous and agitated\r\nthan the peoples at war, even and especially more than those under\r\nactual heavy bombardment. Eve Curie, that admirable French patriot and\r\ngallant fighter for civilization, who was one of our group when we\r\nescaped from France, put it perfectly when she said: “There is no fear\r\nin the countries which are fighting. Extraordinarily enough, fear has\r\ngone somewhere else, to the countries which are not menaced, to the\r\ncountries ‘at peace.’”\r\n\r\nIs there any reason to suppose that our reactions would be\r\nsubstantially different from those of the peoples at war? Once we\r\ntake a bold stand for the position we know to be just, right, and\r\ninevitable, we shall for the first time since this war began, lose our\r\nfear and become well, strong, hopeful, and proud. The sense of guilt\r\nwhich has made us nationally unhappy will leave us and we shall rejoice\r\nin a clear conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What effect would our declaring war have upon the morale of the\r\nArmy, particularly on that of the selectees, which has been criticized\r\nso much?_\r\n\r\nA. Going to war would unquestionably cure all the troubles of the Army\r\nsooner or later. It is not our soldiers’ fault if today in peacetime\r\nthey are restless and discontented at being compelled to do what must\r\nseem to them very like playing at being soldiers. Would the spirit of a\r\nfootball team be good if the team did nothing but practice football all\r\nday long, month in and month out, and never played a game, and had no\r\ngames scheduled? What would be the spirit of a cast of players if they\r\nhad rehearsals every day for months and never staged a performance to\r\nan audience, and had no performances scheduled?\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _From your travel throughout the country have you formed any\r\nimpression of what the morale of the Army actually is?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, from personal observation, I have reluctantly had to admit the\r\nimpression that many of the selectees, at any rate, do not understand\r\nwhy they are in the Army, nor why there should be conscription, nor why\r\ntheir period of service was extended. In a word, they have no desire\r\nto fight. Now this could be a most serious matter, since any nation\r\nis doomed if its youth, or any considerable number of them, are not\r\nwilling to fight for it, yet this mood would vanish on our entry into\r\nwar. The boys are not to blame. To blame are all the leaders who have\r\nconfused and deceived them, the teachers who taught them pacifism and\r\nthe isolationist politicians who do the work of Hitler. One of the\r\nelements most confusing in the Army mind is the promise rashly made in\r\nthe presidential campaign that we should never engage in a “foreign\r\nwar,” a promise no American should have made because nobody except\r\nHitler had the power to fulfill it.\r\n\r\nNow we are paying the penalty democracy always has to pay for hypocrisy\r\nand for deceptions in elections. The penalty is the state of mind\r\nexposed in a questionnaire taken at Camp Callan, San Diego, among\r\nselectees, and published with elation by an isolationist journal. The\r\nsoldiers answered: (a) Should the United States go to war with the Axis\r\nimmediately? Affirmative, 1 per cent. (b) Should the United States\r\ncontinue its policy of all-out economic aid to Britain and expand\r\nAmerica’s military and naval forces in order to fight the Axis powers\r\noverseas if the Axis powers are not defeated by Britain? Affirmative,\r\n25 per cent. (c) Should the United States guard the Western Hemisphere\r\nbut send no military aid outside this area? Affirmative, 39 per cent.\r\n(d) Should the United States be strictly neutral and prepare to defend\r\nonly our own territory and possessions? Affirmative, 37 per cent.\r\nThese answers would have distressed Count Leo Tolstoy if Tolstoy were\r\nan American living today.\r\n\r\nTolstoy, who was as great a student of war as he was a novelist, has\r\na formula whereby he could interpret this poll and give us a rough\r\nestimate of the military effectiveness of an army made up of soldiers\r\nwith the attitude revealed by this questionnaire. In _War and Peace_,\r\nhis epic novel on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, he says: “_In warfare_\r\nthe force of armies is the product of the mass multiplied by something\r\nelse, an unknown X. X is the spirit of the army, the greater or less\r\n_desire to fight_ and to face dangers on the part of all the men\r\ncomposing the army.” Note that Tolstoy says “_desire_ to fight” not\r\njust “_willingness_ to fight.” The emphasis is on the positive desire\r\nnot passive willingness. This is another way to express the paramount\r\nimportance of morale. What is morale? It is knowing what you have to\r\nfight about and having the desire to fight for it. But only one per\r\ncent of the selectees questioned indicated they knew what they had to\r\nfight about and desired to fight; one-third thought we ought to be\r\n“strictly neutral,” and three-fourths were against fighting anywhere\r\noutside of our hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _The selectees evidently had been influenced by the arguments for\r\npassive hemisphere defense, but what do you think of the argument that\r\nwe should never fight on foreign soil, but if we have to fight, let it\r\nbe in America?_\r\n\r\nA. It reminds me of the Chinese and the Japanese soldiers at the\r\nbeginning of their war. I saw the fall of Shanghai, and I couldn’t help\r\nbut remark that while the Chinese soldier said, “I will die for China,”\r\nthe Japanese soldier said, “I will kill for Japan,” and so for a long\r\ntime the two got along perfectly together. For every American who may\r\ndeclare, “I don’t want to fight on foreign soil; if I have to fight I\r\nwant to fight only at home,” there is a German who declares, “I don’t\r\nwant to fight at home; I fight only on foreign soil,” as the Germans\r\nhave consistently done to the best of their ability for the last\r\nhundred years. May we never accommodate the Germans in this respect.\r\nSurely of all the isolationist arguments this is the least intelligent,\r\nto prefer that the fearful destruction of war be wrought on our own\r\nhomes. It is an argument you will never hear in our Southern states.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What should we do with conscientious objectors?_\r\n\r\nA. Reason with them. Many honest conscientious objectors can be\r\nconverted by the right kind of reasoning, and the more honest they\r\nare the easier it is to straighten out their misunderstandings. If\r\nthis fails then they ought to be given work to do at some enterprise\r\nof national interest, and be compelled to do it, as the government is\r\nnow doing in its camps for conscientious objectors. If they refuse to\r\nregister, they go to jail, as no government could afford to tolerate\r\ndeliberate defiance of its laws. We as a democracy must observe the\r\nrights even of a minority which would bring ruin upon the country\r\nif its policies were to rule. This is something we can be proud of,\r\nsomething that marks us more than any other one thing as different\r\nfrom the tyrannous Nazi state where conscientious objectors and every\r\nvariety of pacifist or obstructionist is put to death. We can afford\r\nto treat our objectors as we would defectives. Hitler has to kill his.\r\nHe held from the beginning that pacifists were the greatest danger\r\nto the state, and from the moment he came to power he has sought out\r\nand executed every German pacifist who has revealed himself. Hitler\r\nthus proves he feels that pacifist doctrine would be dangerous to his\r\nregime, as it would.\r\n\r\nThe German nation is being led by Hitler in _aggressive_ war.\r\nOpposition to aggressive war is a form of pacifism which makes sound\r\nsense. The war we and the British are called upon to fight, a war\r\nwe did not want but are compelled to carry on in order to save our\r\nnational lives, is a war that even a pacifist ought to support.\r\nIn this war the man who refuses to fight for his country is like\r\na person in a lifeboat who refuses to pull an oar. In England a\r\nconscientious objector was asked at his examination whether he would\r\ndo non-combatant war work. He answered, “No.” The Judge asked “Would\r\nyou not help build an air-raid shelter?” The man answered, “No.” The\r\nJudge then asked, “But if there were an air raid on would you go into\r\na shelter someone else had built?” The man answered, “Yes.” I wonder\r\nhow many of the 1,800 young Americans who have been classified as\r\nconscientious objectors would contend that this is honest, and yet\r\nit is fundamentally the attitude of all conscientious objectors. The\r\nnation shelters the lives, liberty, and property of all its citizens.\r\nEveryone living in the nation is enjoying this protection. Everyone has\r\na primary obligation to help maintain it. In England today, however,\r\nthe government permits more than 40,000 registered conscientious\r\nobjectors to enjoy the protection of the air-raid shelters, and of the\r\nRoyal Air Force, Army, and Navy, without contributing to it. Is this\r\nnot a tribute to the invincible liberalism of Anglo-Saxon democracy?\r\n\r\nThe conscientious objector had a better case in almost all other wars\r\nthan he has in this one. The modern pre-Hitler war had a superficial\r\ncourse something like this: The victor occupied the vanquished country,\r\nmade a peace treaty, collected an indemnity, then withdrew to his\r\nown country with what loot he could carry. A part of the vanquished\r\ncountry might be annexed to the victor. The defeated nation smarted\r\nunder the humiliation but in time the population resumed its ordinary\r\nlife, and within a few years a stranger could hardly find signs of any\r\nchange as a result of the loss of the war. A pacifist might argue that\r\nunder these circumstances it would pay not to resist since the loss by\r\nfighting would be greater than the loss by nonresistance, considerable\r\nthough that might be. This is not that kind of war. Hitler does not\r\nintend to restore the sovereignty of the nations he conquers. All\r\nHitler’s wars are more or less Carthaginian. For as long as Hitler\r\nremains the master, his vanquished will be slave states, with their\r\ncitizens chained to the Nazi machine, their women degraded, their\r\nreligion persecuted, their schools closed, their books burned, and\r\nall this will continue until Hitler is overcome by force. It is not a\r\nchoice between greater or lesser evils. It is a choice between life and\r\ndeath, for those who physically survive under the Hitler tyranny are\r\ncondemned to a living death, as the Poles can testify.\r\n\r\nMost of the great pacifist leaders have been converted by their\r\nobservation of Hitler. Albert Einstein was thought of as the world’s\r\ngreatest pacifist, but he abandoned the doctrine of non-violence after\r\nonly a few months spent under the Hitler regime before he escaped to\r\nAmerica. On his way here Einstein passed through Belgium and in an\r\ninterview published in a Brussels newspaper declared: “If I were a\r\nyoung Belgian today, I would not refuse military service.” From a man\r\nwho all his life had been a militant pacifist, taking part in world\r\ncampaigns against war, this statement ought to persuade any young\r\nman. Britain’s leading pacifist, Bertrand Russell, has likewise been\r\npersuaded to give up his “isolationism” and to advocate that we give\r\nup ours, because the airplane, annihilating distances, has made it\r\nimpossible for any nation “to secure peace for itself by isolation.”\r\nBut Hitler is more persuasive, it seems to me.\r\n\r\nHitler writes that the Germans “will give what many blinded pacifists\r\nhope to get by moaning and crying,” namely, “a peace, supported not by\r\nthe palm branches of tearful pacifist professional female mourners, but\r\nfounded by the victorious sword of a people of overlords which puts\r\nthe world into the service of a higher culture.” And again he wrote:\r\n“Indeed the pacifist-humane idea is perhaps quite good whenever the\r\nman of the highest standard has previously conquered and subjected the\r\nworld to a degree that makes him the only master of this globe.” That\r\nis surely clear enough to convince the most conscientious objector that\r\nif everyone refused to fight Hitler he would conquer the world, and as\r\nPresident Conant of Harvard says, men would have no more freedom than\r\nhorses have now. It is not pleasant to have to agree with Hitler, but\r\none must admit he defined the conscientious objector correctly when he\r\ndeclared the healthy, unspoiled boy would willingly give his life for\r\nhis country and thus “obeys the deeper necessity of the preservation\r\nof the species, if necessary at the expense of the individual,” while\r\nthe pacifist egotistically puts his interest ahead of the nation. The\r\ncharge of cowardice is easy to make, and I for one shall not make it.\r\nI prefer to think of most conscientious objectors as men who have not\r\nthought the problem through. After all, one of them was named Sergeant\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why don’t we have a department in our Army to tell the soldiers why\r\nthey are in uniform?_\r\n\r\nA. We have a morale section in the Army but it cannot operate\r\neffectively until we are at war. It is forbidden to discuss “politics”\r\nwith the soldiers and it would be “politics” now to explain that they\r\nare in uniform to fight the Germans. Yet nothing could be more valuable\r\nfor our war effort than to have qualified men visit each army camp,\r\nand after a series of public lectures on America and the war, conduct\r\na question-and-answer period, followed by individual conferences with\r\nsoldiers interested enough to ask for them. Officers would probably\r\nbenefit as much from such instruction as the men.\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful departments of the German Army is its morale\r\nsection which teaches a recruit above all things to be proud to be a\r\nsoldier, and that it is the highest honor for him to be permitted to\r\nfight for his country. It is my impression that we would have to be\r\neven more elementary than that. Some American youths need to have it\r\nexplained that from time immemorial the young men of a family, a tribe,\r\nor a nation have been by nature required to be its physical defenders;\r\nthat the old men, women, and children have other duties to perform,\r\nbut the young men are the only ones strong enough to go out and fight.\r\nStatements as simple as that are necessary after our last twenty years\r\nof pacifism and materialism. Too many times young men have asked me why\r\nthey should fight for a society they do not approve, a society which\r\ndoes not provide them with good jobs and a comfortable life. The answer\r\nis that if they do not understand now, Hitler will provide a sufficient\r\nexplanation later, as the pacifist students of the University of Paris\r\nfound out when the Germans occupied their city and shot a score of them\r\nas a lesson.\r\n\r\nHitler will make it plain that this is no class war. Hitler will make\r\nit clear that it is a simple tribal war of a brute soldier-state bent\r\nupon the subjugation of all other states and peoples, good, bad, or\r\nindifferent, and of all classes. The English have learned this is no\r\nclass war and every kind of Englishman, rich and poor alike, are united\r\nnow in one great fighting tribe. Our youth could learn from the example\r\nof the youth of conquered Europe that if they do not successfully\r\ndefend their country, imperfect though it may be, they will be\r\nconquered and cast into slavery.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to point out that this generation of American youth\r\nis alive and enjoying the privileges of this country because other\r\nyoung men years ago and centuries ago fought and defeated the enemies\r\nof America. It would clear up many a young soldier’s difficulties if\r\nhe were given an explanation in the simplest language of the origins\r\nand issues of the war. Many of them hardly know the bare facts of who\r\nis fighting whom. The American soldier has a right to be given the\r\noverwhelming evidence that Germany intends to destroy the American form\r\nof life, and subjugate us if she can; and that just now while Britain\r\nand Russia are absorbing so much German energy is the best time for\r\nus to defend ourselves by the only method of defense that has ever\r\nsucceeded, by attack; by striking with all the power we possess at the\r\nenemy while he is still far from our shores. The American soldier\r\nshould understand that much as we may wish for it, there is little\r\nhope that Britain and Russia alone could defeat the mighty German war\r\nmachine, built as it was during the nine years while we slept. He\r\nshould understand that this means we must fight in Europe, help destroy\r\nthe German Air Force, invade the continent, and finally occupy Germany;\r\nthat this will require every available resource of muscle and money and\r\nbrain and blood and several more years of war, but that the reward for\r\nthis immense payment is the immense reward of freedom. The American\r\nsoldier has a right to have outlined to him the kind of world Hitler\r\nwould make if he won; and the kind of world we hope to make if we win.\r\nThis is the ABC of war, and it is what our soldiers desperately need,\r\nbut it is unlikely that they will get it until we go to war.\r\n\r\nIt takes a great deal of re-education to counter the last two decades\r\nof intellectual rule by our “Irresponsibles,”--professors, writers,\r\nartists, and scholars who debunked our past history and every ideal,\r\ntaught that man’s economic life is all that matters, that soldiers are\r\nsuckers, that we fought the last war for J. P. Morgan, and so on until\r\nbewildered American boys exclaimed: “My country owes me a living; I\r\nowe it nothing.” Yet that is not youth’s natural way. Hitler won the\r\nGerman youth not by offering them fun or comfort or material reward; he\r\nappealed to them to sacrifice themselves for their Fatherland, and they\r\nresponded joyously, “like demons,” as Colonel Schieffer said. Nobody\r\ncan persuade me that our American youth would not respond even more\r\njoyously to an honest appeal, but the appeal has to be clear, simple,\r\nringing as the notes of a bugle in the morning. Let the cynics and the\r\nselfish jibe, but American youth will eventually respond to the call of\r\nPresident Roosevelt for the Four Freedoms, not just for themselves, but\r\nfor all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But weren’t we suckers in the last war?_\r\n\r\nA. No, we were not suckers in the last war. By fighting and beating\r\nGermany in the last war, side by side with our Allies, we won\r\ntwenty-three years of national independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But didn’t we fight the last war to “make the world safe for\r\ndemocracy” and to “end all war”? We certainly failed to do either.\r\nWeren’t we suckers to have tried and failed?_\r\n\r\nA. Don’t you think it was worth while for us to gain the right to live\r\nin peace and freedom from 1918 to 1939 even if we failed to achieve\r\nour whole program? We did not fight the last war just “to make the\r\nworld safe for democracy” or to “end all war.” We fought the last\r\nwar primarily to make the world safe for the United States, and we\r\nsucceeded in that for a good many years. The world has not been safe\r\nfor democracy everywhere for a score of years, but only now do we find\r\nit necessary to fight again because only now has it become plain that\r\nthe world is again no longer safe for the United States. In the last\r\nwar we fought first to preserve America, second to make the world safe\r\nfor democracy, and to end war. In this war we are fighting first to\r\npreserve America, second to establish the Four Freedoms everywhere we\r\ncan, but we modestly refrain this time from announcing that we expect\r\nto end war. Instead we have much more practically declared that when we\r\nwin we will disarm the nations that made this war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But what difference would it have made to us if we had not entered\r\nthe last war at all?_\r\n\r\nA. It would have meant that the Germans probably would have won the\r\nwar. The Commander in Chief of the Allies, Foch, and the actual\r\nCommander in Chief of the Germans, Ludendorff, both admitted that the\r\nAmerican entry into the war was decisive. It was not that America “won\r\nthe war,” but that without us the Allies could not have won.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Suppose the Germans had won the last war; what difference would\r\nthat have made to us?_\r\n\r\nA. If the Germans had won, we should certainly have had to fight\r\nthem thereafter and fight them alone. We may have had a few years\r\nrespite, long enough for the German Navy to become strong enough to\r\nchallenge ours. The general situation today is parallel with the one in\r\n1914-1918, except that Hitler’s Germany is much more powerful and evil\r\nthan Hohenzollern Germany. Nevertheless Kaiser Wilhelm had the same\r\nambition Hitler has. He believed also that the Germans were a master\r\nrace, with a divine mission to rule the world. The Germans came late\r\nto nationhood, too late to receive “their share” of the colonies. This\r\nhelped give them a bitter sense of resentment against a world which\r\nrefused to recognize their superiority. This German belief that they\r\nare superior to everyone on earth is unfortunately strengthened by the\r\nfact that in this industrial age they are among the most talented of\r\nall peoples, and in the natural sciences superior to most others. They\r\nhave proved themselves incorrigible except by force.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Some people argue though, that Hitler actually wants the United\r\nStates to come into the war, so that we would keep our war supplies,\r\ninstead of sending them to England and to Russia. Is this true?_\r\n\r\nA. How could it ever have been true, since Hitler always, at any\r\nmoment, could have brought us into the war if and when he wished. He\r\nhas only to order one or more of his transatlantic submarines to come\r\nover and sink a few American ships in our territorial waters and even\r\na pacifist Congress would vote war. A score of other easy devices have\r\nalways been at his hand if he wanted war with us, but wished us to\r\ndeclare it. But why should he wish to bring against him the greatest\r\nsingle potential power, even if he thought that our entering formal war\r\nwould cause us to withhold supplies from Britain and Russia? And what\r\nis there anyway to make anybody think that if we ever became sensible\r\nenough to go to war we would at the same time become so unintelligent\r\nas to cripple the war effort against our enemy? What point would there\r\nbe in withholding supplies from Britain and Russia just because we had\r\ngone to war with Germany? Would we in the United States be in any more\r\ndanger after having gone to war than before? No, we would actually be\r\nsafer, since the safety afforded us by the British Fleet’s control of\r\nthe Atlantic would now be augmented by removal of all limitation on the\r\nuse of the extra power of our own Atlantic vessels. Suppose, however,\r\nthat we thought it desirable for a time to curtail some shipments to\r\nthe Allies while we filled in certain gaps in our own armament. Could\r\nthis temporary diversion of strength outweigh the danger to Hitler of\r\nAmerica’s strength in the long run?\r\n\r\nI venture to say that this argument against our going to war has done\r\nas much harm as almost any other, and upon examination it seems it must\r\nhave been of German origin, despite the fact that many a good American\r\nand even some good Englishmen have thoughtlessly repeated it. The\r\nperson most competent to judge whether Hitler wants us in the war is\r\nHitler. As I recently recollected when looking over some old clippings,\r\nHitler in an interview in 1932 expressed it to me this way: “I was\r\na soldier in the war and it was my conviction that without American\r\nparticipation on the side of the Allies, we would surely have won the\r\nwar.” This is what he thought of America in the last war. You may be\r\nsure he thinks exactly the same of America in this war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But the Germans have frequently expressed not merely indifference\r\nbut contempt of us, and have spoken as though they did not care\r\nwhether we entered or not. Isn’t it then an exaggeration to say that\r\nour declaration of war would have such a tremendous effect on their\r\nmorale?_\r\n\r\nA. No, because the Germans have expressed indifference to whether we\r\nenter the war only because they were absolutely convinced that we would\r\nnot do so; when we do enter the war it will be an even greater shock\r\nthan if they had anticipated it all the time. Our official behavior\r\nfor a long time, and the utterances of our isolationists all the time,\r\nled the Nazis to believe we were really for peace at any price; that\r\nnothing, neither injury nor insult, could move us to war. When the\r\nfirst Neutrality Act was passed in August, 1935, the Germans, as I have\r\nrecently been reminded by a friend who was in Berlin at the moment,\r\nchortled with glee, and editorials boasted that now Europe could settle\r\nits troubles secure from the meddlesome Yankee. No one can estimate\r\nhow much influence this surrender of American rights had upon Hitler\r\nduring that critical time when he was weighing his strength against all\r\nhis possible enemies. The Germans are convinced we are a money-loving\r\npeople and when the Johnson Act was passed, forbidding credit to any\r\nnation in default on payment of its debt to us, they exclaimed: “Now\r\nthe Americans will never go to war again because they can’t make money\r\nout of it.”\r\n\r\nThe Johnson Act almost persuaded some Germans that we had changed\r\nsides, and Nazis revived their chatter about the essentially Germanic\r\ncharacter of America. We Americans may be wishful thinkers, but the\r\nGermans, fortunately, are even more addicted to the vice than we.\r\nGoebbels’ control of the press promotes it. Every isolationist speech\r\nmade is printed at length in the German newspapers and the voice\r\nof Lindbergh is taken as the voice of America. The re-election of\r\nRoosevelt was the first warning the German people had that America\r\nmight act to defend herself. Now sensible Germans are beginning to be\r\nfrightened. I know how the German people regard America. They call it\r\nthe “land of unlimited possibilities.” It has always been the dreamland\r\nof the Germans, and if our immigration laws had permitted it, we should\r\nhave had tens of millions of Germans coming to this country after the\r\nwar. The tremendous size and economic power of America fascinate all\r\nclasses of Germans; they have never forgotten the shock they received\r\nwhen, after the armistice in 1918, they learned for the first time what\r\ntheir government had concealed from them, that there were over two\r\nmillion American soldiers in France. Hitler tried to stamp out German\r\nadmiration or regard for any foreign country, and doubtless German\r\nsuccesses in this war have influenced the German attitude to a degree,\r\nbut the fundamental element in German thought about America is their\r\nineffaceable memory of the last war: “America joined our enemies; we\r\nlost. If America goes to war against us again, we cannot win.” It would\r\nbe decisive.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But where would we fight Germany? What is the good of America’s\r\nentering the war if there is no battleground?_\r\n\r\nA. We would fight her first where we are fighting her now, in the\r\nAtlantic and on all the seas. The difference between our naval action\r\nif we were at war and as it is under the President’s orders to hunt\r\ndown pirates, would be considerable. At war we would fully collaborate\r\nwith the British Navy in the critical waters along the coast of Europe\r\nand in the zone of greatest danger just west of England where the\r\nGermans sink about nine-tenths of their victims. The reason the Germans\r\nhave been so much more effective in counter-blockading England in this\r\nwar than they were in the last war is of course the airplane, which not\r\nonly bombs and sinks as many ships as the submarine, but also provides\r\nthe submarine with eyes in the air.\r\n\r\nOur air force, and especially our naval air force, greatly augmented\r\nafter our entry into the war, would play a large role in cleansing\r\nthe air of these German raiders. Eventually our air force operating\r\nwith the R.A.F. and based wherever the R.A.F. is based would, we hope,\r\nbecome strong enough to dominate the air over the continent. That is\r\nthe goal toward which all efforts lead; it would be the turning point\r\nof the war. Experts estimate that it will probably take two years to\r\nreach quantitative superiority over the Germans, and then only if we\r\nare not only formally at war but actually making war with all our might.\r\n\r\nThe site of the battlefields after the winning of the Battle of the\r\nAtlantic and the Battle of Britain, depends upon too many unknown\r\nfactors to make more than a guess now. Possible landing places for an\r\nexpeditionary force extend from Norway to the Spanish frontier, North\r\nAfrica, the Near East, and the Balkans. There are also the immense\r\npossibilities opened by the Battle of Russia. In considering the\r\npossibilities of success for an expeditionary force to invade German\r\nEurope we ought not to be discouraged by the failure of the Allies\r\nin Norway, Greece, and Crete, because the German Army’s morale and\r\nstrength will be quite different whenever the conditions for invasion\r\nof the continent exist. It was the German Air Force which, more than\r\nany other factor, defeated the Allies in these three early affrays.\r\n\r\nWhen the Luftwaffe has lost control of the daylight air and the German\r\nArmy is still further weakened by its colossal losses in Russia, and\r\nthe German people are weighed down by the fear of ultimate defeat and\r\napprehension of vengeance, and the population of conquered Europe,\r\nelated at the prospect of liberation, is revolting, the chances of\r\nsuccess for an Allied Expeditionary Force would be strong. Military\r\nexperts are agreed that it would court disaster to try it before these\r\nconditions are fulfilled. Ever since the Battle of Russia began,\r\nimpatient groups in England have clamored for an immediate attempt at\r\ninvasion of the continent, and one can imagine how painful it must\r\nbe for the perpetually aggressive Churchill to be forced to counsel\r\nprudence. He knows that if such an attempt were made and failed it\r\ncould be fatal. On the other hand, if the Allied High Command waits for\r\nthe favorable circumstances which are to be expected if we enter the\r\nwar, we could justly hope not only to be able to invade the continent\r\nsuccessfully but at low cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Would United States troops be required for such an expeditionary\r\nforce? Are we going to have another A.E.F.?_\r\n\r\nA. I should think so, although one must admit the bare possibility that\r\nthe Battle of Russia could make our participation with land troops less\r\nnecessary militarily, although the political reasons for our entry\r\nwould be strongest if the Red Army were winning. If the Russians were\r\nto whittle down the German land army sufficiently, the British might\r\nbecome strong enough eventually to deliver the knockout blow alone, but\r\nI doubt it. There are just twice as many Germans as there are English,\r\nand numbers still count, as we observe in Russia. A cool appraisal of\r\nthe future indicates that the chances are against our being able to\r\nwin the war without sending an A.E.F. If we go to war, it cannot be\r\nwith any reservations. We cannot make war on a limited liability basis.\r\nThere are strong reasons also for us to want to be represented in the\r\narmies of liberation. By the time matters have reached the stage for\r\ncontemplation of an invasion of Europe, the temper of America may have\r\nso changed that there may be a great popular demand for an A.E.F.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What are the strong reasons for our wanting to be represented with\r\nthe armies of liberation?_\r\n\r\nA. In order to be fully represented at the peace. There is no\r\nsubstitute for an army at a Peace Conference, and we may be sure that,\r\nno matter what arrangements may be made between Mr. Churchill and Mr.\r\nRoosevelt, if we are not in the war we will not be in the peace. There\r\nwere many jokes about the famous eight-point meeting to the effect\r\nthat we were trying to get in the peace before we got in the war. I do\r\nnot agree that that was the purpose of Mr. Roosevelt in meeting Mr.\r\nChurchill, but if it were, it is unlikely to succeed. We will have the\r\ninfluence we wish to have at the peace conference only if we have done\r\nour full share in making peace possible by beating Hitler. We ought\r\nnot to deceive ourselves. We are unpopular enough as it is now. If we\r\nstay out of the war, and by a miracle not now foreseeable, Hitler were\r\nafter all to be defeated, what do you think the victors would think of\r\nus? Do you think they would invite us to come in and tell them how to\r\nrearrange the world?\r\n\r\nYet if we do not look forward to establishing a peace which will\r\npostpone for a long time, if not forever, a repetition of this war,\r\nmany Americans would feel too discouraged to act. We would be foolish\r\nnot to fight the Germans now even if we were mathematically certain\r\nthat we were going to have to go on fighting them once every twenty\r\nyears for the rest of time. Nevertheless we do not want to face such a\r\nprospect; we want to rule out war for as long a time as possible, and\r\nwe can do it only by repairing at this Peace Conference the errors made\r\nafter the last one.\r\n\r\nThese errors were not what they have been represented to be, faults\r\nin the Versailles treaty. The mistake we made was that we dodged our\r\nresponsibility for the peace after we had helped finish the war. First\r\nwe invested our blood and treasure, and then after the victory, when\r\nwe were about to gather the dividends of international security and\r\nprosperity in the League of Nations, suddenly, because everything in\r\nthe peace did not completely please us, and because a few politicians\r\nhated the President, we withdrew and declined to collect our profits.\r\nThis ruined the peace, made the League impossible, and another war\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How much American blood and treasure did we spend in the last war?_\r\n\r\nA. Very little blood compared with our Allies. Out of our total\r\nmobilized force of 4,355,000 we lost 126,000 dead of all causes, or\r\ntwo and one-half per cent. Out of the total of 17,314,000 British and\r\nFrench soldiers, 2,266,171 lost their lives, or 13 per cent. If we\r\nhad been compelled from 1914 on to fight as totally as our Allies,\r\nwith our population more than double the combined French and British\r\npopulations, we would have lost more than 2,000,000 dead during the\r\ntime we were leaving the fighting to our Allies, from 1914 to 1917. We\r\nsent money instead; altogether our war loans totaled thirteen billion\r\ndollars. It is fair to say that this investment of money took the place\r\nof investment of lives. It cost us less than $7,000 apiece to save\r\n2,000,000 American men’s lives. Any insurance company would call that\r\na bargain, considering the American man merely from the point of view\r\nof what he is economically worth to his nation. Nevertheless we asked\r\nfor the thirteen billion back. At the same time we put up our tariffs\r\nso high that the nations concerned could not pay, but aside altogether\r\nfrom the economic aspect of our war debts, consider what could have\r\nhappened had we been wiser.\r\n\r\nSuppose, at an appropriate period after passions had subsided, we\r\nhad proposed to Britain and France that we cancel the war debts if\r\nthey would cancel the reparations owed by Germany. There was a time\r\nwhen such a proposal might have succeeded. What would have been\r\nthe probable, or at any rate possible, outcome? No war debts, no\r\nreparations, no inflation in Germany, no Hitler, no war now. Even if\r\nthere were only a chance of such miraculous results, it would have\r\nbeen well worth trying, since the actual results of our unenlightened\r\negotism were that we were never paid the money anyway, and the chain of\r\nreparations--inflation--Hitler--brought us to this war upon which we\r\nare planning already to spend as a mere first installment four times\r\nas much as the whole sum we lent the Allies and lost in the last war.\r\nIt is significant that the very men who urged that we press without\r\nrespite for full payment of our World War debts, and thus helped make\r\nthis war inevitable, are the very men who today continue to try to make\r\nAmerica shirk her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Do you think a new League of Nations could be successful, since the\r\nold one failed so miserably?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, if we do our duty and make it possible for the League to work.\r\nWe blew the old League up when we refused to join it, and rejected the\r\nVersailles treaty and declined to join France and England in a treaty\r\nof mutual guarantee. With us not participating, the League was doomed\r\nfrom the start. Our withdrawal from Europe upset the balance of power\r\nso heavily in Germany’s favor that France, and eventually Britain, had\r\nto make out of the League a coalition against Germany. This they did.\r\nEven so it failed to keep the peace because Germany was stronger than\r\nall the League members together. Had we stayed in the League we might\r\nhave made collective security really work.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How could America have made the League work?_\r\n\r\nA. There is a popular belief that Germany might have remained a good\r\nneighbor and respectable member of society if the Weimar Republic had\r\nbeen better treated by France and her Allies. I am not sure of that,\r\nbut if it is true, let us ask why France treated Germany harshly\r\nthroughout the life of the Weimar Republic. The answer is that France\r\nwas afraid of Germany, and as we see today, with good reason. The\r\nFrench fear was based on the facts that there were twice as many\r\nGermans as French, and that these Germans had just about beaten France\r\nand all her Allies, including Great Britain, until the United States\r\nstepped in. Obviously the French reasoned the United States’ protection\r\nwas indispensable to French security. Without the United States in\r\nthe League the French had to look for security elsewhere. They sought\r\nit in encirclement of Germany and conversion of the League into an\r\nanti-German alliance.\r\n\r\nIf you object that the League is impracticable, let us ask what\r\nthere is to put in its place. I use the term League to indicate any\r\nassociation of nations for collective security. Isolationism was our\r\npolicy from 1919 to 1941. Its failure has been cosmic. The group of\r\nSenators and Congressmen who killed the League by preventing us from\r\njoining it were as responsible as Hitler for the war today. Twenty-two\r\nyears later the political successors of Wilson’s “willful men” made it\r\nappear to Hitler and Mussolini and the war party in Japan that we would\r\nnever stir and that aggressors could leave the United States completely\r\nout of their reckoning. Many of these men in the Senate and the House\r\nare today, as the isolationists were in 1919, actuated chiefly by an\r\nignoble hatred for their political opponent, the President.\r\n\r\nCarlton J. Hayes, professor of history at Columbia, says: “We were the\r\nfinal determining factor in winning the last World War, but more than\r\nany nation, even more than Nazi Germany, we have been responsible for\r\nlosing the peace and bringing on the present world war. We insisted\r\non our rights and spurned our duties. Victim ourselves of a bad kind\r\nof narrow nationalism, we repudiated the League of Nations which our\r\nPresident had fashioned and we thus set the pace for all of its later\r\nfloutings by other powers. Moreover we selfishly and shortsightedly\r\nrefused to forgive the inter-Allied debts and thereby prevented any\r\ntimely forgiving of the fateful German reparations. The result is that\r\nGermany now has Hitler, while we are accumulating a debt for national\r\ndefense which makes the inter-Allied debts and the reparations of the\r\nlast war seem trivial.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _If we did defeat Germany, could we then return to the kind of\r\npeaceful lives we led before this war began?_\r\n\r\nA. No, but the defeat of Germany is the indispensable condition for\r\nus to have any kind of tolerable life again. After this war, which is\r\nlikely to last many years still, we are going to be a different nation.\r\nWe are going to be more united than ever before. We are going to have\r\nshared common dangers, hopes, and fears, and for the first time since\r\nthe Civil War we are going to rise above our materialism and act for an\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nWe have never had to face real trouble together since the thirty\r\nmillion new members of our family arrived between 1870 and 1930. We did\r\nnot really suffer in the first World War; we never had a chance to test\r\nthe strength of our arms or the temper of our spirit. How many times\r\nhave we heard the question asked, whether we were “really” a nation?\r\nNow we shall have the chance to prove that we are. Now America will\r\ncome of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. FIFTH COLUMNISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What makes Lindbergh the way he is?_\r\n\r\nA. I am glad you asked this question because Lindbergh is our greatest\r\nnative individual threat to American safety and so deserves careful\r\nscrutiny by his fellow citizens who some day may be compelled to decide\r\nwhat to do with him. There is nothing to be gained by abusing him, nor\r\nis there any merit in arguing that his sincerity ought to protect him\r\nagainst the charge that he assists America’s Fifth Column.\r\n\r\nHitler’s most effective Fifth Columnists in every country have for\r\nthe most part been sincere men, but their sincerity has not relieved\r\nthem of the verdict of the fellow citizens they betrayed, nor of the\r\nverdict of history. The President of the United States has delivered\r\nthat verdict upon Lindbergh already. In the most polite and restrained\r\nlanguage he classified Colonel Lindbergh as a “Copperhead,” which was a\r\nCivil War name for a man in the North who sympathized with the Southern\r\ncause. Translated into today’s situation it would mean an American\r\ncitizen who sympathizes with the enemy of America, Germany.\r\n\r\nYou recollect the President was asked why Lindbergh, who was given a\r\nreserve commission in the Army Air Corps after his flight to Paris, had\r\nnot been called into active service. The President replied that during\r\nthe Civil War both sides let certain people go; that is, did not call\r\nthem into service.\r\n\r\nHe said the people who were thus ignored were the Vallandighams,\r\nand explained that the Vallandighams were the people who from\r\n1863 on, urged immediate peace, arguing that the North could\r\nnot win the war between the states. The President’s reference to\r\nVallandigham sent many to their reference books where they found\r\nthat Clement Laird Vallandigham, an Ohio Congressman “in 1863, made\r\nviolent speeches against the administration and was arrested by the\r\nmilitary authorities, tried by military commission and sentenced to\r\nimprisonment. President Lincoln commuted his sentence to banishment and\r\nVallandigham was sent into the Confederate lines, whence he made his\r\nway to Canada.”\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt was choosing his word carefully, in order to get\r\nthe precise shade of meaning attributed to it. The President apparently\r\ntried to find in American history as accurate a parallel to the\r\nLindbergh case as possible. His choice was significant. It would be\r\ninteresting to know if the President had in mind that when this country\r\nis formally at war with Germany we shall incarcerate or deport members\r\nof the community who for whatever reason and with whatever motives\r\nhinder the prosecution of the war. The expulsion of Vallandigham to\r\nthe enemy’s territory raises the question of the physical possibility\r\nas well as the political expediency of deporting our Fifth Columnists\r\nto German-controlled territory after we are formally at war. Few of us\r\nwill dispute the desirability of just such a radical solution.\r\n\r\nLindbergh replied to the President by resigning his commission in\r\na letter saying, “I had hoped that I might exercise my right as\r\nan American citizen to place my viewpoint before the people of my\r\ncountry in time of peace without giving up the privilege of serving my\r\ncountry as an Air Corps officer in the event of war.” Thereafter many\r\nprofessional critics of the President accused him of having attempted\r\nto gag Lindbergh. But the very opposite is the case since if the\r\nPresident had wanted to shut Lindbergh’s mouth, all he had to do was\r\nto call him to active service where the rule is universal that serving\r\nofficers may not make public political statements.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that Lindbergh, although a reserve officer,\r\nhad violently attacked his Commander in Chief’s actions in the field\r\nof foreign policy, which naturally involves military affairs, and this\r\ncould certainly be regarded as a breach of discipline in the spirit if\r\nnot in the letter of the officers’ code. If President Roosevelt had\r\nwished not only to muzzle, but to discipline Lindbergh, nothing would\r\nhave been easier than for the President to have ordered the Colonel to\r\nduty in some obscure, remote, or unpleasant post, a frequent method of\r\ndiscipline in the armed services of all countries. But the President\r\ndid nothing of the sort. On the contrary, by accepting Lindbergh’s\r\nresignation he released the flyer from any hindrance to the free speech\r\nwhich he has since been exercising so vigorously.\r\n\r\nBut Lindbergh is far more dangerous to American security than was\r\nVallandigham a danger to the Union in our Civil War. Lindbergh is\r\nalready the avowed candidate of our enormous crop of Copperheads for\r\nthe Presidency of the United States. He has the applause of the enemies\r\nof democracy and of the United States throughout the world. A Belgian\r\nbusinessman, a devout “collaborationist” with the Nazis, told a friend\r\nof mine recently, “Lindbergh will be the next President of the United\r\nStates. He could get along splendidly with Hitler. We are all for him.”\r\nBy “We” this Belgian meant the entire herd of Hitler followers, from\r\nhis own disciplined legions to the servile rabble of Vichy France and\r\nthe Copperheads of the United States. Whether Lindbergh welcomes it or\r\nnot, he has the enthusiastic applause of the Nazi Bund, the Fascist\r\nsocieties, and of all the most violently antidemocratic groups in this\r\ncountry, from the followers of Father Coughlin to the most eccentric\r\nKluxers.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But are we being fair to Lindbergh in calling him a Copperhead and\r\na Fifth Columnist? Didn’t you say yourself that there is nothing to be\r\ngained by abusing him?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, I maintain there is nothing to be gained by abusing him, but\r\nthere is much to be gained by identifying him. Nobody has done it any\r\nbetter than the country’s wittiest enemy of our enemies, Alexander\r\nWoollcott, in his “Voice from a Cracker Barrel” broadcast, when he\r\nsaid: “By the pledges of both candidates in the last election, by\r\nthe testimony of every poll yet taken by Dr. Gallup, by the action\r\nof our representatives in Congress and of the President himself, we\r\npledged full aid to England. Ex-Colonel Lindbergh now argues that this\r\nassistance be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n“He wants us to break our promise in the matter, to run out on the\r\nBritish, and, so curious is his mentality, he thinks to encourage us\r\nin such base desertion by assuring us that England is going to be\r\ndefeated. On this point he may be right. I would not know about that.\r\nNeither would he. If the words of our retired eagle ever reach as far\r\nas England, Mr. Churchill must derive some comfort from his knowledge\r\nthat all fighters in a tight place have heard such talk since the world\r\nbegan. Among Washington’s discomforts during the long winter at Valley\r\nForge was the repeated prediction from the Lindberghs of his day that\r\nhe didn’t have a chance. Yes, Lindbergh keeps announcing the doom of\r\nEngland, and always his statement is received with cheers and bursts of\r\napplause. This gives you a rough idea of what kind of people bulk large\r\nin his mass meetings.\r\n\r\n“For here is a fact which Lindbergh and his colleagues of the America\r\nFirst Committee must face. Whether they admit it or not, whether they\r\nlike it or not, whether, indeed, that is any part of their purpose,\r\nthey are working for Hitler. Have you any doubt--any doubt at all--that\r\nHitler would have been glad to pay Lindbergh an immense amount,\r\nmillions, for the work he has done in the past year?\r\n\r\n“Indeed, if Lindbergh shares the opinion of Hitler held by the rest\r\nof us--on this point, to be sure, he has thus far been ominously\r\nsilent--his heart must skip a beat when, in the still watches of the\r\nnight, he realizes that if he had returned to this country as Hitler’s\r\npaid and trusted agent, his public activity would have been in every\r\nparticular just what it has been to date.\r\n\r\n“Now don’t get me wrong about this. I doubt that Lindbergh has taken or\r\nwould take German money. It so happens that we do not know, and, thanks\r\nto the reticence of General Wood, have been unable to find out just\r\nwho has put up all the money for the costly goings-on of the America\r\nFirst Committee. But I should be greatly surprised to learn that any\r\nconsiderable part of that money came directly or indirectly from\r\nHitler. That does not alter the fact that they are all working for him.\r\nFor they, like the rest of us, are trapped in a tragic irony. In this\r\nworld today there is no such thing as neutrality. You are either for\r\nHitler or against him. You either fight him or you help him.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why can’t we put Lindbergh away somewhere now, so he can’t do any\r\nmore harm?_\r\n\r\nA. It is certainly an index to the feelings of the vast majority of\r\nthe American people that despite the fact that Lindbergh and Senator\r\nWheeler can draw large crowds of their Copperhead followers, I have\r\nreceived hundreds of questions like the one you ask, and there seems to\r\nbe little sectional, geographical difference in American feelings on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nJust as many have made the inquiry in California as in Texas or\r\nPennsylvania. The answer is that we cannot, and if we reflect upon it,\r\nwe do not want to put any limitations upon free speech for American\r\ncitizens in peacetime. Until we are actually at war it is the right of\r\nevery American to advocate, if he likes, that we should ally ourselves\r\nwith Germany and go to war against Great Britain. The distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic of democracy is not merely that the majority shall\r\ngovern, but that the majority should always give to the minority\r\nexactly the same rights and privileges as the majority enjoys.\r\n\r\nWe often overlook the fact that this is the essential nature\r\nof democracy. Rule by majority may obtain under any successful\r\ndictatorship. Hitler undoubtedly has a strong majority of Germans\r\nbehind him and will probably continue to have it until he falls by\r\nforce from abroad. But that does not make his rule democratic. He\r\nrefuses to give the minority opposing him any rights whatever. He\r\nconsiders it contemptible weakness of the democracies that they should\r\nprotect the rights of their minorities, and even of minority groups\r\nwho, if they were to come to power, would abolish democracy.\r\n\r\nHere is our central difficulty. We recognize that Lindbergh and his\r\nfollowers, the Nazis and Fascists, as well as that other antidemocratic\r\ngroup, the American Communists, would destroy America as we know it if\r\nthey were successful in their policies. Yet if we suppress them for\r\nanything less than formally treasonable acts, we shall have violated\r\nthe most precious tenet of democracy. Giving aid and comfort to the\r\nenemy in wartime is a formally treasonable act, and we may take\r\nconsolation in the fact that Wheeler and Lindbergh and their lesser\r\nassociates are not likely to be able to continue after we have gone\r\nto war to render to Hitler the aid and comfort they now render him.\r\nAt this moment, when we are not yet in a formal state of war, about\r\nthe most effective control that can be exercised over Lindbergh and\r\nhis associates is for the President to have identified him publicly\r\nas a “Vallandigham,” and for others to do what they can to expose his\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why do you single out Lindbergh for special attention, since there\r\nare many others of equal prominence who are also helping Hitler, such\r\nas ex-President Hoover, Senators Wheeler and Nye, Congressman Fish, and\r\nso on?_\r\n\r\nA. No, they are not of equal prominence, not even the ex-President,\r\nbecause Lindbergh had something that appealed so profoundly to America\r\nthat he has not lost it all yet, and he towers in influence above our\r\nother isolationists, some of whom are plainly patriotic but deluded\r\ncitizens. Lindbergh, however, is, I am convinced, mainly responsible\r\nfor the long hesitation of this country to go to war to defend its\r\nlife. I do not intend to impugn Lindbergh’s sincerity, but surely there\r\nis something wrong with a man who declares as he does that we should\r\nnot go to war, among other reasons, because we are not united, then\r\ndoes his utmost to disunite us still further.\r\n\r\nMayor La Guardia, in his capacity as Director of Civilian Defense,\r\npleaded at a mass meeting in Philadelphia for all Americans not in\r\nagreement with the Administration’s foreign policy not to do or\r\nsay anything that might give aid or comfort to a potential enemy.\r\nExactly twenty-four hours later, stepping on La Guardia’s heels,\r\nLindbergh addressed another mass meeting in Philadelphia and attacked\r\nthe President of the United States in terms so violent that they\r\nwere widely interpreted as calling for a revolution against the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIt was that famous speech which he was compelled to retract in part\r\nsince it alarmed so many even of his followers. Mrs. Kathleen Norris,\r\nthe novelist, a prominent member of the America First Committee, and\r\npresent on the platform with Lindbergh, told reporters that afternoon,\r\nin answer to a question, that she could “swear that no member of the\r\ncommittee is mixed up with any subversive activity.” “Subversive” means\r\n“tending to overthrow, upset, or destroy,” which is precisely what\r\nLindbergh’s speeches attempt to do to the Administration of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNone of the isolationist crowd can compare with Lindbergh in\r\nimportance to the Fifth Column in America. From the point of view\r\nof American national security and the future of this country he is\r\nAmerica’s Public Enemy Number One, because he was once so incomparably\r\nAmerica’s National Hero of Heroes, and some American people still hope\r\nthat now from their former idol, politically unbranded, apparently\r\ndisinterested, they can finally get the truth and the light. For\r\nthe most part, Americans do not realize what has happened to their\r\nNational Hero, although fortunately throughout the country there is a\r\ndeep-seated distrust of anyone who has taken up an attitude so palpably\r\nfavorable to the nation’s enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is the reason for the divorce between Lindbergh and the\r\nAmerican people who used to worship him unanimously? The crowds he\r\nhas at America First rallies may number thousands--mostly Nazis and\r\ntheir sympathizers, I take it--but Lindbergh used to have 130,000,000\r\nAmericans cheering him._\r\n\r\nA. Yes, what is it that has happened to Lindbergh to cause such a\r\nradical change? In 1927 Coolidge called him “noble”; in 1941 Roosevelt\r\nsaid he was “not wanted.” What a contrast! I have just finished reading\r\nfor the first time Lindbergh’s book called _We_, as he referred to\r\nhimself and his airplane, the _Spirit of St. Louis_, containing\r\nthe story of his life and flight. It moves one to sadness to look\r\nback and remember the way that world of long ago reacted to the\r\ntwenty-five-year-old American’s feat. Many of us have forgotten that\r\nthe flight itself became secondary to the world’s intoxication over the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nLindbergh received a more spectacular ovation, attended by more\r\npersons, who were more excited, in France, Belgium, England, and the\r\nUnited States than had ever been given any human being in the history\r\nof the world by any of the multitudes which have welcomed conquerors\r\nand kings.\r\n\r\nConsider the terms used by President Coolidge in referring to\r\nLindbergh; “this sincere and genuine exemplar of fine and noble\r\nvirtues”; “illustrious citizen”; “this genial, modest American youth\r\nwith the naturalness, the simplicity and the poise of true greatness”;\r\n“this wholesome, earnest, fearless, courageous product of America.” And\r\nas if this were not enough, Coolidge read off a list of “some of his\r\nqualities noted by the Army officers who examined him for promotion,\r\nas shown by reports in the files of the Militia Bureau of the War\r\nDepartment:\r\n\r\n“‘Intelligent,’ ‘industrious,’ ‘energetic,’ ‘dependable,’ ‘purposeful,’\r\n‘alert,’ ‘quick of reaction,’ ‘serious,’ ‘deliberate,’ ‘stable,’\r\n‘efficient,’ ‘frank,’ ‘modest,’ ‘congenial,’ ‘a man of good moral\r\nhabits and regular in all his business transactions.’”\r\n\r\nAnd then President Coolidge went on to say that “One of his officers\r\nexpressed his belief that the young man ‘would successfully complete\r\neverything he undertakes.’ This reads like a prophecy.”\r\n\r\nHeaven protect the American people if Lindbergh succeeds in his present\r\nundertaking, because he has undertaken now to keep America from meeting\r\nher peril before it becomes overwhelming. He wants us to wait until the\r\nonly allies left in the world for us are stricken down and we stand\r\nby ourselves to face a combination of powers stronger than we and\r\nunappeasably resolved to destroy us.\r\n\r\nHe has undertaken this task apparently as a sort of crusade. We are\r\nassured that his father before him, Charles Lindbergh, Congressman\r\nfrom Minnesota, also possessed the Lindbergh sincerity as he declaimed\r\nthroughout the last war against American participation. We recognize\r\nsincerity, persistence, and courage as admirable qualities when linked\r\nwith a just cause, but the possession of them only makes the matter\r\nworse when they are associated with a disastrous and cynical policy.\r\n\r\nYou ask “cynical”? Yes, Hitler, for example is a sincere cynic, and\r\nso is Lindbergh. His policy shamelessly declares we should withdraw\r\naid from Britain, coolly watch her fall, and then as quickly as\r\npossible trade with Hitler and make what we can out of the defeat\r\nof civilization. Lindbergh genuinely sees nothing to be ashamed of\r\nin advocating such a policy, and that makes him deserve the title\r\n“sincere.” It is nevertheless as cynical as any Nazi could invent. We\r\ncould stomach that if the cynicism were realistic. It is not. This\r\nwould-be smart policy has no more chance to succeed than the would-be\r\nMachiavellian policy of Mussolini, who has given the world its least\r\nappetizing sight of the war: the avowed brute too feeble to be brutal.\r\n\r\nLindbergh’s personality is important to us all, since he has assumed\r\noffice as a member of what they would call in England “the disloyal\r\nopposition,” and so it is not too minor a point to note that of all\r\nthe qualities he was ever credited with, the quality of generosity is\r\nlacking. Witness his experience with France and England. To France\r\nand the French people he owed the beginning of the ovation which was\r\nto make his fame and fortune, and he acknowledged his debt this way\r\nin _We_: “The whole-hearted welcome to me--an American--touched me\r\nbeyond any point that words can express. I left France with a debt of\r\ngratitude which, though I cannot repay it, I shall always remember.”\r\nThat was the old Lindbergh, or rather the young one, still unspoiled.\r\n\r\nThirteen years later, when France stood more in need of a friend than\r\never in her long and troubled history; when a mere gesture of American\r\nsolidarity with her cause might have put heart in her bewildered troops\r\nand kept the enemy at bay; when the word of a Lindbergh could have been\r\neffective in the awakening of American public opinion to our obligation\r\nnot to let France fall, for our own sake as well as for hers; Lindbergh\r\nspoke. He spoke against America’s giving France any aid whatever.\r\nIt was May 20, 1940 and the Germans stood on the Somme. Lindbergh’s\r\nbroadcast summarized everything he has had to say since: “Years ago we\r\ndecided to stay out of foreign wars. We based our military policy on\r\nthat decision. We must not waver now that the crisis is at hand. There\r\nis no longer time for us to enter this war successfully.”\r\n\r\nI was with the French at that time and can testify that Lindbergh’s\r\nwords struck France like a blow between the eyes. The famous Lafayette\r\nEscadrille announced that it had deprived Lindbergh of his honorary\r\nmembership. Lindbergh’s response to England was identical. He took\r\nhis child to England after he had suffered his great family tragedy\r\nin America, and in England he received everything he desired: quiet\r\nhospitality and all the privacy he has said he wanted. But when\r\nEngland stood with her back to the wall, and once again the American\r\nattitude to the war became decisive; and once again the voice of a\r\nLindbergh could have worked powerfully to shake our people into the\r\ntardy realization that this time would be the last time and that if\r\nwe did not awaken now we might never be given the chance again; when\r\nour people needed to realize that the fate of America was inextricably\r\nbound up with the fate of Britain, and that if Britain fell our hopes\r\nwould all become forlorn; then Lindbergh spoke.\r\n\r\nNow, he declared, we should cease to aid Britain in any manner, because\r\nBritain was beaten, Germany had won, and we had better make the best\r\nterms we could with the conqueror. With the total lack of shame\r\nwhich characterizes Hitler’s and Lindbergh’s political philosophy he\r\ndeclaimed in the same speech of June 16, 1940 that, “Fortunately, the\r\nwide wall of the Atlantic stands between us and the shooting that is\r\ngoing on.” It is, of course, the strong wall of the British Navy that\r\nstands between us and the shooting that is going on, but Lindbergh has\r\nnever admitted that the British Navy plays any role in keeping the\r\nGermans from crossing the Atlantic; his implication is that the water\r\nof the Atlantic constitutes the sole hindrance to German passage.\r\n\r\nThis incomprehension sometimes reaches a degree which is puzzling to\r\nan observer convinced that “at any rate Lindbergh is sincere.” Some\r\nobviously honest Americans argue that we can successfully hold aloof,\r\nbut can any American really believe as Lindbergh said in his speech\r\nat the opening of the war, September 16, 1939: “These wars in Europe\r\nare not wars in which civilization is defending herself against some\r\nAsiatic intruder. There is no Genghis Khan or Xerxes marching against\r\nour Western nations. This is not a question of banding together to\r\ndefend the white race against foreign invasion. This is simply one more\r\nof those age-old struggles within our family of nations.”\r\n\r\nIf Lindbergh believes this, he has failed utterly to understand what\r\nHitlerism is, or if he understands it, then he must approve of it; and\r\nwe surmised some months later with the publication of Anne Lindbergh’s\r\n_The Wave of the Future_, that he was indeed a convert. Surely it is\r\nnot the color of Hitler’s skin and of his Nazi warriors that make\r\nthe difference, nor their geographic home. Lindbergh implies that if\r\nthey were yellow-skinned and came from Tibet, he would understand and\r\nperhaps not oppose our fighting them, but being white and living in\r\nCentral Europe they cannot, he implies, be enemies of civilization.\r\nThis and other examples of Lindbergh’s apparent naïveté, or as Raymond\r\nClapper put it once, his childishness, are not the result of an obtuse\r\nmind, but the consequence of his having constantly to hide one element,\r\nthe most important element in his political attitude, and that is his\r\nsecret approval of the totalitarian idea and of the German Nazis’ right\r\nto conquer.\r\n\r\nThis is too unpopular an idea to admit publicly now, and the\r\nconcealment of it leads to the most glaring discrepancies in his\r\narguments. Only a person who approved of Hitler could deny that he is\r\nwaging a war against civilization. Only Lindbergh can tell how far he\r\napproves of Hitler’s right to conquer. We can observe that in other\r\ncountries, as France, men who talked before the defeat as Lindbergh\r\ndoes now, were elevated to power in Hitler’s puppet government.\r\n\r\nI was in England when Lindbergh delivered the first of his broadcasts\r\ncalling it “just another war,” and putting both belligerents on the\r\nsame level. The British were hurt. They felt that a man whom they had\r\nconsidered a friend had let them down. They did not know that he had\r\nnever been a friend, but beneath a serene, impenetrable demeanor had\r\nharbored an antipathy for England which has contributed to making him\r\n“the way he is.”\r\n\r\nThis antipathy he has more than once documented, as in the _Collier’s_\r\narticle when he wrote the astounding sentence: “We in America should\r\nnot be discussing whether we will enter _the war that England\r\ndeclared in Europe_.” Let those who set such store by the quality of\r\nsincerity ask themselves if anyone on earth, including a German, could\r\n_sincerely_ define the present war as one “that England declared in\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But you still have not explained why Lindbergh is the way he is.\r\nYou have only defined what he is._\r\n\r\nA. Very well, but this is merely a personal interpretation of what\r\nbuilt his character and formed his motives. I believe in the importance\r\nof emotional causes for most of men’s attitudes, and so I should\r\nlike to mention these causes first. The young Lindbergh, as one can\r\ndiscover from _We_, seems really to have been possessed of the virtues\r\ncatalogued by President Coolidge. He became the Lindbergh of today\r\nonly after his flight. First came the initial impact of the hysterical\r\nreaction of the world to his accomplishment. It is bound to have\r\naffected him, and it did, despite the fact that he appeared to the\r\npublic as still the simple, modest, somewhat shy boy who carried with\r\nhim on his flight an introduction to the American Ambassador to Paris.\r\n\r\nIt took the public a long time to learn otherwise, because from the\r\nmoment of his landing in Paris until only a comparatively short time\r\nago, Lindbergh was protected by the press of America in a way that\r\ncould happen only in this youthful country of hero-worshipers. When\r\nAmerica has a hero, he remains a hero of purest ray serene, and no flaw\r\nmay be found in him, and if any are privately discovered by newspaper\r\nreporters, or others, they are carefully hidden. This is our standard\r\nbehavior toward heroes, but in the case of America’s hero of heroes the\r\ninhibitions voluntarily imposed by the press upon itself were Spartan.\r\n\r\nIn newspaper parlance a sacred cow is an individual who for reasons of\r\npolicy must be protected from criticism. Every newspaper has its sacred\r\ncows. Lindbergh became the Supreme Sacred Cow of all the newspapers\r\nin America. Long after it became apparent to the working newspapermen\r\nwho came in contact with him that he had succumbed to the adulation\r\npoured upon him and had completely lost that original modesty which\r\nhad endeared him to the American public, perhaps above all his other\r\nqualities, and that he had, in fact, become impatiently egotistic,\r\nand convinced that he “knew it all,” he still was represented as the\r\nunassuming young man who aspired only to be left alone. He complained\r\nthat the press would not let him alone, gave him no privacy, harassed\r\nhim. Publicity, he declared, he hated worse than anything in the world.\r\nNewspapermen nevertheless observed that he and Greta Garbo appeared to\r\nhave the same technique, and that he managed always to behave himself\r\nin such a way as to receive the greatest amount of public attention.\r\n\r\nThe normal cycle of publicity received by a celebrity of the type of\r\nLindbergh was summed up by Sinclair Lewis. He and I were standing\r\nat the bar in the Adlon Hotel in Berlin a few days after Lindbergh\r\nlanded in Paris, and the world had gone mad over him. It seemed as\r\nthough never had such adulation been poured upon the head of any young\r\nman, and those who were not joining in the almost universal blaze of\r\nhysterical feeling were curiously examining the blaze, wondering what\r\nmade the world go crazy.\r\n\r\nSurely there had been more heroic exploits, even in the realm of\r\naviation. The flight of Bleriot over the Channel in the primitive\r\nmachine at his disposal in 1909 has been estimated a more important\r\nfeat; while the flight of John Alcock and A. W. Brown from Newfoundland\r\nto Ireland, June 14, 1919, although almost forgotten in the din of\r\nLindbergh’s ovation, was not only the first transoceanic flight, but\r\nconsidering that it was made eight years before Lindbergh’s with a\r\nmachine correspondingly less modern, should rank as a greater feat. All\r\nthese things were subjects of discussion, but Sinclair Lewis settled\r\nthe matter by saying: “It doesn’t matter. Lindbergh is the best-known\r\nman in the world today, but ten years from now he will go into a hotel\r\nin Detroit and sign the register, ‘Charles A. Lindbergh,’ and the room\r\nclerk will say ‘Lindbergh? Yes, Mr. Lindbergh, Room 502. Boy! Show Mr.\r\nLindbergh his room,’ and the clerk won’t know him from Adam’s off ox.\r\nThat’s the way it is with fame. He has come by his with incredible\r\nspeed; it will go the same way.”\r\n\r\nBut it did not. Lindbergh saw to that by behaving so eccentrically at\r\ntimes that even his mother-in-law, Mrs. Dwight Morrow, has been heard\r\nto complain of it. I was in London at the time of the birth of his baby\r\nthere. Lindbergh for reasons of his own withheld formal announcement of\r\nthe birth until long after it had taken place and the fact was known to\r\nso many persons that eventually the newspapers, although with British\r\nreticence, carried the report and queried Lindbergh to his great\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n“I said to Charles,” Mrs. Morrow exclaimed to a friend, “if you want to\r\navoid being bothered by the press, why don’t you simply announce the\r\nbirth of your child? After all he’s normal and born within wedlock.”\r\nDouglas Corrigan confirmed the judgment of Lindbergh’s mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n“Wrong-way Corrigan,” who flew to Ireland in the alleged belief that he\r\nwas flying to California, was a devoted disciple of Lindbergh. I met\r\nCorrigan in Dublin shortly after he landed, and I remember two things\r\nhe told me which shed some light on Lindbergh’s character. I was\r\nalmost the first newspaperman to see Corrigan, and in our introductory\r\nconversation the little Irish flyer, whose flight in many ways was more\r\nremarkable than Lindbergh’s, said: “I’m not going to do like Lindbergh\r\nand be hounded to death by newspapermen. He refuses to see them and\r\nwon’t say anything for quotation and makes himself so mysterious that\r\nthey never have stopped going after him. If he had only opened up to\r\nthem from the very first and never refused to see them, very soon\r\nthey would have let him alone. That’s what I’m going to do--tell you\r\nanything you want to know, and go on seeing anybody who wants to see\r\nme, and pretty soon you will all get tired of it.”\r\n\r\nCorrigan did just that and it all worked out exactly as he had\r\nplanned. He was soon left in peace and never suffered from Lindbergh’s\r\ncomplaint. If Lindbergh had behaved as Corrigan did, there never would\r\nhave grown up between American newspapermen and himself the secret feud\r\nthat required all his prestige as national hero to keep under cover.\r\nYou may say that Corrigan’s flight could not be compared to Lindbergh’s\r\nin its sensational appeal as the first solo flight across the ocean.\r\nYes, but in another way the obscure little Irishman’s flight was the\r\nmore audacious of the two. Lindbergh had a plane specially constructed,\r\nthe finest money could buy. He had lavish financial backing, friends\r\nto help him at every turn. Corrigan had nothing but his own ambition,\r\ncourage, and ability. His plane, a nine-year-old Curtis Robin, was the\r\nmost wretched-looking jalopy.\r\n\r\nAs I looked over it at the Dublin airdrome I really marveled that\r\nanyone should have been rash enough even to go in the air with it, much\r\nless try to fly the Atlantic. He built it, or rebuilt it, practically\r\nas a boy would build a scooter out of a soapbox and a pair of old\r\nroller skates. It looked it. The nose of the engine hood was a mass of\r\npatches soldered by Corrigan himself into a crazy-quilt design. The\r\ndoor behind which Corrigan crouched for twenty-eight hours was fastened\r\ntogether with a piece of baling wire. The reserve gasoline tanks\r\nput together by Corrigan, left him so little room that he had to sit\r\nhunched forward with his knees cramped, and not enough window space to\r\nsee the ground when landing. It had cost Corrigan $325, saved nickel by\r\nnickel.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for all of Corrigan’s sacrifice was his hero worship of\r\nLindbergh. As a young mechanic Corrigan had helped build the _Spirit\r\nof St. Louis_ in the Ryan Airlines plant in San Diego, California, and\r\nfrom that time on he had lived for but one ambition, to emulate his\r\nhero. The older flyer had millions of admirers but none could have been\r\nmore fervent than the little mechanic who once wrote, “It was often\r\nnecessary to work till midnight on the _Spirit of St. Louis_ and then\r\ncome back at eight the next morning, but everyone was glad to do that\r\nas they all seemed to be inspired by the fellow that the plane was\r\nbeing built for--Lindbergh.”\r\n\r\nWhen Corrigan landed in Dublin, it was an event sufficiently\r\nsensational, and the “wrong-way” aspect of it so eccentric, that the\r\nworld gave its attention and hundreds of cables and radiograms poured\r\ninto the American Legation where the Minister, John Cudahy, had given\r\nCorrigan quarters. Every hour scores of congratulations were reaching\r\nCorrigan but he was visibly unhappy. I asked him what was the matter.\r\n\r\n“No cable from Lindbergh,” Corrigan replied. “That was the thing I\r\nwanted most of all. Maybe it will come later.” It never did come.\r\nLindbergh never found time nor inclination to send the single word\r\nwhich would have meant more to Corrigan than all the other applause and\r\nrewards he won. I have related this to friends of Lindbergh and their\r\nanswer was, “Typical.”\r\n\r\nAfter the first uproar over Lindbergh’s greatest flight had subsided\r\nsomewhat, he made his good-will flights. His marriage to the gifted\r\nAnne Morrow, daughter of the brilliant Morgan partner, Dwight Morrow,\r\nlinked him now with America’s greatest financial house, and put the\r\nSwedish immigrant’s son definitely in the category of those who have\r\na stake to protect against social disturbance, and the consequences\r\nof war. The fact that the marriage was a love match, and that his wife\r\nhad every quality of a distinguished person and was a poet in her own\r\nright, helped establish Lindbergh even more firmly in the affections of\r\nthe American public. The American feeling toward him had mellowed from\r\nhysterical hero worship to what seemed to be a love which would endure.\r\n\r\nThen came the heart-breaking tragedy of the kidnaping and murder of his\r\nchild. All fathers, all mothers, throughout the world suffered with\r\nthe Lindberghs. Years later during the Spanish Civil War, when I was\r\nimprisoned by orders of the Gestapo in San Sebastian, with me was a\r\nSpanish workman who that night was taken from the cell and shot, and\r\nI remember how just before the door opened and he was summoned by his\r\nexecutioners, he was discussing the Lindbergh kidnaping.\r\n\r\nThe world-wide outpouring of sympathy with the Lindberghs during\r\nthat woeful period of their lives was surpassed only by the intense,\r\npersonal, national compassion of America for them in their pain. Now\r\nLindbergh had become no longer just the national hero, but one for\r\nwhom the nation felt the intimacy of suffering shared. He responded by\r\nleaving the country with his family to quit the scene of their sorrow,\r\nto find a sanctuary to heal their wounds, to escape public attention,\r\nand to find a safety for his children he felt he could not find in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis was the turning point of his relationship with his country. His\r\ncountry was ready to forgive because it felt it could understand his\r\nneed for a refuge, but for Lindbergh his residence abroad was a true\r\nrenunciation of democratic America, and this I believe to be the key to\r\nhis subsequent political activity and his present defiance of the vast\r\nmajority of his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nHe found his sought-for refuge in England where he was given every\r\nconsideration. The door of every home from Buckingham Palace down\r\nwas open to him, but the British afforded him all the privacy he\r\nwanted. If it had been only privacy he sought, he could have led a\r\nrestful secluded life in the country home of Harold Nicolson, his\r\nfather-in-law’s biographer, and could have remained at peace until\r\nHitler disturbed it. Lindbergh spent just enough time in England to\r\nconvince him that England was soft, England couldn’t take it, England\r\nwould lose if it ever went to war. It was bad luck that Lindbergh\r\nshould have lived in England during a time when it _was_ soft, just\r\nas we are soft today. It was the England of pacifism, faith in the\r\nprinciple that if you want peace badly enough you can have it, just\r\nby refusing to fight. It was the England of the Oxford Union when the\r\ndebating society boys voted not to fight “for King and Country.” It was\r\nthe England which needed waking up, just as we need it today. It was\r\nan England that could get hard, if it had the time, just as we can get\r\nhard too, if we have the time.\r\n\r\nBut Lindbergh formed his opinion of England then, and from his public\r\nspeeches he seems too stubborn to allow even the epic heroism of\r\nEngland today in battle to change his judgment. Nicolson, long-standing\r\nfamily friend of the Morrows, mailed Lindbergh a postcard every\r\nweek during the Battle of Britain, when the people of England were\r\npersevering under a hurricane of bombs and were calling it their\r\n“finest hour.” Each postcard had the one sentence: “Do you still think\r\nwe are soft?” Perhaps he still thinks so, long after the Germans\r\nhave stopped thinking so. At any rate, he left England for a tour of\r\nthe continent, and thereupon came the second turning point in the\r\ndevelopment of his political views.\r\n\r\nWhen he left America he left it embittered by the tragedy of his child,\r\nand he left convinced that it would never have happened except in a\r\ncorrupt, gang-ridden democracy. It was, indeed, one of the lowest\r\nperiods in America’s public life, when kidnaping for ransom had become\r\nwidespread for the first time in any modern civilized state, and the\r\npower of the gangs was a national humiliation. In a sense it was true\r\nthat it was the fault of democracy, but the virtue of democracy is\r\nthat slowly but almost always sooner or later we correct the faults\r\nand bring under control the license which ever threatens democratic\r\nliberty. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however, had not grown up\r\nwhen Lindbergh fled America.\r\n\r\nHe visited many places on the continent, but the visits to Germany and\r\nthe Soviet Union were decisive. Here were crystallized the political\r\nideas which had been fermenting within him ever since he felt the\r\nthrill that came with the first taste of power over the throngs of\r\nAmericans gathered to adore him. In Russia he found the object of his\r\npolitical hatred: the poverty, squalor, dirt, inefficiency, and cruelty\r\nof the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. He was treated well by the\r\nBolshevik authorities, who as Russians regarded him as an artist, a\r\ngenius of the air, a man who, like a great singer, could be considered\r\noutside of politics.\r\n\r\nHis political slate was up to that time blank. The Russians often\r\nwelcome foreign celebrities supposed to be without politics. They gave\r\nHarpo Marx a cordial reception. Lindbergh was shown the Red Army, its\r\nAir Corps, the aviation factories, and no doubt the Bolsheviks thought\r\nhe was impressed. A layman traveling through Russia is shocked at the\r\nwretched state of the people, their poor clothing, bad food, their\r\nbrutal overcrowding. You may be sure that this was not the prime object\r\nof Lindbergh’s attention. Lindbergh is not interested in human beings.\r\nHe is interested in machines. In Russia he saw the poorest machine\r\nhe had ever seen. He observed that the ponderous Bolshevik society\r\noperated with an unparalleled waste of man power and with unmatched\r\ninefficiency. He saw the Soviet Air factories, and declared he detected\r\nthe slovenly workmanship which mars all Soviet production. He reviewed\r\nportions of the Red Army Air Corps and registered his opinion that most\r\nof the planes were obsolete or obsolescent.\r\n\r\nIn Nazi Germany Lindbergh found the object of his political admiration,\r\neven affection, for here at last he had found the perfect machine.\r\nNot only was it the antithesis in every material respect of the\r\nSoviet Union, a streamlined, chromium-plated, eighteen-jewel model of\r\ntotalitarian clockwork, compared with the dilapidated Soviet jalopy,\r\nbut the Nazi machine also promised to banish the Soviet menace from the\r\nface of the earth. Lindbergh had in Germany first an aesthetic delight\r\nin the efficiency of the machine, then a moral satisfaction in the\r\nthought that it would eradicate the blot of Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nFinally a personal consideration came to him. The kidnaping and death\r\nof his baby could never have happened in Nazi Germany. Common crime\r\nwas almost unknown in Nazi Germany. He failed to reflect that under\r\nthe dictators crime is reserved as the monopoly of the State, and that\r\nfrom any normal human standpoint there is more crime committed in Nazi\r\nGermany in a year than in America in ten years of its most besotted\r\ngangster period, only in Germany it is all committed by the State.\r\nLindbergh loved Germany.\r\n\r\nHe saw the great Army, then in the last stages of readying itself to\r\nspring upon Europe and set out to conquer the world. He saw the great\r\nLuftwaffe, and Goering himself “surprised” him by pinning the Service\r\nCross of the Order of the German Eagle with Star on his breast before\r\nhe could help himself. Lindbergh has not yet divested himself of his\r\nNazi decoration. He laid down his commission because he quarreled with\r\nthe President of the United States, but he has no quarrel with Hitler.\r\n\r\nLindbergh was so delighted with the whole atmosphere of this perfectly\r\nfunctioning totalitarian machine that he was contemplating making\r\nhis residence in Berlin, where an American news agency reported\r\nthat the apartment of a Jew, liquidated in the monster pogrom of\r\nNovember 1938, had been offered him. He stayed long enough to become\r\nconvinced that the Nazis were the wave, which, whether we liked it\r\nor not, would eventually engulf the world. Lindbergh liked it. Here\r\nwere no democratic gangsterism, corruption, private crime. Here were\r\nno Bolshevik slackness, squalor, waste. Here was the New Order, of\r\nsuperior men, like himself, of tall, blond, blue-eyed Aryans, like\r\nhimself, of Nordics, like himself. He felt among his own kind.\r\n\r\nThe Terror, the concentration camps, the murderous persecution of the\r\nJews and political opponents, the suppression of free speech, of the\r\npress, of worship, even of thought and conscience! What of it! This was\r\nonly the scum on the wave of the future, and as for the suppression\r\nof the press, _that_ at least was no scum, that was sheer progress.\r\nThe literal enslavement of a whole population! Well, they like it,\r\ndon’t they? What of the fact that the entire machine and every part\r\nof it was built for war, and for war which if successful in Europe\r\nwould eventually reach and thrust at the heart of America? Nonsense,\r\nthe Germans could whip Europe all right, indeed Lindbergh declared his\r\nconviction they would, but they intended no harm to America. He knew,\r\nbecause hadn’t they been nice to him, an American? Anyway, he wouldn’t\r\nsay anything about it in public, but if the truth be known, America\r\ncould go a long way and do worse than by emulating some of the Nazis’\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nLiberty? Bah, Lindbergh would take order and efficiency any day ahead\r\nof liberty and inefficiency. Besides, Lindbergh was one of the class of\r\nsuperior men, superior in talent, ability, and comprehension of what\r\nsociety needs, who in a totalitarian state would enjoy all the freedom\r\nhe wanted since his ideas would conform with those of the rulers and he\r\nwould belong to the company of masters of the New Order. He had nothing\r\nto fear from a Nazi conquest.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts in mind Lindbergh returned first to England\r\nand told them they had better give up because the Russians were no\r\ngood and the Germans knew it, and the Germans were strong enough to\r\nconquer all Europe, and the proof was in the air forces he had just\r\ninspected. His advice was believed to have had something to do with the\r\ndisaster of Munich, when Britain and France, convinced their cause\r\nwas hopeless, lost a war without fighting it. In every point of his\r\nargument Lindbergh had agreed with Hitler, and in every point Lindbergh\r\nand Hitler were correct, save in one point. They made a mistake about\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWhen England recovered from the shock of Munich, she began to throw\r\noff her weakness and get tough. But Lindbergh had left for America. He\r\ndid not have time to see England recover the manhood which seemed lost\r\nwhen he was there. Lindbergh came home now bursting with a message,\r\neager to lead, anxious to play a political role, and resolved as he has\r\nbeen all his life to be content with nothing less than the greatest\r\nrole. “Lindbergh will be the next President of the United States. He\r\nis our man.” So said the Belgian friend of the Nazis. The British\r\nLindbergh, Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, is\r\non the political bottom; he is in Brixton prison. Mosley is no less\r\nsincere a man than Lindbergh. Vidkun Quisling is on the political top;\r\nhe is Hitler’s man in Norway. The political future of Lindbergh will\r\nobviously depend largely upon whether Germany or our side wins the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Why did Lindbergh attack the Jews?_\r\n\r\nA. Because anti-Semitism is an integral part of Hitlerism. If you\r\nare not against Hitler you are for him, and if you are for Hitler\r\nyou will be compelled, sooner or later, and whether you intend it or\r\nnot, to become an anti-Semite. Every country now under Hitler’s heel\r\nhas officially sponsored and promoted anti-Semitism. It was easy to\r\nread Lindbergh’s anti-Semitism between the lines of his references to\r\nthe “foreign” influences at work in America. He waited only until he\r\nthought the time ripe for his public announcement, but the results\r\nproved his calculation wrong. His statement against the Jews brought a\r\nroar of repudiation from all creeds and classes of the nation, and the\r\nonly approval came from the group around Lindbergh who constitute what\r\nmight be called the America First’s Quisling Committee. Lindbergh’s\r\nanti-Semitism could be sufficiently explained on the ground of\r\ntemperament. He admires, he understands, and loves only machines and\r\nhe could hardly be expected to understand or appreciate, much less\r\napprove, the spiritual values which for thousands of years have upheld\r\nthe Jews through adversities which would have annihilated scores of\r\nmore numerous but less faithful communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What is to be the fate of the Jews?_\r\n\r\nA. If Hitler’s power is not destroyed, if Hitler were to win, all Jews\r\nunder his domination would be condemned to slow death. Why slow? Why\r\ndoesn’t Hitler kill them all at once? Because he enjoys watching them\r\nsuffer, has a sadistic pleasure in it; because he needs their labor\r\npower for the menial tasks to which he assigns them; and because he\r\nprobably feels that until he conquers the whole world it would be wiser\r\nnot to outrage what there is left of world opinion.\r\n\r\nBesides, Hitler finds the Jews useful wherever he wishes to divide a\r\nconquered population, as in France where the hostages he shoots are for\r\nthe most part called Jews or Communists. Every time he shoots a Jewish\r\nhostage he says to the non-Jews, “You see, if it were not for your\r\nJews, you and I could get along perfectly together!” By this device of\r\nmaking the Jew the scapegoat, he works to arouse anti-Semitism among\r\nthe vanquished and anti-Semitism in any form anywhere is the most\r\nfaithful handmaid of Hitlerism.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he has not completely eliminated the Jews from any part of\r\nhis territories, but has allowed to remain, under conditions of the\r\nmost abject servitude, 200,000 out of the original 660,000 in Germany\r\nproper; 40,000 out of the original 190,000 in Austria; 100,000 out of\r\n380,000 in Czechoslovakia; 20,000 out of 156,000 in Holland; 30,000 out\r\nof 63,000 in Belgium; an estimated 380,000 native and foreign Jews in\r\nFrance, occupied and unoccupied; 750,000 in Hungary, including everyone\r\nwith one-quarter Jewish blood; 300,000 in truncated Rumania; 97,000 in\r\nLatvia; 177,000 in Lithuania; 5,000 in Esthonia; and 100,000 in Greece.\r\nThese figures are cited by _The American Hebrew_. Poland must come\r\nin a separate category since there Hitler has apparently set out to\r\nexterminate the 3,000,000 Jews without the restraint he seems to have\r\nput on himself elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNobody knows how many of the Polish Jews have died; their fate is only\r\nmore dreadful than that inflicted upon the entire Polish population.\r\nSober observers believe that twenty per cent of the Polish population\r\nas a whole have been killed or have died as a result of the two\r\nyears of German and Russian occupation. If this is true, then of the\r\n6,000,000 dead, one must reckon that at least 1,000,000 are Jews.\r\nWhether this figure is too high or too low, the obvious intent of the\r\nGermans in Poland is to wipe out the Jews altogether, and the wonder is\r\nthat any at all are living today.\r\n\r\nIn Soviet Russia the 5,000,000 Jews are not subject to any official\r\ndiscrimination, but suffer as the rest of the population from the\r\ngenerally wretched conditions of life aggravated by the war. These\r\nconditions of life in the Soviet Union would be intolerable under\r\nnormal circumstances, especially since the Jews, like other faiths,\r\nhave been deprived of the facilities formally to practice their\r\nreligion, but now that Europe under the Nazis has become a charnel\r\nhouse for Jews, the Soviet Union must seem like a haven of refuge.\r\nThere seems to be no alternative for the Jews except that they suffer\r\ndeath at the hands of Hitlerism, or that Hitlerism be destroyed. It can\r\nbe destroyed better with the outspoken, avowed help of the Jews of the\r\nworld, and especially the Jews of America.\r\n\r\nIt is shocking, indeed, to observe the names of a few Jews on\r\nisolationist committees, and one wonders what mental processes have\r\nbrought them there. Do they imagine that if America remains aloof\r\nand Hitler wins the rest of the world, that the Jews, or any other\r\nAmericans, will be safe? No, if Hitler wins the rest of the world, the\r\nLindberghs of America will boldly put their anti-Semitism to work, and\r\nthe fate of the Jews in America will approximate that of their brothers\r\nabroad. There is no choice for the Jews of America but to put all the\r\nstrength of their bodies and souls and purses to work against the enemy\r\nof all mankind. There is no reason for them to apologize for fighting\r\nthe universal scourge. The anti-Semite is a friend of Hitler. The\r\nfriend of Hitler is the enemy of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _I would like to read you a passage from a speech of Lindbergh\r\ndelivered shortly after the German invasion of Russia, and ask you\r\nwhat you think of it, as it is quite confusing to me. The passage\r\nreads: “The longer this war in Europe continues, the more confused its\r\nissues become. When it started Germany and Russia were lined up against\r\nEngland and France. Now, less than two years later we find Russia and\r\nEngland fighting France and Germany. Winter before last, when Russia\r\nwas fighting Finland, the interventionists demanded that we send all\r\npossible aid to Finland. Now, when Russia is fighting Finland again\r\nthey demand that we send all possible aid to Russia.... Finland and\r\nFrance are now our enemies; Russia our friend. We have been asked to\r\ndefend the English way of life, and the Chinese way of life. We are\r\nnow asked to defend the Russian way of life.... Judging from Europe’s\r\nrecord, if we enter this war, we can’t be sure whether we will have\r\nGermany or Russia for a partner by the time we finish it. We don’t even\r\nknow whether we will end up with France or England on our side. It is\r\nquite possible that we would find ourselves alone fighting the entire\r\nworld before it was over.”_\r\n\r\nA. The confusion is of Lindbergh’s own making. There is a simple key\r\nto all the apparent contradictions he brings out. The key is that\r\nHitler Germany was, is, and will remain the enemy until Hitlerism is\r\ndestroyed. The correct way to express the relationships which Lindbergh\r\nhas put so confusingly is: All nations fighting Germany are fighting\r\non our side; all nations fighting on the side of Germany are fighting\r\nagainst us. When a nation, for any reason, switches sides, for or\r\nagainst Germany, it automatically switches sides for or against us.\r\nThe question of friendship, of liking for any of these nations, or of\r\napproval of their “way of life” does not decide the matter. The matter\r\nis decided solely by the effect the particular nation is having on\r\nGermany’s war.\r\n\r\nLet us examine each of Lindbergh’s statements in turn. He says the\r\nlonger the war continues, the more confused its issues become. Not at\r\nall--the longer it lasts the more plain it becomes that the issue is:\r\nGermany against the world. Do not be confused by the fact that some\r\ncountries which were fighting Germany, now come out on Germany’s side.\r\nAs Germany conquers one country after another, she attempts to force\r\nthem into fighting for her, as in the case of France. No matter what\r\nHitler’s puppet government in France does, we know that the true France\r\nis no friend of Germany, but an implacable enemy. Napoleon at one time\r\nhad half a dozen armies raised from among the peoples he had conquered,\r\nmarching under his banners. But the moment Napoleon suffered reverses,\r\nthey revolted. So it will be with Hitler.\r\n\r\nFinland’s position is easy to understand if you reflect that she was\r\nso much subject to Hitler’s coercion that she had to behave almost\r\nas though she too had been conquered. It would have been suicide if\r\nFinland, resisting Germany’s demands that she join the German side,\r\nshould have had to fight both the German and the Russian armies. That\r\nway Poland was torn to pieces. It would have been unthinkable that\r\nFinland, so recently mutilated by Russia, should have admitted the Red\r\nArmy to her territories. It was inevitable that Finland should choose\r\nthe lesser of two evils. And so we, understanding Finland’s plight,\r\nmust classify her on Germany’s side and embargo goods to her. But we\r\ncan still think of her as a friend, and only as a technical enemy by\r\nforce of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe position of Russia is equally clear. Bolshevik Russia, the Soviet\r\nUnion, is nobody’s friend, and never pretended to be. She, like\r\nGermany, is “against the world,” and by making the pact with Germany\r\nat the beginning of the war she expected to see the world eventually\r\ncollapse and become her loot. Now that Germany has forced Russia to\r\nfight, Russia should enjoy every material aid we can give her. As long\r\nas she continues to fight Germany, we should do all we can to help\r\nher blows injure our enemy. So it is only in order to confuse us that\r\nLindbergh phrases it the way he does: “Finland and France are now our\r\nenemies; Russia our friend.”\r\n\r\nLindbergh says we are asked to defend the English, the Chinese, and now\r\nthe Russian way of life. It would not make any difference to us if the\r\nEnglish, the Chinese, and the Russians lived like lizards, crocodiles,\r\nand alligators, so long as they were aiding directly and willingly\r\nas the British, or directly though unwillingly, as the Russians, or\r\nindirectly as the Chinese, to protect us by opposing our enemies. We\r\nare only helping ourselves when we help them.\r\n\r\nLindbergh ends: “It is quite possible that we would find ourselves\r\nalone fighting the entire world before it was over.” No, it is not just\r\n“quite possible,” it is absolutely certain that we will find ourselves\r\nfighting the entire world if we do not intervene to save some part of\r\nthe world to fight on our side.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _In one of Lindbergh’s speeches he made the statement that “the only\r\nreason we are in danger of becoming involved in this war is because\r\nthere are powerful elements who desire us to take a part.” Is this\r\ntrue?_\r\n\r\nA. There are powerful elements who desire us to take part, namely all\r\nthe intelligent patriotic Americans who wish to defend their country\r\nwhile there is yet time, but that is not what Lindbergh meant. He is\r\nusing veiled language to express what his admirers, the Nazi Bundists,\r\nthe Fascists, and the Kluxers say openly when they charge that America\r\nis being “driven into war by the Jews, the international bankers, and\r\nthe armaments manufacturers.” It is a rule of the politics of this era,\r\nas Alexander Woollcott pointed out, that if you are not against Hitler,\r\nyou are for him, and sooner or later, willingly or unwillingly you\r\nbecome lined up for all the things he stands for, some of which you may\r\nnot have wished to embrace, as racial hatred, anti-Semitism, and the\r\nrule of the man with the gun.\r\n\r\nThe rich men in the America First Committee of Lindbergh and General\r\nWood, fancy they are protecting their investments by lining up against\r\nbeating Hitler, but if they permit him to win they will lose their\r\nwealth as surely as if they had helped run up the Red Flag.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _Can you give us a brief, objective resumé of Lindbergh’s argument\r\nagainst our entering the war?_\r\n\r\nA. Yes, he has set it forth very clearly in his “Letter to America”\r\npublished in _Collier’s_ magazine, where his principal ideas are\r\nsummed up, without any omission save the fact of his contempt for\r\nthe democracies and his admiration for the totalitarian system. It\r\nruns as follows: England and France have only themselves to blame for\r\ntheir defeat. (He takes for granted that England is defeated.) First,\r\nbecause they did not make a reasonable adjustment with Germany while\r\nthere was still time. Second, because they made the Versailles treaty\r\ntoo harsh to appease Germany and too lenient to hold her down. Third,\r\nbecause when Germany rose under Hitler they did not take advantage of\r\nthe last chance to stop him when they could, at his reoccupation of the\r\nRhineland in 1936. They were always too late, and now we in America are\r\ntoo late to stop him. We are unarmed and unable to fight. We have not\r\nas many thoroughly modern fighting planes in our Army and Navy combined\r\nas Germany produces in a single week. “If we enter the war now, it\r\nwould mean humiliation and defeat.” It is impossible for us to invade\r\nEurope. On the other hand, it is impossible for Germany to invade us.\r\nThey cannot invade us by air over Greenland because it is too cold, nor\r\nby way of South America because it is too far, and the South Americans\r\nwith our aid could prevent them from constructing landing fields. We\r\ncan stay out of the war, make ourselves impregnable, and afterward\r\nforce other nations to trade with us. That should be our policy.\r\n\r\nCounterattacking, he demands to know if we enter the war, first, how\r\nare we to defeat Germany? Second, how are we to “impose our ideology”\r\non our enemies? Third, what would it cost to win the war in American\r\nlives and how long would the war last? Fourth, what are our war aims?\r\nBut he always comes back to the question: “How could we win the war if\r\nwe entered it?”\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _How can we win?_\r\n\r\nA. I have an answer. There are too many surprises in warfare--witness\r\nthe German attack on Russia--for anyone, including the military\r\nexperts, to be sure of anything, and I am not a military expert. But\r\nI should like to preface my reply to Lindbergh’s whole argument by\r\nremarking that he assumes we have a choice in the matter, and that we\r\ncan avoid going to war if we want to. I do not believe we have any\r\nchoice except in the matter of timing. I should like to ask Lindbergh\r\nif he believes that by adopting his complete program, even withdrawal\r\nof all aid to Britain, thus insuring British defeat, we could thereby\r\ninduce Hitler to grant us better terms? Leaving aside all national\r\nhonor and pride, suppose we were to switch our policy completely and\r\nnot only abandoned Britain but like Vichy France made clandestine war\r\nupon her, or openly stabbed her in the back with a declaration of war\r\nà la Mussolini. Even in that case can anyone believe we would receive\r\nany better treatment than Hitler has in store for Vichy France or his\r\nally Italy? It is plain that all we should gain by such conduct would\r\nbe an increase in the unbounded contempt he already has for us.\r\n\r\nWe have not the choice of war or isolation. We have only the choice of\r\nwar or surrender.\r\n\r\nLet us take his points one by one. First, that England and France have\r\nonly themselves to blame for their defeat. But England is not defeated,\r\nand I am convinced that she can be defeated only by our defection on\r\nthe lines advocated by Lindbergh. She was to blame for her refusal\r\nto see her danger in time, and for the same reason France was to\r\nblame for her defeat. I agree to this, but to waste time now in such\r\nrecriminations is folly. Lindbergh says England and France were always\r\ntoo late and that now we in America are too late to save England. But\r\nit is our Lindberghs who are making us late. We are still not armed,\r\nagreed, but how can we win the time to arm? We can gain the time to\r\narm only by upholding Britain, keeping her fighting, and keeping the\r\nGermans out of control of the Atlantic. We can do that now by going\r\nto war with Germany and reinforcing Britain with all the force at our\r\ndisposal, which is adequate when ranged beside the present strength of\r\nBritain but inadequate to fight alone. Only our entry into the war now,\r\nbefore it is too late, can guarantee that Britain stands, and as long\r\nas Britain stands we can build our arms in perfect security until the\r\ncombined British and American might is strong enough to defeat Germany.\r\nLindbergh’s argument is that if we fight beside Britain now we lose; if\r\nwe fight alone later, we win.\r\n\r\nHe says we cannot be invaded: “I believe that we can build a military\r\nand commercial position on this continent that is impregnable to\r\nattack.” But in the preceding paragraph he says that for us to win a\r\nwar we must prepare for it “not for one year, or for two, but for ten\r\nyears or for twenty as Germany has done.” Does he imagine that Hitler\r\nwould give us twenty years to prepare for war, or ten, or two, or even\r\none after he had beaten Britain?\r\n\r\nBut they cannot get at us, says Lindbergh, citing the difficulty of\r\nair-borne invasion by Greenland or South America. Nobody imagines an\r\nexclusively air-borne invasion of America is possible. But if the\r\nBritish lose the war before we complete our two-ocean navy in 1947,\r\nsea power goes to the Germans. Lindbergh at no time discussed this\r\nall-important fact. Nor the fact that a defeated Britain, like defeated\r\nFrance, would be yoked into the Nazi war machine to be used against\r\nthe last enemy, ourselves. Does he really believe that if this happens\r\nwithin the next year or eighteen months, much less in shorter time, we\r\nshall be able alone to repel a German attack on this hemisphere, an\r\nattack supported by all the navies and warplanes left on earth except\r\nour own? We have already set forth the fact that after conquest of\r\nBritain Germany would possess shipping to transport millions, twenty\r\nto thirty thousand tanks, five or six times the number of warplanes we\r\nshall be able to produce in eighteen months, and the most formidable\r\narmy the world has ever seen, driven by the indomitable will of Hitler\r\nto conquer the globe or die.\r\n\r\nLeave aside, though, the possibility of direct invasion of the\r\ncontinental United States, and let us discuss with Lindbergh the\r\npossibility of German invasion of South America. He declares this, too,\r\nwould be impossible “in opposition to the armed forces of Brazil backed\r\nby our own Army, Navy and Air Corps.” But it is 4,258 miles from New\r\nYork to Pernambuco, Brazil, the place nearest to us where the Germans\r\nmight want to land, while it is only 3,847 miles from New York to\r\nLondon. Lindbergh advocates that we should attempt to defend Pernambuco\r\nthough it is 400 miles farther from New York than London, which he says\r\nwe should not defend because, among other things, of the difficulty\r\nof sending an expeditionary force so far. Does Lindbergh truly think\r\nPernambuco easier and more worth while for us to defend than London?\r\nDoes he really believe after Germany had conquered Europe and Britain\r\nthat Brazil or any other South American state would oppose Germany or\r\ninvite us to help it fight Germany?\r\n\r\nBut he demands to know, how can we defeat Germany if we do go to war?\r\nHe knows the answer to that better than anyone. We can defeat Germany\r\nonly by obtaining mastery of the air over Germany, then destroying\r\nthe German air force; once the Luftwaffe is destroyed, the impact of\r\nthat blow alone may cause the first crack in the military and civilian\r\nmorale of Germany and lift the morale of the conquered peoples to aid\r\nin expelling their conquerors. Let me reiterate that the conquered\r\npeoples will never revolt until they see the possibility of successful\r\nrevolt and that will come only with the first serious military setback\r\nof the Germans.\r\n\r\nWould we have to send an expeditionary land army? We probably shall\r\nhave to send our best units, and do it quickly, to prevent German\r\nseizure of the West African ports and islands affording springboards\r\nto America. Our troops would be useful now in North Africa and the\r\nNear East. Wherever contact with the enemy can be had, we should be\r\nrepresented as strongly as possible. It is also likely that we shall\r\nneed to send an A.E.F. to the continent, although not necessarily as\r\nlarge as in the last war. If we can get air superiority, it will mean\r\nthe war is practically won. I should expect Germany then to crack up.\r\n\r\nEven if she did not break down at once, the demoralization entailed\r\nby loss of control of the air would be so great that landings on the\r\ncontinent should be feasible at almost any place the Allies chose.\r\nLindbergh persistently asks where we could land an expeditionary force.\r\nThe answer is that if we get there in time we shall have an excellent\r\nbase of operations across the seas, Great Britain. From there the coast\r\nof Nazi Europe presents hundreds of opportunities for invasion, once\r\nthe Nazi air force is eliminated.\r\n\r\nLindbergh demands to know how long it would take to win if we think,\r\ncontrary to his judgment, that we can win. I should think it would take\r\na minimum of three years after we enter the war, maybe four, possibly\r\nfive or six. It can be accomplished only by expanding our present\r\naircraft production program, which has orders now for 80,000 planes, to\r\nwhatever dimensions prove necessary. This depends on how many planes\r\nthe Germans are able to produce from their own and conquered factories,\r\nincluding all the facilities of their conquests in the East. We shall\r\ncertainly have to think in terms of hundreds of thousands of planes.\r\nWe and the British will have to supply the pilots and crews and ground\r\ncrews for these planes, and it may be that our Air Corps will number\r\nupwards of a million before we are through. We have the men and the\r\nmachines to do it.\r\n\r\n“How much would it cost in American lives?” Lindbergh demands. Who\r\ncan tell? We know only that until the Germans went into Russia the\r\ncasualties in this war had been inconsiderable compared with the\r\nlast war. As long as combat was confined to the air and the sea, the\r\nnumbers of combatant lives lost were in the thousands compared with\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of soldier lives lost in comparable periods\r\nin the land fighting of the last war. The bombardment of civilians\r\nhas been ghastly, but the number of lives lost has been on the whole\r\nsurprisingly small--41,900 persons killed in Britain from January 1940\r\nto June 1941. It has even been asserted that in Britain, despite the\r\nhardships, war has so elevated the tone, the spirit of the population,\r\nthat death by disease has declined until the gain has made up for the\r\nloss of life by bombardment. The relatively small number of deaths\r\nis explained by Mr. Churchill as the result of air raid precautions.\r\nAfter the bloodiest month of the Battle of Britain, September 1940, Mr.\r\nChurchill made a remarkable analysis.\r\n\r\n“We are told,” he said, “by the Germans that 251 tons of explosives\r\nwere thrown upon London in a single night, that is to say, only a few\r\ntons less than the total dropped on the whole country throughout the\r\nlast war. Now we know exactly what our casualties have been. On that\r\nparticular Thursday night 180 persons were killed in London as a result\r\nof 251 tons of bombs. That is to say it took one ton of bombs to kill\r\nthree-quarters of a person. We know, of course, exactly the ratio of\r\nloss in the last war, because all the facts were ascertained after it\r\nwas over. In that war the small bombs of early patterns which were used\r\nkilled ten persons for every ton discharged in the built-up areas. That\r\nis, the mortality is now less than one-tenth of the mortality attaching\r\nto the German bombing attacks in the last war....\r\n\r\n“What is the explanation? There can only be one, namely the vastly\r\nimproved methods of shelter which have been adopted.... Whereas when we\r\nentered this war at the call of duty and honor we expected to sustain\r\nlosses which would amount to 3,000 killed in a single night and 12,000\r\nwounded, night after night, and made hospital arrangements on the basis\r\nof a quarter of a million casualties merely as a first provision;\r\nwhereas that is what we did at the beginning of the war, we have\r\nactually had since it began, up to last Saturday, as a result of air\r\nbombing, about 8,500 killed and 13,000 wounded.” This was after three\r\nmonths of the Blitz; today with the figure of 41,900 as the total dead,\r\nthe Prime Minister’s point is all the stronger as he concluded: “This\r\nshows that things do not always turn out as badly as one expects.” Mr.\r\nChurchill might have been speaking directly to Lindbergh.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But if air bombardment is as ineffective as these figures of\r\nChurchill indicate, how do you expect us to be able to beat Germany\r\nby winning air superiority and destroying the German air force? Isn’t\r\nthere a discrepancy in your argument?_\r\n\r\nA. No, because Britain has come off so lightly precisely because the\r\nGermans never have gotten air supremacy over Britain. If they ever\r\ndid, it would mean they would win the war, just as if we ever get\r\nair supremacy over Germany, it will mean that we will win the war.\r\nAir supremacy means you can come over in the daytime, and bomb with\r\nprecision. Antiaircraft guns are unable to prevent bombing. If there\r\nare no fighters to beat off the bombers, the bombers can do just\r\nabout as they like. They can dive-bomb and destroy any objective they\r\nchoose with about ninety per cent accuracy. If the Luftwaffe is ever\r\ndestroyed, British and American planes can annihilate the entire German\r\nwar industry and then what will it avail Hitler to be the conqueror of\r\nall Europe, or of Asia, too?\r\n\r\nThe R.A.F. has never been out to bomb civilians. The Germans have\r\nproved how useless civilian bombing is against a brave people. The\r\nR.A.F. has preferred the more difficult job of bombing military\r\nobjectives and already it has affected the Reich’s war-making capacity.\r\nBritish bombs on the invasion ports had much to do with Hitler’s\r\npostponement of his trip to England. With the addition to the R.A.F. of\r\nhundreds of thousands of American machines, and with our own hundreds\r\nof thousands in the American Air Force, there is no reason to doubt\r\nthat eventually the German military apparatus can be smashed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _What damage have the Germans done to the British war machine; or to\r\nthe buildings of London? Lindbergh insists Britain is already beaten to\r\nher knees._\r\n\r\nA. Exactly! Well, you have seen the loss of civilian life, amazingly\r\nsmall. Now Mr. Churchill has given us an interesting estimate on the\r\ndamage to London. He said: “Statisticians may amuse themselves by\r\ncalculating that after making allowance for the working of the law of\r\ndiminishing returns, through the same house being struck twice or three\r\ntimes over, it would take ten years at the present rate, for half of\r\nthe houses of London to be demolished. After that, of course, progress\r\nwould be much slower. Quite a lot of things are going to happen to\r\nHerr Hitler and the Nazi regime before ten years are up.... Neither by\r\nmaterial damage nor by slaughter will the people of the British Empire\r\nbe turned from their solemn and inexorable purpose.” Does Lindbergh\r\nreally think the British are beaten?\r\n\r\nBut you may object, surely we shall not have to suffer bombing of\r\nour civilian population. No, not if we enter the war in time to keep\r\nit on the other side of the ocean. The oddest thing of all about the\r\nLindbergh policy is that it would wait for the war to come to us,\r\nso that the bombs should fall on our homes, not on the homes of our\r\nenemies. He represents precisely the fatal “Maginot line policy” which\r\nhe so decries in the French. He advises us to sit behind our Maginot\r\nAtlantic and dream of our security until the Germans break through.\r\n\r\nFinally Lindbergh demands that we “define our war aims,” and tell “how\r\nwe are to impose our ideology on Germany, Russia, Italy and Japan.”\r\nWe do not wish to “impose our ideology” on anyone. All we wish at the\r\nmoment is to preserve our nation, keep from becoming slaves of the\r\nNazis, and prevent Hitler from imposing his ideology upon us. We want\r\nonly to make the world safe for the United States, which means also for\r\nthe friends and allies of the United States, and if victory is ours we\r\nshall attempt to include in the circle of security all the nations of\r\ngood will on earth. If this means “policing the earth,” let it mean\r\nthat. The first step to organize common security was taken when men\r\nagreed to have a police force and for it sacrificed their individual\r\nright to exercise individual justice, and agreed to pay taxes for the\r\nprotection. We are just now vigilantes trying to rid the community of\r\nbandits.\r\n\r\nIt is a troublesome matter and after it is settled we may have sense\r\nenough to organize at least for transient tranquillity and hope against\r\nhope that education may help us to permanent peace. I have not much\r\nhope of that myself, but if we, the United States of America, were to\r\nput our heart into the effort, I would have hope. Unless we do there is\r\nno hope at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. _But how many lives could it cost America?_\r\n\r\nA. Nobody can say how many lives it will cost us to preserve\r\nour liberty and independence. Maybe surprisingly few, maybe\r\nheart-breakingly many. But is this a matter for bargaining? Does\r\nLindbergh ask us to say: “We, the United States of America will give\r\nso and so many American lives in order to preserve our national\r\nindependence, our institutions, our children’s lives and our liberty,\r\nbut we will give so many and no more? If it costs more, we will\r\nsurrender! If it takes two years to win, we will make the trade; if it\r\ncosts ten, we give in!” If that is our attitude, we are beaten before\r\nwe begin. It is not America’s attitude. It was Vallandigham’s, but not\r\nAmerica’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n  Abetz, Otto, 243, 251\r\n\r\n  America First Committee, 311, 345, 346, 361-362, 367\r\n\r\n  American Expeditionary Force, 278, 293, 314, 333, 371\r\n\r\n  Anabaptists, 56\r\n\r\n  Angell, Sir Norman, 193-194\r\n\r\n  Anti-Semitism, in Germany, 13-14, 64-65,82, 360\r\n    in Lindbergh’s philosophy, 361-362\r\n\r\n  Assassinations, political, 60-79, 239\r\n\r\n  Atlantic Charter, 184, 185-187, 200-202,227, 333-334\r\n\r\n  Atrocity stories, 79-83\r\n\r\n  Australian armed forces, 155\r\n\r\n  Austria, Dollfuss Putsch, 8-10\r\n    independence guaranteed, 7-8\r\n    seizure of, 27\r\n\r\n\r\n  Baltic states, fate of, 193, 227-228\r\n\r\n  Baruch, Bernard, 170\r\n\r\n  Bayes, William D., 43\r\n\r\n  _Berliner Illustrierte_, 42\r\n\r\n  Bernstein, Henri, 148-149\r\n\r\n  Bezbozhnik Society, 99\r\n\r\n  Birdsall, Paul, 286\r\n\r\n  Black Guards, 15, 39, 56, 62-63, 83\r\n\r\n  Blood Purge (June 30, 1934), 12, 32, 34, 39-40, 64, 78\r\n\r\n  Blum, Leon, 267, 279\r\n\r\n  Brest-Litovsk treaty, 58, 107\r\n\r\n  British Expeditionary Force, 21-22\r\n\r\n  British Intelligence Service, 66-68\r\n\r\n  British Navy, and American safety, 276\r\n    Churchill’s tribute to, 168-169\r\n    as a fighting force, 152-156\r\n\r\n  Bucharest treaty, 58\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cagoulard movement, 243, 251-259\r\n\r\n  Canada, and the war effort, 152, 154, 155, 204\r\n\r\n  China, 320, 366\r\n    war economy, 109\r\n\r\n  Churchill, Randolph, 26, 166, 172, 176, 177-178\r\n\r\n  Churchill, Winston, 139-183\r\n    address to French people, 284\r\n    Atlantic meeting with Roosevelt, 184-185\r\n    aversions, 176-177\r\n    as a bricklayer, 178-179\r\n    characteristics, 144, 148-151\r\n    on effect of air bombardment, 372-375\r\n    gift of prophecy, 148\r\n    military judgment, 156-161, 182-183\r\n    opinion of Roosevelt and the New Deal, 145-148\r\n    opinion of United States, 144-145\r\n    as a painter, 179\r\n    place in history, 139\r\n    popularity in England, 139-142\r\n    principal interests, 166-183\r\n    realist and idealist, 142-144\r\n    secret of success, 163-166\r\n    as a speaker, 171-174\r\n    speeches on defense of Britain, 151-153, 160, 164-166\r\n    as a writer, 163-164, 169, 170, 179\r\n\r\n  Ciano, Count, 7\r\n\r\n  Clapper, Raymond, 350\r\n\r\n  Cole, G.
