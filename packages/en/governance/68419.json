Necessarily much of\r\nthe material in it may be found in earlier works; but recent progress\r\nin the field, involving a reaction against certain theories of Niebuhr\r\nand Mommsen affecting the comitia, justifies a systematic presentation\r\nof existing knowledge of the subject. This task has required patient\r\nlabor extending through many years. The known sources and practically\r\nall the modern authorities have been utilized. A determination to keep\r\nfree from conventional ideas, so as to look at the sources freshly and\r\nwith open mind, has brought views of the assemblies not found in other\r\nbooks. The reader is earnestly requested not to reject an interpretation\r\nbecause it seems new but to examine carefully the grounds on which it is\r\ngiven. In general the aim has been to follow a conservative historical\r\nmethod as opposed to the radical juristic, to build up generalizations on\r\nfacts rather than to estimate sources by the criterion of a preconceived\r\ntheory. The primary object of the volume, however, is not to defend a\r\npoint of view but to serve as a book of study and reference for those who\r\nare interested in the history, law, and constitution of ancient Rome and\r\nin comparative institutional research.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the volume, I have been generously aided by my\r\ncolleagues in Columbia University. To Professor William M. Sloane,\r\nHead of the Department of History, I owe a great debt of gratitude for\r\nkindly sympathy and encouragement in the work. It is an especial good\r\nfortune that the proofs have been read by Professor James C. Egbert.\r\nMany improvements are due to his scholarship and editorial experience.\r\nProfessor George N. Olcott has advised me on various numismatic matters,\r\nand I am indebted to Dr. John L. Gerig for information on two or three\r\netymologies. The proofs have also been read and corrections made by Dr.\r\nRichard R. Blews of Cornell University. It is a pleasure to remember\r\ngratefully these able friends who have helped me with their special\r\nknowledge, and to add the name of Mr. Frederic W. Erb of the Columbia\r\nUniversity Library, whose courtesy has facilitated the borrowing of books\r\nfor the study from other institutions.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding every effort to make the work accurate, mistakes and\r\ninconsistencies will doubtless be found in it, and I shall thankfully\r\nwelcome suggestions from any reader for its further correction and\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n                                                   GEORGE WILLIS BOTSFORD.\r\n\r\nMOUNT VERNON, NEW YORK, June 7, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     PAGES\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS OF THE COMITIAL CONSTITUTION                            1-118\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    THE POPULUS AND ITS EARLIEST POLITICAL DIVISIONS                  1-15\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    THE SOCIAL COMPOSITION OF THE PRIMITIVE POPULUS                  16-47\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    THE THIRTY-FIVE TRIBES                                           48-65\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    THE CENTURIES AND THE CLASSES                                    66-99\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    THE AUSPICES                                                   100-118\r\n\r\n                                 PART II\r\n\r\n    THE ASSEMBLIES: ORGANIZATION, PROCEDURE, AND FUNCTIONS,\r\n      RESOLUTIONS, STATUTES, AND CASES                             119-477\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n    COMITIA AND CONCILIUM                                          119-138\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    THE CONTIO                                                     139-151\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n    THE CALATA COMITIA                                             152-167\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n    THE COMITIA CURIATA                                            168-200\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMITIA CENTURIATA                     201-228\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n    THE FUNCTIONS OF THE COMITIA CENTURIATA                        229-261\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n    THE COMITIA TRIBUTA AND THE RISE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY,\r\n      TO 449                                                       262-282\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n    THE COMITIA TRIBUTA AND THE RISE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY,\r\n      FROM 449 TO 287                                              283-316\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n    THE JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE COMITIA TRIBUTA, FROM 287\r\n      TO THE END OF THE REPUBLIC                                   317-329\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n    COMITIAL LEGISLATION, FROM HORTENSIUS TO THE GRACCHI           330-362\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n    COMITIAL LEGISLATION, FROM THE GRACCHI TO SULLA                363-411\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n    COMITIAL LEGISLATION, FROM SULLA TO THE END OF THE REPUBLIC    412-461\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n    THE COMPOSITION AND PRESERVATION OF STATUTES, COMITIAL\r\n      PROCEDURE, AND COMITIAL DAYS                                 462-472\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n    A SUMMARY OF COMITIAL HISTORY                                  473-477\r\n\r\n    BIBLIOGRAPHY                                                   479-498\r\n\r\n    INDEX                                                          499-521\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN ASSEMBLIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nELEMENTS OF THE COMITIAL CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE POPULUS AND ITS EARLIEST POLITICAL DIVISIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _The Populus_\r\n\r\nThe derivation of populus, “people,” “folk,” is unknown. Attempts have\r\nbeen made to connect it with populari, “to devastate,” so as to give\r\nit primarily a military signification—perhaps simply “the army.”[1]\r\nIn the opinion of others it is akin to plēnus, plēbes, πλῆθος, πολύς,\r\nπίμπλημι,[2] in which case it would signify “multitude,” “mass,” with\r\nthe idea of collective strength, which might readily pass into “army” as\r\na secondary meaning.[3] Fundamentally personal, it included all those\r\nindividuals, not only the grown men but their families as well, who\r\ncollectively made up the state, whether Roman or foreign, monarchical or\r\nrepublican.[4] Only in a transferred sense did it apply to territory.[5]\r\nThe ancient definition, “an association based on the common acceptance\r\nof the same body of laws and on the general participation in public\r\nbenefits,”[6] is doubtless too abstract for the beginnings of Rome.\r\nCitizenship—membership in the populus—with all that it involved is\r\nelaborately defined by the Roman jurists;[7] but for the earlier period\r\nit will serve the purpose of the present study to mention that the three\r\ncharacteristic public functions of the citizen were military service,\r\nparticipation in worship, and attendance at the assembly.[8] In a\r\nnarrower sense populus signifies “the people,” “masses,” in contrast with\r\nthe magistrates or with the senate, as in the well known phrase, senatus\r\npopulusque Romanus.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Three Primitive Tribes_\r\n\r\nThe Romans believed that the three tribes which composed the primitive\r\npopulus were created by one act in close relation with the founding\r\nof the city.[9] For some unknown reason they were led to connect the\r\nmyth of Titus Tatius, the eponymous hero of the Tities,[10] with the\r\nQuirinal,[11] and with the Sabines,[12] who were generally supposed to\r\nhave occupied that hill.[13] Consequently some of their historians felt\r\ncompelled to defer their account of the institution of the tribes till\r\nthey had told of the union of the Sabines with the Romans, which at the\r\nsame time gave them an opportunity to derive the names of the curiae from\r\nthose of the Sabine women. Varro,[14] however, who protests against this\r\nderivation, refers the organization of the people in the three tribes to\r\nan earlier date, connecting it immediately with the founding of Rome.\r\nThough he affirmed that one tribe was named after Romulus, another after\r\nTitus Tatius, and the third, less positively, after an Etruscan Lucumo,\r\nCaeles Vibenna, who came to the aid of Romulus against Titus Tatius,[15]\r\nneither he nor any other ancient writer identified the Tities with the\r\nSabines, whose quarter in the city was really unknown,[16] or the Luceres\r\nwith an Etruscan settlement under Caeles whether in the Vicus Tuscus[17]\r\nor on the Caelian hill.[18] Since the Romans knew the tribe in no other\r\nrelation than as a part of the state, they could not have thought of\r\ntheir city as consisting originally of a single tribe, to which a second\r\nand afterward a third were added, or that any one of these three tribes\r\nhad ever been an independent community. These views are modern;[19] there\r\nis no trace of them in the ancient writers.[20] Even if it could be\r\nproved that they took this point of view, the question at issue would not\r\nthereby be settled; for no genuine tradition regarding the origin of the\r\nprimitive tribes came down to the earliest annalists; the only possible\r\nknowledge they possessed on this point was deduced from the names of the\r\ntribes and from surviving institutions presumably connected with them\r\nin the period of their existence.[21] Under these circumstances modern\r\nspeculations as to their independent character and diverse nationality\r\nseem absurd. The proper method of solving the problem is to test and to\r\nsupplement the scant sources by a comparative study of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe low political vitality of the three primitive Roman tribes, as of the\r\ncorresponding Greek phylae,[22] when we first meet with them in history,\r\npoints to the artificiality of these groups—a condition indicated\r\nfurther both by their number and by their occurrence in other Italian\r\nstates.[23] Far from being confined to Rome, the tripartite division of\r\nthe community belonged to many Greek and to most Italian peoples,[24]\r\nand has entered largely into the organization of communities and nations\r\nthe world over.[25] A derivation of tribus, Umbrian trifu, accepted by\r\nmany scholars, connects it with the number three.[26] The wide use of\r\nthis conventional number, and more particularly the regular recurrence\r\nof the same three Dorian tribes in many Dorian cities—as of the same\r\nfour Ionic tribes in many Ionic cities[27]—and of the same three Latin\r\n(or Etruscan?) tribes in several old Latin cities, could not result from\r\nchance combinations in all these places, but point unmistakably to the\r\nsystematic imitation of a common pattern. That pattern must be ultimately\r\nsought in the pre-urban populus, ἔθνος, folk. If we assume that before\r\nthe rise of city-states the Ionian folk was organized in four tribes\r\n(phylae) and the Dorian and Latin folks in three tribes, we shall have a\r\ncondition such as will satisfactorily explain the tribal organization of\r\nthe city-states which grew up within the areas occupied by these three\r\nfolks respectively. The thirty votes of the Latins may be best explained\r\nby assuming a division of their populus into three tribes, subdivided\r\neach into ten groups corresponding to the Roman curiae. Whereas in\r\nUmbria the decay of the pre-urban populus allowed its tribes to become\r\nindependent,[28] in Latium a development in that direction was prevented\r\nby the rise of city-states, which completely overshadowed the preëxisting\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe Italian city-state grew not from a tribe or a combination of\r\ntribes, but from the pagus,[29] “canton,” a district of the pre-urban\r\npopulus with definite consecrated boundaries,[30] usually centering\r\nin an oppidum—a place of defence and refuge.[31] In the beginning the\r\nlatter enjoyed no superior right over the territory in which it was\r\nsituated.[32] A pagus became a populus at the point of time when it\r\nasserted its political independence of the folk. The new state organized\r\nitself in tribes and curiae after the pattern of the folk. In the main\r\nthis arrangement was artificial, yet it must have taken some account\r\nof existing ties of blood.[33] At the same time the oppidum became an\r\nurbs[34]—a city, the seat of government of the new populus. Thus arose\r\nthe city-state. In the case of Rome several oppida with parts of their\r\nrespective pagi[35] were merged in one urbs—that known as the city of the\r\nfour regions.[36] Urbs and ager excluded each other, just as the oppidani\r\ncontrasted with the pagani;[37] but both were included in the populus.\r\n\r\nMost ancient writers represent the three tribes as primarily local,[38]\r\nand the members as landowners from the founding of the city.[39] Although\r\ntheir view may be a mere inference from the character of the so-called\r\nServian tribes, the continuity of name from the earlier to the later\r\ninstitution points to some degree of similarity between them. It can be\r\neasily understood, too, how in time the personal feature might have so\r\novercome the local as to make the old tribes appear to be based on birth\r\nin contrast with the territorial aspect of the new.[40]\r\n\r\nIt was probably on the institution of the later tribes that the earlier\r\nwere dissolved. They left their names to the three double centuries of\r\npatrician knights.[41] Their number appears also as a factor in the\r\nnumber of curiae, of senators, and of members of the great sacerdotal\r\ncolleges. Other survivals may be found in the name “tribunus,” in the\r\ntribuni militum, the tribuni celerum,[42] the ludus Troiae,[43] and less\r\ncertainly in the Sodales Titii.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Curiae_\r\n\r\nThe curia as well as the tribe was a common Italian institution. We know\r\nthat it belonged to the Etruscans,[45] the Latins,[46] and several other\r\npeoples of Italy.[47] There were ten curiae to the tribe, making thirty\r\nin all.[48] The association was composed, not of gentes as many have\r\nimagined, but of families.[49] For the performance of its social and\r\nreligious functions it had a house of assembly, also called curia,[50] in\r\nwhich the members—curiales—gathered for religious festivals. The place\r\nof meeting was a part of an edifice belonging to the collective curiae.\r\nIn historical time there were two such buildings—the Curiae Veteres[51]\r\non the northeast slope of the Palatine near the Arch of Constantine,\r\ncontaining seven curial meeting-places, and the Novae Curiae[52] near the\r\nCompitum Fabricium, containing the others. Their deities were Juno[53]\r\nand Tellus;[54] and their chief festivals were the Fornacalia and the\r\nFordicidia.[55] As the worship was public, the expense was paid by the\r\nstate.[56] At the head of the curia stood the curio—who in historical\r\ntime was merely a priest[57]—assisted in his religious functions by\r\nhis wife and children,[58] by a lictor[59] and a flamen.[60] The fact\r\nthat the curio had these officials proves that he was originally a\r\nmagistrate.[61] One of the curiones the people elected curio maximus\r\nto exercise general supervision over the worship and festivals of the\r\nassociation.[62]\r\n\r\nAnother function of the curiae was political. The grown male members,\r\nmeeting in the comitium, constituted the earliest assembly organized in\r\nvoting divisions—the comitia curiata—in which each curia cast a single\r\nvote.[63] Religious and political functions the curia continued to\r\nexercise far down into historical time; and for that reason they have\r\nnever been doubted by the moderns. For the primitive period Dionysius[64]\r\nascribes to them military functions as well. His idea is that the three\r\noriginal tribes furnished military divisions each under a tribune, and\r\nthe curiae as subdivisions of the tribe furnished companies, commanded\r\neach by a curio chosen for his valor.[65] Doubtless the writer fairly\r\ndescribes the military system which Rome employed before the introduction\r\nof the phalanx,[66] and which corresponds closely with the system\r\nprevalent among the early Greeks,[67] Germans,[68] and other European\r\npeoples.[69] The military organization was everywhere a parallel of\r\nthe civil. The Roman army, however, was by no means identical with the\r\ncuriate assembly, for many belonged to the tribes and the curiae who for\r\nvarious reasons were exempt from military service.[70]\r\n\r\nIt is probable, too, that the curiae, as well as the tribes,[71] were\r\nterritorial divisions. Not only have we the authority of Dionysius[72]\r\nthat each curia occupied a district of the state, but also two of the\r\nseven known curial names—Foriensis and Veliensis[73]—are local. Though\r\nthe two mentioned refer to places within the city, the country people\r\nwere also included in the associations.[74]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince Niebuhr the opinion has generally prevailed that the curia was\r\ncomposed of gentes. A passage which at first glance seems to have a\r\nbearing on the question is Dion. Hal. ii. 7. 4: “Romulus divided the\r\ncuriae into decades, each commanded by a leader, who in the language of\r\nthe country is called decurion.”[75] The word decurion proves, however,\r\nthat in speaking of decades Dionysius is thinking of the military\r\ndivisions called decuriae, each commanded by a decurion. In historical\r\ntimes the troop of cavalry—turma—was divided into three decuriae of\r\nten each, as the word itself indicates. There were accordingly three\r\ndecurions to the turma, and ten turmae ordinarily went with the\r\nlegion.[76] From Varro[77] we learn that the three primitive tribes\r\nfurnished turmae and decuriae of cavalry, the decuriae commanded by\r\ndecurions. Dionysius accordingly refers to military companies—either\r\nto the well known decuriae of cavalry or to corresponding companies of\r\nfootmen which probably existed before the adoption of the phalanx.[78]\r\nHad he meant gentes, he would have used the corresponding Greek word\r\nγένη. Niebuhr[79] inferred from this passage that each curia was divided\r\ninto ten gentes, making three hundred gentes for the entire state; but a\r\ncareful interpretation shows that no reference to the gentes is intended.\r\nWe cannot infer therefore from this citation that the curia was divided\r\ninto gentes.\r\n\r\nThe other passage relative to the question is Gellius xv. 27. 4,[80] in\r\nwhich Laelius Felix states that the voting in the comitia curiata was by\r\ngenera hominum in contrast with the census et aetas of the centuriate\r\nassembly and with the regiones et loca of the comitia tributa. Niebuhr\r\nidentifies genera with gentes.[81] It is clear, however, that in this\r\npassage Laelius is not concretely defining the voting units of the\r\nvarious assemblies, but is stating in a general way the principles\r\nunderlying their organization into voting units. In the comitia\r\ncenturiata the principle is wealth and age; census et aetas is not to\r\nbe identified with centuria or with any other group of individuals in\r\nthis assembly. In like manner regiones et loca expresses the principle\r\nof organization of the tribal assembly; or if used concretely, it must\r\ndesignate the tribes themselves, and not subdivisions of the tribes, for\r\nnone existed. Correspondingly genera hominum signifies that the principle\r\nof organization of the curiate assembly is hereditary connection; but\r\nso far as the expression is applied concretely, it must denote the\r\ncuriae themselves not subdivisions of these associations. The curia,\r\na religious, social, and political group based on birth, might well\r\nbe called genus hominum in contrast with the local tribe and with the\r\ncentury, composed artificially of men of similar wealth and age. It is\r\nwell known, too, that voting within the curiae was not by gentes but by\r\nheads.[82] As no other passage from the sources, besides these two, has\r\neven the appearance of lending support to the proposition advanced by\r\nNiebuhr, and favored by others, that the curia was a group of gentes, we\r\nmay conclude that this proposition is groundless. The result is that the\r\ngens had no connection with the comitial organization.\r\n\r\n    I.

At the same time it seeks to solve a problem\r\nwhich is doubtless the most fundamental in the early political and\r\nconstitutional history of Rome. The result we reach will determine our\r\nconception of the whole course of constitutional development, and of the\r\naccompanying political struggles, to the complete equalization of the\r\nsocial ranks. For if we believe, as do many of the moderns,[84] that\r\nthe primitive Roman state was made up exclusively of patricians, we are\r\nforced to the conclusion that the constitutional development to the\r\npassing of the Hortensian laws centred in the gradual admission of the\r\nplebeians and the clients to citizenship—perhaps even in the amalgamation\r\nof two distinct peoples. If on the other hand we take the ground that\r\nfrom the beginning the plebeians and the clients were citizens and voted\r\nin the comitia curiata, we must think of these inferior classes as\r\nstruggling through the early history of their country for the acquisition\r\nnot of citizenship but of various rights and privileges, social,\r\neconomic, religious, and political, formerly monopolized by a patrician\r\naristocracy. In attempting to solve the problem here proposed it will\r\nbe advantageous to consider (1) the ancient view, (2) the conventional\r\nmodern view, (3) the comparative-sociological view.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _The Ancient View_\r\n\r\nThe three social classes of freemen—plebeians, patricians, and\r\nclients—were formed within the citizen body by official recognition of\r\nexisting distinctions not of nationality but of worth. The first step\r\nin the process was the differentiation of the patricians from the\r\nplebeians. According to Cicero, Romulus constituted a number of chief men\r\ninto a royal council, the senate, whose members he so highly esteemed as\r\nto have them called patres, and their children patricians.[85] Cicero\r\nthinks of the multitude as existing at first without a politically\r\nrecognized nobility, yet showing natural distinctions of worth. By\r\ncalling into the senate the ablest and best men, the state ennobled them\r\nand their families.[86] Livy’s[87] view is similar: Romulus selected\r\nfrom the multitude a hundred senators, whom he named patres, and whose\r\ndescendants were called patricians. They were chosen because of their\r\nwisdom;[88] on that ground the state granted them nobility,[89] which\r\naccordingly in Rome, as in every early community, was founded on personal\r\nmerit.[90] In the more detailed theory of Dionysius,[91] Romulus\r\n“distinguished those who were eminent for their birth and celebrated\r\nfor their virtue, and whom he knew to be rich in the account of those\r\ntimes and who had children, from the obscure and mean and poor. The\r\nlower class he called plebeians, Greek δημοτικοί, and the higher patres,\r\neither because they were older than the others, or had children, or\r\nwere of higher birth, or for all these reasons.... The most trustworthy\r\nhistorians of the Roman constitution assert that owing to these facts\r\nthey were called patres and their descendants patricians.” According to\r\nPlutarch,[92] “Romulus, after forming the army, employed the rest of the\r\npeople as the citizen body (δῆμος); the multitude he called populus, and\r\nappointed a hundred nobles to be councillors, whom he called patricians,\r\nand their assembly the senate.”[93]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, therefore, as to the opinion of the ancient\r\nwriters. They believed that from the beginning social distinctions\r\nexisted naturally within the populus Romanus, and that these distinctions\r\nwere made the basis of an official division of the people into nobles and\r\ncommons, patricii and plebs, by the government. This view is not only\r\nreasonable in itself, but is supported, as we shall see, by analogies\r\ndrawn from many other states.\r\n\r\nAll the sources make the patriciate depend upon connection with the\r\nsenate, Dionysius alone showing some inconsistency on this point.[94]\r\nWhy the senators were called patres the ancients give various reasons.\r\nCicero[95] thinks patres a term of endearment; Sallust[96] believes that\r\nthe name was applied either because of age or because of the similarity\r\nof their duty; Livy[97] sets it down as a title of honor; Festus[98]\r\nthinks chiefly of their age and wisdom; Paulus,[99] his epitomator,\r\nsuggests that they were so called because they divided their lands\r\namong the poorer class as fathers among children; Dionysius[100] gives\r\nthree possible reasons, (1) greater age, (2) possession of children,\r\n(3) family reputation. The sources generally agree in representing the\r\npatres as men who in age, honor, authority and duty stood toward the\r\nrest of the citizens as a father toward his children, and in identifying\r\nthese social-political patres with the senators.[101] An examination\r\nof the word itself will tend to confirm the ancient view. It seems to\r\nhave originally signified “protector,” “keeper,” “nourisher,”[102] hence\r\n“owner,” “master.” Pater familias is nourisher, protector, and master\r\nof a household.[103] In late Roman law the term continued to refer not\r\nnecessarily to actual parentage but rather to the legal position of the\r\nhead of a household;[104] in fact it is only in a distantly derived sense\r\nthat pater comes to signify the male parent. Ideas early attaching to the\r\nword, accordingly, are those of power or authority and age. The senate,\r\nas this word indicates, was originally made up of elderly men, senatores,\r\nmaiores natu.[105] It would be natural to call them patres because of\r\ntheir authority over the community or of their age. As a designation of\r\nrank, pater, excepting in jest, is always plural—an indication that the\r\nauthority and dignity did not attach to the individual noble but to the\r\nsenators collectively; they were collectively patres of the community,\r\nnot individually patres of children, clients or gentes.[106] But when in\r\ntime a limited number of families monopolized the senate, the term could\r\neasily be extended to the entire privileged circle, meaning those with\r\nhereditary right to authority over the rest of the community.[107] Though\r\nin the sources the patres are generally senators the word is sometimes\r\nsynonymous with patricii.[108]\r\n\r\nRegarding patricius the Romans reasoned with somewhat less care. They\r\nwere right in deriving it from pater, but they made it signify “descended\r\nfrom,” whereas in fact it means “belonging to,”[109] and designates\r\naccordingly the families of the political patres. Probably it was\r\nformed after patres began to be applied to the entire governing class—a\r\ndevelopment which would tend to throw the latter word back to its earlier\r\nand narrower sense.\r\n\r\nHad the investigation of these words on the part of the ancients rested\r\nat this point, all would have been well; but an unfortunate guess as to\r\nthe derivation of patricii by some unknown antiquarian has brought into\r\nthe study of the social ranks unutterable confusion lasting down to the\r\npresent day. This conjecture derives patricius from patrem ciere, making\r\nit signify “one who can cite a father.” The attempted etymology, clearly\r\na failure, would perhaps have been harmless, had it not connected itself\r\nwith the ambiguous word ingenuus. Cincius[110] says, “Those used to be\r\ncalled patricians who are now called ingenui.” Livy has the two ideas in\r\nmind when he represents a plebeian orator as inquiring, “Have ye never\r\nheard it said that those first created patricians were not beings sent\r\ndown from heaven, but such as could cite their fathers, that is, nothing\r\nmore than ingenui? I can now cite my father—a consul—and my son will be\r\nable to cite a grandfather.”[111] There should be no doubt as to the\r\nmeaning of these passages; the antiquarian who conjectured that patricius\r\nwas derived from patrem ciere, and therefore defined patricii as those\r\nwho could cite their fathers, meant merely those who had distinguished\r\nfathers, and hence were of respectable birth. Ordinarily in extant Latin\r\nliterature ingenui are simply the freeborn; and in making Appius Claudius\r\nCrassus in 368 include in the term the whole body of citizens Livy[112]\r\ndates this meaning back to the period before the Licinian-Sextian laws.\r\nElsewhere are indications that in early times ingenui connoted rather\r\nrespectable birth, and so applied especially to the patricians.[113] The\r\nquotations from Cincius and the attempted derivation of patricius from\r\npatrem ciere, accordingly, are sufficiently explained without resorting\r\nto the strange hypothesis, held by some, that in primitive Rome the\r\npatricians were the only men of free birth.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the ancient view as to the origin and nature of the\r\npatriciate, it will be enough to say that the king chose from the\r\npeople men who were eminent for the experience of age, for ability and\r\nreputation, to sit in his council, the senate; the men so distinguished\r\nwere called patres, whereas the adjective patricius applied as well\r\nto their families—the patricii being those who could cite illustrious\r\nfathers.[114] From this point of view the Roman nobility did not differ\r\nfrom that of most other countries.\r\n\r\nThe plebs,[115] then, were the mass of common freemen, from whom the\r\nnobility was differentiated in the way described above. From the\r\nancient point of view they existed from the beginning, prior even to the\r\npatriciate itself.\r\n\r\nIt is equally true that in the opinion of the ancients the plebs were\r\nprior to the clients. Cicero[116] records that Romulus distributed the\r\nplebs in clientage among the chief men; Dionysius[117] adds that he gave\r\nthe plebeians liberty to choose their patrons from among the patricians.\r\nThus far their view is in complete accord with modern sociology,\r\nwhich teaches that such class distinctions first arise through the\r\ndifferentiation of freemen. Although aware of the fact that clientage\r\nexisted in other states which were presumably older than Rome,[118] her\r\nhistorians doubtless felt that the institution could have been legalized\r\nin their own country by recognition only on the part of the government.\r\nThey did not, however, work out a consistent theory of the relation\r\nbetween this class and the plebeians. Certain passages[119] hint, though\r\nthey do not expressly assert, that at one epoch all the plebeians were\r\nin clientage, whereas in their accounts of political struggles the\r\nancient writers uniformly array clients against plebeians almost from\r\nthe beginning of the state.[120] The latter view is historically better\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nThere must have been various origins of clientage, with corresponding\r\ngradations of privilege. The libertini were citizens with straitly\r\nlimited rights; other clients, certainly the greater part of the class,\r\nnot only followed their patron to war[121] and to the forum,[122] but\r\nalso testified and brought accusations in the courts[123] and voted\r\nin the assemblies;[124] and when the plebeians gained the right to\r\nhold offices the clients were admitted along with them to the same\r\nprivilege.[125] In his relation with the state, therefore, the ordinary\r\nclient did not differ essentially from the plebeian.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding examination of the social ranks it at once becomes\r\nevident that the ancients made the populus comprise both patricians and\r\nplebeians; in further proof of their view may be cited the following\r\njuristic definition: “Plebs differs from populus in that by the word\r\npopulus all the citizens are meant, including even the patricians,\r\nwhereas plebs signifies the rest of the citizens, excepting the\r\npatricians.”[126] Since the sources generally consider the patricians\r\nthe descendants of the hundred original senators,[127] they cannot\r\nhelp regarding the populus as composed chiefly of plebeians. In common\r\nspeech the term, like our word people, often applies to the lower class\r\nas distinguished from the higher, in which sense it is interchangeable\r\nwith plebs; often, too, it signifies the people in contrast with the\r\nsenate.[128] It is clear, then, as Mommsen has pointed out,[129] that\r\nif populus signifies first the whole body of citizens and secondly the\r\ncommons as distinguished from the nobles, it could not possibly have as\r\na third equivalent the patricians as distinguished from the plebeians.\r\nIn certain formulae found in addresses, wills, prayers, and oracles,\r\npopulus is so joined with plebs (populus plebesque or the like) as to\r\nsuggest the possible meaning patricians.[130] The combination of the\r\ntwo words with senatus,[131] however, reveals at once the overlapping\r\nof the terms so joined. In these passages reference is to the modes by\r\nwhich an individual may approach the state; he may address the consuls,\r\npraetors, or plebeian tribunes, and in the same way the senate, populus,\r\nor plebs.[132] Hence in these formulae, merely representing groups of\r\ninstitutions through which the state is accustomed to act, the word\r\npopulus does not apply solely to the patricians, and the same may be said\r\nof its use in all other connections. We may conclude, therefore, that the\r\nLatin language gives no hint of an exclusively patrician populus.\r\n\r\nRegarding the populus as made up of patricians, plebeians, and clients,\r\nour sources necessarily ascribe the same social composition to its\r\ndivisions, the three old tribes and the thirty curiae.[133] With perfect\r\nconsistency they mention repeated enlargements of the populus and of the\r\ntribes and curiae, through the admission of masses of aliens, most of\r\nwhom must have remained plebeian. In fact the sources uniformly represent\r\nall the kings as freely admitting conquered aliens without exception to\r\nthe citizenship and to the tribes and the curiae, even compelling some\r\nforcibly to enter this condition.[134]\r\n\r\nMight the plebeians and clients belong in a restricted sense to the\r\npopulus and curiae, and yet remain so far inferior to the patricians as\r\nto be excluded from the political meetings of the curiae—the comitia\r\ncuriata? There can be no uncertainty as to the answer to this question,\r\nfor the ancient writers agree that the comitia curiata included plebeians\r\nand clients as well as patricians.[135] Not only did the lower classes\r\nattend this assembly, but they also voted in it, and constituted the\r\nmajority.[136]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE CONVENTIONAL MODERN VIEW\r\n\r\nThe passages cited above suffice to prove that the ancient writers\r\nthought of the populus, and consequently of the comitia curiata, as\r\ncomposed from the earliest times of patricians, clients, and plebeians.\r\nAnother question, far more difficult, is whether the ancients were right\r\nin their view.\r\n\r\nAs none of the authorities on whom we directly depend for our knowledge\r\nof Roman affairs lived earlier than the last century of the republic,\r\nthey could have had no first-hand acquaintance with primitive Roman\r\nconditions, but must have drawn their information concerning the\r\nremote past from earlier writers—the annalists—now lost. Niebuhr, who\r\nin the opening years of the last century introduced the modern method\r\nof investigating Roman history, was convinced that writers of the\r\nlate republic and of the empire, lacking historical perspective and\r\ninterpreting their sources in the false light of existing or recent\r\nconditions, came to wrong conclusions in regard to the primitive Roman\r\nstate. He believed he could point to instances of such misunderstanding,\r\nand he thought it within the power of a well-equipped modern historian to\r\neliminate much of the error so as to come near to the standpoint of the\r\nearlier and more trustworthy annalists.[137]\r\n\r\nThe position of Niebuhr has in the main proved untenable. Notwithstanding\r\nall the source-sifting of modern times, pursued most zealously by the\r\nGermans, we are obliged to admit that it is rarely possible with any\r\nfair degree of certainty to discover the view of an annalist on a given\r\nsubject excepting in the few cases in which the citation is by name.\r\nWe must also admit that though Cicero and the Augustan writers might\r\nmisinterpret Fabius Pictor in minor details, it is inconceivable that\r\nthey should fail to understand his presentation of so fundamental a\r\nsubject as the character of the original populus or the composition of\r\nthe earliest assembly. Present scholarship accordingly insists that in\r\nsuch weighty matters there was no essential difference of view between\r\nearlier and later writers.[138]\r\n\r\nThese considerations have simplified but not solved the problem. Scholars\r\nnow agree that no contemporary account of the regal period—ending 509 (?)\r\nB.C.—ever existed; and even if it be conceded that the earliest Roman\r\nannalist—Fabius Pictor, born about 250 B.C.—had access to traditional\r\nor documentary[139] information reaching back to the close of that\r\nperiod, no historian will admit such a possibility for the beginnings of\r\nRome. It follows then that for the origin and character of her earliest\r\ninstitutions Cicero, Livy, and Dionysius, or their sources, have relied\r\nwholly on inference from later conditions, in so far as they have not\r\nresorted to outright invention. Though with their abundant material\r\nthey were in a far better position for making such deductions than we\r\nare, they lacked the experience and the acute critical method of the\r\nmoderns.[140] Of the three writers above mentioned—our main sources for\r\nthe subject under discussion—Cicero was essentially an orator, Dionysius\r\na rhetorician, and Livy, though historian in name, was in spirit\r\nrhetorical and dramatic rather than critical. Naturally therefore they or\r\ntheir sources, who on the whole were equally uncritical, made mistakes\r\nin the difficult work of drawing inferences as to the history and\r\ninstitutions of the regal period. Such is the view of historians today.\r\nIt was formerly argued that Dionysius, a rhetorician and a Greek, failed\r\nin spite of his twenty-two years of preparation at Rome to understand\r\nthe spirit and character of the Roman constitution and has therefore\r\nbeen an especial fountain of error;[141] but it is now clear that though\r\nin his treatment of early Rome he shows far greater amplitude than Livy\r\nand is for that reason proportionally more liable to error in detail, he\r\nfollows good Roman sources for institutions, and is in this field, with\r\nthe reservation here mentioned, not essentially inferior to the extant\r\nnative writers.[142]\r\n\r\nConsidering the sources untrustworthy and following certain clues which\r\nhe believed they afforded to a right understanding of the annalists,\r\nNiebuhr came to his theory as to the composition of the primitive\r\nRoman state. Although he asserts that it was made up of “patrons and\r\nclients,”[143] he does not rest satisfied with this view, but proceeds to\r\ntrace clientage to the following origins, as though in his opinion this\r\ninstitution did not exist from the beginning: (1) some native Siculians\r\nperhaps, who were conquered by Latin invaders; (2) strangers settling on\r\nRoman territory and choosing a Roman as protector; (3) inhabitants of\r\ncommunities which were obliged to take refuge under Roman protection;\r\n(4) manumitted slaves.[144] Logically he goes back to a state made up\r\nexclusively of patricians.\r\n\r\nHe sought evidence for this hypothesis in the scheme of tribal\r\norganization of Rome. The primitive city was divided into three tribes,\r\nthirty curiae and, as he believed, three hundred gentes. As no one could\r\nbe a citizen without membership in a gens,[145] and as the patricians\r\nalone were active members of the gentes,[146] it must follow that the\r\npatricians alone were citizens. It is doubtful whether he would have\r\nproposed this hypothesis had it not been for the analogy of the Attic\r\ntribal scheme. An imperfect quotation from the lost part of Aristotle’s\r\n_Constitution of Athens_[147] seems to signify that the Athenian state\r\nwas once divided into four tribes (φυλαί), twelve phratries and three\r\nhundred and sixty gentes (γένη). On this authority Niebuhr supposes that\r\nthe phratry was a group of gentes, and he assumes further that both\r\nphratries and gentes were composed exclusively of eupatrids.[148] But the\r\nsuppositions (1) that there were three hundred and sixty gentes, (2) that\r\nthe phratry was a group of gentes, (3) that both phratries and gentes\r\ncontained only eupatrids are contradicted by well known facts. From the\r\nearliest times the Greek tribes and phratries included commons as well as\r\nnobles. This is true of the Homeric Greeks,[149] and a law of Draco[150]\r\nproves that the early Attic phratry comprised both nobles and commons.\r\nIn historical times all citizens belonged to the phratries; whereas but\r\nfew were members of the gentes.[151] Most of the gentes were in fact\r\ncomposed of the old landed nobility, though a few, like the Chalkidae and\r\nthe Eupyridae, were apparently industrial guilds, which had received the\r\nprivileges of the gentes. So far therefore from supporting Niebuhr in his\r\npeculiar view of the Roman gentes and curiae, the Attic analogy militates\r\nin every way against him. As his assumption that the curia was a group of\r\nten gentes has already been disproved,[152] it remains only to consider\r\nwhether the gens was an exclusively patrician institution. From the\r\ncircumstance that patricianism is not given as an element of Scaevola’s\r\ndefinition, quoted by Cicero,[153] we may at once conclude that in their\r\ntime plebeians, too, were gentiles. This conclusion is supported by a\r\nvariety of evidence.\r\n\r\nSeveral plebeian gentes are mentioned, including the Minucia and the\r\nOctavia,[154] the Lutatia,[155] the Calpurnia,[156] the Domitia,[157]\r\nthe Fonteia,[158] the Aurelia,[159] and the Licinia.[160] Some gentes\r\ncomprised both patrician and plebeian families, as the Cassia,[161] the\r\nClaudia,[162] the Cornelia,[163] the Manlia,[164] the Papiria,[165] the\r\nPublilia or Poplilia,[166] the Aebutia,[167] and the Servilia.[168] Not\r\nonly do the sources refer to several plebeian gentes by name, but they\r\nclearly imply in other ways the existence of such associations. Livy[169]\r\nexpresses the patrician sentiment that “it would seem an affront to the\r\ngods for honors to be vulgarized and for the distinction between gentes\r\nto be confused at auspicated comitia” (by the election of plebeians to\r\nthe consular tribunate). “The distinction between gentes” can only mean\r\nthe distinction between patrician and plebeian gentes—an interpretation\r\nconfirmed by a similar statement of Cicero[170] to Clodius, who had\r\npassed by arrogation from a patrician to a plebeian gens: “You have\r\ndisturbed the sacra and contaminated the gentes, both the one you have\r\ndeserted and the one you have defiled” (by your admission into it). To\r\nour other proofs we may add the consideration that the very expression\r\ngentes patriciae[171] implies the existence of plebeian gentes. It is\r\nnatural then that Varro[172] should make gentilitas a condition of men\r\nin general. In asserting that there were a thousand gentile names the\r\nsame authority[173] must have included those of plebeians, for scarcely a\r\nhundred belonging to patricians could have been known to him. By no means\r\nthe weakest argument in favor of the view here presented is the fact that\r\nthe laws of the Twelve Tables concerning inheritance, tutelage,[174]\r\netc.—which apply not to the patricians alone but to the whole citizen\r\nbody—assume that every citizen in full possession of his civil rights\r\nbelonged to a gens.\r\n\r\nA passage often interpreted against the existence of plebeian gentes\r\nis Livy x. 8. 9: “Vos solos gentem habere.” In this case a plebeian\r\nspeaker says the patricians claim that they alone have gens (not\r\ngentes). The context shows clearly, however, that gens does not here\r\ndenote an association but is used in the sense of illustrious birth or\r\npedigree,[175] as is sometimes our word family.[176] Wherever a nobility\r\nexists it necessarily lays greater stress on descent than do the people,\r\nand in all countries the nobles are in a far better position to keep up\r\nfamily connections than are the commons. Naturally therefore at Rome we\r\nhear more of patrician than of plebeian gentes. But in view of all the\r\nfacts mentioned above there should be no doubt as to the existence of the\r\nlatter. The result of this discussion is that neither in the composition\r\nof the gens nor in its position in the community can support be found for\r\nNiebuhr’s assumption of a patrician state.[177]\r\n\r\nOther evidence for his hypothesis Niebuhr thinks he finds in a statement\r\nof Labeo,[178] that the curiate assembly was convoked by a lictor,\r\nthe centuriate by a horn-blower; while Dionysius[179] says that the\r\npatricians were summoned by name through a messenger, the people by\r\nthe blowing of a horn. Thus Niebuhr maintains that Labeo and Dionysius\r\nagree unequivocally in designating the curiae as the assembly of the\r\npatricians. But in fact these two sources refer to the customs of the\r\nhistorical age, when the curiate assembly was ordinarily attended\r\nby only three augurs and thirty lictors. Horn-blowing under these\r\ncircumstances would have been absurd. The summoning of the patricians\r\nby their own name and that of their father, on the other hand, proves\r\nthem too few to compose a popular assembly. These citations therefore\r\nare far from supporting his hypothesis. His last and greatest proof is\r\nthe identification of the lex de imperio, passed by the curiae, with the\r\npatrum auctoritas. If these are merely two terms for the same act, the\r\ncuriae must have been made up of patres. But by establishing the fact\r\nthat the patrum auctoritas belonged to the senate or to its patrician\r\nmembers, Willems[180] and Mommsen[181] have deprived Niebuhr’s hypothesis\r\nof its main prop.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr evidently believed that the curiae continued exclusively\r\npatrician through the whole republican period.[182] This idea, however,\r\nmust be dismissed for the following reasons: (1) Our sources agree that\r\nin the early republic the plebeians and clients continued to vote in\r\nthe curiate assembly.[183] (2) The plebeians were in the curiae in 208\r\nB.C., when the first curio maximus was chosen from the plebs.[184] (3) In\r\nthe time of Cicero thirty plebeian[185] lictors represented the comitia\r\ncuriata, and gave the votes.[186] (4) Arrogations by plebeians took place\r\nin this assembly; in the well-known case of Clodius it must be borne in\r\nmind that it was a plebeian who arrogated him. (5) The extinction of the\r\npatriciate did not involve the downfall of the comitia curiata.[187]\r\n(6) The confirmation by the curiae (lex de imperio) of elections in the\r\ncenturiate assembly was conceived as a second vote of the community.[188]\r\n(7) The resolutions of the comitia curiata are always thought of as\r\nresolutions of the populus, which Latin literature nowhere restricts to\r\nthe patrician body. (8) In all ancient literature there is nowhere the\r\nslightest hint of a change in the social composition of the curiae or\r\nof the comitia curiata in the whole course of their history. What the\r\nancients believed to be true of either institution at any particular\r\nperiod will hold therefore for its entire history.[189]\r\n\r\nOf the arguments in favor of Niebuhr’s hypothesis either added by\r\nSchwegler[190] or brought by him into greater prominence, one only\r\ndemands attention. He reasons that if the plebs were in the curiate\r\nassembly, it would be impossible to explain the political advance made\r\nby the institution of the comitia centuriata; and the constitutional\r\nhistory of Rome would be reduced to an insoluble riddle. Here we have\r\nto deal with a subjective argument—the rejection of sources because\r\nthey do not agree with a preconceived theory. Arguments of the kind,\r\nhowever, which may be easily invented for the support or overthrow\r\nof every imaginable proposition, carry little weight. Besides it is\r\neasy to show by analogies from the history of other peoples that the\r\npresence of the commons in the primitive assembly does not make the\r\nconstitutional history of Rome a real enigma. In the primitive German\r\nassembly, for instance, were included all the warriors; and yet in the\r\nmore developed German states were monarchies and aristocracies which gave\r\nthe people little or no voice in the management of public affairs.[191]\r\nThe Homeric Greek assembly included all freemen, who, however, had\r\nlittle to do with the government in that period, and still less under\r\nthe aristocracy which followed.[192] In like manner, although the\r\nplebeians attended the comitia curiata and had a majority of votes in\r\nthis assembly, they could not thereby control the government, for they\r\nabsolutely lacked initiative.[193] The comitia centuriata, a timocratic\r\ninstitution, elevated the rich and degraded the poor. Here as elsewhere\r\nthe poor lost by the substitution of aristocracy for kingship; but a\r\nreal constitutional advance was made in the gradations of privilege,\r\nwhich were based on wealth and which reached like a ladder from the\r\nhumblest member of the proletarian century to the patrician knight in the\r\nsex suffragia.[194] These gradations prepared the way for an ultimate\r\nequalization of rights. We conclude, then, that the presence of the\r\ncommons in the primitive assembly is perfectly compatible with a rational\r\nview of constitutional development.\r\n\r\nWith Schwegler, who grants however reluctantly that the commons were\r\nreceived into the curiae before 208,[195] the theory enters upon its\r\npresent phase; for the great majority of writers since his time have\r\naccepted his view, yet with varying opinions as to the date of the\r\nchange. Mommsen,[196] who more than any one else has made it clear that,\r\nso far back as our sources reach, the populus comprised both patricians\r\nand commons, nevertheless assumes that the latter were originally\r\noutside the populus but were admitted no later than the beginning of the\r\nrepublic.[197] In his reconstruction of the primitive state he supposes\r\nthat the citizens were all patres, in so far as they, and they alone,\r\ncould be fathers; or adjectively patricii, in so far as they, and they\r\nalone, had fathers.[198] Added to the citizens and their slaves was a\r\nclass of persons termed clients, half way between freedom and slavery—a\r\nclass made up from various origins but chiefly by the conquest of\r\nneighbors.[199] These clients belonged, as dependents of the gentes, to\r\nthe curiae, but had no vote in the assembly.[200] Later the plebs were\r\nformed from the clients as the bond which united the latter with their\r\npatrons relaxed.[201] The plebs, who were free citizens of inferior\r\nrank, came into being at the moment when the patricio-plebeian comitia\r\ncenturiata acquired the right to express the will of the community.[202]\r\n\r\nAlthough Mommsen knows well the weakness of the evidence offered by\r\nearlier writers, he adopts the hypothesis of an original patrician state,\r\nwithout attempting a systematic defence. Here and there in his works,\r\nhowever, he mentions some fact or condition which he would like to have\r\nconsidered proof. The following are the chief passages of this kind:\r\n\r\n(1) The lack of right to the auspicia[203] and to the imperium[204] on\r\nthe part of the plebeians proves that the patriciate was the original\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nBut we could as reasonably say, with reference to the auspices, that\r\nthe two Attic gentes which furnished the sacred exegetes contained the\r\nonly Athenian citizens.[205] The auspicia, as Soltau[206] has noticed,\r\nbelonged to the ius honorum, as did also the imperium; hence they were\r\nboth privileges of the nobility. In brief Mommsen’s reasoning would make\r\na governing nobility everywhere impossible.\r\n\r\n(2) The cavalry were patrician; therefore the infantry must have\r\nbeen.[207]\r\n\r\nWith the same kind of reasoning we could conclude that because in the\r\nHomeric age of Greece chariots were used in war by nobles only, the\r\ninfantry must also have been exclusively noble; whereas we know that the\r\nrank and file were common men.[208] That the Roman army before Servius\r\nwas similarly composed is supported not only by this and many other\r\nanalogies, but also by the unanimous testimony of the sources. As in\r\nother primitive states the warriors belonged to the assembly and were the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n(3) Of the sixteen local tribes named after gentes it can be proved that\r\nten have the names of patrician gentes, and not one name is known to be\r\nplebeian. This is evident proof that from the beginning the patriciate\r\nwas not nobility but citizenship.[209]\r\n\r\nHis premises prove no more than that at the time when these tribes were\r\ninstituted the patricians were influential enough to give their names to\r\nten, probably to all sixteen. In all the three cases mentioned, Mommsen\r\nreasons that because the patricians alone enjoyed the honors, privileges,\r\nand influence usually considered appropriate to a nobility, they must\r\ntherefore have constituted not the nobility simply but the whole citizen\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n(4) He identifies patres with gentiles and assumes that the primitive\r\nstate was an aggregate of gentes, thus making the patres the only members\r\nof the state.[210]\r\n\r\nThese are not proofs but unsupported assumptions. The only connection of\r\npatres with gentes given in Latin literature is in the well-known phrases\r\npatres maiorum and minorum gentium; and Cicero[211] makes it clear that\r\nthese patres were senators. The phrase means senators from, or belonging\r\nto, the greater or lesser gentes. Furthermore it has been proved (1) that\r\nthe patricians were not the only gentiles,[212] (2) that the curia, and\r\nhence the state, was not an aggregation of gentes.[213]\r\n\r\n(5) We are informed, says Mommsen, (a) that the body of full Roman\r\ncitizens consisted originally of a hundred families, whose fathers,\r\nthe patres, regarded more or less concretely as the ancestors of the\r\nindividual gentes, composed the senate, and together with them their\r\ndescendants, the patricians, made up the citizen body; or expressed\r\nin other words (b) patrician originally meant just what was afterward\r\nincluded under the term ingenuus.[214]\r\n\r\nFor (a) Mommsen cites those passages by which it has been shown[215]\r\nthat the Romans looked upon the original hundred senators as the\r\nfathers neither of the “citizen body” nor of the “full citizens,” but\r\nof the nobility. His statement of the case is directly contradicted\r\nby the authorities he quotes. As regards (b) it has been sufficiently\r\nproved[216] that ingenuus when made equivalent to patricius most\r\nnaturally signifies not “of free birth,” but “of respectable, noble\r\nbirth.”\r\n\r\nMost scholars have wisely avoided bringing the myth of the asylum[217]\r\ninto the argument. Pellegrino,[218] however, identifies the refugees\r\nat that place with the entire plebeian body. As the asylum was not\r\nan Italian but a Greek institution,[219] the story connected with it\r\nis doubtless a myth. It seems to have been invented by the Greeks of\r\nsouthern Italy, most probably in the fourth century B.C. At that time\r\nthey began to view with alarm the southward advance of the Romans, and\r\nto disparage them accordingly by falsifications representing their\r\norigin as obscure and disreputable.[220] Similar calumnies against other\r\npeoples were concocted by their Greek enemies.[221] Notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that the story had not even a kernel of historical truth the\r\nRomans accepted it with more or less modification[222] and used it to\r\nsome extent for partisan objects.[223] They could not oppose the plebs to\r\npatricians as foreigners to natives, however, for (1) they supposed that\r\nplebeians as well as patricians participated in the original settlement\r\nof Rome, (2) they derived patrician as well as plebeian families from\r\nforeign sources.[224] We are warranted in concluding that in adopting the\r\nGreek myth of the asylum they looked upon it as a cause of increase in\r\nthe plebeian population without finding in it the origin of the plebeian\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nTo the theory of an exclusively patrician populus the following\r\nobjections may be summarily urged: (1) It is opposed by the unanimous\r\ntestimony of the ancient authorities. (2) It rests upon a wrong\r\nexplanation of the words patres, patricii, as designations of the nobles.\r\n(3) It is further propped up by reasons so feeble as to testify at once\r\nto its weakness, the more substantial basis having been overthrown\r\npartly by Mommsen himself. (4) The number of patricians is too small for\r\nthe theory.[225] (5) It ignores the meaning of the word plebs, which\r\nevidently signifies “the masses,” in contrast with the few nobles, and\r\nhence could not apply to a class gradually formed by the liberation\r\nof clients, or by the admission of foreigners. No one who holds the\r\ntheory has attempted to show what these liberated clients were called\r\nwhen they were but few compared with the patricians—before they became\r\n“the multitude.” (6) It is contradicted by everything we know of Rome’s\r\nattitude towards aliens. So far back as our knowledge reaches, she was\r\nextremely liberal in bestowing the citizenship, even forcing it upon some\r\ncommunities. Only when she acquired the rule over a considerable part of\r\nItaly did she begin to show illiberality in this respect. Down to 353 the\r\ncitizenship thus freely extended included the right to vote.[226] (7) It\r\nassumes the existence of a community politically far advanced yet showing\r\nno inequalities of rank among the freemen—a condition outside the range\r\nof human experience. It aims to explain the origin of the social classes\r\non purely Roman ground, ignoring the fact that distinctions of rank\r\nare far older than the city, and exist, at least in germ, in the most\r\nprimitive communities of which we have knowledge.[227]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Comparative-Sociological View_\r\n\r\nAs social classes belong to all society,[228] they cannot be explained\r\nby the peculiar conditions of any one community. The only scientific\r\napproach to this subject is through comparative study; the inferences of\r\nthe ancient historians relative to primitive Rome are not to be displaced\r\nby purely subjective theories, but are to be tested by comparison with\r\nconditions in other communities of equal or less cultural advancement.\r\n\r\nDistinctions of rank depend ultimately upon physical, mental, and moral\r\ninequalities,[229] which differentiate the population of a community\r\ninto leaders and followers.[230] The exhibition of physical strength\r\nand skill on the part of young men and of knowledge and wisdom on the\r\npart of the elders are often “the foundation of leadership and of\r\nthat useful subordination in mutual aid which depends on voluntary\r\ndeference.”[231] In an age in which men were largely under the control of\r\nreligion the possession of an oracle or skill in divination or prophecy\r\nmight contribute as much to the elevation of an individual above his\r\nfellows.[232] Leadership, once obtained, could display and strengthen\r\nitself in various ways. In primitive society the strong, brave,\r\nintelligent man was especially qualified to take command in war. Success\r\nbrought the chief not only renown but a large share of the booty and in\r\nlater time acquired land. The same result might be obtained by other\r\nmeans than by war;[233] but in any case wealth and influence inherited\r\nthrough several generations made nobility.[234] Primarily grounded on\r\nability, wealth, and renown, this preëminence was often heightened by a\r\nclaim to divine lineage or other close connection with the gods.[235]\r\n\r\nThere was evidently a stage of development—before the association of\r\nthe nobles into a class—in which chieftains alone held preëminence.\r\nThis condition is common in primitive society, as among the American\r\nIndians.[236] Also among the Germans, who had advanced somewhat beyond\r\nthis stage, each chief or lord appears to have been noble “less with\r\nreference to other noblemen than with reference to the other free\r\ntribesmen comprised in the same group with himself.”[237] From Brehon law\r\nwe infer that the Irish lords were individually heads of their several\r\ngroups of kinsmen or of vassals;[238] and in Wales the nobles were a\r\nhierarchy of chieftains.[239] As soon as leadership became hereditary\r\nthere arose noble families, in which the younger members were often\r\nsub-chieftains;[240] and finally through intermarriage among these\r\nfamilies, as well as through the discovery of common interests, the\r\nnobles associated themselves into a class.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Germans,[241] the Greeks of the Homeric age,[242]\r\nand in some early Italian states[243] certain families had become\r\nnoble, and others were on the way to nobility. For ancient Ireland the\r\nentire process can be followed. A common freeman enters the service of\r\nsome chief, from whom he receives permission to use large portions of\r\nthe tribe land.[244] By pasturing cattle, he grows wealthy, becomes a\r\nbo-aire (cow-nobleman) and secures a band of dependents. Supported by\r\nthese followers, he preys upon his neighbors and, if successful, becomes\r\nin time a powerful noble.[245] After “a certain number of generations”\r\nhe can no longer be distinguished from the blooded nobility.[246] Here\r\nis an instance of a common freeman’s becoming noble through service to\r\na chief. In like manner among the Saxons who had conquered England the\r\nceorl who “thrived so that he had fully five hides of land,” or the\r\nmerchant who had “fared twice over the wide sea by his own means,” became\r\na thane; “and if the thane thrived, so that he became an eorl, then was\r\nhe henceforth worthy of eorl-right.”[247] “The thanes were the immediate\r\ncompanions of the king—his comitatus—and from their first appearance\r\nin English history they took rank above the earlier nobility of Saxon\r\neorls, who were descended from ancient tribal chiefs. Thus the thanes as\r\na nobility of newly rich corresponded to the cow-noblemen of an earlier\r\ntime.”[248] In the way just described many rose from the lower ranks to\r\nnobility. In fact, eminent authorities assert that the inferior nobles,\r\nespecially of the middle age, were more often of servile than of free\r\norigin, as the common freemen were inclined to think it degrading to be\r\nseen among the comites of a chief.[249]\r\n\r\nIt has now been sufficiently established that even in the tribal\r\ncondition people were differentiated into social ranks. We have traced\r\nthe beginning of nobility to leadership and have found, in both\r\nancient and mediaeval society, new noble families forming by the side\r\nof the old. Social distinctions were well developed long before the\r\nfounding of cities. When a community, whether a tribe or a city, is far\r\nenough advanced to begin the conquest of neighbors, “it has already\r\ndifferentiated into royal, noble, free, and servile families.”[250] This\r\nwas true of Sparta. In her “the conquerors nevertheless, notwithstanding\r\ngreat differences among themselves, remain sharply separated in social\r\nfunction from the conquered.... The conquerors became a religious,\r\nmilitary, and political class, and the conquered an industrial\r\nclass.”[251] Even in the case of Sparta, however, which is perhaps our\r\nbest example of the exclusiveness of a ruling city, there is evidence\r\nof mingling between the conquering Spartans and the conquered Laconians\r\nbefore the former became exclusive.[252] In like manner there was much\r\nmixing of the invading “Aryans” with the natives of India—the more\r\nintelligent of the natives rising to the higher classes and the less\r\ngifted of the invaders sinking to the lower—before the crystallization\r\nof the castes.[253] We find the same mingling of conquerors and\r\nconquered in varying degrees in ancient Ireland,[254] in England under\r\nthe Normans,[255] and throughout the Roman empire in the period of\r\nGermanic settlements.[256] It becomes doubtful, therefore, whether a\r\nnobility was ever formed purely by the superposition of one community\r\nupon another. The effect of conquest was rather to accentuate existing\r\nclass distinctions, and by a partial substitution of strangers in place\r\nof native nobles to stir up antagonism between the classes. Even where\r\nthe differences between the social ranks seem to be racial, it would\r\nbe hazardous to resort to the race theory in explanation; for such a\r\ncondition could be produced in the course of generations by different\r\nmodes of life, education, nurture, and marriage regulations of the nobles\r\nand commons respectively.[257]\r\n\r\nThe study pursued thus far will enable us to understand how there came\r\nto be social classes at Rome before the beginning of conquest. But for\r\na long time after the Romans began to annex territory we may seek in\r\nvain for a distinction between conquerors and conquered, like that which\r\nwe find in Laconia. We are forbidden to identify the plebs with the\r\nconquered and the patricians with the conquerors by many considerations\r\nmentioned above—for instance, by tradition,[258] by the derivation\r\nof several patrician gentes from various foreign states,[259] by the\r\nfewness of the patricians,[260] and by the fact that the latter show\r\nno differentiations of rank, such as we find among the conquering\r\nSpartans; they were not a folk but a nobility pure and simple. We are\r\nto regard Rome’s early annexations of territory and of populations\r\nnot as subjugations, but as incorporations on terms of equality. The\r\npeople incorporated were of the same great folk, the Latins, or of a\r\nclosely related folk, the Sabines. Accordingly they were not reduced\r\nto subjection, but were admitted to citizenship, to the tribes and\r\nthe curiae, and their nobles were granted the patriciate.[261] Only\r\ncommunities of alien speech, like the Etruscan, or distant Italian\r\ncommunities like the Campanian, were ordinarily given the inferior\r\ncivitas sine suffragio; and this restricted citizenship does not appear\r\nin history before the middle of the fourth century B.C.\r\n\r\nThe analogies offered in this chapter, by proving that the conditions\r\nthey illustrate are possible for early Rome, tend to confirm the\r\nauthority of the sources. By similar comparative study it would be\r\npracticable to illustrate in detail and to corroborate the statements\r\nof ancient writers as to the organization of the plebs, as well as\r\nof the patricians, in tribes and curiae, the participation of the\r\nclients and plebeians in war and politics, and the deterioration of the\r\nfree commons through the strengthening of the nobility—all of which\r\nare rejected by eminent modern historians, who merely imagine them\r\nincompatible with primitive conditions or with a rational theory of\r\nconstitutional development. The inquiry has been pursued far enough,\r\nhowever, to indicate that from a comparative-sociological point of view\r\nthe conception of early Rome handed down to us by the ancients is sound\r\nand consistent, and that the method of subjective reconstruction of\r\nhistory introduced by Niebuhr and still extensively employed by scholars\r\nis unscientific.\r\n\r\n    I.

In view of the\r\nwell-established fact that the gens was a relatively late institution, we\r\nshould for this remote period exclude the idea of gentile tenure.[263]\r\nThe land was distributed among the families according to tribes and\r\ncuriae; and when the idea of ownership extended to the soil, it took the\r\nform of family ownership of the ager privatus and state ownership of the\r\npublic domain.[264]\r\n\r\nThe condition of tenure anterior to the conception of property in\r\nland left little trace of itself in the language and institutions and\r\nabsolutely none in tradition. The sources declare that family ownership\r\nexisted in Rome from her foundation as well as in her earliest colonies—a\r\nview confirmed by the comparative study of language.[265] Each family,\r\nthey assume, held two iugera—the heredium[266]—or we may more correctly\r\nsay, at least two iugera.[267] This small lot has generally been\r\nexplained[268] as the private landed property of the individual, in\r\ncontrast with the public land and with the common land of the gens, and\r\nthus it is taken as evidence of a condition prior to the extension of\r\nprivate ownership to the arable fields. Should we grant this to be the\r\ntrue explanation, we might still assume that public and gentile tenure\r\nhad developed into private ownership of arable land long before Servius,\r\nor that Servius himself converted the fields into private holdings. For\r\nthe second alternative we could find apparent support in the sources,\r\nwhich have much to say of the distribution of land among the citizens by\r\nServius.[269] For the continued absence of private ownership after the\r\nServian reforms not even the shadow of an authority can be found.\r\n\r\nBut the explanation of heredium given above is by no means necessary; in\r\nfact the sources regard it not as the only private land, but rather as\r\nthe smallest share allotted to any citizen, the rich and noble possessing\r\nmore.[270] While accordingly the wealthy man owned many iugera, the\r\npoor man, limited to his heredium, was obliged to earn part of his\r\nliving by labor as a tenant or as a wage-earner in the field of his rich\r\nneighbor;[271] and in the early colonies the bina iugera were granted\r\non the same aristocratic principle. If this is the true explanation of\r\nheredium, the strongest argument in support of the theory of public\r\nownership at Rome in the late regal period is taken away; we must either\r\nabandon the theory or relegate it to a time far anterior to the Servian\r\nreforms. Mommsen’s assumption[272] that the sixteen oldest rural tribes\r\nwere instituted some time after the city tribes by the division of\r\ngentile lands is untenable on other grounds. The gens which gave its\r\nname to the tribe could not have owned all the land in the tribe; for in\r\nthat case all but the sixteen gentes would have been landless. Again,\r\nassuming, as he does, that all the land belonged to the gentes, which\r\nhe supposes to have been exclusively patrician, we should be forced to\r\nconclude that the division left the plebeians landless. And further, if\r\nwe bear in mind that the gens developed from the family, we must also\r\nbelieve that the undivided gentile land was once a family estate, which\r\naccording to Roman usage had to be registered in some tribe, even if the\r\nland of the gens was not so registered. Mommsen’s theory proves therefore\r\nnot only to be unsupported by the sources but actually unthinkable. In\r\nconclusion we may safely say that though some land remained public, and\r\nthough the gens after it had come into existence owned some common land,\r\nindividual, or at most family,[273] ownership was in full force in the\r\nearliest times of which we have knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe clearest and most detailed account of the origin of the Servian\r\ntribes is given by Dionysius iv. 14. 1 f.: “When Tullius had surrounded\r\nthe seven hills with one wall, he divided the city into four parts, and\r\ngiving to the parts the names of the hills—to one Palatina, to another\r\nSuburana, to the third Collina, and to the fourth Esquilina—he made the\r\ncity to consist of four tribes, whereas up to that time it had comprised\r\nbut three.... And he ordained that the men who lived in each of the four\r\nparts should not change their abode or give in their census elsewhere.\r\nThe enlistment of soldiers also and the collection of taxes, which they\r\nwere to pay individually to the treasury for military and other purposes,\r\nwere distributed no longer among the three gentile tribes but among the\r\nfour local tribes instituted by him.... [15. 1:] And the whole country\r\nhe divided, as Fabius says,[274] into twenty-six parts, also called\r\ntribes, adding to them the four city tribes; but Venonius is authority\r\nfor thirty-one rural tribes, which with those of the city would complete\r\nthe thirty-five of our own time. Cato, however, who is more trustworthy\r\nthan either of these two, says that all the tribes in the time of Tullius\r\namounted to thirty, though he does not separate the number of parts”\r\n(into urban and rural).\r\n\r\nA great variety of opinion has arisen regarding the original number\r\nof the Servian tribes. Niebuhr[275] believed that Servius created in\r\nall thirty, afterward reduced by unfortunate war with the Etruscans to\r\ntwenty. This view found supporters but was refuted by Huschke.[276] Those\r\nwho rejected it generally agreed that Servius divided the city into four\r\ntribes and the country into districts, regiones, pagi.[277] Mommsen[278]\r\ngave a new phase to the theory of the subject by assuming that the four\r\nso-called city tribes, which all the sources agree in ascribing to\r\nServius,[279] included the country as well as the city. According to\r\nthis hypothesis Alba[280] and Ostia,[281] for instance, belonged to the\r\nPalatine tribe. His opinion has found wide acceptance.[282] Afterward\r\nchanging his mind, he asserted that the four urban tribes were confined\r\nwithin the pomerium—a view which now seems to be established beyond\r\ndoubt.[283] With this final position of Mommsen the creation of theories\r\nas to the number and limitations of the Servian tribes has not been\r\nexhausted; for against the view that Servius instituted only the four\r\nurban tribes may be placed that of Pais,[284] who assigns their origin to\r\nthe censors of the year 304. The theory of Pais implies that the sixteen\r\nrural tribes which bore gentile names were far older than the four urban\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nLight will be thrown on this obscure subject by an inquiry into the\r\nrelation of the sources to one another. It seems certain that Fabius\r\nderived his information concerning the tribes and the entire centuriate\r\norganization from the “discriptio centuriarum”—a document in the censors’\r\noffice. Though ascribed to Servius Tullius as author,[285] it set forth\r\nthe centuriate system as it existed in reality before the reform—that\r\nis in the time of the first war with Carthage.[286] It was this late\r\nform of the centuriate organization which Fabius had in mind. He must\r\nhave been prevented, however, from ascribing to Servius the institution\r\nof all the thirty-three tribes then existing, by the recollection that\r\ntwo tribes were added as recently as 299 from territory too far from\r\nRome to have formed a part of her domain under Servius; and perhaps\r\nthe curiate organization led him to favor the number thirty. He made\r\nServius the author of thirty tribes, accordingly, in spite of the fact\r\nthat this number was not reached till 318. His error is not more absurd\r\nthan the ascription to Servius of the whole centuriate organization as\r\nit stood at the opening of the First Punic War, or the assumption that\r\nin the first Servian census were enrolled eighty thousand men fit for\r\nmilitary service.[287] Cato, who also states the original number as\r\nthirty, without separating them into rural and urban,[288] may have been\r\ninfluenced by Fabius, though it is likely that he drew from the same\r\nsource. Vennonius in making Servius the author of all thirty-five tribes\r\nbut slightly exceeds the absurdity of earlier writers.[289] Evidently\r\nFabius and Cato were the sources for all future annalists. While\r\ndepending on them, Varro seems to have noticed the error of ascribing\r\ntwenty-six rural tribes to Servius, as there were but seventeen of this\r\nclass before 387. To avoid the difficulty and at the same time to retain\r\nthe Fabian number, he supposed that the country districts of Servius were\r\nnot yet tribes but the regiones from which the tribes were afterward\r\nformed[290]—a superficial explanation in the true Varronian style.[291]\r\nFollowing Varro, however, later authorities generally speak of the four\r\nurban tribes of Servius without mentioning those of the country.[292] So\r\nDionysius, after referring to the four city tribes, proceeds to describe\r\ntheir character and functions, as though these were all the tribes then\r\nexisting.[293] Thus far he depends upon Varro. Fortunately, however,\r\nhe gained from Fabius the information that there were also twenty-six\r\nrural tribes, his description of which[294] is slightly troubled by the\r\nVarronian notion that these country districts were not so much tribes as\r\nregiones, πάγοι, but which served all the purposes of tribes including\r\nthe taking of the census.[295]\r\n\r\nThe various contradictory statements of the ancients regarding the\r\noriginal number of Servian tribes can now be appreciated at their\r\nrespective values. In the course of the discussion it has become evident,\r\ntoo, that Fabius and Cato, the sources of later annalists, had no tenable\r\nground for their assumption of thirty original tribes. Had they examined\r\nthe records, perhaps the succeeding parts of their own chronicles, they\r\nwould have found that before 387 there could have been only twenty-one\r\ntribes in all.[296] A less certain indication of the admission of\r\none or possibly two tribes still earlier in the republic may have\r\nexisted;[297] but here we reach the extreme limit of their knowledge.\r\nAny investigation of the number in the regal period, whether by the\r\nancients or by the moderns, must rest not upon contemporary records but\r\nupon inference pure and simple. We may inquire, accordingly, whether\r\nthe view of Mommsen[298] and Meyer[299] that the four city tribes were\r\ncreated first and existed for a time before the institution of the rural\r\ntribes, having no trustworthy foundation in the sources, can be deduced\r\nfrom our knowledge of the general conditions of the time. We must by all\r\nmeans avoid the supposition of Mommsen[300] that in the time of Servius\r\nthere was no private property in land outside of the city.[301] If then\r\nwe bear in mind two points which Mommsen has himself established, (1)\r\nthat the local tribe was an aggregate of private estates,[302] (2) that\r\nthe four urban tribes of Servius were limited to the city,[303] we must\r\nconclude that in the time of Servius the country estates were registered\r\nin rural tribes—in other words that Servius instituted rural as well\r\nas urban tribes.[304] The view of Meyer that all the citizens lived\r\nin the city and the dependents in the country[305]—which would afford\r\na ground for assuming the urban tribes to have been earlier than the\r\nrural—has no basis either in institutions or in tradition. If originally\r\nthe country was all-important,[306] and if at the dawn of history we\r\nfind the country and city politically equal, as is actually the case,\r\nwe have no motive for the insertion of an intermediate stage in which\r\nthe city was all-important. There was indeed a tendency toward the\r\nconcentration of political power within the city, but it did not advance\r\nbeyond the equalization of city and country.[307] To maintain Meyer’s\r\nview we should be obliged to complicate the early history of Rome with\r\ntwo revolutions—one by which the city gained supremacy over the country,\r\nand the other in which the supremacy was lost. It is mainly to defend the\r\nearly history of the comitia, and of the constitution in general, against\r\nthis complication that the present discussion of the early land tenure\r\nand of the origin of the Servian tribes is offered.\r\n\r\nThe original number of tribes, as has been stated, is unknown. It was\r\nincreased by the acquisition of territory. Possibly the annalists found\r\nan obscure trace of the admission of the sixteenth rural tribe—the\r\nClaudia—in 504. To that year Livy assigns the coming of Attius Clausus\r\nwith his host of clients, who were formed into the Claudian tribe.[308]\r\nWissowa[309] suggests that the immigration of the Claudian gens, the date\r\nof which did not appear in the original tradition,[310] was arbitrarily\r\nassigned to the year in which was recorded the admission of the tribe.\r\nThis conjecture is supported by the situation of the Claudia, which would\r\nplace it among the latest of the twenty.\r\n\r\nWith more confidence we may assign the admission of the seventeenth rural\r\ntribe—the twenty-first in the entire list—to 495.[311] It must have been\r\nthe Clustumina.[312] We are certain that there were only twenty-one\r\ntill 387, when four new tribes were formed, bringing the number up to\r\ntwenty-five.[313] The twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh were admitted in\r\n358,[314] the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth in 332,[315] the thirtieth\r\nand thirty-first in 318,[316] the thirty-second and thirty-third in\r\n300[317], the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth in 241.[318] To the year\r\n90 that number is known to have remained unchanged, and the evidence of\r\na temporary increase during the Social War is obscure. On this point\r\nAppian[319] states that “the Romans did not enroll the newly admitted\r\ncitizens in the existing thirty-five tribes for fear that, being more\r\nnumerous, they might outvote the old citizens in the comitia; but by\r\ndividing them into ten parts (?) they made new tribes, in which the new\r\ncitizens voted last.” This view of an increase in number is confirmed by\r\na statement of Sisenna[320] as to the creation of two new tribes at about\r\nthat time. Velleius[321] however informs us that the new citizens were\r\nenrolled in eight tribes. In the object of the arrangement he agrees with\r\nAppian. Next he mentions the promise of Cinna to enroll the Italians in\r\nall the tribes. From the connection we should naturally infer that in\r\nthe opinion of Velleius the new citizens were enrolled before Cinna in\r\neight old tribes; and yet it is difficult to understand how the assembly\r\ncould be persuaded to visit any group of rural tribes with this disgrace\r\nand political disability.[322] As the authority of Sisenna, if not that\r\nof Appian, compels us to accept the fact of new tribes, it is better to\r\ninterpret Velleius in that light.[323] We may suppose then that the\r\neight tribes which he mentions were provided for by the Julian law of 90;\r\nand we must accept the statement of Sisenna that in 89 the Calpurnian\r\nlaw “ex senati consulto” created two other new tribes, in which were to\r\nbe enrolled the citizens admitted under this law. Thus we could account\r\nfor the ten (?) new tribes mentioned by Appian. As regards the Lucanians\r\nand the Samnites, who held out obstinately against Rome, the same\r\nhistorian[324] states that they were respectively enrolled in tribes, as\r\nin the former instances. He does not inform us, however, that for this\r\npurpose other new tribes were instituted. At all events there seems to be\r\nno essential disagreement among our sources; and we have no reasonable\r\nground for doubting an increase, though we may remain uncertain as to the\r\nnumber added.[325]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement was only temporary. In 88 Sulpicius, tribune of the\r\nplebs, carried a law containing a provision for the distribution of the\r\nnew citizens and the libertini among all the thirty-five tribes.[326]\r\nHis plebiscite was annulled by the senate on the ground that it had\r\nbeen passed by violence;[327] but the provisions contained in it were\r\nafterward legalized by a senatus consultum, and it was finally carried\r\ninto effect by Cinna as consul in 84.[328] This settlement of the\r\nquestion was approved by Sulla[329] for all the Italians excepting\r\nthe Marsians and the Paelignians, who were enrolled in one tribe—the\r\nSergia.[330]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the tribes may be inferred from their object. The\r\nintention of the organizer was to introduce the Greek military system,\r\ncomprising heavy and light infantry, in which the kind of service to be\r\nperformed depended upon financial ability to provide equipments.[331]\r\nSeeing that a classification of citizens with respect to property was\r\nnecessary for this purpose, Servius instituted the tribes as a basis\r\nfor the census. That they contained the ager privatus only is indicated\r\nby the exclusion from them of the Capitoline and Aventine hills.[332]\r\nTheir local character is established by the concurrent testimony of\r\nancient writers.[333] Yet even in the beginning they could but roughly\r\nbe described as districts, for they excluded all public land and all\r\nwaters and waste places claimed neither by individuals nor by the\r\ngovernment. They retained the approximate character of districts so long\r\nonly as the territory of annexed communities continued to be formed\r\ninto new tribes. The process came to an end in 241; and it was as early\r\nat least as this date that the Roman colonies, not originally in the\r\ntribes, were incorporated in them.[334] Thereafter the annexation of\r\nnew territory tended more and more to render the tribes geographically\r\nindeterminate.[335] The process was far advanced by the admission (90-84)\r\nof the Latins and Italians with their lands to the existing tribes,[336]\r\nwhich were further enlarged in the imperial period by the incorporation\r\nof provincial communities.[337] As consisting of lands, though no longer\r\nnecessarily adjacent, they were still considered local.[338]\r\n\r\nThe tribe was also a group of persons; in fact the word applies far more\r\nfrequently to persons than to territory.[339] During the early republic\r\na considerable degree of harmony was maintained between the two aspects\r\nof the institution (1) possibly by a restriction on the transfer of\r\nresidence,[340] (2) by the change in membership from tribe to tribe,\r\nthrough the censors, on the basis of a transfer of domicile, (3) by the\r\nassignment of new citizens to the tribe in or near which they had their\r\nhomes, (4) by the creation of new tribes for new citizens who did not\r\nlive in or near the existing tribes. This harmony experienced its first\r\nserious disturbance through the enrolment of the landless, irrespective\r\nof domicile, in the urban tribes in 304,[341] but continued to such\r\na degree that a hundred years later the rural voters generally still\r\nresided in their own tribes.[342] In the last century of the republic\r\nthe personal tribe, emancipated from the local, depended solely on\r\ninheritance and the will of the censors.[343]\r\n\r\nThe original composition of the personal tribe is determined by its\r\npurely military object. It comprised accordingly those only who were\r\nliable to service in war. From the early Roman point of view those\r\ncitizens were qualified who found their livelihood in agriculture.[344]\r\nNot all landowners were enrolled in the tribes; for Latin residents,[345]\r\nfreedmen,[346] widows and orphans,[347] all of whom might possess land,\r\nlacked membership. Those proprietors, too, were excluded whom the\r\ncensors assigned to the aerarii as a punishment. Tribesmen were all the\r\nother landowners—adsidui[348] et locupletes[349]—together with the male\r\ndescendants of military age under their potestas.[350]\r\n\r\nAnother object of the tribes, referred to Servius by our sources,\r\nwas the collection of taxes.[351] We know that they afterward served\r\nthis purpose; and the ancient writers, who could have had no direct\r\nknowledge of the intentions of Servius but who assigned to him without\r\nhesitation all the later developments of his organization, were in\r\nthis case especially misled by their false derivation of tributum from\r\ntribus or _vice versa_.[352] A brief study of the facts in the case will\r\nprove their inference to be wrong. The most obvious consideration is\r\nthat had Servius intended the tribes for the levy of taxes as well as\r\nfor military purposes, he would have included all who were subject to\r\ntaxation as well as all who were liable to service in the army, whereas\r\nin fact he admitted those only who were to serve. It is to be noted\r\nthat primitive Rome imposed no regular direct taxes on the citizens in\r\ngeneral. Every man equipped himself for war even after the introduction\r\nof the phalanx;[353] doubtless at first the knights provided their\r\nown horses;[354] and in short campaigns the soldiers carried their\r\nprovisions from their own farms.[355] Fortifications and public buildings\r\nwere erected by forced task-work. The king supported himself partly by\r\ngifts from his subjects and partly from the public property, including\r\nland.[356] Other early sources of revenue were tolls levied for the\r\nuse of harbors, boundaries, temples, bridges, roads, sewers, and salt\r\nworks.[357] In time the idea arose, too, that the person who did not\r\nperform military service should help with his property in the defence of\r\nthe country. The estates of widows and orphans were accordingly taxed\r\nto support the horses of the knights.[358] Those men, also, who were\r\nexempt from service because they possessed no land[359] and yet had other\r\nproperty were required to pay on it a regular tax. From this connection\r\nwith the public treasury (aerarium) they were termed aerarii. This class\r\ncomprised shopkeepers and merchants. Sometimes the censors assigned to\r\nit as a punishment men who owned land. The fact that such persons were\r\nat the same time removed from their tribes is sufficient proof that the\r\naerarii were originally outside these associations.[360] The cives sine\r\nsuffragio, or Caerites, after this class had come into existence in 353,\r\nwere like the aerarii in (1) that they did not belong to the tribes, (2)\r\nthat they paid a regular tax, (3) that men were placed on their list as\r\na punishment. They may accordingly be regarded as a special class of\r\naerarii, enrolled as they were in a distinct list.[361] Whereas the\r\ncives sine suffragio either wholly lacked the franchise, as the phrase\r\nimplies, or at most had but the right of the Latins,[362] the other\r\naerarii must have voted in the proletarian century.[363]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary taxes sufficed for the usual light expenses; but in case of\r\nespecial need an extraordinary tax was imposed upon the citizens. It was\r\ncalled tributum from tribuere, “to apportion,” because it was distributed\r\namong the citizens in proportion to their ratable property.[364] We hear\r\nof such a tax levied for ransoming the city from the Gauls[365] and\r\nanother for the building of a wall;[366] but the most common use was for\r\nthe payment of soldiers, hence the tributum was thought of primarily as\r\na war tax.[367] For this reason tributum came to be correlative with\r\nstipendium.[368] It was not often imposed before the introduction of pay\r\nin 406.[369] Even then it was not levied every year; it was sometimes\r\nrefunded when the condition of the treasury permitted; and it fell into\r\ndisuse after 167.[370] As it was imposed on those only who were liable\r\nto military duty,[371] the tribe lists were followed in its collection,\r\nand in this sense we may say that it was collected tributim.[372] The\r\nwork was done by state functionaries, as the tribe, so far as we know,\r\nhad neither fiscal officers[373] nor a treasury; and possessing no\r\nproperty, it could not be held financially responsible.\r\n\r\nAn epoch in the history of the tribes was made in 312 by Appius Claudius\r\nCaecus the censor, who enrolled the landless citizens, proletarians\r\nas well as aerarii, in the existing thirty-three tribes without\r\ndiscrimination.[374] Cives sine suffragio were alone excepted.[375]\r\nBy giving the landless the upper hand in the assemblies this measure\r\nroused the animosity of the proprietors, and thus endangered the peace\r\nof the state. In order to soothe the excited feelings of the better\r\nclass, Q. Fabius Rullianus, censor in 304, supported by his colleague\r\nDecius, removed the landless from the rural tribes; but not to deprive\r\nthem wholly of tribal privileges, he registered them in the four urban\r\ntribes. Hence his measure is spoken of as a compromise. Thereafter the\r\nlandholding and hence more respectable citizens were preferably enrolled\r\nin the rural tribes,[376] whereas the landless were confined to those of\r\nthe city.[377] It was a permanent gain that henceforth tribal membership\r\nwas a test of perfect citizenship. The censors still had the power to\r\ntransfer a man from one tribe to another, for instance, from a rural to\r\nan urban tribe; but they could not exclude him wholly from the tribes,\r\nfor that would be tantamount to depriving him of the citizenship.[378]\r\nThere were still aerarii; individuals and sometimes large groups of\r\ncitizens were still assigned as a punishment to this class, which,\r\nhowever, was henceforth included in the tribes of the city.[379]\r\nAlthough the ordinary urban tribesmen were usually exempt from military\r\nduty, the aerarii were required to serve, at times under especially\r\nhard conditions,[380] and were not disqualified for office.[381] In\r\nregistering them in the tribes Claudius made them, like the landowners,\r\nliable to military service and to the tributum according to their means.\r\nTo effect this object he necessarily assessed their personal property on\r\na money valuation; and in order to treat all tribesmen alike, he must\r\nhave changed the terms of valuation of the landholders’ estates from\r\niugera to money.[382]\r\n\r\n    Niebuhr, B.

According to Livy[383]—\r\n\r\n    “From those whose rating was 100,000 asses or more he made 80\r\n    centuries, 40 of seniors and 40 of juniors, and termed them all\r\n    the _first_ class. The seniors were to be ready for guarding\r\n    the city and the juniors were to serve in the field. The arms\r\n    required of them were a helmet, round shield, greaves, and\r\n    cuirass,—all bronze,—for the protection of the body. Their\r\n    offensive weapons were a spear and a sword. To this class were\r\n    added two centuries of sappers who were to serve without arms.\r\n    Their duty was to convey the engines of war. The _second_\r\n    class was made up of those whose rating was between 75,000 and\r\n    100,000 asses, 20 centuries of seniors and juniors together.\r\n    They were equipped with an oblong shield (scutum) instead of\r\n    a round one, and they lacked the cuirass, but in all other\r\n    respects their arms were the same. The minimal rating of the\r\n    _third_ class was 50,000 asses, and the number of centuries\r\n    was the same with the same distinction of age, and there was\r\n    no change in arms excepting that greaves were not required. In\r\n    the _fourth_ were those appraised at 25,000 asses. They had the\r\n    same number of centuries but their arms were changed, nothing\r\n    being assigned them but a spear and a long javelin. The _fifth_\r\n    class was larger, composed of 30 centuries. They carried\r\n    slings and stones for throwing. Among them were counted the\r\n    accensi, the hornblowers, and the trumpeters, 3 centuries. This\r\n    class was appraised at 11,000 asses. Those whose rating was\r\n    less formed one century exempt from military service. Having\r\n    thus armed and organized the infantry, he levied 12 centuries\r\n    of equites from among the chief men of the state. Also the\r\n    3 centuries instituted by Romulus he made into 6 others of\r\n    the same names as those under which the three had originally\r\n    been inaugurated.” Afterward Livy speaks of the votes of the\r\n    centuries in the comitia.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate source of this description, as well as of the similar\r\naccount given by Dionysius, is the censorial document already\r\nmentioned,[384] sometimes termed the “discriptio centuriarum,”[385]\r\nsometimes “Commentarii Servi Tullii”[386] on the supposition that Servius\r\nwas the author. In reality it belonged to the Censoriae Tabulae[387]\r\nof the period immediately following 269.[388] The document gave a list\r\nof the classes, centuries, and ratings, and furnished directions for\r\nholding the centuriate assembly. As the military divisions and equipments\r\nmentioned by Livy in the passage above had been discarded long before\r\nthis date,[389] they could not have been described in the document.\r\nThe account of them found in our sources must, therefore, have been\r\nsupplied by antiquarian study.[390] The annalist who first used these\r\nTabulae in the censorial archives was Fabius Pictor.[391] Whether Livy\r\nand Dionysius derived their account directly from him or through a later\r\nannalist cannot be determined.[392] Though Cicero’s source may ultimately\r\nhave been the same, he seems to have depended largely on his memory and\r\nis chronologically, though not in substance, less exact. In assigning\r\nseventy rather than eighty centuries to the first class he most probably\r\nhas in mind a stage of transition from the earlier to the reformed\r\norganization.[393]\r\n\r\nA brief analysis of this description, as presented by Livy or Dionysius,\r\nwill prove that it could not apply at the same time to an army and a\r\npolitical assembly: (1) The century of proletarians, which formed a part\r\nof the comitia, and which according to Dionysius was larger than all the\r\nrest together, was exempt from military service.[394] (2) The unarmed\r\nsupernumeraries termed accensi velati must in their military function\r\nhave lacked the centuriate organization, as will hereafter be made\r\nclear.[395] (3) The musicians and the skilled workmen who accompanied\r\nthe army must also be eliminated from the centuriate organization of\r\nthe army.[396] (4) The seniors, too, lacked the centuriate military\r\norganization.[397] (5) Thus the only pedites in the original centuriate\r\nsystem were the juniors. Even the military century of juniors was not\r\nin the beginning strictly identical with a voting century; and as\r\ntime progressed, the one group diverged more and more widely from the\r\nother.[398]\r\n\r\nChiefly from these facts, which will become clear in the course of\r\nthis study, we are warranted in concluding that the army was at no\r\ntime identical with the comitia centuriata. As one was necessarily an\r\noutgrowth of the other, the military organization must have been the\r\nearlier. If therefore the original form of the centuriate system is to\r\nbe referred to Servius Tullius, he will be considered the organizer\r\nof the phalanx, which the military centuries constituted,[399] not of\r\nthe comitia.[400] This result harmonizes with the view of the ancient\r\nwriters that the comitia centuriata exercised no functions—hence we have\r\na right to infer that it had no existence—before the beginning of the\r\nrepublic.[401]\r\n\r\nThe following sketch of the development of the Roman military system from\r\nthe earliest times to the institution of the manipular legion includes\r\nthose features only which are essential to an understanding of the origin\r\nand early character of the centuriate assembly. The view maintained\r\nin this volume is, as suggested in the preceding paragraph, that the\r\ncomitia centuriata in the form described by Livy and Dionysius developed\r\nfrom the early republican military organization, which was itself the\r\nresult of a gradual growth. Reference is made to equipments chiefly for\r\nthe purpose of throwing light on the relation of the Roman to the Greek\r\norganization and of the various Roman military divisions to one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _The Primitive Graeco-Italic Army and the Origin of the Phalanx_\r\n\r\nRecent research has brought to light a period of Italian history during\r\nwhich the military system of the Latins and Etruscans closely resembled\r\nthat of the Mycenaeans, the former doubtless being derived in large\r\npart from the latter.[402] The nobleman,[403] equipped in heavy armor,\r\nrode forth in his chariot[404] to challenge his peer among the enemy to\r\npersonal combat. The mass of common footmen were probably grouped in\r\ntribes and curiae (Greek phratries, brotherhoods),[405] as in Homeric\r\nGreece[406] and among the early Europeans[407] before the development of\r\nan organization based on a numerical system. The arms of the footmen must\r\nhave been lighter, and probably varied with the individual’s financial\r\nresources. These common troops could have had no special training or\r\ndiscipline, as they counted for little in war.[408] Yet in the Homeric\r\nage of Greece some attempt was made to keep the fighters in line, and to\r\nprevent the champions from advancing beyond it to single combat.[409]\r\nA similar tendency to even, rhythmic movement may be inferred for\r\nthe Latin army.[410] The great innovators in this direction were the\r\nLacedaemonians, to whom the honor of inventing the phalanx is chiefly\r\ndue.[411] This improvement, which made an epoch in European warfare,\r\ncould not have been later than the eighth century B.C. The phalanx was a\r\nline, several ranks deep, of heavy-armed warriors, who moved as a unit\r\nto the sound of music.[412] The depth varied as the occasion demanded;\r\nit was not necessarily uniform throughout the line, but for Lacedaemon\r\neight may be considered normal.[413] The heavy-armed trooper carried\r\na large shield, which covered the entire body, a helmet, and greaves;\r\nhis offensive weapons were sword and spear.[414] Tyrtaeus mentions also\r\na coat of mail though not as an essential part of the equipment.[415]\r\nThe metal of their defensive armor was mostly bronze; their swords and\r\nspear-points were probably iron, which the mines of Laconia abundantly\r\nsupplied.[416] Although it is well known that the phalanx was composed\r\nof smaller units, the original organization can only be conjectured. It\r\nis not unlikely that in the beginning there were tribal regiments,[417]\r\ndivided into companies of fifty or perhaps a hundred,[418] which were\r\nmade up of still smaller groups. The military age extended from the\r\ntwentieth to the sixtieth year.[419]\r\n\r\nThe phalanx was readily adopted by other Greek states, which modified it\r\nto suit their several conditions. In Athens and probably elsewhere the\r\narmy had a tribal organization,[420] but a census was introduced in order\r\nto determine who possessed sufficient wealth for service on horseback, in\r\nthe heavy infantry, and in the light infantry; and when once the census\r\nclasses were adopted, it was easy to extend them to political uses. In\r\nthis way the four property classes at Athens, probably instituted about\r\nthe middle of the seventh century B.C.,[421] became under Solon if not\r\nearlier a basis for the distribution of offices and other political\r\nprivileges. Naturally the Greeks of Sicily and Italy adopted the phalanx,\r\nand it is reasonable to suppose that the Romans derived it, through the\r\nEtruscans,[422] from one of these neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Servian Army_\r\n\r\nAs the heavy troops of the Greek line were all armed alike, the Romans\r\nprobably at first composed their phalanx in a similar way, without\r\ngradations of equipment. The complex system of census groupings in the\r\narmy as we find it immediately before the institution of the manipular\r\nlegion could only have resulted from a long development. The statement\r\nlast made finds justification in the fact that the term classis[423] was\r\noriginally limited to the first or highest census group, all the rest\r\nbeing “infra classem.”[424]\r\n\r\nNot only was the organization like that of the Greeks, but the arms, too,\r\nwere in the main Greek. The soldiers of the classis were equipped with\r\nhelmet, shield, greaves, spear, and sword; as they wore a cuirass, they\r\nused a large round Etruscan buckler[425] instead of the man-covering\r\nDorian shield. They were grouped in centuries,[426] forty of which\r\ncomposed the classis in the fully developed phalanx.[427] The age of\r\nservice of the juniors, who alone fought in the field, extended from the\r\ncompleted seventeenth to the completed forty-sixth year,[428] whereas the\r\nseniors from the forty-seventh to the sixtieth year formed a reserve.\r\n\r\nA still nearer connection can be found between the Roman and the Greek\r\nhorsemen. As is proved by archaeology, the earliest Greek knights had\r\nno specialized weapons or armor and were not accustomed to fight on\r\nhorseback, but were heavy infantry who used their horses simply as\r\nconveyance.[429] The same is true of the earliest Roman equites, whose\r\nequipment closely resembled that of the Greek horsemen. On account of\r\ntheir swiftness they were primitively called celeres.[430] Although these\r\nmounted footmen are generally known as equites, which in this sense may\r\nbut loosely be translated knights, the Romans did not institute a true\r\ncavalry till the period of the Samnite wars.[431] It is a curious fact\r\nthat some horsemen, Roman as well as Greek, were provided each with two\r\nhorses,[432] one for the warrior and the other for his squire,[433]\r\nand that the mounted soldiers of Etruria were in these respects the\r\nsame.[434] A further resemblance between the earliest Greek and Roman\r\nhorsemen lies in the fact that they were noble.[435]\r\n\r\nIn their account of the growth of the mounted service during the regal\r\nperiod the ancient authorities show great inconsistencies. It seems\r\nprobable that the early annalists pictured the increase in the knights\r\nin a way analogous to that of the senate: at first Romulus formed a\r\ntroop, or century, from the Ramnes; afterward a second was added from\r\nthe Tities; and still later the Luceres furnished a third.[436] Then\r\nTarquinius Priscus doubled the number, making six in all, and Servius\r\nfinally increased it to eighteen centuries. This simple development,\r\nitself a reconstruction, was complicated by the desire of the historians\r\nto make the number of knights under Servius agree with the number\r\nunder Augustus, given by Dionysius[437] at about 5000; hence the\r\nassumption of 200 or even 300 knights to the century as early as the\r\nreign of Romulus.[438] It is possible by clearing away these evident\r\nmisconceptions to discover the approximate truth.\r\n\r\nWhen the chariot gave way to the horseback rider is not definitely\r\nknown; at all events the change seems to have taken place under\r\nHellenic influence, and could hardly therefore have been earlier than\r\nthe beginning of the seventh century B.C.[439] The idea of the sources\r\nis that there came to be three troops of horsemen, furnished by the\r\ntribes,[440] as well as three regiments of foot, that before Servius\r\nthe number of troops of horse was doubled, and that the six troops thus\r\nformed were named accordingly after the tribes Ramnenses, Titienses,\r\nand Lucerenses priores and posteriores respectively.[441] The priores\r\nhad each two horses, the posteriores one.[442] Hence the essential\r\ndifference between these divisions was in rank and wealth rather than in\r\nthe relative time of their institution. Long after Servius both divisions\r\ncontinued to be patrician.[443] As the centuriate organization of Servius\r\napplied to the infantry, the cavalry remained little affected by it. The\r\nsix troops with their old names survived, and eventually became a part\r\nof the comitia centuriata. In the military sphere, however, the troop no\r\nlonger retained its identity; but the whole body was divided into twenty\r\nturmae, each composed of three decuries commanded by decurions.[444]\r\nWhen with the institution of the republic the phalanx was split into\r\ntwo legions, ten turmae of cavalry were assigned to each legion.[445]\r\nAs in historical time the number of horsemen to a legion did not exceed\r\n300,[446] and as we have no reason to suppose that at an earlier period\r\nthis arm of the service was proportionally stronger, we may conclude that\r\nin the Servian phalanx, or double legion, the number did not exceed 600.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing discussion it appears clear that the Servian military\r\nsystem rested upon a division of the citizens into four groups, closely\r\ncorresponding to the Athenian census divisions: (1) the equites\r\npriores, like the pentacosiomedimni, (2) the equites posteriores, like\r\nthe hippeis,[447] (3) the classis, like the zeugitae, (4) the light\r\ntroops infra classem, like the thetes. The distinction between priores\r\nand posteriores rested not upon an assessment but upon a less precise\r\ndifference in wealth, whether determined by the individual concerned\r\nor by the state we cannot know; it represented, too, a gradation of\r\nnobility. The distinction between the knights and the classici was one of\r\nrank; that between the classis and the soldiers infra classem was alone\r\ndetermined by the census.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Development of the Five Post-Servian Military Divisions on the\r\nBasis of Census Ratings_\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was by no means final. Further changes were made in both\r\nfoot and horse which were to have a bearing on the organization of the\r\ncomitia centuriata. After a time[448] two additions of men less heavily\r\narmed than the classici were made to the phalanx, whether simultaneously\r\nor successively cannot be determined. There were now forty centuries of\r\nclassici, and the additions comprised ten centuries each, the second\r\nless heavily armed than the first, though they may both be considered\r\nheavy in contrast with the light troops. Perhaps the state according to\r\nits ability made up the deficiency in the equipment, so as to render\r\nthe entire phalanx as evenly armed as possible.[449] It numbered sixty\r\ncenturies of heavy infantry, composed of three grades which depended\r\nupon the census rating.[450] The light troops were also grouped in two\r\ndivisions on the same principle. The first comprised ten centuries;\r\noriginally the second may have contained the same number, in which\r\ncase four were afterward added to make the fourteen known to exist in\r\nthe fully developed system.[451] There were five divisions of infantry\r\namounting to eighty-four centuries of a hundred men each. Undoubtedly the\r\ngrowth of the army to this degree of strength was gradual, though the\r\nsuccessive steps cannot be more minutely traced.[452]\r\n\r\nIn making the levy the military tribunes selected the soldiers from\r\nthe lists of tribesmen, taking one tribe after another as the lot\r\ndetermined.[453] The early Romans must have striven to distribute the\r\npopulation as equally as possible among the tribes in order to render\r\nthem approximately equal in capacity for military service. As long as\r\nthis equality continued, the officials could constitute the army of\r\nan equal number of men from each tribe. These considerations explain\r\nthe close relation in early time between the number of tribes and of\r\ncenturies as well as the suggestions offered by our sources as to an\r\nearly connection between the centuries and the tribes.[454] While there\r\nwere but twenty tribes we may suppose that the legion comprised but 4000\r\nmen, which was raised to 4200 when the twenty-first tribe was added. In\r\nthis way can we account for the number of centuries to the legion. If\r\nbut half the available military strength was required, the magistrates\r\nmight draw by lot ten tribes from which to make the levy.[455] It was an\r\neasy matter as long as the heavy troops were limited to the classis;[456]\r\nbut when two other ratings were added, and when meantime the tribes\r\nmust have grown unlike in population, it became practically impossible\r\nto maintain for each rating a just proportion from the tribes;[457] and\r\nperhaps this was the chief reason for the modification in the method of\r\nrecruiting. When therefore the tribes were increased to twenty-five, and\r\nit was deemed inexpedient to make a corresponding enlargement of the\r\nlegion,[458] a new principle was adopted for the levy: after determining\r\nthe ratio between the number of men needed and the whole number\r\navailable, the officers drew from each tribe a number proportionate\r\nto its capacity.[459] It would agree well with all the known facts to\r\nsuppose that the addition of the second and third ratings, followed by\r\na more thorough organization of the light troops, belongs to the early\r\nrepublic (509-387),[460] when Rome needed all her strength in her life\r\nand death struggle with hostile neighbors. At the same time the purchase\r\nof armor and the increased burden of military duty would help account\r\nfor the desperate economic condition of the poorer peasants of that epoch.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of the five ratings—20-15-10-5-2½ or 2—to be discussed\r\nhereafter,[461] suggest an explanation of their origin. It would be\r\nreasonable to assume that the normal holding of the well-to-do citizen\r\nwas a twenty-iugera lot and that the Servian phalanx was composed\r\nof possessors of that amount, the light-armed being their sons and\r\nothers distinctly inferior in wealth. In course of a few generations\r\nas the population grew, with no corresponding territorial expansion\r\nor colonization or industrial development, and with only a limited\r\nconversion of waste to arable land, many of the lots became divided\r\nand subdivided. The result was a weakening of the phalanx at a time\r\nwhen the state was in the most pressing need of military resources.\r\nThe institution of the five ratings as a basis for the reorganization\r\nof the army was a temporary expedient for meeting the crisis, to be\r\nsuperseded not long afterward by a better system founded on military\r\npay. In all probability the introduction of the five ratings, or at\r\nleast the beginning of the movement in that direction, should be closely\r\nconnected with the institution of the censorship in 443 or 435.[462] The\r\nsupposition would give us a sufficient reason for the creation of this\r\nnew office at that time, and the strengthening of the army would explain\r\nthe success of the Romans in the wars immediately following.\r\n\r\nHow the five ratings were arrayed in battle is unknown. If the front\r\ncounted a thousand men (milites),[463] the classis comprised four\r\nranks (4000), the second and third ratings one rank each, making in\r\nall six ranks of heavy troops (6000).[464] Twenty centuries could be\r\ndrawn from the two ratings of light troops to complete the eight ranks\r\nwhen needed.[465] But the Romans undoubtedly exercised the same good\r\njudgment as the Lacedaemonians in varying their formation to suit the\r\nemergency;[466] and for that reason it is wrong to assume the same depth\r\nfor all occasions or an even depth for any one occasion. The management\r\nof long lines one-man deep must have been extremely difficult, if not\r\nimpossible.[467] The explanation already suggested, that the state\r\nsupplied the deficiency in equipment,[468] would greatly simplify the\r\ncase, for there would then exist no need of arraying the census groups in\r\nsuccessive lines. Whatever may have been the tactic arrangement, it did\r\nnot continue long, for soon after the introduction of regular pay, about\r\n400 B.C.,[469] the distinction between the ratings ceased to have an\r\nimportance for military affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Question as to the Connection of the Supernumeraries and the\r\nSeniors with the Military Centuries_\r\n\r\nA number of supernumeraries termed accensi velati accompanied the army.\r\nThe epithet accensi proves them to have been outside the five ratings,\r\nwhile velati describes them as wearing civilian dress. We are informed\r\nby the sources that they carried water and weapons to the fighting men,\r\nstepped into the places of the dead and wounded, and acted as servants\r\nto the lower officers.[470] These men could not have been organized\r\nin centuries,[471] for they were drawn up in the rear behind the\r\nlight troops; they extended along the entire breadth of the army,[472]\r\nand must have greatly exceeded one hundred or even two hundred. The\r\nmusicians,[473] too, who accompanied the army were not grouped in two\r\ncenturies, for they were distributed throughout the army.[474] There is\r\nno reason for assuming exactly two hundred musicians[475] or exactly\r\ntwo hundred workmen,[476] or for supposing that any of the men of this\r\ndescription were organized in centuries in the army. Reasoning in a\r\nsimilar way in regard to the seniors, we conclude that their organization\r\nin centuries could not have belonged to the original Servian system. A\r\nmilitary century, as the name indicates, must have contained a hundred\r\nmen.[477] But in any static population there are three times as many men\r\nbetween seventeen and forty-six as between forty-six and sixty[478]—in\r\nRome there were three times as many juniors as seniors; and as the\r\nnumber of junior and senior centuries was equal, the latter could have\r\ncontained only about thirty-three each, on the supposition that the whole\r\nmale population between seventeen and forty-six years was organized in\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that the senior century contained so few men suggests that\r\nit was not a military institution. This impression is confirmed by the\r\ninformation that the seniors were reserved for the defence of the city,\r\nwhile the juniors took the field in active service.[479] When we reflect\r\nthat even in the early republic the seniors could not often have been\r\ncalled on for defence, as the juniors were ordinarily sufficient for the\r\npurpose,[480] that the manning of the walls did not necessarily require a\r\ndivision into companies or an equipment like that for field service, and\r\nthat when it was thought expedient for the seniors to serve in centuries\r\nor cohorts, their enrolment in these companies is especially mentioned,\r\nour conviction that the senior centuries did not belong to the original\r\nServian organization grows into a certainty.[481]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Conclusions as to the Servian and Early Republican Organizations;\r\nTransition to the Manipular Legion_\r\n\r\nIn our search for the Servian and post-Servian schemes of military\r\norganization we found it necessary to eliminate from the discriptio\r\ncenturiarum all the centuries of pedites with the exception of the\r\njuniors. But even a military century of juniors could not have remained\r\nidentical with a voting century; for the former comprised a fixed number\r\nand the same for all ratings, whereas in the comitia of historical time\r\nthe centuries varied greatly in size, many of them containing far more\r\nthan a hundred men each. In the four lower classes each century contained\r\nas many men as the entire first class;[482] and individuals constantly\r\nshifted from one class to another as their several properties increased\r\nor diminished.[483] It is a mistake, therefore, to think of the army as\r\nidentical with even the junior centuries of the comitia.[484] Doubtless\r\nwhen the Servian army was first introduced, its organization was made\r\nto fit actual conditions, so that all who were liable to service found\r\ntheir place in it; but as the political assembly of centuries was\r\ninstituted many years afterward, the army with its various enlargements\r\ncould have kept meanwhile no more than approximate pace with the changing\r\npopulation, and at no time could it include the physically disqualified,\r\nwho nevertheless had a right to vote in the junior centuries of the\r\npolitical assembly. On the other hand there were soldiers in the army too\r\nyoung to be in the comitia centuriata.[485]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion as to the strength of the army in the first years of the\r\nrepublic, before the latter had acquired any considerable accession of\r\nterritory, corresponds closely with a moderate estimate of the population\r\nunder the conditions then existing. The area of the state was about 983\r\nsquare kilometers (equivalent to 379.5 sq. mi. or 242,899 acres).[486]\r\nEstimating the population of this agricultural community at its maximum\r\nof sixty to the square kilometer, we should have less than 60,000 for the\r\nentire area.[487] The number of men from seventeen to sixty, the Roman\r\nmilitary age, should be about thirty per cent of the population[488]—less\r\ntherefore than 18,000. If the ratio of juniors to seniors was about three\r\nto one,[489] we should have about 13,000 juniors to 5000 seniors. But a\r\ndeduction must be made for slaves and for the physically incapacitated,\r\nleaving perhaps 9000 or 10,000 juniors and 3000 or 4000 seniors. These\r\nresults are not unreasonable. Making allowance for several hundred\r\nsupernumeraries,[490] we should then have no more than enough juniors to\r\nfill the eighty-four centuries of foot and the six troops of horse. It is\r\nclear, therefore, that all available forces were included in the army and\r\nthat the junior centuries could not have contained more than a hundred\r\nmen each.\r\n\r\nEven before the phalanx had thus been brought to perfection,\r\nmodifications were being made in the equipment under the influence of the\r\nGallic invasion.[491] The introduction of pay, about 400 B.C., as has\r\nbeen said,[492] broke down the distinction of equipment based on degree\r\nof wealth, and not long afterward, probably in the time of the Samnite\r\nwars, the phalanx gave way to the manipular legion, which reached its\r\nfull development in the Punic wars.[493]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _The Five Classes and their Ratings_\r\n\r\nThough originally denoting the men of the first rating, who possessed the\r\nfullest equipment,[494] the term classis with an explanatory adjective\r\ncame to apply to the entire army[495] or to its component parts.[496] The\r\nplural “classes” came finally to mean the five census groups, represented\r\nby the five timocratic gradations of the comitia centuriata. What had\r\nformerly been the classis then came to be known as classis prima, and the\r\n“infra classem” ratings were numbered downward second, third, fourth,\r\nand fifth. Probably this extension in the use of the word was not made\r\ntill after the disappearance of the ratings from the army—how much later\r\nwe do not know. In a speech delivered in 169 in favor of the lex Voconia\r\nthe elder Cato more than once examined into the meaning of classicus\r\nand infra classem.[497] A hasty inference would be that at this late\r\ndate classis was still strictly limited to the first rating. It is to\r\nbe noted, however, that the early meaning might be retained in a legal\r\nformula long after it had disappeared from general use, that classicus\r\ncertainly preserved its original meaning notwithstanding the new\r\ndevelopment of the noun from which it is derived, and especially that the\r\nearly sense of the terms classicus and infra classem was not generally\r\nknown in 169, else Cato would not have taken such pains to define them.\r\nWe know that the ratings were termed classes in 111,[498] and from\r\nwhat has just been said on the Voconian law it seems probable that the\r\ndevelopment took place long before 169. The circumstance that in their\r\n“discriptio centuriarum” Livy and Dionysius make no reference to the\r\ndistinction between classis and infra classem would favor the supposition\r\nthat they found no such distinction in their common source—ultimately\r\nFabius Pictor. Hence it is not unlikely that classis was used in its\r\nhistorical meaning of property class in the censorial document from which\r\nFabius derived his knowledge of the fully developed comitia centuriata,\r\nand which belonged to the period immediately following 269.[499]\r\n\r\nBefore the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus, 312, military service\r\nwithin the census ratings was based on the possession of land, and\r\nthe gradations of equipment, while they lasted, must therefore have\r\nbeen determined by the size of the estate reckoned in iugera.[500]\r\nHuschke[501] rightly inferred that the number of iugera marking the\r\nlower limit of each division must have been proportioned to the later\r\nmoney ratings, and assumed accordingly 20, 15, 10, 5, 2½ or 2 iugera\r\nas the respective minimal holdings of the five divisions. Although\r\nabsolute certainty is unattainable, most scholars accept his conclusions\r\nas probable.[502] Before the change was made in the appraisements\r\nfrom amount of land to money, the census gradations ceased to serve a\r\nmilitary purpose. In the further discussion of these groups reference is\r\ntherefore solely to their political character, especially as expressed\r\nin the organization of the comitia centuriata. Till the time of Marius,\r\nhowever, the soldiers were ordinarily recruited from the classes—that is,\r\nfrom the citizens who possessed at least the qualification of the lowest\r\ngroup.[503]\r\n\r\nThe money ratings of 312 are not recorded; we know those only of the\r\ntime following 269. The ratings of the earlier date must have been in\r\nthe nominally libral asses then current. For a long time, probably down\r\nto 312, the _as_ remained at eleven to nine ounces in weight, then sank\r\nrapidly to four, three, and two ounces, reaching the last-mentioned\r\nweight in or shortly before 269. In this year or the following was\r\nlegally adopted the lighter _as_, weighing two ounces, or a sixth of a\r\npound, and hence termed sextantarian, and the heavier asses still in\r\ncirculation were henceforth reckoned as sesterces, which now became\r\nthe unit of value.[504] Two and a half sextantarian asses made a\r\nsesterce, and four sesterces made a denarius.[505] The _as_ continued\r\nto be copper, whereas the sesterce and the denarius were silver. In\r\nconsequence of the use of the sextantarian _as_ the ratings must have\r\nbeen elevated to correspond with the decline of the standard; and the\r\nresult of this change is the well-known series, 100,000, 75,000, 50,000,\r\n25,000, 11,000.[506] There can be no doubt that under the standard used\r\nin 312 the ratings were lower than those given. It is incredible that\r\nthe classis should ever have been appraised so high as 100,000 asses of\r\nten-ounce weight or even of the value of sesterces (5 oz.).[507] But\r\nthe ratings of 312 have not been definitely ascertained. Assuming but\r\none elevation between the two dates and in the proportion of 4:10::\r\nsextantarian _as_: heavy _as_ or sesterce, Mommsen[508] concludes that\r\nthe appraisements of 312 were 40,000, 30,000, 20,000, 10,000, and 4400\r\nasses respectively for the five classes. The adjustment however may have\r\nbeen gradual, as was the decline of the standard, and the former need not\r\nhave corresponded exactly with the latter. But in so far as the Romans\r\nfailed to bring about this adjustment, the censors must have found it\r\nnecessary continually to advance the citizens from the lower to the\r\nhigher divisions.\r\n\r\nThe ratings mentioned above as established on the basis of the\r\nsextantarian standard, namely 100,000, 75,000, 50,000, 25,000, and 11,000\r\nasses for the five classes respectively, are those given by Livy.[509]\r\nSeveral variations affecting the highest and lowest classes are offered\r\nby other writers. Dionysius[510] states the appraisement of the fifth\r\nclass at 12½ minae, which would be 12,500 asses. The usual explanation is\r\nthat he is dealing in round numbers without especial regard to accuracy,\r\nfor which reason Livy should be given the preference. It is doubtful\r\nhowever whether Dionysius was so inexact. More probably his estimate\r\ndepended ultimately on the idea that the minimal number of iugera of the\r\nhighest class was twenty-five,[511] taken in connection with the decimal\r\nratio between the extreme classes—an interpretation which would help\r\nexplain variations in the rating of the highest class to be mentioned\r\nhereafter; or with less reason we might assume that the statements of\r\nDionysius and Livy represent earlier and later conditions.[512] The\r\nlimit of 400 drachmas given by Polybius[513] proves a lowering of the\r\nminimal rating between 269 and the publication of his history.[514] It\r\nmay have been made in 217, when the money system was again changed. As\r\nPolybius probably considered the drachma, or denarius, to be worth ten\r\nasses,[515] the limit which he mentions would be 4000 asses. Cicero\r\nstates the minimal limit at 1500 asses,[516] and a still lower sum of\r\n375, mentioned by Gellius,[517] marked the line of division between the\r\ntaxable proletarians and the capite censi, who were exempt from taxation.\r\nAs the differentiation between the two groups last named must have been\r\neffected before 167, when the Romans were relieved of the tributum,[518]\r\nthe rating given by Cicero could not have been later than that vouched\r\nfor by Polybius. The limit of 4000 asses, accordingly, had reference\r\nmerely to military service, whereas 1500 marked at once the political\r\nand tributary line of separation between the fifth class and the taxable\r\nproletarians.[519] The limit of 375 asses, on the other hand, was far\r\nbelow the fifth class, and had nothing to do with it.[520] The relation\r\nof these numbers to one another may be summarized as follows: Those\r\nassessed at 4000 or more asses belonged to the fifth class, enjoyed the\r\npolitical rights of that class, and were subject to military service\r\nas well as to taxation (tributum); those rated at 1500-4000 asses also\r\nbelonged to the fifth class, enjoyed the political rights of that class,\r\nand were subject to taxation but exempt from military service; those\r\nrated at 375-1500 asses were proletarians, below the fifth class but\r\nsubject to taxation; those rated below 375 asses, the capite censi, were\r\nexempt from taxation.\r\n\r\nAs regards the rating of the highest class, the elder Pliny[521] states\r\nit at 110,000 asses, which may be a copyist’s error for 100,000 or\r\nfor 120,000; the estimate of Paulus Diaconus[522] is 120,000 and of\r\nGellius[523] 125,000. If the manuscripts have correctly preserved these\r\nnumbers, they may represent computations based on a varying number of\r\niugera, from twenty-two to twenty-five[524] at the rate of 5000 asses a\r\niugerum—a valuation which may have been given in the original annalistic\r\nsource (Fabius Pictor). From the fact that Pliny assigns this rating to\r\nServius as author, and that Gellius speaks of it in the past, we must\r\ninfer that it was not due to a relatively late change. Indeed the rating\r\nmust have remained unaltered to the time of Polybius,[525] who states\r\nthat those appraised at 10,000 drachmas wore the cuirass—according to\r\nLivy[526] and Dionysius,[527] the distinctive equipment of the first\r\nclass.[528] In the same age the Voconian law, 169, provided that a\r\nman registered by the censors as worth 100,000 asses or more should\r\nnot bequeath his property to a woman.[529] While speaking in favor\r\nof the measure the elder Cato expounded the distinction between the\r\nclassici and those who were “infra classem.”[530] Strictly following\r\nCato’s definition, Gellius[531] explains the classici as those of the\r\nfirst class in contrast with the members of the lower classes, who are\r\ninfra classem. Evidently the classici are to be identified with those\r\nrated at 100,000 asses, as given by Gaius.[532] The sum of 100,000\r\nsesterces, in place of asses, represented by later writers[533] as\r\nthe one fixed by this law, is due either to a late interpretation or\r\nto an amendment.[534] The minimal qualification of the first class\r\nmust therefore have continued unchanged from 269 to the passing of the\r\nVoconian law, 169, and the composition of the _History_ of Polybius.[535]\r\nFrom the latter event to the tribuneship of Tiberius Gracchus little\r\ntime was left for an increase, which certainly the Gracchi and their\r\nsuccessors would take no interest in bringing about. Further depreciation\r\nin the weight of the _as_, by the reduction to a half ounce through the\r\nPapirian law of 89,[536] had no effect on the valuation, as the standard\r\nwas the silver sesterce, the _as_ having merely the fiduciary value of a\r\nquarter sesterce. Apart from the accounts of Livy and Dionysius already\r\nconsidered, no reference is made to the valuation of the intermediate\r\nclasses, unless it be a passage in Livy[537] to the effect that freedmen\r\npossessing country estates worth at least 30,000 sesterces were enrolled\r\nin the rural tribes by the censors of 169, which is interpreted by\r\nMommsen[538] to refer to the qualification of the second class. This is\r\ntrue if, as has been assumed above, the censors still reckoned two and a\r\nhalf asses to the sesterce.[539]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. _Belot’s Theory as to the Ratings_\r\n\r\nNotice must be taken of a theory proposed by Belot,[540] that at the time\r\nof the First Punic War, owing to an economic revolution which enhanced\r\nprices, and to the decrease in the weight of the _as_, the five ratings\r\nas stated by Dionysius for the earlier period were multiplied by ten,\r\ngiving for the future 1,000,000, 750,000, 500,000, 250,000, 125,000 asses\r\nfor the five classes respectively.[541] The theory is supported with\r\nremarkable learning and skill. There can be no doubt as to the lowering\r\nof the weight of the _as_ or of the economic revolution which increased\r\nprices. Large valuations of estates such as he mentions are found in the\r\nsources. For example in 214 the government ordered[542] that—\r\n\r\n    Those rated at  50,000-  100,000 asses should furnish one sailor.\r\n    Those rated at 100,000-  300,000 asses should furnish three sailors.\r\n    Those rated at 300,000-1,000,000 asses should furnish five sailors.\r\n    Those rated at above   1,000,000 asses should furnish seven sailors.\r\n                 Senators                  should furnish eight sailors.\r\n\r\nBelot’s attempt to identify the highest of these appraisements with the\r\nrating of the first class is unsuccessful, as will immediately appear.\r\nThe object of the order issued by the government in 214 was to provide\r\ncrews for the fleet of that year. Although the hundred and fifty ships\r\nto be manned[543] seem to have been triremes, we may consider them\r\nquinqueremes so as not to underestimate the number of men necessary.\r\nReckoning 375 men to the ship,[544] we should have 56,250 men for the\r\nentire fleet. But according to Belot[545] there were 22,000 knights at\r\nthis time, whose census rating was 1,000,000 asses, and who accordingly\r\nwould have to furnish seven men each for the navy, which would amount to\r\n154,000, or more than enough to man three such fleets as that of the year\r\nunder consideration. But as the knights constituted only a twelfth of the\r\ntotal number of registered citizens of that period,[546] most if not all\r\nof whom must according to Belot have been assessed at 50,000 or above,\r\nwe shall be obliged at least to double the 154,000 sailors furnished by\r\nthe knights to obtain the whole number demanded by the government. The\r\nabsurdity of the result condemns the premises. The minimal census of the\r\nknight could not have been materially if at all above 100,000 asses,[547]\r\nand the great mass of citizens must have been rated below that sum. Other\r\nfeatures of his theory need not be considered here. The truth is that\r\nthe great accumulation of wealth benefited but few; and notwithstanding\r\nthe advance in the money value of property, the mass of people remained\r\nso poor that the state could not disturb the census ratings, however\r\nout of harmony with the new conditions they seem to have become. No\r\nsuspicion should be thrown on the continuance of these small valuations\r\nby the circumstance that occasionally the state compelled the wealthy to\r\ncontribute to the burden of war according to their ability, as in 214,\r\nand increased the penalties for the crimes and misdemeanors which the\r\nrich and powerful were wont to commit.[548]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. _The Post-Servian Equites_\r\n\r\nThe classes, as developed after Servius, have now been considered\r\nsufficiently for an appreciation of their relation to the comitia\r\ncenturiata. It remains to discuss from the same point of view the\r\npost-Servian alterations in the equestrian organization.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest period when the warriors in general equipped themselves\r\nat their own expense,[549] the equites provided their own horses. But\r\nin time as the patricians ceased to be the only wealthy class in the\r\ncommunity, and as they began to lose their political advantages, their\r\nduty of keeping one or two horses came to be felt as onerous, and some\r\nmeans of lightening it was sought for. The only private property which\r\nwas free from the burden of supporting military service was that of\r\nwidows and orphans. The government determined accordingly to levy a\r\nregular contribution on this class of estates in the interest of the\r\nequites. The eques was allowed ten thousand asses, or one thousand\r\ndenarii (aes equestre), with which to purchase his horse or horses for\r\nthe ten years of service and two thousand asses (aes hordearium) annually\r\nfor maintenance.[550] He was not paid the money in advance, but was given\r\nsecurity for the required sums,[551] which were gradually to be made\r\ngood from the special kind of tax here described. When these equestrian\r\nfunds were first granted cannot be absolutely determined. Cicero[552]\r\nassigns their institution to Tarquinius Priscus, Livy[553] to Servius,\r\nPlutarch[554] to Camillus in the year of his censorship, 377. For obvious\r\nreasons the earlier dates are suspicious, whereas the last has the\r\nadvantage of connecting the institution of these funds with the general\r\nmovement for the public support of military service. When in the war with\r\nVeii regular military pay was introduced, the eques on account of his\r\nmore burdensome duty, perhaps too because of his higher rank, was allowed\r\nthree times the pay of the legionary.[555] It was afterward decided to\r\ndeduct the aes hordearium, probably also the aes equestre, from his\r\npay.[556] Meanwhile as wars were waged on an ever increasing scale, the\r\npatricians, who were dwindling in number, could not furnish all the\r\ncavalry needed. This want was especially felt in the struggle with Veii,\r\nwhereupon wealthy plebeian youths[557] came forward and offered to serve\r\nwith their own horses.[558] This is the first known instance of voluntary\r\nequestrian duty, doubtless often repeated at crises during the remainder\r\nof the republican period. In the first case at least the state provided\r\nfor the keep of the horses. The volunteers were of the same grade of\r\nwealth as the conscripts; they were held in equal honor,[559] and most\r\nprobably their years of voluntary service were counted in with their\r\nregular duty in making up the required number.[560] Service equo privato\r\ncould also be imposed as a punishment. The only known instance, however,\r\nwas that required by the censors of 209 of the equites who had disgraced\r\nthemselves at Cannae. Their horses were taken from them, their campaigns\r\nequo publico were not counted to their credit, but they were required\r\nto serve ten years equis privatis.[561] These are the only instances\r\nof service with private horses mentioned in history. In all ancient\r\nliterature is no suggestion that the equites equo privato formed a rank\r\nby themselves or were an institution.[562] It should also be said that\r\nthe injustice of furnishing some with horses and of compelling others to\r\ngo to war at their own expense, unless by way of punishment, was contrary\r\nto the spirit of the constitution. This conclusion is supported by the\r\nelder Pliny’s[563] definition of the military equites, which makes the\r\npublic horse an essential. From the time therefore when the state began\r\nto support the mounted service in the way described above, the equites\r\nequis publicis continued to be the only regular citizen horsemen.\r\n\r\nThe number of equites with public horses is approximately determined for\r\nany time by the number of legions then enrolled. The Servian phalanx,\r\nas has been noted,[564] consisted of two legions, which remained the\r\nnormal number through the fifth century. But in the wars with Samnium\r\nand Pyrrhus Rome was able regularly to support four legions.[565] The\r\nmilitary force could not have been doubled before the incorporation of\r\nthe Veientan territory early in the fourth century;[566] most probably\r\nthe enlargement belongs to still later time. The increase in the\r\ninfantry required a corresponding enlargement of the mounted service. At\r\nleast twelve hundred equites were henceforth required for active duty.\r\nMaking allowance for reserves and ineffectives, the government raised\r\nthe number of equites equo publico to eighteen hundred. The twelve new\r\ncenturies were open alike to patricians and plebeians, whereas the old\r\nsix remained for a time exclusively patrician. This seems to have been\r\nthe condition at the opening of the first war with Carthage. During the\r\nPunic wars the number varied greatly, sometimes reaching a total of\r\nmore than five thousand in the field, not counting reserves.[567] After\r\nthe war with Hannibal the state, drained of men and money, allowed the\r\ncavalry to dwindle.[568] Viewing this condition with alarm, the elder\r\nCato[569] urged that the number should be increased, and that a minimal\r\nlimit be fixed at 2200. Probably at the same time he proposed that the\r\nlegion should be strengthened. His measure must have been adopted, for\r\nafter his censorship we find the legion regularly consisting of 5200\r\nfoot and 300 horse.[570] Under Augustus there were times when 5000\r\nequites[571] equo publico took part in the parade which he revived.[572]\r\nAs no reason can be found why Augustus should suddenly increase this\r\nclass, we must conclude that there were probably about 5000 equites equo\r\npublico in the late republic.\r\n\r\nAs long as the cavalry remained exclusively patrician, a census\r\nqualification was precluded. Though Cicero and Livy refer the equestrian\r\ncensus to Servius Tullius, their vagueness on this point shows that they\r\nlacked definite information.[573] It must have been introduced at the\r\ntime when the patriciate ceased to be an essential qualification, when\r\nthe levy came to be made on the basis of wealth rather than of blood.\r\nThis change should be assigned to the early part of the fourth century\r\nB.C.[574] For a time the census was that of the first class.[575] In\r\n214 it was still 100,000 asses, or not much above, as has already been\r\nproved.[576] In the late republic and under the emperors the minimal\r\nrating was 400,000 sesterces.[577] When it was raised to this amount is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n    I.

Those given in answer to prayer were\r\nimpetrativa (or impetrita), those sent unasked oblativa. The first were\r\nnecessarily favorable; the second might be either favorable or the\r\ncontrary.[578] To take or to hold auspices was to seek such signs in due\r\nform. Auspicia, or the singular auspicium, also designated the right or\r\nthe power to perform the function. They were not a means of prophecy of\r\nfuture events but of ascertaining whether the deity approved a proposed\r\naction.[579] With reference to their object and to the persons qualified\r\nto take them, they were of two kinds, private and public. Whereas the\r\npublic auspices, taken in behalf of the state, belonged exclusively\r\nto magistrates, the private were open to all;[580] and in early\r\ntimes a Roman always resorted to them before beginning any important\r\nbusiness.[581] Though it was permissible to consult any deity,[582] the\r\ngreatest weight attached to the approval of the supreme god Jupiter.[583]\r\n\r\nThe plebeians, who as long as they were excluded from the magistracies\r\nwere necessarily debarred from the auspicia publica, enjoyed equally with\r\nthe patricians all private rights of religion; in fact if the nobles\r\nhad wished, they possessed no legal means of preventing the holding of\r\nauspices or the performance of any other sacred rite in private plebeian\r\nhouses. Not only is it stated that all had a right to auspicate,[584]\r\nbut the formula for summoning troops given by Cincius[585] implies that\r\nthe soldiers, who were mainly plebeian, were accustomed to perform the\r\nrite. We find accordingly the elder Cato, a plebeian, attending to the\r\nceremony in his own home.[586] The patricians, however, who believed\r\nthemselves to be nearer and dearer to the gods than were the plebeians,\r\nand who in their struggle to keep themselves a closed caste and the\r\noffices barred against the lower social class, declared that conubium\r\nif granted would disturb the private as well as public auspices.[587]\r\nBut this assertion need not signify that the plebeians had no private\r\nauspices, it might indicate merely a difference between the plebeian\r\nand patrician ceremonies, naturally implying the superiority of the\r\nlatter. Again when on a certain occasion according to Livy a tribune\r\nof the plebs inquired of a patrician why a plebeian could not be made\r\nconsul, the reply was that no plebeian had the auspices, reiterating that\r\nthe decemvirs had forbidden conubium to prevent the disturbance of the\r\nceremony by uncertainty of birth.[588] Reference might here be simply\r\nto the auspicia publica, with which alone the consul was concerned.\r\nHowever this may be, the patrician claim was indignantly repudiated\r\nby the plebeians, and the historian can say no more than that it was\r\n“perhaps true.” Another passage from Livy usually interpreted in support\r\nof the theory that the patricians alone had private auspices represents\r\nthem, before the opening of the offices to the commons, as saying, “So\r\npeculiar to us are the auspices that not only the patrician magistrates\r\nwhom the people choose are elected under the auspices, but we ourselves\r\nunder the sanction of the same rite without a vote of the people appoint\r\nthe interrex, and we as private persons hold auspices, which they do not\r\nhold even as magistrates.”[589] This passage is perfectly intelligible\r\nto one who bears in mind that in the late republic private auspices had\r\ndisappeared,[590] and that therefore when the word auspicia is used\r\nwithout qualification by a late republican or imperial writer, it always\r\nhas reference to the public ceremonies.[591] In the quotation just given,\r\naccordingly, nothing more is meant than that the patricians, who have the\r\nexclusive right to the offices, are alone competent to perform the public\r\nreligious ceremonies which belong to the magistrates. Reference in the\r\nquotation to the auspices of private persons signifies that when there\r\nwas no magistrate competent to hold the election of consuls, the public\r\nauspices returned to the senate, the patrician members of which proceeded\r\nunder auspication to appoint an interrex for holding the elections. In\r\nthis case the senatorial patricians, it was asserted, attended to the\r\nceremony not as magistrates but as private persons, though the rites were\r\nthemselves public. As distinguished from magistrates, the senators were\r\nprivati. It was not, then, as mere citizens but as patrician members of\r\nthe senate that they performed the rite. Further light is thrown on this\r\nsubject by the fact that in the agitation for the opening of the augural\r\nand pontifical colleges to the plebeians in 300, the patricians repeated\r\nthe assertion that with them alone were auspices, they alone had family\r\n(gens), they alone possessed true imperium and auspicium in peace and\r\nwar.[592] This claim they had the effrontery to make despite the fact\r\nthat plebeian consuls had been taking public auspices for more than\r\nsixty years. In the pride of their blood they claimed that theirs alone\r\nwere strictly legal (iustum). Notwithstanding such partisan assertions\r\nthe facts thus far adduced lead unmistakably to the conclusion that\r\nthe plebeians equally with the patricians enjoyed the right to private\r\nauspices.[593]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Auspicia Publica Impetrativa_\r\n\r\nThe right to public auspices belonged primarily to patrician\r\nmagistracies[594]—those which in the early republic were filled only by\r\npatricians, but which continued to be called patrician after they were\r\nopen to plebeians. All elections and appointments to such offices were\r\nauspicated;[595] and their incumbents were expected to seek the previous\r\napproval of Jupiter for every important act of their administration.[596]\r\nThe king, interrex, dictator, consuls, praetors, and censors had the\r\nauspicia maxima; the others the minora.[597] The praetor, as colleague\r\nof the consuls, was elected under the same auspices with them, that is,\r\nin the same meeting of the assembly, whereas the censors, not being\r\ncolleagues of the consuls, were elected under different auspices.\r\nBetween magistrates who were not colleagues there could be no collision\r\nin the auspicia impetrativa; those of the censors neither strengthened\r\nnor vitiated those of the consuls or praetors, nor were strengthened\r\nor vitiated by them. In case of a conflict between colleagues, the\r\ngreater auspices annulled the lesser, and equal auspices annulled each\r\nother.[598] For the exercise of a function properly belonging to a\r\nmagistracy, the incumbent performed the ceremony at his own will and\r\npleasure, unless expressly forbidden by a superior;[599] but one who\r\nundertook a deputed duty had to ask the auspicium of a magistrate who\r\nwas competent to perform the duty in his own right. Thus the quaestor,\r\nwho was not qualified by right of his office to call the comitia\r\ncenturiata, found it necessary to do so in his capital prosecutions.\r\nIn such a case he asked of the praetor or consul the right to hold\r\nauspices for summoning this assembly.[600] Whether the pontifex maximus\r\nheld auspices in his own name, or was obliged, like the quaestor, to\r\napply for them to a higher secular official, is unknown; at all events\r\nit was necessary for him to auspicate the comitia calata, over which he\r\npresided.[601] It seems probable that the tribunes originally did not\r\nhave the right as they were not magistrates; but when they came to be\r\nso considered, they acquired the auspicium. All magistrates—necessarily\r\nincluding the tribunes—who convoked the senate had previously to perform\r\nthe ceremony;[602] Cicero[603] seems to include the tribunes among\r\nthe magistrates who had the auspicium; and as further proof the very\r\nexpression “patriciorum (magistratuum) auspicia”[604] used by Messala\r\nimplies the existence of “plebeiorum magistratuum auspicia.” It was not\r\nthe custom of the tribunes, however, to auspicate their assemblies of the\r\nplebs.[605]\r\n\r\nFor assistance in auspication the magistrate summoned any person he\r\npleased, who was rarely if ever a public augur.[606] An augur,[607]\r\nwhether private or official, was a person who knew how to hold and to\r\ninterpret auspices.[608] A college of public augurs[609] for the service\r\nof the state was established in the most primitive times. Probably\r\ncomprising three members, one from each tribe, it was gradually increased\r\ntill under Sulla it reached fifteen.[610] The members of the college were\r\nneither magistrates[611] nor prophets. They were rather the wise,[612]\r\nexperienced[613] keepers and expounders of a sacred science and\r\nart[614]—the “interpreters of Jupiter All-Great and Good.”[615] Having\r\nto do with religion, they were sacerdotes, like the pontiffs, though not\r\nofferers of sacrifice (flamines).[616] The functions which they exercised\r\nindependently of the magistrates included the inauguration of religious\r\nofficials (inaugurare sacerdotes), the blessing of fields twice a year,\r\nand of the people after the close of a war.[617] In attending to such\r\nduties (auguria) only did they exercise their right to the auspices.[618]\r\nIn a dependent though far more influential position they acted as the\r\nprofessionally skilled advisers and assistants of the magistrates in\r\nall matters of peace and war.[619] If a magistrate was not himself an\r\naugur,[620] it was of the utmost importance to have their service;\r\nfor the science of discovering and interpreting the divine omens was\r\nintricate, mistakes were easy, and the slightest oversight might vitiate\r\nthe whole business in hand. When in doubt as to the validity of the\r\nceremony, either the magistrate to whom it belonged or the senate could\r\nrefer the case to the college of augurs, which thereupon gave an opinion\r\nin the form of a decree. The senate then acted on the matter according\r\nto its judgment.[621] In case a law had been passed, a magistrate\r\nelected, or any public act performed against its wishes, it could\r\ninquire of the college of augurs whether the election or other act had\r\nbeen duly auspicated; and should a defect be alleged, the senate could\r\nannul the act or request the magistrate to resign. It required unusual\r\ncourage in a man to keep himself in office in defiance of the authority\r\nof the senate and of the religious feeling of the whole people.[622]\r\nThese considerations account for the great importance attaching to the\r\npresence of augurs in the comitia—a subject to be treated in another\r\nconnection.[623]\r\n\r\nThe service of augurs was most needed in establishing the terrestrial\r\ntemplum[624]—a carefully marked out, oriented spot which the magistrate\r\noccupied while performing the rite.[625] Whereas the commander of an\r\narmy generally made use of chicken auspices (signa ex tripudiis), which\r\ndid not require their assistance,[626] they were doubtless always\r\ncalled upon to institute templa in or near the city.[627] For the\r\nexercise of their art they divided the world, so far as known to them,\r\ninto augural districts. The central district was the city, limited\r\nby the pomerium,[628] beyond which, probably extending to the first\r\nmilestone,[629] lay a zone termed ager effatus,[630] whose boundaries\r\nwere marked by cippi.[631] The rest of the world within their sphere\r\nof knowledge they divided into ager Romanus, which in its larger sense\r\nincluded the two districts above mentioned, Gabinus, peregrinus,\r\nhosticus, and incertus.[632] For the comitia the two inner regions\r\nwere alone important: (1) the auspication of assemblies held in the\r\ncity had to be performed within the pomerium; (2) as often as the\r\nmagistrate in passing from the city to the Campus Martius to hold the\r\ncomitia centuriata crossed the pomerium,[633] or more strictly the brook\r\nPetronia,[634] he was obliged to take the special auspices of crossing.\r\nBeyond the ager effatus assemblies were not ordinarily held.\r\n\r\nOriginally the most common form of divination must have been the\r\nwatching of the flight of birds, for it is from this ceremony that\r\nthe word auspicium is derived.[635] Legend accordingly asserts that\r\nRomulus founded the city on the Palatine under the auspices of twelve\r\nvultures.[636] Before the end of the republic, however, all other\r\nforms of public auspicia impetrativa in the city had given way to the\r\ncaelestia, especially the lightning and thunder.[637] The reason is that\r\nthe heavenly signs could be most easily understood and carried greatest\r\nweight; whereas other auspices had to be held for each individual act,\r\nthe celestial omens of the morning served the magistrate for all his\r\nundertakings during the entire day.[638] The effect of heavenly signs on\r\nassemblies of the people, however, was peculiar. Not only were comitia\r\nand contiones interrupted by storms;[639] not only was it impious to hold\r\nan assembly while it was lightning or thundering,[640] but even while the\r\nmagistrate was auspicating at daybreak, if a flash of lightning appeared\r\non the left—a sign favorable for every other undertaking—he dared not\r\nhold the assembly on that day.[641] Some favorable comitial sign the\r\nmagistrate was supposed to perceive,[642] but what it was we do not know.\r\n\r\nThe general rule that the auspices should be taken for an act on the very\r\nspot on which the magistrate intended to perform the act applied to the\r\ncomitial auspices. For meetings on the Capitoline Hill they probably used\r\nthe temple of Jupiter, dedicated for all time;[643] for assemblies in the\r\ncomitium the rostra, also a templum;[644] and for the comitia centuriata\r\nthe president’s platform in the Campus Martius.[645] Not only patrician\r\nmagistrates but also tribunes of the plebs occupied templa in transacting\r\nbusiness with the people.[646]\r\n\r\nBetween midnight and morning[647] on the day of assembly the magistrate\r\nrepaired to the templum.[648] There, placing himself on a solid[649] seat\r\nat the door, usually facing eastward, he watched the heavens (spectio).\r\nMeanwhile he first asked the attendant, who always sat near,[650]\r\nwhether there was silence.[651] If the answer was affirmative, he\r\nprayed Jupiter for a sign, which he described in a formula termed legum\r\ndictio,[652] whereupon the attendant declared he saw it.[653] In case\r\nof non-appearance of the sign or of a disturbance of the observation,\r\nthe auspication was deferred to another morning.[654] Before the time\r\nof Cicero, however, the ceremony had been so reduced to a pretence as\r\npractically to eliminate the possibility of failure.[655]\r\n\r\nBoth curiate[656] and centuriate[657] assemblies were auspicated.\r\nAlthough for the tribal assemblies the question is more difficult, it\r\nseems reasonably certain that whereas a patrician magistrate took the\r\nauspices for the comitia tributa,[658] plebeian magistrates (tribunes and\r\naediles of the plebs) did not.[659]\r\n\r\nAs to whether contiones were auspicated we are not clearly informed. The\r\nquestion concerns those only which were held by patrician magistrates.\r\nThe auspication of comitia necessarily extended to the contio immediately\r\npreceding.[660] It is known, too, that the censors auspicated the\r\nlustral gathering of the centuries,[661] hence we may infer that\r\nmagistrates and sacerdotes were accustomed to take auspices for formal\r\nreligious assemblies.[662] With these exceptions contiones were doubtless\r\nheld without auspices by patrician as well as by plebeian magistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Auspicia Publica Oblativa_\r\n\r\nIf Jupiter had approved the holding of an assembly, the magistrate\r\nwas not for that reason necessarily done with auspices. Though the\r\nimpetrativa may have favored, prohibitive oblativa were still possible,\r\nfor circumstances might cause the god to change his mind so as to forbid\r\nwhat he had previously sanctioned; and the warning omen might come at\r\nany time before the act was completed. Sometimes the magistrate himself\r\ndiscovered, or for the accomplishment of his purpose pretended to\r\ndiscover, the evil omen. When for instance Pompey was holding an assembly\r\nfor the election of praetors, and Cato, a political opponent, offered\r\nhimself as a candidate, Pompey, seeing the assembly unanimous for this\r\nman, declared that he heard a clap of thunder, and thus by an adjournment\r\nsucceeded in preventing the election.[663] Sometimes the magistrate\r\nwas informed of the omen by (1) a private person, (2) an augur, or\r\n(3) another magistrate. In the first two cases the report was termed\r\nnuntiatio, in the third obnuntiatio.[664] Information received from a\r\nprivate citizen the president could credit or not as he saw fit, or he\r\ncould declare it irrelevant;[665] but the law compelled him to accept the\r\nnuntiatio of an augur or the obnuntiatio of another magistrate.\r\n\r\nProhibitive auspicia oblativa included evil omens of all kinds. When\r\nin 310 the dictator called the curiae for passing the lex de imperio,\r\nit chanced that the Curia Faucia was the first to vote (principium).\r\nNow this curia was ill omened because on two earlier occasions it had\r\nhappened to be principium at a time of great national disaster. The\r\ndictator accordingly adjourned the meeting till the following day, when\r\nhe again summoned it after renewing the auspicia impetrativa.[666] A\r\ncase of epilepsy, by vitiating the business of the assembly, required\r\nan adjournment; and for that reason the malady was called the comitial\r\nsickness.[667] In the later republic the chief oblativa had come to be\r\ncaelestia; and it could happen that the auspicia impetrativa of any\r\nmagistrate might as oblativa vitiate the comitia of another. For this\r\nreason when a higher magistrate was about to hold an assembly, he forbade\r\nthe taking of auspices by all inferior to him, for fear they might annul\r\nhis proceedings.[668]\r\n\r\nAlthough the augurs had neither the auspicia impetrativa nor the right\r\nto watch the sky for unfavorable omens,[669] they were competent to\r\nreport (nuntiatio) unexpected oblativa to the magistrates.[670] Their\r\nobject in attending the comitia accordingly was not only to assist the\r\npresident with their special knowledge,[671] but also to witness the\r\nreligious legality of the proceeding. In the latter function the augur\r\nderived great influence[672] from the possibility of an investigation\r\ninto such legality by the augural college and the senate, which might\r\nresult in the annulment of the act.[673] For this reason witnessing\r\naugurs were granted the privilege of adjourning the assembly in case they\r\nperceived unfavorable omens.[674] Cicero[675] describes in detail such an\r\nadjournment of an electoral assembly of centuries: “Behold the day for\r\nthe election of Dolabella! The prerogative century is drawn by lot, he\r\n(the augur) remains quiet. The vote is announced, he is silent. The first\r\nclass is called and the announcement made. Then as usual the suffragia\r\n(of the equites?) were summoned; then the second class is called. All\r\nthis happened more quickly than I have told it.\r\n\r\n“When the business is over, that excellent augur says, ‘We adjourn to\r\nanother day.’ O remarkable impudence! What (omen) had you seen? What had\r\nyou felt? What had you heard?” Antony, who was both consul and augur,\r\npresiding over the electoral assembly, allowed the voting to continue\r\ntill a majority was nearly reached in favor of Dolabella, when, making\r\nuse of the augural formula, he adjourned the meeting. This procedure was\r\nin itself legal; but Antony had from the beginning of the year boasted\r\nof his intention to prevent through augury this man’s election. As\r\nonly magistrates, through their right to the spectio, to be explained\r\nhereafter, could with certainty predict an evil omen,[676] it was evident\r\nthat Antony, acting merely as augur, made a fictitious report.\r\n\r\nAugurs were always present at meetings of the curiae,[677] of the\r\ncenturies,[678] and of the tribes under the presidency of a patrician\r\nmagistrate.[679] That they attended the meetings of the plebs as well\r\nand had the same relation to the plebeian as to the other assemblies\r\nis necessarily implied in Cicero’s[680] question, “What shows greater\r\nreligious power than to be able to grant or refuse to grant the right to\r\ntransact business with the people or with the plebs?”\r\n\r\nIf the person who reported the evil omen was not an augur but a\r\nmagistrate, the president was equally bound to heed it and to dismiss\r\nthe assembly;[681] and the force of the obnuntiatio was not in any way\r\naffected by the relative official rank of the two persons concerned.\r\nWhen accordingly a higher magistrate had set a day for an assembly,\r\nhe forbade all inferior magistrates not only to take the auspicia\r\nimpetrativa,[682] but also to watch the sky—de caelo servare—for any\r\npurpose on that day, for fear that some omen unfavorable to the comitia\r\nmight be seen.[683] A consul for instance could prevent a quaestor from\r\nscanning the heavens on any particular day; and the senate on the rare\r\noccasions when it felt itself sufficiently strong, suspended for a\r\nparticular act of the assembly the right of all magistrates to receive\r\nand to announce unfavorable omens.[684] In the absence of senatorial\r\ninterference it remained possible for any higher magistrate to scan the\r\nheavens—de caelo servare—on an assembly day appointed by another, and to\r\nvitiate the comitia by reporting an unfavorable omen. We find accordingly\r\na consul obnuntiating against a colleague[685] and against the pontifex\r\nmaximus,[686] a praetor against a tribune of the plebs,[687] and a\r\ntribune against a consul[688] or a censor,[689] as well as against a\r\ncolleague.[690]\r\n\r\nSo certain was it that a magistrate who looked for a bad omen would\r\nsee one that the expression “to watch the sky” became equivalent to\r\ndiscovering an unpropitious sign. The rule was therefore formulated\r\nthat “religion forbade the transaction of any business with the people\r\nwhen it was known that the sky was watched.”[691] If accordingly a\r\nmagistrate announced that he intended to scan the heavens on the day\r\nappointed for an assembly, this declaration was in itself sufficient in\r\nthe ordinary course of events to compel a postponement. In the year 57\r\nMilo, a tribune of the plebs, pushed the custom to extremes by declaring\r\nhis intention to observe the sky on all comitial days.[692] Strictly the\r\nobservation had to be made and reported before the assembly met. “Can\r\nany one divine beforehand,” Cicero[693] asks, “what defect there will be\r\nin the auspices, except the man who has already determined to watch the\r\nheavens? This in the first place the law forbids to be done in the time\r\nof an assembly; and if any one has been observing the sky, he is bound\r\nto give notice of it, not after the comitia are assembled, but before\r\nthey meet.” In the case belonging to the year 57 referred to above,\r\nMilo, the tribune, came into the Campus Martius before midnight in order\r\nto anticipate the arrival of the consul Metellus, who wished to hold\r\nthe elections. The assembly ordinarily met at sunrise, and could not\r\nconvene after midday. Milo accordingly remained on that day till noon,\r\nwithout seeing the consul. Then Metellus demanded that for the future the\r\nobnuntiatio should be served on him in the Forum; it was unnecessary,\r\nhe said, to go to the Campus before daybreak; he promised to be in the\r\ncomitium at the first hour of the day. As Milo was coming into the Forum\r\nbefore sunrise on the next comitial day, he discovered Metellus stealing\r\nhurriedly to the Campus by an unusual route. The tribune came upon him\r\nand served the notice.[694]\r\n\r\nThe consul’s announcement of intention to watch the sky might be\r\nstrengthened by a proclamation declaring certain or all comitial days for\r\nthe remainder of the year to be holidays, on which the people could not\r\nlegally transact business in assembly.[695]\r\n\r\nAlthough the obnuntiatio doubtless originated in the early republic,\r\nit played no considerable part in political strife till after the\r\nGracchi. A great impetus to the abuse of the power was given by the\r\nAelian and Fufian laws, which were probably two plebiscites[696] passed\r\nabout 150.[697] What features of these statutes were new has not been\r\nprecisely determined. It is certain, however, that they made possible\r\nthe condition in which we find the spectio and obnuntiatio before the\r\nlegislation of Clodius on the subject in 58. As the tribune did not\r\noriginally have the obnuntiatio, we may infer that in all probability\r\nthese laws granted him the right to exercise it against patrician\r\nmagistrates in the way described above. Similarly from the fact that\r\nthe plebeian tribal assembly was not originally subject to religious\r\nobstruction on the part of the government, it is reasonable to conclude\r\nthat the Aelian and Fufian statutes gave the patrician magistrates the\r\nobnuntiatio against that body.[698] It was equivalent to a power of veto,\r\nwhich the aristocracy could now exercise upon tribunician legislation,\r\nhence Cicero[699] regards the two statutes as most holy[700] means of\r\n“weakening and repressing the fury of the tribunes,” and as the “surest\r\nprotection of the commonwealth.”[701] Notwithstanding the opinion of\r\nLange,[702] that the obnuntiatio was restricted to legislation, it\r\nseems clear from the words of Cicero,[703] as well as from the lack of\r\nreference in the sources to such a limitation, that it applied equally\r\nto elections. So long, however, as the nobility could depend for support\r\nupon the tribunes, it had little need of such a power. But in the last\r\nyears of the republic, after the tribunician veto had been undermined by\r\nTi. Gracchus and Appuleius Saturninus, and the tribunes were again acting\r\nindependently of the senate as in the early history of their office,\r\noptimates and populares, taking full advantage of the Aelian and Fufian\r\nlaws, alike exploited the auspices recklessly for partisan objects. Their\r\nbehavior was a sign of both religious and political disintegration.\r\nVatinius, tribune of the plebs in 59, had the boldness utterly to\r\ndisregard these statutes;[704] and in 58 the tribune Clodius repealed\r\nthem in so far as they affected legislation,[705] whereas for elections\r\nthe obnuntiatio still remained in force.[706] The misuse of auspices for\r\npolitical purposes dates back, according to Livy,[707] to the beginning\r\nof the Samnite wars. Although this may be an anticipation of later\r\nconditions, there can be no doubt as to the attitude of statesmen toward\r\nthe custom in the closing years of the Punic wars.[708] In the time of\r\nClodius and Cicero, while some maintained a sincere belief in these\r\nceremonies, doubtless the great majority of public men saw in their\r\nuse nothing more than political chicanery calculated, by deceiving the\r\nmultitude, to keep the real power in the hands of a few.[709]\r\n\r\n    Rubino, J., _Untersuchungen über röm.

The object of this discussion,\r\non the contrary, is to consider all the occurrences of these words in the\r\nprincipal extant literature, especially prose, of the republic and of the\r\nAugustan age—a period in which the assemblies were still in existence—for\r\nthe purpose of testing the definition of Laelius, and of establishing new\r\ndefinitions by induction in case his should prove wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to begin with Livy, who though an imperial writer, and\r\nunder the stylistic influence of his age, probably adhered in the main to\r\nthe technical terminology of the republican annalists from whom he drew.\r\nThe first point which will be established is that in Livy’s usage the\r\ndifference between comitia and concilium is not a difference between the\r\nwhole people and a part of the people.[712]\r\n\r\nThe plebeian tribal assembly is termed comitia in Livy ii. 56. 1, 2;\r\nii. 58. 1; ii. 60. 4; iii. 13. 9 (“Verginio comitia habente conlegae\r\nappellati dimisere concilium,” in which comitia and concilium in one\r\nsentence are applied to the same assembly); iii. 17. 4 (the comitia for\r\npassing the Terentilian law, which from Livy’s point of view was the\r\nplebeian assembly);[713] iii. 24. 9; iii. 30. 6; iii. 51. 8 (comitia of\r\nplebeian soldiers for electing military tribunes and tribunes of the\r\nplebs); iii. 54. 9, 11: (plebeian comitia under the pontifex maximus);\r\niv. 44. 1; v. 10. 10; vi. 35. 10 (“Comitia praeter aedilium tribunorumque\r\nplebi nulla sunt habita”); vi. 36. 9 (the comitia for voting on the\r\nLicinian-Sextian laws); vi. 39. 5; xxv. 4. 6; xxxiv. 2. 11; xlv. 35. 7.\r\nOther examples of comitia of a part of the people are Livy ii. 64. 1\r\n(as the plebeians refused to participate in the consular election, the\r\npatricians and clients held the comitia); xxvi. 2. 2 (comitia held by\r\nthe soldiers, and hence by only a part of the people, for the election\r\nof a propraetor). Still more to the point are the comitia sacerdotum:\r\nfor electing a chief pontiff, Livy xxv. 5. 2; for electing an augur,\r\nxxxix. 45. 8; for electing a chief curio, xxvii. 8. 1. Comitia sacerdotum\r\nwere composed of seventeen tribes, and hence of only a part of the\r\npeople.[714] Lastly is to be noted the fact that the plebeian assembly\r\nmet on a comitialis dies; Livy iii. 11. 3.\r\n\r\nIt is now sufficiently established that Livy often applies the term\r\ncomitia to the assembly of plebs and to other assemblies which included\r\nbut a part of the people. It is equally true that he uses concilium to\r\ndenote an assembly of the whole people. The principal instances of Roman\r\nassemblies are:\r\n\r\n    (1) Livy i. 8. 1: “Vocataque ad concilium multitudine, quae\r\n    coalescere in populi unius corpus nulla re praeterquam legibus\r\n    poterat, iura dedit.”\r\n\r\n    (2) i. 26. 5: “Concilio populi advocato” (for the trial of\r\n    Horatius).\r\n\r\n    (3) i. 36. 6: “Auguriis certe sacerdotioque augurum tantus\r\n    honos accessit, ut nihil belli domique postea nisi auspicato\r\n    gereretur, concilia populi, exercitus vocati, summa rerum, ubi\r\n    aves non admississent, dirimerentur.”\r\n\r\n    (4) ii. 7. 7: “Vocato ad concilium populo” (representing the\r\n    consul as calling the people to an assembly).\r\n\r\n    (5) iii. 71. 3: “Concilio populi a magistratibus dato” (for\r\n    settling the dispute between Ardea and Aricia).\r\n\r\n    (6) vi. 20. 11: “Concilium populi indictum est” (an assembly of\r\n    the people which condemned Marcus Manlius).\r\n\r\nThese instances are well known, and have often been discussed. It is\r\nenough for our purpose to note here that they prove Livy’s willingness\r\nto designate assemblies of the whole Roman people as concilia. But\r\nMommsen[715] was not satisfied with regarding all these cases as\r\ninaccurate. In spite of Laelius he believed that concilium could\r\nsometimes properly apply to assemblies of all the people. With reference\r\nto the first example given above he says that where concilium denotes\r\nan assembly of all the people, the contio is meant—in other words, a\r\nconcilium of all the people is an assembly which has not been summoned\r\nwith a view to voting, and is not organized in voting divisions. This\r\nnew definition might explain example (1), for possibly Livy did not\r\nthink of the first Roman assembly as voting on the laws which Romulus\r\ngave, or even as organized. Unfortunately Mommsen tries to support his\r\ndefinition by example (2), which refers to the assembly for the trial\r\nof Horatius. But in ch. 26. 12 the same assembly, which must have been\r\nthe gathering of the curiae, and which Cicero[716] speaks of as comitia,\r\nvoted the acquittal of the accused. Hence it could not have been a mere\r\ncontio. Another passage cited in support of his view, Livy ii. 7. 7,\r\nexample (4), represents the consul as calling the people to a concilium.\r\nFirst he addressed them (“in contionem escendit”), and afterward laws\r\nwere passed on the subject of which he treated in his speech—evidently\r\nby the same assembly; hence the concilium populi here mentioned was\r\nsomething more than a contio. Another illustration which Mommsen offers,\r\nbut which, having to do with a Roman assembly only by implication, is not\r\nincluded in the list of examples given above, is Livy v. 43. 8: “When\r\nhe had pushed into the midst of the contio, though hitherto accustomed\r\nto keep away from such concilia.”[717] The passage refers to a meeting\r\nof the Ardeates for consulting in regard to the sudden approach of the\r\nGauls. Gatherings of the kind were called concilia, but the word contio\r\nis also introduced into the passage with reference to a speech made in\r\nthe assembly. The implication is that such concilia of all the people\r\nfor deliberation were held also at Rome. The circumstances indicate that\r\nit met with a view also to taking action, and that it was therefore\r\nnot a simple contio. This passage accordingly offers no support to\r\nMommsen’s view that when applied to the whole people concilium is merely\r\na listening, not an acting, assembly.[718] Summing up the evidence for\r\nthe new definition of concilium, we may say that, were it true, it might\r\napply to Livy i. 8. 1, though it is unessential to the explanation\r\neither of this passage or of any other. A single case, too, even if it\r\nwere clear, is not a sufficient basis for a generalization; and though\r\nwe must agree with Mommsen that the juristic definition does not cover\r\nthe cases cited above, it is necessary to reject his amendment as\r\nunsatisfactory.[719]\r\n\r\nIn fact Mommsen soon discovers cases which, from his own admission,\r\nneither his definition nor that of Laelius will explain, for instance,\r\nLivy i. 36. 6, example (3). On this citation Mommsen[720] remarks\r\nthat concilia in this connection could not mean contiones, with which\r\nin his opinion the auspices had nothing to do; it could not refer to\r\nthe plebeian assemblies, which he also assumes to have been free\r\nfrom the auspices.[721] He concludes, therefore, that it denotes the\r\n“patricio-plebeian” tribal assemblies.[722] But why Livy should here be\r\nthinking merely of the tribal assemblies, especially in connection with a\r\ntime before they had come into existence, no one could possibly explain.\r\nIt is far more reasonable to assume that he intended to include all\r\nkinds of assemblies, curiate, centuriate, and tribal, which required the\r\nauspices. The next citation which Mommsen finds difficult is Livy iii.\r\n71. 3, example (5)—an assembly of the tribes meeting under the consuls to\r\ndecide the dispute between Ardea and Aricia over a piece of territory.\r\nThe assembly voted (ch. 72. 6) that the land in question belonged to the\r\nRoman people. Mommsen’s[723] explanation of concilium in this connection\r\nis that the resolution adopted by this assembly affected foreign states\r\nonly, and was not binding on Rome; hence he assumes that comitia are an\r\nassembly whose resolutions are binding on the Roman state. Here then we\r\nhave a third definition of concilium based like the second on a single\r\ncase. But Mommsen thinks he finds some evidence for his last definition\r\nin the fact that assemblies of foreign states are usually termed\r\nconcilia; and he assumes the reason to be that their resolutions were\r\nnot binding on Rome. It would be strange, however, if in calling foreign\r\ninstitutions by Latin names (rex, senatus, populus, plebs, praetor,\r\ndictator, etc.) Roman writers attempted to show a connection between\r\nthese institutions and Rome, seeing that in most cases no such connection\r\ncould exist. The proposed explanation of this use of concilium becomes\r\nactually absurd when it is extended to foreign comitia; Mommsen certainly\r\nwould not say that the resolutions of the Syracusan comitia, mentioned by\r\nLivy, were binding on Rome.\r\n\r\nHis last and most difficult case is Livy vi. 20. 11—the concilium populi\r\nwhich condemned Marcus Manlius, example (6), p. 121. Evidently this\r\nwas the centuriate assembly, which alone had the right to try capital\r\ncases, and which alone had to meet outside the pomerium. Various feeble\r\nexplanations have been proposed; but Mommsen, with others, prefers to\r\nconsider the word wrongly used. It is true that if we accept the juristic\r\ndefinition, we must conclude that Livy is guilty of error not only in\r\nthis case but wherever he applies the term concilium to an assembly of\r\nall the people, Roman or foreign; but as we shall proceed by induction,\r\nwe must, at least provisionally, consider all the cases correct, and\r\nframe our definitions accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe have now reviewed a number of passages in Livy in which concilium\r\nincludes all the Romans. There remains a large group of passages which\r\nrefer to foreign assemblies. In considering these cases we are to bear in\r\nmind that the Romans apply to foreign institutions in general the Latin\r\nterms with which they are familiar, and in the same sense in which these\r\nterms are used of Roman institutions; in this way only could they make\r\nthemselves understood.\r\n\r\n    Concilium populi and concilia populorum are frequent (e.g. Livy\r\n    vii. 25. 5; x. 10. 11; 14. 3; xxi. 14. 1; xxiv. 37. 11), and\r\n    most of the assemblies of foreign states designated as concilia\r\n    are known to have admitted both nobles and commons.\r\n\r\n    Instances of concilia in foreign states are: Alba Longa, Livy\r\n    i. 6. 1; Latins, Livy i. 50-52; vi. 10. 7; vii. 25. 5; viii. 3.\r\n    10; xxvii. 9. 2; Aequians, Livy iii. 2. 3; ix. 45. 8; Antium,\r\n    Roman colony at, Livy iii. 10. 8; Veii, Livy v. 1. 8; Etruria,\r\n    Livy v. 17. 6; x. 10. 11; 13. 3; 14. 3; Gauls, Livy v. 36. 1;\r\n    xxi. 20. 1; Hernicans, Livy vi. 10. 7; Samnites, Livy x. 12.\r\n    2; Saguntines, Livy xxi. 14. 1; Iberians, Livy xxi. 19. 9, 11;\r\n    xxix. 3. 1, 4; Enna, Livy xxiv. 37. 11; Aetolians, Livy xxvi.\r\n    24. 1; xxvii. 29. 10; xxxi. 29. 1, 2, 8; 32. 3, 4; xxxiii. 3.\r\n    7; 12. 6: xxxiv. 41. 5; xxxv. 32. 3, 5; 33. 1, 4; 34. 2; 43.\r\n    7; xxxvi. 26. 1; 28. 7, 9; xxxviii. 9. 11; 10. 2; xlii. 6;\r\n    Achaeans, Livy xxvii. 30. 6; xxxi. 25. 2; xxxii. 19. 4, 5, 9;\r\n    20. 1; 21. 2; 22. 3, 9, 12; xxxv. 25. 4; 27. 11; 48. 1; xxxvi.\r\n    31. 9, 10; 32. 9; 34. 1; 35. 7; xxxviii. 31. 1; 32. 3; 34.\r\n    5; 35. 1; xxxix. 33, 35, 36, 37, 48, 50; xli. 24; xlii. 12;\r\n    xliii. 17; Epirus, Livy xxxii. 10. 2; xlii. 38. 1: Boeotians,\r\n    Livy xxxiii. 1. 7; 2. 1, 7; xxxvi. 6. 3; xlii. 43, 44, 47;\r\n    Acarnanians, Livy xxxiii. 16. 3, 5, 8; xliii. 17; Thessalians,\r\n    Livy xxxiv. 51. 5; xxxv. 31. 3; xxxvi. 8. 2; xlii. 38; Argos,\r\n    Livy xlii. 44; Macedonians, Livy xlv. 18.\r\n\r\nThough most of these concilia are known to have been assemblies of the\r\nwhole people, nobles and commons, very rarely, as in Livy x. 16. 3,\r\nthe word signifies a council of a few men—in this case, of the leading\r\nmen of Etruria (cf. xxxvi. 6. 6); and twice, at Capua, we hear of a\r\nplebis concilium; Livy xxiii. 4. 4; xxvi. 16. 9. From the frequency of\r\nthe first-mentioned use we must conclude that Livy does not hesitate to\r\ndesignate as concilia assemblies of the whole people.\r\n\r\nComitia, on the other hand, more rarely applies to foreign assemblies. We\r\nhear of comitia of the Veientans (Livy v. 1. 1), of the Syracusans (Livy\r\nxxiv. 23. 1; 26. 16; 27. 1), of the Argives (Livy xxxii. 25. 2), of the\r\nBoeotians (Livy xxxiii. 27. 8), and of the Thessalians (Livy xxxiv. 51.\r\n5).\r\n\r\nThe conclusions thus far reached are as follows:\r\n\r\nI. As to Comitia:\r\n\r\n    1. Livy frequently uses comitia to denote the tribal assembly\r\n    of the plebs.\r\n\r\n    2. He always uses comitia to denote the assembly for the\r\n    election of priests, consisting of but seventeen tribes, and\r\n    hence of a minority of the people.\r\n\r\nII. As to Concilium:\r\n\r\n    1. He frequently uses concilia (rarely comitia) to denote\r\n    foreign assemblies of all the people.\r\n\r\n    2. Less frequently he uses concilia to denote Roman assemblies\r\n    of all the people.\r\n\r\nMommsen and others admit, however, that Livy’s usage does not conform\r\nstrictly to the definition of Laelius Felix; they assume accordingly that\r\nthe exact meaning of comitia was lost in imperial times, that for the\r\ncorrect usage we should look to the republican writers.\r\n\r\nAs Caesar has little occasion for employing the terms in relation to\r\nthe Roman assemblies, his usage on purely Roman grounds cannot be made\r\nout. Foreign assemblies—that is, of Gauls—he generally designates as\r\nconcilia: _B. G._ i. 30, 31; iii. 18; v. 2, 6, 24, 56 f.; vi. 3, 20; vii.\r\n63, 89; viii. 20 (Hirtius). In all these cases the concilium is a tribal\r\nor national assembly including both nobles and commons; more rarely the\r\nword signifies a council of chiefs; _B. G._ i. 33; vii. 75; and perhaps\r\nvii. 1. Once he applies comitia to Gallic assemblies; _B. G._ vii. 67.\r\nSo far, therefore, as his usage can be determined, it does not differ\r\nfrom Livy’s. From Macrobius, _Sat._ i. 16. 29 (“Contra Julius Caesar\r\nXVI auspiciorum negat, nundinis contionem advocari posse: id est cum\r\npopulo agere: ideoque nundinis Romanorum haberi comitia non posse”), it\r\nappears that in Lucius Julius Caesar’s[724] augural language, which must\r\ncertainly have been conservative, contio was a general word including\r\ncomitia. This passage, with the similar one in Cicero, _Att._ iv. 3. 4,\r\nsuggests that the distinctions between contio, comitia, and concilium,\r\nfar from breaking down in late republican times, were only then taking\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe material furnished by Sallust is more conclusive. In _Hist._ ii. 22,\r\nconcilium Gallorum doubtless signifies a national assembly; and although\r\ngenerally comitia refers to the centuriate gathering (_Cat._ 24, 26;\r\n_Iug._ 36, 44), in _Iug._ 37 (“P. Lucullus and L. Annius, tribunes of\r\nthe plebs, against the efforts of their colleagues strove to prolong\r\ntheir office, and this dissension put off the comitia through all the\r\nrest of the year”)[725] it clearly designates the assembly of the plebs.\r\nHis usage accordingly, which allows concilium sometimes to apply to an\r\nassembly of the whole people and comitia to an assembly of a part of the\r\npeople, does not differ from that of Livy.\r\n\r\nCicero, however, is the author on whom scholars rely in support of the\r\ndefinition of Laelius. Following Berns,[726] they say Cicero has violated\r\nthe rule but once, _Att._ i. 1. 1, in which occurs the phrase comitiis\r\ntribuniciis. Berns’ examination of Cicero must have been exceedingly\r\nhasty, as he has left a number of instances unnoticed. The following\r\npassage is especially to the point, _Q. Fr._ ii. 14 (15 b). 4:\r\n\r\n    “The candidates for the tribuneship have made a mutual\r\n    compact—having deposited five hundred sestertia apiece with\r\n    Cato, they agree to conduct their canvass according to his\r\n    direction, with the understanding that any one offending\r\n    against it is to be condemned by him. If these comitia, then,\r\n    turn out to be pure, Cato will have been of more avail than all\r\n    laws and jurors put together.”[727]\r\n\r\nThe tribunician comitia are the only comitia concerned in Cato’s\r\ntransaction. Again in _Att._ ii. 23. 3 (“It is of great interest to\r\nme that you should be present at Rome, if not at the comitia for his\r\nelection, at least after he has been declared elected”)[728] Cicero is\r\nthinking of the election of Clodius to the tribuneship, and hence the\r\ncomitia he refers to are the assembly of plebs. In _Fam._ viii. 4. 3,\r\n“aedilium plebis comitiis” must refer to the plebeian assembly, in which\r\nthe plebeian aediles were elected.[729] Another important passage is\r\n_Sest._ 51. 109:\r\n\r\n    “I come now to the comitia whether for electing magistrates or\r\n    for enacting laws. We often see laws passed in great numbers.\r\n    I say nothing of those which are enacted in such a manner that\r\n    scarcely five of each tribe, and those not from their own\r\n    tribe, voted for them. He (Clodius) says that at the time of\r\n    that ruin of the republic he carried a law concerning me, whom\r\n    he called a tyrant and the destroyer of liberty. Who is there\r\n    who will confess that he gave a vote when this law was passed\r\n    against me? But when in compliance with the same resolution\r\n    of the senate, a law was passed about me in the comitia\r\n    centuriata, who is there who does not profess that then he was\r\n    present, and that he gave a vote in favor of my safety? Which\r\n    cause, then, is the one which ought to appear popular? That in\r\n    which everything that is honorable in the city, and every age,\r\n    and every rank of men agree? Or that to the carrying of which\r\n    some excited furies fly as if hastening to a banquet on the\r\n    funeral of the republic?”[730]\r\n\r\nThe law which Cicero dwells on with such bitterness at the beginning\r\nof this passage and recurs to at the end is the tribunician law which\r\npronounced on him the sentence of exile; in this connection, therefore,\r\ncomitia distinctly includes the plebeian assembly in its legislative\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nEven more telling is _Leg._ iii. 19. 44-45:\r\n\r\n    “They (our ancestors) forbade the enactment of laws regarding\r\n    particular persons except by the comitia centuriata. For when\r\n    the people are organized according to wealth, rank, and age,\r\n    they use more consideration in giving their votes than when\r\n    summoned promiscuously by tribes. In our case, therefore, a\r\n    man of great ability and of consummate prudence, Lucius Cotta,\r\n    truly insisted that no act whatever had been passed regarding\r\n    us; for in addition to the fact that those comitia had been\r\n    held wholly under the fear of armed slaves, the comitia tributa\r\n    could not legally pass capital sentences or privilegia.\r\n    Consequently there was no need of a law to reinstate us,\r\n    against whom exile had not been legally pronounced. But it\r\n    seemed better both to you and to other most illustrious men\r\n    that all Italy should show what it felt concerning that same\r\n    person against whom some slaves and robbers declared they had\r\n    passed a decree.”[731]\r\n\r\nCicero is here contrasting the comitia centuriata, which recalled him,\r\nwith the tribal assembly of the plebs, which pronounced the sentence of\r\nexile. Now as he was condemned by the plebeian assembly, it is clear\r\nthat in this passage Cicero calls the plebeian assembly comitia. How\r\nMommsen[732] can make this citation refer to his “patricio-plebeian”\r\ncomitia tributa no one can possibly explain. In _Att._ iii. 12. 1,\r\ncomitia expressly includes the tribunician elections. The same elections\r\nare twice called comitia in _Att._ iii. 14; and in iii. 13. 1, Cicero,\r\nagain mentioning these comitia, says: “In tribunis plebis designatis\r\nreliqua spes est.” From all these passages it becomes evident that Cicero\r\nregards the plebeian assembly as comitia. In many passages comitia\r\nseems to include all the elections of the year, of plebeian as well as\r\nof patrician magistrates; for the elections were usually held in the\r\nsame season, and could not well be separated in thought.[733] In fact,\r\naccording to Cicero’s usage, comitia includes all kinds of national\r\nassemblies which do not come under the term contiones; cf. _Sest._ 50.\r\n106:\r\n\r\n    “In three places can the judgment and the will of the Roman\r\n    people be best discovered, in contio, in comitia, and in the\r\n    gathering for the festivals and the gladiatorial shows.”[734]\r\n    Cf. also 54. 115; 59. 125.\r\n\r\nThe very phrase comitia populi (_Rep._ ii. 32. 56; _Div._ ii. 18. 42)\r\nimplies the existence of other comitia, for instance comitia plebis.\r\nIt is not strange, therefore, that Cicero should use the following\r\nexpression; _Rep._ i. 33. 50: “The nobles who have arrogated to\r\nthemselves this name, not with the consent of the people, but by their\r\nown comitia.”[735] Here he makes it evident that there may be comitia\r\nof the nobles in contrast with the “consent of the people.” Should the\r\nsenate usurp the elective function, Cicero would not hesitate to call\r\nthat small body comitia, as appears from his ironical expressions in\r\n_Phil._ xi. 8. 19 (“Quod si comitia placet in senatu haberi” and “Quae\r\nigitur haec comitia”), in which he anticipates imperial usage; cf. Vell.\r\nii. 124; Tac. _Ann._ i. 15.\r\n\r\nFurthermore he speaks of comitia, consisting of but seventeen tribes, for\r\nthe election of sacerdotes; _Cael._ 8. 19; _Leg. Agr._ ii. 7. 18; _Ad\r\nBrut._ i. 5. 3 f.; 14. 1; _Fam._ viii. 12. 4; 14. 1.\r\n\r\nFrom his point of view, a tribal assembly of the whole people was one\r\nwhich consisted of all thirty-five tribes, irrespective of the number\r\npresent in the several tribes, irrespective, too, of the rank of those\r\nwho attended. An assembly tributim of a part of the people, on the other\r\nhand, was one in which some of the tribes were unrepresented. All this is\r\nclearly expressed in _Leg. Agr._ ii. 7. 16 f.:\r\n\r\n    “For it orders the tribune of the plebs who has passed this law\r\n    to elect ten decemvirs by the votes of seventeen tribes in such\r\n    a way that he shall be decemvir whom nine tribes (a majority\r\n    of the seventeen) have elected. Here I ask on what account he\r\n    (the proposer of the law) has made a beginning of his measures\r\n    and statutes in such form as to deprive the Roman people of\r\n    their right to vote.... For since it is fitting for every\r\n    power, command, and commission to proceed from the entire Roman\r\n    people, those especially ought to do so which are established\r\n    for some use or advantage of the people, in which case they all\r\n    together choose also the man who they think will look out more\r\n    carefully for the interest of the Roman people, and each one by\r\n    his own zeal and his own vote assists to make a road by which\r\n    he may obtain some individual benefit for himself. This is the\r\n    tribune to whom it has occurred, more than to any one else, to\r\n    deprive the entire Roman people of the right to vote, and to\r\n    summon a few tribes, not by any fixed legal condition, but by\r\n    the favor of sortition, to usurp the liberty of all.”[736]\r\n\r\nEven if the tribes were represented by no more than five men each, and\r\nthese men not voting in their own tribes, the assembly was nevertheless\r\ncomitia tributa populi.[737] This distinction—recognized by Cicero and\r\nhis contemporaries—between an assembly of the whole people as represented\r\nby all the voting divisions and an assembly of a part of the people as\r\nrepresented by some of the voting divisions, is incompatible with the\r\ndistinction formulated by Laelius. Though an antiquarian might make\r\nmuch of the presence or absence of a few patricians, a man who lived in\r\nthe present, as did Cicero, probably never troubled himself about such\r\nunpractical matters.[738]\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence as to Cicero’s usage given above, we must draw the\r\nfollowing conclusions:\r\n\r\n    1. He often uses comitia to denote the plebeian tribal\r\n    assembly, just as Livy does.\r\n\r\n    2. He regularly uses comitia to denote the assembly of\r\n    seventeen tribes for the election of sacerdotes. In this\r\n    respect his usage is the same as Livy’s.\r\n\r\n    3. He is ready to call the senate comitia, should it usurp the\r\n    elective function—an anticipation of imperial usage.\r\n\r\n    4. His distinction between an assembly of the whole people and\r\n    an assembly of a part of the people is incompatible with the\r\n    definition of Laelius.\r\n\r\nConcilium is comparatively rare in Cicero’s works. In a few cases\r\nhe seems to make concilia include all kinds of organized national\r\ngatherings; cf. _Rep._ vi. 13 (3). 13: “Nihil est enim illi principi\r\ndeo ... acceptius quam concilia coetusque hominum iure sociati, quae\r\ncivitates appellantur (Nothing is more agreeable to the Supreme Being\r\nthan assemblies and gatherings of men which are joined in societies by\r\nlaw and which are called states”); _Fin._ iii. 19. 63: “Natura sumus\r\napti ad coetus, concilia, civitates.” In the first citation concilium\r\nmust, and in the second it may, include all the citizens. Cicero could\r\nhardly mean that we are by nature adapted to assemblies of a part of\r\nthe people, or that nothing could be more satisfactory to the Supreme\r\nBeing than the concilium plebis which interdicted him from fire and\r\nwater. In _Fin._ ii. 24. 77 (“To me those sentiments seem genuine which\r\nare honorable, praiseworthy, and creditable, which may be expressed in\r\nthe senate, before the people, and in every gathering and concilium”)\r\nhe could not be thinking simply of the plebeian assembly, for he placed\r\nfar greater value on the opinions expressed in and by the comitia\r\ncenturiata.[739]\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said it is evident that Cicero’s usage as well as\r\nSallust’s does not differ from that of Livy. In fact no variation can\r\nbe found in all the extant literature of the republic.[740] But it may\r\nbe asked whether there was not a juristic tradition separate from the\r\nliterary and preserving from early time the true distinction between the\r\ntwo words under discussion. A negative answer is compelled by the fact\r\nthat history had its origin with jurisprudence in the pontifical college,\r\nthat from the beginning historian and jurist were often united in the\r\nsame person.[741] Hence the juristic usage was the same as the literary.\r\nIt is thoroughly established, therefore, that in the late republic,\r\nas well as in the early empire, the distinction between comitia and\r\nconcilium was not a distinction between the whole and a part; in fact,\r\nit becomes doubtful whether the definition of Laelius was known to the\r\nwriters of this period.\r\n\r\nThe results thus far reached are of great importance; the definition of\r\ncomitia and concilium formulated by Laelius has been set aside, and the\r\nground prepared for the establishment of new definitions by induction.\r\nFrom the material afforded by the authors under discussion, the following\r\nconclusions relative to the general uses of the two words may be drawn:\r\n\r\nI. (_a_) The phrases comitia curiata, comitia centuriata, comitia tributa\r\nconstantly occur; whereas (_b_) the phrases concilium curiatum (or -tim),\r\nconcilium centuriatum (or -tim), concilium tributum (or -tim) cannot be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The former is too well known to need illustration; (_b_) the latter\r\nmay be sufficiently established by an examination of the references for\r\nconcilium given in this chapter.\r\n\r\nII. (_a_) Concilium may apply to a non-political as well as to a\r\npolitical gathering; (_b_) comitia is wholly restricted to the political\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Concilium is non-political in Cicero, _Div._ i. 24. 49 (deorum\r\nconcilium); _Tusc._ iv. 32. 69; _N. D._ i. 8. 18; _Off._ iii. 5. 25; 9.\r\n38: _Senec._ 23. 84; _Fin._ ii. 4. 12 (virtutum concilium); _Rep._ i. 17.\r\n28 (doctissimorum hominum in concilio); _Sest._ 14. 32 (applied to the\r\nmeeting of a collegium); Livy i. 21. 3 (Camenarum concilia); ii. 38. 4;\r\nxxvii. 35. 4.[742]\r\n\r\nIII. Within the political sphere, again, (_a_) concilium is the more\r\ngeneral term,—it suggests neither organization nor lack of organization;\r\nwhereas (_b_) comitia is restricted to the organized assembly.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Concilium is the more general term in Cicero, _Fin._ iii. 19. 63;\r\nii. 24. 77; _Rep._ vi. 13 (3). 13.[743] In all these citations concilia,\r\ndenoting assemblies of the whole people, must certainly include organized\r\nmeetings, without excluding the unorganized. In _Leg._ iii. 19. 42\r\n(“Invito eo qui cum populo ageret, seditionem non posse fieri, quippe\r\ncui liceat concilium, simul atque intercessum turbarique coeptum sit,\r\ndimittere”) concilium is probably the organized assembly. On the other\r\nhand, the concilium of all the people mentioned by Livy, i. 8. 1, may\r\nhave been unorganized.\r\n\r\nIV. Within the province of organized national gatherings, on the other\r\nhand, (_a_) comitia is the wider term, applying as it does to all\r\nassemblies of the kind, whatever their function; whereas (_b_) concilium\r\nas an organized national assembly is wholly restricted to legislative and\r\njudicial functions.[744]\r\n\r\n(_a_) Comitia is used in its most general sense in Cicero, _Div._ i. 45.\r\n103; ii. 18. 42 f.; 35. 74; _Tusc._ iv. 1. 1.[745]\r\n\r\nV. (_a_) Applied to foreign institutions, comitia always designates\r\nelectoral assemblies; (_b_) as at Rome, concilia are always legislative\r\nor judicial assemblies.[746]\r\n\r\n(_a_) Comitia is used of foreign states in:\r\n\r\n    Caesar, _B. G._ vii. 67; Cicero, _Verr._ II. ii. 52. 128 (three\r\n    occurrences), 129, 130; 53. 133; 54. 136; _Fam._ viii. 1. 2;\r\n    Livy v. 1. 1; xxiv. 23. 1; 26. 16; 27. 1; xxxii. 25. 2; xxxiii.\r\n    27. 8; xxxiv. 51. 5.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Foreign concilia are mentioned by:\r\n\r\n    Caesar, _B.

(_a_) Rarely is either the centuriate assembly or the so-called\r\npatricio-plebeian tribal assembly termed concilium; (_b_) the plebeian\r\ntribal assembly is rarely termed comitia except when electoral.\r\n\r\nThe principal instances of the rare use of concilium under (_a_) are Livy\r\ni. 26. 5; 36. 6; iii. 71. 3; vi. 20. 11.[748] (_b_) In its legislative\r\nor judicial capacity the plebeian tribal assembly is called comitia in\r\nCicero, _Leg._ iii. 19. 45; _Sest._ 51. 109; Livy iii. 13. 9; 17. 4; vi.\r\n36. 9; xxv. 4. 6; xxxiv. 2. 11; xlv. 35.\r\n\r\nThis classification covers without exception all the cases in the authors\r\nunder discussion. An attempt may now be made to trace the development of\r\nthese uses.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be considered is that whereas concilium is singular,\r\ncomitia is plural. Undoubtedly it is a plural of the parts of which the\r\nwhole is composed; in other words, the curiae, or centuries, or tribes\r\nwere originally thought of as little assemblies, whose sum total formed\r\nthe comitia. Comitia therefore always has reference to the parts—the\r\nvoting units—of which the assembly is composed, whereas concilium as a\r\nsingular views the assembly without reference to its parts. For this\r\nreason, whenever it is advisable to add a modifier to indicate the\r\nkind of organization of the assembly, comitia is always used. We find,\r\naccordingly, comitia curiata, comitia centuriata, and comitia tributa in\r\ncommon use, but never concilium curiatum (or -tim), concilium centuriatum\r\n(or -tim), or concilium tributum (or -tim). These last expressions, which\r\nare modern inventions, do not accord with the Roman way of viewing the\r\nassemblies. This consideration satisfactorily explains the first general\r\nuse.[749]\r\n\r\nAs a non-political gathering is not made up of groups—similar to the\r\nvoting divisions of the national assemblies—it cannot be called comitia.\r\nConcilium is the only term appropriate to it; hence we have the second\r\ngeneral use of the two words.[750]\r\n\r\nThe same consideration makes concilium the more general term within\r\nthe political sphere; the assembly it designates may be organized or\r\nunorganized, whereas comitia applies only to assemblies organized in\r\nvoting divisions. This is the third general use.[751]\r\n\r\nFor explaining the four remaining uses it is necessary to inquire\r\ninto the fundamental meaning of concilium. Although the etymology is\r\nuncertain, probability favors the ancient conjecture which derives\r\nit from “con-calare.”[752] People could only be called together for\r\na purpose, which would most naturally be conversation, discussion,\r\ndeliberation. Whatever may have been its origin, concilium certainly\r\ndeveloped this meaning.[753] In the manuscripts and editions it is\r\nfrequently interchanged with consilium,[754] and in the sources these\r\ntwo words are often placed in punning juxtaposition.[755] Possibly their\r\nclose resemblance, founded on no etymological connection of the roots,\r\nhelped create in concilium the idea of deliberation. At all events in the\r\nprose authors of the period under discussion this is the primary meaning.\r\nThe deliberative character of most non-political concilia is very\r\nevident.[756] With this meaning the word could not designate an electoral\r\nassembly, which did not allow discussion;[757] it was restricted to\r\nlegislative and judicial assemblies, in which the voting was preceded by\r\ndeliberation. This is the fourth use.[758]\r\n\r\nRarely did a Roman writer have occasion to mention an election in a\r\nforeign state. Whenever he did so, however, he always used comitia. Most\r\nof the business of foreign assemblies referred to by Roman writers was\r\nconcerned with international affairs—was legislative—and hence foreign\r\nassemblies are usually termed concilia.[759] This consideration accounts\r\nfor the fifth general use.[760]\r\n\r\nThe sixth[761] may be easily explained. The tendency was to restrict\r\ncomitia to electoral assemblies, just as concilium was restricted to\r\nlegislative and judicial assemblies, though this tendency never became a\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThe seventh[762] may be accounted for by the fact that after the\r\npassing of the Hortensian Law, the centuriate comitia came to be almost\r\nwholly electoral, while the plebeian tribal gathering became the chief\r\nstatute-making body in the state. Furthermore the assembly over which\r\nthe tribunes presided was far more deliberative than any other. Hence\r\nthe centuriate assembly became _the_ comitia, and the plebeian tribal\r\nassembly _the_ concilium.[763]\r\n\r\nThe cause of the error into which Laelius[764] fell is now apparent.\r\nFinding the plebeian tribal assembly frequently termed concilium and\r\nthe centuriate assembly of the whole people generally termed comitia,\r\nhe hastily concluded that comitia should be restricted to assemblies of\r\nthe whole people and concilia to assemblies of a part of the people.\r\nThis discussion has proved, against Laelius, that for the republic and\r\nfor the age of Augustus the distinction between the two words was not\r\na distinction between the whole and a part, and that all the uses of\r\ncomitia and concilium in this period may be explained by two simple\r\nfacts: (1) that whereas concilium is singular, comitia is plural; (2)\r\nthat concilium suggests deliberation, discussion.\r\n\r\nA result of this inquiry is to banish the expressions “concilium tributum\r\nplebis” and “patricio-plebeian comitia tributa”—the former as impossible,\r\nthe latter as unnecessary—from the nomenclature of Roman public law.\r\nThere were but three forms of organized assembly—curiate, centuriate, and\r\ntribal—all equally entitled to the name “comitia.” The difference between\r\nthe “comitia tributa populi” and “comitia tributa plebis” was chiefly in\r\nthe presidency, as will be shown in a later chapter.[765] Contio, on the\r\nother hand, denotes the listening or witnessing assembly, unorganized or\r\norganized but never voting, whereas concilium, overlapping contio and\r\ncomitia, may include voting in addition to deliberation.\r\n\r\n    Mommsen, Th., _Röm.

In an early stage of its history it\r\nmust have been a general term for public assembly, especially comitia.\r\nThis meaning appears most clearly in a passage of Macrobius,[767] in\r\nwhich, quoting the treatise of Lucius Julius Caesar on the Auspices, he\r\ndeclares (1) that on market days a contio cannot be called, (2) in other\r\nwords, that on such days business cannot be transacted with the people,\r\n(3) that for this reason the Romans cannot hold comitia on market days.\r\nCicero,[768] too, states with reference to a certain market day that\r\n“for two days no contio can be held”—for the day of the market and the\r\none following. From the context it is evident that he, like Macrobius,\r\nis thinking of comitia, which, as is well known, could not legally meet\r\non market days.[769] Doubtless in the conservative nomenclature of\r\nthe pontiffs and augurs, quoted by Macrobius and Cicero, contio still\r\nincluded comitia; it must in fact have applied more particularly to\r\nthe formal, voting assembly; for informal meetings were not forbidden\r\non such days.[770] But in the time of Cicero this use of the word was\r\nobsolete excepting in the archaic formulae of the sacerdotal colleges.\r\nIn the political language of his age contio had come to be restricted\r\nto the non-voting assembly—either organized[771] or more commonly\r\nunorganized—summoned by a magistrate or a sacerdos,[772] and in this\r\nsense it will be used in the present volume. Still farther removed from\r\nits origin is the meaning “oration” delivered to the people in such a\r\ngathering.[773]\r\n\r\nBecause of the passive character of this form of assembly the magistrate\r\nadmitted all who wished to attend, without inquiring whether they were\r\ncitizens and in full possession of their political rights.[774] It might\r\nbe composed either of soldiers[775] or of civilians, presided over in\r\nthe field by the commander, in the city by any magistrate who had a\r\nright to hold comitia in their own or in another’s name, including the\r\nking,[776] interrex, dictator, master of horse, and tribunes of the\r\nplebs;[777] also the quaestors[778] and aediles,[779] the pontifex\r\nmaximus and the rex sacrorum.[780] Necessarily the right belonged as well\r\nto all extraordinary magistrates, as the decemviri legibus scribundis,\r\nwho possessed consular power within the city.[781] But promagistrates\r\nand any others who held an exclusively military imperium could summon\r\nneither the comitia nor the civil contio.[782] The censors held contiones\r\nfor the taking of the census,[783] for imposing fines,[784] and for the\r\nlustration. In the last-named function the assembly was also called\r\ncomitia centuriata or exercitus urbanus.[785] The quaestors, the curule\r\naediles, and the plebeian aediles exercised their jurisdiction in\r\ncontiones and comitia, which for this purpose they called not in their\r\nown name but by permission of a higher magistrate.[786]\r\n\r\nAs the contio did not, like the comitia, theoretically include all the\r\npeople, any number of magistrates could simultaneously hold meetings of\r\nthe kind.[787] A minor officer had no right to take charge of, or to\r\nsummon the people from, a contio called by another. A higher officer\r\nexercised this right against a lower; the consul, for instance,\r\ncould take the meeting from the hands of any ordinary patrician\r\nmagistrate,[788] though not of a tribune of the plebs. No one dared\r\ndisturb a meeting of any kind under the presidency of the latter,[789]\r\nand at least in the late republic a tribune sometimes forbade a patrician\r\nmagistrate to address an assembly;[790] but otherwise consuls and\r\nplebeian tribunes might hold simultaneous contiones.[791]\r\n\r\nSometimes the contio was summoned merely to witness a public act. The\r\nconsuls called the people together outside the walls by the sound of\r\nthe war-trumpet to see an execution for treason. On this occasion the\r\ncitizens were arrayed in centuries on the Campus Martius, in an assembly\r\ncalled at once comitia centuriata and contio.[792] We hear of a similar\r\nexecution of an astrologer or magician outside the Esquiline gate,\r\naccording to a primitive custom;[793] and it was most probably in a\r\ncontio that the supreme pontiff scourged to death a man who had wronged a\r\nVestal.[794] The people gathered in the same kind of meeting to witness\r\nan oath,[795] a judicial process,[796] or the levy of a fine.[797] But\r\nit was preëminently the listening assembly, hence the definition offered\r\nby Gellius,[798] “To hold a contio is to address the people, without\r\ncalling on them for a vote.” It applied not only to the isolated meeting\r\nsummoned to hear edicts, reports, communications of every kind, including\r\narguments and appeals for or against a given policy,[799] but also to\r\nthe preparatory stage of the voting assembly whether addresses were\r\ndelivered or not. Occasionally in early times there was speaking on the\r\nmerits of candidates at the opening of an electoral assembly, and the\r\nvoting was sometimes interrupted for the purpose.[800] Before the age of\r\nCicero this rare proceeding had disappeared. In his day the canvass for\r\ncandidates had been made before the holding of the preliminary contio,\r\nwhich accordingly was brief and formal. Because much time was required\r\nfor the voting of the centuries,[801] speaking on the day of their\r\nassembly had to be minimized. For this reason the contio for advising\r\nthe adoption of a resolution by the comitia centuriata was held on an\r\nearlier day. Such was the meeting summoned in the Campus Martius by the\r\nconsul P. Lentulus for the purpose of urging the people to vote in the\r\nensuing centuriate assembly for the recall of Cicero.[802] In judicial\r\nproceedings before any of the assemblies the testimonies of witnesses and\r\nthe pleadings occupied the greater part of the time, and for this reason\r\njudicial assemblies were frequently termed simply contiones. They will be\r\ndescribed in a later chapter.[803]\r\n\r\nInformal contiones could be called at any time while the sun was up,[804]\r\nwith or without[805] an interval between the summons and the meeting, and\r\nin any place[806] at the pleasure of the person who convoked them. In\r\npublic assemblies of every kind the people remained standing throughout\r\nthe session.[807] The magistrate who was about to summon an auspicated\r\ncontio repaired to the templum which he intended to occupy during the\r\nmeeting.[808] After taking the auspices there, and finding the omens\r\nfavorable, he ordered the crier to call the citizens.[809] His directions\r\nto this assistant were prefaced by a solemn wish that the gathering of\r\nthe citizens might be well, fortunate, auspicious, and advantageous to\r\nthe Roman people, the commonwealth, himself, his colleague or colleagues,\r\nand his magistracy.[810] After first issuing the summons from the templum\r\nthe crier repeated it while making the circuit of the walls.[811]\r\nMeantime the presiding officer invited the senators, his colleague or\r\ncolleagues, and the various other magistrates to assist him with their\r\npresence and advice.[812] The invitation was extended even to opposing\r\ntribunes;[813] and on the other hand a presiding tribune was especially\r\nanxious to secure the presence and favorable influence of patrician\r\nmagistrates and of the leading men of the state.[814] When the president\r\nsaw his friends about him and the people gathered, he called the contio\r\nto order,[815] and proceeded to open the meeting with a prayer.[816] In\r\nthe case of a resolution to be brought before the assembly the magistrate\r\nwas accustomed first to submit it to the senate, which considered the\r\nbill and perhaps suggested alterations;[817] but sometimes measures were\r\nbrought into the comitia without this senatorial deliberation.[818]\r\nIn the contio the presiding officer had power to exclude or to limit\r\ndiscussion of his proposals. Ordinarily he found it advantageous to\r\ninstruct the people regarding the subject on which they were to vote; and\r\nit was for this purpose that one or more contiones were held previous to\r\nthe comitia. The right to address the people belonged primarily to the\r\npresiding magistrate. Although the king enjoyed the superior right, the\r\nnotion that in the regal period no private persons spoke in the assembly\r\nseems to be unwarranted.[819] The custom of the republic prescribed that\r\nthe president should grant the privilege not only to his colleagues[820]\r\nbut also to all the higher magistrates.[821] In some cases the\r\ninvitation was extended to senators[822] and to other distinguished\r\nprivate persons.[823] The tribunes sometimes gave the privilege to\r\nfreedmen,[824] to foreign kings,[825] and to ambassadors.[826] The early\r\nrepublic did not allow women to be present in political meetings;[827]\r\nbut in time this severity began to relax. Livy[828] represents the\r\nelder Cato as saying that his generation permitted women to take part\r\nin affairs of state and to interfere in contiones and comitia—evidently\r\nan exaggeration, as the context proves that the women referred to did\r\nnot actually come into the assembly, and the speaker intimates that\r\ncustom disapproved of their doing so. From the time of the Gracchi they\r\noccasionally spoke in public. Dio Cassius[829] states that Tiberius\r\nGracchus brought his mother and children into a contio to join their\r\nentreaties with his; and according to Valerius Maximus[830] a tribune of\r\nthe plebs required Sempronia, sister of the Gracchi, to come forward in a\r\nsimilar meeting and give her opinion on the subject under consideration.\r\nIn the year 43 some ladies attended a contio to protest against being\r\ntaxed by the triumvirs. Hortensia spoke for the complainants.[831]\r\nIt was an accepted custom that no tribune should intercede against a\r\nmeasure till an opportunity had been afforded private persons to speak\r\nfor or against it.[832] When after the victory of Pydna a tribune of the\r\nplebs had introduced a motion to grant a triumph to Aemilius Paulus,\r\nand the debate had been thrown open to the assembly, all for a time\r\nremained silent, for no doubt was entertained as to its passing; but\r\nfinally Servius Galba, who as a military tribune had served under Paulus\r\nand was his enemy, came forward and obstructed the measure by a long\r\nharangue.[833] Although the president could, and perhaps often did, throw\r\nthe debate open to the citizens in this way, he was not compelled to\r\ndo so. The tribunician assembly was more deliberative than any other—a\r\ncircumstance which accounts for its designation as a concilium.[834]\r\nThose invited to speak, if citizens, had to be of good standing and not\r\nunder disqualification through a special law or usage. The rex sacrorum\r\nwas prohibited not only from holding any other office but also from\r\naddressing an assembly.[835] The spendthrift[836] and the man condemned\r\nfor extortion[837] were likewise forbidden. When the right was granted\r\nas a special distinction, the receiver was probably placed thereby on a\r\nfooting of equal dignity with the magistrates.[838]\r\n\r\nThe president could also compel a citizen to speak. The holder of the\r\nimperium had a right to summon any man into a public meeting, and order\r\nhim to answer any question put to him.[839] Tribunes of the plebs,\r\nhowever, who lacked the power of summoning, exercised this coercive\r\nfunction against citizens and even consuls, not through a direct right\r\nbut by a usurpation, probably based on their power to arrest and\r\nimprison.[840]\r\n\r\nThe president extended permission by asking a man to give his opinion\r\non the subject under discussion, and it was not in good order even\r\nfor a magistrate to address the assembly unless invited, though he\r\nhad ground for resentment if he was passed over in favor of private\r\npersons.[841] When Caesar as consul, 59, brought his agrarian bill\r\nbefore the comitia without the consent of the senate and in spite of its\r\nsilent disapproval,[842] he first asked his colleague whether he had\r\nany objection to the proposal. Bibulus offered none but declared that\r\nhe would allow no innovation during his consulship. Thereupon Caesar\r\nbegged him for support, and requested the people to join in the entreaty,\r\nsaying, “You will have the law on the sole condition that he is willing.”\r\nThen Bibulus, answering in a loud voice, “You will not have this law the\r\npresent year, even if all of you want it,” left the assembly. Slighting\r\nthe other magistrates, Caesar invited Pompey and Crassus to address the\r\nmeeting, though they were but senators and therefore, as contrasted with\r\nmagistrates, merely private citizens. After Pompey had spoken at length,\r\ncommending the details of the law, Caesar asked if he would support it\r\nagainst opponents, at the same time requesting the people to beg of him\r\nthis favor. They did so, doubtless by acclamation; and Pompey, greatly\r\nflattered because the consul and the people besought help of him, a\r\nprivate citizen, promised to stand by the law.[843]\r\n\r\nA magistrate spoke from the platform, a private person from a lower\r\nposition, presumably from one of the steps; for the chairman to\r\nbring a private speaker upon the stage was a cause of offence to his\r\ncolleagues.[844] When the president granted an opportunity to speak,\r\nhe had a right to fix the amount of time to be used. In the debate on\r\nthe law for assigning provinces to Caesar and Pompey, 55, the presiding\r\ntribune granted one hour to Favorinus and two hours to Cato, both\r\nopponents of the measure.[845] The speaker could use the time in whatever\r\nway he pleased; a few persons by concert might waste the whole day in\r\ntrivialities, as is sometimes done in the senate of the United States of\r\nAmerica, so as to prevent voting on the subject for that date. In the\r\ncase above mentioned Favorinus, doubtless for lack of real argument,\r\nexhausted his hour in lamentation over the shortness of the time allowed\r\nhim,[846] and Cato spent his two hours on irrelevant or minor matters,\r\nmerely that he might be silenced by the president while still appearing\r\nto have something to say. He persisted in speaking accordingly till an\r\nofficer dragged him from the rostra and ejected him from the Forum. Even\r\nthen he returned several times to interrupt the proceedings with his\r\nshouting.[847] If the speaker approved the measure, he might close with\r\nthe words, “This law of yours and your purpose and sentiments I praise\r\nand most heartily approve”;[848] or more formally, “In my opinion this\r\nbill as presented ought to be passed, and may it prove well, auspicious,\r\nand fortunate both to yourselves and to the republic”;[849] or if opposed\r\nto the proposition, he might conclude with this form of disapproval, “It\r\nis my judgment that this law should by no means be repealed.”[850]\r\n\r\nSometimes the magistrates were invited in the order of their rank and\r\nafterward private citizens; in other cases, especially in tribunician\r\ncontiones, private persons were called first that they might speak with\r\nperfect freedom, uninfluenced by the opinion of their magistrates.[851]\r\nAs the president had absolute control, he could alter the usage to suit\r\nhis own interest, and could certainly reserve to himself the advantage\r\nof speaking last.[852] It often happened that there was not enough time\r\nin one day for the discussion of a question. In that case the magistrate\r\nadjourned the meeting to a specified date.[853]\r\n\r\nAfter the deliberation, or after the formality of opening the contio\r\nwhich was merely preliminary to the comitia, the president ordered the\r\nassembly to form into voting groups—curiae, centuries, or tribes. He\r\ncould say, for instance, “I order you to take your proper places in the\r\ncomitia centuriata,”[854] or more generally, “If you think fit, quirites,\r\nmove apart (into your voting groups).”[855] At the same time he ordered\r\nthe departure of all who lacked the qualification for voting.[856] The\r\nlictors of the magistrates with imperium and the beadle (viator) of the\r\ntribune attended to clearing away the unqualified.[857]\r\n\r\n    Schulze, C.

In its earliest known\r\nform the European popular assembly had the following characteristics,\r\nprovisionally enumerated here, but established in the next chapter: (1)\r\nthe people who attended were the mass of freemen of a tribe, especially\r\nthe warriors; (2) they stood or sat promiscuously, without reference\r\nto sub-tribal groups; (3) measures were proposed by none but chiefs\r\nor nobles, generally after previous discussion in council, the common\r\nmembers wholly lacking initiative; (4) the speakers were as a rule,\r\nthough not exclusively, chieftains; (5) the vote was by acclamation,\r\nthe clash of weapons, or some similar demonstration; as a correlate of\r\n(3) and (4) may be added, (6) sovereignty, so far as the idea existed,\r\nresided not in the assembly, which of itself could take no action, but\r\nin the king and chieftains, who made use of the assembly (_a_) for the\r\npublication of news or of projects, (_b_) for securing by their eloquence\r\nthe coöperation of the tribe in a plan already formed in council. However\r\nfar developed beyond this crude institution the comitia curiata or the\r\ncomitia centuriata of the republican period may have been, traces of all\r\nthe characteristics above mentioned may be found in the historical Roman\r\nassembly[858]—a fact which justifies the comparative method of approach\r\nto the subject.\r\n\r\nWe need not hesitate to begin with the unorganized contio as the\r\nearliest form of Roman assembly, to which we may attach the other\r\nfeatures of the European gathering named above. The first problem is to\r\ndetermine under what influence and for what purpose the gathering of\r\nthe people came to be organized in curiae. The notion that the object\r\nwas primarily for voting is groundless. The Athenians had the germ of a\r\ntribal assembly in the division of the people by phylae on the occasion\r\nof ostracophory[859] and of the passing of other privilegia (νόμοι ἐπ’\r\nἀνδρί). The organization was not in this case for the purpose of using\r\nthe tribes as voting units, but merely for bringing order and solemnity\r\nto the proceeding. Apparently the assembly of Alamanni was arrayed in\r\nmilitary form for ratifying emancipations,[860] though in the process the\r\nmilitary companies did not vote as units. In like manner, but for a wider\r\nrange of functions, we find at Rome the meeting of the people in curiae,\r\nless frequently in centuries, merely for listening, for witnessing, or\r\nfor receiving purification. The circumstances that the business of such\r\nassemblies was largely religious, and of such a character that it must\r\nhave originated in the earliest Roman times, and that in the greater\r\nnumber of cases these gatherings were under sacerdotal presidency suggest\r\nthat the sacerdotes, particularly the pontiffs, introduced the curiate\r\norganization from the army to make their religious meetings more orderly\r\nand dignified.[861]\r\n\r\nAll assemblies which met under pontifical presidency for religious\r\npurposes were called calata,[862] evidently from “calare,” a verb which\r\nmust originally have been in common use in the sense of “to call,” but\r\nwhich in historical time was restricted to the technical language of\r\nthe sacerdotes.[863] In the latter connection it designates the peculiar\r\nmethod of summoning used by the pontiffs.[864] Probably, at least in\r\nearlier time, their calatores acted as curiate lictors in convoking the\r\ncalata comitia curiata,[865] over which they presided. In all meetings\r\nof the kind in the regal period the people were grouped in curiae; under\r\nthe republic the centuriata comitia calata were also used for certain\r\npurposes.[866] The usual meeting-place of the calata comitia curiata\r\nwas in front of the curia Calabra on the Capitoline Hill.[867] With\r\nreference to their object, they may be classed as non-voting and voting;\r\nthe former were purely religious, the latter were for the settlement\r\nof questions which were in part civil.[868] First to be noted of the\r\nnon-voting assemblies were those in which the people gathered in comitia\r\nunder the presidency of the king,[869] in the republic under the rex\r\nsacrorum, to hear the proclamation of the fasti. On the calends of each\r\nmonth a pontifex minor, as clerk of the college,[870] announced to them\r\non what day, whether the fifth or seventh, the nones would come.[871] On\r\nthe nones the king again summoned the people to hear the calendar of the\r\nmonth,[872] read probably by the same pontifex minor. This custom fell\r\ninto disuse with the publication of the calendar in the Forum, beginning\r\nin 304.[873]\r\n\r\nEqually passive were those comitia calata which under the presidency of\r\nthe supreme pontiff witnessed the inauguration of the three flamines\r\nmaiores,[874] probably of the king in the regal period, and certainly\r\nof the rex sacrorum under the republic.[875] As warlike Mars had his\r\nshrines outside the pomerium,[876] his chief temple being in the Campus\r\nMartius,[877] it is a probable conclusion that his flamen was inaugurated\r\nthere—in the regal period in some form of military assembly, under the\r\nrepublic in the comitia centuriata.[878] The inaugural ceremonies were\r\nperformed by an augur;[879] in the case of the sacerdotes it was the\r\nsupreme pontiff who requested this service of him,[880] whereas the king\r\ncould doubtless command an augur without the coöperation of the pontiff.\r\nA closely related function was the appointment of Vestals by lot, under\r\nthe conduct of the supreme pontiff in a public assembly, probably the\r\ncalata comitia.[881] The destatio sacrorum and the abjuration of social\r\nrank, other acts which these comitia merely witnessed, will be considered\r\nin connection with the transitio ad plebem and the adrogatio.[882] The\r\nceremonies attended to by the rex sacrorum on March 24 and again on May\r\n24 may have been in comitia calata, though this is doubtful.[883]\r\n\r\nAssemblies of the people were organized in curiae by the pontiffs for\r\nthe religious purposes mentioned above, while political measures, so\r\nfar as submitted to the people, continued for a time, we may suppose,\r\nto be decided by din in contiones. But when a desire for a more precise\r\nvote began to be felt, the curiate organization naturally offered itself\r\nas most convenient for the purpose. The contention that in primitive\r\nRome, as among other early peoples,[884] the assembly expressed its\r\nfeeling or opinion by noisy demonstration finds strong support in the\r\nmost probable derivation of suffragium, “vote,” which connects it with\r\nfrangere, fragor, “a breaking,” “crash,” “din,” “applause,”[885] the\r\nprefix sub- expressing the dependence of the action upon the proposal\r\nof the speaker, as in the military succlamare, succlamatio.[886] We\r\nmay well believe that even after the organization of the assembly as\r\ncomitia—that is, in curiate, centuriate, or tribal divisions[887]—the\r\nvoting within the component groups continued for a time to be by din,\r\nas is suggested by the phrase sex suffragia, applied to the six oldest\r\ngroups of knights in the comitia centuriata.[888] Voting by heads in\r\nlarge gatherings is in fact a slow, cumbersome process, the product of a\r\nwell-developed political life. In all probability it originated in the\r\ncenturiate assembly—in which the military array facilitated the taking of\r\nindividual opinion[889]—and afterward extended to the other comitia. This\r\nline of reasoning suggests that when in the regal period a desire began\r\nto be felt for a more precise vote, and the curiate organization readily\r\noffered itself for the purpose, the expedient was adopted of taking the\r\nvote of each curia in order by din and then of deciding the question at\r\nissue by a majority of the thirty curial votes.[890] There can be little\r\ndoubt that this step also was first taken by the pontiffs.\r\n\r\nThe testamentary calata comitia met twice a year, probably on fixed\r\ndays.[891] It has been a disputed question whether the oldest form of\r\ntestament here referred to required a vote of the people. Rubino[892]\r\nstrongly upheld the negative on the ground (1) of analogy with the\r\nprocedure in inaugurations, (2) of analogy with other forms of testament,\r\nnone of which required a vote, (3) of the word testamentum itself, which\r\nrefers to witnessing, (4) of the conviction that the patricians would\r\nnot leave to the popular assembly the making of private law, (5) on the\r\nauthority of Theophilus,[893] who mentions the people’s witnessing of the\r\ntestament, (6) on the statement of Gellius[894] that wills of the kind\r\nwere made “in populi contione.” Against this reasoning may be urged (1)\r\nthe analogy from the adrogatio, (2) the analogy from the testamentary\r\nadoption, to both of which cases the simple testament was similar, and\r\nboth of which required a vote of the people,[895] (3) the consideration\r\nthat the act of witnessing in the assembly did not necessarily exclude a\r\nvote, (4) the statement of Gaius[896] that calata comitia were convoked\r\n“for making”—not for witnessing—testaments, (5) the circumstance that\r\nthe contio was often a preliminary stage of the voting assembly[897] in\r\naddition to the fact that pontifical language applies the term to comitia\r\nin general.[898] These arguments offset all the points offered by Rubino,\r\nunless it be the fourth, which is a purely subjective consideration.\r\nArguments (1), (2), and (4) are especially effective for establishing\r\nthe fact of a vote in the case under consideration. But the problem\r\ncan be most satisfactorily solved (6) by comparative investigation. In\r\nthe constitution of the early Indo-European family the estate belonged\r\njointly to all the male members, and for that reason could not be given\r\naway by the pater.[899] The primitive Germans accordingly made no wills,\r\nbut left their property to their children, or in failure of children to\r\nthe near kin.[900] In Attica the right to bequeath was instituted by\r\na law of Solon, which allowed it to those only who had no legitimate\r\nsons;[901] in Sparta the right was introduced by Epitadeus, perhaps\r\nearly in the fourth century B.C.[902] Testaments were unknown in Gortyn\r\nat the time when the _Twelve Tables_ of this city were published,[903]\r\nand similar conditions existed in other states of Greece.[904] The rule\r\nholds, too, for ancient India.[905] The Slavic householder could not\r\nalienate his land without the consent of the community.[906] As there is\r\nno reason to assume a more advanced condition for primitive Rome, we may\r\nconclude that, as indicated above, the calata comitia not only witnessed\r\nbut ratified testaments.[907]\r\n\r\nMommsen has attempted to fix these days as March 24 and May 24,[908] on\r\nwhich the rex sacrificulus performed comitial ceremonies not clearly\r\ndescribed by the sources.[909] He admits, however, that the testamentary\r\ncomitia met under the pontifex maximus rather than under the rex\r\nsacrorum[910]—a fact directly opposed to his contention. We should be\r\nsurprised also to find the testamentary days so close together.[911]\r\nBut the most effective argument against his view is that this function\r\nperformed by the rex sacrorum could not have been the holding of\r\ncomitia, for the time during which it continued was nefas.[912] The\r\nancient authorities state that “the sacrificial king, after performing\r\nsacred rites, comes into, or makes a sacrifice in (venit or litat), the\r\ncomitium,”[913] but they do not mention an assembly; hence we may infer\r\nthat in the fasti for these days reference is to some other function than\r\nthe holding of comitia. The form of testament above described fell early\r\ninto disuse,[914] so that the conditions and ceremonies attending it\r\nbecame a subject of study for antiquarians.\r\n\r\nAdoptions ordinarily came before the praetor. The legal object was\r\nthe perpetuation of the family and its religion. The law granted the\r\nprivilege accordingly to those only who had no children and who were\r\nincapable of having children. It required further that the act should not\r\nimperil the continuance of the family from whom the adopted came.[915]\r\nAdrogatio was the adoption of a person who was his own master and who\r\naccordingly consented to pass under the paternal power of another.\r\nThe word signifies that the act to which it applies required a vote\r\nof the people.[916] It was not undertaken rashly or without careful\r\nconsideration.[917] The persons concerned were required first to present\r\nthe case to the college of pontiffs, who took into account “what reason\r\nany one has for adopting children, what considerations of family or\r\ndignity are involved, what principles of religion are concerned.”[918]\r\nThe age of the man who wished to arrogate was considered—whether in this\r\nrespect he was capable of having children of his own, and care was taken\r\nthat the property of the arrogated person should not be insidiously\r\ncoveted.[919] The adrogator was asked whether he wished the candidate for\r\nadoption to be his real son, and the candidate was asked whether he would\r\nallow himself to be placed in this condition;[920] and the testimonies\r\nwere confirmed by an oath formulated by Q. Mucius Scaevola.[921]\r\n\r\nIf the pontiffs gave their consent, the case came before the comitia\r\ncuriata under the presidency of the chief of the college,[922] who put\r\nthe question in the following form: “Do you wish and order that L.\r\nValerius be the son of L. Titus by the same legal rights as if born\r\nof the father and mother of that family, and that the latter have the\r\npower of life and death over the former as a father over a son? This\r\norder I request of you, Romans, to grant, just as I have pronounced\r\nthe words.”[923] The curiae decided by vote.[924] At the same meeting\r\nthe arrogated son was required to declare that he forsook the religion\r\nof the family or gens of his birth—detestatio sacrorum[925]—and by a\r\nsimilar declaration the adrogator received him into the sacra of the new\r\nfamily.[926] This form of adoption could not apply to youths before they\r\nhad put on the manly gown, or to wards or women; for children and women\r\nhad no part in an assembly, and guardians were not allowed under any\r\ncircumstances to place their wards in the power of another.[927]\r\n\r\nA modification of adrogatio is testamentary adoption, of which the only\r\nwell-known case is that of Octavius, the heir of the dictator Caesar.\r\nOctavius came before a praetor with witnesses and formally accepted the\r\ninheritance;[928] afterward he was declared adopted by a vote of the\r\ncuriae.[929] As this case is nearly akin to the adrogatio, there can be\r\nno doubt that the vote was taken in the calata comitia under pontifical\r\npresidency.[930]\r\n\r\nDistinct from the adrogatio, though analogous to it, was the direct\r\npassing of individuals and of gentes from the patrician to the plebeian\r\nrank—transitio ad plebem. The motive was a desire to qualify for the\r\ntribunate of the plebs,[931] or more generally to widen the range of\r\none’s eligibility to office.[932] The history of the republic affords\r\nseveral instances of the transition of individuals;[933] and two plebeian\r\ngentes, the Octavia[934] and the Minucia,[935] boasted of having passed\r\nover from the patricians. Even if these boasts rest upon genealogical\r\nfalsifications,[936] the Romans thought such an act legally possible; and\r\nthey formulated a process applicable to every case whether of individuals\r\nor of gentes. It was through some other ceremony than the adrogatio, for\r\nthe latter could not apply to groups of persons. Clodius was following\r\nthe more general procedure here referred to when in the year 60 he\r\ntried to make himself a plebeian without recourse to adrogatio. First\r\nhe abdicated his nobility by an oath, probably taken in the comitia\r\ncalata;[937] then coming before an assembly of the plebs, he held himself\r\nready to receive plebeian rights through a resolution introduced by the\r\ntribune Herennius.[938] The process allowed the retention of the name,\r\nsacra, and all other privileges not dependent on the patriciate.[939]\r\nBut Metellus, the consul, objected that a curiate law was needed to\r\nmake the act valid, and the senate evidently agreed with him.[940]\r\nMetellus may have had in mind the transition through the adrogatio,\r\nwhich required a curiate law, or more probably he was thinking of a\r\nvote of the curiae in addition to the other formalities which Clodius\r\nwas passing through.[941] The complete process accordingly would have\r\nbeen the abjuration of the patriciate, confirmed by a curiate law, and\r\nthe reception of plebeian rights through a plebi scitum. Clodius was\r\nnot so foolish as to suppose that a process of transitio invented by\r\nhimself would prove acceptable to the senate and magistrates, and must\r\ntherefore have followed as closely as possible the formula which he\r\nbelieved to be legal. But when Metellus raised the objection, and when\r\nthe tribunes persisted in interceding against the plebi scitum,[942]\r\nhe yielded for the present, and in the following year had himself\r\narrogated by a plebeian named Fonteius, from whom he was forthwith\r\nemancipated.[943] This procedure, too, allowed him to retain the gentile\r\nname of his birth,[944] his imagines and sacra,[945] and consequently his\r\ninheritance. The oath taken in the calata comitia accordingly was not the\r\ndetestatio sacrorum usual in arrogations, but a form of declaration which\r\nreserved these privileges, with the understanding that in this case the\r\narrogatio was not for the customary object but to enable him to change\r\nhis rank.[946]\r\n\r\nAnalogous to the transitio ad plebem is the elevation of a plebeian to\r\nthe patrician rank. The Romans believed that eminent plebeians, including\r\nforeigners of distinction newly admitted to citizenship, were sometimes\r\ngranted the patriciate not only through the regal period but also in the\r\nopening years of the republic. For the republican age they represented\r\nthe bestowal as a double act, a resolution of the people followed by\r\ncoöptation into the senate.[947] In stating that the first consuls\r\nchose the best men from the commons, made them patricians, and with\r\nthem filled the senate to the number of three hundred, Dionysius[948]\r\napparently has in mind the consuls’ function of recruiting the senate\r\nbefore the Ovinian legislation,[949] together with their initiative in\r\ngranting the patriciate. The Roman view that the bestowal required a\r\nvote of the people is further proved by the procedure of Julius Caesar\r\nand of Octavianus in creating new patricians; for in this function\r\nthey doubtless followed tradition as nearly as possible. In 45 a\r\nplebi scitum,[950] proposed by L. Cassius Longinus and supported by a\r\nsenatus consultum,[951] empowered Caesar to recruit the patrician rank.\r\nOctavianus proceeded in a similar manner except that a consular law,[952]\r\napproved also by a senatus consultum,[953] was passed for the purpose.\r\nAs the object was religious, we may suppose that the qualifications of\r\nthe candidates were previously examined by the pontifical college. On the\r\nanalogy of the transitio ad plebem it may be assumed further that the\r\ncandidate abjured his plebeian rank in the calata comitia, which then\r\nconfirmed his declaration by vote.[954]\r\n\r\nBut whether the Romans were right in supposing patricians to have been\r\ncreated in the early republic has been doubted. Mommsen[955] takes the\r\nground that when the curiae ceased to be exclusively patrician, elevation\r\nto the rank became impossible, and that therefore no cases of the kind\r\noccurred after the fall of the kings. But in such a matter it is absurd\r\nto speak of impossibilities; everything was possible which the governing\r\npower approved, and the argument falls when its basis, the purely\r\npatrician state, has been removed.[956] The cessation was in fact due to\r\nthe growing exclusiveness of the patricians, who as they came to supplant\r\nthe king in the government, learned to value their privileged position so\r\nhighly they were unwilling longer to share it with others. Just when the\r\nclosing of their rank was effected has not been ascertained, but there\r\nis no good reason for rejecting the Roman view that for a time after the\r\nfall of the kings plebeians continued to be admitted: in reality the\r\nindications are strong for a relatively late closing.[957]\r\n\r\nWe may next inquire how patricians were created in the time of the\r\nkings. As the history of the regal period is in general a reconstruction\r\nwith material drawn from later time, so in this particular case ancient\r\nwriters sometimes date back to the age of the kings the usage of the\r\nrepublic. Dionysius[958] accordingly states that “the Romans by vote\r\ntransferred Servius Tullius from the plebeian to the patrician order,\r\njust as they had previously transferred Tarquin the Elder and still\r\nearlier Numa Pompilius.” But the Romans preferred to reconstruct the\r\nprocess on an entirely different principle. Regarding the kings as the\r\nfounders of all the fundamental institutions, the patricians looked upon\r\ntheir superior rank as a gift of these monarchs. The patriciate depended\r\nupon senatorial membership, which was at the disposal of the kings.[959]\r\nThis view is well adapted to explain the creation of the senate; but\r\nfor the period after its establishment Livy[960] adds to the adlectio\r\nof the king a coöptatio by the patres (senators). Livy’s account of the\r\nusage here given is reasonable; the king indicated his preference as\r\nto the choice of advisers, but a powerful council, such as the senate\r\nmust have been, at least in the later regal period, would have the final\r\ndecision on the question of admitting a new member. The conclusion is\r\nthat toward the end of the monarchy, if not from the beginning, plebeians\r\nwere admitted to the senate, and through it to the patriciate, by the\r\ncoöperation of the king and the senate, the people having nothing to do\r\nwith the matter.[961] But after the overthrow of the monarchy the vote of\r\nthe people was substituted for the will of the king, coöptation by the\r\nsenate continuing as before.[962]\r\n\r\nThe patriciate was acquired not only through bestowal by the state, but\r\nalso through the adoption of a plebeian into a patrician family. Several\r\ncases of the kind have been ascertained.[963] The act took place before\r\nthe praetor[964] and did not concern the comitia. Probably a preliminary\r\nexamination by the pontiffs was necessary to adoptions as well as to\r\narrogations.[965]\r\n\r\n    Rubino, J., _Röm.

The usual tendency\r\nof development was toward the abridgment of popular powers to the\r\nadvantage of the nobles or of the king;[966] but in some instances may be\r\ndiscovered a growth in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nGenerally the assembly did not have fixed times of meeting but convened\r\nonly when called by the king or chiefs. This is known to be true of the\r\nHomeric Greeks,[967] of the Slavs,[968] and of the Romans,[969] and may\r\nbe regarded as the more primitive condition. In addition to extraordinary\r\nsessions the German assembly acquired the right to meet regularly twice\r\na month at fixed times[970]—a right which gave the people a valuable\r\npolitical advantage. In like manner the Lacedaemonians met once a\r\nmonth;[971] the Athenians probably once a prytany (tenth of a year) after\r\nCleisthenes, and certainly four times a prytany after Pericles.[972] The\r\nCeltic assemblies convened annually or triennially at fixed seasons.[973]\r\nAmong all these peoples, however, subjects for consideration were\r\npresented by none but the king or chief, the assembly itself being\r\nwholly without initiative. Such subjects were as a rule previously\r\ndiscussed in a council of chiefs or nobles.[974] The person who summoned\r\nthe assembly naturally made the first speech, which explained the purpose\r\nof the meeting and the character of the subject to be considered. If\r\nit was an enterprise in which he desired the support or coöperation\r\nof the community, he attempted to rouse for it the enthusiasm of his\r\nhearers.[975] The discussion might then be continued by the chiefs or any\r\nothers distinguished for age, military prowess, or eloquence.[976] Among\r\nthe Germans, who possessed more than the average degree of liberty, any\r\none spoke who could gain a hearing; in the Homeric assembly a commoner\r\nwho dared lift up his voice against king or noble was liable to severe\r\nchastisement as a disorderly person;[977] and conditions at Rome, as well\r\nas in Etruria,[978] seem to have been equally unfavorable to the ordinary\r\nfreeman.\r\n\r\nA considerable variety of business came before the assembly. It might\r\nbe summoned to hear the announcement of news of interest to the\r\ncommunity,[979] the reading of the calendar for the month,[980] the\r\ndeclaration of a policy or opinion by a king or chief,[981] or for\r\nwitnessing acts affecting the interests of the community.[982] More\r\nimportant were judicial cases,[983] questions of war and peace,[984] and\r\nelections.[985]\r\n\r\nThe problem as to the relative power of the king and council on the one\r\nhand and of the assembly on the other is difficult. It was a disadvantage\r\nto the people, over and above their lack of initiative, to have no means\r\nof precisely expressing their will. The Greeks signified their approval\r\nby acclamation,[986] the Germans by clashing their weapons,[987] and the\r\nCelts by both;[988] either demonstration aimed to express, not the will\r\nof the majority,[989] but the intensity of conviction on the part of the\r\nassembly as a whole. It lacked as well the means of legally enforcing its\r\nwill.[990] The Achaeans in assembly approved the petition of Chryses,\r\na suppliant priest; nevertheless King Agamemnon rejected it.[991] After\r\nthe people had divided the spoils of war, Agamemnon seized the prize\r\nthey had given another.[992] The Trojans were ready to surrender Helen\r\nfor the sake of peace; but Priam, to gratify his son, refused, and the\r\nwar went on.[993] In his relations with individuals the king often acted\r\nunjustly and tyrannically. Even in affairs which concerned the entire\r\ncommunity he might take large liberty. Without consulting the assembly he\r\ncould count on the support of the people in a war of defence. Treaties\r\nof peace, which were often guest-friendships and intermarriages between\r\nroyal families,[994] did not come before the people for ratification as a\r\nright, but only in cases in which their pledge seemed necessary for the\r\nprevention of private warfare. The right of the magistrate to conclude\r\npeace with or without discussion in the council or senate was recognized\r\nby the states of Italy as late as the Second Samnite war.[995] The\r\nking might even declare an offensive war on his own responsibility, if\r\nwithout consulting the people he could feel sure of their support.[996]\r\nEnterprises requiring their coöperation he usually submitted to them\r\nto win their approval, as he had no means of coercing the entire\r\ncommunity. His independence of the assembly increased with the growth\r\nof heredity. The idea of sovereignty, strictly speaking, was unknown to\r\nprimitive times; yet so far as people thought of political power, they\r\nassigned it to the king and council.[997] Nevertheless the fact of the\r\nassembly’s existence and the need of eloquence for persuading it prove\r\nit to have been a real force. The suppression of the German assembly\r\nor the prohibition of carrying arms to the meeting was looked upon as\r\nintolerable tyranny.[998] For the disturbance of an Irish assembly the\r\npenalty was death.[999] Public opinion was a check on royalty,[1000] and\r\nin extreme cases the people rebelled and killed their king.[1001]\r\n\r\nThe strengthening of the kingship naturally tended to weaken the\r\nassembly. The Lacedaemonian kings had a right to make war on whatever\r\nstate they pleased, and any citizen who obstructed this power was\r\naccursed;[1002] if, too, in anything the people gave a wrong decision,\r\nthe kings and council could set it right.[1003] Under the Frankish\r\nmonarchy the general assembly seems to have entirely disappeared\r\nin the sixth century A.D., to be revived in the latter part of the\r\nseventh,[1004] in a form which took little account of the commons.[1005]\r\nIn the other Germanic tribes which entered the Empire the effect of the\r\nmigration was to strengthen the king and to weaken in a corresponding\r\ndegree the power of the people.[1006] In Russia Tartar domination,\r\nconverting the legitimate princes into tyrants, effected the downfall of\r\nthe assemblies.[1007] The building up of large states, too, necessarily\r\ndegrades or destroys popular gatherings.[1008]\r\n\r\nThe heritage of the Roman assembly from the earlier tribal time must\r\nhave been slight as well as vague—a heritage diminished further by the\r\ngrowing power of the king and nobles. The assumption has often been\r\nmade that from the beginning the Roman assembly was sovereign. The view\r\nrests in part, however, on a confusion of two ideas which should be kept\r\ndistinct. In its broadest sense populus designates the state, which is\r\nsovereign whether it expresses its will through the king, the senate,\r\nor the popular assembly, or through the concurrence of two or more of\r\nthese elements. In interstate relations it always has this meaning.\r\nMore narrowly populus signifies the masses of citizens in contrast with\r\nthe magistrates or with the senate.[1009] In the latter sense it cannot\r\nbe said that the populus was from the beginning sovereign. The Romans\r\nthemselves of later time understood that in the regal period the senate\r\nhad the wisdom to advise, the king possessed the imperium, whereas the\r\npeople enjoyed but a limited degree of freedom, right, and power.[1010]\r\nTheir condition was not liberty but a preparation for it.[1011] Their\r\nassembly, like that of other early Europeans, had no power of initiative;\r\nit met only when summoned by the king, and could consider those matters\r\nonly which the king brought before it. Its object must have been chiefly\r\nto receive information and to witness acts of public importance. In no\r\ncase did the king call upon the assembly for advice; counsel belonged\r\nexclusively to the wise elders, who composed the senate;[1012] and should\r\nhe wish to instruct the people in the merits of a proposed measure,\r\nhe would himself address them and perhaps invite the most respected\r\nsenators or his most trustworthy supporters among the private citizens\r\nto give the masses the benefit of their wisdom.[1013] In other than\r\njudicial assemblies the privilege of speaking must have been sparingly\r\ngranted.[1014] Finally no elective or legislative act of the curiae was\r\nvalid without the authorization of the senate (patrum auctoritas).[1015]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the specific rights of the assembly, Dionysius[1016]\r\nstates that Romulus granted the commons three prerogatives, (1) to elect\r\nmagistrates, (2) to ratify laws, (3) to decide concerning war, whenever\r\nthe king should refer the matter to them. Livy’s[1017] stricture on the\r\nabsolutism of Tarquin the Proud implies, too, that constitutionally\r\nthe assembly should have had power to decide on peace and war. But\r\nstress should be laid on the admission of Dionysius that probably all\r\nthe questions above enumerated, or at least those of peace and war,\r\nwere referred to the assembly at the pleasure only of the king—that the\r\ndecision of them was not a right of the people, but a concession on the\r\npart of the sovereign.[1018] Still more important, these generalizations\r\nare in great part invalidated, as Rubino[1019] has shown, by the\r\ntestimony of their authors. When either refers to individual cases of\r\ntreaty-making under the kings, he never connects the assembly with the\r\nproceedings.[1020] It is significant, too, that the formula of treaty\r\nmakes the king the only actor, taking no account of the people.[1021]\r\nUsually peace continued merely through the lifetime of the king who\r\ncontracted it,[1022] but a truce for a definite period was binding to\r\nthe end, even after his death.[1023] Under the republic to the time\r\nof the decemvirs the treaty-making power resided in the consuls and\r\nsenate.[1024] Ordinarily either a senatus consultum empowered the\r\nmagistrates to use their discretion[1025] or sanctioned the agreement\r\nwhen made.[1026] More rarely the senate treated directly with ambassadors\r\nfrom the enemy.[1027] The clamor of the plebeians sometimes prevailed\r\nupon the senate to negotiate for peace;[1028] and at other times it\r\nwas merely by accident that the people heard of the conclusion of a\r\ntreaty.[1029] After the decemviral legislation the plebeian assembly\r\nof tribes slowly acquired the right of ratification;[1030] in fact\r\nit was not till the Second Samnite war that their vote came to be\r\nessential.[1031] Among the archives devoted to treaties and alliances,\r\naccordingly, senatus consulta and plebiscites alone are mentioned.[1032]\r\nThe very fact that in the later republic the ratification of treaties\r\nbelonged exclusively to the tribal assembly[1033] proves that it was an\r\nacquired right of the people; for we may set it down as a fixed principle\r\nthat the curiae and the centuries yielded none of their prerogatives to\r\nthe tribes.[1034]\r\n\r\nAs regards the right of the people to declare war a distinction must\r\nbe drawn between defensive wars, which, admitting neither choice nor\r\ndelay,[1035] could not be referred to their decision, and aggressive\r\nwars, which were in the option of the state to undertake or avoid. Yet\r\neven in the case of offensive wars, though the approval of the people was\r\ndoubtless often sought, they exercised under the kings and in the early\r\nrepublic no real right. When the king or magistrate felt that Rome had\r\nsuffered injury from a neighboring state, he despatched an ambassador to\r\nseek reparation. If the demand was not complied with, the ambassador,\r\ncalling Jupiter and the other gods to witness the injustice, added: “But\r\nwe shall consult the elders in our own country concerning these matters,\r\nto determine in what way we may obtain justice.” When the messenger had\r\nreturned to Rome and had made his report, the king consulted the senate\r\nsubstantially in these words: “Concerning such matters, differences, and\r\ndisagreements as the pater patratus of the Roman people, the quirites,\r\nhas conferred with the pater patratus of the ancient Latins and of the\r\nancient Latin peoples—which matters ought to be given up, performed,\r\ndischarged, but which they have neither given up nor performed nor\r\ndischarged—declare,” said he to the senator whose opinion he wished first\r\nto obtain, “what you think.” Then the elder thus questioned replied,\r\n“I think the demand should be enforced by a just and pious war; and\r\ntherefore I consent to it and vote for it.” Then the rest were asked\r\nin order, and when a majority agreed in this opinion, war was thereby\r\nvoted.[1036] In all this account there is no mention of the people; but\r\nafterward when the fetialis reached the border of the enemy’s country,\r\nand pronounced the formula for the declaration of war, he included a\r\nstatement that the populus Romanus had ordered it: “Forasmuch as the\r\npopulus Romanus of the quirites have ordered that there should be war\r\nwith the ancient Latins, and the senate of the populus Romanus of the\r\nquirites have given their opinion, consented, etc., I and the populus\r\nRomanus declare and make war on the peoples of the ancient Latins.”[1037]\r\nIn this connection, as in all formulae applying to international\r\nrelations, populus means not the assembly but the state; hence the use\r\nof the word cannot be taken as evidence of the existence of a popular\r\nright to declare war.[1038] Besides this formula we have in support of\r\nsuch a right the general statement only of Dionysius and the implied\r\nidea of Livy, referred to above,[1039] neither of which is in itself of\r\nespecial weight. On the other hand the individual kings seem to have\r\nbeen free to make war at their discretion. The fact that peace and war\r\nare represented as depending upon the character and inclinations of the\r\nking[1040] further establishes the real view of the Roman historians.\r\nIn a succeeding chapter[1041] it will be made clear that not till 427\r\ndid the centuriate assembly acquire the right to declare an aggressive\r\nwar; probably not till some time afterward was this right established as\r\ninalienable. Previous to that date the warriors, perhaps in a contio,\r\nwere occasionally called on to give their approval, doubtless, as has\r\nbeen explained above,[1042] to increase their enthusiasm for the war.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the legislative activity of the assembly under\r\nthe kings, it is necessary to call attention to the fact that among\r\nall peoples in the earlier stages of their growth law is chiefly\r\ncustomary.[1043] At the time of her founding Rome inherited from the\r\nLatin stock, to which her people mainly belonged, a mass of private and\r\npublic customs, which, owing their existence to no legislative power,\r\nwere the result of gradual evolution. Under such conditions, as in\r\nHomeric Greece, the king or chief settled disputes in accordance with\r\nthese usages, though in the general belief his individual judgments\r\ncame directly to him from some god. The Homeric king received his\r\ndooms—θέμιστες—and even his thoughts from the gods.[1044] The mythical or\r\nsemi-mythical legislators of Greece, as Minos, Lycurgus, and Zaleucus,\r\nwere given their laws by revelation. In like manner Numa, who may be\r\nconsidered a typical legislator for primitive Rome,[1045] received\r\nhis sacred laws and institutions from the goddess Egeria;[1046] and\r\nRomulus, the first great law-giver,[1047] was a demi-god, who passed\r\nwithout dying to the dwelling-place of the immortals.[1048] Roughly\r\ndistinguished, Romulus was the author of the secular law, Numa of the\r\nsacred.[1049] In general the Romans of later time looked back to their\r\nkings, the founders of their state,[1050] as the authors not only\r\nof their fundamental laws and institutions but even of their moral\r\nprinciples.[1051] Doubtless the Roman view of the ancient king is an\r\nimage of the republican dictatorship, of the extraordinary magistratus\r\nrei publicae constituendae, of the consul freed from his various\r\nlimitations;[1052] but the picture, stripped of the distinctness which\r\ncame with the gradual formulation of constitutional usage, is, as\r\ncomparative study shows, true to the primitive condition which it aims to\r\nrepresent.\r\n\r\nFrom this early conception the idea of human legislation gradually\r\nemerged. Not daring on his own responsibility to change a traditional\r\nusage which the people held sacred, the magistrate found it expedient\r\nto obtain their consent to any serious departure,[1053] with a view not\r\nto legalizing the proposal, but to pledging the people to its practical\r\nadoption. When and how the primitive acclamation gave way to the orderly\r\nvote of the comitia curiata cannot be ascertained from the sources.[1054]\r\nAfter this stage was reached, the transaction between king and people\r\nhad the following form: “I ask you, quirites, whether you will consent\r\nto, and consider it right, that T. Valerius be a son to L. Titus as\r\nrightfully and legally as if born of the father and mother of the family\r\nof the latter, and that the latter have the power of life and death\r\nover the former as a father over his son. These (questions) in the form\r\nin which I have pronounced them, thus, quirites, I ask you.”[1055] The\r\nmagistrate brought his formulated request before the people (legem\r\nferre), who accepted it (legem accipere); the question (rogatio) was\r\ndirected not to the assembly as a whole but to the component citizens,\r\nwho individually replied ut rogas, “yes,” or antiquo, “no.”[1056]\r\nBy this procedure the citizens bound themselves to the acceptance of\r\nthe proposition on an oral promise, which was the strongest form of\r\nobligation known to them. Herein is involved the fundamental idea of lex,\r\nwhich was not a command addressed by the sovereign to the people or a\r\ncontract between ruler and ruled, but an obligation which the citizens\r\ntook upon themselves at the request of the magistrate.[1057] The verb\r\niubere, which designates the people’s part (populus iubet) in the passing\r\nof laws and resolutions, did not originally have the meaning “to order,”\r\nwhich belonged to it in the age of Cicero. Some have derived it from ius\r\nhabere, “to regard as right;”[1058] others from judh, an extension of\r\nthe root ju, “to bind.”[1059] In either case it seems to mean no more\r\nthan to accept or hold as right or as binding. In its widest sense lex\r\ndenotes any obligation which one party takes upon himself on the offer of\r\nanother. In this meaning it may apply to a business contract,[1060] in\r\nwhich alone the obligations are reciprocal, to the instruction imposed by\r\na superior magistrate upon an inferior,[1061] to the auspicium which the\r\nmagistrate formulates and the god accepts,[1062] to the ordinance which\r\nthe subject, without being consulted, receives willingly or unwillingly\r\nfrom the ruler (lex data),[1063] as well as to the statute established\r\nby the question of the magistrate and the affirmative answer of the\r\ncitizens (lex rogata). The leges of the community, with which alone the\r\npresent discussion is concerned, were distinguished as publicae.[1064]\r\nA lex of the kind was not necessarily general,[1065] but applied as\r\nreadily to an individual citizen[1066] as to the entire body, to a\r\ndeclaration of war,[1067] or the banishment of a citizen,[1068] as well\r\nas to a universal rule of conduct. In the earlier time the lex rogata, or\r\nsimply lex, seems to have designated any act of an assembly, elective or\r\njudicial as well as law-making in the modern sense.[1069] But in the time\r\nof Cicero it had come to mean any act of an assembly which was neither an\r\nelection nor a judicial decision,[1070] and in the latter sense the word\r\nis used in this volume.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of a proposition by the citizens obligated\r\nthemselves[1071] but not the government. The king, who retained office\r\nfor life and was irresponsible, could not be held amenable to law;\r\nagainst a tyrannical ruler the only resource was revolution. Although the\r\nrepublican magistrates possessed remarkably great power, as temporary\r\nfunctionaries they belonged to the people, along with whom they were\r\nbound by the laws.[1072]\r\n\r\nTo the end of the regal period the legislative activity of the people\r\nremained narrowly restricted. The body of leges regiae, described as\r\ncuriate by Pomponius[1073] on the supposition that they were passed by\r\nthe assembly under royal presidency,[1074] was little more than the ius\r\npontificum—the customary religious law—with whose making the curiae had\r\nnothing to do.[1075] If the king wished to admit new citizens,[1076]\r\nerect public works, levy forced labor on the citizens,[1077] reform the\r\nmilitary organization,[1078] punish a man with chains or death,[1079]\r\nmake a treaty, or even declare an offensive war, no power compelled him\r\nto submit the measure to the citizens. Although he must often have found\r\nit expedient to engage their coöperation in national enterprises, or more\r\nrarely in a legal innovation,[1080] it may be stated with confidence\r\nthat before the beginning of the republic the curiate assembly had not\r\nacquired the right to be consulted on any of these matters—that its\r\nslight activity in legislation and administration was a concession from\r\nthe king rather than a right; for under the republic such activity,\r\ngradually increasing, belonged to the centuries and the tribes. We may\r\naccept without hesitation the principle that in form if not in substance\r\nthe curiae retained all the powers which they had ever actually possessed.\r\n\r\nJudicial business, which no one has ever assumed to be a primitive\r\nfunction of the Roman assembly, needs no long consideration here. Among\r\nthe early Indo-Europeans the settlement of disputes and the punishment\r\nof most crimes were in the hands of the families and brotherhoods; only\r\ntreason and closely related offences were noticed by the state; and these\r\ncases were tried by the king in the presence of the assembly.[1081] The\r\nreligious ideas attaching to crime and punishment[1082] in early Rome\r\nsuggest that the priests had the same connection with these matters there\r\nas among the Celts and Germans. That condition yielded to the growing\r\nauthority of the king, who is represented by the ancients as wielding\r\nan absolute power of life and death over his people and as allowing in\r\ncapital cases an appeal to the assembly at his own discretion.[1083]\r\nFrom the general conception of the relation between king and assembly as\r\nestablished in this chapter, it is necessary to infer that if the people\r\nhad any claim to a share in the jurisdiction, it must have been slight as\r\nwell as vague, and one which they were in no position to enforce.\r\n\r\nA review of the individual kings might give the impression that an act\r\nof the assembly was unessential to filling the regal office. Not only\r\nwere Romulus and Tatius kings without election,[1084] but according to\r\nLivy[1085] Numa’s appointment was made by the senate alone; and Servius\r\nruled long and introduced his great reforms before his election.[1086]\r\nTarquin the Proud to the end of his reign was neither appointed by the\r\nsenate nor chosen by the people.[1087] From these four or five instances\r\nof kings who ruled without election, as well as from the fact that\r\nboth the dictatorship—a temporary return to monarchy—and the office\r\nof rex sacrorum—the priestly successor to the monarch—were filled by\r\nappointment, we might infer that the kingship was not elective.[1088]\r\nBut on the other hand the word interregnum, which could not have been\r\ninvented in the republican period and which involves the idea of\r\nelection, as well as the general custom of choosing kings among primitive\r\nEuropean peoples, may be added to the authority of our sources[1089]\r\nin favor of an elective monarchy in earliest Rome. The nomination of\r\nthe king by the competent person was perhaps acclaimed in a contio in\r\nsome such way as among the early Germans. Such an election, we may\r\nsuppose, was in the beginning legal without further action on the part\r\nof the people. But the accession of a king was a momentous event in the\r\nlife of a generation—far more important than the annual declaration of\r\nwar upon a neighbor—and the advantage of a formal vote of the curiate\r\nassembly, after its institution, was obvious both to the king and to the\r\nsacerdotes; it gave to the former the solemn oral pledge of obedience\r\nfrom the citizens, and to the latter an opportunity to influence the\r\nproceedings through the auspices and through the manipulation of the\r\ncalendar.\r\n\r\nUnder this system the king after his appointment by his predecessor or\r\nby the interrex, and after the acclamation in contio if such action took\r\nplace, convoked the curiae on the first convenient comitial day of his\r\nreign,[1090] having held favorable auspices in the morning, and proposed\r\nto them a rogation[1091] in some such form as the following: “Do you\r\nconsent, and regard it as just and legal, that I, whom the populus has\r\ndesignated king, should exercise imperium over you?” This rogation,\r\nanswered affirmatively by a majority of the curiae, became a lex curiata\r\nde imperio.[1092] The informal acclamation, if it was the custom, must\r\nhave disappeared in time, and the passing of the curiate law was looked\r\nupon as the election proper.[1093]\r\n\r\nConcessions to the people develop into popular rights. The citizens,\r\ndeeply interested in the choice of a man who for the remainder of his\r\nlife was to represent their community before the gods, lead them in war,\r\nand exercise over them the power of life and death, claimed as their\r\nfirst active political right the ius suffragii in the passing of this lex\r\ncuriata de imperio. Hence after the institution of the republic and of\r\nthe comitia centuriata, the curiae clung obstinately to this inalienable\r\nprerogative.[1094]\r\n\r\nThe development of the elective process outlined above is offered in\r\nexplanation of the curious phenomenon that under the republic, while\r\nall other acts of the centuriate and tribal assemblies required no\r\nconfirmation by the curiae, elections by these assemblies did require\r\nsuch a sanction. This explanation is the only one proposed which accords\r\nwith the Roman interpretation of the peculiarity. According to Cicero it\r\nwas provided that in the case of all elective magistrates the people\r\nshould vote twice on each that they might have an opportunity to correct\r\nwhat they had done, if they repented of having conferred an office on\r\nany person. In the case of the censors this second vote was cast in\r\nthe comitia centuriata; all other elective magistrates received it in\r\nthe curiate assembly.[1095] Rubino[1096] and others have objected that\r\nCicero’s interpretation of the curiate law is biassed by his desire\r\nto contrast the essentially antipopular character of the demagogue\r\nRullus,[1097] who by the terms of his agrarian law would deprive the\r\npeople of their right to vote even once in the election of officials,\r\nwith the wise and moderate statesmen of old, who were so devoted to the\r\npeople as to allow them two opportunities to express their choice in\r\nthe case of each magistrate. The orator, it is urged, could not himself\r\nknow the original intention of the usage; and his interpretation is\r\ncontradicted by the fact that the person who proposed the lex curiata\r\nwas already a magistrate, the voting on this lex being subsequent to the\r\nelection and forming no part of it.[1098]\r\n\r\nIn favor of Cicero’s interpretation it may in the first place be stated\r\nthat he was not simply offering a conjecture as to the original intention\r\nof the usage, but was interpreting the formula of the law as it existed\r\nin his own day. There would be no point to his interpretation unless the\r\nformula ran somewhat like that of an election; and he affirms definitely\r\nthat the law bestows the magistracy upon a person who has already\r\nreceived the same office from other comitia—that it is, in other words,\r\na second bestowal of the office.[1099] That this interpretation is not a\r\nmere invention of Cicero is proved by a statement of Messala[1100] that\r\nthe magistracy in the strict legal sense of the term is granted by the\r\ncuriate law. And the point maintained by Messala is further confirmed\r\nby that article of the agrarian rogation of P. Servilius Rullus which\r\nprovides that the decemviri agris adsignandis may, if necessary, dispense\r\nwith the curiate law and yet be “decemvirs in as legal a sense as are\r\nthose who hold the office according to the strictest law.”[1101] In other\r\nwords, the person who has been elected by the comitia centuriata or\r\ntributa is a magistratus, though not a magistratus iustus or optimo iure\r\n(optima lege); the completion of all formalities, ending with a second\r\nelection (by the curiae), is essential to the latter.\r\n\r\nOptimo iure requires explanation. It often signifies “with perfect\r\njustice,” “most deservedly.”[1102] Closely related to this meaning is\r\nthat of “perfect formality,” as in making a bequest[1103] or in creating\r\na sacerdos[1104] or a magistrate.[1105] In this sense optimo iure is\r\ninterchangeable with optima lege. Developed in another direction, either\r\nphrase readily gives the idea of completeness or perfection of title,\r\nnot only to property,[1106] but also to office.[1107] One who holds a\r\nperfect title to a property, or has been granted a civil status[1108]\r\nor an office[1109] in a perfectly legal way, necessarily enjoys all the\r\nimmunities, honors, and powers inherent in such absolute condition.\r\nTo indicate that due legality has been observed in the creation of a\r\nmagistrate, and that the latter has accordingly complete possession of\r\nhis office, and of all the honors and powers belonging to it, the phrase\r\nut qui optima lege sunt, erunt is often inserted in the formula of\r\nappointment or election. These words continued to be used, for example,\r\nin the creation of the dictator as long as his power remained absolute,\r\nbut after it became subject to appeal, they were dropped.[1110] The\r\nauthor of the act was at the same time author of the condition attaching\r\nto it expressed by the phrase under consideration: in the appointment\r\nof a dictator it was the consul; in the creation of a promagistrate or\r\nthe assignment of a province it might be the senate.[1111] Laws must\r\noften have contained provisions that the magistrates created under them\r\nshould be ut qui optima lege.[1112] The Servilian bill most probably\r\nincluded an article of the kind for the decemviri agris adsignandis\r\nto be elected under it. But as the title to an office was impaired\r\nby any informality in the elective process, and as Servilius foresaw\r\nthat the lex curiata might be prevented by tribunician intercession or\r\nother cause, he inserted in his bill a further provision, referred to\r\nabove,[1113] that the decemviri might be officials optima lege[1114] even\r\nwithout the curiate sanction. From what is here said it is clear that\r\nthe condition of iustus or optima lege was not obtained for a magistrate\r\nby the passing of the curiate act alone, but rather by due attention to\r\nall formalities,[1115] which were brought to completion by that act.\r\n\r\nThe formula for the curiate law, in addition to its resemblance to that\r\nfor elections, must have contained some reference to the imperium, as we\r\nmay infer from the frequent designation of the law as a lex de imperio\r\nby Cicero. From this phrase modern writers infer that the curiate act\r\nconferred the imperium upon newly elected magistrates. The question\r\nwhether it granted to a magistrate powers which he did not already\r\npossess will be considered below. For the present it is enough to state\r\nthat in no instance do the ancients speak of “conferring” the imperium by\r\nthe curiate law or of deriving the imperium from that law by any process\r\nwhatsoever. But mention is made of conferring the imperium by a decree of\r\nthe senate or by the suffrages of the people in the centuriate or tribal\r\nassembly[1116] and of _confirming_ it by the curiate law.[1117]\r\n\r\nThe consuls and the praetor were elected by the centuries, and their\r\nimperium was sanctioned by the curiae. The dictator, too, was obliged\r\nto carry a curiate law.[1118] But the quaestors, the curule aediles,\r\nand other inferior magistrates, after their election by the tribes, did\r\nnot themselves convoke the curiae for sanctioning their election; the\r\nlex was proposed in their behalf by a higher magistrate.[1119] As the\r\norigin of this custom we may suppose that the kings, and after them the\r\nhigher magistrates of the early republic, used to ask the people for a\r\npledge of loyalty not only to themselves but also to their assistants,\r\nand that this custom continued even after they had come to be elective\r\nmagistrates. To functionaries who lacked the imperium the expression lex\r\nde imperio could not apply; lex de potestate, though not occurring in our\r\nsources, would be the appropriate phrase.\r\n\r\nIt has generally been assumed that the curiate law bestowed a power\r\nin addition to that received through election.[1120] Something can in\r\nfact be said in favor of this view. We are told that the newly elected\r\nmagistrate could attend to no serious public business till he had secured\r\nthe passage of the act:[1121] till then the praetor could not undertake\r\njudicial business; the consul could have nothing to do with military\r\naffairs[1122] or hold comitia for the election of his successor.[1123]\r\nSome of Cicero’s contemporaries asserted that a magistrate who failed to\r\npass the law could not as promagistrate govern a province.[1124] Or if\r\nwithout a curiate law he made the attempt, he would be obliged to conduct\r\nthe administration at his own expense;[1125] and if as promagistrate\r\nhe gained a victory in war, he was denied a triumph.[1126] Under such\r\nconditions it might well be said that a magistrate could engage in no\r\nserious public business before he had carried for himself the sanctioning\r\nlaw. But practice diverged widely from these rules. An act containing a\r\nprovision for the election of functionaries might include a dispensing\r\nclause to the effect that the persons elected shall, in the lack of a\r\ncuriate law, “be magistrates in as legal a sense as those who are elected\r\naccording to the strictest forms of law.”[1127] Yet even without this\r\nspecial provision the magistrate regularly attended to much business\r\nbefore passing the law. The first public act of the consul, praetor,\r\nor other magistrate was to take the auspices, to determine whether his\r\nmagistracy was acceptable to the gods;[1128] and another auspication was\r\nheld for the meeting of the curiae.[1129] It was customary, too, for the\r\nconsul to make his vows to the Capitoline Jupiter and to hold a session\r\nof the senate, both of which acts had to be auspicated.[1130] These facts\r\ndisprove the theory that the curiate law conferred the auspicium. In the\r\nfirst session of the senate here mentioned not only religious affairs\r\nbut civil and military matters of great importance were discussed and\r\nfinally arranged, all of which business was regularly managed without a\r\ncuriate law.[1131] As to other administrative acts it is probable that\r\nthe want of a lex curiata never hindered the performance of necessary\r\nbusiness civil or military. In case of danger to the state the interrex,\r\nwho wholly lacked the curiate law, or the consul before passing the law\r\ncould doubtless take command of the army;[1132] and it is significant\r\nthat the unlimited imperium and iudicium were granted the magistrates\r\nnot by the curiae but by the senate.[1133] The law was indeed considered\r\nindispensable to the dictator in 310.[1134] It is generally assumed by\r\nthe moderns that C. Flaminius, consul in 217, lacked the law;[1135] their\r\nreason is the statement of Livy[1136] that he entered upon his office not\r\nat Rome but at Ariminum. The fact, however, that in this year he carried\r\na monetary statute before his departure for the war[1137] proves that he\r\nbegan his official duties at Rome, and that Livy’s tirade to the contrary\r\nis empty rhetoric. Probably because he departed without attending to the\r\nusual auspices, his political opponents were unwilling to admit that he\r\nhad entered on his office. But the army obeyed his command, his name\r\nremained in the fasti as consul, and his monetary law continued in force.\r\nLivy, while complaining at length of his failure to take the auspices,\r\nsays nothing of the curiate law. His silence is significant.[1138] We\r\ncannot be certain that the lex curiata was not passed in his case; but\r\nwe have no right to imagine that it was not and then draw far-reaching\r\ndeductions from our fancy.[1139]\r\n\r\nA more valuable instance is that of L. Marcius, elected propraetor by\r\nthe army in Spain in 212.[1140] Although he could not have had a lex\r\ncuriata, the senate, while censuring the election because it transferred\r\nthe auspices to the camp, did not make the want of the law a ground\r\nfor declaring the magistracy illegal.[1141] A still more famous case\r\nis that of the magistrates of the year 49, who with the Pompeian party\r\nfled from Rome before carrying a lex curiata, and yet were not prevented\r\nby this circumstance from holding military commands during their year\r\nof office or from continuing in command into the following year as\r\npromagistrates.[1142] A further instance is that of Pomptinus, praetor in\r\n63, who had no curiate law; nevertheless as propraetor in 61 he governed\r\nNarbonensis where he gained a victory over the Gauls. This fact, too,\r\nis evidence that the want of the law did not in practice debar from\r\nmilitary commands. From 58 to 54 he waited outside the gates of Rome\r\nfor a triumph. The senate would not grant it and some of the magistrates\r\nopposed his effort to obtain it. The privilege was at last given him by\r\nthe comitia under pretorian presidency.[1143] Although the want of the\r\nlaw involved him in inconvenience, he finally accomplished his purpose\r\nwithout it. Appius Claudius, consul in 54, insisted that, should he\r\nfail to carry the sanctioning act, he should nevertheless, since he\r\nwas in possession of a province decreed the consuls of his year in\r\naccordance with the Sempronian plebiscite, have imperium by virtue of a\r\nCornelian statute until such time as he should re-enter the city.[1144]\r\nThe law of Sulla, to which he referred, probably stated simply that the\r\npromagistrate was to retain his imperium till his return to the city,\r\nwithout mentioning the curiate law; and for that reason Appius believed\r\nthe sanctioning act to be unnecessary. Cicero, who informs us of this\r\nmatter, inclines to the interpretation of Appius. Our conclusion,\r\naccordingly, is that in practice, if not in legal theory, the lex\r\ncuriata, however convenient it may have been, was not essential to the\r\ngovernment of a province or to a military command. It remains to consider\r\nwhether it was indispensable to the holding of comitia centuriata for\r\nelections. The same Appius Claudius maintained that though a curiate law\r\nwas appropriate to the consul, it was not a necessity,[1145] implying\r\nthat without the law he was competent to perform all the functions of\r\nthat office. He and his colleague, therefore, who was equally without the\r\nlaw,[1146] were ready to hold comitia for the election of successors;\r\nand although party complications opposed the election, no one objected\r\nto it on the ground that the consuls were incompetent; for postponing\r\nthe election they resorted to auspical obnuntiations[1147] and to\r\nprosecutions of the candidates for bribery.[1148] Their competence to\r\nhold the elective comitia is further established by the senate’s desire\r\nthat they should hold them at the earliest possible moment.[1149] The\r\nultimate failure of these consuls to elect successors was not owing to\r\nany one’s objecting to their competence.[1150]\r\n\r\nScholars have attached great weight to the case of the magistrates of\r\n49, who with the Pompeian party, as has been stated,[1151] left the city\r\nbefore carrying a lex curiata. Though desiring, in the Pompeian camp\r\nat Thessalonica, to hold comitia for the election of successors, it\r\nwas decided that the want of the law rendered the consuls incompetent\r\nfor the function.[1152] But the case requires careful examination. The\r\nPompeians had with them two hundred senators, enough in their opinion\r\nto constitute a quorum, and their augurs had consecrated a place for\r\ntaking auspices; so that it was assumed that the populus Romanus and the\r\nentire city were now located in the camp.[1153] All these circumstances\r\nclearly imply an intention to assume a temporary transfer of the city\r\nof Rome to the camp and to conduct the government in that place on the\r\nbasis of this constitutional fiction. But suddenly the execution of the\r\nplan was stopped by the plea that the consuls had no curiate law! The\r\ndifficulty, however, was not so serious as Dio Cassius and the moderns\r\nhave supposed. The assumption of the Pompeians that the city of Rome\r\ntemporarily existed in the camp implied as well the existence of a\r\npomerium, within which the consuls could legally have held a meeting of\r\nthe curiae.[1154] Or in case they felt any scruple about the matter, the\r\nsenate could have decreed the consuls a dispensation from the law for the\r\npurpose of holding the elections. That they allowed a mere formality to\r\nbaulk them is out of the question. The whole situation is made clear by\r\nthe understanding that the consuls themselves, or more probably Pompey,\r\ndid not wish elections to be held or a civil government established\r\nin the camp; such a proceeding would have disturbed still further the\r\ndiscipline of the army and would have roused jealousies inimical to the\r\ncause. On this interpretation the want of a law, especially as it has the\r\nappearance of an afterthought, was a mere pretext.\r\n\r\nWe have seen promagistrates whose election to their respective offices\r\nhad not been sanctioned by the curiae governing provinces and holding\r\nmilitary commands; we have seen consuls who lacked the curiate sanction\r\nattending with less inconvenience to all their official duties. The same\r\nlooseness characterized the application of the law to minor officials.\r\nThe want of the sanction legally involved curule aediles, quaestors, and\r\nall other officials who lacked the right to convoke the curiae; and yet\r\nit is impossible that in 54, for instance, when the consuls failed to\r\npass the law, the curule aediles and the quaestors should have remained\r\ninactive through the entire year without leaving in our sources some\r\ntrace of the disturbance caused by the suspension of their administrative\r\nfunctions. Dio Cassius states that no judicial process could be\r\nundertaken before the enactment of the law; nevertheless Clodius as\r\naedile in 56 prosecuted Milo before the people prior to the vote on the\r\nsanctioning act.[1155] The quaestors entered office regularly on December\r\n5;[1156] and as the curiate law was carried for them by the consuls, they\r\nwere necessarily in official duty for some time every year before their\r\nelection could be sanctioned. It seems clear that ordinarily one curiate\r\nlaw was passed each year, under the joint presidency of the consuls and\r\npraetors, for all the officials who required it.[1157] If that is true,\r\na postponement of the law, or a failure to pass it, affected all the\r\nmagistrates of the year.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the meaning of this wide divergence between\r\nconstitutional theory and actual practice can find an answer only in\r\nthe history of the curiate assembly. For a time after the founding of\r\nthe republic it remained politically important. From the institution\r\nof the plebeian tribunate (494) to the enactment of the so-called law\r\nof Publilius Volero (471) the curiate assembly elected tribunes of the\r\nplebs.[1158] In 390, according to Livy,[1159] it voted the restoration\r\nof a citizen from exile. Rubino[1160] maintained that this assembly\r\ncontinued to be a real gathering of the people to the year after the\r\nbattle of Cannae, 215, when the exigencies of the war with Hannibal\r\nbrought into being a statute whereby the curiate act was passed by a vote\r\nof thirty lictors as the representatives of their respective curiae; in\r\nconsequence the sanction was reduced to a formality.[1161] The passage\r\nin Festus on which his theory depends is seriously mutilated; and his\r\nattempted restoration is objectionable chiefly (1) because it required\r\nno statute to keep the people from attending the comitia curiata,[1162]\r\n(2) because without a statute a resolution of the assembly was valid,\r\nif each voting division was represented by a single person,[1163] (3)\r\nbecause the measure, accordingly, to be a relief to existing conditions,\r\nmust have freed the commander rather than the men from the necessity\r\nof going to Rome to enact the curiate law. Whatever may be the true\r\nreading,[1164] we have a right to infer from the extant fragment (1)\r\nthat in the year mentioned, owing to the nearness of Hannibal, something\r\nwas done to relieve officers in the field from the necessity of coming\r\nto Rome to propose the law for themselves, (2) that the regulation\r\nwas permanent.[1165] It is known that the consul Q. Fabius Maximus\r\npresided at the consular elections for 214.[1166] He and M. Claudius\r\nMarcellus, who as proconsul was at the time in command of an army, were\r\nelected.[1167] Down to this time the custom had probably been for men who\r\nwere reëlected to an office or who passed from a promagistracy to the\r\ncorresponding magistracy, or the reverse, to reënact the lex curiata.\r\nBut we may suppose that after the election of 215 Fabius, fearing that\r\nboth he and Marcellus might be absent on military duty at the opening\r\nof their official year, secured the passage of a measure, most likely\r\na senatus consultum,[1168] which exempted from the need of repeating\r\nthe curiate law holders of the imperium who were making the transition\r\nabove described. In consenting to the arrangement the senate was making\r\na great sacrifice to the exigencies of the situation. For to maintain\r\ncontrol over the commanders it had insisted that they should begin their\r\nterms with all due formality at Rome.[1169] The lex curiata had proved a\r\nmaterial help to this end. But now the person already in command might\r\ncontinue from year to year at his post, relieved of the need of coming\r\nto the capital, where he would be temporarily subject to senatorial\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThis provision of 215 was therefore an important step in the development\r\nof the imperium; and at the same time it tended to destroy the little\r\nimportance still attaching to the curiate law. It seems to have been\r\nafter this event and partly in consequence of it[1170] that the comitia\r\ncuriata, which had long been declining, became at last a mere formality,\r\nattended by none but three augurs as witnesses to the proceedings[1171]\r\nand thirty lictors,[1172] who meekly[1173] cast the votes in obedience to\r\nthe command of the presiding magistrates.[1174] It is a noteworthy fact\r\nthat whereas the statesman Cicero has much to say of the curiate law,\r\nLivy and Dionysius make little reference to it. Our conclusion must be\r\nthat it was more important in the late republic than in the earlier time.\r\nProbably it nearly fell into disuse after 215, to be revived some time\r\nbefore Cicero. Its rehabilitation was the work of the optimates, for we\r\nfind the senatorial party chiefly interested in maintaining it during the\r\nage of Cicero. Since the lex curiata, subject as it was to impetrative\r\nauspices and to obnuntiations, correlated closely with the Aelian and\r\nFufian statutes, we may reasonably connect its revival closely with their\r\norigin. Cicero[1175] tells us accordingly that the comitia curiata have\r\ncontinued merely for the sake of the auspices. The curtailment of the\r\npower of this assembly is analogous to the curtailment of the power of\r\nthe king; as the latter was reduced, in the rex sacrorum, to a shadow\r\ncontinued merely for a religious purpose, the curiate comitia were\r\nlikewise reduced to a shadow maintained in appearance merely for keeping\r\nup an ancient custom and for the auspices connected therewith,[1176] but\r\nin reality as a part of the religious machinery operated with more or\r\nless effect for controlling refractory office-holders. During the age of\r\nCicero the senate strove to uphold its theory of the necessity of the\r\nlaw, while individuals in office and even the entire group of magistrates\r\nfor the year looked upon it as appropriate indeed but unessential to\r\ntheir functions. At its best the theory could be but partially realized\r\nin practice.\r\n\r\nNaturally the lictors never refused to vote the lex curiata, but it\r\nwas often prevented or delayed by the intercession of the plebeian\r\ntribunes.[1177] As we hear nothing of such action of the tribunes in the\r\nearly republic we may well conclude that it was a late usurpation. Their\r\nveto could be offset by a special resolution of the people for dispensing\r\nthe persons elected from the need of the curiate sanction.[1178] In\r\ndestroying the tribunician power Sulla, perhaps consciously, strengthened\r\nthe lex curiata as a weapon in the hands of the senate. He did not treat\r\nthe subject, however, with his usual precision; for in 54 we find Appius\r\nClaudius appealing to a Cornelian law in justification of his intention\r\nto govern a province without the sanction.[1179] The procedure of Appius\r\nmust have robbed the sanctioning act of the little vitality which it\r\nstill possessed. With the downfall of the republic it fell completely\r\ninto disuse.[1180]\r\n\r\n    I. COMPARATIVE VIEW: Spencer, H., _Principles of Sociology_,\r\n    ii. chs. viii, ix; Post, A.

It\r\nmay not have been instituted till some time after the downfall of the\r\nkingship,[1184] and it certainly did not reach its full complement of a\r\nhundred and ninety-three centuries till more than a hundred years after\r\nthat event.\r\n\r\nThrough the early republic Rome was engaged in an almost unceasing\r\nstruggle for existence. The army was constantly in the field; and the\r\nconsuls from the praetorium issued their commands for the protection\r\nand the government of the city. Their measures, after discussion in\r\nthe council of war, they must often have submitted to the approval of\r\nthe army. The military contio was sometimes summoned for exhorting the\r\nmen,[1185] for promising the reward of spoil in case of victory,[1186]\r\nfor reprimanding as well as for encouraging.[1187] On one occasion\r\nthe master of horse, calling a contio of soldiers, appealed to them\r\nfor protection from the dictator,[1188] and they replied with a shout\r\nthat they would allow no harm to befall him.[1189] Thereupon the\r\ndictator summoned another contio to witness the court-martial of the\r\nrebellious officer.[1190] On another occasion the consuls asked the\r\nsoldiers to decide a question by acclamation, and they obeyed.[1191]\r\nWe hear of the adjournment of a meeting on the motion of a military\r\ntribune.[1192] After a victory, honors and rewards were granted by\r\nvote of the soldiers.[1193] For acclamation, the regular form of\r\nvoting,[1194] was sometimes substituted a division of the army to right\r\nand left for the sake of silence.[1195] A military assembly, meeting\r\nat Veii, decided upon the appointment of Camillus, then in exile, to\r\nthe dictatorship, and despatched the resolution to Rome.[1196] In the\r\nyear 357 the consul Cn. Manlius held a tribal assembly of his troops at\r\nSutrium, and passed in it a law which imposed a tax of five per cent\r\non the manumission of slaves.[1197] Long afterward the army in Spain\r\nelected a propraetor.[1198] It may be that much other political business\r\nwas decided by the army in the troublous times which followed the\r\noverthrow of the kings. Although such acts were valid, they were always\r\nof an exceptional nature, and they ran counter to the spirit of the\r\nconstitution, which granted to all the citizens, not to those merely who\r\nchanced to be on military duty, a voice in the decision of such public\r\naffairs as came before the people.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the centuriate assembly, having developed from the\r\narmy, showed pronounced military features. It could not be convoked\r\nwithin the pomerium, for the reason that the army had to be kept\r\noutside the city;[1199] before the reform it met ordinarily in military\r\narray under its officers and with banners displayed;[1200] the usual\r\nplace of gathering was the Campus Martius; and no one but a magistrate\r\ncum imperio could under his own auspices convoke it for the purpose\r\nof taking a vote.[1201] For these reasons it was frequently, even\r\nin official language, termed exercitus.[1202] The use of this word,\r\nhowever, should not mislead us into supposing that the assembly was an\r\nactual army. Though Dionysius[1203] represents the first meeting as\r\narmed—a mere supposition, apparently to account for its known military\r\nfeatures—the fact is that the citizens carried weapons to none of the\r\nassemblies.[1204] Strictly, too, the centuriate gathering was termed\r\nexercitus urbanus in contrast with the real army designated as exercitus\r\narmatus or classis procincta.[1205] The facts thus far adduced amply\r\nwarrant us in refusing to consider the voting assembly an army.\r\n\r\nBut some imagine the censorial assembly for the assessment and lustration\r\nof the citizens to have been an army.[1206] For this view they rely upon\r\nDionysius,[1207] who states that the people came armed to the first\r\nlustrum, and upon an uncertain passage from the Censoriae Tabulae, quoted\r\nby Varro,[1208] which possibly speaks of the citizens in the lustral\r\nassembly as armati. If this word should be supplied in the passage, it\r\nmight refer to an inspection of arms of the men of military age;[1209]\r\nbut that circumstance would by no means imply that all who attended the\r\nlustrum were armed or were liable to military duty. It is certain that\r\nas the census-taking had primary reference to property for the purpose\r\nof apportioning taxes and other burdens of citizenship, those only were\r\nsummoned who were legally capable of holding property in their own name.\r\nThe list excluded all the men “in patris aut avi potestate,” however\r\nliable they were to military duty,[1210] as well as the women and\r\nchildren.[1211] All such persons were reported by the father or guardian.\r\nIt included, on the other hand, many who were exempt from military\r\nservice on account of age, physical condition, or want of the necessary\r\nproperty qualification. Hence the censorial assembly could not have been\r\nidentical with the army. Furthermore the centuriate assembly was not a\r\nbasis for the levy.[1212] On the contrary, the soldiers were enrolled\r\ndirectly from the tribes.[1213] These facts warrant the conclusion\r\nthat the relation between the army and the assembly must have been one\r\nof origin only; the organization of the assembly developed from that\r\nof the army, but at no time was the political assembly an army or the\r\narmy otherwise than exceptionally or irregularly a political assembly.\r\nThe truth is that an army regularly officiating as a political body\r\nwould require for its explanation two revolutions—one to bring it into\r\nexistence and another to abolish it; but of both cataclysms history is\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the political from the military organization was somewhat\r\nas follows. After the Romans had determined to use the centuries\r\nregularly as voting units for the decision of questions not purely\r\nmilitary, they proceeded forthwith to extend the organization so as\r\nto include all the citizens. For this purpose the men of military age\r\nwho were free from duty for the time being, or who had served the\r\nrequired number of campaigns—sixteen in the infantry or ten in the\r\ncavalry[1214]—or who were exempt on account of bodily infirmity or for\r\nany other reason, had to be admitted to the junior centuries, thus\r\nmaterially increasing their number and making them unequal with one\r\nanother. In a state, too, in which great reverence was paid to age the\r\nseniors could not be ignored. They were accordingly organized in a number\r\nof centuries (84) equal to that of the juniors—an arrangement which\r\nmade one senior count as much as three juniors.[1215] The mechanics who\r\nwere liable to skilled service in the army[1216] were then grouped\r\nfor voting purposes in two centuries, that of the smiths and that of\r\nthe carpenters,[1217] based on the two guilds in which these artisans\r\nwere already organized.[1218] Authorities differ as to the classes with\r\nwhich they were associated. Livy[1219] adds them to the first class.\r\nCicero,[1220] too, places a century of carpenters with that group, making\r\nno mention of the smiths, whereas Dionysius[1221] assigns both centuries\r\nof mechanics to the second class. The explanation of the difference of\r\nopinion seems to be that information as to this point was not contained\r\nin the censorial document from which the annalist (Fabius Pictor) drew\r\nhis knowledge of the earlier comitia centuriata; the Romans knew only by\r\ntradition that the industrial centuries were associated in the assembly\r\nwith one of the higher classes. The weight of authority inclines in favor\r\nof the first class, and the reason for the respectable place occupied\r\nby the mechanics is the high value placed on their service in early\r\ntime.[1222] In like manner the trumpeters (tubicines, liticines) and the\r\nhornblowers (cornicines) were grouped each in a century for voting in the\r\ncomitia,[1223] also on the basis of their guild organizations.[1224]\r\nThe accensi velati, who as we are informed followed the army in civilian\r\ndress and without weapons,[1225] also received a centuriate organization.\r\nAs to the number of centuries belonging to them opinion has differed.\r\nSome, formerly including Mommsen,[1226] have assumed two. Livy,[1227]\r\nhowever, gives but one century; Cicero[1228] seems to have only one in\r\nmind; and in imperial time there was a single collegium, or century, of\r\naccensi,[1229] probably a survival of the old political group. These\r\nconsiderations led Mommsen to abandon his former view, to assume instead\r\na single century of the kind; and recent writers are inclined to follow\r\nhim.[1230] Lowest in rank of the supernumerary centuries was that of\r\nthe proletarians.[1231] The government so designated those citizens\r\nwho owned no land,[1232] and hence were poor. They were exempt from\r\nmilitary duty, excepting in so far as they served with arms furnished\r\nby the state.[1233] Though few in the beginning, their number gradually\r\nincreased till in the time of Dionysius[1234] it exceeded all the five\r\nclasses together. At some time in the early history of the comitia\r\ncenturiata they were formed into a century and given one vote,[1235]\r\nwhich was not counted with any class but was reported after all the\r\nothers. Dionysius[1236] wrongly speaks of it as a sixth class. The\r\nexistence of this century is due to the principle that no one should be\r\nexcluded from the right to vote on account of poverty.[1237]\r\n\r\nSix supernumerary centuries have now been mentioned and the place of\r\nthree—the two industrial and the one proletarian—in the voting system\r\nhas been considered. With reference to the others Dionysius assigns the\r\nmusicians to the fourth class, Livy to the fifth. The settlement of this\r\nquestion is aided by an examination into the total number of comitial\r\ncenturies of the fifth class. It is given as thirty by the sources.[1238]\r\nAssuming this to be the correct number and adding to the sum of centuries\r\nin the five classes (170) the six supernumerary centuries and the\r\neighteen centuries of knights to be considered below, we should have in\r\nall a hundred and ninety-four, which would be one too many. In an earlier\r\nchapter, however, the conclusion was reached that there were but fourteen\r\nmilitary centuries in the fifth class.[1239] Two of the thirty centuries\r\nassigned to that class In the comitia centuriata must therefore have\r\nbeen in fact supernumerary. If one was the accensi, what was the other?\r\nMost probably it was the century of the tardy described by Festus,[1240]\r\nmade up at each meeting of those who came too late to vote in their own\r\nclasses. Obviously all writers who apply the discriptio centuriarum to\r\nthe army view this century, as well as that of the proletarians, with\r\nsuspicion.[1241] The two centuries of the accensi and the tardy should be\r\nincluded among, not added to, the thirty of the fifth class.[1242] Having\r\nreached this result, it might seem advisable for us to assume no further\r\nsupernumerary centuries for the fifth class, but to follow the authority\r\nof Dionysius in assigning the musicians to the fourth. Or as the\r\ntrumpeters preceded the hornblowers in rank, it might be plausibly argued\r\nthat the former belonged to the fourth and the latter to the fifth. In\r\nthis way a compromise could be effected between Livy and Dionysius,\r\nand Livy’s three supernumerary centuries of the fifth class could be\r\nexplained. Absolute certainty is unattainable. The notion of Dionysius\r\nthat one century of musicians voted with the seniors, the other with the\r\njuniors, and so of the mechanics,[1243] is erroneous; for the seniors did\r\nnot vote separately from the juniors.\r\n\r\nIn the centuriate assembly each of the six tribal troops of knights[1244]\r\nhad one vote, and was called, therefore, a suffragium. As the term\r\ncenturia had not previously applied to these groups, it was for a time\r\nwithheld from them in the comitia, the six divisions being known simply\r\nas the sex suffragia.[1245] Afterward as new voting groups were added\r\nto the equites they came to be called centuries, and thence the term\r\nextended to the old.[1246] The centuriate organization of the comitia did\r\nnot demand the creation of suffragia seniorum, to correspond with the\r\ncenturiae seniorum of the infantry, perhaps because the six votes in the\r\ncomitia centuriata adequately represented the whole number of patricians.\r\nAs the equites originally provided their own horses,[1247] they held\r\ntheir rank for life, not merely through the period of service. After the\r\nstate had undertaken to furnish money for the purchase and keeping of\r\nthe horses,[1248] the eques retained his public horse, and consequently\r\nhis membership in an equestrian century, long after his retirement from\r\nactive duty.[1249] The increase in the number of equestrian votes was\r\nowing to the participation of plebeians in the mounted service.[1250]\r\nFrom them twelve equestrian centuries were formed for the centuriate\r\nassembly, and added to the six groups already existing. This increase\r\nprobably came about in the course of the fourth century, accompanying or\r\nfollowing the enlargement of the infantry from two to four legions.[1251]\r\nThus the total number of one hundred and ninety-three centuries could not\r\nhave been reached till shortly before 269.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing discussion has made it evident that from the time when\r\nthe comitia centuriata came into being, there were two centuriate\r\norganizations; (1) the military, which continued as before till it\r\nchanged to the manipular formation,[1252] (2) the political, which\r\ndeveloped from the military but which was at no time identical with it.\r\n\r\n           DISCRIPTIO CENTURIARUM OF THE COMITIA CENTURIATA\r\n\r\n                Old centuries of knights         6\r\n                New centuries of knights        12\r\n    =========+=====================+===========+==================\r\n     CLASSES |  JUNIOR CENTURIES   |  SENIOR   | RATINGS IN ASSES\r\n             |                     | CENTURIES | ACCORDING TO LIVY\r\n    ---------+---------------------+---------—+-------------------\r\n       I     | 40 + 2 of artisans  |    40     |     100,000\r\n      II     | 10                  |    10     |      75,000\r\n     III     | 10                  |    10     |      50,000\r\n             |                     |           |\r\n      IV     | 10 + 2 of musicians |    10     |      25,000\r\n      V      | 14 + 1 of accensi   |           |\r\n             |    + 1 of the tardy |    14     |      11,000\r\n    =========+=====================+===========+==================\r\n\r\n                        Below the classes:\r\n                     1 century of proletarians\r\n\r\n                              SUMMARY\r\n\r\n                    Knights                   18\r\n                    Seniors and juniors      168\r\n                    Supernumerary              7\r\n                                             ---\r\n                      Total                  193\r\n\r\nBefore the reform this assembly met in military array with banners\r\ndisplayed, each company under its centurion.[1253] The voting was\r\noral. Probably it was at first by acclamation; if so the suggestion of\r\nindividual voting, as we find it in historical time, must have come from\r\nthe orderly military array, which offered itself conveniently for the\r\npurpose.[1254] The centurions may originally have served as rogatores,\r\nto collect and report the votes.[1255] Each century cast a single vote,\r\nwhich in historical time the majority of its members decided.[1256] The\r\nvoting proceeded according to classes; the equites were asked first,\r\nhence their centuries were termed prerogative (praerogativae), then the\r\neighty centuries of the first class. If the votes of these two groups\r\nwere unanimous, they decided the question at issue; as ninety-seven\r\nwas a majority, they had one to spare from their total number. If they\r\ndisagreed, the second class was called and then the third and so on to\r\nthe proletarian century. But the voting ceased as soon as a majority was\r\nreached, which was often with the first class; and it rarely happened\r\nthat the proletarians were called on to decide the issue.[1257] The\r\nannouncement of the prerogative votes greatly influenced the action of\r\nthose which followed.[1258]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Reform_\r\n\r\nThe study of the centuriate assembly begun earlier in the volume[1259]\r\nand continued in the preceding part of this chapter shows it gradually\r\ndeveloping its organization during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.\r\nThe main line of progress has been traced though details are unknown.\r\nThe growth of popular rights in the latter half of the fourth century\r\ngave a great impetus to the activity of the assemblies in general, as is\r\nmanifested in the Genucian, Publilian, and Hortensian legislation. In\r\n312 when the change was made in the appraisements from land to money,\r\nmany aerarii who had voted with the proletarians must have been advanced\r\nto the higher classes.[1260] This step toward the democratization of\r\nthe comitia centuriata, following upon the reduction of the patrum\r\nauctoritas to a mere formality, could not help adding new energy to\r\nthe institution, leading to further changes in a popular direction.\r\nThe class ratings which are known to history were established no\r\nearlier than 269.[1261] Two other more important changes, which can be\r\nbut approximately dated, must now be considered in detail. They are\r\n(1) the abolition of the equestrian prerogative and the introduction\r\nof the custom of drawing by lot a prerogative century from the first\r\nclass on each occasion before the voting began; (2) the division of the\r\ncitizens into classes and centuries within the several tribes. These two\r\ninnovations are commonly grouped together under the name of the “reform.”\r\nAs they have no necessary connection with one another, they need not\r\nhave been simultaneous. Livy’s narrative of the happenings of 396[1262]\r\nand of 383[1263] seems to imply that they had been introduced before\r\nthese dates.[1264] But the passages here referred to are uncertain; and\r\nat all events they belong to a period in which the centuries may still\r\nhave been closely connected with the tribes.[1265] But should they be so\r\ninterpreted as to apply to the reformed centuriate assembly, they might\r\nstill be looked upon as historical anticipations for the reason that\r\nLivy’s[1266] account of the year 296 has reference to a feature of the\r\nold organization. This disposition of the three passages is supported by\r\nthe following consideration. Had the reform been introduced much earlier\r\nthan 269, the annalists would have assigned it to Servius Tullius, just\r\nas they assigned to him thirty tribes (reached in 318), all thirty-five\r\ntribes (reached in 241), and the census ratings in the sextantarian asses\r\n(established in or after 269);[1267] and in that case all memory of the\r\noriginal Servian system would have been lost. The circumstance that we\r\nare acquainted with it in some detail is proof of its survival into the\r\nthird century B.C. In fact Livy’s[1268] chief reference to the reform\r\nindicates that it was completed, if not undertaken, after the number of\r\ntribes had been brought up to thirty-five (241). On the other hand it\r\ncame before the opening of his third decade (218), which takes the new\r\narrangement for granted.[1269] The contention is often made that Livy\r\nmust have given an account of the reform in his second decade (292-219)\r\nnow lost; and there is a universal agreement that the reform was brought\r\nabout not by statute, but by arbitrary censorial disposition.[1270] The\r\ncensor commonly assumed to be the author of the change is either Fabius\r\nButeo, 241, or Flaminius, 220.[1271] Against the latter may be urged\r\nthe silence of Polybius[1272] and Livy,[1273] who in speaking at length\r\nof his opposition to the nobles makes no reference to this reform. In\r\nfavor of Fabius it may be said that in 241 the full number of tribes\r\nwas completed; and the name of the thirty-fifth, Quirina, corresponding\r\nto Romilia, the first rural tribe, suggests that the Romans intended to\r\ncreate no more. In naming the last tribe the censors seem to have had in\r\nmind the completion of the new system, to each component part of which\r\nthey apparently guaranteed a definite share of political power, which\r\nwould have been impaired by the further creation of tribes.[1274]\r\n\r\nA little reflection, however, will convince us of the impossibility of\r\nassigning the reform to any one censor or to a definite date. Livy could\r\nnot have made much of it in the lost part of his history without leaving\r\nsome trace in the epitome, which mentions far more trivial matters.[1275]\r\nThe only explanation of the epitomator’s silence is that the reform\r\nwas so gradual as to escape marked attention. This view is supported\r\nby a strict interpretation of Livy,[1276] who supposes the change to\r\nhave come about naturally with the increase in the number of tribes,\r\nand of Dionysius,[1277] who ascribes the innovation, or a part of it,\r\nto no individual but to “certain powerful forces.” A conclusion as to\r\nthe date of the reform, to be acceptable, must satisfy the conditions\r\nabove mentioned. In earlier time, when there was a single classis, the\r\ncenturies were made up within the tribes; but this simple system was\r\nrendered impossible by the increase in the number of classes.[1278]\r\nFor convenience of administration the censors must soon after this\r\nenlargement have begun an effort to reduce the discord to harmony. One\r\nclass may have been brought into agreement with the tribes more readily\r\nthan another, and thus the readaptation may have extended through\r\nmany lustra. The number of centuries probably did not long remain at\r\none hundred and ninety-three. It may have received its first increase\r\nabove that sum in 304, for instance, the date to which Niebuhr[1279]\r\nassigns the reform. The process may have been far advanced in 241, the\r\ndate preferred by a majority of scholars, and completed by Flaminius\r\nin 220.[1280] The abolition of the equestrian prerogative may likewise\r\nhave been gradual; it may have been retained in one class of comitial\r\nacts—elections or legislation, for instance—longer than in another. The\r\nconclusion that the changes were gradually introduced in the period from\r\n304 to 220 would best explain all the known facts.[1281]\r\n\r\nAs no description of the reformed organization has come down to us, we\r\nare obliged to reconstruct it from the scant references of various\r\nwriters. It is to be noted first that the five classes continued in the\r\nnew system.[1282] They were still based on the census,[1283] and were\r\ncalled to vote in their order as before.[1284] The distinction between\r\njuniors and seniors was retained;[1285] and as these comitia were still\r\ncalled centuriata, the centuries necessarily continued as the voting\r\nunits.[1286] But the reform brought them into direct relation with the\r\ntribes, which now served as a basis for the division into centuries\r\nand for their distribution according to age and class. On this point\r\nLivy[1287] remarks, “We ought not to wonder that the arrangement which\r\nnow exists after the tribes have been increased to thirty-five, their\r\nnumber being doubled in the centuries of juniors and seniors, does\r\nnot agree with the total number instituted by Servius Tullius; for he\r\ndivided the city into four parts, ... which he called tribes.... Nor\r\ndid those tribes have any relation to the distribution and number of\r\nthe centuries.” From this passage we may infer (1) that in the reformed\r\nassembly the number and distribution of the centuries depended closely\r\nupon the tribes—a conclusion supported by other citations to be given\r\nhereafter, (2) that the number of centuries was changed, although we are\r\nnot distinctly informed whether by diminution or increase. According to\r\none interpretation the number of tribes was doubled by the number of\r\ncenturies of juniors and seniors, and there were therefore seventy of\r\nthese centuries, thirty-five juniors and as many seniors, each century\r\nforming a half tribe. This view is supported by passages in which the\r\ncentury bears the name of the tribe, as Aniensis iuniorum,[1288] Voturia\r\niuniorum,[1289] Galeria iuniorum,[1290] as well as by those which in a\r\nmore general way refer to voting or the announcement of the votes by\r\nor according to tribes in the centuriate assembly.[1291] It accords\r\nperfectly with other evidence that the century was an integral part of\r\nthe tribe.[1292] This is the view adopted by Niebuhr.[1293] It is open,\r\nhowever, to the fatal objection of abolishing the classes, which in\r\nfact continued through the republic, as has already been shown.[1294]\r\nHe does indeed allow for a first class comprising the country tribes\r\nand a second class made up of the others;[1295] but this hypothesis is\r\noverthrown by those citations which imply the continuance of all five\r\nclasses,[1296] as well as by those which make the census an element of\r\nthe later organization.[1297] Huschke,[1298] who places the reform in the\r\nearliest times of the republic, adopts Niebuhr’s view as to the number\r\nof centuries; but maintaining the continuance of the five classes,[1299]\r\nhe considers them to be groups of tribes, the seventeen old rural tribes\r\nbeing distributed as follows: in the first class eight, in the second,\r\nthird, and fourth respectively two, in the fifth three.[1300] But bearing\r\nin mind that these tribes were primarily local, we cannot at the same\r\ntime regard them as census groups without ascribing to them an impossibly\r\nartificial character. For this reason the theory of Huschke should be\r\nrejected. To avoid this difficulty, while retaining the classes, the\r\nassumption has been made that the classes were subdivisions of the\r\ncentury, in other words that each century contained men of every class.\r\nThis view is invalidated by the fact that the centuries continued to\r\nbe divisions of the classes, which were still called to vote in their\r\norder.[1301]\r\n\r\nThe assumption of a diminution in number having proved untenable, the\r\nconclusion is that there was an increase.[1302] In view of the facts\r\n(1) that the reformed organization rested on a tribal basis,[1303] (2)\r\nthat the centuries were divisions not only of the tribes[1304] but also\r\nof the classes,[1305] (3) that the tribes could not have been divisions\r\nof the classes,[1306] it is necessary to conclude that the classes were\r\nthemselves divisions of the tribes with the centuries as subdivisions.\r\nIn other words, the work of organization took place within the tribe:\r\nthe members of a tribe were first divided into five classes according to\r\ntheir wealth; within each class the men were grouped on the basis of age\r\ninto juniors and seniors,[1307] one century for each within the several\r\nclasses, making ten centuries of juniors to the tribe, or in all three\r\nhundred and fifty tribal centuries, to which are to be added eighteen\r\ncenturies of knights and probably five supernumerary centuries, amounting\r\nto a total of three hundred and seventy-three. This is substantially the\r\nview of Pantagathus.[1308] Convincing evidence is afforded by a group of\r\ninscriptions of the imperial period.[1309] From them we learn that under\r\nthe emperors the urban tribes comprised severally (1) a corpus seniorum,\r\n(2) a corpus iuniorum, (3) the tribus Sucusana a corpus Iulianum, and the\r\nPalatine and Esquiline each a corpus Augustale. Every corpus consisted of\r\nseveral centuries. In the corpus Sucusana iuniorum were eight centuries\r\ndivided into two groups of five and three respectively, the first group\r\nbeing evidently superior to the second. At the head of the century was a\r\ncenturio or curator.[1310] Eliminating the corpora which were named after\r\nemperors and which must have been instituted in their time, eliminating\r\nalso the inferior centuries of the corpora seniorum and iuniorum, which\r\nwere undoubtedly added either by the emperors or by the late republican\r\ncensors, we have remaining five centuries to the corpus as it must\r\nhave stood in the period immediately following the reform. This result\r\nconfirms the view suggested by Pantagathus.\r\n\r\nIt was accepted by Mommsen in his _Römische Tribus_ (1844) and in the\r\nfirst seven editions of his _History of Rome_; but in his _Römisches\r\nStaatsrecht_[1311] he has offered a radical modification: while holding\r\nto the 373 centuries, he maintains that they were so combined as to cast\r\nin all 193 votes. According to this theory the first class comprised 35\r\n× 2 = 70 centuries, each with one vote, whereas the remaining classes\r\ntogether, made up of 4 × 35 × 2 = 280 centuries, cast but 100 votes.\r\nHow the centuries were combined Mommsen does not presume to say. He\r\nconsiders it possible, however, that for instance sixty of the seventy\r\ncenturies of the second class were grouped by threes and ten by twos,\r\nmaking twenty-five voting groups in all. Had he attempted to follow out\r\nin detail the practical working of the theory, he would hardly have\r\noffered it to the public. The votes could not have been determined by a\r\nmajority of component centuries, for according to the theory some groups\r\ncomprised but two. Or if the group voted by individuals without regard to\r\nthe component centuries, the four lower classes were practically composed\r\nnot of centuries but of larger, nameless voting divisions.\r\n\r\nHis main support is the account of the centuriate organization given in\r\nCicero’s _Republic_,[1312] which speaks of a hundred and ninety-three\r\ncenturies, and which Mommsen[1313] believes to be a description of the\r\nreformed organization. Cicero’s[1314] assumption that the essential\r\nfacts were known to the friends of the younger Scipio—the leader in\r\nthe dialogue—and the discrepancy in the number of centuries of the\r\nfirst class between the Servian system as given by the annalists (Livy\r\nand Dionysius) and the organization which Cicero describes[1315] are\r\nthe chief points in Mommsen’s favor. Against his interpretation it\r\nmay be urged (1) that the passage is exceedingly uncertain;[1316]\r\n(2) that Cicero makes Servius Tullius the author of the organization\r\nwhich he describes; (3) that though the reform affected the details of\r\nthe comitial organization, the principle—a distribution of the people\r\naccording to ordines, census, aetates—remained the same from the time\r\nof Servius to the time of Cicero, so that he could assume that it was\r\nknown to the hearers of Scipio; (4) that as to the discrepancy in the\r\nnumber of centuries in the first class, on the assumption that the text\r\nis correct, (_a_) Cicero, who was by no means infallible, may have made a\r\nmistake,[1317] being in this case especially liable to error because in\r\nthe reformed organization the first class comprised seventy centuries,\r\nor (_b_) in case Cicero is right, either (_m_) the annalists may be in\r\nerror in assigning eighty centuries to the first class, or (_n_) in an\r\nearly stage of transition from the old to the new organization the number\r\nof centuries in the first class may have been cut down to seventy with\r\na corresponding increase of ten in some other part of the system; (5)\r\nthat Mommsen’s theory is refuted by the language of Cicero,[1318] who\r\nspeaks of the voting divisions of the four lower classes not as groups of\r\ncenturies but simply as centuries, the absence of a name for such a group\r\nbeing one of the strongest arguments against its existence. Mommsen’s\r\ninterpretation of the passage is in brief too strained and unnatural to\r\ncommend itself to the understanding. Apart from its lack of support in\r\nthe sources, an objection to the theory is its extreme impracticability.\r\nHolding that juniors and seniors could not have been brought together in\r\nthe same voting divisions, and assuming that the combinations were made\r\nby twos and threes and that the four lower classes had an equal number of\r\nvotes, Klebs has worked out the simplest arrangement as follows:\r\n\r\n  ===============+===========+==================================+=========\r\n       CLASS     | CENTURIES |                                  | VOTES\r\n  ---------------+-----------+----------------------------------+---------\r\n  I              |    70     |        One vote each             |  70\r\n  II             |    70     | 35 of seniors                    |\r\n                 |           |    8 in groups of two    4 votes |\r\n                 |           |   27 in groups of three  9 votes |\r\n                 |           |                         --       |\r\n                 |           |                         13 votes |\r\n                 |           | 35 of juniors                    |\r\n                 |           |    2 in a group          1 vote  |\r\n                 |           |   33 in groups of three 11 votes |\r\n                 |           |                         12 votes |\r\n                 |           |                         --       |\r\n                 |           |    Total                         |  25\r\n                 |           |                                  |\r\n       If the remaining classes are like the second, we shall have:\r\n                 |           |                                  |\r\n  III            |    70     |                                  |  25\r\n  IV             |    70     |                                  |  25\r\n  V              |    70     |                                  |  25\r\n  Equites        |    18     |          One vote each           |  18\r\n  Supernumeraries|     5     |          One vote each           |   5\r\n                 |           |                                  | ---\r\n                 |           |            Total                 | 193[1319]\r\n  ===============+===========+==================================+==========\r\n\r\nThis complex system would make the action of the centuriate assembly\r\nexceedingly slow and difficult, and would be as useless as impracticable;\r\nfor if the object was to reduce the votes of the first class by ten and\r\nto make the other classes equal, that end could have been easily attained\r\nby the readjustment of numbers on the old basis, without the invention\r\nof this awkward grouping, the like of which is not known to have existed\r\nin any ancient or modern state. Such a reform, too, would bring out\r\nmore clearly than ever the inequality of rights in the comitia,[1320]\r\nand therefore could not have been called democratic by Dionysius.[1321]\r\nIt is contradicted also by Livy,[1322] who distinctly states that the\r\nnumber of centuries was changed. Lastly the objection must be made that\r\nthe joining of centuries of different tribes into voting units cannot\r\nbe reconciled with the imperial grouping of centuries of the same tribe\r\ninto corpora,[1323] and is refuted by the many citations which assume the\r\nvoting or the announcement of the votes to have proceeded according to\r\ntribes[1324] as well as according to classes.[1325]\r\n\r\nLange,[1326] not thinking it necessary to preserve a total of a hundred\r\nand ninety-three votes but accepting in the main the view of Pantagathus,\r\ntries to bring the centuries into relation with the tribes by assuming\r\nthat the seventy half-tribes, severally comprising five centuries\r\nof juniors or seniors, were given each one vote in the “concluding\r\nannouncement” (Schlussrenuntiation), this vote being determined by a\r\nmajority of the five component centuries. In like manner the eighteen\r\ncenturies of knights were grouped in divisions of three centuries each,\r\nso as to count six votes in the final announcement, hence the name sex\r\nsuffragia. The supernumerary centuries were grouped in one or two voting\r\ndivisions, so that in all seventy-seven or seventy-eight votes were\r\ncast.[1327] As to the process, he believed that after the prerogative\r\nthe seventy centuries of the first class and the eighteen centuries of\r\ncavalry voted simultaneously, and while their votes were being counted\r\nthe second class was voting, the votes, in his opinion, not being\r\nannounced as soon as known.[1328] This view as to the announcement is\r\ncontradicted by the sources,[1329] which clearly imply that the reports\r\nwere made public as they came in. Against his theory may be urged also\r\n(1) the fact that no name existed for the half-tribe, which in his\r\nopinion cast one vote in the closing announcement,[1330] as well as (2)\r\nthe fact that the sources give more than six votes to the equites in the\r\nlate republic.[1331] Lange is right, however, in understanding that the\r\nvoting did not now, as formerly, cease when a majority was reached, but\r\ncontinued till all the centuries had voted.[1332]\r\n\r\nA solution of the problem as to the order of voting suggested by\r\nKlebs[1333] seems to satisfy all conditions. The centuries gave their\r\nvotes by classes, each being announced as soon as it was ascertained.\r\nThen when all the centuries had voted, a count was taken by tribes in the\r\norder determined by lot;[1334] and a second announcement, made in that\r\norder, decided the election or other act of the people. Each candidate\r\nwas declared elected when a majority of votes was reached in his favor.\r\n\r\nRegarding the supernumerary centuries our information is extremely\r\nmeagre. As it does not seem likely that influential corporations would\r\nbe robbed of a privilege they once enjoyed, we may reasonably believe\r\nthat the artisans, musicians, and accensi velati retained centuries of\r\ntheir own in the reformed organization. Cicero,[1335] however, speaks of\r\na single century of artisans for his time. The two industrial colleges,\r\nwhich had existed from an early age,[1336] seem to have been joined in\r\none and to have continued into the imperial period after nearly all\r\nthe other guilds had been abolished.[1337] When the two were united,\r\nthey were probably reduced to a single vote in the assembly. In like\r\nmanner the liticines, or tubicines, and the cornicines were united in\r\none college of musicians[1338] and were probably given one vote. The\r\naccensi velati, too, formed a college composed of wealthy freedmen,\r\nfreeborn, and even knights.[1339] We may well suppose that it still\r\npossessed a vote in the centuriate assembly. Lastly may be mentioned\r\nthe century of proletarians and that of the tardy,[1340] which were as\r\nnecessary after the reform as before it.[1341] Although new centuries\r\nwere added, possibly by the later republican censors and certainly by\r\nthe emperors,[1342] the principle of the reformed organization remained\r\nunchanged.[1343]\r\n\r\nIn the reformed assembly the equestrian centuries ceased to be\r\nprerogative.[1344] A century was drawn from the first class[1345] by\r\nlot[1346] to take the lead in voting. Then came the remainder of the\r\nclass, including the equestrian centuries and the single century of\r\nartisans, eighty-eight in all. In the announcement the votes of the\r\nequites were distinguished from those of the class;[1347] and the sex\r\nsuffragia, no longer exclusively patrician,[1348] were reported after\r\nthe other eighty-two. The inferior place assigned to the suffragia was\r\nevidently to remove them far from their earlier prerogative position so\r\nas to free the assembly from patrician influence. Next the lower classes,\r\namong which other supernumerary centuries were distributed as in the\r\nearlier republic, voted in order; and finally came the summing up by\r\ntribes in the way described above. The old military array gave place to\r\na civilian grouping like that already established for the curiate and\r\ntribal assemblies.[1349]\r\n\r\n    I.

Thereafter\r\nthese comitia not only continued to elect the consuls, but also\r\nnaturally acquired the right to choose all elective higher magistrates,\r\nextraordinary as well as ordinary, who were entrusted temporarily\r\nor permanently with some or all of the consular power—including the\r\ndecemviri legibus scribundis, 451, 450, the tribuni militum consulari\r\npotestate, beginning in 444, the two censors, beginning in 443 (or 435?),\r\nand the praetors, increased gradually from one in 366 to sixteen under\r\nCaesar.[1352] The activity of this assembly in elections expanded with\r\nthe growth in the number of offices; and its importance was further\r\nenhanced by the opening of the patrician magistracies to plebeians.\r\nThe validity of a centuriate elective act depended upon the subsequent\r\ncuriate law, which soon became a mere form, and upon the patrum\r\nauctoritas. The latter, too, was deprived of all vitality by the Maenian\r\nplebiscite,[1353] which required the act to be passed before the election\r\nwhile the issue was uncertain.[1354] The date of this plebiscite is\r\nunknown; but it probably followed close upon the Hortensian legislation\r\n(287).[1355]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Legislative_\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter[1356] it was shown that primitive Rome, like\r\nprimitive Greece, regarded law as god-given—a conception which left no\r\nscope for legislation by a popular assembly. Though under the kings\r\nthe people may occasionally have been called to vote on a resolution\r\naffecting their customs, the comitia curiata never acquired a law-making\r\nfunction.[1357] Even the declaration of war, which historical Rome\r\nlooked upon as a lex, was issued by the king without the consent of\r\nthe community, his only need being to secure the hearty support of the\r\nwarriors.[1358] It seems probable therefore that this question came,\r\nnot before the comitia, but before a military contio.[1359] From the\r\ncustom of the soldiers to participate in the settlement of questions\r\ntouching their interests[1360] developed the function of declaring war.\r\nThe people, however, were slow in acquiring the right. It is true that\r\nseveral such acts are mentioned by Dionysius for the early republic—for\r\nthe war against the Volscians, 489,[1361] against Veii, 482,[1362] and\r\nagainst the Aequians and Volscians in 462.[1363] These instances may be\r\nexplained either as acclamations in contio or as exceptional votes in\r\nthe comitia centuriata, or with more probability, owing to the character\r\nof our sources for those early times, as anticipations of later usage.\r\nThe decisive fact in the problem is that as late as 427 a controversy\r\narose as to whether war could be declared by order of the people only,\r\nor whether a senatus consultum was sufficient. It was settled in favor\r\nof the people by the threats of the plebeian tribunes to impede the\r\nlevy.[1364] For the next hundred years mention is often made of the\r\nexercise of this function by the people;[1365] and when a declaration\r\nwas once issued by them, it could be recalled only by their vote.[1366]\r\nDuring the period of the Samnite wars the assembly still more frequently\r\nmade use of this right.[1367] In better known times we find it firmly\r\nestablished. The people declared war against Carthage in 264,[1368]\r\nagainst the Illyrians in 229,[1369] against Carthage again in 218,[1370]\r\nagainst Macedon in 200,[1371] against Antiochus in 191,[1372] against\r\nMacedon again in 171,[1373] against Jugurtha in 111.[1374] In the case of\r\nthe two Macedonian wars here referred to, the declaration is mentioned as\r\nan act of the comitia centuriata.[1375] In 167 the praetor M. Juventus\r\nThalna attempted to pass through the tribal assembly a lex de bello\r\nindicendo against the Rhodians, but was effectually opposed by a tribune\r\nof the plebs;[1376] so that the function continued to be exclusively\r\ncenturiate. Cn. Manlius Volso in 189 made war upon the Gallograeci\r\nwithout an order of the people or a decree of the senate, and was on that\r\nground accused in the senate by two of his legati.[1377] We conclude,\r\nhowever, that the charge was fruitless from the circumstance that the\r\nsenate finally decreed him a triumph.[1378] For beginning war against\r\nthe Histrians on his own responsibility the consul A. Manlius, 178,\r\nwas threatened with a prosecution, which was quashed by a tribunician\r\nveto.[1379] Licinius Lucullus was not even brought to trial for the war\r\nhe waged without an order of the people against the Vaccaei in 151.[1380]\r\nHence it appears that though a magistrate could not legally begin war\r\non his own initiative, there was no real danger of condemnation for so\r\ndoing. The reason is that those in authority attached little importance\r\nto the right of the comitia in the matter. Only once is mentioned a\r\nfear lest the people may not give their consent to a war.[1381] One\r\ncase of rejection is recorded, and even here the centuries at a second\r\nsession obediently accepted the consul’s proposition.[1382] The control\r\nof diplomacy and of the revenues by the senate and magistrates assured\r\nthese powers the practical decision of questions of war and peace to\r\nsuch an extent that ratification by the assembly could ordinarily be\r\ncounted on as certain; and its influence decreased with the expansion\r\nof the empire. Meantime, however, the idea of popular sovereignty,\r\nwhich was expressing itself in other spheres of government, effectually\r\ndemanded, if only in form, some concession to the assembly in this field\r\nas well; and accordingly in the formula of declaration “populus” wholly\r\ntakes the place of the once all-important “senatus.”[1383] By such empty\r\nconcessions the nobility rendered the people more docile. Thus to the\r\nend of the republic the centuriate assembly retained the constitutional\r\nright to decide questions of aggressive war, although in practice the\r\nmagistrates nearly regained the place which they and the senate had held\r\nduring the century following the overthrow of kingship.[1384]\r\n\r\nThe nature of our sources does not allow a precise judgment regarding\r\nthe importance of the comitia curiata in the early republic. To the\r\ntime of the Gallic invasion it may occasionally have passed resolutions\r\naffecting the status of citizens.[1385] But as legislation never became\r\nan acknowledged function of the curiae, we are in a position to assert\r\nthat through the comitia centuriata the people were first introduced into\r\nthis sphere of public life.[1386]\r\n\r\nThe earliest legislation of this assembly, in fact the earliest recorded\r\nlegislative act of the Roman people, was the lex de provocatione\r\nattributed to Valerius Publicola, consul in the first year of the\r\nrepublic, 509.[1387] It was also through the centuriate assembly that\r\nthe consuls Valerius and Horatius in 449 passed a law which forbade the\r\nelection of a magistrate without appeal, and affixed as a penalty the\r\noutlawing of the trespasser.[1388] The third Valerian law of appeal in\r\n300[1389] was an act of the same assembly, whereas all three Porcian\r\nlaws on the same subject seem to have been tribal.[1390] The legislative\r\nfunction of the centuriate assembly, resting in the pre-decemviral period\r\nsimply on precedent, brought into being the statute of 471 to establish\r\na tribal assembly for the transaction of plebeian business, improperly\r\nknown as the Publilian law,[1391] the lex sacrata for the division of\r\nthe Aventine among the plebeians, erroneously termed Icilian, 456,[1392]\r\nthe lex Aternia Tarpeia de multae dictione, 454,[1393] the lex Menenia\r\nSextia on the same subjects in 452,[1394] the laws ratifying the Twelve\r\nTables in 451, 449[1395]—all excepting the second having reference to the\r\nlimitation of the magisterial power. Regarding the creation of offices,\r\nno mention is made of a law for the institution of the consulate itself;\r\nbut the centuries passed a law for the creation of the dictatorship,\r\n501,[1396] and of the decemviri legibus scribundis, which should be named\r\nSestian after the consul who undoubtedly proposed it, 452.[1397] Thus\r\nfar popular legislation had no basis excepting precedent, but a law of\r\nthe Twelve Tables now provided that there should be resolutions and\r\nvotes of the people, and whatever the people voted last should be law and\r\nvalid—the first clear enunciation of the principle that the will of the\r\npeople, whenever expressed, prevailed over every other authority.[1398]\r\nIt was far from establishing popular sovereignty, however, for the\r\ninitiative remained with the magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the comitia centuriata, thus authoritatively established,\r\nmanifested itself in the passing of the Valerian-Horatian laws of\r\n449,[1399] the lex Iulia Papiria de multarum aestimatione, 430,[1400] the\r\nlaw for the election of six military tribunes by the comitia tributa,\r\n362,[1401] the law of the dictator Publilius Philo, 339,[1402] the third\r\nValerian law concerning appeal, 300,[1403] and finally the Hortensian\r\nlaw, 287.[1404] All have reference to the regulation of magistracies\r\nor of assemblies. Meantime the centuriate comitia passed the law for\r\ninstituting tribunes of the soldiers with consular power, 445,[1405] and\r\ncensors, 443[1406] (or 435?), for increasing the number of quaestors,\r\n421,[1407] for instituting the praetorship, 367,[1408] and the curule\r\naedileship in the same year.[1409] All the laws thus far mentioned,\r\nexcepting that for the division of the Aventine, effected important\r\nmodifications of the constitution, the most of them forced upon the\r\nsenate and magistrates in the struggle for equal rights in which the\r\ncommons were engaged with the nobility. In like manner two provisions\r\nof the Valerian law of 342, (1) that the name of no soldier should be\r\nerased from the muster roll without his consent. (2) that no military\r\ntribune should be degraded to the rank of centurion,[1410] established\r\nunder the sanction of an oath certain fundamental rights on which the\r\nsoldiers and their officers respectively insisted. Another provision,\r\nthe total abolition of debts,[1411] if indeed it is historical, was\r\nadministrative, and is considered therefore in another connection.[1412]\r\nOf the same nature, though less sweeping, was the Hortensian provision\r\nfor the relief of debtors.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there came to be plebeian senators (about 400), the patricians\r\nreserved to themselves the right to decide on the legality of legislative\r\nand elective acts of the people under patrician presidency—a right\r\ndesignated by the phrase patrum auctoritas, which signified originally\r\nthe authorization of the senators, thereafter of the patrician senators.\r\nTill 339 the patres were at liberty to give or withhold the auctoritas;\r\nbut in that year an article of the Publilian law required them to grant\r\nit to legislative acts of the centuries before the voting began and\r\nwhile the issue was still in doubt, reducing it in this way to a mere\r\nformality.[1413] The effect was to free centuriate legislation from the\r\nconstitutional control hitherto exercised by patrician senators.[1414]\r\nHenceforth the resolutions of this assembly could be declared illegal\r\nby no less than a majority of the entire senate. The Publilian statute,\r\naccordingly, deprived the patricians of an important power, whereas\r\nthe senate as a whole continued through its consulta to exercise an\r\nincreasing influence over the comitia centuriata. Polybius rightly\r\nascribes to the consuls, therefore, the function of bringing the\r\nresolutions of the senate before the assembly. It could not have been\r\nthe intention of Publilius Philo to energize the comitia centuriata\r\nby this provision; for another article of the same statute, confirming\r\nthe validity of the tribunician assembly of tribes, as then actually\r\nconstituted exclusively of plebeians, paved the way for the Hortensian\r\nlaw, which by making the acts of the tribunician assembly in every\r\nrespect equal to those of the centuries, deprived the latter of their\r\ngreat importance as a factor in constitutional progress. From the time\r\nof Hortensius to the time of Sulla no constitutional statute is known to\r\nhave been enacted by the centuriate assembly; though our sources do not\r\ngive us clear information on the point, it is highly probable that the\r\nconsuls and dictators of this period preferred to bring their measures\r\nhowever important before the tribes.[1415] In Sulla’s time the lex\r\nValeria, 82,[1416] clothing him with his extraordinary dictatorship rei\r\npublicae constituendae, must have been passed by the centuries, which\r\nalone in addition to the politically obsolete comitia curiata could be\r\nsummoned by an interrex, as was the author of the law. This act, Lange\r\nremarks, cannot well be considered a revival of the legislative power of\r\nthe centuries, as it was not only passed through intimidation and under a\r\nmagistrate who had no constitutional right to initiate legislation, but\r\nit also created a legalized tyranny destructive of popular freedom.[1417]\r\nIn the words of Cicero it was the most iniquitous of all laws and most\r\nunlike a law.[1418] Only one of Sulla’s statutes, the lex de civitate\r\nVolaterranis adimenda, 81, which, depriving the Volaterrani of their\r\ncivitas cum suffragio, placed them in the condition of the Latins\r\nof Ariminum, is known to have been an act of the centuries.[1419]\r\nProbably all his other laws were ratified by the tribes.[1420] C.\r\nJulius Caesar preferably used the tribes, although it is possible that\r\nhis lex de provinciis and his lex iudiciaria came before the comitia\r\ncenturiata.[1421]\r\n\r\nSulla’s constitutional legislation curtailed the powers of the plebeian\r\ntribunes and of their assembly, proportionally increasing the importance\r\nof the centuries; and although his form of government was of short\r\nduration, the optimates thereafter naturally preferred the comitia\r\ncenturiata for the ratification of senatorial resolutions.[1422] To\r\nthis assembly accordingly belong the leges Vibiae of the consul C.\r\nVibius Pansa, 43, which confirmed the acts of Caesar, and took the place\r\nof Antony’s leges de coloniis deducendis and of his lex de dictatura\r\ntollenda.[1423]\r\n\r\nOn the institution of the censorship, and by the law which called the\r\noffice into being, it was enacted that elections of censors should be\r\nratified, not by the curiae as in the case of other magistrates, but\r\nby the centuries themselves.[1424] Before this date the principle was\r\nalready established that the people should vote twice in the election of\r\nevery magistrate in order that if they repented of their choice, they\r\nmight recall it by a second vote.[1425] As the primary function of the\r\ncensors was the periodical reconstitution of the comitia centuriata, it\r\nwas doubtless thought appropriate that this assembly alone should be\r\nconcerned with the election. The lex centuriata de potestate censoria,\r\nevidently passed under consular presidency, remained, like the curiate\r\nlaw in confirmation of elections to other offices, a mere form. It\r\nwas of too little practical significance ever to be noticed by the\r\nhistorians; in fact no individual instance of the passing of this act\r\nis mentioned by any extant writer. Characteristically the lex Aemilia,\r\n433, which is alleged to have cut down the term of censorship to eighteen\r\nmonths,[1426] and the lex Publilia Philonis, 339, which provided that\r\nat least one censor must be a plebeian,[1427] were centuriate, whereas\r\nthe Licinian-Sextian law, 367, which provided that one consul must be a\r\nplebeian,[1428] and the Genucian law, 342, permitting both to be,[1429]\r\nwere plebiscites.\r\n\r\nAn occasional attempt was made by a magistrate to usurp for the comitia\r\ncenturiata a share in the administration. The first which is worthy of\r\nnotice,[1430] even though it may be mythical, is the agrarian proposal\r\nof Sp. Cassius, 486. According to the sources it was opposed by the\r\nsenate and the colleague of the mover. Far from enacting it into a law,\r\nthe author, on the expiration of his consulship, was himself accused\r\nof attempting to usurp the royal power, and was, in one version of the\r\nstory, condemned to death by the assembly to which he had offered the\r\nbill.[1431] The senate must have taken very seriously this first attempt\r\nof a magistrate to transfer some of its administrative power to the\r\ncomitia. The law for the division of the Aventine Hill among the people,\r\n456, was actually passed, most probably by the centuries.[1432] It was\r\nforced upon the government by the plebeians, and did not serve as a\r\nprecedent for the future. The Valerian law of 342,[1433] which abolished\r\ndebts, was an extraordinary administrative measure similar in character,\r\nbut far more sweeping, to the clause for the relief of debtors in the\r\nLicinian-Sextian plebiscite.\r\n\r\nIf then the centuriate assembly was excluded from the field of\r\nadministration, it must certainly in pre-decemviral times have had no\r\npart in religious legislation. The law which regulated the intercalary\r\nmonth inscribed on a bronze column by Pinarius and Furius, consuls in\r\n472,[1434] and the ancient law composed in archaic letters, mentioned\r\nin connection with the year 363,[1435] requiring the praetor maximus to\r\ndrive the nail on the ides of September, must accordingly have been acts,\r\nnot of the centuriate assembly, but of the pontifical college. By the\r\nratification of the Twelve Tables, composed chiefly of private laws and\r\nof closely connected religious regulations, an example was set for the\r\ninvasion of both of these legal spheres by the centuriate assembly. But\r\nthe precedent remained unproductive; for at this time the tribal assembly\r\nunder plebeian or patrician magistrates was recognized as competent for\r\nlegislation, and naturally took to itself the function of enacting the\r\nless weighty, for a time generally the non-constitutional, laws.[1436]\r\nWe are not to imagine the field of legislation clearly divided into\r\nconstitutional, private, religious, and other departments; aside from\r\nthe question of declaring an offensive war, which remained strictly the\r\nprovince of the comitia centuriata, the distinction in legislation was\r\nsimply between the more and the less important; the dignified assembly of\r\ncenturies, organized on an aristocratic-timocratic basis, was entrusted\r\nwith the weightier business, whereas the simpler tribal assembly, which\r\nwas easier to summon and more expeditious in action, served well enough\r\nfor the despatch of lighter business. The question of the assembly to\r\nbe employed was largely one of inertia; it required a far greater force\r\nof circumstances to set in motion for legislative purposes the cumbrous\r\ncenturiate assembly than the relatively mobile gathering of the tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Judicial_\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the people in whatever assembly was confined to\r\ncases of crime and of serious disobedience to magistrates.[1437] It was\r\nnot exercised by them in the first instance but only by way of appeal.\r\nIn the opinion of the Romans Tullus Hostilius was the first to grant\r\nan appeal,[1438] necessarily to the comitia curiata, which under the\r\nkings remained the only formally voting assembly.[1439] During the regal\r\nperiod, the well attested appellate function of the comitia[1440] was\r\nsimply precarious, depending wholly on the pleasure of the king.[1441]\r\nThe Romans represented the advance in liberty brought by the republic\r\nas consisting partly in the establishment of the right of appeal for\r\nevery citizen through the lex de provocatione of Valerius,[1442] a\r\nconsul of the first year of the republic—according to Cicero the first\r\nlaw carried through the comitia centuriata—providing that no magistrate\r\nshould scourge or put to death a citizen without granting him an appeal\r\nto the people.[1443] Although the historical existence of this Valerius\r\nhas been questioned, and though his law has the appearance of being an\r\nanticipation of the Valerian law of 449, or more closely of that of\r\n300,[1444] we must admit in favor of its reality that the decemvirs were\r\nthemselves exceptionally above appeal and that their laws guaranteed to\r\nthe citizens an extensive use of the right.[1445] The appellant, however,\r\nhad no legal means of enforcing his right against the magistrate; he\r\ncould do no more than “throw himself on the mercy of the crowd, and\r\ntrust that their shouts or murmurs would bend the magistrate to respect\r\nthe law.”[1446] The first lex Valeria, accordingly, brought little\r\nreal benefit to the citizens.[1447] The right was recognized and its\r\napplication extended, as intimated above, by the Twelve Tables, in which\r\nvarious laws relating not only to capital crimes but to some of less\r\nimportance granted an appeal to the people.[1448] It was provided also by\r\na special statute of the code that judgments as well as laws involving\r\nlife or citizenship could be passed only by the comitiatus maximus, which\r\nis evidently the comitia centuriata.[1449]\r\n\r\nThe Valerian-Horatian law of appeal, 449, was directed against the\r\nrecurrence of the decemvirate or any similar magistracy with absolute\r\njurisdiction, and hence resembled neither the laws of the Twelve Tables\r\nreferring to the subject nor the Valerian law of 509. It provided that\r\nany one who brought about the election of such a magistracy might be put\r\nto death with impunity,[1450] and is alleged to have been reinforced by a\r\nDuillian plebiscite of the same year, which set the penalty of scourging\r\nand death for the same offence.[1451] These regulations could not refer\r\nto the dictatorship, which was appointive not elective, and which\r\ncontinued to possess absolute jurisdiction for more than a century after\r\nthe decemviral legislation.[1452]\r\n\r\nBut legal rights by no means imply actual enjoyment; and the decemviral\r\nlaws of appeal must have long remained substantially inoperative through\r\nlack of a power sufficiently interested in their enforcement; “the might\r\nof the few was stronger than the liberty of the commons.”[1453] The\r\nright was limited, too, by the first milestone,[1454] and hence did not\r\naffect the imperium militiae.[1455] The only punishment of a magistrate\r\nfor refusal to grant an appeal even by the Valerian law of 300, was to\r\nbe deemed wicked.[1456] Furthermore the oft-recurring dictatorship was\r\nunrestricted by the law, being in this respect a temporary restoration of\r\nthe regal office.[1457] Not till after the enactment of the last Valerian\r\nstatute did the people begin to enjoy in fact the privilege which had\r\nlong been constitutionally theirs. The enforcement of the law, as in\r\ngeneral of the rights of the citizens, was chiefly due to the plebeian\r\ntribunate, “the only sure protection even of oppressed patricians,”[1458]\r\nbut itself a limitation on the jurisdiction of the assembly.[1459] At\r\nsome unknown date after 325[1460] the dictator’s authority within the\r\ncity was subjected to appeal; and it has accordingly been suggested that\r\nthis limitation was due to the Valerian law of 300.[1461]\r\n\r\nThe practical establishment of the right of appeal ordinarily led the\r\nmagistrate in the exercise of his disciplinary power to substitute light\r\nfines and imprisonment, which he had full power to enforce, for the\r\nheavier penalty of scourging.[1462] But in case of crimes, especially\r\nperduellio and parricidium, public sentiment compelled him to prosecute\r\nthe accused to the full extent of the law. In the former accusation the\r\nconsul of the early republic appointed duumviri perduellioni iudicandae\r\nfor each case as it arose.[1463] This office is obscure because, without\r\nbeing formally abolished, it fell early into disuse, its function\r\npassing to the tribunate of the plebs. Of the three cases attributed by\r\nthe sources to these duumviri, that of Horatius[1464] belongs to the\r\nregal period, and is a mythical prototype of the republican procedure.\r\nThe offence has the appearance of parricidium. Only by the broadest\r\ninterpretation could perduellio be made to cover the murder of a\r\nsister.[1465] The second case is that of M. Manlius, 384, according\r\nto the more credible account,[1466] whereas Livy[1467] himself is of\r\nthe opinion that the prosecutors were the plebeian tribunes. We may\r\nconclude, then, that the duumviri were still employed at this date.[1468]\r\nThe third case is an unsuccessful attempt in 63 to revive the office\r\nfor the trial of C. Rabirius.[1469] The first republican law of appeal\r\nmust have empowered the comitia to order the appointment of these\r\nofficials by the magistrate;[1470] and it seems probable that at a later\r\ndate unknown to us they began to be elected by the people.[1471] The\r\nfunction of the duumviri was to try the case and pronounce sentence, from\r\nwhich if condemnatory the accused had a right to appeal to the comitia\r\ncenturiata.[1472] From the analogy offered by the questorian procedure we\r\nmay infer that the duumviri requested from a higher magistrate permission\r\nto take auspices for that assembly, over which they presided in the final\r\ntrial.[1473]\r\n\r\nAll capital crimes committed by a citizen against another were in a\r\nsimilar way referred by the consuls to the quaestores parricidii as\r\ntheir deputies.[1474] The activity of these officials is first mentioned\r\nby the annalists in connection with the trial of Sp. Cassius, not for\r\nmurder but for perduellio.[1475] Lange’s[1476] explanation that the\r\nquaestors were appointed duumviri for the trial would satisfy all\r\nrequirements; yet in myths of this kind we need not expect absolute legal\r\nconsistency.[1477] According to another, perhaps even earlier, version he\r\nwas tried and condemned at home by his father.[1478] The second instance\r\nis the trial of M. Volscius, 459, for false testimony,[1479] which was\r\nlikewise a capital crime. Their judicial competence was recognized by\r\nthe Twelve Tables;[1480] and two capital cases are assigned to their\r\njurisdiction after the decemvirate, (1) that of Camillus on an accusation\r\nvariously stated by the ancient authorities;[1481] he avoided capital\r\nprosecution before the centuries by retiring into exile, and in his\r\nabsence was condemned by the tribes to a fine of 15,000 or perhaps\r\n100,000 asses: (2) that of T. Quinctius Trogus brought by the quaestor M.\r\nSergius,[1482] which must have taken place after 242.[1483] The reason\r\nfor the fewness of the known cases is to be sought in the circumstance\r\nthat their jurisdiction was substantially limited to common crimes,\r\nwhereas political crimes came at first before the duumviri and afterward\r\nbefore the tribunes of the plebs.[1484] The criminal jurisdiction of\r\nthe quaestors must have continued till the institution of standing\r\nquaestiones.[1485]\r\n\r\nWhile the importance of the comitia centuriata as a criminal court was\r\nenhanced by the lex Valeria Horatia and the Duillian plebiscite of 449,\r\nwhich prohibited the election of a magistrate with absolute jurisdiction,\r\nthe number of officials competent to bring capital actions before this\r\nassembly was increased as a result of that law of the Twelve Tables which\r\nenacted that all resolutions concerning the caput of a Roman citizen\r\nshould be offered to the centuries only.[1486] Thereafter the tribunes\r\nwere required to prefer their capital accusations before this assembly,\r\nfor the summoning of which they, like the quaestors and the duumviri\r\nperduellioni iudicandae, requested the auspices of a higher magistrate,\r\nordinarily after 367 of a praetor.[1487] For a time, probably till\r\nthe Hortensian legislation, they were dependent upon the patrician\r\nmagistrates for this privilege.[1488] According to our sources the\r\ntribunes, with the approval of the consuls,[1489] entered upon their new\r\nsphere of judicial activity by bringing a capital charge against Appius\r\nClaudius and Sp. Oppius, past decemvirs, for misconduct in office, the\r\nspecific charge being the abuse of justice in the interest of a person or\r\nof a party.[1490] The suicide of the accused prevented the trial. On the\r\neight remaining decemvirs they passed in the same assembly a sentence of\r\nexile.[1491] M. Claudius, too, condemned for false testimony, was exiled,\r\nthe death penalty being mitigated also in his case.[1492] The tribunes\r\nof 439 are said to have accused L. Minucius and C. Servilius Ahala for\r\nthe part they had taken in the death of Sp. Maelius, and two years\r\nafterward Servilius was sentenced to exile by the comitia centuriata, to\r\nbe recalled later by the same body. The charge against the former was\r\nfalse testimony, against the latter the putting to death of a citizen\r\nwho had not been legally sentenced.[1493] Livy next mentions a charge,\r\nprobably of perduellio, brought by the tribunes against Q. Fabius, 390,\r\nfor having, in violation of the ius gentium, fought against the Gauls\r\nwhile he was an ambassador to them. He, too, is said to have died before\r\nthe trial.[1494] All these cases are uncertain. If historical, they\r\nmay represent the beginnings of capital jurisdiction of the tribunes,\r\nin rivalry with the duumviri; or they may in reality, like the case\r\nof M. Manlius, 384, already mentioned, have been duumviral. On either\r\nalternative they came before the centuriate comitia.\r\n\r\nAs we approach firmer historical ground, we hear of three accusations\r\nof unnatural lust alleged to have been brought by the tribunes of the\r\nplebs before the same comitia: (1) that against L. Papirius, 326,[1495]\r\n(2) that against L. or M. Laetorius Mergus, a military tribune, quod\r\ncornicularium suum stupri causa appellasset,[1496] (3) the case mentioned\r\nby Pliny and others against a person of unknown name, which probably\r\nbelongs to this period.[1497] The second case seems to be a trial of\r\nofficial accountability, which fell within tribunician jurisdiction\r\naccording to the usage of historical time; the others are too little\r\nknown to be legally formulated.\r\n\r\nIn this period falls the attempted prosecution of Appius Claudius Caecus,\r\n310, on the ground that he had not laid down the censorship at the end of\r\nthe limit of eighteen months.[1498] The accusing tribune ordered him to\r\nbe seized and imprisoned, but three colleagues interceded.[1499] About\r\nthe same time M. Atilius Calatinus was unsuccessfully prosecuted on a\r\ncharge of having betrayed Sora,[1500] probably in connection with the\r\ndefection of that town to the Samnites in 315.[1501]\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the cases said to have been brought by tribunes before\r\nthe comitia centuriata it is surprising to find the period from the\r\ninstitution of the office to the trial of Q. Fabius, 390, swarming with\r\nsuch prosecutions, whereas for the century intervening between that date\r\nand the Hortensian legislation comparatively few cases are recorded and\r\nthose of little significance.[1502] These circumstances tend to prove\r\nthat the cases assigned to the earlier and less known period either\r\nbelong mostly to the jurisdiction of the duumviri or of the quaestors\r\nrather than of the tribunes, or are in great part mythical, and that\r\nthe tribunes, therefore, exercised no extensive capital jurisdiction\r\nbefore the enactment of the Hortensian law.[1503] We are led thence to\r\nthe conclusion that either by an article of the statute of Hortensius or\r\nat least as a recognized consequence of the high place in the government\r\nassured the tribunes by it, the jurisdiction of these magistrates in\r\npolitical cases was freed from every restraint. At this time they\r\nsucceeded wholly to the place of the duumviri. The cases of which the\r\ntribunes had cognizance were thereafter exclusively political, whereas\r\nthe questorian jurisdiction was confined to murder and other common\r\ncrimes. This distinction was not a limitation upon the power of the\r\ntribunes, who if they chose might have superseded the quaestors as\r\neasily as they had superseded the duumviri. It was rather a division\r\nof functions adopted by the tribunes themselves in view of their own\r\npolitical character and on the basis of the relative dignity of the two\r\noffices. The chief judicial function of the tribunes, accordingly, was to\r\nhold officials responsible for their administration, though occasionally\r\nthey called private persons to account for their conduct as citizens. All\r\ngrades of officials were within their jurisdiction, but most of the cases\r\nwere against the higher magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe first tribunician case of the kind after the Hortensian legislation,\r\nand the first which is absolutely free from historical doubt, is that\r\nbrought against P. Claudius Pulcher on the ground that as consul, 249,\r\nhe fought the naval battle off Drepana contrary to auspices, thereby\r\nlosing his fleet. After the comitia had been interrupted by a storm, the\r\nintercession of colleagues against the resumption of the trial saved him\r\nfrom the death penalty. As the result of a new trial before the tribes,\r\nhowever, he was fined 120,000 asses, 1000 for each ship lost.[1504]\r\nHis colleague, L. Junius, by suicide escaped condemnation on a charge\r\nof perduellio.[1505] In 212 two tribunes of the plebs prosecuted M.\r\nPostumius Pyrgensis, a publican, before the tribes for fraud, setting\r\nthe penalty at 200,000 asses; but the accused with his friends violently\r\nbroke up the assembly, whereupon the tribunes, dropping the original\r\ncharge, prosecuted him for perduellio,[1506] we should suppose before the\r\ncenturies.[1507] Among the complaints urged against him by the consuls\r\nin the senate were that “he had wrested from the Roman people the right\r\nof suffrage, had broken up a concilium plebis, had reduced the tribunes\r\nto the rank of private persons, had marshalled an army against the Roman\r\npeople, seized a position, and cut the tribunes off from the plebs,\r\nand had prevented the tribes from being called to vote.” Specifically\r\nthe crime must have been perduellio.[1508] Before the day of trial he\r\nwithdrew into exile. In his absence the plebs on the motion of Sp.\r\nand L. Carvilius decreed that he was legally in banishment, that his\r\nproperty should be confiscated, and that he should be interdicted from\r\nfire and water. In this connection it should be noticed that whereas the\r\nbanishment of a citizen by lex or iudicium was the exclusive right of the\r\ncenturies,[1509] the tribes were competent to decree him an exile after\r\nhis voluntary retirement.[1510] Some of the coadjutors in the violence\r\nof the publican above mentioned left their bail and followed him into\r\nexile; others were imprisoned to await capital trial, with what result\r\nthe historian does not inform us.[1511]\r\n\r\nIn the same year Cn. Fulvius, a praetor, met with military reverses\r\nthrough gross cowardice,[1512] and in the following was prosecuted in a\r\nfinable action by a tribune of the plebs for having corrupted his army\r\nby the example of his unsoldierly habits. Finding in the course of the\r\ntrial that the fault of the magistrate was far more serious than had\r\nbeen imagined, and that the people were in a temper to vote the extreme\r\npenalty, the prosecutor changed the form of accusation to perduellio\r\non the ground that such cowardly conduct in a commander threatened the\r\nexistence of the state. In this instance, too, the accused avoided trial\r\nby withdrawing into exile.[1513] In 204 by a decree of the senate a\r\nspecial commission, consisting of the praetor for Sicily with a council\r\nof ten senators,[1514] was appointed for the trial of a legate of\r\nScipio, Q. Pleminius, on the charge that he had robbed the temple of\r\nPersephone in Locri and had violently oppressed the Locrians.[1515] The\r\ncommission brought him and his accomplices in chains to Rome and cast\r\nthem in prison to await their trial for life before the centuries.[1516]\r\nThe day of trial was continually deferred, till finally Pleminius, now\r\ncharged with the instigation of a plot to burn the city, was put to\r\ndeath in prison.[1517] The fate of his accomplices is unknown.[1518]\r\nLivy[1519] remarks that while Pleminius was languishing in jail the\r\nwrath of the populace gradually changed to sympathy, to such an extent\r\ndoubtless as to convince the authorities of their inability to secure a\r\npopular verdict in favor of the death penalty. In fact since the death\r\nof M. Manlius Capitolinus, 384, no example of the execution of a death\r\nsentence pronounced by the assembly is recorded in history.[1520] But\r\nthe magistrate probably often inflicted corporal punishment in violation\r\nof the third Valerian law. To put an end to this abuse, and at the same\r\ntime to embody in legal form the popular feeling against the application\r\nof the death penalty to citizens, a Porcian law absolutely forbade the\r\nscourging or slaying of a citizen under the imperium domi, the article\r\nprohibiting the sentence of death being afterward reënforced by other\r\nenactments.[1521] There has been much discussion as to the authorship\r\nof this law; probably it was the work of M. Porcius Cato the Elder in\r\nhis praetorship, 198.[1522] Another Porcian law, probably of P. Porcius\r\nLaeca, praetor in 195, extended the right of appeal to Roman citizens\r\nwho were engaged in the affairs of peace outside the city, in Italy and\r\nthe provinces, and were therefore under the military imperium.[1523]\r\nAccording to this law the citizen who appealed was sent to Rome for trial\r\nby the appropriate civil authorities. Still later the third Porcian law,\r\nwhich Lange[1524] conjecturally assigns to L. Porcius Licinus, consul in\r\nthe year of the elder Cato’s censorship, 184, seems to have been passed\r\nfor the benefit of Roman soldiers. We learn from Polybius,[1525] who\r\nwrote later than the date last mentioned, that the military tribunes\r\nwere accustomed in court-martial to condemn common soldiers for neglect\r\nof sentinel duty and that the condemned were cudgeled and stoned, often\r\nto death, by their fellow-soldiers. He also speaks of the punishment of\r\nentire maniples by decimation. Under Scipio Aemilianus, 133, the Roman\r\nwho neglected duty was flogged with vine stocks, the foreigner with\r\ncudgels.[1526] Cicero[1527] intimates that in his own time there was no\r\nappeal from the judgment of commanders; and in fact it is impossible to\r\nunderstand how discipline could otherwise be maintained. Evidence to the\r\ncontrary is scant and uncertain. The person against whom an accusation\r\nof desertion was brought before the tribunes of the plebs in 138 seems\r\nto have claimed to be a civilian, and on that ground appealed to the\r\ntribunes. When proved guilty he was flogged and sold as a slave, probably\r\nby a judgment of the military authorities.[1528] In 122 Livius Drusus\r\nproposed to exempt Latin soldiers from flogging.[1529] While informing\r\nus that in 108 a commander had a right to scourge and put to death a\r\nLatin official, Sallust[1530] intimates that he had less authority over\r\na Roman. In the time of the emperors, on the other hand, soldiers were\r\nsubject to the death penalty as in the time of Polybius.[1531] All\r\nthese circumstances may be best explained by supposing that the third\r\nPorcian law permitted the infliction of flogging and death on Roman\r\nsoldiers by the judgment only of a court-martial.[1532] This difficult\r\nsubject is further complicated by the statement of Cicero[1533] that\r\nthe three Porcian statutes introduced nothing new excepting by way of\r\npenalty. Interpreted in the light of other information given by various\r\nauthors, including Cicero himself, these statutes simply extended the\r\nright of appeal by adapting the Valerian principle to new conditions,\r\nand substituted exile in place of scourging and death. In the relation\r\nbetween the accused and the civil court the cry “civis Romanus sum” was\r\nthereafter a sufficient protection from bodily injury.[1534]\r\n\r\nIn the period to which the Porcian laws belong falls the accusation of\r\nperduellio brought by the tribune P. Rutilius Rufus against the censors\r\nC. Claudius and Ti. Sempronius Gracchus, while they were in office, 169.\r\nThe charge against Gracchus was disregard of the tribunician auxilium,\r\nagainst his colleague the interruption of a concilium plebis (quod\r\ncontionem ab se avocasset). The accused, foregoing the privilege of\r\ntheir magistracy, consented to a trial, which came before the comitia\r\ncenturiata. Claudius narrowly escaped condemnation, whereupon the case\r\nagainst Gracchus was dropped.[1535]\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of special judiciary commissions and the\r\ninstitution of standing courts limited more and more the judicial\r\nactivity of the centuriate assembly; but the tribunes of the plebs kept\r\nalive the feeling of popular sovereignty in this sphere by the occasional\r\nprosecution of some notorious offender.[1536] The continuance of the\r\ncenturiate judicial function is proved by the Cassian plebiscite of 137,\r\nwhich provided for the use of the ballot in all iudicia populi excepting\r\nin perduellio,[1537] and by the lex Caelia, 108, which removed the\r\nexception.[1538]\r\n\r\nThe limitation upon popular jurisdiction by the special court is said\r\nto have begun as early as 414, when, according to Livy,[1539] a senatus\r\nconsultum authorized the appointment of a quaestio extraordinaria to\r\ndiscover and punish the murderers of M. Postumius, a tribune of the\r\nsoldiers with consular power. The plebs, consulted as to the presidency\r\nof the court, left it to the consuls. The instance may be an anticipation\r\nof later usage. The case of wholesale poisoning by Roman matrons, 331,\r\nwas investigated, and a hundred and seventy matrons were condemned,\r\nby an extraordinary court, which evidently owed its existence to a\r\nsenatus consultum without the coöperation of the people.[1540] The\r\nsame is true of the quaestio appointed by the senate under dictatorial\r\npresidency in 314 to inquire into charges of conspiracy of the leading\r\nmen in certain allied states. The dictator extended the inquiry to\r\nRome, and after his resignation the consuls continued the work. Livy’s\r\naccount of this affair assumes that the senate had full power to appoint\r\nsuch commissions.[1541] It did in fact possess the right without the\r\ncoöperation of the people to institute quaestiones extraordinariae for\r\nthe trial of allies or other aliens in crimes which menaced the security\r\nof Rome. In the period between the Hortensian legislation and the Gracchi\r\nin two recorded instances it dared on its own responsibility to appoint\r\nsuch courts for the trial of citizens.[1542] These were usurpations; for\r\nas the laws of appeal forbade the putting to death of a citizen unless\r\ncondemned by the people, a special court with capital jurisdiction\r\nover citizens could not be constitutionally established excepting with\r\nthe consent of the assembly. This right of the people was considered a\r\nlegislative equivalent of their judicial power, which the vast expansion\r\nof their state made it impossible for them directly to exercise.[1543]\r\nThe court which tried and condemned the insurgent garrison of Rhegium\r\nin 270 was instituted accordingly by a plebiscite authorized by a\r\nsenatus consultum.[1544] Most probably the court in this case was the\r\nsenate itself, just as in 210, when the plebiscite of L. Atilius gave\r\nit full power to judge and punish the Campanians for revolt.[1545] The\r\nappointment of special courts for the detection and punishment of aliens\r\nfor illegal usurpation of the citizenship, which belonged originally to\r\nthe senate, began in 177 to be shared by the people.[1546]\r\n\r\nSimilar in character to the special judiciary commission appointed by\r\nthe senate, but far more sweeping in effect, was the senatus consultum\r\nultimum (“videant consules, ne quid respublica detrimenti capiat”),\r\nwhich in crises armed the consuls with absolute power of life and death\r\nover the citizens.[1547] By these means the senate at its pleasure\r\ncircumvented the laws of appeal on the plea that the accused had\r\nceased to be citizens.[1548] Against this abuse Ti. Gracchus planned\r\na new law of appeal, which he did not live to see enacted.[1549]\r\nHis own followers were ruthlessly condemned without the privilege\r\nof appeal by an extraordinary quaestio under P. Popillius Laenas,\r\nconsul in 132.[1550] Probably a similar court was appointed after the\r\nrevolt of Fregellae.[1551] To put an end to such circumvention of a\r\nwell-established right of the people, C. Gracchus in his first tribunate,\r\n123, carrying into effect the plan of his brother, passed the often\r\nmentioned lex Sempronia de provocatione, which absolutely forbade capital\r\nsentence upon a citizen without an order of the people.[1552] The\r\nwording indicates that it was intended not to do away with extraordinary\r\ncourts and powers, but to allow their establishment in no other way than\r\nby popular vote.[1553] It reiterated, too, the article of the Porcian\r\nstatute which absolutely forbade the infliction of the death penalty on\r\ncivilians.[1554] Far, however, from transferring the jurisdiction of\r\nthe assembly to the quaestiones, the Sempronian law evidently confirmed\r\nthe right of the people by enacting that the tribunes might bring the\r\nviolator of that law before the comitia on a charge of perduellio, for\r\nwhich it mentioned the penalty of interdict from fire and water.[1555] It\r\nheld responsible not only the magistrate charged with the extraordinary\r\ncommission, but probably also the senator who moved or supported the\r\nmeasure which called it into being.[1556] The entire Sempronian law was\r\nmade retroactive, so as to cover the case of Popillius, who thereupon\r\nfled into exile to avoid trial. The interdict was accordingly decreed\r\nby the tribes on the motion of Gaius.[1557] Rupilius, the colleague of\r\nPopillius, seems to have suffered a similar punishment.[1558]\r\n\r\nIn 120 the tribune Decius prosecuted for perduellio L. Opimius, who,\r\nas consul in 121, armed with the senatus consultum ultimum, had caused\r\nthe death of C. Gracchus. The accused was acquitted.[1559] Ihne[1560]\r\nconsiders this prosecution to have been instigated by the optimates\r\nin order to settle once for all and in their favor the question as to\r\nthe legality of special courts which were called into being by an act\r\nof the senate alone. In that case acquittal was a foregone conclusion.\r\nIn 119 the popular party met with greater success in the prosecution of\r\nC. Papirius Carbo, whom it hated as a renegade.[1561] The charge was\r\nprobably perduellio, though the details are unknown.[1562]\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the comitia in criminal cases suffered more extensive\r\ncurtailment from the standing courts,—quaestiones perpetuae,—the first\r\nof which was established in 149 for the trial of Roman officials accused\r\nof extortion—repetundae—committed in the provinces or in Italy.[1563] As\r\nthe object of the prosecutors was in the main the recovery of extorted\r\nproperty, the court was essentially civil, and seemed, therefore, to\r\nthe Romans no infringement of popular rights; yet even before Sulla\r\nthe principle began to apply to distinctly criminal cases.[1564]\r\nNotwithstanding this development several accusations were brought\r\nbefore the centuriate assembly in the period between the Gracchi and\r\nSulla.[1565] The latter increased the number of quaestiones to seven and\r\nbrought all crimes within their cognizance. The questorian jurisdiction\r\nin cases of murder had already passed to the quaestio inter sicarios,\r\nestablished between 149 and 141;[1566] and now Sulla transferred cases\r\nof perduellio from the jurisdiction of the tribunes to the quaestio\r\nmaiestatis.[1567] Although restored to the tribunes in 70, it was for the\r\nremainder of the republican period exercised by them on special occasions\r\nonly, for the quaestio maiestatis still existed. With the establishment\r\nof the principate the jurisdiction of the people finally vanished.[1568]\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary character of the period after Sulla is illustrated\r\nby the case of perduellio against C. Rabirius[1569] brought in 63 by\r\na tribune of the plebs, T. Atius Labienus. Rabirius was charged with\r\ncomplicity in the murder of L. Appuleius Saturninus, the famous tribune\r\nof the year 100. Labienus proposed and carried a plebiscite requiring the\r\npraetor to appoint duumviri for the trial, whereas it was generally held\r\nat the time that these officials should have been elected by the people.\r\nIt was also enacted, in violation of the Porcian and Sempronian laws,\r\nthat in case of conviction the accused should be crucified on the Campus\r\nMartius. C. and L. Caesar, appointed duumviri, brought the case before\r\nthe comitia centuriata, which were prevented from giving their verdict\r\nby the removal of the flag from Janiculum.[1570] The object of the trial\r\nwas not to punish the guilty, but to discredit the senate, to which the\r\naccused belonged.[1571] The decline of the idea of popular sovereignty is\r\nfurther indicated by the agrarian rogation of the tribune P. Servilius\r\nRullus, 63, an article of which, in violation of the lex Valeria Horatia\r\nde provocatione, ordered the appointment of decemviri agris adsignandis\r\nwithout appeal.[1572]\r\n\r\nThe procedure was the same in all finable and capital actions. In a\r\ncase subject to appeal the magistrate, after a preliminary inquiry\r\n(quaestio), summoned the people to contio on the third day[1573] for a\r\nthorough examination (anquisitio).[1574] The trumpeter blew his horn\r\nbefore the door of the accused, and cited him to appear at daybreak in\r\nthe place of assembly.[1575] Acting as accuser, the magistrate addressed\r\nthe contio and produced his witnesses. Then came the witnesses for the\r\ndefence, the statement of the accused, and the pleading of his counsel.\r\nThese proceedings filled three contiones separated from one another by\r\na day’s interval. At the end of the third day’s session the magistrate\r\nacquitted the accused or condemned him and fixed the penalty. In case\r\nof condemnation, the accused if dissatisfied appealed. The magistrate\r\nthen put his sentence in the form of a rogation and set a date for the\r\ncomitia,[1576] which could be held only after an interval of a trinum\r\nnundinum,[1577] unless the accused desired an earlier trial.[1578]\r\nSome scholars, however, hold the theory that a magistrate, recognizing\r\nthe limitation of his competence, might bring the case directly to the\r\ncomitia without the formality of a condemnation and appeal.[1579] The\r\npenalty proposed in the rogation was not necessarily the same as at\r\nfirst announced; for the trial might bring to light facts to mitigate or\r\nto aggravate the sentence. The presentation of the case to the comitia\r\nby the magistrate was termed the fourth accusation.[1580] If anything\r\nprevented the voting in the comitia, the accused was discharged,[1581]\r\nand could not be legally brought to trial again for the same offence\r\nexcepting under a different form of action.[1582]\r\n\r\n    Schulze, C.

As strictly plebeian officials they\r\nhad no authority to summon patricians, to exclude them from the place\r\nof assembly,[1592] or to condemn them judicially.[1593] It follows that\r\ntheir alleged prosecutions of past consuls for maladministration[1594]\r\nare fictions[1595]—an anticipation of their jurisdiction at a later age.\r\nDirectly they possessed no power of judgment or of coercion;[1596] but\r\nfor the enforcement of the auxilium and of the ius agendi cum plebe their\r\npersons were made sacred—sacro sancti—by an oath which the plebs swore at\r\nthe time they instituted the office,[1597] namely that any one who killed\r\na tribune or aedile of the plebs or did him bodily harm, or who commanded\r\nanother to inflict harm or death upon him might as a person devoted to\r\nJupiter be killed with impunity, and his property be confiscated.[1598]\r\nThe avenger was necessarily either a private plebeian or an official of\r\nthe plebs.[1599] The formal act which rendered the tribunes sacred was\r\ntermed a lex sacrata. The essence of such a law is (1) that it was sworn\r\nto by the community—in this instance by the community of plebs, (2) that\r\nthe offender against it became a homo sacer and could be put to death\r\nwith impunity.[1600] This idea of sanctity the plebeians may have derived\r\npartly from the Greek asylum;[1601] but it seems also to have been\r\ninfluenced by the condition of ambassadors, hence the later, ill-founded\r\nconception of the plebs as a state, and of the plebeian officials and\r\nother institutions as based on a treaty ratified with fetial ceremonies\r\nbetween the patrician government and the seceding plebs.[1602] Though\r\ntermed lex sacrata because it was passed and sworn to in the community,\r\nas it were, of the plebs, like any plebiscite of this period the\r\nresolution had no legal validity for the state or for the patricians.\r\nUnder compulsion, however, the government yielded to the demands of the\r\nplebeians without formally acknowledging the sanctity of their officials;\r\nso that the patricians, by asserting that Roman law did not recognize\r\nan inviolability founded purely on religion,[1603] could afterward deny\r\nthat the tribunes were really sacrosanct. Till the enactment of the\r\nValerian-Horatian laws of 449,[1604] accordingly, the inviolability of\r\nthe tribunes existed in so far only as the plebeians were in a position\r\nto maintain it by holding over their opponents and over the government\r\nthe threat of violence and revolution. That under the circumstances\r\ndomestic peace was on the whole preserved should be credited to the\r\norderly character of the great mass of citizens.\r\n\r\nApplied to the holding of contiones and comitia, this inviolability\r\nprotected the presiding tribune from interruption, contradiction, and\r\nevery disturbance. The principle was afterward extended to verbal abuse\r\nanywhere publicly indulged in.[1605] Even if a man showed disrespect\r\nby not stepping out of the way of a tribune who was passing along\r\nthe street, he was liable to the death penalty.[1606] Under normal\r\nconditions, however, the rigorous execution of this lex sacrata could\r\nnot be thought of; in place of outlawing the offender against his person\r\nthe tribune was ordinarily willing to impose a fine upon him, from\r\nwhich an appeal might be made to the plebeian assembly; or in cases of\r\nviolence to his person, he might resort to capital prosecution, which\r\nwas likewise appealable. These principles were formulated in an alleged\r\nIcilian plebiscite of the year 492.[1607] From what has just been said\r\nit is clear that the tribune’s coercive[1608] and judicial functions\r\nresulted, not from usurpation as has often been asserted,[1609] but\r\nfrom a mitigation of the harsh lex sacrata. In a word, the ultimate\r\nbasis of tribunician authority was the revolutionary power of the plebs,\r\nupon which rested the sanctity of the tribunes, and thereon their\r\njurisdiction. Of the judicial activity attributed by the annalists to\r\nthe plebeian officials in the period before the decemvirs we do not know\r\nhow much is mythical; but it is safe to say that all the capital cases,\r\nprobably all the cases without qualification, which they actually settled\r\nas judges were submitted to by the patrician government for the sake of\r\npeace, without being accepted as legal.\r\n\r\nTo the third year of the tribunate, 491, is assigned the first mentioned\r\nexercise of tribunician jurisdiction. C. Marcius Coriolanus, the\r\naccused, had advocated in the senate the abolition of the tribunician\r\noffice,[1610] and had done personal violence to the aediles, in this\r\nway rendering himself liable to the penalty of the lex sacrata on which\r\nrested the sanctity of the plebeian officials. Instead of declaring him\r\na homo sacer, a tribune brought him to trial before the tribes, which\r\ncondemned him by a narrow majority.[1611] The story is now regarded by\r\nall scholars as a myth. The vote by tribes at this early time is either\r\nexceptional or more likely an anticipation of later usage.[1612]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Icilian plebiscite a capital charge is said to\r\nhave been brought by a tribune of the plebs against Kaeso Quinctius on\r\nthe ground that he had repeatedly driven the tribunes from the Forum and\r\nhad dispersed their assembly.[1613] After providing sureties the accused\r\nwent into exile,[1614] and the sentence of banishment was passed—in\r\nCicero’s opinion by the comitia centuriata, in Livy’s by the tribal\r\ncomitia of plebs, 461.[1615] Another case prior to the decemvirate is\r\nrecorded for the year 455. Representatives of three illustrious patrician\r\nfamilies were charged with having disturbed an assembly under tribunician\r\npresidency. Their estates were forfeited to Ceres.[1616] Naturally under\r\nthis arrangement between the plebs and the government there was room for\r\nmuch misunderstanding: the leaders of the plebs stretched their claims to\r\nthe uttermost; and the patricians, after granting the radical concession,\r\nendeavored to recall as much of it as possible. They plausibly urged that\r\nwhile the sacrosanctitas, so far as it existed,[1617] might protect the\r\nperson of the tribune, it gave him no authority over a patrician;[1618]\r\nand their position as the sole holders of political power and the\r\nsole repositories of law and usage enabled them before the decemviral\r\nlegislation by stubborn, skilful perseverance in the details of political\r\nwarfare almost to throw the tribunician sanctity into oblivion.[1619]\r\nLivy tells us that in the assembly appointed for the trial of the past\r\nconsuls L. Furius and C. Manlius, the accusing tribune failed to appear,\r\nand was found murdered in his home; and the historian gives us to\r\nunderstand that the crime was the result of a private conference among\r\nthe patricians.[1620] Dio Cassius[1621] states that they secretly slew a\r\nnumber of the boldest spirits among the plebeians. Though these stories\r\nare mythical, they reflect at least the opinion of the historians that\r\nin this early period the sanctity of the tribune counted for little.\r\nIf it failed to protect his person, it could have given him no great\r\ndegree of recognized judicial competence. Under these circumstances\r\nwe should not expect to find the tribunes often bringing the power of\r\ntheir questioned sanctity into actual use in the early years of their\r\nexistence; but that before the decemvirate they exercised jurisdiction to\r\nsome extent even in capital cases, which were appealed to the assembly\r\nunder their presidency, is proved by a law of the Twelve Tables, which,\r\nto remedy what the legislators must have considered an abuse, provided\r\nthat accusations affecting the caput of a citizen should be brought only\r\nbefore the comitiatus maximus—evidently the comitia centuriata.[1622]\r\n\r\nIf the tribunes presumed to condemn men to death, they certainly would\r\nnot hesitate to fine them for lighter offences. For checking the power of\r\nthe magistrates to levy unlimited fines the consuls of 454, A. Aternius\r\nand Sp. Tarpeius, passed through the comitia centuriata a law which\r\nset the maximum fine to be levied by a magistrate on an individual in\r\nany one day at thirty cattle and two sheep, the minimum being a single\r\nsheep. In case he exceeded the former amount, an appeal could be made\r\nto the assembly.[1623] In the opinion of Dionysius[1624] this law was\r\ninterpreted to apply to all magistrates, including those of the plebs,\r\nand was made accordingly the basis of the tribunician jurisdiction in\r\nfinable offences. These consequences seem to have been drawn from the\r\nstatute, although the proposers may not have so intended it.[1625]\r\n\r\nSufficient evidence has now been offered that before the decemviral\r\nlegislation the plebeian tribunes exercised, on the basis of their\r\nsanctity, a vague jurisdiction in both finable and capital cases,\r\noccasionally submitted to by the patrician government though probably\r\nnot recognized by it as just or constitutional. For the same period\r\ntheir method of agitation by the obstruction of the levy,[1626] by\r\nharanguing the people in contiones,[1627] and occasionally by sedition,\r\nproves clearly the lack of legislative power through the assembly over\r\nwhich they presided, as well as their lack of veto on the acts of the\r\ngovernment. With reference to legislation the course of the discussion\r\nin the present and following chapters will make it evident that only\r\nby a provision of the Hortensian statute did plebiscites become\r\nunconditionally binding on the whole people. Although from the beginning\r\na tribune, as a member of a collegial office, could intercede against\r\nthe act of a colleague, he had in this period no legal right of the kind\r\nagainst the government; for had he now possessed it, as he did at a later\r\nage, he would have felt no need of obstructing the levy—a relatively\r\nslow, clumsy method of political warfare. It is to be noticed further\r\nthat the power of veto of the tribunes, after it had been acquired,\r\nrested upon their jurisdiction. If a magistrate persisted in ignoring\r\ntheir prohibition, his act remained valid but he rendered himself\r\nliable to tribunician prosecution.[1628] Necessarily, then, as long as\r\nthe tribunes lacked judicial competence (till the Valerian-Horatian\r\nlegislation, 449) they lacked the veto against governmental action;\r\nas long as their judicial competence depended upon the will of the\r\ngovernment (probably till the Hortensian legislation, 287), their veto\r\non the government must have been correspondingly limited. Finally it was\r\nnot till tribunician obstruction of the levy, sedition, and secession\r\ndisappear (that is, with the enactment of the Hortensian statute) that\r\nwe have a right to assume the existence of an unrestricted tribunician\r\nveto.[1629] The method of the tribunes in the pre-decemviral period\r\nwas, by the means above indicated, to force a proposed measure upon\r\nthe patrician magistrates, and to compel them to bring it before the\r\ncenturiate assembly in regular form.[1630]\r\n\r\nIn view of the circumstances that passed bills alone were recorded and\r\nhence could be known to posterity, we may reject as unauthentic all the\r\nalleged proposals of agrarian laws of this period,[1631] which however\r\nmay not have been free from agitation of the kind.\r\n\r\nA law of the year 471 gave the tribunician assembly a tribal\r\norganization. This measure, brought about by the agitation of Publilius\r\nVolero, tribune of the plebs of that year,[1632] must, for the reason\r\nabove mentioned, have been an act of the comitia centuriata.[1633] The\r\nmotive given by Livy was the desire of the tribunes to free themselves\r\nfrom the influence which the patricians through the votes of their\r\nclients exercised on the assembly.[1634] The curiae contained all\r\nthe citizens,[1635] the tribes none but the landowners. The tribal\r\norganization, therefore, excluded not all the clients but those only,\r\ntogether with any other citizens, who were landless.[1636] Probably\r\nin other ways the patricians had greater control of the curiate than\r\nof the tribal assemblies, although it is impossible to believe with\r\nDionysius[1637] that the essence of the change from the curiate to the\r\ntribal comitia consisted in the elimination of auspical influence. That\r\nthe law forbade the patricians to take part in tribunician assemblies, as\r\nZonaras[1638] imagines, is not probable, for it gave the tribune no new\r\nauthority over the patricians; he had power neither to summon them to his\r\nassembly nor to expel them from it.[1639] In fact we have evidence of the\r\npresence of patricians in tribunician assemblies after this date.[1640]\r\nThe so-called law of Publilius Volero, now under discussion, was confused\r\nby the sources with the Publilian law of 339, some of the provisions of\r\nthe later act being uncritically assigned to the earlier.[1641]\r\n\r\nThe statute of 471 imparted to the tribunician assembly no new function.\r\nAlthough in mentioning the bill Dionysius[1642] includes a proposal to\r\ngrant the assembly legislative power, when he comes to speak of the\r\nstatute as actually passed, he refers only to its provisions for the\r\nelection of plebeian tribunes and aediles by the tribes, herein agreeing\r\nwith Livy and other authorities.[1643]\r\n\r\nIn the same year four tribunes of the plebs were elected for the first\r\ntime.[1644] The increase was probably effected by an article of the\r\nstatute under discussion.\r\n\r\nTill after the decemviral legislation the comitia tributa,[1645]\r\nbrought into existence by the statute of 471, was restricted, as had\r\nbeen the tribunician comitia curiata, to the transaction of purely\r\nplebeian business. In the records of this period we find a continuance\r\nof apocryphal agrarian bills[1646] and condemnations of retired\r\nmagistrates.[1647] In reality the only political weapon of the tribunes,\r\naside from general agitation, continued to be the obstruction of the\r\nlevy,[1648] as is proved by their increase in number to ten.[1649]\r\nThe only agrarian law of the period, the so-called lex Icilia for the\r\ndivision of the Aventine among the people, was passed by the comitia\r\ncenturiata.[1650] The very circumstance that this mild concession to the\r\nplebs was couched in a lex sacrata[1651] shows how little faith the\r\ncommons had in the government.[1652]\r\n\r\nDuring this period the supreme power was the senate. Shortly after the\r\nfall of the kings it provided for the purchase of corn among neighboring\r\nstates in a time of scarcity, made a state monopoly of salt in the\r\ninterest of the poor, freed the plebs from port dues and tributum,\r\nthereby placing the whole burden of these taxes on the wealthy.[1653]\r\nThese acts imply legislative as well as administrative competence.\r\nForeign affairs,[1654] including the decision of war and peace, were in\r\nits hands. It resolved not to restore the property of the Tarquins,[1655]\r\ndecreed triumphs to victorious generals,[1656] the celebration of\r\ngames,[1657] the expulsion of the Volscians from the city in the time\r\nof a festival,[1658] controlled the magistrates, including the plebeian\r\ntribunate, by means of the dictatorship,[1659] or clothed the consuls\r\nwith absolute authority.[1660] Little room was left for the activity of\r\nthe assemblies.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these unfavorable conditions the tribunes of the\r\nplebs through obstruction of the levy and through their harangues\r\nin contiones[1661] were chiefly instrumental in bringing about the\r\ninstitution of the decemviri legibus scribundis. Actual votes in\r\ntribunician comitia on proposals looking to that end[1662] could have had\r\nno more than moral weight. Under popular pressure the consul Sestius,\r\n452, referred the question to the senate,[1663] and the bill for their\r\ninstitution was passed by comitia, doubtless of the centuries. The only\r\nvalid activity, therefore, of the tribal assembly prior to the decemviral\r\nlegislation, so far as is known, was the enactment of plebiscites, which\r\nlacked the force of law, the election of plebeian officials,[1664] and\r\nthe quasi-judicial decision of cases appealed to it by those who were\r\naccused of violating the tribunician sanctity.[1665]\r\n\r\nAn epoch was made in the history of the tribunate and of the tribal\r\nassembly by the consulship of Valerius and Horatius, 449, who proposed\r\nand carried a centuriate law[1666] which gave these institutions a legal\r\nbasis. The article which logically first claims our attention provided\r\nthat any one who injured the tribunes of the plebs, the aediles, or the\r\ndecemviral judges should be devoted to Jupiter, and his property should\r\nbe forfeit to the temple of Ceres, Liber, and Libera.[1667] According\r\nto Livy,[1668] who here represents the tribunician point of view, the\r\noriginal lex sacrata, passed on the Sacred Mount, was first renewed with\r\nappropriate ceremonies, thus reëstablishing the religious inviolability\r\nof the plebeian officials, whom then the article of the Valerian-Horatian\r\nstatute here mentioned rendered legally inviolable. The constitutional\r\nrelation of these two ideas was difficult even for the Romans to\r\ndetermine. Certain jurists, controverting the tribunician interpretation,\r\nasserted that this law made no person sacrosanct, but merely threatened\r\nwith capital punishment any one who injured the officials concerned,\r\nclothing them thus in the same kind of inviolability as that which\r\nprotected the ordinary magistrates.[1669] The object, according to this\r\nview, was not only to eliminate from the government the anomaly of a\r\npower sanctioned by religion only,[1670] but also to convert the plebeian\r\nofficials into state officials. The leaders of the plebs gladly accepted\r\nthe new position tendered them, without being willing however to withdraw\r\nfrom the old. Henceforth we have to deal, accordingly, with a group\r\nof legally recognized public functionaries who effectively claimed a\r\nreligious inviolability hard to reconcile with the constitution, in which\r\nthey were in time to make for themselves a disproportionate place.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the Valerian-Horatian statute was to the effect\r\nthat “whatever the plebs ordered in their tribal assembly should be\r\nvalid for the people”;[1671] so that henceforth plebiscites, when passed\r\nunder the conditions hereafter specified, were the equivalent of leges,\r\nas they were often so called. It is so similar to a provision of the\r\nlater Publilian and of the still later Hortensian statute that we should\r\nincline to reject it as an anticipation of the one or the other, were it\r\nnot for the fact that under it important plebi scita, as the Canuleian,\r\nthe Licinian-Sextian, and the Genucian, were passed.[1672] We must accept\r\nit, then, as historical, and adapt our interpretation to the few known\r\nfacts in the case.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the use of the word plebs to designate the tribal\r\ngathering under tribunician presidency, there is no valid reason for\r\nsupposing that the Valerian-Horatian law altered its composition—that\r\nthe patricians were now excluded.[1673] Dionysius[1674] is clearly\r\nof the opinion that they participated in this form of comitia both\r\nbefore and after the enactment of the statute under consideration; and\r\nLivy[1675] thinks of them as still present in the tribunician meetings\r\nas late as the struggle for the Licinian-Sextian laws. The problem must\r\nbe considered in connection with the development of the voting function\r\nof the assembly. Primitively the leaders (nobles) in council decided\r\nupon a measure, which they then submitted to the people to be accepted\r\nwith clamor and din.[1676] Although the acclamation was essentially an\r\nact of the masses, nothing forbade the nobles to join in the shouting.\r\nDoubtless in the tribal assemblies the expression of opinion within\r\nthe tribe continued for a time to be by acclamation.[1677] As long as\r\nthis primitive condition existed, a distinction could not be drawn\r\nbetween the right to be present and the right to join in the decision of\r\nquestions brought before the comitia. Undoubtedly the custom of voting\r\nby heads within the tribe was an imitation of a usage adopted by the\r\ncomitia centuriata some time after the institution of the latter;[1678]\r\nhence we could not reasonably assume its use by the tribes so early\r\nas the pre-decemviral period. The question therefore as to whether\r\nthe patricians, who were certainly present in meetings of the tribes,\r\nenjoyed the right of voting in them could not have arisen till after the\r\ndecemviral legislation. The plebeians had found it impossible by their\r\nown powers to exclude from their assembly the landless clients, who were\r\ninferior to themselves.[1679] Much less could they exclude the nobles.\r\nIf the presiding tribune could not prevent their remaining after the\r\npeople had been formed into voting groups, he could not prevent their\r\nvoting. As the patricians, equally with the plebeians, belonged to the\r\ntribes, the former, being men of superior privilege, could not lawfully\r\nbe debarred from meetings of their associations; and if they chose to\r\nattend, it was not for the tribunes of the plebs to decide as to the\r\nlaw in the matter. The word plebs in the statute is susceptible of an\r\neasy explanation. As the comitia curiata and comitia centuriata, under\r\npatrician presidents, had from the beginning been termed populus, nothing\r\ncould be more natural than that from the time an assembly convened\r\nunder plebeian presidency for plebeian objects, the latter should by\r\nway of distinction be termed plebs, even though the few patricians were\r\nincluded. Ordinarily the plebeians must have welcomed patricians to their\r\nassemblies, as the presence of magistrates and senators and their sons\r\nadded dignity and weight to the proceedings. But when the patricians used\r\nall their superior influence in both lawful and unlawful ways to block a\r\npopular measure, the tribunes, naturally wishing then to exclude them,\r\nattempted to establish the principle that tribunician assemblies were\r\nexclusively plebeian. This question was settled by the law of Publilius\r\nPhilo, 339.[1680]\r\n\r\nThis article of the Valerian-Horatian statute was a concession extorted\r\nfrom the patrician government by the strongest pressure, perhaps by a\r\nplebeian secession. The actual advantage which it brought to the plebs\r\nwas minimized, however, by the provision that the previous consent of\r\nthe senate was essential to the validity of bills brought before the\r\ntribunician assembly.[1681] The patricians could urge in support of this\r\narrangement that as their magistrates according to long established\r\ncustom always obtained the previous consent of the senate (senatus\r\nconsultum) to measures brought before any assembly, and were absolutely\r\nrequired to obtain senatorial sanction (patrum auctoritas) for curiate\r\nand centuriate laws and elections,[1682] the tribunes, who were free from\r\nthe trammels of the sanction, should be legally compelled to consult the\r\nsenate before bringing a measure into their assemblies, especially as\r\ntheir legislation was in a field hitherto monopolized by the patrician\r\nmagistrates and the senate. Although the tribunes of the plebs would\r\nhave preferred to understand by the term plebiscite all that it had\r\nmeant before—the unconditioned resolution of the tribal assembly under\r\ntheir presidency—they must have felt satisfied for the time being with\r\nthe great gain they had made, however strenuous they afterward became to\r\nrelieve themselves of senatorial control. This condition on the validity\r\nof the plebiscite is not expressly mentioned by Livy in connection with\r\nthe Valerian-Horatian legislation, but is assumed by the sources for the\r\nfollowing period.[1683] The same thing is clearly implied, too, in the\r\nlong series of political struggles which came after the enactment of the\r\nValerian-Horatian statute.[1684] Had the tribunes been free to legislate\r\nwithout interference on the part of the senate, they would have been in\r\na position easily to complete the social and political equalization of\r\nthe orders, and by one sweeping reform law to place themselves and their\r\nconstituents in the condition reached by an almost uninterrupted conflict\r\nof a hundred and sixty years (449-287).[1685]\r\n\r\nIt was in accordance with this regulation that another article of the\r\nValerian-Horatian statute directed the aediles of the plebs to preserve\r\nthe senatus consulta in the temple of Ceres.[1686] We cannot look\r\nupon these officials as keepers of the senatorial archives of that\r\ntime,[1687] and hence must conclude that the documents in their charge\r\nwere those decrees which authorized the presentation of tribunician\r\nbills, for with those alone the plebeians were directly concerned.\r\n\r\nThe patricians expected to find a further safeguard in the tribunician\r\nveto, which could be directed against a colleague.[1688] From the fact,\r\nhowever, that the tribunes continued to resort to the clumsy method of\r\nobstructing the levy, and afterward also of impeding the collection of\r\nthe tributum,[1689] we must infer that as yet their intercession did not\r\nprevail against a patrician magistrate.[1690] Various popular seditions,\r\ntoo, are mentioned for the same period (449-287).[1691] That one which\r\nled to the Hortensian legislation is historical, and it is hardly\r\npossible that all the others are fictions.\r\n\r\nAnother conservative check was the application of oblative auspices to\r\nthe plebeian assembly.[1692] Livy[1693] reports that in 293 the tribunes\r\nresigned because of a faulty election, held probably in violation of\r\noblativa. In general, however, the plebeian gathering was relatively free\r\nfrom religious control till after the enactment of the Aelian and Fufian\r\nlaws (about 150).[1694] It had the advantage of the comitia centuriata\r\n(1) in freedom from the impetrative auspices, (2) in freedom from the\r\npatrum auctoritas, (3) in mobility. Immediately after the adoption of\r\nthe Valerian-Horatian statute it must have become evident that the\r\ntribunician assembly, through the character of its presidency, its\r\ncomposition, and its democratic spirit, was to outstrip the centuriate\r\ngathering in energy and aggressiveness, and to be in a word the chief\r\nfactor of progress in legislation.\r\n\r\nNo enactment affecting the jurisdiction of tribunes is referred to\r\nValerius and Horatius by the ancient writers; and yet the arrangement by\r\nwhich they thereafter brought their capital actions before the centuries\r\ncould not have been made without the consent of the government. If,\r\non the other hand, the tribunes now possessed an unconditioned power\r\nto subject patricians, whether magistrates or private citizens, to\r\ncapital prosecutions, they would have found it so effective a means\r\nof political warfare as no longer to need obstruction and sedition in\r\ntheir struggle for plebeian rights. In capital cases the permission of a\r\nhigher magistrate, ordinarily after 367 the praetor, was required; and\r\nbefore the enactment of the Hortensian statute, we may well believe,\r\nthe tribunes had no means of forcing this permission. Some similar\r\nrestriction must have been placed on their liberty to bring finable\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nThe comitia tributa under tribunician presidency had at length become\r\nan effective constitutional factor in legislation and in jurisdiction.\r\nBut its action in the former sphere was dependent upon the favor of the\r\nsenate, in the latter on that of a patrician magistrate. The range, too,\r\nof its legislation was restricted by the wide administrative powers of\r\nthe senate. We shall find it in the following period winning freedom and\r\nenlarging the field of its activity.\r\n\r\n    The following literature is for the whole period from 449 to\r\n    287.\r\n\r\n    Schulze, C.

It is true that in 427 the centuries acquired the right\r\nto declare a war of aggression.[1695] Defensive wars in behalf either of\r\nRome or of an ally were regularly decided upon by the senate;[1696] and\r\nthe question whether the war was necessary for the safety of the state\r\nadmitted of a broad interpretation.[1697] From the beginning of the\r\nperiod to the year 321 treaties of peace and of alliance were still made\r\neither by a magistrate, with the authorization of the senate,[1698] or\r\nmore commonly by the senate itself, even though the alliance or offer of\r\nprotection was such as to render war with other states inevitable;[1699]\r\nand at the close of a conquest the senate disposed of the acquired\r\nterritory and population.[1700] Through its authority alone, till 332,\r\nthe censor bestowed the perfect or the limited citizenship.[1701]\r\n\r\nIn the affairs of peace it retained almost as absolute power of\r\nadministration as in the preceding period.[1702] We find it, accordingly,\r\nauthorizing a magistrate to vow games and the erection of a temple\r\nin the event of victory,[1703] providing for the restoration of\r\nthe city after the Gallic conflagration,[1704] for the building of\r\ntemples,[1705] introducing pay for military service,[1706] levying\r\nthe taxes,[1707] dividing the public lands among the citizens,[1708]\r\nfounding colonies,[1709] and recalling under penalty of death those\r\nwho without permission had gone out to colonize a captured city,[1710]\r\ndirecting the appropriate college to consult the Sibylline books,[1711]\r\nand ordering the aediles to take measures against the inroad of foreign\r\nsuperstitions,[1712] and the consuls to punish with rods and beheading\r\nthe instigators to revolt among the allies.[1713] It was in obedience to\r\na decree of the senate that the consul, or military tribune with consular\r\npower, suspended his own imperium and that of his colleague or colleagues\r\nby the appointment of a dictator,[1714] who had power to compel the\r\nresignation of all other magistrates.[1715] Or the senate could directly\r\norder the magistrates to retire from office, with or without a scruple\r\nas to the auspices.[1716] It rewarded successful commanders with\r\ntriumphs[1717] at the expense of the state[1718] and in time of especial\r\ndanger it armed the consuls with absolute imperium.[1719] In the face of\r\nan opposing force so vast as here indicated, the assemblies for a time\r\nmade slow headway. The development of their functions through the period\r\nbetween the Valerian-Horatian and the Hortensian legislation will now be\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Elective_\r\n\r\nAppreciating the great possibilities of the tribunate, the patricians\r\nattempted to fill the college with men of their own rank. If we are to\r\ntrust our authorities, an effort was made in that direction immediately\r\nafter the fall of the decemvirs, when it was agreed that the pontifex\r\nmaximus should preside over the tribal comitia for the election of the\r\nfirst tribunes of the plebs under the restored constitution.[1720] Among\r\nthe men chosen were some so closely attached to patrician interests\r\nthat at the end of the year they secured the election of successors who\r\ncoöpted into the college two patricians of consular rank.[1721] At this\r\ncrisis there was great danger that the college of tribunes might become\r\na possession of the patricians. It was averted, however, by a certain\r\ntribune, L. Trebonius, who succeeded in carrying a law that whoever\r\npresided over the comitia for the election of tribunes should continue\r\ntill ten tribunes were elected, the object being to preclude coöptation.\r\nThe tribune who violated this law was to be burned alive.[1722] That\r\npart of Livy’s account which assigns the author of the law to the\r\nyear 448 is improbable. A half century later (401) he informs us, it\r\nhappened that two places left vacant in the college were again filled\r\nby the coöptation of patricians and, by the strangest accident, a Cn.\r\nTrebonius was among their colleagues. His complaint that the Trebonian\r\nplebiscite and the leges sacratae were being violated had, in Livy’s\r\nopinion,[1723] no result. Probability greatly favors the later date for\r\nthe law, especially as an instance of coöptation is mentioned between\r\nthe two dates;[1724] the name of Trebonius or of one or more patricians\r\nin the college of 448[1725] was enough to lead the historian astray. The\r\nlater date fits well the political condition of the time; the patricians,\r\nalmost succeeding in monopolizing the military tribunate with consular\r\npower, proceeded to lay hands on the plebeian tribunate—a far more\r\nvaluable prize. After 401, however, the Trebonian law proved effective\r\nin excluding patricians from the tribunate of the plebs. Henceforth\r\nall plebeian officials were elected by the tribes under tribunician\r\npresidency.[1726]\r\n\r\nIn granting the tribal assembly a share in law-making the senate must\r\nhave hoped to convert it into an organ of the patrician government.\r\nShortly after the Valerian-Horatian legislation, accordingly, patrician\r\nmagistrates began to convoke this assembly for the election of quaestors\r\n(447)—previously appointed by the chief magistrates[1727]—and afterward\r\nof curule aediles (367),[1728] military tribunes,[1729] and other minor\r\nofficials.[1730]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Judicial_\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._ TRIBUNICIAN\r\n\r\nBy an arrangement referred to in the preceding chapter,[1731] partly\r\nbased on the law of the Twelve Tables relating to capital cases[1732] and\r\nfurther developed in 449, possibly by an article of the Valerian-Horatian\r\nstatute, a division of popular jurisdiction was made between the\r\ncenturiate and the tribal assemblies, on the basis of a distinction\r\nin the nature, not of the crime, but of the penalty.[1733] The tribes\r\npunished with fines, the centuries with the extreme penalty—banishment\r\nor death, to which was always added total confiscation of property.\r\nThe prosecutor, accordingly, first thought of the penalty, to which he\r\nthen attempted to adapt the form of action. The people were not guided\r\nto their decision by legal formalities and precedents,[1734] but were\r\noften swayed by the emotions of favor and anger.[1735] No juror’s oath\r\nwas imposed upon them to decide according to law and without personal\r\nor party bias, such as the Athenian heliasts swore. If the prosecutor,\r\nin addition to believing that the case merited the severest punishment,\r\nhoped to persuade the people to vote the death or banishment of the\r\naccused, he pronounced a capital condemnation, and the case was\r\naccordingly appealed to the centuriate assembly. If on the other hand he\r\ndoubted whether he would be able sufficiently to excite the anger of the\r\npopulace against the accused, however heinous the crime may have been in\r\nhis own opinion, he satisfied himself with a finable action, and allowed\r\nit to go before the tribes. Sometimes while the evidence was being taken\r\nin the latter form of action, the rage of the people was so inflamed\r\nagainst the accused that they clamored for the extreme penalty, in which\r\ncase the prosecutor might change the form of action agreeably to their\r\nwishes.[1736] The greater ease with which the tribes were summoned,\r\ntogether with the growing disinclination of the people to pronouncing\r\nthe death penalty, induced the magistrates more and more to make use of\r\nfinable rather than of capital actions. Fines were generally estimated\r\nin cattle and sheep till in 430 the consuls L. Julius and L. Papirius\r\nCrassus passed a centuriate law establishing a hundred pounds of copper\r\nas equivalent to an ox and ten to a sheep.[1737] Probably the same law\r\nprovided that no fine should exceed half the value of the estate on which\r\nit was levied.[1738]\r\n\r\nFor the period immediately following 449 the authorities—uncritically\r\nas will soon be made evident—assign to the tribunes of the plebs a\r\nformidable jurisdiction in finable actions, not only over private\r\npersons,[1739] but also, on account of official misconduct, over\r\nfunctionaries of every grade from ambassadors and tresviri coloniae\r\ndeducendae to consuls and dictators. Such prosecutions were usually\r\nbrought after the retirement of the accused from office. A chronological\r\nlist of the principal cases reported will be instructive.\r\n\r\nIn 442 the three commissioners for conducting a colony to Ardea were\r\nprosecuted by the tribunes on the ground that, by enrolling Ardeates\r\nin place of Romans in the list of colonists, they had circumvented the\r\nlaw which called their commission into being. The action would probably\r\nhave been finable; but the accused avoided trial by remaining in the\r\ncolony.[1740] In 423 M. Postumius and T. Quinctius, retired tribunes\r\nwith consular power, were tried for mismanagement of the war with Veii.\r\nThe former was fined 10,000 asses; the latter was exculpated by all the\r\ntribes.[1741] In 401 two other retired tribunes with consular power\r\nwere prosecuted by the tribunes of the plebs and fined each 10,000\r\nasses.[1742] The imposition of a fine on Camillus, 391, has already been\r\nconsidered.[1743] In 389 a tribune of the plebs brought an accusation\r\nagainst Q. Fabius on the ground that the latter while ambassador to\r\nthe Gauls had fought against them in violation of the law of nations.\r\nThe accused suddenly died, possibly by suicide, before the day of\r\ntrial.[1744] In 362 the dictator of the preceding year, L. Manlius, was\r\nprosecuted by a tribune because, though appointed for the sole purpose of\r\ndriving the nail, he had nevertheless made a levy of troops and that with\r\nextreme cruelty. But the prosecutor dropped the accusation, intimidated\r\nby the son of the accused.[1745] This is the view of Livy, whereas\r\nCicero[1746] states the ground of the charge to have been the addition\r\nof a few days to his dictatorship. If historical, the prosecution may\r\npossibly have been for perduellio, and in that case it would have come\r\nbefore the centuries.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are historically more certain. Lucius Postumius,\r\nprosecuted by the tribunes of the plebs in 293 for the misuse of his\r\nconsulship of the preceding year, escaped trial by becoming the legatus\r\nof the consul Carvilius. The charge was that in his campaign he had\r\nnot limited himself to the province assigned him by the senate.[1747]\r\nEvidently the intention of the prosecutor was not serious.[1748] The\r\nconsul Q. Fabius Gurges of the year 292, defeated in battle, was\r\nrecalled, and his conduct was impugned before the people. The past\r\nservices and the promises of his father saved him, and he continued his\r\nconsulship with greater success. The accusation probably did not take the\r\nform of a trial, but was presented in a resolution to remove him from\r\noffice[1749] or at least from the command of the army. L. Postumius,\r\nthird time consul in 291, employed his army to work on his own estate;\r\nand on the expiration of his office he was brought to trial therefor by\r\nthe tribunes and condemned.[1750]\r\n\r\nIn the period under discussion, 449-287, a single effort to hold the\r\nplebeian tribunes responsible for their official conduct is reported.\r\nIn 293 two retired tribunes were condemned to a fine of 10,000 asses\r\neach on a charge of having favored the patres by interceding against the\r\nproposals of colleagues.[1751] This instance, if historical, is the only\r\none of the kind before the revolution. The tribunes doubtless felt that\r\nthe prosecution of their predecessors rendered their own future unsafe.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts were also made by legislation to reach results\r\nequivalent to judicial sentences. In spite of the prohibition of\r\nprivilegia by a law of the Twelve Tables, Sp. Maelius, a tribune of\r\nthe plebs in 436, tried to carry a resolution for the confiscation of\r\nthe property of Servilius Ahala; but the people rejected it.[1752]\r\nAnother privilegium was the resolution of the plebs of 368 which\r\nthreatened M. Furius Camillus with a fine of 500,000 asses, should he\r\nuse his dictatorship to obstruct the Licinian-Sextian bills then under\r\ndiscussion.[1753] It was certainly not supported by a senatus consultum,\r\nand probably the proposers had no serious intention of carrying it into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the finable actions alleged to have been brought by the\r\nplebeian tribunes during the two centuries which intervened between the\r\ninstitution of their office and the Hortensian legislation, as in the\r\ncase of the capital actions,[1754] we are struck by the relatively small\r\nnumber belonging to the latter part of the period; in fact to the time\r\nfollowing 362 two cases only are assigned, one of which is insignificant.\r\nThe conclusion we must draw from this fact is similar to that expressed\r\nwith relation to the capital cases—that the finable actions attributed\r\nto the earlier period are in all probability largely unhistorical, and\r\nthat before the enactment of the Hortensian law the jurisdiction of the\r\ntribunes in finable cases was limited and rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._ AEDILICIAN\r\n\r\nFor some time after their institution the tribunes of the plebs,\r\nhaving no viatores or at least none that were recognized as public\r\nofficials,[1755] depended upon the two plebeian aediles as bailiffs\r\nfor making arrests and for executing sentences.[1756] The latter\r\nfunctionaries seem to have stood in some such relation to the tribunes\r\nas the quaestors toward the consuls. It was accordingly as deputies\r\nof the tribunes that they acquired jurisdiction.[1757] The earliest\r\nmentioned case, 454, is the trial and condemnation of a retired consul in\r\na finable action for official misconduct.[1758] It should be placed in\r\nthe same mythical category with the numerous tribunician prosecutions\r\nof the period.[1759] After the institution of curule aediles, 367, the\r\naediles of the plebs continued indeed to serve occasionally as bailiffs\r\nof the tribunes,[1760] but acquired in addition, along with those of\r\ncurule rank, an independent jurisdiction. In 357 C. Licinius Stolo was\r\nprosecuted by M. Popillius Laenas on the charge of having circumvented\r\nhis own law by emancipating his son in order that he and his son might\r\neach possess five hundred iugera of the public land. He was fined 10,000\r\nasses.[1761] From the cases to be mentioned below the inference may\r\nbe drawn that the accuser was an aedile. In 298 several persons were\r\nprosecuted by the aediles, whether curule or plebeian is not stated, for\r\nviolation of the same law, and hardly one was acquitted.[1762] In 295\r\nthe plebeian aediles made considerable money by fining those who had\r\ntrespassed against the article of the Licinian-Sextian statute which\r\nrelated to pasturage;[1763] and two years afterward violators of the same\r\nprovision were again fined, on this occasion by the curule aediles.[1764]\r\nActions against usurers were brought by aediles in 344,[1765] 304,[1766]\r\nand 295.[1767]\r\n\r\nShortly before 328, M. Flavius was prosecuted before the people by the\r\naediles for the crimen stupratae matris familiae, and acquitted.[1768]\r\nIn 295 Q. Fabius Gurges, a curule aedile,[1769] accused several matrons\r\nbefore the people, also of stuprum, and fined them.\r\n\r\nIn the period between the Licinian-Sextian and the Hortensian\r\nlegislation, accordingly, the jurisdiction of the aediles, so far as is\r\nknown, was limited to usury, stuprum, and the violation of laws regarding\r\nthe occupation and pasturage of the public land. They had nothing to\r\ndo with perduellio or related offences, or with the accountability of\r\nmagistrates, or with any capital actions whatsoever. All their trials\r\nwere finable, and in case the fine exceeded thirty cattle and two sheep,\r\nor the equivalent, 3020 heavy asses,[1770] an appeal could be made\r\nto the tribes. The plebeian aediles equally with the tribunes[1771]\r\nlacked the power to summon patricians, whereas the curule aediles as\r\npatrician magistrates[1772] possessed the right; but no distinction in\r\nthe composition of these tribal assemblies, corresponding to the form of\r\npresidency, is suggested by the sources.[1773]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Legislative_\r\n\r\nThe legislative function of the tribal assembly under tribunician\r\npresidency after the decemvirate (451-450)[1774] is represented as\r\nbringing forthwith into being the Icilian and Duillian plebiscites of\r\n449. That of Icilius granted amnesty to those who had seceded from the\r\ndecemvirs.[1775] The first plebiscite of Duillius provided for the\r\nelection of consuls cum provocatione.[1776] Both acts are alleged to have\r\nbeen passed, however, before the resolutions of the plebs had acquired\r\nthe force of law. The second Duillian plebiscite, which followed the\r\nenactment of the Valerian-Horatian statute, and which was therefore\r\nvalid for all the citizens, threatened with scourging and death any\r\none who left the plebs without tribunes or who caused the election\r\nof a magistrate without appeal.[1777] Its first provision was merely\r\nthe expression of a principle on which the plebeians, had from the\r\nbeginning insisted as essential to the continuance of the office from\r\nyear to year;[1778] the second clause precluded the recurrence of an\r\nelective magistracy like the decemvirate just past.[1779] According to\r\nDiodorus[1780] an agreement was made in this year between the patricians\r\nand plebeians by which one consul at least should be a plebeian. Although\r\nDiodorus generally drew from sources more ancient than those of Livy, he\r\nis wrong in assigning this provision to so early a date.[1781]\r\n\r\nFor the same year is recorded another Icilian plebiscite, which granted\r\nthe privilege of a triumph to the consuls after the senate had refused\r\nit.[1782] The alleged act is suspicious, in the first place, because the\r\ntwo consuls must have had the support of a majority in the senate, as the\r\nacceptance of their great constitutional statute proves. Then, too, a\r\nresolution of the people for granting the triumph could not avail in this\r\nperiod without the consent of the senate. The last observation applies as\r\nwell to the alleged refusal of the senate to ratify an act of the people\r\nin 356 for granting a triumph to the first plebeian dictator.[1783] Such\r\na resolution merely assured the triumphator that the people would be\r\npresent at the festival. Without the consent of the senate, they could\r\nnot appropriate the necessary funds for the occasion;[1784] but the\r\ngeneral always had a right to triumph, in earlier time within the city\r\nand later on the Alban Mount, at his own expense.[1785] If the senate\r\ndecreed the triumph, as remained the rule,[1786] ratification by the\r\npeople was unnecessary, though it sometimes occurred.[1787]\r\n\r\nThe Trebonian plebiscite, 448 or more probably 401, has already been\r\ndiscussed.[1788] The interest of the plebs in enhancing the dignity and\r\nimportance of their own order manifested itself not only in this act but\r\nalso in the Canuleian plebiscite of 445, which reëstablished conubium\r\nbetween the patricians and plebeians after it had been forbidden by a law\r\nof the Twelve Tables.[1789] Closely related is the centuriate law of the\r\nsame year for the institution of tribunes of the soldiers with consular\r\npower to be elected indiscriminately from the two social classes.[1790]\r\n\r\nSlightly earlier, if we may trust our sources, the people were given\r\nan unwonted opportunity to share in the decision of questions relating\r\nto foreign affairs; and the favor fell to the comitia tributa under\r\npatrician presidency, which had convened in this form for the first\r\ntime in 447 for the election of quaestors.[1791] The question before\r\nthis assembly in 446 was the arbitration of a dispute between Ardea and\r\nAricia concerning a piece of territory. The contestants brought the\r\ncase before the Roman senate, which usually decided such matters on its\r\nown responsibility, but which in this instance requested the consuls to\r\nrefer the business to the tribes. The aim of the senate must have been\r\nto throw the odium of the decision upon the people, who, disregarding\r\nthe claims of the two contestants, lost little time in adjudging the\r\ndisputed property to Rome.[1792] This act did not serve as a precedent\r\nfor further interference of the assembly in foreign affairs; and when in\r\n427 the people acquired the right to declare an offensive war,[1793] the\r\nfunction fell to the centuries rather than to the tribes. Apart from this\r\ngain the comitia made little progress[1794] in the period between the\r\nCanuleian and the Licinian-Sextian legislation, 445-367. Few legislative\r\nacts of the tribes are recorded: the plebiscite which provided in a\r\ntime of famine for the election of a prefect of the market, 440;[1795]\r\nthe historically questionable plebiscite which forbade candidates for\r\noffice to whiten their garments, 432;[1796] the plebiscite of 414 for\r\nthe creation of a special court to try a case of murder;[1797] the\r\nact, probably a plebiscite, which forbade a patrician to dwell on the\r\nCapitoline, 384.[1798]\r\n\r\nDoubtless in this period there was much agrarian agitation on the part of\r\nthe tribunes, although we cannot be sure that any of the bills mentioned\r\nby Livy[1799] are historical. In like manner the leaders of the plebs, as\r\ncandidates for the consular tribunate, are represented as agitating for\r\nthe institution of pay for military service, the money to be derived from\r\nrents of public lands.[1800] When the reform came, however, it was by a\r\nvoluntary concession of the senate extremely annoying to the tribunes,\r\nwho found themselves thus deprived of a useful ground for complaint,\r\n406.[1801] Epoch-making were the Licinian-Sextian laws, the first, 368,\r\nincreasing the duoviri sacris faciundis to decemviri and providing that\r\nfive should be plebeian,[1802] the second, 367, containing in Livy’s\r\nopinion four articles: (1) that one consul must be plebeian,[1803] (2)\r\nthat the interest already paid on debts should be deducted from the\r\nprincipal and the balance rendered in three equal annual instalments, (3)\r\nthat no one should occupy more than five hundred iugera of the public\r\nland,[1804] (4) that the right to pasture cattle and sheep on the public\r\nland should also be limited.[1805]\r\n\r\nThereafter we find the tribal assembly more active in legislation. To\r\nthe year 358 is assigned the first well-authenticated lex de ambitu,\r\nthe Poetelian plebiscite, which forbade candidates for office to\r\nvisit markets and meeting-places outside the city for electioneering\r\npurposes.[1806] The motive, however, which Livy attributes to the\r\nauthor—to prevent the further enlargement of the patricio-plebeian\r\nnobility through the admission of new men—was hardly possible at this\r\nearly date.\r\n\r\nIn 357 tribal comitia under patrician chairmanship passed a law\r\nfor placing a tax of five per cent on manumissions of slaves. The\r\ncircumstances attending this meeting were peculiar; the consul Cn.\r\nManlius summoned to it the soldiers of his army in the camp at\r\nSutrium.[1807] It must have been composed, therefore, of a small minority\r\nof the citizens, lacking not only those who were too old for service, but\r\ndoubtless a majority of the men of military age. Difficulties regarding\r\nthe auspices, too, and other formalities might have arisen; and yet\r\nin spite of the fact that the enactment of the law was an intrusion\r\nwithin the administrative domain of the senate, the patres gave their\r\nsanction;[1808] and the legality of the measure was never called in\r\nquestion.[1809] In contrast with the general prevalence of free labor\r\nin early Rome, the number of slaves since the conquest of Veii had\r\nbecome considerable; and wealthy individuals were evidently beginning\r\nthe practice of building up a political following through the clientage\r\nof their freedmen, to the disadvantage of the older plebs. The majority\r\nof the patricians must have been in sympathy with the effort of their\r\nconsul to check this new development, although they could not approve\r\nthe peculiar means by which the law was passed. Nor could the tribunes\r\nof the plebs allow legislation to be thus removed beyond the sphere of\r\ntheir control. The repetition of the procedure was immediately forbidden\r\naccordingly by a plebiscite which threatened with the death penalty\r\nany magistrate who held comitia away from the city.[1810] In the same\r\nyear the people took a further step in the administration of finance by\r\nenacting the Duillian-Menenian plebiscite for establishing the rate of\r\ninterest at ten per cent[1811]—thereby confirming a law of the Twelve\r\nTables[1812]—and five years later the consular law of P. Valerius\r\nPublicola and C. Marcius Rutilus for the institution of a bank under\r\nthe direction of five commissioners to assist debtors in meeting their\r\nobligations (352).[1813] The latter was followed in 347 by a plebiscite\r\nwhich reduced the maximal rate of interest to five per cent and provided\r\nfor the payment of the principal in four equal annual instalments.[1814]\r\n\r\nThis activity of the people in financial legislation is to be explained\r\nby the economic distress which lasted many years, and which the measures\r\nthus far mentioned failed to remedy. There can be no doubt that the\r\ngeneral indebtedness and the resultant discontent of the masses, assigned\r\nby the annalists to the earliest years of the republic, belong in\r\nreality to the period now under consideration. The murmurings of the\r\ndebtors culminated in 342 in a military mutiny, with which the masses of\r\ncitizens seem to have been in full sympathy. The demands of the soldiers\r\nand civilians were met (1) by a law of the dictator Valerius, which,\r\nremedying other grievances of the soldiers, is said to have proclaimed an\r\nabolition of debts,[1815] (2) by the plebiscite of L. Genucius, tribune\r\nof the same year. The provisions of the latter were as follows: (1) it\r\nforbade the lending of money on interest; (2) it ordered that no one\r\nshould fill the same office within a period of ten years, or two offices\r\nat the same time;(3) it allowed both consuls to be plebeian.[1816]\r\nAlthough Livy, failing to find the Genucian law in all his sources,\r\nhesitates to accept it as historical, there seems to be no cogent\r\nground for disbelieving that such a statute was actually passed.[1817]\r\nThe legal rate of interest had recently been lowered one-half; and the\r\nplebeians, not satisfied with the temporary relief afforded by the\r\ncancellation of debts, hoped for all time to free themselves from an\r\nintolerable affliction by one sweeping legislative act. This article of\r\nthe plebiscite, however, probably remained from the beginning a dead\r\nletter. The second continued unenforced for many years,[1818] whereas the\r\nprovision regarding two consuls had to wait more than a century for its\r\nfirst practical application.[1819] The patricians had often violated the\r\nLicinian-Sextian statute by placing two of their number together in the\r\nconsulship. Perhaps the third article of the Genucian law was intended\r\nto make them respect the earlier statute by a threat to exclude them\r\nentirely from this office. If this was the object of Genucius, his means\r\ncertainly proved effective.[1820]\r\n\r\nThree years later the dictator Publilius Philo passed through the\r\ncenturiate assembly the statute (1) that plebi scita should be binding\r\non all the quirites; (2) that before the voting began the patres\r\nshould give their auctoritas to proposals brought before the comitia\r\ncenturiata; (3) that one censor at least should be plebeian (339).[1821]\r\nAll three articles were alike aimed against the political dominance\r\nof the patricians. The second freed centuriate legislation from their\r\ncontrol;[1822] the third[1823] assured to the plebeians a just share in\r\nthe function of determining the composition of the tribes, hence of the\r\ncivil and political status of every Roman. It was not long afterward that\r\nthe censors were to be given in addition the function of revising the\r\nlist of senators.[1824]\r\n\r\nThe first article has substantially the same form as the corresponding\r\nprovision of the Valerian-Horatian statute, 449, and of the Hortensian,\r\n287.[1825] All manner of conjectures as to the relation of these\r\nthree laws to one another has been offered, the readiest theory\r\nbeing that the Valerian-Horatian statute had become obsolete, and\r\nrequired reënactment.[1826] The explanation is proved impossible\r\nby the circumstance that important plebi scita were passed under\r\nthe Valerian-Horatian provision, the last being the Genucian. The\r\nValerian-Horatian law could not have become obsolete in three years.\r\nThe true explanation is to be found in the fact, now well known to\r\nhistorians, that the political ideas and political struggles assigned by\r\nour sources to the fifth century B.C. belong mostly to the fourth. The\r\nsetting of the law of Publilius Volero, 471, was inaccurately transferred\r\nto it from the law of Publilius Philo, 339. The very existence of the\r\nlatter statute is proof that the patricians were at that time declaring\r\nplebi scita invalid on the ground that they were passed by only a part\r\nof the people—a complaint recorded against neither the Canuleian nor the\r\nLicinian plebiscite. Hence, as the sources indicate, the patricians were\r\nin the assembly which passed these two measures. We may legitimately\r\napply to the period from 449 to 339 the story of the long but finally\r\nsuccessful struggle on the part of the tribunes to expel the patricians\r\nfrom the comitia tributa under plebeian chairmanship—a story which the\r\nsources assign to the period ending in 367. The struggle must be accepted\r\nas historical, for there was in later time no motive for creating it;\r\nand as it must have been a matter of tradition rather than of record,\r\nit could not well be placed earlier than the fourth century B.C. We may\r\nsuppose that the patricians yielded the more readily because they at\r\nlast recognized their inability simply by their votes to control the\r\ntribunician assembly, and because from the beginning they disliked to\r\nsubmit to the authority of a plebeian president. Hence their withdrawal\r\nfrom that form of comitia was in the first instance voluntary. The\r\nassembly, therefore, which adopted the Genucian plebiscite was de facto,\r\nthough not de jure, exclusively plebeian. When accordingly the patricians\r\nobjected to its validity on the ground that it was passed by but a part\r\nof the people, Publilius Philo, the most eminent plebeian statesman of\r\nhis age, carried through the centuriate assembly the law above mentioned,\r\nthat the resolutions of the tribunician assembly as then constituted,\r\nof plebs only, should be valid for all the people. This interpretation\r\nthrows light on the otherwise inexplicable circumstance that the Genucian\r\nplebiscite was so indifferently enforced. The exclusion of the patricians\r\nwas in line, too, with the general policy followed by the plebeians\r\nagainst them in the fourth century: the plebeians shut the patricians\r\nout (1) from the plebeian tribunate, probably 401. (2) from five places\r\nin the college of decemviri sacris faciundis, 368, and from one of the\r\nconsular places, 367. (3) by agreement from the two curule aedileships on\r\nalternate years, (4) from one of the censorial places, 339. (5) from a\r\nfixed number of places in the college of augurs and of pontiffs, 300. It\r\nwas in accord with this tendency to convert the earlier privileges of the\r\npatricians into disabilities that a vote of the people excluded them from\r\nthose comitia tributa which were presided over by tribunes. This state\r\nof affairs was formulated in the antiquarian and juristic definitions of\r\npopulus and plebs, lex and plebi scitum. The condition, however, seems to\r\nhave been only transient. The dwindling of the patriciate in numbers and\r\nstrength, with the corresponding growth of a plebeian nobility, which\r\nconverted the tribunate and assembly of plebs into most potent organs of\r\nthe senatorial government, obliterated distinctions between patricians\r\nand plebeians within the political assemblies, to such a degree that\r\nfor the period after the Hortensian legislation no reference to an\r\nexclusively plebeian assembly is made by any ancient author. Although\r\nthis article of the Publilian statute was never formally repealed, we may\r\nfeel certain that the principle involved was no longer remembered in the\r\nage of Cicero.[1827]\r\n\r\nThe Publilian statute of 339 is not known to have provided for an\r\nextension of the field of competence of the tribal assembly; yet we find\r\nthe comitia tributa soon afterward attending to business heretofore\r\nmanaged by the senate or in one or two instances by the centuries.\r\nAlthough about a hundred years earlier the centuriate comitia had\r\nacquired the right to ratify or reject declarations of offensive\r\nwar,[1828] we find no record of a ratification of a treaty of peace\r\nby the people before the year 321, in which occurred the disaster\r\nat Caudium; and in this case it was not only the common opinion in\r\nLivy’s time, but also the understanding of Claudius, the historian,\r\nthat the treaty made by the consuls, without the sanction of the\r\nsenate or the people, was regular and valid[1829]—a “foedus summae\r\nreligionis,” as Cicero declares.[1830] Even Livy, who aims to prove the\r\nprocedure defective, admits that the tribunes of the plebs[1831] and\r\nPostumius,[1832] one of the consuls who made it, looked upon it as\r\nlegitimate. But according to Livy[1833] the senate itself declared the\r\ntreaty invalid on the ground that it lacked popular confirmation;[1834]\r\nand in that body the principle was then enunciated that nothing which\r\nwas to bind the people could be sanctioned without their order[1835]—the\r\nfirst recorded expression of the doctrine of popular sovereignty among\r\nthe Romans. In this period, however, the people were never called\r\nupon to ratify the acceptance of a submission or of an alliance on\r\nunequal terms. Such agreements granting Rome the superior right were\r\nnegotiated, as in earlier time, by the magistrate or senate or by both\r\nin conjunction.[1836] The details, too, of every treaty were still left\r\nto the magistrates and senate, so that to the end of the republic the\r\nsenatus consultum continued to be indispensable.[1837] But from the time\r\nof the Caudine misfortune, and in consequence of it, the principle was\r\nestablished that a treaty involving a concession of even equal rights\r\non the part of Rome required the sanction of a popular vote. Recorded\r\ninstances of such ratification for this period (321-287) are rare.[1838]\r\nThe function fell to the comitia tributa under patrician or plebeian\r\npresidency, which in its exercise showed more independence[1839] than did\r\nthe comitia centuriata in the declaration of wars. In this way the tribal\r\nassembly took its place by the side of the centuriate in international\r\naffairs.[1840]\r\n\r\nThe absolute power to bestow the citizenship exercised by the kings[1841]\r\nwould naturally pass undiminished to the consuls, and thence to the\r\ncensors on the institution of the latter. It is in fact the opinion of\r\nLange[1842] that these magistrates respectively exercised full rights in\r\nthe matter, and that they consulted the senate in important cases only.\r\nAt all events the question is simply as to the relative participation of\r\nthe magistrates and the senate in the function. The final settlement of\r\nLatium after the war, involving the bestowal of citizenship, 338, the\r\nsenate seems to have attended to alone through a consultum, no mention\r\nbeing made of the people.[1843] In the whole course of Roman history to\r\n332 there is no record of a grant of citizenship by popular vote.[1844]\r\nAs the Acerrani were left out of account by the senatus consultum above\r\nmentioned, L. Papirius in 332 through the first recorded pretorian law\r\ngranted them the civitas sine suffragio.[1845] In opinion of Lange,[1846]\r\nbased upon a statement of Velleius,[1847] the censors of the year, Q.\r\nPublilius Philo and Sp. Postumius, while enrolling the new citizens,\r\nprobably obtained a senatus consultum requesting the praetor to bring\r\nthis subject before the tribes. That a senatorial decree was essential\r\nis proved by the case of the Privernates mentioned below. We may well\r\nbelieve that the great plebeian statesman Publilius gladly embraced\r\nthe opportunity to make the tribal assembly a partner in the important\r\nfunction of imparting the rights of the city. Three years afterward an\r\norder of the people, doubtless of the tribes, ex auctoritate patrum,\r\ngranted the citizenship to the Privernates, 329.[1848] By what authority\r\nthe Hernicans received the civitas sine suffragio in 306 is not\r\nstated.[1849] Long after the Hortensian legislation the principle was\r\nestablished that the people alone without the authorization of the senate\r\nhad a right to bestow the ius suffragii on whomsoever they pleased.[1850]\r\nLogically the function should have fallen to the comitia centuriata as\r\nthe source of censorial power; but the tribal assembly assumed it because\r\nof its connection with the making of treaties.[1851]\r\n\r\nIt was the province of the centuriate assembly to introduce permanent\r\nregulations of existing magistracies and to institute new ones;[1852]\r\nbut the function was now transferred, silently so far as we know, to the\r\ntribes. Far-reaching in its effect was the creation of the promagistracy\r\nin 327. No prolongation of an official power is known to have occurred\r\nbefore this date. The extension of the territory of Rome and of her\r\nmilitary operations was now calling for greater elasticity in the\r\nduration of commands; but in the face of a strong movement toward popular\r\nrights the senate dared not assume the responsibility of so sweeping an\r\ninnovation. It placed in the hands of the tribunes, accordingly, the\r\nbusiness of bringing before the people a rogation for prolonging the\r\nimperium of the consul Q. Publilius Philo to the end of the war with\r\nNaples, instituting by this precedent the promagistracy.[1853] Again\r\nin 295 the imperium of the consul Volumnius was prolonged for a year\r\nby a decree of the senate ratified by a plebiscite.[1854] After the\r\ncustom had been established, however, the senate ordinarily attended\r\nto the prolonging of the imperium, as in 308,[1855] in 296,[1856] and\r\nin 294,[1857] consulting the people, as it seems, only in cases of\r\ntribunician opposition.[1858] No instance of popular interference in\r\nthe assignment of provinces is mentioned before 295, when a resolution\r\nof the comitia tributa, under what form of presidency is not stated,\r\ngranted Etruria to the patrician Fabius in preference to the plebeian\r\nDecius.[1859] This act was an inroad upon the right of the magistrates\r\nto divide the business of their office among themselves by agreement or\r\nlot. In 292 another resolution of the people recalled from the field the\r\nconsul Q. Fabius Gurges because of ill-success in war with the Samnites.\r\nThe senate was the prime mover in the matter, but the form of assembly is\r\nunknown. The question concerned either the abrogation of his magistracy\r\nor more probably his transfer to some other activity.[1860] Even in the\r\nlatter case the act of the people was a remarkable deviation from their\r\nusual modest policy of dealing with officials.\r\n\r\nIn 318 a law, doubtless tribal, was passed for sending praefecti\r\niure dicundo to Capua;[1861] and similar laws were from time to time\r\nenacted for assigning the same kind of officials to other communities\r\nof Italy.[1862] These prefects continued to be appointed by the urban\r\npraetor till after 124.[1863] Whether the law of 318 was pretorian or\r\ntribunician cannot be determined.[1864] Similar in character was the\r\nAtilian-Marcian plebiscite for the election of sixteen military tribunes\r\ninstead of six, 311.[1865] The substitution of election for appointment\r\nwas in effect the institution of a magistracy—in this case merely an\r\nincrease in number within a magisterial college which had existed since\r\n362. In the act of 311 the tribes usurped a function which had hitherto\r\nbelonged to the centuries.[1866] Although the elective military tribunes\r\nremained subordinate to the consuls, the change increased their dignity\r\nand in some degree their independence, while it tended to impair the\r\nefficiency of the service. Naturally the office became a stepping-stone\r\nto political honors. The Decian plebiscite of the same year instituted\r\nthe duumviri navales charged with the function of repairing, equipping,\r\nand commanding the fleet.[1867] The two plebiscites of this year have\r\nthe appearance of a compromise between continental and commercial\r\ninterests under the influence of Appius Claudius Caecus the censor.\r\nClosely related is the article of the Ogulnian plebiscite, 300, which\r\nprovided for an increase in the number of augurs and pontiffs.[1868]\r\nHere, too, belongs the plebiscite of 296 for the appointment of\r\ncommissioners for conducting colonies.[1869] Henceforth it was the custom\r\nof the senate to refer to the people the creation of all extraordinary\r\noffices, and their election to the comitia tributa usually under\r\npretorian presidency.[1870]\r\n\r\nThe people made a further advance when they undertook to regulate by law\r\nthe composition of the senate itself. To the period between the Publilian\r\nlegislation of 339 and the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus, 312,\r\nbelongs the famous Ovinian plebiscite concerning the revision of the\r\nsenate list.[1871] It transferred the function from the consuls to the\r\ncensors, and required the latter under oath (iurati; MS. curiati) to\r\nenroll all who were worthy among the retired magistrates of every rank,\r\nfrom the curule functionaries down through those of plebeian standing to\r\nthe quaestors.[1872]\r\n\r\nThe Valerian-Horatian and Publilian statutes are evidence of the right\r\nof the people to legislate regarding the composition and powers of\r\ntheir assemblies. No longer content, however, with the making and\r\nrepeal of laws,—a right guaranteed by the Twelve Tables,[1873]—they\r\nbegan the practice of occasionally suspending laws to the advantage or\r\ndisadvantage of individuals or of classes—in other words, the voting\r\nof privilegia.[1874] There were repeated violations of that article of\r\nthe Genucian plebiscite which forbade reëlection to an office within a\r\nperiod of ten years,[1875] and no mention is made of the necessity of a\r\ndispensation before the year 298, when Q. Fabius Maximus is alleged to\r\nhave objected to further reëlection on the ground that such conduct was\r\nforbidden by law. Thereupon the tribunes of the plebs declared that to\r\nremove the obstacle they would propose to the people that he should be\r\nabsolved from the legal requirement.[1876] But in fact, as Lange[1877]\r\nhas noticed, Fabius had not been consul for ten years and was therefore\r\nlegally eligible. Lange suggests that this story of the dispensation\r\nmay belong to his next election in 295.[1878] At all events the custom\r\nof granting dispensations began about this time,[1879] although we need\r\nnot suppose that the patricians attached much importance to the Genucian\r\nstatute, which was adopted by an exclusively plebeian assembly. This\r\nfunction assumed by the people of freeing from the power of the law,\r\noften exercised in historical time by the senate as well, marks a great\r\nadvance toward popular sovereignty. The idea that the law was sovereign,\r\nwhich had arisen in the early republic, was now yielding to the idea\r\nthat it was subject to the caprice of every popular gathering.[1880] The\r\naristocracy was giving way to a democracy, which under the conditions\r\ndestined to prevail at Rome could only mean mob-rule.\r\n\r\nThe right of the people in their tribal assemblies to legislate\r\nconcerning religion had already been established by the precedent of\r\nthe Licinian-Sextian plebiscite on the decemviri sacris faciundis[1881]\r\nand of other less important acts.[1882] Immediately after the Publilian\r\nlegislation the comitia of tribes became more active in this field.\r\nTo the period of the great Latin war according to Cicero,[1883] hence\r\nnecessarily to 338,[1884] belongs the consular lex Maenia, which added\r\nto the Ludi Romani the day called instauraticius,[1885] although less\r\ntrustworthy accounts assign the establishment of this day to 491.[1886]\r\nThe law initiated by the senate in 304 forbidding the dedication of a\r\ntemple or altar except by permission of the senate or of a majority of\r\nthe college of tribunes[1887] was probably passed by the comitia tributa\r\nplebis. In the opinion of Lange[1888] it was either identical with, or\r\nafterward supplemented by, the lex Papiria tribunicia, which forbade the\r\nconsecration of a temple, precinct, or altar without an order of the\r\nplebs.[1889] The latter is the more probable; it seems reasonable that,\r\nas Lange suggests, the right of the people in this matter developed from\r\nthe necessity of referring to them cases in which the senate and the\r\ntribunes could not agree. Technically religious, though of vast political\r\nconsequence, was the Ogulnian plebiscite of 300, which increased the\r\nnumber of augurs and pontiffs to nine each, and provided that four augurs\r\nand five pontiffs should be plebeian.[1890] It was the last step in the\r\nopening of offices to the plebs.\r\n\r\nIn their effort to gain control of the more important judicial business\r\nthe people made slower progress. In all probability it was not till after\r\nthe Publilian legislation that the centuriate and tribal assemblies\r\nbegan regularly to exercise the function of appellate courts—a right\r\nestablished long before by legislation[1891] and confirmed for the\r\ncenturies by the Valerian law of appeal in 300.[1892] The creation\r\nof special judicial commissions—quaestiones extraordinariae—belonged\r\noriginally to the senate; and the establishment of such a court de caede\r\nthrough a plebiscite in 414, if historical, was merely the execution\r\nof a senatus consultum.[1893] The task of trying and condemning the\r\nmatrons for poisoning in 331 must have fallen to such a quaestio\r\nextraordinaria not expressly mentioned. Whether it was instituted by the\r\nsenate or the tribes cannot be known.[1894] The special quaestio, too,\r\nconcerning conspiracy, at first under dictatorial and afterward under\r\nconsular presidency, seems to have been instituted solely by a senatus\r\nconsultum.[1895] The Flavian rogation of 323 for punishing the Tusculans\r\nfor having given aid and encouragement to the enemies of Rome[1896] may\r\nhave aimed to create a special court for the purpose, or it may have been\r\nan attempt to dispense justice by means of legislation.[1897] However\r\nthat may be, it was rejected by all the tribes but one. The Satricans,\r\nwho revolted to the Samnites after the Caudine disaster and were\r\nconquered in 319, were punished by the senate acting as a special court\r\non the authority of the Antistian plebiscite.[1898]\r\n\r\nThe right of the people both in the centuries and in the tribes to\r\nlegislate on finance had before 339 been well established by precedent.\r\nEconomic as well as social in character was the lex Poetelia, which\r\nprohibited loans on the security of the person,[1899] and which was\r\nproposed to the tribes, or possibly to the centuries, by C. Poetelius\r\nLibo as consul in 326 or as dictator in 313.[1900] It abolished\r\ncontractual but not judicial servitude, though it probably mitigated the\r\nlatter.[1901] Politically more significant than this individual act was\r\nthe long-continued popular effort to gain control of the disposal of the\r\npublic land. It was to the detriment of the senatorial prerogative that\r\nthe tribunes of the plebs took up the agrarian question from the time\r\nof Sp. Cassius,[1902] and continued almost unceasingly to agitate for\r\nthe limitation of the use of public land by the rich and the division of\r\nthe surplus among the poor, till they succeeded in embodying their ideas\r\nin the Licinian-Sextian law on these subjects. Equally to the province\r\nof the senate belonged the planting of colonies[1903] both from the\r\nmilitary and from the financial point of view. Here, too, the tribunes in\r\nthe economic interest of their constituents began early to agitate for\r\na share in the administration.[1904] It was not till 296 that they met\r\nwith any success in this direction, and then at the will of the senate,\r\nwhich charged the tribunes with the business of introducing a plebiscite\r\nfor ordering the praetor to appoint triumviri for conducting colonies to\r\ncertain specified places.[1905] This was the modest outcome of centuries\r\nof agrarian and colonial agitation on the part of the tribunes.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that after the enactment of the Genucian and Publilian laws\r\nthe plebeians continued for about a generation relatively content with\r\ntheir economic condition. Frequent victories brought booty,[1906] and\r\nconquests made extensive assignments of land possible.[1907] But the\r\npeople must have found the third Samnite war oppressive. Although of\r\nfar shorter duration than the second, it required larger armies and\r\nlonger and more distant campaigns. Under the burden of military service\r\nthe plebs again fell into debt, in spite of the unusual distributions\r\nof booty among the soldiers when victorious.[1908] Their burden was\r\nrendered the heavier by the circumstance that many of the wealthy were\r\nviolating the Licinian-Sextian restrictions on the use of public land\r\nand pasture, and were doubtless failing to pay their dues[1909]—a course\r\nof conduct which rendered necessary not only the assignment of the spoil\r\nof 293 to the aerarium but also the imposition of a tributum especially\r\nvexatious to the plebs.[1910] The distress was augmented by a pestilence\r\nwhich began in 295 and continued for several years.[1911] Whereas all\r\non actual service were by law exempt from prosecution for debt, many\r\ncitizens who remained at home were the victims of the usurers, who were\r\noccasionally fined for their illegal exactions.[1912] Again all the\r\ncommons incurred hopeless debts, which at the close of the war (290) the\r\ncreditors must have proceeded to exact with their usual ruthlessness.\r\nThe institution of the tresviri capitales in the following year[1913] is\r\nproof of the intention of the government to enforce the criminal law with\r\nthe utmost rigor. A new movement for the relief of debtors had already\r\nset in, and the creditors were organizing resistance to the popular\r\ndemands. As long as the nobility could rely upon the tribunate of the\r\nplebs,[1914] they felt secure. Even if a bill for the benefit of the poor\r\nshould be presented, they believed their interests to be well fortified\r\nby tribunician intercession and by the senate, which, composed chiefly\r\nof creditors, would certainly refuse its sanction to such a measure. The\r\ngrave economic distress, however, at length filled the tribunate with\r\nmen who were at one in demanding a radical measure of relief, and who\r\naccordingly presented a bill for the abolition of debts. Many times they\r\noffered it to the tribes in vain; the senate refused its assent; for\r\nthe creditors, among whom must be counted a majority of the senators,\r\nhoped to recover both principal and interest. Willing to compromise, the\r\ntribunes then offered the senate, if it should yield, a choice of two\r\nalternatives, neither of which can be deduced with certainty from the\r\nmutilated fragment of Dio Cassius, our authority for this event. One of\r\nthem, however, is conjectured to be that the principal alone should be\r\nrecovered,[1915] in what way cannot be made out; and the other that the\r\ninterest already paid should be deducted from the principal, and the\r\nbalance rendered in three equal annual instalments—a repetition of the\r\nLicinian-Sextian provision regarding debts. At first the debtors were\r\nwilling to grant this concession through fear of failing to obtain any\r\ndegree of relief; but the creditors, now hoping to recover everything,\r\nrefused to be conciliated. After a time both parties shifted their\r\nattitude; the creditors expressed themselves as satisfied to recover\r\nthe principal merely, while the debtors would no longer accept either\r\nalternative of the compromise. The sedition, for such the conflict\r\nbecame, continued interminably; and although the creditors yielded,\r\nlittle by little, far more than they had intended in the beginning, the\r\ndebtors made each concession the basis of a new demand. They brought\r\nthe long, serious struggle to a climax by seceding to the Janiculum, at\r\nthe very time when the Tarentines were completing the organization of\r\na coalition of Etruscans, Gauls, Samnites, and several other peoples\r\nagainst Rome.[1916] Q. Hortensius, appointed dictator to meet this\r\ncrisis, carried through the comitia centuriata a group of provisions for\r\nsatisfying the demands of the seceders:\r\n\r\n    (1) Doubtless a clause for the relief of debtors, of which no\r\n    mention is made in our scant sources.\r\n\r\n    (2) A provision that without the consent either of the senate\r\n    or of the patrician portion of it a resolution of the plebs\r\n    should be valid for all the citizens.[1917]\r\n\r\n    At the time when the Valerian-Horatian statute provided that\r\n    with the consent of the senate resolutions of the tribunician\r\n    comitia tributa should have the force of law, the senate was\r\n    still composed exclusively of patricians; and the phrase\r\n    senatus consultum in this law was therefore considered a full\r\n    equivalent of the patrum auctoritas, the only difference being\r\n    that the consultum was given in advance of a popular vote and\r\n    the auctoritas subsequently to it. But when with the appearance\r\n    of plebeians in the senate the two acts began to drift more\r\n    widely apart, the patricians successfully claimed an exclusive\r\n    right to the auctoritas, which, as we have seen,[1918] was\r\n    reduced to a formality, so far as centuriate legislation was\r\n    concerned, by an article of the Publilian law. So long as the\r\n    patricians voted in the tribunician comitia tributa, however,\r\n    and constituted a majority in the senate, they were willing\r\n    to abide by the specific declaration of the Valerian-Horatian\r\n    statute which conditioned the validity of the plebiscite on the\r\n    senatus consultum. But from 339 they were legally excluded from\r\n    the tribunician comitia tributa, and they foresaw, moreover,\r\n    the end of their majority in the senate. In the period between\r\n    339 and 287, accordingly, they set up a new claim, based\r\n    doubtless on the practical intention of the Valerian-Horatian\r\n    law, to be free from plebi scita because the latter were passed\r\n    without their auctoritas.[1919] If they could make good their\r\n    intention, they would remain unaffected by tribunician laws\r\n    for the abolition of debt. But the Hortensian statute settled\r\n    finally the controversy to their disadvantage. That it also\r\n    rendered the consultum unessential to the validity of the\r\n    plebiscite is proved not only by later usage but also by the\r\n    statement of our sources that resolutions of the plebs were\r\n    placed by the Hortensian act on an equal footing with laws.\r\n\r\n    (3) Now that the tribunes were given equal freedom with the\r\n    patrician higher magistrates in initiating legislation, it\r\n    was of advantage to the nobility to bring the former into the\r\n    closest possible touch with the senate. Probably therefore\r\n    the right of the tribunes not only to sit in the senate, but\r\n    also in the interest of their business to summon that body and\r\n    to preside over its sessions when so convoked, was due to a\r\n    provision of the Hortensian law.[1920]\r\n\r\n    (4) A correlate of the full power to initiate legislation was\r\n    the right to veto acts of the government, probably acquired by\r\n    the Hortensian statute.\r\n\r\n    (5) But the veto depended upon the power to prosecute.[1921]\r\n    The unlimited veto implied a right to bring finable or capital\r\n    actions independently of the will of the patrician magistrates.\r\n    Either by a provision of the Hortensian statute or as a direct\r\n    consequence of it, the tribunes acquired an unconditioned right\r\n    to prosecute, being now competent in capital cases to compel\r\n    the praetor to grant the auspices for holding the comitia\r\n    centuriata. With the establishment of their absolute power of\r\n    intercession and jurisdiction they ceased to resort to sedition.\r\n\r\n    (6) Another article provided that the market-days should be\r\n    fasti, allowing judicial business to be done thereon, but\r\n    forbade the meeting of voting assemblies on such days.[1922]\r\n    The peasants who came into the city to use the markets were\r\n    thus afforded an opportunity to have their law suits settled\r\n    without being engrossed by the duty of voting, though the\r\n    magistrates were at liberty to invite them to informal\r\n    contiones.[1923] This Hortensian provision was conservative in\r\n    so far as it placed the tribunician assembly under the same\r\n    pontifical regulations of the calendar as those which were to\r\n    control the other forms of comitia.[1924]\r\n\r\nThe right of the people to elect their magistrates, with the exception\r\nof the dictator and the master of horse, existed from the beginning of\r\nthe republic. Their right also to create new offices began with the\r\ninstitution of the consulship, and was frequently exercised during\r\nthe period treated in this chapter. In the age which begins with the\r\nValerian-Horatian legislation we find the people regulating by law the\r\nqualifications and conduct of candidates as well as the powers and\r\nfunctions of the magistrates themselves. They had the same right to deal\r\nwith the organization and competence of the assemblies. From 358 to\r\n287 they rapidly extended their legislative power, by precedent rather\r\nthan by statute, over the whole field of the constitution and over the\r\nadministration in all its departments; they ventured even to regulate the\r\nsenate and to interfere with the imperium. Controlled originally by the\r\nsenate, in the end they won their freedom from that body, whereas the\r\ninitiative in every act always remained with the presiding magistrate.\r\nMeantime they had acquired supreme judicial power. In constitutional\r\ntheory they were at last sovereign. The senate and the magistrates, so\r\nthis theory asserted, still retained large administrative powers for the\r\nsole reason that the assemblies, unable to manage the current details\r\nof public business, were content with occasional participation and\r\nregulation. Most of these gains had been made by the tribes under the\r\npresidency of tribunes or of patrician magistrates, usually praetors.\r\nIn legislation the comitia tributa had rendered the centuriate assembly\r\ndispensable excepting in declarations of offensive war and in the\r\nconfirmation of censorial elections. The question whether the people in\r\ntheir centuries and tribes were to realize their sovereignty in actual\r\npublic life was left to the following period.\r\n\r\n    The literature on this subject is included in the bibliography\r\n    for the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE COMITIA TRIBUTA FROM 287 TO THE END OF THE\r\nREPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Tribunician Jurisdiction_\r\n\r\nWhereas the sources assume that the tribunes of the plebs as early at\r\nleast as the decemviral legislation had cognizance of both finable and\r\ncapital cases,[1925] an examination of the recorded trials leads to\r\nthe conclusion that they made little use of this power till the period\r\nbetween the legislation of Publilius Philo (339) and that of Hortensius\r\n(287).[1926] Whether their activity after 339 was due to the Publilian\r\nenactment of that year[1927] or merely to the gradual evolution of\r\npopular rights cannot be determined. However that may be, it was not\r\ntill after the Hortensian legislation that we find the tribunician\r\njurisdiction at its highest point of development and free from every\r\nrestriction.[1928]\r\n\r\nThe capital actions brought by the tribunes before the centuries in the\r\nperiod from Hortensius to the end of the republic have already been\r\nreviewed.[1929] We have now to consider the finable cases brought before\r\nthe comitia tributa in the same period. It is characteristic of the era\r\nimmediately following the Hortensian legislation, 287-232, described\r\nin the following chapter as politically stagnant,[1930] that only one\r\ntribunician prosecution is mentioned, and that against the consuls\r\nof 249 for contempt of the auspices. Appius Claudius Pulcher, one of\r\nthe consuls, was fined a hundred and twenty thousand asses, after the\r\naction had been transferred from the centuries to the tribes in the way\r\ndescribed in an earlier chapter.[1931]\r\n\r\nIn accord with the spirit of the Flaminian era, 232-201, on the other\r\nhand, is the prosecution of the retired consuls, M. Livius Salinator\r\nand L. Aemilius Paulus, on the ground that they had unjustly distributed\r\nthe booty gained in war. Technically the charge seems to have been\r\npeculatus;[1932] it was brought before the tribes in 218, doubtless by\r\ntribunes of the plebs. Aemilius narrowly escaped condemnation; Livius\r\nwas fined. The popular feeling against them was extremely bitter.[1933]\r\nIn 214 M. Atilius Regulus and P. Furius Philus, censors, degraded to\r\nthe condition of aerarius[1934] L. Caecilius Metellus,[1935] who after\r\nthe battle of Cannae had tried to persuade the knights to abandon\r\nItaly.[1936] He was elected tribune of the plebs for the following year,\r\nand made use of his office in an attempt to prosecute the censors before\r\nthe close of their administration. His purpose was thwarted, however,\r\nby the intercession of the remaining nine tribunes,[1937] who in this\r\nway saved for a time a conservative principle of the constitution—the\r\ninviolability of the magistrate from prosecutions while in office.[1938]\r\nThe trial of Postumius the publican, beginning in a finable action and\r\nending as perduellio, has been treated elsewhere.[1939] In the same\r\nperiod falls the trial of the tresviri nocturni for appearing too late at\r\na fire. They were accused by the tribunes and condemned by a vote of the\r\ntribes.[1940]\r\n\r\nThe era of the full-grown plutocracy, 201-134, is characterized by the\r\ngreat number of prosecutions of eminent persons for political objects.\r\nM. Porcius Cato was several times brought to trial for the conduct of\r\nhis consulship, 195, with the result that the speeches delivered in his\r\nown defence filled a volume.[1941] In 189 M’. Acilius Glabrio, then\r\ncandidate for the censorship, was accused of peculatus of booty by two\r\ntribunes in a finable action of a hundred thousand asses. The crime was\r\nalleged to have been committed in the preceding year, when as proconsul\r\nthe accused gained over the Aetolians and Antiochus a victory by which he\r\nwon the right to a triumph.[1942] Cato, formerly his military tribune and\r\nnow a competitor for the censorship, appearing as a witness, delivered\r\nat least four speeches against him. These proceedings forced Acilius to\r\ndrop the candidacy, whereupon the accusation was withdrawn.[1943] The\r\nattack upon this man is to be regarded as a manoeuvre of Cato and his\r\nsupporters against his political adversaries, the Scipios, who numbered\r\nthe accused among their friends. In 185 Cato was ready for a direct\r\nassault. In that year two of his supporters, both named Q. Petillius,\r\ntribunes of the plebs, made in the senate at his instance a demand that\r\nL. Scipio Asiagenus[1944] should render an account of the three thousand\r\ntalents paid him as war indemnity by Antiochus among the conditions of\r\npeace. His brother Publius, knowing well that the blow was in reality\r\naimed at himself, resolved to measure his full strength with that of his\r\nadversaries. When accordingly the record of the transaction was produced,\r\nPublius, complaining that an account of three thousand talents should\r\nbe demanded of a man who had brought fifteen thousand into the treasury\r\nfrom booty, tore the document in pieces.[1945] In this proceeding he\r\nkept strictly within his legal rights.[1946] Nothing further seems to\r\nhave been accomplished for the present;[1947] but M. Naevius, tribune\r\nof the plebs, after entering office December 10, 185, brought against\r\nPublius Scipio a prosecution, not for peculatus, but for official\r\nmisconduct. The specific charge was that in return for the restoration\r\nof his son from captivity he, as legatus of his brother, had granted too\r\nfavorable terms of peace to Antiochus. In the first contio the accused\r\nrecited his services to the state; in the second, which happened to\r\nfall on the anniversary of his victory over Hannibal, he invited the\r\npeople there assembled to go with him to the Capitoline temple to give\r\nthanks to Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, and the gods who kept the place, for\r\nhaving endowed him with the will and the ability to achieve that and\r\nother similar deeds in behalf of the commonwealth.[1948] Naturally the\r\ndissolution of the assembly vexed the tribunes. Before the day came for\r\nthe third contio he withdrew from Rome. His brother tried to excuse his\r\nabsence on the plea of sickness, and Ti. Sempronius Gracchus, tribune of\r\nthe plebs, prevented his colleagues from causing further annoyance to\r\nthe great man. The general circumstances indicate that the trial was to\r\ntake place before the tribes, and that the penalty in case of conviction\r\nwas accordingly to be a fine. His brother was still in danger. Early in\r\n184 C. Minucius Augurinus brought a finable action[1949] against Lucius\r\nconcerning the money received from Antiochus.[1950] He was condemned\r\nby the tribes, whereupon the prosecutor demanded surety (praedes) for\r\nthe payment of the fine. But when Scipio failed to comply, the tribune\r\nattempted to imprison him. Returning suddenly to Rome, Publius appealed\r\nto the tribunes in behalf of his brother. Whereas eight members of the\r\ncollege sustained the prosecutor, one of them, Ti. Gracchus, prevented\r\nthe imprisonment and consequently the collection of the fine.[1951] But\r\nthe total result of the proceedings was the overthrow of the Scipios,\r\nand the conqueror of Hannibal retired heart-broken to his country\r\nestate.[1952]\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 184, M. Porcius Cato, at that time censor, was\r\nprosecuted for official misconduct by tribunes in a finable action for\r\ntwo talents, but was in all probability acquitted.[1953] In this period\r\nthe tribes must have been unusually active in a judicial capacity,[1954]\r\nas Cato was himself prosecuted forty-four times, often doubtless before\r\nthe comitia tributa, but was always given a favorable verdict.[1955]\r\n\r\nC. Lucretius, praetor in 171, was accused in the senate by Chalcidian\r\nambassadors of merciless cruelties and robberies perpetrated by him on\r\ntheir community. Thereupon two tribunes of the plebs, M’. Juventius\r\nThalna and Cn. Aufidius, prosecuted him before the people, technically on\r\na charge of furtum and iniuria. He was condemned by all the tribes to a\r\nfine of a million asses.[1956] But after 149 most cases of misgovernment\r\nin the provinces came before the quaestio repetundarum instituted in that\r\nyear.[1957] There were occasional prosecutions for beginning war without\r\nauthorization.[1958] Toward the end of the pre-Gracchan oligarchy C.\r\nLaelius Sapiens, the friend of Scipio Aemilianus, seems to have been\r\nbrought to trial for malversation in his consulship of the year 140, but\r\nwas probably acquitted.[1959] A peculiar case, yet characteristic of\r\nthe time, was that against Cn. Tremellius, praetor in 160, for having\r\n“contended injuriously” with the supreme pontiff. It is stated merely\r\nthat he was fined. If the action came before the people, it must have\r\nbeen brought by a tribune, as the pontiff’s jurisdiction was restricted,\r\nso far as is known, to the sacerdotes under his supervision. Whatever may\r\nhave been the procedure, the effect was to place the religious official\r\nabove the magistrate[1960]—a policy which could be expected of the\r\ngeneration that adopted the Aelian and Fufian laws.[1961]\r\n\r\nSeveral prosecutions in the era extending from the Gracchi to Sulla\r\npartake of the revolutionary nature of the time. The inconsistency in the\r\nposition of Ti. Gracchus, who depended on the sanctity of the tribunate\r\nwhile technically violating it in the person of his colleague Octavius,\r\nis illustrated by his attack on T. Annius Luscus. The latter, a man of\r\nconsular rank, challenged Tiberius in the senate to answer definitely\r\nwhether or not he had branded with infamy a brother tribune whom the law\r\ndeclared sacred and inviolable. The senators applauded the challenge; but\r\nTiberius, hurrying from the Curia, convoked the plebs, and ordered Annius\r\nto come forward and defend himself against the charge of violating by\r\nhis words the tribunician sanctity. Before the proceedings could begin,\r\nAnnius by permission asked his accuser: “If you intend to deprive me of\r\nmy rank and disgrace me, and I appeal to a colleague of yours, and he\r\ncomes to my support, and you thereupon lose your temper, will you deprive\r\nhim of his office?” Plutarch, who tells this story, alleges further that\r\nTiberius, not knowing what to reply, dismissed the assembly and withdrew\r\nhis accusation.[1962] But the fact that Annius made a speech against\r\nTiberius[1963] indicates that the proceedings went farther. Evidently\r\nthe accused in some way escaped condemnation. The same political\r\nsignificance attaches to the tribunician capital prosecutions of the\r\ntime, mentioned in an earlier chapter.[1964] No more actions, however,\r\nare known to have been brought by the tribunes before the tribes till\r\n103,[1965] when Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, a popular tribune of the plebs,\r\nauthor of the famous statute concerning the election of sacerdotes,[1966]\r\nprosecuted M. Junius Silanus for misconduct as consul in 109. The\r\ncharge was that he had begun war on the Cimbri without an order of the\r\npeople. Notwithstanding the stigma of defeat borne by the accused, he\r\nwas acquitted by thirty-three of the thirty-five tribes.[1967] In the\r\nsame year Domitius prosecuted M. Aemilius Scaurus for having as consul\r\nneglected the sacra of the di Penates at Lavinium. The accused was\r\nacquitted by the votes of thirty-two tribes.[1968] These prosecutions,\r\ntogether with the plebiscite just mentioned, excited against Domitius an\r\nantipathy among the optimates which reveals itself in the sources but\r\nwhich his character hardly deserved.[1969]\r\n\r\nAnother popular tribune, C. Appuleius Decianus, 98, brought against P.\r\nFurius the accusation that in the preceding year the latter as tribune\r\nof the plebs had betrayed the people’s cause. Acquitted of that charge,\r\nhe was accused later in the year by C. Canuleius, another tribune, on\r\nthe ground that he had impeded the return of Metellus.[1970] In one of\r\nthe contiones for the trial of this case the citizens would not listen\r\nto the defence of the accused but tore him in pieces. In the same year\r\nAppuleius prosecuted L. Valerius Flaccus, curule aedile, on what charge\r\nis unknown. His own condemnation to exile, more probably by the centuries\r\nthan by a quaestio, on the ground that in his accusation of Furius he\r\nlamented the death of Appuleius Saturninus, his gentilis, is mentioned in\r\nan earlier chapter.[1971]\r\n\r\nSulla’s completion of the system of standing courts and his restriction\r\nof the tribunician function of prosecution[1972] substantially withdrew\r\nall judicial power from the tribal assembly under the presidency of\r\ntribunes. The overthrow of the Cornelian constitutional arrangements left\r\nthe standing courts with jurisdiction unimpaired. Though constitutionally\r\nthe tribunes by this overthrow regained their right to prosecute, they\r\nexercised it rarely and feebly during the remainder of the republic. C.\r\nMemmius, tribune of the plebs in 66, brought M. Terentius Varro Lucullus\r\nto trial for what he had done long before in his quaestorship at the\r\ndictation of Sulla. As the motive was evidently personal, the accused was\r\nacquitted.[1973] Early in 58 L. Antistius, tribune of the plebs, in the\r\ninterest of the optimates threatened to prosecute C. Julius Caesar, who\r\nhad just retired from his consulship and was on the point of setting out\r\nfor his provinces. Caesar appealed to the other tribunes, who suspended\r\nthe prosecution on the ground that the accused was to be necessarily\r\nabsent in the service of the state.[1974] In the year 44 C. Epidius\r\nMarullus and L. Caesetius Flavius, tribunes, instituted proceedings\r\nagainst the man who took the lead in acclaiming Caesar king as he was\r\nreturning from Alba. The evident displeasure of Caesar at the accusation\r\ncaused its withdrawal.[1975] In incomplete trials, like those last\r\nmentioned, it is seldom possible to determine whether they were to come\r\nbefore the centuries or the tribes.[1976]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Aedilician Jurisdiction_\r\n\r\nBefore the Hortensian legislation the curule and plebeian aediles alike\r\nhad cognizance of usury, stuprum, and violation of the law concerning\r\nthe limitation of occupation and pasturage of the public lands.[1977]\r\nIn the period now under consideration, beginning in 287, they continued\r\nto exercise the same function besides taking upon themselves some\r\nnew cases. Aedilician actions for violation of the pasturage clause\r\nof the Licinian-Sextian statute took place in 240,[1978] 196,[1979]\r\nand 193.[1980] Closely related is the fining of usurers in 192,[1981]\r\nand of grain dealers for cornering the market in 189.[1982] In 157 C.\r\nFurius Chresimus was prosecuted by a curule aedile for injuring the\r\ncrops of others by magic, and the case came before the tribes in the\r\nForum. By bringing his farm tools into the assembly and calling them his\r\ninstruments of magic he induced the citizens to vote his acquittal.[1983]\r\n\r\nThere are several known cases of criminal lust which fell within the\r\naedilician cognizance. In 227 C. Scantinus Capitolinus during his term of\r\noffice as tribune or aedile of the plebs was prosecuted by M. Claudius\r\nMarcellus, curule aedile, on a charge of attempted paederastia. He called\r\nattention to the sanctity of his person; but as the tribunes refused\r\nto protect him on that ground, he was condemned by the people.[1984]\r\nMost of the known cases of this general character were against women.\r\nSeveral matrons, accused of stuprum by the plebeian aediles of 213\r\nand fined by the comitia tributa, retired into exile.[1985] About the\r\ntime of the war with Hannibal a charge of incest, based on the fact of\r\nintermarriage between close relatives and brought doubtless by an aedile,\r\nwas judged favorably to the accused by the people.[1986] The curule\r\naedile A. Hostilius Mancinus, 183, brought to trial before the tribal\r\nassembly Manilia, a courtesan, who, he alleged, had thrown a stone at him\r\nin the night and had wounded him. Manilia, appealing to the tribunes,\r\nexplained that he was attempting violently to break into her house,\r\nwhen she repulsed him with stones. Thereupon the tribunes decreed that\r\nthe prosecutor deserved the treatment he had received. They interceded\r\nagainst his action, which accordingly had to be dropped.[1987]\r\n\r\nOne case of perduellio under aedilician jurisdiction is recorded. In\r\n246 Claudia, sister of that P. Claudius Pulcher who lost his fleet off\r\nDrepanum,[1988] was jostled by the crowd as she came from the games.\r\nShe was heard to say on this occasion that she wondered what would have\r\nhappened to herself, had her brother not caused the death of so many of\r\nthe citizens, and to wish that he were again living, to lose another\r\nfleet together with the crowd that troubled her. For these words she was\r\nbrought to trial by the aediles of the plebs, and the people imposed\r\non her a fine of 25,000 heavy asses.[1989] The case is described as a\r\niudicium maiestatis apud populum Romanum.[1990]\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the aediles as well as that of the tribunes suffered\r\nfrom the growth of standing courts.[1991] The fact that the power\r\nremained, provided the holder was in a position to use it, is proved by\r\nthe occasional recurrence of a prosecution in the lifetime of Cicero.\r\nFirst may be mentioned the proceedings instituted by C. Flavius Fimbria,\r\naedile in 86, against Q. Scaevola. Evidently the case did not come to\r\nvote.[1992] Interesting is the threat of Cicero[1993] as curule aedile to\r\nbring to trial before the people C. Verres and all who should by bribery\r\naid his acquittal. The circumstance that Cicero was ready to place so\r\ngreat a function upon the aedileship is proof of the confusion into\r\nwhich the ideas of popular jurisdiction had fallen through infrequent\r\nuse.[1994] Another anomaly is the prosecution begun by P. Clodius against\r\nT. Annius Milo on the charge of violence (vis).[1995] It took place in\r\nthe Forum before the comitia tributa, but we do not know whether it came\r\nto a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Pontifical Jurisdiction_\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of his disciplinary power the supreme pontiff sometimes\r\nimposed a fine on a sacerdos under his authority. An appeal to the\r\nthirty-five tribes was allowed, if the amount of the penalty reached the\r\nappealable limit.[1996] After the analogy of the civil magistrate the\r\npontiff presided over the assembly during the trial.[1997] In 189 Q.\r\nFabius Pictor, who was at the same time praetor and flamen Quirinalis,\r\nwas forbidden by the supreme pontiff to go to the province assigned\r\nhim. After much contention the pontiff imposed a fine, and an appeal\r\nwas taken to the people, who decided that the flamen must obey the\r\npontifex maximus, and on that condition remitted the fine.[1998] In 180\r\nL. Cornelius Dolabella was fined for refusal to resign his office of\r\nnaval duumvir that he might be inaugurated rex sacrificulus. The case\r\nwas decided as the preceding, but an unfavorable omen which dissolved\r\nthe assembly deterred the pontiffs from inaugurating him.[1999] A\r\nsimilar case occurred in 131.[2000] In the appeal of Claudius, an\r\naugur, from a pontifical fine, the date of which is unknown, though it\r\nprobably followed the trials above mentioned, the people sustained the\r\naccused.[2001] These are the few recorded cases of appeal from sacerdotal\r\njurisdiction. The moderation of the pontifex maximus, together with the\r\nrespect of his sacerdotes for religion, usually served to prevent the\r\nneed of recourse to the people. It is a noteworthy fact that the custom\r\nwas practically conterminous with the era of the most highly developed\r\nplutocracy. The circumstance that in all the cases known to have fallen\r\nwithin this period the people confirmed the authority of the pontiff\r\naffords striking evidence of the perfection to which the optimates had\r\nnow brought the religious machinery of their political system.[2002]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said on the judicial functions of the comitia in this\r\nand earlier chapters, it is clear that the jurisdiction of the people is\r\ninseparably connected with the political and constitutional history of\r\nRome. Beginning feebly in the early republic, the right of appeal was\r\nmost intensely exercised from the middle of the third to the middle of\r\nthe second century B.C. Its decline thereafter, owing mainly to the rise\r\nof the quaestiones, was a symptom of the general decay of the republic.\r\n\r\n    Peter, C., _Epochen der Verfassungsgesch. der röm.

No such result, however, was\r\nactually reached. Circumstances prove the leaders of the plebs to have\r\nbeen well satisfied with the political gains thus far made as regards\r\n(1) their place in the senate assured them by the Ovinian statute,[2004]\r\n(2) their right to the magistracies, confirmed by various laws, (3)\r\nthe powers of the tribunate and its relation to the senate established\r\nby the Hortensian statute. Content with their position as a branch of\r\nthe widened nobility, inferior neither politically nor socially to the\r\npatrician branch, and happy in the enjoyment of authority, they were now\r\nas much inclined as the patricians to discourage and to resist further\r\naggression on the part of the plain citizens. Their control of the\r\ninitiative in legislation was the chief means of forwarding this policy.\r\nTheir respect for the senate, in which they were now rapidly becoming the\r\ndominant party, was such that they were willing to forego the recently\r\nacquired privilege of bringing their rogations before the people without\r\nthe senatorial sanction. But in case a tribune was so bold and so out of\r\nharmony with his political peers as to offer an unsanctioned bill, they\r\ncould count on the intercession of one of his colleagues; if matters came\r\nto an extremity, the senate could annul the act after its adoption by\r\ndeclaring it illegal or contrary to the auspices.[2005] Evidently the\r\nplebeian nobles were aware, too, that with the increase in the number of\r\ncitizens and with their dispersion over Italy the assembly had ceased to\r\nrepresent the citizen body, and was failing in ability to grapple with\r\nthe new and increasingly complex problems of administration created by\r\nthe widening of the Roman domain.[2006]\r\n\r\nUnder these new conditions the assemblies continued, it is true, to\r\nelect their annual magistrates and to receive appeals from the judicial\r\ndecisions of the latter, more rarely to declare war or to ratify a\r\ntreaty. Occasionally they passed a law to increase the number of\r\nmagistrates or to regulate elections; but for the fifty-five years\r\nfollowing the Hortensian legislation, 287-232, there is no record of the\r\nenactment of a distinctly administrative law. The silence of history on\r\nthis point is due not so much to the exceptionally scant sources[2007] as\r\nto a lack of comitial activity.\r\n\r\nFirst among the statutes relating to the election of magistrates is to\r\nbe placed the Maenian plebiscite, adopted in 287 or thereabout, which\r\ndirected the patres in case of elections, as the Publilian statute had\r\ndirected them in case of rogations,[2008] to give their auctoritas before\r\nthe voting began, while the issue was still uncertain.[2009] Blocking\r\nthe last efforts of the patricians to monopolize the consulship,[2010]\r\nthe act completed the reduction of the patrum auctoritas to a formality.\r\nThe sources represent Appius Claudius Caecus as the chief offender\r\nwhom this law was designed to rebuke. His personality had brought\r\nto the censorship an enormous accretion of power which disturbed the\r\nconstitutional balance. In this period that magistracy assumed also the\r\nfunction of supervising the morals of the citizens.[2011] To check this\r\ndisproportionate growth a law, probably tribunician, of 265 forbade\r\nreëlection to the office.[2012]\r\n\r\nThe Romans created no more absolutely new magistratus ordinarii. In 267,\r\nhowever, probably by an act of the comitia tributa, they doubled the\r\nnumber of quaestors—from four to eight—in order that the new members of\r\nthe college might attend to the financial business of the government at\r\nvarious points in Italy.[2013] A second praetor was created in 242,[2014]\r\ndoubtless by a law, not only for jurisdiction inter peregrinos but\r\nalso for increasing the number of magistrates available for military\r\ncommands.[2015] The tresviri capitales, instituted in 289,[2016] were\r\ngiven the rank of magistrate by a plebiscite of L. Papirius, adopted\r\nafter 242, which directed the urban praetor to elect these officials\r\nin the comitia tributa.[2017] In 241 the people, probably in tribal\r\nassembly, granted to L. Caecilius Metellus on account of his blindness\r\nthe privilege of riding to the Curia in a carriage.[2018]\r\n\r\nOne statute referred to this period[2019] belongs to the domain of\r\nprivate law. The first chapter of the tribunician lex Aquilia provided\r\n“that if a slave of another man, or a quadruped of his cattle, be\r\nunlawfully slain, whatever within a year is the highest value thereof,\r\nthat amount the offender shall pay to the owner.”[2020] The second\r\nchapter secured the principal stipulator against adstipulators, and the\r\nthird provided for all other kinds of damage.[2021] It superseded all\r\nprevious statutes on the subject, including that of the Twelve Tables.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Flaminian Era_[2022]\r\n\r\n232-201\r\n\r\nSuch is the scant list of legislative acts of the half century following\r\nthe dictatorship of Hortensius (287-232), none of them as innovating\r\nas, for instance, the reform of the comitia centuriata brought about in\r\napproximately the same period by the power of the censors alone.[2023]\r\nThe nobles had a certain degree of reason for feeling secure in their\r\ncontrol of the administration. But in this respect they miscalculated.\r\nThe long war with Carthage, which had diverted the attention of all the\r\ncitizens from politics, ended without bringing in the wake of victory\r\nthe usual rewards to the masses. No lands in Sicily were assigned to the\r\ncitizens, while on their northeastern border the Picene district and the\r\nterritory recently taken from the Gauls in the neighborhood of Ariminum\r\nwere reserved by the nobles for their own occupation. Popular discontent\r\nat these short-sighted, selfish proceedings found expression in the\r\nrogation of C. Flaminius, tribune of the plebs in 232, for the assignment\r\nof the lands here mentioned to the citizens who were willing to settle\r\non the frontier.[2024] It was vehemently opposed by the nobility,[2025]\r\nand was finally passed without the authorization of a senatus\r\nconsultum.[2026] From a statement of Cicero[2027] that as long afterward\r\nas 228 Q. Fabius Maximus, then consul a second time, was hindering\r\nFlaminius from dividing the land, we may infer that the author of the law\r\nwas elected among the tresviri charged with its administration.[2028]\r\nMost of the settlers in that region were assigned to the tribe Velina,\r\nprobably in pursuance of an article of the Flaminian statute.[2029] The\r\nenactment came as a disagreeable interruption to the quiet happiness of\r\nthe nobles—as a sign that the political battle fought out between comitia\r\nand senate in the period ending with the Hortensian legislation was to\r\nbe renewed with perhaps even greater bitterness. Hence Polybius, echoing\r\nthe complaints of the nobles, denounces the measure as the first step\r\ntoward the demoralization of the people.[2030] The lasting hatred felt by\r\nthe senators for this new and powerful enemy is seen in their refusal to\r\ngrant him a triumph for military successes he had won as consul in 223. A\r\nplebiscite without their authorization gave the desired privilege to the\r\nchampion of popular rights.[2031] It was probably in this connection—at\r\nleast we are soon to hear of it for the first time—that an act of the\r\npeople was made essential to a triumph within the city. Henceforth even\r\nwhen the senate was willing to allow a triumph or an ovation, the person\r\nthus honored could not hold imperium in the city on the day of such\r\nfestival excepting by a comitial lex. Usually in cases of the kind the\r\nsenate, after voting the privilege, instructed a praetor to request one\r\nof the tribunes to bring a rogatio de imperio before the tribes.[2032]\r\nThe earliest known act of the kind is the plebiscite of 211 which granted\r\nthe imperium to M. Marcellus, proconsul on the day of his ovation.[2033]\r\n\r\nThe popular party had not long to wait for an opportunity to retaliate\r\nupon the senate for the slight it had offered their champion. On the\r\nprecedent of the Ovinian law[2034] the people had a right to legislate\r\nconcerning the honors, privileges, and qualifications of its individual\r\nmembers.[2035] In 219 accordingly the plebiscite of Q. Claudius, known\r\nto have been supported in the senate by C. Flaminius alone, who was then\r\ncensor, prohibited senators and their sons from owning sea-going ships\r\nof more than three hundred amphoras capacity.[2036] It was probably\r\nan article of this statute which forbade the same class of persons\r\nto take contracts from the government, with the reservation of such\r\neconomically insignificant agreements as concerned worship.[2037] The\r\npeasants, whose interests Flaminius represented, opposed the renewal of\r\nthe war with Carthage, regarding it as a means of extending the field\r\nof commerce and speculation of the nobles. This law therefore expresses\r\nthe determination of the country people that the senatorial families\r\nshould no longer share the advantages of such wars. From the point of\r\nview of the statesman it was the first step toward the separation of\r\nthe governing class from the commercial class, with a view to guarding\r\nagainst the administration of the government in the sole interest of\r\ncapital. The result was not all that could be desired; the senatorial\r\nfamilies found secret ways of placing a great part of their funds in\r\ncommercial companies; and in so far as the law was actually effective,\r\nit compelled senators to invest money in Italian land[2038]—a proceeding\r\nwhich contributed largely to the economic ruin of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of finance, which in spite of occasional\r\ninterference on the part of the comitia remained with the senate, is\r\nincluded the regulation of coinage. The comitia passed few acts relating\r\nto the subject. The earliest known to history is the misnamed lex minus\r\nsolvendi of C. Flaminius, consul in 217, which introduced the uncial\r\nstandard for the as, making for ordinary use sixteen asses of an ounce\r\nweight equivalent to ten old—in other words, to the denarius.[2039] In\r\nthe payment of soldiers, however, the denarius was still reckoned at ten\r\nasses.[2040] Probably the same law regulated the issue of plated silver\r\ndenarii[2041] and of gold coins.[2042] The debtor’s gain was offset by\r\nthe actual decrease in the weight of the _as_ to a little more than an\r\nounce before the enactment of the law.[2043] This measure was followed\r\nthe next year by the plebiscite of M. Minucius, which created the\r\ntriumviri mensarii, a banking commission for relieving the great lack of\r\nmoney (216).[2044] The board managed some of the financial business of\r\nthe state,[2045] and undoubtedly did what it could to strengthen private\r\ncredit, which at this time was at a low ebb.[2046] The next step taken\r\nby the comitia was the enactment of a plebiscite within a field properly\r\nbelonging to the censors under senatorial supervision—the building and\r\nrepair of public works.[2047] In 212 the act of an unknown tribune,\r\ncarried through the comitia with the consent of the senate, created three\r\ntemporary administrative boards—quinqueviri for repairing the defences\r\nof the city, triumviri to seek for property belonging to the temples\r\nand to register gifts, and another board of three for repairing the\r\ntemples of Fortune, Mater Matuta, and Hope. These officials were to be\r\nelected by the tribes under the chairmanship of the urban praetor.[2048]\r\nNearly related is the plebiscite of 210, which in pursuance of a senatus\r\nconsultum directed the censors to farm the vectigalia of the Campanian\r\nterritory.[2049] Evidently in the trying time of the war with Hannibal\r\nthe senate found it advisable to conciliate the citizens by voluntarily\r\nbringing a few administrative measures of the kind before it. All this\r\nlegislation was due more or less directly to the influence of Flaminius.\r\nA succession of sumptuary laws may be likewise traced to his second\r\nconsulship, 217. The Twelve Tables contained a number of laws relating\r\nto funerals, designed to preserve good order and to prevent extravagant\r\nexpense.[2050] After their ratification the authority of the magistrates\r\nand especially of the censors sufficed for the maintenance of good\r\nconduct, till in the period of the Punic wars the character of the\r\npeople began to suffer deterioration, whereupon the assemblies undertook\r\nto enact new laws for the enforcement of morality. One of the earliest\r\nwas the lex alearia, which prohibited the game of dice. Its mention by\r\nPlautus makes it prior to 204.[2051] The name of the author is not given;\r\nand for that reason we cannot be sure that it was a comitial law.[2052]\r\nTo the same period belongs the plebiscite of P. and M. Silius concerning\r\nweights and measures.[2053] The first comitial sumptuary statute is the\r\nlex Metilia (217), probably tribunician, passed under the influence of C.\r\nFlaminius and L. Aemilius, who were censors in 220. It prescribed certain\r\nrules for the preparation of cloth.[2054] The object, in Lange’s[2055]\r\nopinion, was to strike at the luxury of the nobles through the guild of\r\nfullers. It was a warning to them, he asserts, which however they failed\r\nto heed. If this was indeed the object, the means were surprisingly\r\nfeeble. The next sumptuary law was the plebiscite of C. Oppius, 215,\r\ndirected against the luxury of wealthy women. It forbade a woman to wear\r\nmore than a half ounce of gold or a dress of various colors or to ride\r\nin a carriage in a city or town or within a mile of either, excepting\r\nwhen engaged in public worship.[2056] The author must have sympathized\r\nwith the tendency of Flaminius, and the law was supported, or at\r\nleast not opposed, by the nobility. Twenty years afterward their best\r\nrepresentatives strove in vain to maintain it against the rising tide of\r\nwealth and luxury.[2057]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Flaminius on legislation may be traced still farther.\r\nUnder the economic distress of the war with Hannibal the plebs began to\r\nlapse into clientage to the nobles. In spite of the principle that the\r\npatron should accept no honorarium for legal service,[2058] the nobles\r\nbegan by the requisition of gifts to render the commons tributary to\r\nthemselves.[2059] The chief occasion for these exactions was found in\r\nthe Saturnalia, which was reconstituted in 217.[2060] To check the abuse\r\nthe Publician plebiscite mentioned by Macrobius,[2061] undoubtedly of\r\nC. Publicius Bibulus, the popular tribune of 209,[2062] prohibited all\r\ngifts from the poor to the rich on that festival with the exception of\r\nwax candles. It was supplemented in 204 by the plebiscite of M. Cincius\r\nAlimentus,[2063] which absolutely forbade gifts and fees for legal\r\nservice.[2064] The prohibition of a magistrate’s acceptance of gifts for\r\nthe performance of official duty was undoubtedly included in it.[2065]\r\nMoreover it forbade all gifts above a specified amount, but with\r\nexceptions in favor of various relatives and benefactors.[2066]\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that the Flaminian age saw the earliest comitial\r\nlegislation governing judicial procedure in private cases.[2067] Some\r\nchanges were wrought, too, in family law by popular vote. In early\r\ntime intermarriage between persons of the sixth degree of kinship was\r\nforbidden by usage;[2068] but in the period between the first and second\r\nPunic wars the right was extended to relatives of the fifth and sixth\r\ndegrees,[2069] and shortly afterward to those of the fourth degree\r\n(consobrini).[2070] Another law, the lex Atilia, enacted between 242 and\r\n186,[2071] probably in the second Punic war,[2072] directed the urban\r\npraetor to appoint a tutor for a woman or child who was left without a\r\nnatural protector.[2073] It now became possible, too, for a magistrate\r\nunder justifying circumstances to place a young man under twenty-five\r\nin the care of a curator, in accordance with the Plaetorian law,[2074]\r\nwhich was enacted before 192,[2075] and which belongs therefore to the\r\nFlaminian age.[2076]\r\n\r\nIn the same period we find the comitia active in other fields. In 215 a\r\ntribal law of an unknown author granted the citizenship to three hundred\r\nCampanian knights who had remained faithful to Rome, and assigned them to\r\nthe municipium of Cumae.[2077] Following a precedent set by the Antistian\r\nplebiscite of 319,[2078] L. Atilius, tribune of the plebs in 210, carried\r\na law, in pursuance of a senatus consultum, for granting the senate\r\nabsolute power over the Campanians who had revolted;[2079] and the senate\r\naccordingly not only punished them with loss of citizenship but reduced\r\nthem to miserable subjection.[2080] The right of the comitia to ratify\r\na vow of a sacred spring was recognized in 217 by an opinion rendered\r\nby the pontiffs,[2081] and was first exercised through a plebiscite of\r\nthat year.[2082] The appointment of commissioners for the dedication of\r\ntemples also belonged to the assembly,[2083] as well as the regulation\r\nof religious festivals.[2084] The greatest gain made by the people\r\nwithin the province of religious legislation in the third century B.C.\r\nwas the provision for electing the pontifex maximus by seventeen tribes\r\ndrawn by lot from the whole number thirty-five and presided over by\r\na pontiff. This innovation probably belongs to the Flaminian era and\r\ncertainly to the time before 212, when the first instance of such an\r\nelection is given.[2085] The act was followed by another, before 209,\r\nwhich authorized the election of the chief curio in the same way.[2086]\r\nThe object was to take the control of these places from the nobles,\r\nwho looked upon the great sacerdotal collegia as a main support of\r\ntheir political power.[2087] It was but the beginning of a movement\r\nfor transferring the appointment of all members of these collegia to\r\nthe comitia sacerdotum, made up as above described. In the peculiar\r\ncomposition of assemblies of this character we see an attempt to make\r\nthe gods in some degree coadjutors of the populace in filling the sacred\r\nplaces.[2088]\r\n\r\nThe assembly was merely exercising a long-recognized right[2089] in the\r\ninstitution of two new praetors in 227, for which we are warranted\r\nin assuming a legislative act.[2090] The same observation applies to\r\nthe increase in the number of elective military tribunes from sixteen\r\nto twenty-four in 207,[2091] which was evidently a concession to the\r\ncommons. As the senate generally attended to the prolongation of the\r\nimperium,[2092] the confirmation of a senatorial decree to that effect\r\nby an act of the people in 208[2093] was exceptional. Far more radical\r\nwas the plebiscite of M. Metilius, 217, for equalizing the power of\r\nthe dictator with that of the master of horse.[2094] This act and the\r\nresort to election for filling the office[2095] destroyed the value of\r\nthe institution.[2096] A violent departure from usage was attempted in\r\n209 by the rogation of C. Publicius Bibulus, tribune of the plebs, for\r\nabrogating the proconsular imperium of M. Claudius Marcellus. On this\r\noccasion not merely the plebs but all classes attended the assembly,\r\nwhich by an overwhelming vote rejected the proposition.[2097] Three\r\nquarters of a century were to pass before a law of the kind could\r\nactually carry.[2098]\r\n\r\nA plebiscite known to have been in force in the time of the second Punic\r\nwar[2099] debarred from the tribunate and aedileship of the plebs any\r\nperson during the lifetime of a father or grandfather who had filled a\r\ncurule office. As the aim was to free the plebeian officials from the\r\ninfluence of the nobility, exercised through the patria potestas, that\r\nthey might be in a better position to serve the interests of their\r\nconstituents, we may reasonably suppose this measure to have passed in\r\nthe time of Flaminius and under his influence. The tendency was to widen\r\nthe breach then forming between the nobility and the commons.[2100] The\r\nright of the people to dispense from the law was acknowledged by the\r\nsenate in 217, when, after the destruction of the army at Trasimene and\r\nthe death of Flaminius, the patres authorized a plebiscite for dispensing\r\nthe consulars for the remainder of the war from the Genucian plebiscite\r\nwhich forbade reëlection to the same office excepting after an interval\r\nof ten years.[2101]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been given above it is clear that Flaminius began a new era\r\nin legislation, by no change in the constitution, but rather by assuming\r\nthe free initiative granted the tribunes of the plebs through the\r\nHortensian statute. Under the influence of his personality the comitia\r\nrecovered the share in the administration which they had lost in the\r\nhalf century of lethargy just passed, and even made new inroads into the\r\nprovince of magisterial and senatorial authority. While the disaster at\r\nCannae, following hard upon that of Trasimene, subdued the rising spirit\r\nof popular independence, it made the senate more conciliatory,[2102] with\r\nthe result that neither did the comitia lapse into its former repose\r\nnor did the nobles lose their hold on the government. It was to this\r\nera, more definitely to the opening of the war with Hannibal, that the\r\ndescription of the constitution by Polybius[2103] applies. The political\r\ncondition of Rome was improving,[2104] or was just at its zenith.[2105]\r\nAs the senate was at the height of its power, public measures were\r\ndeliberated upon, not by the many, but by the best men.[2106] Political\r\nlife was sound, elections were pure, and a scrupulous fear of the\r\ngods remained the strongest support of the commonwealth.[2107] At this\r\nepoch the three chief constitutional elements—magistrates, senate, and\r\ncomitia—were so perfectly balanced that even a native would hardly be\r\nable to say whether the form of government was monarchy, aristocracy,\r\nor democracy.[2108] In this equilibrium of forces, in this mutual power\r\nof checking or strengthening, lay the might and the excellence of the\r\nconstitution.[2109]\r\n\r\nIt is solely with the place of the assemblies in this system that we are\r\nat present concerned. Inasmuch as the consuls were supreme masters of\r\nthe home administration, as well as of the actual conduct of war,[2110]\r\nand as the senate controlled finance, diplomacy, and all interstate\r\njudicial business affecting the Italian allies,[2111] what part in the\r\ngovernment could have been left to the people? Polybius answers a most\r\nweighty part. They are constitutionally the sole fountain of honor and\r\npunishment, by which alone governments and societies are held together.\r\nNot only are they in a position to discriminate between the fit and the\r\nunfit in elections to office, but they are the sole court for trying\r\ncases involving life and death. The death penalty, however, may be\r\navoided by voluntary exile, if undertaken before a majority has been\r\nreached in the process of voting.[2112] Even finable actions in which the\r\nproposed penalty is considerable, especially when the accused has held\r\na higher magistracy, come before them. It is they who bestow offices on\r\nthe deserving—the most honorable reward which the constitution grants\r\nto virtue. It is they who have absolute power to decide concerning the\r\nadoption or repeal of laws; and most important of all, it is they who\r\ndeliberate concerning war and peace, and who ratify or reject proposals\r\nfor alliances, truces, and treaties.[2113] These facts might lead one to\r\nsuppose that the supreme power is with the people and that the government\r\nis a democracy.[2114] In the domestic administration the consuls are\r\ndependent on them for authorizing various kinds of business and are under\r\nobligations to execute their decrees.[2115] In war, however distant\r\nfrom home, the consul must still court their favor, to secure their\r\nratification of his arrangements for peace; and on laying down his office\r\nhe is liable to prosecution before them for maladministration.[2116]\r\nHence he can afford to neglect them no more than he can the senate.[2117]\r\n\r\nThe senate, too, is dependent upon the people for ratifying all serious\r\npenalties imposed by the courts, which are made up of senators.[2118]\r\nSimilarly in matters directly concerning that body, the people have power\r\nto accept or reject proposals for diminishing its traditional authority,\r\nfor depriving its members of dignities or offices, or even for lessening\r\ntheir means of livelihood.[2119] But the greatest popular restriction\r\nupon its authority is the tribunician veto, which can prevent it from\r\npassing a decree or even from holding a meeting. As the tribunes are\r\nunder obligations to carry into effect the decisions of the people and\r\nin every way to have regard for their wishes,—for this and for the other\r\nreasons mentioned, the senate respects the people and cannot fail to\r\nneglect their feelings.[2120]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing remarks of Polybius it is clear that in the political\r\ntheory of his time the will of the multitude when expressed by a comitial\r\nact prevailed, in other words that the people were sovereign. Several\r\nchecks on their action from the side of the senate and magistrates he\r\nmentions, especially the absolute power of life and death exercised by\r\nthe consuls in war over those under their command,[2121] and the control\r\nover the citizens wielded by the senate through the management of public\r\ncontracts and through filling the courts from its own number. But the\r\nmost important limitation, implied throughout this discussion though\r\nnever expressly mentioned, is the lack of popular initiative. The people\r\ncould convene for no business whatever unless summoned by a magistrate.\r\nThey could consider no other subject than that proposed to them by the\r\npresident; they could take no part in the deliberation excepting in so\r\nfar as the president granted permission to individuals; they could merely\r\nvote yes or no on the question presented to them.[2122] Notwithstanding\r\nthe theory of popular sovereignty these conditions prevented the rise of\r\na real democracy; they placed the assemblies under the control of the\r\nmagistrates, who as a rule, including even the tribunes, were willing\r\nministers of the senate. The bridled masses were rendered more obedient\r\nby the disasters of the war with Hannibal, and the nobles were soon to\r\ngrow arrogant and violent through a surfeit of wealth and power.[2123]\r\nUnder these new circumstances the docility of the commons made possible\r\nthe thorough organization of plutocracy on the basis of a democratic\r\ntheory of government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Era of the Completed Plutocracy, based on a Recognition of\r\nPopular Sovereignty_\r\n\r\n201-134\r\n\r\nThe period from the close of the war with Hannibal to the tribunate of\r\nTi. Gracchus is marked by no such display of comitial energy as that\r\nwhich characterized either the pre-Hortensian age or the epoch introduced\r\nby Flaminius. In return for a spurious freedom and a pretended share in\r\nthe administration the assembly became the handmaid of the plutocracy.\r\n\r\nThere was, as usual, some legislation of the old kind concerning\r\nmagistrates. In 198 the number of praetors was increased to six.[2124]\r\nThe arrangement was modified by the consular statute of M. Baebius,\r\n181, which provided for the election of four and six on alternate\r\nyears,[2125] with the object of giving the governors of the Spains a\r\nbiennial term.[2126] The greedy office-seekers by another statute brought\r\nabout the repeal of this arrangement in 179.[2127] The only new office\r\nwas that of the tresviri epulones, instituted by a plebiscite of C.\r\nLicinius Lucullus, 196. Their function was to attend to certain religious\r\nfestivals, especially to the feast of Jupiter held on November 13. The\r\nlaw provided that these officials should wear the toga praetexta just as\r\ndid the pontiffs.[2128]\r\n\r\nA stage in the development of the plutocracy and of its control\r\nover the plebeian tribunate is marked by the enactment of the lex\r\nannalis of L. Villius, tribune of the plebs in 180. This statute not\r\nonly fixed the ages at which men might sue for and hold the various\r\npatrician magistracies,[2129] but also, developing a custom already\r\nin existence, established an interval, evidently of two years,[2130]\r\nbetween consecutive magistracies. The stated object was to curb the\r\ngreed for office which the young nobles were manifesting[2131] as well\r\nas the eagerness of the people to favor such ambitious persons, and for\r\nthat reason it received the support of Cato.[2132] While it prevented\r\nthe Scipios and the Flaminini from creating a dynastic oligarchy, by\r\nchecking the growth of exceptional talent and by subjecting statesmen to\r\na fixed routine of honors and functions it subordinated the individual\r\nto the class, and in this way aided the consolidation of the senatorial\r\nplutocracy.[2133] To the same period, at all events after 194,[2134]\r\nbelong the Licinian and Aebutian plebiscites, which prohibited the\r\npresiding magistrate from offering as candidates for any extraordinary\r\noffice himself, his colleagues, and his relations by blood or marriage.\r\nThis measure, too, was to prevent the formation of governing cliques and\r\ndynasties. In 151, the year after the third consulship of M. Claudius\r\nMarcellus,[2135] to check the further aggrandizement of this man as well\r\nas the rise of similar personalities, a law, supported by Cato,[2136]\r\nabsolutely forbade reëlection to the consulship.[2137] Cato’s idea\r\nmay have been to expedite the advancement of novi homines; but so far\r\nfrom accomplishing this object, the measure contributed to the further\r\nsubordination of the individual to the plutocratic machine.[2138] It may\r\nwell have been in the same partisan spirit rather than in the interest of\r\npolitical morality that P. Cornelius and M. Baebius Tamphilus, consuls\r\nin 181, carried a law ex auctoritate senatus for the prosecution of\r\nbribery. It disqualified for office for ten years any person found guilty\r\nof influencing an election through bribery or other illegal means.[2139]\r\nProbably through this measure the nobles aimed to curb the greed of\r\noffice in the more ambitious and unscrupulous of their number; but it\r\naccomplished nothing, and was followed in 159 by another consular lex\r\nde ambitu of Cn. Cornelius Dolabella and M. Fulvius Nobilior, which\r\nincreased the penalty to death.[2140] Practically the punishment was\r\nexile. This law had no more effect than the earlier; and the conduct of\r\nthe nobles both before and after its enactment proves that they did not\r\nintend by it to open the consulship to the competition of novi homines.\r\n\r\nThe limitation upon the judicial imperium of magistrates and\r\npromagistrates by the three Porcian laws of appeal, which belong\r\nto this period, has been considered in connection with popular\r\njurisdiction.[2141] The last of these acts affected the administration\r\nof the provinces and of military affairs, which belonged originally to\r\nthe magistrates and the senate. It was only by degrees that the people\r\ninterfered in this department. The earliest known act of the kind was\r\nthe consular lex de sumptu provinciali of M. Porcius Cato, 195, for\r\nlimiting the expenses of provincials in the support and honor of the\r\ngovernor.[2142] To prevent conflicts in the provinces between the\r\nincoming and the retiring governor, Cato favored a regulation, adopted\r\nprobably in 177, whether a lex or a senatus consultum has not been\r\ndetermined, to the effect that the imperium of the outgoing functionary\r\nshould cease on the arrival of the new.[2143] It was still more unusual\r\nfor the people to take part in the organization of a new province; but in\r\n146 a lex Livia, probably tribunician, commissioned P. Scipio Aemilianus,\r\nassisted by ten legati, to organize the province of Africa.[2144]\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs the assemblies took the same part as in the preceding\r\nperiod; the centuries continued to declare war and the tribes to ratify\r\npeace. In 196 the tribunician lex Marcia Atinia compelled the consuls\r\nagainst their will to conclude a treaty with Macedon.[2145] In 149 L.\r\nScribonius Libo, tribune of the plebs, attempted in vain to secure the\r\nadoption of a rogation for restoring liberty to the Lusitanians, whom\r\nthe praetor Servius Galba had treacherously enslaved.[2146] No less\r\ncharacteristic of the age is the consular lex of L. Furius and Ser.\r\nAtilius, 136, for surrendering C. Mancinus to the Numantines because\r\nwithout the consent of the senate he had made an unfavorable treaty with\r\nthem.[2147] The deterioration in the character of Roman generalship and\r\nwarfare is indicated by a statute of unknown authorship, enacted after\r\n180,[2148] which forbade a triumph to a commander who had not killed at\r\nleast five thousand of the enemy in a single battle.[2149] The intention\r\nof the law, however, which obviously was to prevent commanders from\r\ntriumphing for fictitious or insignificant victories, was circumvented by\r\nfalsifications regarding the number of enemies slain or by triumphs on\r\nthe Alban Mount.[2150]\r\n\r\nWhereas before the second century B.C. no mention is made of a comitial\r\nact for the founding of a colony, in the beginning of the period now\r\nunder consideration the function was exercised by the people three or\r\nfour times in quick succession. In 197 was enacted the tribunician\r\nstatute of C. Atinius for planting five colonies—Vulturnum, Liternum,\r\nPuteoli, Salernum, and Buxentum—on the coast of Italy, each to consist of\r\nthree hundred families, the execution of the measure to be in the hands\r\nof triumviri, who were to hold their office three years.[2151] Not long\r\nafterward a plebiscite of Q. Aelius Tubero provided for founding two\r\nLatin colonies, one in Bruttium, the other at Thurii, each by triumviri,\r\nwho likewise held office three years. The measure was authorized by a\r\nsenatus consultum, 194.[2152] In the same year a tribunician law of\r\nM. Baebius Tamphilus provided for the establishment of three Roman\r\ncolonies.[2153] Mention of colonial legislation by the people then\r\nceases. Although the phenomenon may be due in some cases to the sources,\r\nthis explanation does not generally hold good, especially as the\r\ncolonization of the years 189[2154] and 184[2155] is expressly attributed\r\nto the senate, and because Velleius[2156] credits that body with the\r\nfounding of all the colonies from the Gallic conflagration to his own\r\ntime. Probably before the Gracchi a senatorial decree was issued in every\r\ncase, and though the commissioners for conducting colonies were as a rule\r\nelected by the tribes after 296,[2157] the people were given but a taste\r\nof power within this administrative field.[2158]\r\n\r\nEarly in the second century B.C. we find creditors rioting in usury,\r\nunchecked by the various statutes which had been enacted against the\r\nevil. They discovered a way of circumventing the law by transferring\r\ntheir securities to citizens of an allied state, who had a right to force\r\nthe collection of debts under the law of their own community. To put a\r\nstop to this kind of fraud the senate decreed that after a stated date\r\nallies who lent money to Roman citizens should register the transaction,\r\nand that in suits for the collection of such money the debtor should have\r\nthe privilege of choosing under which law, whether that of Rome or of the\r\nallied community, the suit against him should be tried. As the registers\r\nprovided for the purpose showed that an enormous amount of fraud was\r\nstill being committed in circumvention of the law and of the senatorial\r\nact, M. Sempronius, tribune of the plebs in 193, ex auctoritate patrum\r\nproposed and carried a statute which ordered that money lent between\r\na Roman citizen and one of a Latin or other allied state should be\r\ncollected under Roman law.[2159] This is one of the earliest instances\r\nof unfairness introduced by Rome into the private relations between her\r\ncitizens and those of her allies.[2160]\r\n\r\nFamily law underwent some modification. A plebiscite of Q. Voconius\r\nSaxa, 169,[2161] provided that no citizen assessed at a hundred thousand\r\nasses or more should will his property to a woman.[2162] Another article\r\nlimited to a half of the estate the amount which any legatee, male or\r\nfemale, could receive.[2163] Dowries were regulated by a lex Maenia,\r\nwhich seems to belong to 186.[2164]\r\n\r\nIn the bestowal of the citizenship the people were unhampered. Doubtless\r\nfor some time after the Hortensian legislation comitial acts for this\r\npurpose were commonly authorized by senatus consulta; but in the year\r\n188 we first hear the enunciation of the principle that the people\r\nwithout the authority of the senate had the power to bestow the ius\r\nsuffragii on whomsoever they pleased.[2165] The principle was carried\r\ninto immediate effect by the tribunician statute of C. Valerius Tappo,\r\nwhich without a senatus consultum conferred the right of suffrage on\r\nthe Formiani, Fundani, and Arpinates, who hitherto had been cives sine\r\nsuffragio. The determination of the tribe to which new citizens should\r\nbelong was also provided for by the legislative act of admission.[2166]\r\nThe citizenship granted in this period continued occasionally to be\r\nlimited. The Campanians, excluded forever from the rights of the state\r\nin 210,[2167] were in 188 placed under the census by a senatus consultum\r\nof the preceding year and were given intermarriage probably by a similar\r\nact.[2168] In early time, at least before 184, the custom arose of\r\ngranting to the founders of a colony the right to enroll as citizens\r\na specified number of aliens. The first recorded instance belongs to\r\nthe year mentioned, in which the poet Ennius received the citizenship\r\nin accordance with such a law.[2169] It was by the pretorian comitia\r\ntributa that the priestesses of Ceres, who were Greeks from Naples,\r\nVelia, or Sicily, were admitted to the citizenship.[2170] Perhaps by\r\nthe same assembly, at all events by an act of the people, a slave\r\nwho deserved well of the state was given his liberty, which involved\r\ncitizenship.[2171] Such grants to single individuals by the people,\r\nhowever, must have been rare.[2172] A Roman taken captive in war,\r\nrecovered all his rights simply by returning home (postliminium).[2173]\r\nBut even when an entire community was brought into the state by a single\r\nvote, the wording of the law indicates that the inhabitants received\r\nthe honor as individuals and not in mass.[2174] It was permissible for\r\nindependent communities and individuals to reject the offer of the\r\nfranchise,[2175] whereas subjects and partial citizens were compelled\r\nto accept it.[2176] From the facts here stated it will immediately\r\nappear that after the people had acquired an unconditioned right to\r\nextend the Roman franchise, they made little use of the opportunity.\r\nThe senate could well afford to concede to them a power which they\r\ncherished a growing disinclination to use. The expansion of the empire\r\nhad at length so enhanced the value of citizenship that the masses were\r\nunwilling except on the rarest occasions to share its advantages with\r\nothers.[2177] Any attempt, therefore, on the part of aliens to usurp the\r\nrights of the city was resented. In 187 we find the senate appointing the\r\npraetor Q. Terentius Culleo extraordinary commissioner for determining\r\nby investigation who from the Latin towns had recently usurped the\r\ncitizenship, and for expelling from Rome those found guilty of the\r\noffence.[2178] Soon afterward the people extended their power over such\r\ncases; in 177 a second expulsion of the Latins was brought about by a\r\nconsular law of C. Claudius Pulcher.[2179]\r\n\r\nThe same spirit prompted the citizens to limit the political rights of\r\nfreedmen. There can be no doubt that early Rome was as liberal in the\r\ntreatment of this class as of aliens. From earliest times they had a\r\nright to acquire land; and such proprietors were undoubtedly enrolled\r\nin the tribes in which their estates were situated.[2180] From the\r\nbeginning, however, custom deprived them of the ius honorum[2181] and\r\nof conubium. The former they acquired along with the other plebeians,\r\nalthough they were less readily admitted to the actual enjoyment of\r\nit;[2182] the latter they continued to lack.[2183] They were exempt,\r\ntoo, from ordinary military service.[2184] In time their condition\r\nbecame worse. C. Flaminius as censor in 220, in the interest of the rural\r\nplebs,[2185] began arbitrarily to assign all the libertini, whether they\r\nhad lands or not, to the four city tribes,[2186] doubtless at the same\r\ntime to the supernumerary centuries of the comitia centuriata.[2187]\r\nBut the sons of freedmen, themselves originally libertini,[2188] came\r\nin time to be looked upon as ingenui, with the same legal rights as\r\nthe old citizens. This change seems to have been effected by the\r\nplebiscite of Q. Terentius Culleo, 189, for compelling the censors to\r\nadmit to the senate the sons of free parents—undoubtedly those sons of\r\nlibertini who were born after the emancipation of the father.[2189]\r\nThe law must have involved the principle of treating such persons as\r\ncitizens optimo iure, and have therefore required their enrolment in\r\nthe country tribes, provided they owned land. As the acquisition of\r\nfull rights came only with the death of the father, which made the son\r\nsui iuris, the application of the principle must have required the\r\nenrolment of the fathers along with the sons in the rural tribes; in\r\nother words, it recognized as citizens optimo iure those libertini who\r\nhad children,[2190] on the basis of the existing custom of enlisting such\r\npersons in military service at crises.[2191] The political connections\r\nof the author of this statute leads us to interpret it as a measure of\r\nthe oligarchs for strengthening their position by the votes of their\r\ndependents.[2192]\r\n\r\nThe increasing wealth and luxury of the age naturally gave rise to\r\nsumptuary legislation; and the nobility could allow the comitia to revel\r\nin this field, devoid as it was of political significance. The first act,\r\nhowever, was to undo the Oppian law of 215[2193] through the plebiscite\r\nof M. Valerius, 195, enacted probably without a senatus consultum.[2194]\r\nIt was the senate which initiated the tribunician statute of C. Orchius,\r\n181, for limiting the number of guests at banquets.[2195] Cato opposed\r\nthe enactment of this measure on the ground that it was too easy,[2196]\r\nbut twenty years afterward he protected it from abolition.[2197] It was\r\nreinforced in 161 by the lex cibaria of the consul C. Fannius Strabo,\r\nwhich prescribed that ordinary meals should cost no more than ten asses;\r\non ten days of the month meals should cost no more than thirty; and\r\non the days of the ludi plebeii, Saturnalia, and certain other great\r\nfestivals, no more than a hundred.[2198] It also forbade the use of fowls\r\nexcepting one unfattened hen.[2199] The lex Didia cibaria, pretorian or\r\ntribunician, 143, extended the application of the Fannian statute to all\r\nItaly, and rendered liable to punishment not only the host who violated\r\nthe law but also the guests at such illegal repasts.[2200]\r\n\r\nClosely akin to sumptuary laws are those for the regulation of theatres\r\nand games. A plebiscite of Cn. Aufidius of unknown date, possibly\r\n170,[2201] permitted the importation of wild beasts from Africa for use\r\nin the circensian games. The statute repealed a senatus consultum which\r\nhad prohibited such importation.[2202] The arrangement of the social\r\nclasses in the theatre and at the games was determined partly by law. It\r\nwas the censors of 194, persuaded by Scipio Africanus the Elder,[2203]\r\nwho reserved the front seats for senators.[2204] The assignment of\r\nfourteen rows to the knights next to those of the senators was effected\r\nby a plebiscite, possibly of 146, the author of which is unknown.[2205]\r\n\r\nFor a long time the laws of the Twelve Tables administered by the\r\nmagistrates, more rarely by a special court created sometimes by the\r\nsenate but oftener and in better right during this period by the\r\npeople,[2206] sufficed for controlling crime. But as offences multiplied\r\nin consequence of the increasing complexity of life, the people were\r\ncalled upon more and more frequently to legislate on the subject.[2207]\r\nOne of the earliest may have been the lex Fabia de plagiariis,[2208]\r\nagainst the usurpation of ownership over a Roman citizen without his\r\nconsent or over his slave without the consent of the owner.[2209] The\r\ndate of its origin is unknown; but if Plautus[2210] refers to it, as\r\nVoigt asserts,[2211] it must have been in force before 197. For this\r\nand other reasons Voigt assigns it to Q. Fabius Verrucossus, consul in\r\n209.[2212] Lange prefers Q. Fabius Labeo, consul in 183,[2213] whereas\r\nMommsen places it after the Social war.[2214] A lex Gabinia threatened\r\nwith scourging and death any one who induced the people to gather in\r\nsecret meetings. It seems to belong to the time of the Bacchanalian\r\ntrouble, 186,[2215] and to have been designed against religious\r\nassociations of the kind; nevertheless the nobility found in it a means\r\nof repressing popular agitation.\r\n\r\nOn the authority of a mutilated passage in the newly found epitome of\r\nLivy an attempt has been made to assign to 149 the law of M. Scantinius\r\n(or Scatinius), probably tribune of the plebs, for imposing a fine of\r\nten thousand sesterces on any one convicted of violating a man of free\r\nbirth.[2216]\r\n\r\nThe statute which established the first standing court—quaestio\r\nperpetua—was the lex Calpurnia de repetundis of the tribune L. Calpurnius\r\nPiso Frugi, 149.[2217] His motive was undoubtedly a sincere desire to\r\nprotect Italy[2218] and the provinces from official rapacity. The court\r\nwas made up of a considerable number of jurors drawn from the senate and\r\npresided over by a praetor, who had hitherto exercised civil jurisdiction\r\nonly. In fact a trial for extortion was at first thought of as a civil\r\nsuit for the recovery of wealth illegally taken—a conception which\r\ndetermined the organization of the Calpurnian quaestio. But from time\r\nto time new standing courts were instituted each with cognizance of a\r\nspecified class of crimes, till before the end of the republic they had\r\ntaken upon themselves practically all criminal jurisdiction, retaining\r\nlittle trace of their civil origin.[2219] Between 149 and 141, for\r\ninstance, was established a standing quaestio for the trial of cases of\r\nmurder.[2220]\r\n\r\nIt was in keeping with the oligarchic tendency of the age that a consular\r\nlaw of M’. Acilius Glabrio, 191, gave the pontiffs the function of\r\ndetermining which years should be intercalary and of how many days\r\nsuch years should consist. Thus these functionaries secured the means\r\nof bringing the solar and civil years into accord; but they used their\r\nnew power mostly in the interests of their party, with the result that\r\nthe confusion in the calendar increased rather than lessened.[2221]\r\nThe nobles made their greatest gain in the control of legislation and\r\nof elections about the middle of the century through the statutes of\r\nAelius and Fufius, probably tribunes of the plebs. By granting the\r\npatrician magistrates the obnuntiatio against the tribunes, or perhaps\r\nby confirming the former in a usurped power of the kind, it enabled\r\nthe nobles to exercise a practical veto on tribunician legislation,\r\nand may for that reason be looked upon as the firmest support of the\r\nplutocracy.[2222] An article of the statute forbade the bringing of a\r\nrogation before the people in the interval between the announcement and\r\nthe holding of elective comitia.[2223]\r\n\r\nToward the close of the period a democratic movement preliminary to the\r\nrevolution began with the enactment of two important ballot laws. The\r\nfirst was the plebiscite of Q. Gabinius, 139, whom the optimates took\r\npleasure in representing as ignoble and mean.[2224] It introduced the\r\nballot in elections with a view to freeing the voter from the influence\r\nof the nobility; for many of the poor were at this time falling into\r\neconomic, and hence political, dependence on the rich.[2225] The other\r\nwas the plebiscite of L. Cassius Longinus Ravilla, 137, for extending the\r\nuse of the ballot to all trials before the people with the exception of\r\nperduellio.[2226] Cases coming under the law were those which involved\r\nfines imposed by the tribes under aedilician or tribunician presidency.\r\nProbably in the opinion of the author, a conscientious noble,[2227] cases\r\nof perduellio were too rare to need the change or too solemn to admit of\r\na disturbance of traditional usage. These measures had little immediate\r\neffect, for the nobles were as clever as the commons at exploiting\r\nthe secret ballot for partisan objects[2228]; yet the principle, when\r\ncarried to completion by the supplementary laws on the subject in the\r\nyears immediately following, contributed greatly to the success of the\r\nrevolution.[2229] Not without significance for the general trend of\r\naffairs is the circumstance that in these latter years of the completed\r\nplutocracy two dispensations were granted P. Scipio Aemilianus from\r\nlaws which had been designed to secure it against the rise of great\r\npersonalities. In 148 when he offered himself for the aedileship, being\r\nstill too young for the consulship,[2230] the people insisted on electing\r\nhim to the latter office. “When the consuls showed them the law they\r\nbecame more importunate and urged all the more, exclaiming that by the\r\nlaws handed down from Tullius and Romulus the people were judges of the\r\nelections, and of the laws pertaining thereto they could set aside or\r\nconfirm whichever they pleased.[2231] Finally one of the tribunes of\r\nthe people declared that he would take from the consuls the power of\r\nholding an election unless they yielded to the people in this matter.\r\nThen the senate allowed the tribunes to repeal this law and after one\r\nyear they reënacted it.”[2232] From this event it can be seen that when\r\nthe tribunes and people were unitedly determined upon a measure, they\r\nwere irresistible. It is evident, too, that in popular theory no laws\r\ncould prevent the citizens from having the magistrates whom they chose\r\nto elect. Again in 135 a plebiscite, authorized by a senatus consultum,\r\ngranted more speedily on this occasion though doubtless with as great\r\nregret, exempted him from the law which absolutely forbade reëlection to\r\nthe consulship.[2233] It was equally ominous that in the preceding year\r\nthe proconsulship of M. Aemilius Lepidus was abrogated, probably by an\r\nact of the comitia.[2234]\r\n\r\nAnother premonition of the revolution was the renewal of agrarian\r\nagitation, with which in a varying degree some of the more enlightened\r\nnobles sympathized. It began slowly to dawn upon them that the economic\r\nruin of the peasant class was endangering the state—a feeling which\r\nfound expression in the agrarian rogation of C. Laelius, praetor in\r\n145.[2235] The measure must have been similar to the Licinian-Sextian\r\nlaw as it threatened the interests of the rich.[2236] When he saw that\r\ntheir opposition would be such as to disturb the public peace, he\r\ndropped the proposal. If he was in truth called Sapiens because of this\r\nspeedy retreat, the epithet was too easily earned. Reform, while there\r\nwas yet time, was blocked as much by the cowardice of the well-minded\r\nas by the enormous selfishness of the majority of nobles. It was in\r\nthis time of extraordinary imperial prosperity that, in the opinion of\r\nPolybius, the constitution was successfully put to its severest test.\r\n“When these external alarms are past, and the people are enjoying their\r\ngood fortune and the fruits of their victories, and, as usually happens,\r\ngrowing corrupted by flattery and sloth, show a tendency to violence\r\nand arrogance—it is in these circumstances more than ever that the\r\nconstitution is seen to possess within itself the power of correcting\r\nabuses. For when any one of the three classes becomes puffed up, and\r\nmanifests an inclination to be contentious and unduly encroaching,\r\nthe mutual interdependence of all the three, and the possibility of\r\nthe pretensions of any one’s being curbed and thwarted by the others,\r\nmust plainly check this tendency; and so the proper equilibrium is\r\nmaintained by the impulsiveness of the one part’s being checked by its\r\nfear of the other.”[2237] These words, which we may suppose to have been\r\nwritten after the tribunate of Ti. Gracchus,[2238] accurately describe\r\nthe interplay of constitutional forces in the period of the completed\r\nplutocracy and of the incipient revolution. Controlled in some instances\r\nby self-satisfaction and the spirit of repose and in others by greed and\r\narrogance, the dominant institutions of government tended in the one\r\ncase to sluggishness and decay, in the other to violence; whereas the\r\nharmony of the constitution, or its equivalent the soundness of Roman\r\ncharacter, like a central sun, held the various institutions in the main\r\nto their respective orbits, compelling each to attend to its appropriate\r\nfunction. No retrospect of the Gracchan troubles induced the great\r\nhistorian to revise the view here expressed; for with his boundless faith\r\nin Rome he could never doubt that her constitution contained the cure of\r\nevery evil which new conditions should breed within the state.[2239]\r\n\r\n    Schulze, C.

Sempronius Gracchus,\r\nwho early in his tribunate, upon which he entered December 10, 134,\r\npromulgated his famous lex agraria. It was a repetition, with some\r\nmodifications and additions, of those articles of the Licinian-Sextian\r\nstatute which related to the same subject. The last instance of the\r\nprosecution of trespassers against the earlier law given in our imperfect\r\nrecords belongs to 193,[2241] and it must still have been in force in\r\n167 when Cato[2242] recited its terms in his “Oration in behalf of the\r\nRhodians.” Probably about the time of Flaminius the agrarian provisions\r\nof this statute were renewed with the addition of articles, (a) providing\r\nthat a specified proportion of free laborers should be employed on public\r\nlands held in possession. (b) requiring holders to take an oath to obey\r\nthe law. (c) increasing the penalty for violations.[2243]\r\n\r\nTiberius had matured his plan before entering office. Assisted by\r\nexperienced friends, among whom were P. Licinius Crassus, P. Mucius\r\nScaevola, the most eminent jurist of his generation, consul designate\r\nfor 133, and Appius Claudius Pulcher, his father-in-law, he expressed\r\nthe articles of his rogation in the most careful terms and with especial\r\nregard for vested interests.[2244] Its chief provisions were—\r\n\r\n(1) No one shall hold more than five hundred iugera of the public land,\r\nexcepting that in case the holder has sons he may occupy an additional\r\ntwo hundred and fifty iugera for each of two sons.[2245]\r\n\r\n(2) The occupier shall receive compensation for improvements on the lands\r\nwhich the law compels him to surrender.[2246]\r\n\r\n(3) The five hundred to one thousand iugera retained by the occupier\r\nshall be granted to him by the state in perpetuity and free from all\r\ndues.[2247]\r\n\r\n(4) The lands thus accruing to the state shall be divided among the\r\nneedy[2248] in lots, the maximal size of which seems to have been set at\r\nthirty iugera,[2249] to be held not as private property but as permanent,\r\nheritable leaseholds inalienable and subject to a specified rent.[2250]\r\nThe Latins and Italians are to be included among the beneficiaries of\r\nthis provision.[2251]\r\n\r\n(5) Certain specified parts of the public domain shall not be subject to\r\nassignment—the same parts which are afterward reserved from assignment by\r\nthe agrarian law of 111:[2252]\r\n\r\na. Land granted by law or by a senatorial decree to a colony, a\r\nmunicipium, or a Latin town, with the exception of any tracts of such\r\nland which this law may expressly order to be sold, assigned, or\r\nrestored.[2253] Public domain granted by a lex or a senatus consultum can\r\nbe withdrawn by the same, but the modification of a treaty requires the\r\nconsent of both parties.[2254]\r\n\r\nb. The trientabula—portions of public land granted by the government for\r\na quit rent to its creditors as security for any part of a loan.[2255]\r\n\r\nc. The ager compascuus—public land on which a specified group of\r\nneighbors have a right to pasture free of charge ten large domestic\r\nanimals—cattle, horses, mules, and asses—and a fixed number of small\r\nanimals, unknown to us on account of a lacuna in the inscription but most\r\nprobably fifty.[2256] As the unit was doubtless the individual, much of\r\nthe land of this description must have remained undivided.[2257]\r\n\r\nd. Public roads.[2258]\r\n\r\ne. Other portions of the public domain specifically designated as exempt\r\nfrom distribution, including the Campanian lands, which are leased out by\r\nthe censors.[2259]\r\n\r\nf. Certain pasture lands let out to any who wish to feed their live stock\r\nthereon, who pay a tax (scriptura) for the privilege.[2260]\r\n\r\n(6) The distribution of the lands shall be effected by a standing\r\nmagistracy elected annually by the tribes[2261]—the triumviri agris\r\ndandis adsignandis.[2262]\r\n\r\n(7) As all available public land is to be utilized in the various ways\r\ndescribed above, and as the holders of lands once public are to be\r\nguaranteed in their possession, further occupation of land is thereby\r\nprecluded.[2263]\r\n\r\nAfterward as Tiberius found it impossible to reconcile the optimates\r\nto his measure, he withdrew the second article and proposed to eject\r\nillegal holders without compensation.[2264] When the nobles induced\r\nOctavius, a colleague in the tribunate, to veto the bill, Tiberius had\r\nhim deposed by a vote of the tribes, and then passed the agrarian law\r\nwithout further opposition, unauthorized however by the senate.[2265]\r\nThe triumviri elected to take charge of the work of distribution were\r\nthe author of the law, his brother Gaius, and his father-in-law Appius\r\nClaudius Pulcher.[2266] As the election of these persons was a violation\r\nof the Licinian and Aebutian plebiscites,[2267] a dispensation was\r\nprobably granted by vote of the people.[2268] When the commission found\r\nitself hampered by legal inability to distinguish between public and\r\nprivate land, Tiberius carried a second agrarian law which invested the\r\ntriumviri with the necessary judicial power for determining what land was\r\npublic and what private.[2269] It was by virtue of this second enactment\r\nthat the word iudicandis was introduced into the phrase descriptive\r\nof their functions—“iudicandis adsignandis” or “dandis adsignandis\r\niudicandis.”[2270] In the year 129, probably at the time of the election\r\nto this office, Publius Scipio Aemilianus brought about the transfer of\r\nthe judicial function to the consuls. Appian,[2271] our sole authority\r\nfor the latter act, speaks only of its discussion in the senate, implying\r\nthat this body rather than the people passed the resolution. In that\r\ncase the senate must have annulled the second agrarian law on the ground\r\nthat it was illegally passed; for in no other way could it set aside a\r\ncomitial statute.[2272] Some land, already delimited, may still have been\r\nsubject to distribution; but as the consuls avoided the disagreeable\r\nfunction received from the commissioners, the work of assignment came\r\nspeedily to an end. The agrarian law of Ti. Gracchus fell thus into\r\ndisuse till it was revived by his brother.[2273]\r\n\r\nThe deposition of Octavius[2274] requires especial consideration. In\r\n136 the proconsular imperium had been abrogated, probably by a popular\r\nvote[2275]; but no instance of the abrogation of an actual magistracy had\r\nthus far occurred. Most scholars consider the act unconstitutional.[2276]\r\nIt did indeed involve a sweeping departure from long-established custom;\r\nbut in favor of its legality may be urged the fact that nearly all the\r\npowers ever possessed by the assembly are known to have been acquired in\r\nthe way in which Tiberius was attempting to establish for it the right\r\nto remove from office—by precedent rather than by law. A statute of the\r\nTwelve Tables declared that whatever the people voted last should be\r\nlaw and valid[2277]; and through the ages preceding the Gracchi they\r\nhad often applied this principle to the extension of their power at the\r\nexpense of the senate and magistrates. They were sovereign; and if they\r\nchose to introduce the custom of deposing a magistrate whom they regarded\r\nas the betrayer of their dearest interests, they had the legal right. The\r\nwisdom of the proceeding may be questioned, but he who has followed the\r\nhistory of the assemblies thus far must regard the measure as merely one\r\nof the many steps by which the people advanced toward the realization of\r\ntheir sovereignty.\r\n\r\nTiberius attempted to apply the same principle to securing his election\r\nto the tribunate. His motive was not a purely selfish desire to save his\r\nlife; it required no superhuman wisdom to discover that his downfall\r\nwould mean the collapse of the great reform on which he had set his\r\nheart. The continued ascendancy of a popular champion necessarily\r\ninvolved the overthrow of the senatorial government. This idea, which\r\nhe now clearly grasped, found expression in his new political platform,\r\n(1) to shorten the period of military service, (2) by means of a law of\r\nappeal to vest the supreme jurisdiction solely in the people, so as to\r\ndeprive the senate of its extra-constitutional judicial power,[2278]\r\n(3) to give the equites equal representation with the senators in the\r\njuries, or possibly as Dio Cassius states, to transfer the courts from\r\nthe senate to the knights.[2279] When the day of election came, his\r\npeasant supporters were busy with their harvests, and his platform\r\ndid not strongly appeal to the city plebs, on whom he had chiefly to\r\nrely for votes. Had the people insisted, as they twice did in favor of\r\nScipio,[2280] they would have prevailed either with or without an act\r\nof dispensation passed by the senate or by themselves[2281]; but the\r\nweakness of his supporters rather than any illegality in the proceeding\r\nproved his ruin. To free the future reformer from this limitation,\r\nhowever, a rogation of C. Papirius Carbo, tribune of the plebs in 131,\r\nproposed that a tribune should be eligible to reëlection as many times\r\nas he chose to offer himself as a candidate. This rogation failed[2282];\r\nbut before the tribunate of C. Gracchus, 123, “a certain law had already\r\nbeen enacted,” as Appian[2283] obscurely informs us, “that if a tribune\r\nshould be wanting on the announcement (of the votes), the people might\r\nelect one from the whole body of citizens.” The statute, which Appian has\r\nevidently failed to understand clearly, seems to have provided that if\r\nthe returns showed the election of only nine tribunes from the candidates\r\nproposed, the people could proceed to elect a tenth from the whole body\r\nof citizens, including the existing tribunician college; or equivalently,\r\nif for the tenth place the tribes cast a majority of votes for one who\r\nwas not a candidate, he would be considered legally elected.[2284] The\r\nobject was to enable the people to continue in office an especially\r\npopular tribune, and was therefore a notable stride in the direction of\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nPapirius was more successful with his lex tabellaria, which extended the\r\nballot to legislation, 131.[2285] Trials of perduellio alone retained the\r\noral vote. Doubtless this improvement greatly strengthened the rising\r\npopular party. A plebiscite passed about 129, requiring a knight on\r\nentering the senate to sell his public horse, deprived the senators of\r\ntheir votes in the eighteen centuries, and completed the separation of\r\nthe governing aristocracy from the commercial class begun by the Claudian\r\nstatute of 219.[2286]\r\n\r\nAt some unknown time before the tribunate of C. Gracchus a plebiscite of\r\nM. Junius modified the lex Calpurnia concerning extortion,[2287] in what\r\nway we are not informed. The act is with a high degree of probability\r\nattributed to M. Junius Pennus, tribune of the plebs in 126.[2288] If the\r\nJunian lex repetundarum was indeed his work, it could have been dictated\r\nby no sympathy with the unprivileged classes, for it was this Junius\r\nwhose plebiscite ordered the expulsion of all aliens from Rome—a measure\r\nwhich Cicero condemns as inhuman.[2289] The act last mentioned was the\r\nresponse of the senate and rabble to the effort of the more enlightened\r\nRomans to grant the citizenship to the Latins and Italians. The new idea\r\nwas embodied in a rogation of M. Fulvius Flaccus, consul in 125, which\r\noffered the citizenship, or as an alternative the right of appeal, to\r\nthe Italians, with the purpose of buying off their opposition to the\r\nSempronian agrarian law; but the measure was so vehemently opposed in the\r\nsenate that the author withdrew it.[2290] The idea however lived in the\r\nminds of the reformers till it was finally realized.\r\n\r\nTen years after the tribunate of Ti. Gracchus his brother Gaius entered\r\nupon the same office. Since the beginning of the decennium the leaders\r\nof the popular party had made various proposals but had accomplished\r\nlittle. The agrarian law was still nominally in force, though its\r\nexecution was effectually blocked. The plan of extending the franchise\r\nhad found its most bitter opponents in the men of the street, on whom\r\nthe tribunes had chiefly to depend. The ballot in legislation, the\r\npossibility of continuous reëlection to the tribunate, and the increase\r\nof discontent with the plutocracy were the only gains. Extraordinary\r\nprogress was now to be made under the leadership of a great creative\r\nstatesman. The chronological succession of his comitial enactments cannot\r\nbe determined with absolute certainty. We do not in every instance know\r\nwhether a given proposal was carried in his first or second year. This\r\nmuch, however, is clear, that most of his measures belong to 123 and to\r\nthe early part of 122. The execution of the laws, including the seventy\r\ndays’ journey to Carthage,[2291] consumed much of the second year, and\r\nafter his defeat for the third term—about July, 122—he carried no more\r\nplebiscites.[2292] Among his first thoughts was that of strengthening\r\nthe legality of the deposition of Octavius[2293] by a rogation which\r\nprovided that a person so deposed should thereby be debarred forever\r\nfrom office. He probably meant it more as an enunciation of a principle\r\nthan as a legislative project. The measure was never offered to vote,\r\nbut was withdrawn, we are told, at the request of his mother.[2294] Far\r\nmore serious, and of lasting importance, was his lex de provocatione,\r\nwhich, carrying into effect the idea of his brother,[2295] forbade the\r\nestablishment of a special court or the placing of the state under\r\nmartial law without an act of the people.[2296] Further judicial\r\nlegislation was postponed in the interest of more pressing matters.\r\n\r\nWhile colonization and the assignment of land individually to citizens,\r\nwhich Gaius planned on an extensive scale, as will soon be noticed, were\r\nto provide for the agricultural population at the expense of the state,\r\nand while the nobles and knights continued to reap an unfailing harvest\r\nof wealth in the administration of the provinces, the democratic reformer\r\ncould think it only just and expedient to subsidize the populace of the\r\ncapital. The artificial growth of Rome as a political centre, with no\r\nsound economic basis but with a most unfavorable geographical situation,\r\nrendered the problem of living difficult for the masses even in time\r\nof prosperity; and recently circumstances had so diminished the grain\r\nsupply that relief from the government seemed the only resource against\r\nthreatening famine.[2297] Before the time of the Gracchi on occasions of\r\nespecial scarcity or of especial plenty the state had sold grain at a\r\nreduced rate; and the aediles, we know not how often, had made similar\r\nreductions at their own expense.[2298] There can be no doubt, too, that\r\nindividual nobles in a private capacity often distributed free or cheap\r\ngrain among the poor to secure their support in elections. Attached by\r\nsuch means to the nobles and the senate, the rabble had been in the\r\nmain conservative. There was a certain degree of justice in giving the\r\npopulace a share in the profits of empire and some wisdom in substituting\r\nsystem for the existing irregularity. A political result, we may also\r\nsay aim, of the frumentarian plebiscite of Gaius was to disattach the\r\ncity populace from its conservative moorings and to enlist it in the\r\nservice of reform. His measure, the first frumentarian law in Roman\r\nhistory, provided for the monthly sale to every citizen who applied for\r\nit—practically to those only who resided in or near Rome—of a fixed\r\nnumber of modii of wheat at six and a third asses a modius,[2299] which\r\nwas probably about half the average market price. The law won for him\r\nthe good will of the populace,[2300] but his opponents complained that\r\nit depleted the treasury and excited the mob to seditions.[2301] It set\r\nan example for further reductions at the expense of the state. Hence\r\nnotwithstanding some good features the effect of the law was pernicious,\r\nas it tended to increase the number of idlers, to make the populace\r\nimprovident, and to encourage demagogism. It must be said, on the other\r\nhand, that had Gaius lived to carry out his wide scheme of colonization,\r\nhe would have so relieved the capital of its semi-pauper population as to\r\nrender frumentations unnecessary, whereupon the law would naturally have\r\nbeen repealed.[2302]\r\n\r\nAfter providing in the frumentarian act an expedient which, we\r\nmay believe, he looked upon as temporary, he resumed the work of\r\nconstruction[2303] by reviving his brother’s agrarian law.[2304] The\r\ncontinuance of the assignations as long as there remained any public\r\nland that could be distributed was a most essential element of his plan.\r\nAmong the articles retained were those which subjected the holders of\r\nassigned lots to a tax[2305] and exempted from distribution the Campanian\r\nterritory not set apart for his colony at Capua,[2306] as well as various\r\nother lands excepted both by the agrarian law of Tiberius and by that\r\nof 111.[2307] Doubtless it also reinvested the three commissioners with\r\njudicial power, without which they could accomplish nothing. Through\r\nthis agrarian law, or possibly through a subsequent lex viaria, the\r\ntriumviri were empowered to build roads for the accommodation of the\r\nnew peasantry.[2308] Though introducing no new principle,[2309] his\r\nlex agraria was not a simple reaffirmation of his brother’s law with\r\namendments and additions; but “a comprehensive statute, so completely\r\ncovering the ground of the earlier Sempronian law that later legislation\r\ncites the law of Gaius, not that of Tiberius Gracchus, as the authority\r\nfor the regulations which had revolutionized the tenure of the public\r\nland.”[2310]\r\n\r\nThese measures were passed before the tribunician elections of the\r\nyear,[2311] which took place as usual in midsummer.[2312] It was his\r\nfrumentarian law, together with the hope aroused by the long array of\r\npromulgated measures, which secured his reëlection. Soon afterward,\r\nthough still in 123, he brought before the comitia a rogation concerning\r\nthe qualification of iudices. As the quaestiones extraordinariae from the\r\nearliest times were made up of senators, it was natural that the standing\r\ncourts also from the time of their institution should be similarly\r\ncomposed.[2313] Under such conditions the judicial authority afforded\r\nno efficient check upon maladministration; and this immunity from the\r\nlaw, together with the temptations to the misuse of power especially in\r\nprovincial commands, tended in the course of generations to make of the\r\nsenate, with individual exceptions, a class of grand criminals. To remedy\r\nthis evil and at the same time to remove from the senate the strongest\r\nfoundation of its political power,[2314] Ti. Sempronius Gracchus had\r\nproposed his rogatio iudiciaria either for transferring the courts\r\nentirely to the knights, or more probably for making up the juries of an\r\nequal number of senators and knights.[2315] It failed to become a law;\r\nbut Gaius now took up the matter, and after experimenting unsuccessfully\r\nwith one or two projects,[2316] he finally, 122, carried a plebiscite\r\nwhich substituted knights for senators in the alba iudicum,[2317] from\r\nwhich not only standing courts but also special commissions were to\r\nbe filled.[2318] It is uncertain whether mention was made of equites\r\nor whether the result was reached merely by exclusion and definition.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the qualifications were identical with those\r\ndescribed in the extant lex repetundarum,[2319] attributed by scholars\r\nto M’. Acilius Glabrio, a colleague of Gaius, and adopted accordingly\r\nsoon after the Sempronian judiciary law. The terms of the Acilian statute\r\nexcluded tribunes of the plebs, quaestors, tresviri capitales, military\r\ntribunes of the first four legions, tresviri for assigning lands, persons\r\nwho had fought in the arena for pay or had been condemned by a quaestio\r\nor by the people. It excluded further all under thirty or over sixty\r\nyears of age, and all who had their domicile more than a mile from Rome,\r\nthe fathers, brothers, and sons of those who held the offices above\r\nenumerated, senators, and their fathers, brothers and sons, as well as\r\npersons living beyond the sea. A part of the statute missing from the\r\ninscription may have contained a minimal property qualification, which\r\ncould have been no other than four hundred thousand sesterces; or it may\r\nhave restricted jury service to those who “possess a public horse.”[2320]\r\nAccording to Plutarch Gaius was allowed the privilege of selecting\r\nthe jurors. Had he remained in power and continued in this function,\r\nhe doubtless could have compelled the courts of his choosing to do\r\njustice. But the privilege seems to have been restricted to the first\r\nlist; thereafter, as provided by the lex repetundarum of Acilius the\r\npraetor qui inter peregrinos ius dicit was to attend to the matter.[2321]\r\nThe relation between the Sempronian lex iudiciaria and the lex Acilia\r\nrepetundarum has not been precisely determined.[2322] If the Sempronian\r\nstatute preceded the Acilian,[2323] as is not unlikely, it was the\r\nintention of Gaius to pass a general law regarding the qualifications\r\nand mode of appointment of jurors, to be superseded in large part by a\r\nsuccession of laws, which dealing with individual courts, should regulate\r\nthe qualification and appointment of their several juries as well as the\r\nprocedure and the penalties. This policy indicates a conviction that he\r\ncould give the reformed judicial system greater stability by making the\r\nseparate laws here referred to entirely independent of his original lex\r\niudiciaria.[2324]\r\n\r\nThe lex Acilia, described above as a plebiscite of M’. Acilius Glabrio,\r\ncolleague of C. Gracchus in 122,[2325] took the place of the lex\r\nIunia of 126,[2326] and is to be identified with a lex repetundarum\r\nextensive fragments of which are preserved in an inscription.[2327]\r\nWhereas earlier laws on the subject rendered governors of provinces, and\r\nperhaps administrative officers in Italy, alone liable to punishment,\r\nthe Acilian statute includes magistrates and senators and the sons of\r\nboth as well as the holders of promagisterial imperium.[2328] The crime\r\nconsists in taking in any one year from those whom the law is designed\r\nto protect—from the allies, Latins, provincials, and exterior nations\r\nunder the sway or in the friendship of the Roman people[2329]—by gift,\r\nseizure, compulsion, or other illegal means money or property exceeding\r\na specified sum, which a lacuna in the inscription leaves unknown,\r\nbut which is supposed to be four thousand sesterces.[2330] Holders of\r\nmagistracies and imperia cannot be brought to trial for the crime till\r\nafter the expiration of their terms,[2331] on the general principle which\r\nexempts from prosecution those who are engaged in the service of the\r\nstate.[2332] The praetor qui inter peregrinos ius dicit within ten days\r\nafter the passage of the statute, and in future within ten days after\r\nentering upon his office, is to choose for this court four hundred and\r\nfifty persons with the qualifications for jury service described above in\r\nconnection with the Sempronian judiciary law. From this group the accused\r\nis to reject under oath his kinsmen within a specified degree and his\r\nsodales. The accuser is to draw from the remainder a hundred persons,\r\ntaking oath that he has chosen no kinsman within a specified degree or\r\nsodalis. The accused rejects fifty of the hundred, and the remaining\r\nfifty constitute the jury for trying the case.[2333] The rules of\r\nprocedure in the trial and the amount of liability of the accused in the\r\nevent of conviction are given. The accuser, if an alien, is granted as\r\na reward for a successful prosecution the Roman citizenship for himself\r\nand his born sons and grandsons. If he is a Latin and does not want the\r\ncitizenship, he is given instead the right of appeal.[2334] Probably the\r\nlaw contained provisions for the punishment of corruption in the patrons\r\nof the accusers and in the praetor and jurors.[2335]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Gaius carried a law also for reconstituting the\r\nquaestio inter sicarios et veneficos,[2336] which had originally been\r\nestablished shortly before 141.[2337] The Sempronian law on this subject\r\ncontained a provision for the punishment of bribery or conspiracy\r\ncommitted in trials of the kind. The article referred to included the\r\nwords “Ne quis iudicio circumveniretur,”[2338] a principle repeated as\r\n“Qui coisset, quo quis condemnaretur”[2339] in the corresponding article\r\nof the Cornelian law which superseded the Sempronian. There was no\r\nquaestio for dealing especially with judicial corruption and conspiracy,\r\nbut the accused was brought to trial before the very court in relation to\r\nwhich his crime was alleged to have been committed.[2340] The provision\r\nwas directed against the accuser, against magistrates and senators who\r\npresided over such courts, and presumably against equestrian jurors who\r\naccepted bribes.[2341]\r\n\r\nWe have in an inscription the concluding articles of a criminal law[2342]\r\nof this period. It is on a bronze tablet found on the site of the ancient\r\nItalian city Bantia, and is called the Latin Lex Bantina to distinguish\r\nit from another lex in Oscan on the opposite face.[2343] A reference\r\nto the triumviri agris dandis adsignandis, who seem to have been those\r\nelected under the Sempronian agrarian law, places the document between\r\n133 and 118. It is concerned with a quaestio.[2344] An attempt has been\r\nmade to identify it with the lex Iunia repetundarum and to assign it\r\naccordingly to 126.[2345] The circumstance, however, that it was passed\r\nwithout the authorization of the senate, and that its whole spirit is\r\nanti-senatorial, would lead us rather to the conclusion that it was the\r\nwork of C. Gracchus at the time of his most bitter struggle with the\r\noptimates yet before he had lost control of the comitia. The fragment\r\ncontains no more than the sanctio—provisions for enforcement of the\r\nstatute. The beginning of the first extant article is lost, but it must\r\nhave described the class of offenders to which the article applies, and\r\nthe nature of the offence. It speaks merely of disabilities imposed on\r\nthe offender, among which are the following: he must not address the\r\nsenate or vote in a public trial (poplico ioudicio) or in comitia or\r\nreceive or give testimony in court or wear the praetexta and soleae in\r\npublic or be chosen into the senate or remain in it if already a member.\r\nThe second article provides that if a tribune of the plebs, a quaestor, a\r\ntriumvir capitalis, a triumvir for assigning lands, or a index appointed\r\nunder the law itself, or a senator shall with knowledge and malice\r\nprepense violate the law or hinder its operation, he shall be liable to\r\na fine, the amount of which a lacuna in the text leaves unknown. The\r\nthird article provides that a consul, praetor, aedile, tribune of the\r\nplebs, quaestor, triumvir capitalis, or triumvir for the assignment of\r\nlands now in office shall, within the next five days after ascertaining\r\nthat the law has been enacted, swear in the manner described below: also\r\nthat the dictator, consul, praetor, master of horse, censor, aedile,\r\nand other officials as above enumerated, and the index appointed under\r\nthis law shall in future take the oath within five days after entering\r\nupon their magistracies or imperia. They shall give oath to the urban\r\nquaestor publicly in front of the temple of Castor, swearing by Jupiter\r\nand the di Penates that they will do as the law requires and will not\r\nwith knowledge and malice prepense violate the law or by intercession or\r\notherwise hinder its administration. He who fails to swear shall not be\r\ncandidate for a magistracy or imperium, or manage or retain either, or\r\naddress the senate or be chosen into it; and the quaestor shall keep a\r\nlist of those who have taken the oath. The fourth article provides that\r\nwhoever is or shall be a senator, or shall have the right of addressing\r\nthe senate after this law has been passed, shall within the next ten\r\ndays after ascertaining the fact of its enactment take an oath like that\r\ndescribed in article 3. The penalty for failure to swear is not mentioned\r\nin the extant fragment, but must at the mildest have been expulsion from\r\nthe senate.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the transfer of the iudicia from the senators to\r\nthe knights is the statute of Gaius concerning the taxation of Asia. It\r\nordered the censors to let out the taxes of this province to the highest\r\nbidders; and it limited the right of the senate to lessen the sum agreed\r\nupon.[2346] Under such an arrangement, however, no sufficient guarantee\r\ncould be provided for the security of the provincials from publican\r\nexactions.[2347] The political result of this legislation in favor of\r\nthe knights was to invest them not only with an important share in the\r\nadministration, but through the courts with a superiority even over the\r\nsenate.[2348] The opposition of the poorer class to the aristocracy could\r\nnever be otherwise than uncertain and fitful; but the knights with their\r\nimmense wealth and their efficient organization were to be henceforth\r\nan ever present rival of the senate. The author of the law had given\r\nthe state a double head,[2349] which was to prove the source of civil\r\ndiscord; or nearly in his own words, he had thrust into the body of the\r\nsenate a sword which nothing could withdraw.[2350] For a few months their\r\nbenefactor may have cherished the delusion that he could depend upon\r\ntheir grateful support; he lived to discover that they cared not for him\r\nor his reforms but only for their immediate interests. In his work of\r\nconstruction the statesman found them slightly more serviceable than the\r\nproletariate.\r\n\r\nThe right which the senate had hitherto possessed of assigning the\r\nprovinces to the magistrates and promagistrates according to its pleasure\r\ngave a great opportunity for favoritism and partisanship; it could thwart\r\nthe will of the people by assigning a popular consul to an insignificant\r\nprovince. To deprive the senate of a power which could be so easily\r\nperverted to wrong use, C. Gracchus proposed and carried an act which\r\nordered the senate before the election to name the provinces that were to\r\nbe consular.[2351] An article forbade tribunician intercession against\r\nsuch action of the senate.[2352] Far from improving the administration,\r\nhowever, this statute tended to foster that routine which was one of the\r\nmost marked defects of oligarchic rule.[2353]\r\n\r\nAs under the government of the nobility military affairs were in the\r\nhands of the magistrates and senate, this field was closed to comitial\r\nlegislation.[2354] One of the most notable indications of growing\r\ndemocracy was the project of Ti. Gracchus, 133, for shortening the period\r\nof service. It was not brought to vote;[2355] but his brother Gaius\r\nsucceeded in passing a plebiscite, 123, which ordered that the state\r\nshould bear the cost of clothing soldiers, and forbade the enlistment\r\nof boys before the close of their seventeenth year.[2356] The pay of\r\nthe soldiers, which since the war with Hannibal had remained five and a\r\nthird asses a day, had under new conditions become wholly inadequate;\r\nand certainly insistence on the legal age limitation was prudent as well\r\nas humane. There is no ground, then, for imagining with Diodorus[2357]\r\nthat in this salutary measure Gaius was catering for the support of the\r\nsoldiers by inciting them to disobedience and lawlessness.\r\n\r\nHis greatest constructive work he aimed to achieve through colonization\r\nand through the extension of the franchise. His colonial law, 123,\r\nproposed to establish many settlements in Italy,[2358] two of which at\r\nleast should be made up of men of the best character, not the neediest\r\nbut traders and workmen of moderate means.[2359] The two actually founded\r\nwere Scolacium and Neptunia,[2360] both in situations favorable for\r\ncommerce. Several other settlements in Italy are attributed to his\r\ncolonial or agrarian statute.[2361] As his colonies were exclusively\r\ncitizen,[2362] if any aliens took part, they must by virtue of the\r\ncolonial law have obtained the Roman rights. The statute of his colleague\r\nRubrius the same year (123) provided for the founding of Junonia on the\r\nsite of Carthage.[2363] But the most liberal and statesmanlike measure\r\nwas reserved for his second tribunate, 122. It was a proposal to grant\r\nfull citizenship to the Latins and the ius Latii to the remaining\r\nallies.[2364] The rejection of the bill by a popular vote proved the\r\nleader far too liberal and too progressive for his supporters. Deceived\r\nby the spurious proposals of M. Livius Drusus,[2365] a colleague of\r\nGaius, for the founding of twelve colonies, the members of which\r\nwere to hold their lots by fee simple and consequently exempt from\r\nrents, and for depriving the Roman magistrates of the right to inflict\r\ncorporal punishment on Latins even when in military service under their\r\ncommands,[2366] the populace, readily accepting the new proposals,[2367]\r\nturned against their true champion, and defeated him in the election\r\nfor the tribunate for the ensuing year.[2368] It was probably the same\r\nmeasure of Gaius for extending the citizenship which alienated from him\r\nthe equites, who in every crisis pursued their own selfish ends.[2369] In\r\nthe ensuing struggle between the senate and Gaius they took the side of\r\nthe former.[2370]\r\n\r\nIn the tribunate of Gaius Gracchus the life of the comitia reached the\r\nhighest point of intensity. The two years of his administration afford\r\nevidence of what the assembly could accomplish when directed by the\r\npersonality of a great statesman.[2371] The sum total of the measures\r\nadopted should be estimated not as a completed work, but as a foundation\r\nto be strengthened at defective points and to be built upon till the\r\nwhole structure of the state and empire should be reconstituted and\r\nfreshly vitalized. These results might have been achieved, had Gaius\r\nlived out his natural life and retained the support of the populace\r\nand the knights.[2372] His failure proved the comitia a weak, unsafe\r\ninstrument for constructive statesmanship.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Aristocratic Reaction and the Popular Recovery_\r\n\r\n122-103\r\n\r\nThe optimates waited only for the expiration of the tribunate of Gaius\r\nGracchus to begin undoing his work, and they found the comitia ready to\r\naid in the demolition. In 121 a plebiscite of M. Minucius Rufus repealed\r\nthe Rubrian law for the colonization of Junonia (Carthage).[2373] Soon\r\nafterward, certainly not later than 118, a plebiscite, whose author is\r\nunknown, permitted the beneficiaries of the Sempronian agrarian laws to\r\nsell the lots they had received.[2374] This enactment was followed in 118\r\nby a plebiscite which Appian[2375] assigns to Spurius Borius (?), a name\r\nnot otherwise known.[2376] It put an end to the distributions, and must\r\ntherefore have abolished the agrarian triumvirate. The same law confirmed\r\nall holders of the ager publicus in their possession, without converting\r\nany of this land into private property, and it continued the imposition\r\nof rents. We may assume that the lands here referred to included those\r\nrecently distributed in small lots as well as those retained by the\r\noccupiers. Lastly it enacted that the revenues accruing from the rents\r\nshould be used for distributions—probably of cheap grain.[2377] In 111\r\nanother tribune, whom Cicero[2378] names Sp. Thorius, through a law which\r\nhas partially survived in an inscription, aimed to settle definitely and\r\nfor all time in the interest of the nobles the questions raised by the\r\nSempronian agrarian legislation.\r\n\r\nI. This epigraphic lex agraria converts into private property the\r\nfollowing classes of lands.[2379]\r\n\r\n(1) Land assigned to a colony or in any way made public, and afterward\r\nrestored to the original owners (domneis). It is to be private optuma\r\nlege.[2380]\r\n\r\n(2) Land assigned to a colony and afterward restored to its former\r\noccupier (veteri possessori).[2381]\r\n\r\n(3) Land within the legal limit (of five hundred iugera) left to the\r\noccupier by the three commissioners.[2382]\r\n\r\n(4) Land assigned after 133 to colonies of Roman citizens.[2383]\r\n\r\n(5) Land given and assigned by the three commissioners after 133.[2384]\r\n\r\n(6) Land which has been occupied after 133 (not assigned by the\r\ncommissioners) to the extent of not more than thirty iugera to the\r\noccupier.[2385]\r\n\r\n(7) Land which by the provision of this law is to be sold, granted, or\r\nrestored.[2386]\r\n\r\nAll the lands above enumerated are declared private and free from\r\nvectigal and scriptura.[2387]\r\n\r\nII. The lands which the law declares public are those reserved from\r\ndistribution by the law of Ti. Gracchus.[2388] It retains further as\r\npublic all lands along public roads which have been granted by the\r\ncommissioners on condition that the recipients (viasieis vicaneis) in\r\nreturn for the use of the land undertake the duty of keeping the roads in\r\nrepair. Though heritable and alienable, they remain subject to the burden\r\nhere described.[2389]\r\n\r\nIII. In the regulation of the agrarian conditions of Africa the statute\r\ndeals with three kinds of land, (1) private ex iure quiritium,[2390] (2)\r\nprivate ex iure peregrino,[2391] (3) public domain of the Roman people\r\nof various sub-classes.[2392] Lastly the statute aims to settle the\r\nstatus of the lands of Corinth.[2393] As regards the Latins and aliens,\r\nwhatever has already been permitted them by treaty or law is allowed them\r\nby this statute, provided the same thing is allowed a Roman citizen; but\r\nit is forbidden them if forbidden a citizen. Rights granted the citizens\r\nwhich up to this time are not enjoyed by aliens are not by this law\r\ncommunicated to aliens.[2394]\r\n\r\nThrough this series of reactionary laws, from the Minucian (121) to the\r\nThorian (111), the optimates succeeded in nullifying the good results of\r\nthe Sempronian agrarian reforms. It was while the Minucian rogation[2395]\r\nwas under discussion that the senate took advantage of a disturbance\r\nin the concilium to arm the consul Opimius with absolute power for\r\nputting down C. Gracchus and his followers.[2396] The failure of an\r\nattempt in the following year (120) to call Opimius to account for these\r\nproceedings established the right of the senate to the appointment of\r\nspecial commissions and to the decretum ultimum[2397]—a right on which\r\nthe optimates continued to insist to the end of the republic. Through\r\nthe plebiscite of L. Calpurnius Bestia (also 120)[2398] they put the\r\nstamp of legitimacy upon the murder of the followers of Ti. Gracchus by\r\nrecalling from exile P. Popillius Laenas, who as consul in 132 and head\r\nof a special court was chiefly responsible for that judicial crime.[2399]\r\nAn attempt was made by Q. Servilius Caepio, consul in 106, to restore\r\nthe courts to the senate,[2400] or possibly to compromise by providing\r\nfor an album composed of both senators and equites.[2401] The sources\r\nimply that the measure was accepted by the comitia; but if so, it must\r\nhave been immediately annulled, as it was not carried into effect.[2402]\r\nWithin this period of reaction, and perhaps as a part of it, falls the\r\nlex de libertinorum suffragiis of the consul M. Aemilius Scaurus, 115.\r\nAlthough nothing certain is known of it, we may suppose that it attempted\r\nagain[2403] to restrict the libertini to the four city tribes.[2404]\r\nAbout this time, too, several acts seem to have been passed for\r\ndiminishing the pay of soldiers, probably undoing the Sempronian law on\r\nthe subject.[2405]\r\n\r\nA glance at these reactionary measures alone would leave the impression\r\nthat the senate was recovering its entire supremacy. This result might\r\nhave been reached had it not been on the one hand for the lasting\r\ninspiration of the Gracchan spirit in the plebs and their leaders, and\r\non the other the new position of the equites. In 119 C. Marius, at once\r\na representative of the knights[2406] and of the peasants, opposed as\r\ntribune of the plebs the senatorial aristocracy, which now had to depend\r\nfor immediate support upon the populace.[2407] The optimates had greatly\r\nimpaired the value of the secret ballot through the custodes tabellarum,\r\nwho stood on the pontes as well as by the boxes (cistae) to keep watch\r\nover the voting. They were often influential men[2408]—in elections\r\nselected by the candidates[2409]—who used their influence with the\r\nvoters, especially of the principium or of the prerogative century,[2410]\r\nthereby maintaining for the aristocrats a high degree of control over the\r\ncomitia in spite of the ballot laws.[2411] For this reason C. Marius when\r\ntribune of the plebs carried an act for making the pontes narrower that\r\nthere might be room on them for the voters only.[2412] The politicians,\r\nhowever, soon found means of circumventing this law as well as the use\r\nof the ballot.[2413] The populares could expect little therefore from the\r\nplebiscite of C. Caelius, 107, which by extending the ballot to trials of\r\nperduellio, completed the abolition of oral voting in the comitia.[2414]\r\n\r\nWe find another sign of popular recovery in the assembly’s resumption of\r\nthe appointment of special judiciary commissions.[2415] One of the most\r\nremarkable courts of the kind was that created in 113 for the trial of\r\nthree Vestal virgins on a charge of incest. The pontifex maximus, who\r\npossessed absolute authority over the Vestals, had already pronounced\r\njudgment, condemning one and acquitting the other two, when a plebiscite\r\nof Sex. Peducaeus, taking the case out of his hands, transferred it\r\nto a quaestio extraordinaria.[2416] To such an extent did the tribune\r\napply the theory of popular sovereignty.[2417] The plebiscite of C.\r\nMamilius, 109, ordered the appointment of a court for the detection and\r\npunishment of those who had accepted money from Jugurtha for aid rendered\r\nhim against the decrees of the senate and the interests of Rome. As it\r\nwas a blow aimed at the nobility, the people in the hatred they then\r\ncherished against the governing class voted it with great spirit.[2418]\r\nIn 105 the tribal comitia abrogated the proconsular imperium of Q.\r\nServilius Caepio,[2419] and in the following year, they not only\r\nappointed a special court to try him for embezzlement of the gold found\r\nat Tolosa,[2420] but through the plebiscite of L. Cassius Longinus, they\r\ndisqualified for membership of the senate any person whom the people\r\nhad judicially condemned or whose imperium they had abrogated.[2421]\r\nThese acts confirmed and applied the principles underlying the deposition\r\nof Octavius and the rogation of C. Gracchus concerning persons deposed\r\nfrom office (abacti). In theory the people indirectly chose the senators\r\nthrough their function of electing magistrates; and they were only\r\nclaiming this right when they insisted that he should be prohibited from\r\nmembership whom they had condemned in either of the two ways described\r\nby the statute. It must have seemed to the people, on the other hand,\r\nthat the tribunes, who were once more their true representatives, had\r\nas good a right as any other magistrates to seats in the senate. This\r\nfeeling found expression in the Atinian plebiscite, enacted between 122\r\nand 102,[2422] which gave the tribunes the ius sententiae dicendae in the\r\nsenate with the same right to censorial enrolment as that enjoyed by the\r\ncurule magistrates.[2423]\r\n\r\nThe growing strength of the people and at the same time the increasing\r\ndependence of the optimates on religion for the control of politics are\r\nindicated by a law of 103 concerning the election of sacerdotes. More\r\nthan a hundred years earlier[2424] was instituted the custom of electing\r\nthe supreme pontiff and the chief curio in comitia of seventeen tribes\r\ndesignated by lot. Toward the end of the plutocratic régime C. Licinius\r\nCrassus in the interest of the people attempted in vain to pass a law\r\nfor extending the principle to all the members of the more important\r\nsacerdotal colleges.[2425] The proposal was defeated by the eloquence of\r\nC. Laelius,[2426] but at length it was passed as the lex de sacerdotiis\r\nof Cn. Domitius, tribune of the plebs in 103. The statute affected the\r\npontifical and augural colleges, the decemviri sacris faciundis, and the\r\nepulones.[2427] According to the new arrangement when a place became\r\nvacant in any one of these colleges, the members of the college drew up\r\na list of eligible candidates from whom the comitia sacerdotum, composed\r\nas above described, made a choice.[2428] In spite of this law religion\r\nremained a political tool of the optimates.\r\n\r\nMeantime the popular party succeeded in enacting economic laws. A\r\nPorcian statute concerning interest, which may well have aimed to\r\nbenefit the poor, seems to be the work of M. Porcius Cato, consul in\r\n118. The author had to defend the act against several attempts to repeal\r\nit.[2429] In 109 under the stress of the Cimbric war the consul M.\r\nJunius Silanus passed an act for repealing several earlier laws which\r\nhad diminished the pay of soldiers. We may reasonably believe that it\r\nrestored the Sempronian law on the subject.[2430] His immediate object\r\nwas to encourage enlistments.[2431] An agrarian rogation was offered by\r\nL. Marcius Philipus, tribune of the plebs in 104. As the author was at\r\nheart a democrat, his measure was doubtless inspired with the spirit\r\nof the Gracchi. Perhaps it aimed to restore their law; but lacking\r\ndetermination, the proposer readily allowed it to be voted down.[2432]\r\nThe monetary lex Clodia, which probably belongs to the same year, has no\r\npolitical significance.[2433]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Appuleian Legislation and the Rule of the Moderate Optimates_\r\n\r\n103-88\r\n\r\nThrough the legislative acts above described we can trace the speedy\r\nrestoration of the democracy and of comitial legislative power after\r\nthe overthrow of C. Sempronius Gracchus. We are now approaching a\r\nsecond crisis in which the aristocracy had to struggle for existence.\r\nAgainst it was formed a combination of three powerful men, C. Marius,\r\nsupported by the knights and the municipes,[2434] C. Servilius Glaucia,\r\nand L. Appuleius Saturninus. It is almost certain that this Servilius\r\nis to be identified with the author of the lex repetundarum of 111\r\nor thereabout, probably a plebiscite, which repealed the Acilian law\r\non the same subject.[2435] In important respects his statute was an\r\nimprovement on earlier regulations of the crime. “Glaucia’s alteration\r\nin procedure was thorough and permanent. He introduced the system of the\r\n‘second hearing’—an obligatory renewal of the trial, which rendered it\r\npossible for counsel to discuss evidence which had already been given,\r\nand for jurors to get a grasp of the mass of scattered data which had\r\nbeen presented to their notice[2436]—and he also made it possible to\r\nrecover damages, not only from the chief malefactor, but from all who\r\nhad dishonestly shared his spoils.”[2437] These principles were taken up\r\ninto the Cornelian law which superseded it in 81.[2438] The circumstance\r\nthat the man whom the optimates regarded as merely a vulgar demagogue\r\nwas the author of so statesmanlike a measure ought to militate against\r\ntheir opinion, not only of him, but also of his associates. He, too,\r\nrepresented the knights,[2439] whereas Appuleius was a champion of the\r\nrural plebs against the senate and the populace. As tribune of the\r\nplebs in 103 the latter proposed a law for the assignment of lands in\r\nthe province of Africa to the retiring veterans of Marius in lots of a\r\nhundred iugera each. When Baebius, a colleague, interceded, the people\r\npelted him with stones and drove him from the assembly. Thus the law\r\nwas violently carried, but we hear nothing more of it. Probably it was\r\nnot enforced.[2440] This act marks an epoch in the history of Roman\r\ncolonization; through it the government first expressed its intention to\r\nprovide discharged soldiers with farms, a departure made necessary by the\r\nMarian policy of filling the army with capite censi.[2441] Either to this\r\ntribunate or more probably to his second belongs the lex de maiestate\r\n(minuta),[2442] the first of the kind in Roman history. It defined the\r\ncrime and made general provisions for the prosecution of those who were\r\naccused of it.[2443] The same statute provided for the establishment of a\r\ncourt which seems to have been standing rather than special.[2444]\r\n\r\nIn his second tribunate, 100, supported by Marius, consul a sixth time,\r\nand by Servilius, Appuleius proposed and carried a law for the founding\r\nof settlements of the Marian veterans in Sicily, Corsica, Achaia, and\r\nMacedonia.[2445] Marius was to be a commissioner for conducting these\r\ncolonies, and was to have the right to enroll as citizens in each\r\nsettlement a specified number of aliens.[2446] The object of the latter\r\nclause was doubtless to provide for the Italian veterans in his army.\r\nHe proposed further that certain Transpadane lands which the Cimbri had\r\ntaken from the Gauls and which Marius had recovered should be distributed\r\namong the citizens and the Italians.[2447] Another proposal was for the\r\nmonthly sale of a specified number of modii of grain to every citizen\r\nresident of Rome who desired it at five-sixths of an as to the modius—a\r\nmerely nominal price.[2448] It is not known whether the colonial,\r\nagrarian, and frumentarian measures were separate enactments or articles\r\nof one statute; or the colonial and agrarian provisions may alone have\r\nbeen combined. However that may be, we are informed by Appian[2449]\r\nthat attached to the agrarian measure—whether to the others also is\r\nnowhere stated—was an article which provided that if the bill should\r\nbecome a law, the senators within five days should swear to uphold it,\r\nor if any senator refused to take the oath, he should be expelled from\r\nthe senate and should be liable to a fine of twenty talents, the Greek\r\nequivalent of about five hundred thousand sesterces.[2450] The rural\r\nplebs, including many discharged soldiers of Marius, swarmed into the\r\ncomitia at the call of the tribune and violently passed the law. Marius,\r\nwho as a consul and a knight disapproved of such illegality, set for\r\nthe senators the example of swearing to the law, “in so far as it was a\r\nlaw,” which left them a loophole of escape from its provisions should\r\nthey afterward so determine. Metellus, who alone of the senators refused\r\nthe oath, was forced into exile and an interdict from fire and water\r\nwas passed against him by the tribes on the motion of Saturninus.[2451]\r\nSoon afterward an election riot gave the senate a pretext for martial\r\nlaw. Placed under custody, Saturninus and some fellow officials were\r\nstoned to death by a mob. His measures were then annulled by the senate\r\non the ground that they had been violently passed;[2452] nevertheless\r\nMariana was founded by Marius in Corsica, apparently under the colonial\r\nprovision.[2453] The import of the agrarian law of Sex. Titius, tribune\r\nof the plebs in 99, is unknown.[2454] It may have been merely a\r\nreënactment of the Appuleian measure. At all events before it could be\r\nput into force it was annulled by the senate on the ground that it had\r\nbeen passed by violence and against the intercession of colleagues.[2455]\r\n\r\nThe optimates, having again triumphed over the democracy, adopted a\r\npolicy of moderation. Their consuls of 98, Q. Caecilius Metellus and T.\r\nDidius, attempted by a mild statute to check the most flagrant abuses\r\nof tribunician legislation, (1) the combination of various dissimilar\r\nprovisions in one bill (lex satura) for the purpose of drawing the\r\nvotes of all parties, (2) the passing of bills through the assembly\r\nby surprise. Their law accordingly, reviving usages once in force but\r\nrecently neglected, forbade such combinations[2456] and ordered that the\r\npromulgation should precede the voting by at least a trinum nundinum—an\r\ninterval which included three market days.[2457] Similarly in 95 their\r\nconsuls, L. Licinius Crassus and Q. Mucius Scaevola, aimed by an equally\r\nmoderate law to check the usurpation of the citizenship on the part of\r\naliens. It forbade peregrini to perform the functions of citizens, though\r\nit did not order the innocent among them to leave Rome.[2458] It provided\r\nfor the appointment of a special commission to discover and punish\r\nusurpers of the citizenship.[2459] Those found guilty were sent back to\r\ntheir communities.[2460] Though the authors were eminent in justice and\r\ncherished the best intentions, their law proved to be not merely useless\r\nbut most pernicious to the state,[2461] as it helped drive the Italians\r\nto revolt.[2462]\r\n\r\nThe next attempt at reform proceeded from the inmost circle of the\r\naristocracy.[2463] M. Livius Drusus, tribune of the plebs in 91, was a\r\nman of the highest nobility, wealthy, eloquent, and upright at heart,\r\nthe son of that Livius who had opposed C. Gracchus.[2464] Regarding his\r\naims and the quality of his statesmanship conflicting opinions have\r\nbeen expressed by modern scholars. The sources intimate that he wished\r\nprimarily to strengthen the senate by breaking away from its hide-bound\r\nconservatism and undertaking various pressing reforms. His agrarian\r\nmeasure was conceived in the Gracchan spirit but was more radical.[2465]\r\nAppian[2466] states that it proposed the founding of colonies voted long\r\nago but not yet established. Reference must be to the twelve colonies\r\nplanned by his father.[2467] It probably abolished the statute of 111\r\nand ordered the division not only of the Campanian lands,[2468] but also\r\nof those public domains which were held by the allied communities—in\r\nbrief, of all the public land remaining in Italy and Sicily;[2469] and it\r\nestablished a board of ten for making the assignments.[2470] Livy[2471]\r\nattributes to the author a frumentarian proposal, though we are not\r\ninformed of its character. The aim must have been to win the support of\r\nthe populace for his other measures.[2472]\r\n\r\nHe further proposed to mix with the silver coinage an eighth part of\r\ncopper,[2473] the proceeds of this gain to be applied perhaps to the\r\nexecution of his frumentarian project.[2474] There is much controversy\r\nas to the intent of his judiciary reform. Appian[2475] supposes that\r\nhe wished to add three hundred knights to the senate and to draw the\r\njurors from that body thus enlarged. Velleius[2476] is of the opinion\r\nthat his aim was to transfer the iudicia to the senate; whereas the\r\nepitomator of Livy[2477] directly states that he provided for making up\r\nthe iudicia of senators and knights in equal numbers. We may partially\r\nreconcile these conflicting statements by supposing that he planned to\r\ncompose the jurors’ album of six hundred senators and knights in equal\r\nnumbers, by which expedient he hoped to bring these two hostile orders\r\nback to their former harmony,[2478] while serving the interests of the\r\nsenate and ridding the state of the corrupt and tyrannical rule of the\r\nknights.[2479] By a special article of the rogation a quaestio, probably\r\nperpetua, was to be appointed to inquire into the cases of bribery\r\nof jurors and to punish the guilty.[2480] His most radical measure,\r\nintroduced after opposition to his other reforms began to develop,[2481]\r\nwas for extending the citizenship to the Latins[2482] and to all the\r\nItalians.[2483] This group of proposals, designed for the benefit of\r\nall parties, proved distasteful to all. The senators found a ground\r\nfor complaint in the circumstance that the knights would have equal\r\npower with them in the courts; the knights were unwilling to surrender\r\ntheir judicial control or to grant the franchise to the Italians; the\r\nwealthy Italians feared they might lose the public lands which they\r\nstill held. Only the poor among the Romans and allies supported the\r\nproposal in the hope of profiting by the distribution of lands.[2484] The\r\nagrarian, frumentarian, monetary, and judiciary measures were combined\r\nin one statute, and passed with violence[2485] and contrary to the\r\nomens.[2486] On these grounds and furthermore because they violated the\r\narticle of the Caecilian-Didian statute forbidding the passing of a lex\r\nsatura, they were annulled by the senate.[2487] Although Drusus might\r\nhave interposed his veto against this decree, he preferred rather to\r\ndisregard it, most probably on the theory that the senatorial authority\r\ndid not avail against the sovereign will of the people.[2488] Aware that\r\nhis intercession would but postpone the annulment to another year, he\r\ncontented himself with informing his opponents that his measures were\r\nabsolutely necessary for the security of the state, and that those who\r\noffended against them did it at their peril. He proceeded to carry\r\nhis statute into immediate effect.[2489] A plebiscite of Saufeius, a\r\ncolleague, established a commission of five in addition to the ten\r\nprovided for by the Livian statute; and Livius was elected a member of\r\nboth commissions.[2490] After his murder the Livian and Saufeian statutes\r\nwere both considered null and void.[2491]\r\n\r\nThe lex Remmia de calumniatoribus, which was enacted before 80, may\r\nbelong to the year of the Livian attempt at reform, 91;[2492] and in\r\nthat case it would be most natural to regard it as a piece of counter\r\nlegislation to offset the proposal for establishing a court for the trial\r\nof jurors accused of bribery. The complainant who was proved malicious it\r\nrendered liable to trial and punishment with the loss of citizenship and\r\nthe branding of his forehead with the letter K (for Kalumniator).[2493]\r\nThis we may believe was the defiance offered by the knights to those who\r\nwere attempting to bring them to account for their conduct as judges.\r\nExulting in their victory over Drusus, they expressed their antipathy to\r\nthe Italian movement in a lex de maiestate of Q. Varius, tribune of the\r\nplebs in 90. They stood round the Rostra with drawn daggers and forced it\r\nthrough the comitia in spite of tribunician intercession. It supplanted\r\nthe Appuleian law on the subject by a severe provision against those\r\nwho encouraged the Italians to demand the citizenship or in any way to\r\nconspire or to revolt against the Roman people. It must have contained an\r\narticle, too, concerning seditions.[2494] The court which it established\r\nwas to sit on all ordinary dies fasti, undisturbed by iustitia,[2495] and\r\nwas to be a quaestio perpetua.[2496] Now that two attempts, the Appuleian\r\nand the Livian, to substitute more popular measures for the Sempronian\r\nfrumentarian law had failed, the optimates found themselves strong\r\nenough to supersede the Sempronian act by one less popular. This was the\r\nOctavian law,[2497] the contents of which are unknown, but which received\r\nthe praise of Cicero for its moderation.[2498]\r\n\r\nThe Social War, following close upon the murder of Livius Drusus,\r\ncompelled the Romans to grant the citizenship to the Italians. This\r\nresult was brought about by a succession of statutes. A law of the consul\r\nL. Julius Caesar, 90, bestowed the citizenship upon the Latins[2499]\r\nand on all the Italians who had not taken arms against Rome[2500] and\r\nwho were willing to accept the gift.[2501] The same statute probably\r\nregulated the assignment of these new citizens to the tribes.[2502]\r\nIn the following year a law of L. Calpurnius Piso, probably a tribune,\r\ngranted the commanding general power, apparently absolute, to bestow\r\nthe right of the city upon the soldiers under his orders.[2503] Another\r\nstatute of 89, carried by M. Plautius Silvanus and C. Papirius Carbo,\r\ntribunes of the plebs, granted the citizenship to all members of allied\r\ncommunities who were domiciled in Italy at the time the statute was\r\npassed and who within sixty days should signify to the praetor at Rome\r\ntheir willingness to accept the offer.[2504] The object of this measure\r\nwas not only to expedite the reconciliation, but also to make the work\r\nof the next censors practicable. The citizenship thus granted involved\r\nthe right of suffrage, though in new tribes which voted after the others.\r\nMany Italians, especially the Lucanians and the Samnites, took no notice\r\nof the offer.[2505] In the same year Cn. Pompeius Strabo, a consul,\r\nproposed and carried a law which seems to have empowered himself at his\r\ndiscretion to invest with full citizenship those Transpadani who already\r\nenjoyed the Latin rights, and to confer upon the rest the ius Latii.[2506]\r\n\r\nThe question as to the composition of the courts, still left unsettled,\r\nwas taken up by M. Plautius Silvanus, the tribune referred to above. His\r\nstatute transferred the filling of the album from the urban praetor to\r\nthe tribes, which were to elect each fifteen members. The law made the\r\nqualifications of the iudices independent of the social classes. Under it\r\naccordingly senators and a few common plebeians in addition to equites\r\nserved as jurors, so that the equestrian control of the courts was\r\npartially checked.[2507]\r\n\r\nMommsen[2508] supposes that these jurors were for the quaestio de\r\nmaiestate only. For this opinion he depends upon the assertion of\r\nCicero[2509] that the equites remained till Sulla’s legislation in\r\nuninterrupted possession of the courts. The authority of Cicero, however,\r\nwould allow us to assume that while the equites lost the legal monopoly\r\nthey retained practical control. However that may be, it is hardly\r\npossible that this reactionary measure survived the proletarian uprising\r\nunder Marius and Cinna. The lex agraria of the same Plautius seems to\r\nhave been intended for supplying the veterans of the Social War with\r\nfarms.[2510] The lex Papiria, which introduced the semiuncial _as_, is\r\ndoubtless to be assigned to C. Papirius Carbo, the colleague of Plautius\r\nabove mentioned. If so, the object was to relieve slightly the financial\r\nembarrassment caused by the war, and more particularly to bring the small\r\ncoins of Rome into correspondence with those of Italy.[2511]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Political Equalization of Italy_\r\n\r\n88-83\r\n\r\nWith many Italians still in revolt and the others smarting under the\r\ninferior citizenship eked out to them, and with Mithridates threatening\r\nthe existence of the empire, Rome should have adopted a policy of\r\ndomestic conciliation. Under these circumstances Sulla, consul in 88,\r\nshowed a lamentable want of tact in expressing the sentiment that there\r\ncould be no peace in Italy as long as a single Samnite lived[2512]—a\r\ncuriously antiquated frame of mind for a statesman of his shrewdness.\r\nThe cause of the new citizens was taken up by P. Sulpicius Rufus, a\r\npatrician who had forsaken his rank to qualify himself for the plebeian\r\ntribunate.[2513] A man of marvellous eloquence, he had been an adherent\r\nof Drusus, though more inclined to the equestrian interests. As tribune\r\nof the plebs, 88, he seems to have tried to win the support of the senate\r\nand of the equestrian order to his policy; but failing in the attempt,\r\nhe looked for aid to the commons and to a small band of knights who were\r\nfaithful to him. His rogation contained the following articles: (1)\r\nthat the new citizens and the libertini should be distributed among all\r\nthe tribes,[2514] with a view to completing the plan of Livius Drusus\r\nfor the political equalization of Italy; (2) that those who had been\r\ndriven from the state by violence should be recalled.[2515] This article\r\nwas probably for the benefit of those knights against whom the Varian\r\nlaw had been turned.[2516] His rogation provided further, (3) that no\r\none who owed more than two thousand denarii should be a senator.[2517]\r\nMoney was scarce because of the war;[2518] and Sulpicius must have felt\r\nthat if the senators, most of whom were abundantly able, should pay\r\ntheir debts, it would go far toward relieving the stringency, and that\r\nif any were ejected because of failure to pay, an opportunity would be\r\nafforded of promoting equites to the vacant places. The consuls of the\r\nyear, L. Cornelius Sulla and Q. Pompeius Rufus, attempted to prevent a\r\nvote on these radical measures by interposing a cessation of business\r\nfor many days through the proclamation of a festival.[2519] With his\r\narmed followers Sulpicius forced the consuls to recall the proclamation,\r\nwhereupon Sulla fled for safety to his army at Nola. Sulpicius then\r\nadded to his statute a fourth article to the effect that the imperium\r\nof Sulla should be abrogated and that the province of Asia, involving\r\nthe conduct of the war against Mithridates, should be given to Marius\r\nas proconsul,[2520] although the latter was now but a private citizen.\r\nDoubtless Sulpicius understood that there could be no guarantee for\r\nthe execution of his statute as long as Sulla remained in power, and\r\nfurthermore that the advancement of Marius would be a great gain for the\r\nknights. The bill was passed by the comitia of tribes; but Sulla, far\r\nfrom delivering up his command, marched his army into Rome to settle the\r\nquestion in his own interest by the sword. On his initiative Sulpicius,\r\nMarius, and ten of their associates were declared public enemies by a\r\ndecree of the senate ratified by a popular vote.[2521] There is no need\r\nof assuming that the supporters of the tribune turned against him; the\r\noptimates were as clever as their opponents at packing assemblies. The\r\nabsurdity of continuing the worn-out comitial machinery as a factor of\r\ngovernment is nowhere more apparent than on this page of history, which\r\nrecords that the comitia a few days after adopting the measures of\r\nSulpicius, voted to outlaw him and his friends. Marius fled; Sulpicius\r\nand several adherents were killed. Thereupon the senate annulled the\r\nentire Sulpician statute on the ground that it had been violently\r\npassed.[2522]\r\n\r\nNo statesman, however opposed to popular government, could think of\r\nabolishing the comitia or even of putting an end to their legislative\r\nfunction. But the democracy could be effectually checked by reducing\r\nthe legislative power of the assemblies to the harmless function of\r\nratifying decrees of the senate. This result Sulla and Pompeius aimed\r\nto reach by renewing an ancient law[2523] that no measure should ever\r\nagain be brought before the people which had not been previously\r\nconsidered and agreed to by the senate.[2524] A closely related law of\r\nthe same consuls ordered that “the voting should not be by tribes but\r\nby centuries, as King Tullius had ordained.”[2525] This statement has\r\noften been interpreted to signify the restoration of the earlier form of\r\ncomitia centuriata. But it seems most improbable that, on the point of\r\nsetting out for a long, distant war, Sulla should think of restoring an\r\norganization which had been obsolete for more than a century and a half,\r\nand which could have been known to none but antiquarians. With his clear,\r\npractical intelligence he could not have failed to see the insuperable\r\ndifficulty of restoring the ancient definitions of the classes in\r\nterms of iugera or even on the later basis of the libral _as_.[2526]\r\nFurthermore no censors were then at hand to undertake the work, and it\r\nwas altogether unlikely that during his absence any could be elected who\r\nwould be willing to apply themselves to the revitalization of the antique\r\nmummy. Such a measure, too, as Meyer[2527] has pointed out, would place\r\nthe control of the assembly in the hands, not of the senate, but of the\r\nknights, his mortal enemies. It is far more reasonable to suppose that\r\nthis act transferred the function of ratifying laws from the tribal to\r\nthe centuriate comitia, to restore the arrangement supposed to have been\r\nintroduced by Servius Tullius.[2528] If this reasoning is correct, the\r\nact under consideration totally abolished the legislative initiative\r\nof the tribunes.[2529] The other Cornelian-Pompeian law mentioned by\r\nAppian must have applied, accordingly, not to the tribunate but to the\r\nother magistracies.[2530] The current interpretation, which involves\r\nthe theory of a return to the original centuriate system, requires\r\nfurther examination. Its chief basis is the statement of Appian that no\r\nlaw should be brought before the πλῆθος which had not been previously\r\nconsidered in the senate. It is commonly assumed that he uses δῆμος to\r\ndesignate the whole citizen body, and πλῆθος the exclusively plebeian\r\nassembly under tribunician presidency. A study of his usage, however,\r\nproves that he makes no such discrimination. Δῆμος is ordinarily the\r\npeople in general, especially as distinguished from the βουλή,[2531]\r\nparallel to Livy’s common distinction between plebs and senatus. It\r\nis the technical term for the plebs in their tribal comitia under\r\ntribunician presidency.[2532] Rarely it signifies the state[2533] with\r\nreference to the interest of the people. Πλῆθος, on the other hand,\r\nordinarily denotes the masses, multitude, rabble,[2534] including the\r\ncrowd gathered not only in a tribunician assembly[2535] but also in\r\nthe ἐκκλησία (here meaning contio) under the presidency of a patrician\r\nmagistrate.[2536] But πλῆθος is never technically or officially used to\r\ndenote any assembly either of the populus or of the plebs. In the passage\r\nunder discussion Appian’s statement of the Cornelian-Pompeian law is\r\nεἰσηγοῦντό τε μηδὲν ἔτι ἀπροβούλευτον ἐς τὸν δῆμον ἐσφέρεσθαι, in which\r\nhe uses δῆμος according to his custom to designate the popular assembly\r\nwithout specifying whether it is of the populus or of the plebs. In\r\ncommenting on it he substitutes πλῆθος for δῆμος for the purpose, not of\r\ndefining the assembly as tribunician, but of contrasting the masses in\r\nthe assembly with the nobles in the senate: ἐσ τὸ πλῆθος is substantially\r\nequivalent to ἐν τοῖς πένησι καὶ θρασυτάτοις used just below; Sulla\r\nwished nothing to be submitted to the masses in the comitia centuriata\r\nbefore it had been considered by the senate.\r\n\r\nAppian[2537] attributes to Sulla for this early date an attempt to\r\nincrease the number of senators. “They (the consuls) enrolled three\r\nhundred nobles in the senate, which had been reduced in numbers and for\r\nthat reason had come to be despised.” He does not state, however, by what\r\nauthority the consuls made this extraordinary adlectio; and it is in fact\r\nimprobable that the senate had so dwindled. However that may be, the\r\nincrease did not take permanent effect at this time.[2538] Two other laws\r\nof these consuls are briefly mentioned: (1) for planting colonies,[2539]\r\nof which nothing is known; (2) a lex unciaria.[2540] The latter may have\r\nbeen a reduction of existing debts by one-twelfth of the principle, or a\r\nlowering of the maximal rate of interest to 8⅓ per cent;[2541] or it may\r\nhave been a general insolvency law, providing for the payment of debts in\r\ninstalments.[2542] The chief value of these measures, even if we knew\r\nthem in detail, would be to reveal the idea of their authors; for they\r\nwere all repealed in the following year on the initiative of the consul\r\nL. Cornelius Cinna, probably by a comitial vote.[2543]\r\n\r\nCinna then proposed (1) a renewal of the Sulpician plebiscite for\r\nthe enrolment of the new citizens and the libertini among all the\r\ntribes,[2544] (2) a recall of Marius and the other exiles.[2545]\r\nBefore these measures could be carried, the consul was driven from\r\nRome and deposed from office by an act of the senate on the motion\r\nof Cn. Octavius, the other consul.[2546] This is the only certain\r\ninstance of the abrogation of the civil imperium known to the history\r\nof the republic. Cinna returned at the head of an army; and after\r\ntaking forcible possession of the city, he carried his law concerning\r\nthe exiles through the assembly either on his own motion or that of a\r\ntribune.[2547] As the senate, reversing its earlier action,[2548] had\r\nalready legalized the Sulpician provision concerning the distribution of\r\nthe libertini and the new citizens among the thirty-five tribes,[2549] it\r\nwas without reënactment carried into effect in 84.[2550] The execution\r\nof this measure completed the political unification of Italy. Meantime\r\nL. Valerius Flaccus, consul suffectus in 86, to relieve the financial\r\ndistress, passed a law which compelled creditors to satisfy themselves\r\nwith one-fourth of the amount due.[2551] In 83 M. Junius Brutus, tribune\r\nof the plebs, proposed and carried, as a milder measure of relief, a law\r\nfor the colonization of Capua.[2552]\r\n\r\n    Schulze, C.

As both consuls, Cn. Papirius Carbo and C.\r\nMarius the younger,[2553] were dead, and as Sulla desired above all\r\nthings to give his legislation a constitutional basis, he advised the\r\nsenate to appoint an interrex. The choice fell on L. Valerius Flaccus,\r\nprinceps senatus, a moderate in politics. Thereupon Sulla withdrew\r\nfrom Rome, leaving the civil authorities free in appearance to act at\r\ntheir discretion. In reality he had determined to retain control of\r\naffairs; and accordingly he wrote to Valerius advising the appointment\r\nof a dictator, not for a fixed time but till the general unrest should\r\nbe quieted. He suggested himself as a suitable person for the place.\r\nValerius obediently proposed and carried a law through the comitia\r\ncenturiata, (1) which made Sulla dictator rei publicae constituendae for\r\nan indefinite time with absolute power over the lives and property of the\r\ncitizens,[2554] (2) which legalized all his past acts, both as consul and\r\nas proconsul,[2555] including his arrangements in Asia as well as his\r\nproscriptions and confiscations.[2556] He returned to the city, appointed\r\nValerius his magister equitum,[2557] and took to himself twenty-four\r\nlictors in addition to a less formal guard of servants and friends.[2558]\r\nWithout delay he began the promulgation of laws, which undoubtedly he had\r\nlong been planning. They are here grouped according to subject, with an\r\noccasional reference to their chronological relation.\r\n\r\nFirst he applied himself to curbing the power of the tribunate, an\r\ninstitution in which centred the strength of the democracy. A statute for\r\nthat purpose he must have felt compelled to draw up and pass before the\r\nnext tribunician election. Instead of renewing his earlier law, however,\r\nfor absolutely depriving the tribunes of initiative in legislation,[2559]\r\nhe enacted simply that the previous consent of the senate should be\r\nnecessary to bills brought by them before the tribes.[2560] By another\r\narticle of this law he limited the right of tribunes to address the\r\npeople in contiones.[2561] The range of their intercession was also\r\ngreatly limited.[2562] Their function of bringing prosecutions before\r\nthe people underwent restriction not only through the laws affecting the\r\nquaestiones but also by special enactment;[2563] for had they retained\r\ntheir unlimited right to prosecute, they could at once have regained\r\nall their other power.[2564] Little was left them but their original\r\nauxilii latio adversus imperium.[2565] Finally the office was made\r\nunattractive to the ambitious by the provision that those who held it\r\nwere thereby disqualified for other magistracies.[2566] By these measures\r\nthe most vital and powerful institution in the state was reduced to a\r\nshadow without substance.[2567] The return to conditions preceding the\r\nHortensian legislation, in some respects even the Decemviral legislation,\r\nwas, as Fröhlich[2568] remarks, a backward step such as finds few\r\nparallels in history.\r\n\r\nAbout a year[2569] after limiting the power of the tribunes Sulla\r\nproceeded to regulate the other offices through his lex de magistratibus,\r\n81. This statute, making use of the principle contained in the lex\r\nVillia annalis,[2570] prescribed (1) that no one could be consul before\r\nhe had been praetor or praetor before he had been quaestor,[2571] (2)\r\nthat a space of two years should intervene between the holding of\r\nconsecutive offices.[2572] (3) The minimal age of the quaestor it fixed\r\nat thirty-seven.[2573] The fortieth year was therefore the age for the\r\npraetorship and the forty-third for the office of consul. The aedileship,\r\nwhile bringing the holder a positive advantage for his future career, was\r\nnever an essential step to a higher place. But in case this office was\r\ntaken, the biennial interval had to be observed.[2574] The quaestorship\r\nSulla made the sole avenue to the senate, so as to dispense with the\r\nrevision of the list by the censors.[2575] The statute of 151, forbidding\r\nreëlection to the consulship,[2576] he repealed, and substituted for\r\nit the article of the Genucian plebiscite of 442[2577] which fixed an\r\ninterval of ten years between the expiration of any office and reëlection\r\nto the same.[2578] He increased the number of quaestors, at this time\r\ncertainly more than eight,[2579] to twenty, with the object not only of\r\nsupplying an administrative need but also of creating the required number\r\nof senators.[2580] It was necessary also to raise the number of praetors\r\nfrom six to eight in order to provide presidents for the new quaestiones\r\nperpetuae.[2581]\r\n\r\nThe reforms above mentioned, together with the doubling of the number\r\nof senators to be considered below, naturally led to the enlargement of\r\nthe chief sacerdotal colleges. The augurs and pontiffs were increased\r\nfrom nine to fifteen and the decemviri sacris faciundis were made\r\nquindecemviri.[2582] Another measure, which seems to have been an article\r\nof the same act, repealed the Domitian lex de sacerdotiis,[2583] and thus\r\nrestored to these colleges, and at the same time to the epulones, their\r\nright of filling vacancies by coöptation,[2584] leaving to the people the\r\nfunction only of electing the head of the pontifical college from among\r\nthe members.[2585] As the object of the first article was evidently to\r\nprovide places for some of the new magistrates and senators,[2586] the\r\ncoöptation doubtless immediately followed the enactment of the law.\r\n\r\nIn increasing the number of praetors to eight[2587] Sulla provided that\r\nduring their year of office they were to remain in the city and devote\r\ntheir whole time to the administration of justice. After the expiration\r\nof their term they were to take upon themselves as propraetors the\r\ncommand of provinces. In like manner the consuls were to remain in\r\nItaly during their term, in the ordinary course of events to give their\r\nentire attention to the affairs of peace; only after they had retired\r\nfrom office were they expected as proconsuls to govern provinces. In\r\nbrief, Sulla by law established an absolute distinction between the civil\r\nmagistrate and the military promagistrate.[2588] The lex de provinciis\r\nordinandis[2589] recognized the right of the senate to determine which\r\nprovinces should be consular and which pretorian in the way provided for\r\nby the Sempronian law on this subject.[2590] The Cornelian statute did\r\nnot, however, any more than the Sempronian, forbid the assignment of a\r\nprovince to a promagistrate by popular vote; and it recognized the right\r\nof the senate to create promagistracies.[2591] But it established the\r\nrule (1) that the two consuls should receive for a year of promagisterial\r\nimperium the provinces declared to be consular; and that they should\r\neither agree as to which each should take or cast lots for them;[2592]\r\n(2) that the senate should annually assign the eight retiring praetors\r\nto the remaining provinces, also for a year of promagistracy.[2593] The\r\nsame law directed that the promagistrate, who had received the imperium\r\nin legal form, should retain it till his return to the city and the\r\ncelebration of his triumph,[2594] provided he merited one. To avoid\r\nconflicts between retiring and incoming governors it ordained that the\r\nformer should leave the province within thirty days after the latter had\r\nentered it.[2595] The law further contained the definite regulation of\r\nthe supplies and honors granted the legati by the provincials.[2596] The\r\ntendency of Sulla’s legislation thus far considered was to weaken the\r\ncivil functionaries (1) by restricting the tribunician initiative. (2)\r\nby increasing the number of quaestors and praetors. (3) by depriving the\r\nhigher civil magistrates of the military imperium. The last-mentioned\r\nloss was in some measure an advantage to the senate but in a far higher\r\ndegree to the promagistrates, who from this time began to overshadow the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nThe power taken from the tribunes necessarily went to the senate, to\r\nrestore to it the full control of legislation which it had possessed\r\nbefore the enactment of the Hortensian statute. Under the reformed\r\nconstitution it was to be supreme. As it had dwindled during the recent\r\ncivil war and proscription,[2597] and as the performance of jury service,\r\nwhich Sulla was restoring to its members, required a large number of men,\r\nhe added three hundred, mostly from the equestrian rank, but including\r\nsome centurions and other insignificant persons who were likely to do his\r\nbidding.[2598] Appian[2599] states that these new senators were elected\r\nby the tribes, possibly meaning the tribal comitia.[2600] But as that\r\nprocess of selection would have required an enormous length of time, it\r\nis far more probable that each tribe had the privilege of choosing a\r\ndefinite number, perhaps nine, after the precedent of the lex Plautia\r\niudiciaria.[2601] This addition would raise the number to about four\r\nhundred and fifty. As the normal membership from Sulla to Caesar was\r\nabout six hundred,[2602] we may assume either that, independently of\r\nthe extraordinary adlectio by the tribes, he made the usual censorial\r\nenrolment of the recently retired magistrates, or that he left it to time\r\nto fill up the senate to the desired number by the annual admission of\r\nretired quaestors.[2603] Henceforth it was to be recruited automatically\r\nby this process, without any action on the part of the censors,\r\nwho were thus deprived of the only important function remaining to\r\nthem.[2604] Closely connected with the increase in membership is the lex\r\niudiciaria,[2605] which restored the quaestiones to the senators.[2606]\r\nIt was enacted near the end of 81, but prior to the increase in the\r\nnumber of quaestors.[2607] Before this act the courts had remained under\r\nthe control of the knights in spite of the lex Plautia of 89, which seems\r\nnot to have continued long in force.[2608]\r\n\r\nIn the reorganization of the criminal courts (year 81) Sulla passed\r\ncriminal laws, in which he regulated the procedure of the existing\r\ncourts and created new quaestiones perpetuae.[2609] His reform increased\r\nthe number to seven, four of which were concerned almost wholly with\r\nmaladministration of office: (1) quaestio repetundarum, extortion,[2610]\r\n(2) quaestio ambitus, bribery in elections,[2611] (3) quaestio peculatus,\r\nmisappropriation of public funds[2612] and sacrilege,[2613] (4)\r\nquaestio maiestatis, injury to the majesty of the Roman name, of which\r\na private person as well as a magistrate might be guilty.[2614] The\r\nthree following were concerned with common crimes: (5) quaestio inter\r\nsicarios et veneficos, assassination, poisoning, and arson,[2615] (6)\r\nquaestio de falsis, counterfeiting and falsification of testaments and\r\nother forgery,[2616] (7) quaestio iniuriarum, acute personal violence,\r\nhousebreaking, and probably defamation of character.[2617] These laws\r\nconcerning quaestiones contained provisions for granting the accused the\r\nprivilege of deciding whether the vote should be oral or by ballot,[2618]\r\nand they directed that the order of voting should be determined by\r\nlot.[2619] The first of these two articles aimed to make the jurors\r\nindividually responsible, and the second to prevent influential men from\r\nprejudicing the case by giving their opinions first.[2620]\r\n\r\nWhile the praetor urbanus and praetor peregrinus still busied themselves\r\nwith civil jurisdiction, the six other praetors presided over these\r\ncourts; but as the number was insufficient, past aediles were appointed\r\nto preside as iudices quaestionis. This arrangement was especially\r\nnecessary for the quaestio inter sicarios, overburdened as it was with a\r\nvariety of crimes.\r\n\r\nAs these courts were vested with the function of trying without appeal\r\nall crimes, including those formerly brought before the comitia, the\r\nresult was that the people were practically, though not constitutionally,\r\ndeprived of their judicial power. The tendency of the Cornelian\r\nlegislation in this as in other respects was oligarchic.\r\n\r\nAmong the statutes passed in the winter or early spring of 81 we must\r\nplace the lex de proscriptione,[2621] which added certain regulations\r\nto those of the Valerian law for the creation of the Cornelian\r\ndictatorship,[2622] and which Sulla considered essential to the execution\r\nof his policy and the maintenance of its results. The Cornelian\r\nstatute concerning proscription forbade the giving of relief or aid\r\nto a proscribed person;[2623] it legalized the previous slayings and\r\nconfiscations of property,[2624] and provided also that the estates not\r\nonly of the proscribed but also of enemies who had fallen in battle\r\nshould be sold for the benefit of the treasury.[2625] It excepted from\r\nthe sale ten thousand of the youngest and strongest slaves, who were\r\ngiven their freedom; and it debarred from the ius honorum the sons,\r\ngrandsons, and other descendants of the proscribed,[2626] with a view to\r\nkeeping from them the means of vengeance; and lastly, it fixed the date\r\nfor closing the proscriptions at June 1, 81.[2627]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 82-81 Sulla gave his attention not only to\r\nlaw-making but also to the sale of confiscated property and to\r\nthe regulation of Italy. The latter work was carried out by the\r\nadministrative power of the dictator through the destruction of the\r\nfortifications of rebellious communities, their punishment by fines and\r\nextraordinary taxes, and the confiscation of some of their lands, to\r\nbe assigned to his discharged veterans.[2628] The Cornelian agrarian\r\nlaws,[2629] which brought about these confiscations and assignments,\r\nseem to have been not acts of the comitia but dictatorial orders.[2630]\r\nThey must have been issued from time to time as occasion demanded,\r\nprobably through the entire year 81.[2631] The legions were kept together\r\ntill after the triumph (January 27, 28 of the year 81)[2632] and then\r\ndisbanded, to be led off gradually to their lands. Some of the municipia\r\nto which soldiers were assigned, most obstinately Volaterrae and Nola,\r\nresisted their admission by force of arms. To punish these rebels Sulla\r\ncarried through the comitia centuriata his lex de civitate Volaterranis\r\nadimenda,[2633] which disfranchised not only Volaterrae but also other\r\nrebellious municipia.[2634] Those who by this act were deprived of the\r\ncitizenship received the so-called Latin rights of Ariminum.[2635]\r\n\r\nAmong the regulations for the improvement of the finances, which he\r\nfound in bad condition,[2636] was his abolition of the distributions\r\nof grain.[2637] Whether it was effected by a lex frumentaria or a\r\ndictatorial order cannot be determined.[2638] The levy of taxes on\r\nItalian and transmarine communities[2639] could be brought about by\r\nsenatus consulta,[2640] as the people had nothing to do with such\r\nmatters. Credit had been shattered by the law of L. Valerius Flaccus\r\nconcerning debts, 86,[2641] which Sulla repealed by one of his own on the\r\nsame subject, 81.[2642]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Circensian games which he celebrated in the\r\nautumn of 81, and which in honor of Victoria were thereafter repeated\r\nannually from October 26 to November 1,[2643] Sulla must have passed\r\na lex de ludis Victoriae instituendis.[2644] Lastly came the sumptuary\r\nlaw, through which he attempted to regulate the manners and morals of\r\nthe citizens.[2645] It was the restoration, in a revised form, of the\r\nlex Licinia of 104,[2646] which had been repealed by M. Duronius in\r\n97.[2647] The Cornelian statute permitted the expenditure of no more than\r\nthree hundred sesterces for meals on the calends, nones, ides, ludi, and\r\ncertain other holidays, and only thirty for ordinary meals; and it fixed\r\nthe prices of various luxuries.[2648] Another article of the same statute\r\nlimited funeral expenses.[2649] The author’s object seems to have been to\r\nrestore the morals and manners as well as the constitution and laws of\r\nthe good old time before they were corrupted by the demagogues.\r\n\r\nSulla’s legislation was substantially complete on January 1, 80, when\r\nhe entered upon his second consulship with Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius\r\nas colleague.[2650] Retiring into private life early in 79, he left\r\nthe constitution to its fate. No better comment on its value could be\r\noffered than the history of its decline and overthrow in a single decade.\r\nOpposition began to manifest itself from the time of his abdication;\r\nand he was hardly in his grave when M. Aemilius Lepidus, consul in 78,\r\npromulgated bills for the abolition of some of the Cornelian statutes;\r\nbut the opposition of his colleague, Q. Lutatius Catulus, and of the\r\nsenate prevented their ratification.[2651] The right of retired tribunes\r\nto sue for other offices,[2652] however, was restored by a statute of\r\nthe consul C. Aurelius Cotta, 75.[2653]\r\n\r\nBefore coming to the restoration of the tribunician power it is necessary\r\nto mention the statutes passed under the Cornelian constitution. To\r\n78 or 77 probably belongs the lex Plautia de vi, generally regarded\r\nas tribunician, which established a quaestio perpetua for the trial\r\nof persons charged with violence. It also forbade the acquisition by\r\nlong use of things stolen or violently seized.[2654] As no censors were\r\nelected, an order of the people of unknown authorship in 75, pursuant\r\nto a senatus consultum, empowered the consuls of the year to farm the\r\nvectigalia.[2655] The approaching end of the Cornelian régime was\r\nforeboded in the Plautian law for the recall of Cinna and other exiled\r\ndemocrats, if indeed this measure belongs to 73,[2656] and certainly in\r\nthe consular law of Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus, 72, which directed\r\nthe consuls of the year to collect the money remitted by Sulla to the\r\npurchasers of confiscated estates.[2657] A popular tendency may be\r\ndiscovered as well in the final settlement of the question of conflict\r\nbetween sessions of the senate and of the comitia by the lex Pupia, which\r\nseems to have been a statute of M. Pupius Piso Calpurnianus, praetor\r\nin 71.[2658] It forbade the magistrates to convoke the senate on those\r\ncomitial days on which an assembly actually met,[2659] the prohibition\r\napplying to that part only of the day which preceded the dismissal of the\r\ncomitia.[2660] It was probably this year which saw the enactment of the\r\nlex Antonia de Termessibus—a plebiscite proposed de senatus sententia\r\nby C. Antonius, tribune of the plebs, and several of his colleagues,\r\nfor granting to Termessus Major in Pisidia the rights of a free state\r\nin friendship and alliance with Rome, and for regulating on that basis\r\nthe relations which were to exist between the inhabitants and the\r\nRomans.[2661]\r\n\r\nThe struggle for the rehabilitation of the tribunes began in 78, when\r\nthose officials applied to the consuls for legislation on the subject.\r\nEven Aemilius Lepidus[2662] declined, as he could see no advantage in\r\nthe unhampered tribunate.[2663] Though generally in these early years\r\nof the Cornelian régime the tribunes were mere puppets of the senate,\r\none of them in 76, L. Sicinius, dared in a contio to plead for the full\r\nrestoration of their office.[2664] In the following year Q. Opimius,\r\nanother tribune, continued the struggle, with such success that he\r\nsecured the passage of the Aurelian law above mentioned.[2665] This\r\nmeasure narrowly escaped annulment, and Opimius after retiring from\r\noffice was exorbitantly fined on the ground that he had interceded in\r\nviolation of a Cornelian law.[2666] In the year of the condemnation of\r\nOpimius, 74, L. Quinctius, who had risen to the tribunate from the lowest\r\nsocial class, strove energetically for the same object,[2667] though he\r\ncould effect no more than the maintenance of the Aurelian law. Toward\r\nthe close of his term, however, he opened battle against the senatorial\r\ncourts, which had fallen into disfavor because of their corruption.[2668]\r\nIn 73 the contest was resumed by Licinius Macer the annalist, then\r\ntribune of the plebs, who demanded in vain the full restoration of the\r\ntribunician power.[2669] In his efforts he had the support of C. Julius\r\nCaesar.[2670] The struggle died down as the danger from Spartacus rose;\r\nbut at the close of the servile war it was a tribune of the plebs, M.\r\nLollius Palicanus, a man of low birth, who in a contio held outside the\r\nwalls in order that Pompey, a proconsul, might attend, persuaded the\r\nlatter to commit himself publicly to a definite promise to bring about\r\na repeal of the lex Cornelia de tribunicia potestate.[2671] Inveighing\r\nagainst the corruption of the senatorial courts,[2672] Pompey in the same\r\nspeech intimated an intention to propose a bill on this subject as well.\r\n\r\nShortly after entering upon the office of consul in 70, or at all events\r\nbefore the elections of the year,[2673] Pompey promulgated his rogation\r\nfor the restoration of the tribunician power. The senate yielded in\r\nspite of its dislike for the measure,[2674] and Licinius Crassus, his\r\ncolleague,[2675] added his name to the proposal.[2676] The people gladly\r\naccepted it. Those articles of the Cornelian statute which remained\r\nuntouched by the Aurelian law of 75 were thereby repealed, and every\r\nrestriction on the tribunes removed.[2677] By destroying the chief\r\nsupport of the Cornelian constitution this measure paved the way to\r\nits overthrow. Notwithstanding the popular clamor for a reform of the\r\ncourts,[2678] Pompey hesitated to propose a law for that purpose, as he\r\nhoped rather to purify the senatorial order through a severe censorial\r\nrevision so as to make a judiciary law unnecessary. The reform, however,\r\nwas taken in hand by L. Aurelius Cotta, praetor in the same year,\r\nyoungest brother of the consul of 75.[2679] The rogation was promulgated\r\nwhile the trial of Verres was in progress and while the people were\r\nexcited by lack of confidence in the senatorial jurors.[2680] The\r\nfirst project seems to have been the retransfer of the courts to the\r\nequites;[2681] but when the senators saw that they were destined to lose\r\nin the contest, they were able to save something by compromise. It was\r\nagreed that there should be three decuries of jurors, composed in equal\r\nnumbers of senators, knights, and tribuni aerarii respectively.[2682]\r\nThe last-named decury was included because the Plautian judiciary law\r\nof 89 had opened the courts to common citizens in addition to senators\r\nand knights,[2683] and it was now thought that no less liberality\r\nshould be shown. The Aurelian statute provided accordingly that the\r\nurban praetor[2684] should make up the annual album iudicum of an equal\r\nnumber of men from each of the three classes.[2685] The good feature of\r\nthe law is obvious. As experience had proved the equestrian courts, as\r\nwell as the senatorial, to be partisan and corrupt, it was hoped that a\r\ncombination of the two with an equal proportion of the most responsible\r\nand respectable common citizens would be just and impartial. If these\r\nexpectations were not realized, it was the fault of the Romans, not of\r\ntheir law.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Democracy in Alliance with Caesarism_\r\n\r\n70-49\r\n\r\nThe first tribunician law under the restored constitution may have been\r\nthe sumptuary statute of C. Antius Restio, which Lange[2686] assigns to\r\nthe year 70. It limited the amount to be expended on festive meals; it\r\ndesignated some delicacies as allowable and others as forbidden; and it\r\nregulated the participation of candidates and of magistrates in dinners\r\naway from home, doubtless with a view to curtailing ambitus practiced by\r\nsuch means.[2687] Far however from being a partisan measure, this statute\r\nseems to have been suggested by the censors of the year, to reënforce\r\ntheir function of supervising the morals of the citizens.\r\n\r\nThree years passed before the tribunes of the plebs were ready to make\r\nindependent use of their recovered power. The reason is to be found in\r\nthe harmony—concordia ordinum[2688]—reëstablished between senators and\r\nknights, when representatives of the two classes found themselves sitting\r\ntogether on the jury benches. Although the object of the combination was\r\nidealized by contemporaries, it was in fact a governing “trust,” which in\r\npractice operated for the maintenance of plutocracy and for the ruthless\r\nexploitation of the provincials.[2689] The nobles were willing to concede\r\nsomething to the equites to make permanent the alliance with this\r\npowerful order.[2690] L. Roscius Otho, tribune of the plebs in 67, as\r\nspokesman of the optimates[2691] “railroaded”[2692] through the assembly\r\na statute which ordered that there should be reserved in the theatre for\r\nthose in possession of the equestrian census[2693] fourteen rows of seats\r\njust back of the orchestra, in which sat the senators.[2694] It was more\r\nthan a restoration of the concession made to the knights in 146, which\r\nevidently Sulla had withdrawn.[2695]\r\n\r\nThere were in this year (67), however, two popular tribunes, A. Gabinius\r\nand C. Cornelius, both of whom proposed and carried laws in the interest\r\nof the people. Early in the year Gabinius persuaded the tribes to adopt\r\na statute which ordered the senate to sit daily during February to\r\nconsider embassies.[2696] It was in this month that delegations from\r\nother states generally came. Often to obtain a hearing they had to bribe\r\nthe senators and magistrates.[2697] For that month the Gabinian law\r\nreversed the Pupian[2698] by making senatorial sessions compulsory and\r\nforbidding the concurrence of comitia.[2699] The object was to limit the\r\nstay of foreign embassies at Rome not only for their own convenience\r\nbut also for lessening both the need and the opportunity for bribery.\r\nClosely related was the purpose of his statute which forbade lending\r\nmoney to provincials at Rome.[2700] Representatives of subject and\r\nallied states, finding it necessary to bribe more extensively than their\r\nresources in hand allowed, were tempted to borrow of the capitalists at\r\nexorbitant interest. Private individuals from the provinces must often\r\nhave similarly borrowed to the ruin of their fortunes. The double aim\r\nof the statute, accordingly, was to help the provincials and to check\r\nbribery. How it passed against senatorial opposition is unknown. A\r\nsupplementary measure on the same subject was proposed to the senate by\r\nC. Cornelius, a colleague of Gabinius, for prohibiting the lending of\r\nmoney to the legati of other states, the idea being identical with that\r\nof the two Gabinian laws. The good intention of Cornelius is vouched for\r\nby the well-known uprightness[2701] of his character, which contrasts\r\nwith the reputed vileness of Gabinius. But the senate rejected the\r\nproposal on the ground that it had already made sufficient provision\r\nfor checking the abuse. Although Cornelius thereupon complained in a\r\ncontio that the provinces were being exhausted by usury, he does not\r\nseem to have urged his measure further.[2702] He promulgated, however,\r\nagainst the interests of the senate a rogation for ordering that no one\r\nshould receive a dispensation from a law excepting through a vote of the\r\ncomitia. This right had been acquired by the people in the period between\r\nthe Publilian and the Hortensian legislation (339-287).[2703] It had\r\ncome to be regarded as inseparable from the sovereignty of the people\r\nto such an extent that all senatus consulta for dispensing from the\r\nlaws contained a provision for bringing the matter before the comitia.\r\nGradually the custom of referring to the people ceased, and at last\r\nthe provision to that effect was dropped from senatorial decrees. The\r\nresult was that often a few senators, meeting in the Curia, voted away to\r\nacquaintances and relatives the valuable privilege of exemption from a\r\nlaw. The optimates induced a tribune of the plebs, P. Servilius Globulus,\r\nto intercede against the bill while it was being read to the assembly\r\nprior to the vote. When the dissenting tribune forbade the crier to\r\nproceed with the reading, Cornelius himself read it.[2704] A disturbance\r\nin the assembly, started by the interference of Piso the consul, caused\r\nCornelius to dismiss the concilium. Afterward he so compromised with the\r\noptimates as to secure the passage of a law that no dispensations should\r\nbe granted by the senate unless two hundred members were present, and\r\nthat when a resolution of the kind was brought down from the senate to\r\nthe people, no one should intercede against the act.[2705] The victory\r\nwas with the senate; it gained a legal right to a function which it had\r\nusurped, provision being merely made against abuse. But it exercised\r\nthis function by the sufferance of the tribunes, any one of whom could\r\ninsist on bringing the dispensing resolution before the people, in which\r\ncase his colleagues were forbidden to intercede.[2706]\r\n\r\nAnother proposal of this tribune was the rogatio de ambitu, which\r\nthreatened with severe penalties not only the candidates but also their\r\nagents, the divisores, whose duty was to distribute the corruption fund\r\namong the tribes.[2707] The senate, declaring the penalties so harsh\r\nthat neither accuser nor jurors could be found to enforce it, put the\r\nbill in the hands of the two consuls, C. Calpurnius Piso and M’. Acilius\r\nGlabrio.[2708] Here was a comical situation; both consuls were liable to\r\nthe existing law on the subject; but for the sake of appearances they\r\nhad to revise the bill and present it to the comitia in the Forum.[2709]\r\nThe lex Acilia Calpurnia, enacted in this way,[2710] inflicted on those\r\nfound guilty of the crime a heavy fine, and forever disqualified them\r\nfrom holding office or sitting in the senate.[2711] Cornelius proposed\r\nother measures, all of which were vetoed by colleagues excepting his\r\nlex concerning the edict of the praetor, described as follows by Dio\r\nCassius:[2712] “All the praetors themselves compiled and published the\r\nprinciples according to which they intended to try cases; for all the\r\ndecrees regarding contracts had not yet been laid down. Now since they\r\nwere not in the habit of doing this once for all and did not observe\r\nthe rules as written, but often made changes in them and incidentally\r\na number of clauses naturally appeared in some one’s favor or to some\r\none’s hurt, he moved that they should at the very start announce the\r\nprinciples they would use and not swerve from them at all.” The object\r\nwas to make the administration of the law more just and regular, and to\r\ncut off an opportunity for favoritism.[2713]\r\n\r\nBy far the most important measure of the year was the Gabinian law\r\nfor the appointment of an especial commander against the pirates. The\r\nproposition was that from the consulares should be chosen a general\r\nfor putting down the pirates; that his province should be the entire\r\nMediterranean and a strip of its coasts extending fifty miles inland,\r\nincluding Italy and the islands; that the command should continue three\r\nyears; that the holder of this imperium should have the right to fifteen\r\nlegati and 200 ships, and the privilege of enlisting soldiers and oarsmen\r\nover all his province; that he should have credit with the aerarium at\r\nRome and the publicans in the provinces for 6000 talents.[2714] The name\r\nof Pompey did not appear in the bill, but no one doubted who was to be\r\nthe man. The optimates were all opposed, though in 74 they had given\r\nAntonius such a command,[2715] which now served Gabinius as a precedent.\r\nThe senate was compelled by threats of the people to yield, but used its\r\ninfluence on the colleagues of Gabinius to have them oppose the measure.\r\nTwo of them, L. Roscius Otho, author of the lex theatralis,[2716] and\r\nL. Trebellius, attempted to prevent comitial action. The tribes began\r\nto vote the deposition of Trebellius; but before the eighteenth was\r\ncalled he desisted.[2717] Thereafter both remained silent, and the law\r\nwas passed. Pompey was then elected to the command by the tribes.[2718]\r\nThey enacted further that he should have two quaestors, twenty-four\r\nlegati pro praetore, 500 ships, 120,000 men, and 5000 cavalry. On one\r\npoint only the senate refused its sanction; it would not permit Gabinius\r\nto be a legatus.[2719] An article of the statute gave as a province to\r\nthe outgoing consul, M’. Acilius Glabrio, Bithynia and Pontus with the\r\nconduct of the war against Mithridates.[2720] The Gabinian law led to\r\nfar-reaching consequences. It established temporarily, not precisely a\r\nmonarchy, but a dyarchy, as the Roman world was thereby divided between\r\nthe senate and a general with almost absolute power. The arrangement was\r\na prototype of the Augustan system. At the outset the act seemed to be\r\njustified by the results, for immediately after its adoption the price of\r\ngrain fell from the famine height to which the piratical control of the\r\nseas had forced it.[2721]\r\n\r\nAn addition to this vast power was made in the following year by the\r\nManilian law. The author, C. Manilius, after entering upon his tribunate\r\non December 10, 67, promulgated a rogation for giving libertini the right\r\nto vote in the tribes of their patrons.[2722] It was said by some, though\r\nprobably without ground, that the real author was Cornelius.[2723] While\r\nin general the optimates disliked the measure, some favored it in the\r\nhope that they would gain political influence through the votes of their\r\nfreedmen.[2724] In spite of the fact that constitutionally the comitia\r\ncould not be held on a festive day, Manilius convoked the assembly on\r\nthe last day of the year, which was the Compitalia, toward evening,\r\ngathering to the assembly a few men who he knew favored the proposal. On\r\nthe following day the senate heard of the enactment and at once declared\r\nit invalid.[2725] The behavior of Manilius exposed him to certain\r\nprosecution unless he could win powerful support. This is the motive\r\nascribed to him by Dio Cassius[2726] for his famous law which conferred\r\nextraordinary power on Pompey for the conduct of the war against\r\nMithridates.[2727] It gave the Roman general, in addition to his existing\r\ncommand, the provinces of Asia, Bithynia, and Cilicia with the right to\r\ndeclare war and make treaties at his discretion.[2728] The province thus\r\ngranted him included nearly all the eastern domain of Rome which had not\r\nalready been conferred by the Gabinian law. No discussion of this measure\r\nin the senate is mentioned, though it is difficult to understand how such\r\naction could be avoided.[2729] The only optimates who opposed the bill in\r\ncontiones were Q. Lutatius Catulus and Q. Hortensius, who had been the\r\nchief opponents of the Gabinian law. Their objection was the monarchical\r\nposition in which these measures were placing Pompey.[2730] Its leading\r\nsupporters were Caesar and Cicero.[2731] It was so enthusiastically\r\nfavored by the knights and the populace that its adoption was from the\r\nbeginning a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn 65 the conservatives found themselves strong enough to put through\r\nthe assembly the plebiscite of C. Papius for expelling the peregrini\r\nfrom Rome, and for punishing those who had usurped the rights of the\r\ncitizens. The object was to prevent Latin-speaking foreigners, especially\r\nthe Transpadane Gauls, from packing the assemblies with a view to passing\r\nmeasures for the further extension of the franchise. The Papian law was\r\nmodelled after the Claudian of 177,[2732] the Junian of 126,[2733] and in\r\nsome respects after the Licinian-Mucian of 95.[2734] Probably to the same\r\nPapius belongs the lex Papia de Vestalium lectione, which limited the\r\npower of choice exercised by the supreme pontiff.[2735]\r\n\r\nAfter the unusual comitial activity of 67-66 there was almost a pause\r\nin legislation till the year of Cicero’s consulship, 63. To that date\r\nbelongs the plebiscite of T. Atius Labienus, which restored the form of\r\nelection of sacerdotes introduced by Domitius in 103[2736] and abolished\r\nby Sulla.[2737]\r\n\r\nA remarkable effort at agrarian legislation was made at the beginning\r\nof the year by P. Servilius Rullus, tribune of the plebs. In December,\r\n64, shortly after entering office, he promulgated a bill, comprising\r\nmore than forty articles,[2738] with the intention of having it\r\nvoted on in January.[2739] The administration of the law was to\r\nbe in the hands of ten men elected by seventeen tribes after the\r\nmanner of the comitia pontificis maximi,[2740] to hold office five\r\nyears.[2741] Candidates should be required to present themselves in\r\nperson[2742] (so as to exclude Pompey). This commission was to have the\r\nirresponsible[2743] management of large resources[2744] for the purchase\r\nof land in Italy,[2745] on which they were to plant colonies at their\r\ndiscretion.[2746] The object of the rogation seems to have been the\r\ncreation of an oligarchy of ten who with their vast powers and revenues\r\nshould control Rome and counterbalance the military prestige of Pompey.\r\nCaesar and Crassus were probably behind the scheme. Should it by any\r\nchance succeed, they would be the dominant members of the board. Its\r\nfaulty structure and revolutionary demands, however, made failure almost\r\ncertain from the outset. At all events Cicero, driven into the ranks\r\nof the optimates by the necessity of opposing it,—so Caesar may have\r\nreasoned,—would thus be eliminated from the leadership of the democratic\r\nparty, while the populace, with appetite whetted for an agrarian law,\r\nwould be ready for the saner measure which Caesar was himself intending\r\nto propose as soon as an opportunity offered. But Cicero out-manoeuvred\r\nhis adversaries. It was as a friend of the people and an ally of the\r\ntribunes that he opposed the bill in two contiones,[2747] after which\r\na threat of intercession on the part of a colleague induced Rullus to\r\nwithdraw it.\r\n\r\nIn Cicero’s judgment there was pressing need of a new lex de ambitu\r\nto cover the loopholes left by the Acilian-Calpurnian statute of\r\n67.[2748] Early in the year he passed through the senate a decree which\r\nso interpreted that enactment as to make it apply to the hiring of\r\nsectatores, the granting of free seats to the tribes at gladiatorial\r\nshows, and the entertainment of the public at dinners.[2749] Later\r\nin the summer, after the elections of the year had been announced,\r\na dispensation from the Aelian-Fufian law[2750] enabled him and C.\r\nAntonius, his colleague,[2751] to propose and carry a new statute\r\nconcerning bribery at elections.[2752] It increased the penalty on the\r\ndivisores,[2753] and forbade any one within the two years preceding the\r\nannouncement of a candidacy to give gladiatorial shows excepting in\r\nfulfilment of a testament.[2754] The penalty for the convicted candidate\r\nwas ten years’ exile.[2755] The part of the law which had to do with the\r\njurors included a provision for fining those who absented themselves\r\nfrom the trial even on the ground of illness.[2756] A measure certainly\r\npassed in this year, and probably forming an article of the Tullian lex\r\nde ambitu, forbade candidacies in absentia.[2757] Amid the troubles\r\nconnected with the Catilinarian conspiracy Cicero found time for an\r\nattempt to relieve the provincials of one of the most flagrant abuses\r\ninflicted on them by the senatorial oligarchy. To increase the dignity\r\nand lessen the expense of a member while travelling even on private\r\nbusiness through the provinces, the senate was accustomed to have the\r\noffice of public legatus conferred on him by a magistrate, which honor\r\nat the same time implied the right to be absent from sessions of the\r\nsenate.[2758] In this capacity a senator represented the state,[2759]\r\nand could have lictors assigned him by the provincial governors.[2760]\r\nAbuses of this privilege were to the provincials an especially vexatious\r\nform of oppression.[2761] Cicero’s first rogation on the subject proposed\r\nto abolish the free legation, but when a tribune in the service of the\r\nilliberals interceded, the measure before enactment was so weakened as\r\nto limit the privilege of any one person to a single year,[2762] and\r\nhence did little to remedy the mischief.[2763] There was in fact no hope\r\nfor the provincials either from the avaricious plutocrats or the hungry\r\nproletarians.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the years between the consulships of Cicero and\r\nCaesar, 63-59, involved no important principle. To prevent the\r\nintroduction of forged statutes in the archives,[2764] a law of D.\r\nJunius Silanus and L. Licinius Murena, consuls in 62, forbade the filing\r\nof a statute in the aerarian archives excepting in the presence of\r\nwitnesses.[2765] In this year M. Porcius Cato and L. Marcius, tribunes\r\nof the plebs, carried a law which threatened with punishment commanders\r\nwho reported falsely to the senate the number of the enemy killed and\r\nof citizens lost, and required them within ten days after returning to\r\nthe city to give their oath before the urban quaestors that they had\r\ntransmitted correct reports.[2766] For the year 60 must be mentioned the\r\npretorian law of Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos, which abolished vectigalia\r\nin Italy,[2767] and the tribunician rogation of L. Flavius for granting\r\nlands to Pompey’s veterans. The latter failed through the disapproval\r\nof the senate.[2768] Far more interesting because of the procedure,\r\nthough otherwise of little consequence, was the tribunician rogation of\r\nHerennius of the same year for transferring P. Clodius to the plebeian\r\nrank. The subject has been considered in an earlier chapter.[2769]\r\n\r\nThe year of Caesar’s consulship was one of unusual legislative activity.\r\nResuming the agrarian policy of the Gracchi, which had been undone by\r\nthe statute of 111,[2770] he promulgated early in the year a bill for\r\nthe distribution of lands, which exempted the Campanian[2771] and\r\nStellatine[2772] territory as well as that of Volaterrae, which Sulla\r\nhad confiscated without ejecting the inhabitants.[2773] As little other\r\npublic land remained in Italy, the bill ordered that money accruing\r\nfrom the sale of booty taken by Pompey, and from the new revenues of\r\nthe territory he had won for Rome, be used for the purchase of lands\r\nfrom those who were willing to sell at the values assessed in the last\r\ncensus.[2774] The beneficiaries were the needy citizens and the veterans\r\nof Pompey.[2775] The lots assigned were to remain inalienable twenty\r\nyears.[2776] The work of distribution was to be in the hands of a board\r\nof twenty—vigintiviri[2777]—which should not include the author of\r\nthe law.[2778] A sub-committee of this large board must have been the\r\nVviri agris dandis adsignandis iudicandis,[2779] who in the opinion\r\nof Mommsen[2780] possessed the sole judicial power connected with the\r\nwork of distribution. As the senate studiously delayed action on the\r\nmeasure, though unable to offer any criticism,[2781] Caesar without its\r\nsanction presented the bill to the people.[2782] Bibulus, his colleague,\r\nbacked by three tribunes of the plebs, not only protested against\r\nthe bill,[2783] but resorted to sky-watching and the proclamation of\r\nfestivals to prevent its adoption.[2784] Disregarding this opposition,\r\nCaesar with the support of Pompey and Crassus offered his rogation to the\r\ntribes,[2785] who accepted it with great enthusiasm. For the remainder of\r\nhis term he ignored the senate in all his legislation. As to his other\r\nagrarian provisions, it is difficult to determine whether they were\r\nattached to this rogation before its enactment or formed a new bill.\r\nIn favor of the second alternative it is to be noticed in the first\r\nplace that Cicero and others mention Julian agrarian laws,[2786] and\r\nthat Cicero’s expression “Campanian lex”[2787] could describe a measure\r\nrelating to the Campanian territory but not the whole group of agrarian\r\nprovisions of that year. Moreover although Cicero was acquainted with\r\nthe Julian rogation from the beginning of the year,[2788] he did not\r\nat Formiae hear of the inclusion of the Campanian territory till near\r\nthe end of April.[2789] It might be assumed that after the senate and\r\nBibulus showed opposition Caesar modified the original rogation before\r\nputting it to vote, but no mention is made of an alteration. Finally Dio\r\nCassius[2790] and Plutarch[2791] speak distinctly of an earlier and a\r\nlater law.[2792] On the whole it seems probable therefore that toward the\r\nend of April Caesar promulgated a second agrarian bill which provided\r\nfor the distribution of the Campanian and Stellatine lands among needy\r\ncitizens, preferably those who had three or more children.[2793] The\r\ncomplete execution of the law would dispose of all public lands in Italy\r\nfrom which a revenue might be derived. An article required not only\r\nsenators within a specified time to swear that they would support the\r\nmeasures[2794] but also candidates for office for the following year to\r\ngive their oath in contio that they would not propose any modification or\r\nrepeal of them.[2795]\r\n\r\nThis statute was full of significance both in content and in the manner\r\nof enactment: it set at defiance the senate and the auspices; it deprived\r\nthe state of important revenues, increasing correspondingly the financial\r\nburden on the provinces; it brought relief to many proletarians, while\r\nencouraging militarism through a provision for Pompey’s veterans.\r\nOstensibly democratic, it cemented and announced to the world the\r\ntriumvirate of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey—a combination of democratic,\r\nplutocratic, and military bossism, which proved more dangerous to\r\npolitical liberty than had been the dictatorship of Sulla. The last\r\ngreat agrarian law of the republic contained in itself a prophecy of the\r\nmonarchy which its author was soon to establish.\r\n\r\nBecause of the losses suffered in Asia in the recent war with\r\nMithridates, Caesar carried a law, also early in the year, for a\r\nremission of a third of the sum due to the treasury from the publicans\r\nof that province. As the senate had failed to pass a measure of relief\r\nfor the contractors of revenue,[2796] the concession from Caesar and the\r\npeople served to alienate the feelings of the knights from the optimates\r\nand to attach them to the ambitious consul.[2797] Next to the agrarian\r\nstatute, however, the lex de pecuniis repetundis was the most important\r\npiece of legislation of his consulship. Comprising at least a hundred\r\nand one articles,[2798] including much material from earlier laws on\r\nextortion, it dealt minutely with all the particulars of the offence,\r\nprocedure, and punishment so exhaustively as to render further comitial\r\nlegislation on the subject unnecessary.[2799] It aimed to protect\r\nalike citizens, provincials, and allies from every form of misrule and\r\noppression by the home and promagisterial authorities. It regulated\r\nstrictly the supplies due from the provincials to the promagistrate and\r\nhis officium, including shelter and sustenance for man and beast.[2800]\r\nUnder this law the governor was forbidden without an order from Rome\r\nto conduct diplomatic business with foreign states, to wage war, or to\r\ncross the boundary of his province,[2801] or to demand of the cities\r\ncrown gold for a triumph not decreed by the senate.[2802] On retiring\r\nfrom his command he was to leave copies of his administrative accounts in\r\ntwo cities of his province and an exact duplicate in the aerarium.[2803]\r\nIt provided further for the punishment of corrupt accusers, jurors, and\r\nwitnesses in cases under the law.[2804] A man convicted of the crime\r\nwas fined and compelled to restore extorted property; and in case his\r\nestate did not suffice to cover the loss, an investigation could be made\r\nas to who had shared his gains.[2805] He was also to be expelled from\r\nthe senate and banished.[2806] The severity of the law is commended by\r\nCicero.[2807] Caesar’s legislation concerning extortion was reënforced\r\n(i) by the judiciary law of P. Vatinius, tribune of the plebs, of the\r\nsame year, which granted to both accuser and accused greater freedom in\r\nthe rejection of jurors than had been allowed by the corresponding law\r\nof Sulla, the terms of which however are not definitely known;[2808]\r\n(2) by a statute of Q. Fufius Calenus, praetor in 59, which required the\r\nthree decuries to deposit their votes in three separate urns, the object\r\nbeing to establish class responsibility.[2809] The remaining comitial\r\nacts of Caesar were merely administrative. As a favor to Pompey, who in\r\nhis eastern campaign had received support from Ptolemy Auletes, king of\r\nEgypt,[2810] Caesar in the beginning of his consulship[2811] carried a\r\nresolution for acknowledging the latter as an ally and friend of the\r\nRoman people.[2812] Later in the year, to repay Pompey for his support\r\nof the agrarian statute, Caesar secured against the will of the senate\r\nthe enactment of a law for confirming his ally’s arrangements in the\r\nEast.[2813] Lastly may be mentioned the lex curiata for the arrogation\r\nof P. Clodius Pulcher proposed by Caesar in the capacity of pontifex\r\nmaximus, a measure considered in an earlier chapter.[2814] Clodius wished\r\nto qualify himself for the tribunate of the plebs, and his design was\r\naided by Caesar in the expectation that he would occupy the attention of\r\nCicero, the only strong opponent of the triumviri. Caesar’s immediate\r\nfuture was provided for by a plebiscite of his friend Vatinius, which\r\ngranted him Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum as a province for five years\r\nbeginning March 1, 59.[2815] He was to have three legions[2816] and to\r\nname his own legati, who were to enjoy propretorian rank.[2817] The\r\nsenate, which had looked unwillingly upon these proceedings, now added\r\nComata and a fourth legion, partly because of the conviction that in the\r\nface of an imminent war with the Helvetians no one would be willing to\r\ntake that province without Cisalpina as a support, and partly through\r\nfear lest the popular party might gain the additional credit of bestowing\r\nit.[2818] In one respect the position was far better than that held by\r\nPompey in the East: while winning prestige in a popular conquest[2819]\r\nand attaching to himself a powerful army, Caesar would be near enough to\r\nRome to control the political situation.[2820] Intellectual brilliancy\r\nwould serve in place of experience. In fact, in addition to maintaining\r\nthe position of democratic boss of Rome, the outlook seemed to him\r\nfavorable for wresting from his fellow-triumvir the sceptre of the\r\nmilitary monarch.[2821]\r\n\r\nP. Clodius Pulcher, tribune of the plebs in 58, seems to have worked\r\npartly as an agent of Caesar for the more complete organization of\r\ndemocracy, and partly from motives of personal hatred for Cicero.\r\nHe first proposed a frumentarian plebiscite, which provided for the\r\nabsolutely free distribution of grain monthly among the citizens resident\r\nin Rome.[2822] In vain the optimates complained that the abolition of the\r\nexisting price, which was that prescribed by the Sempronian law,[2823]\r\nwould rob the treasury of nearly a fifth of its income.[2824] Accepted\r\nby the tribes, the law proved a most effective means of maintaining a\r\nnumerous mob of proletarians ever present and willing to vote for the\r\nmeasures of their political patrons, the leaders of the democracy.\r\nA closely related plebiscite permitted the free organization of\r\nclubs (collegia),[2825] which a senatus consultum of 64 had strictly\r\nlimited,[2826] but which now became an active part of the democratic\r\norganization.[2827] His legislation, however, was not utterly devoid of\r\nstatesmanship. A third act, by repealing those articles of the Aelian and\r\nFufian statutes which applied obnuntiations to law-making assemblies,\r\ndeprived the nobility of their most effective means of controlling\r\nlegislation.[2828] An article of the same statute declared all dies fasti\r\navailable for legislation.[2829] This measure went far toward abolishing\r\na usage which had made religion a mockery and public life a farce. To\r\nlimit the arbitrary power of the censors, Clodius enacted through a\r\nplebiscite that these magistrates should place their stigma upon those\r\nonly whom they had jointly condemned after having heard sufficient\r\ntestimony.[2830] Another comitial act prohibited the secretaries of the\r\nquaestors from engaging in business in the provinces.[2831] The last\r\nthree statutes mentioned were useful reforms. His most famous measure was\r\nthe law which prescribed the penalty of interdict from fire and water\r\nfor any one who had put to death a Roman citizen without trial.[2832]\r\nStrengthening the Sempronian law of appeal,[2833] it forced the party\r\nissue as to the question whether that act could apply to persons accused\r\nof having attempted to overthrow the state. The optimates contended that\r\nsuch persons were no longer citizens but enemies and hence outside the\r\npale of law[2834]—a principle which the populares held to be destructive\r\nof liberty. From a democratic point of view the Clodian law was just\r\nand necessary; but unfortunately Cicero, who in putting to death the\r\nassociates of Catiline had simply acted for the senate, was to be made\r\nthe scapegoat. Fearing condemnation under the law, Cicero voluntarily\r\nretired into exile, whereupon a new plebiscite declared the interdict\r\nto be legally in operation.[2835] In the following year he was recalled\r\nwith great enthusiasm by a resolution of the comitia centuriata proposed\r\nby the consuls P. Cornelius Lentulus and Q. Caecilius Metellus.[2836]\r\nThe same magistrates were authors of a law for conferring upon Pompey\r\nthe care of the grain supply, which he was to administer five years with\r\nunlimited proconsular imperium.[2837] In spite of such efforts to prop\r\nup his power in order to counterpoise that of Caesar, the latter through\r\nthe prestige of his brilliant victories in Gaul and the liberal use of\r\nmoney in the capital far outshone his fellow-triumviri. The only hope\r\nfor their ambition was to be found in the good will and favor of the\r\ngreat proconsul. As the result of the conference held by the triumviri\r\nat Luca, 56, Pompey and Crassus were elected to a second consulship for\r\n55 through the votes of Caesar’s soldiers, who were given a furlough to\r\nattend the comitia held purposely late in the year.[2838] As proconsuls\r\nPompey and Crassus were to be given advantageous commands, and Caesar\r\nwas to receive as his reward a prolongation of his governorship.[2839]\r\nSubservient tribunes were found to propose the desired measures, and\r\nit had long been an easy matter to obtain a majority in favor of any\r\nconceivable bill. C. Trebonius drew up a law for granting Syria to\r\nCrassus and the two Spains to Pompey for a period of five years, with a\r\ndispensation for both from that article of the lex Iulia repetundarum\r\nwhich forbade promagistrates of their own free will to declare war.[2840]\r\nThe intercessions of tribunes and all other opposition were violently\r\noverborne, and the rogation was readily accepted by the people.[2841]\r\nThereupon the two consuls secured the passage of an act for extending\r\nCaesar’s command.[2842]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that these consuls had been elected with the\r\nhelp of the clubs organized under the Clodian law of 58, they must have\r\nfelt such associations to be a menace to themselves as well as to the\r\npublic peace. Crassus accordingly carried through the assembly a lex de\r\nsodaliciis, which increased the penalty for ambitus committed through\r\nthe agency of clubs.[2843] It also ordered that the jury in such cases\r\nbe made up by the accuser from any four tribes he should choose, however\r\nunfavorable they might be to the accused,[2844] who had merely the\r\nright to reject one of the four tribal decuries thus presented,[2845]\r\nin so far as the court itself did not grant him the further privilege\r\nof rejecting individuals.[2846] It is difficult to understand how\r\nimpartial justice could be administered under such a law. But no further\r\nlegislation concerning ambitus was attempted till 52, when Pompey in\r\nhis third consulship carried a statute which increased the penalty for\r\nthe offence and made the procedure more strict.[2847] The attention of\r\nPompey in his second consulship was directed rather to other classes of\r\ncrimes. First he had a statute adopted concerning parricide (the murder\r\nof a near relative or patron), which hitherto had been provided for\r\nby the Cornelian lex de sicariis et veneficis.[2848] His project for\r\ndisplacing the lex Iulia repetundarum by a statute which should make\r\nthe non-senatorial class specifically responsible failed to become a\r\nlaw.[2849] A sumptuary rogation for restricting personal expenditure\r\nhe voluntarily withdrew on the advice of Hortensius, who persuaded him\r\nthat luxury and delicacy of life were but the fitting adornments of\r\nempire.[2850] His lex iudiciaria ordered the urban praetor to begin the\r\nselection of jurors from the wealthiest of each of the three classes, and\r\nthence to descend gradually to the poorer members, the object being to\r\nmake the composition of the courts as aristocratic as the terms of the\r\nAurelian statute of 70 would allow.[2851] The lex de vi of his third\r\nconsulship, 52, was merely for the appointment of a special commission to\r\ntry those who were accused of having murdered Clodius, burned the Curia,\r\nand besieged the house of the interrex M. Aemilius Lepidus. It determined\r\nthe composition of the court and the penalty to be inflicted.[2852]\r\nOf his statute de iure magistratuum, passed in the latter year, that\r\narticle only is known which reiterated the law of 63 for prohibiting\r\ncandidacies in absentia. But as a plebiscite had been passed earlier in\r\nthe year to dispense Caesar from the law of 63,[2853] and as Pompey did\r\nnot dare antagonize him by abolishing the plebiscite here mentioned, he\r\nsecured the adoption of an additional law for excepting such candidates\r\nas had been or should be dispensed by comitial action.[2854] But Caesar’s\r\nprospect of passing immediately from his Gallic command to a second\r\nconsulship was more effectually blocked by Pompey’s lex de provinciis,\r\nwhich, embodying a senatus consultum of the previous year,[2855]\r\nordered that five years should intervene between the expiration of a\r\nmagistracy and the beginning of the corresponding promagistracy.[2856]\r\nThe general purpose was to dampen the ardor of the ambitious, who sought\r\npraetorships and consulships merely as a stepping-stone to lucrative and\r\ninfluential commands in the provinces. Its immediate effect, however,\r\nwas to precipitate the conflict between Caesar and Pompey which brought\r\nthe republic to ruin. The relation of the law to this event requires\r\nexplanation. In the Pompeian-Licinian act of 55 for prolonging Caesar’s\r\ncommand measures were taken that the senate should not discuss the\r\nquestion of succession to him before March 1, 50. According to the\r\nSempronian law,[2857] therefore, the senate could assign his provinces\r\nto no consuls earlier than those of 49; hence Caesar would continue in\r\ncommand during that year while suing for the consulship for 48. But by\r\nthe Pompeian law of 52 the Sempronian was abolished, and the senate was\r\ngiven an opportunity to appoint a successor to him on or after March 1,\r\n50.[2858]\r\n\r\nFrom the close of the second consulship of Pompey to the beginning of\r\nCaesar’s dictatorship there was no important legislation.[2859]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Decline of the Republican Comitia_\r\n\r\nFROM 49 TO ABOUT 30\r\n\r\nWith the dictatorship of Caesar begins the last stage in the life of the\r\nrepublican comitia. For them it was from the beginning of his supremacy\r\nessentially a time of decline. Although Caesar continued to submit his\r\nplans to the assemblies for legalization, he rapidly concentrated in\r\nhis own person powers and functions hitherto exercised by the people;\r\nand the triumviri, his successors, after a sham-republican interregnum,\r\nconstituted in law as well as in fact a three-headed despot. Mention\r\nwill first be made of the comitial acts which conferred powers and\r\nhonors on Caesar during his life. In 49 when news of his success in\r\nSpain reached Rome, M. Aemilius Lepidus, a partisan who was then urban\r\npraetor, persuaded the tribes to adopt a resolution empowering the author\r\nto name Caesar dictator.[2860] Entering upon this office after his\r\nreturn to Rome, about the end of November, Caesar used it to secure the\r\nratification of laws—to be considered hereafter—and to hold the electoral\r\ncomitia. After eleven days he resigned. At this election he was chosen\r\nconsul with P. Servilius Vatia as colleague.[2861] About the middle of\r\nOctober, 48, when the senate and people heard of the death of Pompey,\r\nthey conferred on him by law (1) absolute judicial authority over the\r\npartisans of Pompey,[2862] (2) the right to make peace and war at his\r\nown pleasure, the pretext being the development of opposition to him\r\nin Africa, (3) the right to be candidate for the consulship five years\r\nin succession,[2863] (4) the dictatorship for an indefinite period, to\r\nwhich he was appointed by his colleague in the consulship,[2864] (5)\r\nthe tribunician authority for life, with the privilege of sitting with\r\nthe tribunes, (6) the right to preside at the election of all patrician\r\nmagistrates, for which reason the comitia were postponed till his return\r\nto the city, (7) the right to assign the pretorian provinces according to\r\nhis own judgment, (8) the right to triumph over Juba, king of Mauretania,\r\nthough at that time he did not know there was to be a war with that\r\nstate.[2865] Near the end of April, 46, when news came of the victory\r\nat Thapsus, the Romans granted him (1) the censoria potestas with the\r\ntitle of praefectus morum for three years, (2) the annual dictatorship\r\nfor ten years, (3) the right to nominate candidates for both ordinary and\r\nextraordinary offices. These powers were doubtless conferred by comitial\r\naction. At the same time great honors were heaped upon him, probably\r\nthrough senatus consulta.[2866] Again in April, 45, after the battle\r\nof Munda honors were showered on him in still greater profusion.[2867]\r\nPolitically the most important were the lifelong, hereditary title of\r\nimperator, which he bore as a second cognomen,[2868] the sole right to\r\ncommand soldiers and to manage the public funds, the privilege of being\r\nconsul ten years in succession (which he did not use), the prefecture\r\nof morals and the dictatorship for life, and finally deification under\r\nthe title of the “Invincible God.”[2869] In fact for the remainder of\r\nhis life there was no cessation in the bestowal of divine and human\r\nhonors. Among those of his last year were the tribunician sanctity[2870]\r\nand the right to have as many wives as he pleased—the latter granted by\r\na plebiscite of C. Helvius Cinna.[2871] The theocratic monarchy which\r\nthe Romans were erecting for him on the ruins of the republic left no\r\nindependence to the senate or the assemblies. The functions of the latter\r\nwere especially abridged by the large power of nominating and appointing\r\nofficials possessed by the monarch.[2872] His important legislative\r\nplans, however, he brought before the people, preferably in their tribal\r\ncomitia.\r\n\r\nIn December, 49, after returning from Spain, Caesar sought to relieve\r\nsomewhat the distress of debtors and at the same time to quiet the\r\ngeneral fear that he might decree a cancellation of all debts.[2873]\r\nThis object he accomplished through a law, (1) that interest already\r\npaid should be deducted from the principal, (2) that the property of the\r\ndebtor should be taken in payment of the balance—not at the low values\r\nthen existing, but on the basis of ante-bellum prices, (3) that no one\r\nshould hoard more than fifteen thousand denarii in cash.[2874] The third\r\narticle was a renewal of an old law.[2875] Another statute,[2876] 47,\r\nreleased from a year’s rent tenants of houses in Rome which brought the\r\nowner more than 2000 sesterces or of houses outside the city which earned\r\nmore than 500.[2877] These houses were private property, and the law was\r\ntherefore a partial abolition of private debts.[2878] Such prosperity\r\ncame that in another year, 46, Caesar found it possible to cut down the\r\nnumber who received free grain from 320,000 to 150,000.[2879] He provided\r\nfor the surplus population as well as for his veterans by colonies in\r\nGaul, Spain, Africa, Macedonia, Greece, and Asia.[2880] Eighty thousand\r\ncitizens found homes in these provincial settlements.[2881]\r\n\r\nAmong Caesar’s most admirable traits was his liberality in restoring to\r\ntheir civil rights those who were under disfranchisement and in granting\r\nthe citizenship to aliens. At his suggestion M. Antonius, tribune of the\r\nplebs in 49, secured the enactment of a plebiscite for restoring the ius\r\nhonorum to the children of those whom Sulla had proscribed.[2882] Near\r\nthe end of the same year, also at his request, the praetors and tribunes\r\nbrought before the people and carried proposals for the recall of certain\r\npersons who had been exiled, unjustly as he believed, under the Pompeian\r\nlaw on ambitus.[2883] It was further at his suggestion that L. Roscius,\r\nprobably praetor, enacted a comitial law for granting the citizenship to\r\nthe Transpadani who at this time possessed simply the ius Latii.[2884]\r\nAnother law of unknown authorship confirmed the grant of the franchise\r\nalready made on his own responsibility to the people of Gades.[2885]\r\n\r\nAmong his administrative improvements was the increase in the number of\r\npraetors from eight to ten[2886] in 47, for which a comitial statute may\r\nbe assumed.[2887] The people surrendered to him a large part of their\r\nelectoral right through the plebiscite of L. Antonius,[2888] December,\r\n45, which granted him the privilege of nominating and presenting to\r\nthe comitia a half of the candidates below the consulship.[2889] The\r\ndegradation into which the ordinary magistracies had been brought by the\r\nsupremacy of Caesar is indicated by the deposition of two tribunes of\r\nthe plebs, C. Epidius Marullus and L. Caesetius Flavus, because of their\r\nopposition to monarchy, 44, through a plebiscite of their colleague, C.\r\nHelvius Cinna.[2890]\r\n\r\nTo the year 46 belongs Caesar’s legislation on judicial matters. First\r\ndisqualifying the tribuni aerarii for jury service,[2891] he ordered\r\nthrough the comitia that the courts be composed exclusively of the\r\nsenators and knights.[2892] The man who had been carried to supreme\r\npower on the shoulders of the common people now spurned even the most\r\nrespectable of their number from association with himself in the\r\nadministration.[2893] It is known that he enacted laws on individual\r\ncrimes.[2894] A lex de vi and a lex de maiestate are mentioned,[2895]\r\nbut it is not known in what they differed from those of earlier or later\r\ndate.[2896] His sumptuary statute of the same year[2897] restricted the\r\nexpense of the table,[2898] sepulchral monuments, dwellings,[2899]\r\nfurniture, clothing, jewels, and other luxuries, covering the ground\r\nin great detail.[2900] A Cassian plebiscite empowered him to recruit\r\nthe patrician rank[2901]—a means of creating a nobility devoted to\r\nhimself, while supplying a religious need. A law proposed by himself (de\r\nprovinciis) limited proconsuls to two years of command and propraetors\r\nto one,[2902] that in future they might not acquire such strength as to\r\noverthrow the civil authority, after the pattern set by the author of\r\nthe regulation. It was by a vote of the people, too, that the famous\r\nlex Iulia municipalis was adopted, probably in the autumn of 46.[2903]\r\nAlthough there has been much controversy regarding the nature of the\r\ndocument,[2904] it is most probably a general municipal statute. Far\r\nfrom exhaustive, it had to be supplemented by special laws for the\r\nseveral cities.[2905] The extant fragment, which seems to begin with the\r\nsecond table, regulates (1) applications of citizens resident at Rome\r\nfor free grain,[2906] (2) the aedilician supervision of the streets,\r\nbuildings, and games of the capital,[2907] (3) the qualifications for\r\nthe magistracies and the decurionate in the municipia,[2908] (4) the\r\nintroduction of the Roman census in the municipia,[2909] and (5) of\r\nindividual Roman statutes in those municipia which enjoyed the laws of\r\nRome.[2910] The inclusion of the capital with the cities of Roman rights\r\nthroughout the empire in one general law marks the first step in the\r\nmonarchical process of reducing Rome to the level of the municipia.[2911]\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the amount of reform work undertaken by Caesar the\r\nlegislative activity of the people was remarkably slight. The growth of\r\nthe monarchy wrought the decline of the comitia as well as of the senate;\r\nand the assassination of the monarch brought equally to the republic and\r\nto the assemblies but a short interval of pretended liberty.[2912] A\r\nlex proposed by the consul M. Antonius confirmed the acts of Caesar and\r\nestablished as law the plans which he left in writing at his death.[2913]\r\nIt was arbitrarily used by the consul for legalizing every whim of his\r\nown. His colonial law, passed shortly after Caesar’s assassination,[2914]\r\nseems to have been used by him for establishing in Italy a permanent\r\nsupport for himself.[2915] The last known agrarian law of the republic\r\nis that of his brother, L. Antonius, tribune of the plebs in the same\r\nyear, 44. It ordered the distribution of the Pomptine marshes—which\r\nthe author asserted were then ready for cultivation[2916]—and other\r\nextensive tracts.[2917] The execution of the measure was in the hands of\r\nseptemviri,[2918] including the author[2919] and his two brothers.[2920]\r\nIt was annulled in the following year by the senate on the ground that it\r\nhad been violently passed.[2921]\r\n\r\nMeantime the consul Antonius continued his legislation. An arbitrary\r\nact restored to the pontifical college its ancient right to appoint its\r\nchief in place of the long-used election by seventeen tribes.[2922]\r\nNext to colonization, however, his chief legislative interest was in\r\nthe reform of the courts. He repealed the Julian statute concerning the\r\nqualifications of jurors;[2923] and instead of restoring the eligibility\r\nof the tribuni aerarii, he made up a third decury of retired centurions\r\nand other veterans.[2924] His law for granting an appeal to the people\r\nfrom the quaestiones de vi and de maiestate,[2925] had it remained in\r\nforce, would as Cicero asserts have abolished these courts and have given\r\nfree rein to mob violence, such as comitial trials for these crimes must\r\nnecessarily be under conditions as they then existed.[2926] Popularity\r\nwas the aim of this measure as well as of his lex which forever abolished\r\nthe dictatorship. Along with all his other laws they were annulled by the\r\nsenate in February 43.[2927]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the triumviri rei publicae constituendae in 43\r\npractically abolished the functions of the comitia, as these three\r\npotentates usurped the right of filling all offices by appointment and of\r\nmanaging affairs according to their pleasure without consulting either\r\nthe senate or the people.[2928] The power they had seized was legalized\r\nfor a period of five years by the plebiscite of P. Titius, November 43,\r\npassed without regard to the trinundinum.[2929] The reference of business\r\nto the people was thereafter a rare indulgence. It may have been through\r\na comitial act that the triumviri resolved upon building a temple to\r\nSerapis and Isis in the first year of their rule.[2930] We are less\r\ncertain that the measure of Octavianus in 41 for a partial remission of\r\nrents was offered to the people.[2931] To the year 40 belongs the lex\r\nFalcidia, of P. Falcidius, tribune of the plebs, which permitted a man\r\nto bequeath no more than three-fourths of his estate, leaving one-fourth\r\nto his natural heirs.[2932] We need not be surprised to find that the\r\nrulers gladly allowed the people to vote them honors. In their first\r\nyear they were awarded civic crowns by a comitial act, doubtless of the\r\ntribes;[2933] and in 35 the honors bestowed upon Octavia and Livia\r\nprobably came through a plebiscite, as did certainly the triumph voted\r\nto Octavianus.[2934] Last may be mentioned the law of L. Saenius, consul\r\nin 30, supported by a senatus consultum, which empowered Octavianus to\r\ncreate new patricians.[2935]\r\n\r\n    Schulze, C.

If the proposer of a\r\nrogation lacked the necessary knowledge, he sought the advice of learned\r\nfriends.[2936] The bill, as first presented to the senate and published\r\nin the city on wooden tablets,[2937] was merely tentative; for discussion\r\nin the senate or the expression of public opinion might suggest\r\nchanges[2938] or even induce the author to withdraw the proposal.[2939]\r\n\r\nAt the head of the law after its adoption was inserted the index and\r\npraescriptio,[2940] of which the consular lex Quinctia de aquaeductibus,\r\naccepted by the tribes in the year 9 B.C., offers a good example:[2941]\r\n\r\n“T. Quinctius Crispinus consul populum iure rogavit, populusque iure\r\nscivit in foro pro rostris aedis divi Iulii pr(idie) _K_ Iulias.\r\nTribus Sergia principium fuit, pro tribu Sex.... L. f. Virro _primus\r\nscivit_.”[2942]\r\n\r\nIt contains the name of the rogator,[2943] his office, the body of\r\ncitizens, whether populus or plebs, to which the proposal is offered,\r\nthe place of the assembly,[2944] the date, the century (praerogativa) or\r\nthe tribe or curia (principium) which voted first, and the name of the\r\ncitizen who has been granted the honor of casting the first vote for his\r\npraerogativa or principium.[2945] If the senate has given its sanction,\r\nthat fact is indicated by the insertion of the phrase “de s(enatus)\r\ns(ententia).”[2946] In case the proposal is by a tribune of the plebs, it\r\nis strictly a plebi scitum; but that its equivalence to a lex may be made\r\nclear, it is described as a lex plebeive scitum.[2947]\r\n\r\nThe body of the law is divided into chapters separated by spaces,\r\nsometimes numbered, and occasionally bearing individual titles.[2948]\r\nLast comes the sanction,[2949] which provides for the enforcement. Some\r\nlaws, however,—termed leges imperfectae—lack this part.[2950] Usually the\r\nsanction prescribes the form of procedure according to which offenders\r\nare to be tried.[2951]\r\n\r\nIf the author of the new proposal has no desire to disturb any existing\r\nlaw, this fact is indicated by the insertion of the formula E(x) H(ac)\r\nL(ege) N(ihilum) R(ogatur).[2952] As a protection from the operation of\r\nearlier laws left in whole or in part unrepealed by the new statute, the\r\nlatter is provided with a declaration that no attempt is hereby made to\r\nlegalize anything illegal.[2953] By an analogous statement unconscious\r\ntrespassing upon the rights of religion is rendered harmless.[2954] In\r\naccordance with a law of the Twelve Tables[2955] provision is further\r\nmade against the consequences of conflict with other laws by the\r\ndeclaration that if any one in carrying out this law shall trespass\r\nagainst other statutes or senatus consulta, his act shall render him in\r\nno way liable to such earlier laws or decrees.[2956] A provision may\r\nalso be added against illegal alteration or repeal.[2957] Sometimes the\r\nproposer includes an article for compelling senators and magistrates\r\nto uphold his law, should it be enacted,[2958] or for otherwise\r\novercoming opposition to its enforcement,[2959] or for making repeal\r\ndifficult.[2960] It becomes binding from the moment when the author\r\nannounces its adoption by the comitia, excepting in case time has to be\r\ngiven the senators and magistrates for swearing to it.[2961] The law is\r\nthen engraved on a bronze tablet,[2962] the original copy of which is\r\nkept by the quaestors in the aerarium.[2963] Other copies are posted in\r\npublic places where all can read it.[2964]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Comitial Procedure_\r\n\r\nThe tribal assembly convened under the presidency of a tribune or aedile\r\nof the plebs,[2965] in which case the gathering was technically the\r\nplebs;[2966] or as the populus under a patrician magistrate—dictator,\r\nconsul, praetor,[2967] curule aedile,[2968] pontifex maximus,[2969]\r\nor any extraordinary magistrate who possessed the ius agendi cum\r\npopulo.[2970] It met indifferently within or without the pomerium,\r\nusually on the Capitoline hill in the precinct of the temple of\r\nJupiter,[2971] in the Forum and comitium,[2972] the Campus Martius,[2973]\r\nand within the latter in the Flaminian meadow or Flaminian Circus.[2974]\r\nMeetings called by tribunes had to convene within the first milestone,\r\nwhich bounded the authority of these officials,[2975] whereas we hear\r\nof a tribal assembly called by a consul in the military camp at Sutrium\r\n(357).[2976] The contio, described in an earlier chapter, was transformed\r\ninto comitia by order of the presiding magistrate directing the people\r\nto take their places in their respective tribes.[2977] Before this\r\ncommand was given a tribe was drawn by lot to receive the Latins who\r\nwere at Rome.[2978] A second tribe was then drawn as a principium\r\nto cast the first vote.[2979] The bringing of the urn[2980] and the\r\nsortition were the last acts of the contio. To facilitate the division\r\nropes were stretched across the Forum or other assembly-place, forming\r\nas many compartments as there were tribes.[2981] In time a permanent\r\nenclosure, termed Saepta,[2982] was built for the comitia.[2983] If the\r\nmagistrate found that an entire tribe was absent, he assigned to it for\r\nthe occasion a few citizens from some other, in order that in theory all\r\nthirty-five tribes—the universus populus Romanus—might be present.[2984]\r\nAfter the tribes were assembled in their comitia as here described,\r\nthe principium was called to vote. This point terminated the right\r\nof intercession[2985] and of obnuntiating an evil omen discovered in\r\nwatching the sky.[2986] When the suffrage of the principium was given and\r\nannounced,[2987] all the remaining tribes voted simultaneously.[2988] In\r\nearlier time a rogator stood at the exit of each saeptum, and received\r\nthe oral votes of the citizens as they passed out one by one.[2989] After\r\nthe introduction of the ballot,[2990] the state provided little tablets\r\ninscribed with abbreviations for “ut rogas” and “antiquo” for affirmative\r\nand negative votes respectively,[2991] and for elections blank tablets\r\non which the names of the candidates could be written.[2992] They were\r\ndeposited in boxes (cistae) placed at the exits above mentioned,[2993]\r\nunder the charge of rogatores, who, having lost their original function,\r\nwere now often, and more aptly, called custodes.[2994] They counted\r\n(diribitio) the ballots, and reported (renuntiatio) the results to the\r\npresident.[2995] The latter had a right to announce to the public the\r\nreturns from the tribes in whatever order he pleased, but he usually\r\npreferred to determine the succession by lot.[2996] In the election of\r\nany college of magistrates each citizen voted for as many candidates as\r\nthere were places to be filled, and the announcements for each continued\r\ntill a majority was reached in his favor. Precedence in honor within the\r\ncollege depended upon priority of election.[2997] The declaration of the\r\nvote by the praeco at the command of the president closed the comitial\r\nact.[2998] If for any reason the presiding magistrate discontinued\r\nthe announcement before a majority was reached, the vote was without\r\neffect.[2999] The session of any assembly had to begin and end between\r\nsunrise and sunset.[3000]\r\n\r\nThe comitia curiata, presided over by the king, the interrex, and\r\npossibly by the tribunus celerum,[3001] and in the republican period\r\nby the dictator,[3002] consul,[3003] interrex,[3004] praetor,[3005]\r\npontifex maximus,[3006] or rex sacrorum,[3007] met always within the\r\npomerium,[3008] usually in the comitium,[3009] or for religious purposes\r\nin front of the Curia Calabra on the Capitoline hill.[3010] It was\r\ncalled together by a curiate lictor[3011] at the sound of the lituus or\r\ntuba.[3012] The procedure, which in general was like that of the tribal\r\nassembly, and which has been touched upon in the chapters on the comitia\r\ncalata and curiata, does not require further consideration here.[3013]\r\n\r\nThe comitia centuriata could be summoned for voting by no magistrates\r\nin their own name and under their own auspices excepting those who were\r\nvested with the imperium[3014]—the dictator, consul, interrex for holding\r\nelections, the praetor for judicial business,[3015] and all extraordinary\r\nmagistrates with consular power. The duoviri perduellioni iudicandae, the\r\nquaestors, and the tribunes of the plebs could summon this assembly for\r\njudicial business under the auspices only of a magistrate cum imperio, as\r\nthe consul or more especially the praetor.[3016] It always met outside\r\nthe pomerium, usually in the Campus Martius,[3017] at the call of an\r\naccensus, who sounded the trumpet (classicum) at daybreak along the city\r\nwall.[3018] During the session the citizens in the assembly could see a\r\nflag waving above the Janiculum to signify that this post was occupied by\r\na garrison as a protection for the city while they were engaged outside\r\nin a public duty.[3019] As in the case of the tribal assembly, the contio\r\nwas transformed into comitia by an order of the president commanding\r\nthe citizens to separate into their respective voting groups.[3020] The\r\nplace of meeting, termed ovile[3021] (sheepfold), was divided by ropes\r\nor wooden fences into as many compartments as there were centuries in\r\nthe largest voting division—probably eighty-seven.[3022] An elevated\r\npassage (pons) formed the exit of each compartment.[3023] The members of\r\na century, while passing out one by one, gave their votes to the rogator,\r\nin the same way as the tribesmen in the comitia tributa. After the ballot\r\nwas introduced, it was used in all assemblies alike.[3024] The order\r\nof voting before and after the reform has been sufficiently explained\r\nin an earlier chapter.[3025] In general the principles governing the\r\nannouncement of votes, interruptions, and adjournments were the same\r\nfor all three assemblies. The length of the assemblies must have varied\r\naccording to the form of organization, the number of voters present, and\r\nvarious other circumstances. In the time of Caesar the process in the\r\ncomitia centuriata, on an occasion in which there was no delay, lasted\r\nfive hours.[3026] We should therefore assume at least an hour for the\r\nvoting of the tribes.[3027]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Comitial Days_\r\n\r\nThe people could meet for voting on comitial days only[3028]—marked\r\n=C= in the calendar.[3029] They excluded the dies nefasti—marked =N=,\r\n=NP=, or =NF=—on which religion forbade that public business should be\r\ndone.[3030] They excluded further the two days marked Q(uando) R(ex)\r\nC(omitiavit) F(as),[3031] the one day marked Q(uando) ST(ercus) D(eletum)\r\nF(as)[3032]—because on these days it was impossible to open the assembly\r\nin the morning as usage prescribed—and the eight days marked =EN=,[3033]\r\nthe morning and evening of which were alone nefasti, the intervening\r\npart being free for business. Equally distinct from the comitial days\r\nwere the dies fasti non comitiales, marked =F=, and in this volume\r\ntermed simply fasti.[3034] They were reserved for judicial business.\r\nThe pre-Julian year contained a hundred and eight nefasti[3035] and\r\nforty-five fasti, leaving a hundred and ninety-one comitial days.[3036]\r\nThe ten days added by Caesar are all marked =F=.[3037] It is to be\r\nnoticed, however, that those days marked =C= on which fell in any year\r\nextraordinary or changeable festivals were thereby rendered unfit for\r\ncomitia.[3038]\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that in early time market-days (nundinae) were\r\nnot wholly devoted to trade[3039] and to the settlement of cases\r\nat law,[3040] but that they could be used equally well for voting\r\nassemblies,[3041] till the Hortensian statute of 287 declared those\r\nmarked =F= and =C= to be fasti, reserving them thus for judicial business\r\nand prohibiting from them voting assemblies of every kind.[3042] The\r\ngeneral tendency during the republic was to restrict the power of the\r\npeople by lessening the number of days on which they could meet for\r\npassing resolutions.[3043]\r\n\r\n    Lange, _Römische Altertümer_, ii. 649-54; Madvig, _Verfass, und\r\n    Verw. d. röm.

Thus the Romans created the comitia curiata. Not only the\r\ncuriae, but also the later centuries, classes, and tribes, originally\r\nexisted independently of the assembly for various administrative purposes\r\nand were brought into connection with that institution as convenient\r\nsystems of organization. At first ceremonial, the comitia curiata came\r\nto be used for voting on resolutions. Gradually reducing this earliest\r\norganized gathering to a formality, the Romans successively introduced\r\nthe centuriate and the tribal comitia. Excepting for brief, transitional\r\nperiods the assembly, whatever its form, admitted all citizens who\r\npossessed the right of suffrage. Its power was at first slight vague, and\r\nchiefly receptive. Though in the regal period the people occasionally\r\napproved or rejected judicial sentences, administrative plans, and even\r\nproposals for changes in existing customs submitted to them by the\r\nking of his own free will, the only function which at that time they\r\ndefinitely acquired was the election of their chief magistrate.\r\n\r\nFrom the founding of the republic to the decemviral legislation (509-450)\r\nthe magistrates and senate exercised almost absolute control over the\r\nadministration. At the very beginning the comitia centuriata—a newly\r\nestablished timocratic institution—assumed the right to enact laws, which\r\nfor a long time were substantially limited to matters directly affecting\r\nthe constitution; and the alleged Valerian centuriate statute made of\r\nthis body a supreme court to which any citizen condemned on a capital\r\ncharge was granted the privilege of appeal. In practice, however, the law\r\nbenefited those only of high rank who were accused of political crimes.\r\nMeantime a new, more democratic assembly under the presidency of tribunes\r\nof the plebs, meeting by tribes after 471, usurped an extensive though\r\nill-defined power of fining and capitally condemning offenders against\r\nthe sanctity of plebeian officials. But this function, resting upon an\r\nact of the plebs only and enforced by threats of violence, was almost\r\nnullified by patrician opposition. It was doubtless in this period that\r\nvoting by heads arose in the comitia centuriata, whence it was adopted by\r\nthe other assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe Twelve Tables (451-450) confirmed the comitia centuriata in the\r\nrights it had previously assumed; and if not expressly, at least\r\nby implication they granted legislative and judicial power to the\r\ntribunician assembly of tribes. A Valerian-Horatian statute of 449\r\nprovided that resolutions approved by the senate and carried by the\r\nlatter assembly should have the force of law, just as from the beginning\r\nthe senatorial sanction (patrum auctoritas) was essential to the validity\r\nof curiate and centuriate resolutions and elections. At the same time\r\nin conformity with a law of the Twelve Tables an arrangement was made\r\nby which the tribunes should bring their finable actions before the\r\ntribes and those of a capital nature before the centuries. Soon afterward\r\nthe patrician magistrates began to use the tribes for the election of\r\ninferior officials and occasionally for the ratification of laws.\r\n\r\nDuring the century following the decemviral legislation (450-358) the\r\nalmost absolute administrative power of the senate and magistrates\r\nremained but slightly affected by the comitia. The appointment of a\r\ndictator or the establishment of a special judicial commission placed the\r\ncitizens at the mercy of the government. Although the comitia centuriata\r\nacquired the right to ratify or reject declarations of offensive war\r\n(427) and though the tribunes succeeded in enacting a few important\r\nplebiscites, like the Canuleian and the Licinian-Sextian, the people made\r\nlittle progress toward the free exercise of legislative and judicial\r\nfunctions. With the enactment of a lex de ambitu in 358 the tribes\r\nbegan to legislate concerning magistrates, with reference not only to\r\ncandidacy and qualifications but soon also to powers and functions and\r\nto the creation of new offices. They passed laws on finance and religion\r\nand on the qualification and appointment of senators; they assumed\r\nthe function of ratifying or rejecting proposals for peace (321) and\r\nof admitting aliens to citizenship. The tribes and the centuries began\r\nregularly to exercise appellate jurisdiction. About the same time the\r\npeople acquired the function of appointing special judicial commissions,\r\nand subjected the dictator to the law of appeal. In an effort to throw\r\noff the control exercised by the nobility the Publilian statute of 339\r\nexcluded patricians from the tribunician assembly of tribes (a regulation\r\nafterward silently abandoned), and in 287 that of Hortensius rendered the\r\napproval of the senate and of the patrician portion of it unessential\r\nto the validity of the plebiscite. Meanwhile in administrative and in\r\nconstitutional legislation the comitia tributa made great gains at the\r\nexpense of the senate and magistrates and of the centuriate assembly.\r\n\r\nThe period extending from 358 to 287 was accordingly the first great\r\nage of comitial legislative and judicial activity. The strong popular\r\ntendency then manifested might have created a real democracy, had it\r\nnot been for (1) the cleverness of the nobles in gaining control of the\r\nplebeian tribunate and in using religion as a check on comitial freedom.\r\n(2) the rapid expansion of the Roman power, which drew the public mind\r\naway from internal politics, and which rendered the assembly not only\r\nan inadequate representative of the citizens but also incompetent for\r\nthe functions devolving upon it. Many years passed, however, before this\r\nincompetency became serious. Though henceforth the comitia were in theory\r\nsovereign, they remained limited by a want of initiative both in the act\r\nof assembling and in the offering of resolutions, by the lack of free\r\ndeliberation, by the tribunician veto, and by the oblative auspices.\r\nAfter the enactment of the Hortensian statute the comitia tributa enjoyed\r\nalmost exclusive possession of the legislative function. The larger share\r\nfell to the tribunician assembly, which excelled in aggressiveness, and\r\nwhich admitted as much freedom of debate as was consistent with the\r\nspirit of the constitution—hence it was preferably termed concilium.\r\nNotwithstanding these relative advantages of the tribal assembly the\r\nadverse conditions above mentioned led to an era of comitial stagnation\r\n(287-232), at the close of which the tribunate of C. Flaminius brought\r\na new outburst of activity (232-201). The assemblies now recovered all\r\nthey had lost in the preceding age and made fresh gains. Noteworthy\r\nare the sumptuary, monetary, private, and family statutes, and the\r\nrecognition of the right of the people to grant dispensations from\r\nexisting laws. In the opinion of Polybius the constitution was in this\r\ntime at its best. The nobles admitted the theory of popular sovereignty,\r\nas they could well afford to do in view of their thorough control of\r\nall governmental institutions. In the era of the completed plutocracy\r\n(201-134) they regularly resorted to the comitia in matters of little\r\npolitical importance or in those in which they felt certain of the\r\nresults. Under these conditions fewer laws were enacted for the benefit\r\nof the masses. The policy of the nobles was to repress individual freedom\r\nby subjecting both magistrates and assemblies to the plutocratic machine.\r\nEven the comitial judicia were subordinated to this end; and toward the\r\nclose of the period the people in establishing permanent courts began\r\nthrough legislation to surrender their judicial power to the senatorial\r\nclass, while the senate, on the other hand, resumed the function of\r\ndispensing from the laws and of appointing special courts. In these ways\r\nthe nobility was making great inroads on popular liberty.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the revolutionary period (134-30) the tribal\r\nassembly, liberated for a time from servitude to the plutocracy, became\r\nunder the presidency of reforming tribunes the ruling power at Rome. Its\r\nactivity not only embraced the whole field of administration but was\r\ndirected by the Gracchi to the creation of a new political constitution\r\nand to the regeneration of society. But its variable composition\r\nprecluded consistency of action. Though at times, as when controlled\r\nby the rural element of the citizen body, it could be induced to adopt\r\nliberal, statesmanlike measures such as the agrarian and colonial laws\r\nof the Gracchi, the usual dominance of the ignorant and unprincipled\r\npoor of the metropolis inclined it to a short-sighted, selfish course\r\nof conduct—rendering it a powerful weapon in the hands either of the\r\ndemagogue or of the plutocratic senate, equally effective for resisting\r\ngenuine reforms and for destroying the institutions of the republic.\r\nAs with the progress of the revolution the conservative checks began\r\nto weaken and disappear, the comitia became more and more subject\r\nto violence and coercion. The comitial prosecutions of this period\r\npartook of the same revolutionary character. From the time of Sulla the\r\nassemblies were overshadowed by the military power. Under his dictation\r\nthey surrendered to the senatorial courts nearly all that remained of\r\ntheir judicial function, and they seriously crippled their legislative\r\npower in favor of a reaction to the pre-Hortensian constitution. After\r\na brief interval of bondage to the senate (81-70) they recovered their\r\nlegislative freedom, only to subserve for the future the alliance now\r\nformed between the tribunes of the plebs and the great proconsuls. From\r\nthe accession of Julius Cæesar to the dictatorship (49) their power\r\nrapidly declined. They yielded to him a large share of their legislative\r\nand even of their elective function. After a brief period of pretended\r\nliberty following the assassination of the dictator, they lapsed with the\r\nfall of the republic into utter insignificance.\r\n\r\nThe comitia had filled a large place in the history of the state. They\r\nwere the chief factor of constitutional progress and of beneficent\r\nlegislation. Their development and decline involved the prosperity and\r\nthe ruin of the republic. For the world they have a higher value. The\r\ntribal assembly, supporting the plebeian tribunate, was the storm centre\r\nof long, heroic struggles for human rights. The fact that it championed\r\nthis cause, that it met with some success in the conflict, that a\r\nGracchus deemed it worthy to undertake the social regeneration of the\r\nworld, has given the institution a universal and a permanent interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this list are excluded the titles of all works which, treating\r\nof other than Roman institutions, are referred to in this volume for\r\ncomparative purposes, and of all sources which are accessible in\r\nwell-known, standard editions.\r\n\r\n    Abbott, F.

Schrader, _Reallex._ 920\r\nf., accepts this explanation as most probable, and connecting it with\r\nSkt. cakrá-, interprets it as referring to a wheel formation of the army.\r\nBut Vaniček, _Griech.-lat. etym. Wörterb._ 1085 f., connects populari\r\nwith spol-iu-m.\r\n\r\n[2] Curtius, _Griech. Etym._ 260, English, 344; Corssen, _Ausspr._ i.\r\n368, 422; Vaniček, _Etym. Wörterb. d. lat.

Rom._, 51 f.\r\n\r\n[3] This interpretation would explain magister populi and populari.\r\nPlebs, on the other hand, denoted the multitude as distinguished from the\r\nleaders; hence it differed from populus, notwithstanding Herzog, _Röm.\r\nStaatsverf._ i. 98, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[4] Cf.

Alt._ 612 ff.\r\n\r\n[8] “Arma sumere, sacris adesse, concilium inire”; Tac. _Germ._ 6. 6; 13.\r\n1. On the Indo-European relation of the army to the folk, see Schrader,\r\n_Reallex._ 349 f. For Rome, Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 3 f.\r\n\r\n[9] Cic. _Rep._ ii. 8. 14; Dion. Hal. ii. 7. 2; Plut. _Rom._ 14, 20;\r\nOvid, _Fast._ iii. 131; Dio Cass. Frag. 5. 8; Varro, _L. L._ v. 55;\r\nColum. v. 1. 9.\r\n\r\n[10] As Romulus was the eponymous hero of the Ramnes (or of all the\r\nRomans?) and Lucerus (Fest. ep. 119) of the Luceres.\r\n\r\n[11] The original seat of the hero at Rome was on the Capitoline near\r\nthe site of the later temple of Juno Moneta; Plut. _Rom._ 20. It was\r\nclosely connected, therefore, with the auguraculum on the spot; Varro,\r\n_L. L._ v. 47; Cic. _Off._ iii. 16. 66; Fest. ep. 16. Perhaps his name\r\nhas some etymological relation with titiare, “to chirp as a sparrow”;\r\nVarro, _L. L._ v. 85 (titiis avibus); Pais, _Storia di Roma_, I. i. 277\r\nand n. 3; Forcellini, _Lex._ s. v. The Sodales Titii, who attended to his\r\nworship (cf. Dion. Hal. ii. 52. 5; Tac. _Ann._ i. 54; _Hist._ ii. 95)\r\nwere accustomed to take a certain kind of auspices from birds; Varro,\r\nibid. His tomb was in a place called Lauretum on the Aventine (Pais,\r\nibid. 279), confused probably with Laurentum, where he is said to have\r\nbeen killed. All these circumstances indicate that Titus Tatius was an\r\nindigenous Roman, or at most a Latin hero, and that his connection with\r\nthe Sabines is an ill-founded, relatively late idea. The primary origin\r\nof the word Titienses is Etruscan; Schulze, _Lat. Eigennam._ 218.\r\n\r\n[12] Possibly because the rites of the Titian sodales seemed to be Sabine\r\n(cf. Tac. _Ann._ i. 54); but even if they were, this circumstance would\r\nnot make the Titian tribe Sabine.\r\n\r\n[13] Varro, however, placed them on the Aventine. A Sabine settlement on\r\nthe Quirinal has not been proved; cf. Lécrivain, in Daremberg et Saglio,\r\n_Dict._ ii. 1514.\r\n\r\n[14] In Dion. Hal. ii. 47. 4; cf. 7. 2; Plut. _Rom._ 13.\r\n\r\n[15] _L. L._ v. 46, 55; Serv. _in Aen._ v. 560.\r\n\r\n[16] P. 2, n. 6, and n. 1 above.\r\n\r\n[17] Serv. ibid.\r\n\r\n[18] Cf. Hülsen, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iii. 1273.\r\n\r\n[19] Proposed by Niebuhr, _Röm. Gesch._ i. 311 ff., English, i. 153\r\nff. In his opinion the three tribes were of different nationalities.\r\nHis view, with or without the theory of national syncretism, has been\r\naccepted by many scholars, including Schwegler, _Röm. Gesch._ i. 480\r\nff., 497-514; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 82 ff.; Peter, _Gesch. Roms._ i.\r\n60; Madvig, _Röm. Staat._ i. 97 f.; Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 23\r\nf.

Rom._ i. 7; Schrader, _Reallex._\r\n801; Nissen, _Templum_, 145 f.; _Ital. Landesk._ ii. 496.\r\n\r\n[20] Against the view that the three tribes were once independent\r\ncommunities are Volquardsen, in _Rhein. Mus._ xxxiii. 542 ff.; Meyer,\r\n_Gesch. d. Alt._ ii. 510; Lécrivain, in Daremberg et Saglio, _Dict._ ii.\r\n1514 a; Holzapfel, in _Beitr. z. alt. Gesch._ i. 241, 249 ff.; Platner,\r\n_Top. and Mon. of Anc. Rome_, 33. Ihne, _Hist. of Rome_, i. 114, thinks\r\nthey probably had reference only to the army. The double nature of many\r\nRoman institutions—a phenomenon on which scholars chiefly rely for their\r\ntheory of a once existent two-tribe state—may better be explained by the\r\nunion of the Sabines with the Romans after the institution of the three\r\ntribes; as this relatively later date would at the same time explain the\r\nsix-fold character of various institutions. That the union took place at\r\nthe beginning of the fifth century B.C. is believed by Pais, _Storia di\r\nRoma_, I. i. 277. Or the stated increase in the number of members of the\r\nvestals, augurs, pontiffs, and more particularly of senators, may be due\r\nto an ancient theory, dimly hinted at in the sources, of an admission\r\nof the second and third tribes successively to representation in these\r\nbodies; cf. Niebuhr, _Röm. Gesch._ i. 320 f., English, i. 157; Bloch,\r\n_Orig. d. sén._ 32 ff.\r\n\r\n[21] Bormann, in _Eran. Vind._ 345-58, following a hint offered by Niese,\r\n_Röm. Gesch._ (1st ed. 1886) 585, has gone so far as to deny their\r\nexistence, setting them down as an invention of Varro; but Holzapfel, in\r\n_Beitr. z. alt. Gesch._ i. 230 ff., proves that Cicero and other sources\r\ndid not draw from Varro their information regarding the tribes. Against\r\nBormann, see also Pais, ibid. I. i. 279, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[22] That the primitive Roman tribes were in character substantially\r\nidentical with the primitive Greek phylae cannot be doubted. Apparently\r\nthe four Ionic phylae in Attica offered no resistance to dissolution at\r\nthe hands of Cleisthenes; cf. Hdt. v. 66; Arist. _Ath. Pol._ 21. (For\r\nthe best treatment of the Greek phylae, see Szanto, E., _Ausgewählte\r\nAbhandlungen_, 216-88, who maintains that the institution was\r\nartificial.) In like manner the three Roman tribes disappeared, leaving\r\nbut scant traces; p. 7.\r\n\r\n[23] Mantua, till late an Etruscan city, had three tribes; Serv. _in\r\nAen._ x. 202. In this connection it is significant that Volnius, an\r\nEtruscan poet, declared the primitive tribal names to be Etruscan;\r\nVarro, _L. L._ v. 55. The information suggests the possibility that some\r\nEtruscan cities had these same tribes; cf. Fest. 285. 25; _CIL._ ix.\r\n4204 (locality unknown). In fact these names can be ultimately traced\r\nto Etruscan gentilicia; Schulze, _Lat. Eigennam._ 218, 581. The triplet\r\nchampions of Alba point to a division of this community into three\r\ntribes; Niebuhr, _Röm. Gesch._ i. 386; Schwegler, _Röm. Gesch._ i. 502.\r\nThe story that T. Tatius was killed at Lavinium indicates the existence\r\nof a tomb of the hero in that place—a clear sign of a tribe of Tities\r\nthere; Livy i. 14. 2; Dion. Hal. ii. 52; cf. Varro, _L. L._ v. 152. A\r\ntrace of Ramnes is found at Ardea; Serv. _in Aen._ ix. 358. There were\r\nRamnennii in Ostia (_CIL._ xiv. 1542) and Ramnii in Capua; ibid. x. 3772;\r\nSchulze, _Lat. Eigennam._ 218. The existence of a tribe of Luceres in\r\nArdea is vouched for by Lucerus, its eponymous hero, king of that city;\r\nFest. ep. 119; Pais, _Storia di Roma_, I. i. 279. The word in various\r\nforms occurs in certain Etruscan towns; Schulze, ibid. 182. These facts\r\nmake it probable that some at least of the Latin as well as Etruscan\r\ncities had the same three tribes.\r\n\r\n[24] The Etruscans had twelve cities in each of their three districts;\r\nStrabo v. 4. 3; Livy v. 33. Each city had three consecrated gates and\r\nthree temples to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva; Serv. _in Aen._ i. 422. The\r\nUmbrians had three hundred cities in the Po valley, destroyed by the\r\nEtruscans; Pliny, _N. H._ iii. 14. 113. The Bruttians were organized in\r\na confederation of twelve cities; Livy xxv. 1. 2. The Iapygians were\r\ndivided into three branches (Polyb. iii. 88. 4), each of which comprised\r\ntwelve smaller groups; Bloch, _Orig. d. sén._ 9 f.; Holzapfel, in _Beitr.\r\nz. alt. Gesch._ i. 245 ff., 252 f. The tripartite division also existed\r\nin many pagi which continued to historical time; Kornemann, in _Klio_, v.\r\n83.\r\n\r\n[25] These facts are too well known to need illustration; cf. Nissen,\r\n_Templum_, 144; Bloch, _Orig. d. sén._ 1 ff.\r\n\r\n[26] Varro, _L. L._ v. 55. Tribus = tri-bu-s: bu- is related to φυ- “to\r\ngrow,” Skt. bhū-; tribus, corresponding to φυ-λή, would then signify\r\n“three-branch;” Corssen, _Ausspr._ i. 163; Pott, _Etym. Forsch._ i. 111,\r\n217; ii. 441; Vaniček, _Etym. Wörterb. d. lat. Spr._ 69; _Griech.-lat.\r\netym. Wörterb._ 636; Bloch, ibid. 9. Schlossman, in _Archiv f. lat.\r\nLexicog._ xiv (1905). 25-40, connecting tribus with tres, interprets it\r\nnot as a third but as an indefinite part, cf. entzweien with the meaning\r\nto divide in several parts. Schrader, _Reallex._ 801, is doubtful as to\r\nthe etymology; cf. Walde, _Lat. etym. Wörterb._ 636. The connection of\r\nthe word with tres is denied by Madvig, _Röm. Staat._ i. 96; Nissen,\r\n_Ital. Landesk._ ii. 8, n. 5. Christ, in _Sitzb. d. bayer. Akad._ 1906.\r\n204, prefers to connect it with Celt *trebo- (Old Irish treb), “house,”\r\nGoth. thaúrp, “village.” Oscan trebo- also means “house.”\r\n\r\n[27] The existence of four Ionic tribes in all Ionic cities cannot be\r\nmaintained; cf. Wilamowitz-Möllendorff, in _Sitzb. d. Berl. Akad._ 1906.\r\n71.\r\n\r\n[28] The tribus Sapinia was the territory of the Sapinian community (Livy\r\nxxxi. 2. 6; xxxiii. 37. 1), just as the trifu Tarinate was the territory\r\nof the community (tuta, tota, Osc. touto; _Tab. Bant._ 2) Tadinum; _Tab.\r\nIguv._ vi. b. 54; cf. iii. 24; Buck, _Grammar of Oscan and Umbrian_, 278\r\nf., 298; Bücheler, _Umbrica_, see index, s. Tref, Trefiper; Kornemann, in\r\n_Klio_, v. 87.\r\n\r\n[29] Christ, in _Sitzb. d. bayer. Akad._ 1906. 207.\r\n\r\n[30] Livy i. 55. 3 f.; _CIL._ ix. 1618, 5565; Nissen, _Ital. Landesk._\r\nii. 8 ff.; Kornemann, in _Klio_, v. 80.\r\n\r\n[31] Dion. Hal. iv. 15; Nissen, _Ital. Landesk._ ii. 9-15. Doubtless\r\noppidum applied primarily to the enclosing wall, thence to the space\r\nenclosed; Caes. _B. G._ v. 21; Varro, _L. L._ v. 153. From the beginning\r\nit must have been the chief or central settlement of the pagus, though\r\nthe organization was not urban but territorial-tribal; cf. Pöhlmann,\r\n_Anfänge Roms_, 40 ff.\r\n\r\n[32] Livy ix. 41. 6; x. 18. 8; _CIL._ i. 199; Isid. _Etym._ xv. 2. 11:\r\n“Vici et castella et pagi sunt quae nulla dignitate civitatis ornantur,\r\nsed vulgari hominum conventu incoluntur et propter parvitatem sui\r\nmaioribus civitatibus attribuuntur;” Fest. ep. 72; Nissen, ibid. 11.\r\n\r\n[33] Thus the three tribes of Cyrene were made up each of a nationality\r\nor group of nationalities (Hdt. iv. 161), and the ten tribes of Thurii\r\nwere named after the nationalities of which they were respectively\r\ncomposed; Diod. xii. 11. 3.\r\n\r\n[34] The Romans founded their colonies according to Etruscan rites,\r\nand they believed their city to have been established in the same way;\r\nVarro, _L. L._ v. 143; Cato, in Serv. _in Aen._ v. 755; Fest. 237.\r\n18; Kornemann, in _Klio_, v. 88. The word Roma is now declared to be\r\nEtruscan; Schultze, _Lat. Eigennam._ 579 ff.; Schmidt, Karl Fr. W., in\r\n_Berl. Philol. Woch._ 1906. 1656.\r\n\r\n[35] Richter, _Top. d. Stadt Rom_, 30 ff., still believes that the\r\nearliest settlement was on the Palatine. His view is controverted by\r\nDegering, H., in _Berl. Philol. Woch._ xxiii (1903). 1645 f., who prefers\r\nthe Quirinal; cf. also Carter, J. B., in _Am. Journ. of Archaeol._ xii\r\n(1908). 172-83.\r\n\r\n[36] Cf. Richter, ibid. 38; Meyer, E., in _Hermes_, xxx. 13.\r\n\r\n[37] Cf. Nissen, _Ital. Landesk._ ii. 504.\r\n\r\n[38] Cf. Varro, _L. L._ v. 55; Verrius Flaccus, in Gell. xviii. 7. 5. The\r\nidea of Isidorus, _Etym._ ix. 6. 7, is of course absurd.\r\n\r\n[39] This subject will be considered in connection with the Servian\r\ntribes; p. 48 f.\r\n\r\n[40] Dion. Hal. iv. 14. 2.\r\n\r\n[41] P. 74.\r\n\r\n[42] Like the Attic phylobasileis they continued through historical time\r\nto perform sacerdotal functions; Dion. Hal. ii. 64. 3; _Fast. Praen. Mar.\r\n19_, in _CIL._ i². p. 234: “(Sali) faciunt in comitio saltu (adstantibus\r\npo)ntificibus et trib. celer;” Holzapfel, in _Beitr. z. alt. Gesch._ i.\r\n242.\r\n\r\n[43] Verg. _Aen._ v. 553 ff.; Serv. _in Aen._ v. 560; Holzapfel, ibid.\r\n243.\r\n\r\n[44] P. 2, n. 6.\r\n\r\n[45] Fest. 285. 25; cf. Serv. _in Aen._ x. 202.\r\n\r\n[46] There were curiae in Lanuvium, an old Latin town; _CIL._ xiv. 2120.\r\nJuno Curis, Cur(r)itis, Quiritis, goddess of the curiae, was worshipped\r\nin Tibur (Serv. _in Aen._ i. 17), and in Falerii (Tertul. _Apol._ 24;\r\n_CIL._ xi. 3100, 3125, 3126; cf. Holzapfel, _Beitr. z. alt. Gesch._\r\ni. 247; Roscher, _Lex. d. griech. u. röm. Myth._ II. i. 596 f.). A\r\nconnection between Cūris and cūria is not clear; Deecke, _Falisker_, 86.\r\n\r\n[47] Aristotle, _Politics_, 1329, b 8, considers Italus, king of the\r\nOenotrians, to have been author of the mess-associations (συσσίτια),\r\nadding that the institution was derived from the country of the Opici and\r\nthe Chaonians. With the Opici he includes Latins as well as Ausonians;\r\nDion. Hal. i. 72. 3. On the relation of these peoples to one another,\r\nsee especially Pais, _Anc. Italy_, ch. i. Greek writers identify the\r\ncuria with the phratry (Dion. Hal. ii. 7. 3 f.; Dio Cass. Frag. 4.\r\n8), the ἑταιρεία, and the syssition (Dion. Hal. ii. 23. 3; Dio Cass.\r\nibid.). Although the institutions designated by these four names show\r\nconsiderable variety of form and function, they are similar in general\r\ncharacter and may have a common origin; Meyer, _Gesch. d. Alt._ ii. 514.\r\n\r\nThe myth which names the curiae after the Sabine women suggests that some\r\nof the curial names, and perhaps the curiae themselves, might be found\r\namong the Sabines. On Rapta and Titia however see p. 11, n. 7.\r\n\r\n[48] Dion. Hal. ii. 7. 2; Dio Cass. Frag. 5. 8; Plut. _Rom._ 20; Fest.\r\n174. 8; ep. 49; (Aurel. Vict.) _Vir. Ill._ ii. 12; Serv. _in Aen._ viii.\r\n638; Pomponius, in _Dig._ i. 2. 2. 2.\r\n\r\nSoltau, _Altröm. Volksversamml._ 47 f., entertains the peculiar idea that\r\nthe curiae, invented to counteract the independent tendencies of the\r\ntribes, were not divisions of the tribes, the members of each curia being\r\ndrawn from all three tribes. His view is contradicted by the sources and\r\nhe admits that he cannot prove it.\r\n\r\nSt. Augustine, _Enarr. in Psalm._ 121. 7 (iv. 2. 1624 ed. Migne),\r\nand still later Paulus, the epitomator of Festus, 54, suppose that\r\nthere were thirty-five curiae. Notwithstanding Hoffmann, _Patr. u.\r\npleb. Cur._ 44 ff., the opinion of these late writers doubtless arose\r\nfrom an identification of the curiae with the tribes; cf. Kübler, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1818.\r\n\r\n[49] P. 11 f.\r\n\r\n[50] The word is derived from *co-viria, “a dwelling together,” “an\r\nassembly,” by Pott, _Etym. Forsch._ ii. 373 f. (cf. Vaniček, _Etym.\r\nWörterb. d. lat. Spr._ 160; Walde, _Lat. etym. Wörterb._ 161), who is\r\nfollowed by Schwegler, _Röm. Gesch._ i. 496, n. 8, 610, n. 4; Herzog,\r\n_Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 96. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 5, 90 and notes,\r\ngives the word the meaning “an association of citizens,” deriving it\r\nfrom quiris (cf. _Abriss_, 11), which he connects with κῦρος, κῦριος, as\r\ndid Lange in 1853 (_Kleine Schriften_, i. 147). Afterward—_Röm. Alt._ i.\r\n(1876) 91—Lange expressed some doubt as to this connection. But the fact\r\nthat curia applies to the house not only of the curiales, but also of the\r\nsenate and of the Salii, as well as to various other buildings, seems\r\nto indicate that the meaning “house” is primary for the Latin language\r\nif not ultimately original. Corssen, who accepts this meaning, derives\r\ncu- from sku-, “to cover,” “to protect” (_Ausspr._ i. 353 f.; Vaniček,\r\n_Griech.-lat. etym. Wörterb._ 1116), cf. Old High Germ. hū-t, hū-s,\r\nEng. “house.” Although Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 90, n. 2, protests\r\nagainst this explanation, it is accepted by Meyer, _Gesch. d. Alt._ ii.\r\n511, Soltau, _Altröm. Volksversamml._ 52, and others. Far less probable\r\nis a connection with cura, curare, assumed by most ancient writers; cf.\r\nVarro, _L. L._ v. 155; vi. 46; _Vit. pop. rom._ in Non. Marc. 57; Fest.\r\nep. 49; Pomponius, in _Dig._ i. 2. 2. 2; Dio Cass. Frag. 5. 8; Isid.\r\n_Etym._ xv. 2. 28. These sources have misled Genz, _Patr. Rom_, 32, into\r\nfruitless speculation on the functions of the curia.\r\n\r\n[51] Tac. _Ann._ xii. 24.\r\n\r\n[52] Fest. 174. 6; Jordan, _Top. d.

The statement of Festus, 154. 26, that there were but fifteen\r\nflamines must be modified. But there may have been fewer than thirty\r\ncurial flamines; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 390. Of the two curial\r\nofficials mentioned by Dionysius, ii. 21. 2, therefore, one was the curio\r\nand the other a lictor (Mommsen, ibid. 309, n. 5; Genz, _Patr. Rom._, 47)\r\nor a flamen (Holzapfel, in _Beitr. z. alt. Gesch._ i. 242).\r\n\r\n[61] Cf. Wissowa, _Rel. u. Kult. d. Röm._ 338, n. 3, 413, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[62] Livy iii. 7. 7; xxvii. 8. 1; Fest. ep. 126. This official was\r\nprobably instituted after the curiones had become mere priests; Genz,\r\nibid. 48.\r\n\r\n[63] P. 157. The comitium was a place of assembly adjoining the Forum.\r\n\r\n[64] II. 7. 2 f.; 23. 3.\r\n\r\n[65] Soltau, _Altröm. Volksversamml._ 52, 65, following J. J. Müller, in\r\n_Philol._ xxxiv (1874), 96-136, refuses to credit a military character\r\nto the curiae because it is mentioned by no other writer and because we\r\ncan find no trace of it in historical time. His reasoning is not cogent.\r\nThe curia may have lost its earlier military function, as did the phratry\r\n(_Il._ ii. 362 f.).\r\n\r\n[66] That the antiquarians had some evidence as to the military character\r\nof the curiae is suggested by Fest. ep. 54: “Centuriata comitia item\r\ncuriata dicebantur, quia populus Romanus per cetenas turmas divisus erat.”\r\n\r\n[67] _Il._ ii. 362 f.\r\n\r\n[68] Tac. _Germ._ 7. 3.\r\n\r\n[69] Schrader, _Reallex._ 349 f.\r\n\r\n[70] All adult male citizens had a right to attend this assembly, all\r\nwho were physically qualified and of military age were liable to service\r\nwhen called to it; but probably on no occasion were those present in the\r\nassembly identical with the military levy of the year; cf. p. 203.\r\n\r\n[71] P. 7.\r\n\r\n[72] II. 7. 4. The curiales must have been neighbors in order to use a\r\ncommon drying oven; n. 8 below.\r\n\r\n[73] Fest. 174. 12. The first is evidently named after the Forum, the\r\nsecond after the Velia; cf. Plut. _Rom._ 20, who states that many were\r\nnamed after places. Of the other five Velitia (Fest. ibid.), Titia (ibid.\r\nep. 366), Faucia (Livy ix. 38. 15), and Acculeia (Varro, _L. L._ vi. 23)\r\nhave gentile endings. We should not imagine these four to be named after\r\ngentes, which were of later origin; Botsford, in _Pol. Sci. Quart._ xxi.\r\n(1907). 685 ff. It would be safer to assume that they, like gentilicia,\r\nare derived from the names of persons real or imaginary. Rapta (Fest.\r\n174. 12) and Titia possibly suggested to the ancients the derivation of\r\nthe curial names from those of the captive Sabine women; cf. p. 8, n. 6.\r\n\r\n[74] Dion. Hal. iv. 12. 2. This statement is confirmed by the nature of\r\nthe Fornacalia, the chief festival of the curiae; it was celebrated in\r\nconnection with the drying of the far in ovens; Pliny _N. H._ xviii. 2.\r\n8; Fest. ep. 83, 93. Evidently the members of a curia were those who had\r\na common drying oven; Wissowa, _Rel. u. Kult. d. Röm._ 142.\r\n\r\n[75] Διῄρηνται δὲ καὶ εἰς δεκάδας αἰ φράτραι, πρὸς αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἡγεμὼν\r\nἐκὰστην ἐκόσμει δεκάδα, δεκουρίων κατὰ τὴν ἐπιχώριον, γλῶτταν\r\nπροσαγομευόμενος.\r\n\r\n[76] Polyb. vi. 25. 1; cf. 20. 9.\r\n\r\n[77] _L. L._ v. 91.\r\n\r\n[78] There is no need of assuming, with Bloch, _Origines du sénat\r\nRomain_, 102-5, that the decuriae mentioned by Dionysius are “purely\r\nimaginary.”\r\n\r\n[79] _Röm. Gesch._ i. 334 f.; Eng. 163; cf. also Schwegler, _Röm. Gesch._\r\ni. 612 f. The antiquated view is still held by Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._\r\ni. 96, and by Lécrivain, in Daremberg et Saglio, _Dict._ ii. 1504. Though\r\nIhne, _History of Rome_, i. 113, n. 3, believes that the curiae were\r\ncomposed of gentes, he is doubtful as to the number.\r\n\r\n[80] “Cum ex generibus hominum suffragium feratur, curiata comitia esse;\r\ncum ex censu et aetate, centuriata; cum ex regionibus et locis, tributa.”\r\n\r\n[81] Mommsen, too, supposes that genera here means gentes but is used so\r\nas to include also the plebeian stirpes; nevertheless he knows that the\r\nvoting in the curiate assembly was by heads rather than by gentes; _Röm.\r\nStaatsr._ iii. 9, n. 2; 90, n. 5.\r\n\r\n[82] Livy i. 43. 10: “Viritim suffragium ... omnibus datum est” (i.e. in\r\nthe curiate assembly). This statement of the lack of relation between the\r\ngens and the curia is repeated from _Pol. Sci. Quart._ xxi. 511 f.\r\n\r\n[83] It is in the main a reproduction of my article on the subject in\r\n_Pol. Sci. Quart._ xxi (1906). 498-526.\r\n\r\n[84] P. 25 ff.\r\n\r\n[85] _Rep._ ii. 8. 14; 12. 23: “Senatus, qui constabat ex optimatibus,\r\nquibus ipse rex tantum tribuisset, ut eos patres vellet nominari\r\npatriciosque eorum liberos.”\r\n\r\n[86] In the expression “omnibus patriciis, omnibus antiquissimis\r\ncivibus,” Cicero (_Caec._ 35. 101) intends no more than to include the\r\npatricians among the oldest citizens, whom he is contrasting with the\r\nnewly-admitted municipes. Only the most superficial examination of the\r\npassage (cf. Willems, _Sén. Rom._ i. 7) could make “omnibus patriciis”\r\nequivalent to “omnibus antiquissimis civibus.”\r\n\r\n[87] I. 8. 7.\r\n\r\n[88] Ibid.: “Consilium deinde viribus parat: centum creat senatores.”\r\n\r\n[89] Livy iv. 4. 7: “Nobilitatem istam vestram quam plerique oriundi ex\r\nAlbanis et Sabinis non genere nec sanguine sed per coöptationem in patres\r\nhabetis, aut ab regibus lecti aut post reges exactos iussu populi.”\r\n\r\n[90] Livy i. 34. 6: “In novo populo, ubi omnis repentina atque ex virtute\r\nnobilitas sit.”\r\n\r\n[91] II. 8. 1-3. In 12. 1, he shifts his point of view: Romulus chose the\r\nhundred original senators from the patricians.\r\n\r\n[92] _Rom._ 13; cf. _Q. R._ 58.\r\n\r\n[93] Cf. further Ovid, _Fast._ iii. 127; Vell. i. 8. 6; Fest. 246. 23;\r\n339. 11.\r\n\r\n[94] There is no inconsistency, however, in the fact that some noble\r\ngentes claimed descent from Aeneas or from deities (cf. Seeley, _Livy_,\r\n57) or from Alban or Sabine ancestors (cf. Livy i. 30. 2; iv. 4. 7; Dion.\r\nHal. ii. 46. 3; iii. 29. 7); they were nobles in their original homes\r\nbefore the founding of Rome, but became patricians by an act only of the\r\nRoman government.\r\n\r\nAlthough after the creation of the first hundred patres, the ancients\r\ndo not distinctly state that each newly-made senator was the founder of\r\na new patrician family, they do represent the enlargement of the senate\r\nand of the patriciate as going hand in hand; in this way they continue to\r\nmake the patriciate depend upon membership in the senate; cf. Livy i. 30.\r\n2; 35. 6; Dion. Hal. ii. 47. 1; iii. 67. 1; Madvig, _Röm. Staat._ i. 75.\r\n\r\n[95] _Rep._, ii. 8. 14; cf. (Aurel. Vict.) _Vir. Ill._ ii. 11.\r\n\r\n[96] _Cat._ 6. 6; cf.

For other illustrations of the same principle, see\r\nRubino, ibid. 188, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[108] The Twelve Tables seem to apply it to all patricians, not to\r\nsenators alone: Cicero, _Rep._ ii. 37. 63: “Conubia ... ut ne plebei cum\r\npatribus essent;” Livy iv. 4. 5: “Ne conubium patribus cum plebe esset.”\r\nThese passages, however, do not afford absolute proof; for Gaius, bk. vi\r\n_ad legem Duodecim Tabularum_ (_Dig._ 1. 16. 238: “Plebs est ceteri cives\r\nsine senatoribus”), probably commenting on the very law quoted by Cicero\r\nand Livy, seems to understand patres as senators; cf. the prohibition\r\nof intermarriage between senators and their agnatic descendants on the\r\none hand and freed persons on the other; _Dig._ xxii. 2. 44; Roby, _Rom.\r\nPriv. Law_, i. 130; Vassis, in _Athena_, xii. 57 f. In some instances,\r\nhowever, as in the expression “a patribus transire ad plebem” (Vell. ii.\r\n45. 1) patres is certainly equivalent to patricii.\r\n\r\n[109] Cf. gentilicius from gentilis; tribunicius from tribunus, Pott,\r\nibid. 227. Patricius is an adjective signifying paternal, ancestral,\r\nbelonging to parents or progenitors; Corssen, ibid. i. 53.\r\n\r\n[110] In his work on the Comitia, quoted by Fest. 241. 21: “Patricios eos\r\nappellari solitos qui nunc ingenui vocentur.”\r\n\r\n[111] X. 8. 10: “En umquam fando audistis patricios primo esse factos non\r\nde caelo demissos, sed qui patrem ciere possent, id est nihil ultra quam\r\ningenuos...?”\r\n\r\n[112] VI. 40. 6. The speaker contrasts ingenui with patricii.\r\n\r\n[113] Plut. _Q. R._ 58: Those who were first constituted senators by\r\nRomulus were called patres and patricii as being men of good birth, who\r\ncould show their pedigree. In its adjectival and adverbial uses ingenuus\r\nconnotes not the quality of free birth, but respectability, nobility.\r\nThe original meaning is “born within,” hence indigenous, native; cf.\r\nForcellini, _Totius Latinitatis Lexicon_, s. v. In this sense it could\r\nnot apply to the patricians, who generally claimed a foreign origin.\r\nBut native is superior to alien; doubtless in this secondary meaning of\r\nexcellence it attached to the nobility, the close relation of the word to\r\ngens (family, lineage) attracting it in that direction. Afterward it was\r\nso democratized as to include all the freeborn. With this meaning we find\r\nit as early as Plautus, _Mil._ 784, 961. According to Dionysius, ii. 8.\r\n3, the identification of patricii with ingenui in its sense of freeborn\r\nwas accepted not by the most trustworthy historians, but by certain\r\nmalicious slanderers: “Some say they were called patricians because they\r\nalone could cite their fathers, the rest being fugitives and unable to\r\ncite free fathers.”\r\n\r\n[114] P. 30.\r\n\r\n[115] The word is probably derived from the same root as populus;\r\nCorssen, _Ausspr._ i. 368; cf. p. 1, n. 3 above.\r\n\r\n[116] _Rep._ ii. 9. 16.\r\n\r\n[117] ii. 9. 2.\r\n\r\n[118] Notably among the Sabines, Livy ii. 16. 4; Dion.

Staatsr._ iii. 71, n. 1.\r\nDionysius, ii. 63. 3, distinguished the two classes as early as the\r\ninterregnum which followed Romulus.\r\n\r\n[121] Dion. Hal. v. 40. 3; vi. 47. 1; vii. 19. 2; x. 43. As late as 134\r\nScipio called his clients to follow him to the Numantine war; Appian,\r\n_Iber._ 84.\r\n\r\n[122] Livy iii. 58. 1.\r\n\r\n[123] Dion. Hal. ii. 10. 3.\r\n\r\n[124] Livy ii. 56. 3; 64. 2; Dion. Hal. ii. 10. 3; iv. 23. 6; ix. 41. 5.\r\n\r\n[125] Dion. Hal. ii. 10. 3 (it was not lawful for either patron or client\r\nto vote against the other). Marius, a client of Herennius, was elected to\r\nthe praetorship; Plut. _Mar._ 5. A law declared that election to a curule\r\noffice (according to Plutarch, or as Marius asserted to any office) freed\r\na man and his family from clientage. Evidently this law was passed in\r\nor after 367 B.C. Mucius, a client of Ti. Gracchus, was elected to the\r\nplebeian tribunate; Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 13. Cn. Flavius, who was the son\r\nof a freedman and probably therefore a client, was elected curule aedile\r\nfor 304; Livy ix. 46. 1; Val. Max. ii. 5. 2.\r\n\r\n[126] Gaius 1. 3: “Plebs autem a populo eo distat, quod populi\r\nappellatione universi cives significantur connumeratis etiam patriciis;\r\nplebis autem appellatione sine patriciis ceteri cives significantur.”\r\nEvidently Pomponius held the same view; _Dig._ i. 2. 2. 1-6; cf. Capito,\r\nin Gell. x. 20. 5; Fest. 233. 29; 330. 19; Isid. _Etym._ ix. 6. 5 f.;\r\nMommsen, _Röm.

The Greeks always regard\r\npopulus as the equivalent of δῆμος; cf. Plut. _Rom._ 13. Not only does\r\nthe tribune in addressing the plebs call them populus Romanus (Sall.\r\n_Iug._ 31), but the consuls also apply the term to the same class (Livy\r\nxxv. 4. 4); and a statement of Cicero (_Leg. Agr._ ii. 7. 17), which has\r\nthe appearance of a legal definition, makes the people of the thirty-five\r\ntribes under a tribune the universus populus Romanus.\r\n\r\n[129] _Röm.

Staatsr._ iii. 69, grants to the ancients far more\r\nknowledge of their own history, but claims a “wider horizon.”\r\n\r\n[141] Niebuhr treats Dionysius with great respect; cf. _Lectures_, i.\r\nliv: “The longer and more carefully the work is examined, the more must\r\ntrue criticism acknowledge that it is deserving of all respect, and the\r\nmore it will be found a storehouse of most solid information.” Schwegler,\r\n_Röm. Gesch._ i. 621 f., and 626 f., assumes that Dionysius is alone\r\nresponsible for the view that the plebeians were in the primitive tribes\r\nand the curiae. A glance at the citations given above, p. 24 f., will\r\nshow, however, that Cicero and Livy shared this view.\r\n\r\n[142] Cf. Pais, _Storia di Roma_, I. 1. 82. The usual opinion (cf.\r\nBernhöft, _Röm. Königsz._ 8 f.) is that the sources of Dionysius are\r\nlater and less trustworthy than those of Livy, but Pais asserts that on\r\nthe whole the two authors drew from the same sources.\r\n\r\n[143] _Röm.

Dem. xliii. 57.\r\n\r\n[151] This is illustrated, for instance, by a law quoted by Philochorus,\r\nin Müller, _Frag. Hist. Graec._ i. 399. 94: Τοὺς δὲ φράτορας ἐπάναγκες\r\nδέχεσθαι καὶ τοὺς ὀργεῶνας καὶ τοὺς ὁμογάλακτας, οὺς γεννῆτας καλοῦμεν\r\n(“The members of the phratry must receive the orgeones as well as the\r\nhomogalaktes, whom we call gennetae”). This fact is now too well known to\r\nneed further proof; cf. Gilbert, _Constitutional Antiquities of Sparta\r\nand Athens_, 148 f.; Thumser, _Griechische Staatsaltertümer_, 324 f.\r\n\r\n[152] P. 11.\r\n\r\n[153] _Top._ 6. 29: “Gentiles sunt inter se, qui eodem nomine sunt. Non\r\nest satis. Qui ab ingenuis oriundi sunt. Ne id quidem satis est. Quorum\r\nmaiorum nemo servitutem servivit. Abest etiam nunc. Qui capite non sunt\r\ndeminuti. Hoc fortasse satis est. Nihil enim video Scaevolam pontificem\r\nad hanc definitionem addidisse;” cf. Cincius, in Fest. ep. 94.\r\n\r\nAs the word itself indicates, gentiles are members of a gens, and no\r\nother members are known to the sources. If it were true, as Mommsen,\r\n_Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 66, supposes, that there were dependent members not\r\ntermed gentiles, a name would have been given this dependent relation, or\r\nthe jurists would have defined it, or some ancient writer would at least\r\nhave mentioned it. The attempt of Kübler, _Wochenschr. f. kl. Philol._\r\nxxv (1908). 541 f., to prove, on the authority of Cicero, _Tim._ 11. 41,\r\nthat clients were termed quasi gentiles is simply absurd. The passage\r\ndoes not even hint at clientage; and the quasi gentiles of the immortal\r\ngods, according to this passage, were related to the gods by birth, as\r\nthe word gignatis proves. From this point of view men might be called the\r\nchildren of the gods; but because the divine element in both men and gods\r\ncomes alike from the Creator, it is possible to place them more nearly on\r\na level with one another—in a relation like that of gentiles. Kübler’s\r\nother remarks on the gens, 539-43, are equally unconvincing.\r\n\r\n[154] Cic. _Brut._ 16. 32; Livy iv. 16. 3; Suet. _Aug._ 2.

Staatsverf._\r\ni. 98 f., 108, 1014, n. 2, imagines that from the beginning the clients\r\nbelonged to the curia in its administrative capacity, shared in its\r\nsacra, attended its meetings, but did not vote. The plebs, however, were\r\nnot even passive members. His reasons do not deserve mention. Vassis,\r\nῬωμαών Πολιτεία ἡ βασιλευομένη κα ἡ ἐλευθέρα (Athens, 1903), also\r\nexcludes the commons from the curiate assembly throughout its history.\r\nThe fancies of Hoffmann, _Patr. und pleb.

It is a significant fact, however, that no patrician\r\nfamily is known to have derived its origin from this earliest colony.\r\nThose who claimed Alban and Trojan descent preferred to connect their\r\nadmission to citizenship with the Roman annexation of Alba Longa, e.g.\r\nthe Tullii, Servilii, Quinctii, Geganii, Curiatii, and Cloelii; Livy i.\r\n30. 2. On the Alban and Sabine origin of most of the nobility, Livy iv.\r\n4. 7. In so far as the local cognomina are indicative of origin (cf.\r\nWillems, _Sén. Rom._ i. 11 ff.), they point to a diversity of foreign\r\nconnections. The Tarquinian gens, which in later time was thought of as\r\npatrician, came from Etruria, ultimately from Greece. The Aemilii were\r\nGreek (Plut. _Aem._ 1; Fest. ep. 23) or Sabine (Plut. _Num._ 8) or Oscan\r\n(Fest. 130. 1).\r\n\r\n[225] Cf. p. 31 above. For details, see _Pol. Sci. Quart._ xxii. 679 ff.\r\n\r\n[226] That Caere was the first community to receive the civitas sine\r\nsuffragio may justly be inferred from the expression “Caerite franchise,”\r\nwhich designates this kind of limited citizenship (cf. p. 62). The\r\ngeneral fact stated in (6) is further confirmed by the law which granted\r\nthe right of extending the pomerium to those magistrates only who had\r\nacquired new territory for Rome; Gell. xiii. 14. 3; Tacitus, _Ann._ xii.\r\n23.\r\n\r\n[227] Since the publication of the _Staatsrecht_, writers have made\r\nslight modifications or extensions of the conventional theory. Greenidge,\r\nin Poste, _Gaii Institutiones_, xix, suggests that the dual forms in\r\nRoman law may have as their basis a racial distinction between the\r\npatricians and the plebeians. A serious objection to this kind of\r\nreasoning is that if we are on the lookout for dualities, trinities,\r\nand the like, we shall find them in abundance everywhere. All sorts of\r\ntheories as to the racial connections of the two social classes have been\r\nproposed. Zöller, _Latium und Rom_, 23 ff., supposes that the patricians\r\nwere Sabine and the plebeians Latin. Ridgeway, _Early Age of Greece_, i.\r\n257, holds that the plebeians were Ligurians, whereas Conway, in _Riv. di\r\nStor. ant._ vii (1903). 422-4, prefers to consider them Volscians. These\r\nnotions are equally worthless. Undoubtedly race is a potent factor in\r\nhistory; but Gumplowicz, _Rassenkampf_ (1883), has killed the theory by\r\noverwork.\r\n\r\nAmong the writers who have rejected the conventional view are Soltau,\r\n_Altröm.

For the mingling of conquerors and\r\nconquered, see p. 42 f. and notes. On the ethnic heterogeneity of states\r\nin general, see Gumplowicz, _Rassenkampf_, 181. The laws of Solon granted\r\ncitizenship to alien residents who were in perpetual exile from their own\r\ncountry, or who had settled with their families in Attica with a view\r\nto plying their trade; Plut. _Sol._ 24. Under his laws, too, a valid\r\nmarriage could be contracted between an Athenian and an alien; Hdt. vi.\r\n130. The Athenians, like the Romans, believed that many of their noble\r\nfamilies were of foreign origin. In Ireland “strangers settling in the\r\ndistrict, conducting themselves well, and intermarrying with the clan,\r\nwere after a few generations indistinguishable from it;” Ginnell, _Brehon\r\nLaws_, 103. Nearly the same rule holds for South Wales; Seebohm, _Tribal\r\nSystem in Wales_, 131. To the Germans before their settlement within the\r\nempire the idea of an exclusive community must have been foreign; for\r\nas yet the individual was but loosely attached to his tribe. Persons of\r\nmany tribes were united in the comitatus of a chief; the two halves of\r\na tribe often fought on opposite sides in war; a tribe often chose its\r\nchief from another tribe. Intermarriage among the tribes was common, even\r\nbetween Germans and Sarmatians. A single tribe often split into several\r\nindependent tribes, and conversely new tribes were formed of the most\r\ndiverse elements; Seeck, _Geschichte des Untergangs der antiken Welt_,\r\ni. 209 with notes; Kaufmann, _Die Germanen der Urzeit_, 136 f. Under\r\nthese circumstances the primitive German community cannot be described\r\nas exclusive. In like manner our sources unanimously testify to the\r\nliberality of early Rome in granting the citizenship to strangers. It is\r\nno longer possible to oppose to this authority the objection that such\r\ngenerosity does not accord with primitive conditions.\r\n\r\n[262] Gaius i. 120 f.\r\n\r\n[263] Mommsen’s theory of gentile ownership, adopted by Kubitschek, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ i. 790, depends upon his view that the gens\r\nwas as old as the state; in his opinion it was originally stronger but\r\ngradually weakened, whereas the state went through the opposite process;\r\n_Röm Staatsr._ iii. 25. But if, as I have elsewhere pointed out (_Pol.\r\nSci. Quart._ xxii. 685 ff.), the gens developed from the family during\r\nthe decline of the kingship and the rise of aristocracy, the theory of a\r\nprimitive gentile ownership falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n[264] We are not to think of the state as granting a certain district\r\nto the tribe, which then parcelled it among the component curiae, etc.,\r\nfor this reason that the tribes and the curiae did not themselves\r\npossess common lands. Rather the state divided a given district among\r\nthe families which were already included, or which it wished to include,\r\nin a given curia or tribe. In this way the later tribes were formed\r\nin historical time, and in this way the Claudian tribe was originally\r\nconstituted; Livy ii. 16. 4 f.; cf. Plut. _Popl._ 21. When therefore\r\nDionysius, ii. 7. 4, states that Romulus divided the land into thirty\r\nlots and assigned a lot to each of the thirty curiae, he means, if he\r\ncorrectly understands the matter, that land was assigned not to the curia\r\nas a whole but to the families which composed the curia, unless indeed\r\nthe curiae once had a right of landholding not possessed in historical\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[265] Christ, W., in _Sitzb. d. Berl. Akad. d. Wiss._ 1906. 207.\r\n\r\n[266] In the Twelve Tables heredium has the meaning of hortus, “garden;”\r\nPliny, _N. H._ xix. 4. 50. It was a praedium parvulum consisting of two\r\niugera; Fest. ep. 99.\r\n\r\n[267] In the earliest colonies this was the amount assigned to each\r\nman; cf.

The reading represented\r\nby Jordan, _Cato_, p. 8, is not satisfactory. We have no ground for\r\nimpugning the statement of Dionysius that Fabius actually called the\r\ncountry districts phylae, tribes. He may have termed them at once μοῖραι,\r\n“regions,” and phylae with perfect consistency; cf. Kubitschek, _Rom.\r\ntrib. or._ 7, n. 34.\r\n\r\n[275] _Röm.

Ill._ 7. 7; the\r\ndiscussion of the four city tribes as though they were the only Servian\r\ntribes by Dionysius (iv. 14. 1), whereas in the next chapter he describes\r\nthose also of the country; and the designation of the rural districts\r\nas regiones rather than tribes by Varro, _De vit. pop. rom._ i, in\r\nNon.

The error of including Alba and Ostia in the\r\nPalatina is due to neglect of the fact that men excluded from the country\r\ntribes were assigned to those of the city irrespective of domicile; cf.\r\n_Röm.

Altogether unnecessary therefore\r\nis Soltau’s supposition (_Altröm. Volksversamml._ 458, n. 2), in itself\r\nimprobable, that Fabius, who wrote his annals in Greek, applied the word\r\nφυλαί incorrectly to the rural districts. However that may be, Cato, as\r\ngood an authority, spoke of these same districts as tribes. If the number\r\nthirty was suggested to Fabius by the curiate organization (cf. Ullrich,\r\n_Centuriatcomitien_, 9), this circumstance would be no argument against\r\nthe existence of country tribes.

His idea of a census of the country people\r\nhe derived from Lucius Piso (§ 5 f.) and from the censors’ office through\r\nFabius (22. 2)—a fact which militates against Mommsen’s theory that under\r\nServius the country was not yet ager privatus.\r\n\r\n[296] Livy vi. 5. 8.\r\n\r\n[297] P. 56.\r\n\r\n[298] _Röm.

Meyer’s view (_Gesch. d. Alt._ v.\r\n135, 142) that the sixteen earliest country tribes were not formed till\r\nafter the institution of the plebeian tribunate depends partly on his\r\nnotion that the tribunes were originally the heads of the four urban\r\ntribes and partly on the difference in the naming, the city tribes being\r\nnamed after localities and the country tribes after gentes; cf. _Hermes_,\r\nxxx. 11. The latter circumstance, he asserts, establishes a later\r\norigin for the rural tribes. This argument is by no means convincing;\r\nthe difference may have arisen from different conditions in country and\r\ncity; probably no urban ward had one patrician gens so predominant as to\r\ngive its name. If one kind of name is earlier than another, we should\r\nnaturally suppose the gentile name to be the earlier, and in that case we\r\nshould prefer the view of Pais, _Stor. di Rom._ I. i. 320, n. 1; _Leg. of\r\nRom. Hist._ 140; cf. above, p. 52, n. 2.\r\n\r\nThe patrician gentile name does not imply patrician domination any more\r\nthan the eupatrid name of an Attic deme implies eupatrid domination of\r\nthat deme.\r\n\r\n[305] _Hermes_, xxx. 12; followed by Neumann, _Grundherrsch. d. röm.\r\nRep._ 13 f.; Kornemann, in _Klio_, v. 90 f.\r\n\r\n[306] P. 6.\r\n\r\n[307] Among the scholars who insist that originally country as well\r\nas city was divided into tribes are Müller, J. J., in _Philol._ xxxiv\r\n(1876). 112 ff., and more recently Kubitschek, _De trib. or._ (1882);\r\n_Imp. rom. trib. discr._ (1889), 2. Beloch, _Ital. Bund_ (1880), 28,\r\nbegins with twenty-one tribes in 495, considering it impossible to\r\npenetrate earlier conditions. Niese, _Röm. Gesch._ (1906). 38 and n. 3,\r\nmore positively assigns the creation of twenty-one tribes to that date.\r\n\r\n[308] Livy ii. 16. 5; cf. Dion. Hal. v. 40. 5.\r\n\r\n[309] In Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iii. 2650.\r\n\r\n[310] Some place the immigration in the time of Titus Tatius; Verg.\r\n_Aen._ vii. 706 ff.; Suet. _Tib._ 1; Appian, _Reg._ 12; Mommsen, _Röm.\r\nForsch._ i. 293; _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 26, n. 1. That the earlier\r\ntradition assigned the event to the date mentioned in the text is\r\nasserted by Münzer, in Pauly-Wissowa, ibid. iii. 2663.\r\n\r\n[311] Livy ii. 21. 7 (495): “Romae tribus una et xxx factae.” This\r\nstatement is not that thirty-one tribes were instituted in that year,\r\nbut that the number thirty-one was reached, “factae” being copulative.\r\nIf “una et xxx” is not a copyist’s error, it probably depends on the\r\nFabian view that there were originally thirty tribes. At all events it\r\nis inconsistent with the later statement (vi. 5. 8) that the number\r\ntwenty-five was not reached till 387. The epitomator of Livy accordingly\r\ncorrected the number to twenty-one, which most editors now write in the\r\ntext itself. That there were twenty-one tribes in 491, when Coriolanus\r\nwas tried, is assumed too by Dion. Hal. vii. 64. 6: Μιᾶς γὰρ καὶ εἴκοσι\r\nτότε φυλῶν οὐσῶν, οἶς ἡ ψῆφος ἀνεδόθη, τὰς ἀπολυούσας φυλὰς ἔσχεν ὁ\r\nΜάρκιος ἐννέα· ὤστ’ εἰ δύο προσῆλθον αὐτῷ φυλαί, διὰ τὴν ἰσοψηφίαν\r\nἀπελέλυτ’ ἄν, ὥσπερ ὁ νόμος ἠξίου (“There being at the time twenty-one\r\ntribes, to whom the vote was given, Marcius received the votes of nine\r\ntribes for acquittal; so that, had two more tribes been favorable, he\r\nwould have been acquitted by an equality of votes, as the law required”).\r\nThis is not a mistake, as many assume, but an understatement; cf. Müller,\r\nJ. J., in _Philol._ xxxiv (1876). 110 f. Meyer’s explanation (_Hermes_,\r\nxxx. 10, n. 2), which makes διὰ τὴν ἰσοψηφλίαν signify “owing to the\r\nequal value of the votes,” is improbable and unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[312] For the form of the word, see Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 171;\r\nKubitschek, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 117.

Proof of the date is the fact that the ratings are in the\r\nsextantarian _as_, legally adopted in 269 or 268 (page 86). The _as_ of\r\nthis standard was valued at one tenth of a denarius, so that 1000 asses\r\n= 100 denarii = 1 mina; Dion.

In this volume the name will\r\nbe given to the king (or group of kings?) who instituted the so-called\r\nServian tribes and the military centuries and made a beginning of the\r\ncensus.\r\n\r\n[401] P. 201.\r\n\r\n[402] Helbig, _Sur les attributes des saliens_, in _Mémoires de l’acad.\r\nd. inscr. et belles-let._ xxxvii (1906). 230 ff.; cf. _Comptes rendus de\r\nl’acad._ etc. 1904. ii. 206-12. Helbig finds that the Latino-Etruscan\r\nequipments of the time preceding Hellenic influence, as shown by\r\narchaeology, correspond closely with those of the Salii, whom he regards\r\ntherefore as religious survivals from that early civilization. It is from\r\narchaeological data, combined with the well-known equipment of the Salii,\r\nthat the close resemblance between the early Latino-Etruscan and the\r\nMycenaean military system is established.\r\n\r\n[403] Not merely the chief, as Helbig, _Comptes rendus_, 1900. 517,\r\nsupposes. The ἠνίοχοι καὶ παραβάται who fought at Delium, and whom he\r\nrightly regards as a survival from the age of war-chariots, acted as a\r\ncompany not as individuals; Diod. xii. 70. 1.\r\n\r\n[404] Helbig, _Le Currus du roi Romain_, in _Mélanges Perrot_, 167 f. It\r\nwas like that chiseled on a gravestone found by Dr. Schliemann on the\r\nacropolis of Mycenae, in the main identical with the Homeric chariot,\r\nrepresented in later time on the famous sarcophagus at Clazomenae;\r\nPellegrini, in Milani, _Studi e materiali_, i. 91-3, 98.\r\n\r\n[405] That the army of Romulus—the primitive Roman army—was a single\r\nlegion, and that the Servian reform consisted accordingly in doubling\r\nit, is an ancient hypothesis accepted by some moderns, as Smith, _Röm.\r\nTimokr._ 38 f. An organization in definite numbers, however, as 1000 from\r\neach tribe, cannot arise till the state has grown sufficiently populous\r\nto make up the army of a part only of its available strength, when folk\r\nand army have ceased to be identical (Schrader, _Reallex._ 350), and it\r\nis agreed that this condition was not reached till after the adoption of\r\nthe Servian reform; Delbrück, _Gesch d.

The assumption of Helbig, _Comptes\r\nrendus_, 1904. ii. 209, that the army was composed of patricians only\r\nis altogether unwarranted. Equally groundless is the notion of Soltau,\r\n_Altröm.

The circumstance does not prove that the Romans were\r\nthen in subjection to the Etruscans.\r\n\r\n[423] Some of the ancients derive classis from calare, “to call,” hence\r\n“summoning;” Dion. Hal. iv. 18. 2; Quint. _Inst._ i. 6. 33; accepted by\r\nWalde, _Lat. Etym. Wörterb._ 125; Soltau, _Altröm. Volksversamml._ 242;\r\nLange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 464. Others connected it with κᾶλος “firewood,”\r\nhence “gathering;” Serv. _in Aen._ i. 39; Isid. _Etym._ xix. 1. 15;\r\nSchol. Luc. i. 306. Corssen, _Ausspr._ i. 494, proposes to derive it from\r\na root “clat,” which appears in the Greek κλητεύειν (Lat. *clat-ē-re),\r\nGerm. laden, which would still give the meaning “summoning;” cf. Curtius,\r\n_Griech. Etym._ 139; Vaniček, _Griech. Lat. etym. Wörterb._ 143 (*cla-t,\r\ncla-t-ti-s). Mommsen accepted the meaning “summoning” in the early\r\neditions of his _History_, but rejects it in the _Staatsrecht_, iii. 262\r\nf. (cf. his _History_, English ed. i. 1900. 115 f., 118) on the ground\r\nthat however adapted it may have been to the later political classes, it\r\ncould not well apply to the fleet and army, and hence could not belong\r\nto the earlier use of the word, which denoted the line in contrast with\r\nthose who fought outside the line. But against his reasoning it could be\r\nurged that classis with the idea of “summoning” first applied to the line\r\nof heavy infantry—the only effective part of the army; and when once the\r\nconnotation of “line” had been established, it could easily extend to the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\n[424] Gell. vi (vii). 13: “‘Classici’ dicebantur non omnes, qui in\r\nquinque classibus erant, sed primae tantum classis homines, qui centum\r\net viginti quinque milia aeris ampliusve censi erant. ‘Infra classem’\r\nautem appellabantur secundae classis ceterarumque omnium classium, qui\r\nminore summa aeris, quod supra dixi, censebantur.

On the basis of these\r\nsources we could reckon an increase to 1800, 3600, or 5400 according\r\nto our assumption as to the number of horsemen to the century; cf.\r\nGerathewohl, _Die Reiter und die Rittercenturien_, 3-8.\r\n\r\n[439] Helbig, in _Hermes_, xl (1905). 101, 105, 107.\r\n\r\n[440] Livy i. 13. 8; Dion. Hal. ii. 13. 1 f.; Fest. ep. 55.\r\n\r\n[441] Cic. _Rep._ ii. 20. 36: Livy i. 36. 2, 7; Fest. 344. 20; ep. 349.\r\nWriters differ slightly in the form of the names.\r\n\r\n[442] P. 73, n. 7.\r\n\r\n[443] This distinction of rank among the patrician centuries of the\r\ncomitia centuriata is proved by the expression “proceres patricii” in\r\nthe Censoriae Tabulae, quoted by Fest. 249. 1: “Procum patricium in\r\ndescriptione classium, quam fecit Ser. Tullius, significat procerum. I\r\nenim sunt principes;” Cic. _Orat._ 46. 156: “Centuriam fabrum et procum,\r\nut censoriae tabulae loquuntur, audeo dicere, non fabrorum aut procorum.”\r\nMommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 109, n. 1, has rightly referred it to one\r\nof the sex suffragia, for no century outside this group could have been\r\nso designated; cf. Livy ii. 20. 11, who speaks of the cavalry as proceres\r\niuventutis. The mention of a century of leading patricians implies the\r\nexistence of one or more centuries of the less distinguished members of\r\nthe same rank, which must have been the rest of the sex suffragia. The\r\nsuperior rank of the equites in early Rome is proved by Dion. Hal. ii.\r\n13. 1; iv. 18. 1; Livy i. 43. 8 f.; ii. 20. 11. In ii. 24. 2 Livy implies\r\nthat the patricians did not serve on foot (militare), and in iii. 27. 1\r\nhe speaks of a patrician who, as an exception among his rank, served on\r\nfoot because of his poverty. In ii. 42 f. he distinguishes the cavalry\r\nfrom the infantry as patricians from plebeians. The fact that in the\r\npolitical conflict between the two social classes the patricians often\r\nthreatened to carry on foreign wars with the aid merely of their clients\r\n(cf. Dion. Hal. x. 15, 27 f., 43) proves that the phalanx was essentially\r\nplebeian. On the honorable place of the equites in the camp, see Nitzsch,\r\nin _Hist. Zeitschr._ vii (1862). 145. That the sex suffragia remained\r\npatrician down to the reform of the comitia centuriata is probable; cf.\r\nSallust, _Hist._ i. 11, who represents the struggle between the social\r\nclasses as continuing to the opening of the war with Hannibal; see also\r\nMommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 254.\r\n\r\n[444] Dion. Hal. ii. 7. 4; cf. Polyb. vi. 25. 1; Varro, _L. L._ v. 91:\r\n“Turma terima (e in u abiit) quod ter deni equites ex tribus tribubus\r\nTitiensium Ramnium Lucerum fiebant: itaque primi singularum decuriones\r\ndicti, qui ab eo in singulis turmis sunt etiamnunc terni;” cf. Curiatius,\r\nin Fest. 355. 6.\r\n\r\n[445] Cf. Polyb. vi. 25. 1.\r\n\r\n[446] Three hundred is given as normal by Polyb. i. 16. 2; vi. 20. 9.\r\nIn iii. 107. 10 f. he states it at 200, increased to 300 when to meet\r\nextraordinary cases the legion was strengthened to 5000; cf. ii. 24.\r\n3. Livy, xxii. 36. 3, agrees with the latter statement. Mommsen, _Röm.\r\nStaatsr._ iii. 477, believes that the normal number was 300, decreased to\r\n200 when a greater number of legions was levied.\r\n\r\n[447] Niese, _Hist. Zeitschr._ xcviii (1907). 283, rightly assumes that\r\nthe first and second classes at Athens were not cavalry; Helbig is right\r\nin understanding them to be mounted hoplites. Niese’s criticism (ibid.\r\n287 and n. 1) of Helbig’s view is not convincing.\r\n\r\n[448] Considerable time was required for the establishment of the\r\nearliest known meaning of classis before the second and third divisions\r\nwere added.\r\n\r\n[449] This is a conjecture of Bruncke, in _Philol._ xl (1881). 362,\r\nfavored by Delbrück, _Gesch. d. Kriegsk._ i. 222.\r\n\r\n[450] P. 79, 86.\r\n\r\n[451] Usually scholars (cf. Domazewski, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._\r\niii. 1953 f.; Delbrück, _Gesch. d. Kriegsk._ i. 227; Smith, _Röm.\r\nTimokr._ 39) assume fifteen centuries for the fifth rating, on the\r\nauthority of Livy i. 43. 7; Dion. Hal. iv. 17. 2; vii. 59. 5. But our\r\nknowledge of the phalanx is only inference, which to be acceptable must\r\nhave at least the merit of possibility. The number fifteen is wrong\r\nbecause it could not have been divided evenly between the two legions;\r\nand on the other hand it will be shown later (p. 208) that in all\r\nprobability the fifteenth century was not military but was added in the\r\nmake up of the comitia centuriata.\r\n\r\n[452] Müller, in _Philol._ xxxiv (1876). 129, is right in supposing that\r\nthe legion was strengthened between the time of Servius and 387, but it\r\nwas not in the way he assumes. The tradition of a legion (half phalanx)\r\nof 4000 men is preserved in Livy vi. 22. 8.\r\n\r\n[453] Polyb. vi. 20.\r\n\r\n[454] Cf. Smith, _Röm. Timokr._ 121 ff.\r\n\r\n[455] Livy iv. 46. 1: “Dilectum haberi non ex toto passim populo placuit:\r\ndecem tribus sorte ductae sunt. Ex his scriptos iuniores duo tribuni ad\r\nbellum duxere.” If this passage does not state a historical fact, at\r\nleast it gives the idea of the writer as to the custom of earlier time.\r\n\r\n[456] P. 72, 76.\r\n\r\n[457] Cf. Smith, _Röm. Timokr._ 51 ff.\r\n\r\n[458] In time of especial danger, however, the legion was increased to\r\nfive thousand; Polyb. vi. 20. 8.\r\n\r\n[459] Cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 268, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[460] That the phalanx was a comparatively late institution at Rome, or\r\nthat it was slow in becoming the only military system, is indicated by\r\nthe survival in tradition of a more primitive mode of warfare. Sometimes\r\nin the early republic a single gens with its clients took the field; for\r\nthe Fabian gens, see Livy ii. 48 ff. Often the patricians threatened to\r\narm their clients, to carry on a war without the aid of the troublesome\r\nplebeians; cf. Dion. Hal. x. 15, 27 f., 43. As there was no motive in\r\nlater time for the invention of such stories, they must contain a kernel\r\nof real tradition; hence they could not go back to the sixth century, and\r\nit is difficult to believe that they are so old as the fifth.\r\n\r\nCollateral evidence that the second and third divisions were instituted\r\nrelatively late may be found in the circumstance that the scutum, the\r\ndistinctive piece of armor of these divisions, was introduced no earlier\r\nthan the age of Camillus—the period of the war with Veii and the Gallic\r\nconflagration; Livy viii. 8. 3; Müller-Deecke, _Etrusker_, i. 366. It\r\nwas Samnite (Athen. vi. 106, p. 273 f.; cf. Sall. _Cat._ 51), and was\r\ntherefore probably adopted in the fourth century when Rome first came\r\ninto contact with that people.\r\n\r\n[461] It is evident to the reader that these proportions are those of the\r\ndiscriptio centuriarum of Livy and Dionysius (p. 66 above), and it will\r\nbe made clear below (p. 86) that the ratings were originally in terms of\r\niugera, the minima of the five ratings being in all probability 20, 15,\r\n10, 5, and 2½ or 2 iugera respectively.\r\n\r\n[462] For the date, see Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 334 f.; Kubitschek,\r\nin Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iii. 1902 f.; Pais, _Storia di Roma_, I.\r\nii. 13, 33 f.\r\n\r\n[463] There may be some truth in the etymology suggested by Varro, _L.\r\nL._ v. 89; cf. Soltau, _Altröm. Volksversamml._ 256.\r\n\r\n[464] Cf. Liers, _Kriegsw. d. Alten_, 46.\r\n\r\n[465] Dionysius Hal. iv. 17. 1, includes the fourth rating in the phalanx\r\nof heavy infantry. For other possibilities of arrangement, see Smith,\r\n_Röm. Timokr._ 46 f.\r\n\r\n[466] Thuc. v. 68; p. 86 above.\r\n\r\n[467] Delbrück, _Gesch. d. Kriegsk._ i. 229; Smith, _Röm. Timokr._ 45\r\nff. That the second and third divisions of the phalanx were sometimes\r\nwithdrawn to operate on the flanks (Soltau, _Altröm.

An objection to his idea is that the military centuries as\r\nwell as the legions were formed anew at each year’s levy (Polyb. vi.\r\n20, 24), whereas the political centuries were made up by the censors\r\n(cf. Cic. _Rep._ ii. 22. 40: “In una centuria censebantur”), doubtless\r\nmodified annually by the consuls. A military century and a political\r\ncentury accordingly could not have been composed of the same men.\r\n\r\nThe Tabulae Iuniorum contained the names of all juniors in honorable\r\nservice in the field; Livy xxiv. 18. 7. Tabulae Seniorum are not\r\nmentioned. Classis Iuniorum (Fest. 246. 30) may apply to all eighty-five\r\n(or eighty-four) centuries of juniors, as Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 474,\r\nsupposes, or to the first class; Tubero, _Historiae_, i, in Gell. x.\r\n28. 1: “Scripsit Servium Tullium regem, populi Romani cum illas quinque\r\nclasses iuniorum census faciendi gratia institueret.” It is doubtful\r\nwhether there was a separate list of seniors.\r\n\r\n[482] Cic. _Rep._ ii. 22. 40: “Illarum autem sex et nonaginta centuriarum\r\nin una centuria tum quidem plures censebantur quam paene in prima classe\r\ntota.”\r\n\r\n[483] Soltau, _Altröm.

Fest. 249. 1: “In descriptione classium quam fecit\r\nSer. Tullius.” The attempt of Smith, _Röm. Timokr._, especially 140\r\nff., to prove that the five classes were introduced by the censors of\r\n179 has nothing in its favor. It rests upon Livy xl. 51. 9: “Mutarunt\r\nsuffragia, regionatimque generibus hominum causisque et quaestibus\r\ntribus descripserunt.” This passage makes no reference to the classes.\r\nIn “generibus hominum” are included chiefly the “genus ingenuum” and\r\nthe “genus libertinum.” “Causis” applies to those conditions of the\r\nlibertini, such as the possession of children of a definite age, which\r\nmight serve as a ground for enrolment in a rural tribe; and “quaestibus”\r\nrefers to the distinction between landowners and the “opifices et\r\nsellularii” of the city. “They changed the arrangement for voting, and\r\ndrew up the tribal lists on a local basis according to the social orders,\r\nthe conditions, and the callings of men;” cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii.\r\n265 f.; p. 354 f. below. Among the many objections to Smith’s theory\r\nthese two may be mentioned: if the classes were introduced at this\r\nlate historical time, (1) they would not have been ascribed to Servius\r\nTullius; (2) they would have been adapted to the economic conditions of\r\nthe second century B.C., whereas in 179 they were largely outgrown by\r\nthe depreciation of the standard of value, the increase in the cost of\r\nliving, and the growth of enormous estates. The _Römische Timokratie_ is\r\nably written, but its main thesis—the institution of the classes in the\r\nsecond century B.C.—remains unproved.\r\n\r\n[500] P. 64.\r\n\r\n[501] _Verf. d.

Staatsr._ iii. 247 ff.; Kübler,\r\nin Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iii. 2631. When the change was made\r\nfrom a land to a money rating, the land of the fifth class was appraised\r\nrelatively higher than that of the others. Neumann, _Grundherrsch. d.\r\nröm. Rep._ 9 f., prefers to assume 16 (= 2 + 14) iugera for the highest\r\nclass in order to explain the often mentioned estates of seven and\r\nfourteen iugera. But it is difficult to work out a consistent scheme on\r\nthis basis. Smith, _Röm. Timokr._ 78 ff. et passim, strongly objects\r\nto the view in any form, as he doubts the existence of the Servian\r\nclasses. In general he has greatly exaggerated the difficulties of their\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n[503] Sall. _Iug._ 86; Gell. xvi. 10. 14, 16; cf. Cass.

Babelon, _Trait. d. mon. Grecq. et Rom._ i. 595, still\r\nholds the view that the triental _as_ was introduced in 269; cf. his\r\n_Orig. d. la mon._ 376; _Mon. d. la rép. Rom._ i. 37.\r\n\r\n[506] P. 66 f.\r\n\r\n[507] As silver is at present worth 51¼ cents an ounce (so quoted in\r\nNew York, Sept. 5, 1908), a denarius (= ⅟₇₂ lb. Troy) of the coinage\r\npreceding 217 is worth by weight today 8½ cents. A more just comparison\r\nwould be based on the present coined values. As a dollar contains 371¼\r\ngrains of silver, a denarius would be worth 21½ cents; or with a liberal\r\nallowance for the alloy, we might say about 20 cents. The sesterce, ¼\r\ndenarius, would therefore be equivalent to five cents. An estate of\r\n100,000 asses of heavy weight (sesterces) would be worth about $5000, of\r\nthe sextantarian standard $2000. It is hardly possible that so large a\r\nproportion of the population as was contained in the first class should\r\naverage the former amount of wealth to the family. In fact the purchasing\r\npower of money was enormously higher than these equivalents indicate. In\r\n430 the value of an ox or cow was legally set at 100 libral asses and of\r\na sheep at ten. Reckoning a beef at the low modern value of $45, and a\r\nsheep at $4.50, we obtain a value of 45 cents for the libral _as_, or 22½\r\ncents for one of 5 oz. weight (sesterce), which would give the denarius a\r\npurchasing power of 90 cents.\r\n\r\n[508] _Röm.

That it\r\nwas the minimal rating of the fifth class, and not a still lower rating\r\nfor military use only, is proved by a statement of Sall. _Iug._ 86, that\r\ntill the time of Marius the soldiers were drawn from the classes.\r\n\r\n[514] Cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 251.\r\n\r\n[515] Commercially the denarius was then, after 217, worth sixteen asses;\r\nHultsch, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ v. 209.\r\n\r\n[516] Cic. _Rep._ ii. 22. 40; Gell. xvi. 10. 10.\r\n\r\n[517] XVI. 10. 10.\r\n\r\n[518] Cf. Kübler, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iii. 1522.\r\n\r\n[519] This interpretation differs slightly from that of Mommsen, _Röm.\r\nStaatsr._ iii. 237.\r\n\r\n[520] In like manner those possessing above 100,000 asses were at times\r\ndivided into groups for the distribution of military burdens according\r\nto wealth; cf. Livy xxiv. II. 7-9. This too has no reference to the\r\norganization of the comitia.\r\n\r\n[521] _N. H._ xxxiii. 3. 43: “Maximus census C̅X̅ assium fuit illo\r\n(Servio) rege, et ideo haec prima classis.”\r\n\r\n[522] Fest. ep. 113.\r\n\r\n[523] VI (VII). 13.\r\n\r\n[524] Plut. _Popl._ 21; Huschke, _Verf. d.

But the military pay was still reckoned at ten asses to the\r\ndenarius (Pliny, _N. H._ xxxiii. 3. 45); the censors seem to have used\r\nthe same ratio (Livy xxxix. 44. 2 f. compared with Plut. _Cat. Mai._\r\n18); and it is therefore highly probable that in this statement Polybius\r\nintended to express in drachmas the value of 100,000 asses. Taken in\r\nits entirety, the passage sufficiently proves that reference is to the\r\nhighest class; the majority (οἱ πολλοί) of soldiers, he says, have\r\nbreastplates, but those rated above 10,000 drachmas wear cuirasses. If,\r\nas Belot, _Rév. écon. et mon._ 77 ff., imagines, the sum of 100,000 asses\r\nfell below the rating of the lowest class, there would hardly have been a\r\nsoldier without the cuirass.\r\n\r\n[529] Gaius ii. 274. That registration was necessary is proved by Cic.\r\n_Verr._ II. i. 41. 104 ff. By the word “censi” Cicero does not mean to\r\ndesignate any group or division of citizens; he simply refers to the\r\nfact of registration. P. Annius Asellus, of whom he speaks, had not been\r\nregistered, or in any case at that sum, and hence was not technically\r\nliable to the law; but the value of his estate could be ascertained by\r\nauthority of a court of justice, according to Greenidge, _Leg. Proced._\r\n95 f. Mommsen held the opinion, on the contrary (_Abhdl. d.

Gerathewohl, _Die Reiter und die Rittercent._ 49 ff., whose\r\ninterpretation is preferable to that of Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii.\r\n257, n. 5. The fact that the support of one knight was considered equal\r\nto that of three legionaries (Livy xxix. 15. 7) is further evidence that\r\nthe triple pay covered the purchase and keep of the horse. Reference in\r\nLivy vii. 41. 8, may be to the sums (aera) for the purchase and keep of\r\nthe horse; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 257, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[557] Dionysius Hal. vi. 44. 2, assigns the first recruiting of the\r\nequites from the plebeians to the year 494, dating the event about a\r\ncentury too early; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 478, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[558] Livy v. 7. 5.\r\n\r\n[559] All this may be gathered from Livy v. 7. 4-13; cf. Gerathewohl,\r\n_Die Reiter und die Rittercent._ 16 ff.\r\n\r\n[560] Polyb. vi. 19. 2; Livy xxvii. 11. 14.\r\n\r\n[561] Livy xxvii. 11. 14, 16. This passage does not refer to those who\r\navoided duty equo privato, as Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 478, n. 2,\r\nsupposes. Those were punished who were qualified to serve equo publico\r\nbut had avoided military duty altogether. Gerathewohl, ibid. 20 f.,\r\nbelieves that Livy has made a mistake in assigning this judgment to the\r\ncensors of 209, as it would much better suit the conditions of 214.\r\n\r\n[562] The credit of establishing this fact beyond a doubt is due to\r\nGerathewohl, _Die Reiter und die Rittercent._ 14-34.\r\n\r\n[563] _N. H._ xxxiii. 1. 30: “Equitum nomen subsistebat in turmis equorum\r\npublicorum;” cf. Fest. ep. 81: “Equitare antiqui dicebant equum publicum\r\nmerere.”\r\n\r\n[564] P. 75.\r\n\r\n[565] There were four legions each with 4000 infantry and 300 horse at\r\nthe opening of the First Punic War; Polyb. i. 16. 2. Four legions fought\r\nagainst Pyrrhus at Asculum, 279; Dion. Hal. xx. 1. This was the normal\r\nnumber for the Samnite wars; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 477.\r\n\r\n[566] Two legions of juniors was the maximal limit of Rome’s military\r\nstrength during the period of twenty-one tribes; cf. p. 77, 84. The\r\nincorporation of the Veientan territory, 387, could not at once have\r\ndoubled this force.\r\n\r\n[567] Livy xxv. 3. 1-7; cf. Gerathewohl, _Die Reiter und die Rittercent._\r\n54. The sources do not suggest that the number after reaching eighteen\r\nhundred remained unalterable. In Cic. _Rep._ ii. 20. 36 (“Deinde equitum\r\nad hunc morem constituit, qui usque adhuc est retentus”) reference\r\nis not to number but to character; Gerathewohl, ibid. 8 f. Mommsen’s\r\ninterpretation (_Röm.

Hal. vi. 13. 4: Ἔστιν ὅτε shows that the number varied; cf.\r\nMadvig, _Röm. Staat._ i. 171.\r\n\r\n[572] Suet. _Aug._ 38.\r\n\r\n[573] Cic. _Rep._ ii. 22. 39; Livy i. 43. 8 f.; Dion. Hal. iv. 18. 1.\r\nHigh birth and great wealth are emphasized, but no definite rating of\r\nthe class is given. Their treatment of the subject is compatible with\r\nthe view that the knights were then patrician—a view however which\r\nthese writers did not have clearly in mind. Livy’s statement (iii.\r\n27. 1) that a certain patrician served in the infantry because of his\r\npoverty harmonizes well with the same view; for as the aes equestre and\r\nhordearium were not yet introduced, a poor patrician would be unable\r\nto own and keep a horse. Those scholars therefore seem to be wrong\r\nwho, like Grathewohl, ibid. 67, following Rubino, in _Zeitschr. f. d.\r\nAltertumswiss._ iv (1846). 219, refer the equestrian census to Servius\r\nTullius.\r\n\r\n[574] P. 94. It is for about this time (403) that Livy, v. 7. 5, first\r\nrefers definitely to an equestrian census.\r\n\r\n[575] This fact is most clearly stated by Dion. Hal. vii. 59. 3, and is\r\nconfirmed by Cic. _Rep._ ii. 22. 39.; cf. Pliny, _N. H._ xxxiii. 3. 43;\r\nfor further evidence, see Belot, _Rev. écon. et mon._ 5 ff.\r\n\r\n[576] P. 92.\r\n\r\n[577] Hor. _Ep._ I. i. 57; Pliny, _N.

Cic. _Div._ ii. 33. 70: “Non enim sumus ii\r\nnos augures, qui ... futura dicamus;” cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 331;\r\nAust, _Relig. d. Römer_, 198.\r\n\r\n[580] Serv. _in.

On the nuptial auspices, see De Marchi, _Cult. priv. di\r\nRom._ i. 152-5.\r\n\r\n[582] Romulus consulted the rest of the gods along with Jupiter; Dion.\r\nHal. ii. 5. 1.\r\n\r\n[583] The public auspices were Jupiter’s alone; Cic. _Leg._ ii. 8. 20.\r\nSo were the auspical chickens; _Div._ ii. 34. 72; 35. 73; cf. Mommsen,\r\n_Röm. Staatsr._ i. 77, n. 2. In historical time the sign called for was\r\nJupiter’s lightning; Cic. _Div._ ii. 18. 42; _Vatin._ 8. 20; _Phil._ v.\r\n3. 7. The epithet Elicius, notwithstanding Varro, _L. L._ vi. 95; Livy\r\ni. 20. 7; 31. 8, does not find its explanation in the auspices; Aust, in\r\nRoscher, _Lex. Myth._ ii. 656 ff.; Wissowa, _Relig. u.

No one could\r\nimagine Attus Navius, the swineherd, to have been a patrician, and\r\nyet he was the most famous of private augurs; Cic. _Div._ i. 17. It\r\nis significant, too, that the great authority on private auspices, P.\r\nNigidius Figulus, author of _Augurium privatum_ in several books (Gell.\r\nvii. 6. 10), was a plebeian.\r\n\r\n[587] Livy iv. 2. 5 f.\r\n\r\n[588] Livy iv. 6. 1 f.\r\n\r\n[589] Livy vi. 41. 5 f.\r\n\r\n[590] Cic. _Div._ ii. 36. 76: “Nos, nisi dum a populo auspicia accepta\r\nhabemus, quam multum iis utimur?” i. 16. 28.\r\n\r\n[591] Rubino, _Röm. Verf._ 46, n. 2, has pointed out that the phrase\r\nauspicia publica occurs only in Livy iv. 2. 5, where he believes it to be\r\nused in a special sense. In the time of Cicero no one but an antiquarian\r\never thought of any other kind of auspices.\r\n\r\n[592] Livy x. 8. 9.\r\n\r\n[593] The usual view, represented by Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 89,\r\nn. 1, is that the plebeians did not possess this right originally but\r\nacquired it later; cf. also Wissowa, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._\r\nii. 2581; Di Marchi, _Cult. priv. di. Rom._ i. 233. This hypothesis not\r\nonly lacks support, but is also vitiated by the fact that at the time of\r\nthe supposed equalization private auspices must have been declining, as\r\nCicero found them extinct.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of private auspices here given is supplementary to the\r\nstudy of the social classes made in ch. ii.\r\n\r\n[594] Messala, in Gell. xiii. 15. 4; Fest. 157. 21; Rubino, _Röm.

Staatsr._ i. 96 ff.\r\n\r\n[597] Messala, _De auspiciis_, i, in Gell. xiii. 15. 4; Bouché-Leclerq,\r\nibid. ii. 581.\r\n\r\n[598] Messala, ibid.\r\n\r\n[599] As when for instance the consul forbids the minor magistrate to\r\n“watch the sky” on an appointed comitial day; Gell. xiii. 15. 1: “In\r\nedicto consulum, quo edicunt, quis dies comitiis centuriatis futurus sit,\r\nscribitur ex vetere forma perpetua: ne quis magistratus minor de caelo\r\nservasse velit.”\r\n\r\n[600] _Commentarium Anquisitionis_ of a quaestor, in Varro, _L. L._ vi.\r\n91: “Auspicio operam des et in templo auspices, dum aut ad praetorem\r\naut ad consulem mittas auspicium petitum.” This passage shows that the\r\nquaestor, though asking permission, himself holds the auspices.\r\n\r\n[601] The first alternative is held by Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 89,\r\nwhereas Wissowa, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ ii. 2584, is inclined\r\nto the latter.\r\n\r\n[602] Gell. xiv. 7. 4, 8, quoting Varro.\r\n\r\n[603] _Leg._ iii. 3. 10: “Omnes magistratus auspicium iudiciumque\r\nhabento.” The previous paragraph is concerned with the tribunes, and\r\nin this citation the use of iudicium instead of imperium points to the\r\ntribunes. It is hardly possible that Cicero in his _Laws_ would give the\r\ntribunes a right they did not possess.\r\n\r\n[604] In Gell. xiii. 15. 4. Wissowa, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ ii.\r\n2583, seems therefore to be incorrect in excluding the tribunes from the\r\nright.\r\n\r\n[605] In stating that the tribunes were given the right to take auspices\r\nfor their assemblies, Zonaras, vii. 19, evidently confuses the oblativa\r\nwith the impetrativa. It is an interesting fact that according to Cicero\r\nthe first college of tribunes was elected under auspices in the comitia\r\ncuriata; Frag. A. vii. 48: “Itaque auspiciato postero anno tr. pl.\r\ncomitiis curiatis creati sunt.”\r\n\r\n[606] Cic. _Div._ ii. 34. 71: “Hic apud maiores nostros adhibebatur\r\nperitus, nunc quilubet.” As in the time of Cicero auspices had come to\r\nbe a mere pretence (p. 118), an attendant without skill or scruple would\r\nbest serve the magistrate’s purpose. In Livy iv. 18. 6, the augurs see\r\nthe omen for the dictator, but some other attendant might serve the\r\npurpose. Being a paid functionary, the bird-seer mentioned by Dion. Hal.\r\nii. 6. 2 as assisting in an auspication could not have been a public\r\naugur; Valeton, in _Mnemos._ xviii. 406 ff.; Wissowa, _Relig. u. Kult. d.\r\nRömer_, 456, n. 8. The magistrate requested assistance in the following\r\nform: “Q. Fabi, te mihi in auspicio esse volo;” and the reply was\r\n“Audivi;” Cic. _Div._ ii. 34. 71; cf. § 72. From this formula it appears\r\nthat the person summoned did not hold, but assisted in, the auspices;\r\nLange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 338. The auspices are always said to belong not to\r\nthe augurs, but to the magistrates; Cic. _Leg._ iii. 3. 10; Messala, in\r\nGell. xiii. 15. 4. Instead of remaining with the augurs in the city the\r\nauspices followed a duly elected consul into the field; Livy xxii. 1.\r\n6. Auspicari is strictly a function of the magistrate (cf. Varro, _Rer.\r\nhum._ xx, in Non. Marc. 92) though the word is sometimes applied to the\r\nobservation made by augurs (Fest. ep. 18), whose function is properly\r\ntermed augurium, augurare; Aust, _Relig. d. Römer_, 200 f.; Wissowa, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ ii. 2580 f.\r\n\r\n[607] The derivation is unknown. Wissowa, in Pauly-Wissowa,\r\n_Real-Encycl._ ii. 2313 f., summarizes the principal theories.\r\nProbability seems to favor the view that it is a combination of the root\r\nof avis with a verbal noun meaning “to see” or the like; Walde, _Lat.\r\netym. Wörterb._ 55.\r\n\r\n[608] Attus Navius from his boyhood was renowned for his augural skill;\r\nCic. _Div._ i. 17; Livy i. 36; Dion. Hal. iii. 70 f.; cf. Lange, _Röm.\r\nAlt._ i. 333. Romulus, too, is said to have been an excellent augur;\r\nRemus possessed similar skill (Cic. _Div._ i. 2. 3; 17. 30; 40. 89;\r\nEnnius, in Cic. _Div._ i. 48. 107), and in the opinion of Livy, i. 18. 6;\r\niv. 4. 2, there was no augural college before Numa.\r\n\r\n[609] Varro, _L.

The great sacerdotal\r\ncolleges were more political than religious, and the college of augurs\r\nwas the most thoroughly political of all; Bouché-Leclerq, in Daremberg et\r\nSaglio, _Dict._ i. 564.\r\n\r\n[617] Cic. _Leg._ ii. 8. 20; Dio Cass, xxxvii. 24 f.; Aust, _Relig. d.\r\nRömer_, 199; Wissowa, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ ii. 2325-30.\r\n\r\n[618] Fest. 333. 9: “Spectio in auguralibus ponitur pro aspectione; (data\r\nest) et nuntiatio, qui omne ius auspiciorum habent, auguribus non spectio\r\ndumtaxat, quorum consilio rem gererent magistratus, ut possent impedire,\r\nnuntiando quaecumque vidissent; privatis spectio sine nuntiatione\r\ndata est, ut ipsi auspicio rem gererent, non ut alios impedirent\r\nnuntiando.”—Valeton’s emendation, in _Mnemos._ xviii (1890). 455 f.\r\n\r\n[619] Cic. _Leg._ ii. 8. 21: “Quique agent rem duelli quique domi\r\npopularem, auspicium praemonento ollique obtemperanto;” cf. Lange, _Röm.\r\nAlt._ i. 332.\r\n\r\n[620] It generally happened that both the augural and pontifical colleges\r\nwere filled by statesmen, so that Cicero could lay down the principle\r\nthat the sacred and political offices were held by the same persons;\r\n_Div._ i. 40. 89; cf. Wissowa, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ ii. 2321.\r\n\r\n[621] Livy iv. 7. 3; viii. 23. 14-17; xxiii. 31. 13; xlv. 12. 10; Cic.\r\n_Phil._ ii. 33. 83; _Leg._ ii. 12. 31; _N. D._ ii. 4. 11. A defect in the\r\nauspicia impetrativa was expressed by the formula “vitio tabernaculum\r\ncaptum esse” (Cic. _N. D._ ii. 4. 11; _Div._ i. 17. 33; Livy iv. 7.\r\n3; Serv. _in Aen._ ii. 178), whereas the phrase “vitio creatum esse”\r\nor the like (Livy viii. 15. 6; 23. 14; xxiii. 31. 13; xlv. 12. 10;\r\nPlut. _Marcell._ 4) denoted a failure to take the auspices or to heed\r\nunfavorable omens; Wissowa, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ ii. 2334. On\r\nthe annulment of laws through augural decrees, see Cic. _Leg._ 8. 21; 12.\r\n31; _Div._ ii. 35. 74. The decree was no more than an opinion, on which\r\nthe senate acted; Rubino, _Röm.

Staatsr._ i. 98, n. 6, supposes this to be\r\nthe auspication of the censor’s entrance into office (cf. 81, n. 1),\r\nbelieving that assemblies which did not vote were unauspicated. But cf.\r\np. 111, n. 1 below.\r\n\r\n[658] Dio Cass. liv. 24. 1; Cic. _Fam._ vii. 30. 1; cf. Varro, _R. R._\r\niii. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n[659] Dion.

L._ vi. 86 f.: “Ubi noctu\r\nin templum censor auspicaverit atque de caelo nuntium erit ... tum\r\nconventionem habet qui lustrum conditurus est.” Mommsen’s interpretation\r\n(_Röm. Staatsr._ i. 81, n. 2, 98, n. 6) which applies these auspices to\r\nthe censor’s entrance upon his office seems forced. It is not necessary,\r\nhowever, to suppose that this magistrate had to renew the auspices for\r\nevery day of the census-taking; Mommsen, ibid. i. 113, n. 4.\r\n\r\n[662] The current view (cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 718; Mommsen, _Röm.\r\nStaatsr._ i. 98; Karlowa, _Röm. Rechtsgesch._ i. 380; Liebenam, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1150) that no contio was auspicated\r\nappears therefore to require modification.\r\n\r\n[663] Plut. _Pomp._ 52; _Cato Min._ 42.\r\n\r\n[664] Ael. Don. in Terent. _Ad._ iv. 2. 8: “Qui malam rem nuntiat,\r\nobnuntiat, qui bonam, adnuntiat: nam proprie obnuntiare dicuntur augures,\r\nqui aliquid mali ominis scaevumque viderint.” In this late author (350\r\nA.D.) obnuntiatio is ascribed to the augurs. When Cicero says to Antony\r\n(_Phil._ ii. 33. 83) “Augur auguri, consul consuli obnuntiasti,” he does\r\nit only to find fault with the proceeding; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._\r\ni. 111, n. 2. These are the only instances known to us in which the\r\ndistinction is not observed; Mommsen, ibid.; Wissowa, in Pauly-Wissowa,\r\n_Real-Encycl._ ii. 2335; Valeton, in _Mnemos._ xix (1891). 75 ff., 229\r\nff.; Bouché-Leclerq, in Daremberg et Saglio, _Dict._ i. 582.\r\n\r\n[665] Cato, _De sacr. comm._ in Fest. 234. 33: “Quod ego non sensi,\r\nnullum mihi vitium facit;” Pliny, _N.

Staat._\r\ni. 267, supposes that the augurs had both the spectio and the nuntiatio;\r\nbut this view contradicts the clear statement of Cicero; Mommsen, _Röm.\r\nStaatsr._ 1. 109, n. 1. The fact is, as has been stated (p. 106), they\r\nhad the spectio for their own functions only, and as assistants of the\r\nmagistrates simply the nuntiatio.\r\n\r\n[671] The formula used is “in auspicio esse;” Cic. _Att._ ii. 12. 1.\r\n\r\n[672] Cic. _Leg._ ii. 8. 20 f.; iii. 4. 11; 19. 43; _N.

In this capacity the\r\naugur did not look for omens with a view to reporting them, but merely\r\nannounced those which came unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n[675] _Phil._ ii. 33. 82 f.\r\n\r\n[676] P. 115.\r\n\r\n[677] Three were present at curiate assemblies; Cic. _Att._ iv. 17. 2;\r\ncf. ii. 7. 2.\r\n\r\n[678] In this case the augur not only assisted with his special\r\nknowledge, but also acted as crier; Varro, _L.

Both measures here referred to were so popular\r\nand the magistrates were so nearly unanimous in their support that the\r\nsenate felt it could in these cases forestall the opposition of one or\r\ntwo opponents.\r\n\r\n[685] In the famous case of Bibulus against Caesar, 59; Suet. _Caes._ 20;\r\ncf. Dio Cass. xxxviii. 4. 2 f.\r\n\r\n[686] Proved by the fact that the watching of the sky by Bibulus should\r\nhave annulled the arrogation of Clodius (Cic. _Dom._ 15. 39 f.; _Har.\r\nResp._ 23. 48; _Att._ ii. 12. 2; 16. 2; _Prov. Cons._ 19. 45; Mommsen,\r\n_Röm. Staatsr._ i. 113, n. 2), which was brought about by an act of the\r\ncuriae under the presidency of the supreme pontiff. Any one competent to\r\nobserve the heavens necessarily had the obnuntiatio.\r\n\r\n[687] Cic. _Sest._ 36. 78. Probably obnuntiatio against tribunes is\r\nreferred to by Cic. _Phil._ v. 3. 7 f. and by Ascon. 68 (the last is the\r\nabolition of the Livian laws of 91), but the obnuntiating magistrate is\r\nnot known. In Cic. _Vatin._ 7. 17 (“Num quem post urbem conditam scias\r\ntribunum pl. egisse cum plebe, cum constaret servatum esse de caelo”) the\r\nprinciple is laid down that any one who has the right to obnuntiate may\r\nuse this power against a tribune. The validity of the tribunician law\r\nfor the interdiction of Cicero from fire and water was maintained on the\r\nground that no one was then watching the sky; Cic. _Prov. Cons._ 19. 45.\r\n\r\n[688] Cic. _Sest._ 37. 79; cf. 38. 83; _Phil._ ii. 38. 99; _Att._ iv. 3.\r\n3 f.; 17. 4; _Q. Fr._ iii. 3. 2 (cf. Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, iii.\r\n6; Mommsen, _Röm.

In like manner Bibulus, after obnuntiating\r\nin vain against Caesar’s agrarian law (p. 439), determined to remain at\r\nhome and continually to watch the sky for the remainder of the year. This\r\nprocedure invalidated all acts passed during that time by the assembly;\r\nCic. _Dom._ 15. 39 f.; _Har. Resp._ 23. 48; _Prov. Cons._ 19. 45.\r\n\r\n[695] This procedure too was followed by Bibulus; Dio Cass. xxxviii. 6.\r\n1; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 82, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[696] That they were two separate enactments, and not one complex statute\r\nby joint authors, is clearly indicated by Cic. _Har. Resp._ 27. 58:\r\n“Sustulit duas leges Aeliam et Fufiam;” _Sest._ 15. 33. Generally they\r\nare spoken of as separate laws, though Cicero occasionally, as _Vatin._\r\n5. 7, groups them in one. That they were plebiscites is held probable by\r\nMommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 111, n. 4.\r\n\r\n[697] When Cicero, _Vatin._ 9. 23, states that these laws survived the\r\nferocity of the Gracchi, the audacity of Saturninus, etc., he places\r\ntheir origin in the times before the Gracchi; and when he speaks of their\r\nabolition, 58, he tells us that they had been in force about a hundred\r\nyears (_Pis._ 5. 10).\r\n\r\n[698] Dio Cass. xxxviii. 13.\r\n\r\n[699] _Vatin._ 7. 18.\r\n\r\n[700] Ibid. 9. 13.\r\n\r\n[701] _Red. in Sen._ 5. 11; cf. _Har.

Claudius Marcellus, consul in 50, and by Cicero—all three\r\nbeing public augurs; Cic. _Div._ i. 47. 105; ii. 18. 42; 33. 70; 35. 75;\r\nLeg. ii. 13. 32 f.; _N. D._ i. 42. 118; in general _Div._ ii. At that\r\ntime auspices were a mere pretence; the chicken omens were forced, and\r\nthe celestial signs were not seen; Cic. _Div._ ii. 33 f., 71 f.; Dion.\r\nHal. ii. 6. On the decline of augury and the auspices, see Wissowa, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ ii. 2315, 2333.\r\n\r\n[710] Probably the jurist of that name who lived under Hadrian, and who\r\nis mentioned by Paulus, in _Dig._ v. 4. 3.\r\n\r\n[711] XV. 27. 4: “Is qui non universum populum, sed partem aliquam adesse\r\niubet, non comitia, sed concilium edicere debet.”\r\n\r\n[712] For the purpose of the present discussion the plebeian\r\nassembly—that is, the assembly which convened under the tribunes of the\r\nplebs and which issued plebiscita—is assumed to be a gathering of only a\r\npart of the people. If it admitted patricians (p. 300), and if therefore\r\nthere was no assembly comprised exclusively of plebeians, no argument\r\nwould be needed to prove the error of the conventional distinction\r\nbetween comitia and concilium.\r\n\r\n[713] In Livy iii. 16. 6, this meeting is called a concilium.\r\n\r\n[714] P. 341.\r\n\r\n[715] _Röm.

For an explanation\r\nof it, see p. 135 f.\r\n\r\n[719] A closely related question is whether concilium is ever restricted\r\nto the deliberative stage of a session preliminary to the division\r\ninto voting units, with comitia limited in a corresponding manner to\r\nthe final, voting stage of the session. A few passages, as examples\r\n(2) and (4), might be explained by such a conjecture, but others, as\r\nLivy iii. 13. 9 (“Virginio comitia habente conlegae appellati dimisere\r\nconcilium”) prove the supposition impossible. Concilium denotes the\r\nassembly in its final as well as in its initial stage, voting as well as\r\ndeliberating, whereas in ordinary political language contio is used to\r\ndenote the merely listening or witnessing assembly, whether organized or\r\nunorganized, whether called to prepare the citizens for voting or for any\r\nother purpose.\r\n\r\n[720] _Röm. Forsch._ i. 170, n. 8.\r\n\r\n[721] Ibid. i. 195 f. It is true that the plebeian assembly came to be\r\nsubject to the obnuntiatio (p. 117), but it would be absurd on this\r\nground to suppose that Livy’s statement refers especially to gatherings\r\nof the kind.\r\n\r\n[722] This statement admits that concilium here designates an assembly of\r\nthe whole people; but Mommsen does not tell us why the word applies with\r\ngreater propriety to the “patricio-plebeian” tribal assembly than to the\r\ncenturiate assembly.

Sprachk._ 41 f., rejects this etymology on the ground\r\nthat it does not harmonize with all the meanings of the word and of its\r\nderivative “conciliare”; also Gudeman, in _Thes. ling. lat._ iv. 44.\r\nCorssen, analyzing it into con-cil-iu-m, and connecting -cil- with a root\r\nkal-, “to cover,” supposes the original meaning to be simply “a joining\r\ntogether,” “a union,”—giving that signification which he considers\r\nprimary. It is equally reasonable, however, to assume the development\r\nto be (1) “a calling together,” (2) “a meeting for consultation,” (3)\r\n“a natural union of individuals of any kind.” In the third sense it is\r\napplied perhaps figuratively to inanimate things, especially the union of\r\natoms to form objects, by Lucretius i. 183, 484, 772, 1082; ii. 120; iii.\r\n805; cf. Ovid, _Met._ i. 710.\r\n\r\n[753] The meaning consultation, deliberation, clearly appears in Plaut.\r\n_Mil._ 597 ff.:\r\n\r\n    “Sinite me priu’ perspectare, ne uspiam insidiae sient\r\n    Concilium quod habere volumus. Nam opus est nunc tuto loco\r\n    Unde inimicus ne quis nostri spolia capiat consili.\r\n    Nam bene consultum inconsultumst, si id inimicis usuist,\r\n    Neque potest quin, si id inimicis usuist, opsit tibi;\r\n    Nam bene (consultum) consilium surrupitur saepissume.”\r\n\r\nAlso in 249, 1013: “Socium tuorum conciliorum et participem consiliorum”;\r\nCic. _Rep._ 17. 28: “Doctissimorum hominum in concilio”; Caes. _B. C._ i.\r\n19; Nep. _Epam._ 3. 5; Verg. _Aen._ ii. 89 (or consiliis); iii. 679; v.\r\n75; xi. 234; Livy 1. 21. 3; see also II (_a_), p. 132, and Forcellini,\r\n_Lat. Lex._ ii. 347. It is never a chance crowd; _Diff._ ed. Beck, p.\r\n47. 43: “Concilium est convocata multitudo, conventus ex diversis locis\r\npopulum in unum contrahit, coetus fortuitu congregatur.” The ancients\r\nunderstood this to be the meaning of the word; Varro _L. L._ vi. 43:\r\n“A cogitatione concilium, inde consilium,” an unsuccessful though\r\ninstructive guess; Fest. ep. 38: “Concilium dicitur a populo consensu;”\r\nIsid. _Etym._ vi. 16. 12: “Concilium a communi intentione ductum, quasi\r\ncommunicilium.” This interpretation is supported by several glosses;\r\nφιλοποιεία (_Corp. Gloss. Lat._ ii. 471. 49), συμβούλιον (ibid. ii. 107.\r\n5), coenobulium, caenobulium (ibid. iv. 321. 27). Lastly our derivative\r\n“council” points in the same direction. The meaning “deliberative\r\nassembly” has been accepted by Gudeman, in _Thes. ling. lat._ iv. 46, who\r\nhas added citations from the whole range of Latin literature.\r\n\r\n[754] Lodge, _Lex. Plaut._ i. 288; Gudeman, _Thes. ling. lat._ iv. 45.\r\n\r\n[755] Cf. Gudeman, ibid. iv. 48.\r\n\r\n[756] Cf. n. 1 and p. 132, II (_a_).\r\n\r\n[757] P. 143.\r\n\r\n[758] P. 132.\r\n\r\n[759] The notion sometimes expressed that the word applies more\r\nappropriately to a body of representatives of the component states of\r\na league is without foundation, though it is true that some foreign\r\nconcilia are of this character.\r\n\r\n[760] P. 133.\r\n\r\n[761] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[762] P. 134.\r\n\r\n[763] Thus is explained a phenomenon for which Mommsen could find no\r\nadequate reason—that the so-called “patricio-plebeian” tribal assembly\r\nwas more apt to be called concilium than were the comitia centuriata. The\r\ndeliberative feature of the concilium also explains the close approach of\r\nthe word to contio—another fact which Mommsen knew but did not understand.\r\n\r\n[764] Cf. p. 131. Notwithstanding all the confidence reposed by the\r\nmoderns in this utterance of Laelius, ‘debet’ suggests that he is\r\nproposing an ideal distinction rather than stating an actual usage.\r\n\r\n[765] P. 286, 292, 301 f.\r\n\r\n[766] Corssen, _Ausspr._ i. 51; ii. 683; Vaniček, _Griech.-lat. etym.\r\nWörterb._ 184; Walde, _Lat. etym.

Supplb. 5439:\r\n“In contione palam luci nundinis.” Another illustration is the statement\r\nof Gellius, xv. 27. 3, that wills were made in comitia calata, in a\r\ncontio of the people. Mommsen’s assumption (_Röm. Staatsr._ i. 199\r\nand n. 3) that no contio was held on a market day as a rule, to which\r\nthere were exceptions, is altogether unsatisfactory. The passages cited\r\nrefer to a law, not to a mere custom to be observed or not at the will\r\nof the magistrate. The contio which met on a market day must have been\r\nessentially different in nature from the contio which was forbidden for\r\nmarket days; cf. also Varro, _L. L._ vi. 93; Cic. _Rab. Perd._ 4. 11.\r\n\r\n[771] The calata comitia curiata is termed contio by Gell. xv. 27. 3:\r\n“Quod calatis comitiis in populi contione fieret.” Cicero, _Rab. Perd._\r\n4. 11 (cf. 5. 15) speaks of the witnessing comitia centuriata as contio,\r\nand the lustral centuriate assembly was similarly termed; _Censoriae\r\nTabulae_, in Varro, _L. L._ vi. 87: “Conventionem habet qui lustrum\r\nconditurus est.” A widespread idea (held by Karlowa, _Röm. Rechtsgesch._\r\ni. 379; Liebenam, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1149; Soltau,\r\n_Altröm.

This\r\npassage proves that a quaestor could call a contio in his own right; and\r\nthe same holds probable for the aediles.\r\n\r\n[779] It is necessary to include them in the general statement of\r\nMessala, in Gell. xiii. 16 (17). 1, that the lower magistrates had the\r\nright; cf. the note above.\r\n\r\n[780] Fest. ep. 38: “Contio significat conventum, non tamen alium, quam\r\neum, qui a magistratu vel a sacerdote publico per praeconem convocatur.”\r\nThe sacerdos is the rex sacrorum as well as the supreme pontiff. It was\r\nnecessary for the latter to hold judicial contiones; p. 259, 327. For the\r\nformer, see Varro, _L. L._ vi. 28; Macrob. _Sat._ i. 15. 9-12; Serv. _in\r\nAen._ viii. 654.

A contio, described\r\nby Livy vi. 39-41, was held by the tribunes Licinius and Sextius in\r\nthe ninth year of their tribunate, after the day of election for the\r\nfollowing year had been set. This meeting however was as much for the\r\nconsideration of the proposed laws as of their own candidacy, and hence\r\ncould not be thought of as strictly pertaining to the election. Mommsen’s\r\nopinion (_Röm.

As the\r\nsenators would not debate the merits of the proposal, but did all they\r\ncould to delay its consideration, he offered the bill to the assembly\r\nwithout their consent; and for the remainder of his consulship he brought\r\nno more bills before the senate, but referred them directly to the\r\npeople; Dio Cass, xxxviii. 2-4; cf. p. 148.\r\n\r\n[819] Dion. Hal. v. 11. 2; Plut. _Popl._ 3. Besides the king it was\r\nsupposed that the interrex and the tribunus celerum alone were competent;\r\nDion. Hal. iv. 71. 6; 75. 1. The ancient writers seem to have been\r\nbrought to this conception by a desire to contrast the despotism of the\r\nmonarchy with the liberty of the republic. But according to Livy, i. 16.\r\n5 ff., and Cicero, _Rep._ ii. 10. 20 (cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i.\r\n200, n. 6) Proculus Julius, a private person, made a speech in a contio\r\nof the regal period; and in judicial assemblies speaking by private\r\npersons was necessary; cf. Livy i. 26. For the general usage in the\r\nprimitive European assembly, see p. 169.\r\n\r\n[820] In presenting his agrarian bill to the people Caesar first called\r\non his colleague, despite the fact that the latter was known to be\r\nopposed to the measure; Dio Cass. xxxviii. 4. 1.\r\n\r\n[821] _Commentarium Anquisitionis_, in Varro, _L. L._ vi. 91. Clodius,\r\ntribune of the plebs, brought forward the two consuls into the Flaminian\r\ncircus, where they gave their sanction and formal approval of all the\r\ntribune had been saying against Cicero; Cic. _Sest._ 14. 33. On this\r\noccasion the consul Piso condemned Cicero’s consulship for its cruelty;\r\nCic. _Pis._ 6. 14; _Red. in Sen._ 6. 13. In 44 Cannutius, a tribune of\r\nthe plebs, introduced into a contio the consul Mark Antony, who spoke\r\nregarding the assassins of Caesar; Cic. _Fam._ xii. 3. 2. Earlier\r\ninstances are Livy iii. 64. 6; iv. 6. 1 f. A tribune brought the augurs\r\ninto a contio, to ask of them information concerning the auspices; Cic.\r\n_Dom._ 15. 40.\r\n\r\n[822] Although the senators were invited to sit on the platform (_Comm.\r\nAnq._ in Varro, _L. L._ vi. 91), speaking by them was exceptional; in\r\nthe assembly they were no more than eminent private persons; Dio Cass,\r\nxxxviii. 4. 4; cf. ch. 5.\r\n\r\n[823] E.g. Cic. _Att._ iv. 1. 6: “Habui contionem. Omnes magistratus\r\npraesentes praeter unum praetorem et duos tribunos dederunt.” In a\r\ncertain contio a tribune asked Scipio Aemilianus what he thought of the\r\nconduct of Ti. Gracchus; Val. Max. vi. 2. 3. At the suggestion of the\r\nconsul Piso, Fufius, a tribune, brought Pompey upon the platform and\r\nasked his opinion as to the selection of jurors for a particular case;\r\nCic. _Att._ i. 14. 1; cf. Ascon. 50. The tribune M. Servilius invited\r\nCicero to speak in a contio in support of C. Cassius (Cic. _Fam._ xii.\r\n7. 1), and it was in response to an invitation of another tribune, P.\r\nAppuleius (_Phil._ vi. 1), that he delivered the sixth _Philippic_. Other\r\nreferences to tribunician invitations are Cic. _Att._ xiv. 20. 5; Dio\r\nCass. xlv. 6. 3.\r\n\r\n[824] Ascon. 38.\r\n\r\n[825] Sall. _Iug._ 33 f.\r\n\r\n[826] The Rhodian ambassadors were introduced by the tribune Antony to\r\nthe senate (Polyb. xxx. 4. 6), as the context (cf. § 8) indicates, not as\r\nMommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 313, n. 1, supposes, to the people. There\r\nis no question, however, as to the right of a magistrate to bring such\r\npersons before the popular assembly.\r\n\r\n[827] Val. Max. iii. 8. 6: “Quid feminae cum contione? Si patrius mos\r\nsevetur, nihil.” The lex Horatia, which is alleged to have granted\r\nthe Vestal Gaia Taracia among many honors the right to give testimony\r\n[Gell. vii (vi). 7. 1-3], and which is assigned by Cuq (_Inst. jurid. d.\r\nRom._ i. 255; and in Daremb. et Saglio, _Dict._ iv. 1145) to the consul\r\nHoratius, 509, is a myth (Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 608), though doubtless\r\nin the course of the republic laws of the kind were occasionally passed,\r\nthe language of which might be quoted by the annalists (Gell. l. c.). The\r\nrule that women were intestabiles is proved by such exceptions.\r\n\r\n[828] XXXIV. 2. 11.\r\n\r\n[829] Frag. 83. 8.\r\n\r\n[830] III. 8. 6.\r\n\r\n[831] Appian, _B.

Curiatius tr. pl. productos\r\nin contionem consules compellebat ut de frumento emendo referrent.”\r\nMommsen’s interpretation (_Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 313, n. 2), that the\r\ntribunes could not summon the consuls but could compel them to speak\r\nwhen present, is not altogether satisfactory. The comment of Gellius (§\r\n7 f.: “Huius ego iuris, quod M. Varro tradit, Labeonem arbitror vana\r\ntunc fiducia, cum privatus esset, vocatum a tribunis non isse. Quae,\r\nmalum, autem ratio fuit vocantibus nolle obsequi, quos confiteare ius\r\nhabere prendendi? Nam qui iure prendi potest, et in vincula duci potest”)\r\nsupports the view given above in the text. A magistracy might afford\r\nsome degree of protection, but on the principle enunciated by Gellius\r\nthe tribune, who had the power to arrest a consul, was in a position\r\npractically to compel him to appear at a public meeting. As further\r\nexamples of the president’s power to force speaking, Cato, a tribune of\r\nthe plebs, compelled the keepers of the Sibylline books to come before\r\nthe people in contio and declare the prophecy; Dio Cass. xxxix. 15. 4;\r\ncf. also Cic. _Vatin._ 10. 24; _Att._ ii. 24; Plut. _Cic._ 9; Dio Cass.\r\nxxxvi. 44. 1.\r\n\r\n[841] P. 146.\r\n\r\n[842] P. 145, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[843] Dio Cass. xxxviii. 2-5.\r\n\r\n[844] Cic. _Att._ ii. 24. 3: “Caesar, is qui olim praetor cum esset, Q.\r\nCatulum ex inferiore loco iusserat dicere, Vettium in rostra produxit;”\r\n_Vatin._ 10. 24: “Cum L.

L._ vi. 88: “Impero qua\r\nconvenit ad comitia centuriata.”\r\n\r\n[855] Livy ii. 56. 12: “Si vobis videtur, discedite, quirites.”\r\n\r\n[856] Preparatory to voting, the plebeian tribune Laetorius ordered the\r\nremoval of all, including patricians, who were not to vote; Livy ii. 56.\r\n10: “Submoveri Laetorius iubet praeterquam qui suffragium ineant.”\r\n\r\n[857] In the case referred to in the note above, some of the young\r\npatricians stood their ground and refused to give way before the viator;\r\n§ 11; cf. Dion. Hal. ix. 48. Again on other occasions the patricians when\r\nordered refused to withdraw before the voting (cf. Livy iii. 11. 4),\r\nfrom which we may infer that the right to attend the comitia presided\r\nover by tribunes was claimed by the patricians but denied them by the\r\ntribunes. The word used in these passages to designate the removal of the\r\nunqualified is “submovere.” In Livy xxv. 3. 16 (cf. Cic. _Flacc._ 7. 15)\r\n“tribuni populum summoverunt” has reference to the adjournment of the\r\npeople to their voting divisions, and probably also to the exclusion of\r\nthose who had no right to vote; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 390, n.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[858] Acclamation was retained as a regular form of voting by the army;\r\np. 202; cf. Bernhöft, _Röm. Königsz._ 153.\r\n\r\n[859] Philochorus, 79 b, in Müller, _Frag. Hist. Graec._ i. 396. The\r\ncondemnation of the generals who fought at Arginusae was voted in the\r\nsame way; Xen. _Hell._ i. 7. 9.\r\n\r\n[860] Cf. Schröder, _Deutsche Rechtsgesch_. 16.\r\n\r\n[861] It is interesting in this connection that in the Homeric assembly\r\nthe heralds (κήρυκες), who were a sacerdotal class, kept order; cf.\r\n_Il._ ii. 97 f. In the German assembly the priests with coercive power\r\nmaintained quiet; Tac. _Germ._ ii. 3; Schröder, _Deutsche Rechtsgesch_.\r\n22 f. The Irish assemblies were of religious origin, and maintained some\r\nreligious features till after the introduction of Christianity; Ginnell,\r\n_Brehon Laws_, 42, 44.\r\n\r\n[862] They excluded on the one hand comitia for religious purposes\r\npresided over by a political magistrate—for instance, the comitia\r\ncenturiata under the censor for the lustrum (p. 141)—and on the other the\r\nmeetings of the people under pontifical presidency for secular business,\r\nsuch as an appeal to the comitia from the pontifical imposition of fines\r\n(cf. Livy, xl. 42. 9), the meeting of the plebs under the supreme pontiff\r\nfor the election of plebeian tribunes after the fall of the decemvirate\r\n(Cic. _Cornel._ in Ascon. 77; Livy, iii. 54. 5, 11), and the meeting of\r\nseventeen tribes for the election of sacerdotes. In the three exceptional\r\ninstances last mentioned the comitia are tributa, which are never calata.\r\n\r\n[863] Kindred words are calendae, Calabra, calator. As late as Plautus\r\n(_Pseud._ 1009; _Merc._ 852; _Rud._ 335) a common use of calatores was\r\nto designate slave messengers; cf. Fest. ep. 38; _Corp. Gloss. Lat._ ii.\r\n95. 42: δοῦλοι δημόσιοι. This use became obsolete, but the word continued\r\nto apply to certain assistants of the sacerdotes; Serv. _in Georg._ i.\r\n268; _Corp. Gloss. Lat._ ii. 96. 3; iv. 214. 1; v. 275. 1; 595. 34,\r\n63; 563. 66; _CIL._ vi. 712, 2053. 5; 2184-90, 3878; x. 1726; also the\r\n_inscr._ recently discovered in the Forum; cf. Holzapfel, in _Jahresb.\r\nf. Altwiss._ 1905. 263, 265 ff.; Warren, in _Am. Journ. of Philol._\r\nxxviii (1907). 249-72. In all the known instances they were freemen,\r\noften freedmen; Saglio, in Daremberg et Saglio, _Dict._ i. 814. For other\r\ncitations, see Samter, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iii. 1335 f. They\r\ncorrespond to the lictors of the magistrates.\r\n\r\n[864] Varro, _L. L._ v. 13: “Nec curia Calabra sine calatione potest\r\naperiri.”\r\n\r\n[865] Saglio, in Daremberg et Saglio, _Dict._ i. 814; Humbert, ibid.\r\ni. 1375. But the comitia curiata were convoked by lictors according to\r\nGell. xv. 27. 2: “Curiata (comitia) per lictorem curiatum calari, id\r\nest convocari”; Theophilus, _Paraphr. Inst._ ii. 10. 1. Possibly the\r\nlictor curiatius (or curiatus; _CIL._ iii. 6078) should in this case be\r\nidentified with the calator.\r\n\r\n[866] Labeo, in Gell. xv. 27. 1 f.: “Calata comitia esse, quae pro\r\ncollegio pontificum habentur aut regis aut flaminum inaugurandorum causa;\r\neorum autem alia esse curiata, alia centuriata.” From this statement we\r\nlearn that the calate assemblies for inaugural purposes were organized\r\neither in curiae or in centuries. As “comitia” connotes organization (p.\r\n135), we may be sure that in all calata comitia the people stood in their\r\nvoting groups. On the centuriate comitia calata, see p. 156.\r\n\r\n[867] Varro, _L. L._ v. 13; vi. 27; Fest. ep. 49; Macrob. _Sat._ i. 15. 9\r\nf.; _Fast. Praenest. Kal.

L._ vi. 27 (note below).\r\n\r\n[871] Varro, _L. L._ vi. 27: “Primi dies mensium nominati Kalendae,\r\nquod his diebus calantur eius mensis nonae a pontificibus, quintanae\r\nan septimanae sint futurae in Capitolio in curia Calabra”; _Hemerol.\r\nPraenest._ Ian. 1, in _CIL._ i.² p. 231: “Hae et (aliae pri) mae calendae\r\nappellantur, quia (eorum pri) mus is dies est quos pont(i)fex minor\r\nquo(vis anni) mense ad nonas sin(gulas currere edicit in capi)tolio in\r\ncuria cala(bra)”; Macrob. _Sat._ i. 15. 9 f.: “Pontifici minori haec\r\nprovincia delegabatur, ut novae lunae primum observaret aspectum visamque\r\nregi sacrificulo nuntiaret. Itaque sacrificio a rege et minore pontifice\r\ncelebrato idem pontifex calata, id est vocata in Capitolium plebe iuxta\r\ncuriam Calabram ... quot numero dies a Kalendis ad Nonas superessent\r\npronuntiabat.” Serv. _in Aen._ viii. 654 and Plut. _Q. R._ 24 are\r\ninexact, and still more confused is Lyd. _Mens._ iii. 7; cf. Mommsen,\r\n_Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 39, n. 1. In the opinion of Mommsen the announcement\r\non the calends was not to an assembly, but was merely preparatory to the\r\nassembly on the nones; but the words of Macrobius (vocata ... plebe)\r\nclearly indicate a gathering of the people on that day.\r\n\r\n[872] Varro, _L. L._ vi. 13, 28; Macrob. _Sat._ i. 15. 12; cf. Herzog,\r\n_Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 109 and n. 1. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 40,\r\nn. 2, warns us against confusing “this unorganized contio” with the\r\ncomitia calata, which are always organized in curiae or in centuries.\r\nLabeo, in Gell. xv. 27. 1, states, however, that calata comitia were\r\nheld for the inauguration of the king and priests. If for this occasion\r\nthe purely passive assembly was organized in voting divisions, there can\r\nbe no reason for doubting that it was organized also on the occasion\r\nin question, when it met in the assembly-place of the calata comitia—a\r\nplace which could not be opened sine calatione—and its convocation was\r\ndesignated by “calare” not “vocare.” It is significant that the phrase\r\n“calata contio” is never used. Mommsen gives no authority or reason for\r\nhis assumption; cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 398; Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._\r\ni. 111; Marquardt, _Röm. Staatsv._ iii. 283, 323; Wissowa, _Relig. u.\r\nKult. d. Römer_, 440, for the view here maintained that the assembly for\r\nhearing the calendar was calata.\r\n\r\n[873] Macrob. _Sat._ i. 15. 9.\r\n\r\n[874] For the inauguration of the flamen Dialis, see Gaius i. 130; iii.\r\n114; Ulpian, Frag. 10. 5; Livy xxvii. 8. 4; xli. 28. 7; the flamen\r\nMartialis, Livy xxix. 38. 6; xlv. 15. 10; Macrob. _Sat._ iii. 13. 11;\r\nthe flamen Quirinalis, Livy xxxvii. 47. 8; cf. Wissowa, _Relig. u. Kult.\r\nd. Römer_, 420, n. 3. The inauguration of augurs probably took place in\r\ntheir own college.\r\n\r\n[875] For the inauguration of the rex sacrorum, see Livy xxvii. 36. 5;\r\nxl. 42. 8. Livy’s description of the inauguration of Numa (i. 18. 6-9)\r\nprobably follows the historical usage in the case of the rex sacrorum.\r\n\r\n[876] Serv. _in Aen._ vi. 859.\r\n\r\n[877] Aust, _Relig. d.

The origin of the inauguration must have preceded that\r\nof the centuriate assembly; it must therefore have taken place for a time\r\nin some other form of meeting.

The similarity\r\nof this oath to the detestatio sacrorum warrants the conclusion that\r\nit, too, was taken in the calata comitia. The abjuration of one’s rank,\r\nhowever, was not a detestatio sacrorum, for the reason given in n. 8\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n[938] Dio Cass. xxxvii. 51. 1: Καὶ πρὸς τὰ τοῦ πλήθους δικαιώματα, ἐς\r\nαὐτόν σφων τὸν σύλλογον ἐσελθὼν, μετέστη; Cic. _Att._ i. 18. 4: “C.\r\nHerennius ... tribunus pl. ... ad plebem P. Clodium traducit.” Cicero’s\r\nfollowing statement (“Idemque fert, ut universus populus in campo Martio\r\nsuffragium de re Clodi ferat”) signifies that Herennius was proposing to\r\nbring the question not before the centuries, as Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch.\r\nRoms_, ii. 188, n. 3, imagines, for a tribune had no means of doing\r\nso, but before the thirty-five tribes, who were the universus populus\r\n(Cic. _Leg. Agr._ ii. 7. 16 f.) in contrast with the curiate comitia\r\nrepresented by thirty lictors; cf. p. 129 f.\r\n\r\n[939] The falsification of pedigrees by plebeian families to prove\r\ndescent from patrician ancestors of the same name is sufficient evidence\r\nthat the name was retained through the transition; cf. Lange, _Kleine\r\nSchriften_, ii. 7 f. Were not the sacra retained, the transition of\r\nan entire gens would mean the destruction of its old religion and the\r\ncreation of a new one—which is impossible. For this reason it appears\r\nthat the detestatio sacrorum did not apply to such cases of transition.\r\n\r\n[940] Lange, ibid. ii. 19.\r\n\r\n[941] The fact that he promulgated a bill of the same tenor as that of\r\nHerennius, even if it was merely for the sake of appearance, as Cicero,\r\n_Att._ i. 18. 5, alleges, favors the latter view.\r\n\r\n[942] Cic. _Att._ i. 19. 5.\r\n\r\n[943] Dio Cass. xxxvii. 51. 2; xxxviii. 12. 1 f.; Cic. _Dom._ 13. 35; 29.\r\n77.\r\n\r\n[944] Cic. _Dom._ 14. 37: “Nam adoptatum emancipari statim, ne sit\r\neius filius qui adoptarit”; 13. 35: “Tu (Clodi) neque Fonteius es, qui\r\nesse debebas, neque patris heres neque amissis sacris paternis in haec\r\nadoptiva venisti.” In _Har. Resp._ 27. 57 (“Iste parentum nomen, sacra,\r\nmemoriam, gentem Fonteiano nomine obruit”) Cicero does not say that\r\nClodius assumed the gentile name of Fonteius, but rather that he used\r\nthis name as a means of destroying the name, sacra, etc. of his parents;\r\nand in fact he continued to be called Clodius; cf. Dio Cass. xxxix. 23.\r\n2 (official use). He claimed still to belong to the Clodian gens rather\r\nthan to the Fonteian (Cic. _Dom._ 44. 116), whereas Cicero, looking upon\r\nthe emancipation as a sham, insists that he was a Fonteian.\r\n\r\n[945] That he retained the Claudian imagines is implied in Cic. _Mil._\r\n13. 33; 32. 86. He must therefore have kept the rest of the sacra.\r\n\r\n[946] Lange, _Kleine Schriften_, ii. 23 ff. Cicero aims to bring the\r\ngreatest possible confusion into the case by representing Clodius as\r\nhaving given up his native religion without receiving that of Fonteius,\r\nas being a gentilis of the Claudii though he had left the Claudian gens,\r\netc.; _Dom._ 13. 35; 49. 127.\r\n\r\n[947] This double act is most clearly stated by Livy iv. 4. 7:\r\n“Nobilitatem istam vestram ... non genere nec sanguine sed per\r\ncoöptationem in patres habetis ... post reges exactos iussu populi”;\r\np. 17, n. 5; cf. Dion. Hal. v. 40. 5: Ἡ βουλὴ καὶ ὁ δῆμος εἴς τε τοὺς\r\nπατρικίους αὐτὸν (Appius Claudius) ἐνέγραψε. This passage shows that\r\nDionysius regards the process as an act of the people and of the senate,\r\nthough he does not speak of the latter as coöptation. In the case of\r\nAppius Claudius Livy, ii. 16. 5, says simply that he was enrolled among\r\nthe patres (“inter patres lectus”), and in like manner Suetonius, _Tib._\r\ni, states that the patrician gens Claudia was coöpted into the class of\r\npatrician gentes.\r\n\r\n[948] V. 13. 2.\r\n\r\n[949] Fest. 246. 23.\r\n\r\n[950] This measure is called the lex Cassia; Tac. _Ann._ xi. 25; p. 456\r\nbelow. There can be no doubt that the author was L. Cassius Longinus, a\r\nfaithful friend of the dictator, who entered upon his tribunate Dec. 10,\r\n45; Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, ii. 128 f.; iii. 602.\r\n\r\n[951] Dio Cass. xliii. 47. 3; xlv. 2. 7; Suet. _Caes._ 41.\r\n\r\n[952] The lex Saenia; Tac. _Ann._ xi. 25.\r\n\r\n[953] Augustus, _Mon. Ancyr._ 8; Dio Cass. lii. 42. 5.\r\n\r\n[954] Neither the pontifical examination nor the curiate law is noticed\r\nby the authorities, who refer briefly to the two acts. Lange, _Röm. Alt._\r\niii. 472, and Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 1101, suppose that Caesar\r\nas supreme pontiff made the adlectio, although, as Mommsen notices,\r\nOctavianus had not yet attained to that office when he attended to\r\nthe same function. Both writers (cf. Lange, ibid. i. 412) understand\r\nthe curiate assembly to have been a factor in the process. On these\r\nlate adlectiones, see also Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ ii. 38 f., 130;\r\nDrumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, iii. 602; Büdinger, in _Denkschr. d.\r\nkaiserl. Akad. d. Wiss. Phil.-hist.

Suet. _Tib._ 1: “Patricia\r\ngens Claudia ... in patricias cooptata.”\r\n\r\n[961] Mommsen’s theory (_Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 29 and n. 2) that the\r\npatriciate was conferred through the coöperation of the king and the\r\ncomitia appears accordingly to rest on a weak foundation. He gives\r\nno evidence, but bases his contention on the argument (1) that the\r\ncommunity was sovereign, (2) that—the patriciate being in his opinion\r\nequivalent to the citizenship and the comitia curiata being a group\r\nof gentes—the downfall of the comitia made the reception of gentes\r\nimpossible. Ground is taken against the theory of popular sovereignty in\r\nthe following chapter. Against his second point it can be urged that the\r\noriginal comitia were neither patrician nor “gentile”; hence there is no\r\noccasion for speaking of the downfall of such comitia or of its sweeping\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n[962] Livy iv. 4. 7; p. 17, n. 5, 164, n. 6.\r\n\r\n[963] Mommsen, _Röm. Forsch._ i. 74 ff.\r\n\r\n[964] Gell. v. 19. 1-3.\r\n\r\n[965] Such an examination was the only means by which the patricians\r\ncould protect their order from being flooded by plebeians; cf. Mommsen,\r\nibid. i. 77, who notices that no known instance of this kind of adoption\r\ntook place before the admission of plebeians to the pontifical college\r\nthrough the Ogulnian law, 300; p. 309 below.\r\n\r\n[966] Schrader, _Reallexikon_, 924; Spencer, _Principles of Sociology_,\r\nii. 407.\r\n\r\n[967] _Il._ i. 54; ii. 50; xix. 40 ff.; _Od._ ii. 6 f.\r\n\r\n[968] Kovalevsky, _Modern Customs and Ancient Laws of Russia_, 122, 124.\r\n\r\n[969] We must except the purely sacerdotal meetings of the curiae\r\ndescribed in the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\n[970] Tac. _Germ._ 11. 2; cf.

The prominence of the\r\nnobles in the Slavic assembly (Kovalevsky, ibid. 123 ff.) would lead to\r\nthe same conclusion regarding them. For the Homeric age of Greece the\r\nmeeting of the council previous to the assembly as described by _Il._ ii.\r\n50 ff. is typical, although we could not expect the poet in every case to\r\nrepeat the procedure with uniform minuteness.

Brunner, ibid. i. 129. The assembly also elected the chiefs of the\r\npagi (Gaue) and of the villages; Tac. _Germ._ 12. 3. The Celts who were\r\nnot ruled by hereditary kings elected their chiefs annually (Caesar, _B.\r\nG._ i. 16) or for a migration; ibid. 3.

In Homeric Greece the kingship was generally hereditary,\r\nbut the people might elect a war-leader to take command by the side of\r\nthe king; _Od._ xiv. 237; cf. xiii. 266.

Staatsr._ iii.\r\n327) that under the kings the comitia were exclusively legislative,\r\nelective and judicial functions being a republican innovation, is\r\ndisproved by the facts presented in this chapter.

Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i.\r\n307 ff. 407 f., 459, 461 f., supposes that it not only pledged the people\r\nto obedience, but also defined the imperium and bound the king not to\r\nexceed the limitations imposed; that every constitutional modification\r\nof the imperium required a corresponding modification of the curiate\r\nact. Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 111 f., further assumes that the law\r\ncontained the formula of treaty on which in his opinion the state rested,\r\nand that before the age of written documents this treaty was handed\r\ndown orally through the repetition of the law. Lange’s theory, which\r\nruns throughout his great work, seems to rest on the single statement\r\nof Tacitus, _Ann._ xi. 22: “Quaestores regibus etiam tum imperantibus\r\ninstituti sunt, quod lex curiata ostendit a L. Bruto repetita.” But this\r\nstatement proves only that the quaestors were mentioned in the curiate\r\nlaw, and this circumstance is otherwise explained below, p. 189. That the\r\nlaw defined and limited the imperium is unlikely (1) because in early\r\ntime, when the act had a real meaning, precise definitions were unknown;\r\n(2) because there is no evidence for it.\r\n\r\nP. Servilius Rullus stated, evidently in his rogation, that the object of\r\nthe curiate act to be passed for the decemviri provided for in his bill\r\nwas “ut ii decemviratum habeant, quos plebs designaverit” (Cic. _Leg.\r\nAgr._ ii. 10. 26)—a formula probably copied from earlier laws. From this\r\nstatement and from evidence furnished below (p. 185 f.) it is practically\r\ncertain that the formula for the curiate act ran somewhat like that for\r\nan election.\r\n\r\n[1093] It is true that Cicero (p. 183, n. 2) supposes the king to have\r\nbeen elected by the curiate assembly, and the imperium to have been\r\nafterward sanctioned by the same assembly. This double vote of the curiae\r\nseems as improbable as it was unnecessary. We may reasonably consider the\r\nalleged first vote a mistaken inference from the later election of higher\r\nmagistrates by the centuries. The assumption of an acclamation as the\r\nfirst stage in the process accords far better with primitive conditions.\r\n\r\n[1094] The people claimed that the right to elect magistrates had come\r\ndown to them from Servius Tullius; Appian, _Lib._ 112 (probably from\r\nPolyb.); Livy i. 60. 4; p. 360.\r\n\r\n[1095] Cic. _Leg. Agr._ ii. 11. 26: “Maiores de singulis magistratibus\r\nbis vos sententiam ferre voluerunt. Nam cum centuriata lex censoribus\r\nferebatur, cum curiata ceteris patriciis magistratibus, tum iterum de\r\neisdem iudicabatur, ut esset reprehendendi potestas, si populum beneficii\r\nsui paeniteret”; cf. 10. 26; _Rep._ ii. 13. 25.\r\n\r\n[1096] _Röm.

Staatsr._ 42-6.\r\n\r\n[1097] P. 435.\r\n\r\n[1098] It is not probable that an official could pass the law for a\r\ncolleague, the intention being that each higher magistrate should\r\npersonally propose and carry it for himself; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._\r\ni. 610, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1099] _Leg.

Agr._ ii. 11. 29: “Tum ii decemviri, inquit, eodem\r\niure sint, quo qui optuma lege.” In keeping with this statement is the\r\nobject of the curiate act as given by the Servilian rogation (p. 183, n.\r\n5).\r\n\r\n[1102] Plaut. _Most._ 713; Cic. _Off._ i. 31. 111; 42. 151; _Fin._ iv.\r\n12. 31; _Rep._ iii. 17. 27; _Cat._ i. 9. 21; _Sest._ 43. 94; _Planc._ 36.\r\n88; _Marc._ 1. 4; _Fam._ iii. 8. 6; _Att._ xv. 3. 2.\r\n\r\n[1103] Gaius ii. 197: “Proinde utile sit legatum atque si optimo iure\r\nrelictum esset; optimum ius est per damnationem legati.” It is clear that\r\nthis statement refers merely to the form.\r\n\r\n[1104] Fabius Pictor, in Gell. i. 12. 14: “Uti quae optima lege fuit, ita\r\nte, Amata, capio.”\r\n\r\n[1105] Cic. _Phil._ xi. 12. 30: “Senatui placere C.

Gen._ 67, quoted in n. above.\r\n\r\n[1110] Fest. 198. 32; cf. 189. 21. Applied to the censor, dictator, and\r\ninterrex in Livy ix. 34. 10-12, it has reference not to amount of power\r\nbut length of office.\r\n\r\n[1111] See p. 186, n. 5.\r\n\r\n[1112] As the _Lex Col. Gen._ 66 f.; p. 186, n. 1 above.\r\n\r\n[1113] P. 186.\r\n\r\n[1114] Magistratus optuma lege is the same as magistratus iustus; cf.\r\nMessala, p. 185, n. 6. In this connection iustus does not signify legal\r\nas opposed to illegal, but legally or technically perfect, correct;\r\ncf. for the meaning “proper,” “perfect,” Cic. _Fam._ ii. 10. 3 (iusta\r\nvictoria); Caes. _B. G._ i. 23 (iustum iter); Livy i. 4. 4 (iusti cursum\r\namnis); xxxix. 2. 8 (iusto proelio). When Cicero (_Red. in Sen._ 11.\r\n27), accordingly, speaks of the comitia centuriata as the iusta comitia,\r\nhe does not imply that the other comitia and their acts lack legality,\r\nbut rather that they carry less weight; and when as late as 300 the\r\npatricians claimed that they alone had iustum imperium et auspicium\r\n(Livy x. 8. 9), they could only mean that their right to these powers\r\nwas better established than that of the plebeians. C. Flaminius, consul\r\nin 217, possessed imperium, which he was actually exercising over his\r\ntroops, but which was not iustum, for he had neglected the auspical\r\nformalities appropriate to the entrance upon the consulship (Livy xxii.\r\n1. 5). It would be wrong, however, to suppose with Nissen, _Beitr. z.\r\nröm. Staatsr._ 51, that he commanded on the sufferance only of his\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n[1115] Including the auspices; see n. above.\r\n\r\n[1116] The usual expression is “de suo imperio curiatam legem tulit,”\r\nor “populum consuluit;” Cic. _Rep._ ii. 13. 25; 17. 31; 18. 33; 20.\r\n35; 21. 38; Livy ix. 38. 15. According to Cicero, _Phil._ v. 16. 45,\r\nthe senate grants the imperium to Octavianus, a private citizen. The\r\ninterrex, who could not have had a curiate law, nevertheless possessed\r\nimperium (Livy i. 17. 5 f.), and the absolute imperium was granted by a\r\ndecree of the senate (Livy iii. 4. 9; Sall. _Cat._ 29; _Hist._ i. 77.\r\n22). See also Cic. _Leg._ iii. 3. 9: “Imperia, potestates, legationes,\r\nquom senatus creverit populusve iusserit, ex urbe exeunto;” _Leg. Agr._\r\nii. 7. 17: “Omnes potestates, imperia, curationes ab universo populo\r\nproficisci convenit” (reference cannot here be to the curiate assembly,\r\nwhich in this connection Cicero does not recognize as the people). For\r\nthe centuriate assembly, see Livy xxvi. 18. 9: “Omnes non centuriae modo\r\nsed etiam homines P. Scipioni imperium esse in Hispania iusserunt;”\r\n22. 15: “Centuriam vero iuniorum seniores consulere voluisse, quibus\r\nimperium suffragio mandarunt.” For the tribal assembly, see T. Annius\r\nLuscus, _Orat. adv. Ti. Gracch._ in Fest. 314. 30: “Imperium quod plebes\r\n... dederat.” It is a fact, too, that the tribal assembly had power to\r\nabrogate the imperium; Livy xxvii. 20. 11; 21. 1, 4; xxix. 19. 6; cf. p.\r\n342, 360, 367. Also from Cic. _Leg. Agr._ ii. 11. 28 (“Vidit ... sine\r\ncuriata lege decemviros potestatem habere non posse, quoniam per novem\r\ntribus essent constituti”) we must infer that had these decemvirs been\r\nelected in the regular way, by the thirty-five tribes, they would have\r\nhad the potestas without a curiate law. The phrase nullis comitiis in\r\n11. 29 (“Si hoc fieri potest, ut ... quisquam nullis comitiis imperium\r\naut potestatem adsequi posset, etc.,”) implies that the imperium or\r\npotestas may be obtained in more than one form of comitia—either the\r\ncenturiata or the tributa. In the same paragraph he asserts that on the\r\nprinciple followed by Servilius, whom he is assailing, any one could\r\nobtain the imperium or potestas without the vote of any comitia, for he\r\ndoes not consider the comitia curiata real comitia, seeing that they have\r\ndegenerated into a mere form. From these passages it is clear that Cicero\r\nbelieved the imperium or potestas to be conferred by the centuries or\r\ntribes and merely confirmed by the curiae.\r\n\r\n[1117] Cic. _Leg. Agr._ ii. 11. 27: “Curiatis eam (potestatem) comitiis\r\n... confirmavit.”\r\n\r\n[1118] Livy ix. 38 f.; Dion. Hal. v. 70. 4: Ὃν ἃν ἥ τε βουλὴ προέληται\r\nκαὶ ὁ δῆμος ἐπιψηφίσῃ. To avoid unnecessary delay the sanctioning act\r\nwas probably always kept free from the obligation of the promulgatio per\r\ntrinum nundinum; Livy iii. 27. 1; iv. 14. 1; p. 396 f. below.\r\n\r\n[1119] The consuls proposed the curiate law for the quaestors; Tac.\r\n_Ann._ xi. 22. That these inferior officials required the law is further\r\nindicated by Cic. _Phil._ ii. 20. 50. For the lower functionaries in\r\ngeneral, see Gell. xiii. 15. 4. The agrarian rogation of Servilius Rullus\r\nprovided that the praetor should propose the law for the decemviri agris\r\nadsignandis required for the administration of his measure; Cic. _Leg.\r\nAgr._ ii. 11. 28.\r\n\r\nThat the magisterial helpers who were in need of the curiate law included\r\nnot only the quaestors but also the lictors seems to be indicated by Cic.\r\n_Rep._ ii. 17. 31: “Ne insignibus quidem regiis Tullus nisi iussu populi\r\nest ausus uti. Nam ut sibi duodecim lictores cum fascibus anteire” (the\r\nremainder of the sentence is missing). Dion. Hal. ii. 62. 1 ascribes\r\nthe introduction of the lictors to Tarquin the Elder. This curiate\r\nlaw, however, may not be thought of by Cicero and Dionysius as a mere\r\nsanction, but rather as a legislative act which called the lictors into\r\nbeing; cf. Mommsen, _Röm.

Livy, xxi. 63. 10, states that the consul dons his official\r\nrobe in his own house, but neither he nor any other authority intimates\r\nthat the public auspices were taken in his private house, as Mommsen,\r\n_Röm.

Cicero, who often refers to the\r\npostponement of the elective comitia of this year, never intimates that\r\nthe want of a lex curiata stood in the way.\r\n\r\nVarro, consul in 216, must have found it extremely difficult, though\r\nperhaps not impossible, after carrying his lex de imperio in the\r\ncomitium, to complete the consular and pretorian elections in the Campus\r\nMartius—all between sunrise and sunset on the same day; Livy xxii. 35. 4.\r\n\r\n[1151] P. 192.\r\n\r\n[1152] Dio Cass. xli. 43. 3.

F. xix (1864).\r\n606, with less success proposes translatione imperii; cf. also Herzog,\r\n_Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 679. The passage is in fact past healing, though\r\nMommsen’s reconstruction is an improvement on Rubino’s.\r\n\r\n[1165] The second inference is from the present tense of the verb\r\n“fertur.”\r\n\r\n[1166] Livy xxiv. 7-9.\r\n\r\n[1167] Ibid. 9. 3.\r\n\r\n[1168] Cf. Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 679. It is not to be assumed,\r\nhowever, that the senatus consultum had to be repeated at every such case\r\nof transition. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 175, 704 f., who gives the measure\r\na wider constitutional scope, assumes that it was a plebiscite. Mommsen,\r\n_Röm. Forsch._ ii. 413, supposes that the two consuls on entering office\r\nin 214 simply omitted the curiate sanction on the ground that they\r\nalready held the imperium, which was unlimited in duration, and that the\r\njurists accepted this procedure as constitutional. The specific motive\r\nfor this action, Mommsen asserts, was the fact that they were absent from\r\nRome at the opening of their official year. But the truth is that they\r\nwere both present (Livy xxiv. 10 f.), and had accordingly no occasion for\r\nestablishing such precedent on their own responsibility. All they did in\r\nthe matter, then, was to take advantage of a measure already enacted.\r\n\r\n[1169] Cf. Livy xxi. 63; xxii. 1.\r\n\r\n[1170] The existence of the measure of 215 proves that the curiate\r\nassembly and curiate law were at the time something more than a mere\r\nformality.\r\n\r\n[1171] Cic. _Att._ iv. 17. 2; cf. p. 113, 194, n. 2. The Ciceronian\r\npassage, our only authority on this point, seems to imply a custom.\r\n\r\n[1172] Cic. _Leg.

Agr._ ii. 11. 29; p. 227 above.\r\n\r\n[1179] Cic. _Fam._ i. 9. 25; p. 193 above.\r\n\r\n[1180] Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ ii. 905.\r\n\r\n[1181] This chapter historically follows ch. iv.\r\n\r\n[1182] Livy i. 60. 4. This is the first act which Livy records, and it is\r\nhis opinion that the last king never consulted the people; i. 49. 3. His\r\nview harmonizes with that of Dionysius, iv. 40. 3, that Servius intended\r\nto resign his office and establish a republic, had he lived.\r\n\r\n[1183] Cic. _Rep._ ii. 31. 53: “(Valerius Poplicola) legem ad populum\r\ntulit eam, quae centuriatis comitiis prima lata est.” Dionysius, iv.\r\n20. 3, supposes that Servius actually used this assembly for elections,\r\nlegislation, and declarations of war, that Tarquin the Proud set aside\r\nthe Servian arrangement (iv. 43. 1), which was restored at the beginning\r\nof the republic. The first of these ideas is an inference from republican\r\nusage, not based on knowledge of any definite act of the assembly in the\r\nregal period. In this matter, Soltau, _Altröm. Volksversamml._ 264, has\r\ngiven him too much credit.\r\n\r\n[1184] An objection to the view represented by Soltau, ibid. 270-5, that\r\nthe coöperation of the army in the overthrow of Tarquin the Proud caused\r\nits immediate transformation into the comitia centuriata, is that we\r\nhave no ground for accepting as historical the details of the overthrow\r\nto which he calls attention. In p. 285-96 he attempts to reconstruct\r\nthe earliest constitution of the republic on the theory that the army\r\nelected the consuls (283), that for a time those who were not actually on\r\nmilitary duty were excluded from a vote in the centuriate assembly. The\r\nsources give no information regarding such an assembly, and we have no\r\nright to assume it, at least as a regular, recognized institution, for\r\nany period however early. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 465, supposes that with\r\nthe founding of the republic the assembly began to diverge from the army,\r\nthe two institutions having previously been identical; cf. Guiraud, in\r\n_Rev. hist._ xvii (1881). 1.\r\n\r\n[1185] Livy ix. 13. 1.\r\n\r\n[1186] Livy vii. 16. 4.\r\n\r\n[1187] Livy v. 28. 7; vii. 36. 9.\r\n\r\n[1188] Livy viii. 31.\r\n\r\n[1189] Ibid. 32. 1.\r\n\r\n[1190] Livy viii. 32 f.\r\n\r\n[1191] Livy x. 19. 11.\r\n\r\n[1192] Livy vii. 36. 9.\r\n\r\n[1193] Ibid. ch. 37, especially § 9.\r\n\r\n[1194] Cic. _Fam._ xi. 13. 3; Livy vii. 37. 9. viii. 32. 1; ix. 13. 1; x.\r\n19. 11; xxviii. 26. 12; xl. 36. 4; xlii. 53. 1; Dion.

Staatsr._ iii. 216, 294, n.\r\n2, is of the opinion that the centuriate assembly was termed exercitus\r\nbecause it met for military exercise on the Campus Martius. But we have\r\nno evidence that the assembly ever took such exercise; in fact the drill\r\nof the proletarian mob would be hardly less ridiculous than that of the\r\nnonagenarians, both of whom had a right to vote in the assembly.\r\n\r\n[1203] IV. 84. 5.\r\n\r\n[1204] Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 216 and n. 3.\r\n\r\n[1205] Fabius Pictor, _Ann._ i, in Gell. x. 15. 3 f.: “Dialem flaminem\r\n... religio est classem procinctam extra pomerium, id est, exercitum\r\narmatum, videre; idcirco rarenter flamen Dialis creatus consul est, cum\r\nbella consulibus mandabantur.” There was no objection to this flamen’s\r\nseeing the comitia centuriata, but the armed centuries it was not lawful\r\nfor him to see. Cf. Varro, _L. L._ vi. 93: “Alia de causa hic magistrates\r\n(quaestor) non potest exercitum urbanum convocare; censor, consul,\r\ndictator, interrex potest, quod censor exercitum centuriato constituit\r\nquinquennalem, cum lustrare et in urbem ad vexillum ducere debet.” But\r\nthe term exercitus urbanus sometimes denotes the body of men enlisted for\r\nmilitary service from those who were ordinarily exempt; Livy xxii. 11. 9.\r\n\r\n[1206] Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 265, supposes that in the original\r\nform of census-taking the citizens were so arranged in companies under\r\ntheir leaders as to constitute an army ready to be led against the enemy.\r\nBut the only citation he offers (Dion. Hal. ii. 14, perhaps for iv. 22.\r\n1; see n. below) has no bearing on the matter.\r\n\r\n[1207] IV. 22, i: Κελεύσας τοὺς πολίτας ἅπαντας συνελθεῖν εἰς τὸ μέγιστον\r\nτῶν πρὸ τῆς πόλεως πεδίων ἔχοντας τὰ ὅπλα καὶ τάξας τοὺς θ’ἱππεῖς κατὰ\r\nτέλη καὶ τοὺς πεζοὺς ἐν φάλαγγι καὶ τοὺς ἐσταλμένους τὸν φιλικὸν ὁπλισμὸν\r\nἐν τοῖς ἰδίοις ἑκάστους λόχοις καθαρμὸν αὐτῶν ἐποιήσατο.\r\n\r\n[1208] _L. L._ vi. 86: “Censor ... praeconi sic imperato ut viros\r\nvocet.... Omnes quirites pedites armatos, privatosque curatores omnium\r\ntribuum, si quis pro se sive pro alio rationem dari volet, vocato in\r\nlicium huc ad me” (Mommsen’s reading, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 361, n.\r\n6). Spengel reads, “Omnes quirites, (equites) pedites, magistratos\r\nprivatosque, curatores,” etc., in which armatos does not appear.\r\n\r\n[1209] Such an inspection by the censors, if it ever existed, must have\r\nfallen early into disuse (cf. Mommsen, ibid. iii. 397); but we could more\r\nreasonably suppose that the inspection of the arms and of the physical\r\ncondition of the men always belonged to the officers who attended to the\r\nlevy; Polyb. vi. 20.\r\n\r\n[1210] Cf. Livy xliii. 14. 8: “Censores edixerunt ... qui in patris aut\r\navi potestate essent, eorum nomina ad se ederentur.” The father gave the\r\ncensus of his son; Fest. ep. 66: “Duicensus (census of two) dicebatur\r\ncum altero, id est cum filio census;” Dion. Hal. ix. 36. 3. The son was\r\nclassed according to the census of the father; Livy xxiv. 11. 7.\r\n\r\n[1211] Cic. _Leg._ iii. 3. 7; Dion. Hal. iv. 15. 6; v. 75. 3; Gell. iv.\r\n20. 3 ff.\r\n\r\n[1212] Notwithstanding Genz, _Centuriatverf._ 11; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i.\r\n477.\r\n\r\n[1213] Polyb. vi. 20 ff. The Romans were of the opinion that the same\r\nprinciple held for the earliest times; Varro, _L. L._ v. 89; Dion. Hal.\r\niv. 14; cf. Soltau, _Altröm. Volksversamml._ 337.\r\n\r\n[1214] Polyb. vi. 19. 2.\r\n\r\n[1215] The five classes contained accordingly 80, 20, 20, 20, and 28\r\ncenturies respectively; cf. p. 66 f., 77; see also table on p. 210. A\r\ngreat difference exists between Livy and Dionysius, on the one hand,\r\nand Cicero, on the other, as to the number of centuries in the highest\r\nclass. Cicero (_Rep._ ii. 22. 39: “Nunc rationem videtis esse talem, ut\r\nequitum centuriae cum sex suffragiis et prima classis addita centuria,\r\nquae ad summum usum urbis fabris tignariis est data, LXXXVIIII centurias\r\nhabebat”) states that the eighteen centuries of knights, the centuries of\r\nthe first class, and one century of mechanics amounted to eighty-nine,\r\nwhich would give but seventy to the first class. The most satisfactory\r\nexplanation of this difficulty seems to be that Cicero, while professing\r\nto describe the earlier centuriate system, had in mind a formative stage\r\nof the new organization, in which the first class comprised seventy\r\ncenturies; p. 67, 215, n. 2. On the number in the fifth class, see p. 66,\r\n77, 208.\r\n\r\n[1216] P. 68.\r\n\r\n[1217] The two are mentioned by Livy i. 43. 3 and Dion. Hal. iv.\r\n17. 3; vii. 59. 4. Pliny, _N. H._ xxxiv. 1. 1, speaks of a guild of\r\ncoppersmiths, and Plut. _Num._ 17, refers to the same guild and to that\r\nof the carpenters, ascribing both to Numa as founder. Cicero, _Rep._ ii.\r\n22. 39; _Orat._ 46. 156, mentions only the century of carpenters. Placing\r\nthis century with the first class, he either overlooks that of the smiths\r\nor wishes to reckon it with the second class (cf. Huschke, _Verf. des\r\nServ._ 153). As he reckons the total number of centuries at one hundred\r\nand ninety-three, he has allowed for both.\r\n\r\n[1218] Plut. _Num._ 17; also n. above.\r\n\r\n[1219] I. 43. 3.\r\n\r\n[1220] _Rep._ ii. 22. 39; cf. n. 2 above.\r\n\r\n[1221] IV. 17. 3.\r\n\r\n[1222] Cf.

Qui priusquam renuntiarentur iure vocatis tribubus....\r\nCalvus ita verba fecit.” We might amend this evidently corrupt passage\r\neither by changing praerogativa to the plural, as do Müller (2d ed.\r\n1888) and Weissenborn (8th ed. 1885), thus making it refer to the\r\nequestrian centuriae. At the same time we might read iis revocatis (scil.\r\npraerogativis). The passage would then apply to the Servian arrangement.\r\nOr we could bring it to the support of the reformed order by reading\r\ncreat (cf. Madvig). The preferable interpretation of the qui priusquam\r\n... tribubus clause seems to be “Before they could be declared elected\r\non the official reports from the tribes,” the official reports being\r\ncounted tribe by tribe, as will hereafter appear; p. 225. See also on\r\nthis passage, Plüss, _Centurienverf._ 10 ff.; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 496.\r\nHere, as often elsewhere, Ullrich, _Centuriatcom._ 14, is wrong. But it\r\nis impossible to prove or to disprove anything by the emendation of such\r\na passage.\r\n\r\n[1263] VI. 21. 5: “Omnes tribus bellum iusserunt.” As the tribal assembly\r\ndid not declare war, this passage must refer to the reformed comitia\r\n(Lange, ibid.; Plüss, ibid. 13), unless omnes tribus is carelessly used\r\nto designate the unanimous vote of the populus Romanus. The assembly\r\ntributim mentioned by Livy vii. 16. 7 for the year 357 was tribal, not\r\ncenturiate as Ullrich, ibid. 15, supposes.\r\n\r\n[1264] In fact some scholars have assigned the reform to the decemvirs,\r\n451; cf. Peter, _Epoch. d. Verfassungsgesch._ 75; Soltau, _Altröm.\r\nVolksversamml._ 361 ff.\r\n\r\n[1265] P. 77 f., 214.\r\n\r\n[1266] X. 22. 1: “Eumque et praerogativae et primo vocatae omnes\r\ncenturiae.” Praerogativae refers to the equestrian centuriae and hence\r\nto the Servian organization. It is hazardous, however, to make so much\r\ndepend on a single letter; should final e be dropped from this adjective,\r\nthe sentence would still read correctly.\r\n\r\n[1267] P. 57 f., 66 f., 86 f.\r\n\r\n[1268] I. 43. 12.\r\n\r\n[1269] Cf. xxiv. 7. 12 (215 B.C.): “Eo die cum sors praerogativae Aniensi\r\niuniorum exisset”; 9. 3: “Praerogativae suffragium iniit ... eosdem\r\nconsules ceterae centuriae ... dixerunt”; xxvi. 22. 2 f.; xxvii. 6. 3.\r\n\r\n[1270] Livy xl. 51 is evidence that the censors had power to make changes\r\nas extensive as these.\r\n\r\n[1271] Mommsen, _Röm. Trib._ 108, preferred Fabius, and his view has\r\nbeen accepted by Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 499; Herzog, _Röm.

But in his _Staatsr._ iii. 254, n.\r\n4, 270, n. 3, following Göttling, _Gesch. d. röm. Staatsverf._ 383, he\r\nchanges his preference to Flaminius on the ground that the conflict\r\nbetween the patricians and the plebeians continued to the war with\r\nHannibal (Sall. _Hist._ i. 9. 11), ending, as he supposes, in the opening\r\nof the six patrician centuries of knights to the plebeians—a change which\r\nhe connects with the reform under discussion. His reasoning as to the\r\ndate is not cogent, and is outweighed by the consideration given in the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n[1272] II. 21.\r\n\r\n[1273] XXI. 63; cf.

Tullio summam non convenire”\r\n(Nor need we be surprised that the arrangement as it now exists after the\r\ntribes have been increased to thirty-five, their number being doubled\r\nin the centuries of juniors and seniors, does not agree with the total\r\nnumber instituted by Servius Tullius).\r\n\r\n[1277] IV. 21. 3: Οὑτος ὁ κόσμος τοῦ πολιτεύματος ἐπὶ πολλὰς διέμεινε\r\nγενεὰς φυλαττόμενος ὑπὸ Ῥωμαίον· ἐν δὲ τοῖς καθ’ ἡμᾶς κεκίνηται χρόνοις\r\nκαὶ μεταβέβληκεν εἰς τὸ δημοτικώτερον, ἀνάγκαις τισὶ βιασθεὶς ἰσχυραῖς,\r\nοὐ τῶν λόχον καταλυθέντων, ἀλλὰ τῆς κρίσεως (or κλήσεως) αὐτῶν οὐκέτι τὴν\r\nἀρχαίαν ἀκρίβειαν φυλαττούσης, ὡς ἐγνων ταῖς ἀρχαιρεσίαις αὐτῶν πολλάκις\r\nπαρών. (After this arrangement had continued many generations, carefully\r\npreserved by the Romans, it has assumed in our time a more democratic\r\ncharacter, driven into this new course by certain powerful forces. The\r\ncenturies were not abolished, but the decision of their votes has lost\r\nits former carefulness—or we may read, the calling of the centuries no\r\nlonger retains its precise order. This fact, he tells us, he himself\r\noften noticed when present at elections.)\r\n\r\nIf κρίσεως, supported by most MSS., is retained, it should refer to the\r\nequalization of power among the classes; κλῆσεως would probably mean that\r\nthe prerogative century was now drawn by lot.\r\n\r\n[1278] P. 77 f.\r\n\r\n[1279] _Röm. Gesch._ iii. 374 ff.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the first step was the reduction of the first\r\nclass to seventy centuries, the ten centuries deducted being at the same\r\ntime added to the lower classes. This view will explain Cic. _Rep._ ii.\r\n22. 39, which otherwise must be considered a mistake; p. 67, 205, n. 5.\r\n\r\n[1280] P. 213, n. 5.\r\n\r\n[1281] Ihne, _Hist. of Rome_, iv. 12, concludes that the change was\r\ngradual. The line of development suggested by Plüss, _Centurienverf._,\r\nhowever, is ill supported by the evidence. Guiraud, _Rev. hist._ xvii\r\n(1881). 1 ff., also accepts the view of a gradual reform but minimizes\r\nits importance.\r\n\r\n[1282] The citations below refer to a plurality of classes for the\r\nperiod following the reform, without mentioning a definite number; Sall.\r\n_Iug._ 86; Cic. _Rep._ iv. 2. 2; _Flacc._ 7. 15; _Red. ad Quir._ 7. 17;\r\nSymmachus, _Pro Patre_, 7 (Seeck); Auson. _Grat. Act._ iii. 13; ix. 44\r\n(Peiper); p. 287, 293 (Bip.). In his speech for the Voconian law, 169,\r\nthe elder Cato, in Gell. vi. 13. 3, referred to the distinction between\r\nthe classici and those who were infra classem, from which we may conclude\r\nthat the distinction existed in his time. The agrarian law of 111 (_CIL._\r\ni. 200. 37) mentions the first class; also Livy xliii. 16. 14. The\r\nfirst and second are spoken of by Cic. _Phil._ ii. 33. 82. Ullrich’s\r\nview (_Centuriatcom._), resting on these passages, is that there were\r\nbut two classes, one of seniors another of juniors. Besides involving\r\nmany impossibilities, it is refuted by the frequent references to the\r\ncontinuance of the census as an element in the system (see note below)\r\nand by the occasional mention of the five classes. The latter number for\r\nthe time of C. Gracchus is given by Pseud. Sall. _Rep. Ord._ 2. 8. This\r\nwork, though late, is generally considered good authority; cf. Greenidge,\r\n_Hist. of Rome_, i. 237 f. Five are mentioned also by Gell. vi (vii). 13.\r\n1; Serv. _in Aen._ vii. 716; Arnob. _Adv. Nat._ ii. 67, with no definite\r\nreference to a particular period. Cicero’s allusion (_Acad. Pr._ ii. 23.\r\n73) to the fifth class implies at least that the five classes were then\r\nfresh in the memory. The mention of an amplissimus census for the time\r\nof Cicero by Ascon. _in Pis._ 16, proves the existence of more than two\r\nclasses at the time. These citations, together with the fact that no\r\nother definite number but five is ever spoken of by the ancient writers,\r\nmust lead to the conclusion that there was no change.\r\n\r\n[1283] To the time of Marius the soldiers were still drawn from the\r\ncensus classes; Polyb. vi. 19. 2; Sall. _Iug._ 86. The first class\r\nwas distinguished from the rest by its armor, Polyb. vi. 23. 15. That\r\nthe political classes likewise rested on the census is proved by Cic.\r\n_Leg._ iii. 3. 7; 19. 44; Gell. vi (vii). 13; xv. 27. 5; Ascon. _in\r\nPis._ 16. The agrarian law of 111 (_CIL._ i. 200. 37) implies a property\r\nqualification of the class mentioned (note above). These citations\r\ndispose of the hypothesis of Plüss, _Centurienverf._ 36 ff., 80, which\r\nrepresents the classes of this period as consisting of groups of tribes\r\nresting partly on the census but mainly on differences of rank.\r\n\r\n[1284] Cic. _Phil._ ii. 33. 82; Livy xliii. 16. 14; Pseud.

(To those who are on trial for\r\nlife, while the vote of condemnation is being taken, even if a single\r\ntribe of those whose suffrages are needed to ratify the sentence has not\r\nvoted, the Roman custom grants permission to depart openly, condemning\r\nthemselves to voluntary exile.) This procedure must have been in the\r\ncomitia centuriata, and hence the votes of the centuries must have been\r\ntaken or announced by tribes; cf. Klebs, in _Zeitschr. d. Savignyst._\r\nxii (1892). 220; Plüss, _Centurienverf._ 14. See also Cic. _Leg. Agr._\r\nii. 2. 4: “Meis comitiis non tabellam vindicem tacitae libertatis, sed\r\nvocem [unam] prae vobis indicem vestrarum erga me voluntatum ac studiorum\r\ntulistis. Itaque me non extrema tribus (not diribitio) suffragiorum, sed\r\nprimi illi vestri concursus, neque singulae voces praeconum, sed una\r\nvox universi populi Romani consulem declaravit.” The MSS. have tribus\r\nand there is nothing against it, though Müller, following Richter, has\r\nadopted diribitio for the Teubner text, 1896. The meaning is “In my\r\nelection you offered not merely the ballot, the vindication of your\r\nsilent liberty, but also your unanimous voice as evidence of your good\r\nwill to me and of your eagerness in my behalf. Hence it was not the last\r\ntribal group of votes but your first coming together, not the single\r\nannouncements of the criers but the unanimous voice of the entire Roman\r\npeople which declared me consul.” From this passage we may infer (1) that\r\nthe votes were cast or announced by tribes, (2) that the tribe cast more\r\nthan one vote, (3) that the result was sometimes known before the last\r\ntribe was reached. Cf. further Cic. _Phil._ vi. 5. 12; 6. 16; xi. 8. 18;\r\nLivy v. 18. 2; vi. 21. 5; viii. 37. 12; xxix. 37. 13; ep. xlix; Oros. v.\r\n7. 1; Lucan, _Phars._ v. 391 ff.; Plut. _Cat. Min._ 42.\r\n\r\n[1292] Cic. _Planc._ 20. 49: “Unius tribus pars” (i.e. the prerogative\r\ncentury); Pseudacr. Schol. Cruq. ad Hor. _Poet._ 341: “Singulae tribus\r\ncertas habebant centurias seniorum et iuniorum”; Livy i. 43. 12 f.\r\nimplies that the number of centuries was a multiple of the number of\r\ntribes, in other words that the century was an integral part of the\r\ntribe; cf. Q. Cic. _Petit._ 5. 17 f.; 8. 32; Mommsen, _Röm. Trib._ 74.\r\nThe most convincing evidence is that of inscriptions of the imperial\r\nperiod (p. 220) which prove the urban tribes to have comprised each an\r\nintegral number of centuries. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 274, has\r\ntherefore failed in his attempt to limit to the first class the division\r\nof the tribes into centuries.\r\n\r\n[1293] _Röm. Gesch._ iii. 382 f., followed by Plüss, _Centurienverf._\r\n23 ff. Niebuhr places the change in 304, when there were but thirty-one\r\ntribes, which would give for that date but sixty-two half-tribe centuries.\r\n\r\n[1294] P. 216.\r\n\r\n[1295] Niebuhr, ibid. His authorities for the two classes are Livy xliii.\r\n16. 14: “Cum ex duodecim centuriis equitum octo censorem condemnassent\r\nmultaeque aliae primae classis”; Cic. _Phil._ ii. 33. 82: “Prima classis\r\nvocatur, renuntiatur; deinde, ita ut adsolet, suffragia; tum secunda\r\nclassis vocatur; quae omnia sunt citius facta, quam dixi. Confecto\r\nnegotio bonus augur ... alio die inquit”; cf. p. 113. In the Livian\r\ncitation, however, the mention of only the first class affords no hint\r\nas to the number of classes to follow; and the keen analysis of the\r\nCiceronian passage made by Huschke, _Verf. des Serv._ 615 and n. 8,\r\nproves confecto negotio to signify not necessarily that the voting\r\nhad been finished, but rather that the comitia had advanced so far as\r\nto preclude the obnuntiatio. It should be served before the assembly\r\nconvened, not after the meeting began (“Non comitiis habitis, sed\r\npriusquam habeantur”; § 81). Confecto negotio, equivalent to comitiis\r\nhabitis, is the negative of priusquam habeantur. This interpretation\r\ndeprives the theory of two classes, held by Niebuhr, Ullrich, and others,\r\nof its only support.\r\n\r\n[1296] P. 216, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[1297] P. 216, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1298] _Verf. des Serv._ 623.\r\n\r\n[1299] Ibid. 617 ff.\r\n\r\n[1300] Ibid. 634. Similar is the view of Plüss, _Centurienverf._ 36 ff.,\r\n80, that for the period 179-86 the classes were groups of tribes based\r\npartly on the census and partly on social rank.\r\n\r\n[1301] P. 216, n. 3. The long-known hypothesis here mentioned was\r\nsufficiently refuted by Huschke, ibid. 619 ff., but has been more\r\nrecently revived by Madvig, _Röm. Staat._ i. 117 ff., who, however, so\r\ndevelops it as to make the five classes voting divisions of the century.\r\nThis notion is controverted by Genz, _Centuriatcom. nach der Ref._, and\r\ndefended without success by Gerathewohl, _Reit. und Rittercent._ 90 f.\r\n\r\n[1302] This result is in fact suggested by the passage in Livy 1. 43. 12\r\nf. (p. 217, n. 1); it is not to be wondered at that an increase in the\r\ntribes should bring about an increase in the centuries—a diminution in\r\nthe centuries could not be spoken of in the same way.\r\n\r\n[1303] P. 217.\r\n\r\n[1304] P. 218, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[1305] P. 216, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[1306] ¶ above.\r\n\r\n[1307] P. 216, n. 4.\r\n\r\n[1308] A monk who lived 1494-1567. For his view see Drackenborch’s\r\ncommentary on Livy i. 43. To the 350 centuries of juniors and seniors\r\nhe added 35 or 70 centuries of knights and a century of proletarians,\r\nmaking a total of 386 or 421 respectively. No scholar now holds to more\r\nthan 18 equestrian centuries. With this and a few other variations as to\r\nsupernumerary centuries his view has been adopted by Savigny, _Vermischte\r\nSchriften_, i. 1 ff.; Mommsen, _Röm. Trib._; Genz, _Centuriatcom. nach\r\nder Ref._; Ihne, _Hist. of Rome_, iv. 15; Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i.\r\n324; Klebs, in _Zeitschr. d. Savignyst._ xii (1892). 181-244; Schiller,\r\n_Röm.

This connection with the classes was wrongly\r\ntransferred to the tribunes of the plebs by Livy iii. 30. 7; Ascon. 76.\r\n\r\n[1311] III. 274 ff.; cf. his _History of Rome_ (Eng. ed. 1900), iii. 52 f.\r\n\r\n[1312] II. 22.\r\n\r\n[1313] _Röm.

Evidently the second hand has drawn from a reliable source (Klebs,\r\nibid. 200-210); yet in view of its uncertainty the passage should not be\r\nmade the foundation of a theory so thoroughly objectionable as Mommsen’s.\r\n\r\n[1317] To Soltau, _Jahrb. f. cl. Philol._ xli (1895). 411, n. 3, this\r\nexplanation seems “too cheap.”\r\n\r\n[1318] In the clause “Ut equitum centuriae cum sex suffrages et prima\r\nclassis addita centuria, quae ... data, LXXXVIIII centuriae habeat,”\r\ncenturiae applies to the centuries proper, but in the clause immediately\r\nfollowing, “Quibus ex centum quattuor centuriis (tot enim reliquae sunt)\r\nocto solae accesserunt,” the word on Mommsen’s supposition must denote\r\nnot the centuries themselves but the voting groups of centuries. Though\r\nMommsen usually avoids the application of the term century to the assumed\r\nvoting units, he allows himself to do so on p. 274 and in n. 2. Granting\r\nthat in this instance he has used the word correctly, we should have the\r\nfirst class composed of simple centuries and the others of centuries\r\nwhich were themselves composed of centuries—an evidently absurd result of\r\nhis assumption.\r\n\r\n[1319] Klebs, in _Zeitschr. d. Savignyst._ xii (1892). 197. Not less\r\ncomplicated is Le Tellier’s supposition (_Organ. cent._ 88, n. 1) that\r\nthe four classes may have differed in number of votes (for example, 30,\r\n28, 28, 14), and that the several voting groups of a class comprised the\r\nsame number of centuries, in some cases with a fraction of a century,\r\ne.g., 2, 2½, 2½, 5 centuries for the four classes respectively. This\r\ncombination would be as undemocratic and as impracticable as any of those\r\nproposed by Klebs.\r\n\r\n[1320] Klebs, ibid. 187.\r\n\r\n[1321] P. 214, n. 6.\r\n\r\n[1322] I. 43. 12.\r\n\r\n[1323] P. 220.\r\n\r\n[1324] P. 217.\r\n\r\n[1325] P. 216, n. 3. Soltau’s modifications, _Jahrb. f. Philol._ xli\r\n(1895). 410-4, of Mommsen’s hypothesis are no improvement on the original.\r\n\r\n[1326] _Röm. Alt._ ii. 510 ff.\r\n\r\n[1327] In this way the prerogative century, after serving as an omen\r\n(Cic. _Mur._ 18. 39), would be joined with four others of the same\r\nhalf-tribe.\r\n\r\n[1328] Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 526.\r\n\r\n[1329] Livy xliii. 16. 14 (171 B.C.): “Cum ex duodecim centuriis equitum\r\nocto censorem condemnassent multaeque aliae primae classis, extemplo\r\nprincipes civitatis ... vestem mutarunt.” This proves that the votes were\r\nmade public early in the course of the voting, though not necessarily\r\nbefore the second class began; cf. Cic. _Phil._ ii. 33. 82. Lange too\r\nhastily rejects the evidence of these two passages. The vote of each\r\ncentury was announced separately; Varro, _L. L._ vii. 42: “Quod ...\r\ncomitiis cum recitatur a praecone dicitur olla centuria,” which would not\r\nbe true, if, as Lange supposes, the announcement was by tribal groups of\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n[1330] Cf. Gerathewohl, _Reit. und Rittercent._ 90, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1331] As authority for the six votes of the eighteen equestrian\r\ncenturies Lange cites Cic. _Rep._ ii. 22. 39: “Equitum centuriae cum sex\r\nsuffrages”; _Phil._ ii. 33. 82; “Prima classis vocatur, renuntiatur;\r\ndeinde, ita ut adsolet, suffragia.” So far as these two passages are\r\nconcerned, Lange could be right; but his view is contradicted by Festus\r\n334. 29 (“Sex suffragia appellantur in equitum centuriis, quae sunt\r\nadiecta—MS. adfectae—ei numero centuriarum, quas Priscus Tarquinius rex\r\nconstituit”), which distinguishes the sex suffragia from the remaining\r\ncenturies of cavalry, and by Livy xliii. 16. 14, which gives each century\r\na vote.\r\n\r\n[1332] All the tribes voted; Livy vi. 21. 5 (a historical anticipation\r\nbut useful for showing later custom); viii. 37. 12; xxix. 37. 13 f.; ep.\r\nxlix; Val. Max. ix. 10. 1. All the centuries voted; Livy xxiv. 9. 3;\r\nxxvi. 18. 9; 22. 13; xxvii. 21. 4; xxviii. 38. 6; xxix. 22. 5; xxxi. 6.\r\n3; Cic. _Sull._ 32. 91; Pis. 1. 2; _Imp.

H._ xxxiv. 1. 1.\r\n\r\n[1337] Ascon. 75: “Postea collegia S. C. et pluribus legibus sunt sublata\r\npraeter pauca atque certa, quae utilitas civitatis desiderasset, qualia\r\nsunt (MS. quasi, ut) fabrorum fictorumque.”\r\n\r\n[1338] P. 207, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[1339] See citations in Olcott, _Thes. ling. lat. ep._ i. 51.\r\n\r\n[1340] P. 208 f.\r\n\r\n[1341] That these supernumerary centuries were abolished at the time\r\nof the reform is argued by Huschke, _Verf. des. Serv._ 622 f.; Plüss,\r\n_Centurienverf._ 28, 34; Genz, _Centuriatcom. nach der Ref._ 12; Klebs,\r\nin _Zeitschr. d. Savignyst._ xii. 218. That they continued in the new\r\nsystem is the belief of Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 281 ff.; Lange,\r\n_Röm. Alt._ ii. 512; Le Tellier, _Organ. cent._ 90.\r\n\r\n[1342] P. 220 f.\r\n\r\n[1343] The supposed Sullan reaction to the earlier form of the centuriate\r\ncomitia is not well founded; p. 406.\r\n\r\n[1344] P. 212.\r\n\r\n[1345] P. 217. This is a necessary inference from the term used to\r\ndescribe a prerogative centuria, e.g., Aniensis iuniorum. Had the drawing\r\nbeen from a group of classes, the number of the class would have been\r\nadded, e.g., Aniensis iuniorum secundae classis.\r\n\r\n[1346] Cic. _Phil._ ii. 33. 82.\r\n\r\n[1347] Livy xliii. 16. 14: “Cum ex duodecim centuriis equitum octo\r\ncensorem condemnassent multaeque aliae primae classis” (171 B.C.). This\r\npassage proves that the announcement distinguished the votes of the\r\ntwelve equestrian centuries both from the sex suffragia and from those of\r\nthe class. Cic. _Phil._ ii. 33. 82: “Sortitio praerogativae; quiescit.\r\nRenuntiatur; tacet. Prima classis vocatur, renuntiatur; deinde, ita ut\r\nadsolet, suffragia; tum secunda classis vocatur.” Here Cicero informs us\r\nthat the (sex) suffragia were announced after the report of the first\r\nclass had been given. The circumstance that he does not mention the\r\nseparate calling of the suffragia indicates that their separation from\r\nthe first class was limited to the announcement. There is no reason why\r\nthe Romans should have added to the length of the centuriate sessions by\r\nassigning a part of the day to the exclusive use of these six centuries.\r\nLivy, i. 43. 8 f., has their inferiority in mind. It is unnecessary to\r\namend the Ciceronian passage. The attempt of Holzapfel, in _Beiträge zur\r\nalten Gesch._ i (1902). 254 f., is unsuccessful. Klebs, in _Zeitschr. d.\r\nSavignyst._ xii (1892). 237 ff., fruitlessly opposes the division of the\r\nequites into these two groups.\r\n\r\n[1348] P. 74 f., 95 f., 209 f.\r\n\r\n[1349] P. 211, 467, 469.\r\n\r\n[1350] P. 201, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1351] The idea that Servius Tullius gave this assembly the right to\r\nelect kings (Dion. Hal. v. 12. 3; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 458; ii. 531) is\r\nproved wrong by the circumstance that the organization attributed to him\r\nwas purely military, from which the comitia centuriata slowly developed;\r\np. 203 ff.\r\n\r\n[1352] Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 531. On the number of praetors, see\r\nMommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 202. The election of a centurion to the\r\nfunction of dedicating a temple (Livy ii. 27. 6) in the period before the\r\nfirst secession Lange (ibid. i. 917; ii. 532) with good reason considers\r\na myth. It is doubtful, however, whether he is right in viewing as\r\nhistorical the so-called lex Valeria de candidatis, assigned to the first\r\nyear of the republic (Plut. _Popl._ 11; Lange, ibid. ii. 532), which\r\nordered the presiding magistrate to accept as candidates all qualified\r\npatricians who offered themselves for the consulship—a principle said to\r\nhave been afterward applied to other patrician offices.\r\n\r\n[1353] P. 331.\r\n\r\n[1354] Cic. _Brut._ 14. 55; cf.

Before the institution of the censorship the original\r\nmotive of the sanctioning act—to leave the curiae a share in the elective\r\nfunction—must have given way to the purpose stated by Cicero and\r\nrepresented here in the text.\r\n\r\n[1426] Livy iv. 24. 3 ff.; cf. ix. 33 f.\r\n\r\n[1427] Livy viii. 12. 16; cf. p. 300. Livy’s words referring to the\r\ncensorship are corrupt, but the passage seems to have the meaning here\r\ngiven; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 340, n. 2. It was not till 131\r\nthat advantage was taken of the provision; Livy, ep. lix. Herzog, _Röm.\r\nStaatswerf._ i. 257, refuses to believe that both censors might now be\r\nplebeian.\r\n\r\n[1428] Livy vi. 35. 5. The provision that “at least” one should be\r\nplebeian is doubtless an anticipation of the Genucian law.\r\n\r\n[1429] Livy vii. 42. 2; cf. p. 299.\r\n\r\n[1430] The alleged centuriate resolution granting a place for a dwelling\r\nto P.

On the\r\nfreedom of the dictatorship from this restriction in the period between\r\n449 and 325, see p. 241, n. 5. The court mentioned by Livy ix. 26. 6 ff.\r\n(314) seems to have been an extraordinary quaestio under the presidency\r\nof a dictator; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 165, n. 6. On the subjection\r\nof his authority to appeal, see Fest. 198. 32: “Optima lex ... in\r\nmagistro populi faciendo, qui vulgo dictator appellatur, quam plenissimum\r\nposset ius eius esse significabat, ut fuit M’.

Livy ii. 18. 4 f.; 30. 5; iv. 26. 6; Fest. 198. 4 (of the\r\ndictator); Livy iv. 46. 11; 57. 6 (of the magister equitum). In vi. 20.\r\n12, quoted above, Livy may possibly be thinking of election, which seems\r\nto have become the rule before the disuse of the office; cf. Greenidge,\r\n_Leg. Proced._ 304, 309.\r\n\r\n[1464] Livy i. 26; Fest. 297. 11.\r\n\r\n[1465] _Dig._ xlviii. 4. 11: “Qui perduellionis reus est, hostili animo\r\naduersus rem publicam uel principem animatus”; cf. Greenidge, _Leg.\r\nProced._ 303.\r\n\r\n[1466] Livy vi. 20. 12; see n. 1 above.\r\n\r\n[1467] Ibid. vi. 19. 6 ff.\r\n\r\n[1468] Cf. Ihne, in _Rhein.

Proced._ 356 and n. 1. The procedure in the\r\ntrial of C. Rabirius was in this respect similar; a law compelling the\r\npraetor to appoint duumviri is suggested by Cic. _Rab. Perd._ 4. 12.\r\n\r\n[1471] Dio Cassius, xxxvii. 27. 2, finds fault with the procedure against\r\nRabirius on the ground that the duumviri for judging him were appointed\r\nby the praetor, not elected as they should have been “according to\r\nancestral usage.”\r\n\r\n[1472] Livy i. 26. 5; Pomponius, in _Dig._ i. 2. 2. 16; Cic. _Leg._ iii.\r\n12. 27; Lange, _Röm.

Fest. 258. 29; ep. 221.\r\n\r\n[1481] Pliny _N. H._ xxxiv. 4. 13: “Camillo inter crimina obiecerit\r\nSp. Carvilius quaestor, quod aerata ostia haberet in domo.” According\r\nto Livy v. 23. 11; 32. 8 f., it was misappropriation of the Veientan\r\nspoil. Diodorus, xiv. 117. 6, states that according to one report the\r\naccusation was that he had driven white horses in his triumph. The appeal\r\nwas to the comitia centuriata; Cic. _Dom._ 32. 86. This case indicates\r\neither inconsistency in legal usage, quite possible in early time, or\r\nmore probably the union of inconsistent traditions. The facts that Pliny\r\nmentions a quaestor apparently as prosecutor, not simply as witness\r\n(Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 582), and that Cicero represents the trial as\r\nbelonging to the centuries suffice to indicate a questorian prosecution\r\nbefore that assembly. Should we venture to bring consistency to so\r\nuncertain a story, we could suppose that in his absence, the tribunes,\r\ntaking up the case, lightened the penalty to a fine.\r\n\r\n[1482] Varro, _L.

That the tribunes should\r\nmake early gains in jurisdiction, to be afterward partially lost, is\r\nthoroughly consistent with the law of plebeian progress, which consisted,\r\nnot in a steady forward movement, but in successive advances and retreats.\r\n\r\n[1504] Livy, ep. xix.; Cic. _Div._ ii. 33. 71; _N.

A different view is represented by\r\nOrelli-Baiter, Cic. _Op._ viii. 3. 252 f.\r\n\r\n[1523] The decisive evidence is a coin, described by Mommsen, _Röm.\r\nMünzwesen_, 552, representing an armed man evidently in the act of\r\ncondemning a civilian, whose appeal is indicated by the word PROVOCO\r\nbeneath. The inscription on the obverse P. LAECA reveals the author of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n[1524] _Röm. Alt._ i. 249; ii. 559.\r\n\r\n[1525] VI. 37 f.\r\n\r\n[1526] Livy, ep. lvii; cf.

Staatsr._ ii. 117, n. 2 (cf. _Röm.\r\nStrafr._ 31, n. 3) sets down as merely a pious wish of the author.\r\n\r\n[1528] Livy, ep. lv: (In the consulship of P. Cornelius Nasica and D.\r\nJunius Brutus) “C. Matienus accusatus est apud tribunos plebis, quod\r\nexercitum in Hispania deseruisset, damnatusque sub furca diu virgis\r\ncaesus est, et sestertio nummo veniit.” The new epitome, l. 207-9, speaks\r\nof desertores who on this occasion were thus flogged and sold. It is not\r\nknown that the tribunes tried cases of desertion or that they inflicted\r\nthe kind of punishment here described. C. Titius, sent for trial to the\r\ntribunes on the charge of having stirred up a mutiny (Dio. Cass. Frag.\r\n100; year 89), may have been a civilian.\r\n\r\n[1529] Plut. _C.

(1) The lex\r\nde pecunia regis Antiochi of the two Q. Petilii, tribunes in 185, for\r\nthe establishment of a special court to try L. Scipio Asiagenus and some\r\nothers for the misappropriation of public money; Livy xxxviii. 54, p.\r\n399 below.—(2) The plebiscite of M. Marcius Sermo and Q. Marcius Scylla,\r\ntribunes in 172, directed the senate to establish a special court for\r\nthe trial of M. Popillius on the charge of having unjustly subjugated\r\nand enslaved the Ligurians; Livy xlii. 21. 5.—(3) By the lex Caecilia,\r\n154, a special quaestio repetundarum was established for the trial of\r\nL. Lentulus, retired consul of 156; Val. Max. vi. 9. 10.—(4) Another\r\nspecial court for the trial of L. Hostilius Tubulus on the charge of\r\nhaving accepted bribes while president of a murder court (quaestio inter\r\nsicarios) was ordered by a plebiscite of P. Mucius Scaevola in 141,\r\nwhereupon the accused went into exile; Cic. _Fin._ ii. 16. 54; iv. 28.\r\n77; v. 22. 62; _N. D._ i. 23. 63; iii. 30. 74; _Att._ xii. 5 b; Ascon.\r\n22; Mommsen, _Röm.

The comitia\r\ntributa had long exercised the right to condemn those who had fled into\r\nexile to avoid trial; p. 249, 267, 257, n. 5 (3).\r\n\r\n[1556] Cic. _Sest._ 28. 61; cf.

Max. vi. 5. 6.\r\n\r\n[1562] Valerius Maximus, iii. 7. 6, assumes that the accused went into\r\nexile; Cicero, _Fam._ ix. 21. 3, informs us of a rumor that he committed\r\nsuicide. Both reports may be true; Greenidge, _Hist. of Rome_, i. 282;\r\ncf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 51.\r\n\r\n[1563] P. 358.\r\n\r\n[1564] Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 223 ff.\r\n\r\n[1565] (1) After the case against Carbo may be mentioned the accusation\r\nof perduellio against C. Popillius Laenas, 107, on the ground of a\r\ndisgraceful surrender to the Tigurini. It was on this occasion that the\r\nballot was first used in a trial for perduellio. The accused seems to\r\nhave been condemned to exile; Cic. _Leg._ iii. 16. 36; _Herenn._ i. 15.\r\n25; iv. 24. 34; Oros. v. 15. 24. This case, which resembles those of far\r\nearlier time, has nothing to do with violation of the right of appeal;\r\n(Cic.) _Herenn._ ibid.—(2) Similar in this respect was the prosecution\r\nof Q. Fabius Maximus Servilianus for the murder of his son. The accused\r\nwent into exile before judgment was pronounced; Oros. v. 16. 8; Val. Max.\r\nvi. 1. 5.—(3) More famous is the prosecution of Q. Caecilius Metellus\r\nNumidicus, 100, by L. Appuleius Saturninus because the former refused\r\nto swear to maintain the agrarian law of the latter. Technically the\r\ncharge was that Metellus refused to do his duty as a senator. The accused\r\nwithdrew into exile before the trial, whereupon, by vote of the assembly,\r\nhe was interdicted from fire and water; Livy, ep. lxix.; Appian, _B. C._\r\ni. 31. 137-40; Cic. _Dom._ 31. 82; _Sest._ 16. 37; 47. 101.—(4) Decianus,\r\ntribune of the plebs, 97, in accusing P. Furius, tribune of the preceding\r\nyear, let fall some complaint regarding the murder of Saturninus, and\r\non that ground was accused, probably by a tribune of the plebs, and\r\ncondemned to exile; Cic. _Rab. Perd._ 9. 24; Schol. Bob. 230.—(5) The\r\nprosecution of M. Aemilius Scaurus for maiestas by Q. Varius, tribune,\r\nDec. 91, was withdrawn in the second anquisitio; Ascon. 19, 21 f.;\r\n(Aurel. Vict.) _Vir. Ill._ 72. 11; Quintil. v. 12. 10; Cic. _Scaur._ 1,\r\n3; _Sest._ 47. 101.—(6) L. Cornelius Merula and Q. Lutatius Catulus, 87,\r\navoided trial, probably for perduellio, by suicide; Diod. xxxviii. 4;\r\nAppian, _B. C._ i. 74. 341 f.—(7) On the first day of the following year,\r\n86, P. Popillius Laenas, tribune of the plebs, hurled from the Tarpeian\r\nRock Sextus Lucilius (or Licinius?), tribune of the preceding year, and\r\nset a day of trial for the colleagues of the latter. The accused fled to\r\nSulla and in their absence were interdicted from fire and water. They\r\nwere charged with perduellio; their offence was the veto of the popular\r\nmeasures of Cornelius Cinna. This is the only certain case of calling\r\nretired tribunes to account for their official conduct, and may be\r\nregarded as a symptom of the revolution then in progress; Vell. ii. 24;\r\nLivy, ep. lxxx; Dio Cass. Frag. 102. 12; Plut. _Mar._ 45.\r\n\r\n[1566] P. 255, n. 1 (4).\r\n\r\n[1567] Cic. _Verr._ i. 13. 38; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 326.\r\n\r\n[1568] Dio Cass. lvi. 40. 4; Mommsen, _Röm.

Staatsr._ ii. 298, n. 3; 615, n. 2,\r\nfollowing Niebuhr, a tribunician accusation involving a fine was then\r\nintroduced, and the oration of Cicero was delivered in this second trial.\r\nDrumann-Gröbe, ibid.; Greenidge, _Leg. Proced._ 357 f.; Schneider,\r\n_Process des Rabirius_ (Zürich, 1899), and others maintain that Cicero\r\nspoke in the trial conducted by the duumviri and that after it was\r\ndropped no further accusation was brought. Wirz, ibid., supposes that the\r\nsenate quashed the process of the duumviri on the ground of illegality,\r\nthat the accuser (Labienus) then brought a tribunician accusation for\r\nperduellio, but intimated a possible finable action in addition, and that\r\nthe trial was ended, without resumption, by the hauling down of the flag.\r\n\r\n[1572] Cic. _Leg. Agr._ ii. 13. 33: “Orbis terrarum gentiumque omnium\r\ndatur cognitio sine consilio, poena sine provocatione, animadversio sine\r\nauxilio”; p. 435.\r\n\r\n[1573] Cic. _Har. Resp._ 4. 7.\r\n\r\n[1574] Anquisitio seems to mean an examination on both sides—including\r\ntestimony for and against the accused; Fest. ep. 22; Greenidge, _Leg.\r\nProced._ 345, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[1575] Varro, _L. L._ vi. 91 f.\r\n\r\n[1576] Cic. _Dom._ 17. 45: “Cum tam moderata iudicia populi sint a\r\nmaioribus constituta ... ne inprodicta die quis accusetur, ut ter ante\r\nmagistratus accuset intermissa die, quam multam inroget aut iudicet,\r\nquarta sit accusatio trinum nundinum prodicta die, quo die iudicium\r\nsit futurum, tum multa etiam ad placandum atque ad misericordiam reis\r\nconcessa sint, deinde exorabilis populus, facilis suffragatio pro salute,\r\ndenique etiam, si qua res ilium diem aut auspiciis aut excusatione\r\nsustulit, tota causa iudiciumque sublatum sit.”\r\n\r\n[1577] The trinum nundinum, which included three market days (Macrob.\r\n_Sat._ i. 16. 34), could not have contained less than seventeen days or\r\nmore than twenty-four.\r\n\r\n[1578] Livy, xliii. 16. 11.\r\n\r\n[1579] E.g. Greenidge, _Leg. Proced._ 306, 344. The theory has little in\r\nits favor and is not generally accepted; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Strafr._ 167\r\nf.\r\n\r\n[1580] On the quarta accusatio, see Cic. _Dom._ 17. 45, quoted p. 259, n.\r\n6. An example of the mitigation of a capital to a finable action is the\r\ncase against T. Menenius for the mismanagement of a campaign which he had\r\nconducted as consul; Livy ii. 52. 3-5 (476). Two examples of change in\r\nthe form of action in the opposite direction are given on p. 249 f.\r\n\r\n[1581] Cic. _Dom._ 17. 45, quoted p. 259, n. 6.\r\n\r\n[1582] Cf. the case of Appius Claudius Pulcher, p. 248.\r\n\r\n[1583] Livy ii. 33. 1; Calpurnius Piso, in ibid. § 3; 58. 1; Dion. Hal.\r\nvi. 89. 1; cf. Cic. _Rep._ ii. 33. 58; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 274\r\nf. with notes. Meyer, in _Rhein. Mus._ xxxvii (1882). 616 f., suggests\r\na doubt as to whether they were instituted at that time. Niese, _De\r\nannalibus Romanis observationes_ (1886), and Meyer, in _Hermes_, xxx\r\n(1895), 1-24, have tried to prove that they were not instituted till 471\r\nand that their original number was four. Niese’s view is controverted by\r\nJoh. Schmidt, in _Hermes_, xxi (1886). 464-6. Pais, _Anc. Italy_, 260,\r\n275, assumes that they came into existence as a result of the abolition\r\nof the decemvirate.\r\n\r\n[1584] Cic. Frag. A. vii. 48: “Tanta igitur in illis virtus fuit, ut anno\r\nXVI post reges exactos propter nimiam dominationem potentium secederent\r\n... duos tribunos crearent, ... Itaque auspicato postero anno tr. pl.\r\ncomitiis curiatis sunt”; Dion. Hal. vi. 89. 1; cf. ix. 41. 4 f. (included\r\nclients and patricians); Livy ii. 56, especially § 3, 10. These authors\r\nrepresent the tribunes as trying vainly to force the patricians from the\r\nassembly while the voting was under way. The question of excluding the\r\npatricians, however, is connected with the statute of Publilius Philo\r\n(339) rather than with the so-called plebiscite of Publilius Volero\r\n(471); p. 300 f.\r\n\r\nDion. Hal. vii. 59. 2, places the first tribal meeting in 491, twenty\r\nyears before the date to which its institution is otherwise assigned. If\r\nhis account is not an anticipation of later usage, it is exceptional.\r\n\r\n[1585] (1) Because there were no other magistrates at the time, (2)\r\nbecause the meeting was auspicated; p. 262, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1586] Inferred from the circumstance that this dignitary presided over\r\nthe assembly which elected the first college of tribunes after the fall\r\nof the decemvirs; Livy iii. 54. 5, 9, 11; p. 285 below.\r\n\r\n[1587] Livy iii. 13. 6; 56. 5; viii. 33. 7; ix. 26. 16; xxxviii. 52.\r\n8; Suet. _Caes._ 23. Naturally the plebeians were in most need of\r\nprotection; cf. Ihne, in _Rhein. Mus._ xxi (1866). 169.\r\n\r\n[1588] Livy ii. 33. 3: “Auxilii non poenae ius datum illi potestati”; cf.\r\nIhne, ibid. 170.\r\n\r\n[1589] Gell. iii. 2. 11; xiii. 12. 9; Macrob. _Sat._ i. 3. 8; Dion. Hal.\r\nviii. 87. 6; Serv. _in Aen._ v. 738; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii.\r\n291, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1590] Plut. _Q. R._ 81.\r\n\r\n[1591] In this respect the plebeian body was analogous to a corporation;\r\nGaius, in _Dig._ xlvii. 22. 4 (quoting a law of the Twelve Tables). But\r\nit was not a private association. It could neither limit its membership\r\nnor change its organization. Proof of these two facts is that the change\r\nof organization from curiate to tribal and the consequent exclusion of\r\nthe landless resulted from a centuriate law; p. 271. Notwithstanding the\r\nfact that its resolutions lacked the force of law, the close relation\r\nexisting between it and the state gave it from the beginning a prominent\r\nplace in the constitution.\r\n\r\n[1592] Livy ii. 56. 11-13 (The consul asserted that according to\r\nancestral usage he himself had no right to remove any one from the place\r\nof assembly); cf. 35. 3: “Plebis non patrum tribunos esse.”\r\n\r\n[1593] Livy ii. 35. 3: “Auxilii non poenae ius datum illi potestati”; 56.\r\n11-13.\r\n\r\n[1594] Cf. Livy ii. 35. 2; 52. 3 ff.; 54. 3 ff.; 61.\r\n\r\n[1595] Cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 320, n. 2; Ihne, in _Rhein. Mus._\r\nxxi (1866). 175 ff.; Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 157.\r\n\r\n[1596] Hence they had no viatores; so that for a time after they assumed\r\ncriminal jurisdiction the aediles acted as their bailiffs; p. 290.\r\n\r\n[1597] Livy iii. 55. 10: (In the opinion of some iuris interpretates)\r\n“Tribunos vetere iure iurando plebis, cum primum eam potestatem creavit,\r\nsacrosanctos esse.”\r\n\r\n[1598] Fest. 318; Livy iii. 55. 6-10; Dion. Hal. vi. 89. 3. The wording\r\nof the oath as given above is derived from the law which, according to\r\nLivy, was carried by the consuls Valerius and Horatius in 449; but there\r\ncan be no doubt that this statute confirmed the oath taken long before by\r\nthe plebs. As to the connection of Ceres with the plebeian organization,\r\nPais, _Anc. Italy_, 272 ff., believes that her temple was not built\r\nbefore the middle of the fifth century, whereas Wissowa, _Relig. u. Kult.\r\nd. Röm._ 45, holds to the traditional date (493); cf. De Sanctis, _Storia\r\nd. Romani_, ii. 30. The building of the temple did not necessarily\r\nprecede the institution of the tribunate. On the sacrosanctitas of the\r\naediles, see Cato, in Fest. 318. 8; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 472 f.\r\n\r\n[1599] As late as 131 a tribune of the plebs, C. Atinius Labeo, regarding\r\nthe censor Q. Caecilius Metellus as a homo sacer for alleged violation of\r\nthe tribunician sanctity, attempted without legal trial to hurl him from\r\nthe Tarpeian Rock; Livy, ep. lix; Pliny, _N. H._ vii. 44. 142 f., 146;\r\nCic. _Dom._ 47. 123. See also Vell. ii. 24. 2; (Aurel. Vict.) _Vir. Ill._\r\n66. 8.\r\n\r\n[1600] Cic. _Balb._ 14. 33; Fest. 318. 9; Herzog, _Röm.

The known leges sacratae, collected by Herzog,\r\nwere (1) the first Valerian law of appeal; Livy ii. 8. 2 (cf. ii. 1.\r\n9); (2) the act which rendered the persons of the tribunes sacred, and\r\nwhich, as intimated above, was not strictly a statute; Livy ii. 33. 1,\r\n3; Fest. 318. 30; Dion.

The fictitious character of the legal basis on which the plebeians\r\nare represented as acting in this early period of their history may be\r\nillustrated, as Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 299, n. 3, has pointed\r\nout, by their assumption of the agrarian proposal of Sp.

Although we may feel\r\nuncertain as to the author and the date of this plebiscite, we need not\r\ndoubt its existence, especially as the principle it contains is derived\r\nfrom leges sacratae by Cicero (_Sest._ 37. 79; cf. Pliny, _Ep._ i. 23),\r\nand was often put into practice; Livy iii. 11. 8; xxv. 3 f.; Dion. Hal.\r\nx. 41 f.; Cic. _Inv._ ii. 17. 52; Val. Max. ix. 5. 2; (Aurel. Vict.)\r\n_Vir. Ill._ 65; cf.

For the state, however, it had no\r\nmore validity than had the original lex sacrata, of which the so-called\r\nIcilian plebiscite was an expansion.\r\n\r\n[1608] Gell. xiii. 12. 9: “Tribuni, qui haberent summam coercendi\r\npotestatem.”\r\n\r\n[1609] Cf.

Cicero’s opinion (_Dom._ 32.\r\n86; cf. _Sest._ 30. 65) may be biassed by his personal feelings; p. 268,\r\nn. 6.\r\n\r\n[1616] Dion. Hal. x. 41 f. Various attempts of tribunes in this period to\r\npunish retired magistrates for abuse of office are also alleged by the\r\nancient writers; cf. p. 264.\r\n\r\n[1617] P. 265 f.\r\n\r\n[1618] Livy ii. 35. 3; cf. 56. 11 f.\r\n\r\n[1619] Livy iii. 55. 6.\r\n\r\n[1620] Livy ii. 54.\r\n\r\n[1621] Frag. 22. 1.\r\n\r\n[1622] P. 241; cf. also Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 157. A far\r\ndifferent view as to the form of assembly which received appeals in\r\ntribunician capital cases is represented by Cicero, in whose opinion the\r\ncomitia centuriata were established as the sole power to judge concerning\r\nthe caput of a citizen even in pre-decemviral time by the leges sacratae\r\n(_Sest._ 30. 65); and accordingly he believes that the sentence of exile\r\nwas passed on Kaeso Quinctius by that body (_Dom._ 32. 86). But in this\r\nopinion Cicero’s personal bias already referred to (p. 267, n. 6) cannot\r\nbe neglected: in discrediting the decree of exile passed against himself\r\nby the tribal comitia, it was agreeable to his purpose to deny that this\r\nassembly ever had enjoyed such competence. The view given in the text,\r\nrepresented by the annalists and confirmed by a law of the Twelve Tables,\r\nis obviously preferable.\r\n\r\n[1623] Cic. _Rep._ ii. 35. 60; Gell. xi. 1. 2 f.; Fest. 202. 11; 237.\r\n13; ep. 144; cf. p. 233 above. Dionysius, x. 50. 1 f., wrongly gives two\r\ncattle and thirty sheep as the maximum.\r\n\r\n[1624] X. 50. 1 f.\r\n\r\n[1625] With less probability Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 620; ii. 576 f.,\r\nregards it as a concession to the plebs to satisfy their craving for the\r\nlimitation of the consular power by written law.\r\n\r\n[1626] Livy ii. 43. 3; 44. 6; Dion.

Staatsr._ ii. 297.\r\n\r\n[1629] The veto of governmental acts, assigned them for the\r\npre-decemviral period by the historians (cf. Livy ii. 44), is therefore\r\nan anachronism. The very fact mentioned by Livy, in the chapter here\r\ncited, of the patrician attempt to win as many tribunes as possible\r\npoints to obstruction rather than to the veto as their weapon. The\r\nincrease in the number of tribunes from two to ten indicates the same\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[1630] Cf. Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 157.\r\n\r\n[1631] Cf.

Livy, ii. 58. 1, following Piso, supposes\r\nthat the number was now increased from two to five. Dio Cassius probably\r\nplaced the increase from five to ten at this date; Zon. vii. 15. 1; 17.\r\n6; Dio Cass. Frag. 22. 1. In the opinion of Meyer, in _Hermes_, xxx\r\n(1895). 1-24; _Gesch. d. Alt._ v. 141 f., the plebeian tribunate was\r\ninstituted at this time and the original number was four; cf. p. 55,\r\nn. 1 above. But Diodorus does not say so; indeed his grouping of the\r\nfour tribunes in pairs suggests a doubling—a fact which he has perhaps\r\ncondensed from his source.\r\n\r\n[1645] It has been shown above (119 ff., 126 ff.) that the assembly of\r\ntribes under tribunician presidency is rightly so designated.\r\n\r\n[1646] Livy ii. 61. 1; 63. 2; iii. 1. 2 f.; Dion.

On another occasion\r\nsome years earlier the patres old and young came into the Forum, and\r\ntaking their places in the several tribes, appealed to their tribesmen\r\nto vote against the proposal of the tribunes; Livy v. 30. 4 f. Still\r\nearlier C. Claudius and other senior patricians spoke in a tribunician\r\nassembly against the measure then before the plebs. Soltau’s objection\r\n(_Berl. Stud._ ii. 47) to the interpretation here represented has little\r\nweight, as it rests upon the theory that from the beginning everything\r\nwas carefully defined and regulated by law.\r\n\r\n[1676] P. 153, 156 f.\r\n\r\n[1677] P. 157, 211.\r\n\r\n[1678] P. 211.\r\n\r\n[1679] P. 271, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[1680] P. 300 f.\r\n\r\n[1681] Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 157, regarding the alleged\r\npre-decemviral plebiscites as genuine acts of the plebs, believes that\r\nthis conditioned validity of such acts was established at some unknown\r\ntime prior to the decemvirate. The view of Herzog that certain statutes\r\ntermed plebiscites in the sources were in reality centuriate laws is\r\naccepted in this chapter.\r\n\r\n[1682] P. 235.\r\n\r\n[1683] Livy iii. 55. 15; iv. 6. 3 (Canuleian plebiscite); 12. 8 (for the\r\nelection of a prefect of the market, 440); 49. 6 (“Temptatum ab L.

All the citations from\r\nDionysius, excepting the last, refer to pre-decemviral time, and hence\r\nare anticipations of a later condition.\r\n\r\nThe first triumph by order of the people, without the consent of the\r\nsenate, according to Livy iii. 63. 11 (cf. Dion. Hal. xi. 50. 1), took\r\nplace in 449. It is to be noticed, however, that a magistrate always had\r\na right to triumph without permission either of the senate or of the\r\npeople (Mommsen, _Röm. Forsch._ i. 214 f.), provided he paid his own\r\nexpenses; Polyb. vi. 15. 8; Livy xxxiii. 23. 8. The resolution of the\r\npeople on this occasion, if historical, may have been a mere pledge of\r\nsympathy and confidence; cf. p. 293. But Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i.\r\n194, doubts its reality.\r\n\r\nThe “ancient law long ago abolished,” which required the consent of the\r\nsenate to proposals brought before the people, and which Sulla is said\r\nto have renewed (Appian, _B. C._ i. 59. 266; cf. p. 406), is ordinarily\r\nreferred, as by Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 158; Herzog, _Röm.\r\nStaatsverf._ i. 193, to the condition on the validity of the plebiscite\r\nunder discussion. Appian may have had this restriction in mind, for\r\nwe know at least that under the constitution as reformed by Sulla the\r\ntribunes did propose laws de senatus sententia; _CIL._ i. 204 (year 71);\r\nBruns, _Font. Iur._ 94; Girard, _Textes_, 66; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii.\r\n154; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 158; Fröhlich, in Pauly-Wissowa,\r\n_Real-Encycl._ iv. 1559.\r\n\r\n[1684] Cf. Mommsen, _Röm.

Alt._ ii. 619; cf. i. 611, 614, 642) that\r\nthere was no statute which made the consent of the senate essential to\r\nthe validity of the plebiscite does not appear to be well considered. Had\r\nthe tribunes not been bound by written enactment, they would have felt\r\nthemselves free to legislate without the senate’s coöperation, and even\r\nthe law they tried in vain to disregard.\r\n\r\n[1686] Livy iii. 55. 13.\r\n\r\n[1687] Cf.

Hal. xi. 54. 3 (444).\r\n\r\n[1690] It is true that Livy (iv. 50. 6, 8; 56. 10-13, year 408; v. 9.\r\n4 ff., year 402; vi. 35. 9) assigns the tribune this right; but on one\r\noccasion (vii. 17. 12, year 356) he informs us that such a protest was\r\ndisregarded by the magistrate. We may suppose that in this period they\r\noften attempted the power, but usually without success. They possessed a\r\ngrowing influence in the right to address the people, which must often\r\nhave added an overwhelming force to their protests; cf. Livy iv. 25.\r\n1 (434); 58. 14 (406); v. 2. 2 ff. (403); ch. 6 (403). This kind of\r\nobstruction may be meant by Livy iv. 36. 3 (424); 43. 3 (421); v. 17. 5\r\n(397); vii. 21. 1 ff. (353). The government, on the other hand, continued\r\nto use the levy for the obstruction of tribunician bills; Livy iv. 55. 1\r\n(409); v. 11. 9 (401).\r\n\r\n[1691] The principal recorded seditions are (1) the revolt against the\r\ndecemvirate in 449 (Livy iii. 50 ff.); (2) a plebeian secession to the\r\nJaniculum in the struggle for the Canuleian law (Florus i. 25); (3) a\r\nstate of anarchy in 376 (Diod. xv. 61. 1), which, according to Matzat\r\n(_Röm.

Fourteen of the\r\ntwenty-nine tribes then existing had declared against him, when the\r\nprosecuting aedile by an unintentional expression turned the vote in\r\nhis favor.

Gesch._ 55, 148; Soltau, in _Hermes_, xxx (1895). 624-9;\r\nPais, _Stor. di Rom._ I. ii. 72 ff., 134 ff. Niese refuses to believe\r\nthat this agrarian legislation came so early, and prefers a date shortly\r\nafter the close of the war with Hannibal. Soltau, controverting Niese’s\r\nview, insists that the chief regulation mentioned by Livy—the limitation\r\nof occupation to five hundred iugera—belongs to Licinius and Sextius,\r\nand that the article was afterward renewed, with the addition of the\r\nother provisions stated by Appian, probably about the time of the\r\nHortensian legislation. Against the earlier date is especially urged the\r\ncircumstance that the large number of iugera allowed to the individual is\r\nincongruous with the narrow limits of the Roman territory at that time.\r\nThe provision for the relief of debtors, too, has the appearance of an\r\nanticipation of a plebiscite on the same subject passed in 447; p. 298\r\nbelow; cf.

Two laws of 356 have a certain degree of\r\nfinancial interest: the dictatorial law which made provision for an\r\nimpending war (Livy vii. 17. 7); and the alleged resolution of the people\r\n(p. 293) to grant the same dictator the privilege of a triumph.\r\n\r\n[1812] Tac. _Ann._ vi. 16; cf. Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 183, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[1813] Livy vii. 21, 5; cf. Herzog. _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 245. That\r\nthe bank commission owed its existence to a law is an inference\r\nfrom the circumstances. The form of assembly is unknown. With this\r\nValerian-Marcian law, 352, Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 621 f., conjecturally\r\nidentifies the lex Marcia against usurers; Gaius iv. 23. In his opinion\r\nalso (ibid. ii. 622; cf. Rudorff, _Röm. Rechtsgesch._ i. 51) the lex\r\nFuria de sponsu mentioned by Gaius, iii. 121; iv. 22, “discharging the\r\nsponsor and fide-promissor of liability in two years and limiting the\r\nliability of each to a proportionate part” (Poste’s interpretation)\r\nbelongs to L. Furius, dictator in 345 (Livy vii. 28. 2); whereas others\r\nassign it to the year 95 (cf. Poste, _Gai. Inst._ 359) and others to a\r\ntime subsequent to Cicero (cf. Roby, _Rom. Priv. Law_, ii. 30). It was\r\nlater than the lex Appuleia de sponsu, which is referred to by Gaius\r\niii. 122, and which must have been enacted after the establishment\r\nof the provincial system. It is to be attributed, accordingly, to\r\nthe famous tribune of 103, 100 (Poste, ibid. 359) rather than to the\r\nlike-named tribune of 390 (Livy v. 32. 8; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 621).\r\nThese considerations render the later dating of the lex Furia the more\r\nprobable. The lex Publilia de sponsu, the date of which is also unknown,\r\ngranted the surety (sponsor) an action against the principal debtor in\r\ncase the latter failed to reimburse him within six months; Gaius iii.\r\n127; iv. 22, cf. 171.\r\n\r\n[1814] Livy vii. 27. 3; Tac. _Ann._ vi. 16. The author is not named.\r\n\r\n[1815] P. 238.\r\n\r\n[1816] Livy vii. 42. 1-3. Appian, _B. C._ i. 54, testifies to the\r\nexistence of an ancient law forbidding interest; cf. Tac. _Ann._ vi. 16.\r\n\r\n[1817] Pais, _Stor. di Rom._ I. ii. 270, with his usual acumen has\r\nargued against the existence of the Genucian as well as of the Publilian\r\nstatute; but the reasons urged by this eminent scholar do not seem to me\r\nto be convincing. The period in which they fall is certainly within the\r\nreach of tradition. The abolition of debts through the Valerian law was\r\nin keeping with the populistic spirit of the masses in that age, as was\r\nthe prohibition of interest.\r\n\r\n[1818] Pais, _Stor. di Rom._ I. ii. 278, n. 4: “Thus C. Junius Bubulcus\r\nand Aemilius Barbula, consuls in 317, reappear in 311 B.C.; L. Papirius\r\nCursor is consul in 320, 319, 315, 313; P. Decius is consul in 312 and\r\nin 308,” etc.; cf. further Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 519, n. 5. It is\r\ntrue that on one occasion Livy, x. 13. 8 f. (298), speaks of the law and\r\nof a proposal of the tribunes to obtain a dispensation for the candidate\r\nFabius by a vote of the people, oblivious of the violation of the law by\r\nthis same Fabius as well as by many others.\r\n\r\n[1819] Livy xxiii. 31. 13 f.; Plut. _Marc._ 12 (215). On that occasion\r\nwhen the people were told that the election of two plebeians as\r\ncolleagues in the consulship was displeasing to the gods, they proceeded\r\nto choose a patrician in place of the second plebeian; cf. Herzog, _Röm.\r\nStaatsverf._ i. 253, n. 2. The first definitive election of two plebeians\r\nwas in 172; _Fast. Cos. Capit._, in _CIL._ i². p. 25: “Ambo primi de\r\nplebe.”\r\n\r\n[1820] Cf. Herzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 253.\r\n\r\n[1821] Livy viii. 12. 14-16.\r\n\r\n[1822] P. 235.\r\n\r\n[1823] P. 237.\r\n\r\n[1824] P. 307.\r\n\r\n[1825] P. 274, 313.\r\n\r\n[1826] The most detailed study of this subject, including a critique\r\nof the principal modern views, is made by Soltau, _Gültigkeit der\r\nPlebiscite_, in _Berl. Stud._ ii (1885). 1-176. His criticism is more\r\nsatisfactory than his construction.\r\n\r\n[1827] This point is established by the circumstances (1) that no writer\r\nof the period refers to the principle mentioned; (2) that Cicero regards\r\nthe thirty-five tribes under tribunician presidency as the universus\r\npopulus Romanus—a definition which is incompatible with the legal\r\nexclusion of the patricians from that form of assembly (p. 129 f.); (3)\r\nthat on one occasion, 209, after the Hortensian legislation Livy (xxvii.\r\n21. 1-4) represents the voting assembly under tribunician presidency as\r\ncomposed not only of plebs but of all ranks (concursu plebisque et omnium\r\nordinum), and that the patricians were evidently free to take part in the\r\ndebates of the concilium; cf. Livy xliii. 16. 8; (4) Caesar, _B. C._ iii.\r\n1, seems to represent the praetors and tribunes as presiding together\r\nover the same comitia (“praetoribus tribunisque plebis rogationes ad\r\npopulum ferentibus”)—which would prove that no difference of composition\r\nexisted between the pretorian and the tribunician assemblies of tribes.\r\n\r\n[1828] P. 230.\r\n\r\n[1829] Livy ix. 5. 2.\r\n\r\n[1830] _Inv._ ii. 30. 92.\r\n\r\n[1831] Livy ix. 8. 14: the tribunes protested against breaking it.\r\n\r\n[1832] Livy ix. 10. 10: the circumstance that he assaulted the Roman\r\nfetialis is sufficient evidence of his view.\r\n\r\n[1833] IX. 9. 4. Gellius, xvii. 21. 36, less credibly states that the\r\ntreaty was repudiated by order of the people.\r\n\r\n[1834] Livy ix. 5-11; Cic. _Off._ iii. 30. 109; _Inv._ ii. 30. 92; Zon.\r\nvii. 26. 15.\r\n\r\n[1835] Livy ix. 9. 4.\r\n\r\n[1836] Livy viii. 36. 11 f. (ambassadors of the Samnites, applying for\r\npeace to the dictator, are ordered by him to address the senate, which\r\nreplies that it will accept the arrangements of the magistrate, 324); ix.\r\n20. 8 (an unequal alliance with Apulia negotiated by the consul, 317);\r\nix. 43. 6 f. (the Hernicans, beaten in war, apply to the senate, and are\r\nreferred to the consuls, who accept their submission, 307); ix. 45. 1-3\r\n(Samnite ambassadors ask peace of the senate, which replies that the\r\nconsul will pass through their country and will report to the senate on\r\nthe conditions which he finds there, 304); x. 3. 5 (the dictator, fining\r\nthe Marsians of a part of their territory, grants them a renewal of the\r\ntreaty, 302). In none of these instances is mention made of the people;\r\nand most of them preclude a popular vote.\r\n\r\n[1837] Sall. _Iug._ 39.\r\n\r\n[1838] Cf. Livy ix. 20. 2 f. (318), in which a proposal of peace was\r\nrejected by the people. In the treaty with the Lucanians, 298, Livy, x.\r\n11. 13; 12. 1, mentions the senate only; Dionysius, xvii, xviii (xvi.\r\n12). 1. 3, speaks of both senate and assembly.\r\n\r\n[1839] Cf. Livy ix. 20. 2 f.\r\n\r\n[1840] Polyb. vi. 14. 10 f.; 15. 9.\r\n\r\n[1841] P. 181.\r\n\r\n[1842] _Röm.

Mamilius,\r\ndictator of Tusculum, 458, does not necessarily imply a public vote; Livy\r\niii. 29. 6. Even if this were the opinion of Livy, it need be no more\r\nthan an anticipation of later usage. In 381 the Tusculans received the\r\ncitizenship, how we are not informed; Livy vi. 26. 8; Dio Cass. Frag.\r\n28. 2. In the account of the settlement of Latium and Campania in 340,\r\ninvolving the grant of citizenship to the Capuan equites, no mention\r\nis made of either senate or people; Livy viii. 11. 13-16. The sources\r\nare likewise silent as to a popular vote in the grant of citizenship\r\nsine suffragio to the Caerites; Livy vii. 20. 8; Dio Cass. Frag. 33\r\n(Boissevain i. p. 138); Strabo v. 2. 3, p. 220; Gell. xvi. 13. 7. From\r\nLivy and Dio Cassius it may be reasonably inferred that the event took\r\nplace after 353, though Boissevain’s date, 273, seems to be too late.\r\nProbably they were admitted between 353 and 332—before the hundred years’\r\npeace had far advanced.\r\n\r\n[1845] Livy viii. 17. 12.\r\n\r\n[1846] _Röm.

That a duovir\r\ncommanded a fleet in 282 is proved by Livy, ep. xii; Dio Cass. Frag. 39.\r\n4.

In 415 a bill for colonizing Bolae, introduced by a tribune of the\r\nplebs, was vetoed by a colleague; Livy iv. 49. 6; cf.

Hortensius\r\ndictator legem tulit, ut eo iure, quod plebs statuisset, omnes quirites\r\ntenerentur”; Pomponius, in _Dig._ i. 2. 2. 8: “Quia multae discordiae\r\nnascebantur de his plebis scitis, pro legibus placuit et ea observari\r\nlege Hortensia: et ita factum est, ut inter plebis scita et legem species\r\nconstituendi interesset, potestas eadem esset.”\r\n\r\n[1918] P. 235, 372.\r\n\r\n[1919] This fact is clearly expressed by Gaius; see p. 313, n. 2 above.\r\n\r\n[1920] Before acquiring this right they had been accustomed to sit\r\non their bench at the door of the curia, in order to watch the\r\nproceedings within.

Forsch._ ii. 464 f.\r\n\r\n[1947] In the story of the trial given by Antias the two Petilii were the\r\nprosecutors of Publius (Livy xxxviii. 50 f.). In ch. 54 f. Livy, again\r\nfollowing Antias, represents these tribunes as authors of a plebiscite\r\nfor the appointment of a special court to inquire concerning the money\r\nreceived from King Antiochus, and states that L. Scipio was condemned\r\nby this court. The story may not be without foundation; but if such a\r\nplebiscite was adopted, it could not have had the desired result.\r\n\r\n[1948] This incident is considered doubtful by Bloch, in _Rev. d. étud.\r\nanc._ viii. (1906). 109.\r\n\r\n[1949] According to Diod. xxix. 21, Scipio was threatened with the death\r\npenalty; but the trial actually took the form described above in the text.\r\n\r\n[1950] Gell. vi. 19. 2. It was probably in connection with this trial\r\nthat Cato delivered his speech “Concerning the money of King Antiochus”;\r\nLivy xxxviii. 54. 11; Plut. _Cat. Mai._ 15; Cato, _Orat._ xv.\r\n\r\n[1951] The edicts of these conflicting tribunes are given by Gell.\r\nvi. 19. 5, 7; cf. Livy xxxviii. 56. 10; Cic. _Prov. Cons._ 8. 18. The\r\ndissenting edict states that the fine was imposed nullo exemplo, yet it\r\nwas within the competence of the tribune; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii.\r\n322, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1952] The account here given closely follows Mommsen, _Röm. Forsch._ ii.\r\n417-510. For other authorities on the trial, see p. 329.\r\n\r\n[1953] Plut. _Cat.

Afterward this man as tribune of the plebs brought\r\nagainst him an accusation for malversation in his censorship; Gell.\r\niii. 4. 1; cf. ii. 20. 6. It was a finable case (ibid. vi. 11. 9), in\r\nwhich was charged against him a lustrum malum infelixque; Lucilius, in\r\nGell. iv. 17. 1; cf. Cic. _Orat._ ii. 64. 258; 66. 268.

In 87 a\r\nday was set for the trial of L. Cornelius Sulla himself by the tribune\r\nM. Vergilius. The accused, taking no notice of the prosecution, departed\r\nfor the East; Cic. _Brut._ 48. 179; Plut. _Sull._ 10; cf. Fröhlich, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1537. In the same year Appius Claudius\r\nPulcher, summoned to trial by a tribune of the plebs, retired into exile,\r\nwhereupon his propretorian imperium was abrogated; Cic. _Dom._ 31. 83;\r\nMünzer, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iii. 2489; Greenidge, _Leg.\r\nProced._ 352. In 84 Cn.

The statement of\r\nGellius v. 19. 10, that women had nothing to do with comitia (“Feminis\r\nnulla comitiorum communio est”), does not refer to their lack of\r\nsuffrage, as Lange assumes, for Gellius is explaining why women could not\r\nbe arrogated. Originally they had no right to be present in contiones or\r\ncomitia; but in time the principle was modified to a limited extent; p.\r\n147. It was not necessary, however, that the accused should be present in\r\nperson during the trial; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 496.\r\n\r\n[1986] Plut. _Q. R._ 6; Lange, _Röm.

Cicero informs us that the law under\r\nconsideration was passed after the tribunate of M’. Curius, which must\r\nhave preceded his consulship (290). The enactment should preferably\r\nbe placed after that of Hortensius, when the patres were no longer in\r\na position to oppose it; cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ i. 409; ii. 216, 654;\r\nHerzog, _Röm.

Such a departure in favor of the people was hardly\r\npossible in the period of comitial stagnation preceding the tribunate\r\nof Flaminius, 232; and the law must have been passed, or at least\r\namended, after the institution of the last two tribes; for it specified\r\ndefinitely seventeen tribes; Cic. _Leg.

Pais, _L’elezione del pontefice\r\nmassimo_, etc. (1908), maintains on the contrary that the plebiscite in\r\nquestion was passed about 254, and that it resorted to seventeen tribes\r\nas the legal half of the total number (33) then existing.

Two other dispensations from\r\nlaws by act of the people are recorded for the latter part of this\r\ncentury: (1) the plebiscite of 203, which exempted C. Servilius from\r\nthe law prohibiting the election of a man to the plebeian tribunate or\r\naedileship in the lifetime of a father who had filled a curule office\r\n(Livy xxx. 19. 9); (2) a plebiscite of 200 for permitting L. Valerius\r\nFlaccus to take the oath of office for the aedileship as a proxy for his\r\nbrother, who being flamen Dialis was forbidden to swear; Livy xxxi. 50.\r\n7-9.\r\n\r\n[2102] Cf. Herzog, _Röm.

Polybius speaks of the decisions of the senate; but\r\nsince that body as a whole was not a court, and since there was no appeal\r\nfrom either the special or the standing quaestiones, he must be thinking\r\nhere of the consilia of the magistrates, which also were composed of\r\nsenators.\r\n\r\n[2119] VI. 16. 3.

A rogation of similar import was offered by\r\na certain M.

On the other hand Cicero’s description\r\n(_Dom._ 20. 51; _Leg. Agr._ ii. 8. 21) of these laws as veteres should\r\nplace them a hundred years or more before his time.

The only other instance of popular\r\nlegislation in this period touching state economy was the plebiscite of\r\nM. Lucretius, 172 (Livy xlii. 19. 1 f.; cf. xxvii. 11. 8; Gran. Licin.\r\nxxviii), for renewing the tribunician law of 210, which directed the\r\ncensors to farm the vectigalia of Campania; p. 337 above.—In 169 a\r\ntribunician rogation of P. Rutilius threatened to annul the censorial\r\ncontracts (Livy xliii. 16. 6) as a rebuke to the censors for their\r\narbitrary management of the business. When this object was secured, the\r\nbill was allowed to drop. It is true, as Ihne, _Hist. of Rome_, iv. 24,\r\nn. 1, remarks, that no one questioned the right of the people to cancel\r\nan administrative act of the censors; but it was quite another thing\r\nto find a college of tribunes unanimously disposed to interfere. The\r\nsignificant fact is that in all the time between the peace with Hannibal\r\nand the tribunate of Ti.

There were certain cases of restoration of citizenship,\r\nhowever, which were thought to require a comitial vote; Cic. _Balb._ 11.\r\n28. But on this question opinions differed; cf. Mommsen, _Röm.

It is understood,\r\nhowever, that certain parts were inserted after the beginning of the\r\nrevolutionary period.\r\n\r\n[2239] It is true that the Gracchan trouble opened his eyes to some of\r\nthe defects in the constitution; but the aristocratic recovery after the\r\ntribunate of Tiberius (and perhaps after that of Gaius) confirmed his\r\nbelief in the fundamental soundness and in the recuperative power of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n[2240] P. 360 f.\r\n\r\n[2241] Livy xxxv. 10. 12: “Multos pecuarios damnarunt.” In Livy xxxiv.\r\n4. 9 Cato while speaking in defence of the Oppian law, in 195, is\r\nrepresented as mentioning the article which established the limit of five\r\nhundred iugera.\r\n\r\n[2242] _Orig._ v. 5.\r\n\r\n[2243] These are provisions of an agrarian law passed before the\r\ntribunate of Ti. Gracchus (App. _B. C._ i. 8. 33 f.) but not expressly\r\nreferred to Licinius and Sextius in any ancient source. The first article\r\nseems to assume a greater development of slavery than could be true of\r\nthe year 367, and the second would belong more naturally to a repetition\r\nthan to the original enactment; p. 296, n. 4, 334, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[2244] Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 9.\r\n\r\n[2245] App. _B. C._ i. 9. 37 and 11. 46 states that an additional two\r\nhundred and fifty iugera were allowed for each son, and Livy, ep. lviii,\r\nsets the maximum at a thousand iugera. Combining the two sources, we\r\nreach the probable result given in the text; cf. also (Aurel. Vict.)\r\n_Vir. Ill._ 64. 3; Siculus Flacc. p. 136. 10 (CC is a corruption of ↀ).\r\nSee Herzog, _Röm.

It is not stated that these lots should\r\nbecome private property. Appian mentions this article as the only\r\ncompensation for improvements on the lands surrendered. The fact that\r\narticle 2 was withdrawn from the bill before it became a law may account\r\nfor its omission from this source.\r\n\r\n[2248] Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 9; App. _B. C._ i. 11.\r\n\r\n[2249] _CIL._ i. 200. 14: “_Sei quis_ ... agri iugra non amplius xxx\r\npossidebit habebitve.” In all probability this specification came\r\noriginally from the Sempronian law.\r\n\r\n[2250] Mommsen, in _CIL._ i. p. 88; Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 9; App. _B. C._\r\ni. 27. 121; Weber, _Röm. Agrargesch._ 151.\r\n\r\n[2251] This is a necessary deduction from a speech of Tiberius quoted by\r\nApp. _B. C._ i. 9. 35; cf. 11. 43; Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 9. The _Lex Agr._\r\nof 111 (_CIL._ i. 200. 21) refers to assignments made by C. Gracchus to\r\nLatins and allies as compensation for public lands surrendered by them\r\nto the government for colonial purposes; cf. § 31. Doubtless a similar\r\nprovision was included in the statute of Tiberius. Although viritim\r\nassignments had hitherto benefited citizens only, Latins and Italians\r\nhad been admitted to Latin colonies founded by Rome; Meyer, _Gesch. d.\r\nGracch._ 91.\r\n\r\n[2252] Cf. _Lex Agr._ in _CIL._ i. 200. 6: “_Extra eum agrum, qui ager\r\nex_ lege plebive scito, quod C. Sempronius Ti. f. tr(ibunus) pl(ebei)\r\nrog(avit), exceptum cavitumque est nei divideretur.” The exceptions\r\nnumbered from a to g in the text above are taken from the agrarian law of\r\n111. As these exceptions were made in the agrarian law of C. Gracchus, it\r\nis here assumed that they were made previously by Tiberius.\r\n\r\n[2253] _Lex Agr._ in _CIL._ i. 200. 31 f.; cf. Cic. _Leg.

But if tribunus, the equivalent of δήμαρχος,\r\nstood in the law, it must have signified tribune, not candidate; and in\r\nthat case παραγγελίαις, however Appian may have understood it, must be\r\nthe equivalent of renuntiationibus, “announcements of votes.”\r\n\r\n[2284] Cf.

The measure is referred to as a lex iudiciaria by Macrob.\r\n_Sat._ iii. 14. 6.\r\n\r\n[2316] The epitomator of Livy, lx, supposes that Gaius offered and\r\nactually carried a measure for adding six hundred knights to the senate\r\nwith the understanding that the jurors were to be drawn from that body\r\nthus enlarged; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 530, n. 1. Such an act,\r\nhowever, could not have been termed a lex iudiciaria, as it would have\r\nbeen concerned simply with the composition of the senate. Everything\r\nis opposed to the assumption that the bill in this form passed or at\r\nleast that it was put into effect. Plutarch, _C. Gracch._ 5 f., seems\r\nto signify that his law provided for an album of six hundred jurors,\r\none half to be drawn from the senate, the rest from the knights. It is\r\nby no means necessary, with Fowler, in _Eng. Hist. Rev._ xx (1905).\r\n426, n. 16, to interpret the expression ὁ δὲ τριακοσίους τῶν ἱππέων\r\nπροσκατέλεξεν αὐτοῖς οὖσι τριακοσίοις, καὶ τὰς κρίσεις κοινὰς τῶν\r\nἑξακοσίωον ἐποίησε (cf. _Ag. et Cleom. et Gracch._ _Comp._ 2) as “adding\r\nthree hundred equites to the senate to form the body of iudices.” These\r\nsources have confused the projects with the law as actually passed; cf.\r\nStrachan-Davidson, _Appian_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[2317] App. _B.

Bob.\r\n311; Greenidge, _Leg. Proced._ 381 f., 435.\r\n\r\n[2319] _CIL._ i. 198.\r\n\r\n[2320] _CIL._ i. 198. 16. There was under the republic a census\r\nqualification for the knights who acted as iudices (Cic. _Phil._ i. 8.\r\n20), though we have no authority that the limit of four hundred thousand\r\nsesterces existed before the principate. Originally Mommsen supplied the\r\nlacuna with a statement of the money qualification as here given; but\r\nafterward, changing his mind, he filled the gap with “equum publicum\r\nhabebit habuerit.”\r\n\r\n[2321] An article of the lex Acilia provides that within ten days after\r\nthe enactment of this statute the said praetor shall choose the four\r\nhundred and fifty persons from whom the jurors of that court are to be\r\ndrawn; thereafter the revision is to be annual; _CIL._ i. 198. 12, 14.\r\n\r\n[2322] Strachan-Davidson, _Appian_, p. 23, followed by Fowler, in _Eng.\r\nHist. Rev._ xx. 429, identifies the two—on untenable ground, for the\r\nreliable sources speak distinctly of a Sempronian law and an Acilian law.\r\n\r\n[2323] Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 531, n. 1, preferably regards the\r\nSempronian as the later; but in that case the transfer would have been\r\nachieved in substance by the Acilian statute—a view which is contradicted\r\nby the sources.\r\n\r\n[2324] This idea would explain the fact that the extant fragments of the\r\nlex Acilia contain no reference to a Sempronian lex iudiciaria.\r\n\r\n[2325] Cic. _Verr._ i. 17. 51 f.; II. i. 9. 26; _Brut_. 68. 239; Pseud.\r\nAscon. 149, 165.\r\n\r\n[2326] P. 370.\r\n\r\n[2327] _CIL._ i. 198. Reference to the IIIviri of the Sempronian agrarian\r\nlaw (§ 13, 16, 22) proves it to belong to 133-119, while the fact that\r\nit does not admit senators among the jurors requires it to follow the\r\njudiciary law of C. Gracchus; and more particularly, the implication that\r\nat the time of its enactment the lex Rubria (p. 383 below) was in force\r\nplaces it between 123 and 121; Mommsen, in _CIL._ i. p. 55; Ruggiero,\r\n_Diz. Ep._ i. 41. In general on the law, see Rudorff, _Ad legem Aciliam_;\r\nZumpt, in _Abhdl. d. Akad. zu Berlin_, 1845. 1-70, 475-515; _Röm.\r\nCriminalr._ i. 99 ff.; Huschke, in _Zeitschr. f.

Max. iii. 7. 9), and probably in every law for the\r\nestablishment of a court. It was used throughout the history of the\r\nrepublic; cf. Livy x. 37. 7; 46. 16 (year 293); p. 289 above; Suet.\r\n_Caes._ 23 (59); Dio Cass. xxxix. 7. 3 (57).\r\n\r\nIn this connection mention may be made of the lex Hostilia, which allowed\r\nactions for theft to be brought in behalf of persons absent in the\r\nservice of the state or in captivity or in wardship; Just. _Inst._ iv.\r\n10. The date is unknown, though Voigt, _Röm. Rechtsgesch._ i. 282, n. 14,\r\ninclines to assign it to 209 or 207.\r\n\r\n[2333] _Lex Rep._ 19-26; Mommsen, _Röm. Strafr._ 216 f. Ruggiero, ibid.\r\n43, is obviously wrong.\r\n\r\n[2334] _Lex Rep._ 76-8; cf. 83-5.\r\n\r\n[2335] § 28 states that money within a specified limit might legally be\r\nreceived—perhaps by the patron of the accuser—from which we may infer\r\nthat the law defined precisely what was permitted and what forbidden all\r\npersons participating in the trial; cf. Brassloff, in _Wiener Studien_,\r\nxxvi. 109 f.\r\n\r\n[2336] Cic. _Cluent._ 56. 154: “Illi (senatus) non hoc recusabant, ne ea\r\nlege accusarentur, qua nunc Habitus accusatur, quae tum erat Sempronia,\r\nnunc est Cornelia” (“They did not object to being accused under that law\r\nunder which Habitus is now being tried, which was then the Sempronian\r\nbut is now the Cornelian statute”). The trial was before the quaestio\r\nveneficis under the Cornelian law which constituted this court and which\r\nis described as essentially identical with a Sempronian law. _CIL._ i. p.\r\n200. xxxiii: (“C. Claud. Ap. F. C. N. Pulcher) ... IUDEX. Q. VENEFICIS,”\r\naedile 99, praetor 95, consul 92, corroborates the existence of such a\r\ncourt before Sulla. For other proofs, see Lengle, _Sull. Verf._ 36 ff.;\r\ncf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 664.\r\n\r\n[2337] P. 255, n. 1 (4), 358.\r\n\r\n[2338] Cic. _Cluent._ 55. 151.\r\n\r\n[2339] Ibid. 52. 144.\r\n\r\n[2340] In 66 Cluentius Habitus was brought to trial before the quaestio\r\ninter sicarios et veneficos on the charge (1) of having corrupted the\r\njurors in an earlier trial of the kind, (2) of poisoning; Cic. _Cluent._;\r\ncf. Münzer, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 12.\r\n\r\n[2341] The whole tenor of Cicero’s _Pro Cluentio_ is to the effect\r\nthat the knights were not bound by the provision against bribery. He\r\nhad a strong motive, however, for bringing into prominence the article\r\nwhich provided for the punishment of magistrates and senators, and for\r\nsuppressing the one, if there was one, concerning the punishment of\r\nequites; and this suppression was rendered easy by the fact that the\r\nCornelian law then in force mentioned senatorial jurors only. Appian, _B.\r\nC._ i. 22. 97 (cf. 35. 158, 161), assumes that under the Sempronian law\r\nthere were trials for the bribery of jurors, rendered useless, however,\r\nand finally done away with by the conspiracy and violence of the knights;\r\ncf. Lengle, _Sull. Verf._ 18 f. This interpretation of the known facts\r\nseems preferable to the view of Cicero, which, however, is accepted by\r\nmost scholars; cf. Mommsen, _Röm.

The same principle holds for any other colonies\r\nfounded in Italy between 133 and 111.\r\n\r\n[2363] _Lex Acil._, in _CIL._ i. 198. 22; _Lex Agr._, _CIL._ i. 200. 59;\r\nVell. i. 15. 4; ii. 7. 8; Plut. _C.

About the end of 123 or the beginning of 122 Gaius had\r\nproposed to give the Latins equal suffrage with the Romans; Plut. ibid. 8\r\nf.: Kornemann, _Gesch. d. Gracch._ 45. The promulgation of this earlier\r\nrogation must have preceded that of the Livian bills.\r\n\r\nThe bill (or possibly bills) which included the Italians among the\r\nrecipients of the citizenship could have been offered only between his\r\nreturn from Carthage and the elections of midsummer, 122; Kornemann,\r\nibid. 51; Fowler, in _Eng. Hist. Rev._ xx. 425.\r\n\r\n[2365] Cf. Fannius, in Jul. Victor vi. 6. p. 224 Or.; Charisius, p. 143\r\nKeil.\r\n\r\n[2366] Appian, _B. C._ i. 23. 101; Plut. C. _Gracch._ 9. Plutarch, who\r\nalone speaks of the exemption from rent, seems to consider the measure\r\nto have applied retroactively to the Sempronian settlements as well\r\nas to those proposed by Livius. Although this could hardly have been\r\nthe intention of the Livian act, the exemption of the colonists under\r\nit would naturally lead to the extension of equal privileges to the\r\nbeneficiaries of the Sempronian agrarian laws.\r\n\r\n[2367] Appian, _B. C._ i. 35. 156 (cf. p. 397 below) assumes that the\r\ncolonial bill of Livius became a law. If that is true, there is no reason\r\nfor supposing that the other was dropped before being brought to vote.\r\nGaius might have prevented both by his veto (Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 45);\r\nbut even if he felt the intention to be mischievous, he could not have\r\nafforded to oppose so popular measures. Mommsen, in _CIL._ i. p. 87, is\r\nof the opinion that Minervia may have been a Livian colony; but he cannot\r\nunderstand why the others provided for were not founded. The reason\r\ndoubtless is that the senate, which had used Livius as a tool, never\r\nseriously intended to execute the law.\r\n\r\n[2368] A rogation of Gaius, proposed about the same time as the lex de\r\ncivitate danda, concerning the order of voting in the comitia centuriata\r\nis mentioned by (Sall.) _Rep. Ord._ ii. 8: “Mihi ... placet lex quam C.\r\nGracchus in tribunatu promulgaverit, ut ex confusis quinque classibus\r\nsorte centuriae vocarentur: ita coaequatur dignitate pecunia.” His\r\nobject, to eliminate the influence of wealth, could be achieved by\r\ndetermining by lot the order of voting of the five classes; or a new\r\ngrouping of the centuries could be substituted for the classes; but he\r\ncould not have proposed that the centuries should vote one by one.\r\n\r\n[2369] We know that in 91 they vehemently opposed the admission of the\r\nallies; p. 399, 400 below; cf. Meyer, _Gesch. d. Gracch._ 106, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[2370] Opimius, consul in 121, ordered the equites to come each with two\r\narmed slaves to the support of the government; Plut. _C. Gracch._ 14.\r\nSallust, _Iug._ 42, states that the senate, by holding out to the equites\r\nthe hope of an alliance with the aristocracy, detached them from the\r\nplebs; cf. Meyer, ibid. 106.\r\n\r\nThe lex Acilia Rubria, passed most probably in 122, seems to have\r\nhad to do with the participation of aliens in the worship of Jupiter\r\nCapitolinus; _S. C. de Astypalaeensibus_, in _CIG._ ii. 2485. 11 (cf.\r\nBöckh’s comment); Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 42. It is to be connected with\r\nthe rogation for granting the citizenship to the allies, and probably\r\naimed to liberalize the worship in the Sempronian spirit.\r\n\r\n[2371] Cf. Greenidge, _Hist. of Rome_, i. 231.\r\n\r\n[2372] Dio Cassius, Frag. 85. 3, in a mutilated passage seems to refer to\r\nthe great possibilities of a longer career. It would be unreasonable to\r\nsuppose that so creative a mind could rest content at any given point.\r\n\r\n[2373] Fest. 201. 19; Flor. ii. 3. 4 (iii. 15); Diod. xxxiv. 28 a (from\r\nPosidonius); (Aurel.

Thorius .... qui agrum publicum vitiosa et inutili lege\r\nvectigali levavit”). By interpreting this sentence “Sp. Thorius ... who\r\nrelieved the public land of a defective and useless law by the imposition\r\nof a vectigal,” Mommsen (in _Verhdl. sächs. Gesellsch. d. Wiss._ 92\r\nf.) attempts to bring Cicero into agreement with Appian. But the\r\ninterpretation is violent and is not generally accepted. The statement\r\nof Cicero applies to the law of 111 far better than to that which Appian\r\nmentions under the name of Borius.\r\n\r\n[2377] App. ibid.; Lange, _Röm.

If, as Greenidge supposes, the Livian colonial rogation became a\r\nlaw, it did not affect the vectigal imposed by the Sempronian statutes\r\n(p. 383 above).\r\n\r\nIt may have been as a compensation for the repeal of this Sempronian\r\nstatute and of that of Rubrius that a lex of an unknown author provided\r\nin this year for the establishment of the colony of Narbo Martius in\r\nNarbonensis; Vell. i. 15. 5; ii. 7. 8; Eutrop. iv. 23; Cic. _Brut._ 43.\r\n160; _Cluent._ 51. 140; _Font._ 5. 13; Kornemann, in Pauly-Wissowa,\r\n_Real-Encycl._ iv. 522.\r\n\r\n[2378] _Brut._ 36. 136 (quoted p. 385, n. 5 above); cf. _Orat._ ii. 70.\r\n284; App. _B.

The circumstance that the trial of Norbanus took place no\r\nless than five years after the enactment of the law and the general tenor\r\nof Cicero’s account of that trial (see n. 4 above) point clearly to the\r\nexistence of a standing court; cf.

It is almost certain that the\r\npunishment mentioned was prescribed by this law; Hitzig, ibid.\r\n\r\n[2494] This conclusion is deduced from the circumstance that Varius was\r\ntried under his own law. The charge could not possibly have been that\r\nof favoring the Italians, but must rather have been the instigation of\r\nthe sedition by which his statute was originally carried; Lengle, _Sull.\r\nVerf._ 35.\r\n\r\n[2495] Cic. _Brut._ 89. 304: “Exercebatur una lege iudicium Varia,\r\nceteris propter bellum intermissis.”\r\n\r\n[2496] This is an inference from the fact that the court which tried Cn.\r\nPompeius Strabo in 88, and which sat under the Varian law, was composed\r\nin accordance with the subsequent Plautian judiciary law (Cic. Frag. A.\r\nvii. _Cornel._ i. 53). A special court was composed in no other way than\r\nby the law which established it. In general on the Varian law, see Ascon.\r\n21 f., 73, 79; Val.

From Appian we learn that the law was passed before the outbreak\r\nof the Social War, and Cicero, _Brut._ 89. 305, informs us that the\r\nprosecutions under it continued through the war.

Plutarch, _Sull._ 8, states that Pompeius, not Sulla, was\r\ndeprived of the consulship and that from Sulla was taken merely the\r\nprovincial command. Appian, _B. C._ i. 56. 249 (cf. Plut. _Mar._ 35;\r\nSchol. Gronov. 410) speaks only of the transfer of the command. That\r\nthe fourth article was added after the departure of Sulla from Rome,\r\nand that the latter knew nothing of it till summoned to deliver up his\r\ncommand is clearly stated by Appian, ibid. ch. 56 f.; cf. Fröhlich, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1533 f.\r\n\r\n[2521] Plutarch, _Sull._ 8 and Livy, ep. lxxvii, speak of a decree of the\r\nsenate only, whereas the account of Appian, _B. C._ i. 60. 271 (Πολεμίους\r\nῬωμαίων ἐψήφιστο εἶναι) implies a vote of the assembly. Velleius, ii. 19.\r\n1 (“Lege lata exules fecit”) distinctly mentions a comitial act, though\r\nhe is wrong in supposing it to be a sentence of exile, as may be gathered\r\nfrom his context; cf. Ihne, _Hist. of Rome_, v. 237.\r\n\r\n[2522] App. _B. C._ i. 59. 268; Cic. _Phil._ viii. 2. 7. Scholars are\r\nat variance as regards the character and motives of Sulpicius. Herzog,\r\n_Röm. Staatsverf._ i. 501 (cf. Ferrero, _Rome_, i. 85 f.), can see in\r\nhis measures no earnest purpose of reform. Ihne, _Hist. of Rome_, v.\r\n225 f., 233 f., hesitatingly inclines to regard him as a demagogue.\r\nFröhlich, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1532, looks upon him as a\r\nstatesman with a mind and heart for the best interests of his country.\r\nIn the opinion of Mommsen, _Hist. of Rome_, iii. (1898). 531 f., he was\r\nessentially the successor of Drusus, a reformer in the interest of the\r\nsenate, yet led by the force of circumstances to adopt revolutionary\r\nmethods. Cf. also Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 121-5; Long, _Rom. Rep._ II.\r\nch. xvii; Neumann, _Gesch. Roms_, i. 507-17.\r\n\r\n[2523] P. 277, 313 f.\r\n\r\n[2524] App. _B. C._ i. 59. 266: Εἰσηγοῦντό τε μηδὲν ἔτι ἀπροβούλευτον ἐς\r\nτὸν δῆμον ἐσφέρεσθαι, νενομισμένον μὲν οὕτω καὶ πάλαι, παραλελυμένον δ’\r\nἐκ πολλοῦ.\r\n\r\n[2525] Ibid.: Εἰσηγοῦντο ... καὶ τὰς χειροτονίας μὴ κατὰ φυλάς, ἀλλὰ κατὰ\r\nλόχους, ὡς Τύλλιος βασιλεὺς ἔταξε γίνεσθαι.\r\n\r\n[2526] P. 86.\r\n\r\n[2527] In _Hermes_, xxxiii (1898). 652.\r\n\r\n[2528] This view is held by Sunden, _De trib. pot. imm._ (1897) 21 ff.;\r\nMeyer, ibid. 652-4; Vassis, in _Athena_, xii (1900). 54-7. Fröhlich,\r\nin Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1537, supposes that elections\r\nsimply were thereby transferred to the comitia centuriata; but the\r\nword χειροτονίαι used by Appian, though often denoting elections (as\r\nin _B. C._ i. 14. 58-60; 15. 66; 28. 127, where the meaning is easily\r\nderived from the context), includes also voting on laws, as in _B. C._\r\ni. 23. 100; 55. 244. Had he meant elections, he would here have written\r\nἀρχαιρεσία (cf. i. 1. 1; 44. 196), as otherwise the meaning would have\r\nbeen doubtful. The view represented by Fröhlich, moreover, would in no\r\nway explain the passage, nor was it likely that Sulla would leave to\r\nthe tribes the ratification of laws but deprive them of the politically\r\nunimportant right to elect minor officials.\r\n\r\n[2529] Appian’s words πολλά τε ἄλλα τῆς τῶν δημάρχων ἀρχῆς ...\r\nπεριελόντες (i. 59. 267) imply an extensive curtailment of the\r\ntribunician power not definitely specified. The statement of Livy,\r\nep. lxxxix, that Sulla afterward (82) deprived the tribunes of all\r\nlegislative power (p. 413 below) is not true of his dictatorial\r\nlaw-giving, but belongs properly to the year under consideration.\r\n\r\n[2530] Lengle (_Sull. Verf._ 10) argues, on the contrary, that the\r\nmeasure could be intended for the tribunes only, because, as he supposes,\r\na patrician magistrate always consulted the senate concerning his\r\nlegislative proposals. But Lengle has reckoned without the facts. An\r\nexamination of the sources will show that from the time of the dictator\r\nPublilius Philo (Livy viii. 12. 14) to the time of the dictator Julius\r\nCaesar (Dio Cass. xxxviii. 3 f.; Plut. _Caes._ 14; App. _B. C._ ii. 10)\r\npatrician magistrates occasionally brought rogations before the comitia\r\nwithout the senatorial sanction. But it is possible that in speaking of\r\n“an ancient law long disused” (p. 406, n. 2) Appian may wrongly have had\r\nin mind the pre-Hortensian restriction on the plebiscite; p. 277, n. 4.\r\n\r\n[2531] _B.

From\r\nthis Ciceronian passage it is necessary to infer that the Valerian law\r\ncontained an article similar to the later Cornelian lex de proscriptione;\r\np. 421 below.\r\n\r\n[2557] _CIL._ i². p. 27.\r\n\r\n[2558] Livy, ep. lxxxix; App. _B.

Lat._ i. p. 11; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 154; Fröhlich, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1559; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii.\r\n158; Lengle, _Sull. Verf._ 11; Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, i. 390 f.,\r\n411. The conference between Sulla and Scipio, mentioned by Cic. _Phil._\r\nxii. 11. 27, referred to this arrangement. Sunden, _De rib. pot. imm._ 10\r\nff. (cf. Long, _Rom. Rep._ ii. 399 ff.), holding that Sulla abolished the\r\nright of the tribunes to propose laws, refuses to accept 71 as the date\r\nof the epigraphic lex above mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable (Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 175; Mommsen, _Röm. Strafr._\r\n654, n. 2), though it is not certain (Greenidge, _Leg. Proced._ 424, 430\r\nf.), that the lex Plautia de vi was proposed by a tribune of 78 or 77 as\r\nthe agent of Q. Lutatius Catulus, proconsul; Sall. _Cat._ 31; Schol. Bob.\r\n368; Cic. _Cael._ 29. 70; p. 424 below. Probably the lex Plautia which\r\nrecalled from exile L. Cornelius Cinna, brother-in-law of Caesar, and\r\nothers who, having shared in the insurrection of Lepidus, had gone over\r\nto Sertorius, was a plebiscite de senatus sententia of 73; Suet. _Caes._\r\n5; Gell. xiii. 3. 5; Val. Max. vii. 7. 6; Dio Cass. xliv. 47. 4; Lange,\r\n_Röm. Alt._ iii. 185; Maurembrecher, Sall. _Hist. Proleg._ 78; Münzer, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1287. Others assign the measure to 70;\r\ncf. Long, _Rom. Rep._ iii. 53. For other laws, see p. 424.\r\n\r\nThe statement of Livy’s epitomator concerning the lex Cornelia\r\nde tribunicia potestate would apply more accurately to the\r\nCornelian-Pompeian law of 88; p. 406.\r\n\r\n[2561] From Cic. _Cluent._ 40. 110 (cf. Long, _Rom. Rep._ ii. 400) we\r\nshould infer that under the Cornelian government no tribunician contio\r\nwas held; but we know that this is not true. In 76 a contio was summoned\r\nby L. Sicinius, tribune of the plebs; _Orat._ of Licinius Macer, in\r\nSall. _Hist._ iii. 48. 8: “L. Sicinius primus de potestate tribunicia\r\nloqui ausus mussantibus vobis”; cf. Pseud. Ascon. 103; Plut. _Caes._\r\n7; Cic. _Brut._ 60. 216 f. In 74 the tribune Quinctius held contiones;\r\nCic. _Cluent._ 34. 93; Sall. _Hist._ ibid. § 11. The oration of Licinius\r\nMacer, quoted by Sallust, _Hist._ iii. 48, is a tribunician harangue.\r\nFinally in 71 the tribune Palicanus held a contio outside the city that\r\nPompey might attend; p. 426.\r\n\r\n[2562] Cic. _Verr._ II. i. 60. 155: Q. Opimius was prosecuted in a\r\nfinable action on the ground that as tribune in 75 (Pseud. Ascon. 200)\r\nhe had interceded in violation of a Cornelian law, which must have fixed\r\nthe fine. The statement of Caesar, _B. C._ i. 5. 1; 7. 3, that Sulla\r\nleft the tribunes the right of intercession proves no more than that he\r\ndid not wholly abolish it. Cf. further Sunden, _De trib. pot. imm._ 4;\r\nDrumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, ii. 411, n. 10.\r\n\r\n[2563] Cic. _Verr._ i. 13. 38: “Sublata populi Romani in unum quemque\r\nvestrum potestate.”\r\n\r\n[2564] P. 245, 266, 315.\r\n\r\n[2565] Cic. _Leg._ iii. 9. 22.\r\n\r\n[2566] App. _B.

Ill._ 75.\r\n11; App. _B. C._ ii. 29. 113. Tacitus, _Ann._ iii. 27, is non-committal.\r\nIn general on the lex de tribunicia potestate, see Lange, _Röm. Alt._\r\niii. 153 f.; Fröhlich, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1559;\r\nDrumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, ii. 410 ff.; Lengle, _Sull.

Staatsr._ i. 529.\r\n\r\n[2573] In the thirty-sixth year of his age Pompey was not yet qualified\r\nfor the quaestorship; Cic. _Imp. Pomp._ 21. 62. Cicero, who was\r\nconsul in his forty-third year, states that he obtained the office\r\nat the earliest legal age; _Leg. Agr._ ii. 2. 3. An interval of two\r\nyears between successive offices would place the quaestorship in the\r\nthirty-seventh year; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 527, 569; Fröhlich,\r\nin Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1560; but soon after Sulla it came\r\nabout, probably through further legislation, that the office was often\r\nfilled in the thirty-first year; Mommsen, ibid. 570 ff.\r\n\r\n[2574] Cic. _Dom._ 43. 112; _Fam._ x. 25. 2; 26. 2 f.\r\n\r\n[2575] Tac. _Ann._ xi. 22; cf.

C._\r\ni. 32; Dio Cass. xl. 51. 2.\r\n\r\n[2579] P. 332. There were probably twelve; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 163;\r\nMommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 543.\r\n\r\n[2580] Tac. _Ann._ xi. 22: “Lege Sullae viginti creati supplendo\r\nsenatui.” The eighth chapter of this law concerning the twenty quaestors\r\nis preserved in an inscription; _CIL._ i. 202; Bruns, _Font. Iur._ p. 90;\r\nGirard, _Textes_, p. 64. It regulates the qualifications, appointment,\r\nand pay of the apparitores of the quaestors. An important fact derived\r\nfrom the praescriptio is that the law was adopted in the tribal assembly.\r\nSince in the case of one law the centuriate assembly is mentioned as\r\nif exceptional (p. 422), we may infer that most of Sulla’s enactments\r\nwere tribal. On the apparitores, see Mommsen, in _Rhein. Mus._ N. F.\r\nvi (1846). 1-57; _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 332-46; Habel, in Pauly-Wissowa,\r\n_Real-Encycl._ ii. 191-4; Keil, J., in _Wiener Studien_, xxiv (1902).\r\n548-51.\r\n\r\n[2581] Pomponius, in _Dig._ i. 2. 2. 32, wrongly says to ten—a number\r\nreached by the legislation of Caesar; Dio Cass. xlii. 51. 3; p. 454\r\nbelow. On the relation of the praetors to the courts, see p. 420.\r\n\r\n[2582] Livy, ep. lxxxix, who connects it closely with the increase in\r\nthe number of senators, placing it thus among his earlier measures;\r\n(Aurel. Vict.) _Vir. Ill._ 75. 11; Servius, _in Aen._ vi. 73; cf. Tac.\r\n_Ann._ vi. 12; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 157; Fröhlich, in Pauly-Wissowa,\r\n_Real-Encycl._ iv. 1559 f.; Lengle, _Sull. Verf._ 1-9. That the increase\r\nin the last-named college was due to Sulla seems certain, though it is\r\nnowhere stated. It is possible, too, that the increase of the epulones\r\nfrom three to seven was his work; Lengle, ibid. 2.\r\n\r\n[2583] P. 391.\r\n\r\n[2584] Livy, ep. lxxxix; Dio Cass. xxxvii. 37. 1; Pseud.

The Servilian agrarian\r\nrogation, 63 (p. 435 below), drawn up before the enactment of the Atian\r\nplebiscite of that year which restored the election of sacerdotes,\r\nassumes that the comitia pontificis maximi were at the time in use.

A proof that he completed his legislation in\r\nthis year is the fact that he looked upon the following as a time of\r\nprobation for his system (App. _B. C._ i. 103; Cic. _Rosc.

Cicero, however, attributes to him a\r\nlex de iudiciis privatis, which his brother caused to be repealed in the\r\nfollowing year; _Cornel._ i. 19. It is not otherwise known.\r\n\r\n[2654] Sall. _Cat._ 31; Gaius ii. 45; Cuq, in Daremberg et Saglio,\r\n_Dict._ iii. 1159. For the cases coming before this court, see Greenidge,\r\n_Leg.

The consuls of 73 passed a frumentarian measure—the\r\nlex Cassia Terentia, considered below; p. 444, n. 6.\r\n\r\n[2657] Sall. _Hist._ iv. 1, in Gell. xviii. 4. 4. Sallust speaks of\r\nnothing more than the promulgation of the law; but we know that afterward\r\nan attempt was made to collect the moneys; Ascon. 72; cf. Lange, _Röm.\r\nAlt._ iii. 190, 221; Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, ii. 467. Münzer,\r\nin Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ iv. 1380, speaks of the measure as a\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nThe same consul with his colleague, L. Gellius Poplicola, proposed and\r\ncarried a law for confirming the grants of citizenship already made by\r\nPompey in Spain; Cic. _Balb._ 8. 19; 14. 32 f.; Pliny, _N. H._ v. 5. 36.\r\nTheir joint proposal that provincials should not in their absence be\r\ntried on a capital charge took the form merely of a senatus consultum;\r\nCic. _Verr._ II. ii. 38. 95; Münzer, ibid.; Drumann-Gröbe, ibid.\r\n\r\nIn 71 (_CIL._ i. 593 = vi. 1299) and in 62 (_CIL._ i. 600 = vi. 1305)\r\nthere was a curator viarum e lege Visellia.

Staatsv._ i. 114 f.; Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_,\r\niii. 182.\r\n\r\n[2793] Dio Cass. xxxviii. 7. 3; _Cat. Min._ 33; Suet. _Caes._ 20; Vell.\r\nii. 44. 4. Whereas Cicero was of the opinion that this district could\r\nprovide not more than five thousand with lots of ten iugera, Suetonius\r\nand Velleius state that twenty thousand were settled in it. Some\r\nCampanian land remained undivided in 51; Cic. _Fam._ viii. 10. 4. Many\r\nsettlements under the Julian law are mentioned in the _liber coloniarum_,\r\nin Gromat. 210, 220, 231, 235, 239, 259, 260.\r\n\r\nIt was in accord with Caesar’s policy of colonization and of the\r\nextension of the franchise that P. Vatinius, tribune of the plebs in this\r\nyear, carried a law for sending five thousand new settlers to Comum, a\r\nLatin colony in northern Italy. Some of the new residents he honored with\r\nthe citizenship; Strabo v. 16; Suet. _Caes._ 28; App. _B. C._ ii. 26. 98;\r\nPlut. _Caes._ 29; Cic. _Att._ v. 11. 2; _Fam._ xiii. 35. 1. The franchise\r\nwas afterward withdrawn by a decree of the senate; Suet. and Plut. ibid.\r\n\r\n[2794] Dio Cassius, xxxviii. 7. 1 f. (cf. Schol. Bob. 302; App. _B. C._\r\nii. 12. 42), is probably wrong in saying that death was the penalty for\r\nrefusal to swear. Cicero (_Sest._ 28. 61) and Plutarch (_Cat. Min._ 32)\r\nspeak simply of heavy penalties.\r\n\r\n[2795] Cic. _Att._ ii. 18. 2. The provision regarding the oath was not\r\nintroduced till it was found that the senate opposed.\r\n\r\nSupplementary to these Julian laws is the lex Mamilia Roscia Peducaea\r\nAlliena Fabia, three articles of which are contained in Gromat. 263-6;\r\nBruns, _Font. Iur._ 96-8; Girard, _Textes_, 69 f. Other references to\r\na lex Mamilia are Gromat. 11. 5; 12. 12; 37. 24; 144. 19; 169. 7; Cic.\r\n_Leg._ i. 21. 55. The last proves it to have been passed before 51. The\r\nseeming citation of the third article as an agrarian law of Gaius Caesar\r\nby _Dig._ xlvii. 21. 3, may indicate merely a borrowing of this article\r\nfrom the earlier law of Caesar, just as article 2 is substantially\r\nrepeated in _Lex Col. Genet._ 104. Mommsen, in _Röm. Feldmess._ ii.\r\n221-6; _Röm. Staatsr._ ii. 628, n. 4, considers it the work of a second\r\nsub-committee (Vviri) of the vigintiviri provided for by the agrarian\r\nlaw, enacted to furnish rules for the administration of the latter. Lange\r\n(_Röm. Alt._ ii. 690; iii. 288) and more decidedly Willems (_Sén. Rom._\r\ni. 498, n. 5) prefer to regard it as a tribunician law and to assign it\r\nto 55.\r\n\r\n[2796] Cf.

The frumentarian\r\nlaw of Appuleius Saturninus for lowering the price to five-sixths of an\r\n_as_ had been annulled (p. 395 f.), and the law in force in 82, whether\r\nthe Sempronian or the Octavian, was repealed by Sulla (p. 422). Lepidus,\r\nconsul in 78, carried a law for the distribution of five modii of grain\r\nto the citizen, at what price and at what interval is not stated (p. 423,\r\nn. 8). There was also a lex frumentaria of the consuls of 73, C. Cassius\r\nVarus and M. Terentius Varro (Cic. _Verr._ iii. 70. 163; v. 21. 52; cf.\r\nSall. _Hist._ iii. 48. 19). It must have restored, or maintained, the\r\nSempronian price, which according to the sources was displaced by the\r\nClodian provision for free grain. Probably by an article of this law,\r\nrather than by a new enactment, Sex. Clodius, a dependent of the tribune,\r\nwas given charge of the distribution; Cic. _Dom._ 10. 25.

Bob.\r\n346.—(4) Possibly a lex Scribonia de usucapione servitutum was the work\r\nof C. Scribonius Curio, tribune in 50, though more probably it belongs\r\nto an earlier date; p. 424, n. 4.—(5) An unpassed alimentary rogation of\r\nthe same Scribonius for ordering the aediles to control the weights and\r\nmeasures of the markets in a way to give justice to the poor; Cic. _Fam._\r\nviii. 6. 5; App. _B. C._ ii. 27. 102.—(6) Another unpassed Scribonian\r\nbill for limiting the travelling expenses of senators; Cic. _Att._ vi.\r\n1. 25.—(7) An unpassed Scribonian bill concerning the Campanian land;\r\nCic. _Fam._ viii. 10. 4.—(8) An unpassed Scribonian rogatio viaria, like\r\nthe agrarian rogation of Servilius Rullus (p. 435); Cic. _Fam._ viii.\r\n6. 5.—(9) An unpassed Scribonian bill for confiscating the realm of\r\nKing Juba; Caes. _B.

Hirtius concerning the\r\npartisans of Pompey (Cic. _Phil._ xiii. 16. 32; _CIL._ i. p. 627 f.;\r\nWillems, _Sén. Rom._ i. 592), though Mommsen (_CIL._ l. c.) assigns it to\r\n46.\r\n\r\n[2863] Dio. Cass. xlii. 20.\r\n\r\n[2864] Ibid. 21. That his appointment was for an indefinite time, not for\r\na year as Dio Cassius, ibid. 20, states, is proved by _CIL._ i.² p. 28,\r\n41. He held the office till news of the victory at Thapsus reached Rome.\r\n\r\n[2865] Dio Cass. xlii. 20.\r\n\r\n[2866] Dio Cass. xliii. 14; cf. Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, iii. 48 f.\r\n\r\n[2867] Dio Cassius, xliii. 42-6, describes them at great length, whereas\r\nSuetonius, _Caes._ 76, is content with a brief enumeration.\r\n\r\n[2868] Dio Cass. xliii. 44; _CIL._ ix. 2563; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._\r\nii. 767, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[2869] The right to the consulship was granted according to Dio Cassius,\r\nxliii. 45. 1 (προεχειρίσαντο), by a vote of the people. In general it is\r\nimpossible to determine which senatus consulta for conferring these and\r\nfuture honors were ratified by the comitia. The perpetual dictatorship\r\nwas assumed February, 44; Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, iii. 739.\r\n\r\n[2870] Dio Cass. xliv. 5. 3.\r\n\r\n[2871] Ibid. 7. 3; Suet. _Caes._ 52. 3. Two laws of the consul M.\r\nAntonius were also enacted in his honor, the first changing the name of\r\nthe month Quinctilis to Julius (Macrob. _Sat._ i. 12. 34), the second\r\ndedicating to Caesar the fifth day of the Roman games (Cic. _Phil._ ii.\r\n43. 110).\r\n\r\n[2872] Cf. Bondurant, _Dec. Jun. Brut._ 40.\r\n\r\n[2873] Caes. _B. C._ iii. 1; Cic. _Att._ vii. 11. 1.\r\n\r\n[2874] Caes. _B. C._ iii. 1; Suet. _Caes._ 42; Dio Cass. xli. 37 f.; App.\r\n_B. C._ ii. 48. 198; Plut. _Caes._ 37. Possibly the lex Iulia de bonorum\r\ncessione (Gaius iii. 78; Theod. Cod. iv. 20; Justin. Cod. vii. 71. 4) may\r\nbe identical with this law.\r\n\r\n[2875] Dio Cass. xli. 38. 1 f.; Cic. _Att._ ix. 9. 4.\r\n\r\n[2876] Agitation leading to this measure found expression in a rogation\r\nof M. Caelius Rufus, praetor in 48, for the payment of debts in six years\r\nwithout interest (Caes. _B. C._ iii. 20) and somewhat later in a rogation\r\nfor an extensive, perhaps complete, abolition of debts (Caes. _B. C._\r\niii. 21; Livy, ep. cxi; Vell. ii. 68. 1 f.; Dio Cass. xlii. 22-5); in a\r\nrogation of P. Cornelius Dolabella, tribune of the plebs in 47, for the\r\ncomplete abolition of debts (Livy, ep. cxiii; Plut. _Ant._ 9; Dio Cass.\r\nxlii. 29. 32); and in rogations by these two officials respectively for\r\nthe remission of rents (treated by the sources in connection with their\r\nbills on insolvency).\r\n\r\n[2877] Suet. _Caes._ 38; Dio Cass. xlii. 51. 1.\r\n\r\n[2878] On the similar measure of Octavianus, see p. 459. See also Lange,\r\n_Röm. Alt._ ii. 694; iii. 435.\r\n\r\n[2879] This measure seems to have been brought about by no law but merely\r\nthrough his censorial power; Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 448; Drumann-Gröbe,\r\n_Gesch. Roms_, iii. 557.\r\n\r\n[2880] A Julian colonial law is mentioned by _Lex Col. Genet._ 97. The\r\nveterans were settled in Italy probably under the agrarian law of 59;\r\nSuet. _Caes._ 81. 1. The known colonies founded under the dictatorial\r\nlaw are included in Kornemann’s list, in Pauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._\r\niv. 524 ff.; cf. Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, iii. 604-6. His most\r\nfamous colonies were Carthage (App. _Lib._ 136; Dio Cass. xliii. 50. 3\r\nf.; Plut. _Caes._ 57; Strabo xvii. 3. 5) and Corinth (Dio Cass. ibid. §\r\n4; Plut. ibid.; Strabo viii. 6. 3; xvii. 3. 15; Paus. ii. 1. 2; 3. 1).\r\nThe colonia Genetiva Iulia Urbanorum in Spain was founded in 44 after\r\nthe death of Caesar, but iussu C. Caesaris dict. imp. et lege Antonia\r\nsenat(us)que c(onsulto) pl(ebi)que (scito)—by a consular law of Antonius\r\nfor the founding of the colony, supplemented by a plebiscite of unknown\r\nauthorship.\r\n\r\nThe inscription known as the lex Coloniae Genetivae Iuliae (_CIL._ ii.\r\nsupplb. 5439; Bruns, _Font. Iur._ 123-40; Girard, _Textes_, 87-103) is\r\na part of the lex data (§ 67), or charter, granted the colony by its\r\nfounder. It was called Urbanorum because it was made up of proletarians\r\nfrom Rome; cf. Kornemann, ibid. 527.\r\n\r\n[2881] Suet. _Caes._ 42. At the same time measures were taken to prevent\r\nthose residents of Italy who were liable to military service from\r\nabsenting themselves unduly from the country. To give employment to the\r\npoor, the owners of herds were ordered to make up one-third of their\r\nshepherds from freemen; ibid.\r\n\r\n[2882] Dio Cass. xli. 18. 2; xliv. 47. 4; Plut. _Caes._ 37; Suet. _Caes._\r\n41; cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 416.\r\n\r\n[2883] Caes. _B. C._ iii. 1; cf. Suet. _Caes._ 41.\r\n\r\n[2884] Cic. _Phil._ xii. 4. 10; Tac. _Ann._ xi. 24; Dio Cass. xli. 36.\r\n3; cf. xxxvii. 9. 3-5. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 134; 159, n. 1;\r\nKrüger-Brissaud, _Sourc. d. droit Rom._ 97, for the authorship of the law.\r\n\r\nThe so-called lex Rubria de Gallia Cisalpina (_CIL._ i. 205 = xi. 1146;\r\nBruns, _Font. Iur._ 98-102; Girard, _Textes_, 70-76) seems to be a lex\r\ndata, probably of 49 [Mommsen, in _Wiener Studien_, xxiv (1902). 238 f.;\r\n_Ephem. Ep._ ix. 1903. p. 4]. As the lex Rubria cited in § 20 is not this\r\ndocument but an earlier plebiscite, the name of the author has not been\r\ndetermined. It regulated the administration of justice in Cisalpina,\r\nwhich remained a province till 42. The fragment of a law found at Ateste\r\n(Bruns, ibid. 102 f.; Girard, _Textes_, (76-8) is of the same nature\r\nand belongs to the same period, though probably not to the Rubrian law\r\nitself, as Mommsen (_Hermes_, xvi. 24-41) once assumed.\r\n\r\n[2885] Dio Cass. xli. 24. 1; cf. Livy, ep. cx. The monarchical quality of\r\nhis rule shows itself in his bestowal of the citizenship on individuals\r\nat his own pleasure; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 134.\r\n\r\nIn 44 the lex Iulia de Siculis, published by Antonius after the death\r\nof Caesar, gave the full citizenship to the Sicilians, who had received\r\nthe Latinitas from Caesar. This law, Antonius asserted, had been carried\r\nthrough the comitia by the dictator, whereas Cicero, _Att._ xiv. 12. 1,\r\nstates positively that no mention was even made of such a proposition in\r\nthe dictator’s lifetime.\r\n\r\n[2886] Dio Cass. xlii. 51. 4; Suet. _Caes._ 41; wrongly Pomponius, in\r\n_Dig._ i. 2. 2. 2. 32. The two additional aediles (cereales) were not\r\ninstituted till 44; Dio Cass. xliii. 51. 3.\r\n\r\n[2887] Dio Cass. xlii. 51. 3; cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 437; p. 416\r\nabove. The addition of one to the fifteen members of the great sacerdotal\r\ncolleges (Dio Cass. ibid.; cf. Cic. _Fam._ xiii. 68. 2) refers to his\r\nright to commend candidates for supernumerary membership (Wissowa, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, _Real-Encycl._ ii. 2317), and hence does not imply a\r\ncomitial act.\r\n\r\n[2888] Cic. _Phil._ vii. 6. 16.\r\n\r\n[2889] Suet. _Caes._ 41; cf. Dio Cass. xliii. 51. 3. The pretext was the\r\nimpending Parthian war. In 46 he had been given the right to name all the\r\nmagistrates but had rejected it; Dio Cass. xliii. 14. 5; 45. 1; 47. 1;\r\ncf. Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, iii. 612, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[2890] Livy, ep. cxvi; Dio Cass. xliv. 10. 1-3; xlvi. 49. 2. In the\r\nfollowing year a tribune was similarly deposed by a plebiscite of P.\r\nTitius, a colleague (Dio Cass. xlvi. 49. 1); and in 43, before the\r\nestablishment of the triumvirate, the city praetor was deprived of his\r\noffice by his colleagues, probably through a comitial act; App. _B. C._\r\niii. 95. 394 f.; Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ i. 630, n. 4.\r\n\r\n[2891] P. 427.\r\n\r\n[2892] Suet. _Caes._ 41; Dio Cass. xliii. 25. 1. Cicero, _Phil._ i. 8.\r\n19, intimates, without positively stating, that this was a centuriate\r\nlaw; p. 236 above.\r\n\r\n[2893] Cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 455; Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_,\r\niii. 558.\r\n\r\n[2894] We are informed that he increased the penalties for crimes, and\r\nenacted that a person condemned to exile should forfeit half his estate,\r\nand the murderer of a relative the whole; Suet. _Caes._ 42; cf. Dio Cass.\r\nxliv. 49. 3.\r\n\r\n[2895] Cic. _Phil._ i. 9. 23.\r\n\r\n[2896] The Julian laws on these subjects in the _Digesta_, xlviii. 4 (de\r\nmaiestate), 6 f. (de vi) prove by their contents to belong to Augustus;\r\nDrumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, iii. 560. 4; cf. Lange, _Röm. Alt._ iii.\r\n455. The leges Iuliae which abolished what remained of the legis actiones\r\n(Gaius iv. 30) are also supposed to belong to Augustus; Poste, _Gaius_,\r\n474.\r\n\r\n[2897] Cic. _Att._ xiii. 7.\r\n\r\n[2898] Cic. _Fam._ ix. 15. 5; 26. 3; Suet. _Caes._ 43.\r\n\r\n[2899] Cic. _Att._ xii. 35; 36. 1.\r\n\r\n[2900] Cic. _Att._ xiii. 7; Suet. _Caes._ 43; Dio Cass. xliii. 25. 2; cf.\r\nDrumann-Gröbe, _Gesch.

The lex Iulia et Titia, which gave provincial governors\r\nthe right to name tutors (Gaius i. 185, 195; Ulp. xi. 18; frag. d. Sin.\r\n20; _Inst._ i. 20) may be a part of the lex de provinciis (Voigt, _Röm.\r\nRechtsgesch._ i. 840 f.), or a supplement to it. The expression may refer\r\neither to one law or to two related laws. The Julian lex de liberis\r\nlegationibus, limiting their duration (Cic. _Att._ xv. 11. 4), also\r\nbelongs to 46.\r\n\r\n[2903] _CIL._ i. 206; Bruns, _Font. Iur._ 104-13; Dessau, ii. 6085;\r\nGirard, _Textes_, 78-87. The extant fragment, originally known as the\r\nTable of Heraclea (Lucania) from the place where it was found, is\r\ninscribed on a bronze tablet now in the National Museum at Naples. As it\r\ndisqualified for office any who had taken part in the proscriptions (§\r\n121), it must have followed the downfall of the Cornelian régime in 70,\r\nand the mention of the month Quinctilis (§ 98) proves that it preceded\r\nthe renaming of that month in 43. A reference to one of its provisions\r\n(§§ 94, 104) by Cicero, _Fam._ vi. 18. 1 (Jan., 45) as of a law freshly\r\npassed, proves it to be no later than January, 45; cf. Savigny, _Verm.\r\nSchr._ iii (1850). 279-412; Karlowa, _Röm. Rechtsgesch._ i. 438; Girard,\r\n_Textes_, 78. It must have been passed, therefore, before Caesar set out\r\nfor Spain, about November, 46; Drumann-Gröbe, _Gesch. Roms_, iii. 569.\r\n\r\n[2904] For the various hypotheses, see Hackel, in _Wiener Studien_, xxiv\r\n(1902). 552-62.\r\n\r\n[2905] Kalb, in _Jahresb. ü. Altwiss._ 1906. 37. The identification of\r\nthis law with the lex Iulia municipalis cited in an inscription found\r\nat Padua (_CIL._ v. 2864) and with the lex municipalis of the _Digesta_\r\n(1. 9. 3; _Cod._ vii. 9. 1), proposed by Savigny, ibid., is not certain;\r\nGirard, _Textes_, 78.\r\n\r\n[2906] _Lex Iul.

Stud._ xxiv.\r\n560, supposes that Caesar had intended to bring the provisions of this\r\nmeasure before the comitia as two separate laws, but in his haste to be\r\noff for Spain, combined them in one. At all events the interpretation\r\ngiven above is true of the result if not of the intention.\r\n\r\n[2912] Many of his regulations were effected through edicts. Such were\r\nprobably the imposition of duties on goods imported into Italy—an\r\nabolition of the law of 60 (Suet. _Caes._ 43; cf. p. 438), the leasing of\r\nthe emery mines in Crete (_Dig._ xxxix. 4. 15), and the suppression of\r\nthe collegia which had been organized under the Clodian law of 58; Suet.\r\n_Caes._ 42; Joseph. _Ant.

After the Antonian laws had been annulled\r\nby the senate, February, 43, on the ground that they had been passed\r\nwith violence and contrary to the auspices (Cic. _Phil._ vi. 2. 3; Dio\r\nCass. xlv. 27), the acts of Caesar are confirmed anew by a centuriate\r\nlaw of C. Vibius Pansa, consul in that year; Cic. _Phil._ x. 8. 17;\r\nLange, _Röm. Alt._ iii. 526. The policy of using the departed Caesar as a\r\nmeans of self-aggrandizement readily lent itself to Octavianus, at whose\r\ninstigation Q. Pedius, his colleague in the consulship in 43, caused a\r\ncomitial act to be passed for the establishment of a special court to try\r\nthe murderers of the dictator. The act specified the punishment to be\r\ninflicted on the guilty and offered rewards to informers; Vell. ii. 69.\r\n5; Suet. _Ner._ 3; _Galb._ 3; Dio Cass. xlvi. 48 f.; App. _B.

Other terms connected with the enactment, repeal,\r\nand alteration of laws are explained by Ulp. _Reg._ 3: “Lex est rogatur,\r\nid est fertur, aut abrogatur, id est prior lex tollitur, aut derogatur,\r\nid est pars primae legis tollitur, aut subrogatur, id est adiicitur\r\naliquid primae legi, aut obrogatur, id est mutatur aliquid ex prima\r\nlege.” The classification of laws as curiate, centuriate, and tribal\r\naccording to the form of the comitia, and as consular, tribunician, etc.\r\naccording to the office of the lator does not need explanation.\r\n\r\n[2951] _Dig._ xiii. 2. 1; Gromat. 265.\r\n\r\n[2952] Cf. _Frag.

These sources prove,\r\nagainst Lange, _Röm. Alt._ ii. 483, that the right to vote in a tribe\r\ndrawn thus by lot was not restricted to those who were virtually citizens\r\nawaiting enrolment. It is probable that, at least in early time, not even\r\nresidence was a requirement; cf. Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 232, n. 2,\r\n396 f., 643 f.\r\n\r\n[2979] In the opinion of Mommsen, _Röm. Staatsr._ iii. 397, n. 4, 411,\r\nn. 7; _Abhdl. sächs. Gesellsch. d. Wiss._ ii (1857). 426, n. 107, the\r\nprincipium had nothing to do with the order of voting. His argument\r\nis based chiefly on the fact that according to the _Lex Mal._ 55—a\r\nconstitution evidently based in large part on that of Rome—the curiae\r\nvoted simultaneously. Reference to the preliminary vote of a single\r\nRoman tribe, however, is made by Plut. _Aemil._ 31; App. _B. C._ i. 12.\r\n52. Furthermore it is difficult to understand why so great importance\r\nshould attach to the principium on Mommsen’s supposition that it had\r\nmerely to do with the order of announcement after the simultaneous vote\r\nof all the tribes. His view is accepted by Liebenam, in Pauly-Wissowa,\r\n_Real-Encycl._ iv. 684, but rejected by Lange, _Kl. Schr._ ii. 477 f.;\r\nHerzog, _Röm. Staatsverf._ 1184, and ignored by most other writers,\r\nincluding Liebenam, inconsistently; ibid. 706.\r\n\r\n[2980] “Sitellam deferre.” It was filled with water, the lots were\r\nthrown in, and the drawing was effected by pouring out the water, which\r\ncaused the pieces to fall one by one.

WARDE FOWLER\r\n\r\nSocial Life at Rome in the Age of Cicero\r\n\r\n_Cloth, Illustrated, 8vo, $2.25 net_\r\n\r\nA notable example of the kind of history that deals with men rather\r\nthan with institutions and events is “Social Life at Rome in the Age of\r\nCicero,” by the learned scholar and fascinating writer W. Warde Fowler.\r\nThe book was originally intended as a companion to Professor Tucker’s\r\n“Life in Ancient Athens”; but it grew beyond the limits of that volume\r\nbecause of the wealth of material Mr. Fowler felt himself compelled to\r\nutilize. As the author points out in his preface, there is no book in\r\nthe English language which supplies a picture of life and manners, of\r\neducation, morals, and religion, in the intensely interesting period\r\nof the Roman Republic. The age of Cicero is one of the most important\r\nperiods of Roman history, and the Ciceronian correspondence, of more\r\nthan nine hundred contemporary letters, is the richest treasure-house of\r\nsocial life that has survived from any period of classical antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy SAMUEL DILL, M.A.\r\n\r\nHon.

It should be distinctly understood that this work is the\r\nproduct of first-hand, not second-hand, erudition and investigation....\r\nThis book is what it purports to be, a social, not a political\r\nhistory.”—M.

It is more vital to the student of modern social,\r\nreligious, and political tendencies than a large share of the strictly\r\nmodern sociological theses, studies, and dissertations now issuing in\r\nsuch profusion from the workshops of the doctor-making universities.\r\nAnd, aside from its inherent importance, its thoughts are so lucidly and\r\nattractively expressed that no intelligent reader, whether a Latinist or\r\nnot, can fail to find it pleasant reading.”—_The Evening Post_, New York.\r\n\r\n                               PUBLISHED BY\r\n                          THE MACMILLAN COMPANY\r\n             Sixty-four and Sixty-six Fifth Avenue, New York\r\n\r\n\r\nPROF. MARTIN L. D’OOGE’S\r\n\r\nThe Acropolis of Athens\r\n\r\n_Cloth, Illustrated, 8vo, $4.00 net_\r\n\r\n“This handsome book embodies the results of a number of years of study\r\nand of repeated visits to Athens, where in 1886-87 author was director\r\nof the American School of Classical Studies. While some of the older\r\nproblems connected with the history of the Acropolis have been solved by\r\nthe aid of the discoveries completed in 1889, others have been raised\r\nwhich await further light. A final satisfactory history of the Acropolis\r\nand its monuments may never be written, but this work gives a summary of\r\nthe most important contributions to its history and states the results of\r\nthe author’s study of the site and of the ruins upon it.”\r\n\r\nHis new book is published as a companion volume to Professor Seymour’s\r\n“Life in the Homeric Age,” which proved so popular. It is designed both\r\nfor readers who have a general interest in Greek history and Greek art\r\nand for students and visitors at Athens who desire to use a handbook upon\r\nthe spot. The history of the Acropolis is traced from the time of its\r\nearliest occupation down to the present, and the volume is handsomely\r\nillustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A COMPANION VOLUME_\r\n\r\nPROF.
