In the first of them\r\nthe main lines of imperial development in Greece are sketched. In the\r\nothers I have tried to characterize, having regard rather to clearness\r\nthan to novelty or completeness, the chief imperial growths which\r\narose in Greece during the transformance of city-states from ultimate\r\nto constituent political units. I hope that these discussions of the\r\ntheory and practice of government in the empires of Athens, Sparta,\r\nAlexander, the Ptolemies, Seleucids, and Antigonids will be found\r\nuseful by the general reader, and especially by the student of politics\r\nand history. The idea I wish particularly to convey, however, is that\r\nthere was continuity of constitutional development within the whole\r\nperiod. The city-state, indeed, reached its greatest efficiency in the\r\ntime of Pericles, but the federation of city-states was being still\r\nperfected two hundred years afterwards. In government, as in science,\r\nthe classic period was but the youthful bloom of Greece, whereas its\r\nvigorous maturity--in which it was cut down by Rome--came in the\r\nMacedonian time.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, my thesis is this: The city-states of Greece were\r\nunicellular organisms with remarkable insides, and they were incapable\r\nof growth except by subdivision. They might reproduce their kind\r\nindefinitely, but the cells, new and old, could not combine to form\r\na strong nation. Thus it happened that after Athens and Sparta had\r\ntried in vain to convert their hegemonies over Greece into empires, a\r\ncancerous condition arose in Hellas, for which the proper remedy was\r\nnot to change the internal constitutions of city-states, as Plato and\r\nAristotle taught, but to change the texture of their cell walls so as\r\nto enable them to adhere firmly to one another. With a conservatism\r\nthoroughly in harmony with the later character of the Greek people, the\r\nGreeks struggled against this inevitable and salutary change. But in\r\nthe end they had to yield, saving, however, what they could of their\r\nurban separateness, while creating quasi-territorial states, by the use\r\nof the federal system and deification of rulers. These two contrivances\r\nwere, accordingly, rival solutions of the same great political problem.\r\nNothing reveals more clearly the limitations of Greek political theory\r\nthan that it takes no account either of them or of their antecedents.\r\n\r\n Cambridge, Mass., June, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n      I.

Power may be exercised there by a monarchy, an\r\noligarchy, or a majority without altering in any essential the relation\r\nof the sovereign to its dependencies. Still less does it matter whether\r\nthe subject people is governed by the one, the few, or the many; for\r\nall kinds of governments may exist, and have existed, in dependencies.\r\n\r\nNaturally, an empire is compatible with any kind of an administrative\r\nservice among both governors and governed. The suzerain may attend\r\nto its affairs with the aid of professional and specially trained\r\nofficials, as in a bureaucracy; and a vassal may entrust the details of\r\nits public business to successive fractions of its citizens, as in some\r\nrepublics: no imperial relation is established unless separate states\r\nor parts of states are involved. But when these are related in a whole\r\nas superiors and inferiors, an empire at once arises.\r\n\r\nThe relation of inferiority and superiority is, however, essential\r\nin any empire. In modern times this is acknowledged with the utmost\r\nfrankness. Upon the higher capacity for government claimed by the\r\nChristian peoples, the Western cultures, or the Anglo-Saxons, as the\r\ncase may be, modern pride, greed, or conscience bases its right to\r\ncontrol inferior races. \"Take up the white man's burden\" is the modern\r\nsubstitute for the ancient commandment, \"Go ye into all the world and\r\npreach the Gospel to every creature.\" The possession of a better rule\r\nof public life imposes--it is affirmed--a missionary obligation no less\r\nweighty than the possession of a special rule of eternal life.\r\n\r\nLess exasperating, perhaps, than this assumption of moral and political\r\nsuperiority is the candid profession of the right of the stronger.\r\nThe right of conquest gives a title which is valid in international\r\nlaw when every other right is lacking. When superiority is stipulated\r\nto be absent, the product is a federation or something similar from\r\nwhich the name empire is withheld. When, in course of time, superiority\r\ndies out till a common right eventually embraces subject and sovereign\r\nalike, a new state arises, to which, as in the case of the present-day\r\nBritish world, the title empire is applied with some impropriety.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, still another kind of empire. In it the superior\r\nauthority is not a people, but an individual. He is called an emperor,\r\nand his family a dynasty. His authority is bestowed, as the present\r\nGerman Emperor said at Königsberg in 1910, not by \"parliaments, and\r\nmeetings, and decisions of the peoples, but by the grace of God alone.\"\r\nHe is \"a chosen instrument of Heaven,\" to speak with the same high\r\nauthority, and \"goes his way without regard to the views and opinions\r\nof the day.\" An emperor, thus defined, is not properly a part of his\r\nstate at all. He stands outside of it, and is equal or superior to it.\r\nHe is a state unto himself; and his jurisdiction is not domestic but\r\nimperial, in that he exercises dominion over another state. _L'état\r\nc'est moi_ is an imperfect definition of this kind of empire, however;\r\nfor it presumes the absence of political organization and activity\r\namong the subjects of the emperor. It presumes the permanency of the\r\ncondition of absolute surrender (_deditio_) which, with the Romans,\r\nprefaced the work of restoration--the reëstablishment of civil rights\r\nwithin an enlarged state. In actual experience, moreover, a complete\r\nautocracy never exists. The will of every emperor is bound by the\r\nlegislation which he has himself enacted, or accepted with the throne\r\nfrom his predecessor. If responsible to nothing else, he is responsible\r\nto his own past. He may withdraw his charters: he cannot violate them\r\nwith impunity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe policy by which a people or an autocrat acquires and maintains an\r\nempire, we call imperialism. The term is, of course, a legacy from\r\nRome--a mute witness to the peculiar importance of the Roman empire in\r\nthe history of state-building. And, I suppose, it is the policy of Rome\r\nthat we think of most instinctively when we allude to imperialism. This\r\nis by no means an accident. For not simply the type, but also many of\r\nthe most noteworthy varieties of this kind of policy, are found in the\r\nexperience of the Romans; and the course of political progress has been\r\nsuch that in the triumph of Rome imperialism reached its logical issue\r\nmore closely than either before or since in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nFor the logical issue of a thorough-going imperial policy--one in which\r\nthe possession of physical ability may be presupposed--is the formation\r\nof an universal empire. And, in fact, the two most powerful and ardent\r\nimperialists of antiquity, Alexander the Great and Julius Cæsar,\r\naimed to include in their dominions the entire inhabitable world.\r\nThis issue was, however, never more nearly reached than in the long\r\nperiod before and after the Christian era during which only shifting\r\nnomads and intractable Parthians disputed successfully the will of the\r\nRoman Senate and the orders of the Roman emperors. For five hundred\r\nyears after the triumph of Constantine the universality of the Roman\r\nempire was as mandatory in men's thinking as was the catholicity of\r\nthe Christian Church. \"There are many 'empires' in the world to-day,\"\r\nsays Professor Bury[1] in explaining the coronation of Charlemagne\r\nin 800 A.D., \"but in those days men could only conceive of one, the\r\nRoman _imperium_, which was simple and indivisible; two Roman empires\r\nwere unimaginable. There might be more than the one emperor; but these\r\nothers could only be legitimate and constitutional if they stood to\r\nhim in a collegial relation.\" How thoroughly the Romans impressed the\r\nconcept of universality upon the term empire may be judged by the fact\r\nthat, in the face of all realities, the Frankish monarchs at Aachen\r\nand the Greek kings at Constantinople ruled as colleagues a Roman\r\nempire which stretched from the borders of Armenia to the shores of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nTranscendent as is the imperial achievement of the Romans, and\r\nunrivaled as is the political sagacity with which they consolidated\r\ntheir power and made it enduring, it must still be recognized that\r\nthey were the heirs, in war, diplomacy, and government, of the Greeks,\r\ntheir predecessors. They worked with greater power and with larger\r\nunits than did the Spartans and the Athenians. They benefited by\r\nthe brilliant inventions and the costly errors of the Macedonians\r\nwhose kingdoms they destroyed. But their success simply brought to a\r\nculmination the imperial movement in which Sparta, Athens, and Macedon\r\nwere worthy co-workers. It is our task in this series of essays to\r\nexamine in turn the imperial experiments by which the Greeks not only\r\nwon a field for the display of their own talents, but also prepared the\r\nway for the unification of the ancient world in the empire of Rome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI alluded a moment ago to the smallness of the units with which the\r\nimperial policy of Sparta and Athens had to deal. Before proceeding in\r\nthe latter part of this chapter to trace the development of the forms\r\nby which imperialism was obscured, evaded, and ultimately justified in\r\nGreece, I should like to try to make clear the qualities which rendered\r\nthe little Hellenic communities so hard for imperial digestion. In\r\nclassic Greece, as in renascence Italy, the city was the state. It\r\nhad not always been so; for in the past the land had been at one time\r\nin the possession of rudimentary nations, called _ethne_. But in the\r\nclassic epoch these loose organisms persisted only in certain backward\r\nregions in the west and north. Elsewhere city-states had everywhere\r\nmade their appearance as early as the sixth century B.C.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances in which these city-states arose are shrouded in the\r\nmystery which surrounds most beginnings. They, accordingly, present all\r\nthe better opportunity for the construction of a theory; and perhaps\r\nthe theory which had once the greatest vogue is that enunciated by\r\nFustel de Coulanges in his brilliant book on _The Ancient City_. Of its\r\nmain propositions, however,--that each city-state came into being at a\r\nsingle moment; that it was an artificial structure deliberately modeled\r\non the preëxistent family; that the family was a religious association\r\ncreated and organized for the worship of ancestors; that the spirits of\r\nancestors were the first gods, or, indeed, were gods at all,--not one\r\nhas stood the test of a searching inquiry. On the contrary, it seems\r\nestablished that the city-state was the result of a natural growth, and\r\nthat the incidents which accompanied its development, while varied and\r\nnumerous, were all manifestations of political progress. Growth in the\r\ndirection of a large number of distinct states was natural in Greece in\r\nview of the well-known physical features of the country; but the study\r\nof geography does not explain why these states were cities. For the\r\ntrue explanation of this phenomenon we must not confine our observation\r\nto Greece. Broadly speaking, high culture is everywhere city-bred, and\r\nthe cities have regularly been the leaders in political development.\r\nIn Babylonia that was the case, though the urban centres there were\r\ndominated from a very early date by Semitic tribes from the desert.\r\nFree cities, like Tyre and Sidon, were the prime sources of Phoenician\r\nenterprise. The home of Roman law and government was a city, and when\r\nItaly led the world a second time, she was a complex of city-states.\r\nThe Hanse towns and the Flemish communes, the chartered cities of\r\nEngland and France, acquired political liberty or political rights long\r\nbefore the rest of Central Europe. Where, in fact, the cities have not\r\nbeen the mother, and the territorial states simply the foster-mother,\r\nof freedom and culture, exceptional conditions have existed--such as\r\nthe need of regulating the Nile's overflow in Egypt, and the model and\r\ninfluence of the Roman empire in Mohammedan and Christian Europe.\r\n\r\nThe city enables men to coöperate easily. In it ideas and feelings\r\nspread quickly. Life, property, and privileges are there protected by\r\nwalls, and, if need be, by street barricades. \"Two voices are there,\"\r\nwrote Wordsworth in 1807, his vision limited by the peril of England\r\nand Switzerland,--\r\n\r\n              \"one is of the sea,\r\n  One of the mountains; each a mighty Voice:\r\n  In both from age to age thou didst rejoice,\r\n  They were thy chosen music, Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of a city mob--that of Rome, Alexandria, Constantinople,\r\nFlorence, or Paris, for example--was generally raucous and often cruel.\r\nBut it made tyrants tremble and limited absolutism when the fear of\r\nassassination was powerless.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it is not with the origins, but with the characteristics,\r\nof the Greek city-states that we have to do mainly when we seek to\r\ndiscover the grounds of their hatred of all imperialistic projects.\r\nLet us, therefore, try to form a concrete impression of the salient\r\nfeatures of the hundreds of little states with which the progressive\r\nparts of Greece were honeycombed at the beginning of the classic\r\nperiod, in the sixth century B.C. Each political cell, so to speak, had\r\nits nucleus in a walled town and its substance in a small circuit of\r\ngrain, pasture, and garden land which the inhabitants of the town owned\r\nand cultivated. Most of the towns were simply hives of farmers. Whether\r\nthe farmers were landlords, small proprietors, or peasants; however\r\nmuch they were divided by lines of social cleavage, they were all able\r\nto meet on the common ground of a single occupation. And every day from\r\nMarch to November, from the out-cropping of the grass and foliage in\r\nthe spring, through the season of the grain harvest, the vintage, and\r\nthe picking of the olives, to the fall planting and seeding, the ebb\r\nand flow of agricultural life carried the population of the city to the\r\ncountry in the morning and back to the city again in the evening.\r\n\r\nThere were few towns in Greece whose land did not touch the sea;\r\nand from the sea another harvest was gathered. Fishing existed, of\r\ncourse; but that was not all. Transmarine commerce is never wholly\r\nabsent in any maritime country. In Greece it was especially favored\r\nby the difficulties of land transit, and by the excellence of the\r\nhighways which the sea laid while carving the country up into a\r\nmyriad of islands, head-lands, and estuaries. Hence, by the opening\r\nof the sixth century B.C. a second town had generally appeared on\r\nthe coast of each little state when the chief town had developed, as\r\nwas commonly the case, a few miles inland. In the new settlement the\r\ntone was set by the sailor-folk and the traders; in the old centre\r\nby the landed proprietors and the peasants. But the landlords were\r\nfrequently merchants, and the peasants could easily attach work-places\r\n(_ergasteria_) to their houses--which, though in the towns, were\r\nreally farmhouses--and become manufacturers in a small way; while\r\nit was regularly the ambition of a trader or seaman to crown a\r\nsuccessful career by buying a farm, a ranch, or an orchard. There\r\nwas, accordingly, a very close connection between urban and agrarian\r\npursuits and interests.\r\n\r\nIt is true that with the Greek occupation of the coasts of the\r\nMediterranean and Black Seas in the seventh century B.C. some Greek\r\ntowns, like Miletus, Samos, Corinth, Ægina, Chalcis, and Eretria,\r\nbecame cities in the modern sense of the term, with commercial and\r\nindustrial interests predominant. But even there the advantages of\r\nurban life were within reach of the farmers, as well as of the traders,\r\nartisans, and merchants, since all alike were residents of the city.\r\nThe only difference was that life in those cities was more rich and\r\ndiversified than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between life in cities, with its complex social\r\norganization, its playhouses, its excitements, its stimuli to effort\r\nand to vice, its intolerance of oddities in manners and dress, and life\r\nin the country, with its simplicity which degenerates so easily into\r\nbrutality, its monotony, its fanaticism in the pursuit of wealth, its\r\ncontempt for the effeminacy of the shopkeeper, its piety and sobriety\r\nwhich easily accord with a longing to see the world and the wickedness\r\nthereof--this contrast which is so distressing an aspect of life in\r\nmodern America, was almost entirely absent in classic Greece, at least\r\namong the enfranchised part of the population.\r\n\r\nNone of the cities was so large as to shut off the view of the country.\r\nAfter only a few minutes' walk Socrates and his companions might escape\r\nfrom the noise and confusion of Athens into the cool and fragrant\r\ngroves of the suburbs. It was probably only into the biggest of the\r\nGreek cities that the olive trees and the grapevines did not push, as\r\nthey and the late-come orange and lemon orchards push into the modern\r\nGreek hamlets. Even in Athens the crowing of the cock sounded the\r\nreveille for almost everybody, and it would never have come into the\r\nmind of an Athenian to suggest, as has been done in Boston, that a zoo\r\nshould be stocked first with the common varieties of the domesticated\r\nanimals. There is, says a French writer, a flavor of the barnyard\r\nabout the comedies of Aristophanes. Yet this is the same Athens in\r\nwhich there were engaged in the building trades alone, according to\r\nPlutarch, carpenters, moulders, bronze-smiths, stone-cutters, dyers,\r\nveneerers in gold and ivory, painters, embroiderers, embossers,\r\nfactors, sailors, pilots, wagon-makers, trainers of yoked beasts,\r\ndrivers, rope-makers, weavers, cobblers, road-builders, and miners.\r\nThis, too, is the Athens into which, as an ancient Athenian wrote, were\r\nswept, because of its maritime empire, the choice things of Sicily and\r\nItaly, of Cyprus, and Egypt, and Lydia, of Pontus and Peloponnesus,\r\nand many another place besides. When the farmer lived side by side in\r\nAthens, the largest city in the whole Greek world, with the trader\r\nand the artisan, the fusion of town and country must have been still\r\nmore complete in the forty-three cities of Crete, the ten cities of\r\nEuboea, and the four cities of Ceos--an island only ten miles broad and\r\nfourteen long. This being the case, economic conditions tended to make\r\nthe citizens of each state homogeneous to a degree foreign in modern\r\nexperience; for, however rapid be its approach, the age has not yet\r\narrived in America in which the \"country is to be urbanized\"; in which,\r\nto speak with a recent essayist,[2] farming is to be \"of necessity\r\na specialized department of urban life\"; \"the task of agricultural\r\nproduction is to be taken over by the classes of modern industrial\r\norganization; by the capitalist, the manager and the laborer\"; in\r\nwhich \"there is to be a continual shifting of laborers of the poorer\r\nclasses back and forth between the town and the country,\" and \"the\r\ndistinction implied in the terms 'townsman' and 'countryman' is to be\r\nobliterated.\"\r\n\r\nWhether our essayist be right or wrong in his forecast of the future of\r\nfarming in America, we will not stop to discuss. It is enough to point\r\nout that the early age of Greece was such a one as he desiderates; that\r\nthen life was exclusively and uniformly urban: with the result that\r\nthe entire population of any given city-state could be regarded as\r\nmerely a great family. And it not only could be, but it was in fact so\r\nregarded. Were not all citizens descendants of a common ancestor? This\r\nquery aristocrats might answer in the negative, mindful of the special\r\ngod or demigod of whom each nobleman thought himself the offspring. But\r\nhis negative was generally qualified by the admission that he, too,\r\nif he were an Athenian, had Zeus and Apollo--Zeus of the home-stead\r\nand Apollo of the fatherland--as his progenitors; that he, too, like\r\nall his fellow-citizens, was a descendant of Ion and a foster-child of\r\nAthena. The gods and goddesses of the Greeks were their creators in the\r\nliteral physical sense of the word. Men projected backward, even to the\r\nage of the gods and heroes, with which the world began, the fact of\r\npaternity to which all animal origins were attributable; and since each\r\ncity had its peculiar demigods, from which its citizens were directly\r\nsprung, all its inhabitants were bound to one another by a peculiar tie\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\nThe family aspect of the Greek city is accentuated by the fact that the\r\ntown hall was a town hearth; that the chief subdivisions of citizens\r\nwere brotherhoods, and that all permanent associations of them for\r\npublic purposes assumed the descent of their several members from\r\ncommon ancestors, who were naturally gods or demigods. When heroes\r\nhad to be discovered, with the help of the Pythian prophetess, to act\r\nas progenitors for the groups of citizens artificially united in the\r\nnew electoral divisions which Clisthenes established in Athens in 508\r\nB.C., it is conceivable that popular regard for purity of stock helped\r\nPericles to enact the notorious law of 451 B.C. limiting citizenship at\r\nAthens to those sprung from the legitimate union of Athenian parents.\r\nEvery city in Greece inherited from its distant tribal past a strong\r\nfeeling of the kinship of its inhabitants, in comparison with which the\r\nsense of ethnic and racial unity was weak and watery. To destroy the\r\npolitical identity of a city was like taking human life.\r\n\r\nWe must make allowance, moreover, in appraising the strength of\r\nlocal attachments among both Greeks and Romans, for their beliefs as\r\nto the fate of the dead. The ancient world, like modern Japan, was\r\nsaturated with the idea that the spirits of departed ancestors needed\r\nthe ministrations of the living. Without the meat and drink which the\r\nrelatives brought to the grave; without the coins--or the articles of\r\nuse and pleasure which money might buy--that were buried with the body;\r\nwithout the covering of earth that was strewn over the dead, loved ones\r\nmight lack life altogether in the underworld, or might lack everything\r\nthat made the spirit life tolerable. \"The beasts of the field and the\r\nbirds of the air,\" rang the impassioned plea of Tiberius Gracchus[3]\r\nin introducing his agrarian reforms, \"have their holes and their\r\nhiding-places, but the men who fight and die for Italy enjoy but the\r\nblessings of light and air. Our generals urge their soldiers to fight\r\nfor the graves and the shrines of their ancestors. The appeal is idle\r\nand false. You cannot point to a paternal altar. You have no ancestral\r\ntomb. No! you fight and die to give wealth and luxury to others. You\r\nare called the masters of the world: yet there is no clod of earth that\r\nis really yours.\" Plutarch, with a touch which shows that despite his\r\nmodernity he belongs to the civilization which he interprets, tells us\r\nthat the Athenians before Salamis were disposed to count victory dear\r\nwhich was purchased by the desertion of the temples and the tombs of\r\ntheir fathers. No man who neglected the plot where his dead lay might\r\nhold the chief magistracies in Athens. The soil of his fatherland was\r\nthus in a peculiar sense holy ground to the citizen of a Greek city. He\r\nmight leave it, but not to an enemy; and if he were, like Æneas, the\r\nlast of his family, he was expected to carry his Lares and Penates\r\nwith him. Into a pit dug on the new site every companion of Romulus,\r\nwe are told in a legend which merely transfers into the past later-day\r\npractice, threw a morsel of earth brought from his old home land. This\r\nhe did not simply from an intensification of the feeling which led the\r\nScotch girl in the well-known ballad to take with her, when starting\r\nfor America, not baggage, but sods from her mother's grave. He did it\r\nfrom the sentiment which led General Nogi the other day to provide for\r\nthe spirits of his ancestors before committing suicide. Thereby the\r\ncolonist brought his dead along with him to the new city. The Greeks\r\nand the Romans had, accordingly, a very special reason for local\r\npatriotism. Like the Hebrew Christians, they were \"also compassed about\r\nwith so great a crowd of witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nWe have made our peace with economics by considering first the\r\neffect of occupation and residence in giving to the citizens of each\r\ncity-state solidarity of interest and attitude. We have dwelt a little\r\non the force which beliefs as to their origin and their destiny\r\nhereafter exerted in keeping the city-states apart. We have still to\r\nnotice the centrifugal influence on the Greek race of their urban\r\ninstitutions and politics.\r\n\r\nEach city in Greece had its own laws and customs. These were not, as\r\nwith us, cold abstractions, but real, ever active, almost living,\r\npersonal forces, moulding incessantly their subjects according to\r\na given model. The citizens of each city had, in fact, a general\r\nfamily resemblance, due to the imprint set upon them by their social\r\nand political institutions. Cities acquired by this means clear-cut\r\nindividualities which were capable of definition, not simply by\r\nnarrating their history, but also in terms of physical, intellectual,\r\nand emotional qualities. We may illustrate this point by observing\r\nthat the Hellenes created one literary type which we have not borrowed\r\nfrom them: they wrote the biographies of cities as well as of men.\r\nTheir philosophers studied the effects upon urban character of climate,\r\nprevailing winds and pursuits, location with reference to the sun and\r\nthe sea, contact with foreigners, and other similar agencies. They\r\neven had specifics which they prescribed for the physiological and\r\npathological ills of cities, just as our sciolists, on a much more\r\nslender basis of facts, however, diagnose the diseases and classify the\r\ngood and evil qualities of nations.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that cities meant to all the Greeks what (and much\r\nbesides) the city and the nation combined mean to those of us who do\r\nnot live in the country. They were the source and object at once of\r\nmunicipal and national pride. The problems which city-states had to\r\nconsider and solve were not simply those in which good citizens find it\r\nso hard nowadays to develop a wholesome interest. Questions of police,\r\neducation, public works, appointments; conflicts of racial, sectional,\r\nclass, and religious ambitions; rivalries with neighboring cities for\r\ncommercial, political, and cultural leadership--controversies of\r\nthis order are common to all cities in all times and places. But the\r\npolitics of the Greek cities had a high seriousness of their own. Each\r\ntown had its own foreign policy to determine, its own army to train\r\nand direct, its own church to equip with shrines and deities, its own\r\ngods to honor with games and tragedies. Every move on the complex\r\nchessboard of the Mediterranean world might be pregnant with meaning\r\nto it. On one day it might decide that the time had come to seize\r\nsome borderland in dispute with its immediate neighbors. On another\r\nit might conclude an alliance which imposed the obligation to wage a\r\ngreat war against frightful odds. On another the subject of voting\r\nmight be the recognition of a new god or goddess, which, in fact,\r\nwas often tantamount to a new creation. And in considering all these\r\nmatters citizens were simply doing what their fathers and forefathers\r\nhad done from time immemorial. Memories of great actions done in olden\r\ntimes were preserved by monuments of bronze or marble, and revived\r\nannually by appropriate ceremonies. Legend and fact, blended in an\r\nedifying tradition,--the repository of the yearnings and ideals of dead\r\ngenerations,--inspired the living to bear themselves worthily in all\r\nnational crises. \"Love thou thy land with love far-brought from out the\r\nstoried past\" was an admonition of which Greek cities of the classic\r\nepoch stood in little need. The mischief was that the land which they\r\nloved was not all Greece, but merely the territory of a single town.\r\n\r\nThe national fanaticism of the countries of modern Europe is probably\r\nmore tolerant of foreign interference than was the passionate\r\npatriotism of the little urban units with which the imperial policy of\r\nAthens and Sparta had to deal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you were to look at a map of Greece which distinguished the states,\r\nand not the meaningless ethnical or tribal divisions of the people,\r\nyou would observe that from the outset Sparta and Athens were destined\r\nto greatness, if by nothing else, by the size and material resources\r\nof their territories. They were, however, themselves city-states, and\r\ninferior to none in the strength with which they held to the conviction\r\nthat no greater humiliation could befall them than to have to submit to\r\nthe domination of another city or the will of a foreign lord. With what\r\nshow of reason, therefore, could they adopt a policy of imperialism?\r\nThey had to deal with Greeks, and not with barbarians. Hence they could\r\nnot invoke in the interest of their ambition the convenient doctrine\r\nthat inferior races need a political guardian.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the territory of Sparta we have included in it not simply\r\nthe land of the citizens which the serfs or Helots tilled for them,\r\nbut also the much larger, but less valuable, mass of enveloping land\r\nwhich belonged to the Periœcs; for the hamlets of the latter were\r\nreally Spartan municipalities. It was, moreover, with the resources of\r\nthe whole complex that Sparta held the Peloponnesians united under\r\nher leadership for one hundred and eighty years (550-370 B.C.). On the\r\nother hand, it was with the combined strength of the Peloponnesians\r\nthat Sparta broke up the Athenian empire in 405 B.C., and widened the\r\narea of her leadership so as to include all Hellas. Thereafter Sparta's\r\nPeloponnesian league was simply the core of a general Hellenic league.\r\nThe question is: What position did Sparta occupy in it?\r\n\r\nHer legal rights rested solely upon a treaty of alliance (_symmachia_)\r\nwhich she had struck with each city in the league. But there can be\r\nno doubt that she had often secured the treaty in the first place by\r\nforce, and that she interfered thereafter in the local affairs of both\r\nthe Peloponnesian and the other Hellenic allies in a way not provided\r\nby its stipulations. But, however outrageous her conduct might be in\r\nfact, it was never formally reprehensible so long as the interference\r\nachieved its object. This was to establish or maintain, first against\r\ntyranny, and later against democracy, an aristocratic government in the\r\nallied cities. Since the aristocrats were always in a minority, they\r\nwere bound to invite Spartan intervention for their own defense. Hence\r\nit was only when they failed to retain control of the government that\r\nan ally could regard Sparta's intermeddling as anything but the welcome\r\nact of a friendly power. \"Perhaps some one may expostulate,\" writes\r\na pamphleteer in 400 B.C. while commending to his fellow-citizens of\r\nLarisa a proposal that they join the Hellenic league;[4] \"but Sparta\r\nsets up an oligarchy everywhere. That is true. But it is such a one\r\nas we prayed and yearned for for ages, and lost when we had enjoyed\r\nit for but a brief moment. Just compare the oligarchy they favor with\r\nthe one we have already. Where is there a city in their domain, be it\r\never so small, in which a third of the population does not take part\r\nin public affairs? It is not by the Lacedæmonians, but by fortune,\r\nthat those who have no arms or other capacity for public service are\r\ndisfranchised. Their exclusion lasts only so long as their political\r\nworthlessness. How do we stand by comparison? It's my belief that were\r\nwe to pray for a constitution we would not ask the gods for a different\r\none from that which Sparta wishes.\" To even moderate men who thought as\r\nthis speaker did, unruly Spartan garrisons seemed quite compatible with\r\nlocal autonomy. They came to Larisa at the call of the home authorities\r\nand remained at the disposal of those who called them. Their captains,\r\nthe long-haired harmosts, took orders and did not give them. Their\r\npresence involved no suspension of the constitution, no violation of\r\nthe laws, no seizure of public revenues. Naturally, the two thirds\r\nwho were disfranchised thought differently; but it is a good rule\r\nof international law that a foreign state deal with the Government,\r\nand not with the Opposition. The, mischief of this system, in the\r\ncircumstances then existing in Greece, was that it bred civil war\r\nwithin the cities. \"War,\" says the Larisæan pamphleteer just quoted,\r\n\"is conceded to be the greatest of all evils by as much as peace is the\r\ngreatest of all blessings. Yet _stasis_, or civil war, as far exceeds\r\nwar in the magnitude of its evil as war exceeds peace.\" The incentive\r\nto stasis was that Athens, with a naval power as irresistible as was\r\nthe land power of Sparta, and an equally imposing array of allies,\r\nhad long continued to reach out a supporting or encouraging hand to\r\nthe two thirds whom Sparta tried to keep down. Athens, too, was the\r\napostle of a great political idea, \"the constitutional equality of the\r\nmany,\" and whenever she succeeded in putting those who believed in this\r\ncreed in control of an allied city, or in keeping them in control once\r\nthey had the advantage, her interference was formally justifiable or\r\nat least justified. Not she, but the government she upheld, had the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWith the outbreak of the great duel for national leadership between\r\nSparta and Athens which fills the final third of the fifth century\r\nB.C., the war was carried in the form of stasis into every city of\r\nthe two confederacies. For the leaders of both the one third and the\r\ntwo thirds, says Thucydides in a famous passage of his history of the\r\nPeloponnesian War[5] \"used specious names, the one professing to\r\nuphold the constitutional equality of the many, the other the wisdom\r\nof an aristocracy, while they made the public interests, to which in\r\nname they were devoted, in reality their prize. Striving in every way\r\nto overcome each other, they committed the most monstrous crimes;\r\nyet even these were surpassed by the magnitude of their revenges,\r\nwhich they pursued to the very utmost, neither party observing any\r\ndefinite limits either of justice or public expediency, but both alike\r\nmaking the caprice of the moment their law. Either by the help of an\r\nunrighteous sentence, or grasping power with the strong hand, they were\r\neager to satiate the impatience of party spirit. Neither faction cared\r\nfor religion; but any fair pretence which succeeded in effecting some\r\nodious purpose was greatly lauded. And the citizens who were of neither\r\nparty fell a prey to both; either they were disliked because they held\r\naloof, or men were jealous of their surviving. Thus stasis gave birth\r\nto every form of wickedness in Greece.\" The singleness of purpose with\r\nwhich Sparta made vocational training the aim of her public education\r\nachieved the happy result that she had no men of letters to betray\r\nto posterity damaging secrets of state. Hence no one has done for\r\nher what Thucydides has done for Athens: let us have an insight into\r\nthe conscience of the city at the time of its greatness. With brutal\r\ncandor Cleon and others in Thucydides' narrative brush aside the formal\r\njustification of the Athenian empire and lay bare the fact that it was\r\nin reality a tyranny, a sovereignty exercised without a moral sanction,\r\none which self-respecting people had a solemn duty to overthrow. \"You\r\nshould remember,\" said Cleon to the Athenians in 427 B.C.,[6] \"that\r\nyour empire is a despotism exercised over unwilling subjects who are\r\nalways conspiring against you; they do not obey in return for any\r\nkindness which you do them to your own injury, but in so far as you are\r\ntheir mistress; they have no love of you, but they are held down by\r\nforce.\"\r\n\r\nDependence upon Sparta or Athens was, in fact, regarded by none\r\nof their allies except as the less of two evils: the greater was\r\ndependence upon their domestic foes. Hence the tyranny just described\r\ndid not arise with the consent of the tyrannized. The allies of Athens\r\nhad consented to enter only into alliance (symmachia) with her on\r\nstipulated terms and for a stipulated purpose--protection against\r\nPersia. What they had neglected to stipulate was the time for which\r\nthey were to remain allies. Athens, accordingly, denied them the right\r\nto secede, and when particular cities tried none the less to withdraw,\r\nshe made the preservation of the union a moral ground for coercion,\r\nand with the aid of such cities as remained faithful, and the fleet\r\nwhich she kept ready for action by the financial contributions of\r\nall, she forced them back on terms such as a conqueror could dictate.\r\nA new treaty of alliance was, however, the future, as it had been\r\nthe ancient, tie. And speaking broadly, we may affirm that in the\r\ncity-state world of classic Greece an empire was legally impossible:\r\nwhat we, and the ancients, looking to realities, call an empire was an\r\naggregate knit together by treaties, the very formation of which shows\r\nthat we have to do, not with a single sovereign, but with a group of\r\nsovereigns. In other words, the city remained the ultimate political\r\nunit. The rule of Athens and Sparta was, strictly speaking, an hegemony\r\nand not an _arche_; a shifting and temporary leadership, and not a\r\npermanent suzerainty. It was a necessity of circumstances assumed to be\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, experience showed that the circumstances in which\r\nimperialism was a political necessity recurred constantly. After the\r\nfall of Athens in 404 B.C., a defensive war against the barbarians--the\r\nMacedonians in Thessaly, the Persians in Ionia--served as a\r\njustification to Sparta in employing force to maintain the hegemony\r\nwhich she had won. But in 387 B.C. the peace known as the \"King's\r\nPeace,\" or the \"Peace of Antalcidas,\" was concluded with Persia,\r\nwhereupon it became impossible to use any longer the national cause as\r\neven a pretext for tyranny. The hegemony, however, was not abandoned.\r\nIt had to be maintained, it was alleged, to keep the other cities free,\r\nand to this end Persia lent aid to Sparta and Thebes successively. If\r\nan empire could only be prevented by an empire, and national recreancy\r\nto boot, the times were surely out of joint. Such an issue was the\r\n_reductio ad absurdum_ of the system of hegemonies, as both reformers\r\nand statesmen in Greece came speedily to realize.\r\n\r\nThe reformers strove to alter the untoward circumstances, and in a\r\nlater chapter we shall have occasion to note how Plato and Aristotle,\r\nwith a blind faith in the power of education and of legislation, aimed\r\nto divert citizens from work to leisure and from war to peace, and\r\nboth to eradicate the greed for land and money and to restrict the\r\nnatural increase of population to which they traced the imperialistic\r\nspirit. Some of the statesmen followed their lead. Others, however,\r\nconceding that unity was demanded for the preservation and spread of\r\ncivilization, and that the world needed not fewer but more Greeks,\r\neither, like the great publicist Isocrates, advocated an hegemony on\r\nthe old lines but endowed with stability through being based on general\r\nconsent, or favored one of several new devices for welding cities into\r\na permanent territorial state. Respect for progress bids us to view at\r\nthis point somewhat narrowly these unitarian movements.\r\n\r\nThe position attained by Thebes in Greece after her victory over Sparta\r\nat Leuctra in 371 B.C. was simply an hegemony of the earlier model--the\r\nreoccupation of lines proved twice already to be untenable.[7] On the\r\nother hand, the position occupied by Thebes in Boeotia prior to 387\r\nB.C. was clearly anticipatory of what the future was to bring to Greece\r\nas a whole. Boeotia was thereby blocked off into six districts,[8] one\r\n(Thebes) with four electoral divisions, two (Orchomenus and Thespiæ)\r\nwith two each, and three with one apiece. Six of the ten city-states of\r\nBoeotia--the six little lake cities--were confined to two of the eleven\r\ndivisions. This was a setback to them and a boon to Thebes, seeing that\r\neach division furnished one of the eleven Boeotarchs who formed the\r\nexecutive of the league, sixty of the six hundred and sixty councillors\r\nwho formed the Boeotian synod, and its corresponding share of the\r\nleague judges. Thebes thus became the Prussia of Boeotia, and in return\r\nfor the political advantages which it gained and four elevenths of the\r\nrevenues which it received, it undertook to provide four elevenths of\r\nthe soldiers and four elevenths of the taxes. In this way the burdens\r\nand the advantages of the league were distributed according to the\r\npopulation and wealth of the different parts of the country. That was\r\nequitable; and since the city-states, though thrust into the background\r\nand held responsible for decisions in the making of which they had\r\noften little influence, formed a single _ethnos_ and spoke a single\r\ndialect, they were evidently fairly well satisfied. As the league was\r\nconstituted, Thebes was forced to struggle with Orchomenus and Thespiæ\r\nfor the control of the six little lake cities. In this she was normally\r\nsuccessful--so successful, in fact, that in 387 B.C. Sparta, while\r\nenforcing the King's Peace, dissolved the league in order to destroy\r\nher influence. It was not revived when Thebes reunited Boeotia (377-371\r\nB.C.), and under Epaminondas we may more properly speak of Boeotia as a\r\nsingle city-state like Attica than as a league of city-states.\r\n\r\nThough sacrificed at home to the ambition of Thebes, the Boeotian\r\nleague maintained a high prestige abroad. Some of its institutions\r\nhad been transferred to Athens during the revolution of 411 B.C., and\r\nothers had been adopted in Arcadia after they had been set aside in\r\nBoeotia. Moreover, and this is an important historical connection which\r\nthe wonderful epigraphical researches of Adolph Wilhelm[9] enable us\r\nto establish, the Boeotian league reappears _mutatis mutandis_ in the\r\norganization imposed upon all Greece by Philip of Macedon after his\r\ncrowning victory at Chæronea in 338 B.C. For if we equate Philip and\r\nthe Committee of Public Safety with the eleven Boeotarchs, the synod\r\nof Corinth with the Boeotian synod of six hundred and sixty, and the\r\ndistricts into which Hellas, including Macedon and excluding only\r\nSparta, was divided for federal purposes, with the six districts which\r\nhad existed in Boeotia, it is evident that the political system used\r\nby Philip for organizing the Greeks was borrowed from Boeotia no less\r\nthan the military system with which he conquered them. It was not for\r\nnothing that the king of Macedon had spent his youth as a hostage in\r\nThebes.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic of the Boeotian league and of Philip's Hellenic league\r\nis the synod. It was in each a strictly representative body. Its\r\nmembers were apportioned to the area constituting the league in such a\r\nway that the larger states had several representatives and the smaller\r\nstates had one representative between them; while in the Hellenic\r\nleague neighboring states and federated states were treated as a unit\r\nand given proportional representation. That this made all but the\r\nlargest state--Macedon--the largest state's inferiors and subordinated\r\nmany city-states to the federal districts to which they belonged,\r\nis obvious. And in this case loss of local liberty was compensated\r\nfor very imperfectly by the consideration that what the constituent\r\nstates surrendered the Hellenic synod, which met at Corinth, gained.\r\nThe national appeal was far weaker than the ethnic appeal had been in\r\nBoeotia. The liberty lost had indeed been a bane and not a blessing.\r\nAfter 338 B.C. the cities could no longer enjoy the excitement of\r\nwaging private wars and fomenting revolutions. No longer were they free\r\nto be enemies of Philip. Henceforth they must contribute the quota of\r\nhorsemen, hoplites, light-armed troops, and sailors for which their\r\nrepresentation in the synod obligated them, or pay a heavy fine for\r\nevery day their contingents were absent from the national levy. The\r\nsynod completed its organization by choosing Philip its _hegemon_\r\nby land and sea, and selected as its executive board a Committee of\r\nPublic Safety which seemingly had its sessions at Pydna. The committee\r\nthe confederates probably welcomed as a possible champion of their\r\ninterests. The unwelcome organ of the league, and the one for which\r\nthere was no parallel in Boeotia, was the hegemon. Subordination to\r\na synod was offensive enough to city-states which regarded complete\r\nindependence as alone ideal. It was intolerable to them to submit to\r\na synod which its hegemon, Philip of Macedon, controlled,--one which\r\ncould never have any one but the contemporary king of Macedon as its\r\nhegemon. The hegemony of Macedon was sugar-coated, but it was none the\r\nless an hegemony, and, as such, illegal and unacceptable.[10]\r\n\r\nA notable start in the direction of uniting city-states legally in a\r\nlarger whole had been made by Athens during the epoch of her empire.\r\nShe had then founded many colonies (_cleruchies_), which, though\r\norganized as separate cities, retained for their residents citizenship\r\nin Athens. Why not grant citizenship (_polity_) to the inhabitants of\r\nother cities as well? There were some, and among them the comedian\r\nAristophanes,[11] who canvassed this idea. \"Let us assume,\" he says,\r\n\"that our city is a heap of wool, and that each of our allied cities\r\nis a fleck of wool. Let us take all the wool and spin it into yarn,\r\nand weave the yarn into a great blanket with which to protect our lord\r\nDemos against the cold.\" But for this drastic measure the times were\r\nnot ripe. It was altogether repugnant to the pride of the Athenians\r\nto share with everybody advantages which they had sacrificed so much\r\nto acquire; and there was little in the advantages thus diluted to\r\ncompensate other cities for the at least partial loss of identity\r\nwhich they were bound to sustain on acquiring Athenian citizenship.\r\nIn the one instance in which this course was taken, the Samians, to\r\nwhom Athens gave her full civic rights in the supreme agony of the\r\nPeloponnesian War, had both earned them and come to appreciate them by\r\nsacrificing their own territory rather than desert their ally.\r\n\r\nAnother less heroic expedient for bringing about a permanent _entente_\r\nbetween cities was the grant of _isopolity_, or reciprocity of\r\ncitizenship. In certain cases this was the concession of the passive\r\nrights of citizenship (_civitas sine suffragio_) to all citizens of a\r\nparticular city who should take up residence in, or even merely visit,\r\nthe territory of the grantor. Thus circumscribed, however, it amounted\r\nsimply to an exchange of commercial privileges, and proved barren of\r\npolitical consequences in that each city reserved to itself complete\r\ncontrol of its own policy, thus rendering impossible any advance in\r\nstate building. It remained for the Romans to render this institution\r\nfruitful to an astonishing degree by making the legal exercise of Roman\r\ncitizenship independent of migration to Rome.\r\n\r\nSubstantially the same result was achieved by the Greeks through what\r\nthey termed _sympolity_, or joint citizenship. This was possessed from\r\nof old by rudimentary nations, like the Achæans and the Ætolians,[12]\r\namong whom the towns and hamlets had never become independent and\r\nself-sufficient political units; so that the inhabitants were Achæans\r\nfrom Ægium, or Achæans from Cerynia, or Achæans from some other\r\nof the ten so-called cities of which the Achæan nation or league\r\nwas constituted. In like fashion the Ætolian hamlets had a double\r\ncitizenship. An essential part of this scheme, evidently, was that each\r\ncity had an equal voice in the election of the officials of the league\r\nand in the settlement of all federal matters. And so satisfactory a\r\nsafeguard of urban autonomy did this prove to be that in the last half\r\nof the third century B.C. city after city in the Peloponnesus outside\r\nthe ancient limits of Achæa took the irrevocable step of acquiring\r\nAchæan citizenship in addition to its own; while in Central Greece\r\nthe Ætolians by fair means or foul bestowed a dual citizenship upon\r\nall their neighbors. Athens and Sparta alone persisted in their\r\nisolation, the former on the strength of an international guarantee\r\nof autonomy, the latter in stubborn reliance upon its own powers.\r\nThe other city-states entrusted to an international board, not for a\r\ndefinite or indefinite term of years, but for all future time, complete\r\ncontrol of their foreign relations. Each city put permanently the\r\ninternational authority between itself and the outside world, thus\r\nescaping individual danger by the surrender of individual diplomacy.[13]\r\n\r\nIn this way arose what by the general consent of historians and jurists\r\nis the most perfect state which antiquity produced. The antinomy\r\nbetween the city-state and the imperial spirit which had existed for\r\ncenturies was reduced to a minimum by the nice balance of the federal\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThere were defects in the Achæan and Ætolian leagues which their\r\nstatesmen did not remove. \"Equality,\" says Aristotle, \"is just, but\r\nonly between equals.\" The cities which had an equal voice in the\r\ninternational board, like the modern nations which cast a vote each at\r\nthe Hague Congress, were unequal in population and in wealth.\r\n\r\nThe Achæans and Ætolians came nearer than any ancient republicans to\r\nentrusting power to representatives; but, besides creating a large\r\nlegislative council, constituted in successive years, in the one case,\r\nof different fractions of the citizens of each city, and in the\r\nother, of deputies apportioned to the constituent cities according\r\nto their size, they showed the ingrained distrust held by all Greeks\r\nfor oligarchy by requiring the reference to a general assembly of all\r\nmatters of high importance.\r\n\r\nHow to satisfy the just claims of those whom distance or lack of\r\nleisure prevented from coming to the meeting-place, they did not\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not these institutional imperfections which prevented\r\nthe unification of Hellas in a single federation. For this result\r\ncould not now be achieved by any triumph of political science.\r\nAntigonus Doson (229-221 B.C.) whose name ought not to be unknown where\r\nCallicratidas, Agesilaus, Iphicrates, and Phocion are household words,\r\nattempted with equal skill and generosity to combine the new federal\r\nidea with the old idea of a representative national congress meeting\r\nat Corinth under the hegemony of the king of Macedon;[14] but the best\r\nthat can be said of the combination he made is that despite its great\r\npromise and possibilities it proved unacceptable to Hellas, and hence\r\nineffective.[15] The situation had now got beyond the control of the\r\nGreek people. It may, perhaps, be realized best, if we imagine that\r\nthe European nations of to-day, weakened politically by continuous\r\nemigration and incessant conflicts, economically, by the withdrawal\r\nof industry and commerce to more favorably situated districts\r\nunder European control, let us say in the East, were to pool their\r\ndiplomatic and military interests, and entrust them, not to a European\r\nparliament, but to warring Latin and Teutonic parliaments, and were to\r\ntake this step only to escape the Russian peril and when America was\r\nalready thundering at their shores, if that be imaginable, coming with\r\nirresistible might, at once to save and to destroy.\r\n\r\nTo describe how the Roman republic emancipated Greece from Macedon,\r\nimpressed her will upon the Greek kingdoms of the East, and built\r\nup a universal empire of diverse fragments, lies beyond the scope\r\nof this book. We may note simply that to some cities she gave her\r\ncitizenship, or polity, thus destroying their identity altogether; that\r\nto others she gave isopolity, or reciprocity of citizenship, and with\r\nit the local advantages preserved in Greece by sympolity, or joint\r\ncitizenship, thus creating the municipality and organizing wards, so to\r\nspeak, of the city of Rome all over Italy; that some (the _socii_, or\r\nItalian allies) she bound to herself by irrevocable treaties till she\r\nwas forced to give them municipal status, and others (the \"friends,\"\r\n_amici_, or the \"friends and allies,\" _amici et socii_, in what later\r\nbecame the provinces) by understandings or temporary treaties till she\r\nhad familiarized herself with deification of rulers, which was the\r\nGreek method of legalizing absolutism.\r\n\r\nA word on this strange institution and I have finished this survey of\r\nthe expedients devised by the Greeks to obscure, evade, and finally\r\nto justify imperialism. The Greek method of legalizing despotism was\r\nAlexander the Great's genial adaptation to state building of an idea\r\nwhich his tutor, Aristotle, had developed in his _Politics_.[16] It was\r\na means of uniting cities or provinces in an indissoluble whole while\r\npreserving, on the one hand, the superiority and freedom of action of\r\nthe suzerain, be it an emperor or a republic, and, on the other hand,\r\nthe self-respect of the inferior states, without which their status\r\nwas politically intolerable. Deification of rulers did the impossible:\r\nit reconciled completely the antinomy between the city-state and\r\nimperialism. It resolved the antagonism into two harmonious duties; the\r\nduty of the ruler to command and of the subject to obey.\r\n\r\nTo Alexander the Great governments have been in serious debt for over\r\ntwo thousand years. From him to Kaiser Wilhelm II runs an unbroken\r\nline. So long as the world had many gods and did not believe in the\r\nsupernatural power of any of them, there was no religious difficulty\r\nin adding to its stock another such deity in the person of the living\r\nmonarch. With the decadence of polytheism, however, a slight change was\r\nnecessary. In Constantine's time god-kings suffered the same fate as\r\nother pagan gods; but with a difference. The heathen gods became devils\r\nor were metamorphosed into saints.\r\n\r\nThe kings became men chosen for their high office by God, Most High.\r\nCrowned, usually by their predecessors, and anointed by God's priests,\r\nthe patriarchs, they governed by divine right and acknowledged\r\nresponsibility only to their Creator.[17] In a less ecclesiastical\r\nworld, as in modern Prussia, the kings crown themselves. But with these\r\nlater developments we have no concern in this book. I shall endeavor,\r\nhowever, in chapters III-VI, to trace the growth of deification in the\r\nworld-monarchy of Alexander the Great, and to make clear the purpose it\r\nserved in the empires of the Ptolemies and Seleucids.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n 1. de Coulanges, Fustel. _La cité antique_^7 (1879).\r\n\r\n 2.

Even this country, which is dedicated, as\r\nis no other of the modern great powers, to the concept of popular\r\nsovereignty; which uprears the structure of its state upon a belief in\r\nthe essential equality of men, and treats, or at least aims to treat,\r\nas comparatively negligible the differences created by birth and race,\r\neducation and religion, property and occupation;-even this idealistic\r\nrepublic has become an empire in our own time and almost without our\r\nperceiving it. M. Bouché-Leclercq has given a prominent place in his\r\n_Leçons d'histoire romaine_[18] to the discomforting doctrine that\r\nthe Romans conquered the world in spite of themselves--a debatable\r\nquestion, as he himself shows. It is not our sense of truth that is\r\ngratified when we are told that the beatitude, \"Blessed are the meek,\r\nfor they shall inherit the earth,\" designates the English. Yet Seeley\r\nhas maintained the thesis that the British empire was secured in a\r\n\"prolonged fit of national absence of mind.\" Unwittingly, it seems, the\r\nmodern foster-mother of liberal institutions has become the mistress of\r\ncountless millions.\r\n\r\nThere never was a people which made the principle that all its citizens\r\nwere equal a more live reality than the Athenians made it; and no state\r\nto my knowledge was more cunningly contrived to insure the government\r\nof the people than was theirs. Yet they became imperialists with ardor\r\nand conviction, and with this much of logical consequence, that, while\r\nthey believed in democracy for everybody, they did not doubt that the\r\nAthenians had earned the right to rule both Greeks and barbarians by\r\nthe acquisition of superior culture. Equality among its citizens Athens\r\ncarefully distinguished from equality among all men.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of Athenian democracy and empire were laid by\r\nThemistocles, whose figure moves weird and gigantic through the golden\r\nmist in which Herodotus has enveloped the great Persian War. And it\r\nwas this genial statesman, to whose unerring skill in discerning the\r\ncourse of coming events the austere historian Thucydides pays a rare\r\ntribute, who mapped out for his city the foreign policy by which it\r\nhad the best chance of realizing its imperial ambition. Let it use its\r\ngreat fleet, which by fifteen years of persistent advocacy he had led\r\nthe Athenians to build, as its arm of offense, and its impregnable\r\nwalls, which he had enabled the Athenians to construct despite the\r\ntreacherous opposition of Sparta, as a bulwark of defense and a basis\r\nfor timely advance against its powerful continental rivals. Let it\r\nutilize the wave of democratic fervor then sweeping through Greece to\r\nconsolidate its power within the Confederacy of Delos and to undermine\r\nand eventually to overthrow the leadership which Sparta, by the support\r\nof dying mediæval aristocracies, had hitherto possessed in Hellenic\r\naffairs. Let it make peace on advantageous terms with Persia; use the\r\nliberty thus secured to break the power of Sparta, and, on the basis of\r\na consolidated Hellas, strike boldly for Athenian dominion of the world.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost incredible that a clear-headed man should have\r\nentertained a programme of such magnitude. But we must remember that\r\nnever had human beings more clearly performed the obviously miraculous.\r\n_We_ know, on the authority of a German military expert,[19] that, had\r\nthe host which followed Xerxes to Athens numbered the 5,283,220 men\r\nattributed to it by Herodotus \"without taking count of women cooks,\r\nconcubines, eunuchs, beasts of burden, cattle, and Indian dogs,\" its\r\nrear guard must have been still filing out of Sardis while its van was\r\nvainly storming Thermopylæ. But what Herodotus reports is what the\r\nAthenians believed. They had met and routed the might of all Asia. They\r\nhad mastered in fair fight the conquerors of all other peoples. The\r\nworld was theirs: it was merely a question of taking possession.\r\n\r\nThemistocles had, accordingly, to reckon with a national\r\nself-confidence which knew no bounds. And this had been increased by\r\nfamous victories of Cimon over the Persians, and a revolt of the Helots\r\nwhich disclosed the fatal weakness of Sparta, when in 461 B.C. the\r\ntask of conducting the fierce current of national energy, first for\r\nfifteen years (461-446 B.C.) in a heroic, but fruitless, struggle by\r\nsea and land against the Greeks and Persians simultaneously, and then\r\nfor fifteen further years (446-431 B.C.) in the prosecution of glorious\r\nworks of peace, fell upon the broad shoulders of Pericles, Xanthippus's\r\nson.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded that there is no taskmaster so ruthless as one's own\r\nwill. The impulse to action during this strenuous epoch came from\r\nthe Athenian people itself, not from its chief statesman. That fact\r\ndoes not, however, diminish the credit of Pericles. The golden age\r\nof Greece is, properly speaking, a golden age of Athens, and to its\r\nbirth many things contributed; but decisive among them, in addition to\r\nthe intensity of national life already alluded to, was an unrivaled\r\nfacility for great leaders to get into effective contact with the\r\nmasses under conditions in which there was the fullest opportunity for\r\nmen in general to use their natural powers to the utmost. This happy\r\ncombination of creative genius and receptive multitude arose in the\r\nmain from the democratic institutions of Athens; but, for the public\r\nand private wealth without which Athenian democracy proved unworkable,\r\nand for the imaginative stimulus which enterprises of great pitch and\r\nmoment alone give, the possession of empire was, perhaps, essential.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the age of Pericles, Athens was a city with a population of about\r\n150,000. Attica, the territory of the Athenians, had an approximately\r\nequal number of inhabitants. Of the 300,000 thus accounted for, about\r\none third was servile and one sixth foreign. The free and franchised\r\npopulation made up one half of the total, and yielded about 50,000\r\nmales of military age.\r\n\r\nThe empire of the Athenians consisted of five provinces, the Thracian,\r\nHellespontine, Insular, Ionian, and Carian, with a total population\r\nof perhaps, 2,000,000. It formed a complex of islands, peninsulas,\r\nand estuaries, the most remote extremities of which were distant two\r\nhundred or two hundred and fifty miles from Athens. The highways of\r\nthis empire were the land-locked channels and lakes which make up the\r\nÆgean Archipelago. Their greatest length in normal circumstances was\r\na continuous voyage of about eight days. On the other hand, no land\r\nway of more than a single day's march need be traversed by an Athenian\r\nexpedition aimed at any of its subject cities. Without the control\r\nof the sea the empire was, accordingly, unthinkable. This absent,\r\nthe district fell at once into more than four hundred fragments, the\r\nthousand \"cities\" from which, according to the comedian Aristophanes,\r\nthe Athenians gathered tribute.\r\n\r\nThe Athenian sphere of naval operations and of political and commercial\r\ninterests reached far beyond the frontiers of the empire. It included\r\npoints like Sicily, Egypt, Phoenicia, and the Euxine, distant over six\r\nhundred miles from the Piræus. An Athenian fleet might thus require the\r\nbest part of a month to reach its destination. The world which had to\r\ntake careful account of the Athenian naval power in all its political\r\nand military calculations, the world which Athens under Pericles sought\r\nto dominate, must have had a population of over 20,000,000.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we take into account the ratio of dominant, subject, and\r\nforeign elements, and also the time consumed in reaching with ships,\r\norders, or explanations, the outer limits of authority, the magnitude\r\nof Athens's imperial undertaking will stand comparison with that of\r\nEngland in modern times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Sparta the gravestone of a citizen was inscribed regularly with his\r\nname alone. No epitaph was needed there to tell the tale of a life; for\r\nthe life of one citizen was the well-known life of all. If, however, a\r\nman had died for his country, two words, ἑνπολἑμω, \"in war,\" expressed\r\nwith laconic brevity his ground of distinction.\r\n\r\nFor those who fell in battle Athens set apart a public cemetery near\r\nthe Dipylon Gate, and at the end of every campaign a commemorative\r\nservice was held there in honor of the year's crop of martyrs. A\r\nman high in public esteem voiced the nation's gratitude for the\r\nsacrifice. On such an occasion, at the end of the first year of the\r\nPeloponnesian War, Pericles reversed the normal procedure, and, instead\r\nof expatiating on the merits of the fallen, he explained in an eloquent\r\nspeech why Athens was worthy of loyalty unto death. Thucydides heard\r\nhis words, and, perhaps many years afterwards, reproduced them as best\r\nhe could in the famous _Funeral Oration_.\r\n\r\nThe statesman did not linger long over the legendary glories of Athens.\r\nHer alleged boons to humanity--grain, the norms of civilized life, the\r\ndrama; the services, that is to say, upon which the later Athenians\r\ndwelt with special pride--had no meaning for him. Two things their\r\nancestors had done: they had defended their country successfully,\r\nand had transmitted to their descendants a free state. \"And if these\r\nwere worthy of praise,\"[20] proceeds his splendid exordium, \"still\r\nmore were our fathers, who added to their inheritance, and after\r\nmany a struggle transmitted to us their sons this great empire. And\r\nwe ourselves assembled here to-day, who are still most of us in the\r\nvigor of life, have chiefly done the work of improvement, and have\r\nrichly endowed our city with all things, so that she is sufficient for\r\nherself both in peace and war. Of the military exploits by which our\r\nvarious possessions were acquired, or of the energy with which we or\r\nour fathers drove back the tide of war, Hellenic or Barbarian, I will\r\nnot speak; for the tale would be long and is familiar to you. But ... I\r\nshould like to point out by what principles of action we rose to power,\r\nand under what institutions and through what manner of life our empire\r\nbecame great.\"\r\n\r\nIn these words of Pericles I should like you to find stated the theme\r\nof my second chapter. And were it not that Pericles left unexplained,\r\nwhat the Athenians whom he addressed knew without explanation, the\r\nsocial and political forms by which they realized their ideals, I might\r\nabsolve my task by one long quotation. I might transcribe the whole\r\n_Oration_ and have done with it.\r\n\r\nThat being inexpedient, I cannot do better than present, using again\r\nPericles's own words as a sort of text, the main principles of Athenian\r\npolicy. But in passing I may be permitted to observe that were our\r\nknowledge of Athens dependent solely upon the _Funeral Oration_; had we\r\nto form our idea of political life in fifth-century B.C. Greece from it\r\nalone, we might still infer a unique epoch in the history of mankind.\r\nFortunately, that is not the case. The \"tooth of time and razure of\r\noblivion\" have spared the Parthenon and its matchless sculptures, the\r\nnoble tragedies of Æschylus and Sophocles, and the undying charm of\r\nHerodotus. Ideals are always grounded in some measure in realities. At\r\nthe least they stand to them as the \"perfect round\" to the \"broken\r\narc.\" Even in Plato's psychology the mind needs to be sharpened by\r\nobservation and reflection before, as in a flash of light, the glimpse\r\nof the divine idea suddenly appears. Hence, were the affirmations of\r\nthe _Funeral Oration_ unsupported by contemporary monuments of similar\r\nspirit, they would still be helpful revelations of Athenian democracy.\r\nAnd this conclusion, as I hope to show, rests not upon logical\r\ninference alone, but also upon the evidence of minute research.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Pericles,[21] \"we are called a democracy, for the\r\nadministration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But\r\nwhile the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private\r\ndisputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized, and when a\r\ncitizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public\r\nservice, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit.\r\nNeither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefit his country whatever be\r\nthe obscurity of his condition. There is no exclusiveness in our public\r\nlife, and in our private intercourse we are not suspicious of one\r\nanother, nor angry with our neighbor if he does what he likes; we do\r\nnot put on sour looks at him which, though harmless, are not pleasant.\r\nWhile we are thus unconstrained in our private intercourse, a spirit\r\nof reverence pervades our public acts; we are prevented from doing\r\nwrong by respect for authority and for the laws, having an especial\r\nregard to those ordained for the protection of the injured as well as\r\nto those unwritten laws which bring upon the transgressor of them the\r\nreprobation of the general sentiment.... Wealth we employ not for talk\r\nand ostentation, but when there is a real use for it. To avow poverty\r\nwith us is no disgrace: the true disgrace is in doing nothing to avoid\r\nit. An Athenian citizen does not neglect the state because he takes\r\ncare of his own household; and even those of us who are engaged in\r\nbusiness have a very fair idea of politics. We alone regard a man who\r\ntakes no interest in public affairs, not as a harmless but as a useless\r\ncharacter; and if few of us are originators, we are all sound judges\r\nof a policy. The great impediment to action is, in our opinion, not\r\ndiscussion but the want of that knowledge which is gained by discussion\r\npreparatory to action. For we have a peculiar power of thinking before\r\nwe act and of acting too.... And we have not forgotten to provide for\r\nour weary spirits many relaxations from toil; we have regular games\r\nand sacrifices throughout the year; at home the style of our life is\r\nrefined; and the delight which we daily feel in all these things helps\r\nto banish melancholy. Because of the greatness of our city the fruits\r\nof the whole earth flow in upon us; so that we enjoy the goods of other\r\ncountries as freely as of our own.... We are lovers of the beautiful,\r\nyet simple in our tastes, and we cultivate the mind without loss of\r\nmanliness.... To sum up: I say that Athens is the school of Hellas,\r\nand that the individual Athenian in his own person seems to have the\r\npower of adapting himself to the most varied forms of action with the\r\nutmost versatility and grace. This is no passing and idle word, but\r\ntruth and fact; and the assertion is verified by the position to which\r\nthese qualities have raised the state.... And we shall assuredly not\r\nbe without witnesses; there are mighty monuments of our power which\r\nwill make us the wonder of this and of succeeding ages; we shall not\r\nneed the praises of Homer or of any other panegyrist whose poetry may\r\nplease for the moment, although his representation of the facts will\r\nnot bear the light of day. For we have compelled every land and every\r\nsea to open a path for our valor, and have everywhere planted eternal\r\nmemorials of our friendship and of our enmity.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch were the proud claims of the great Athenian statesman. Of art\r\nthere was said no word except in so far as art was embodied in the\r\nmonuments of empire. Music and the drama are alluded to, but in the\r\nsame breath with athletic contests, as the relaxation of overworked\r\nmen. The speaker has no apology to make for democracy. He gloried in\r\nimperialism. Had he met Plato in Elysium--Plato who was born in the\r\nyear after Pericles's death, and both embodied and expressed the higher\r\nideals of a later generation of Athenians--he would have disdained to\r\nreply to the philosopher's accusation that he had filled the city with\r\ntraders and shops and ships and dockyards and such rubbish, instead of\r\nwith righteousness and justice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTaking the _Funeral Oration_ as my text, I should like to explain at\r\nthis point by what institutions the principles of Periclean democracy\r\nand imperialism were converted into facts.\r\n\r\nIt was in the _ecclesia_, or general assembly, and in the _heliæa_,\r\nor popular courts of justice, that sovereign power was vested in\r\nAthens.[22] The heliæa demanded of its jurors only that they should\r\nbe citizens in good standing, but each year it drew according to need\r\nfrom a specially constituted list of 6000. So, too, of the 50,000\r\ncitizens who might attend the ecclesia, 6000 were regarded as a quorum\r\nwhen a quorum was required, and commonly an even smaller number was\r\npresent. Meetings of the ecclesia were held either in the city or at\r\nthe harbor; hence the urban element tended to dominate. Stated meetings\r\noccurred four times a month, but others might be called by the generals\r\nor the council. Various panels of from 401 to 2001 jurymen each might\r\nbe allotted to tribunals on every day of the year which was not set\r\naside for a public festival or preëmpted by a meeting of the ecclesia.\r\nUsually poor men of advanced years, such as were unsuited for more\r\nactive work and were satisfied with the indemnity of two obols[23] per\r\nday, volunteered for registration among the 6000 jurors.\r\n\r\nThe work of Parliament was divided between the ecclesia and the heliæa;\r\nfor legislation in the strict sense of the term could be enacted only\r\nby the joint action of the two bodies.[24] Administrative decrees,\r\nmoreover, by means of which the ecclesia disposed of all important\r\npublic business, and which might differ from laws only in a formal\r\nway, could be suspended at the initiative of individuals and were\r\nincontestable only when passed on, as to constitutionality or public\r\nexpediency, by the heliæa. The men who sat in the heliæa were but\r\ncommon citizens like those who voted in the ecclesia; but they came to\r\nsit in judgment on both laws and decrees by the accident of the lot\r\nand not because of any particular interest in the questions concerned.\r\nIn other words, the courts could not be packed with partisans as the\r\nmeetings of the ecclesia commonly were. This fact, together with the\r\ndelay which necessarily occurred, protected the state against the\r\nverdict of a chance majority, which was in fact usually a minority\r\nof all the citizens. There was no such thing in Athens as the final\r\nsettlement of controversial matters by a single popular vote.\r\n\r\nThe heliæa acted as sovereign in one further particular. Upon it\r\ndevolved the duty of determining whether the magistrates and\r\ncouncilors observed the laws and conducted themselves honestly during\r\ntheir years of office. It was to the sworn assembly of the Athenians,\r\naccordingly, that all those engaged in civil administration were\r\nresponsible. The ecclesia, on the other hand, had the right to impeach\r\nand dismiss those officials who, being given discretionary powers,\r\nabused them.\r\n\r\nThe main work of the heliæa was of course to settle domestic and\r\nimperial litigation. As we shall see, the judicial power of the heliæa\r\ngave it a large measure of political control over all the subject\r\ncities of Athens.\r\n\r\nThe heliæa was the brake on the democratic machine: the ecclesia\r\nwas the dynamo. The intent of the Athenians was that all political\r\ndecisions of importance should be reached, after full debate, by the\r\necclesia. It was, however, obvious that an assembly of from five to\r\nfifty thousand men would proceed with disastrous slowness if all\r\nmatters, great and small, were laid before it, or even if it considered\r\nonly significant affairs, but considered them without previous\r\nexamination and formulation. Perversion of modern democracies results\r\nmost notably from the usurpation of power on the part of those who sift\r\nproposals for popular reference. Athens had to guard against a similar\r\ndanger. Hence the harbinger of democracy, Clisthenes, created for it\r\none of the most peculiar _probuleutic_, or deliberative, bodies which\r\never had the handling of large affairs. This was the council of the\r\nFive Hundred.\r\n\r\nIt was constituted anew each year and was made an exact miniature of\r\nthe ecclesia which it was to serve. Every ward and township of Attica,\r\nto the number of one hundred and over, first eliminated such of its\r\nmembers as had not yet reached their thirtieth year or had already\r\nserved two terms in the council, and then selected by lot from among\r\nthe rest the councilor or councilors to which it was entitled on the\r\nbasis of population. Accordingly, each successive council had from\r\ntwo hundred and fifty to five hundred new and inexperienced members.\r\nNot desire or fitness but pure chance determined its personnel. Every\r\nsection, interest, and class of Attica--if we exclude young men between\r\neighteen and thirty--was adequately represented in it. There was,\r\ntherefore, a general presumption that it would take the same view of\r\npublic questions as the ecclesia; that it would do a disservice to its\r\nown members should it foster their temporary rights as councilors at\r\nthe expense of their lifelong rights as members of the ecclesia; that\r\nit would, in other words, labor to the best of its ability to present\r\nto the ecclesia a well-considered and sufficiently inclusive programme\r\nof business. Otherwise, the heliæa had to be faced at the end of the\r\ntwelve months.\r\n\r\nA committee of five hundred impresses us as little less unwieldy than\r\nan assembly of five thousand. Clisthenes was of the same opinion.\r\nHence he divided his council into ten sections, or prytanies, of fifty\r\nmembers each, and arranged that each prytany should act for the\r\nwhole for thirty-six days in an order determined by lot at the latest\r\npossible moment. The prytany was constituted in such a way that it was\r\na miniature of the council, just as the council was a miniature of\r\nthe ecclesia. The lot, again applied at the latest possible moment,\r\ndetermined, furthermore, which of its fifty members should be its\r\nchairman, and be present with one third of his colleagues in the\r\ncouncil chamber for the single twenty-four hours for which he served.\r\nThe same man was chairman of the council at its daily session, and\r\nhe also presided at the ecclesia, should a meeting of the citizens\r\nbe held on his day of office. A chance nomination for a single day's\r\nservice, at a time not previously known, was, Clisthenes thought,\r\na sufficient safeguard of council and ecclesia against successful\r\nscheming, conspiracy, collusion, or other interference with the popular\r\nwill on the part of the chairman. He was mistaken; and the later\r\ndemocracy took the further precaution of requiring the chairman to\r\nrelinquish the presidency at the meetings of the council and ecclesia\r\nto a board of nine men chosen by lot for that specific purpose from the\r\nnon-officiating prytanies of the council. One of the nine, designated\r\nlikewise by lot, was given the special honor and responsibility of\r\nputting the motions and declaring the votes.\r\n\r\nOnly proposals which originated in a council thus organized came before\r\nthe ecclesia; but there they might be discussed _ad libitum_, emended,\r\naccepted, rejected, or referred back to the council; and it was even\r\npossible during their consideration to substitute for the resolution\r\nof the council an entirely different bill, or to move that the council\r\nbring in a proposition at the next meeting on an altogether irrelevant\r\nmatter. It was the deliberate intention of the Athenians that the\r\necclesia should consider everything it wanted to consider.\r\n\r\nThe management of civil administration, subject to the constant\r\ndirection of the ecclesia and the watchful supervision of the\r\ncouncil,--which in this matter also acted for the body of which it\r\nwas a miniature,--was entrusted to a multitude of committees, each\r\ncomposed normally of ten members. Aristotle, in his _Constitution of\r\nthe Athenians_, specifies the duties of twenty-five such committees\r\nand estimates at seven hundred the number of citizens engaged annually\r\nin domestic administration. The work of each committee was definitely\r\ncircumscribed by law and formed a small bundle of routine matters. The\r\ncommittees may be thought of as standing drawn up in a long line for\r\nthe council to inspect. Had they been placed one behind the other in\r\nfiles, the rear committee being responsible to the one before it and so\r\non down to the front, the council would have come into direct contact\r\nonly with a few powerful committees. Such committees, however, must\r\nhave proved impossible for inexperienced councilors to manage. Besides,\r\nwhile the councilors, as agents of the ecclesia, and subject to its\r\ncommands, might properly hold all the civil magistrates to a monthly\r\naccounting, it was not thought in accord with democracy that one group\r\nof citizens who happened to hold one civil office should have under\r\ntheir direction another group of citizens also engaged temporarily on\r\npublic work. Though all the committees were thus on the same plane, and\r\nrecognized only the council as their common superintendent, the work\r\nthat they did was by no means of equal dignity or importance. It ranged\r\nall the way from managing the scavengers to managing the Great Dionysia.\r\n\r\nAll committees were reconstituted annually. No man could be a member of\r\nthe same committee twice in his lifetime. At the end of his year each\r\nmagistrate was required to render an indescribably minute accounting\r\nof his public acts, first to specially appointed auditing committees,\r\nand finally to the heliæa. It was an easy matter to get an office in\r\nAthens, but a very difficult task to get honorably rid of it. For\r\nthe lot was used to select the requisite number of members for each\r\ncommittee from among the citizens thirty years old or older who had\r\nnot disqualified themselves by earlier service. The theory that one\r\ncitizen was as competent as another for public office was thus put into\r\npractice. Every office was refilled annually by a chance group of new\r\nand necessarily inexperienced men.\r\n\r\nWhile defining constitutions Aristotle lays down the condition\r\nfor a thorough-going democracy that all citizens should hold\r\ngovernmental positions in turn. On this theory, there should have\r\nbeen an approximate agreement between the number of places in Athens\r\nand the number of citizens reaching their thirtieth year annually.\r\nThat, however, was not the case. Even if we assume that men were\r\ncouncilors only once and held only one magistracy in their lifetime,\r\nwe need to include some of the seven hundred (?) imperial posts in our\r\ncalculation, and regard them, too, as subject to the conditions of\r\ntenure assumed for domestic positions, in order to reach the required\r\ntotal of about thirteen hundred. This is, naturally, an unwarranted\r\nand unworkable series of assumptions. It is, however, reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the majority of Athenian citizens, and practically all\r\nof those who made a habit of attending the meetings of the ecclesia\r\nheld a _deme_, or municipal, position, let us say, in their youth; a\r\npost in the council or in the domestic or imperial administration in\r\ntheir maturity; and a place in the register of the six thousand jurors\r\nin their advancing years. Recall, now, that three hundred and sixty\r\nof the five hundred councilors had to preside at meetings of fifty\r\nand five hundred men, and, if chance willed, at one of from five to\r\nfifty thousand also; observe that magistrates had not only to know the\r\nduties of their office,--which included the reception and preparation\r\nof some kind of cases for submission to a panel of jurors, over which\r\nthey had, moreover, to preside,--but had also to keep accounts which\r\nthey must defend in a law court; reflect that jury service involved\r\nacting as judge and jury in both domestic and imperial litigation,\r\nand it will appear that the knowledge of reading and writing which\r\nClisthenes presupposed in all citizens would not have carried a man\r\nfar in the age of Pericles; he must then have had a working knowledge\r\nof parliamentary forms, he must have had the view of administration\r\nwhich comes of being on the inside of the wicket; he must have been so\r\nconversant with the law and legal procedure that he could assume heavy\r\npersonal responsibility for the legality of all bills proposed by him\r\nand could argue his own cases when acting as plaintiff or defendant in\r\na law suit. It was a proverb in Athens that \"office will show the man.\"\r\nWe may be sure that most men took some pains in advance that it did not\r\nshow them wholly incompetent. It must have left them with a new insight\r\ninto public affairs. It is fair to say that, as a consequence of all\r\nthis, the normal town meeting of the Athenians was, from one point of\r\nview, an assembly of experts, while viewed differently it possessed\r\nsimply a high level of amateur attainment, comparable, perhaps, with\r\nthat Mr. H.G. Wells postulates in his socialistic Utopia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe office assigned by Pericles to this assembly of high-class amateurs\r\nwas to choose the best among divergent policies proposed to it by\r\ncitizens of exceptional endowment. The ecclesia by no means closed\r\nthe door in the face of such real experts as it possessed. Thus it\r\ndid not leave it to the council to draw up the specifications for the\r\nconstruction of the naval arsenals or any similarly technical job, but\r\nit could and did delegate such tasks to men of special competence. Nor\r\nwas it so doctrinaire as to entrust the command of its expeditions or\r\nthe conduct of its diplomacy to chance persons; but it both elected\r\nits generals, reëlected them as often as it cared to, and gave them\r\nspecial rights of calling and canceling meetings of the ecclesia and\r\nof laying proposals directly before them. It was, accordingly, aware\r\nof the difficulty and danger which it faced in settling questions of\r\nforeign policy, where the elements involved, being the resources,\r\naims, sentiments, and traditions of other states, far transcended the\r\nknowledge of the common citizen; and where error might mean irreparable\r\ndisaster; where, in fact, error _did_ mean irreparable disaster.\r\n\r\nThe surest way to avoid error was to pick out a single individual of\r\nhigh character, intelligence, and competence, and give him cordial\r\nand resolute support in the policy he advocated. The ecclesia was\r\naccordingly a great \"contest,\" or _agon_, of statesmen. The Athenians\r\nbelieved in competition. A public contest, in which excellence might\r\nbe displayed and determined, was arranged to encourage effort in every\r\nconceivable employment. To digress a little, there was a contest of\r\npotters, as we learn from a gravestone on which an unknown affirms\r\nby a mighty oath that he was adjudged the first of all the potters of\r\nAttica. There were probably contests of painters and sculptors as well.\r\nThere were contests of horse-breeders--the chariot- and running-races;\r\ncontests of athletes of all ages in all kinds of physical exercises, of\r\ntorch-racers on foot and on horseback; there were contests between the\r\nsuccessive prytanies of the council, between detachments of cavalry,\r\nand between regiments of foot; at each of many festivals there were\r\ncontests in singing of five choruses of boys and five choruses of men,\r\neach fifty voices strong, so that a single festival called for the\r\ntraining of five hundred singers annually and the production of ten new\r\nmusical compositions; there were contests of rhapsodists in reciting\r\nHomer, contests of rhetoricians; above all contests of tragedians and\r\ncontests of comedians, each tragic contest demanding twelve new plays\r\nannually and the participation of one hundred and eighty choral singers\r\nand dancers, each comic contest involving six new plays yearly and one\r\nhundred and forty-four choral singers and dancers. The rivalry which\r\nproduces Olympic records and superdreadnaughts nowadays, the Athenians\r\nturned to advantage in art and music as well: with the result that the\r\ntaste and skill of the artisan as well as the sculptor and painter,\r\nof the consumer as well as the producer, became well-nigh faultless;\r\nthat in the hundred years of the empire close to two thousand plays of\r\npicked quality were written and staged in Athens, while during the\r\nsame time from five to six thousand new musical compositions were made\r\nand presented. It is estimated that upwards of two thousand Athenians\r\nhad to memorize the words and practice the music and dance figures of a\r\nlyric or dramatic chorus every year. Hence, a normal Athenian audience\r\nmust have been composed in large part of ex-performers, a fact which\r\nstudents of Sophocles and Aristophanes would do well to bear constantly\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nThe reward of victory in an athletic or musical contest was the glory\r\nand the prize. Great, indeed, was the reward which the victor in the\r\nsupreme contest, the struggle for political leadership in the ecclesia,\r\nobtained. The man to whom the Athenians gave their confidence became\r\nstronger than a king. \"In form,\" says Thucydides, \"their government\r\nwas a democracy: in reality it was the rule of their ablest citizen.\"\r\nThe man who was vanquished in a chariot-race might be the victor on\r\nthe next occasion. Not so the victim of a decisive political defeat.\r\nHis fate was ostracism. That is to say, he was exiled without dishonor\r\nor loss of property for ten years. The way was thereby cleared for the\r\nvictor. By this strange device the Athenians saved themselves for over\r\ntwo generations from the procrastination and uncertainty of distracted\r\ncounsels. It was ostracism which made possible the uncrowned kingship\r\nof Themistocles, Cimon, and Pericles; and when, after the death\r\nof Pericles in 429 B.C., this institution failed them utterly, the\r\nAthenians were pulled this way and that by rival leaders; till finally,\r\nmisled by Alcibiades and Cleophon, they were convicted by disaster of\r\nbeing _un_sound judges of _foreign_ policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that dies so hard as a well-nurtured delusion. In\r\nthe romantic-idealizing view of the Greeks which was long current,\r\nthe Athenians found leisure for art, literature, and philosophy by\r\nhaving all their work done for them by their slaves.[25] By this means,\r\ntoo, they were enabled to devote themselves freely to politics. If\r\nthis were so, the inference of Calhoun was a sound one, that seen \"in\r\nits true light\" slavery was \"the most safe and stable basis for free\r\ninstitutions in the world.\" The \"first lie\" is that the Athenians of\r\nthe great age, whose dominant characteristic was their vibrant mental\r\nand physical activity, were in any sense men of leisure. The few among\r\nthem who had slaves and other property to the extent of great wealth\r\nhad to make and manage their own investments. The majority of the\r\nfarmers had to till the land with their own hands. Many citizens--at\r\nleast one third of the whole, in all probability--had to earn their\r\nliving by selling their labor. This they could do easily in the\r\ntime of the empire. For during that period of rapid commercial and\r\nindustrial expansion the demand for labor was so great that the price\r\ncould be regulated only by the constant import of slaves and by a\r\nsteady stream of immigration from less prosperous parts of Greece.\r\nOutside labor served the purpose in Athens which immigrant labor serves\r\nin the United States to-day. With its growth grew the need that the\r\nmaterial prosperity which occasioned it should endure. The problem of\r\nfood-supply became progressively acute and the control of the sea was\r\nsoon seen to be an economic necessity. More than one half of the grain\r\nsold on the Athenian market came ultimately from abroad, as did an\r\neven larger proportion of the raw materials of Athenian industry. \"The\r\nAthenians are the only people in the Hellenic and barbarian world,\"\r\nwrote an Athenian aristocrat[26] in about 420 B.C., \"who are able to\r\ncontrol an abundant supply of raw materials. For if a state is rich in\r\ntimber for shipbuilding, where will it find a market for it if not with\r\nthe masters of the sea? If another abounds in iron or bronze or linen\r\nyarn, where will it find a market except with the sea-lord? Yet this is\r\nthe stock from which ships are made in Athens. One city yields timber\r\nto her, another iron, a third bronze, a fourth linen yarn, a fifth wax,\r\nand so on. Moreover, Athens prevents her rivals from transporting goods\r\nto other countries than Attica by the threat of driving them from the\r\nsea altogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe demands put upon the time of Athenian citizens by the state were\r\nenormous, but not such as to cripple economic production. A comparison\r\nwith modern conditions will make this clear. A little less frequently\r\nthan once a week the ecclesia met, but the attendance was generally\r\nless than one tenth of those qualified. That represents a suspension of\r\nwork roughly equivalent to our Saturday afternoons and legal holidays.\r\nA little oftener than once a week a contest or other public festival\r\noccurred, and to these there was, it seems, a pretty general resort.\r\nThey correspond to our fair-days and Sundays. Preparation for the\r\ncontests was, perhaps, not more destructive of money-earning time than\r\nare our collegiate and university courses. During their nineteenth\r\nand twentieth years young Athenians of the upper third trained for\r\nthe army; but it was not till a century after Pericles's death that\r\nuniversal military service for a similar period was made compulsory--as\r\nin modern Europe. We may assume that at least two years of every\r\ncitizen's life was required for deliberative and administrative work;\r\nand, having regard to the imperial service, we may, perhaps, advance\r\nthis requirement to three. That is an enormous enlargement of modern\r\ndemands. The same ratio would give the United States two million and a\r\nhalf or three million public employees, exclusive of postmasters and\r\npostal clerks, tax-collectors, and day laborers of every description.\r\nBut a bald comparison of this sort is misleading. Athens regularly\r\nemployed a committee of ten to do one man's work, with the result\r\nthat all of them were free to give nine tenths of their time to their\r\nprivate business. The council during the year and the jury courts at\r\nits expiry were there to insure the state that, even if his colleagues\r\nwould let him, any particular official did not neglect his public\r\nduties. Nor was the Athenian practice wildly extravagant so long as\r\nthe magistrate received, not a living salary, but an indemnity equal\r\nonly to a common workman's daily wage. The Athenians employed four\r\nhundred or even two thousand jurors where we employ twelve; but they\r\nhad neither high salaried judges nor exacting lawyers to pay, since the\r\njudicial system worked without either. The juryman's fee, moreover,\r\nwas a meagre indemnity, comparable to the old-age pension paid in the\r\nprogressive countries of modern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe payment of indemnities for service in the council, the\r\nmagistracies, the jury courts, and for attendance in the theatre,\r\nmusic-hall, and stadion, was a Periclean innovation. He did not intend\r\nto create a class of salaried officials; nor yet to make an advance\r\ntoward communism. His ideal was political, not economic, equality--to\r\nenable all, irrespective of wealth or station, to use the opportunities\r\nand face the obligations which democracy brought in its train. Like\r\nall the great democratic leaders who preceded him, he was a nobleman\r\nby birth and breeding, and, like them, he did not doubt for a moment\r\nthat the culture which ennobled the life of his class would dignify and\r\nuplift that of the masses also. To give the workingman the political\r\ninsight and knowledge of the Eupatrids; to lend to him the grace and\r\nelasticity of movement which physical culture gave them; to fill his\r\nmemory with the noble thoughts set in melodious and stirring words\r\nwhich they got from their intimacy with great poetry; to inspire in\r\nhim, though a mere artisan, an artist's taste and fervor for formal\r\nbeauty--that was to bless him with more than leisure. It was to unite\r\nthe whole people in a community of high ideas and emotions. It was\r\nto make them a nation of noblemen. We do not wonder much that in the\r\nfurtherance of this cause the men of large wealth in Athens volunteered\r\nto assume in turn financial and personal responsibility for the support\r\nof the theatre, the opera-house, the stadion, and the gymnasia. It was\r\na heavy burden, but, in the absence of a regular property or income\r\ntax, generosity became at once a duty and a wise precaution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA nation of noblemen is a luxury for which somebody has to pay. Athens,\r\nin Pericles's memorable phrase, was \"the school of Hellas.\" It was\r\nright, he thought, that the Hellenes should sacrifice something for\r\ntheir education. He had tried to make them all contributory allies of\r\nAthens, but had failed in the attempt. As a good schoolmaster he was\r\ndetermined, none the less, to hold those \"well in hand\" whom he had\r\nunder his care.\r\n\r\nThe physical means to this end was the control of the sea. The\r\nadvantages of sea power in warfare, in enabling the holder of it to\r\ncircumscribe according to his convenience the area of military action,\r\nas well as in facilitating mobilization, transport, and communications,\r\nwere not perceived for the first time by the English Admiralty, much\r\nless by Clausewitz and Captain Mahan. They are stated in the clearest\r\nterms by a contemporary of Pericles.[27] Here is what he says: \"The\r\nsubjects of a power which is dominant by land have it open to them to\r\nform contingents from several small states and to muster in force to\r\nbattle. But with the subjects of a naval power it is different. As far\r\nas they are groups of islands (and the whole world, we may remark in\r\npassing, is now simply a magnified Ægean Archipelago) it is impossible\r\nfor their states to meet together for united action, for the sea lies\r\nbetween them, and the dominant power is master of the sea. And even if\r\nit were possible for them to assemble in some single island unobserved,\r\nthey would only do so to perish of famine. And as to the states subject\r\nto Athens which are not islanders, but situated on the continent, the\r\nlarger are held in check by need and the small ones absolutely by fear,\r\nsince there is no state in existence which does not depend upon imports\r\nand exports and these she will forfeit, if she does not lend a willing\r\near to those who are masters of the sea. In the next place, a power\r\ndominant by sea can do certain things which a land power is debarred\r\nfrom doing; as, for instance, ravage the territory of a superior, since\r\nit is always possible to coast along to some point, where either there\r\nis no hostile force to deal with or merely a small body; and in case\r\nof an advance in force on the part of the enemy they can take to their\r\nships and sail away. Such a performance is attended by less difficulty\r\nthan that experienced by the army marching along the seaboard to the\r\nrescue. Again, it is open to a power so dominating by sea to leave its\r\nown territory and sail off on as long a voyage as you please. Whereas\r\nthe land power cannot place more than a few days' journey between\r\nitself and its own territory, for marches are slow affairs; and it is\r\nnot possible for an army on the march to have food supplies to last\r\nfor any great length of time. Such an army must either march through\r\nfriendly territory or it must force a way by victory in battle. The\r\nvoyager meanwhile has it in his power to disembark at any point where\r\nhe finds himself in superior force; or, at the worst, to coast by\r\nuntil he reaches either a friendly district or an enemy too weak to\r\nresist. Again, those diseases to which the fruits of the earth are\r\nliable as visitations from heaven fall severely on a land power, but\r\nare scarcely felt by the naval power, for such sicknesses do not visit\r\nthe whole earth everywhere at once.... There is just one thing which\r\nthe Athenians lack. Supposing they were the inhabitants of an island,\r\nand were still, as now, rulers of the sea, they would have had it in\r\ntheir power to work whatever mischief they liked and suffer no evil in\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nAt all costs Athens must retain control of the sea. That meant to keep\r\nthe fleet constantly in fighting trim. In the effort the Athenians\r\nmade the most heroic financial and personal sacrifices, demonstrating\r\nclearly that popular government need not be self-indulgent. Neither the\r\naristocracy in England nor Napoleon in France was as hard a taskmaster\r\nof the people as the majority which ruled in Athens. Between 410 and\r\n402 B.C.--a time of great economic distress--a well-to-do citizen was\r\ncalled upon to expend twenty thousand franks--which are perhaps equal\r\nin purchasing power to as many dollars--on what we may call national\r\neducation and entertainment. His taxes on the account of the fleet\r\namounted in the same years to double as much, or forty-three thousand\r\nfranks. Great as was the burden of the rich, that of the commons was\r\nconceded by their adversaries to have been still greater. \"In the\r\nfirst place,\" writes an aristocrat in about 420 B.C.,[28] \"it is only\r\njust that the poorer classes and the 'people' of Athens should have\r\nthe advantage over the men of birth and wealth, seeing that it is the\r\npeople who man the fleet and put round the city her girdle of power.\r\nThe steersman, the boatswain, the lieutenant, the look-out-man at\r\nthe prow, the shipwright--these are the people who engird the city\r\nwith power far rather than her heavy infantry and men of birth and\r\nquality.\" Plutarch[29] tells us that on a peace footing Athens kept a\r\nfleet of sixty ships on the sea for eight months of every year. To man\r\nsuch a squadron 10,200 rowers, 480 officers, and 600 marines would be\r\nrequired. In other words, one quarter of all the citizens of Athens\r\nwould have lived on their battleships for three quarters of every year.\r\nWe might believe this report, if it were not contradicted by Aristotle,\r\nwho in a place, where exaggeration, not reduction, is suspected,[30]\r\nmakes the fleet of Athens, which was constantly in service in time of\r\nwar, consist only of twenty guard-ships. Hence one twelfth and not\r\none quarter of all the Athenians were on active naval duty during the\r\nsailing season of almost every year. In addition, two thousand men were\r\ndrafted yearly by lot to serve in garrisons throughout the empire; so\r\nthat, if these are added to the seven hundred (?) imperial magistrates,\r\nand the five hundred guards of the arsenals, nearly another one twelfth\r\nof the citizens was involved.\r\n\r\nThis computation takes no account of the demands of naval warfare. In\r\nthe Athenian dockyards lay ready for action four hundred battleships,\r\nfrom which the requisite number was selected for each particular\r\nexpedition. If two hundred and fifty vessels were mobilized, as\r\noccasionally happened, nearly fifty thousand additional sailors were\r\nrequired. With the use of every possible citizen Athens could not\r\nproduce such a number. She commonly did her utmost and called upon the\r\nallies for the rest.\r\n\r\nIt is true that tribute was collected from the allies to enable Athens\r\nto build the ships and pay the sailors; but it is also true that, in\r\naddition, huge sums were contributed for mobilization expenses by rich\r\nAthenians and were advanced for heavy war expenses by the Athenian\r\ntreasury. And Athens gave freely not only of her money but also of her\r\nblood. The death roll of one of the ten corps into which the Athenians\r\nwere divided for army and navy purposes is extant for the year 459\r\nB.C. \"Of the Erechtheid _phyle_,\" it runs, \"these are they who died\r\nin the war, in Cyprus, in Egypt, in Phoenicia, at Halieis, in Ægina,\r\nat Megara, in the same year\";[31] and one hundred and seventy-two\r\nnames follow. It was not the year of a great battle, or of an Athenian\r\ndisaster, yet in it the death rate must have been nearly twice as great\r\nas the birth rate; so costly in lives was the empire to its lords in\r\nwar-time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn three specific points and on one general ground, contemporaries\r\nboth within and without Athens assailed the treatment accorded by\r\nthe Periclean democracy to its subjects. In no instance, however, is\r\nthe charge of misbehavior established conclusively, though in this\r\nmatter, as in so many others in the history of Greece, our judgment is\r\ndependent upon the point at which we transfer our sympathy from the\r\ncity-states, which were the bearers of culture in the Greek Middle\r\nAges, to the whole people, for whose progress and independence urban\r\nparticularism was finally fatal. \"Surely Hellas is insulted with a\r\ndire insult,\" declared the opponents of Pericles,[32] \"and manifestly\r\nsubjected to tyranny when she sees that, with her own enforced\r\ncontributions for the war, we are gilding and bedizening our city,\r\nwhich, for all the world like a wanton woman, adds to her wardrobe\r\nprecious stones and costly statues and temples worth their millions.\"\r\nTo this accusation the proper retort was, not that having provided\r\nadequate protection against Persia, Athens was free to spend the money\r\ncontributed by the subjects in any way she pleased; for the logical\r\ninference was then that the contributions were excessive. Pericles\r\nmay not have cared to be logical, but he could not ignore forms. Had\r\nhe been able to show, as has been claimed recently, that he used for\r\nbuilding purposes only the sixtieth of the tribute, which had been\r\ndedicated as the first fruits to Athena, he would never have been\r\nattacked at all. Evidently, he spent on Athenian public works much\r\nlarger sums derived indirectly from the tribute, for which course\r\nthe defense actually made seems to have been that the money was due\r\nAthens for losses sustained during the invasion of Xerxes and for sums\r\nadvanced to the war fund during the continuance of the struggle with\r\nPersia. In any case the tribute paid was a mere bagatelle as compared\r\nwith what the subjects saved through having no fleets of their own to\r\nmaintain.\r\n\r\nThe charge is more serious that in order to enjoy \"the steady receipt\r\nof salaries throughout the year derived from the court fees\"; to\r\n\"manage the affairs of the subjects while seated at home without the\r\nexpense of naval expeditions\"; to \"preserve the partisans of democracy\r\nand ruin its opponents\"; to boost the business of hotel keepers and\r\nsuch ilk in Athens, and to win for the common citizens the flattery\r\nand consideration that would be shown otherwise only to generals and\r\nambassadors, the Athenians \"compelled the allies to voyage to Athens\r\nin order to have their cases tried.\" For it seems clear that the law\r\ncourts at Athens were usually so clogged with litigation that the gain\r\nin having a model code of law and in escaping the fierce partisanship\r\nof the local tribunals was largely neutralized by the added expense\r\nand humiliation. The real justification of the practice was that it\r\nobviated the necessity of sending out naval expeditions.\r\n\r\nIn the third place Athens took from the allies lands and settled them\r\nwith impecunious Athenians; but in payment therefor reductions of\r\ntribute were given. On the other hand, thousands from the allied cities\r\nmigrated to Athens, and, while not escaping military or financial\r\nservice, or obtaining Athenian citizenship, they were cordially\r\nwelcomed, and enjoyed to the full the commercial and industrial\r\nadvantages of the metropolis. Again, Athenians often found it less\r\nprofitable to invest capital in Attic land, which was exposed to\r\nhostile attack, than in lands on the islands of the empire, which the\r\nfleet protected. Hence there were many Attic farmers in the subject\r\nterritory, their right to own foreign real estate being secured by\r\ncommercial treaties. There was accordingly economic give and take, the\r\nmilitary preponderance of Athens being, however, responsible for the\r\nresult that the Athenians abroad were often policemen, the allies in\r\nAthens, hostages.\r\n\r\nIn all three instances of alleged misbehavior, it must be admitted that\r\nthe defense offered by the Athenian apologists simply added insult to\r\ninjury in the view of a majority of the subjects. But for them Athens,\r\narrogant or conciliatory, malefactor or benefactor, was always a\r\nforeign governor to be gotten rid of at any cost. Such uncompromising\r\nsentiments time alone could alter, and to secure the benefits of time\r\nPericles endeavored to avoid an Hellenic war. His policy of peace after\r\n446 B.C. was, therefore, the sound policy of an imperialist.\r\n\r\nThe general ground on which contemporaries criticized the Athenian\r\nrégime was that under it every assistance was given by the state to\r\nthe least cultivated portion of the inhabitants both of Athens and of\r\nits four hundred and twenty subject cities, at the expense of the most\r\nintelligent and cultivated elements; that the highest goal of endeavor\r\nwas moral and intellectual mediocrity. There may be some truth in this\r\ncontention. The case would be more conclusive, however, if the tendency\r\nof the critics to identify intelligence with wealth and cultivation\r\nwith birth were less obvious. If the point be granted, we must accept\r\nthe opinion of those historians who affirm that Athens was great in\r\nthis age despite, and not because of, its democracy. Personally, I do\r\nnot believe that this was so. I cannot admit that extirpation of the\r\nbest was practiced in an age in which ideas were created and forms were\r\nperfected for their literary and artistic expression which have been\r\nthe wonder and despair of the men of the highest cultivation from that\r\nday to this. Does it not seem like irony that a régime is charged with\r\npromoting mediocrity under which rose Sophocles, Herodotus, Phidias,\r\nPericles, Euripides, Hippocrates, Socrates, and Thucydides? Much more\r\nimportant than the leveling tendency of the democracy was the facility\r\nit afforded for men of ability both to rise to the top and to find\r\nthere a sympathetic and critical audience. So much for democracy.\r\n\r\nThe empire stands approved by the fact that the sharpest accusation\r\nnow made against the democracy is that it failed to make the empire\r\nenduring. On this point the last word--unless it be that no political\r\norder has ever been enduring, and that those which have lasted\r\nthe longest have been generally of the least worth--was said by\r\nThucydides[33] over twenty-three hundred years ago, and I present in\r\nconclusion his masterly account of the circumstances which led to the\r\ndownfall of the Athenian Empire:--\r\n\r\n\"During the peace while Pericles was at the head of affairs he ruled\r\nwith prudence; under his guidance Athens was safe, and reached the\r\nheight of her greatness in his time. When the war began, he showed that\r\nhere, too, he had formed a true estimate of the Athenian power. He\r\nsurvived the commencement of hostilities two years and six months; and,\r\nafter his death, his foresight was even better appreciated than during\r\nhis life. For he had told the Athenians that if they would be patient\r\nand would attend to their navy, and not seek to enlarge their dominions\r\nwhile the war was going on, nor imperil the existence of the city, they\r\nwould be victorious; but they did all that he told them not to do,\r\nand in matters which seemingly had nothing to do with the war, from\r\nmotives of private ambition and private interest they adopted a policy\r\nwhich had disastrous effects in respect both of themselves and of their\r\nallies; their measures, had they been successful, would have brought\r\nhonor and profit only to individuals, and, when unsuccessful, crippled\r\nthe city in the conduct of the war. The reason of the difference was\r\nthat he, deriving authority from his capacity and acknowledged worth,\r\nbeing also a man of transparent integrity, was able to control the\r\nmultitude in a free spirit; he led them rather than was led by them;\r\nfor, not seeking power by dishonest arts, he had no need to say\r\npleasant things, but, on the strength of his own high character, could\r\nventure to oppose and even to anger them. When he saw them unseasonably\r\nelated and arrogant, his words humbled and awed them; and when they\r\nwere depressed by groundless fears, he sought to reanimate their\r\nconfidence. Thus Athens, though still in name a democracy, was in fact\r\nruled by her greatest citizen. But his successors were more on an\r\nequality with one another, and, each struggling to be first himself,\r\nthey were ready to sacrifice the whole conduct of affairs to the whims\r\nof the people. Such weakness in a great and imperial city led to many\r\nerrors, of which the greatest was the Sicilian expedition; not that\r\nthe Athenians miscalculated their enemy's power, but they themselves,\r\ninstead of consulting for the interests of the expedition which they\r\nhad sent out, were occupied in intriguing against one another for the\r\nleadership of the democracy, and not only grew remiss in the management\r\nof the army, but became embroiled, for the first time, in civil strife.\r\nAnd yet, after they had lost in the Sicilian expedition the greater\r\npart of their fleet and army, and were distracted by revolution at\r\nhome, still they held out three years not only against their former\r\nenemies, but against the Sicilians who had combined with them, and\r\nagainst most of their own allies who had risen in revolt. Even\r\nwhen Cyrus, the son of the King, joined in the war and supplied the\r\nPeloponnesian fleet with money, they continued to resist, and were at\r\nlast overthrown, not by their enemies, but by themselves and their own\r\ninternal dissensions.\"\r\n\r\nA summarization such as this, in style austere and authoritative,\r\nin content the product of penetrating insight and wonderful sense\r\nfor political realities, not only bears witness to the greatness of\r\nThucydides; when it is contrasted with similar analyses in Plato and\r\nAristotle it testifies to the loss of power for sustained historical\r\nthinking which Greece suffered when men of genius were no longer\r\nenriched by the experience which came through living in a state like\r\nthe imperial democracy of Athens. Not the least of its merits is\r\nits self-restraint. Having concluded that the reckless rivalries of\r\nher would-be leaders and the reckless dissensions of her citizens\r\nruined Athens, he refrains from assigning a cause for the spirit of\r\nlawlessness. It is not Thucydides, but Alcibiades, who declared that\r\ndemocracy was \"manifest folly\"; not he, but Cleon, who reiterated that\r\n\"a democracy cannot manage an empire.\" Thucydides does not despair\r\nof democracy. In the case of Athens it was less the unsoundness of\r\nthe \"majority\" than the selfishness of the \"remnant\" that caused the\r\nnation to perish. For the demoralization of their leaders, however, the\r\nAthenians themselves held Socrates responsible, meaning to incriminate\r\nthe Sophistic movement. Who shall say that they were wrong? And\r\nwho shall hold democracy responsible for the evils of the Sophistic\r\nmovement?\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n 1.

It was then reported that\r\nthey were the kinsmen of the Jews. According to one version of the\r\nstory, Judæa was founded by a Spartan named Judæus, who had accompanied\r\nthe god Dionysus from Thebes on his triumphal progress through Asia.\r\nAccording to another account, the Spartans were descendants of Abraham,\r\nthe strongest of the children of Israel having migrated to Greece at\r\nthe time Moses led the remainder out of Egypt to the land of Canaan.[34]\r\n\r\nThis absurd legend, of which the Greek origin is unmistakable, seems\r\nto have been responsible for a certain _rapprochement_ between the\r\ntwo peoples. Despite the first book of the Maccabees, which affirms\r\nthe contrary, it is, indeed, impossible that Areus I, king of Sparta\r\nbetween 308 and 264 B.C., wrote to Onias I, Jewish high priest,\r\ndemanding and offering a community of goods, and that Jonathan\r\nMaccabæus, one hundred and fifty years afterwards, sent greetings\r\nto the Spartans, together with the word that the Jews \"at all\r\ntimes without ceasing both in their feasts and other convenient\r\ndays remembered them in the sacrifices which they offered, and in\r\ntheir prayers, as reason was, and as it becameth them to think upon\r\ntheir brethren.\"[35] Nothing is more unlikely than that the Spartans\r\nvolunteered to divide their \"cattle\" and property with the Jews only\r\na short time before they crushed with great bloodshed a communistic\r\nmovement among their own citizens, unless it be the thought that the\r\nprayers and offerings of the Jews went up continually to Jehovah for\r\nthe prosperity of heathen who were also backsliders. Nevertheless, that\r\ncommunications were actually established between the Judæa of Onias\r\nand Jonathan and the Sparta of Areus and Menalcidas, we cannot doubt;\r\nand, indeed, we have still other evidences that the alleged community\r\nof origin was turned to account by the Jews. There was evidently a\r\nconsiderable Jewish settlement in Sparta.\r\n\r\nWhen we seek to discover the reason for this strange conjunction of\r\nthe warrior community by the Eurotas and the religious community by\r\nthe Jordan, we are helped by observing that in another Hellenistic\r\nlegend the Jews are made the kinsmen of the gymnosophists, or naked\r\nphilosophers, of India. The Greek mind was at this time fascinated\r\nby the great problem of subordinating the species of things to their\r\nproper genera, of perceiving the types by means of which individual\r\nobjects became intelligible parts of a cosmos. It was the age of\r\nAristotle and Theophrastus, Menander and the New Comedy, of idealistic\r\nportraiture. Hence the temptation was irresistible to bring into family\r\nrelationship the various societies of men in which the principle of\r\ncaste dominated; to regard it as unessential that in Judæa the people\r\nwere there to support the priests, in Laconia to support the soldiers,\r\nin India to support the Brahmans. In each case there was found an odd\r\ncommunity, in which, so far at least as the state could accomplish\r\nit, all human interests were subordinated to one, be it war and\r\npreparation for war, religious practices of a ritualistic character, or\r\ntheosophical speculation.\r\n\r\nHad the Greeks known it, there was a further analogy of an external\r\nsort between the Spartans and the Jews which they would have delighted\r\nto establish. For at about the same time that a richly diversified\r\nnational life was narrowed down in Judæa to a single interest under the\r\nstress of complete preoccupation with the means of regaining Jehovah's\r\nfavor for his chosen people, Sparta ruthlessly compressed and crushed a\r\nmany-sided and progressive culture to the end that her citizens might\r\nbecome trained soldiers, having but one esprit, the esprit de corps of\r\na professional army.\r\n\r\nPrior to 580 B.C. Sparta was the home of poets and musicians. It was\r\nfor a chorus of Spartan maidens, the élite of the noble families, that\r\nAlcman wrote the exquisite lines on the breathless calm of nature\r\nwhich Goethe has made familiar to all lovers of poetry. In hollow\r\nLacedæmon--a valley rich with vegetation suggestive of bountiful\r\nharvests, down which the steel-gray Eurotas runs, swift and turbulent,\r\nover its rocky bottom, and over which rise on either side the\r\nsnow-capped ridges of Taygetus and Parnon, their slopes resonant with\r\nthe songs of the nightingales in the mating season--in this secluded\r\nspot, whose haunting beauty is a joy forever to all who have seen it,\r\nthere was reared a famous temple of Athena, \"Athena of the Brazen\r\nHouse,\" at a time when in Athens itself the city's protecting goddess\r\nhad to be content with a crude, primitive sanctuary.\r\n\r\nAll this, and much besides, was observed, and the proper inferences\r\ndrawn, by Eduard Meyer twenty years ago;[36] so that the amazement with\r\nwhich the English archæologists, who have excavated in Laconia during\r\nthe past five or six years, report their remarkable \"finds\" is a source\r\nof no little amusement to the wary. They have discovered that prior to\r\n580 B.C. Sparta was the maker of a kind of artistic pottery which was\r\nknown and imitated in far-distant Cyrene and Tarentum; that she then\r\nhad trade relations with Egypt and Lydia; that \"combs, toilet-boxes,\r\nelaborate pins and bronze ornaments, seals, necklaces, and gold and\r\nivory gewgaws\" were made and used--witnesses _for_ \"a golden age of\r\nSpartan art,\" _against_ the puritanical spirit traditionally attributed\r\nto early and middle Sparta.[37]\r\n\r\nIn Athens, as we have seen, supremacy in art and literature was\r\nattained by making universal among citizens the spirit and culture of\r\nthe aristocracy, the whole people, thus ennobled, being supported on\r\nthe shoulders of the tributary allies and enriched by the commercial\r\nadvantages of maritime empire. The development of Sparta was directly\r\nthe reverse of this. There the aristocracy, whose exuberance of life\r\nand responsiveness to sensuous impressions are attested with sufficient\r\ncertainty, was destroyed in the sixth century B.C.\r\n\r\nThis century was one of repression in Greece generally; whence some\r\nhistorians have called it the epoch of the Greek Reformation. It is the\r\ntime of the \"Seven Wise Men,\" from one of whom came the Delphian motto\r\n\"nothing in excess,\" a time in which the riotous joy of living and the\r\nfresh spontaneity of the so-called Ionian Renascence were subdued by a\r\nforce, which might have been everywhere a blight,--as in Sparta,--but\r\nwhich in fact, when later the inspiration of the great Persian War\r\ncame, exerted the gentle restraint which marks the classic in Greek\r\nart and letters. In this perilous period the aristocracy of Sparta\r\nperished, and with it the ideals and accomplishments of which it had\r\nbeen the exponent.\r\n\r\nThe instrument of repression of all that was superior to the average\r\nin Spartan life was the college of the five ephors, which Cicero\r\ncompares with the tribunate in Rome. The ephors acquired such power\r\nthat they made the continuance of even the kingship dependent upon the\r\nsubmission of the kings to their authority; and upon the kings, as upon\r\nall others, they enforced the new rules of law of which they were the\r\nliving expositors.\r\n\r\nThe development of Sparta, like the development of Rome, from\r\naristocratic to republican government is characterized by the absence\r\nof tyrants. The fact is that the tribunate in the one case and the\r\nephorate in the other was tyranny in commission, the division of its\r\npowers between ten and five annually changing officers respectively\r\nhaving proved to be a sufficient safeguard against the concentration\r\nof executive power in the person of a single individual, be he an\r\ninherited king robbed of monarchical rights or an ambitious demagogue\r\naiming at their restoration.\r\n\r\nThe new rules of law which the ephors enforced prescribed in minute\r\ndetail the life of the citizen from the moment of his birth to the\r\ntime of his death. They were the regulations of a military school in\r\nwhich war alone was taught, of military barracks when war was already\r\ndeclared. From seven years of age to sixty the entire energies of the\r\nmale half of the population were directed toward being prepared for\r\nwar. Boys and men drilled and hunted, learned to use their weapons\r\nand campaigned, danced and exercised, ate in the \"messes\" year in and\r\nyear out, and never escaped the watchful eyes of trainers, subalterns,\r\nofficers, and ephors.\r\n\r\nNo one in Sparta had to make his own way in life. His whole course was\r\nmapped out for him before he was born. No citizen had any business\r\ncares; for all trade and industry were tabooed, and the lands which he\r\ninherited he could not sell. Neither could he buy those of another. The\r\nagricultural laborers were serfs, the sullen and recalcitrant Helots,\r\nof whom there were fifteen to every Spartan; the clothing and weapons\r\nwere made by the contented and tractable Perioecs, who outnumbered\r\nthe Spartans five to one, and formed with their one hundred hamlets\r\nand their contiguous territories an insulating band round Helots and\r\nSpartans alike. Iron money was the only local currency, though silver\r\nhad, of course, to be given in payment for the articles which were\r\nimported from abroad. These, however, were reduced to a minimum, and\r\nsuch foreigners as made their way through the wall of Perioecs were\r\nrounded up at intervals and forcefully expelled.\r\n\r\nAll the pretty things of their earlier life, the Spartans chose to do\r\nwithout. Coarse fare and unlovely houses, piazzas devoid of statues\r\nand inclosed in unsightly and flimsy public buildings; no theatres, no\r\nnew music, no new ideas of any kind; mothers who gave up their little\r\nchildren and their grown sons without flinching; wives who violated\r\nfundamental instincts that their offspring might be more perfect;\r\nhomeless boys who went half-naked winter and summer, slept in pens in\r\nthe open air like cattle and got their food and living by their wits;\r\ngirls who would hardly have known their brothers, brides who would\r\nhardly have recognized their husbands, mothers who would hardly have\r\nbeen able to distinguish their own sons, were it not that there were\r\nless than five thousand brothers, husbands, and sons in all--of such\r\nwas the new Sparta, to whose citizens the ephors issued the annual\r\ncommand \"to shave their mustaches and obey the laws.\" Long-haired and\r\ntangly-bearded, in groups of about fifteen each, they lounged and\r\nate and slept in the three hundred tents, or barracks, which lined\r\nHyacinth Street. There they kept their long spears and their armor.[38]\r\nThence, clad in their scarlet cloaks, they issued in time of danger\r\nor of war to take their places, group by group, in the five carefully\r\ndrilled regiments of which the Spartan phalanx was composed. Quietly,\r\nat an appointed hour in a single night, the whole army might steal\r\naway without confusion, trailing after it, on occasion, thirty-five\r\nthousand Helots to attend to the commissariat. Five thousand Perioec\r\nhoplites might follow at its heels, and with machine-like precision,\r\nto the sound of flutes played in the austere Dorian mode, ten thousand\r\nLacedæmonian soldiers might advance into battle against foemen who were\r\nalways comparatively ill-organized, and who often fled before a single\r\nblow was struck.\r\n\r\nThe secret of this strange perversion of the natural life of man is to\r\nbe found in the declaration of war annually made by the ephors upon\r\nthe Helots. They could not follow it up by a campaign waged in regular\r\nfashion; for that would have been to destroy their own serfs. But\r\nthey picked out young soldiers, and sent them about among the Helots,\r\nwith instructions to strike down secretly all who seemed restless or\r\nover-ambitious. The chief centre of Helot disaffection, at least in\r\nthe seventh and sixth centuries B.C., was on the far side of Mount\r\nTaygetus, in Messenia. There the yoke of serfdom chafed more than\r\nelsewhere, not least because those whose estates the Helots of Messenia\r\ntilled for one half the yield lived beyond the snow-capped ridge which\r\nshuts in that country on the east. The Messenians aspired to regain\r\ntheir lost independence. The Helots of the Eurotas Valley had no such\r\nambition. They were, therefore, slower to revolt against injustice; but\r\ntheir aim, when an insurrection _did_ come, could be nothing less than\r\nthe extermination of their masters, or at least an exchange of position\r\nwith them. Moreover, their very proximity to the five villages which\r\nconstituted the unwalled city of Sparta, and the very weight of their\r\nnumbers made the Spartans live in ever-present fear of a massacre.\r\nConstant preparedness for war was, accordingly, a simple mandate of\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Spartans thought it unwise that any of their serf-tilled estates\r\nshould lie in or outside the ring of Perioec land. It would not do\r\nto have fuses, so to speak, of Helots running through the wall to the\r\noutside world, or to have masses of Helots beyond the wall, exposed\r\ndirectly to foreign manipulation. Hence the formation of the Perioec\r\nring set definite limits to the territory of Sparta. It could be\r\nenlarged in but one way--the widening of the ring by the reduction of\r\nmore and more outlying states to the status of Perioecs. And it was\r\nin this way that the Spartan dominions were in fact enlarged in the\r\nseventh century B.C.[39]\r\n\r\nAt the end of this century, however, Sparta came into conflict with\r\ncities which, unlike the mountain and maritime hamlets situated\r\nroundabout Laconia and Messenia, were too strong and high-spirited\r\nto submit to Spartan control. They had, therefore, to be treated\r\nleniently, since Sparta could not crush them altogether and would\r\nnot leave them alone. And the reasons for conciliatory action were\r\nstrengthened by the fact that Sparta had now to act abroad with a sharp\r\neye to the possibility of a servile insurrection at home. There was\r\nnever anything mechanical or idealistic in the foreign policy of the\r\nephors. Hence, first with Tegea at about 560 B.C., and thereafter with\r\nall the states in the Peloponnesus, excepting Argos and Achæa, Sparta\r\nconcluded a treaty, the imperialistic aspect of which was that they\r\nagreed individually to accept Sparta's leadership in all defensive\r\nwars and in offensive wars to which they had assented.\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesian league, thus formed, stood for the autonomy and\r\nfreedom of its members; but Sparta, by championing aristocracies\r\nagainst tyrants and democracies, and using to its own advantage the\r\njealousies of its allies as well as their fears of outside powers,\r\ndominated it for one hundred and eighty years, and made it during all\r\nthat time the main steadying influence in Greek politics. Twice it was\r\nenlarged into an Hellenic league, first during the three years of the\r\ngreat Persian invasion (480-478 B.C.), and again for ten years after\r\nthe dissolution of the Athenian empire (405-395 B.C.). On the earlier\r\noccasion, the ephors felt relieved of an intolerable burden when in\r\n477 B.C. the Ægean cities, over four hundred and twenty in number,\r\nabandoned Spartan for Athenian leadership. And in the forty-six years\r\nthat followed, not they but the Athenians were the aggressors. During\r\nthat epoch of democratic fervor,[40] it was an uphill struggle for\r\nthe champions of aristocracy to maintain their position; and the war\r\nof political principles was even carried into Sparta, when, in 464\r\nB.C., the Helots of Messenia made a last desperate fight for their\r\nliberty. The Spartans profited, however, during the last third of the\r\nfifth century B.C., by the discredit into which democracy came among\r\ncultivated people through the mistakes and excesses of Athens; and\r\nat the end of the Peloponnesian War they were again able to make the\r\nPeloponnesian league an Hellenic league by incorporating into it Athens\r\nand the Ægean cities which they had just \"liberated\" from Athenian\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nA successful war may strengthen a nation, but not when victory lays\r\nupon it a task that is beyond its powers to perform. Such would have\r\nbeen the case had Athens won at Syracuse. Such was the issue of\r\nÆgospotami. This we can readily see by examining briefly, first the\r\nsituation in Sparta, and then the position of Sparta in Hellas, during\r\nthe existence of her second Hellenic league.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans of military age now numbered only about two thousand. War\r\nhad done its part in reducing them to this handful. Close intermarriage\r\nhad done even more. In the case of large families, the subdivision of\r\nlots which then occurred impoverished sons so greatly that they could\r\nno longer stand the expense of the military clubs, upon membership in\r\nwhich, however, citizenship depended. So far did the evil implicit in\r\nthis condition go that brothers refused to divide their inheritance,\r\nand possessed not only one house, but one wife in common. Men could\r\nneither buy land nor sell it, but they might acquire it by marriage\r\nor by gift; and since the rich, then as always, tended to marry among\r\nthemselves, property, and with it citizenship, remained eventually in\r\nthe possession of a very few. Much of the land, which was the only\r\nwealth, came into the hands of women. A plutocracy thus developed\r\nin Sparta as the number of the Spartans diminished; and in this way\r\nthe domestic situation became still further ominous by the growth in\r\nthe city of a considerable body of disfranchised and discontented\r\n\"inferiors\" and half-breeds.\r\n\r\nThe perils which attended this situation are revealed by the following\r\nincident as described by Xenophon in his _Hellenica_:[41]--\r\n\r\n\"Now Agesilaus (401-360 B.C.) had not been seated on the throne one\r\nyear when, as he sacrificed one of the appointed sacrifices in behalf\r\nof the city, the soothsayer warned him, saying: 'The gods reveal a\r\nconspiracy of the most fearful character'; and when the king sacrificed\r\na second time, he said: 'The aspect of the victims is now even yet\r\nmore terrible'; but when he had sacrificed for the third time, the\r\nsoothsayer exclaimed: 'O Agesilaus, the sign is given to me, even\r\nas though we were in the very midst of the enemy.' Thereupon they\r\nsacrificed to the deities who avert evil and work salvation, and so\r\nbarely obtained good omens, and ceased sacrificing. Nor had five\r\ndays elapsed after the sacrifices were ended, ere one came bringing\r\ninformation to the ephors of a conspiracy, and named Cinadon as the\r\nringleader; a young man robust of body as of soul, but not one of the\r\npeers. Accordingly, the ephors questioned their informant: 'How say\r\nyou the occurrence is to take place?' and he who gave the information\r\nanswered: 'Cinadon took me to the limit of the market-place, and bade\r\nme count how many Spartans there were in the market-place; and I\r\ncounted--king, and ephors, and elders, and others, maybe forty. _But\r\ntell me, Cinadon_, I said to him, _why have you bidden me count them?_\r\nand he answered me: _Those men, I would have you know, are your sworn\r\nfoes; and all those others, more than four thousand, congregated there\r\nare your natural allies_. Then he took and showed me in the streets,\r\nhere one and there two of our enemies, as we chanced to come across\r\nthem, and all the rest our natural allies; and so again running through\r\nthe list of Spartans to be found in the country districts, he still\r\nkept harping on that string: _Look you, on each estate one foeman--the\r\nmaster--and all the rest allies!_' The ephors asked: 'How many do you\r\nreckon are in the secret of the matter?' The informant answered: 'On\r\nthat point also he gave me to understand that there were by no means\r\nmany in their secret who were prime movers of the affair, but those\r\nfew to be depended on; _and to make up_, said he, _we ourselves are in\r\ntheir secret, all the rest of them--Helots, enfranchised, inferiors,\r\nPerioecs, one and all. Note their demeanor when Spartans chance to be\r\nthe topic of their talk. None of them can conceal the delight it would\r\ngive him if he might eat up every Spartan raw._' Then, as the inquiry\r\nwent on, the question came: 'And where did they propose to find arms?'\r\nThe answer followed: 'He explained that those of us, of course, who\r\nare enrolled in regiments have arms of our own already, and as for\r\nthe mass--he led the way to the war foundry, and showed me scores and\r\nscores of knives, of swords, of spits, hatchets, and axes, and reaping\r\nhooks. _Anything or everything_, he told me, _which men use to delve\r\nin the earth, cut timber, or quarry stone, would serve our purpose;\r\nnay, the instruments used for other arts would in nine cases out of ten\r\nfurnish weapons enough and to spare, especially in dealing with unarmed\r\nantagonists_.' Once more being asked what time the affair was to come\r\noff, he replied his orders were _not to leave the city_.\"\r\n\r\nThe ephors, wishing to remove Cinadon from Sparta without suspicion,\r\nsent him on a mission to Aulon. He was to arrest certain persons, and\r\namong them \"a woman, the fashionable beauty of the place--supposed\r\nto be the arch-corruptress of all Lacedæmonians, young and old, who\r\nvisited Aulon.\" His escort seized him instead and wrested from him\r\nthe names of his accomplices. \"His fate was to be taken out forthwith\r\nin irons, just as he was, and to be placed with his two hands and\r\nhis neck in the collar, and so under scourge and goad to be driven,\r\nhimself and his accomplices, round the city. Thus upon the heads of\r\nthose,\" concludes the pious Xenophon, \"was visited the penalty of their\r\noffense.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeset with dangers such as this, the Spartans had to tread warily.\r\nThey drafted Perioecs into their army so as to make it about fifty-six\r\nhundred strong. They picked out Helots, trained and emancipated them,\r\nand used them abroad as soldiers. They took mercenaries into their\r\nservice and distributed them according to local needs under Spartan\r\ncaptains, acting always, however, on requests from local governments.\r\nThey got large contingents of troops from their old allies, whom,\r\nhowever, they left free of tribute, financing their government with a\r\nthousand talents raised annually from the former allies of Athens. With\r\nthe funds thus secured they hired rowers and marines for the warships\r\nwhich their allies furnished and thus patrolled the sea as well as\r\nthe land. They got a moral mandate for empire by upholding everywhere\r\naristocracy, real or sham, against democracy, and by assuming the rôle\r\nof champion of Greece against the barbarians. This did not prevent\r\nthem, however, from forming an alliance with Dionysius I,[42] who had\r\njust made himself tyrant of Syracuse, or from working in harmony with\r\nPersia as long as that was possible.\r\n\r\n\"The growth of Lacedæmon,\" said Timolaus of Corinth[43] in 394 B.C.,\r\n\"seems to me just like that of some mighty river--at its sources small\r\nand easily crossed, but as it further and further advances, other\r\nrivers discharge themselves into its channel, and its stream grows\r\never more formidable. So it is with the Lacedæmonians. Take them at\r\nthe starting-point and they are but a single community, but as they\r\nadvance and attach city after city they grow more numerous and more\r\nresistless. I observe that when people wish to take wasps' nests--if\r\nthey try to capture the creatures on the wing, they are liable to be\r\nattacked by half the hive; whereas, if they apply fire to them ere they\r\nleave their homes, they will master them without scathe themselves. On\r\nthis principle, I think it best to bring about the battle within the\r\nhive itself, or, short of that, as close to Lacedæmon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe advice was sound; but the wasps could not be caught at home. It\r\nwas not till Athens had beaten the Spartans at sea, and Thebes had\r\nbeaten them on land, that Epaminondas reached the hive. He then broke\r\nup the Peloponnesian league, emancipated the Helots of Messenia, and\r\nsubstituted, for the once considerable power which had saved the\r\nPeloponnesus from serious attack for two hundred years, a multitude of\r\nlittle city-states such as existed elsewhere in Greece--rather, such as\r\ncame to exist elsewhere in European Greece, when, a few years later,\r\nwith Epaminondas's death, the supremacy of Thebes ceased, Athens was\r\nabandoned by the states which had joined her against Sparta, and the\r\nempire of Dionysius I in the west dissolved, shortly after his death,\r\ninto its constituent parts.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, conditions should then have been ideal. In the case\r\nof the Greeks the deep-seated human instinct to compare the present\r\ndisadvantageously with the past was not checked by a theory of\r\nevolution conceived as progress, such as misleads many sensible people\r\nnowadays to imagine that the farther back they go the more rudimentary\r\npolitical and social conditions become. The golden age of the Greeks\r\nlay in \"the dark backward and abysm of time.\" In early days, before\r\nthe rise of the Spartan and Athenian empires, every city, so it was\r\nbelieved, had \"lived in peace, free and autonomous, and in secure\r\npossession of its own territory.\" For more than a century men had\r\nstruggled to bring back those blessed times, and now at length their\r\nefforts, it might have seemed, had been crowned with success. Every\r\ncity in Greece, great and small, had apparently regained its liberty\r\nand autonomy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time men had made a persistent effort to reëstablish in\r\neach city \"the constitution of the fathers,\" and under the Spartan\r\nhegemony the favorable opportunity for success in this campaign had\r\nseemingly come. But it then appeared that, apart from the general\r\nunderstanding that citizenship was to be reserved to those who could\r\nafford to pay taxes and provide themselves with the arms and knowledge\r\nof arms necessary for fighting, no two persons agreed as to what the\r\n\"ancestral constitution\" was. It proved to be in reality the ideal of\r\neach reformer and each politician, and since the age was one in which\r\nmost of the ordinary restraints were lacking as they seldom are in\r\nthe history of civilized man, the transition from an unpopular ideal\r\nto a conspiracy was apt to be singularly abrupt. The outcome of the\r\nattempts to restore the urban particularism of mediæval Greece and\r\nthe constitutions of the over-praised olden time was unsatisfactory\r\nto everybody. Barren wars of city against city instead of large\r\nenterprises directed by imperial ambitions; an atmosphere murky with\r\nplots and counter-plots, where once there had blown the strong wind\r\nof steady civic progress; and, in addition, national disaster and\r\nhumiliation despite manifest military superiority--these were the\r\nbitter fruits of political reaction in Greece during the Spartan\r\nsupremacy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was in this unhappy age that the science of government was born,\r\nand it bears its birthmark to the present day. The midwife, to use\r\nhis own homely figure, was Socrates, whom the Athenians, tarred on by\r\nAristophanes, put to death \"for corrupting the youth and introducing\r\nstrange gods.\" He, of course, denied the accusations, and claimed\r\nthat he deserved the honors of a public benefactor for taking men\r\nindividually and showing to them how ill they understood the virtues\r\non which all societies are based, to wit, justice, wisdom, temperance,\r\nand courage. No one, he thought, could make them better citizens except\r\nby promoting truth and dispelling ignorance about these things. His\r\nexecution consecrated his mission. It was the sowing of dragon's teeth\r\nfrom which sprang up armed warriors, of whom the most doughty were\r\nPlato and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe vice of the Socratic school was a noble one--an enormous\r\noverestimate of the value of education. \"Truth is the beginning of\r\nevery good thing,\" says Plato,[44] \"both to gods and men; and he who\r\nwould be blessed and happy, should be from the first a partaker of\r\nthe truth, that he may live a true man as long as possible, for then\r\nhe can be trusted; but he is not to be trusted who loves voluntary\r\nfalsehood and he who loves involuntary falsehood is a fool.\" There was,\r\nof course, only one truth; which, being discovered, should be taught;\r\nwhich, being taught, must be acted upon, since, if men really knew what\r\nwas right, it was impossible, Plato thought--ignoring the frailty or\r\nobstinacy of the human will--that they should not do it. \"Discover the\r\ntruth.\" \"Teach it.\" These are the two Socratic commandments.\r\n\r\nI have no intention to make an exposition of the political philosophy\r\nof Plato and Aristotle,[45] but to do something much more modest: to\r\nexplain wherein and wherefore they missed the truth in the matter of\r\nGreek imperialism, and to notice some of the historic forces which they\r\ndisregarded. If I deal with the _Laws_ rather than the _Republic_ of\r\nPlato, it is because it is his more mature and less imaginative work.\r\n\r\nIt was upon his immediate present that Plato focused his attention;\r\nto the analysis of its political and moral strength and weakness that\r\nhe turned his penetrating intelligence; for its betterment that he\r\nwrote and taught and suffered. The past he peopled with creations\r\nof his own exuberant fancy, of popular misconception, of defective\r\nknowledge. He can be easily convicted of gross historical errors. And\r\nwhat is more serious; he has no real regard for historical truth and\r\nno sense whatever for the real factors in historical developments.\r\nWithout the slightest qualm of conscience, and without taking the least\r\npains to ascertain the facts, Plato alters the divine and profane\r\nhistory of his people to make it serve his purpose. And he does this\r\non principle: \"The legislator,\" he says,[46] \"has only to reflect and\r\nfind out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage, and\r\nthen use all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and\r\nthe same word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life\r\nlong.\" To disagreeable things in the sacred story he gives a short\r\nshrift. Since the gods are perfect, every report that tends to tarnish\r\nthe lustre of their reputation must be false. The history of mankind\r\nis solved by a similar formula; since justice is the _sine qua non_ of\r\npublic and private prosperity and happiness, all reports which affirm\r\nthe conjunction of injustice with well-being, or of righteousness with\r\nmisfortune, need correction or suppression.[47] History, accordingly,\r\nbecomes a happy hunting-ground for edifying stories. It at once ceases\r\nto yield lessons, which, being grounded in the realities of human\r\nexperience, are less apropos, perhaps, than the political theorist may\r\nlike, but are alone valuable.\r\n\r\nPlato's absorption in the present led him to misread not only the past,\r\nbut also the future. For the false standard with which he measured\r\npast policies and institutions is not less characteristic than the\r\nfalse judgment which he formed of the drift of contemporary events.\r\nThe future belonged, not, as he dreamed, to the autonomous, archaizing\r\ncity-state, but to the movement for their unification which he\r\ncondemned. He tried to mend city constitutions when the world required\r\nthe creation of larger territorial states. He watched with attention\r\ndomestic politics when foreign politics were chiefly worth watching.\r\n\r\nA glance at the ideal state portrayed by Plato in the _Laws_[48] shows\r\nin what sense he read his history. His citizens are to have \"their\r\nfood and clothing provided for them in moderation,\" the latter through\r\n\"entrusting the practice of the arts to others,\" the former through\r\ngetting from the land, which slaves till for a part of the produce, \"a\r\nreturn sufficient for men living temperately.\" They are to have \"common\r\ntables in which the men are placed apart, and near them are the common\r\ntables of their families, of their daughters and mothers, which, day\r\nby day, the officers, male and female, are to inspect.\" They are not,\r\nhowever, to live fattening like beasts; for \"such a life is neither\r\njust nor honorable, nor can he who lives it fail of meeting his due;\r\nand the due reward of the idle fatted beast is that he should be torn\r\nto pieces by some other valiant beast whose fatness is worn down by\r\nbrave deeds and toil.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, Plato does not wish his ideal citizens to meet such an\r\nignominious end. He proceeds to prescribe a régime for them in which,\r\nafter a most carefully nurtured childhood, three years are spent on\r\nreading and writing, three more on learning to play the lyre, and\r\nothers still on the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and law,\r\nand on the practice of dancing, wrestling, running, hunting, and many\r\nkinds of military exercises. The citizens to be protected from fatty\r\ndegeneration in this way are, it should be observed, the women as well\r\nas the men.\r\n\r\nThe children's stories are prescribed and are unalterable; so are the\r\nmusic and the dancing and the poetry. The law studied is that of the\r\ncommonwealth, with which every citizen is to be inoculated. The moral\r\nand religious ideas are to be fixed, and death is the penalty set for\r\nheterodoxy. Everything is to be made and kept rigid, the number of the\r\nhouses, of the farms, of the citizens, of the children, of traders,\r\nartisans, and foreigners, the maximum and minimum wealth of everybody.\r\nIn other words, the community which Plato in his old age proposed as a\r\nmodel is not a thorough-going communism, like that of his more youthful\r\nand more famous _Republic_. It is simply a system of governmental\r\ncontrol carried to its logical extreme--an emended and perfected\r\nedition of Sparta.\r\n\r\nThat a well-born Athenian, disgusted at the license which resulted from\r\nletting people live as they pleased, should have planned to put all\r\ncitizens in an administrative strait-jacket, is not surprising. Many of\r\nus to-day object to a \"wide-open town.\" But that Plato, whose practice\r\nin discussion was \"to follow the argument whithersoever it might\r\nlead,\" should have idealized a state in which freedom of thought and\r\nfreedom of speech were denied altogether, shows (even if we make all\r\nallowances for the idea, that, if things were perfect and there was but\r\none perfection, all changes must be harmful) how unreal and involved in\r\nself-contradiction was the thinking of the best Greeks in this age of\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nThe theory of individual liberty, as applied in Athens, had led, in\r\nthe economic sphere, thought Plato, to the exploitation of the poor\r\nby the rich, and, in the political sphere, to the exploitation of the\r\nrich by the poor. Plato, therefore, discarded the theory of individual\r\nliberty altogether. He was dominated by a general view of life in which\r\nall the natural human instincts and cravings were harmful. The only\r\nhope for states was that they should educate their best citizens to be\r\ntheir governors. Plato, accordingly, nailed to the mast the doctrine\r\nof salvation by education, and despaired of all states in which the\r\ncarefully trained few of high intellectual capacity did not make the\r\nlaws and enforce them. Of all these ideas the Athenian democracy was\r\nthe negation, and Plato hated it with the bitterness of a passionate\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThat Plato hated the Periclean democracy as a political system is also\r\nintelligible from his hatred of imperialism upon which it was based;\r\nand there are those to-day, who, for the same reason and also because\r\nof a mistaken notion of its dependence upon slavery, find Athenian\r\ndemocracy justified, if at all, by its fruits; who contemplate its art\r\nand literature with the same mingled feelings with which they view\r\nthe hectic beauty of the consumptive. Plato is not of their company.\r\nThe fruits he finds even more deleterious than the stock which bore\r\nthem. \"In music,\" he writes,[49] meaning thereby poetry interpreted\r\nby the voice with musical accompaniment,--\"in music it was that\r\nthere first arose the universal conceit of omniscience and general\r\nlawlessness;--freedom came following afterwards, and men, fancying\r\nthat they knew what they did not know, had no longer any fear, and the\r\nabsence of fear begets shamelessness. For what is this shamelessness,\r\nwhich is so evil a thing, but the insolent refusal to regard the\r\nopinion of the better by reason of an over-daring sort of liberty?\"\r\nWhereto the Spartan who is his interlocutor says: \"Very true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consequent upon this freedom,\" continues the speaker, \"comes the\r\nother freedom, of disobedience to rulers; and then the attempt to\r\nescape the control and exhortation of father, mother, elders, and\r\nwhen near the end, the control of the laws also; and at the very end\r\nthere is the contempt of oaths and pledges, and no regard at all for\r\nthe gods,--herein they exhibit and imitate the old so-called Titanic\r\nnature, and come to the same point as the Titans when they rebelled\r\nagainst God, leading a life of endless evils.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern critic, even if he endorses the sharp indictment of\r\nEuripides, the poet of the most radical democracy,--that he destroyed\r\nthe character of Attic tragedy by introducing into it elements from\r\nmelodrama and the operatic concert, by perverting the grand style of\r\nits text and music by vulgar flippancies and incongruous measures,\r\nby substituting for artistic development of characters and plot\r\ndisturbing discussions of the woman question and the latest sensations\r\nin philosophy and science, by turning the ancient gods and heroes\r\ninto burlesque through having them argue and act like contemporary\r\nsycophants and sophists,--the modern critic, even Professor Shorey,[50]\r\nfor example, in his spirited defense of the Sophoclean drama, would\r\nabandon Plato, I fancy, when he makes the drama the fundamental cause\r\nfor the decline of Athenian greatness.\r\n\r\nIn his _Laws_, Plato is dealing with what, chastened by age and\r\nexperience, he regarded as correctible things. The lust for private\r\npossessions, for land and home, wife and children, he once placed in\r\nthis category, but he does so no longer; and in other respects he makes\r\nwide concessions to human frailties. With greed for wealth, however,\r\nhe concluded no truce. It is Greeks, mark you, of whom Plato[51] says:\r\n\"Love of wealth wholly absorbs men, and never for a moment allows them\r\nto think of anything but their own private possessions; on this the\r\nsoul of every citizen hangs suspended, and can attend to nothing but\r\nhis daily gain. Mankind are ready to learn any branch of knowledge,\r\nand to follow any pursuit which tends to this end, and they laugh at\r\nevery other.... From an insatiate love of gold and silver, every man\r\nwill stoop to any art or contrivance, seemly or unseemly, in the hope\r\nof becoming rich; and will make no objection to performing any action,\r\nholy or unholy and utterly base, if only like a beast he have the power\r\nof eating and drinking all kinds of things, and procuring for himself\r\nin every sort of way the gratifications of his lusts.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the evil conditions of the present when one citizen despoiled\r\nhis fellow and every city its neighbor. It had been different in\r\nthe past. Before the introduction of luxurious tastes to stimulate\r\ninventions and of coined money to destroy a sense for the natural\r\nlimits of wealth, men had \"worked in summer, commonly, stripped and\r\nbarefoot,[52] but in winter substantially clothed and shod. They fed\r\non barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making\r\nnoble cakes and loaves; these they served up on a mat of reeds or on\r\nclean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew\r\nor myrtle. And they and their children feasted, drinking of the wine\r\nwhich they had made, wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning the\r\npraises of the gods, in happy converse with one another. They took\r\ncare that their families did not exceed their means: having an eye to\r\npoverty or war.\" But it was not to an age of such rude simplicity that\r\nPlato would recall his contemporaries. He would, indeed, restore the\r\nvirtues which existed among the early country folk before the rise\r\nof modern cities and the establishment of the capitalistic régime;\r\nbut, while hostile to transmarine commerce, retail trade, industries,\r\nbanking, interest, and all other accompaniments of interchange between\r\ncities, which he regarded as generally undesirable and provocative of\r\nwars and conquests, he imagines his ideal people in possession of city\r\nculture and the articles of luxury and convenience secured through\r\nthe capitalistic organization. His citizens are, indeed, farmers, but\r\nthey are gentlemen farmers, who have their money invested in land and\r\nslaves and live on their dividends, free to devote their leisure to\r\nathletic, intellectual, and other worthy pursuits. They will be free\r\nfrom greed of wealth because they all possess a competency, which Plato\r\ndefines as enough to live \"temperately,\" Aristotle as enough to live\r\n\"with liberality and temperance.\" Neither philosopher thinks of poverty\r\nexcept as the ordainer of body- and soul-destroying work, work which\r\ndegrades those who have to perform it, and makes slavery their natural\r\ncondition. Plato and Aristotle would make all tillers of the soil and\r\nworkers at the trades and crafts slaves and aliens. They were to exist\r\nsimply to provide the conditions of \"good living\" for their masters\r\nor superiors; whereupon \"we must not conceal from ourselves,\" says\r\nAristotle,[53] \"that a country as large as the Babylonian or some other\r\nof boundless extent will be required if it is to support five thousand\r\ncitizens in idleness.\" Even in America, where, to use the current\r\nformula, ten per cent of the people own ninety per cent of the wealth,\r\nthe economic situation proposed as ideal by the most enlightened\r\nreformers of the fourth century B.C. has hardly been reached. Whether\r\nPlato failed to realize that he was condemning nine tenths of people\r\nto perpetual bondage and ignorance; or, realizing it, refused to think\r\nof anything but the perfection of the few, the conclusion is alike\r\ninevitable: he had failed miserably to trace to their historical causes\r\nboth the cultural barrenness of Sparta and the astounding fertility of\r\nhis own Athens.\r\n\r\nHad Aristotle lived in the commonwealth of Plato's _Laws_, he must\r\nhave suffered the same fate that Socrates suffered in Athens. For,\r\nthough far from ungrateful to his teacher, he was not a docile pupil.\r\nBy birth he was a Stagirite, by experience a citizen of the world. He\r\ndid not, like Plato, form his youthful impressions in a milieu that\r\nwas poisoned with bitterness at a demoralized democracy. The Athens\r\nto which he came as a lad of seventeen was still a democracy, and a\r\nvery unhealthy one at that, and for it he had little liking; but his\r\nwas a more dispassionate nature than was Plato's. He was not a great\r\nhistorian.[54] _That_ the discovery in Egypt in 1890 of one of his many\r\nlost historical works has proven clearly; but he was a very learned\r\nman, and perhaps came to as close a comprehension of earlier Greek\r\nhistory as was possible for a political philosopher who had nothing to\r\nguide him but the unscientific methods then in vogue for investigating\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nBy its very nature science is objective. It is not inhuman, but it is\r\ndeliberately impersonal. In this respect it contrasts sharply with the\r\narts. The greatest artist may be the man who embodies in his verse or\r\nstone or colors moods and thoughts which must be in \"widest commonalty\r\nspread,\" but which constitute in the aggregate his own self or soul.\r\nHistory is of course a science, but not one of the common type. Unlike\r\nthe ordinary scientist, the scientific historian has to practice, not\r\nself-suppression, but self-expansion. He must become conscious, so far\r\nas that is possible, of the prejudices and special interests of his\r\nown age, and, divested of them, he must migrate into a strange land\r\nin order to bring back thence a report that is at once an unbiased\r\naccount of what he has seen and a story that is comprehensible to his\r\nfellow-citizens, or, at least, to his fellow-historians. He dare not\r\ntreat the past as one in spirit with the present, or as resolvable\r\ninto precisely the same factors. He must be alive to the existence of\r\nmany different pasts leading to the present in no pre-determinable\r\nsuccession, much less progression. The points must make a line, but the\r\nline may be of any conceivable curve. Aristotle was far from arriving\r\nat a full appreciation of the difficulties of historical inquiry; but,\r\nunlike Plato, he took infinite pains to acquire historical knowledge.\r\n\r\nHe did not idealize the constitutions of the olden times. Since all men\r\nthen carried daggers, the presumption, he says, is that they needed\r\nthem and used them. Since conditions where violence reigned must have\r\ncontinued indefinitely, if political change had been prohibited, he\r\nfinds it good as well as inevitable that laws be modified from time to\r\ntime. The permanency of those of Sparta is worthy of high praise; but\r\nhe traces the corruption and decay of the Spartan state to failure to\r\nmake needed reforms. In general he strikes a much more just balance\r\nbetween Spartan and Athenian achievement than does Plato.\r\n\r\nThe first test he applies to institutions, such as the family and the\r\nstate, is their naturalness--their source in the nature of man as that\r\nis revealed in his history. He was well aware that a political science\r\nthat was based upon _perfected_ human nature was, indeed, suited only\r\nfor \"gods and sons of gods\"; that the only principles of government\r\nwhich had real value were those which had approved themselves in\r\npractice. \"All discoveries,\" he says,[55] \"have been already made,\r\nalthough in some cases they have not been combined, and in others, when\r\nmade, are not acted upon.\" \"The _Politics_ of Aristotle,\" says a recent\r\nwriter, \"is the one great book on the science of government because it\r\nis the only one which is wholly empirical.\"\r\n\r\nThat is too high praise. For the _Politics_ of Aristotle differs\r\nfrom the _Prince_ of Machiavelli in other respects, of course, but\r\nnoticeably in that the Greek has moral ideals, the Italian none.\r\nWith Aristotle, as with Plato, the state has an ethical purpose. He\r\nrequires it to justify not only its acts but its existence. Iniquitous\r\ngovernments might exist,--Aristotle's world was full of them, in\r\nfact,--and his mind was too curious of all things political for him to\r\nleave them out of his observation: he has, indeed, considered minutely\r\nthe ways and means for the preservation of all kinds of states, and\r\nhas shown therein that he had as keen an eye for the realities as\r\nhad Machiavelli himself. But he would never have permitted, much\r\nless advised, his legislator to use foul means to establish a just\r\ngovernment or fair means to establish an unjust one.\r\n\r\nOn the establishment of governments, moreover, he spends very little\r\nthought. This, however, is with Machiavelli the main matter, as he\r\nhimself says near the opening of the second part of his work: \"The\r\nchief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are\r\ngood laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws where the\r\nstate is not well armed, it follows that when they are well armed\r\nthey have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion\r\nand shall speak of the arms.\" Had the Greek heard him he would have\r\nscoffed at both the argument and the conclusion. The argument is, of\r\ncourse, sophistical, and the conclusion saved only by the fact that\r\nMachiavelli had already considered the political weapons with which\r\nrulers should operate. The _Politics_ is a handbook for legislators;\r\nthe _Prince_ a set of instructions for potentates. For the latter the\r\nways and means of _acquiring_ power was, in Machiavelli's judgment, the\r\nall-important thing; whereas the legislator's possession of power is\r\ntaken for granted by Aristotle, and it is assumed throughout his entire\r\ntreatment that, if the lawgiver knows the constitution, the laws, and\r\nthe system of education which are best adapted to the economic, social,\r\nand political conditions of his state, he can at once introduce them.\r\n\r\nIn a measure, therefore, the _Prince_ and the _Politics_ supplement\r\neach other, though Aristotle would have been horrified at the idea.\r\nFor in his thinking, in anything approximating to an ideal world, each\r\ncity was free to order its internal affairs as it thought best, and,\r\nhaving this liberty, if it was shown what was best, it must, according\r\nto the Socratic psychology, immediately adopt it; whereas--to give the\r\ndevil his due--Machiavelli was actuated, in formulating his precepts\r\nfor Prince Lorenzo, by the vision of a united Italy, the realization of\r\nwhich by his pupil was to wash away the crimes committed in subjecting\r\nto his will the city-states of the peninsula. The conquest of Italy\r\nwas, accordingly, the goal of the ideal Prince's endeavor; whereas,\r\nthough Aristotle in one passage of the _Politics_[56] notes that \"if\r\nthe Greeks were united in a single polity they would be capable of\r\nuniversal empire,\" he regards such a union as highly undesirable. To\r\nhim a state that was not a city was a rudimentary and very imperfect\r\nstate. It ceased to be a state at all when it ceased to be free.\r\nHence a city could have subjects, that is to say, slaves, but not\r\ndependencies. And since in his thinking it was natural inferiority\r\nalone that justified slavery, and this was found especially among the\r\nnations of Asia, and not at all in Greece, no Greek city could rightly\r\nenslave the inhabitants of any other Greek city: it could wage war and\r\norganize slave raids only against barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe birthmark which we have noted on Plato is an inheritance from\r\nunreasoning hatred of democracy. That which mars above all the\r\npolitical thinking of Aristotle comes from the aversion instinctively\r\nfelt by his age for imperialism. That this, too, is a disfigurement,\r\nwe may show in a few concluding remarks. \"It is necessary,\" says\r\nAristotle[57] in concluding his plea that a mixed constitution is best\r\nfor the common run of states, \"it is necessary to begin by assuming\r\na principle of general application, viz., that the part of the state\r\nwhich desires the continuance of the polity ought to be stronger than\r\nthat which does not\"; and he proceeds to point out that \"strength\"\r\nconsists neither in numbers, nor property, nor military or political\r\nability alone, but in all of them combined, so that regard has to\r\nbe taken of \"freedom, wealth, culture, and nobility, as well as of\r\nmere numerical superiority.\" Nothing could be more cold and objective\r\nthan the thinking of Aristotle on this important matter. Yet by an\r\nextraordinary oversight he lets \"strength\" exert a decisive influence\r\n_within_ the city-states, while he ignores altogether the effect of\r\nvarying population, wealth, and political and military ability in\r\ndetermining the relations _between_ them.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the political thinking of Aristotle is dominated by the\r\nidea that the world of men is made up of an infinite procession of\r\ninferiors and superiors, the desire to forge ahead being one of the\r\nmost fundamental instincts of human beings. If an omniscient God were\r\nto arrange the inhabitants of each city in a line according to their\r\nreal \"strength,\" he would place few of them abreast. No Greek betrays\r\nmore naïvely than Aristotle does the national consciousness of the\r\nHellenes that they stood at the head of the honor roll of peoples. It\r\nwas, therefore, imperative upon them to conquer the Asiatics; for he\r\nfinds it to be a beneficent command of nature, issued primarily for the\r\nadvantage of the weaker, that superiors should rule inferiors.\r\n\r\nAmong moral philosophers Aristotle is characterized by his refusal\r\nto let himself be led astray by a visionary ideal of human equality.\r\nNevertheless, while recognizing that Greek cities, even more than\r\nindividuals, differed in \"strength,\" he refused to let the \"strong\"\r\nuse their advantage. He sets apart the sphere of interurban, that\r\nis to say, international, relations as one in which the \"universal\r\nprinciple,\" that superior rule inferior, shall not apply. In a\r\nvisionary world, the \"strong\" man, on Aristotle's theory, is a \"gentle\"\r\nman; but in the real world, he is a ruler. Had Aristotle not been\r\nblinded by the prejudices of his age against imperialism, he must have\r\nseen the necessity that in the real world the \"strong\" state would\r\nalso be the ruler. It is one of the enigmas of history that Aristotle\r\nwas the contemporary and subject of Philip II of Macedon, one of its\r\nironies that he was the tutor of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n 1.

His mother, Olympias, was a\r\nhalf-civilized Molossian princess whose fresh beauty, revealed at a\r\nwild religious fête on mystic Samothrace, had caught the roving fancy\r\nof Philip of Macedon. Their union had the further attraction to Philip\r\nthat it might bring Epirus under his suzerainty.\r\n\r\nPhilip wished his wife to be his chief concubine rather than his\r\nconsort. Olympias, a proud and passionate woman, chafed at her\r\nhusband's marital infidelities, and had the will and courage to revolt\r\nand act for herself when Philip set her aside in 337 B.C. She cannot be\r\nacquitted of guilty knowledge of the murder of Philip which occurred a\r\nyear later at the marriage arranged by him between her daughter and her\r\nbrother. The act was timed to assure the accession of her son, who was\r\nits chief beneficiary.\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" Alexander is reported to have said twelve years later to\r\nhis mutinous Macedonian soldiers,[58] \"found you nomadic and poor.\r\nClad in sheepskins, you tended your meagre herds on the mountains, and\r\nhad to fight grievously for them against the Illyrians, Triballi,\r\nand Thracians on your borders. He gave you cloaks to wear in place of\r\nhides, he led you down from the hills into the plains, he made you\r\nthe match in battle of the barbarians who dwelt near you; so that you\r\ndepended for your safety thenceforth, not on the inaccessibility of\r\nyour country, but on your own valor. He taught you to live in cities;\r\nhe appointed good laws and customs for your governance. He made you\r\nlords, instead of slaves and subjects of those barbarians by whom\r\nyou and your possessions had long been harried. The greatest part of\r\nThrace he annexed to Macedon. By seizing the most suitable points on\r\nthe seacoast, he threw open your country to commerce. He gave you the\r\nchance to work your mines in safety. The Thessalians, before whom\r\nyou had cowered, half dead with fright, he taught you to conquer,\r\nand by humbling the Phocians he made your road into Greece, hitherto\r\nnarrow and difficult, broad and easy. To such a degree did he lower\r\nthe Athenians and the Thebans, who had ever been ready to fall upon\r\nMacedon,--and herein had he my help,--that, instead of your paying\r\ntribute to Athens and taking orders from Thebes, it was to us in turn\r\nthat they went for protection. Into the Peloponnesus he passed and set\r\nmatters to rights there; and, being appointed commander-in-chief of\r\nunited Greece in its projected war against Persia, he achieved this\r\nhigh distinction, not so much for himself as for the commonwealth of\r\nMacedonia.\"\r\n\r\nThe words are not those of the great king himself: they are at the\r\nbest a paraphrase of the ideas expressed by him on the occasion; at\r\nthe worst they are the free invention of an historian concerned only\r\nwith having Alexander say what the situation seemed to him to demand.\r\nHowever that may be, they are a good account of the wonderful work\r\nwhich Alexander, as a boy and young man, saw his father accomplish\r\nfor Macedon. \"What a man we had to fight,\" said Demosthenes,[59] his\r\ngreat enemy. \"For the sake of power and dominion he had an eye put\r\nout, his shoulder broken, an arm and a leg injured. Whatever limb\r\nfortune demanded, that he gave up, so that the remnant of his body\r\nmight live in glory and honor.\" \"Taking everything into account,\" says\r\nTheopompus,[60] the far from generous contemporary historian of his\r\nachievements, \"Europe has never produced the like of Philip, the son of\r\nAmyntas.\"\r\n\r\nThe court of Philip was rough and boorish. Revels, disgraced by\r\ndrunkenness and debauchery, interrupted the king's wars and amours.\r\nIn Pella men behaved like Centaurs and Læstrygonians, sneered the\r\nfastidious Athenians; and the frenzy which wine inspired in Philip,\r\nreligion inspired in Olympias. In wild abandon she let herself be\r\npossessed with the spirit of the god, Dionysus, and roamed the hills at\r\nnight in the company of other women equally intoxicated, brandishing\r\nthe thyrsus and the \"wreathèd snake,\" shouting with ecstasy. Hers\r\nwas the religion which William Vaughn Moody, with poetic license,\r\nsingled out in the splendid _Prelude_ to his _Masque of Judgment_ as\r\ncharacteristic of the world into which Christ was born. It was really\r\nabhorrent to the best Greek feeling, and was repressed with stern\r\ncruelty by Rome.\r\n\r\nPassion, fierce and generous, the main source of heroic action, was\r\nbred in the bone of Alexander. His imagination, naturally fervent, was\r\nfed by tales of his ancestor Achilles which he heard at his mother's\r\nknee, and fired by the vistas opened out to it by the exploits of\r\nhis father. At thirteen Philip gave him Aristotle as his tutor, and\r\nduring the formative years of his youth he studied poetry with this\r\ngreat teacher. The poetry was Greek, not Macedonian. In it were found\r\nthe ideals of the people to which Alexander belonged in spirit and\r\nin blood, if not in nationality; thence came the ideas tinged with\r\nemotion which fasten themselves like barbed arrows in the memory of\r\nthe learner--the ideas of right and wrong, of heroism and tenderness,\r\nof regard for parents and for duties; as Plato would say, of justice,\r\nwisdom, temperance, and courage--which color all subsequent thinking\r\nand constitute character. The Greeks have still something to teach us\r\nas to the educative power of great poetry.\r\n\r\nThe commandments of Homer, whom Aristotle never ceases to cite in his\r\nphilosophical works, went over into the flesh and blood of Alexander,\r\nand in him Achilles, the youthful hero of the Iliad, became in a real\r\nsense incarnate. Next after Homer, Alexander rated and knew the Attic\r\ntragedians, the continuators and improvers of Homer, according to\r\nAristotle, who, therefore, bases his _Poetics_ largely upon tragedy, as\r\nbeing the highest form of dramatic art.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question of the influence of Aristotle in determining\r\nthe literary interest and taste of Alexander. It seems also clear\r\nthat the young prince came at least to know, and probably to share,\r\nhis teacher's curiosity as to natural history; for he afterwards sent\r\nspecimens back from Asia for Aristotle's botanical and zoölogical\r\ncollections. This being the case, it seems incredible that he should\r\nhave received from him no instruction in politics; that Aristotle, the\r\npupil of Plato, who had himself gone to Sicily to educate the young\r\nDionysius II for his high place, should have failed to communicate\r\nto the future ruler of Macedon and of Greece the ideas which he had\r\nformed as to the best kind of government. We can imagine the thousand\r\nopportunities which their three years of close association in the\r\ncountry seat at Mieza offered for the discussion of politics: how\r\nAristotle explained that virtue or merit or political capacity, or\r\nhowever the elusive Greek word _arete_ be translated, gave the best\r\nclaim to leadership, and that the best of all forms of government\r\nwas that in which the man of the highest virtue ruled; \"that,\" to\r\nuse his own words,[61] \"wherever there is, as it happens, a whole\r\nfamily or an individual so superior in virtue to all the rest that\r\nthe virtue of this individual or family exceeds that of all others in\r\nthe state, in that case it is but just that this family should enjoy\r\na regal or supreme position and that this individual should be king.\r\nFor ... this is not only in accordance with the principle of justice\r\nusually alleged by the founders of polities, whether aristocracies,\r\noligarchies, or democracies, in all of which the claim to rule is\r\ndependent on superiority, although the superiority is not the same;\r\nbut it accords also with the theory we laid down before. For assuredly\r\nit is not proper to put to death or outlaw or even ostracize this\r\npreëminent individual or to require him to become a subject in his\r\nturn.... The only alternative is that they should yield him obedience,\r\nand that he should be supreme, not on the principle of alternation,\r\nbut absolutely.... It will be a wrong,\" he urged,[62] \"to treat him as\r\nworthy of mere equality, when he is so vastly superior in virtue and\r\npolitical capacity, for any person so exceptional may well be compared\r\nto a deity upon the earth.\" Again and again, in season and out of\r\nseason, often doubtless to the annoyance of the impatient young prince,\r\nwho feared lest his father's victories should leave him nothing to do,\r\nAristotle[63] must have harped on the theme that \"man is naturally a\r\ncity-dwelling animal and that one who is not a native of a city, if\r\nthe cause of his isolation be natural and not accidental, is either\r\na superhuman being or low in the scale of civilization, as he stands\r\nalone like a 'blot' on the backgammon board. The 'clanless, lawless,\r\nhearthless' man so bitterly described by Homer is a case in point; for\r\nhe is naturally a native of no city and a lover of war.\" We can imagine\r\nthe philosopher insisting that just as city life was synonymous with\r\ncivilized life, so city was synonymous with state; that the highest\r\nof all human activities, the exercise of political functions, was\r\ndestroyed the moment a city became dependent upon an outside power;\r\nthat subjects could not exist permanently unless the conquered were\r\nnatural inferiors like the Asiatics; that it was, however, to the\r\ninterest of such persons that they should be ruled by their superiors,\r\nin the case of Asiatics, by the Greeks. Such were the oft-repeated\r\nmaxims of the political philosopher in whose age Philip rejoiced, it\r\nis said,[64] \"that his son was born, since his teaching would make\r\nhim worthy of his father and equal to the position to which he was to\r\nsucceed.\" Such was the literary and political education of Alexander:\r\nhis military training and his knowledge of affairs he got in the\r\nunrivaled school of his father; but in this connection it is well to\r\nremember the admission of Napoleon:[65] \"War is a singular art; I can\r\nassure you that fighting sixty battles taught me nothing I did not know\r\nat the first one. The essential quality of the general is firmness,\r\nand that is a gift from heaven.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to give a biographical sketch of Alexander, nor\r\nyet to tell the story of his marvelous conquests, or to estimate the\r\nconsequences of his work on the later course of history. I have had in\r\nmind while preparing this chapter first to emphasize such features in\r\nhis family and education as help to explain his political thinking, and\r\nthen, somewhat in Plutarch's fashion, to pick up such incidents in his\r\ncareer as show concretely how precisely he aimed to organize his world\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhere the political sagacity of Alexander stood forth most\r\nconspicuously, according to Napoleon, was in the skill with which he\r\nappealed to the imagination of men. Love of symbolism was ingrained\r\nin his nature. By an act which he went deliberately out of his way to\r\nperform he contrived again and again to illumine an entire situation,\r\nto drive home a lesson, to reveal a policy. In a way it was a kind\r\nof advertising; a means of conveying to the world at large in an\r\nunmistakable manner the will and attitude of the monarch. But it was\r\nmore than that. It was the application in the world of politics of a\r\nmode of expression with which the Greeks were familiar in the world of\r\nthe plastic arts.\r\n\r\nThe first instance of this sort of thing was the destruction of Thebes\r\nin 335 B.C. At the accession of Alexander a year earlier, all Greece\r\nhad seethed with insurrection. Philip was dead in the full vigor of\r\nmanhood, and a stripling of twenty was about to take his place. By a\r\nprompt advance southward Alexander nipped the threatened revolt in the\r\nbud; and to secure himself for the future, he put a garrison in the\r\ncitadel of Thebes, where the most manifest disaffection had existed.\r\nA few months later, however, while he was cleansing his northern\r\nfrontiers, preparatory to attacking Persia, the Thebans, acting on the\r\nfalse report that he had fallen in battle, and in conjunction with\r\nAthens and other Greek cities, revolted a second time. With almost\r\nincredible secrecy and celerity Alexander came upon Thebes, took it by\r\nassault, sold the inhabitants into slavery, and razed the city to the\r\nground. No such disaster had overtaken a Greek city (outside of unhappy\r\nSicily) since the destruction of Miletus by the Persians in 493 B.C.\r\nIt showed beyond the shadow of a doubt what the Greeks had to expect\r\nif they continued to make trouble while Alexander was absent in Asia.\r\nAnd on this occasion one object lesson was contained within another:\r\nby sparing the house of Pindar, the destroyer of Thebes proclaimed his\r\nregard for Hellenic civilization; distinguished himself clearly from\r\nthe destroyers of Miletus and other barbarians.\r\n\r\nNext year, when about to open his attack on the Persian empire,\r\nAlexander sent his army across the Hellespont by the usual route\r\nfrom Sestus to Abydus; but he himself proceeded to Elaius where he\r\nsacrificed at the tomb of Protesilaus, and prayed that he might have\r\na better fate than was his who first of Agamemnon's men set foot\r\non the soil of Asia. Then crossing the Hellespont to Harbor of the\r\nAchæans, he went up to Ilium where he dedicated his armor to Athena\r\nIlias and took in its place some weapons said to have been used in the\r\nTrojan War. After appeasing the _manes_ of Priam and entreating them\r\nto forgive him, a descendant of Neoptolemus, Priam's slayer, he laid\r\na wreath on the tomb of Achilles, while his bosom friend, Hephæstion,\r\nlaid another on that of Patroclus. Whereupon he proceeded to rejoin\r\nhis army. The incident stirred in every Greek a thousand memories. He\r\nsaw another Agamemnon set out to take another Troy; another champion\r\nof the Hellenes in their eternal struggle with the peoples of Asia. In\r\nno way could Alexander more clearly identify his undertaking with the\r\nlong cherished dreams of the whole Greek race. It was the nearest that\r\na ruler of that time could come to proclaiming a holy war.\r\n\r\nAt Gordium, where Alexander's troops spent their first winter in\r\nAsia, there stood on the citadel the cart in which, according to the\r\nstory, Midas, a peasant's son, had driven to the meeting-place of\r\nthe Phrygians on the day when unexpectedly he was proclaimed their\r\nking. The legend had spread thence around the country that whosoever\r\nunfastened the knot of cornel bark which held the yoke to the shaft\r\nof this cart would become king of Asia. This task Alexander essayed\r\nin vain. Then he drew his sword and cut the thong in two. Thereby he\r\nannounced both his departure from the policy of Philip, which had been\r\nsimply to emancipate the Ionian Greeks, and the forthcoming execution\r\nof his own policy, which was to take from the Persians their dominion\r\nover Asia.\r\n\r\nAfter his first victory at the Granicus River Alexander advanced along\r\nthe Ægean seaboard as far as Cilicia, securing as he went all the coast\r\ntowns in Asia Minor which had contributed ships to the Persian fleet.\r\nThis plan of campaign he adhered to after his second victory at Issus\r\nover Darius, when, instead of keeping in touch with his defeated enemy\r\nand of following him into the interior, as the ordinary common sense\r\nof war commanded, he let the King go, and spent a year in seizing the\r\nnaval towns between Cilicia and Cyrene. This he did in order to destroy\r\nthe Persian fleet, an end which he could not otherwise attain, since he\r\nhad no ships of his own. To leave the enemy's fleet in possession of\r\nthe Mediterranean, however, while he was campaigning far in the heart\r\nof the continent would have been to jeopardize all that he had already\r\naccomplished, and, in particular, to leave to the Persians the means\r\nof causing a general insurrection among the Greeks, whom he rightly\r\nfeared more than the Persians. This long détour southward to Egypt\r\nis, accordingly, amply explained by sound strategical considerations.\r\nThat, however, cannot be said of Alexander's sensational march through\r\nthe Sahara to the oasis of Siwah in the hinterland of Cyrene. There,\r\nin mysterious aloofness, lay an oracle of the Egyptian Ammon whom the\r\nGreeks called Zeus. Just as Dodona in Epirus had been eclipsed in times\r\npast as an oracular seat by the shrine of Apollo at Delphi, so this in\r\nturn had waned in prestige and credit when it became known gradually\r\nto the Greeks that Zeus Ammon revealed unfailingly the future to his\r\npriests at Siwah. For more than two generations prior to Alexander's\r\nvisit the Ammonium had been the Mecca of pilgrims, and the recipient of\r\ngifts from all parts of the Greek world. Athens had even built a sacred\r\ntrireme, the so-called \"ship of Ammon,\" to carry public messengers to\r\nand from the oracle. In Egypt the Ammon of Siwah was of no account as\r\ncompared with the Ammon of Thebes; but among the Greeks the Ammon that\r\nwas known and revered was, to speak with Plato, the Ammon of Cyrene.\r\nAlexander knew well the impression which would be produced in the\r\nofficial and pious world of Hellas should the priests of Ammon greet\r\nhim as the son of their god. This, however, they were bound to do on\r\nhis arrival at the temple, since to omit this formality would have been\r\nto refuse allegiance to the new Pharaoh who had just been recognized in\r\nEgypt; for every Pharaoh from time immemorial was officially a son of\r\nAmmon. It was the peculiarity of Siwah that the ruler greeted there as\r\nthe son of Ammon was presented authoritatively to the Greek world as\r\nthe son of Zeus.\r\n\r\nThe march across the desert to Ammonium was accomplished only with\r\nsupernatural assistance, according to the official report; and\r\ndeliberate mystery shrouded the interview of Alexander with the god. It\r\nis with no impropriety, as we shall see presently, that Tennyson brings\r\nhis fine poem on the great king to a climactic close with an allusion\r\nto the occurrence:--\r\n\r\n  \"High things were spoken there, unhanded down;\r\n  Only they saw thee from the secret shrine\r\n  Returning with hot cheek and kindled eyes.\"\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, was stressed in the official version of what\r\nhappened: the desired greeting was given publicly to Alexander by the\r\neldest of the priests. And its import was enhanced by the arrival\r\nof messengers to say that oracles to the same effect had been given\r\nsimultaneously by the Sibyl of Erythræ and Apollo at Branchidæ, where\r\na long silence of over one hundred and fifty years was interrupted\r\nthereby. As to the private interview Alexander wrote to his mother that\r\n\"secret things were divulged to him which he could communicate only to\r\nher personally.\"\r\n\r\nI shall revert to the significance of the visit to Siwah presently.\r\nMeanwhile, it will suffice to note that it was quite in character with\r\nthe methods already adopted by Alexander that he should seek in this\r\nbizarre way to impress upon the imagination of men a new idea; to\r\ndisclose by a sensational action of this kind an important change of\r\npolicy. And it is paralleled by several incidents in his later career.\r\n\r\nTwelve months after leaving Siwah, Alexander was master of Persepolis.\r\nThis was the capital of Persis, a land of some half a million\r\ninhabitants whom Cyrus and Darius had made lords of a subject\r\npopulation not much below that of the Roman empire. For over two\r\nhundred years forty millions of people had looked to Persis and\r\nPersepolis as the seats of the mighty. The \"city of the Persians\" and\r\nthe palace of their kings which it contained were the manifest symbols\r\nof empire: the one Alexander gave over to his soldiers to pillage, the\r\nother he fired with his own hand, thus proclaiming to the world that\r\nthe end of a dynasty had come. His own part in this catastrophe--which\r\naffected the imaginations of men in some such way as did the capture of\r\nRome by Alaric in 410 A.D.--was taken conspicuously. Starting up from a\r\nbanquet, he and his companions, among whom was the beautiful Athenian\r\ncourtesan Thais, went in Dionysiac revel to the sound of flutes through\r\nthe streets to the palace, and threw the torches which they had taken\r\nwith them from the feast upon the cedar beams of the roof. Once the\r\nflames had shot up and the desired effect had been produced, Alexander\r\nordered the fire to be extinguished.\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year Alexander entered Ecbatana, the summer\r\ncapital of the Persian empire, and Darius became a fugitive. Up to\r\nthis point Alexander had been hegemon of the Hellenic league as well\r\nas king of Macedon, and, on liberating the Greek cities in Asia from\r\nPersian control, he had added them to the league. Now that the war\r\nagainst Persia, for which the league had been ostensibly formed, had\r\nended, Alexander thought the time had come to relieve himself of the\r\npartnership into which, following the policy of Philip, he had entered\r\nat the opening of his reign. This he did in his usual dramatic way. He\r\ndischarged all the Greek troops put under his command by the league,\r\nand made elaborate provision for their transport back to the coast\r\nand across the Mediterranean to Greece. To every Greek city which had\r\nsent him a contingent, its return was a message that Alexander was no\r\nlonger bound by the treaties made when the league was formed. This did\r\nnot mean, as he took pains to show, that it was freed thereby from all\r\nobligations toward him. Over the Macedonians he ceased at this point to\r\nbe hegemon, but he still remained their king.[66]\r\n\r\nA little later he appeared before his astonished Macedonian officers\r\nclad in what pleased him of the costume of the Persians. The tiara and\r\nthe sleeved jacket and the baggy trousers he did not adopt, but he\r\ntook their soft undergarments, and, as the symbol of authority, the\r\ndiadem. He also remodeled his court in the Oriental fashion, adding\r\npurple to the uniform of the guards, chamberlains, and, if a dubious\r\nreport is to be trusted, a harem. Finally in 327 B.C., shortly after\r\nhis romantic marriage with Roxane, a Persian princess of the Sogdian\r\nnobility, he added the requirement that all who were admitted to his\r\npresence should kneel at his feet and kiss the dust before him. \"Chares\r\nof Mytilene,\"[67] who was master of ceremonies when this custom was\r\ninaugurated, \"says that Alexander, while drinking at a symposium,\r\noffered his goblet to one of his comrades, who, taking it, rose and\r\nwent to the hearth, where, quaffing it off, he first knelt and kissed\r\nAlexander's feet, then kissed his cheek and returned to his couch. All\r\npresent did the same except Callisthenes,\" who proffered the kiss on\r\nthe cheek without first kneeling and thus earned the disfavor of the\r\nking. With this rather lame conclusion was enacted the prologue of what\r\nhis old Macedonian nobles regarded as a great tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"It has been thought,\" says Eduard Meyer,[68] \"that _proskynesis_\"--to\r\nuse the technical term for this ceremony--\"was only the natural\r\nexpression of the fact that by the arbitrament of battle Alexander\r\nhad become lord of the Persian empire and legitimate successor of\r\nDarius. And, indeed, there is truth in this idea. But the meaning of\r\nthe requirement, and the historical significance of the occurrence\r\nand of the conflict which it occasioned, are by no means exhausted\r\nwhen proskynesis is regarded as a harmless concession to the views of\r\nhis Oriental subjects. The essential point is that Alexander demanded\r\nit of the Macedonians and Greeks also. It is precisely in this\r\nmatter, however, that the views of Orientals and Europeans collide\r\nmost squarely and typically. Herein exists an antagonism which is\r\nindependent altogether of race and nationality. We cannot say how it\r\narose, but it dominates the whole course of the cultural and political\r\ndevelopment of the regions in question. The Oriental, be he a Semite,\r\nan Egyptian, an Indo-European, a Chinaman, or of any other stock, finds\r\nit natural that in intercourse with others he has to humble himself;\r\nthat he call himself their servant, them his masters; that he kneel in\r\nthe dust, not only before the king, but before all superiors, without\r\nlessening thereby the sense of personal pride with which he, too, may\r\nbe animated.\r\n\r\n\"To the European, on the other hand, such demeanor involves the\r\ndestruction of his own personality. Never will a free man call\r\nhimself the slave of another. Rather, he will always speak of himself\r\nin confident tones, with a strong feeling of; his own worth....\r\nProstration and kissing the dust are due, in European thinking, only to\r\na god who is thereby acknowledged to be the lord of the worshiper, in\r\nwhose presence the worshiper can have no will of his own.\r\n\r\n\"It was among the Greeks, in their free republics, that this feeling\r\ndeveloped to its full strength. It finds typical expression in the\r\nstory of the Spartan heralds, Sperthies and Bulis, who, although they\r\nhad surrendered themselves to the Persian king to be executed, refused\r\nto prostrate themselves before him; 'for in their country,' Herodotus\r\nmakes them say, 'it was not customary to kiss the dust before a man,\r\nnor had they come for that purpose.' The stories of Themistocles who\r\nrendered the required homage, and of Conon who on its account avoided\r\nan audience with the King altogether, despite the high value it would\r\nhave had for him, are similarly significant. In demanding proskynesis,\r\naccordingly, Alexander offended Greek sentiment violently. Rather,\r\nwhat he thereby demanded was the acknowledgment that officially, in\r\nhis capacity of king,--his private position is a different matter\r\naltogether,--he was no longer a man, but a god.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, when Alexander demanded that Greeks and Macedonians\r\nfall at his feet and kiss the dust before him, he demanded that they\r\nrecognize him as a god, as in fact the son of Zeus. This ceremony\r\nhad no such implications for the Persians; but, as we shall see in a\r\nmoment, in Alexander's thinking, the Persians were to cease to exist;\r\nthey were to be made Hellenes by education.\r\n\r\nAlexander set out for Asia with a firm belief in the absolute\r\nsuperiority of Hellenic culture; and in this belief he remained fixed\r\nto the end. To establish Hellenic life throughout Asia, he regarded\r\nas the main object of his conquests. His Hellenic ideals he revealed\r\nto the astonished natives at almost every halting-place on his march;\r\nfor on such occasions he again and again held gymnastic and musical\r\ncontests after the Greek pattern. As we have seen, he had learned\r\nfrom Aristotle that city-life and Hellenic life were synonymous,\r\nand that without political activity city-life was animal rather than\r\nhuman in character. Accordingly, he displayed a feverish energy in\r\nfounding Greek city-states everywhere in the conquered territory, but\r\nparticularly in the regions of the Far East where urban life had been\r\nhitherto lacking. Like mushrooms overnight, towns by the scores sprang\r\nup behind him on his line of march; so vast was the immigration into\r\nAsia from Greece and Macedon even during the thirteen brief years of\r\nhis reign.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that by founding cities Alexander lessened enormously his\r\nmilitary and administrative difficulties. For every city took from his\r\nshoulders responsibility for maintaining order, collecting taxes, and\r\ndispensing justice in the territory assigned to it--necessary tasks,\r\nnow that a European state was arising in Asia, which could be performed\r\notherwise only by the creation of a bureaucratic system of officials.\r\nThis, however, was a non-Hellenic institution for which Alexander had\r\nnaturally no liking. In the future he saw the whole world--that of\r\nAsia which he had already conquered and that of the Far West which he\r\nmeant to conquer--honeycombed, like Greece itself, with a multitude\r\nof city-states, each a separate cell with a town in its centre, each\r\npossessed of a general assembly and a council, magistrates of its own\r\nchoosing and laws of its own making or adoption, each the home of free\r\nmen speaking the Greek language, fostering Greek art and letters, and\r\nfighting with Greek arms and tactics. It was a grand vision, which\r\nfailed of realization in Alexander's time and thereafter; but it set\r\nforth an ideal toward which future generations moved for over five\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Alexander never lost faith in the absolute supremacy\r\nof Hellenic culture. Certainly the place of unlimited authority which\r\nhe reserved for himself above the world of city-states and their\r\nlaw-bound citizens, was the one prescribed for the ideal wise man,\r\nthe man of supreme political ability, by Aristotle his tutor. That\r\nAristotle thought of a different _pambasileus_ for each city-state and\r\nAlexander of a single \"absolute monarch\" for all, is a non-essential\r\ndifference, and it is simply in the institutions which Alexander found\r\nnecessary to translate the idea of the philosopher into the world of\r\nreality that Hellenic practice and custom were violated.\r\n\r\nThese outlandish institutions, however, Alexander employed as means\r\nfor the better dissemination of Greek life and thought, without being\r\nconscious, perhaps, that they were destructive of the spirit which they\r\nwere intended to preserve.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is indisputable that Alexander revised his\r\ntutor's, and his own youthful, opinion as to the worth of the Asiatics.\r\nWhat he came to think of Semites and Egyptians we do not know; and it\r\nmay be that he continued to regard them as naturally servile and,\r\nhence, condemned them to remain forever hewers of wood and drawers of\r\nwater for the Hellenic or Hellenized citizens in whose cities they\r\nwere to live. But as to the Medes and Persians and the kindred Iranian\r\nstocks of the Far East, the views of their conqueror changed radically\r\nwhen he came really to know them, and to appreciate fully the magnitude\r\nof the task which he had undertaken.\r\n\r\nHe found that they had spirit and capacity comparable to those of\r\nthe Greeks and Macedonians themselves. That they caused him no\r\nphysical repulsion is shown by his falling in love with and marrying\r\nRoxane. Teach them the Greek language, draw them along with the\r\nimmigrant Greeks into the body politic of the new cities, equip them\r\nwith Macedonian weapons, drill them in the Macedonian fashion, and\r\ndistribute them in the Macedonian regiments; above all, use the nobles\r\nin the high administrative posts, and it seemed to Alexander possible,\r\nwithin a short time, to fuse the new masters of Asia with the old into\r\na new cosmopolitan race.\r\n\r\nWith iron resolution he carried this policy forward despite all\r\nopposition. Then, choosing the dramatic moment of his return to Susa\r\nafter his Indian campaign, he arranged an extraordinary marriage as a\r\nsymbol of the contemplated fusion of the dominant peoples of Europe\r\nand Asia. \"He himself,\" says Arrian in his _Anabasis_,[69] quoting\r\nAristobulus, an eye-witness, \"married Barsine (rather Stateira), the\r\neldest of the daughters of Darius, and, in addition to her, another,\r\nthe youngest of the daughters of Ochus (the able predecessor of\r\nDarius), Parysatis. Earlier, too, he had wedded Roxane, the daughter\r\nof Oxyartes of Bactria. To Hephæstion he gave Drypetis, who, too, was\r\na daughter of Darius and sister of the wife he took himself; for he\r\nwished the children of Hephæstion to be cousins of his own children. To\r\nCraterus he gave Amastrine, the daughter of Oxyartes, Darius's brother;\r\nto Perdiccas, the daughter of Atropates, satrap of Media; to Ptolemy,\r\nhis aide, and to Eumenes, his private secretary, children of Artabazus,\r\nto the one Artacama, to the other, Artonis. To Nearchus he gave the\r\ndaughter of Barsine and Mentor, to Seleucus the daughter of Spitamenes\r\nof Bactria; and in like manner to his other companions he gave the most\r\nfamous of the daughters of the Medes and Persians, to the number of\r\neighty. The marriages were celebrated in the Persian manner. Seats were\r\nplaced in order, and on them the bridegrooms reclined\"; and at this\r\npoint we may let Chares, master of ceremonies, interrupt Arrian and\r\ndescribe the setting which he had arranged for the service.\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" he says,[70] \"a hall of a hundred couches, each large enough\r\nfor two to recline at table, and in it each couch, made of twenty\r\nminas' worth of silver, was decked as for a wedding. Alexander's had\r\nfeet of gold. And to the feast were bidden all his Persian friends,\r\nand given places on the opposite side of the hall from himself and the\r\nother bridegrooms. And all the army and the sailors and the embassies\r\nand the visitors were assembled in the outer court. The hall was\r\ndecorated in most sumptuous style, with expensive rugs, and hangings\r\nof fine linen, and tapestries of many colors wrought with threads of\r\ngold. And for the support of the vast tent which formed the hall there\r\nwere pillars thirty feet high, plated with silver and gold, and set\r\nwith precious stones. And around about the sides were costly portières,\r\nembroidered with figures and shot through with gold threads, hung on\r\ngilded and silvered rods.\r\n\r\n\"The circuit of the court was half a mile. Everything was started at\r\nthe signal of a trumpet-blast, whether it was the beginning of the\r\nfeast, the celebration of the marriages, or the pouring of one of\r\nthe various libations, so that all the army might know.\" \"After the\r\nbanquet,\" resumes Arrian,[71] \"the brides entered and seated themselves\r\neach beside her fiancé, who thereupon took her by the hand and kissed\r\nher; and the first to do this was the king.... Then each man, taking\r\nhis wife, led her away. Their dowries Alexander gave to every one of\r\nthem. And he caused the names to be written down of all the other\r\nMacedonians who had married Asiatic women, and there were said to\r\nbe over ten thousand of them. To these, too, gifts were given by\r\nAlexander at the marriage feast.\"\r\n\r\nFor five consecutive days artists from every land and people\r\nentertained the cosmopolitan assembly with displays of skill as various\r\nas were the ideas and interests to which they catered. But the discord\r\nwas lessened and the dominant _motiv_ repeated again and again by\r\nthe appearance and reappearance of the greatest Greek masters of the\r\ndramatic and musical arts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt being established by these many incidents that it was a salient\r\ntrait of Alexander's character to disclose his fundamental policies\r\nby acts elaborately staged and performed before the largest possible\r\naudiences, we may return to his extraordinary visit to the temple of\r\nAmmon of Cyrene. He had first to proceed one hundred and seventy-five\r\nmiles along the Libyan coast and then southwest for about seven days\r\nbefore reaching his goal. A month of the most difficult marching,\r\nat a time when every day was precious, was the high price which\r\nAlexander thought it economical to pay for the recognition which he\r\nthere received as the son of Zeus. What was, then, the value of this\r\nwell-advertised recognition?\r\n\r\nThat it had none for Egypt and the nations of Asia, to whom the god of\r\nSiwah, like the prophet in his own country, was without honor, implies\r\nthat Alexander esteemed highly its value in the Greek world, where the\r\nvoice heard at Siwah was in fact an admonition to the pious and might\r\nbe an embarrassment to all in official positions. An oracle, however,\r\nwas always addressed primarily to him who received it. Other persons\r\ncould neglect it with impunity. Nevertheless, Alexander had made it\r\nimprobable that anybody should be unaware that Zeus had acknowledged\r\nhim as his son. Doubtless, much discussion was provoked; but there the\r\nmatter seems to have ended so far as Hellas was concerned till seven\r\nyears later, at the time of the feast at Susa, when Alexander issued\r\na mandate to all the Greek city-states, new and old, that they should\r\nrecognize him as a god.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem to us, among whom church and state are\r\nseparated sharply, and religion depends upon a revelation which can\r\nbe interpreted but not supplemented, the question was one which came\r\nproperly within the province of the general assembly of the citizens of\r\neach city. At this very time the Athenians, for example, had waiting\r\nwithin their gates many foreign deities whose claims to official\r\nrecognition were being pressed upon the ecclesia by votaries among both\r\nthe alien and the native population. Such were Isis the Egyptian, and\r\nthe Cypriote Aphrodite. In comparatively recent times, moreover, the\r\necclesia had yielded to similar solicitations, and had enrolled among\r\nthe deities of the Athenian people Asclepius and the Thracian Bendis.\r\n\r\nIn a polytheistic world there is no logical limit to the possible\r\nnumber of gods; so that the chance always existed that there were\r\ndeities whom a given community had not yet discovered at any given\r\nmoment. There is, in such a world, a logical necessity that anarchy\r\nshould be absent from heaven. Hence each community had to rank its gods\r\nand goddesses according to their power and spheres of activity. The\r\nlowest god, demigod or hero was, accordingly, separated from mankind by\r\nno deep or broad chasm. With most of their deities, in fact, the Greeks\r\nwere on terms of familiar intimacy, as were mediæval Christians with\r\ntheir saints. Various of the lesser gods, Theseus and Heracles among\r\nthe ancestors of Alexander for example, had once been men who had been\r\nelevated to Olympus by the grace of Zeus because of the many services\r\nwhich they had rendered to men. It is true that they were the children\r\nof Zeus; but had not Zeus also claimed Alexander as his own son? Why,\r\nthen, should not he too be deified?\r\n\r\nThe difficulty from the standpoint of religion--of the sentiment which\r\nhad led in the past to the heroizing of men--was that he was still\r\nliving. And this was an insurmountable difficulty. From the religious\r\nconceptions of the Greeks the worship of the living ruler could never\r\nbe derived; and, in fact, it was by pious people and for theological\r\nreasons that the rendering of divine honors to Alexander was opposed in\r\nAthens and elsewhere.[72] The most that could be expected from men of\r\nreligious convictions was a sullen acquiescence in something which they\r\ncould not prevent.\r\n\r\nThe apotheosis of Alexander was grounded in impiety, in disbelief in\r\nthe supernatural altogether. For the age in which he lived was marked\r\nby this very thing. In that time of storm and stress the ancient Greek\r\nreligion became bankrupt. For enlightened people--and their name was\r\nthen legion--the gods had ceased to have objective reality. Like the\r\nspirits of the departed whom Ulysses had recalled to consciousness by\r\ngiving them blood to drink, they were dependent for their existence\r\nupon the kindliness of men. Without the ministrations of the living\r\nthey would not merely be forgotten; they would be annihilated. It was\r\nthe gratitude of mankind which had kept the memory of benefactors\r\ngreen by rites deemed and called religious. Once, to be sure, the\r\ndeities had been real beings, but that was before they had died, while\r\nthey were living upon the earth as men. Then they had performed great\r\nservices--had founded cities, conquered worlds, established laws,\r\ninvented arts, developed grains and fruits, and trained animals.\r\nSo at least many men of talent and learning already taught. But it\r\nremained for Euhemerus of Messene, about fifty years later (_ca._ 280\r\nB.C.), to give the idea classic expression in an entertaining work\r\nof popularization.[73] With all the circumstantiality of Defoe, he\r\ntells how, in the course of his voyaging, he was driven southward into\r\nthe Indian Ocean from Araby the Blest, till he came to the island of\r\nPanchæa. There he found a model community whose social and political\r\norganization he described in the manner familiar to us from Plato's\r\n_Republic_. There, too, he made a remarkable discovery--an account\r\nwritten on golden tablets in \"reformed Egyptian\" by Hermes of the lives\r\nand achievements of Chronus, Zeus, and all the other gods and goddesses\r\nof the Greek hierarchy. They had been kings and notables of Panchæa,\r\nand some of them, like Zeus and Dionysus, had been world conquerors.\r\nOthers, indeed, had earned the favorable verdict of posterity by very\r\nquestionable acts. Aphrodite was the first prostitute, and Cadmus, the\r\ngrandfather of Dionysus, was the cook of a king in Sidon and had run\r\naway with a flute girl named Harmonia.\r\n\r\nThis \"sacred writ\" was naturally the latest and most authoritative\r\nrevelation. It was saved, moreover, from being a gospel of atheism\r\nbecause, as Cumont[74] says, \"It left to the eternal and incorruptible\r\nstars ... the dignity of original gods and exalted them in proportion\r\nas it lowered their rivals of bygone days.\" The signal merit of Chronus\r\nhad been to introduce the worship of the heavenly bodies in Panchæa.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the _Scriptures_ of Euhemerus accorded with a strong\r\ncurrent of both earlier and contemporary religious thought. Most men\r\nat that time recognized supernatural powers of a certain sort, like\r\nTyche, \"Chance,\"--the favorite deity of the Hellenistic world,--whose\r\nplay in human affairs modern disbelievers in religion also would be the\r\nlast to deny. But they declined to recognize as efficacious the gods\r\nand goddesses in whose honor the cities maintained temples, priests,\r\nsacrifices, and games, except when they had lived on the earth as men\r\nand women.\r\n\r\nAt the best, therefore, these deities were simply prototypes of\r\nAlexander, who had founded seventy cities and given them their\r\nconstitutions and laws, who had conquered all the territory which\r\nDionysus had once overrun, and who was planning to build a highway\r\nalong the coast of North Africa to the pillars set by Heracles at the\r\nlimits of the world; who, moreover, was moulding the masses of Europe\r\nand Asia into a new race, and upheld, as no god had ever done, the\r\nsocial and political framework of the world.\r\n\r\nReligion was unable to elevate a living man to godhood. Even in Egypt\r\nthe sacred animals were but sacred animals till seventy days after\r\ntheir death, when they became deities. But irreligion, having degraded\r\nall gods to the level of human beings, had no reason to withhold from\r\ngreat men the homage which it accorded to the great dead.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental document on the deification of Greek kings comes\r\nto us stamped with the seal of the Athenian state. It was sung by\r\nthe multitude at the official reception of its sovereign, the young\r\nMacedonian king, Demetrius Poliorcetes, on his return to Athens in\r\n290 B.C.[75] \"The king comes, light-hearted as befits a god, fair and\r\nlaughing, yet majestic withal in his circle of courtiers, he the sun,\r\nthey the stars: hail! child of mighty Poseidon and of Aphrodite. The\r\nother gods are a long way off, or have no ears, or no existence, or\r\ntake no care of us, but thee we see face to face--a true god, not one\r\nof wood and stone.\" This catchy bit of blasphemy makes it impossible\r\nfor any reasonable doubt to linger as to the regions of thought from\r\nwhich the worship of Greek rulers sprang.\r\n\r\nBut why should men who regarded the gods they already had as useless\r\nburden the state with the cult of another whose power was only too\r\nreal? Why abandon King Log for a possible King Stork? It is on this\r\npoint chiefly that scholars disagree to-day. There are those who\r\nmake the apotheosis of Alexander a tribute paid by the Greeks to\r\ntranscendant genius, a result of the reverence-compelling personality\r\nof the man. I confess, however, that enthusiastic admiration such as\r\nthis presupposes does not seem to me to harmonize with the contemptuous\r\nexpressions which marked the establishment of his cult in certain\r\nplaces in Greece.[76] In Sparta, Damis moved, in regard to Alexander's\r\nmessage that he be decreed a god, that the Spartans \"let him be\r\ncalled a god if he wishes it\"; while in Athens Demosthenes advised his\r\nfellow-citizens \"to acknowledge the king as the son of Zeus, or, for\r\nall he cared, as the son of Poseidon, if such was his pleasure.\" In\r\nother places, however, the recognition seems to have been spontaneous\r\nenough, and to have been an expression of real gratitude for services\r\nrendered or expected. But Greeks on earlier occasions, and other\r\npeoples as well, were equally grateful and no less servile without\r\ndeifying the object of those sentiments. Why then did admiration,\r\ngratitude, or servility take this form in this particular instance?\r\n\r\nIt is true that deification was _demanded_ of the Greek cities by\r\nAlexander, and that it was in response to a mandate sent out by him\r\nfrom Susa in 324 B.C. that \"sacred ambassadors,\" such as were sent to\r\ngods and not to kings or states, arrived at Babylon in the spring of\r\n323 B.C. a few weeks before Alexander's death, bearing the decrees in\r\nwhich his request was granted. But for the following fifty years it\r\nwas at the initiative of the Greek cities, and, at times, against the\r\nwill and interest of the recipient, that such honors were conferred\r\nupon later rulers. Hence we may be certain that in the first instance\r\ndeification was an accommodation both to Alexander and to the cities in\r\nhis realm. Nor can we, I think, be in serious doubt as to the character\r\nof the service it rendered.\r\n\r\nIt gave a legal position to Alexander in the world of city-states which\r\nhe was organizing. It was unjust, Aristotle had taught him, that a\r\nman of supreme political capacity--such as he had displayed--should\r\nbe treated as worthy of mere equality in the cities of his realm. Yet\r\nhe could be treated in no other fashion if he were to be a citizen\r\nof them. On the other hand, now that he had freed himself from the\r\nconstitutional limitations placed upon the earlier kings of Macedon and\r\nfrom the treaties which he had formed with the Hellenic cities at the\r\nopening of his reign, he ran the risk of being put to death or outlawed\r\nor ostracized, if he were not, as Aristotle suggested, rated as a deity\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom his point of view, his rule was legitimatized when he was enrolled\r\namong the deities recognized by each city; for thereafter he had a\r\nclear right to issue orders to all the citizens of his world. From\r\ntheir point of view, on the other hand, by deifying Alexander they\r\nescaped from the intolerable necessity of obeying the commands of a\r\nforeigner. They thereby gave their consent to be ruled by him. They\r\nsubordinated their will to his.\r\n\r\nThe deification of rulers was, accordingly, simply the proskynesis of\r\ncities. Its consequences were an absolutism such as Europe--and for\r\nthat matter Asia--had never known before and has never ceased to know\r\nsince. And it is this melancholy consequence of apotheosis which has\r\nonly too frequently obscured its signal service: that it made possible\r\nthe lasting union of all the city-states of the world in a single great\r\nterritorial state.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n 1.

When a certain semblance of order was restored\r\nthe view was officially promulgated that he had not died at all,\r\nbut had simply \"departed from the life among men.\" His memory was,\r\naccordingly, not damned; and, in a sense, his presence in the world\r\nwhich he had transformed continued to be recognized. But not in any\r\nreal sense. The imperial coins, wherever issued, bore for some time the\r\ngreat king's face as Zeus Ammon; but no imperial cult existed to bring\r\nsteadily to men's consciousness the idea that their dead lord had an\r\nhonored place among the Olympians. It was not by the will of those who\r\nsucceeded to his power, but by the force of historic developments, that\r\nhis _acta_ were validated.\r\n\r\nHis heirs were the Macedonians whom he had recently tried to oust\r\nfrom their ancestral partnership with him. They were now to be found,\r\npartly in Macedon, partly in detachments throughout the empire, and\r\npartly in Babylon where Alexander had died. Those in Babylon took it\r\nupon themselves to act for the whole people; and what they did was\r\nto establish a regency in the interest of Philip Arrhidæus and the\r\nson whom Roxane was expected to bear, and to concur in the \"grab\" of\r\nthe important western satrapies which was at once made by their chief\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nIt was they, too, who decided not to proceed with Alexander's ambitious\r\nprojects. These, as read to them from his papers,[77] were \"to build\r\nin Phoenicia, Syria, Cilicia, and Cyprus one thousand battleships of\r\nthe super-trireme pattern for the campaign against the Carthaginians\r\nand the other peoples dwelling on the shores of the Mediterranean from\r\nLibya and Iberia clear round to Sicily; to construct a road along the\r\ncoast from Cyrene to the Pillars of Hercules, and prepare harbors and\r\nnaval stations at suitable places; to erect six temples at the enormous\r\ncost of $1,890,000 each (fifteen hundred talents); to found cities and\r\ntransplant men and women both from Asia into Europe and from Europe\r\ninto Asia, thus linking the two greatest continents by understandings\r\nbased upon friendly intercourse and by brotherly feeling due to\r\nintermarriages.\" Alexander, it appeared, had looked upon his work as\r\nonly half done: the Macedonians were eager to enjoy the fruits of an\r\nenterprise which they regarded as already finished.\r\n\r\nTheir sentiment was shared by Ptolemy, son of Lagos, formerly one of\r\nAlexander's aides. He had married a Persian princess at Alexander's\r\norder, but now he deserted her, and, taking his Athenian mistress,\r\nThais, with him, he went off to Egypt, which had been given to him\r\nas his province. There he established himself securely, governed\r\nwith power and sagacity for forty years, and, marrying in succession\r\ntwo Macedonian princesses, founded a dynasty which gave to Egypt\r\nits last great queen, Cleopatra VI, and prior to her accession, ten\r\nkings,[78] all of whom were named Ptolemy. Between them they reigned\r\ntwo hundred and seventy-one years; the average length of the reign was\r\nover thirty-two years; several of them were expelled temporarily and\r\nseveral of them had colleagues, but nine of them died in possession of\r\nthe throne. That constitutes a statistical record which it is hard to\r\nparallel in all history.\r\n\r\nIt would be a fascinating study of human enterprise and human depravity\r\nto trace the careers of these eleven monarchs. But to do so would be to\r\nexhaust the space at my disposal without reaching the special subject\r\nof my essay. It must suffice, therefore, to observe that the history\r\nof the Ptolemies falls into an imperial period of four reigns and\r\none hundred and twenty years (323-203 B.C.); and a domestic period,\r\nlikewise of one hundred and twenty years (200-80 B.C.), in which the\r\nnative peoples, encouraged by the weakness of the Ptolemies abroad, and\r\nby a ruinous schism between the military and the civil elements of the\r\nforeign-resident population, gained point after point at the expense\r\nof the dynasty. A third period follows of fifty years' duration, in\r\nwhich Egypt was at the mercy, not now of the Roman Senate, but of the\r\nall-powerful generals who had dethroned it.\r\n\r\nThe last king of Egypt, Ptolemy the Piper, a bastard by birth and\r\ninstinct, demeaned himself for twenty-eight years (80-52 B.C.); but\r\nby bankrupting his treasury and sacrificing the good opinion of his\r\ncountrymen, he managed to transmit a badly tarnished crown to his\r\nfamous daughter, then a girl of seventeen years.\r\n\r\nCleopatra VI had an asset of much greater value than the servility and\r\nbuffoonery of her father, namely, her personal attractiveness. She\r\nearly lost all repugnance against using her physical charms, as well\r\nas her even more notable mental graces, in what, with all our dislike\r\nfor the imperial courtesan, we must characterize as her gallant and\r\npatriotic effort to rescue her country from the spoiler, to make the\r\nqueen of Egypt the consort instead of the slave of the coming Roman\r\nmonarch, to set proud Alexandria beside imperious Rome at the head of\r\nthe Mediterranean peoples.\r\n\r\nShe gave herself to Julius Cæsar; bore him a son; left her kingdom and\r\njoined him in Rome, where Cicero and others paid her court in Cæsar's\r\ngardens, wondering, perhaps, if she was to become their titular queen.\r\nIn contemporary documents Cæsar is called \"the savior and benefactor\r\nof the inhabitable world\"; and during the last year of his life he was\r\nbusied with projects of universal empire. He meant to add the districts\r\nnot yet Roman to his realm, to subdue the Getæ, the Scythians, and\r\nthe Parthians. Why was not Egypt, the richest prize of all, included\r\nin the list of his intended conquests? It was the country which he had\r\ntried over twenty years earlier to secure as his own province. But that\r\nwas before he had met Cleopatra. That he left it out of the military\r\nprogramme on which he was engaged at the time of his murder shows, I\r\nthink, that Cleopatra's solution of the Egyptian question was likely to\r\nbe his also.\r\n\r\nTen years later Alexandria witnessed an extraordinary spectacle.[79]\r\nOn a stage plated with silver two thrones of gold stood, and on them\r\nsat side by side Antony as Dionysus and Cleopatra as Isis. At their\r\nfeet sat Cæsarion, Cleopatra's son by Cæsar, and on a level with him\r\nAlexander, her oldest son by Antony, in Persian costume and with the\r\ntiara of the Persian kings. Lower down sat Alexander's twin sister,\r\nCleopatra Selene, and at her side her younger brother, Philadelphus, in\r\nMacedonian costume and with the headgear of the kings of Macedon. The\r\nsignificance of the tableau Antony himself explained: Cleopatra, queen\r\nof Egypt, Cyprus, and Coele-Syria, was henceforth 'queen of queens';\r\nher son, Cæsarion, 'king of kings.' Alexander was declared king of\r\nArmenia and of the states lying between the Euphrates and India,\r\nPhiladelphus, of Syria and all the lands between the Euphrates and the\r\nHellespont, Cleopatra Selene, queen of Libya including Cyrene. It was\r\nthe restoration of the ancient empire of the Ptolemies, and in Antony\r\n\"captured Italy\" was symbolized. The Alexandrian siren had regained\r\nwhat her ancestors had lost; and, had the Roman whom she had enthralled\r\nonly proved equal to the task of maintaining his initial ascendency in\r\nItaly, she might, indeed, have fulfilled her boast and administered\r\njustice on the Capitol. But Antony went down to defeat at Actium and\r\nthe young Augustus came to Egypt, like the comrades of Ulysses to the\r\nshore of the tempters, with his ears stuffed with wax.\r\n\r\nPascal[80] says: _Le nez de Cléopâtre: s'il eût été plus court, toute\r\nla face de la terre aurait changé._ But Pascal speaks as a philosopher.\r\nHe probably did not know that Cleopatra had a prominent nose. He was\r\ncertainly ignorant that her death made little or no difference in the\r\nconstitutional position of Egypt. In a sense Augustus was simply the\r\nexecutor of the great queen's policy; for, after his reorganization of\r\nthe Roman empire was completed, \"it is,\" as Mommsen[81] says, \"quite as\r\ncorrect to say that the kings of Egypt ruled in Rome as that the prince\r\nof the Roman people reigned in the valley of the Nile.\" Be that as it\r\nmay, the empire of the Ptolemies could not have been recalled from the\r\npast even by the magic of a woman's beauty; for, as we shall see when\r\nwe come to look at the second period of its history, the death it had\r\ndied was a natural one. It had but experienced the fate to which its\r\nconstitution made it prone. It was beset from its birth with incurable\r\nweaknesses.\r\n\r\nNone the less it made a brave show during the first century of its\r\nexistence; and during the reign of its second monarch, Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus (285-246 B.C.), its capital, Alexandria, was the London\r\nof the ancient world. Its only rival in trade and commerce was its\r\nneighbor to the west, Carthage. The golden age of the Ptolemies\r\ncoincides with the one epoch in the history of the world in which\r\nAfrica was the leader in business enterprise, in money power, in\r\nnaval strength, in luxury, in science, and, till the real test came,\r\nin political prestige and influence. The commercial aristocracy\r\nof Carthage and the enlightened despots of Alexandria had the\r\nMediterranean divided between them. West of Sicily lay a Carthaginian\r\nlake, into which foreign ships entered at their own peril; east of it,\r\nthe chief harbors in the whole circuit from Cyrene to Corcyra, as well\r\nas the islands which lay in the area thus inclosed, the Ptolemies aimed\r\nto secure. Possession of the sea between Egypt and the Græco-Macedonian\r\nworld and of the coasts which it washed and the islands which it\r\nsurrounded, was the main object of the foreign policy of the early\r\nPtolemies.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the dynasty was a brave soldier, but a cautious\r\ngeneral. Again and again he withdrew from Asia before a land attack\r\nand put his main reliance upon the natural defenses of Egypt. He was\r\nno sailor at all; yet he became an admiral, and as the result of three\r\ngreat maritime expeditions (308-306, 295-294, 288-287 B.C.), he handed\r\nover to his unwarlike son the essential body of the possessions of the\r\nfamily outside of Egypt. The founder of the dynasty was at the same\r\ntime the founder of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe Solomon of the Ptolemies, Philadelphus, is addressed by\r\nTheocritus,[82] a Sicilian poet who had recently come to Alexandria\r\nlooking for a patron, in the following adulatory strains:--\r\n\r\n  \"Lo he hath seen three hundred towns arise,\r\n  Three thousand, yea three myriad; and o'er all\r\n  He rules, the prince of heroes, Ptolemy.\r\n  Claims half Phoenicia, and half Araby,\r\n  Syria and Libya, and the Æthiops murk;\r\n  Sways the Pamphylian and Cilician braves,\r\n  The Lycian and the Carian trained to war,\r\n  And all the isles; for never fleet like his\r\n  Rode upon ocean: land and sea alike\r\n  And sounding rivers hail King Ptolemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe hero of these lines had just brought a war against his brother in\r\nCyrene and his rival in Asia to a successful termination (273 B.C.);\r\nand, except for a probable interval of four years (253-249 B.C.), the\r\ninvincible fleet which he then possessed ruled the sea till his death.\r\nBut he was anything but a warrior king. During his whole life he never\r\ncommanded an army or a fleet in person. Like Augustus Cæsar, with whom\r\nhe has been compared, he had a delicate constitution which unfitted him\r\nfor the rough and tumble of war. He had a lively intelligence, which\r\nwas carefully cultivated, and, like the Emperor Hadrian, an insatiable\r\nthirst for novelties. A new book, an old painting, a strange animal, a\r\nuseful invention, alike aroused his curiosity. One amazing woman--his\r\nown sister--swept him from his self-indulgent moorings. She made\r\nherself his wife--as any Egyptian woman might do with her brother--and,\r\nthough she was his queen for six years at most (275-270 B.C.), when\r\nshe was over forty and he over thirty-two, he followed her policy and\r\ncherished her memory for many long years.\r\n\r\nThat her _acta_ might not be invalid he had her deified after her\r\ndeath, and that he might still be her consort, he had himself elevated\r\nat the same time to her side as the first self-constituted god-king\r\nsince Alexander.\r\n\r\nA sensualist by instinct, he surrounded himself in Alexandria with\r\neverything that appealed to his variegated lusts.[83] The women whom\r\nhe took into his harem after his sister's death were given palaces\r\nand race-horses, public statues,--in costumes which were not always\r\nmodest,--and even divine honors. Splendid new quarters were laid out\r\nin Alexandria, and public works erected there and elsewhere in his\r\nrealm. The capital thronged with scientific, literary, and musical\r\ncelebrities, attracted by the endowments and collections of the Museum,\r\nthe richness of the library, the profusion of festivals, and the\r\nliberality of the king, who wished Alexandria to become to the new\r\nworld what Athens had been to the old.\r\n\r\nYet despite all these manifold gratifications, life palled on the\r\nmuch-experienced monarch. He turned from the doctors to the quacks,\r\nand, shrinking from pain and death, experimented with draughts that\r\nwere alleged to confer immortality: a strange act for one who was\r\nalready a god! While suffering agony from the gout, he envied the lot\r\nof the fellahs, whom he saw from his window stretched out on the sand\r\nin the sun eating their simple meal. \"Ye poor,\" he is said to have once\r\nexclaimed, \"would that I had been one of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"From behind the rich curtains of his palace,\" as his stout adversary,\r\nAntigonus of Macedon,[84] phrased it, Ptolemy Philadelphus played\r\ncautiously and adroitly the great game of international politics. His\r\nemissaries, laden with gifts and money, were to be found at every\r\ncapital from the Ganges to the Tiber. \"Mighty kings\" and \"great\r\ncities,\" Theocritus tells us,[85] were in his pay; and in the harbor\r\nof Alexandria many great battleships lay ready to give emphasis to\r\ndiplomacy, to support the agents whom his gold had brought into action.\r\n\r\nBy these means, too, he kept open the roads which led across the sea\r\nfrom all directions to Alexandria; shut off, by a fringe of Egyptian\r\npossessions, the great continental empire of the Seleucids from access\r\nto the Mediterranean; and kept Greece so persistently in insurrection\r\nagainst its suzerain, Macedon, that he was able to ward off all danger\r\nfrom that quarter.\r\n\r\nHe enlarged his inherited empire by seizing Ionia when Eumenes I of\r\nPergamum threw off the suzerainty of the Seleucids and shattered their\r\nauthority in Asia Minor (263-261 B.C.); but the gains he then made he\r\nhad to abandon during the upheaval which accompanied the revolt of his\r\n\"son\" in Ephesus (259-255 B.C.), and he suffered still further losses\r\nin Asia during the war he waged thereafter (253-249 B.C.), with Macedon\r\nand Syria combined. These, however, his son, Euergetes, at the opening\r\nof his reign (246-242 B.C.), regained, and he acquired districts in\r\nIonia and the Hellespont besides; and the position which he thereby\r\nsecured he held till his death twenty years later. On the sea, however,\r\nhe showed himself less persistent than his father. Philadelphus had\r\nlost control of the Ægean when beaten at Cos in 253 B.C. by Antigonus\r\nof Macedon, but had not rested till he had regained it four years\r\nlater, when the league of the Islanders, which was the immediate\r\nbone of contention, came again under the authority of his admirals.\r\nEuergetes suffered a crushing naval defeat in 242 B.C. off the island\r\nof Andros at the hands of the \"veteran\" Antigonus; whereupon he let\r\nthe Cyclades go altogether. That was not the only sequel, however;\r\nfor in consequence of the large outlay for little gain entailed in\r\nbuilding and keeping in readiness the huge battleships then employed,\r\nand perhaps also in consequence of the failure of the Carthaginians,\r\ndespite great naval expense and preparations, to hold the sea against\r\nthe improvised fleets of Rome in the First Punic War (which had just\r\nended), the third Ptolemy, like the Barcid government in Carthage,\r\nabandoned the policy of maintaining a fleet strong enough to drive all\r\nenemies from their respective parts of the Mediterranean. It was a\r\ngreat mistake in each case. When at the end of the third century B.C.\r\nMacedon and Syria, the traditional and long-suffering enemies of Egypt,\r\nwere in a position to renew their joint struggle with the Ptolemies,\r\nthe far-spread Ptolemaic empire fell together like a house of cards,\r\nand Rome alone saved the dynasty from complete destruction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA variety of motives actuated the early Ptolemies in their struggle\r\nfor foreign dominions. Pride of possession was among them, of course.\r\nThe court poet Callimachus[86] struck a responsive chord when, in his\r\npoem on the death of Arsinoë, the sister-wife of Philadelphus, he has\r\nthe sad news flashed from beacon point to beacon point till it reaches\r\nLemnos at the outer edge of the empire. National honor is a strong\r\nmotive for action, but it is commonly stirred by the fear of losing\r\nsomething possessed rather than by the hope of acquiring something new.\r\nHence we must look deeper for the reasons which led cautious statesmen\r\nlike the first two Ptolemies to place round Egypt its girdle of power.\r\n\r\nThe motive suggested by Polybius[87] is quite different. It was with\r\nregard to possible movements on the part of the monarchs of Syria, Asia\r\nMinor, Thrace, and Macedon that the Ptolemies held, as he says, \"the\r\nmost important towns, places, and harbors along the whole coast\" of the\r\neastern Mediterranean. And there can be no doubt that he is right in\r\nattributing this rather malicious aim to them. They were, doubtless,\r\ngreat intriguers. But to Polybius, looking on from without, from one\r\nof the districts which had been affected by the close proximity of\r\nEgyptian garrisons and naval stations, the connection of these posts\r\nwith the foreign policy of the Ptolemies was apt to obtrude itself to\r\nthe exclusion of everything else. Nowadays historians are prone to\r\na similar onesidedness because of the close attention they give to\r\neconomic factors. They are quite right when they stress the importance\r\nof Ptolemaic naval power and of the vantage-points held in Europe and\r\nAsia for the development of Alexandrian commerce. The lighthouse which\r\nPtolemy erected at the mouth of the Nile at a cost of a million dollars\r\n(eight hundred talents) was not only one of the seven wonders of the\r\nworld: it was a messenger of good will to the trading vessels which\r\ncame from all the dependencies with or without cargoes, to get for\r\nGreek consumption the varied products of the Alexandrian factories, the\r\nEgyptian grain-fields, and the Nile-borne traffic of Arabia, India,\r\nSomaliland, and Ethiopia. What the lighthouse symbolizes, the growth of\r\nAlexandria to half a million in a hundred years proves: the magnitude\r\nof the commerce which the transmarine possessions of Egypt stimulated,\r\nwhen they did not originate it.\r\n\r\nWhere the economic historians are wrong, however, is in doing what\r\nPolybius did. _He_ made the imperial policy of the early Ptolemies\r\nprimarily foreign; _they_ make it primarily commercial. The truth is\r\nthat it was dictated also by the plain necessities of the domestic\r\nsituation. Let us see what that was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first Ptolemy had stepped into the place of the Pharaohs on\r\nAlexander the Great's death. The only right he cared to acknowledge for\r\nthe obedience of the Egyptians was the right of conquest. As for them,\r\nwe may be sure that just as they created the myth that Alexander was\r\nnot really Philip's child, but a son begotten from Olympias by either\r\nNectanebus, the last native Pharaoh, or Ammon, the great god himself\r\nwho had taken the form of Nectanebus for the purpose; and just as they\r\nin later times represented Cæsar and Antony as Ammon reincarnate, that\r\nCleopatra's bastard children might be legitimate Pharaohs: so, too,\r\nthey applied to Ptolemy the fiction by which for thousands of years\r\nthey had been wont to bridge over the gaps in the genealogy of their\r\nkings.[88]\r\n\r\nThe bridge was necessary, however; for, in their thinking, the gods,\r\nwho had once lived among men, on withdrawing to the divine abodes, had\r\nleft one of their number to rule over the world--which, of course,\r\nwas Egypt. From him all their kings were descended. The Pharaoh was,\r\naccordingly, the only god who resided upon the earth, and, as such,\r\nfittingly the mediator between men and the great gods and goddesses of\r\nthe upper and nether world.[89] The Pharaoh was, therefore, both the\r\ngod-king and the chief priest. The whole land and people of Egypt were\r\nhis property. Without his presence and ministrations the earth would\r\nliterally languish and grow barren, and the men, women, and children\r\nwould perish. Egypt was, accordingly, bound to have a legitimate\r\nPharaoh. Ptolemy could be made Ammon's offspring as easily as Alexander\r\nthe Great; but how it was done we do not know.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Egypt, Ptolemy found there two other states in\r\naddition to that of the Egyptians. These were the old Greek city of\r\nNaucratis and the new city of Alexandria. A third arose when he himself\r\nfounded Ptolemais to be to Upper Egypt what Alexandria was to Lower\r\nEgypt--the centre and rallying point of Hellenic interests. To these\r\nthree city-states he added a multitude of others in and about the\r\nMediterranean when he acquired for his house its foreign dominions.\r\nThe convenient thing for these to do was to bind themselves to him\r\nby the Gordian knot of religious worship; and, as Ptolemy Soter,\r\nor the Savior, he was in fact enrolled in the circle of deities\r\nrecognized by the several cities. In Alexandria we may be sure that\r\nits founder, Alexander the Great, had been accorded divine honors\r\nfrom the beginning, and that after his death the citizens appointed\r\neach year a priest of Alexander, just as they had been in the habit\r\nof doing while he was alive, and just as they appointed one for Zeus\r\nor Apollo. However, at some date between 311 and 289 B.C., perhaps on\r\nhis assumption of the regal title in 306 B.C., Ptolemy took into his\r\nown hands the administration of his capital, and thenceforth appointed\r\npersonally the priest of the city-god Alexander, who became therewith\r\nan imperial god. To this cult Philadelphus did not add that of his\r\nparents, \"the savior gods,\" when he had them officially deified at\r\ntheir death (283 B.C.); but he did add to it that of his deceased\r\nqueen and of himself when in 270 B.C. he inaugurated the worship of\r\n\"the brother gods.\" His example was followed by each succeeding pair\r\nof rulers to the end of the dynasty, except that the savior gods were\r\ninserted by the fourth Ptolemy in their proper place after Alexander.\r\nSo that central among the gods of the capital of the empire stood\r\nultimately the long series of the departed rulers and at its head the\r\nliving king and queen.\r\n\r\nOutside the capital, in the city-states of the realm, as later on in\r\nthe provinces subject to the Roman emperors, the reigning monarchs\r\nwere alone the recipients of divine honors. The living Ptolemy, by\r\nrecognizing the divinity of his predecessors, assumed responsibility\r\nfor the validity of all their _acta_. They had issued their mandates\r\n(_prostagmata_) as gods; so long as they remained gods their mandates\r\nmust be obeyed. The cities, on the other hand, had no concern except\r\nto legalize the orders issued to them by their living rulers, once\r\ntheir living rulers had legalized and thus become responsible for all\r\norders issued by the dead. At Rome the memory of certain emperors was\r\ndamned, and their acts rescinded. That was possible there because the\r\nemperor was theoretically only an officer of the Roman people. One\r\nmeans employed to invalidate the _acta_ of deposed rulers was to refuse\r\nto have them among their gods after their death. The Alexandrians had\r\nno such discretion. After about 306 B.C. they were subjects themselves,\r\nnot masters, of the Ptolemies. In their city it was the living Ptolemy\r\nwho willed his own deification, and he could withhold divine honors\r\nfrom his predecessor only when, as in the solitary case of the founder\r\nof the dynasty, the monarch neglected to have himself created a god\r\nduring his lifetime. Since his wish was decisive, it is not surprising\r\nthat he had the members of his family, his wife, sisters, children,\r\nand concubines, elevated to Olympus along with himself. Curiously\r\nenough, however, Philadelphus and his four immediate successors,\r\nwhile demanding that their subjects should worship them as deities,\r\ntreated themselves simply as kings, and carefully refrained from\r\ndescribing themselves as gods even in their public communications.\r\nThe fact seems to be that only by accepting the Egyptian theory of\r\na divine incarnation could the Ptolemies find a theological ground\r\nfor constituting themselves gods. This concession to native thinking\r\nthe proud early members of the dynasty refused, however, to make,\r\npreferring to challenge by their own self-denial the divine honors\r\nwhich they required from others. With this view accords the further\r\nfact that the first Ptolemy deliberately to court a native support for\r\nhis throne--Euergetes II--was also the first to sign his edicts as\r\nθεὁϛ, or \"god.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that no great empire ever existed without a\r\nconstitutional fiction, it is also true that it never endured on a\r\nfiction alone. The Macedonian soldiers whom Ptolemy found in Egypt and\r\nthose whom he brought with him and sent for later were essential for\r\nthe maintenance of his government. So long as the son of Alexander\r\nthe Great lived, and, indeed, for four years longer (till 306 B.C.),\r\nPtolemy was simply their general. Then he became their king, and to\r\nlegitimatize this practical usurpation, the legend arose that he\r\nwas not really the son of Lagos, but the son of Philip. It is to the\r\nhonor of Ptolemy that he had nothing to do with this libel on the good\r\nname of his mother, and preferred rather to be an illegitimate king\r\nthan an illegitimate son. Besides, it was only necessary to go back a\r\ngeneration or two to attach the line of Ptolemy to that of the ancient\r\n\"Zeus-born\" kings of Macedon. The wife of Lagos had belonged, in fact,\r\nto the royal family, as the Ptolemies took good care to observe.\r\n\r\nThe Ptolemaic empire was, accordingly, based on three concurrent\r\ntheories, one for the native Egyptians, one for the Greek city-states\r\nand one for the Macedonians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAppian of Alexandria,[90] writing about two hundred years after the\r\ndeath of Cleopatra, cites the royal registers as authority for his\r\nreport that Philadelphus kept, for land operations 200,000 foot, 40,000\r\ncavalry, and arms for 300,000 men; in addition, 300 war elephants and\r\n2000 war chariots; for naval warfare, 2000 transports, 1500 battleships\r\nwith three to five banks of rowers, and oars and rigging for twice that\r\nnumber. He had also, according to the same authority, 800 royal barges\r\nwith gilt poops and beaks, and in his treasury a reserve of 740,000\r\nEgyptian talents, or $890,000,000.\r\n\r\nThat the reserve as given amounts to three times the value of the gold\r\nand silver in the United States treasury shows that the enumeration\r\nbelongs only in the history yet to be written of the absurdities of\r\nstatistics. More credible estimates of the Egyptian army place it at\r\n80,800 under the second Ptolemy and (exclusive of natives, who then\r\nnumbered 26,000) 49,700 under the fourth Ptolemy.[91] These are very\r\nlarge totals. It will help to solve many questions of Ptolemaic policy\r\nto observe where the soldiers came from.\r\n\r\nBut first we may notice that they could not come from the natives; for\r\ntheir most important duty was to hold them in subjection. There were so\r\nmany people to keep down! Alexandria itself had a large native quarter.\r\nThe other two Greek cities in the land were but alien flecks in the\r\nmidst of a great multitude. Up and down the valley lay the native\r\nhamlets, to the number of 33,333 according to Theocritus, teeming with\r\nthe seven million people whom Egypt then sustained. Alexander the\r\nGreat may have dreamed of Hellenizing these masses; Ptolemy, however,\r\nhad no such thought, as is shown conclusively by the fact that under\r\nhis dynasty and, indeed, for at least two centuries after its fall,\r\nNaucratis, and probably also Ptolemais, forbade by law marriages\r\nbetween their citizens and the natives.[92]\r\n\r\nThe sole landowner in Egypt was the king. The entire valley of the Nile\r\nwas literally his personal estate.\r\n\r\nExcept for certain portions \"set apart\" for particular purposes, which\r\nwe shall examine in a moment, the arable land surrounding the countless\r\nnative villages was in the possession of tenants of the crown, who\r\npaid to the king about seven bushels of grain per acre as rent and\r\nsowed their land according to royal orders with seed provided by him;\r\nwho might be dispossessed at any time, but could neither abandon their\r\nplots (at least in seeding- and harvest-time) nor their villages\r\n(except for short periods), at their own volition; who had numerous\r\nservices in connection with \"geometry,\" irrigation, transport, post,\r\nand similar matters to perform, and might be moved or forced en masse\r\nto redeem and cultivate dry or marsh land situated near their hovels;\r\nwho paid a poll-tax and a house-tax to the king, and one sixth of\r\nthe yield of their vineyards and orchards, when they had any, to the\r\ntemple authorities whom the king appointed; who bought their beer, oil,\r\nfish, honey, cloth, soda, bricks, wood, paper, and almost every other\r\narticle of common use either exclusively from the king, who was the\r\nsole producer and seller, or in certain cases from private dealers,\r\nwho, however, paid so much for their license that they could not\r\nundersell the king. Watchmen were everywhere in the fields to see that\r\nthe king was not defrauded. Gendarmes patrolled the country to guard\r\nthe roads and deserts, to prevent smuggling and \"moonshining.\" Scribes\r\nand bankers were in every village to keep account of all changes in\r\nfamilies and in leases; to visé every payment. Every village had its\r\nstorehouse of records, of grain, of money. And on the Nile went to and\r\nfro the royal transports which carried the surpluses to Alexandria,\r\nand the products of the royal factories to the local depots from which\r\nthey were sold. The king of Egypt was, accordingly, by far the greatest\r\nmerchant and manufacturer in the whole world. Even in far distant Delos\r\nthe price of paper, myrrh, and other articles was fixed by the pleasure\r\nof the royal monopolist. That his interference \"regulated the market\"\r\nto his own advantage may be inferred from the fact that the sheet of\r\npaper which was sold in 296 B.C. for one obol (three and one half\r\ncents) cost on the average eleven in 279-250 B.C.[93]\r\n\r\nThus set about by countless officials and shorn to the very skin, the\r\nfellahs lived under the Ptolemies, \"patient, laborious, cheerful,\"\r\nyet filled with hidden bitterness at the magnificence in which their\r\nmasters lived at their expense in Alexandria, venting their rage in\r\nimpotent prophecies that \"the great city at the water's edge should\r\nbecome a drying-place for the nets of fishers, and its gods should\r\nmigrate to the native capital Memphis.\"[94]\r\n\r\nClearly, the army of the Ptolemies could not be recruited from such\r\nelements. The Egyptians might be put on the warships as rowers, used\r\nin the transport service, and, occasionally when the need was great,\r\nin small numbers as soldiers. But granted that they might be useful\r\nin fighting abroad,--at home they belonged to the enemy from whom the\r\nearly Ptolemies had greatly to fear.\r\n\r\nAs such, the citizens of Alexandria, Naucratis, and Ptolemais were\r\napparently exempt from military service. Hence the great problem of\r\nnational defense could not have been solved by the founding of new\r\nGreek cities of this type in Egypt had there been room for them, or by\r\nthe founding of any kind of cities, had Ptolemy thought it possible to\r\norganize the natives in urban communities round a Greek or Macedonian\r\nnucleus--as Alexander may have wished to do, as the Romans in fact did\r\nin the year 202 A.D.; for, even if Ptolemy had cared for that kind of\r\nthing, the Greek or Macedonian nucleus did not as yet exist in Egypt.\r\nIt had to be brought there from abroad. Hence it was a question of life\r\nand death for the Ptolemaic dynasty to remain in constant communication\r\nwith the regions of the eastern Mediterranean whence came supporters of\r\ntheir rule, soldiers for their armies.\r\n\r\n\"But shouldst thou really mean a voyage out,\" says one Greek peasant to\r\nanother in Theocritus,[95]--\r\n\r\n      \"The freeman's best paymaster's Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n      (_Æschines_)\r\n\r\n      What is he else?\r\n\r\n      (_Thyonichus_)\r\n\r\n                       A gentleman: a man\r\n\r\n      Of wit and taste: the top of company;\r\n      Loyal to ladies; one whose eye is keen\r\n      For friends, and keener still for enemies.\r\n      Large in his bounties, he, in kingly sort,\r\n      Denies a boon to none: but, Æschines,\r\n      One should not ask too often. This premised,\r\n      If thou wilt clasp the military cloak\r\n      O'er thy right shoulder, and with legs astride\r\n      Await the onward rush of shielded men:\r\n      Hie thee to Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nPhoenicia and its hinterland were necessary to Ptolemy because of their\r\nforests of timber for shipbuilding, which Egypt lacked. The rest of\r\nhis transmarine possessions were necessary because of their stock of\r\nreliable soldiers, which Egypt also lacked. Hence, as stated already,\r\nthe imperial policy of the early Ptolemies was a plain consequence of\r\ntheir domestic policy--of holding Egypt as a foreign country.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what they did with the store of soldiers which they\r\npossessed and with the new recruits whom they constantly added to\r\nit.[96] I have already drawn your attention to certain lands which the\r\nPtolemies \"set aside\" for particular purposes. One complex of such\r\nlands they assigned to the temples. And I may remark that while the\r\nPtolemies appointed and controlled the priests, they also conciliated\r\nthem, by leaving them valuable perquisites, paying to them stated sums\r\nannually, building new temples and repairing old ones, and allowing\r\nthem to make for their own consumption the various articles which they\r\ncould buy only at the royal counters and at monopolistic prices. They\r\nalso set their land aside in a favored category. What is common to this\r\ncategory is not a single fiscal arrangement, but a relinquishing by the\r\nking of his right of direct management. To its members he binds himself\r\nin a way that does not impair his ownership, but does restrict his\r\nability to take possession.\r\n\r\nTo this category belong the \"gifts\" of large blocks of land with\r\ntheir villages to his courtiers, who received them free from rent\r\nand taxes. The \"friends\" of the Ptolemies, though they resided in\r\nAlexandria, were thus landed proprietors, absentee landlords, who\r\nmaintained their luxurious establishments in the capital on the rents\r\nwhich their Egyptian tenants paid. Common soldiers could not expect\r\nto become feudal lords by entering Ptolemy's service. But for his\r\n\"loyal comrades,\" as Theocritus[97] calls them,--his officers, court\r\ndignitaries, and favorites,--he had such benefices to confer.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary men-at-arms lots of land all over Egypt were\r\nassigned; to those of the guard and the cavalry, sixty-five and\r\nforty-five acre farms, to the infantrymen, farms of twenty acres.\r\nFor Egyptian conditions these were very large units, and since\r\nunder Philadelphus--who perfected this system of farming out his\r\nsoldiers--the army consisted of 57,600 foot and 23,200 horsemen, over\r\none quarter of all the arable land in Egypt would have been in their\r\npossession, if only land naturally watered by the Nile had been given\r\nto them, and if none of them were mercenaries serving only for hire.\r\nMany, however, were doubtless mercenaries of this type; and to the\r\nrest, land was commonly distributed which needed some expenditure of\r\ncapital and energy to be reclaimed from the desert or the water. Of\r\nthis kind of land the Ptolemies evidently inherited a goodly quantity\r\nfrom the Persians, whose government had been rendered inefficient in\r\nthe fourth century B.C. by frequent revolts of the natives.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers might sublet their lots in whole or part and live in\r\nAlexandria or elsewhere. Or they might take possession and till them\r\nwith their own hands. To facilitate the actual distribution of the\r\narmy over the country, the king attached to the lots \"quarters\" on\r\nthe premises of the neighboring Egyptians. This was not at all to the\r\nliking of the latter, as the following letter of a quartermaster to a\r\ncounty official shows:[98] \"We have discovered that certain owners of\r\nhouses in Crocodilopolis, which were once used for quartering troops,\r\nhave taken off the roofs, and walled up the doors and built altars in\r\ntheir places. This they have done so as not to have them occupied. If\r\nthen you agree, in view of the shortage of quarters, write Agenor that\r\nhe make the owners of the houses take the altars down, and build them\r\nup again better than before upon the most suitable and conspicuous\r\nparts of the roofs, so that we may be able to take possession.\" The\r\ngods had never objected to having old altars replaced by finer ones.\r\nHenceforth, not the entrances, but the roofs, were to be protected by\r\nreligion. The ancient quartermaster knew his business.\r\n\r\nIt was decidedly to the interest of the government that it should have\r\na sort of garrison in residence in all the _nomes_, or counties, of\r\nEgypt--trained soldiers ready to take their places in their companies\r\nat the command of the chief nome official, who was also their general.\r\n\r\nThese men were by no means all Macedonians or Greeks. Some of them\r\nwere Persians who had been in the land when Ptolemy arrived; some were\r\nLibyans, Jews, Thracians, Mysians, Galatians; nearly all were from the\r\nregions tapped by the empire of the Ptolemies.\r\n\r\nThey paid no rents for their lots, no poll-tax, and one tenth, in\r\nplace of one sixth, of the yield of their gardens and orchards. Like\r\nthe Hellenes generally, they might give commutation money in lieu of\r\nmanual labor on dykes and canals. In other respects they were taxed\r\nrather more severely than the \"royal tenants\"; and, in addition, they\r\nhad to pay certain feudal \"aids\" to the king. If they failed to pay\r\nthese \"aids,\" or if they fell in arrears with their taxes, they lost\r\ntheir holdings. Hence they were under a financial constraint to make\r\nthe land, which they commonly received as waste land, productive. The\r\nsoldiers were, accordingly, the \"pioneers\" of Ptolemaic Egypt, steadily\r\nat work enlarging the arable areas of the country and redressing the\r\nagricultural wrongs which it had sustained during the troubles of the\r\nlater Persian régime.\r\n\r\nTheir lots reverted to the king when they died or left the army. The\r\nking could then add them to his domain or reassign them to other\r\nsoldiers. During the imperial period of Ptolemaic history he seems to\r\nhave taken the former course whenever the land was in a condition to\r\nbring him in a rent in addition to the taxes. However, from the very\r\nbeginning, he undertook to make a new or a re-grant to the sons of dead\r\nor superannuated soldiers who were trained for military service. These\r\nwere officially designated \"men of the _epigone_, or increase,\" and\r\nthey entered the army at the same time that they entered upon their\r\ninheritance. In this way the Ptolemies bred a crop of new soldiers\r\nin Egypt, so that they might look forward to being gradually less\r\ndependent upon mercenaries recruited from beyond the seas. Egypt was\r\nbeing enriched by a new military caste which should take the place by\r\nthe side of the new dynasty which the \"_machimoi_\" or \"warriors\" had\r\noccupied during the old days of the native Pharaohs.\r\n\r\nMultiracial though the soldiers were, they all spoke Greek. They had\r\nto regulate their private conduct and their business affairs by the\r\nspecial laws established in Egypt for the benefit of the various ethne,\r\nor nationalities, to which they belonged. For in Ptolemaic Egypt,\r\nas in the Turkish empire to-day, foreigners brought their own legal\r\nrestrictions and safeguards with them, which, however, were formulated,\r\nfor use in the Ptolemaic courts, in ethnic codes. These codes, however,\r\nwere either couched originally in Greek, or, like the laws of Moses,\r\nwhich the Jews observed, they were translated into Greek at an early\r\ndate. How much political freedom the various nations enjoyed, it\r\nis difficult to say; but in general they seem to have tempered the\r\nabsolutism of the Ptolemies only where they were massed together in\r\nlarge numbers, as in Memphis and, above all, Alexandria. Elsewhere the\r\nethnic groups were, doubtless, constituted chiefly of the territorial\r\nsoldiers, or _cleruchs_, as they were called.[99] These, however,\r\nceased to have any civil rights when called by the king into active\r\nservice. With them political agitation could become effective only when\r\nit became mutiny.\r\n\r\nProminent among the institutions which the Hellenic and Hellenized\r\nforeigners brought into Egypt were those that centred in the gymnasia.\r\nSome of them were, doubtless, at first and for long, a subject of\r\nscandal and wonderment to the natives. As the Greeks ran and tumbled\r\nstark naked in the palæstræ, or in the contests for which, as for the\r\narmy, the palæstræ were the training-grounds, the story of Heracles and\r\nBusiris was constantly reënacted; except that in time Busiris came to\r\nsee whence sprang the strength which he could not resist. It was in the\r\ngymnasia also that the Greeks received their higher education and by\r\nits means that they secured for their sons the ideas which the poetry\r\nand philosophy of Hellas alone could give. In the gymnasia temples of\r\nHellenism appeared in county after county of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe foreigners brought with them into Egypt their native religions,\r\nand, when they were not monotheists like the Jews, they came easily\r\ninto sympathy with the myriad cults of the natives. A religious\r\n_rapprochement_ was thus established and a bi-religious _milieu_\r\ncreated, by which a new half-Greek, half-Egyptian god, Sarapis,\r\nwhom Ptolemy I introduced from Sinope, prospered. Before long this\r\nJanus-like deity, who was endowed with a sanctity and miraculous\r\npower which hoary Egypt could alone give, and with a plastic beauty\r\npeculiarly Greek, became distinctively _the_ great god of Egypt,\r\nand, in conjunction with Isis, Anubis, and Harpocrates, the most\r\nactive religious force in the whole world of the Ptolemaic empire.\r\nSarapis-Osiris, the monarch, judge, and savior of the world of the\r\ndead: Ptolemy-Pharaoh, the monarch, judge, and savior of the world\r\nof the living;--these two and these two alone received the divine\r\nhomage of Greeks and Egyptians alike. The early Ptolemies willed\r\nthe impossible; to accept the native deities, cults, creeds, and\r\nhierarchies as the active element in the fused Græco-Egyptian religion;\r\nto let the two civilizations represented in their realm coalesce in so\r\nfar as their religious ideas, practices, aspirations, and hopes were\r\nconcerned; and at the same time to keep them apart in other respects:\r\nto preserve in other matters the unapproachable superiority of the\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertainly, success in this attempt to graft the ancient religion which\r\nhe as Pharaoh was bound to accept and preserve on the new stock of\r\nHellenism without corrupting the fine flavor of the fruit hitherto\r\nborne by it in Greece, depended on making the Greek cities, Alexandria,\r\nNaucratis, and Ptolemais, and the Græco-Macedonian military colonies\r\nsimply the Egyptian portion of a Græco-Macedonian realm reaching over\r\nthe seas to the head of the Ægean. This necessary support to his\r\nposition in Egypt the third Ptolemy jeopardized when he neglected to\r\nreplace the great fleet after 242 B.C. For twenty long years, moreover,\r\nhe left his army at work farming in Egypt, with the inevitable result\r\nthat it became immobile. Such a neglect of military matters seemed\r\nwarranted by the impotence of his two great rivals. For during this\r\nentire period Asia was rent by a dynastic struggle and Macedon was\r\nparalyzed by a general insurrection in Greece. His weak and indolent\r\nson paid the penalty for his father's neglect. By strengthening his\r\narmy with 26,000 natives, whom he armed and drilled in the Macedonian\r\nfashion (221-217 B.C.), he saved the empire for seventeen years, when\r\nit fell before the combined attack of Macedon and Syria (202-200 B.C.);\r\nbut he tempted the Egyptians to lay claim with the sword to partnership\r\nwith the foreigners in the government. Thus presented, their claim was\r\nrejected, as was natural; but once the empire was lost and the flow of\r\nimmigration into Egypt ceased, the Ptolemies of the \"domestic\" period\r\nwere forced to acknowledge its justice.\r\n\r\nThey constituted their territorial army more and more from native\r\nsoldiers, to whom they gave increasingly larger lots, while they\r\nprogressively diminished the size of those held by the foreigners. They\r\nceased to take back the holdings on the death or superannuation of the\r\noccupants, thus admitting the right of sons and other male descendants\r\nto get, in return for military service, not dry or marsh land, as in\r\nthe early days, but land already redeemed by their father's capital and\r\nlabor. Soldiers ceased to be soldiers spending their spare time winning\r\nnew land from the desert and the swamp for their master's estate; and\r\nbecame farmers to whom service in the army was a nuisance and a loss.\r\nThe army became thereby hopelessly immobile.\r\n\r\nThe age was generally one of economic decline and not of economic\r\nadvance; for Egypt had gained more, as the sequel proved, from the\r\nvigorous government of the early Ptolemies than it had lost by the\r\nexpenditure of its surpluses on the empire. In this decadent age the\r\nEgyptians gained admission freely to the police and administrative\r\nservice as well as to the army. Thus elevated in social esteem,\r\nthey were able to intermarry with their ancient lords; so that a\r\nconsiderable half-breed and bilingual population developed--Greek in\r\nthe outward things, fellaheen, according to Polybius, in character and\r\nculture. Alexandria, he says,[100] \"three strata occupy: the Egyptian\r\nand the native race, sharp and (un)civilized. Then the mercenary\r\ntroops, oppressive and numerous and dissolute; for from old custom\r\nthey kept armed troops who had learned to rule rather than to obey, on\r\naccount of the worthlessness of the kings. The third stratum was that\r\nof the Alexandrians, nor was even this truly a civilized population\r\nowing to the same causes, but yet better than the other two, for though\r\nof mixed breed, yet they were originally Greeks, with traditions of\r\nthe general type of the Greeks. But this part of the population having\r\ndisappeared mainly owing to Ptolemy Euergetes Physkon (145-116 B.C.) in\r\nwhose reign Polybius visited Alexandria,--for Physkon, when revolted\r\nagainst, over and over again let loose his troops on the population and\r\nmassacred them,--and such being the state of things, to visit Egypt was\r\na long and thankless journey.\" Foreign enemies the omnipotent Roman\r\nSenate kept off during the second century B.C.\r\n\r\nBut unnerved by the menacing patronage of the great republic, the\r\nPtolemies, now represented by men of vigor and no character or of\r\ncharacter and no vigor; by women, who were sprung mostly from adelphic\r\nunions, of remarkable ability, beauty, and morals, prefaced with a\r\nperiod of long-continued dynastic and national strife the dramatic\r\nepoch of Ptolemy the Piper and Cleopatra the Great.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n 1.

On the establishment of the regency this\r\nvast district had been divided among over twenty satraps. Ten years\r\nafterwards, in the fall of 313 B.C., one of these, Antigonus, known\r\nin history as Monophthalmus, or the \"One-eyed,\" had now held for two\r\nyears all the territory that lay between the fan-shaped offshoots of\r\nthe Himalaya Mountains and the sea. The whole Asiatic coast of the\r\nMediterranean from the Hellespont to Gaza on the Egyptian frontier was\r\nin his possession. His fleet ruled the sea.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 312 B.C. was one of the most critical moments in ancient\r\nhistory. In Antigonus the man seemed come with the will, ability,\r\nand power to take the place of Alexander. By his side stood a son\r\nof remarkable attractiveness and brilliancy, Demetrius, surnamed\r\nPoliorcetes, or \"Taker-of-Cities\"; so that a dynasty seemed assured.\r\n\r\nThe work to be done was plainly indicated and preparations for its\r\naccomplishment were already completed. After having stirred up an\r\ninsurrection in Greece in the preceding year, the fleet of Antigonus\r\nhad joined his main army which was massed at the Hellespont in\r\nreadiness to cross into Europe for the conquest of Thrace and\r\nMacedon. In this district Antigonus conducted operations in person.\r\nHis son Demetrius was stationed with a minor army in Palestine with\r\ninstructions to avoid an engagement, and simply to keep Ptolemy cooped\r\nup in Egypt till the European campaign was ended. If beaten in his\r\nattack on Thrace and Macedon, Antigonus had nothing serious to fear so\r\nlong as he was master of the sea; if victorious, he could then fall\r\nwith irresistible force upon Egypt and complete the unification of\r\nAlexander's empire. The whole campaign was admirably planned and the\r\ntroops well distributed for its successful execution.[101]\r\n\r\nThat it did not even get started was partly due to Ptolemy, who,\r\nimpelled by the magnitude of his danger, took the desperate step of\r\nadding many natives to his army; and partly due to Demetrius, who,\r\ndespite his numerical inferiority, his instructions, and the judgment\r\nof his staff officers, risked a pitched battle at Gaza, and was\r\ndecisively defeated. That the project could never again be renewed on\r\nsimilarly advantageous terms was due to Seleucus, the son of Antiochus.\r\nFor taking a thousand men with him this accomplished officer, old in\r\nservice though still young in years, set out straightway after the\r\nbattle of Gaza for Babylon, his own satrapy, whence he had fled to\r\nEgypt for fear of Antigonus four years earlier. Ten years afterwards,\r\nin 302 B.C., when Antigonus again proceeded to conquer Macedon and\r\nThrace, after having beaten Ptolemy back into Egypt, his great aim\r\nwas frustrated, not only because the king of Thrace, Lysimachus,\r\noutmanoeuvred him by getting an army across into Asia Minor, but also\r\nbecause Seleucus, now master of all the territory in the rear of\r\nAntigonus between the Euphrates and the frontiers of India, threw the\r\ndecisive weight of his new army into the scale, and joined Lysimachus\r\nin crushing their common enemy at the great battle of Ipsus in 301 B.C.\r\n\r\nThereby Seleucus advanced his western frontier from the Euphrates to\r\nthe edge of the Mediterranean, shifted his capital from Babylon to\r\nnewly founded Antioch, and brought his empire into immediate proximity\r\nwith the districts whence alone Greek and Macedonian immigrants could\r\ncome. The Seleucids dated the founding of their dynasty from the return\r\nof Seleucus to Babylon in 312 B.C. There is, however, much to be said\r\nfor the view that their empire was first established after the battle\r\nof Ipsus.\r\n\r\nFor the next twenty years (301-281 B.C.) Seleucus had the great good\r\nfortune to remain in secure possession of the vast territory which\r\ncalled him king; and while he failed to pass on to his descendants all\r\nthe fruits of his crowning victory over Lysimachus at Corupedion in 282\r\nB.C., he left to his son Antiochus I, surnamed Soter, or the Savior,\r\nand he in turn about twenty years later, to _his_ son Antiochus II,\r\nsurnamed Theos, or the God, the fabric of their dominions, somewhat\r\ntattered at the edges, to be sure, but otherwise whole.\r\n\r\nThe evil genius of the Seleucid empire during the century when it\r\nwas a great power was a woman--Laodice, the wife of Antiochus II and\r\nmother of his successor, Seleucus II, surnamed Callinicus, or the\r\nGlorious Victor (246-226 B.C.). Her power as queen is attested by\r\nother evidences, and also by the fact that she was associated with\r\nthe king in the worship accorded by the satrapies of the realm to\r\ntheir rulers, every satrapy being required by Theos to establish a\r\nchief-priesthood in her especial honor.[102] None the less, she had\r\nto yield her place to Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus,\r\nwhen that crafty monarch seduced her husband from his alliance with\r\nMacedon by giving to him along with his daughter a prodigious dowry\r\nand extensive territorial concessions (249 B.C.). She retired to Asia\r\nMinor, where she owned large estates secured in earlier days at the\r\nexpense of the royal domain, and where she could live in almost regal\r\nstate. For the death of her former husband, which occurred three\r\nyears later, she was probably not responsible,--though rumor held her\r\nguilty,--since Theos had already, on his deathbed apparently, and for\r\nreasons of sound dynastic policy, designated her oldest son, then a\r\n\"youth nearing manhood,\" as his successor, to the exclusion of the boy\r\nwith whom his Egyptian queen had recently presented him. Nor is she\r\nto be condemned harshly for having had her rival and her son's rival\r\nput out of the way; for she acted not only in self-defense, but also\r\nto save the Seleucid empire from becoming simply an appanage of Egypt\r\nduring the long minority of Berenice's child. For conducting to a\r\nsuccessful termination, despite initial disasters, the campaign against\r\nPtolemy III, by which she put her son in possession of his throne, she\r\nis deserving of high credit. It was when this was accomplished, and her\r\nson was king, that her ambition led her into maternal and political\r\ncrime; for, in order to retain the government, which her oldest son,\r\nnow arrived at years of discretion, threatened to take from her, she\r\nset up against him her younger son Antiochus, surnamed the Hawk, for\r\nwhom she got the administration of Asia Minor. The Seleucids became\r\nthereby divided against themselves, and for twenty years (242-223 B.C.)\r\nthey were so weakened by a dynastic feud that they not only neglected\r\nvital questions of foreign policy, but had to permit the total loss of\r\ncertain frontier satrapies and the rebellion of almost all the rest.\r\nAntiochus III, surnamed the Great, opened his reign with an error--the\r\nattempt to deal with the foreign situation before he had put his house\r\nin order; and he ended it with a great disaster--his irreparable defeat\r\nby the Romans at Magnesia in 190 B.C.; but in between he restored\r\nhis authority over what Bevan in his _House of Seleucus_ calls \"the\r\nessential body of the Empire\" and his suzerainty over its \"outside\r\nsphere.\" The latter he accomplished by an impressive campaign, in\r\nArmenia (where ruled Xerxes, betrayed by his name as an Iranian), in\r\nParthia (where Arsaces, the third king of a barbarian line from the\r\nTuranian desert, which had mastered that country a little less than\r\nforty years before, had just come to the throne), in Bactria (where\r\nEuthydemus, a Greek from Magnesia, had recently founded a new Hellenic\r\ndynasty in the place of an old one established nearly fifty years\r\nearlier by Diodotus, \"lord of the thousand Bactrian cities,\" as he is\r\ncalled), and in India, where a certain Sophragasenus, following the\r\nexamples of Arsaces and Euthydemus, recognized the superior power of\r\nthe Seleucid.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Antioch after five years of marching and fighting in\r\nthe Far East (210-205 B.C.), Antiochus wrested Palestine from the now\r\nfeeble grasp of the Ptolemies. This exploit gave him the long-desired,\r\nlong-lacked, and long-fought-for access to the sea; and for the first\r\ntime in the history of the realm an opportunity was secured for the\r\nconstruction of a great fleet. Simultaneously, Philip of Macedon fell\r\nbefore the Romans at Cynocephalæ (197 B.C.); whereupon Antiochus went\r\nvigorously to work dislodging all \"foreigners\" from the Mediterranean\r\nseaboard of Asia Minor. This led in 192 B.C. to conflict with Rome.\r\n\r\nAntiochus the Great has been late in coming into his due.[103] The mere\r\nfact that Hannibal, whom the undying hatred of Rome had driven into his\r\nservice, worked out for him a plan of campaign against the Romans which\r\nhe rejected, and that he put the greatest general of his age in charge\r\nof a new squadron of his extemporized fleet, have sufficed to rule out\r\nof court in advance any apology for his defeat. The issue showed that\r\nthe view taken by Hannibal of the power of Rome was right. It is true\r\nthat it could have been checked only by a great combination of all the\r\nMediterranean states. But it is equally true that such a combination\r\nwas impracticable. Antiochus had to deal with the situation as he found\r\nit. He risked too much for a few frontier districts and a possible\r\nhegemony in Greece. But he seems to have greatly underestimated the\r\npower of Rome, and to have credited the Senate with far less energy and\r\ntenacity of purpose than it actually possessed. Once his vanguard was\r\nthrown out of Greece by the incomparable Roman legions, his main hope\r\nof defending Asia Minor did actually rest with his fleet. Hannibal was,\r\naccordingly, in the right place. But the fleet was too new and too weak\r\nas well as too scattered to hold the Romans in Europe; and, once the\r\nveterans of the Second Punic War were across the Hellespont, no army in\r\nAsia could have resisted them.\r\n\r\nThe Seleucids learned a terrible lesson on the battle-fields of\r\nThermopylæ and Magnesia: the fatality was that all the peoples in Asia\r\nlearned it also. That Antiochus the Great consented to surrender all\r\nhis possessions in Asia Minor and to pay to the Romans an indemnity\r\nof one thousand talents a year for twelve years; to hand over his\r\nbattleships and to limit his fleet to ten decked vessels and a few\r\nsmall craft; to give up all his war elephants and to keep no others\r\nin the future; to take no Italians into his service as mercenaries,\r\nand to throw open his empire to the merchants and traders from Rhodes,\r\nproclaimed only too clearly to the Orientals that the days of the\r\nlordship of the Macedonians in the world were past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, till after the untimely death of his son,\r\nAntiochus IV, surnamed Epiphanes, or the \"God Manifest,\" in 164 B.C.\r\nthat the storm broke in all its fury. The forces then set in motion for\r\nthe destruction of the Seleucid empire were of two kinds, external and\r\ninternal. Of the external forces we have already considered one--the\r\nadvance of the Roman power toward the East. The Roman Senate had at\r\nthis time only one concern in its dealings with Syria, namely, to make\r\nthe Seleucids harmless. This it accomplished in a variety of ways.\r\nImmediately after the death of Antiochus IV, it sent commissioners\r\ninto Syria who executed an unenforced article of the treaty struck\r\nafter the battle of Magnesia: they burnt the Seleucid battleships found\r\nin the cities of Phoenicia and hamstrung the war elephants which\r\nthey discovered in the royal arsenals. By jealously restricting the\r\nmilitary establishment of the Seleucids the Senate broke their power\r\nin all respects. Not content, however, with binding the feet of its\r\nvictim, the Senate held out an encouraging hand to all rebels against\r\nhis authority. A case in point is that of the Jews. Again and again,\r\nbetween 164 and 120 B.C., Judas and Jonathan Maccabæus and Hyrcanus I\r\nsought and obtained Roman recognition in their struggle against their\r\noverlords. They had national causes for their repeated outbreaks and\r\nreligious stimuli to resist desperately, but it is doubtful whether\r\nthey could have carried their war of independence to a successful\r\ntermination without the assurance that Rome sympathized with their\r\nenterprise. The Senate helped on the disruption of the Seleucid realm\r\nby still another unfriendly act: it joined with Pergamum and Egypt in\r\nlighting the fire of dynastic war in Syria in 153 B.C. and in adding\r\nfuel to it from time to time thereafter, with the result that the realm\r\nwas devastated by civil war almost continuously from that date till\r\nthe end of the dynasty, ninety years later. Then, the blackened hulk,\r\nmanned by a mutinous crew, lay helpless in a sea infested with pirates,\r\nwhen Pompey picked it up and towed it into a Roman harbor.\r\n\r\nThe other external force which contributed to this inglorious end\r\nof a voyage begun with such fair promise was set in motion from the\r\nFarthest East. I do not reckon it in this account that the Parthians\r\nagain rebelled and in 140 B.C. advanced their western frontier to the\r\nEuphrates, thus forming the philhellen kingdom of west Iran which grew\r\nbehind the breastwork of the Seleucid empire to such power that later\r\nit disputed with some success Rome's claim to suzerainty in Asia. Nor\r\ndo I enter it here that Armenia established its complete independence,\r\nand under Tigranes the Great annexed for a time (83-69 B.C.) all of\r\nthe Seleucid realm then remaining. For these are internal movements\r\nanalogous to the insurrection of the Jews. It was from the banks of the\r\nHoang-Ho that an advance toward the west occurred in the early part of\r\nthe second century B.C. which may be paralleled with the simultaneous\r\nadvance eastward of the Roman power from the banks of the Tiber.[104]\r\nThe oncoming Eastern assailant was the conglomerate of Indo-European\r\npeoples whom the Chinese call the Yue Tchi. They came along the edges\r\nof the great desert of shifting sand in Eastern Turkestan down which\r\nflows the mouthless Tarim River, not with the _élan_ of conquerors,\r\nbut retreating slowly before the superior strength of the Huns (Hioung\r\nNou), their former subjects, with whom they had recently fought an\r\nunsuccessful war for the possession of North China. It was against\r\ntheir conquerors, we may remark in passing, that the Chinese emperors,\r\nChi-Houang-ti and Wou-ti of the Ts'in and Han Dynasties respectively,\r\nconstructed in the third and second centuries B.C., to the south of\r\nthe Desert of Gobi, the great Chinese _Limes_, or Wall. In 159 B.C.\r\nthe Yue Tchi occupied Sogdiana. Twenty years later (139 B.C.) they\r\ncrushed the Greek kingdom of Bactria; so that in this general region\r\nit was only in India, in the vast district drained by the Indus River,\r\nthat Greek kingdoms existed thereafter. Somewhere near the opening of\r\nthe Christian era these, too, succumbed to the Yue Tchi, now properly\r\ndesignated Indo-Scythians by the Greeks. For several centuries the\r\nIndo-Scythians, like the Huns who followed them in the fifth century\r\nof our era, and the Turks who followed the Huns in the sixth, kept\r\nopen the trade routes along which they had themselves advanced when\r\ndriven westward from the Hoang-Ho. Their successors transmitted to\r\nthe frontiers of China Manichæism, the cosmopolitan religion of Iran:\r\n_they_ did a greater work. They not only forwarded Buddhism to the\r\nChinese; but before it, and with it, the pure as well as the debased\r\nart of Greece. Among the priceless treasures which Dr. Stein has\r\nbrought back from the desert cities of Cathay, none are more remarkable\r\nthan certain clay seals attached to documents of the third century of\r\nour era, found at Niya in a district then under Chinese control;[105]\r\nfor one of them might have been made for Diodotus, the first Greek\r\nking of Bactria, while on others appears Athena Alcis, the haughty,\r\nhelmeted, _promachus_ Athena, hurling the thunderbolt, whom the\r\nAntigonid kings of Macedon and the Greek kings of India had put on\r\ntheir coins.[106] Not without some reason, therefore, is the view now\r\nbeing advanced that the art of China and Japan is derived, like that of\r\nEurope and America, from Greek sources.[107] It is an amazing spectacle\r\nto observe how Hellenistic civilization flowed simultaneously back the\r\nchannels to the springs in Italy and China whence came the floods which\r\noverwhelmed the Seleucid empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter this rapid survey of the political history of the Seleucids,\r\nI wish to devote the remainder of this chapter to considering the\r\ndomestic policy of the dynasty. I shall point out that Seleucus and his\r\nsuccessors continued Alexander the Great's work of founding city-states\r\nin Asia, and that, having to deal with priestly communities and feudal\r\nlords as well as with the occupants of the widespread royal domains,\r\nthey refused to exempt from their direct control any lands not placed\r\nunder the jurisdiction of a city-state. I shall discuss briefly the\r\ninternal structure of the city-states and more at length their relation\r\nin theory and fact to the monarch. This will finally bring up for\r\nexamination the policy of Antiochus IV, in whose reign the internal as\r\nwell as the external development of the Seleucid empire culminated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeleucus had been advanced to high position in Alexander's service\r\nafter Alexander had disclosed his purpose of fusing the Macedonians,\r\nGreeks, and Iranians into a new cosmopolitan race. The promotion\r\nobtained by him during the course of the bitter struggle which this\r\npolicy occasioned suggests that he made Alexander's point of view his\r\nown. This surmise as to the attitude of Seleucus is confirmed by the\r\nfact that he took his place, after Alexander's death, with those who\r\nupheld the cause of Alexander's family, and left it for his Babylonian\r\nsatrapy only when it became clear that to remain meant to perish\r\nwithout accomplishing anything.\r\n\r\nSeleucus was the only one of the great Macedonian captains who did not\r\ntake Alexander's death as a license to discard their Iranian wives. The\r\nBactrian maiden assigned to him at the great Susian marriage--Apama,\r\ndaughter of Spitamenes--became his queen and the mother of his heir,\r\nAntiochus. The Seleucid dynasty was, accordingly, half Iranian from\r\nthe start; and for the policy which it inherited from Antigonus and\r\nAlexander, and which it prosecuted vigorously till the death of\r\nAntiochus IV in 164 B.C., namely, the Hellenization of Asia, it had as\r\nwarrant the practice of its idealized founder.\r\n\r\nOf the Greek cities which Seleucus planted in his realm, fifty-nine\r\nare named by Appian.[108] They lay especially in Syria, in the district\r\nbetween the Euphrates and the sea which he sought to make a second\r\nMacedonia. His son Antiochus, to whom he gave the administration of the\r\neastern satrapies in 293 B.C., was particularly active in developing\r\ncities on the Greek model in that region; and to him and his son\r\nAntiochus Theos belongs the honor of establishing the urban habits of\r\nHellenic life in the interior of Asia Minor. In the arm of their realm\r\nwhich reached through this peninsula to the rear of the Greek strip\r\non the Anatolian coast, new cities sprang up under their auspices by\r\nthe score. Nor did the movement come to an end with the reign of the\r\nsecond Antiochus in 246 B.C., though it probably weakened at that time.\r\nOver two generations later, in the reign of Antiochus IV, it was again\r\nresumed actively and directed especially into Palestine, which had been\r\nnewly added to the realm.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature in the internal policy of the Seleucids is\r\nthe attempted transfer into Asia of the urban form of life theretofore\r\ncharacteristic of Hellas. Evidently, these monarchs believed with\r\nAristotle, Alexander, and, we may add, Polybius, and, indeed, all\r\nGreeks, that men who did not live in cities were uncivilized men.\r\nEvidently, too, they thought it wise and possible to civilize their\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to form a definite impression of the political\r\nsituation in the Seleucid realm when the Macedonians first took\r\npossession, but cities in the Greek sense seem to have been entirely\r\nabsent. This does not mean that towns were lacking altogether,\r\nsince, even if we disregard administrative centres like Babylon,\r\nSusa, Ecbatana, Persepolis, we may use the term \"town\" properly of\r\nplaces like Bambyce in Syria, fourteen miles west of the Euphrates.\r\nThere, in a fertile, well-watered valley, stood a famous temple of\r\nAtargatis, the Syrian goddess. It was a wonderful establishment, as\r\nreaders of Lucian know, with its wide approaches, its obelisk-like\r\n_phalli_, its sacred fish-pond, its shocking rites. At its head were\r\nemasculated priests, who not only conducted the ceremonies and directed\r\na far-reaching proselytism, but also governed the community of temple\r\nslaves (_hieroduli_) who tilled the land of the neighborhood for\r\ntheir own support and that of the church. This clerical form of local\r\norganization had been carefully fostered by the Persians. We all know\r\nhow in reorganizing Judæa they put the common people, who were there\r\nsimply to pay tithes, under the control of the high priest, elders, and\r\nLevites, and made the so-called law of Moses the civil law of the land.\r\nThey proceeded in similar fashion throughout Asia Minor. There Seleucus\r\nfound scores of towns, big and little, to which the description, given\r\nby Strabo[109] of the sacred city of Ma at Comana in Cappadocia, is\r\napplicable: \"In itself it is,\" he says, \"a notable city, but most of\r\nits inhabitants are god-possessed, or temple slaves. They are all of\r\nCataonian stock and are subject generally to the authority of the\r\nking, but are under the immediate control of the priest. He is lord at\r\nonce of the temple and of the temple slaves, of whom there were more\r\nthan six thousand, including men and women, at the time of my visit.\r\nAttached to the temple is much land, of which the priest enjoys the\r\nrevenues, and there is no one in Cappadocia of higher dignity than he\r\nexcept the king.\" Similar to this was the temple of Zeus at Venasa with\r\nits three thousand temple slaves and its land which yielded to its\r\npriest an annual income of twenty thousand dollars (fifteen talents);\r\nthe temple of Zeus Asbamæus near Tyana, of Apollo in Cataonia, Mater\r\nZizimene near Iconium, and Artemis Perasia in Castabala. Similar, too,\r\nwas the temple of Ma in Pontic Comana with its swarming mart, its wide\r\nacres, and its six thousand temple slaves, of whom the young women,\r\nhere as elsewhere, were sacred prostitutes; the temple of Anaitis in\r\nZela, of Men in Cabira, of Selene in Iberia, of the Great Mother at\r\nPessinus, of Zeus at Olba, and of other gods in other places scattered\r\nthrough Phrygia, Pisidia, and Lydia, as well as Palestine, Syria, and\r\nBabylonia. The Seleucids must have found the body of their empire\r\nthickly studded with religious communities, each subject to its own\r\ncode of divine law, each dominated by a masterful and long-petted\r\ntheocracy. Under this baleful rule the whole country had settled\r\ngradually down during the Persian time in progressive political and\r\neconomic stagnation.\r\n\r\nApart from the mountains and the deserts, where tribal and nomadic\r\nliberty reigned,--a constant menace to central government,--the peoples\r\nof Asia lived in villages when the Macedonians came. Many of these\r\nvillages, villagers and all, were owned by princelings and noblemen,\r\nwho, if natives, had been undisturbed by the Persians, if Iranians,\r\nhad come into their possessions by reason of royal grants. All through\r\nSyria and Asia Minor may be seen to-day the ruins of \"square towers\"\r\n(_tetrapyrgiæ_) and manorial castles such as these grandees built and\r\nfortified for defense against their neighbors and, if need be, against\r\nthe royal authority itself.[110] Those who built them had apparently\r\nhad little loyalty to the Persian king, but also little inclination to\r\nobey his successor. They were, accordingly, ejected right and left. Of\r\nthe estates thus obtained, the Macedonian kings could dispose at their\r\npleasure. They formed again part of the royal domain, which stretched\r\nin all directions at the edges of the deserts and the mountains, among\r\nthe temple lands, the feudal fiefs, and administrative cities--a\r\nveritable archipelago of landed property, tilled for the crown by\r\nmyriads of royal serfs. Here was the ὑλη the material, of which the\r\nSeleucids founded many of their city-states.\r\n\r\nThe handle for reorganization which the priestly towns offered to the\r\nnew government was often the non-ecclesiastical part of the population.\r\nThat the temple was regularly the centre of local trade and the scene\r\nof a recurrent bazaar tempted to its proximity money-changers and the\r\nlike. When the Greek immigration began this element was naturally\r\nstrengthened. It was, therefore, possible for the Seleucids to give it\r\nan urban organization--a general assembly, a council, and magistrates;\r\nand in this way to create a new city-state.\r\n\r\nAccording to invariable Greek practice, however, such a city\r\ncontrolled--with certain limitations--its own shrines. The great\r\ntemples of Apollo at Delphi and Delos, for example, were governed\r\nby the citizens of those towns. Hence the natural policy for\r\nthe Seleucids, and the one which they in fact followed wherever\r\npracticable, was to subordinate the high priests and clergy to the\r\nadjacent urban authorities, thus solving the ecclesiastical question\r\nin a way convenient for themselves and agreeable to European feeling.\r\nWhere this did not prove practicable, they often despoiled the temple\r\nof its lands for the benefit of their followers. Thus the village of\r\nBætocæce was taken from the local temple of Zeus and given to a certain\r\nDemetrius, and the sacred land of Zeus of Æzani was divided into lots,\r\nwhich were assigned to cleruchs, subjected to a tax, and attached to\r\nthe financial jurisdiction of an adjoining city.[111] It is simply\r\nanother aspect of the same general policy when king after king sought\r\nto lay \"impious\" hands upon the treasures stored up in the temples of\r\nBel, Anaitis, Atargatis, and Jehovah.\r\n\r\nThe secularization of religious properties was a very difficult\r\nmatter, and it was not pushed at all times with equal vigor by the\r\nSeleucids. When the monarchs were embarrassed by foreign or domestic\r\ntroubles, they had to conciliate the priests even to the point of\r\nundoing what they had already done. How easily a reaction might occur\r\nwe can perceive from the case recorded in the splendid inscription\r\nwhich Mr. Butler has recently found cut on the inner wall of the great\r\ntemple of Artemis at Sardis.[112] A certain Mnesimachus, presumably\r\na Macedonian officer or adventurer, had got a huge fief from King\r\nAntigonus. It consisted of the village of Tobalmura in the Sardian\r\nplain and its appurtenances, the villages of Tandu and Combdilipia. On\r\nthese he had to pay annual dues of £50 to the proper chiliarchy, or\r\nsubdivision of the satrapy. Near by, in Cinara was a _kleros_, or lot,\r\non which he paid £3 yearly. The fief consisted, in addition, of the\r\nvillage of Periasasostra, of which the annual dues, payable to another\r\nchiliarchy, were £57. Close by, in Nagrioa was again a _kleros_, on\r\nwhich he paid £3 7_s._ yearly. The fief consisted, moreover, of the\r\nvillage of Ilu in the territory of the well-known city of Attuda, of\r\nwhich the dues, paid annually to the city of course, were £3 5_s._\r\nThe manor (_aule_) of the fief was in the village of Tobalmura, and\r\ntogether with certain lodges held by bailiffs and certain gardens and\r\nparks tilled by manorial serfs in Tobalmura and Periasasostra, it had\r\nonce been assigned to Pytheus and Adrastus, likewise Macedonians; but\r\nlater on it had seemingly come into the possession of Mnesimachus. The\r\nhappy holder of this great estate enjoyed, doubtless, the total net\r\nyield of the manor and the lots, and, in addition, as the possessor of\r\nthe manor and lots, rights to exact services in money, kind, and labor\r\nfrom the villeins of the villages. Had he been so minded he might have\r\nsettled down in Lydia and become a baron like the Iranian nobles whom\r\nthe Macedonians dispossessed; and, doubtless, many Macedonians and\r\nGreeks established themselves in Asia in this fashion. Mnesimachus,\r\nhowever, wanted money rather than \"rights\"; and, turning to the temple\r\nof Artemis in Sardis, he secured a loan of £1325 from the temple\r\ntreasurers. The inscription cut on the temple wall records the sale to\r\nArtemis, with right to repurchase, of Mnesimachus's interest in the\r\nfief. His inability to repay his loan resulted in the aggrandizement of\r\nthe temple.\r\n\r\nIncidents of this sort were, doubtless, of frequent occurrence and show\r\nwhat the Seleucids had to guard against. Their land policy seems to\r\nhave been prudent and far-sighted. They were bound to deal cautiously\r\nwith their gigantic domain, since from it came the most valuable and\r\nstable portion of their revenues. On the other hand, they found a\r\nlimit set to the quantity which they could profitably retain by the\r\nfact that, unlike the Ptolemies, they inherited from the Persians a\r\npublic service adequate, not to administer, but simply to supervise\r\nadministration. They did indeed increase the number of their satrapies,\r\nwithout, perhaps, diminishing the number of chiliarchies or hyparchies\r\ninto which each satrapy was divided, and they seem to have paralleled\r\nthe general service by a distinct fiscal service and by a distinct\r\npriestly service; but, none the less, they had to leave the details of\r\nfiscal, judicial, and religious administration to the villages. Though\r\nwe are singularly ill-informed as to how they organized the villages,\r\nit is conceivable that they picked out certain persons, like the elders\r\nin the Egyptian villages, and held them responsible for the taxes of\r\nthe villagers and for their general good behavior. These men would be\r\nrather hostages than officials, and would be nominees of the central\r\ngovernment rather than of the villages. But we really know nothing of\r\nthe facts, except that the villagers had some means by which they paid\r\ntheir taxes collectively.\r\n\r\nOne way by which the Seleucids could relieve themselves of the troubles\r\nof local administration and at the same time strengthen their hold\r\nupon the country was to make grants of whole blocks or complexes of\r\ntheir land, villages and villagers and all, to Macedonian and Greek\r\nfeudatories, like Mnesimachus, who of course became responsible for\r\nthe dues owing to the crown. But the evils of this system had been\r\ndiscovered by the Persian kings when they found their vassals more\r\nunruly than the villages. Hence the Seleucids refused to give a clear\r\ntitle to those to whom they made grants of portions of the royal\r\ndomain, and in the case of Mnesimachus the temple of Artemis, to which\r\nhe sold his rights, had to secure itself in the contract against the\r\nloss which it might sustain should the king recall his grant. On the\r\nother hand, when the king sold outright parts of the domain, as he\r\nfrequently did, particularly in times of financial distress, and the\r\nlands and villages sold became with their peasants private property, he\r\nrequired that they should be added to the territory of some city-state,\r\nit being a privilege highly cherished by the purchasers that they\r\nshould be given the liberty of deciding to which city their property\r\nshould belong. The Seleucid policy that land should belong either to a\r\ncity-state or to the crown was admirably calculated to destroy priestly\r\nand feudal sovereignties, and it was taken over by the Roman emperors,\r\ninto whose patrimony in Asia Minor passed many temple lands which had\r\neither escaped secularization under their predecessors or had been\r\nregained by the priests during the later, weaker days of the Seleucid\r\ndynasty.[113]\r\n\r\nBy a similar sale, or by a gift outright, the colonists who formed\r\na new city, or the old inhabitants of a village on being constituted\r\ncitizens of a free town, obtained full ownership of the lots of land\r\nassigned to them. The citizens, in turn, had authority, subject of\r\ncourse to the city's laws and the constitutions of the realm, over\r\nthe serfs when there happened to be any on their holdings. In this\r\nway the king lost control of his peasants and his property; for the\r\nfoundation was not merely a new city, but at the same time a new state.\r\nIts sovereign was not, or not simply, the king: it was the body of its\r\nfranchised inhabitants assembled in general assembly, and it proceeded\r\nto manage its public affairs by means of discussion and resolutions, by\r\ndelegating functions to a council and magistrates, and by determining\r\nits own domestic and foreign policies. The language of public life was\r\nof course Greek. The code of public and private law was, doubtless,\r\ndrafted according to Hellenic models. Gymnasia appeared and with them\r\ngymnastic and musical contests--the most characteristic marks of Greek\r\neducation. The deities they honored were those whom they themselves\r\nchose: they chose native gods and goddesses as well as Greek; above all\r\nthey chose as their chief city-god the living emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Seleucid empire was a state without a citizenship. If an Athenian\r\nsettled in it, he remained an Athenian, even if he became a satrap,\r\nunless he were given citizen rights in some one of the free cities.\r\nIn other words, the empire had as many different citizenships as\r\nthere were different cities, and as many distinct states as there were\r\ndistinct citizenships.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, each city could adopt whatever policy it pleased in the\r\nmatter of admitting foreigners, be they Greeks or Asiatics, newcomers\r\nor natives, to its body politic. It might prohibit the intermarriage\r\nof citizens with non-citizens altogether, or it might go so far as\r\nto open its doors to bastards. It is, therefore, impossible for us,\r\nwithout such sources of knowledge as the papyri afford for Egypt,\r\nto speak in any general way of the extent and effects of racial\r\nfusion in the Seleucid empire. Two things, however, seem clear: (1)\r\nIntermarriage between citizens of different cities was of frequent\r\noccurrence and, doubtless, of full legal propriety; (2) the great mass\r\nof the agricultural population was not much affected racially by the\r\nproximity of Greeks, Macedonians, Jews, or Iranians. The peasants were\r\npractically serfs. Their social inferiority protected them against\r\nassimilation by citizens. On the other hand, they were, doubtless,\r\nmuch more deeply stirred by the European immigration than were the\r\nfellahs in Egypt; for the influx into their land was much more abundant\r\nand more spontaneous than was that into the valley of the Nile. Here,\r\ntoo, Hellenism had much more effective agents for its diffusion than\r\nit had there. For within the hundreds of city-states in Asia we must\r\npresume that intermarriage was permitted among all citizens, whether\r\nthe elements which mingled with the Greeks were Phrygians, Lydians,\r\nSyrians, Jews, Babylonians, or Iranians. We must presume that at least\r\nthe men knew in a fashion the Greek language. They certainly tended\r\nto take Greek names, and in documents of Delos dating from the second\r\ncentury B.C. we meet with natives of Bambyce--now a _polis_ and renamed\r\nHierapolis, or the Sacred City--who would be indistinguishable from\r\nnative-born Greeks were it not for the Semitic names of their wives.\r\nIndeed, some of them may have been Greeks who had married Syrian women.\r\nThe various circles of Europeans in Syria, and, though to a less\r\ndegree, elsewhere in Asia, must have been surrounded at an early date\r\nby a penumbra of half-breeds, by means of which the sharp contrast of\r\nantagonistic civilizations was lessened. In these circumstances Greek\r\nideas and customs became a ferment which stirred the peoples of Asia\r\nto the depths. The awakening of the Nearer East was in progress in\r\nthe third century B.C., and had the Romans succumbed to Hannibal and\r\nthe Greeks maintained their prestige unimpaired for a century or two\r\nlonger, the whole course of history would have been changed.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks came to Asia \"not to send peace but a sword.\" They came\r\nto fill the continent up with cantankerous little republics where\r\nformerly a dense multitude had lived in a state of political lethargy.\r\nAnd curiously enough those who directed the dismemberment of Asia into\r\nfar more states than even mediæval Germany produced were the rulers\r\nwho had the responsibility for the government of the whole region. How\r\nexplain this anomaly?\r\n\r\nThe anomaly is more apparent than real. The ruler was not simply\r\nthe great landed proprietor of the cities' neighborhood; he was the\r\nfounder, or the descendant of the heroized founder, of most of them;\r\nhe was the \"benefactor\" or the \"preserver\" of them all. As such he was\r\ndeserving of their homage and entitled to their obedience. This they\r\ncould proffer in an unobjectionable manner once Alexander had shown\r\nthem the way. They had simply to make their proskynesis; to elect him\r\nto membership in their circle of deities, furnish him with a sacred\r\nprecinct, temple, altar, image, procession, and contest, and designate\r\na priest to attend to the sacrifices and other matters pertaining to\r\nhis worship. This they did of their own volition during the reign of\r\nthe founder of the dynasty. Apotheosis without territorial limitations\r\nAntiochus I demanded for Seleucus \"after his departure from the life\r\namong men,\" and the second Antiochus demanded it for himself and his\r\nsister-wife during their lifetime as well as for their \"departed\"\r\nfather; so that just as in Egypt and for the same reasons an imperial\r\ncult of the rulers dead and living was established throughout not only\r\nthe satrapies and hyparchies but also the cities of the realm.[114]\r\n\r\nThe city had, accordingly, a dual character: it was at once both in\r\ntheory and fact a nation and a municipality. In the former capacity it\r\ncould grant or withhold allegiance to the king; in the latter it had\r\nsimply to obey. It had for example to pay tribute to him (_phoros_ or\r\n_syntaxis_), which might be viewed as a rent for the land assigned to\r\nit, or as the price paid for military protection. It might have not\r\nsimply a priest of the king and a priestess of the queen, but also a\r\nresident (_epistates_), who on occasion might also be _phrurarch_, or\r\ncommandant, of the royal garrison when it had one. The double status\r\nof the city is further evidenced by the fact that its citizens were\r\nsubject not only to the laws which they themselves passed but also\r\nto the mandates (_prostagmata_) which the king issued. In cases of\r\nconflict there could be no doubt which was superior. The king was in\r\ntheory absolute as a god was absolute. He had, of course, citizenship\r\nin no state, but was simply _basileus_, or king. This title, attached\r\nto the name without an _ethnicum_, was the only one that the early\r\nSeleucids used; but the later members of the dynasty, beginning\r\nwith Antiochus IV, added to it the title, such as Epiphanes, or God\r\nManifest, by which their peculiar office as gods was indicated.\r\nThereafter, on their coins and edicts the two titles appeared, and\r\nthe monarchs were thereby classified in the two worlds to which they\r\nbelonged--that of men and that of gods--as completely as were citizens\r\nwhen to their names were added the adjectival forms of their city's\r\nname. In either capacity they were superior to the cities. On the other\r\nhand, the Seleucid god-kings had to consider carefully the demands of\r\ntheir cities, since these, having the means to organize resistance,\r\ncould easily revolt. When they did not get satisfaction they might\r\nchoose some other god-king instead, as the cities in Parthia and\r\nBactria actually did; or they might secure immunity from tribute, as\r\ndid the cities in Asia Minor in the reign of Antiochus I. Room was,\r\naccordingly, left for a large measure of municipal liberty; and, in\r\ngeneral, the activities of the citizens were numerous and important.\r\nThey had to attend to the maintenance of order, the administration of\r\njustice, and the collection of taxes within their several territories.\r\nHence the cities gave a stimulus to political interest and ambition\r\nsuch as Asia had never known before. They occupied, in fact, a place in\r\nthe Seleucid empire quite as important as that of the municipalities in\r\nthe early Roman empire, of which they were, indeed, the prototypes.\r\n\r\nThe Roman empire, however, had not yet come into existence. It was the\r\nItalian federation under Rome's leadership which defeated Hannibal\r\nand won the battles of Thermopylæ and Magnesia. When compared with\r\nthis aggregate of incorporated and allied states, the Seleucid empire\r\ndemonstrated fatal weaknesses. Rome had, perhaps, not many more\r\ncitizens on her army list than there were males of military age in the\r\nfranchised population of the Seleucid cities; and her public land,\r\nwhich, too, was her chief source of revenue, was far inferior in\r\nextent and yield to the royal domain of the Seleucids. Her advantages\r\nwere twofold and their enumeration will help us to understand the\r\ndisabilities under which the Asiatic monarchy labored. First, apart\r\nfrom the soldiers on Rome's army list there were few males of military\r\nage in Italy; in other words, there was no vast native population to\r\nhold in subjection. Second, Rome could mobilize her forces much more\r\neasily, quickly, and completely than could the Seleucids. The great\r\ndistances, often of mountain and desert, which separated the cities of\r\nAsia from one another; the considerable trading, industrial, Asiatic,\r\nand otherwise unwarlike, element in the free population of the Hellenic\r\nand Hellenized cities; and the independence of the cities, particularly\r\nin the matter of giving or refusing military aid to their suzerain, had\r\nno parallel in Italy, where the territory was compact, the population\r\nmainly a warlike peasantry, and the cities all bound to provide troops\r\nat the call of Rome to the full extent of their power. Like the giant\r\nAntæus in his trial of strength with Heracles, Rome with every fall\r\nrenewed her might from contact with her native soil. The Seleucids\r\nruled over a cosmopolitan, denationalized world. They had no native\r\nsoil on which to fall. It is of profound significance that there were\r\nand could be no fellow-citizens of Seleucus in all Asia. The loyalty\r\nof true men in his realm was due first of all to their cities, and it\r\nwas only by the lapse of time that a secondary loyalty to the ruling\r\ndynasty ceased to imply treason to their native states. The cities\r\nstood always before the decision whether in any given case they had\r\nmore to gain or to lose by abandoning the Seleucid and transferring\r\ntheir allegiance to his enemy or to some other king.\r\n\r\nIt was the tragedy of Antiochus IV that through an education in Italy\r\nhe came to realize fully the political grounds for the military\r\nsuperiority of Rome, and that through a sentimental attachment for\r\nAthens and the art, letters, and philosophy for which Athens stood,\r\nhe renewed his conviction as to the absolute superiority of Greek\r\nculture.[115] He attempted to push more vigorously than ever the\r\ndynastic policy of Hellenization, by which alone a new nation could be\r\nbred in Asia, at a time when native hopes were revived; and he tried\r\nto draw the city-states of his realm into more complete dependence\r\nupon himself by the only means available to him--the right which\r\nhe possessed as one of their gods to unhesitating obedience in all\r\nmatters--at the very time when this policy came into collision with a\r\nreligion to which deification of kings was an abomination. For in 200\r\nB.C. Palestine had passed from the control of Egypt into the control\r\nof Antiochus the Great, whereupon his dynasty had to deal with the\r\nJews. The trouble was, of course, that the Jews were monotheists. Many\r\nJews in Jerusalem, as well as in the other cities of the realm, were\r\nnot averse to Hellenism, and frequented the gymnasia, enrolled their\r\nsons in the ephebe corps, and gave them Greek names, but the devout\r\nshrank with horror from worshiping the emperor, and the peasants from\r\neverything foreign. Accordingly an open revolt occurred in Judæa,\r\nchiefly among the country people, when Antiochus IV chartered Jerusalem\r\nas a Hellenized city, substituted for the bizarre law of Moses an\r\nenlightened, up-to-date, Greek code, and set down his own image as the\r\nOlympian Zeus in the Holy of Holies.\r\n\r\nThis is the same Antiochus who twice led his victorious army to the\r\nwalls of Alexandria, once to retreat after dictating terms to the\r\nPtolemies, once to meet a Roman embassy headed by his old friend Gaius\r\nPopillius. Before answering the king's pleasant greeting, the Roman\r\nhanded to him the message of his Senate and curtly bade him read it.\r\nHe found it to be an order to evacuate Egypt immediately. On asking\r\nfor time to consider the proposal, he got a further surprise; for,\r\ndrawing a circle round the king in the sand with his cane, Popillius\r\ndemanded an answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" before he stepped outside of it. A\r\nfew months earlier, by crushing Perseus of Macedon on the battle-field\r\nof Pydna (168 B.C.), Rome had rid itself of its last serious rival.\r\nSince for Antiochus to resist meant now to stand alone against the\r\nmaster of the world, the only answer he could give was \"Yes\"; yet it\r\nmeant the ruin of the Seleucid empire. Thereafter, there was but one\r\nfree will in the vast territory of Africa, Asia, and Europe which lay\r\nbetween the Euphrates River and the Atlantic Ocean--the will of the\r\ngovernment of Rome. Instruments to give it continuous effect in Italy\r\nthat sagacious and persistent corporation, the Roman Senate, had made\r\nand used already; and in its march to universal empire it had broken\r\nand hurled to the ground the instruments of authority raised against it\r\nby its Greek adversaries. To pick them up, mend them, and improve them\r\nfor further use was the imperial task of the immediate future.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n 1.

We say\r\n\"Macedon and Greece\": the kings of Macedon from Philip II to Perseus\r\nsaid \"Hellas\"; for they never ceased to claim that Macedon was a part\r\nof Hellas--_the_ part of Hellas which had earned by the achievements\r\nof Philip II and Alexander the right of hegemony for its kings. It\r\nwas an imperial nation for which its king, nobles, and commons had\r\nan intense loyalty and pride, but which stood in their thinking to\r\nHellas as Virginia did to the United States in the _ante-bellum_ days,\r\nor as Prussia does to Germany, rather than as Austria does to the\r\nAustro-Hungarian empire.\r\n\r\nIt taught the Romans least because it had least to teach them. The one\r\nthing in which the Macedonians were masterful was the art of war; yet\r\nin this the Romans by native accomplishment were their superiors. They\r\ninvented the phalanx, but the phalanx succumbed to the legion. In the\r\nart of government the Antigonids were resourceful, but to lift up a\r\njellyfish on a spear-point is an impossible task. Yet that is what they\r\nhad to do in Hellas. The only lessons of government they could teach\r\nwere lessons of failure; but that this is not to their discredit is\r\nshown by the inability of Rome itself to cope with the same situation\r\ntill Hellas was dead and desiccated. They were sagacious enough to\r\nrealize that for a people with the customs, piety, and bluntness of the\r\nMacedonians a kingship was best which, to speak with Aristotle, was\r\na perpetual magistracy and not an absolute monarchy. Hence they were\r\nunder no necessity to demand that the Macedonians worship them as gods,\r\nand the Macedonians, having inherited rights which no Antigonid dared\r\nto ignore,[116] were under no legal necessity to thrust divinity upon\r\ntheir rulers. Hence the Antigonids alone of the Hellenistic dynasties\r\ngoverned as men supported by their people's loyalty, and not as gods to\r\nwhom all things were permitted. They, moreover, organized no official\r\ncult of their family in Hellas, for reasons which will appear later. It\r\nwas not Macedon but Greece which took the proud Roman victor captive\r\nand bore the arts to rustic Latium. For the Macedonians remained\r\nthemselves a rustic people, and added little or nothing to the poetry,\r\npainting, sculpture, architecture, and science of Hellas.[117] Their\r\nélite were rulers and officers, their commons farmers and soldiers.\r\nFrom the time Philip II came to the throne (359 B.C.) to the battle of\r\nCynocephalæ (197 B.C.), it is impossible to find a decade, and not\r\neasy to find half a one, during which the able-bodied men of Macedon\r\nwere not called to the standards at least once either to defend their\r\ncountry against foreign attack or to march north, south, east, or west\r\nagainst their lord's enemies.[118] Their dead were to be found in\r\nevery valley of Hellas, and their emigrants in every land of Asia; but\r\ntheirs was a prolific race, so that, despite their many losses in the\r\ninterval, they put 29,000 Macedonians in the field in the last struggle\r\nwith Rome, or 2000 more than stood under the command of Alexander the\r\nGreat when he had completed his arrangements for the conquest of Asia.\r\n\r\nRome suffered more from the Antigonids than from any other Hellenistic\r\ndynasty because it had there alone to do with a nation of veterans\r\nunder arms. The Macedonians were, as has been said, an imperial people,\r\nloyal to their kings, and ambitious to maintain their ascendancy in\r\nthe world. While at war with Rome--the wielder of armies 100,000\r\nstrong--they were assailed simultaneously by their Hellenic vassals\r\nand rivals and attacked or abandoned by their Macedonian kinsmen\r\nin Asia and Africa; yet they held out under the Antigonids, in the\r\nfirst struggle for eight years (212-205 B.C.), in the second for four\r\n(200-197 B.C.), in the third for still another four (171-168 B.C.); and\r\neven after one half of their men of military age had fallen at Pydna,\r\nand their last king had died in captivity and his only son as a clerk\r\nat Alba Fucens, their conquerors were so seriously disturbed by the\r\n\"throbbings of their ancient loyalty\" that the Senate had finally to\r\nplace a Roman proconsul on the throne of the great Alexander (148 B.C.).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough sprung from a Macedonian stock, the dynasty of the Antigonids\r\nwas bred in Asia, and it was transplanted into Macedon only in its\r\nthird generation. That came about in the following way. The first\r\nAntigonus was made ruler of Phrygia when Alexander the Great left Asia\r\nMinor in 333 B.C., and he was still in possession of that satrapy when\r\nhis sovereign died ten years later. With Phrygia as a starting point\r\nand a nomination as commander-in-chief of the royal forces in Asia as\r\na pretext, he planned and fought with such success in the next decade\r\nthat in the spring of 312 B.C. he seemed destined to add Macedon to\r\nAsia, which he already possessed; and with it to support and not to\r\noppose him, he counted on being able to master the whole of Alexander's\r\nempire. We have already seen why this project failed, and also how a\r\nlater attempt to accomplish the same purpose cost him his life and his\r\nAsiatic realm. He may have been over-ambitious. Possibly no one could\r\nhave prevented the dismemberment of the Græco-Macedonian world. Perhaps\r\nthe centrifugal tendencies would have proved too strong for Alexander\r\nhimself had he lived long enough to test them. That, however, does\r\nnot make the issue less of a calamity for the Hellenes; for on the\r\nbattle-fields of Gaza and Ipsus it was decided that the alien Romans\r\nand not the kindred Macedonians were to unite the world under a single\r\ngovernment. With the person of the first Antigonus went to the grave\r\nthe hope of a great people.\r\n\r\nThe sharer of his aspirations and the cause in considerable measure\r\nof his defeat was his son Demetrius, surnamed Poliorcetes, or\r\n\"Taker-of-Cities.\" By his disobedience to orders at Gaza and his\r\nimpetuosity in action at Ipsus, he had done most to lose his kingdom;\r\nbut after the death of his father he still retained the dominion of\r\nthe sea, and, with it, value as an ally and ability to use his forces\r\nat such points as he himself chose. After some years of aimless\r\nadventuring and galling inactivity he chose to use them in the attempt,\r\ntwice vainly made already in coöperation with his father, to seize\r\nGreece and Macedon. His strength was incomparably inferior to that\r\nused on the earlier occasions and he had still watchful enemies on\r\nall sides. The essential difference was that the house of Antipater,\r\nwhich had ruled Macedon and Greece since Alexander the Great had\r\ncrossed into Asia, was now represented, not by Antipater's able son,\r\nCassander, who died in 297 B.C. after a reign of nineteen years, but\r\nby his weakly and dissentious children. These looked on inactive while\r\nhe blockaded Athens (295-294 B.C.) and starved it into submission;\r\nwhereupon he brushed them aside and took their place as king of\r\nMacedon and suzerain of Greece. Since his wife was Phila, Cassander's\r\nsister, his son, Antigonus, surnamed Gonatas, was a grandson of\r\nAntipater I, no less than Antipater II, who was now the sole survivor\r\nof Cassander's family. Hence, if the right of Demetrius Poliorcetes to\r\nthe Macedonian throne rested upon nothing more substantial than the\r\nfrustrated ambition of his father, the right of his son was flawless\r\nafter the death of Antipater II. This, however, occurred in 288-287\r\nB.C. at the very time when Demetrius, on being expelled from Macedon,\r\nabandoned Greece and went to meet captivity in Asia for the rest of his\r\nlife. Left behind in Greece, Antigonus Gonatas exercised a watchful\r\nsuzerainty there without being king of Macedon, which Pyrrhus of\r\nEpirus and Lysimachus of Thrace shared for a few years (288 to 284-283\r\nB.C.), Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy Ceraunus held alone in rapid\r\nsuccession for another interval (283-280 B.C.), and Celts from the\r\nnorth plundered and harried for three years. It was not till 277 B.C.\r\nthat Antigonus succeeded in freeing it from its troubles and making it\r\nthe base of his operations in Greece. He therewith planted in Europe\r\nthe dynasty which ruled Macedon till the Roman conquest (168 B.C.).\r\n\r\nAntigonus I and Demetrius Poliorcetes had formed their political\r\nambitions and ideas during the age of the _diadochi_, when the empire\r\nof Alexander stood in all its magnificence and promise as a golden\r\nprize for the able, courageous, and unscrupulous. They had aspired to\r\nrule as god-kings over a world in which men and cities rendered homage\r\n(proskynesis) to them, as they had rendered it to Alexander. They had\r\nviewed Greece and Macedon as alike desirable,[119] the common charm\r\nbeing that they were the mother of the soldiers and settlers of whom\r\ntheir limitless realm had need. They may have coveted Greece even more\r\nthan Macedon. Certainly, Athens, not Pella, was the city of Demetrius's\r\ndreams. He had gloried in being its liberator in 307 B.C., and when\r\nit dashed his hopes by excluding him after his defeat at Ipsus, he\r\nhad suffered bitter disappointment. None the less, and despite the\r\ndesperate resistance which it had offered to him in 295-294 B.C., he\r\ntreated it with clemency when he was once again its master. What his\r\nfather had thought of the approval of Athens he expressed by calling it\r\nthe beacon tower of the world. How highly he had esteemed the culture\r\nof its inhabitants he demonstrated by making a colony of Athenians\r\nthe nucleus of Antigonia (later Antioch), which he founded as the new\r\ncapital of the empire that had been Alexander's, but was now, he hoped,\r\nto be his.\r\n\r\nAntigonus I had never had the good fortune to rule in the land of his\r\nbirth, but Demetrius Poliorcetes was its king for six years (294-288\r\nB.C.).[120] As such he showed conclusively that he had no intention\r\nto reign there patriarchally, as Cassander and Antipater, following\r\nthe example of Philip II and his predecessors, had done. He displayed\r\nan utter disregard for the established customs of the court and for\r\nthe limitations imposed by usage upon his royal authority. The court\r\nhe surrounded himself with was the richly appointed, ceremonious,\r\nuniformed affair devised by Alexander in his later, more splendid, more\r\narrogant days; and by requiring proskynesis of the Macedonian noblemen\r\nand commons, he offended, unnecessarily, as it proved, the sturdiest\r\nsentiment of the nation.[121] His attempt to establish absolute\r\nmonarchy in unsophisticated Macedon was the most direct cause of the\r\nloss of his kingdom; for when his foreign enemies, anticipating the\r\nattack which he designed against them, assailed him from all sides, his\r\nsubjects hastened to abandon him and joined hands with the invaders.\r\nThey had no longer heart for the wild imperialistic projects into\r\nwhich, almost without perceiving it, they had been led by Alexander the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAntigonus Gonatas had never known the lure of the East. He had spent\r\nhis early manhood in Athens (294-290 B.C.), where an unworthy liaison\r\nwith the courtesan Demo and an intimacy that does him honor with Zeno,\r\nthe founder of the Stoa, attest the range of his activity. He won his\r\nspurs in his father's Boeotian campaigns of 292-291 B.C., and spent\r\nthe formative years of his career as a general and statesman in Greece\r\n(288-280 B.C.). Only once, when hard pushed in 280B.C., did he show\r\nthat the blood of Demetrius Poliorcetes and Antigonus I flowed in his\r\nveins, namely, when he tried to seize Asia Minor, then temporarily\r\nwithout a master. Normally, he acted like the child of Phila and the\r\nheir of the policy of Cassander and Antipater. And it was in the spirit\r\nof his mother's line that he established his government in Macedon on\r\nexpelling the Celts in 277 B.C.\r\n\r\nHis reign opened auspiciously. Having obtained--how, when, and at what\r\nprice, we do not know--the friendship of Egypt, he got the opportunity\r\nto order affairs to his liking in Greece. On the other hand, his\r\naccession to the throne was accompanied by his marriage to Phila, his\r\nown niece, the sister of Antiochus I, the new king of Asia. This union\r\nsanctioned an agreement by which Antigonus abandoned his claim to Asia\r\nMinor and Antiochus his right, as Seleucus's son, to the Macedonian\r\nthrone. It inaugurated a policy by which Macedon secured for eighty\r\nyears (277-197 B.C.) immunity from attack or intrigue on the part of\r\nthe Seleucids. His friendship with Egypt was less enduring, but it\r\ngave him ten years (277-267 B.C.) in which to consolidate his power--a\r\nperiod of quiet activity, interrupted only by the return of Pyrrhus\r\nfrom Italy and the startling upheaval in Macedon and Greece (274-272\r\nB.C.) which accompanied that adventurous monarch's vigorous assertion\r\nof his right to rule those countries. The fall of Pyrrhus in battle at\r\nArgos relieved the tension of this situation, but till the time of his\r\ndeath thirty-two years afterwards, Antigonus had always to count Epirus\r\namong his possible enemies when it was not actually his assailant.\r\nOn his northern frontier he faced the threatening Dardanians, and on\r\nthe northeastern the marauding Celts, who had reduced Thrace to the\r\ncondition of barbarity that prevailed throughout Central Europe. By\r\nkeeping these peoples in check he did a great service to Greece, which\r\nhe thereby protected; but for it he got little gratitude, and it was\r\nhis suzerainty over Greece which brought to him and his successors most\r\nof their many troubles.\r\n\r\nJust as he was faithful to the traditional policy of the Macedonian\r\nkings in his dealings with his own people, so, too, in regard to the\r\nGreeks the plan he followed was in general the old-fashioned one,\r\nof making them his dependent allies. In states ostensibly free and\r\nself-governing he secured a preponderating influence by designating an\r\nindividual as his representative and making him practically governor.\r\nNaturally, the domestic opponents of such a person called him a tyrant,\r\nand such, in fact, the nature of his position forced him to become,\r\nsince he could not hold his place without breaking both the public and\r\nprivate laws. But outward appearances were preserved, even when he\r\ncalled in Macedonian troops to his aid, by the old practice whereby he\r\nand his adherents assumed the responsibility for their coming.\r\n\r\nAntigonus Gonatas and some at least of his governors were pupils of\r\nZeno. That meant in this connection that, whereas Alexander the Great,\r\nfor example, had been obliged to discard what was most characteristic\r\nin the politics of Aristotle when he identified himself with the man\r\nof transcendent virtue, who, his teacher had urged, should be made\r\nabsolute monarch when found, Antigonus drew from his philosophy an\r\nobligation to let none but the sage rule.[122] As against the wisdom\r\nof the ideal wise man the laws of states which he ignored or broke had\r\nno avail; for, according to his creed, they were unnatural and hence\r\nunwholesome. The wise man could do no wrong. In his actions, since\r\nhe was a law unto himself, morality triumphed over mere legality.\r\nAntigonus Gonatas disdained to seek a justification for his acts by\r\nclaiming, though a man, the prerogatives of the gods, and, though\r\nthere was nothing in the pantheistic theory of Stoicism to prevent\r\nhis being worshiped if people wanted to worship him, he was under no\r\nlegal necessity to pose as a god; whereas, had he done so, he must have\r\ncome into conflict with the religious conservatism of his philosophy.\r\nHe, accordingly, had no difficulty in rendering an account to his own\r\nconscience for setting up \"tyrants\" in his Greek dependencies and for\r\npracticing or authorizing lawlessness. But he was too shrewd a man\r\nto suppose that because Zeno and he thought his conduct justified he\r\ncould do what he pleased to the Macedonians or Greeks with impunity.\r\nThey could not be expected to know that their ruler was a Stoic sage\r\nwho could do no wrong, or to make allowances for his behavior on that\r\naccount. Hence, while he could justify his system of government on\r\nphilosophic grounds, there is no evidence that he was not a scrupulous\r\nMacedonian king and a considerate suzerain of Greece. And had he been\r\nleft alone to work out the problem of Hellenic administration without\r\noutside interference it is probable that his high sense of duty and his\r\nskill and forbearance would have given Greece a long period of peace.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the first Macedonian empire, Philip II, had been opposed\r\nin Greece by Persia, but the resistance he had encountered because of\r\nthe diplomacy of Artaxerxes Ochus was as nothing when compared with\r\nthe difficulties raised up for Antigonus Gonatas's uncle, Cassander,\r\nby the promises and armies of his grandfather, Antigonus I, or with\r\nthe obstacles he himself had to meet in the intrigue, money, and\r\nexpeditions of Ptolemy Philadelphus.\r\n\r\nThe situation which existed in the first ten years of his reign\r\n(277-267 B.C.) was not of Antigonus's creating, nor was Philadelphus\r\nresponsible for it. It was Ptolemy I Soter who had seized the dominion\r\nof the sea on the final _débâcle_ of Demetrius Poliorcetes (287-286\r\nB.C.) and with it the control of the league of the Islanders. This\r\nestablished a long and, in fact, indefinable frontier between the\r\nrealm of Philadelphus and that of Antigonus. The lordship of the sea\r\nGonatas seems not to have bothered about at first, and, indeed, the\r\ngreat war which broke out in 266-265 B.C. between the two monarchs--the\r\nso-called Chremonidean War--was clearly incited by Egypt and not by\r\nhim. Notwithstanding that she was dead four years when the actual\r\nconflict began, its real instigator was, doubtless, Arsinoë, the\r\nsister-queen of Philadelphus. Acting on her policy, Philadelphus first\r\nformed an alliance with King Areus I of Sparta and his allies (Achæa,\r\nElis, Mantinea, Phlius, and part of Crete) and with Athens, and then\r\nbacked them up in the concerted effort they decided to make to free\r\nGreece from Antigonus and his \"tyrants.\" What the real object of the\r\n\"brother-gods\" was, is a matter of conjecture. All they accomplished,\r\nin any case, was to give Antigonus five years of hard fighting[123] and\r\nto complete the ruin of Athens and the enforced quietude of Sparta.\r\n\r\nTherewith was accomplished, what had been long in the preparing, the\r\noverthrow of the leadership which city-states had held from time\r\nimmemorial in European Greece. Henceforth it was not from cities\r\nthat significant movements sprang, but from ethne. Macedon itself was\r\nan ethnos, or, at least, a group of ethne, and it seemed possible to\r\nenlarge it by adding to it all the other ethne in the peninsula. The\r\ndifficulty was that two other ethne, Ætolia and Achæa, the first in\r\nCentral Greece and the second in the Peloponnesus, had each a similar,\r\nif less far-reaching, ambition; and while the aspirations of Ætolia to\r\nacquire territory in the Peloponnesus, and the aspirations of Achæa to\r\nexpand into Central Greece, kept them normally in conflict with one\r\nanother; and while each in turn (Ætolia in 245-241, Achæa in 220-217\r\nand 212-206 B.C.) got the help of Macedon against the other, and both\r\nunited only once (238-229 B.C.) in a war against Macedon, Achæa offered\r\ntill 224 B.C. and Ætolia till 200 B.C. an attractive alternative for\r\nMacedonian suzerainty to ethne and city-states which could not stand\r\nalone. The natural desire of the new ethne, as of the old city-states,\r\nwas, however, to be independent--a sentiment which Ætolia and Achæa\r\nshared completely; and against this powerful force Antigonus had to\r\ncontend, after the Chremonidean War no less than before it.\r\n\r\nHe had come so brilliantly out of the Chremonidean War, however, that\r\nten years elapsed before his suzerainty was again challenged. His most\r\nformidable enemy, Ptolemy Philadelphus, was absorbed meanwhile with a\r\ndangerous disturbance in Ionia, occasioned by the revolt of Ptolemy,\r\nhis \"son\", and Timarchus, his admiral, to whose aid his watchful enemy,\r\nAntiochus II, and his daring maritime rivals, the Rhodians,[124] had\r\ncome (258 B.C.); but when this outbreak was brought to a close with\r\nthe peace of 255 B.C.,[125] Antigonus had to anticipate a renewal of\r\nhis troubles in Greece. He, accordingly, determined to cease being\r\nthe anvil and to become the hammer. That meant the construction of a\r\nfleet with which to take from Egypt control of the Ægean, which had\r\nbeen possessed prior to 288-287 B.C. by his father and grandfather. To\r\naccomplish this end he renewed his alliance with Syria, and arranged\r\na marriage between his son and heir, Demetrius, and Stratonice,\r\nAntiochus's sister. This being done, he sought out the admirals of\r\nPtolemy at Leucolla near Cos, and defeated them in a great naval battle\r\n(253 B.C.). Suzerainty over the league of the Islanders was the most\r\nstriking gain; but a more substantial advantage was that with his fleet\r\nhe could now ward off trouble in Greece and stir it up in Ptolemy's\r\nrealm. The latter he accomplished by dispatching his half-brother,\r\nDemetrius the Fair, to Cyrene and by snatching that kingdom, which had\r\njust been vacated by the death of Magas (251-250 B.C.), from the grasp\r\nof Egypt. In the former he had a rather surprising lack of success.\r\nFor in 251 B.C. Aratus, the somewhat melodramatic hero of the Achæan\r\nleague, on mastering his native city Sicyon by a coup d'état, not only\r\nchose to accept a subsidy from Philadelphus rather than from himself,\r\nbut added Sicyon to the neighboring ethnos of the Achæans. And almost\r\nimmediately thereafter Ptolemy struck a second blow which made the\r\nfirst of importance. In 250 B.C. Alexander, Antigonus's nephew and\r\nchief lieutenant in Greece, egged on by Egypt doubtless, revolted and\r\nset himself up as an independent monarch, with Corinth and Calchis,\r\nwhich he had held for his uncle, and the Macedonian fleet of which\r\nthese were the naval stations, as his basis for action. He at once\r\nallied himself with the Achæans and forced Argos and Athens to pay\r\nhim tribute (before 250-249 B.C.). This rebellion paralyzed the naval\r\npower of Antigonus. It was doubtless precipitated by the disloyalty of\r\nAntiochus II to Macedon; for that monarch (now, in or before 249 B.C.)\r\nbroke faith with Antigonus and allied himself with Egypt, retaining\r\nthe conquests he had made during the war and receiving in marriage\r\nBerenice, the only daughter of Philadelphus, whose intrinsic worth was\r\naugmented by an enormous dowry. This base and, as it proved, foolish\r\naction freed Ptolemy to devote all his energies to the war with\r\nMacedon. The fleet of Egypt once more mastered the Ægean and regained\r\ncontrol of the league of the Islanders (249 B.C.). Simultaneously,\r\nthe pro-Egyptian party in Cyrene slew the fair Demetrius, and by the\r\nmarriage of their young queen Berenice to Philadelphus's heir, effected\r\nthe reunion of the two kingdoms, which had been estranged since the\r\nrevolt of Berenice's father, Magas, in 274 B.C.[126] The triumph of\r\nPtolemy was complete, and when his daughter promptly bore to her\r\nSeleucid husband a son, who by the marriage stipulation was to be his\r\nheir, the future of the Ptolemies seemed bright indeed.\r\n\r\nBetween 250 and 245 B.C. the fortunes of Gonatas were at a low ebb.\r\nHe evidently bent before the storm, unable to confront Alexander and\r\nAratus in Greece and the admirals of Philadelphus in the Ægean. Relief\r\ncame to him from an unexpected source--the renewal of the war between\r\nEgypt and Asia, when, on the death of Antiochus II, his sister-wife\r\nLaodice took up arms against the Egyptian queen and her babe on behalf\r\nof her son Seleucus Callinicus. For, helped by the untimely death of\r\nPhiladelphus, and despite the intervention of the Egyptian fleet, she\r\nsucceeded in compassing the death of her rivals;[127] whereupon the new\r\nPtolemy, Euergetes, took the field in person and made a general attack\r\nby land and sea upon her and her adherents. This tragic incident was\r\none of the few pieces of good luck experienced by Antigonus. Another\r\nwas the premature death of his nephew Alexander (246 B.C.), followed\r\nas it was by the Ætolian conquest of Boeotia, and the decision of\r\nNicæa, Alexander's widow, to surrender Corinth and the rest of her\r\nkingdom to Macedon, the arrangement being that she was to take the\r\nplace of the barren and discredited Stratonice as wife of the crown\r\nprince Demetrius. In 245-244 B.C. the balance in Asia inclined sharply\r\nin favor of Laodice, and at the same time Antigonus, aided by his\r\npatron god Pan, recovered Delos and the Islands. Having thus regained\r\nwhat the rebellion of Alexander had cost him, and having settled his\r\naccount with Egypt, Antigonus had now to deal with Aratus of Sicyon\r\nalone. The Achæan was too quick for him, however. By a night attack,\r\nin time of peace, he treacherously seized Corinth (243 B.C.), and at\r\nonce added it, together with Megara, Epidaurus, and Troezen, to the\r\nAchæan league. The response of Antigonus to this audacious coup was\r\nto form a pact with his old friends the Ætolians to divide Achæan\r\nterritory between them; whereupon, as the only escape from so great a\r\nperil, Aratus put the responsibility where the responsibility really\r\nbelonged, by having Ptolemy Euergetes elected general of the Achæan\r\nleague on land and sea for 242 B.C. Euergetes brought the Laodicean\r\nWar to a point where an advantageous peace was possible by a victory\r\nover Callinicus in this critical year; but his attempt to help\r\nAratus, who tried to \"liberate\" Athens while his \"commander\" engaged\r\nGonatas in the Ægean, was frustrated by the defeat sustained by his\r\nadmiral Sophron at the hands of the veteran Antigonus off the island\r\nof Andros. Macedon still held the Ægean. In the mean time its allies\r\nthe Ætolians, already dangerously strengthened by the occupation of\r\nBoeotia, had worsted Olympias, the queen regent of Epirus, in several\r\nengagements, and were on the point of incorporating all of Acarnania\r\nin their league. Antigonus thought the time had come to call a halt.\r\nEuergetes and Callinicus were of the same mind. Accordingly, the long\r\nwar was concluded in 242-241 B.C. by a general peace arranged on the\r\nbasis of _uti possidetis_. Antigonus held Argos, Hermione, Phlius,\r\nÆgina, Megalopolis, and Orchomenus in the Peloponnesus, in Central\r\nGreece Athens alone, and in the Ægean Euboea and the Cyclades, as well,\r\nseemingly, as Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, the colonies of Athens.\r\nThessaly was of course his. His garrisons stood in Demetrias, Chalcis,\r\nand Piræus. Of the \"shackles\" of Greece Corinth alone was out of his\r\nhands. In 240-239 B.C. he died at the age of eighty, having been a king\r\nforty-seven years, all but ten of them in Macedon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have sketched the career of Antigonus Gonatas in some fullness\r\nchiefly because it has only recently become possible to give anything\r\nlike chronological precision to an account of this remarkable\r\nman.[128] His reign deserves detailed consideration, however, because\r\nof the position it occupies at one of the culminating points of Greek\r\nimperialism, the only other point of equal importance being that in\r\nwhich Alexander the Great introduced deification of rulers. The record\r\ngiven above shows clearly, I think, that the power of Macedon did\r\nnot suffice to hold Greece in subjection on the principles followed\r\nby Antigonus Gonatas, and against the opposition of Egypt. Even the\r\nfinal triumph of 242-241 B.C. left Egyptian garrisons in Thrace, the\r\nHellespont, Ionia, and islands as far advanced into the Ægean as Thera\r\nand Astypalæa, Samos and Lesbos, Thasos and Samothrace. It left Achæa\r\nin possession of Corinth and Megara, Epidaurus and Troezen, as well as\r\nSicyon and at least a foothold in Arcadia. It left Ætolia in possession\r\nof part of Acarnania, Dolopia, Æniania, Malis, Doris, Locris, Phocis,\r\nand in close alliance with Boeotia. Heraclea at Thermopylæ and Delphi\r\nwith its Amphictyonic council were Ætolian. Hence when the new king\r\nof Macedon, Demetrius II, married Olympias's daughter Phthia, and\r\ntook Epirote Acarnania under his protection (240-239 B.C.); and when\r\nÆtolia, thus check-mated, entered into a defensive and offensive\r\nalliance with Achæa, the territory of the two leagues, now united in\r\nopposition to Macedon, met, and inclosed completely the Corinthian\r\nGulf. The one had grown strong despite Antigonus and the other with\r\nhis connivance. He had been forced to give Ætolia a free rein from\r\nneed of its aid against Egypt, Epirus, and Achæa. Now the policy of\r\nEpirus was subservient to that of Macedon as it had been prior to the\r\naccession of Pyrrhus to its throne in 295 B.C., but the two leagues\r\nwere able to fight on fair terms with the two monarchies, and in 238\r\nB.C. they defied Macedon, now supported by Epirus, without having Egypt\r\nas their ally. The failure of the Greek policy of Antigonus Gonatas may\r\nbe best gauged by the fact that twenty-seven years earlier Athens and\r\nSparta had dared to do the like, but only when Egypt, and probably also\r\nEpirus, were fighting on their side.\r\n\r\nThe chief reason for this striking difference is that in the interval\r\nthe Achæans, following the lead given to them by the Ætolians, had\r\ncome to life and shed their ethnic cocoon. They had long since been\r\na _koinon_, or league; but up to 251 B.C. their league, like that of\r\nBoeotia prior to 387 B.C., like that of the Ætolians prior to the\r\nseizure of Delphi in 292 B.C., had been confined strictly by the limits\r\nof their ethnos. The Ætolians had enlarged their territory under the\r\nægis of the Delphian Amphictyony. The Achæans had no such favoring\r\ncircumstance. In their case expansion by the incorporation of \"foreign\"\r\npeoples was the policy and achievement of a citizen of the first\r\n\"foreign\" city to be absorbed, Aratus of Sicyon, who saw a greater\r\nopportunity for power as the head of the neighboring league than as\r\nthe \"tyrant\" of his native state, holding office, like the priest at\r\nNemi, till murdered, or till he had lost the confidence of Antigonus.\r\nAt his instigation the Achæan league was carried into the territory\r\nof the \"foreigner,\" the necessary prerequisite for such a development\r\nbeing, however, that the ethnic bond between the Achæan cities had\r\nbeen canceled and replaced by a federal bond. The tenacious theory\r\nthat common citizenship presupposed community of descent was therewith\r\ndiscarded. Its abandonment opened to the league possibilities of growth\r\nnever possessed by either the city-state or the ethnic state. Of these\r\nthe Ætolians and the Achæans took advantage to the best of their\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nThey were wise enough, moreover, to perceive that not only were city\r\ninstitutions indispensable for an up-to-date polity--whence the\r\nÆtolians on forming their league in 322-314 B.C. abandoned their three\r\nancient tribes and their multitudinous villages and organized in their\r\nstead a score or two of cities[129]--but also that their federal system\r\nmust recognize and accept the preexistent city-states as its units.\r\nThis, as we have seen,[130] had not been done in Boeotia or in the\r\nHellenic league organized by Philip II, in each of which the federal\r\nsynod, being constructed on the idea of representation according to\r\npopulation, made districts and not cities the units; so that the\r\nsmaller cities felt themselves discriminated against and tended to\r\nrebel against being clubbed together. How far equality of cities\r\nprevailed among the Achæans it is impossible to say with certainty:\r\nwe are simply informed that the voting there was by cities. But we\r\nare, I think, permitted to infer that the principle followed was\r\n\"one city one vote.\" For it is unlikely that the old Achæan cities,\r\non admitting Sicyon, Corinth, Megalopolis, and Argos, deliberately\r\nexposed themselves to the fate of the little lake cities in Boeotia by\r\ngiving these large \"foreign\" cities voting power proportionate to their\r\npopulations. This conclusion holds, I believe, both for the Achæan\r\nrepresentative assembly, or synod, which was made up, seemingly, of\r\nsuccessive fractions of the citizens of the constituent cities,[131]\r\nand for the Achæan primary assembly, or _syncletus_, which was open\r\nto all citizens over thirty years of age. It holds, too, it seems,\r\nfor the two Ætolian assemblies, the ordinary and the extraordinary,\r\nwhich were both primary,[132] but not for the Ætolian council which\r\nwas constituted of delegates apportioned to the constituent cities\r\naccording to their size. The Achæan and the Ætolian leagues represent\r\nin this respect a reaction from the earlier leagues. Their hope was\r\nto change the stress of the cities, which came into play, from a\r\ncentrifugal into a centripetal force by basing their federations\r\nsquarely on the city-states.\r\n\r\nThis they could do, up to a certain point, the more easily because\r\neach ethnos had lacked a city-state of outstanding political and\r\neconomic power. Equality of city-states did not conflict flagrantly\r\nwith realities in either Achæa or Ætolia. Hence the principle that each\r\ncity-state, irrespective of strength in the Aristotelian sense, should\r\nhave a single vote in the federal assembly, and an equal voice in the\r\nchoosing of the federal cabinet (_demiurgi_; _apocleti_), and the\r\nfederal executive (_strategus_, hipparch, secretary of state, treasurer\r\nor treasurers) appeared equitable. In Boeotia and Hellas in the earlier\r\ntime the league had been created by the superior strength of Thebes\r\nand Macedon respectively; and these capital states had taken care that\r\nthe initial leadership should be preserved by the institutions of the\r\nleagues. The Achæan and the Ætolian leagues, on the other hand, were\r\npartly, no doubt, the result of a compromise between the constituent\r\nunits, but mainly the consequence of foreign pressure. The federal\r\nmovement was not based primarily upon the activity of any one city, but\r\nupon a need generally felt. Hence the capital of the Achæan league\r\nwas Ægium, and the capital of the Ætolian league Thermon--neutral\r\nmeeting-places, like Washington, Ottawa, and Canberra. That was\r\nsomething new in the annals of the Greek leagues.\r\n\r\nThe creative force of foreign policy is manifest in still other\r\ncharacteristics of these Hellenistic leagues. It was almost\r\ninevitable that in those days of executive efficiency states should\r\nbe monarchically organized. Hence, whereas there had been eleven\r\nBoeotarchs in the Boeotian league and seven generals in early\r\nthird-century Acarnania, a single general stood at the head of\r\nthe Ætolians from the founding of their league and at the head of\r\nthe Achæans after 255 B.C. That gave a unity of action otherwise\r\nimpossible, the lack of which, though negligible perhaps in domestic\r\naffairs, had been found disadvantageous in foreign affairs. It was a\r\nnecessary concession to a monarchical age, one which, however, had been\r\nmade reluctantly and with an important reservation which took from\r\nthe serum its malignancy: the generalship could be held by the same\r\nindividual only every alternate year. He might be the uncrowned king of\r\nthe league one year; the next he must be a private citizen.\r\n\r\nIn still another respect distrust of monarchy and aversion to the\r\n\"tyranny\" on which Antigonus Gonatas had based his Greek empire, are\r\nbetrayed in the institutions of the Achæans. The rule of a city by a\r\ntyrant and membership in the league were regarded as incompatible\r\nwith one another. This was, doubtless, a requirement of the federal\r\nlaws, which, consisting of treaties negotiated between the original\r\ncities in 275 B.C. and at the admission of new cities thereafter,\r\nof oaths by which these treaties were sanctioned, and of general\r\nenactments made from time to time by special legislative process,\r\nbound the citizens of the individual cities no less than did the local\r\nlaws which they themselves passed. Otherwise the city-states were at\r\nliberty to adopt whatever form of government they chose. The league\r\nchampioned neither democracy nor oligarchy, though its working favored\r\nthe well-to-do classes. At most it compelled a certain uniformity in\r\nlocal administration, its general attitude being admirably symbolized\r\nby its monetary arrangements, wherein the standard was determined by\r\nthe federal authority while the coins were issued by the constituent\r\ncities.[133]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe very constitutions of the Achæan and the Ætolian leagues disclose\r\nthe importance of the part which the Greek policy of Antigonus Gonatas\r\nplayed in the creation of these dangerous adversaries of himself and\r\nhis country. It is true that his son, Demetrius II, fought them to a\r\nstandstill, wrested from Ætolia a large part of its acquisitions, and\r\nmight have dissolved both leagues by force, had not Epirus deserted him\r\nand gone over to their side; had not the Illyrian pirates whom he let\r\nloose on this new enemy provoked the Romans to cross the Adriatic; and\r\nhad not the Dardanians moved down on Macedon and defeated and killed\r\nhim in battle. Such \"had nots\" belonged, however, to the constant\r\npossibilities, and complications of this sort were ever occurring in\r\nthe struggle of Macedon for the hegemony of Greece. On this occasion\r\ntheir issue was so disastrous for Macedon that the hour of the two\r\nleagues seemed come.\r\n\r\nBut what should have been their triumph proved to be their destruction.\r\nFor the frustration of their hopes Polybius,[134] who voices the\r\nopinion of Aratus, held the Ætolians responsible, and it is likely that\r\nhe was in the main right. For just at this critical moment, when the\r\nAchæans were face to face with the most serious problem which their\r\nfederal system presented, namely, the reluctance of states, like Sparta\r\nand Athens, which were markedly stronger than the common run of the\r\nAchæan cities, to accept mere equality with them, the Ætolians not only\r\nleft them in the lurch and made an advantageous peace for themselves\r\nwith Antigonus Doson, the new king of Macedon, but, by ceding to Sparta\r\ntheir Arcadian cities (Tegea, Mantinea, Orchomenus, and Caphiæ), they\r\nmade it possible for Cleomenes, the young Spartan monarch, to rally\r\nround himself all the Peloponnesian opposition to the Achæans, and to\r\nmake a brilliant effort to establish once again the Spartan hegemony\r\nin the peninsula. Another view of the matter is that the downfall of\r\nthe Achæan league--which, to escape Cleomenes, threw itself into the\r\narms of Antigonus Doson--was due to the intervention of Ptolemy III,\r\nwho backed up Sparta, Athens, and Ætolia by his friendship and his\r\nmoney,[135] and would have gladly seen Achæa eliminated in order that\r\nGreece might present a united front to Antigonus Doson. In any case it\r\nwas Antigonus Doson who reaped the benefits, and it seems unlikely that\r\nthey were wholly an unearned increment. What he was capable of he had\r\nalready shown by joining heartily in the international guarantee of\r\nthe neutrality of Athens which had robbed Aratus of that choice prize.\r\nHe was clearly no common man, and had he not died an untimely death\r\nshortly after the great victory he gained over Cleomenes at Sellasia\r\n(222 B.C.), he would probably have been much better known in history.\r\nHis energetic and tactful conduct in this crisis contrasts sharply with\r\nthe nerveless backdown of Egypt, for which the only excuse was the\r\nimminent demise of Euergetes and the threatening attitude of Antiochus\r\nthe Great. It cannot be denied that Antigonus Doson made a good use of\r\nall his opportunities.\r\n\r\nHis settlement of Hellenic affairs was characterized by the revival of\r\nthe general synod established by the great Philip.[136] Representatives\r\nof the Hellenic states met in formal assembly at Corinth (224 B.C.),\r\nand chose the king of Macedon as their hegemon. Subsequently the synod\r\nwas to meet at a time and place to be designated by its head. A mere\r\nenumeration of the states which took this action tells the story of\r\nthe constitutional development of Hellas in the Macedonian age. They\r\nwere Macedon, Thessaly, Epirus, Acarnania, Locris, Phocis, Boeotia,\r\nEuboea, Achæa, and probably the Islanders. Of these the first was a\r\nkingdom,[137] but all the others were leagues. The city-states, which\r\nhad been everything in Philip's synod, have disappeared, swallowed\r\nup in the federations. Whether each of the units had now an equal\r\nnumber of votes, or, as in the time of Philip, a number proportionate\r\nto its size, we do not know, though the second alternative is the\r\nmore probable one. In both cases Macedonian deputies took part in the\r\nmeetings of the synod and served as heads of the Macedonian interest.\r\nTogether with the deputies from Thessaly and other subservient states\r\nthey probably formed a majority in the synod. In both Philip II and\r\nAntigonus Doson, Macedon had, accordingly, at once hegemons and kings.\r\nWe hear of nothing in the revived Hellenic league comparable with the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety of the old one; but nothing similar was\r\nnow required, since the generals of the constituent leagues were the\r\nnatural representatives of these bodies when the synod was not in\r\nsession. They had thus a place provided for them in the scheme of\r\nAntigonus Doson.\r\n\r\nThe republican reaction against the policy of Antigonus Gonatas had\r\nby no means spent its force. This is shown in the seriousness with\r\nwhich it was now reckoned with by Antigonus Doson. He could not ignore\r\nthe well established practice of the league assemblies to decide all\r\nimportant questions of foreign policy. Hence his synod differs from\r\nthat of Philip II particularly in this important respect, that its\r\naction in declaring war, concluding peace, and other like matters was\r\ntaken subject to ratification by the league authorities, and was,\r\nseemingly, binding only on such of them as ratified it.[138] His synod,\r\nin other words, stood to the league assemblies as the Achæan synod\r\nstood to the Achæan _syncletus_. Naturally, the confederates could not\r\nwithdraw from the hegemony at pleasure, much less join its enemies;\r\nso that the refusal of a league to accept a decision of the synod to\r\ndeclare war meant only that it assumed a position of neutrality. In\r\nPhilip's time each city had had to pay per day a fine of thirty drachmæ\r\nfor every horseman, twenty drachmæ for every hoplite, ten drachmæ\r\nfor every light-armed soldier, and seven or eight drachmæ for every\r\nsailor who was absent from a duly authorized expedition.[139] Now the\r\nleagues could refuse to coöperate without suffering any penalty. They\r\nsurrendered their liberty to fight one another, and their right to\r\ncontract alliances with outside states; but they did not surrender\r\ntheir diplomacy entirely to the hegemon, though they agreed to enter\r\ninto no negotiations with any outside king.[140] They gave their\r\nhegemon no right whatever to interfere in their local concerns.[141]\r\n\r\nSuch were the generous concessions to local sentiment by means of which\r\nAntigonus Doson sought to place the hegemony of the kings of Macedon\r\nin Hellas on a secure basis. Never before in the history of the people\r\nhad a conqueror made so noble a use of his power. Antigonus Doson went\r\nin fact so far in conciliating the Greek states that had he withdrawn\r\nMacedonian troops from Demetrias, Chalcis, and Corinth,--the three\r\nshackles of Hellas,--added new conquests like Orchomenus, Sparta,\r\nand Messene to the constituent leagues instead of to the central\r\norganization, and possessed less personal prestige, it is difficult\r\nto imagine how the Hellenic league could ever have been brought into\r\naction. Probably all that he cared to be absolutely sure of was the\r\nneutrality of the confederates who did not support him in the field.\r\n\r\nIn any case that was all that his successor Philip V was able to\r\naccomplish, when, in 220 B.C., he had the Hellenic synod accept the\r\nrepeated challenge of war offered to him by the Ætolians, who, taking\r\nadvantage of the accession of a young and untried king to the throne\r\nof Macedon, assailed his hegemony in Greece while it was still\r\nprecarious. Had Doson lived to wage the Social War (220-217 B.C.),\r\nhe might have crushed the Ætolians by sheer weight of numbers, and\r\nhave completed the unification of Hellas. Philip V fought bravely and\r\nskillfully and won the respect of both his friends and his foes; but\r\nbefore any definite issue of the struggle had arrived, the campaign\r\nbetween Hannibal and the Romans had reached such a point that the\r\nhegemon of Hellas dared not neglect it any longer.\r\n\r\n\"Let Greece,\" said Agelaus of Naupactus at the peace conference which\r\nfollowed,[142] \"be united; let no Greek state make war upon any other;\r\nlet them thank the Gods if they can all live in peace and agreement,\r\nif, as men in crossing rivers grasp one another's hands, so they can\r\nhold together and save themselves and their cities from barbarian\r\ninroads. If it is too much to hope that it should be so always, let\r\nit at least be so just now; let Greeks, now at least, unite and keep\r\non their guard, when they behold the vastness of the armies and the\r\ngreatness of the struggle going on in the West. No man who looks at\r\nthe state of things with common care can doubt what is coming. Whether\r\nRome conquers Carthage or Carthage conquers Rome, the victor will not\r\nbe content with the dominion of the Greeks of Italy and Sicily; he will\r\nextend his plans and his warfare much further than suits us or our\r\nwelfare. Let all Greece be on its guard, and Philip above all. Your\r\ntruest defense, O King,\" he continued, \"will be found in the character\r\nof the chief and protector of the Greeks. Leave off destroying Greek\r\ncities; leave off weakening them till they become a prey to every\r\ninvader. Rather watch over Greece, as you watch over your own body;\r\nguard the interests of all her members as you guard the interest of\r\nwhat is your own. If you follow such a course as this, you will win\r\nthe good will of Greece; you will have every Greek bound to you as\r\na friend and as a sure supporter in all your undertakings; foreign\r\npowers will see the confidence which the whole nation reposes in you,\r\nand will fear to attack either you or them. If you wish for conquest\r\nand military glory, another field invites you. Cast your eyes to the\r\nWest; look at the war raging in Italy; of that war you may easily, by\r\na skilful policy, make yourself the arbiter; a blow dealt in time may\r\nmake you master of both the contending powers. If you cherish such\r\nhopes, no time bids fairer than the present for their accomplishment.\r\nBut as for disputes and wars with Greeks, put them aside till some\r\nseason of leisure; let it be your main object to keep in your own hands\r\nthe power of making war and peace with them when you will. If once the\r\nclouds which are gathering in the West should advance and spread over\r\nGreece and the neighboring lands, there will be danger indeed that\r\nall our truces and wars, all the child's play with which we now amuse\r\nourselves, will be suddenly cut short. We may then pray in vain to the\r\nGods for the power of making war and peace with one another, and indeed\r\nof dealing independently with any of the questions which may arise\r\namong us.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker was right, and Philip took his advice. But when he became\r\nembroiled with Rome, it was the speaker's own countrymen, the Ætolians,\r\nwho, by attacking Macedon in the rear, contributed most to the dreaded\r\nsequel: that never after 212 B.C. did the Greeks have an opportunity\r\nof dealing independently with any of the questions which arose among\r\nthem. At the time of the Social War Macedon missed its last chance of\r\nestablishing a single state in European Hellas.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n 1.
