And although, after their first Recesse at\r\nEaster, Wee found that they misspent a great deale of time, rather\r\nvpon the inlarging of the limites of their liberties, and diuers other\r\ncurious, and vnprofitable things, then vpon the framing and proponing\r\nof good and profitable Lawes: Yet Wee gaue them time and scope for\r\ntheir Parliamentary proceedings, and prolonged the Session to an\r\nvnusuall length, continuing it vntill the eight and twentieth day of\r\nMay, before Wee signified Our purpose for their Recesse; and then Wee\r\ndeclared, that Wee would make a Recesse on the fourth day of Iune next\r\nfollowing, but only for a time, and in such maner, as might bee without\r\ndisturbance to any their businesses in hand, expressing out of Our\r\nGrace (though We needed not) the causes of that Our purpose, which were\r\nthe season of the yeere, vsually hot, and vnfit for great assemblies,\r\nOur Progresse approaching, the necessitie Wee had to make vse of\r\nOur Councell attending in both houses, both to settle Our waightie\r\naffaires of State before Wee went, and to attend Vs when Wee went Our\r\nProgresse, the disfurnishing of Our ordinary Courts of Iustice so many\r\nTermes together, the long absence of Iustices of Peace, and Deputy\r\nLieuetenants, whose presence was needfull for making and returning of\r\nmusters, and for subordinate gouernement of the Countrey; and therefore\r\nWe appointed to adiourne the Parliament on the fourth day of Iune,\r\ngiuing that warning longer then vsuall, that they might set in order\r\ntheir businesses, and prepare their greeuances, which Wee promised both\r\nto heare and answer before that Recesse, for presenting whereof Wee\r\nappointed them a time. This message graciously intended by Vs, was not\r\nso well entertained by some, who in a short time dispersed and spred\r\ntheir iealousies vnto others, and thereby occasioned discontentment\r\nin the House, for being adiourned without passing of Billes; Yet made\r\nnot their addresse to Vs, as had beene meet, but desired a conference\r\nwith the Lords; and at that conference, the nine and twentieth day of\r\nMay, vnder colour of desiring to petition Vs for some further time,\r\nto perfect and passe some speciall Bils, were imboldened, not onely\r\nto dispute, but to retell all the reasons that We had giuen for the\r\nadiournement, which being made knowen vnto Vs, Wee againe signified Our\r\npleasure to both Houses, that on the fourth day of Iune the Parliament\r\nshould rise, but We would then giue Our Royall assent to such billes,\r\nas were or should be ready and fit to be then passed, continuing all\r\nother businesses in state they were by a speciall Act to bee framed for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Lords with all duetie and respect, submitted to Our resolution,\r\npassed the Act, and sent it with speciall recommendation to the House\r\nof Commons; but they neither read it, nor proceeded with businesses,\r\nbut forgetting that the time was Ours and not theirs, continued their\r\ndiscontentment, as they pretended, for being so soone dismissed.\r\nWe (though it were strange to obserue such auersnesse for Our\r\nresoluing vpon such waighty reasons, that wherin Wee needed not to\r\nbee measured by any other rule, but Our owne Princely will) yet were\r\ncontented to descend from Our owne Right, to alter Our resolution,\r\nand to continue the Session for a fortnight more, wherein they might\r\nperfite such publique Billes, as were esteemed of most importance: for\r\nwhich purpose, We Our selfe came in person vnto the Higher house of\r\nParliament, and made offer thereof vnto them, which being in effect\r\nas much as the Commons had formerly desired, was no sooner offered,\r\nbut yeelding thankes to Vs, the said Commons resolued the same day\r\ndirectly, contrary to their former desire, to refuse it, and to\r\naccept Our first Resolution of an adiournement; but attending Vs at\r\nGreenwich, presented no grieuances: This inconstancie, as Wee passed\r\nby with a gentle admonition; so for the matter of grieuances, aswell\r\nof England, as Ireland, We promised to take them into Our owne care,\r\nthough not presented to Vs, and really performed the same so farre\r\nforth, as time, and the aduice of Our Councell of each Kingdome could\r\nenable Vs, as is witnessed by Our seuerall Proclamations, published\r\nin both Realms, as likewise in granting at the same time those three\r\nsuites which were proponed vnto Vs by the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury,\r\nat the request, and in the name of both the Houses: But in conclusion\r\nof the house of Commons making it their choise, Wee made a Recesse by\r\nadiournement of the Parliament, the fourth day of Iune; Though indeed\r\nWe must doe them this right, that at the said Recesse, taking into\r\ntheir serious consideration the present estate of Our children abroad,\r\nand the generall afflicted estate of the true Professors of Religion\r\nin forraine parts, they did with one vnanimous consent, in the name of\r\nthemselues, and the whole body of the Kingdome, make a most dutifull\r\nand solemne protestation, that if Our pious Endeauours, by treatie to\r\nprocure their peace and safetie, should not take that good effect which\r\nwas desired, (in the treatie whereof, they humbly besought Vs, not to\r\nsuffer any long delay) then, vpon signification of Our pleasure in\r\nParliament, they would be ready, to the vttermost of their powers, both\r\nwith liues and fortunes to assist Vs; so as that by the diuine helpe\r\nof Almightie God, We might be able to doe that by Our sword, which by\r\npeaceable courses should not be effected.\r\n\r\nBut during the time of this long Recesse, hauing to Our great charges\r\nmediated with the Emperour, by the meanes of Our Embassadour, the\r\nLord =DIGBIE=, and hauing found those hopes to fayle, which We had to\r\npreuaile by treaty, Wee in confidence of the Assistance of Our people,\r\nthus freely promised and protested in Parliament, did instantly shorten\r\nthe time of the Recesse, (which We had before appointed to continue\r\nvntill the eighth day of February,) and did reassemble Our Parliament,\r\nthe twentieth day of Nouember last, and made knowen vnto them the true\r\nstate and necessity of Our Childrens affayres, declaring Our resolution\r\nvnto them, of taking vpon Vs the defence of Our Childrens patrimony,\r\nby way of Armes, since We could not compasse it by an amicable treaty;\r\nand therefore expected the fruit of that their declaration, whereby We\r\nwere inuited vnto this course: wherein, howbeit We are well satisfied\r\nof the good inclination of the most part of Our House of Commons,\r\ntestified by their ready assent to the speedy payment of a Subsidie,\r\nnewly to bee granted, yet vpon this occasion some particular members\r\nof that House tooke such inordinate liberty, not only to treat of Our\r\nhigh Prerogatiues, and of sundry things, that without Our speciall\r\ndirection were no fit subiects to be treated of in Parliament; but\r\nalso to speake with lesse respect of forraigne Princes, Our Allies,\r\nthen were fit for any Subiect to doe of anoynted Kings, though in\r\nenmity and hostility with Vs. And when, vpon this occasion, Wee vsed\r\nsome reprehension towardes those miscarriages, requiring them not\r\nto proceede but in such things as were within the capacity of that\r\nHouse, according to the continuall custome of Our Predecessors, then\r\nby the meanes of some euil affected and discontented persons, such\r\nheat and distemper was raysed in the House, that albeit themselues\r\nhad sued vnto Vs for a Session, and for a generall Pardon, vnto both\r\nwhich at their earnest suit We assented, yet after this fire kindled,\r\nthey reiected both, and setting apart all businesses of consequence &\r\nwaight (notwithstanding Our admonition and earnest pressing them to\r\ngoe on) they either sate as silent, or spent the time in disputing of\r\nPriuiledges, descanting vpon the words and syllables of Our Letters\r\n& messages, which for better cleering of trueth, and satisfaction of\r\nall men, We are about to publish in Print, so soone as possibly We\r\ncan. And although in Our Answere to their petition, Wee gaue them full\r\nassurance that Wee would be as carefull of the preseruation of their\r\nPriuiledges, as of Our owne Royall Prerogatiue; and in Our explanation\r\nafter sent vnto them by Our Letters, written to Our Secretary, We\r\ntold them that Wee neuer meant to denie them any lawful priuiledges\r\nthat euer that House enioyed in Our predecessours times; and that\r\nwhatsoeuer priuiledges or liberties they enioyed by any Law or Statute,\r\nshould euer bee inuiolably preserued by Vs; and We hoped Our posterity\r\nwould imitate Our footsteps therein; and whatsoeuer priuiledges they\r\nenioyed by long custome, and vncontrolled and lawful Presidents, We\r\nwould likewise be as carefull to preserue them, and transmit the care\r\ntherof to Our posterity, confessing Our selues in iustice to be bound\r\nto maintaine them in their Rights, and in grace, that We were rather\r\nminded to increase, then infringe any of them, if they should so\r\ndeserue at Our hands, which might satisfie any reasonable man, that\r\nWe were farre from violating their priuiledges. And although by Our\r\nLetters written to their Speaker, Wee aduised them to proceede, and\r\nmake this a Session, to the end, that Our good & louing subiects might\r\nhaue some taste, aswell of Our grace and goodnes towards them, by Our\r\nfree pardon and good Lawes to bee passed, as they had both by the great\r\nand vnusuall examples of Iustice since this meeting, and the so many\r\neases and comforts giuen vnto them by Proclamation. And although We had\r\ngiuen order for the Pardon to goe on, and that in a more gracious and\r\nliberall manner then hath passed in may yeeres before, and signified\r\nOur willingnesse, that rather then time should bee misspent, they\r\nmight lay aside the thought of the Subsidie, and goe on with an Act\r\nfor continuance of Statutes, and the generall Pardon; yet all this\r\npreuailed not to satisfie them, either for their pretended Priuiledges,\r\nor to perswade them to proceed with Bils for the good of themselues,\r\nand those that sent them. But as the Session and Pardon were by them\r\nwell desired at first; so were they as ill reiected at the last; and\r\nnotwithstanding the sinceritie of Our protestations, not to inuade\r\ntheir Priuiledges; yet by the perswasion of such as had beene the\r\ncause of all these distempers, they fall to carue for themselues, and\r\npretending causelesly to bee occasioned thereunto, in an vnseasonable\r\nhoure of the day, and a very thinne House, contrary to their owne\r\nCustome in all matters of waight, conclude, and enter a protestation\r\nfor their liberties, in such ambiguous and generall words, as might\r\nserue for future times to inuade most of Our inseparable Rights and\r\nPrerogatiues, annexed to Our Imperiall Crowne: whereof not onely in the\r\ntimes of other Our Progenitors, but in the blessed Raigne of Our late\r\nPredecessor, that renowned Queene =ELIZABETH=, Wee found Our Crowne\r\nactually possessed; an vsurpation that the Maiesty of a King can by no\r\nmeanes endure. By all which may appeare, that howsoeuer in the generall\r\nproceedings of that House, there are many footsteps of louing and well\r\naffected duetie to Vs: yet some ill tempered spirits haue sowed tares\r\namong the corne, and thereby frustrated the hope of that plentifull and\r\ngood haruest, which might haue multiplyed the wealth and welfare of\r\nthis whole land; and by their cunning diuersions haue imposed vpon Vs a\r\nnecessitie of discontinuing this present Parliament, without putting\r\nvnto it the name or period of a Session.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, whereas the said Assembly of Parliament was by Our\r\nCommission adiourned vntill the eight day of February now next\r\nensuring, Wee, minding not to continue the same any longer, and\r\ntherfore not holding it fit to cause the Prelates, Noblemen, and States\r\nof this Our Realm, or the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the\r\nsame Parliament to trauaile thereabout, haue thought fit to signifie\r\nthis Our resolution, with the reasons thereof vnto all Our Subiects,\r\ninhabiting in all parts of this Realme, willing and requiring the said\r\nPrelates, Noblemen and States, and also the said Knights, Citizens, and\r\nBurgesses, and all others, to whom in this case it shall appertaine,\r\nthat they forbeare to attend at the day and place prefixed by the\r\nsaid adiournement; and in so doing, they are and shall bee hereby\r\ndischarged thereof against Vs. And Wee doe hereby further declare, that\r\nthe said Conuention of Parliament, neither is, nor after the ceasing\r\nand breaking thereof shall bee, nor ought to bee esteemed, adiudged, or\r\ntaken to be, or make any Session or Parliament.\r\n\r\nAnd albeit Wee are at this time enforced to breake off this Conuention\r\nof Parliament: yet Our will and desire is, that all Our subiects should\r\ntake notice, for auoyding of all sinister suspicions and iealousies,\r\nthat Our intent and full resolution is, to gouerne Our people in the\r\nsame manner, as Our Progenitors and Predecessours, Kings and Queenes\r\nof this Realme, of best gouernment, haue heretofore done; and that Wee\r\nshall be carefull, both in Our owne person, and by charging Our Priuie\r\nCounsell, Our Iudges, and other Our Ministers in their seuerall places\r\nrespectiuely, to distribute true Iustice and right vnto all Our people;\r\nand that Wee shall bee as glad to lay hold of the first occasion in due\r\nand conuenient time, which Wee hope shall not bee long, to Call and\r\nAssemble Our Parliament, with confidence of the true and hearty loue\r\nand affection of Our subiects, as either Wee, or any of Our Progenitors\r\nhaue beene at any time heretofore.\r\n\r\n\r\n Giuen at Our Pallace at Westminster,\r\n     the sixth day of Ianuary, in the\r\n     nineteenth yeere of Our Reigne\r\n     of Great Britaine, France, and\r\n     Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n           God saue the King.\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\n          LONDON,\r\n Printed by BONHAM NORTON,\r\n and IOHN BILL, Printers\r\n to the Kings most Excellent\r\n         Maiestie.\r\n           1621.\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n           TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES\r\n\r\n Original spelling and punctuation retained.\r\n\r\n Italics have been replaced with _underscores_\r\n\r\n Small capitals have been replaced with ALL CAPS.\r\n\r\n Font changes have been replaced with =ALL CAPS=.",
