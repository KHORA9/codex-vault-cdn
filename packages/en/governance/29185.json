BUSH\r\n\r\n  NOVEMBER 6, 2001\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in Washington, D.C., New\r\nYork City, and Pennsylvania were acts of war against the United States\r\nof America and its allies, and against the very idea of civilized\r\nsociety. No cause justifies terrorism. The world must respond and fight\r\nthis evil that is intent on threatening and destroying our basic\r\nfreedoms and our way of life. Freedom and fear are at war.\r\n\r\nThe enemy is not one person. It is not a single political regime.\r\nCertainly it is not a religion. The enemy is terrorism--premeditated,\r\npolitically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets\r\nby subnational groups or clandestine agents. Those who employ\r\nterrorism, regardless of their specific secular or religious\r\nobjectives, strive to subvert the rule of law and effect change through\r\nviolence and fear. These terrorists also share the misguided belief\r\nthat killing, kidnapping, extorting, robbing, and wreaking havoc to\r\nterrorize people are legitimate forms of political action.\r\n\r\nThe struggle against international terrorism is different from any\r\nother war in our history. We will not triumph solely or even primarily\r\nthrough military might. We must fight terrorist networks, and all those\r\nwho support their efforts to spread fear around the world, using every\r\ninstrument of national power--diplomatic, economic, law enforcement,\r\nfinancial, information, intelligence, and military. Progress will come\r\nthrough the persistent accumulation of successes--some seen, some\r\nunseen. And we will always remain vigilant against new terrorist\r\nthreats. Our goal will be reached when Americans and other civilized\r\npeople around the world can lead their lives free of fear from\r\nterrorist attacks.\r\n\r\nThere will be no quick or easy end to this conflict. At the same time,\r\nthe United States, will not allow itself to be held hostage by\r\nterrorists. Combating terrorism and securing the U.S. homeland from\r\nfuture attacks are our top priorities. But they will not be our only\r\npriorities. This strategy supports the National Security Strategy of\r\nthe United States. As the National Security Strategy highlights, we\r\nlive in an age with tremendous opportunities to foster a world\r\nconsistent with interests and values embraced by the United States and\r\nfreedom-loving people around the world. And we will seize these\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nThis combating terrorism strategy further elaborates on Section III of\r\nthe the National Security Strategy by expounding on our need to destroy\r\nterrorist organizations, win the \"war of ideas,\" and strengthen\r\nAmerica's security at home and abroad. While the National Strategy for\r\nHomeland Security focuses on preventing terrorist attacks within the\r\nUnited States, the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism focuses on\r\nidentifying and defusing threats before they reach our borders.\r\n\r\nWhile we appreciate the nature of the difficult challenge before us,\r\nour strategy is based on the belief that sometimes the most difficult\r\ntasks are accomplished by the most direct means.\r\n\r\nOurs is a strategy of direct and continuous action against terrorist\r\ngroups, the cumulative effect of which will initially disrupt, over\r\ntime degrade, and ultimately destroy the terrorist organizations. The\r\nmore frequently and relentlessly we strike the terrorists across all\r\nfronts, using all the tools of statecraft, the more effective we will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe United States, with its unique ability to build partnerships and\r\nproject power, will lead the fight against terrorist organizations of\r\nglobal reach. By striking constantly and ensuring that terrorists have\r\nno place to hide, we will compress their scope and reduce the\r\ncapability of these organizations. By adapting old alliances and\r\ncreating new partnerships, we will facilitate regional solutions that\r\nfurther isolate the spread of terrorism. Concurrently, as the scope of\r\nterrorism becomes more localized, unorganized and relegated to the\r\ncriminal domain, we will rely upon and assist other states to eradicate\r\nterrorism at its root.\r\n\r\nThe United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the\r\ninternational community in this fight against a common foe. If\r\nnecessary, however, we will not hesitate to act alone, to exercise our\r\nright to self-defense, including acting preemptively against terrorists\r\nto prevent them from doing harm to our people and our country.\r\n\r\nThe war on terrorism is asymmetric in nature but the advantage belongs\r\nto us, not the terrorists. We will fight this campaign using our\r\nstrengths against the enemy's weaknesses. We will use the power of our\r\nvalues to shape a free and more prosperous world. We will employ the\r\nlegitimacy of our government and our cause to craft strong and agile\r\npartnerships. Our economic strength will help failing states and assist\r\nweak countries in ridding themselves of terrorism. Our technology will\r\nhelp identify and locate terrorist organizations, and our global reach\r\nwill eliminate them where they hide. And as always, we will rely on the\r\nstrength of the American people to remain resolute in the face of\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\nWe will never forget what we are ultimately fighting for--our\r\nfundamental democratic values and way of life. In leading the campaign\r\nagainst terrorism, we are forging new international relationships and\r\nredefining existing ones in terms suited to the transnational\r\nchallenges of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nWe seek to integrate nations and peoples into the mutually beneficial\r\ndemocratic relationships that protect against the forces of disorder\r\nand violence. By harnessing the power of humanity to defeat terrorism\r\nin all its forms, we promote a freer, more prosperous, and more secure\r\nworld and give hope to our children and generations to come.\r\nUltimately, our fight against terrorism will help foster an\r\ninternational environment where our democratic interests are secure and\r\nthe values of liberty are respected around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF THE TERRORIST THREAT TODAY\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_We have seen their kind before. They are the heirs of all the\r\n  murderous ideologies of the 20th century. By sacrificing\r\n  human life to serve their radical visions--by abandoning\r\n  every value except the will to power--they follow\r\n  in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism.\r\n  And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends:\r\n  in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies._\"\r\n\r\n  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH\r\n\r\n  ADDRESS TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS\r\n    AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\r\n\r\n  SEPTEMBER 20, 2001\r\n\r\n\r\nAmericans know that terrorism did not begin on September 11, 2001.\r\nRegrettably, its history is long and all too familiar. The first major\r\nterrorist attack on New York City's financial district, for instance,\r\ndid not occur on September 11, or even with the 1993 truck bombing of\r\nthe World Trade Center. It occurred September 16, 1920, when anarchists\r\nexploded a horse cart filled with dynamite near the intersections of\r\nWall and Broad Streets, taking 40 lives and wounding about 300 others.\r\nStarting with the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901\r\nand continuing with the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and\r\nKenya in 1998 and the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, American history in\r\nthe 20th century was punctuated by terrorism.\r\n\r\nAmericans also understand that we are not alone in the struggle against\r\nterror. Terrorists have left their mark in some way upon every country\r\nin the world. Citizens from some 90 countries died in the attacks of\r\nSeptember 11. For decades, the United States and our friends abroad\r\nhave waged the long struggle against the terrorist menace. We have\r\nlearned much from these efforts.\r\n\r\nEven as we experience success in the war on terrorism, new enemies may\r\nemerge. Thus, the United States will confront the threat of terrorism\r\nfor the foreseeable future. Consequently, we must continue to take\r\naggressive action to uncover individuals and groups engaged in\r\nterrorist activity, by analyzing the common characteristics of\r\nterrorists in order to understand where our enemies are weak and where\r\nthey are strong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 1_: The Structure of Terror]\r\n\r\n+The Structure of Terror+\r\n\r\nDespite their diversity in motive, sophistication, and strength,\r\nterrorist organizations share a basic structure as depicted in _figure\r\n1_.\r\n\r\nAt the base, underlying conditions such as poverty, corruption,\r\nreligious conflict and ethnic strife create opportunities for\r\nterrorists to exploit. Some of these conditions are real and some\r\nmanufactured. Terrorists use these conditions to justify their actions\r\nand expand their support. The belief that terror is a legitimate means\r\nto address such conditions and effect political change is a fundamental\r\nproblem enabling terrorism to develop and grow.\r\n\r\nThe international environment defines the boundaries within which\r\nterrorists' strategies take shape. As a result of freer, more open\r\nborders this environment unwittingly provides access to havens,\r\ncapabilities, and other support to terrorists. But access alone is not\r\nenough. Terrorists must have a physical base from which to operate.\r\nWhether through ignorance, inability, or intent, states around the\r\nworld still offer havens--both physical (e.g., safe houses, training\r\ngrounds) and virtual (e.g., reliable communication and financial\r\nnetworks)--that terrorists need to plan, organize, train, and conduct\r\ntheir operations. Once entrenched in a safe operating environment, the\r\norganization can begin to solidify and expand. The terrorist\r\norganization's structure, membership, resources, and security determine\r\nits capabilities and reach. At the top of the structure, the terrorist\r\nleadership provides the overall direction and strategy that links all\r\nthese factors and thereby breathes life into a terror campaign. The\r\nleadership becomes the catalyst for terrorist action. The loss of the\r\nleadership can cause many organizations to collapse. Some groups,\r\nhowever, are more resilient and can promote new leadership should the\r\noriginal fall or fail. Still others have adopted a more decentralized\r\norganization with largely autonomous cells, making our challenge even\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Changing Nature of Terrorism+\r\n\r\nWhile retaining this basic structure, the terrorist challenge has\r\nchanged considerably over the past decade and likely will continue to\r\nevolve. Ironically, the particular nature of the terrorist threat we\r\nface today springs in large part from some of our past successes.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the United States and its allies combated\r\ngenerally secular and nationalist terrorist groups, many of which\r\ndepended upon active state sponsors. While problems of state\r\nsponsorship of terrorism continue, years of sustained counterterrorism\r\nefforts, including diplomatic and economic isolation, have convinced\r\nsome governments to curtail or even abandon support for terrorism as a\r\ntool of statecraft. The collapse of the Soviet Union--which provided\r\ncritical backing to terrorist groups and certain state sponsors--\r\naccelerated the decline in state sponsorship. Many terrorist\r\norganizations were effectively destroyed or neutralized, including the\r\nRed Army Faction, Direct Action, and Communist Combatant Cells in\r\nEurope, and the Japanese Red Army in Asia. Such past successes provide\r\nvaluable lessons for the future.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the Cold War, we also saw dramatic improvements in the\r\nease of transnational communication, commerce, and travel.\r\nUnfortunately, the terrorists adapted to this new international\r\nenvironment and turned the advances of the 20th century into the\r\ndestructive enablers of the 21st century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+A New Global Environment+\r\n\r\nAl-Qaida exemplifies how terrorist networks have twisted the benefits\r\nand conveniences of our increasingly open, integrated, and modernized\r\nworld to serve their destructive agenda. The al-Qaida network is a\r\nmultinational enterprise with operations in more than 60 countries. Its\r\ncamps in Afghanistan provided sanctuary and its bank accounts served as\r\na trust fund for terrorism. Its global activities are coordinated\r\nthrough the use of personal couriers and communication technologies\r\nemblematic of our era--cellular and satellite phones, encrypted e-mail,\r\ninternet chat rooms, videotape, and CD-roms. Like a skilled publicist,\r\nUsama bin Laden and al-Qaida have exploited the international media to\r\nproject his image and message worldwide.\r\n\r\nMembers of al-Qaida have traveled from continent to continent with the\r\nease of a vacationer or business traveler. Despite our coalition's\r\nsuccesses in Afghanistan and around the world, some al-Qaida operatives\r\nhave escaped to plan additional terrorist attacks. In an age marked by\r\nunprecedented mobility and migration, they readily blend into\r\ncommunities wherever they move.\r\n\r\nThey pay their way with funds raised through front businesses, drug\r\ntrafficking, credit card fraud, extortion, and money from covert\r\nsupporters. They use ostensibly charitable organizations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) for funding and recruitment.\r\nMoney for their operations is transferred surreptitiously through\r\nnumerous banks, money exchanges, and alternate remittance systems\r\n(often known as \"hawalas\")--some legitimate and unwitting, others not.\r\n\r\nThese terrorists are also transnational in another, more fundamental\r\nway--their victims. The September 11 attacks murdered citizens from\r\nAustralia, Brazil, China, Egypt, El Salvador, France, Germany, India,\r\nIsrael, Jordan, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland,\r\nTurkey, the United Kingdom and scores of other countries.\r\n\r\nAs the al-Qaida network demonstrates, the terrorist threat today is\r\nmutating into something quite different from its predecessors.\r\nTerrorists can now use the advantage of technology to disperse\r\nleadership, training, and logistics not just regionally but globally.\r\nEstablishing and moving cells in virtually any country is relatively\r\neasy in a world where more than 140 million people live outside of\r\ntheir country of origin and millions of people cross international\r\nborders every day.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, terrorist groups have become increasingly self-sufficient\r\nby exploiting the global environment to support their operations.\r\nWhether it is the FARC's involvement in the cocaine trade in Colombia,\r\nal-Qaida's profiting from the poppy fields in Afghanistan, or Abu\r\nSayyaf's kidnapping for profit in the Philippines, terrorists are\r\nincreasingly using criminal activities to support and fund their\r\nterror. In addition to finding sanctuary within the boundaries of a\r\nstate sponsor, terrorists often seek out states where they can operate\r\nwith impunity because the central government is unable to stop them.\r\nSuch areas are found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa,\r\nand Asia. More audaciously, foreign terrorists also establish cells in\r\nthe very open, liberal, and tolerant societies that they plan to attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Interconnected Terrorist Organizations+\r\n\r\nThe terrorist threat is a flexible, transnational network structure,\r\nenabled by modern technology and characterized by loose\r\ninterconnectivity both within and between groups. In this environment,\r\nterrorists work together in funding, sharing intelligence, training,\r\nlogistics, planning, and executing attacks. Terrorist groups with\r\nobjectives in one country or region can draw strength and support from\r\ngroups in other countries or regions. For example, in 2001, three\r\nmembers of the Irish Republican Army were arrested in Colombia,\r\nsuspected of training the FARC in how to conduct an urban bombing\r\ncampaign. The connections between al-Qaida and terrorist groups\r\nthroughout Southeast Asia further highlight this reality. The terrorist\r\nthreat today is both resilient and diffuse because of this mutually\r\nreinforcing, dynamic network structure.\r\n\r\n_Figure 2_ is representative of how terrorists and terrorist\r\norganizations operate on three levels. At the first level are those\r\nterrorist organizations that operate primarily within a single country.\r\nTheir reach is limited, but in this global environment their actions\r\ncan have international consequences. Such state-level groups may expand\r\ngeographically if their ambitions and capabilities are allowed to grow\r\nunchecked.\r\n\r\nAt the next level are terrorist organizations that operate regionally.\r\nThese regional operations transcend at least one international boundary.\r\n\r\nTerrorist organizations with global reach comprise the third category.\r\nTheir operations span several regions and their ambitions can be\r\ntransnational and even global.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 2_: Transnational Terrorist Networks]\r\n\r\nThese three types of organizations are linked together in two ways.\r\nFirst, they can cooperate directly by sharing intelligence, personnel,\r\nexpertise, resources, and safe havens. Second, they can support each\r\nother in less direct ways, such as by promoting the same ideological\r\nagenda and reinforcing each other's efforts to cultivate a favorable\r\ninternational image for their \"cause.\" By capitalizing on the very\r\ntechnological advances that we use within our country, terrorist\r\norganizations learn and share information garnered from our web sites,\r\nexploit vulnerabilities within our critical infrastructure, and\r\ncommunicate across the same internet paths we use each day. The\r\ninterconnected nature of terrorist organizations necessitates that we\r\npursue them across the geographic spectrum to ensure that all linkages\r\nbetween the strong and the weak organizations are broken, leaving each\r\nof them isolated, exposed, and vulnerable to defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Availability of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)+\r\n\r\nWeapons of mass destruction pose a direct and serious threat to the\r\nUnited States and the entire international community. The probability\r\nof a terrorist organization using a chemical, biological, radiological,\r\nor nuclear weapon, or high-yield explosives, has increased\r\nsignificantly during the past decade. The availability of critical\r\ntechnologies, the willingness of some scientists and others to\r\ncooperate with terrorists, and the ease of intercontinental\r\ntransportation enable terrorist organizations to more easily acquire,\r\nmanufacture, deploy, and initiate a WMD attack either on U.S. soil or\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nWhile new instruments of terror such as cyber attacks are on the rise,\r\nand other conventional instruments of terror have not diminished, the\r\navailability and potential use of a WMD is in a category by itself.\r\n\r\nWe know that some terrorist organizations have sought to develop the\r\ncapability to use WMD to attack the United States and our friends and\r\nallies. Motivated by extreme, even apocalyptic ideologies, some\r\nterrorists' ambitions to inflict mayhem seem unlimited. The Aum\r\nShinrikyo's unsuccessful efforts to deploy biological weapons and its\r\nlethal 1995 sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway provided an early\r\nwarning of such willingness to acquire and use WMD. In 1998, Usama bin\r\nLaden proclaimed the acquisition of WMD a \"religious duty,\" and\r\nevidence collected in Afghanistan proves al-Qaida sought to fulfill\r\nthis \"duty.\" The threat of terrorists acquiring and using WMD is a\r\nclear and present danger. A central goal must be to prevent terrorists\r\nfrom acquiring or manufacturing the WMD that would enable them to act\r\non their worst ambitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Summary+\r\n\r\nWhile terrorism is not new, today's terrorist threat is different from\r\nthat of the past. Modern technology has enabled terrorists to plan and\r\noperate worldwide as never before. With advanced telecommunications\r\nthey can coordinate their actions among dispersed cells while remaining\r\nin the shadows. Today's terrorists increasingly enjoy a\r\nforce-multiplier effect by establishing links with other like-minded\r\norganizations around the globe. Now, with a WMD capability, they have\r\nthe potential to magnify the effects of their actions many fold. The\r\nnew global environment, with its resultant terrorist interconnectivity,\r\nand WMD are changing the nature of terrorism. Our strategy's\r\neffectiveness ultimately depends upon how well we address these key\r\nfacets of the terrorist threat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRATEGIC INTENT\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_We must take the battle to the enemy, disrupt his plans\r\n  and confront the worst threats before they emerge.\r\n  In the world we have entered, the only path to safety is\r\n  the path of action. And this nation will act._\"\r\n\r\n  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH\r\n\r\n  JUNE 1, 2002\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intent of our national strategy is to stop terrorist attacks\r\nagainst the United States, its citizens, its interests, and our friends\r\nand allies around the world and ultimately, to create an international\r\nenvironment inhospitable to terrorists and all those who support them.\r\nTo accomplish these tasks we will simultaneously act on four fronts.\r\n\r\nThe United States and its partners will _defeat_ terrorist\r\norganizations of global reach by attacking their sanctuaries;\r\nleadership; command, control, and communications; material support; and\r\nfinances. This approach will have a cascading effect across the larger\r\nterrorist landscape, disrupting the terrorists' ability to plan and\r\noperate. As a result, it will force these organizations to disperse and\r\nthen attempt to reconsolidate along regional lines to improve their\r\ncommunications and cooperation.\r\n\r\nAs this dispersion and organizational degradation occurs, we will work\r\nwith regional partners to implement a coordinated effort to squeeze,\r\ntighten, and isolate the terrorists. Once the regional campaign has\r\nlocalized the threat, we will help states develop the military, law\r\nenforcement, political, and financial tools necessary to finish the\r\ntask (_figure 3_). However, this campaign need not be sequential to be\r\neffective; the cumulative effect across all geographic regions will\r\nhelp achieve the results we seek.\r\n\r\nWe will _deny_ further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to\r\nterrorists by ensuring other states accept their responsibilities to\r\ntake action against these international threats within their sovereign\r\nterritory. UNSCR 1373 and the 12 UN counterterrorism conventions and\r\nprotocols establish high standards that we and our international\r\npartners expect others to meet in deed as well as word.\r\n\r\nWhere states are willing and able, we will reinvigorate old\r\npartnerships and forge new ones to combat terrorism and coordinate our\r\nactions to ensure that they are mutually reinforcing and cumulative.\r\n\r\nWhere states are weak but willing, we will support them vigorously in\r\ntheir efforts to build the institutions and capabilities needed to\r\nexercise authority over all their territory and fight terrorism where\r\nit exists.\r\n\r\nWhere states are reluctant, we will work with our partners to convince\r\nthem to change course and meet their international obligations.\r\n\r\nWhere states are unwilling, we will act decisively to counter the\r\nthreat they pose and, ultimately, to compel them to cease supporting\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\nWe will _diminish_ the underlying conditions that terrorist seek to\r\nexploit by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts\r\nand resources on the areas most at risk. We will maintain the momentum\r\ngenerated in response to the September 11 attacks by working with our\r\npartners abroad and various international forums to keep combating\r\nterrorism at the forefront of the international agenda.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, we will _defend_ the United States, our citizens, and\r\nour interests at home and abroad by both proactively protecting our\r\nhomeland and extending our defenses to ensure we identify and\r\nneutralize the threat as early as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Victory in the War Against Terror+\r\n\r\nVictory against terrorism will not occur as a single, defining moment.\r\nIt will not be marked by the likes of the surrender ceremony on the\r\ndeck of the USS Missouri that ended World War II. However, through the\r\nsustained effort to compress the scope and capability of terrorist\r\norganizations, isolate them regionally, and destroy them within state\r\nborders, the United States and its friends and allies will secure a\r\nworld in which our children can live free from fear and where the\r\nthreat of terrorist attacks does not define our daily lives.\r\n\r\nVictory, therefore, will be secured only as long as the United States\r\nand the international community maintain their vigilance and work\r\ntirelessly to prevent terrorists from inflicting horrors like those of\r\nSeptember 11, 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 3_: Operationalizing the Strategy]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOALS AND OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n  \"_America is no longer protected by vast oceans.\r\n  We are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad,\r\n  and increased vigilance at home._\"\r\n\r\n  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH\r\n\r\n  JANUARY 29, 2002\r\n\r\n\r\n+_Goal_: Defeat Terrorists and Their Organizations+\r\n\r\nThe first tenet of the 4D strategy (Defeat, Deny, Diminish and Defend)\r\ncalls for defeating terrorist organizations of global reach through the\r\ndirect or indirect use of diplomatic, economic, information, law\r\nenforcement, military, financial, intelligence, and other instruments\r\nof power. The evolution of terrorist organizations into loose, flexible\r\nnetworks with small, informal groups compounds the challenges of\r\ncombating them. The United States will use all its resources, including\r\nthe ability to marshal and sustain international coalitions, to defeat\r\nnetworks and prevent the growth of new organizations. The United States\r\nand its partners will target the individuals, state sponsors, and\r\ntransnational networks that enable terrorism to flourish.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the history of combating terrorism confirms that the\r\nbest way to defeat terrorism is to isolate and localize its activities\r\nand then destroy it through intensive, sustained action. Political\r\npressures and economic sanctions have moderated some state sponsors,\r\nbut have had little effect on individual groups that can sustain an\r\nindependent presence. However, due to the broad expanse and\r\nsophistication of some of these global terrorist organizations, we must\r\nfirst act to reduce their scope and capability. This effort requires us\r\nto identify the terrorists, locate their sanctuaries, and destroy their\r\nability to plan and operate.\r\n\r\nWe cannot wait for terrorists to attack and then respond. The United\r\nStates and its partners will disrupt and degrade the ability of\r\nterrorists to act, and compel supporters of terrorism to cease and\r\ndesist. Preventing terrorist groups from gaining access to technology,\r\nparticularly that which supports WMD, will be one of our highest\r\npriorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objective: Identify terrorists and terrorist organizations_. \"Know\r\nyour enemy\" is one of the most accepted maxims in warfare.\r\nUnfortunately, our knowledge of the inner workings of some terrorist\r\norganizations remains incomplete. The Intelligence Community and law\r\nenforcement agencies will therefore continue their aggressive efforts\r\nto identify terrorists and their organizations, map their command and\r\ncontrol and support infrastructure, and then ensure we have broad, but\r\nappropriate, distribution of the intelligence to federal, state, and\r\nlocal agencies as well as to our international allies. While we will\r\nnot ignore regional or emerging threats, our operational efforts and\r\nintelligence will focus primarily upon the most dangerous groups,\r\nnamely, those with global reach or aspirations to acquire and use WMD.\r\n\r\nWe will prioritize our efforts based on the immediate threat and our\r\nnational interests. Based on this prioritization and mapping of\r\nterrorist organizations, we will determine where to position forces and\r\ncollection assets to identify terrorist ground, air, maritime, and\r\ncyber activities. Timely and advantageous positioning of these assets\r\nwill be crucial for obtaining intelligence and developing options for\r\ndecisive action.\r\n\r\nA key component of this force and asset alignment will be our ability\r\nto understand the terrorist intent through technical and document\r\nexploitation. This will require a dramatic increase in linguistic\r\nsupport. Consequently, all government agencies will review their\r\nlanguage programs to ensure adequate resources are available to meet\r\nthis demand.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence Community will continue to enhance its collection on\r\nterrorist WMD capabilities, including bioterrorism threats against\r\nagriculture and the food supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objective: Locate terrorists and their organizations_. The shadowy\r\nnature of terrorist organizations precludes an easy analysis of their\r\ncapabilities or intent. The classic net assessment of the enemy based\r\non the number of tanks, airplanes, or ships does not apply to these\r\nnon-state actors. For intelligence to succeed in this war on terrorism,\r\nthe United States must not only rely on technical intelligence, but\r\nrenew its emphasis on other types of intelligence needed to get inside\r\nthe organizations, locate their sanctuaries, and disrupt their plans\r\nand operations.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence Community will review its current capability to gather\r\nhuman and technical intelligence on terrorist organizations and make\r\nrecommendations, as necessary, to expand its recruitment, training, and\r\noperations. The Intelligence Community will continue its comprehensive\r\neffort to acquire new reporting sources, then use those sources to\r\npenetrate designated terrorist organizations to provide information on\r\nleadership, plans, intentions, modus operandi, finances,\r\ncommunications, and recruitment. The law enforcement community, using\r\nthe leverage provided by our criminal justice system, will continue its\r\nefforts to identify and locate terrorist organizations operating at\r\nhome and abroad.\r\n\r\nOur regional partners are often better poised than the United States to\r\ngain access to information and intelligence. Therefore, the\r\nintelligence and law enforcement communities will continue to expand\r\nand improve their relations with their foreign counterparts in an\r\neffort to take better advantage of their source reporting.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Destroy terrorists and their organizations_. Once we have\r\nidentified and located the terrorists, the United States and its\r\nfriends and allies will use every tool available to disrupt, dismantle,\r\nand destroy their capacity to conduct acts of terror. The final element\r\nto the Defeat goal is an aggressive, offensive strategy to eliminate\r\ncapabilities that allow terrorists to exist and operate--attacking\r\ntheir sanctuaries; leadership; command, control, and communications;\r\nmaterial support; and finances.\r\n\r\nWhile divulging the details of this aspect of the strategy would be\r\nimprudent, we will focus our efforts on three pillars. First, we will\r\nexpand our law enforcement effort to capture, detain, and prosecute\r\nknown and suspected terrorists. Second, America will focus decisive\r\nmilitary power and specialized intelligence resources to defeat\r\nterrorist networks globally. Finally, with the cooperation of its\r\npartners and appropriate international organizations, we will continue\r\nour aggressive plan to eliminate the sources of terrorist financing.\r\n\r\nTo synchronize this effort, the Department of State will take the lead\r\nin developing specific regional strategies for the defeat of terrorism.\r\nWe will further leverage regional relationships, by ensuring\r\nappropriate allied participation with the regional Combatant Commanders\r\nas they prosecute the war on terrorism.\r\n\r\n+_Goal_: Deny Sponsorship, Support, and Sanctuary to Terrorists+\r\n\r\nThe National Strategy's second front stresses denying terrorists the\r\nsponsorship, support, and sanctuary that enable them to exist, gain\r\nstrength, train, plan, and execute their attacks. The United States has\r\na long memory and is committed to holding terrorists and those who\r\nharbor them accountable for past crimes. The states that choose to\r\nharbor terrorists are like accomplices who provide shelter for\r\ncriminals. They will be held accountable for the actions of their\r\n\"guests.\"\r\n\r\nThe strategy to deny sponsorship, support, and sanctuary is three-fold.\r\nFirst, it focuses on the responsibilities of all states to fulfill\r\ntheir obligations to combat terrorism both within their borders and\r\ninternationally. Second, it helps target U.S. assistance to those\r\nstates who are willing to combat terrorism, but may not have the means.\r\nAnd finally, when states prove reluctant or unwilling to meet their\r\ninternational obligations to deny support and sanctuary to terrorists,\r\nthe United States, in cooperation with friends and allies, or if\r\nnecessary, acting independently, will take appropriate steps to\r\nconvince them to change their policies.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this front is to choke off the lifeblood of terrorist\r\ngroups--their access to territory, funds, equipment, training,\r\ntechnology, and unimpeded transit. This approach will therefore weaken\r\nterrorist organizations and their ability to conduct operations. Of\r\nparticular importance is working to prevent terrorists from acquiring\r\nthe capability to use chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear\r\nweapons, or high-yield explosives.\r\n\r\nNon-state actors play an important role in the international\r\nenvironment. Nongovernmental organizations are important in combating\r\ninternational terrorism and we will work with them to prevent\r\nterrorists from taking advantage of their services.\r\n\r\n_Objective: End the state sponsorship of terrorism_. The United States\r\nwill assume a clear and pragmatic approach in prosecuting the campaign\r\nagainst terrorism. This will include incentives for ending state\r\nsponsorship. When a state chooses not to respond to such incentives,\r\ntough decisions will be confronted. At all times within this new\r\ndynamic we will balance a nation's near-term actions against the\r\nlong-term implications and consequences.\r\n\r\nThe United States currently lists seven state sponsors of terrorism:\r\nIran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and Sudan. We are firmly\r\ncommitted to removing countries from the list once they have taken the\r\nnecessary steps under our law and policy. A checkered past does not\r\nforeclose future membership in the coalition against terrorism.\r\n\r\nIt is important for all countries to adopt a \"zero tolerance\" policy\r\nfor terrorist activity within their borders. In the new global\r\nenvironment it is also important for states to understand how\r\nterrorists and their supporters may use legitimate means of\r\ncommunication, commerce, and transportation for illegal activities.\r\n\r\nEach state that gets out of the business of sponsoring terrorism\r\nrepresents a significant step forward and offers a tangible measure of\r\nsuccess. America will never seek to remove states from the sponsorship\r\nlist by lowering the bar; instead, these states should be\r\nencouraged--or compelled--to clear the bar.\r\n\r\nWe will not have a single, inflexible approach to handling the\r\nrecognized state sponsors of terrorism. Each case is unique, with\r\ndifferent interests and legacy issues involved. Each situation demands\r\nspecifically tailored policies.\r\n\r\nWe will be open to overtures from states that want to put their\r\nsponsorship of terrorism behind them, but we will not compromise on the\r\nessential principle that there are no \"good\" or \"just\" terrorists. We\r\nwill be relentless in discrediting terrorism as a legitimate means of\r\nexpressing discontent.\r\n\r\nTo ensure we have a well orchestrated and synchronized policy, the\r\nDepartment of State will take the lead in developing policy action\r\nplans that employ both incentives and disincentives to end state\r\nsponsorship of terrorism. All appropriate departments and agencies will\r\nengage key allies to develop common or complementary strategies to\r\nsupport the above plans. So that no state miscalculates U.S. resolve,\r\nwe will articulate these policy goals through appropriate public and\r\ndiplomatic channels.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Establish and maintain an international standard of\r\naccountability with regard to combating terrorism_. In addition to U.S.\r\npressure to end state sponsorship, we will strongly support new, strict\r\nstandards for all states to meet in the global war against terrorism.\r\nStates that have sovereign rights also have sovereign responsibilities.\r\nUNSCR 1373 clearly establishes states' obligations for combating\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\nThis resolution calls upon all member states to cooperate to prevent\r\nterrorist attacks through a spectrum of activities, including\r\nsuppressing and freezing terrorist financing, prohibiting their\r\nnationals from financially supporting terrorists, denying safe haven,\r\nand taking steps to prevent the movement of terrorists. Additionally,\r\nthe 12 international counterterrorism conventions and protocols,\r\ntogether with UNSCR 1373, set forth a compelling body of international\r\nobligations relating to counterterrorism. We will continue to press all\r\nstates to become parties to and fully implement these conventions and\r\nprotocols.\r\n\r\nTogether, UNSCR 1373, the international counterterrorism conventions\r\nand protocols, and the inherent right under international law of\r\nindividual and collective self-defense confirm the legitimacy of the\r\ninternational community's campaign to eradicate terrorism. We will use\r\nUNSCR 1373 and the international counterterrorism conventions and\r\nprotocols to galvanize international cooperation and to rally support\r\nfor holding accountable those states that do not meet their\r\ninternational responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThis baseline level of commitment has four other basic advantages.\r\nFirst, it reaffirms the primacy of local efforts--the vital principle\r\nthat each nation bears primary responsibility for fighting terrorism\r\nwithin its territory. Second, it provides an internationally recognized\r\nbaseline against which the efforts of all nations--including the United\r\nStates--can be evaluated. Third, this foundation does not prevent the\r\nformation of coalitions of willing nations for special tasks above and\r\nbeyond the requirements of UNSCR 1373 and the international\r\ncounterterrorism conventions and protocols. Fourth, the United States\r\nremains free to emphasize reciprocity in its counterterrorism policies.\r\nWhile we will always meet our baseline responsibilities, U.S. efforts\r\ncan prioritize support to our allies, protect vital interests, and\r\nassist those international partners who prove themselves most willing\r\nto cooperate in the campaign against terror.\r\n\r\nThe steady increase in the number of countries that are fully\r\nimplementing UNSCR 1373 will thus provide a tangible measure of\r\nprogress in the years ahead.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will encourage international, regional, and\r\nsubregional organizations to call upon their members to adopt and fully\r\nimplement the counterterrorist conventions, protocols, and UNSCR 1373,\r\nand subsequently we will support them in their effort. To help ensure\r\ncompliance and maintain oversight, the U.S. Government will support the\r\nestablishment of a comprehensive plan to monitor and, when appropriate,\r\npublicize nations' counterterrorist activities.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the momentum since September 11 and keep the global war on\r\nterrorism in the forefront, all departments and agencies of the U.S.\r\nGovernment will promote combating terrorism as a standard agenda item\r\nfor their bilateral and multilateral discussions.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Strengthen and sustain the international effort to fight\r\nterrorism_. Defeating terrorism is our nation's primary and immediate\r\npriority. It is \"our calling,\" as President Bush has said. But it is\r\nnot our challenge alone. Unlike the Cold War, where two opposing camps\r\nled by superpower states vied for power, we are now engaged in a war\r\nbetween the civilized world and those that would destroy it. Success\r\nwill not come by always acting alone, but through a powerful coalition\r\nof nations maintaining a strong, united international front against\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n+Working with Willing and Able States+: An essential element of our\r\nstrategy remains working with others to reorient existing partnerships\r\nand create new mechanisms for cooperation among the willing and able\r\nstates around the world. No support will be more important to success\r\nthan that from the other nations that have the will and resources to\r\ncombat terrorism with us at the state, regional, and even global level.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks we have reaped the rewards\r\nof the investments made in our major alliances during the past 50\r\nyears. These rewards are evident in NATO's unprecedented invocation of\r\nArticle V of the NATO Treaty, Australia's invocation of Article IV of\r\nthe ANZUS Treaty, and in the way both our NATO and ANZUS allies have\r\nmatched words with deeds on every front in the war against terrorism.\r\n\r\nMilitary forces representing a broad coalition of countries from North\r\nAmerica, Europe, the Middle East and Oceania have participated in vital\r\noperations in Afghanistan. Japan has also provided historic support to\r\nthe campaign against terrorism. Our Western Hemispheric neighbors\r\ninvoked the Rio Treaty and have shown a commitment to combat terrorism\r\nthrough a new Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism adopted in\r\nJune 2002. But these alliances cannot be taken for granted or remain\r\nstatic. We will strive to help them evolve to meet the demands of this\r\nnew era.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, through our common efforts against terrorism, we are\r\nrecasting our relations with Russia, China, Pakistan, and India. The\r\ncooperation forged with these countries in the war on terrorism\r\nhighlights how our future relations need not be constrained by past\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nEnsuring that the current level of international cooperation is a\r\nlasting feature of our world will be a defining challenge of this era.\r\n\r\n+Enabling Weak States+: Some countries are committed to fighting\r\nterrorism but lack the capacity to fulfill their sovereign\r\nresponsibilities. Some governments, for example, lack the legal\r\nframework, training, or technical capabilities needed to fight money\r\nlaundering. Others do not have the law enforcement, intelligence, or\r\nmilitary capabilities to assert effective control over their entire\r\nterritory. After September 11, we redoubled our efforts to develop\r\nprograms that help them to acquire the necessary capabilities to fight\r\nterrorism through a variety of means, including improved legislation,\r\ntechnical assistance, new investigative techniques, intelligence\r\nsharing, and law enforcement and military training. For example, we are\r\nstepping up our efforts in the Balkans to help governments secure their\r\nborders and refocusing our assistance to place increased priority on\r\nefforts to promote the rule of law. We are helping the Armed Forces of\r\nthe Philippines to build their capacity to fight terrorism through a\r\nrobust training and professional education program.\r\n\r\nThe United States will continue to develop comprehensive plans to build\r\nstrong and agile partnerships, particularly in regions that\r\nhistorically have been difficult to engage. We will work together to\r\ndevelop programs to train foreign governments in tactics, techniques,\r\nand procedures to combat terrorism. We will review funding for\r\ninternational counterterrorism training and assistance programs and\r\nensure adequate resources are available to strengthen the capabilities\r\nof key states.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to negotiate extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance\r\nTreaties (MLATs) and expand the international coalition that supports\r\nthe war on terrorism. We will conduct an extensive review to determine\r\nthe viability of establishing new institutions that may help combat\r\nterrorism. And at every opportunity we will continue to enhance\r\ninternational counterterrorism cooperation through the further\r\nexpansion and sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information.\r\nWhile focusing on terrorism, this effort will strengthen our strategic\r\nalignments and transform the international environment.\r\n\r\n+Persuading Reluctant States+: In waging the campaign against\r\nterrorism, the United States will also confront difficult cases\r\ninvolving countries that, although capable, prove reluctant to comply\r\nwith their responsibilities in the fight against terror. Some countries\r\nwill cooperate on some fronts but not others. This unwillingness can\r\nspring from many sources, such as external threats, internal schisms\r\nthat enable one faction to use the state to extend tacit or active\r\nsupport to terrorists, or cultural or political differences that lead\r\nto disagreements over what constitutes \"terrorist\" or criminal activity.\r\n\r\nThese cases will be the most delicate. The United States recognizes\r\nthat some governments might place themselves in the crosshairs--and not\r\njust figuratively--by joining the war against terrorism. Therefore,\r\nconstructive engagement, with sustained diplomacy and targeted\r\nassistance will be used to persuade these regimes to become more\r\nwilling and, eventually able, to meet their international obligations\r\nto combat terrorism.\r\n\r\n+Compelling Unwilling States+: The unwilling states are those that\r\nsponsor or actively provide sanctuary to terrorists. Those states that\r\ncontinue to sponsor terrorist organizations will be held accountable\r\nfor their actions.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Interdict and disrupt material support for terrorists_. A\r\nkey component of any nation's sovereignty is control of its borders.\r\nEvery nation bears responsibility for the people and goods transiting\r\nits borders.\r\n\r\nWhile we expect states to fulfill their obligations, we will\r\nnevertheless be prepared to interdict terrorist ground, air, maritime,\r\nand cyber traffic by positioning forces and assets to deny terrorists\r\naccess to new recruits, financing, equipment, arms, and information. As\r\npart of this undertaking, our National Strategy to Combat Weapons of\r\nMass Destruction addresses the most serious of these threats and\r\noutlines plans and policies to execute timely, effective interdiction\r\nefforts against WMD-related materials, technologies, and expertise.\r\n\r\nSome irresponsible governments--or extremist factions within\r\nthem--seeking to further their own agenda may provide terrorists access\r\nto WMD. Such actions would be unacceptable to the United States. We are\r\nprepared to act decisively to stop terrorists from acquiring WMD or\r\nprecursors.\r\n\r\nInterdiction, whether against terrorist material support or WMD, will\r\nbe carefully coordinated to ensure prioritization of intelligence,\r\nproper allocation of resources, and, when necessary, swift, decisive\r\naction. We will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes and\r\nterrorists to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\r\n\r\nDrug trafficking and protection schemes surrounding the drug trade also\r\ngenerate vast sums of money for international organized crime\r\nsyndicates and terrorist organizations. Laundered through the\r\ninternational financial system, this money then provides a huge source\r\nof virtually untraceable funds to corrupt officials, bypass established\r\nfinancial controls, and further other illegal activities, including\r\narms trafficking and migrant smuggling. These activities ensure a\r\nsteady supply of weapons and cash and ease the movement of operatives\r\nfor terrorist organizations worldwide. Breaking the nexus between drugs\r\nand terror is a key objective in our war on terrorism and the National\r\nDrug Control Strategy outlines U.S. goals in this area.\r\n\r\nThe United States will continue to work with our friends and allies to\r\ndisrupt the financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the\r\nsources of funding, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who\r\nsupport them, deny terrorists access to the international financial\r\nsystem, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,\r\nand prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative\r\nfinancial networks.\r\n\r\nSensitive technology in the hands of terrorists can be just as damaging\r\nto our war efforts as weapons and financing. Therefore, we will\r\ncontinue to pursue an aggressive strategy that identifies sensitive\r\ninformation and technology and outlines appropriate steps to preclude\r\nterrorists from obtaining and exploiting them.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Eliminate terrorist sanctuaries and havens_. Terrorism\r\ncannot have a place of refuge. It must be rooted out and destroyed. The\r\nUnited States and the international community must develop procedures\r\nand mechanisms that will eradicate terrorism wherever it exists. An\r\nessential part of this campaign will be the promotion of international\r\nstandards of behavior and national legal systems to eliminate terrorist\r\nrefuges.\r\n\r\nThe United States will work in concert with our international and\r\nregional partners to ensure effective governance over ungoverned\r\nterritory, which could provide sanctuary to terrorists. Where there is\r\na clear indication of terrorist activity in these areas, the United\r\nStates, in conjunction with our friends and allies, will work to\r\neliminate these terrorist sanctuaries and preclude any future access to\r\nthese areas by terrorist organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence Community, in conjunction with the Department of\r\nDefense, the Department of State, and others, will conduct an annual\r\nreview and assessment of international terrorist sanctuaries and\r\nsubsequently develop plans that address the denial of these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n+_Goal_: Diminish the Underlying Conditions that Terrorists Seek to\r\nExploit+\r\n\r\nThe third component of the 4D strategy is made up of the collective\r\nefforts to diminish conditions that terrorists can exploit. While we\r\nrecognize that there are many countries and people living with poverty,\r\ndeprivation, social disenfranchisement, and unresolved political and\r\nregional disputes, those conditions do not justify the use of terror.\r\nHowever, many terrorist organizations that have little in common with\r\nthe poor and destitute masses exploit these conditions to their\r\nadvantage. The September 11 terrorists, for instance, came\r\npredominantly from the ranks of the educated and middle-class and\r\nserved in an organization led by a millionaire murderer.\r\n\r\nThese efforts to diminish underlying conditions have material as well\r\nas intangible dimensions. Ongoing U.S. efforts to resolve regional\r\ndisputes, foster economic, social, and political development,\r\nmarket-based economies, good governance, and the rule of law, while not\r\nnecessarily focused on combating terrorism, contribute to the campaign\r\nby addressing underlying conditions that terrorists often seek to\r\nmanipulate for their own advantage. Additionally, diminishing these\r\nconditions requires the United States, with its friends and allies, to\r\nwin the \"war of ideas,\" to support democratic values, and to promote\r\neconomic freedom.\r\n\r\nThe United States does not propose to undertake this difficult\r\nchallenge alone. The United States has neither the resources nor the\r\nexpertise to be in every place in the world. Moreover, the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism is not solely an American struggle. Our friends and\r\nallies face many of the same threats. It is essential for America to\r\nwork with its friends and allies in this campaign.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Partner with the international community to strengthen weak\r\nstates and prevent the (re)emergence of terrorism_. Weak states and\r\nfailed ones are a source of international instability. Often, these\r\nstates may become a sanctuary for terrorism. Therefore, we will ensure\r\nthat efforts designed to identify and diminish conditions contributing\r\nto state weakness and failure are a central U.S. foreign policy goal.\r\nThe principal objective of our collective response will be the\r\nrebuilding of a state that can look after its own people--their\r\nwelfare, health, prosperity, and freedom--and control its borders. The\r\nUnited States is willing to assist the civilized world--governments,\r\nnongovernmental agencies, and public-private partnerships--in\r\nundertaking these efforts.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to expand bilateral and multilateral efforts, such as\r\nthe U.S.-Middle East Partnership Initiative, to promote good\r\ngovernance, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and\r\nprofessionalization of local justice systems. In particular, we will\r\nbroaden the scope and strength of International Law Enforcement\r\nAcademies, and combatant commands will address civil-military relations\r\nand humanitarian assistance in their Theater Security Cooperation\r\nPlans. Additionally, the Chiefs of Mission will support and report on\r\nU.S. and local efforts to diminish underlying conditions of terrorism\r\nand encourage all nations to implement anti-corruption measures\r\npursuant to multilateral, regional, or bilateral agreements. A state's\r\nstand on terrorism will be considered when providing aid to that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Win the War of Ideas_. Together with the international\r\ncommunity, we will wage a war of ideas to make clear that all acts of\r\nterrorism are illegitimate, to ensure that the conditions and\r\nideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any\r\nnation, to diminish the underlying conditions that terrorists seek to\r\nexploit in areas most at risk, and to kindle the hopes and aspirations\r\nof freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\nWe must use the full influence of the United States to delegitimize\r\nterrorism and make clear that all acts of terrorism will be viewed in\r\nthe same light as slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no\r\nrespectable government can condone or support and all must oppose. In\r\nshort, with our friends and allies, we aim to establish a new\r\ninternational norm regarding terrorism requiring non-support,\r\nnon-tolerance, and active opposition to terrorists.\r\n\r\nThe United States will seek to support moderate and modern governments,\r\nespecially in the Muslim world. We will continue assuring Muslims that\r\nAmerican values are not at odds with Islam. Indeed, the United States\r\nhas come to the aid of many Muslims in the past--in Afghanistan,\r\nKuwait, Bosnia, and Kosovo, to name a few. The United States will work\r\nwith such moderate and modern governments to reverse the spread of\r\nextremist ideology and those who seek to impose totalitarian ideologies\r\non our Muslim allies and friends.\r\n\r\nFinding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a critical\r\ncomponent to winning the war of ideas. No other issue has so colored\r\nthe perception of the United States in the Muslim world. The\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human\r\nsuffering, because of America's close relationship with the state of\r\nIsrael and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance to\r\nother global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace for\r\neither side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed to\r\nan independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in peace\r\nand security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a government\r\nthat serves their interests and listens to their voices. The United\r\nStates will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their\r\nresponsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the\r\nconflict. The United States can play a crucial role but, ultimately,\r\nlasting peace can only come when Israelis and Palestinians resolve the\r\nissues and end the conflict between them.\r\n\r\nWe will also use effective, timely public diplomacy and government\r\nsupported media to promote the free flow of information and ideas to\r\nkindle the hopes and aspiration for freedom of those in societies ruled\r\nby the sponsors of global terrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n+_Goal_: Defend U.S. Citizens and Interests at Home and Abroad+\r\n\r\nThe final tenet of the 4D strategy encompasses our nation's collective\r\nefforts to defend the United States' sovereignty, territory, and its\r\nnational interests, at home and abroad. This tenet includes the\r\nphysical and cyber protection of the United States, its populace,\r\nproperty, and interests, as well as the protection of its democratic\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nWe face an adaptive enemy. Empowered by modern technology and\r\nemboldened by success, terrorists seek to dictate the timing of their\r\nactions while avoiding our strengths and exploiting our\r\nvulnerabilities. In an increasingly interconnected and technologically\r\nsophisticated world, where time and distance provide less and less\r\nprotection, we must be prepared to defend our interests, as a nation\r\nand as citizens.\r\n\r\nEmbodied in this strategy is the old adage that the best defense is a\r\ngood offense. By improving and coordinating our indications and threat\r\nwarnings, we will be able to detect terrorist plans before they mature.\r\nThrough continuous law enforcement, Intelligence Community, and\r\nmilitary pursuit of terrorist organizations, we will disrupt their\r\nability to execute attacks both at home and abroad, and by expanding\r\nour physical and cyber protection and awareness, we will reduce the\r\nvulnerability of U.S. personnel, critical infrastructure, and other\r\nU.S. interests.\r\n\r\nOur response to this complex mission requires a coordinated and focused\r\neffort from our entire society--the federal, state and local\r\ngovernments, the private sector, and the American people. This plan, in\r\nconcert with the National Strategy for Homeland Security, the National\r\nStrategy to Secure Cyberspace, and the National Strategy for the\r\nPhysical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets will\r\nhelp to prepare our Nation for the work ahead.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of September 11 demonstrate that our adversaries will\r\nengage asymmetrically, within and across our borders. They will exploit\r\nglobal systems of commerce, transportation, communications, and other\r\nsectors to inflict fear, destruction, and death, to compromise our\r\nnational security, and to diminish public confidence and weaken our\r\nwill to fight. Their attacks may be coordinated to counter our\r\noffensive activities abroad. Because we are a free, open, and\r\ndemocratic society, we are, and will remain, vulnerable to these\r\ndangers. Therefore, as we seek to engage globally, we must ensure a\r\nseamless web of defense across the spectrum of engagement to protect\r\nour citizens and interests both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objective: Implement the National Strategy for Homeland Security_. The\r\nestablishment of the new Department of Homeland Security will help\r\nmobilize and organize our Nation to secure the U.S. homeland from\r\nterrorist attacks. A key to this task will be the National Strategy for\r\nHomeland Security. The recommendations of the National Strategy for\r\nHomeland Security and the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism\r\ncompliment and reinforce each other. From enhancing the analytical\r\ncapabilities of the FBI and recapitalizing the U.S. Coast Guard, to\r\npreventing terrorist use of WMD through better sensors and procedures\r\nand integrating information sharing across the federal government, the\r\nobjectives in these national strategies are vital to our future success\r\nin the war on terrorism.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Attain domain awareness_. Today's world is sharply defined\r\nby compression of both time and distance. Key to defending our Nation\r\nis the effective knowledge of all activities, events, and trends within\r\nany specified domain (air, land, sea, cyber) that could threaten the\r\nsafety, security, or environment of the United States and its populace.\r\nThis \"domain awareness\" enables identification of threats as early and\r\nas distant from our borders--including territories and overseas\r\ninstallations--as possible, to provide maximum time to determine the\r\noptimal course of action.\r\n\r\nDomain awareness is dependent upon having access to detailed knowledge\r\nof our adversaries distilled through the fusion of intelligence,\r\ninformation, and data across all agencies. It means providing our\r\noperating forces--afloat, aloft, and ashore, foreign and domestic--with\r\na single integrated operating matrix of relevant information within\r\ntheir specific domain of responsibility. Domain awareness supports\r\ncoordinated, integrated, and sustained engagement of the enemy across\r\nthe full spectrum of U.S. instruments of power.\r\n\r\nThe President has instructed the leaders of the FBI, Central\r\nIntelligence, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to\r\ndevelop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all\r\nthreat information in a single location. The center is being created\r\nbecause our government must have the very best information possible to\r\nmake sure that the right people are in the right places to protect the\r\nAmerican people. The National Strategy for Homeland Security addresses\r\ninformation sharing and technology within the United States. The\r\ncomponents of this information sharing apply equally well at home and\r\nabroad. Those procedures and systems that facilitate interagency,\r\nintergovernmental, and private information sharing will be expanded to\r\nallow our overseas agencies to have access and input, as necessary.\r\nThis initiative will include not only database alignment and the\r\nhorizontal and vertical information flow; it will also optimize\r\ndisclosure policy and establish a consistent reporting criteria across\r\nagencies and allies. Additionally, implementation of both the domestic\r\nand international elements of the National Strategy to Secure\r\nCyberspace and the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of\r\nCritical Infrastructures and Key Assets are designed to help ensure\r\nthat all possible efforts are made to safeguard critical information\r\nnetworks whether located in the United States or abroad.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Enhance measures to ensure the integrity, reliability, and\r\navailability of critical physical and information-based infrastructures\r\nat home and abroad_. Much of our strength as a nation is built upon\r\nexpansive and efficient transportation, as well as logistic and\r\ninformation systems permitting unsurpassed participation in global\r\ncommerce. Infrastructures and systems that support our economy and\r\nnational interests are fully integrated, often dependent upon those\r\noutside of our borders, and span the globe. During times of rapid,\r\nprolonged, and large-scale conflict, even our military forces must rely\r\nupon portions of the global infrastructure to support sustained\r\noperations abroad.\r\n\r\nProtection of vital systems is a shared responsibility of the public\r\nand private sectors, working collectively with the owners, operators,\r\nand users of those systems. The integrity of critical infrastructures,\r\npermitting national security mobilization and global engagement during\r\ntimes of both peace and conflict, must be assured. In many cases U.S.\r\nenterprises overseas are linked or networked to domestic critical\r\ninfrastructure, and a terrorist event overseas would have a cascading\r\neffect on domestic reliability. To reduce this possibility, the\r\nDepartment of State will take the lead and, in conjunction with\r\nappropriate agencies, identify and prioritize critical infrastructure\r\noverseas and partner with industry to establish cost-effective best\r\npractices and standards to maximize security. Where appropriate, we\r\nwill coordinate with the host country to ensure its security and\r\nresponse network is adequate.\r\n\r\nSufficient defense is a balance between our need to accommodate the\r\nenhanced flow of \"low risk, high volume\" people and goods essential to\r\nour economic vitality, while at the same time focusing energy and\r\nresources on the criminal, hostile and fraudulent few. It places a\r\npremium on effective domain awareness activities, such as accurate\r\nidentification of containerized goods before they depart for the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nImplementation of the U.S. Smart Borders Initiatives with Canada and\r\nMexico, as well as the Third Border Initiative for the Caribbean Basin,\r\naddress potential vulnerabilities in the many critical physical and\r\ninformation-based infrastructures shared with our two North American\r\nallies. Moreover, the U.S. Government's comprehensive border management\r\nstrategy will greatly enhance the ability of the U.S. to screen, verify\r\nand process the entry of people and goods into the country.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Integrate measures to protect U.S. citizens abroad_.\r\nDefense of our economic vitality must be matched by increased security\r\nof U.S. citizens abroad. The nature of the threat confronting our\r\ncitizens has expanded. U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad may now\r\nbe at greater risk as potential terrorist targets. Protective measures\r\nmust benefit facilities privately owned by U.S. interests as well as\r\nembassies and military installations abroad. Similarly, U.S. travelers\r\nand citizens living abroad must be provided meaningful, up-to-date, and\r\ncoordinated threat information. The Department of State will work to\r\nenhance existing programs to inform U.S. citizens traveling or living\r\nabroad about the potential terrorist threats.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to pursue terrorist organizations of global reach, there\r\nmay be a rise in the number of hostages taken overseas. The new policy\r\non U.S. citizens taken hostage abroad, which was promulgated by the\r\nDepartment of State in February 2002, ensures that each incident\r\nreceives careful review at the federal level. The policy also calls for\r\naggressive law enforcement efforts to apprehend, prosecute, and punish\r\nterrorists consistent with crisis resolution and force-protection\r\nefforts. All appropriate agencies should be prepared with adequate\r\nresources and authorities to assist in the rescue of U.S. citizens\r\ntaken hostage abroad if the circumstances warrant.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to ensure U.S. law enforcement interests are properly\r\naddressed between the embassy and the host country, the Department of\r\nJustice working with the Department of State, will expand, where\r\nappropriate, its law enforcement presence abroad to further\r\ncounterterrorism interdiction, investigation, and prosecution.\r\nAdditionally, in coordination with host governments, the U.S.\r\ngovernment will enhance training of and assistance to host governments\r\nin building legal infrastructures to strengthen the rule of law.\r\n\r\n_Objective: Ensure an integrated incident management capability_. In\r\nthe end, prevention of catastrophic terrorism is dependent upon\r\ninterdiction of people and materials. However, solid plans,\r\npreparations, and immediate response remain key to mitigating acts of\r\nterrorism. Unity of effort requires coordination not only at the apex\r\nof the federal government, but also at the operational/tactical level,\r\nwhere response and intervention actions may be taken by diverse\r\nauthorities, acting independently or in coordination with each other.\r\nAn effective, integrated response requires incident management\r\nplanning, enhanced interoperability, and coordination, based on and\r\nsupported by rapid and effective decision-making.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to ensure rapid crisis response, the U.S. will coordinate\r\nwith host governments and regional partners to develop plans for\r\nalerting, containing, and, if necessary, repelling an attack in\r\nprogress while ensuring adequate resources are available to mitigate\r\nthe damage. At the outset of a crisis, an interagency team capable of\r\nsupporting the affected U.S. Embassy with assessments and\r\nrecommendations is essential. Consequently, the Department of State,\r\nthe Department of Defense, and other relevant agencies shall ensure\r\nthat adequate staffing, training, equipment, and transportation are\r\navailable for the Foreign Emergency Support Team. All appropriate\r\ndepartments and agencies will review and, if necessary amend, their\r\nincident-management procedures for overseas terrorist incidents\r\ninvolving critical infrastructure and facilities of U.S. national\r\nsecurity interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical violence may be endemic to the human condition, but we cannot\r\ntolerate terrorists who seek to combine the powers of modern technology\r\nand WMD to threaten the very notion of civilized society. The war\r\nagainst terrorism, therefore, is not some sort of \"clash of\r\ncivilizations\"; instead, it is a clash between civilization and those\r\nwho would destroy it.\r\n\r\nGiven these stakes, we must persevere until the United States, together\r\nwith its friends and allies, eliminates terrorism as a threat to our\r\nway of life. As our enemies exploit the benefits of our global\r\nenvironment to operate around the world, our approach must be global as\r\nwell. When they run, we will follow. When they hide, we will find them.\r\nSome battlefields will be known, others unknown. The campaign ahead\r\nwill be long and arduous. In this different kind of war, we cannot\r\nexpect an easy or definitive end to the conflict.\r\n\r\nThis National Strategy reflects the reality that success will only come\r\nthrough the sustained, steadfast, and systematic application of all the\r\nelements of national power--diplomatic, economic, information,\r\nfinancial, law enforcement, intelligence, and military--simultaneously\r\nacross four fronts. We will _defeat_ terrorist organizations of global\r\nreach through relentless action. We will _deny_ terrorists the\r\nsponsorship, support, and sanctuary they need to survive. We will win\r\nthe war of ideas and _diminish_ the underlying conditions that promote\r\nthe despair and the destructive visions of political change that lead\r\npeople to embrace, rather than shun, terrorism. And throughout, we will\r\nuse all the means at our disposal to _defend_ against terrorist attacks\r\non the United States, our citizens, and our interests around the world.\r\n\r\nWe will also be resourceful. This strategy relies upon the ingenuity,\r\ninnovation, and strength of the American people. We will rally others\r\nto this common cause. We will not only forge a diverse and powerful\r\ncoalition to combat terrorism today, but work with our international\r\npartners to build lasting mechanisms for combating terrorism and for\r\ncoordination and cooperation. Working with states that are both willing\r\nand able to be full partners in the campaign, we will attack terrorist\r\ngroups directly and indirectly, help the weak but willing states build\r\ntheir capabilities to fight terrorism, and persuade reluctant states to\r\nmeet their obligations to the international community in this fight. We\r\nwill use all our resources and resourcefulness to compel the unwilling\r\nstates to cease support for terrorism.\r\n\r\nWe will be resolute. Others might flag in the face of the inevitable\r\nebb and flow of the campaign against terrorism. But the American people\r\nwill not. We understand that we cannot choose to disengage from the\r\nworld, because in this globalized era, the world will engage us\r\nregardless. The choice is really about what kind of world we want to\r\nlive in.\r\n\r\nIn waging this war, therefore, we will be equally resolute in\r\nmaintaining our commitment to our ultimate objective. The defeat of\r\nterror is a worthy and necessary goal in its own right. But ridding the\r\nworld of terrorism is essential to a broader purpose. We strive to\r\nbuild an international order wheremore countries and peoples are\r\nintegrated into a world consistent with the interests and values we\r\nshare with our partners--values such as human dignity, rule of law,\r\nrespect for individual liberties, open and free economies, and\r\nreligious tolerance. We understand that a world in which these values\r\nare embraced as standards, not exceptions, will be the best antidote to\r\nthe spread of terrorism. This is the world we must build today.",
