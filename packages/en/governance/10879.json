  "content": "JOHN QUINCY ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, sixth President of the United States, eldest son of\r\nJohn Adams, second President, was born at Braintree, Mass., July 11,\r\n1767. He enjoyed peculiar and rare advantages for education. In\r\nchildhood he was instructed by his mother, a granddaughter of Colonel\r\nJohn Quincy, and a woman of superior talents. In 1778, when only 11\r\nyears old, he accompanied his father to France; attended a school in\r\nParis, and returned home in August, 1779. Having been taken again to\r\nEurope by his father in 1780, he pursued his studies at the University\r\nof Leyden, where he learned Latin and Greek. In July, 1781, at the age\r\nof 14, he was appointed private secretary to Francis Dana, minister to\r\nRussia. He remained at St. Petersburg until October, 1782, after which\r\nhe resumed his studies at The Hague. Was present at the signing of the\r\ndefinitive treaty of peace in Paris, September 3, 1783. He passed some\r\nmonths with his father in London, and returned to the United States to\r\ncomplete his education, entering Harvard College in 1786 and graduating\r\nin 1788. He studied law with the celebrated Theophilus Parsons, of\r\nNewburyport; was admitted to the bar in 1791, and began to practice in\r\nBoston. In 1791 he published in the Boston Centinel, under the signature\r\nof \"Publicola,\" a series of able essays, in which he exposed the\r\nfallacies and vagaries of the French political reformers. These papers\r\nattracted much attention in Europe and the United States. Under the\r\nsignature of \"Marcellus\" he wrote, in 1793, several articles, in which\r\nhe argued that the United States should observe strict neutrality in the\r\nwar between the French and the British. These writings commended him to\r\nthe favor of Washington, and he was appointed minister to Holland in\r\nMay, 1794. In July, 1797, he married Louisa Catherine Johnson, a\r\ndaughter of Joshua Johnson, of Maryland, who was then American consul at\r\nLondon. In a letter dated February 20, 1797, Washington commended him\r\nhighly to the elder Adams, and advised the President elect not to\r\nwithhold promotion from him because he was his son. He was accordingly\r\nappointed minister to Berlin in 1797. He negotiated a treaty of amity\r\nand commerce with the Prussian Government, and was recalled about\r\nFebruary, 1801. He was elected a Senator of the United States by the\r\nFederalists of Massachusetts for the term beginning March, 1803. In 1805\r\nhe was appointed professor of rhetoric and belles-lettres at Harvard\r\nCollege, and accepted on condition that he should be permitted to attend\r\nto his Senatorial duties. He offended the Federalists by supporting\r\nJefferson's embargo act, which was passed in December, 1807, and thus\r\nbecame connected with the Democratic party. He resigned his seat in the\r\nSenate in March, 1808, declining to serve for the remainder of the term\r\nrather than obey the instructions of the Federalists. In March, 1809, he\r\nwas appointed by President Madison minister to Russia. During his\r\nresidence in that country he was nominated to be an associate justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, and confirmed February, 1811;\r\nbut he declined the appointment. In 1813 Adams, Bayard, Clay, Russell,\r\nand Gallatin were appointed commissioners to negotiate a treaty of peace\r\nwith Great Britain. They met the British diplomatists at Ghent, and\r\nafter a protracted negotiation of six months signed a treaty of peace\r\nDecember 24, 1814. In the spring of 1815 he was appointed minister to\r\nthe Court of St. James, remaining there until he was appointed by Mr.\r\nMonroe Secretary of State in 1817. In 1824 Adams, Jackson, Crawford, and\r\nClay were candidates for the Presidency. Neither of the candidates\r\nhaving received a majority in the electoral colleges, the election\r\ndevolved on the House of Representatives. Aided by the influence of\r\nHenry Clay, Mr. Adams received the votes of thirteen States, and was\r\nelected. He was defeated for reelection in 1828 by General Andrew\r\nJackson. On the 4th of March, 1829, he retired to his estate at Quincy.\r\nIn 1830 he was elected to Congress, and took his seat in December, 1831.\r\nHe continued to represent his native district for seventeen years,\r\nduring which time he was constantly at his post. On the 21st of\r\nFebruary, 1848, while in his seat at the Capitol, he was stricken with\r\nparalysis, and died on the 23d of that month. He was buried at Quincy,\r\nMass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTIFICATION OF ELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, from the committee appointed for that purpose yesterday,\r\nreported that the committee had waited on John Quincy Adams, of\r\nMassachusetts, and had notified him that in the recent election of a\r\nPresident of the United States, no person having received a majority of\r\nthe votes of all the electors appointed, and the choice having\r\nconsequently devolved upon the House of Representatives, that House,\r\nproceeding in the manner prescribed by the Constitution, did yesterday\r\nchoose him to be President of the United States for four years,\r\ncommencing on the 4th day of March next, and that the committee had\r\nreceived a written answer, which he presented to the House. Mr. Webster\r\nalso reported that in further performance of its duty the committee had\r\ngiven the information of this election to the President.\r\n\r\nFebruary 10, 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply of the President Elect.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 10, 1825_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nIn receiving this testimonial from the Representatives of the people and\r\nStates of this Union I am deeply sensible to the circumstances under\r\nwhich it has been given. All my predecessors in the high station to\r\nwhich the favor of the House now calls me have been honored with\r\nmajorities of the electoral voices in their primary colleges. It has\r\nbeen my fortune to be placed by the divisions of sentiment prevailing\r\namong our countrymen on this occasion in competition, friendly and\r\nhonorable, with three of my fellow-citizens, all justly enjoying in\r\neminent degrees the public favor, and of whose worth, talents, and\r\nservices no one entertains a higher and more respectful sense than\r\nmyself. The names of two of them were, in the fulfillment of the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution, presented to the selection of the House\r\nin concurrence with my own--names closely associated with the glory of\r\nthe nation, and one of them further recommended by a larger minority of\r\nthe primary electoral suffrages than mine.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, could my refusal to accept the trust thus\r\ndelegated to me give an immediate opportunity to the people to form and\r\nto express with a nearer approach to unanimity the object of their\r\npreference, I should not hesitate to decline the acceptance of this\r\neminent charge and to submit the decision of this momentous question\r\nagain to their determination. But the Constitution itself has not so\r\ndisposed of the contingency which would arise in the event of my\r\nrefusal. I shall therefore repair to the post assigned me by the call of\r\nmy country, signified through her constitutional organs, oppressed with\r\nthe magnitude of the task before me, but cheered with the hope of that\r\ngenerous support from my fellow-citizens which, in the vicissitudes of a\r\nlife devoted to their service, has never failed to sustain me, confident\r\nin the trust that the wisdom of the legislative councils will guide and\r\ndirect me in the path of my official duty, and relying above all upon\r\nthe superintending providence of that Being in whose hands our breath is\r\nand whose are all our ways.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I pray you to make acceptable to the House the assurance of\r\nmy profound gratitude for their confidence, and to accept yourselves my\r\nthanks for the friendly terms in which you have communicated to me their\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from the President Elect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCity of Washington,\r\n_March 1, 1825_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President of the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI ask the favor of you to inform the honorable Senate of the United\r\nStates that I propose to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution to\r\nthe President of the United States before he enters on the execution of\r\nhis office, on Friday, the 4th instant, at 12 o'clock, in the Hall of\r\nthe House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect, sir, your very humble\r\nand obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with an usage coeval with the existence of our Federal\r\nConstitution, and sanctioned by the example of my predecessors in the\r\ncareer upon which I am about to enter, I appear, my fellow-citizens, in\r\nyour presence and in that of Heaven to bind myself by the solemnities of\r\nreligious obligation to the faithful performance of the duties allotted\r\nto me in the station to which I have been called.\r\n\r\nIn unfolding to my countrymen the principles by which I shall be\r\ngoverned in the fulfillment of those duties my first resort will be to\r\nthat Constitution which I shall swear to the best of my ability to\r\npreserve, protect, and defend. That revered instrument enumerates the\r\npowers and prescribes the duties of the Executive Magistrate, and in its\r\nfirst words declares the purposes to which these and the whole action of\r\nthe Government instituted by it should be invariably and sacredly\r\ndevoted--to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure\r\ndomestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the\r\ngeneral welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of\r\nthis Union in their successive generations. Since the adoption of this\r\nsocial compact one of these generations has passed away. It is the work\r\nof our forefathers. Administered by some of the most eminent men who\r\ncontributed to its formation, through a most eventful period in the\r\nannals of the world, and through all the vicissitudes of peace and war\r\nincidental to the condition of associated man, it has not disappointed\r\nthe hopes and aspirations of those illustrious benefactors of their age\r\nand nation. It has promoted the lasting welfare of that country so dear\r\nto us all; it has to an extent far beyond the ordinary lot of humanity\r\nsecured the freedom and happiness of this people. We now receive it as a\r\nprecious inheritance from those to whom we are indebted for its\r\nestablishment, doubly bound by the examples which they have left us and\r\nby the blessings which we have enjoyed as the fruits of their labors to\r\ntransmit the same unimpaired to the succeeding generation.\r\n\r\nIn the compass of thirty-six years since this great national covenant\r\nwas instituted a body of laws enacted under its authority and in\r\nconformity with its provisions has unfolded its powers and carried into\r\npractical operation its effective energies. Subordinate departments have\r\ndistributed the executive functions in their various relations to\r\nforeign affairs, to the revenue and expenditures, and to the military\r\nforce of the Union by land and sea. A coordinate department of the\r\njudiciary has expounded the Constitution and the laws, settling in\r\nharmonious coincidence with the legislative will numerous weighty\r\nquestions of construction which the imperfection of human language had\r\nrendered unavoidable. The year of jubilee since the first formation of\r\nour Union has just elapsed; that of the declaration of our independence\r\nis at hand. The consummation of both was effected by this Constitution.\r\n\r\nSince that period a population of four millions has multiplied to\r\ntwelve. A territory bounded by the Mississippi has been extended from\r\nsea to sea. New States have been admitted to the Union in numbers nearly\r\nequal to those of the first Confederation. Treaties of peace, amity, and\r\ncommerce have been concluded with the principal dominions of the earth.\r\nThe people of other nations, inhabitants of regions acquired not by\r\nconquest, but by compact, have been united with us in the participation\r\nof our rights and duties, of our burdens and blessings. The forest has\r\nfallen by the ax of our woodsmen; the soil has been made to teem by the\r\ntillage of our farmers; our commerce has whitened every ocean. The\r\ndominion of man over physical nature has been extended by the invention\r\nof our artists. Liberty and law have marched hand in hand. All the\r\npurposes of human association have been accomplished as effectively as\r\nunder any other government on the globe, and at a cost little exceeding\r\nin a whole generation the expenditure of other nations in a single year.\r\n\r\nSuch is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a Constitution\r\nfounded upon the republican principle of equal rights. To admit that\r\nthis picture has its shades is but to say that it is still the condition\r\nof men upon earth. From evil--physical, moral, and political--it is not\r\nour claim to be exempt. We have suffered sometimes by the visitation of\r\nHeaven through disease; often by the wrongs and injustice of other\r\nnations, even to the extremities of war; and, lastly, by dissensions\r\namong ourselves--dissensions perhaps inseparable from the enjoyment of\r\nfreedom, but which have more than once appeared to threaten the\r\ndissolution of the Union, and with it the overthrow of all the\r\nenjoyments of our present lot and all our earthly hopes of the future.\r\nThe causes of these dissensions have been various, founded upon\r\ndifferences of speculation in the theory of republican government; upon\r\nconflicting views of policy in our relations with foreign nations; upon\r\njealousies of partial and sectional interests, aggravated by prejudices\r\nand prepossessions which strangers to each other are ever apt to\r\nentertain.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of gratification and of encouragement to me to observe\r\nthat the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human rights\r\nhas at the close of that generation by which it was formed been crowned\r\nwith success equal to the most sanguine expectations of its founders.\r\nUnion, justice, tranquillity, the common defense, the general welfare,\r\nand the blessings of liberty--all have been promoted by the Government\r\nunder which we have lived. Standing at this point of time, looking back\r\nto that generation which has gone by and forward to that which is\r\nadvancing, we may at once indulge in grateful exultation and in cheering\r\nhope. From the experience of the past we derive instructive lessons for\r\nthe future. Of the two great political parties which have divided the\r\nopinions and feelings of our country, the candid and the just will now\r\nadmit that both have contributed splendid talents, spotless integrity,\r\nardent patriotism, and disinterested sacrifices to the formation and\r\nadministration of this Government, and that both have required a liberal\r\nindulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error. The revolutionary\r\nwars of Europe, commencing precisely at the moment when the Government\r\nof the United States first went into operation under this Constitution,\r\nexcited a collision of sentiments and of sympathies which kindled all\r\nthe passions and imbittered the conflict of parties till the nation was\r\ninvolved in war and the Union was shaken to its center. This time of\r\ntrial embraced a period of five and twenty years, during which the\r\npolicy of the Union in its relations with Europe constituted the\r\nprincipal basis of our political divisions and the most arduous part of\r\nthe action of our Federal Government. With the catastrophe in which the\r\nwars of the French Revolution terminated, and our own subsequent peace\r\nwith Great Britain, this baneful weed of party strife was uprooted. From\r\nthat time no difference of principle, connected either with the theory\r\nof government or with our intercourse with foreign nations, has existed\r\nor been called forth in force sufficient to sustain a continued\r\ncombination of parties or to give more than wholesome animation to\r\npublic sentiment or legislative debate. Our political creed is, without\r\na dissenting voice that can be heard, that the will of the people is the\r\nsource and the happiness of the people the end of all legitimate\r\ngovernment upon earth; that the best security for the beneficence and\r\nthe best guaranty against the abuse of power consists in the freedom,\r\nthe purity, and the frequency of popular elections; that the General\r\nGovernment of the Union and the separate governments of the States are\r\nall sovereignties of limited powers, fellow-servants of the same\r\nmasters, uncontrolled within their respective spheres, uncontrollable by\r\nencroachments upon each other; that the firmest security of peace is the\r\npreparation during peace of the defenses of war; that a rigorous economy\r\nand accountability of public expenditures should guard against the\r\naggravation and alleviate when possible the burden of taxation; that the\r\nmilitary should be kept in strict subordination to the civil power; that\r\nthe freedom of the press and of religious opinion should be inviolate;\r\nthat the policy of our country is peace and the ark of our salvation\r\nunion are articles of faith upon which we are all now agreed. If there\r\nhave been those who doubted whether a confederated representative\r\ndemocracy were a government competent to the wise and orderly management\r\nof the common concerns of a mighty nation, those doubts have been\r\ndispelled; if there have been projects of partial confederacies to be\r\nerected upon the ruins of the Union, they have been scattered to the\r\nwinds; if there have been dangerous attachments to one foreign nation\r\nand antipathies against another, they have been extinguished. Ten years\r\nof peace, at home and abroad, have assuaged the animosities of political\r\ncontention and blended into harmony the most discordant elements of\r\npublic opinion. There still remains one effort of magnanimity, one\r\nsacrifice of prejudice and passion, to be made by the individuals\r\nthroughout the nation who have heretofore followed the standards of\r\npolitical party. It is that of discarding every remnant of rancor\r\nagainst each other, of embracing as countrymen and friends, and of\r\nyielding to talents and virtue alone that confidence which in times of\r\ncontention for principle was bestowed only upon those who bore the badge\r\nof party communion.\r\n\r\nThe collisions of party spirit which originate in speculative opinions\r\nor in different views of administrative policy are in their nature\r\ntransitory. Those which are founded on geographical divisions, adverse\r\ninterests of soil, climate, and modes of domestic life are more\r\npermanent, and therefore, perhaps, more dangerous. It is this which\r\ngives inestimable value to the character of our Government, at once\r\nfederal and national. It holds out to us a perpetual admonition to\r\npreserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of each individual\r\nState in its own government and the rights of the whole nation in that\r\nof the Union. Whatsoever is of domestic concernment, unconnected with\r\nthe other members of the Union or with foreign lands, belongs\r\nexclusively to the administration of the State governments. Whatsoever\r\ndirectly involves the rights and interests of the federative fraternity\r\nor of foreign powers is of the resort of this General Government. The\r\nduties of both are obvious in the general principle, though sometimes\r\nperplexed with difficulties in the detail. To respect the rights of the\r\nState governments is the inviolable duty of that of the Union; the\r\ngovernment of every State will feel its own obligation to respect and\r\npreserve the rights of the whole. The prejudices everywhere too commonly\r\nentertained against distant strangers are worn away, and the jealousies\r\nof jarring interests are allayed by the composition and functions of the\r\ngreat national councils annually assembled from all quarters of the\r\nUnion at this place. Here the distinguished men from every section of\r\nour country, while meeting to deliberate upon the great interests of\r\nthose by whom they are deputed, learn to estimate the talents and do\r\njustice to the virtues of each other. The harmony of the nation is\r\npromoted and the whole Union is knit together by the sentiments of\r\nmutual respect, the habits of social intercourse, and the ties of\r\npersonal friendship formed between the representatives of its several\r\nparts in the performance of their service at this metropolis.\r\n\r\nPassing from this general review of the purposes and injunctions of the\r\nFederal Constitution and their results as indicating the first traces of\r\nthe path of duty in the discharge of my public trust, I turn to the\r\nadministration of my immediate predecessor as the second. It has passed\r\naway in a period of profound peace, how much to the satisfaction of our\r\ncountry and to the honor of our country's name is known to you all. The\r\ngreat features of its policy, in general concurrence with the will of\r\nthe Legislature, have been to cherish peace while preparing for\r\ndefensive war; to yield exact justice to other nations and maintain the\r\nrights of our own; to cherish the principles of freedom and of equal\r\nrights wherever they were proclaimed; to discharge with all possible\r\npromptitude the national debt; to reduce within the narrowest limits of\r\nefficiency the military force; to improve the organization and\r\ndiscipline of the Army; to provide and sustain a school of military\r\nscience; to extend equal protection to all the great interests of the\r\nnation; to promote the civilization of the Indian tribes, and to proceed\r\nin the great system of internal improvements within the limits of the\r\nconstitutional power of the Union. Under the pledge of these promises,\r\nmade by that eminent citizen at the time of his first induction to this\r\noffice, in his career of eight years the internal taxes have been\r\nrepealed; sixty millions of the public debt have been discharged;\r\nprovision has been made for the comfort and relief of the aged and\r\nindigent among the surviving warriors of the Revolution; the regular\r\narmed force has been reduced and its constitution revised and perfected;\r\nthe accountability for the expenditure of public moneys has been made\r\nmore effective; the Floridas have been peaceably acquired, and our\r\nboundary has been extended to the Pacific Ocean; the independence of the\r\nsouthern nations of this hemisphere has been recognized, and recommended\r\nby example and by counsel to the potentates of Europe; progress has been\r\nmade in the defense of the country by fortifications and the increase of\r\nthe Navy, toward the effectual suppression of the African traffic in\r\nslaves, in alluring the aboriginal hunters of our land to the\r\ncultivation of the soil and of the mind, in exploring the interior\r\nregions of the Union, and in preparing by scientific researches and\r\nsurveys for the further application of our national resources to the\r\ninternal improvement of our country.\r\n\r\nIn this brief outline of the promise and performance of my immediate\r\npredecessor the line of duty for his successor is clearly delineated. To\r\npursue to their consummation those purposes of improvement in our common\r\ncondition instituted or recommended by him will embrace the whole sphere\r\nof my obligations. To the topic of internal improvement, emphatically\r\nurged by him at his inauguration, I recur with peculiar satisfaction. It\r\nis that from which I am convinced that the unborn millions of our\r\nposterity who are in future ages to people this continent will derive\r\ntheir most fervent gratitude to the founders of the Union; that in which\r\nthe beneficent action of its Government will be most deeply felt and\r\nacknowledged. The magnificence and splendor of their public works are\r\namong the imperishable glories of the ancient republics. The roads and\r\naqueducts of Rome have been the admiration of all after ages, and have\r\nsurvived thousands of years after all her conquests have been swallowed\r\nup in despotism or become the spoil of barbarians. Some diversity of\r\nopinion has prevailed with regard to the powers of Congress for\r\nlegislation upon objects of this nature. The most respectful deference\r\nis due to doubts originating in pure patriotism and sustained by\r\nvenerated authority. But nearly twenty years have passed since the\r\nconstruction of the first national road was commenced. The authority for\r\nits construction was then unquestioned. To how many thousands of our\r\ncountrymen has it proved a benefit? To what single individual has it\r\never proved an injury? Repeated, liberal, and candid discussions in the\r\nLegislature have conciliated the sentiments and approximated the\r\nopinions of enlightened minds upon the question of constitutional power.\r\nI can not but hope that by the same process of friendly, patient, and\r\npersevering deliberation all constitutional objections will ultimately\r\nbe removed. The extent and limitation of the powers of the General\r\nGovernment in relation to this transcendently important interest will be\r\nsettled and acknowledged to the common satisfaction of all, and every\r\nspeculative scruple will be solved by a practical public blessing.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, you are acquainted with the peculiar circumstances of\r\nthe recent election, which have resulted in affording me the opportunity\r\nof addressing you at this time. You have heard the exposition of the\r\nprinciples which will direct me in the fulfillment of the high and\r\nsolemn trust imposed upon me in this station. Less possessed of your\r\nconfidence in advance than any of my predecessors, I am deeply conscious\r\nof the prospect that I shall stand more and oftener in heed of your\r\nindulgence. Intentions upright and pure, a heart devoted to the welfare\r\nof our country, and the unceasing application of all the faculties\r\nallotted to me to her service are all the pledges that I can give for\r\nthe faithful performance of the arduous duties I am to undertake. To the\r\nguidance of the legislative councils, to the assistance of the executive\r\nand subordinate departments, to the friendly cooperation of the\r\nrespective State governments, to the candid and liberal support of the\r\npeople so far as it may be deserved by honest industry and zeal, I shall\r\nlook for whatever success may attend my public service; and knowing that\r\n\"except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain,\" with\r\nfervent supplications for His favor, to His overruling providence I\r\ncommit with humble but fearless confidence my own fate and the future\r\ndestinies of my country.\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 6, 1825_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn taking a general survey of the concerns of our beloved country, with\r\nreference to subjects interesting to the common welfare, the first\r\nsentiment which impresses itself upon the mind is of gratitude to the\r\nOmnipotent Disposer of All Good for the continuance of the signal\r\nblessings of His providence, and especially for that health which to an\r\nunusual extent has prevailed within our borders, and for that abundance\r\nwhich in the vicissitudes of the seasons has been scattered with\r\nprofusion over our land. Nor ought we less to ascribe to Him the glory\r\nthat we are permitted to enjoy the bounties of His hand in peace and\r\ntranquillity--in peace with all the other nations of the earth, in\r\ntranquillity among ourselves. There has, indeed, rarely been a period in\r\nthe history of civilized man in which the general condition of the\r\nChristian nations has been marked so extensively by peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nEurope, with a few partial and unhappy exceptions, has enjoyed ten years\r\nof peace, during which all her Governments, whatever the theory of their\r\nconstitutions may have been, are successively taught to feel that the\r\nend of their institution is the happiness of the people, and that the\r\nexercise of power among men can be justified only by the blessings it\r\nconfers upon those over whom it is extended.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period our intercourse with all those nations has been\r\npacific and friendly; it so continues. Since the close of your last\r\nsession no material variation has occurred in our relations with any one\r\nof them. In the commercial and navigation system of Great Britain\r\nimportant changes of municipal regulation have recently been sanctioned\r\nby acts of Parliament, the effect of which upon the interests of other\r\nnations, and particularly upon ours, has not yet been fully developed.\r\nIn the recent renewal of the diplomatic missions on both sides between\r\nthe two Governments assurances have been given and received of the\r\ncontinuance and increase of the mutual confidence and cordiality by\r\nwhich the adjustment of many points of difference had already been\r\neffected, and which affords the surest pledge for the ultimate\r\nsatisfactory adjustment of those which still remain open or may\r\nhereafter arise.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States in their commercial intercourse with\r\nother nations has always been of the most liberal character. In the\r\nmutual exchange of their respective productions they have abstained\r\naltogether from prohibitions; they have interdicted themselves the power\r\nof laying taxes upon exports, and whenever they have favored their own\r\nshipping by special preferences or exclusive privileges in their own\r\nports it has been only with a view to countervail similar favors and\r\nexclusions granted by the nations with whom we have been engaged in\r\ntraffic to their own people or shipping, and to the disadvantage of\r\nours. Immediately after the close of the last war a proposal was fairly\r\nmade by the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1815, to all the\r\nmaritime nations to lay aside the system of retaliating restrictions and\r\nexclusions, and to place the shipping of both parties to the common\r\ntrade on a footing of equality in respect to the duties of tonnage and\r\nimpost. This offer was partially and successively accepted by Great\r\nBritain, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Hanseatic cities, Prussia,\r\nSardinia, the Duke of Oldenburg, and Russia. It was also adopted, under\r\ncertain modifications, in our late commercial convention with France,\r\nand by the act of Congress of the 8th January, 1824, it has received a\r\nnew confirmation with all the nations who had acceded to it, and has\r\nbeen offered again to all those who are or may hereafter be willing to\r\nabide in reciprocity by it. But all these regulations, whether\r\nestablished by treaty or by municipal enactments, are still subject to\r\none important restriction.\r\n\r\nThe removal of discriminating duties of tonnage and of impost is limited\r\nto articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of the country to\r\nwhich the vessel belongs or to such articles as are most usually first\r\nshipped from her ports. It will deserve the serious consideration of\r\nCongress whether even this remnant of restriction may not be safely\r\nabandoned, and whether the general tender of equal competition made in\r\nthe act of 8th January, 1824, may not be extended to include all\r\narticles of merchandise not prohibited, of what country soever they may\r\nbe the produce or manufacture. Propositions to this effect have already\r\nbeen made to us by more than one European Government, and it is probable\r\nthat if once established by legislation or compact with any\r\ndistinguished maritime state it would recommend itself by the experience\r\nof its advantages to the general accession of all.\r\n\r\nThe convention of commerce and navigation between the United States and\r\nFrance, concluded on the 24th of June, 1822, was, in the understanding\r\nand intent of both parties, as appears upon its face, only a temporary\r\narrangement of the points of difference between them of the most\r\nimmediate and pressing urgency. It was limited in the first instance to\r\ntwo years from the 1st of October, 1822, but with a proviso that it\r\nshould further continue in force till the conclusion of a general and\r\ndefinitive treaty of commerce, unless terminated by a notice, six months\r\nin advance, of either of the parties to the other. Its operation so far\r\nas it extended has been mutually advantageous, and it still continues in\r\nforce by common consent. But it left unadjusted several objects of great\r\ninterest to the citizens and subjects of both countries, and\r\nparticularly a mass of claims to considerable amount of citizens of the\r\nUnited States upon the Government of France of indemnity for property\r\ntaken or destroyed under circumstances of the most aggravated and\r\noutrageous character. In the long period during which continual and\r\nearnest appeals have been made to the equity and magnanimity of France\r\nin behalf of these claims their justice has not been, as it could not\r\nbe, denied. It was hoped that the accession of a new Sovereign to the\r\nthrone would have afforded a favorable opportunity for presenting them\r\nto the consideration of his Government. They have been presented and\r\nurged hitherto without effect. The repeated and earnest representations\r\nof our minister at the Court of France remain as yet even without an\r\nanswer. Were the demands of nations upon the justice of each other\r\nsusceptible of adjudication by the sentence of an impartial tribunal,\r\nthose to which I now refer would long since have been settled and\r\nadequate indemnity would have been obtained. There are large amounts of\r\nsimilar claims upon the Netherlands, Naples and Denmark. For those upon\r\nSpain prior to 1819 indemnity was, after many years of patient\r\nforbearance, obtained; and those upon Sweden have been lately\r\ncompromised by a private settlement, in which the claimants themselves\r\nhave acquiesced. The Governments of Denmark and of Naples have been\r\nrecently reminded of those yet existing against them, nor will any of\r\nthem be forgotten while a hope may be indulged of obtaining justice by\r\nthe means within the constitutional power of the Executive, and without\r\nresorting to those means of self-redress which, as well as the time,\r\ncircumstances, and occasion which may require them, are within the\r\nexclusive competency of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that I am enabled to bear witness to the\r\nliberal spirit with which the Republic of Colombia has made satisfaction\r\nfor well-established claims of a similar character, and among the\r\ndocuments now communicated to Congress will be distinguished a treaty of\r\ncommerce and navigation with that Republic, the ratifications of which\r\nhave been exchanged since the last recess of the Legislature. The\r\nnegotiation of similar treaties with all the independent South American\r\nStates has been contemplated and may yet be accomplished. The basis of\r\nthem all, as proposed by the United States, has been laid in two\r\nprinciples--the one of entire and unqualified reciprocity, the other the\r\nmutual obligation of the parties to place each other permanently upon\r\nthe footing of the most favored nation. These principles are, indeed,\r\nindispensable to the effectual emancipation of the American hemisphere\r\nfrom the thraldom of colonizing monopolies and exclusions, an event\r\nrapidly realizing in the progress of human affairs, and which the\r\nresistance still opposed in certain parts of Europe to the\r\nacknowledgment of the Southern American Republics as independent States\r\nwill, it is believed, contribute more effectually to accomplish. The\r\ntime has been, and that not remote, when some of those States might, in\r\ntheir anxious desire to obtain a nominal recognition, have accepted of a\r\nnominal independence, clogged with burdensome conditions, and exclusive\r\ncommercial privileges granted to the nation from which they have\r\nseparated to the disadvantage of all others. They are all now aware that\r\nsuch concessions to any European nation would be incompatible with that\r\nindependence which they have declared and maintained.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures which have been suggested to them by the new\r\nrelations with one another, resulting from the recent changes in their\r\ncondition, is that of assembling at the Isthmus of Panama a congress, at\r\nwhich each of them should be represented, to deliberate upon objects\r\nimportant to the welfare of all. The Republics of Colombia, of Mexico,\r\nand of Central America have already deputed plenipotentiaries to such a\r\nmeeting, and they have invited the United States to be also represented\r\nthere by their ministers. The invitation has been accepted, and\r\nministers on the part of the United States will be commissioned to\r\nattend at those deliberations, and to take part in them so far as may be\r\ncompatible with that neutrality from which it is neither our intention\r\nnor the desire of the other American States that we should depart.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners under the seventh article of the treaty of Ghent have\r\nso nearly completed their arduous labors that, by the report recently\r\nreceived from the agent on the part of the United States, there is\r\nreason to expect that the commission will be closed at their next\r\nsession, appointed for the 22d of May of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe other commission, appointed to ascertain the indemnities due for\r\nslaves carried away from the United States after the close of the late\r\nwar, have met with some difficulty, which has delayed their progress in\r\nthe inquiry. A reference has been made to the British Government on the\r\nsubject, which, it may be hoped, will tend to hasten the decision of the\r\ncommissioners, or serve as a substitute for it.\r\n\r\nAmong the powers specifically granted to Congress by the Constitution\r\nare those of establishing uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies\r\nthroughout the United States and of providing for organizing, arming,\r\nand disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may\r\nbe employed in the service of the United States. The magnitude and\r\ncomplexity of the interests affected by legislation upon these subjects\r\nmay account for the fact that, long and often as both of them have\r\noccupied the attention and animated the debates of Congress, no systems\r\nhave yet been devised for fulfilling to the satisfaction of the\r\ncommunity the duties prescribed by these grants of power. To conciliate\r\nthe claim of the individual citizen to the enjoyment of personal\r\nliberty, with the effective obligation of private contracts, is the\r\ndifficult problem to be solved by a law of bankruptcy. These are objects\r\nof the deepest interest to society, affecting all that is precious in\r\nthe existence of multitudes of persons, many of them in the classes\r\nessentially dependent and helpless, of the age requiring nurture, and of\r\nthe sex entitled to protection from the free agency of the parent and\r\nthe husband. The organization of the militia is yet more indispensable\r\nto the liberties of the country. It is only by an effective militia that\r\nwe can at once enjoy the repose of peace and bid defiance to foreign\r\naggression; it is by the militia that we are constituted an armed\r\nnation, standing in perpetual panoply of defense in the presence of all\r\nthe other nations of the earth. To this end it would be necessary, if\r\npossible, so to shape its organization as to give it a more united and\r\nactive energy. There are laws for establishing an uniform militia\r\nthroughout the United States and for arming and equipping its whole\r\nbody. But it is a body of dislocated members, without the vigor of unity\r\nand having little of uniformity but the name. To infuse into this most\r\nimportant institution the power of which it is susceptible and to make\r\nit available for the defense of the Union at the shortest notice and at\r\nthe smallest expense possible of time, of life, and of treasure are\r\namong the benefits to be expected from the persevering deliberations of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAmong the unequivocal indications of our national prosperity is the\r\nflourishing state of our finances. The revenues of the present year,\r\nfrom all their principal sources, will exceed the anticipations of the\r\nlast. The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last was a\r\nlittle short of $2,000,000, exclusive of two millions and a half, being\r\nthe moiety of the loan of five millions authorized by the act of 26th of\r\nMay, 1824. The receipts into the Treasury from the 1st of January to the\r\n30th of September, exclusive of the other moiety of the same loan, are\r\nestimated at $16,500,000, and it is expected that those of the current\r\nquarter will exceed $5,000,000, forming an aggregate of receipts of\r\nnearly twenty-two millions, independent of the loan. The expenditures of\r\nthe year will not exceed that sum more than two millions. By those\r\nexpenditures nearly eight millions of the principal of the public debt\r\nhave been discharged. More than a million and a half has been devoted to\r\nthe debt of gratitude to the warriors of the Revolution; a nearly equal\r\nsum to the construction of fortifications and the acquisition of\r\nordnance and other permanent preparations of national defense; half a\r\nmillion to the gradual increase of the Navy; an equal sum for purchases\r\nof territory from the Indians and payment of annuities to them; and\r\nupward of a million for objects of internal improvement authorized by\r\nspecial acts of the last Congress. If we add to these $4,000,000 for\r\npayment of interest upon the public debt, there remains a sum of about\r\nseven millions, which have defrayed the whole expense of the\r\nadministration of Government in its legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary departments, including the support of the military and naval\r\nestablishments and all the occasional contingencies of a government\r\ncoextensive with the Union.\r\n\r\nThe amount of duties secured on merchandise imported since the\r\ncommencement of the year is about twenty-five millions and a half, and\r\nthat which will accrue during the current quarter is estimated at five\r\nmillions and a half; from these thirty-one millions, deducting the\r\ndrawbacks, estimated at less than seven millions, a sum exceeding\r\ntwenty-four millions will constitute the revenue of the year, and will\r\nexceed the whole expenditures of the year. The entire amount of the\r\npublic debt remaining due on the 1st of January next will be short of\r\n$81,000,000.\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress of the 3d of March last a loan of $12,000,000 was\r\nauthorized at 4-1/2 per cent, or an exchange of stock to that amount of\r\n4-1/2 per cent for a stock of 6 per cent, to create a fund for\r\nextinguishing an equal amount of the public debt, bearing an interest of\r\n6 per cent, redeemable in 1826. An account of the measures taken to give\r\neffect to this act will be laid before you by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. As the object which it had in view has been but partially\r\naccomplished, it will be for the consideration of Congress whether the\r\npower with which it clothed the Executive should not be renewed at an\r\nearly day of the present session, and under what modifications.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of the 3d of March last, directing the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to subscribe, in the name and for the use of the United\r\nStates, for 1,500 shares of the capital stock of the Chesapeake and\r\nDelaware Canal Company, has been executed by the actual subscription for\r\nthe amount specified; and such other measures have been adopted by that\r\nofficer, under the act, as the fulfillment of its intentions requires.\r\nThe latest accounts received of this important undertaking authorize the\r\nbelief that it is in successful progress.\r\n\r\nThe payments into the Treasury from the proceeds of the sales of the\r\npublic lands during the present year were estimated at $1,000,000. The\r\nactual receipts of the first two quarters have fallen very little short\r\nof that sum; it is not expected that the second half of the year will be\r\nequally productive, but the income of the year from that source may now\r\nbe safely estimated at a million and a half. The act of Congress of 18th\r\nMay, 1824, to provide for the extinguishment of the debt due to the\r\nUnited States by the purchasers of public lands, was limited in its\r\noperation of relief to the purchaser to the 10th of April last. Its\r\neffect at the end of the quarter during which it expired was to reduce\r\nthat debt from ten to seven millions. By the operation of similar prior\r\nlaws of relief, from and since that of 2d March, 1821, the debt had been\r\nreduced from upward of twenty-two millions to ten. It is exceedingly\r\ndesirable that it should be extinguished altogether; and to facilitate\r\nthat consummation I recommend to Congress the revival for one year more\r\nof the act of 18th May, 1824, with such provisional modification as may\r\nbe necessary to guard the public interests against fraudulent practices\r\nin the resale of the relinquished land. The purchasers of public lands\r\nare among the most useful of our fellow-citizens, and since the system\r\nof sales for cash alone has been introduced great indulgence has been\r\njustly extended to those who had previously purchased upon credit. The\r\ndebt which had been contracted under the credit sales had become\r\nunwieldy, and its extinction was alike advantageous to the purchaser and\r\nto the public. Under the system of sales, matured as it has been by\r\nexperience, and adapted to the exigencies of the times, the lands will\r\ncontinue as they have become, an abundant source of revenue; and when\r\nthe pledge of them to the public creditor shall have been redeemed by\r\nthe entire discharge of the national debt, the swelling tide of wealth\r\nwith which they replenish the common Treasury may be made to reflow in\r\nunfailing streams of improvement from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the various branches of the public service resorting\r\nfrom the Department of War, and their administration during the current\r\nyear, will be exhibited in the report of the Secretary of War and the\r\naccompanying documents herewith communicated. The organization and\r\ndiscipline of the Army are effective and satisfactory. To counteract the\r\nprevalence of desertion among the troops it has been suggested to\r\nwithhold from the men a small portion of their monthly pay until the\r\nperiod of their discharge; and some expedient appears to be necessary to\r\npreserve and maintain among the officers so much of the art of\r\nhorsemanship as could scarcely fail to be found wanting on the possible\r\nsudden eruption of a war, which should take us unprovided with a single\r\ncorps of cavalry. The Military Academy at West Point, under the\r\nrestrictions of a severe but paternal superintendence, recommends itself\r\nmore and more to the patronage of the nation, and the numbers of\r\nmeritorious officers which it forms and introduces to the public service\r\nfurnishes the means of multiplying the undertakings of public\r\nimprovements to which their acquirements at that institution are\r\npeculiarly adapted. The school of artillery practice established at\r\nFortress Monroe is well suited to the same purpose, and may heed the aid\r\nof further legislative provision to the same end. The reports of the\r\nvarious officers at the head of the administrative branches of the\r\nmilitary service, connected with the quartering, clothing, subsistence,\r\nhealth, and pay of the Army, exhibit the assiduous vigilance of those\r\nofficers in the performance of their respective duties, and the faithful\r\naccountability which has pervaded every part of the system.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the numerous tribes of aboriginal natives of this\r\ncountry, scattered over its extensive surface and so dependent even for\r\ntheir existence upon our power, have been during the present year highly\r\ninteresting. An act of Congress of 25th of May, 1824, made an\r\nappropriation to defray the expenses of making treaties of trade and\r\nfriendship with the Indian tribes beyond the Mississippi. An act of 3d\r\nof March, 1825, authorized treaties to be made with the Indians for\r\ntheir consent to the making of a road from the frontier of Missouri to\r\nthat of New Mexico, and another act of the same date provided for\r\ndefraying the expenses of holding treaties with the Sioux, Chippeways,\r\nMenomenees, Sauks, Foxes, etc., for the purpose of establishing\r\nboundaries and promoting peace between said tribes. The first and the\r\nlast objects of these acts have been accomplished, and the second is yet\r\nin a process of execution. The treaties which since the last session of\r\nCongress have been concluded with the several tribes will be laid before\r\nthe Senate for their consideration conformably to the Constitution. They\r\ncomprise large and valuable acquisitions of territory, and they secure\r\nan adjustment of boundaries and give pledges of permanent peace between\r\nseveral tribes which had been long waging bloody wars against each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of February last a treaty was signed at the Indian Springs\r\nbetween commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and\r\ncertain chiefs and individuals of the Creek Nation of Indians, which was\r\nreceived at the seat of Government only a very few days before the close\r\nof the last session of Congress and of the late administration. The\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate was given to it on the 3d of March, too\r\nlate for it to receive the ratification of the then President of the\r\nUnited States; it was ratified on the 7th of March, under the\r\nunsuspecting impression that it had been negotiated in good faith and in\r\nthe confidence inspired by the recommendation of the Senate. The\r\nsubsequent transactions in relation to this treaty will form the subject\r\nof a separate communication.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations made by Congress for public works, as well in the\r\nconstruction of fortifications as for purposes of internal improvement,\r\nso far as they have been expended, have been faithfully applied. Their\r\nprogress has been delayed by the want of suitable officers for\r\nsuperintending them. An increase of both the corps of engineers,\r\nmilitary and topographical, was recommended by my predecessor at the\r\nlast session of Congress. The reasons upon which that recommendation was\r\nfounded subsist in all their force and have acquired additional urgency\r\nsince that time. It may also be expedient to organize the topographical\r\nengineers into a corps similar to the present establishment of the Corps\r\nof Engineers. The Military Academy at West Point will furnish from the\r\ncadets annually graduated there officers well qualified for carrying\r\nthis measure into effect.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Engineers for Internal Improvement, appointed for carrying\r\ninto execution the act of Congress of 30th of April, 1824, \"to procure\r\nthe necessary surveys, plans, and estimates on the subject of roads and\r\ncanals,\" have been actively engaged in that service from the close of\r\nthe last session of Congress. They have completed the surveys necessary\r\nfor ascertaining the practicability of a canal from the Chesapeake Bay\r\nto the Ohio River, and are preparing a full report on that subject,\r\nwhich, when completed, will be laid before you. The same observation is\r\nto be made with regard to the two other objects of national importance\r\nupon which the Board have been occupied, namely, the accomplishment of a\r\nnational road from this city to New Orleans, and the practicability of\r\nuniting the waters of Lake Memphramagog with Connecticut River and the\r\nimprovement of the navigation of that river. The surveys have been made\r\nand are nearly completed. The report may be expected at an early period\r\nduring the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe acts of Congress of the last session relative to the surveying,\r\nmarking, or laying out roads in the Territories of Florida, Arkansas,\r\nand Michigan, from Missouri to Mexico, and for the continuation of the\r\nCumberland road, are, some of them, fully executed, and others in the\r\nprocess of execution. Those for completing or commencing fortifications\r\nhave been delayed only so far as the Corps of Engineers has been\r\ninadequate to furnish officers for the necessary superintendence of the\r\nworks. Under the act confirming the statutes of Virginia and Maryland\r\nincorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, three commissioners\r\non the part of the United States have been appointed for opening books\r\nand receiving subscriptions, in concert with a like number of\r\ncommissioners appointed on the part of each of those States. A meeting\r\nof the commissioners has been postponed, to await the definitive report\r\nof the board of engineers. The light-houses and monuments for the safety\r\nof our commerce and mariners, the works for the security of Plymouth\r\nBeach and for the preservation of the islands in Boston Harbor, have\r\nreceived the attention required by the laws relating to those objects\r\nrespectively. The continuation of the Cumberland road, the most\r\nimportant of them all, after surmounting no inconsiderable difficulty in\r\nfixing upon the direction of the road, has commenced under the most\r\npromising auspices, with the improvements of recent invention in the\r\nmode of construction, and with the advantage of a great reduction in the\r\ncomparative cost of the work.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the laws relating to the Revolutionary pensioners may\r\ndeserve the renewed consideration of Congress. The act of the 18th of\r\nMarch, 1818, while it made provision for many meritorious and indigent\r\ncitizens who had served in the War of Independence, opened a door to\r\nnumerous abuses and impositions. To remedy this the act of 1st May,\r\n1820, exacted proofs of absolute indigence, which many really in want\r\nwere unable and all susceptible of that delicacy which is allied to many\r\nvirtues must be deeply reluctant to give. The result has been that some\r\namong the least deserving have been retained, and some in whom the\r\nrequisites both of worth and want were combined have been stricken from\r\nthe list. As the numbers of these venerable relics of an age gone by\r\ndiminish; as the decays of body, mind, and estate of those that survive\r\nmust in the common course of nature increase, should not a more liberal\r\nportion of indulgence be dealt out to them? May not the want in most\r\ninstances be inferred from the demand when the service can be proved,\r\nand may not the last days of human infirmity be spared the mortification\r\nof purchasing a pittance of relief only by the exposure of its own\r\nnecessities? I submit to Congress the expediency of providing for\r\nindividual cases of this description by special enactment, or of\r\nrevising the act of the 1st of May, 1820, with a view to mitigate the\r\nrigor of its exclusions in favor of persons to whom charity now bestowed\r\ncan scarcely discharge the debt of justice.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the naval force of the Union in actual service has been\r\nchiefly employed on three stations--the Mediterranean, the coasts of\r\nSouth America bordering on the Pacific Ocean, and the West Indies. An\r\noccasional cruiser has been sent to range along the African shores most\r\npolluted by the traffic of slaves; one armed vessel has been stationed\r\non the coast of our eastern boundary, to cruise along the fishing\r\ngrounds in Hudsons Bay and on the coast of Labrador, and the first\r\nservice of a new frigate has been performed in restoring to his native\r\nsoil and domestic enjoyments the veteran hero whose youthful blood and\r\ntreasure had freely flowed in the cause of our country's independence,\r\nand whose whole life has been a series of services and sacrifices to the\r\nimprovement of his fellow-men. The visit of General Lafayette, alike\r\nhonorable to himself and to our country, closed, as it had commenced,\r\nwith the most affecting testimonials of devoted attachment on his part,\r\nand of unbounded gratitude of this people to him in return. It will form\r\nhereafter a pleasing incident in the annals of our Union, giving to real\r\nhistory the intense interest of romance and signally marking the\r\nunpurchasable tribute of a great nation's social affections to the\r\ndisinterested champion of the liberties of human-kind.\r\n\r\nThe constant maintenance of a small squadron in the Mediterranean is a\r\nnecessary substitute for the humiliating alternative of paying tribute\r\nfor the security of our commerce in that sea, and for a precarious\r\npeace, at the mercy of every caprice of four Barbary States, by whom it\r\nwas liable to be violated. An additional motive for keeping a\r\nrespectable force stationed there at this time is found in the maritime\r\nwar raging between the Greeks and the Turks, and in which the neutral\r\nnavigation of this Union is always in danger of outrage and depredation.\r\nA few instances have occurred of such depredations upon our merchant\r\nvessels by privateers or pirates wearing the Grecian flag, but without\r\nreal authority from the Greek or any other Government. The heroic\r\nstruggles of the Greeks themselves, in which our warmest sympathies as\r\nfreemen and Christians have been engaged, have continued to be\r\nmaintained with vicissitudes of success adverse and favorable.\r\n\r\nSimilar motives have rendered expedient the keeping of a like force on\r\nthe coasts of Peru and Chile on the Pacific. The irregular and\r\nconvulsive character of the war upon the shores has been extended to the\r\nconflicts upon the ocean. An active warfare has been kept up for years\r\nwith alternate success, though generally to the advantage of the\r\nAmerican patriots. But their naval forces have not always been under the\r\ncontrol of their own Governments. Blockades, unjustifiable upon any\r\nacknowledged principles of international law, have been proclaimed by\r\nofficers in command, and though disavowed by the supreme authorities,\r\nthe protection of our own commerce against them has been made cause of\r\ncomplaint and erroneous imputations against some of the most gallant\r\nofficers of our Navy. Complaints equally groundless have been made by\r\nthe commanders of the Spanish royal forces in those seas; but the most\r\neffective protection to our commerce has been the flag and the firmness\r\nof our own commanding officers. The cessation of the war by the complete\r\ntriumph of the patriot cause has removed, it is hoped, all cause of\r\ndissension with one party and all vestige of force of the other. But an\r\nunsettled coast of many degrees of latitude forming a part of our own\r\nterritory and a flourishing commerce and fishery extending to the\r\nislands of the Pacific and to China still require that the protecting\r\npower of the Union should be displayed under its flag as well upon the\r\nocean as upon the land.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the West India Squadron have been to carry into execution\r\nthe laws for the suppression of the African slave trade; for the\r\nprotection of our commerce against vessels of piratical character,\r\nthough bearing commissions from either of the belligerent parties; for\r\nits protection against open and unequivocal pirates. These objects\r\nduring the present year have been accomplished more effectually than at\r\nany former period. The African slave trade has long been excluded from\r\nthe use of our flag, and if some few citizens of our country have\r\ncontinued to set the laws of the Union as well as those of nature and\r\nhumanity at defiance by persevering in that abominable traffic, it has\r\nbeen only by sheltering themselves under the banners of other nations\r\nless earnest for the total extinction of the trade than ours. The\r\nirregular privateers have within the last year been in a great measure\r\nbanished from those seas, and the pirates for months past appear to have\r\nbeen almost entirely swept away from the borders and the shores of the\r\ntwo Spanish islands in those regions. The active, persevering, and\r\nunremitted energy of Captain Warrington and of the officers and men\r\nunder his command on that trying and perilous service have been crowned\r\nwith signal success, and are entitled to the approbation of their\r\ncountry. But experience has shown that not even a temporary suspension\r\nor relaxation from assiduity can be indulged on that station without\r\nreproducing piracy and murder in all their horrors; nor is it probable\r\nthat for years to come our immensely valuable commerce in those seas can\r\nnavigate in security without the steady continuance of an armed force\r\ndevoted to its protection.\r\n\r\nIt were, indeed, a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that in the\r\npresent or probable condition of human society a commerce so extensive\r\nand so rich as ours could exist and be pursued in safety without the\r\ncontinual support of a military marine--the only arm by which the power\r\nof this Confederacy can be estimated or felt by foreign nations, and the\r\nonly standing military force which can never be dangerous to our own\r\nliberties at home. A permanent naval peace establishment, therefore,\r\nadapted to our present condition, and adaptable to that gigantic growth\r\nwith which the nation is advancing in its career, is among the subjects\r\nwhich have already occupied the foresight of the last Congress, and\r\nwhich will deserve your serious deliberations. Our Navy, commenced at an\r\nearly period of our present political organization upon a scale\r\ncommensurate with the incipient energies, the scanty resources, and the\r\ncomparative indigence of our infancy, was even then found adequate to\r\ncope with all the powers of Barbary, save the first, and with one of the\r\nprincipal maritime powers of Europe.\r\n\r\nAt a period of further advancement, but with little accession of\r\nstrength, it not only sustained with honor the most unequal of\r\nconflicts, but covered itself and our country with unfading glory. But\r\nit is only since the close of the late war that by the numbers and force\r\nof the ships of which it was composed it could deserve the name of a\r\nnavy. Yet it retains nearly the same organization as when it consisted\r\nonly of five frigates. The rules and regulations by which it is governed\r\nearnestly call for revision, and the want of a naval school of\r\ninstruction, corresponding with the Military Academy at West Point, for\r\nthe formation of scientific and accomplished officers, is felt with\r\ndaily increasing aggravation.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of 26th of May, 1824, authorizing an examination and\r\nsurvey of the harbor of Charleston, in South Carolina, of St. Marys, in\r\nGeorgia, and of the coast of Florida, and for other purposes, has been\r\nexecuted so far as the appropriation would admit. Those of the 3d of\r\nMarch last, authorizing the establishment of a navy-yard and depot on\r\nthe coast of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, and authorizing the\r\nbuilding of ten sloops of war, and for other purposes, are in the course\r\nof execution, for the particulars of which and other objects connected\r\nwith this Department I refer to the report of the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nherewith communicated.\r\n\r\nA report from the Postmaster-General is also submitted, exhibiting the\r\npresent flourishing condition of that Department. For the first time for\r\nmany years the receipts for the year ending on the 1st of July last\r\nexceeded the expenditures during the same period to the amount of more\r\nthan $45,000. Other facts equally creditable to the administration of\r\nthis Department are that in two years from the 1st of July, 1823, an\r\nimprovement of more than $185,000 in its pecuniary affairs has been\r\nrealized; that in the same interval the increase of the transportation\r\nof the mail has exceeded 1,500,000 miles annually, and that 1,040 new\r\npost-offices have been established. It hence appears that under\r\njudicious management the income from this establishment may be relied on\r\nas fully adequate to defray its expenses, and that by the discontinuance\r\nof post-roads altogether unproductive others of more useful character\r\nmay be opened, till the circulation of the mail shall keep pace with the\r\nspread of our population, and the comforts of friendly correspondence,\r\nthe exchanges of internal traffic, and the lights of the periodical\r\npress shall be distributed to the remotest corners of the Union, at a\r\ncharge scarcely perceptible to any individual, and without the cost of a\r\ndollar to the public Treasury.\r\n\r\nUpon this first occasion of addressing the Legislature of the Union,\r\nwith which I have been honored, in presenting to their view the\r\nexecution so far as it has been effected of the measures sanctioned by\r\nthem for promoting the internal improvement of our country, I can not\r\nclose the communication without recommending to their calm and\r\npersevering consideration the general principle in a more enlarged\r\nextent. The great object of the institution of civil government is the\r\nimprovement of the condition of those who are parties to the social\r\ncompact, and no government, in whatever form constituted, can accomplish\r\nthe lawful ends of its institution but in proportion as it improves the\r\ncondition of those over whom it is established. Roads and canals, by\r\nmultiplying and facilitating the communications and intercourse between\r\ndistant regions and multitudes of men, are among the most important\r\nmeans of improvement. But moral, political, intellectual improvement are\r\nduties assigned by the Author of Our existence to social no less than to\r\nindividual man. For the fulfillment of those duties governments are\r\ninvested with power, and to the attainment of the end--the progressive\r\nimprovement of the condition of the governed--the exercise of delegated\r\npowers is a duty as sacred and indispensable as the usurpation of powers\r\nnot granted is criminal and odious. Among the first, perhaps the very\r\nfirst, instrument for the improvement of the condition of men is\r\nknowledge, and to the acquisition of much of the knowledge adapted to\r\nthe wants, the comforts, and enjoyments of human life public\r\ninstitutions and seminaries of learning are essential. So convinced of\r\nthis was the first of my predecessors in this office, now first in the\r\nmemory, as, living, he was first in the hearts, of our countrymen, that\r\nonce and again in his addresses to the Congresses with whom he\r\ncooperated in the public service he earnestly recommended the\r\nestablishment of seminaries of learning, to prepare for all the\r\nemergencies of peace and war--a national university and a military\r\nacademy. With respect to the latter, had he lived to the present day, in\r\nturning his eyes to the institution at West Point he would have enjoyed\r\nthe gratification of his most earnest wishes; but in surveying the city\r\nwhich has been honored with his name he would have seen the spot of\r\nearth which he had destined and bequeathed to the use and benefit of his\r\ncountry as the site for an university still bare and barren.\r\n\r\nIn assuming her station among the civilized nations of the earth it\r\nwould seem that our country had contracted the engagement to contribute\r\nher share of mind, of labor, and of expense to the improvement of those\r\nparts of knowledge which lie beyond the reach of individual acquisition,\r\nand particularly to geographical and astronomical science. Looking back\r\nto the history only of the half century since the declaration of our\r\nindependence, and observing the generous emulation with which the\r\nGovernments of France, Great Britain, and Russia have devoted the\r\ngenius, the intelligence, the treasures of their respective nations to\r\nthe common improvement of the species in these branches of science, is\r\nit not incumbent upon us to inquire whether we are not bound by\r\nobligations of a high and honorable character to contribute our portion\r\nof energy and exertion to the common stock? The voyages of discovery\r\nprosecuted in the course of that time at the expense of those nations\r\nhave not only redounded to their glory, but to the improvement of human\r\nknowledge. We have been partakers of that improvement and owe for it a\r\nsacred debt, not only of gratitude, but of equal or proportional\r\nexertion in the same common cause. Of the cost of these undertakings, if\r\nthe mere expenditures of outfit, equipment, and completion of the\r\nexpeditions were to be considered the only charges, it would be unworthy\r\nof a great and generous nation to take a second thought. One hundred\r\nexpeditions of circumnavigation like those of Cook and La Pérouse would\r\nnot burden the exchequer of the nation fitting them out so much as the\r\nways and means of defraying a single campaign in war. But if we take\r\ninto the account the lives of those benefactors of mankind of which\r\ntheir services in the cause of their species were the purchase, how\r\nshall the cost of those heroic enterprises be estimated, and what\r\ncompensation can be made to them or to their countries for them? Is it\r\nnot by bearing them in affectionate remembrance? Is it not still more by\r\nimitating their example--by enabling countrymen of our own to pursue the\r\nsame career and to hazard their lives in the same cause?\r\n\r\nIn inviting the attention of Congress to the subject of internal\r\nimprovements upon a view thus enlarged it is not my design to recommend\r\nthe equipment of an expedition for circumnavigating the globe for\r\npurposes of scientific research and inquiry. We have objects of useful\r\ninvestigation nearer home, and to which our cares may be more\r\nbeneficially applied. The interior of our own territories has yet been\r\nvery imperfectly explored. Our coasts along many degrees of latitude\r\nupon the shores of the Pacific Ocean, though much frequented by our\r\nspirited commercial navigators, have been barely visited by our public\r\nships. The River of the West, first fully discovered and navigated by a\r\ncountryman of our own, still bears the name of the ship in which he\r\nascended its waters, and claims the protection of our armed national\r\nflag at its mouth. With the establishment of a military post there or at\r\nsome other point of that coast, recommended by my predecessor and\r\nalready matured in the deliberations of the last Congress, I would\r\nsuggest the expediency of connecting the equipment of a public ship for\r\nthe exploration of the whole northwest coast of this continent.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of an uniform standard of weights and measures was one\r\nof the specific objects contemplated in the formation of our\r\nConstitution, and to fix that standard was one of the powers delegated\r\nby express terms in that instrument to Congress. The Governments of\r\nGreat Britain and France have scarcely ceased to be occupied with\r\ninquiries and speculations on the same subject since the existence of\r\nour Constitution, and with them it has expanded into profound,\r\nlaborious, and expensive researches into the figure of the earth and the\r\ncomparative length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in various\r\nlatitudes from the equator to the pole. These researches have resulted\r\nin the composition and publication of several works highly interesting\r\nto the cause of science. The experiments are yet in the process of\r\nperformance. Some of them have recently been made on our own shores,\r\nwithin the walls of one of our own colleges, and partly by one of our\r\nown fellow-citizens. It would be honorable to our country if the sequel\r\nof the same experiments should be countenanced by the patronage of our\r\nGovernment, as they have hitherto been by those of France and Britain.\r\n\r\nConnected with the establishment of an university, or separate from it,\r\nmight be undertaken the erection of an astronomical observatory, with\r\nprovision for the support of an astronomer, to be in constant attendance\r\nof observation upon the phenomena of the heavens, and for the periodical\r\npublication of his observations. It is with no feeling of pride as an\r\nAmerican that the remark may be made that on the comparatively small\r\nterritorial surface of Europe there are existing upward of 130 of these\r\nlight-houses of the skies, while throughout the whole American\r\nhemisphere there is not one. If we reflect a moment upon the discoveries\r\nwhich in the last four centuries have been made in the physical\r\nconstitution of the universe by the means of these buildings and of\r\nobservers stationed in them, shall we doubt of their usefulness to every\r\nnation? And while scarcely a year passes over our heads without bringing\r\nsome new astronomical discovery to light, which we must fain receive at\r\nsecond hand from Europe, are we not cutting ourselves off from the means\r\nof returning light for light while we have neither observatory nor\r\nobserver upon our half of the globe and the earth revolves in perpetual\r\ndarkness to our unsearching eyes?\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 25th of October, 1791, the first President of the United\r\nStates announced to Congress the result of the first enumeration of the\r\ninhabitants of this Union, he informed them that the returns gave the\r\npleasing assurance that the population of the United States bordered on\r\n4,000,000 persons. At the distance of thirty years from that time the\r\nlast enumeration, five years since completed, presented a population\r\nbordering upon 10,000,000. Perhaps of all the evidences of a prosperous\r\nand happy condition of human society the rapidity of the increase of\r\npopulation is the most unequivocal. But the demonstration of our\r\nprosperity rests not alone upon this indication. Our commerce, our\r\nwealth, and the extent of our territories have increased in\r\ncorresponding proportions, and the number of independent communities\r\nassociated in our Federal Union has since that time nearly doubled. The\r\nlegislative representation of the States and people in the two Houses of\r\nCongress has grown with the growth of their constituent bodies. The\r\nHouse, which then consisted of 65 members, now numbers upward of 200.\r\nThe Senate, which consisted of 26 members, has now 48. But the executive\r\nand, still more, the judiciary departments are yet in a great measure\r\nconfined to their primitive organization, and are now not adequate to\r\nthe urgent wants of a still growing community.\r\n\r\nThe naval armaments, which at an early period forced themselves upon the\r\nnecessities of the Union, soon led to the establishment of a Department\r\nof the Navy. But the Departments of Foreign Affairs and of the Interior,\r\nwhich early after the formation of the Government had been united in\r\none, continue so united to this time, to the unquestionable detriment of\r\nthe public service. The multiplication of our relations with the nations\r\nand Governments of the Old World has kept pace with that of our\r\npopulation and commerce, while within the last ten years a new family of\r\nnations in our own hemisphere has arisen among the inhabitants of the\r\nearth, with whom our intercourse, commercial and political, would of\r\nitself furnish occupation to an active and industrious department. The\r\nconstitution of the judiciary, experimental and imperfect as it was even\r\nin the infancy of our existing Government, is yet more inadequate to the\r\nadministration of national justice at our present maturity. Nine years\r\nhave elapsed since a predecessor in this office, now not the last, the\r\ncitizen who, perhaps, of all others throughout the Union contributed\r\nmost to the formation and establishment of our Constitution, in his\r\nvaledictory address to Congress, immediately preceding his retirement\r\nfrom public life, urgently recommended the revision of the judiciary and\r\nthe establishment of an additional executive department. The exigencies\r\nof the public service and its unavoidable deficiencies, as now in\r\nexercise, have added yearly cumulative weight to the considerations\r\npresented by him as persuasive to the measure, and in recommending it to\r\nyour deliberations I am happy to have the influence of his high\r\nauthority in aid of the undoubting convictions of my own experience.\r\n\r\nThe laws relating to the administration of the Patent Office are\r\ndeserving of much consideration and perhaps susceptible of some\r\nimprovement. The grant of power to regulate the action of Congress upon\r\nthis subject has specified both the end to be obtained and the means by\r\nwhich it is to be effected, \"to promote the progress of science and\r\nuseful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the\r\nexclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\" If an\r\nhonest pride might be indulged in the reflection that on the records of\r\nthat office are already found inventions the usefulness of which has\r\nscarcely been transcended in the annals of human ingenuity, would not\r\nits exultation be allayed by the inquiry whether the laws have\r\neffectively insured to the inventors the reward destined to them by the\r\nConstitution--even a limited term of exclusive right to their\r\ndiscoveries?\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of December, 1799, it was resolved by Congress that a marble\r\nmonument should be erected by the United States in the Capitol at the\r\ncity of Washington; that the family of General Washington should be\r\nrequested to permit his body to be deposited under it, and that the\r\nmonument be so designed as to commemorate the great events of his\r\nmilitary and political life. In reminding Congress of this resolution\r\nand that the monument contemplated by it remains yet without execution,\r\nI shall indulge only the remarks that the works at the Capitol are\r\napproaching to completion; that the consent of the family, desired by\r\nthe resolution, was requested and obtained; that a monument has been\r\nrecently erected in this city over the remains of another distinguished\r\npatriot of the Revolution, and that a spot has been reserved within the\r\nwalls where you are deliberating for the benefit of this and future\r\nages, in which the mortal remains may be deposited of him whose spirit\r\nhovers over you and listens with delight to every act of the\r\nrepresentatives of his nation which can tend to exalt and adorn his and\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution under which you are assembled is a charter of limited\r\npowers. After full and solemn deliberation upon all or any of the\r\nobjects which, urged by an irresistible sense of my own duty, I have\r\nrecommended to your attention should you come to the conclusion that,\r\nhowever desirable in themselves, the enactment of laws for effecting\r\nthem would transcend the powers committed to you by that venerable\r\ninstrument which we are all bound to support, let no consideration\r\ninduce you to assume the exercise of powers not granted to you by the\r\npeople. But if the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases\r\nwhatsoever over the district of Columbia; if the power to lay and\r\ncollect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and\r\nprovide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States;\r\nif the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the\r\nseveral States and with the Indian tribes, to fix the standard of\r\nweights and measures, to establish post-offices and post-roads, to\r\ndeclare war, to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a\r\nnavy, to dispose of and make all heedful rules and regulations\r\nrespecting the territory or other property belonging to the United\r\nStates, and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for\r\ncarrying these powers into execution--if these powers and others\r\nenumerated in the Constitution may be effectually brought into action by\r\nlaws promoting the improvement of agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures, the cultivation and encouragement of the mechanic and of\r\nthe elegant arts, the advancement of literature, and the progress of the\r\nsciences, ornamental and profound, to refrain from exercising them for\r\nthe benefit of the people themselves would be to hide in the earth the\r\ntalent committed to our charge--would be treachery to the most sacred of\r\ntrusts.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of improvement is abroad upon the earth. It stimulates the\r\nhearts and sharpens the faculties not of our fellow-citizens alone, but\r\nof the nations of Europe and of their rulers. While dwelling with\r\npleasing satisfaction upon the superior excellence of our political\r\ninstitutions, let us not be unmindful that liberty is power; that the\r\nnation blessed with the largest portion of liberty must in proportion to\r\nits numbers be the most powerful nation upon earth, and that the tenure\r\nof power by man is, in the moral purposes of his Creator, upon condition\r\nthat it shall be exercised to ends of beneficence, to improve the\r\ncondition of himself and his fellow-men. While foreign nations less\r\nblessed with that freedom which is power than ourselves are advancing\r\nwith gigantic strides in the career of public improvement, were we to\r\nslumber in indolence or fold up our arms and proclaim to the world that\r\nwe are palsied by the will of our constituents, would it not be to cast\r\naway the bounties of Providence and doom ourselves to perpetual\r\ninferiority? In the course of the year now drawing to its close we have\r\nbeheld, under the auspices and at the expense of one State of this\r\nUnion, a new university unfolding its portals to the sons of science and\r\nholding up the torch of human improvement to eyes that seek the light.\r\nWe have seen under the persevering and enlightened enterprise of another\r\nState the waters of our Western lakes mingle with those of the ocean. If\r\nundertakings like these have been accomplished in the compass of a few\r\nyears by the authority of single members of our Confederation, can we,\r\nthe representative authorities of the whole Union, fall behind our\r\nfellow-servants in the exercise of the trust committed to us for the\r\nbenefit of our common sovereign by the accomplishment of works important\r\nto the whole and to which neither the authority nor the resources of any\r\none State can be adequate?\r\n\r\nFinally, fellow-citizens, I shall await with cheering hope and faithful\r\ncooperation the result of your deliberations, assured that, without\r\nencroaching upon the powers reserved to the authorities of the\r\nrespective States or to the people, you will, with a due sense of your\r\nobligations to your country and of the high responsibilities weighing\r\nupon yourselves, give efficacy to the means committed to you for the\r\ncommon good. And may He who searches the hearts of the children of men\r\nprosper your exertions to secure the blessings of peace and promote the\r\nhighest welfare of our country.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 14, 1825_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their consideration and advice with regard\r\nto their ratification, the following treaties:\r\n\r\n1. A treaty between the United States and the Great and Little Osage\r\ntribes of Indians, concluded at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, on\r\nthe 2d day of June last, by William Clark, Superintendent of Indian\r\nAffairs, commissioner on the part of the United States, and the chiefs,\r\nheadmen, and warriors of the same tribes, duly authorized and empowered\r\nby their respective tribes or nations.\r\n\r\n2. A treaty between the United States and the Kanzas Nation of Indians,\r\nconcluded at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, on the 3d day of June\r\nlast, by William Clark, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, commissioner\r\non the part of the United States, and the chiefs, headmen, and warriors\r\nof the said nation, duly authorized and empowered by the same.\r\n\r\n3. A convention between the United States and the Shawnee Nation of\r\nIndians residing within the State of Missouri, signed at St. Louis, in\r\nthe State of Missouri, on the 7th day of November last, by William\r\nClark, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and the chiefs and headmen of\r\nthe said nation, duly authorized and empowered by the same.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 15, 1825_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their consideration in reference\r\nto its ratification, a general convention of peace, amity, commerce, and\r\nnavigation between the United States of America and the Federation of\r\nthe Centre of America, signed at this place on the 5th instant by the\r\nSecretary of State and the minister plenipotentiary from the Republic of\r\nCentral America to the United States.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 26, 1825_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn the message to both Houses of Congress at the commencement of the\r\nsession it was mentioned that the Governments of the Republics of\r\nColombia, of Mexico, and of Central America had severally invited the\r\nGovernment of the United States to be represented at the Congress of\r\nAmerican nations to be assembled at Panama to deliberate upon objects of\r\npeculiar concernment to this hemisphere, and that this invitation had\r\nbeen accepted.\r\n\r\nAlthough this measure was deemed to be within the constitutional\r\ncompetency of the Executive, I have not thought proper to take any step\r\nin it before ascertaining that my opinion of its expediency will concur\r\nwith that of both branches of the Legislature, first, by the decision of\r\nthe Senate upon the nominations to be laid before them, and, secondly,\r\nby the sanction of both Houses to the appropriations, without which it\r\ncan not be carried into effect.\r\n\r\nA report from the Secretary of State and copies of the correspondence\r\nwith the South American Governments on this subject since the invitation\r\ngiven by them are herewith transmitted to the Senate. They will disclose\r\nthe objects of importance which are expected to form a subject of\r\ndiscussion at this meeting, in which interests of high importance to\r\nthis Union are involved. It will be seen that the United States neither\r\nintend nor are expected to take part in any deliberations of a\r\nbelligerent character; that the motive of their attendance is neither to\r\ncontract alliances nor to engage in any undertaking or project importing\r\nhostility to any other nation.\r\n\r\nBut the Southern American nations, in the infancy of their independence,\r\noften find themselves in positions with reference to other countries\r\nwith the principles applicable to which, derivable from the state of\r\nindependence itself, they have not been familiarized by experience. The\r\nresult of this has been that sometimes in their intercourse with the\r\nUnited States they have manifested dispositions to reserve a right of\r\ngranting special favors and privileges to the Spanish nation as the\r\nprice of their recognition. At others they have actually established\r\nduties and impositions operating unfavorably to the United States to the\r\nadvantage of other European powers, and sometimes they have appeared to\r\nconsider that they might interchange among themselves mutual concessions\r\nof exclusive favor, to which neither European powers nor the United\r\nStates should be admitted. In most of these cases their regulations\r\nunfavorable to us have yielded to friendly expostulation and\r\nremonstrance. But it is believed to be of infinite moment that the\r\nprinciples of a liberal commercial intercourse should be exhibited to\r\nthem, and urged with disinterested and friendly persuasion upon them\r\nwhen all assembled for the avowed purpose of consulting together upon\r\nthe establishment of such principles as may have an important bearing\r\nupon their future welfare.\r\n\r\nThe consentaneous adoption of principles of maritime neutrality, and\r\nfavorable to the navigation of peace, and commerce in time of war, will\r\nalso form a subject of consideration to this Congress. The doctrine that\r\nfree ships make free goods and the restrictions of reason upon the\r\nextent of blockades may be established by general agreement with far\r\nmore ease, and perhaps with less danger, by the general engagement to\r\nadhere to them concerted at such a meeting, than by partial treaties or\r\nconventions with each of the nations separately. An agreement between\r\nall the parties represented at the meeting that each will guard by its\r\nown means against the establishment of any future European colony within\r\nits borders may be found advisable. This was more than two years since\r\nannounced by my predecessor to the world as a principle resulting from\r\nthe emancipation of both the American continents. It may be so developed\r\nto the new southern nations that they will all feel it as an essential\r\nappendage to their independence.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another subject upon which, without entering into any\r\ntreaty, the moral influence of the United States may perhaps be exerted\r\nwith beneficial consequences at such a meeting--the advancement of\r\nreligious liberty. Some of the southern nations are even yet so far\r\nunder the dominion of prejudice that they have incorporated with their\r\npolitical constitutions an exclusive church, without toleration of any\r\nother than the dominant sect. The abandonment of this last badge of\r\nreligious bigotry and oppression may be pressed more effectually by the\r\nunited exertions of those who concur in the principles of freedom of\r\nconscience upon those who are yet to be convinced of their justice and\r\nwisdom than by the solitary efforts of a minister to any one of the\r\nseparate Governments.\r\n\r\nThe indirect influence which the United States may exercise upon any\r\nprojects or purposes originating in the war in which the southern\r\nRepublics are still engaged, which might seriously affect the interests\r\nof this Union, and the good offices by which the United States may\r\nultimately contribute to bring that war to a speedier termination,\r\nthough among the motives which have convinced me of the propriety of\r\ncomplying with this invitation, are so far contingent and eventual that\r\nit would be improper to dwell upon them more at large.\r\n\r\nIn fine, a decisive inducement with me for acceding to the measure is to\r\nshow by this token of respect to the southern Republics the interest\r\nthat we take in their welfare and our disposition to comply with their\r\nwishes. Having been the first to recognize their independence, and\r\nsympathized with them so far as was compatible with our neutral duties\r\nin all their struggles and sufferings to acquire it, we have laid the\r\nfoundation of our future intercourse with them in the broadest\r\nprinciples of reciprocity and the most cordial feelings of fraternal\r\nfriendship. To extend those principles to all our commercial relations\r\nwith them and to hand down that friendship to future ages is congenial\r\nto the highest policy of the Union, as it will be to that of all those\r\nnations and their posterity. In the confidence that these sentiments\r\nwill meet the approbation of the Senate, I nominate Richard C.

A treaty concluded on the 16th day of August, 1825, at the Sora\r\nKanzas Creek by the same commissioners on the part of the United States\r\nand certain chiefs and headmen of the Kanzas tribe or nation of Indians\r\non the part of said tribe.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_January 31, 1826_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n18th instant, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, with the\r\ncorrespondence with the British Government, relating to the boundary of\r\nthe United States on the Pacific Ocean, desired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_January 31, 1826_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their consideration and advice\r\nwith regard to its ratification, a treaty concluded by the Secretary of\r\nWar, duly authorized thereto, with the chiefs and headmen of the Creek\r\nNation, deputed by them, and now in this city.\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed upon, and is presented to the consideration of the\r\nSenate as a substitute for the treaty signed at the Indian Springs on\r\nthe 12th of February last. The circumstances under which this received\r\non the 3d of March last your advice and consent to its ratification are\r\nknown to you. It was transmitted to me from the Senate on the 5th of\r\nMarch, and ratified in full confidence yielded to the advice and consent\r\nof the Senate, under a firm belief, founded on the journal of the\r\ncommissioners of the United States and on the express statements in the\r\nletter of one of them of the 16th of February to the then Secretary of\r\nWar, that it had been concluded with a large majority of the chiefs of\r\nthe Creek Nation and with a reasonable prospect of immediate\r\nacquiescence by the remainder.\r\n\r\nThis expectation has not merely been disappointed. The first measures\r\nfor carrying the treaty into execution had scarcely been taken when the\r\ntwo principal chiefs who had signed it fell victims to the exasperation\r\nof the great mass of the nation, and their families and dependents, far\r\nfrom being able to execute the engagements on their part, fled for life,\r\nsafety, and subsistence from the territories which they had assumed to\r\ncede, to our own. Yet, in this fugitive condition, and while subsisting\r\non the bounty of the United States, they have been found advancing\r\npretensions to receive exclusively to themselves the whole of the sums\r\nstipulated by the commissioners of the United States in payment _for\r\nall_ the lands of the Creek Nation which were ceded by the terms of the\r\ntreaty. And they have claimed the stipulation of the eighth article,\r\nthat the United States would \"_protect_ the emigrating party against the\r\nencroachments, hostilities, and impositions of the whites and of all\r\nothers,\" as an engagement by which the United States were bound to\r\nbecome the instruments of their vengeance and to inflict upon the\r\nmajority of the Creek Nation the punishment of Indian retribution to\r\ngratify the vindictive fury of an impotent and helpless minority of\r\ntheir own tribe.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things the question is not whether the treaty of the\r\n12th of February last shall or shall not be executed. So far as the\r\nUnited States were or could be bound by it I have been anxiously\r\ndesirous of carrying it into execution. But, like other treaties, its\r\nfulfillment depends upon the will not of one but of both the parties to\r\nit. The parties on the face of the treaty are the United States and the\r\nCreek Nation, and however desirous one of them may be to give it effect,\r\nthis wish must prove abortive while the other party refuses to perform\r\nits stipulations and disavows its obligations. By the refusal of the\r\nCreek Nation to perform their part of the treaty the United States are\r\nabsolved from all its engagements on their part, and the alternative\r\nleft them is either to resort to measures of war to secure by force the\r\nadvantages stipulated to them in the treaty or to attempt the adjustment\r\nof the interest by a new compact. In the preference dictated by the\r\nnature of our institutions and by the sentiments of justice and humanity\r\nwhich the occasion requires for measures of peace the treaty herewith\r\ntransmitted has been concluded, and is submitted to the decision of the\r\nSenate. After exhausting every effort in our power to obtain the\r\nacquiescence of the Creek Nation to the treaty of the 12th of February,\r\nI entertained for some time the hope that their assent might at least\r\nhave been given to a new treaty, by which all their lands within the\r\nState of Georgia should have been ceded. This has also proved\r\nimpracticable, and although the excepted portion is of comparatively\r\nsmall amount and importance, I have assented to its exception so far as\r\nto place it before the Senate only from a conviction that between it and\r\na resort to the forcible expulsion of the Creeks from their habitations\r\nand lands within the State of Georgia there was no middle term.\r\n\r\nThe deputation with which this treaty has been concluded consists of the\r\nprincipal chiefs of the nation--able not only to negotiate but to carry\r\ninto effect the stipulations to which they have agreed. There is a\r\ndeputation also here from the small party which undertook to contract\r\nfor the whole nation at the treaty of the 12th of February, but the\r\nnumber of which, according to the information collected by General\r\nGaines, does not exceed 400. They represent themselves, indeed, to be\r\nfar more numerous, but whatever their number may be their interests have\r\nbeen provided for in the treaty now submitted. Their subscriptions to it\r\nwould also have been received but for unreasonable pretensions raised by\r\nthem after all the arrangements of the treaty had been agreed upon and\r\nit was actually signed. Whatever their merits may have been in the\r\nfacility with which they ceded all the lands of their nation within the\r\nState of Georgia, their utter inability to perform the engagements which\r\nthey so readily contracted and the exorbitancy of their demands when\r\ncompared with the inefficiency of their own means of performance leave\r\nthem with no claims upon the United States other than of impartial and\r\nrigorous justice.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the impressions under which I ratified the treaty of the\r\n12th of February last, I do not deem it necessary to decide upon the\r\npropriety of the manner in which it was negotiated. Deeply regretting\r\nthe recriminations and recriminations to which these events have given\r\nrise, I believe the public interest will best be consulted by discarding\r\nthem altogether from the discussion of the subject. The great body of\r\nthe Creek Nation inflexibly refuse to acknowledge or to execute that\r\ntreaty. Upon this ground it will be set aside, should the Senate advise\r\nand consent to the ratification of that now communicated, without\r\nlooking back to the means by which the other was effected. And in the\r\nadjustment of the terms of the present treaty I have been peculiarly\r\nanxious to dispense a measure of great liberality to both parties of the\r\nCreek Nation, rather than to extort from them a bargain of which the\r\nadvantages on our part could only be purchased by hardship on theirs.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 1, 1826_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 50th ultimo, I\r\ncommunicate herewith, in confidence, a report[004] from the Secretary of\r\nState, with the documents, containing the information desired by the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 7, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 15th of December\r\nlast, I communicate herewith reports from the Secretaries of the\r\nTreasury and War and from the Commissioner of the General Land Office,\r\nwith documents, relating to the lead mines and salt springs, containing\r\nthe information desired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 14, 1826_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n12th ultimo, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, with the statements relating to naval courts of inquiry and\r\ncourts-martial since the 1st January, 1824, requested by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 15, 1826_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the late\r\nSecretary of War to the late President of the United States, with\r\ndocuments, containing information requested by a resolution of the House\r\nof April 10, 1824, relating to the purchases of real estate in behalf of\r\nthe United States within the territorial limits of any State since the\r\n4th July, 1776.\r\n\r\nThese papers were prepared during the last session of Congress, but by\r\nsome accident were not then communicated to the House.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 16, 1826_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the two resolutions of the Senate of the 15th instant,\r\nmarked executive, and which I have received, I state respectfully that\r\nall the communications from me to the Senate relating to the congress at\r\nPanama have been made, like all other communications upon executive\r\nbusiness, _in confidence_ and most of them in compliance with a\r\nresolution of the Senate requesting them confidentially.

My first and\r\ngreatest inducement was to meet in the spirit of kindness and friendship\r\nan overture made in that spirit by three sister Republics of this\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe great revolution in human affairs which has brought into existence,\r\nnearly at the same time, eight sovereign and independent nations in our\r\nown quarter of the globe has placed the United States in a situation not\r\nless novel and scarcely less interesting than that in which they had\r\nfound themselves by their own transition from a cluster of colonies to a\r\nnation of sovereign States. The deliverance of the Southern American\r\nRepublics from the oppression under which they had been so long\r\nafflicted was hailed with great unanimity by the people of this Union as\r\namong the most auspicious events of the age. On the 4th of May, 1822, an\r\nact of Congress made an appropriation of $100,000 \"for such missions to\r\nthe independent nations on the American continent as the President of\r\nthe United States might deem proper.\" In exercising the authority\r\nrecognized by this act my predecessor, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate appointed successively ministers plenipotentiary\r\nto the Republics of Colombia, Buenos Ayres, Chili, and Mexico. Unwilling\r\nto raise among the fraternity of freedom questions of precedency and\r\netiquette, which even the European monarchs had of late found it\r\nnecessary in a great measure to discard, he dispatched these ministers\r\nto Colombia, Buenos Ayres, and Chili without exacting from those\r\nRepublics, as by the ancient principles of political primogeniture he\r\nmight have done, that the compliment of a plenipotentiary mission should\r\nhave been paid _first_ by them to the United States. The instructions,\r\nprepared under his direction, to Mr. Anderson, the first of our\r\nministers to the southern continent, contain at much length the general\r\nprinciples upon which he thought it desirable that our relations,\r\npolitical and commercial, with these our new neighbors should be\r\nestablished for their benefit and ours and that of the future ages of\r\nour posterity. A copy of so much of these instructions as relates to\r\nthese general subjects is among the papers now transmitted to the House.\r\nSimilar instructions were furnished to the ministers appointed to Buenos\r\nAyres, Chili, and Mexico, and the system of social intercourse which it\r\nwas the purpose of those missions to establish from the first opening of\r\nour diplomatic relations with those rising nations is the most effective\r\nexposition of the principles upon which the invitation to the congress\r\nat Panama has been accepted by me, as well as of the objects of\r\nnegotiation at that meeting, in which, it was that our plenipotentiaries\r\nshould take part.\r\n\r\nThe House will perceive that even at the date of these instructions the\r\nfirst treaties between some of the southern Republics had been\r\nconcluded, by which they had stipulated among themselves this diplomatic\r\nassembly at Panama. And it will be seen with what caution, so far as it\r\nmight concern the policy of the United States, and at the same time with\r\nwhat frankness and good will toward those nations, he gave countenance\r\nto their design of inviting the United States to this high assembly for\r\nconsultation upon _American interests_. It was not considered a\r\nconclusive reason for declining this invitation that the proposal for\r\nassembling such a Congress had not first been made by ourselves. It had\r\nsprung from the urgent, immediate, and momentous common interests of the\r\ngreat communities struggling for independence, and, as it were,\r\nquickening into life. From them the proposition to us appeared\r\nrespectful and friendly; from us to them it could scarcely have been\r\nmade without exposing ourselves to suspicions of purposes of ambition,\r\nif not of domination, more suited to rouse resistance and excite\r\ndistrust than to conciliate favor and friendship. The first and\r\nparamount principle upon which it was deemed wise and just to lay the\r\ncorner stone of all our future relations with them was\r\n_disinterestedness_; the next was cordial good will to them; the third\r\nwas a claim of fair and equal reciprocity. Under these impressions when\r\nthe invitation was formally and earnestly given, had it even been\r\ndoubtful whether _any_ of the objects proposed for consideration and\r\ndiscussion at the Congress were such as that immediate and important\r\ninterests of the United States would be affected by the issue, I should,\r\nnevertheless, have determined so far as it depended upon me to have\r\naccepted the invitation and to have appointed ministers to attend the\r\nmeeting. The proposal itself implied that the Republics by whom it was\r\nmade _believed_ that important interests of ours or of theirs rendered\r\nour attendance there desirable. They had given us notice that in the\r\nnovelty of their situation and in the spirit of deference to our\r\nexperience they would be pleased to have the benefit of our friendly\r\ncounsel. To meet the temper with which this proposal was made with a\r\ncold repulse was not thought congenial to that warm interest in their\r\nwelfare with which the people and Government of the Union had hitherto\r\ngone hand in hand through the whole progress of their revolution. To\r\ninsult them by a refusal of their overture, and then invite them to a\r\nsimilar assembly to be called by ourselves, was an expedient which never\r\npresented itself to the mind. I would have sent ministers to the meeting\r\nhad it been merely to give them such advice as they might have desired,\r\neven with reference to _their own_ interests, not involving ours. I\r\nwould have sent them had it been merely to explain and set forth to them\r\nour reasons for _declining_ any proposal of specific measures to which\r\nthey might desire our concurrence, but which we might deem incompatible\r\nwith our interests or our duties. In the intercourse between nations\r\ntemper is a missionary perhaps more powerful than talent. Nothing was\r\never lost by kind treatment. Nothing can be gained by sullen repulses\r\nand aspiring pretensions.\r\n\r\nBut objects of the highest importance, not only to the future welfare of\r\nthe whole human race, but bearing directly upon the special interests of\r\nthis Union, _will_ engage the deliberations of the congress of Panama\r\nwhether we are represented there or not. Others, if we are represented,\r\nmay be offered by our plenipotentiaries for consideration having in view\r\nboth these great results--our own interests and the improvement of the\r\ncondition of man upon earth. It may be that in the lapse of many\r\ncenturies no other opportunity so favorable will be presented to the\r\nGovernment of the United States to subserve the benevolent purposes of\r\nDivine Providence; to dispense the promised blessings of the Redeemer of\r\nMankind; to promote the prevalence in future ages of peace on earth and\r\ngood will to man, as will now be placed in their power by participating\r\nin the deliberations of this congress.\r\n\r\nAmong the topics enumerated in official papers published by the Republic\r\nof Colombia, and adverted to in the correspondence now communicated to\r\nthe House, as intended to be presented for discussion at Panama, there\r\nis scarcely one in which the _result_ of the meeting will not deeply\r\naffect the interests of the United States. Even those in which the\r\nbelligerent States alone will take an active part will have a powerful\r\neffect upon the state of our relations with the American, and probably\r\nwith the principal European, States. Were it merely that we might be\r\ncorrectly and speedily informed of the proceedings of the congress and\r\nof the progress and issue of their negotiations, I should hold it\r\nadvisable that we should have an accredited agency with them, placed in\r\nsuch confidential relations with the other members as would insure the\r\nauthenticity and the safe and early transmission of its reports. Of the\r\nsame enumerated topics are the preparation of a manifesto setting forth\r\nto the world the justice of their cause and the relations they desire to\r\nhold with other Christian powers, and to form a convention of navigation\r\nand commerce applicable both to the confederated States and to their\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nIt will be within the recollection of the House that immediately after\r\nthe close of the war of our independence a measure closely analogous to\r\nthis congress of Panama was adopted by the Congress of our\r\nConfederation, and for purposes of precisely the same character. Three\r\ncommissioners with plenipotentiary powers were appointed to negotiate\r\ntreaties of amity, navigation, and commerce with all the principal\r\npowers of Europe. They met and resided for that purpose about one year\r\nat Paris, and the only result of their negotiations at that time was the\r\nfirst treaty between the United States and Prussia--memorable in the\r\ndiplomatic annals of the world, and precious as a monument of the\r\nprinciples, in relation to commerce and maritime warfare, with which our\r\ncountry entered upon her career as a member of the great family of\r\nindependent nations. This treaty, prepared in conformity with the\r\ninstructions of the American plenipotentiaries, consecrated three\r\nfundamental principles of the foreign intercourse which the Congress of\r\nthat period were desirous of establishing: First, equal reciprocity and\r\nthe mutual stipulation of the privileges of the most favored nation in\r\nthe commercial exchanges of peace; secondly, the abolition of private\r\nwar upon the ocean, and thirdly, restrictions favorable to neutral\r\ncommerce upon belligerent practices with regard to contraband of war and\r\nblockades. A painful, it may be said a calamitous, experience of more\r\nthan forty years has demonstrated the deep importance of these same\r\nprinciples to the peace and prosperity of this nation and to the welfare\r\nof all maritime States, and has illustrated the profound wisdom with\r\nwhich they were assumed as cardinal points of the policy of the Union.\r\n\r\nAt that time in the infancy of their political existence, under the\r\ninfluence of those principles of liberty and of right so congenial to\r\nthe cause in which they had just fought and triumphed, they were able\r\nbut to obtain the sanction of one great and philosophical, though\r\nabsolute, sovereign in Europe to their liberal and enlightened\r\nprinciples. They could obtain no more. Since then a political hurricane\r\nhas gone over three-fourths of the civilized portions of the earth, the\r\ndesolation of which it may with confidence be expected is passing away,\r\nleaving at least the American atmosphere purified and refreshed. And now\r\nat this propitious moment the new-born nations of this hemisphere,\r\nassembling by their representatives at the isthmus between its two\r\ncontinents to settle the principles of their future international\r\nintercourse with other nations and with us, ask in this great exigency\r\nfor our advice upon those very fundamental maxims which we from our\r\ncradle at first proclaimed and partially succeeded to introduce into the\r\ncode of national law.\r\n\r\nWithout recurring to that total prostration of all neutral and\r\ncommercial rights which marked the progress of the late European wars,\r\nand which finally involved the United States in them, and adverting only\r\nto our political relations with these American nations, it is observable\r\nthat while in all other respects those relations have been uniformly and\r\nwithout exception of the most friendly and mutually satisfactory\r\ncharacter, the only causes of difference and dissension between us and\r\nthem which ever have arisen originated in those never-failing fountains\r\nof discord and irritation--discriminations of commercial favor to other\r\nnations, licentious privateers, and paper blockades. I can not without\r\ndoing injustice to the Republics of Buenos Ayres and Colombia forbear to\r\nacknowledge the candid and conciliatory spirit with which they have\r\nrepeatedly yielded to our friendly representations and remonstrances on\r\nthese subjects--in repealing discriminative laws which operated to our\r\ndisadvantage and in revoking the commissions of their privateers, to\r\nwhich Colombia has added the magnanimity of making reparation for\r\nunlawful captures by some of her cruisers and of assenting in the midst\r\nof war to treaty stipulations favorable to neutral navigation. But the\r\nrecurrence of these occasions of complaint has rendered the renewal of\r\nthe discussions which result in the removal of them necessary, while in\r\nthe meantime injuries are sustained by merchants and other individuals\r\nof the United States which can not be repaired, and the remedy lingers\r\nin overtaking the pernicious operation of the mischief. The settlement\r\nof general principles pervading with equal efficacy all the American\r\nStates can alone put an end to these evils, and can alone be\r\naccomplished at the proposed assembly.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the noblest treaty of peace ever mentioned in history\r\nis that by which the Carthagenians were bound to abolish the practice of\r\nsacrificing their own children _because it was stipulated in favor of\r\nhuman nature_. I can not exaggerate to myself the unfading glory with\r\nwhich these United States will go forth in the memory of future ages if\r\nby their friendly counsel, by their moral influence, by the power of\r\nargument and persuasion alone they can prevail upon the American nations\r\nat Panama to stipulate by general agreement among themselves, and so far\r\nas any of them may be concerned, the perpetual abolition of private war\r\nupon the ocean. And if we can not yet flatter ourselves that this may be\r\naccomplished, as advances toward it the establishment of the principle\r\nthat the friendly flag shall cover the cargo, the curtailment of\r\ncontraband of war, and the proscription of fictitious paper blockades--\r\nengagements which we may reasonably hope will not prove impracticable--\r\nwill, if successfully inculcated, redound proportionally to our honor\r\nand drain the fountain of many a future sanguinary war.\r\n\r\nThe late President of the United States, in his message to Congress of\r\nthe 2d December, 1823, while announcing the negotiation then pending\r\nwith Russia, relating to the northwest coast of this continent, observed\r\nthat the occasion of the discussions to which that incident had given\r\nrise had been taken for asserting as a principle in which the rights and\r\ninterests of the United States were involved that the American\r\ncontinents, by the free and independent condition which they had assumed\r\nand maintained, were thenceforward not to be considered as subjects for\r\nfuture colonization by any European power. The principle had first been\r\nassumed in that negotiation with Russia. It rested upon a course of\r\nreasoning equally simple and conclusive. With the exception of the\r\nexisting European colonies, which it was in nowise intended to disturb,\r\nthe two continents consisted of several sovereign and independent\r\nnations, whose territories covered their whole surface. By this their\r\nindependent condition the United States enjoyed the right of commercial\r\nintercourse with every part of their possessions. To attempt the\r\nestablishment of a colony in those possessions would be to usurp to the\r\nexclusion of others a commercial intercourse which was the common\r\npossession of all. It could not be done without encroaching upon\r\nexisting rights of the United States. The Government of Russia has never\r\ndisputed these positions nor manifested the slightest dissatisfaction at\r\ntheir having been taken. Most of the new American Republics have\r\ndeclared their entire assent to them, and they now propose, among the\r\nsubjects of consultation at Panama, to take into consideration the means\r\nof making effectual the assertion of that principle, as well as the\r\nmeans of resisting interference from abroad with the domestic concerns\r\nof the American Governments.\r\n\r\nIn alluding to these means it would obviously be premature at this time\r\nto anticipate that which is offered merely as matter for consultation,\r\nor to pronounce upon those measures which have been or may be suggested.\r\nThe purpose of this Government is to concur in none which would import\r\nhostility to Europe or justly excite resentment in any of her States.\r\nShould it be deemed advisable to contract any conventional engagement on\r\nthis topic, our views would extend no further than to a mutual pledge of\r\nthe parties to the compact to maintain the principle in application to\r\nits own territory, and to permit no colonial lodgments or establishment\r\nof European jurisdiction upon its own soil; and with respect to the\r\nobtrusive interference from abroad--if its future character may be\r\ninferred from that which has been and perhaps still is exercised in more\r\nthan one of the new States--a joint declaration of its character and\r\nexposure of it to the world may be probably all that the occasion would\r\nrequire. Whether the United States should or should not be parties to\r\nsuch a declaration may justly form a part of the deliberation. That\r\nthere is an evil to be remedied heeds little insight into the secret\r\nhistory of late years to know, and that this remedy may best be\r\nconcerted at the Panama meeting deserves at least the experiment of\r\nconsideration. A concert of measures having reference to the more\r\neffectual abolition of the African slave trade and the consideration of\r\nthe light in which the political condition of the island of Hayti is to\r\nbe regarded are also among the subjects mentioned by the minister from\r\nthe Republic of Colombia as believed to be suitable for deliberation at\r\nthe congress. The failure of the negotiations with that Republic\r\nundertaken during the late administration, for the suppression of that\r\ntrade, in compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives,\r\nindicates the expediency of listening with respectful attention to\r\npropositions which may contribute to the accomplishment of the great end\r\nwhich was the purpose of that resolution, while the result of those\r\nnegotiations will serve as admonition to abstain from pledging this\r\nGovernment to any arrangement which might be expected to fail of\r\nobtaining the advice and consent of the Senate by a constitutional\r\nmajority to its ratification.\r\n\r\nWhether the political condition of the island of Hayti shall be brought\r\nat all into discussion at the meeting may be a question for preliminary\r\nadvisement. There are in the political constitution of Government of\r\nthat people circumstances which have hitherto forbidden the\r\nacknowledgment of them by the Government of the United States as\r\nsovereign and independent. Additional reasons for withholding that\r\nacknowledgment have recently been seen in their acceptance of a nominal\r\nsovereignty by the _grant_ of a foreign prince under conditions\r\nequivalent to the concession by them of exclusive commercial advantages\r\nto one nation, adapted altogether to the state of colonial vassalage and\r\nretaining little of independence but the name. Our plenipotentiaries\r\nwill be instructed to present these views to the assembly at Panama, and\r\nshould they not be concurred in to decline acceding to any arrangement\r\nwhich may be proposed upon different principles.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico is of deeper import\r\nand more immediate bearing upon the present interests and future\r\nprospects of our Union. The correspondence herewith transmitted will\r\nshow how earnestly it has engaged the attention of this Government. The\r\ninvasion of both those islands by the united forces of Mexico and\r\nColombia is avowedly among the objects to be matured by the belligerent\r\nStates at Panama. The convulsions to which, from the peculiar\r\ncomposition of their population, they would be liable in the event of\r\nsuch an invasion, and the danger therefrom resulting of their falling\r\nultimately into the hands of some European power other than Spain, will\r\nnot admit of our looking at the consequences to which the congress at\r\nPanama may lead with indifference. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon\r\nthis topic or to say more than that all our efforts in reference to this\r\ninterest will be to preserve the existing state of things, the\r\ntranquillity of the islands, and the peace and security of their\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the congress of Panama is believed to present a fair\r\noccasion for urging upon all the new nations of the south the just and\r\nliberal principles of religious liberty; not by any interference\r\nwhatever in their internal concerns, but by claiming for our citizens\r\nwhose occupations or interests may call them to occasional residence in\r\ntheir territories the inestimable privilege of worshipping their Creator\r\naccording to the dictates of their own consciences. This privilege,\r\nsanctioned by the customary law of nations and secured by treaty\r\nstipulations in numerous national compacts, secured even to our own\r\ncitizens in the treaties with Colombia and with the Federation of\r\nCentral America, is yet to be obtained in the other South American\r\nStates and Mexico. Existing prejudices are still struggling against it,\r\nwhich may, perhaps, be more successfully combated at this general\r\nmeeting than at the separate seats of Government of each Republic.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely deem it otherwise than superfluous to observe that the\r\nassembly will be in its nature diplomatic and not legislative; that\r\nnothing can be transacted there obligatory upon any one of the States to\r\nbe represented at the meeting, unless with the express concurrence of\r\nits own representatives, nor even then, but subject to the ratification\r\nof its constitutional authority at home. The faith of the United States\r\nto foreign powers can not otherwise be pledged. I shall, indeed, in the\r\nfirst instance, consider the assembly as merely _consultative_; and\r\nalthough the plenipotentiaries of the United States will be empowered to\r\nreceive and refer to the consideration of their Government any\r\nproposition from the other parties to the meeting, they will be\r\nauthorized to conclude nothing unless subject to the definitive sanction\r\nof this Government in all its constitutional forms. It has therefore\r\nseemed to me unnecessary to insist that every object to be discussed at\r\nthe meeting should be specified with the precision of a judicial\r\nsentence or enumerated with the exactness of a mathematical\r\ndemonstration. The purpose of the meeting itself is to deliberate upon\r\nthe great and common _interests_ of several new and neighbouring\r\nnations. If the measure is new and without precedent, so is the\r\nsituation of the parties to it. That the purposes of the meeting are\r\nsomewhat indefinite, far from being an objection to it is among the\r\ncogent reasons for its adoption. It is not the establishment of\r\nprinciples of intercourse with one, but with seven or eight nations at\r\nonce. That before they have had the means of exchanging ideas and\r\ncommunicating with one another in common upon these topics they should\r\nhave definitively settled and arranged them in concert is to require\r\nthat the effect should precede the cause; it is to exact as a\r\npreliminary to the meeting that for the accomplishment of which the\r\nmeeting itself is designed.\r\n\r\nAmong the inquiries which were thought entitled to consideration before\r\nthe determination was taken to accept the invitation was that whether\r\nthe measure might not have a tendency to change the policy, hitherto\r\ninvariably pursued by the United States, of avoiding all entangling\r\nalliances and all unnecessary foreign connections.\r\n\r\nMindful of the advice given by the father of our country in his Farewell\r\nAddress, that the great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign\r\nnations is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as\r\nlittle political connection as possible, and faithfully adhering to the\r\nspirit of that admonition, I can not overlook the reflection that the\r\ncounsel of Washington in that instance, like all the counsels of wisdom,\r\nwas founded upon the circumstances in which our country and the world\r\naround us were situated at the time when it was given; that the reasons\r\nassigned by him for his advice were that Europe had a set of primary\r\ninterests which to us had none or a very remote relation; that hence she\r\nmust be engaged in frequent controversies, the, causes of which were\r\nessentially foreign to our concerns; that our _detached_ and _distant_\r\nsituation invited and enabled us to pursue a different course; that by\r\nour union and rapid growth, with an efficient Government, the period was\r\nnot far distant when we might defy material injury from external\r\nannoyance, when we might take such an attitude as would cause our\r\nneutrality to be respected, and, with reference to belligerent nations,\r\nmight choose peace or war, as our interests, guided by justice, should\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nCompare our situation and the circumstances of that time with those of\r\nthe present day, and what, from the very words of Washington then, would\r\nbe his counsels to his countrymen now? Europe has still her set of\r\nprimary interests, with which we have little or a remote relation. Our\r\ndistant and detached situation with reference to Europe remains the\r\nsame. But we were then the only independent nation of this hemisphere,\r\nand we were surrounded by European colonies, with the greater part of\r\nwhich we had no more intercourse than with the inhabitants of another\r\nplanet. Those colonies have now been transformed into eight independent\r\nnations, extending to our very borders, seven of them Republics like\r\nourselves, with whom we have an immensely growing commercial, and _must_\r\nhave and have already important political, connections; with reference\r\nto whom our situation is neither distant nor detached; whose political\r\nprinciples and systems of government, congenial with our own, must and\r\nwill have an action and counteraction upon us and ours to which we can\r\nnot be indifferent if we would.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of our growth, and the consequent increase of our strength,\r\nhas more than realized the anticipations of this admirable political\r\nlegacy. Thirty years have nearly elapsed since it was written, and in\r\nthe interval our population, our wealth, our territorial extension, our\r\npower--physical and moral--have nearly trebled. Reasoning upon this\r\nstate of things from the sound and judicious principles of Washington,\r\nmust we not say that the period which he predicted as then not far off\r\nhas arrived; that _America_ has a set of primary interests which have\r\nnone or a remote relation to Europe; that the interference of Europe,\r\ntherefore, in those concerns should be spontaneously withheld by her\r\nupon the same principles that we have never interfered with hers, and\r\nthat if she should interfere, as she may, by measures which may have a\r\ngreat and dangerous recoil upon ourselves, we might be called in defense\r\nof our own altars and firesides to take an attitude which would cause\r\nour neutrality to be respected, and choose peace or war, as our\r\ninterest, guided by justice, should counsel.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of this invitation, therefore, far from conflicting with\r\nthe counsel or the policy of Washington, is directly deducible from and\r\nconformable to it. Nor is it less conformable to the views of my\r\nimmediate predecessor as declared in his annual message to Congress of\r\nthe 2d December, 1823, to which I have already adverted, and to an\r\nimportant passage of which I invite the attention of the House:\r\n\r\n    The citizens of the United States (said he) cherish sentiments\r\n    the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their\r\n    fellow-men on that (the European) side of the Atlantic. In the\r\n    wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we\r\n    have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy so\r\n    to do. It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously\r\n    menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our\r\n    defense. With the movements in this hemisphere we are of\r\n    necessity more immediately connected, and by causes which must be\r\n    obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The political\r\n    system of the allied powers is essentially different in this\r\n    respect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that\r\n    which exists in their respective Governments. And to the defense\r\n    of our own, which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood\r\n    and treasure, and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened\r\n    citizens, and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity,\r\n    this whole nation is devoted. We owe it, therefore, to candor and\r\n    to the amicable relations subsisting between the United States\r\n    and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt\r\n    on their part to extend their system to any portion of this\r\n    hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the\r\n    existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have\r\n    not interfered and shall not interfere; but with the Governments\r\n    who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose\r\n    independence we have on great consideration and on just\r\n    principles acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for\r\n    the purposes of oppressing them or controlling in any other\r\n    manner their destiny by any European power in any other light\r\n    than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the\r\n    United States. In the war between those new Governments and Spain\r\n    we declared our neutrality at the time of their recognition, and\r\n    to this we have adhered and shall continue to adhere, provided no\r\n    change shall occur which in the judgment of the competent\r\n    authorities of this Government shall make a corresponding change\r\n    on the part of the United States indispensable to their security.\r\n\r\nTo the question which may be asked, whether this meeting and the\r\nprinciples which may be adjusted and settled by it as rules of\r\nintercourse between the American nations may not give umbrage to the\r\nholy league of European powers or offense to Spain, it is deemed a\r\nsufficient answer that our attendance at Panama can give _no just cause_\r\nof umbrage or offense to either, and that the United States will\r\nstipulate nothing there which can give such cause. Here the right of\r\ninquiry into our purposes and measures must stop. The holy league of\r\nEurope itself was formed without inquiring of the United States whether\r\nit would or would not give umbrage to them. The fear of giving umbrage\r\nto the holy league of Europe was urged as a motive for denying to the\r\nAmerican nations the acknowledgment of their independence. That it would\r\nbe viewed by Spain as hostility to her was not only urged, but directly\r\ndeclared by herself. The Congress and administration of that day\r\nconsulted their rights and duties, and not their fears. Fully determined\r\nto give no heedless displeasure to any foreign power, the United States\r\ncan estimate the probability of their giving it only by the right which\r\nany foreign state could have to take it from their measures. Neither the\r\nrepresentation of the United States at Panama nor any measure to which\r\ntheir assent may be yielded there will give to the holy league or any of\r\nits members, nor to Spain, the right to take offense; for the rest the\r\nUnited States must still, as heretofore, take counsel from their duties\r\nrather than their fears.\r\n\r\nSuch are the objects in which it is expected that the plenipotentiaries\r\nof the United States, when commissioned to attend the meeting at the\r\nIsthmus, will take part, and such are the motives and purposes with\r\nwhich the invitation of the three Republics was accepted. It was,\r\nhowever, as the House will perceive from the correspondence, accepted\r\nonly upon condition that the nomination of commissioners for the mission\r\nshould receive the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe concurrence of the House to the measure by the appropriations\r\nnecessary for carrying it into effect is alike subject to its free\r\ndetermination and indispensable to the fulfillment of the intention.\r\n\r\nThat the congress at Panama will accomplish all, or even any, of the\r\ntranscendent benefits to the human race which warmed the conceptions of\r\nits first proposer it were perhaps indulging too sanguine a forecast of\r\nevents to promise. It is in its nature a measure speculative and\r\nexperimental. The blessing of Heaven may turn it to the account of human\r\nimprovement; accidents unforeseen and mischances not to be anticipated\r\nmay baffle all its high purposes and disappoint its fairest\r\nexpectations. But the design is great, is benevolent, is humane.\r\n\r\nIt looks to the melioration of the condition of man. It is congenial\r\nwith that spirit which prompted the declaration of our independence,\r\nwhich inspired the preamble of our first treaty with France, which\r\ndictated our first treaty with Prussia and the instructions under which\r\nit was negotiated, which filled the hearts and fired the souls of the\r\nimmortal founders of our Revolution.\r\n\r\nWith this unrestricted exposition of the motives by which I have been\r\ngoverned in this transaction, as well as of the objects to be discussed\r\nand of the ends, if possible, to be attained by our representation at\r\nthe proposed congress, I submit the propriety of an appropriation to the\r\ncandid consideration and enlightened patriotism of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 16, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSome additional documents having relation to the objects of the mission\r\nto the congress at Panama, and received since the communication of those\r\nheretofore sent, are now transmitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n10th instant, requesting information in possession of the Government\r\nrelating to certain resolves of the Congress of the Confederation of the\r\n21st of October, 1780, and the 21st March, 1783, concerning allowances\r\nto the officers of the Revolutionary army, and to the manner of carrying\r\ninto effect those resolves, and other particulars appertaining thereto,\r\nI transmit reports from the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, and\r\nof War, with documents, comprising the information desired by the House.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 22, 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 24, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 14th ultimo, requesting statements of the amount of compensation\r\nallowed to the paymaster and quartermaster of the Marine Corps for\r\nthe two years preceding the 1st of January, 1826, and of other particulars\r\nrelating to the same Corps, I communicate a report from the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, with documents, containing the information desired by the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 24, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n16th ultimo, requesting statements of the net amount of revenue derived\r\nfrom imports and tonnage received by the Treasury from the ports within\r\nthe bay of Delaware, the bay of Chesapeake, the harbor of New York,\r\nand at Boston from the 1st of January, 1790, to the last of December,\r\n1825, and of the amount of expenditures paid from the Treasury for forts,\r\nlight-houses, beacons, and other public works erected to aid commerce\r\nor for the purposes of defense within the said bays and harbors during\r\nthe said time, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, with several documents, containing the information desired by\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 29, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of the 227th instant,\r\nrequesting a copy of such parts of the answer of the Secretary of State\r\nto Mr. Poinsett's letter to Mr. Clay, dated Mexico, 28th September,\r\n1825, No. 22, as relates to the pledge of the United States therein\r\nmentioned; and also requesting me to inform the House whether the United\r\nStates have in any manner made any pledge to the Governments of Mexico\r\nand South America that the United States would not permit the\r\ninterference of any foreign power with the independence or form of\r\ngovernment of these nations, and, if so, when, in what manner, and to\r\nwhat effect; and also to communicate to the House a copy of the\r\ncommunication from our minister at Mexico in which he informed the\r\nGovernment of the United States that the Mexican Government called upon\r\nthis Government to fulfill the memorable pledge of the President of the\r\nUnited States in his message to Congress of December, 1823, I transmit\r\nto the House a report from the Secretary of State, with the documents\r\ncontaining the information desired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 30, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBy the second article of the general convention of peace, amity,\r\nnavigation, and commerce between the United States and the Republic of\r\nColombia, concluded at Bogota on 3d of October, 1824, it was stipulated\r\nthat the parties engaged mutually not to grant any particular favor to\r\nother nations in respect of commerce and navigation which should not\r\nimmediately become common to the other party, who should enjoy the same\r\nfreely if the concession was freely made, or on allowing the same\r\ncompensation if the concession was conditional. And in the third article\r\nof the same convention it was agreed that the citizens of the United\r\nStates might frequent all the coasts and countries of the Republic of\r\nColombia, and reside and trade there in all sorts of produce,\r\nmanufactures, and merchandise, and should pay no other or greater\r\nduties, charges, or fees whatsoever than the most favored nation should\r\nbe obliged to pay, and should enjoy all the rights, privileges, and\r\nexemptions in navigation and commerce which the most favored nations\r\nshould enjoy, submitting themselves, nevertheless, to the laws, decrees,\r\nand usages there established, and to which were submitted the subjects\r\nand citizens of the most favored nations; with a reciprocal stipulation\r\nin favor of the citizens of the Republic of Colombia in the United\r\nStates. Subsequently to the conclusion of this convention a treaty was\r\nnegotiated between the Republic of Colombia and Great Britain, by which\r\nit was stipulated that no other or higher duties on account of tonnage,\r\nlight, or harbor dues should be imposed in the ports of Colombia on\r\nBritish vessels than those payable in the same ports by Colombian\r\nvessels, and that the same duties should be paid on the importation into\r\nthe territories of Colombia of any article the growth, produce, or\r\nmanufacture of His Britannic Majesty's dominions, whether such\r\nimportations should be in Colombian or in British vessels, and that the\r\nsame duties should be paid and the same discount (drawbacks) and\r\nbounties allowed on the exportation of any articles the growth, produce,\r\nor manufacture of Colombia to His Britannic Majesty's dominions, whether\r\nsuch exportations were in Colombian or in British vessels.\r\n\r\nThe minister of the United States to the Republic of Colombia having\r\nclaimed, by virtue of the second and third articles of the convention\r\nbetween the two Republics, that the benefit of these subsequent\r\nstipulations should be alike extended to the citizens of the United\r\nStates upon the condition of reciprocity provided for by the convention,\r\nthe application of those engagements was readily acceded to by the\r\nColombian Government, and a decree was issued by the executive authority\r\nof that Republic on the 30th of January last, a copy and translation of\r\nwhich are herewith communicated, securing to the citizens of the United\r\nStates in the Republic of Colombia the same advantages in regard to\r\ncommerce and navigation which had been conceded to British subjects in\r\nthe Colombian treaty with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt remains for the Government of the United States to secure to the\r\ncitizens of the Republic of Colombia the reciprocal advantages to which\r\nthey are entitled by the terms of the convention, to commence from the\r\n30th of January last, for the accomplishment of which I invite the\r\nfavor-able consideration of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 31, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of the 21st instant,\r\nrequesting information whether any, and what, measures have been taken\r\nto improve the navigation over the sand bars in the Ohio River according\r\nto the provisions of the act of the 24th of May, 1824, to improve the\r\nnavigation of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and also whether the\r\nexperiments mentioned in the proviso to the first section of the said\r\nact have been made, and, if so, what success has attended them, I\r\ntransmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, with documents,\r\ncontaining the information desired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 31, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the Senate herewith a supplementary article to the\r\ntreaty with the chiefs and headmen of the Creek Nation, in behalf of\r\nthat nation, which was transmitted to the Senate on the 31st of January\r\nlast, and which I submit, together with and as a part of that treaty,\r\nfor the constitutional advice of the Senate with regard to its\r\nratification. A report of the Secretary of War accompanies the article,\r\nsetting forth the reasons for which it has been concluded.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 1, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of the 13th ultimo,\r\nrequesting a statement of all the expenditures incident or relating to\r\ninternal improvement for the years 1824 and 1825, I transmit reports\r\nfrom the Secretaries of the Treasury and of War, with documents,\r\ncontaining the statement desired.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 1, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of the 7th ultimo,\r\nrequesting information relative to the execution of an act of Congress\r\nof the 7th May, 1822, to authorize and empower the corporation of the\r\ncity of Washington, in the district of Columbia, to drain the low\r\ngrounds on and near the public reservations, and to improve and ornament\r\ncertain parts of such reservations, I transmit herewith a report from\r\nthe commissioners appointed by the corporation of the city to carry into\r\neffect the provisions of the said act, together with sundry documents,\r\nexhibiting the information desired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 5, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of the 30th ultimo, I\r\ntransmit to the House a report[005] from the Secretary of State, with\r\nthe documents desired by the resolution; and also a copy of the letter\r\nfrom the Secretary of State to Mr. Poinsett acknowledging the receipt of\r\nhis dispatch No. 22, accidentally overlooked in the answer to the\r\nresolution of the House of the 27th ultimo.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 11, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January last I sent to the Senate a nomination of Daniel\r\nBissell to be colonel of the Second Regiment of Artillery, and on the 3d\r\nof February I received from the Secretary of the Senate an attested copy\r\nof their proceedings in relation to that nomination, laid before me by\r\ntheir order, and closing with a resolution in these words:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_. That in the opinion of the Senate Daniel Bissell is entitled\r\nto the place of colonel in the Army of the United States, taking rank as\r\nsuch from the 15th of August, 1812, with the brevet of brigadier-general\r\nfrom the 9th of March, 1814, and that the President of the United States\r\nmay arrange him accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of my own duties I am under the necessity of stating\r\nrespectfully to the Senate--\r\n\r\nFirst. That I can not concur in these opinions.\r\n\r\nSecondly. That the resolution of the Senate, having on its face no\r\nreference either to the nomination or to the office for which it was\r\nmade, leaves me doubtful whether it was intended by the Senate as their\r\ndecision upon the nomination or not. If intended as their decision, it\r\nimports that the Senate do not advise and consent to the appointment of\r\nDaniel Bissell as colonel in the Second Regiment of Artillery. If\r\nintended as a mere expression of their opinions, superseding in their\r\njudgment the necessity of their immediate decision upon the nomination,\r\nit leaves the Senate still in possession of the nomination and free to\r\nact upon it when informed of my inability to carry those opinions into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn this uncertainty I have thought it most respectful to the Senate to\r\nrefer the subject again to them for their consideration. The delay in\r\nthe transmission of this communication is attributable to the earnest\r\ndesire which I have entertained of acceding to the opinions and\r\ncomplying with the wishes of the Senate, and to the long and repeated\r\nreconsideration of my own impressions with the view to make them, if\r\npossible, conform to theirs. A still higher duty now constrains me to\r\ninvite their definitive decision upon the nomination.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 15, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n11th instant, I transmit herewith a report[006] of the Secretary of\r\nState, and documents, containing the information desired by the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 25, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now transmit to both Houses of Congress copies of a treaty with the\r\nCreek Nation of Indians, concluded on the 24th day of January last, with\r\na supplementary article, signed on the 31st of last month, which have\r\nbeen, with the advice and consent of the Senate, duly ratified. I send\r\nat the same time copies of the treaty superseded by them, signed at the\r\nIndian Springs on the 12th of February, 1825. The treaty and\r\nsupplementary article now ratified will require the aid of the\r\nLegislature for carrying them into effect. And I subjoin a letter from\r\nthe Secretary of War, proposing an additional appropriation for the\r\npurpose of facilitating the removal of that portion of the Creek Nation\r\nwhich may be disposed to remove west of the Mississippi, recommending\r\nthe whole subject to the favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 25, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of the 4th of January last,\r\nI now transmit reports from the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury,\r\nand of War, and from the Postmaster-General, with the documents\r\ncontaining the list of appointments of members of Congress and other\r\ninformation relating thereto desired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 28, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their advice concerning its\r\nratification, a general convention of friendship, commerce, and\r\nnavigation between the United States and His Majesty the King of\r\nDenmark, signed by the Secretary of State and the Danish minister on the\r\n26th instant. A copy of the convention and a note from the Secretary of\r\nState, together with Mr. Pedersen's answer, respecting the claims of the\r\ncitizens of the United States upon the Danish Government, are likewise\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 29, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n26th instant, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, with a copy of the opinion of the Attorney-General[007]\r\nreferred to in the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_May 9, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_: In compliance with a resolution of\r\nthe Senate of the 28th ultimo, I transmit herewith a report from the\r\nSecretary of War, with a copy of the proceedings of the recent\r\ncourt-martial for the trial of Colonel Talbot Chambers, and other\r\ndocuments requested by the resolution or relating to the subject of it.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_May 15, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_: In compliance with a resolution of\r\nthe Senate of the 23d of March last, requesting information concerning\r\nthe official conduct of the collector and other revenue officers of the\r\nport of Philadelphia, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, with documents, containing the information desired by the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_May 16, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n9th instant, I communicate herewith a report[007a] from the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, with the documents desired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_May 17, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to both Houses of Congress copies of treaties with Indian\r\ntribes which have been, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, duly ratified during the present session of Congress:\r\n\r\n(1) With the Great and Little Osage tribes, concluded June 2, 1825;

also how far, if\r\nat all, the claim of indemnity from the Government of France for the\r\nspoliations aforesaid was affected by the convention entered into\r\nbetween the United States and France on the said 30th of September,\r\n1800, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with the\r\ndocuments desired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjutant-General's Office,\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_July 11, 1826_\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General in Chief has received from the Department of War the\r\nfollowing orders:\r\n\r\nThe President with deep regret announces to the Army that it has pleased\r\nthe Disposer of All Human Events, in whose hands are the issues of life,\r\nto remove from the scene of earthly existence our illustrious and\r\nvenerated fellow-citizen, Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nThis dispensation of Divine Providence, afflicting to us, but the\r\nconsummation of glory to him, occurred on the 4th of the present\r\nmonth--- on the fiftieth anniversary of that Independence the\r\nDeclaration of which, emanating from his mind, at once proclaimed the\r\nbirth of a free nation and offered motives of hope and consolation to\r\nthe whole family of man. Sharing in the grief which every heart must\r\nfeel for so heavy and afflicting a public loss, and desirous to express\r\nhis high sense of the vast debt of gratitude which is due to the\r\nvirtues, talents, and ever-memorable services of the illustrious\r\ndeceased, the President directs that funeral honors be paid to him at\r\nall the military stations, and that the officers of the Army wear crape\r\non the left arm, by way of mourning, for six months.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Brown will give the necessary orders for carrying into\r\neffect the foregoing directions.\r\n\r\nJ. Barbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has become the painful duty of the Secretary of War to announce to\r\nthe Army the death of another distinguished and venerated citizen. John\r\nAdams departed this life on the 4th of this month. Like his compatriot\r\nJefferson, he aided in drawing and ably supporting the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. With a prophetic eye he looked through the impending\r\ndifficulties of the Revolution and foretold with what demonstrations of\r\njoy the anniversary of the birth of American freedom would be hailed. He\r\nwas permitted to behold the verification of his prophecy, and died, as\r\ndid Jefferson, on the day of the jubilee.\r\n\r\nA coincidence of circumstances so wonderful gives confidence to the\r\nbelief that the patriotic efforts of these illustrious men were Heaven\r\ndirected, and furnishes a new seal to the hope that the prosperity of\r\nthese States is under the special protection of a kind Providence.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War directs that the same funeral honors be paid by the\r\nArmy to the memory of the deceased as by the order of the 7th (11th?)\r\ninstant were directed to be paid to Thomas Jefferson, and the same token\r\nof mourning be worn.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Brown is charged with the execution of this order.\r\n\r\nJ. Barbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNever has it fallen to the lot of any commander to announce to an army\r\nsuch an event as now calls forth the mingled grief and astonishment of\r\nthis Republic; never since history first wrote the record of time has\r\none day thus mingled every triumphant with every tender emotion, and\r\nconsecrated a nation's joy by blending it with the most sacred of\r\nsorrows. Yes, soldiers, in one day, almost in the same hour, have two of\r\nthe Founders of the Republic, the Patriarchs of Liberty, closed their\r\nservices to social man, after beholding them crowned with the richest\r\nand most unlimited success. United in their end as they had been in\r\ntheir highest aim, their toils completed, their hopes surpassed, their\r\nhonors full, and the dearest wish of their bosoms gratified in death,\r\nthey closed their eyes in patriot ecstasy, amidst the gratulations and\r\nthanksgivings of a people on all, on every individual, of whom they had\r\nconferred the best of all earthly benefits.\r\n\r\nSuch men heed no trophies; they ask no splendid mausolea. We are their\r\nmonuments; their mausolea is their country, and her growing prosperity\r\nthe amaranthine wreath that Time shall place over their dust. Well may\r\nthe Genius of the Republic mourn. If she turns her eyes in one\r\ndirection, she beholds the hall where Jefferson wrote the charter of her\r\nrights; if in another, she sees the city where Adams kindled the fires\r\nof the Revolution. To no period of our history, to no department of our\r\naffairs, can she direct her views and not meet the multiplied memorials\r\nof her loss and of their glory.\r\n\r\nAt the grave of such men envy dies, and party animosity blushes while\r\nshe quenches her fires. If Science and Philosophy lament their\r\nenthusiastic votary in the halls of Monticello, Philanthropy and\r\nEloquence weep with no less reason in the retirement of Quincy. And when\r\nhereafter the stranger performing his pilgrimage to the land of freedom\r\nshall ask for the monument of Jefferson, his inquiring eye may be\r\ndirected to the dome of that temple of learning, the university of his\r\nnative State--- the last labor of his untiring mind, the latest and the\r\nfavorite gift of a patriot to his country.\r\n\r\nBereaved yet happy America! Mourning yet highly favored country! Too\r\nhappy if every son whose loss shall demand thy tears can thus soothe thy\r\nsorrow by a legacy of fame.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the United States, devoted to the service of the country,\r\nand honoring all who are alike devoted, whether in the Cabinet or the\r\nfield, will feel an honorable and a melancholy pride in obeying this\r\norder. Let the officers, then, wear the badge of mourning, the poor\r\nemblem of a sorrow which words can not express, but which freemen must\r\never feel while contemplating the graves of the venerated Fathers of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nTuesday succeeding the arrival of this order at each military station\r\nshall be a day of rest.\r\n\r\nThe National flag shall wave at half-mast.\r\n\r\nAt early dawn thirteen guns shall be fired, and at intervals of thirty\r\nminutes between the rising and setting sun a single cannon will be\r\ndischarged, and at the close of the day twenty-four rounds.\r\n\r\nBy command of Major-General Brown: R. JONES, _Adjutant-General_\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 5, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of the representatives of our Union in both Houses of the\r\nCongress at this time occurs under circumstances calling for the renewed\r\nhomage of our grateful acknowledgments to the Giver of All Good. With\r\nthe exceptions incidental to the most felicitous condition of human\r\nexistence, we continue to be highly favored in all the elements which\r\ncontribute to individual comfort and to national prosperity. In the\r\nsurvey of our extensive country we have generally to observe abodes of\r\nhealth and regions of plenty. In our civil and political relations we\r\nhave peace without and tranquillity within our borders. We are, as a\r\npeople, increasing with unabated rapidity in population, wealth, and\r\nnational resources, and whatever differences of opinion exist among us\r\nwith regard to the mode and the means by which we shall turn the\r\nbeneficence of Heaven to the improvement of our own condition, there is\r\nyet a spirit animating us all which will not suffer the bounties of\r\nProvidence to be showered upon us in vain, but will receive them with\r\ngrateful hearts, and apply them with unwearied hands to the advancement\r\nof the general good.\r\n\r\nOf the subjects recommended to Congress at their last session, some were\r\nthen definitively acted upon. Others, left unfinished, but partly\r\nmatured, will recur to your attention without heeding a renewal of\r\nnotice from me. The purpose of this communication will be to present to\r\nyour view the general aspect of our public affairs at this moment and\r\nthe measures which have been taken to carry into effect the intentions\r\nof the Legislature as signified by the laws then and heretofore enacted.\r\n\r\nIn our intercourse with the other nations of the earth we have still the\r\nhappiness of enjoying peace and a general good understanding, qualified,\r\nhowever, in several important instances by collisions of interest and by\r\nunsatisfied claims of justice, to the settlement of which the\r\nconstitutional interposition of the legislative authority may become\r\nultimately indispensable.\r\n\r\nBy the decease of the Emperor Alexander, of Russia, which occurred\r\ncontemporaneously with the commencement of the last session of Congress,\r\nthe United States have been deprived of a long-tried, steady, and\r\nfaithful friend. Born to the inheritance of absolute power and trained\r\nin the school of adversity, from which no power on earth, however\r\nabsolute, is exempt, that monarch from his youth had been taught to feel\r\nthe force and value of public opinion and to be sensible that the\r\ninterests of his own Government would best be promoted by a frank and\r\nfriendly intercourse with this Republic, as those of his people would be\r\nadvanced by a liberal commercial intercourse with our country. A candid\r\nand confidential interchange of sentiments between him and the\r\nGovernment of the United States upon the affairs of Southern America\r\ntook place at a period not long preceding his demise, and contributed to\r\nfix that course of policy which left to the other Governments of Europe\r\nno alternative but that of sooner or later recognizing the independence\r\nof our southern neighbors, of which the example had by the United States\r\nalready been set. The ordinary diplomatic communications between his\r\nsuccessor, the Emperor Nicholas, and the United States have suffered\r\nsome interruption by the illness, departure, and subsequent decease of\r\nhis minister residing here, who enjoyed, as he merited, the entire\r\nconfidence of his new sovereign, as he had eminently responded to that\r\nof his predecessor. But we have had the most satisfactory assurances\r\nthat the sentiments of the reigning Emperor toward the United States are\r\naltogether conformable to those which had so long and constantly\r\nanimated his imperial brother, and we have reason to hope that they will\r\nserve to cement that harmony and good understanding between the two\r\nnations which, founded in congenial interests, can not but result in the\r\nadvancement of the welfare and prosperity of both.\r\n\r\nOur relations of commerce and navigation with France are, by the\r\noperation of the convention of 24th of June, 1822, with that nation, in\r\na state of gradual and progressive improvement. Convinced by all our\r\nexperience, no less than by the principles of fair and liberal\r\nreciprocity which the United States have constantly tendered to all the\r\nnations of the earth as the rule of commercial intercourse which they\r\nwould universally prefer, that fair and equal competition is most\r\nconducive to the interests of both parties, the United States in the\r\nnegotiation of that convention earnestly contended for a mutual\r\nrenunciation of discriminating duties and charges in the ports of the\r\ntwo countries. Unable to obtain the immediate recognition of this\r\nprinciple in its full extent, after reducing the duties of\r\ndiscrimination so far as was found attainable it was agreed that at the\r\nexpiration of two years from the 1st of October, 1822, when the\r\nconvention was to go into effect, unless a notice of six months on\r\neither side should be given to the other that the convention itself must\r\nterminate, those duties should be reduced one-fourth, and that this\r\nreduction should be yearly repeated, until all discrimination should\r\ncease, while the convention itself should continue in force. By the\r\neffect of this stipulation three-fourths of the discriminating duties\r\nwhich had been levied by each party upon the vessels of the other in its\r\nports have already been removed; and on the 1st of next October, should\r\nthe convention be still in force, the remaining fourth will be\r\ndiscontinued. French vessels laden with French produce will be received\r\nin our ports on the same terms as our own, and ours in return will enjoy\r\nthe same advantages in the ports of France.\r\n\r\nBy these approximations to an equality of duties and of charges not only\r\nhas the commerce between the two countries prospered, but friendly\r\ndispositions have been on both sides encouraged and promoted. They will\r\ncontinue to be cherished and cultivated on the part of the United\r\nStates. It would have been gratifying to have had it in my power to add\r\nthat the claims upon the justice of the French Government, involving the\r\nproperty and the comfortable subsistence of many of our fellow-citizens,\r\nand which have been so long and so earnestly urged, were in a more\r\npromising train of adjustment than at your last meeting; but their\r\ncondition remains unaltered.\r\n\r\nWith the Government of the Netherlands the mutual abandonment of\r\ndiscriminating duties had been regulated by legislative acts on both\r\nsides. The act of Congress of the 20th of April, 1818, abolished all\r\ndiscriminating duties of impost and tonnage upon the vessels and produce\r\nof the Netherlands in the ports of the United States upon the assurance\r\ngiven by the Government of the Netherlands that all such duties\r\noperating against the shipping and commerce of the United States in that\r\nKingdom had been abolished. These reciprocal regulations had continued\r\nin force several years when the discriminating principle was resumed by\r\nthe Netherlands in a new and indirect form by a bounty of 10 per cent in\r\nthe shape of a return of duties to their national vessels, and in which\r\nthose of the United States are not permitted to participate. By the act\r\nof Congress of 7th January, 1824, all discriminating duties in the\r\nUnited States were again suspended, so far as related to the vessels and\r\nproduce of the Netherlands, so long as the reciprocal exemption should\r\nbe extended to the vessels and produce of the United States in the\r\nNetherlands. But the same act provides that in the event of a\r\nrestoration of discriminating duties to operate against the shipping and\r\ncommerce of the United States in any of the foreign countries referred\r\nto therein the suspension of discriminating duties in favor of the\r\nnavigation of such foreign country should cease and all the provisions\r\nof the acts imposing discriminating foreign tonnage and impost duties in\r\nthe United States should revive and be in full force with regard to that\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence with the Government of the Netherlands upon this\r\nsubject they have contended that the favor shown to their own shipping\r\nby this bounty upon their tonnage is not to be considered as a\r\ndiscriminating duty; but it can not be denied that it produces all the\r\nsame effects. Had the mutual abolition been stipulated by treaty, such a\r\nbounty upon the national vessels could scarcely have been granted\r\nconsistently with good faith. Yet as the act of Congress of 7th January,\r\n1824, has not expressly authorized the Executive authority to determine\r\nwhat shall be considered as a revival of discriminating duties by a\r\nforeign government to the disadvantage of the United States, and as the\r\nretaliatory measure on our part, however just and necessary, may tend\r\nrather to that conflict of legislation which we deprecate than to that\r\nconcert to which we invite all commercial nations, as most conducive to\r\ntheir interest and our own, I have thought it more consistent with the\r\nspirit of our institutions to refer the subject again to the paramount\r\nauthority of the Legislature to decide what measure the emergency may\r\nrequire than abruptly by proclamation to carry into effect the minatory\r\nprovisions of the act of 1824.\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of Congress treaties of amity, navigation, and\r\ncommerce were negotiated and signed at this place with the Government of\r\nDenmark, in Europe, and with the Federation of Central America, in this\r\nhemisphere. These treaties then received the constitutional sanction of\r\nthe Senate, by the advice and consent to their ratification. They were\r\naccordingly ratified on the part of the United States, and during the\r\nrecess of Congress have been also ratified by the other respective\r\ncontracting parties. The ratifications have been exchanged, and they\r\nhave been published by proclamations, copies of which are herewith\r\ncommunicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nThese treaties have established between the contracting parties the\r\nprinciples of equality and reciprocity in their broadest and most\r\nliberal extent, each party admitting the vessels of the other into its\r\nports, laden with cargoes the produce or manufacture of any quarter of\r\nthe globe, upon the payment of the same duties of tonnage and impost\r\nthat are chargeable upon their own. They have further stipulated that\r\nthe parties shall hereafter grant no favor of navigation or commerce to\r\nany other nation which shall not upon the same terms be granted to each\r\nother, and that neither party will impose upon articles of merchandise\r\nthe produce or manufacture of the other any other or higher duties than\r\nupon the like articles being the produce or manufacture of any other\r\ncountry. To these principles there is in the convention with Denmark an\r\nexception with regard to the colonies of that Kingdom in the arctic\r\nseas, but none with regard to her colonies in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last summer the term to which our last commercial\r\ntreaty with Sweden was limited has expired. A continuation of it is in\r\nthe contemplation of the Swedish Government, and is believed to be\r\ndesirable on the part of the United States. It has been proposed by the\r\nKing of Sweden that pending the negotiation of renewal the expired\r\ntreaty should be mutually considered as still in force, a measure which\r\nwill require the sanction of Congress to be carried into effect on our\r\npart, and which I therefore recommend to your consideration.\r\n\r\nWith Prussia, Spain, Portugal, and, in general, all the European powers\r\nbetween whom and the United States relations of friendly intercourse\r\nhave existed their condition has not materially varied since the last\r\nsession of Congress. I regret not to be able to say the same of our\r\ncommercial intercourse with the colonial possessions of Great Britain in\r\nAmerica. Negotiations of the highest importance to our common interests\r\nhave been for several years in discussion between the two Governments,\r\nand on the part of the United States have been invariably pursued in the\r\nspirit of candor and conciliation. Interests of great magnitude and\r\ndelicacy had been adjusted by the conventions of 1815 and 1818, while\r\nthat of 1822, mediated by the late Emperor Alexander, had promised a\r\nsatisfactory compromise of claims which the Government of the United\r\nStates, in justice to the rights of a numerous class of their citizens,\r\nwas bound to sustain. But with regard to the commercial intercourse\r\nbetween the United States and the British colonies in America, it has\r\nbeen hitherto found impracticable to bring the parties to an\r\nunderstanding satisfactory to both. The relative geographical position\r\nand the respective products of nature cultivated by human industry had\r\nconstituted the elements of a commercial intercourse between the United\r\nStates and British America, insular and continental, important to the\r\ninhabitants of both countries; but it had been interdicted by Great\r\nBritain upon a principle heretofore practiced upon by the colonizing\r\nnations of Europe, of holding the trade of their colonies each in\r\nexclusive monopoly to herself. After the termination of the late war\r\nthis interdiction had been revived, and the British Government declined\r\nincluding this portion of our intercourse with her possessions in the\r\nnegotiation of the convention of 1815. The trade was then carried on\r\nexclusively in British vessels till the act of Congress, concerning\r\nnavigation, of 1818 and the supplemental act of 1820 met the interdict\r\nby a corresponding measure on the part of the United States. These\r\nmeasures, not of retaliation, but of necessary self-defense, were soon\r\nsucceeded by an act of Parliament opening certain colonial ports to the\r\nvessels of the United States coming directly from them, and to the\r\nimportation from them of certain articles of our produce burdened with\r\nheavy duties, and excluding some of the most valuable articles of our\r\nexports. The United States opened their ports to British vessels from\r\nthe colonies upon terms as exactly corresponding with those of the act\r\nof Parliament as in the relative position of the parties could be made,\r\nand a negotiation was commenced by mutual consent, with the hope on our\r\npart that a reciprocal spirit of accommodation and a common sentiment of\r\nthe importance of the trade to the interests of the inhabitants of the\r\ntwo countries between whom it must be carried on would ultimately bring\r\nthe parties to a compromise with which both might be satisfied. With\r\nthis view the Government of the United States had determined to\r\nsacrifice something of that entire reciprocity which in all commercial\r\narrangements with foreign powers they are entitled to demand, and to\r\nacquiesce in some inequalities disadvantageous to ourselves rather than\r\nto forego the benefit of a final and permanent adjustment of this\r\ninterest to the satisfaction of Great Britain herself. The negotiation,\r\nrepeatedly suspended by accidental circumstances, was, however, by\r\nmutual agreement and express assent, considered as pending and to be\r\nspeedily resumed. In the meantime another act of Parliament, so doubtful\r\nand ambiguous in its import as to have been misunderstood by the\r\nofficers in the colonies who were to carry it into execution, opens\r\nagain certain colonial ports upon new conditions and terms, with a\r\nthreat to close them against any nation which may not accept those terms\r\nas prescribed by the British Government. This act, passed in July, 1825,\r\nnot communicated to the Government of the United States, not understood\r\nby the British officers of the customs in the colonies where it was to\r\nbe enforced, was nevertheless submitted to the consideration of Congress\r\nat their last session. With the knowledge that a negotiation upon the\r\nsubject had long been in progress and pledges given of its resumption at\r\nan early day, it was deemed expedient to await the result of that\r\nnegotiation rather than to subscribe implicitly to terms the import of\r\nwhich was not clear and which the British authorities themselves in this\r\nhemisphere were not prepared to explain.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the close of the last session of Congress one of our\r\nmost distinguished citizens was dispatched as envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to Great Britain, furnished with instructions\r\nwhich we could not doubt would lead to a conclusion of this\r\nlong-controverted interest upon terms acceptable to Great Britain. Upon\r\nhis arrival, and before he had delivered his letters of credence, he was\r\nmet by an order of the British council excluding from and after the 1st\r\nof December now current the vessels of the United States from all the\r\ncolonial British ports excepting those immediately bordering on our\r\nterritories. In answer to his expostulations upon a measure thus\r\nunexpected he is informed that according to the ancient maxims of policy\r\nof European nations having colonies their trade is an exclusive\r\npossession of the mother country; that all participation in it by other\r\nnations is a boon or favor not forming a subject of negotiation, but to\r\nbe regulated by the legislative acts of the power owning the colony;\r\nthat the British Government therefore declines negotiating concerning\r\nit, and that as the United States did not forthwith accept purely and\r\nsimply the terms offered by the act of Parliament of July, 1825, Great\r\nBritain would not now admit the vessels of the United States even upon\r\nthe terms on which she has opened them to the navigation of other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nWe have been accustomed to consider the trade which we have enjoyed with\r\nthe British colonies rather as an interchange of mutual benefits than as\r\na mere favor received; that under every circumstance we have given an\r\nample equivalent. We have seen every other nation holding colonies\r\nnegotiate with other nations and grant them freely admission to the\r\ncolonies by treaty, and so far are the other colonizing nations of\r\nEurope now from refusing to negotiate for trade with their colonies that\r\nwe ourselves have secured access to the colonies of more than one of\r\nthem by treaty. The refusal, however, of Great Britain to negotiate\r\nleaves to the United States no other alternative than that of regulating\r\nor interdicting altogether the trade on their part, according as either\r\nmeasure may affect the interests of our own country, and with that\r\nexclusive object I would recommend the whole subject to your calm and\r\ncandid deliberations.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that our unavailing exertions to accomplish a cordial good\r\nunderstanding on this interest will not have an unpropitious effect\r\nupon the other great topics of discussion between the two Governments.\r\nOur northeastern and northwestern boundaries are still unadjusted. The\r\ncommissioners under the seventh article of the treaty of Ghent have\r\nnearly come to the close of their labors; nor can we renounce the\r\nexpectation, enfeebled as it is, that they may agree upon their report\r\nto the satisfaction or acquiescence of both parties. The commission for\r\nliquidating the claims for indemnity for slaves carried away after the\r\nclose of the war has been sitting, with doubtful prospects of success.\r\nPropositions of compromise have, however, passed between the two\r\nGovernments, the result of which we flatter ourselves may yet prove\r\nsatisfactory. Our own dispositions and purposes toward Great Britain are\r\nall friendly and conciliatory; nor can we abandon but with strong\r\nreluctance the belief that they will ultimately meet a return, not of\r\nfavors, which we neither ask nor desire, but of equal reciprocity and\r\ngood will.\r\n\r\nWith the American Governments of this hemisphere we continue to maintain\r\nan intercourse altogether friendly, and between their nations and ours\r\nthat commercial interchange of which mutual benefit is the source and\r\nmutual comfort and harmony the result is in a continual state of\r\nimprovement. The war between Spain and them since the total expulsion of\r\nthe Spanish military force from their continental territories has been\r\nlittle more than nominal, and their internal tranquillity, though\r\noccasionally menaced by the agitations which civil wars never fail to\r\nleave behind them, has not been affected by any serious calamity.\r\n\r\nThe congress of ministers from several of those nations which assembled\r\nat Panama, after a short session there, adjourned to meet again at a\r\nmore favorable season in the neighbourhood of Mexico. The decease of one\r\nof our ministers on his way to the Isthmus, and the impediments of the\r\nseason, which delayed the departure of the other, deprived us of the\r\nadvantage of being represented at the first meeting of the congress.\r\nThere is, however, no reason to believe that any of the transactions of\r\nthe congress were of a nature to affect injuriously the interests of the\r\nUnited States or to require the interposition of our ministers had they\r\nbeen present. Their absence has, indeed, deprived us of the opportunity\r\nof possessing precise and authentic information of the treaties which\r\nwere concluded at Panama; and the whole result has confirmed me in the\r\nconviction of the expediency to the United States of being represented\r\nat the congress. The surviving member of the mission, appointed during\r\nyour last session, has accordingly proceeded to his destination, and a\r\nsuccessor to his distinguished and lamented associate will be nominated\r\nto the Senate. A treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce has in the\r\ncourse of the last summer been concluded by our minister plenipotentiary\r\nat Mexico with the united states of that Confederacy, which will also be\r\nlaid before the Senate for their advice with regard to its ratification.\r\n\r\nIn adverting to the present condition of our fiscal concerns and to the\r\nprospects of our revenue the first remark that calls our attention is\r\nthat they are less exuberantly prosperous than they were at the\r\ncorresponding period of the last year. The severe shock so extensively\r\nsustained by the commercial and manufacturing interests in Great Britain\r\nhas not been without a perceptible recoil upon ourselves. A reduced\r\nimportation from abroad is necessarily succeeded by a reduced return to\r\nthe Treasury at home. The net revenue of the present year will not equal\r\nthat of the last, and the receipts of that which is to come will fall\r\nshort of those in the current year. The diminution, however, is in part\r\nattributable to the flourishing condition of some of our domestic\r\nmanufactures, and so far is compensated by an equivalent more profitable\r\nto the nation. It is also highly gratifying to perceive that the\r\ndeficiency in the revenue, while it scarcely exceeds the anticipations\r\nof the last year's estimate from the Treasury, has not interrupted the\r\napplication of more than eleven millions during the present year to the\r\ndischarge of the principal and interest of the debt, nor the reduction\r\nof upward of seven millions of the capital of the debt itself. The\r\nbalance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last was $5,201,650.43;\r\nthe receipts from that time to the 30th of September last were\r\n$19,585,932.50; the receipts of the current quarter, estimated at\r\n$6,000,000. yield, with the sums already received, a revenue of about\r\ntwenty-five millions and a half for the year; the expenditures for the\r\nthree first quarters of the year have amounted to $18,714,226.66; the\r\nexpenditures of the current quarter are expected, including the two\r\nmillions of the principal of the debt to be paid, to balance the\r\nreceipts; so that the expenses of the year, amounting to upward of a\r\nmillion less than its income, will leave a proportionally increased\r\nbalance in the Treasury on the 1st of January, 1827, over that of the\r\n1st of January last; instead of $5,200,000 there will be $6,400,000.\r\n\r\nThe amount of duties secured on merchandise imported from the\r\ncommencement of the year till September 30 is estimated at $21,250,000,\r\nand the amount that will probably accrue during the present quarter is\r\nestimated at $4,250,000, making for the whole year $25,500,000, from\r\nwhich the drawbacks being deducted will leave a clear revenue from the\r\ncustoms receivable in the year 1827 of about $20,400,000, which, with\r\nthe sums to be received from the proceeds of public lands, the bank\r\ndividends, and other incidental receipts, will form an aggregate of\r\nabout $23,000,000, a sum falling short of the whole expenses of the\r\npresent year little more than the portion of those expenditures applied\r\nto the discharge of the public debt beyond the annual appropriation of\r\n$10,000,000 by the act of the 3d March, 1817. At the passage of that act\r\nthe public debt amounted to $123,500,000. On the 1st of January next it\r\nwill be short of $74,000,000. In the lapse of these ten years\r\n$50,000,000 of public debt, with the annual charge of upward of\r\n$3,000,000 of interest upon them, have been extinguished. At the passage\r\nof that act, of the annual appropriation of ten millions seven were\r\nabsorbed in the payment of interest, and not more than three millions\r\nwent to reduce the capital of the debt. Of the same ten millions, at\r\nthis time scarcely four are applicable to the interest, and upward of\r\nsix are effective in melting down the capital. Yet our experience has\r\nproved that a revenue consisting so largely of imposts and tonnage ebbs\r\nand flows to an extraordinary extent, with all the fluctuations incident\r\nto the general commerce of the world. It is within our recollection that\r\neven in the compass of the same last ten years the receipts of the\r\nTreasury were not adequate to the expenditures of the year, and that in\r\ntwo successive years it was found necessary to resort to loans to meet\r\nthe engagements of the nation. The returning tides of the succeeding\r\nyears replenished the public coffers until they have again begun to feel\r\nthe vicissitude of a decline. To produce these alternations of fullness\r\nand exhaustion the relative operation of abundant or unfruitful seasons,\r\nthe regulations of foreign governments, political revolutions, the\r\nprosperous or decaying condition of manufactures, commercial\r\nspeculations, and many other causes, not always to be traced, variously\r\ncombine. We have found the alternate swells and diminutions embracing\r\nperiods of from two to three years. The last period of depression to us\r\nwas from 1819 to 1822. The corresponding revival was from 1823 to the\r\ncommencement of the present year. Still, we have no cause to apprehend a\r\ndepression comparable to that of the former period, or even to\r\nanticipate a deficiency which will intrench upon the ability to apply\r\nthe annual ten millions to the reduction of the debt. It is well for us,\r\nhowever, to be admonished of the necessity of abiding by the maxims of\r\nthe most vigilant economy, and of resorting to all honorable and useful\r\nexpedients for pursuing with steady and inflexible perseverance the\r\ntotal discharge of the debt.\r\n\r\nBesides the seven millions of the loans of 1813 which will have been\r\ndischarged in the course of the present year, there are nine millions\r\nwhich by the terms of the contracts would have been and are now\r\nredeemable. Thirteen millions more of the loan of 1814 will become\r\nredeemable from and after the expiration of the present month, and nine\r\nother millions from and after the close of the ensuing year. They\r\nconstitute a mass of $31,000,000, all bearing an interest of 6 per cent,\r\nmore than twenty millions of which will be immediately redeemable, and\r\nthe rest within little more than a year. Leaving of this amount fifteen\r\nmillions to continue at the interest of 6 per cent, but to be paid off\r\nas far as shall be found practicable in the years 1827 and 1828, there\r\nis scarcely a doubt that the remaining sixteen millions might within a\r\nfew months be discharged by a loan at not exceeding 5 per cent,\r\nredeemable in the years 1829 and 1830. By this operation a sum of nearly\r\nhalf a million of dollars may be saved to the nation, and the discharge\r\nof the whole thirty-one millions within the four years may be greatly\r\nfacilitated if not wholly accomplished.\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress of 3d March, 1835, a loan for the purpose now\r\nreferred to, or a subscription to stock, was authorized, at an interest\r\nnot exceeding 4-1/2 per cent. But at that time so large a portion of the\r\nfloating capital of the country was absorbed in commercial speculations\r\nand so little was left for investment in the stocks that the measure was\r\nbut partially successful. At the last session of Congress the condition\r\nof the funds was still unpropitious to the measure; but the change so\r\nsoon afterwards occurred that, had the authority existed to redeem the\r\nnine millions now redeemable by an exchange of stocks or a loan at 5 per\r\ncent, it is morally certain that it might have been effected, and with\r\nit a yearly saving of $90,000.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the collection of the revenue of imposts, certain\r\noccurrences have within the last year been disclosed in one or two of\r\nour principal ports, which engaged the attention of Congress at their\r\nlast session and may hereafter require further consideration. Until\r\nwithin a very few years the execution of the laws for raising the\r\nrevenue, like that of all our other laws, has been insured more by the\r\nmoral sense of the community than by the rigors of a jealous precaution\r\nor by penal sanctions. Confiding in the exemplary punctuality and\r\nunsullied integrity of our importing merchants, a gradual relaxation\r\nfrom the provisions of the collection laws, a close adherence to which\r\nwould have caused inconvenience and expense to them, had long become\r\nhabitual, and indulgences had been extended universally because they had\r\nnever been abused. It may be worthy of your serious consideration\r\nwhether some further legislative provision may not be necessary to come\r\nin aid of this state of unguarded security.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports herewith communicated of the Secretaries of War and of\r\nthe Navy, with the subsidiary documents annexed to them, will be\r\ndiscovered the present condition and administration of our military\r\nestablishment on the land and on the sea. The organization of the Army\r\nhaving undergone no change since its reduction to the present peace\r\nestablishment in 1821, it remains only to observe that it is yet found\r\nadequate to all the purposes for which a permanent armed force in time\r\nof peace can be heeded or useful. It may be proper to add that, from a\r\ndifference of opinion between the late President of the United States\r\nand the Senate with regard to the construction of the act of Congress of\r\n2d March, 1821, to reduce and fix the military peace establishment of\r\nthe United States, it remains hitherto so far without execution that no\r\ncolonel has been appointed to command one of the regiments of artillery.\r\nA supplementary or explanatory act of the Legislature appears to be the\r\nonly expedient practicable for removing the difficulty of this\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nIn a period of profound peace the conduct of the mere military\r\nestablishment forms but a very inconsiderable portion of the duties\r\ndevolving upon the administration of the Department of War. It will be\r\nseen by the returns from the subordinate departments of the Army that\r\nevery branch of the service is marked with order, regularity, and\r\ndiscipline; that from the commanding general through all the gradations\r\nof superintendence the officers feel themselves to have been citizens\r\nbefore they were soldiers, and that the glory of a republican army must\r\nconsist in the spirit of freedom, by which it is animated, and of\r\npatriotism, by which it is impelled. It may be confidently stated that\r\nthe moral character of the Army is in a state of continual improvement,\r\nand that all the arrangements for the disposal of its parts have a\r\nconstant reference to that end.\r\n\r\nBut to the War Department are attributed other duties, having, indeed,\r\nrelation to a future possible condition of war, but being purely\r\ndefensive, and in their tendency contributing rather to the security and\r\npermanency of peace--the erection of the fortifications provided for by\r\nCongress, and adapted to secure our shores from hostile invasion; the\r\ndistribution of the fund of public gratitude and justice to the\r\npensioners of the Revolutionary war; the maintenance of our relations of\r\npeace and of protection with the Indian tribes, and the internal\r\nimprovements and surveys for the location of roads and canals, which\r\nduring the last three sessions of Congress have engaged so much of their\r\nattention, and may engross so large a share of their future benefactions\r\nto our country.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 30th of April, 1824, suggested and approved by my\r\npredecessor, the sum of $30,000 was appropriated for the purpose of\r\ncausing to be made the necessary surveys, plans, and estimates of the\r\nroutes of such roads and canals as the President of the United States\r\nmight deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of\r\nview, or necessary for the transportation of the public mail. The\r\nsurveys, plans, and estimates for each, when completed, will be laid\r\nbefore Congress.\r\n\r\nIn execution of this act a board of engineers was immediately\r\ninstituted, and have been since most assiduously and constantly occupied\r\nin carrying it into effect. The first object to which their labors were\r\ndirected, by order of the late President, was the examination of the\r\ncountry between the tide waters of the Potomac, the Ohio, and Lake Erie,\r\nto ascertain the practicability of a communication between them, to\r\ndesignate the most suitable route for the same, and to form plans and\r\nestimates in detail of the expense of execution.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of February, 1825, they made their first report, which was\r\nimmediately communicated to Congress, and in which they declared that\r\nhaving maturely considered the circumstances observed by them\r\npersonally, and carefully studied the results of such of the preliminary\r\nsurveys as were then completed, they were decidedly of opinion that the\r\ncommunication was practicable.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress, before the board of engineers were\r\nenabled to make up their second report containing a general plan and\r\npreparatory estimate for the work, the Committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives upon Roads and Canals closed the session with a report\r\nexpressing the hope that the plan and estimate of the board of engineers\r\nmight at this time be prepared, and that the subject be referred to the\r\nearly and favorable consideration of Congress at their present session.\r\nThat expected report of the board of engineers is prepared, and will\r\nforthwith be laid before you.\r\n\r\nUnder the resolution of Congress authorizing the Secretary of War to\r\nhave prepared a complete system of cavalry tactics, and a system of\r\nexercise and instruction of field artillery, for the use of the militia\r\nof the United States, to be reported to Congress at the present session,\r\na board of distinguished officers of the Army and of the militia has\r\nbeen convened, whose report will be submitted to you with that of the\r\nSecretary of War. The occasion was thought favorable for consulting the\r\nsame board, aided by the results of a correspondence with the governors\r\nof the several States and Territories and other citizens of intelligence\r\nand experience, upon the acknowledged defective condition of our militia\r\nsystem, and of the improvements of which it is susceptible. The report\r\nof the board upon this subject is also submitted for your consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the estimates of appropriations for the ensuing year upward of\r\n$5,000,000 will be submitted for the expenditures to be paid from the\r\nDepartment of War. Less than two-fifths of this will be applicable to\r\nthe maintenance and support of the Army. A million and a half, in the\r\nform of pensions, goes as a scarcely adequate tribute to the services\r\nand sacrifices of a former age, and a more than equal sum invested in\r\nfortifications, or for the preparations of internal improvement,\r\nprovides for the quiet, the comfort, and happier existence of the ages\r\nto come. The appropriations to indemnify those unfortunate remnants of\r\nanother race unable alike to share in the enjoyments and to exist in the\r\npresence of civilization, though swelling in recent years to a magnitude\r\nburdensome to the Treasury, are generally not without their equivalents\r\nin profitable value, or serve to discharge the Union from engagements\r\nmore burdensome than debt.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the estimate of appropriations for the Navy Department\r\nwill present an aggregate sum of upward of $3,000,000. About one-half of\r\nthese, however, covers the current expenditures of the Navy in actual\r\nservice, and one-half constitutes a fund of national property, the\r\npledge of our future glory and defense. It was scarcely one short year\r\nafter the close of the late war, and when the burden of its expenses and\r\ncharges was weighing heaviest upon the country, that Congress, by the\r\nact of 29th April, 1816, appropriated $1,000,000 annually for eight\r\nyears to the _gradual increase of the Navy_. At a subsequent period this\r\nannual appropriation was reduced to half a million for six years, of\r\nwhich the present year is the last. A yet more recent appropriation the\r\nlast two years, for building ten sloops of war, has nearly restored the\r\noriginal appropriation of 1816 of a million for every year. The result\r\nis before us all. We have twelve line-of-battle ships, twenty frigates,\r\nand sloops of war in proportion, which, with a few months of\r\npreparation, may present a line of floating fortifications along the\r\nwhole range of our coast ready to meet any invader who might attempt to\r\nset foot upon our shores. Combining with a system of fortifications upon\r\nthe shores themselves, commenced about the same time under the auspices\r\nof my immediate predecessor, and hitherto systematically pursued, it has\r\nplaced in our possession the most effective sinews of war and has left\r\nus at once an example and a lesson from which our own duties may be\r\ninferred. The gradual increase of the Navy was the principle of which\r\nthe act of 29th April, 1816, was the first development. It was the\r\nintroduction of a system to act upon the character and history of our\r\ncountry for an indefinite series of ages. It was a declaration of that\r\nCongress to their constituents and to posterity that it was the destiny\r\nand the duty of these confederated States to become in regular process\r\nof time and by no petty advances a great naval power. That which they\r\nproposed to accomplish in eight years is rather to be considered as the\r\nmeasure of their means than the limitation of their design. They looked\r\nforward for a term of years sufficient for the accomplishment of a\r\ndefinite portion of their purpose, and they left to their successors to\r\nfill up the canvas of which they had traced the large and prophetic\r\noutline. The ships of the line and frigates which they had in\r\ncontemplation will be shortly completed. The time which they had\r\nallotted for the accomplishment of the work has more than elapsed. It\r\nremains for your consideration how their successors may contribute their\r\nportion of toil and of treasure for the benefit of the succeeding age in\r\nthe gradual increase of our Navy. There is perhaps no part of the\r\nexercise of the constitutional powers of the Federal Government which\r\nhas given more general satisfaction to the people of the Union than\r\nthis. The system has not been thus vigorously introduced and hitherto\r\nsustained to be now departed from or abandoned. In continuing to provide\r\nfor the gradual increase of the Navy it may not be necessary or\r\nexpedient to add for the present any more to the number of our ships;\r\nbut should you deem it advisable to continue the yearly appropriation of\r\nhalf a million to the same objects, it may be profitably expended in\r\nproviding a supply of timber to be seasoned and other materials for\r\nfuture use in the construction of docks or in laying the foundations of\r\na school for naval education, as to the wisdom of Congress either of\r\nthose measures may appear to claim the preference.\r\n\r\nOf the small portions of this Navy engaged in actual service during the\r\npeace, squadrons have continued to be maintained in the Pacific Ocean,\r\nin the West India seas, and in the Mediterranean, to which has been\r\nadded a small armament to cruise on the eastern coast of South America.\r\nIn all they have afforded protection to our commerce, have contributed\r\nto make our country advantageously known to foreign nations, have\r\nhonorably employed multitudes of our seamen in the service of their\r\ncountry, and have inured numbers of youths of the rising generation to\r\nlives of manly hardihood and of nautical experience and skill. The\r\npiracies with which the West India seas were for several years infested\r\nhave been totally suppressed, but in the Mediterranean they have\r\nincreased in a manner afflictive to other nations, and but for the\r\ncontinued presence of our squadron would probably have been distressing\r\nto our own. The war which has unfortunately broken out between the\r\nRepublic of Buenos Ayres and the Brazilian Government has given rise to\r\nvery great irregularities among the naval officers of the latter, by\r\nwhom principles in relation to blockades and to neutral navigation have\r\nbeen brought forward to which we can not subscribe and which our own\r\ncommanders have found it necessary to resist. From the friendly\r\ndisposition toward the United States constantly manifested by the\r\nEmperor of Brazil, and the very useful and friendly commercial\r\nintercourse between the United States and his dominions, we have reason\r\nto believe that the just reparation demanded for the injuries sustained\r\nby several of our citizens from some of his officers will not be\r\nwithheld. Abstracts from the recent dispatches of the commanders of our\r\nseveral squadrons are communicated with the report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy to Congress.\r\n\r\nA report from the Postmaster-General is likewise communicated,\r\npresenting in a highly satisfactory manner the result of a vigorous,\r\nefficient, and economical administration of that Department. The revenue\r\nof the office, even of the year including the latter half of 1824 and\r\nthe first half of 1825, had exceeded its expenditures by a sum of more\r\nthan $45,000. That of the succeeding year has been still more\r\nproductive. The increase of the receipts in the year preceding the 1st\r\nof July last over that of the year before exceeds $136,000, and the\r\nexcess of the receipts over the expenditures of the year has swollen\r\nfrom $45,000 to nearly $80,000. During the same period contracts for\r\nadditional transportation of the mail in stages for about 260,000 miles\r\nhave been made, and for 70,000 miles annually on horseback. Seven\r\nhundred and fourteen new post-offices have been established within the\r\nyear, and the increase of revenue within the last three years, as well\r\nas the augmentation of the transportation by mail, is more than equal to\r\nthe whole amount of receipts and of mail conveyance at the commencement\r\nof the present century, when the seat of the General Government was\r\nremoved to this place. When we reflect that the objects effected by the\r\ntransportation of the mail are among the choicest comforts and\r\nenjoyments of social life, it is pleasing to observe that the\r\ndissemination of them to every corner of our country has outstripped in\r\ntheir increase even the rapid march of our population.\r\n\r\nBy the treaties with France and Spain, respectively ceding Louisiana and\r\nthe Floridas to the United States, provision was made for the security\r\nof land titles derived from the Governments of those nations. Some\r\nprogress has been made under the authority of various acts of Congress\r\nin the ascertainment and establishment of those titles, but claims to a\r\nvery large extent remain unadjusted. The public faith no less than the\r\njust rights of individuals and the interest of the community itself\r\nappears to require further provision for the speedy settlement of those\r\nclaims, which I therefore recommend to the care and attention of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the provisions of the act of 20th May last, to\r\nprovide for erecting a penitentiary in the district of Columbia, and for\r\nother purposes, three commissioners were appointed to select a site for\r\nthe erection of a penitentiary for the district, and also a site in the\r\ncounty of Alexandria for a county jail, both of which objects have been\r\neffected. The building of the penitentiary has been commenced, and is in\r\nsuch a degree of forwardness as to promise that it will be completed\r\nbefore the meeting of the next Congress. This consideration points to\r\nthe expediency of maturing at the present session a system for the\r\nregulation and government of the penitentiary, and of defining the class\r\nof offenses which shall be punishable by confinement in this edifice.\r\n\r\nIn closing this communication I trust that it will not be deemed\r\ninappropriate to the occasion and purposes upon which we are here\r\nassembled to indulge a momentary retrospect, combining in a single\r\nglance the period of our origin as a national confederation with that of\r\nour present existence, at the precise interval of half a century from\r\neach other. Since your last meeting at this place the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the day when our independence was declared has been\r\ncelebrated throughout our land, and on that day, while every heart was\r\nbounding with joy and every voice was tuned to gratulation, amid the\r\nblessings of freedom and independence which the sires of a former age\r\nhad handed down to their children, two of the principal actors in that\r\nsolemn scene--the hand that penned the ever-memorable Declaration and\r\nthe voice that sustained it in debate--were by one summons, at the\r\ndistance of 700 miles from each other, called before the Judge of All to\r\naccount for their deeds done upon earth. They departed cheered by the\r\nbenedictions of their country, to whom they left the inheritance of\r\ntheir fame and the memory of their bright example. If we turn our\r\nthoughts to the condition of their country, in the contrast of the first\r\nand last day of that half century, how resplendent and sublime is the\r\ntransition from gloom to glory! Then, glancing through the same lapse of\r\ntime, in the condition of the individuals we see the first day marked\r\nwith the fullness and vigor of youth, in the pledge of their lives,\r\ntheir fortunes, and their sacred honor to the cause of freedom and of\r\nmankind; and on the last, extended on the bed of death, with but sense\r\nand sensibility left to breathe a last aspiration to Heaven of blessing\r\nupon their country, may we not humbly hope that to them too it was a\r\npledge of transition from gloom to glory, and that while their mortal\r\nvestments were sinking into the clod of the valley their emancipated\r\nspirits were ascending to the bosom of their God!\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 7, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now transmit a report from the Secretary of War, with that of the\r\nBoard of Engineers of Internal Improvement, concerning the proposed\r\nChesapeake and Ohio Canal.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 8, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof War, with sundry documents, containing the information requested by a\r\nresolution of the House of the 8th of May last, relating to the lead\r\nmines belonging to the United States in Illinois and Missouri.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 8, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof War, with several documents, containing information required by a\r\nresolution of the House of the 20th of May last, respecting certain\r\nproposed donations of land by Indian tribes to any agent or commissioner\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 12, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their advice with regard to their\r\nratification, the following treaties with Indian tribes:\r\n\r\n1. A treaty made and concluded at the Fond du Lac of Lake Superior,\r\nbetween Lewis Cass and Thomas L. McKenney, commissioners on the part of\r\nthe United States, and the Chippewa tribe of Indians, on the 5th of\r\nAugust, 1826.\r\n\r\n2. A treaty made and concluded near the mouth of the Mississinewa, upon\r\nthe Wabash, in the State of Indiana, between Lewis Cass, James B.

To avoid all delay these documents are now transmitted,\r\nconsisting chiefly of original papers, the return of which is requested.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 22, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n12th instant, requesting information of the measures taken to carry into\r\neffect the act of Congress of 3d March, 1825, directing a road to be\r\nmade from Little Rock to Cantonment Gibson, in the Territory of\r\nArkansas, I transmit a report from the Secretary of War, with a letter\r\nfrom the Quartermaster-General, containing the information desired by\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 22, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the House of Representatives a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, with a copy of the three articles[009] (marked A)\r\nrequested by the resolution of the House of the 19th instant.

These papers were prepared at the close\r\nof the last session of Congress, at too late a period to be then acted\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_January 16, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to both Houses of Congress copies of a convention between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain, signed on the 13th of November last\r\nat London by the respective plenipotentiaries of the two Governments,\r\nfor the final settlement and liquidation of certain claims of indemnity\r\nof citizens of the United States which had arisen under the first\r\narticle of the treaty of Ghent. It having been stipulated by this\r\nconvention that the exchange of the ratifications of the same should be\r\nmade at London, the usual proclamation of it here can only be issued\r\nwhen that event shall have taken place, the notice of which can scarcely\r\nbe expected before the close of the present session of Congress. But it\r\nhas been duly ratified on the part of the United States, and by the\r\nreport of the Secretary of State and the accompanying certificate\r\nherewith also communicated it will be seen that the first half of the\r\nstipulated payment has been made by the minister of His Britannic\r\nMajesty residing here, and has been deposited in the office of the Bank\r\nof the United States at this place to await the disposal of Congress.\r\n\r\nI recommend to their consideration the expediency of such legislative\r\nmeasures as they may deem proper for the distribution of the sum already\r\npaid, and of that hereafter to be received, among the claimants who may\r\nbe found entitled to the indemnity.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_January 17, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 10th of May last, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, with a letter from\r\nthe Director of the Mint, shewing the result of the assay of foreign\r\ncoins and the information otherwise relating thereto desired by the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_January 29, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 23d instant, I\r\ntransmit herewith a report[010] from the Secretary of State, with the\r\naccompanying documents.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_January 29, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe report from the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the\r\naccompanying documents herewith transmitted are laid before the Senate\r\nin compliance with their resolution of the 4th of April last, relating\r\nto the public lands of the United States in the States of Missouri and\r\nIllinois which are unfit for cultivation.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 2, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 25th ultimo,\r\nrelative to the execution of the treaty of the 18th of October, 1820, of\r\nDoaks Stand with the Choctaw tribe of Indians, I transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of War, with a statement from the Office of Indian\r\nAffairs, comprising so far as it is possessed the information desired by\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 3, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of the 9th ultimo, relating to the appointments of chargés\r\nd'affaires and to the commissions and salaries of the ministers and\r\nsecretary to the mission to Panama, I transmit herewith a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, with accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 5, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe report from the Secretary of War and accompanying documents herewith\r\ntransmitted have been prepared in compliance with a resolution of the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the 20th of May last, requesting a statement\r\nof expenditure and other particulars relating to the procurement and\r\nproperties of the patent rifle.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 5, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the consideration of Congress a letter from the agent of the\r\nUnited States with the Creek Indians, who invoke the protection of the\r\nGovernment of the United States in defense of the rights and territory\r\nsecured to that nation by the treaty concluded at Washington, and\r\nratified on the part of the United States on the 22d of April last.\r\n\r\nThe complaint set forth in this letter that surveyors from Georgia have\r\nbeen employed in surveying lands within the Indian Territory, as secured\r\nby that treaty, is authenticated by the information inofficially\r\nreceived from other quarters, and there is reason to believe that one or\r\nmore of the surveyors have been arrested in their progress by the\r\nIndians. Their forbearance, and reliance upon the good faith of the\r\nUnited States, will, it is hoped, avert scenes of violence and blood\r\nwhich there is otherwise too much cause to apprehend will result from\r\nthese proceedings.\r\n\r\nBy the fifth section of the act of Congress of the 30th of March, 1802,\r\nto regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes and to preserve\r\npeace on the frontiers, it is provided that if any citizen of or other\r\nperson resident in the United States shall make a settlement on any\r\nlands belonging or secured or granted by treaty with the United States\r\nto any Indian tribe, or shall survey, or attempt to survey, such lands,\r\nor designate any of the boundaries by marking trees or otherwise, such\r\noffender shall forfeit a sum not exceeding $1,000 and suffer\r\nimprisonment not exceeding twelve months.\r\n\r\nBy the sixteenth and seventeenth sections of the same statute two\r\ndistinct processes are prescribed, by either or both of which the above\r\nenactment may be carried into execution. By the first it is declared to\r\nbe lawful for the military force of the United States to apprehend every\r\nperson found in the Indian country over and beyond the boundary line\r\nbetween the United States and the Indian tribes in violation of any of\r\nthe provisions or regulations of the act, and immediately to convey\r\nthem, in the nearest convenient and safe route, to the civil authority\r\nof the United States in some of the three next adjoining States or\r\ndistricts, to be proceeded against in due course of law.\r\n\r\nBy the second it is directed that if any person charged with the\r\nviolation of any of the provisions or regulations of the act shall be\r\nfound within any of the United States or either of their territorial\r\ndistricts such offender may be there apprehended and brought to trial in\r\nthe same manner as if such crime or offense had been committed within\r\nsuch State or district; and that it shall be the duty of the military\r\nforce of the United States, when called upon by the civil magistrate or\r\nany proper officer or other person duly authorized for that purpose and\r\nhaving a lawful warrant, to aid and assist such magistrate, officer, or\r\nother person so authorized in arresting such offender and committing him\r\nto safe custody for trial according to law.\r\n\r\nThe first of these processes is adapted to the arrest of the trespasser\r\nupon Indian territories on the spot and in the act of committing the\r\noffense; but as it applies the action of the Government of the United\r\nStates to places where the civil process of the law has no authorized\r\ncourse, it is committed entirely to the functions of the military force\r\nto arrest the person of the offender, and after bringing him within the\r\nreach of the jurisdiction of the courts there to deliver him into\r\ncustody for trial. The second makes the violator of the law amenable\r\nonly after his offense has been consummated, and when he has returned\r\nwithin the civil jurisdiction of the Union. This process, in the first\r\ninstance, is merely of a civil character, but may in like manner be\r\nenforced by calling in, if necessary, the aid of the military force.\r\n\r\nEntertaining no doubt that in the present case the resort to either of\r\nthese modes of process, or to both, was within the discretion of the\r\nExecutive authority, and penetrated with the duty of maintaining the\r\nrights of the Indians as secured both by the treaty and the law, I\r\nconcluded, after full deliberation, to have recourse on this occasion,\r\nin the first instance, only to the civil process. Instructions have\r\naccordingly been given by the Secretary of War to the attorney and\r\nmarshal of the United States in the district of Georgia to commence\r\nprosecutions against the surveyors complained of as having violated the\r\nlaw, while orders have at the same time been forwarded to the agent of\r\nthe United States at once to assure the Indians that their rights\r\nfounded upon the treaty and the law are recognized by this Government\r\nand will be faithfully protected, and earnestly to exhort them, by the\r\nforbearance of every act of hostility on their part, to preserve\r\nunimpaired that right to protection secured to them by the sacred pledge\r\nof the good faith of this nation. Copies of these instructions and\r\norders are herewith transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn abstaining at this stage of the proceedings from the application of\r\nany military force I have been governed by considerations which will, I\r\ntrust, meet the concurrence of the Legislature. Among them one of\r\nparamount importance has been that these surveys have been attempted,\r\nand partly effected, under color of legal authority from the State of\r\nGeorgia; that the surveyors are, therefore, not to be viewed in the\r\nlight of individual and solitary transgressors, but as the agents of a\r\nsovereign State, acting in obedience to authority which they believed to\r\nbe binding upon them. Intimations had been given that should they meet\r\nwith interruption they would at all hazards be sustained by the military\r\nforce of the State, in which event, if the military force of the Union\r\nshould have been employed to enforce its violated law, a conflict _must_\r\nhave ensued, which would itself have inflicted a wound upon the Union\r\nand have presented the aspect of one of these confederated States at war\r\nwith the rest. Anxious, above all, to avert this state of things, yet at\r\nthe same time impressed with the deepest conviction of my own duty to\r\ntake care that the laws shall be executed and the faith of the nation\r\npreserved, I have used of the means intrusted to the Executive for that\r\npurpose only those which without resorting to military force may\r\nvindicate the sanctity of the law by the ordinary agency of the judicial\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\nIt ought not, however, to be disguised that the act of the legislature\r\nof Georgia, under the construction given to it by the governor of that\r\nState, and the surveys made or attempted by his authority beyond the\r\nboundary secured by the treaty of Washington of April last to the Creek\r\nIndians, are in direct violation of the supreme law of this land, set\r\nforth in a treaty which has received all the sanctions provided by the\r\nConstitution which we have been sworn to support and maintain.\r\n\r\nHappily distributed as the sovereign powers of the people of this Union\r\nhave been between their General and State Governments, their history has\r\nalready too often presented collisions between these divided authorities\r\nwith regard to the extent of their respective powers. No instance,\r\nhowever, has hitherto occurred in which this collision has been urged\r\ninto a conflict of actual force. No other case is known to have happened\r\nin which the application of military force by the Government of the\r\nUnion has been prescribed for the enforcement of a law the violation of\r\nwhich has within any single State been prescribed by a legislative act\r\nof the State. In the present instance it is my duty to say that if the\r\nlegislative and executive authorities of the State of Georgia should\r\npersevere in acts of encroachment upon the territories secured by a\r\nsolemn treaty to the Indians, and the laws of the Union remain\r\nunaltered, a superadded obligation even higher than that of human\r\nauthority will compel the Executive of the United States to enforce the\r\nlaws and fulfill the duties of the nation by all the force committed for\r\nthat purpose to his charge. That the arm of military force will be\r\nresorted to only in the event of the failure of all other expedients\r\nprovided by the laws, a pledge has been given by the forbearance to\r\nemploy it at this time. It is submitted to the wisdom of Congress to\r\ndetermine whether any further act of legislation may be necessary or\r\nexpedient to meet the emergency which these transactions may produce.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 8, 1827_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their advice with regard to its\r\nratification, a treaty between the United States and the Mexican\r\nConfederation, signed by the plenipotentiaries of the respective\r\nGovernments on the 10th of July last. It will be seen by its terms that\r\nif ratified by both parties the ratifications are to be exchanged at\r\nthis city on or before the 10th day of next month. The ratification on\r\nthe part of the Government of Mexico has not yet been received, though\r\nit has probably before this been effected. To avoid all unnecessary\r\ndelay the treaty is now communicated to the Senate, that it may receive\r\nall the deliberation which, in their wisdom, it may require, without\r\npressing upon their time at a near approach to the close of their\r\nsession. Should they advise and consent to its ratification, that\r\nmeasure will still be withheld until the ratification by the Mexican\r\nGovernment shall have been ascertained.

In that interval the\r\nnever-slumbering eye of a wise and beneficent Providence has continued\r\nits guardian care over the welfare of our beloved country; the blessing\r\nof health has continued generally to prevail throughout the land; the\r\nblessing of peace with our brethren of the human race has been enjoyed\r\nwithout interruption; internal quiet has left our fellow-citizens in the\r\nfull enjoyment of all their rights and in the free exercise of all their\r\nfaculties, to pursue the impulse of their nature and the obligation of\r\ntheir duty in the improvement of their own condition; the productions of\r\nthe soil, the exchanges of commerce, the vivifying labors of human\r\nindustry, have combined to mingle in our cup a portion of enjoyment as\r\nlarge and liberal as the indulgence of Heaven has perhaps ever granted\r\nto the imperfect state of man upon earth; and as the purest of human\r\nfelicity consists in its participation with others, it is no small\r\naddition to the sum of our national happiness at this time that peace\r\nand prosperity prevail to a degree seldom experienced over the whole\r\nhabitable globe, presenting, though as yet with painful exceptions, a\r\nforetaste of that blessed period of promise when the lion shall lie down\r\nwith the lamb and wars shall be no more. To preserve, to improve, and to\r\nperpetuate the sources and to direct in their most effective channels\r\nthe streams which contribute to the public weal is the purpose for which\r\nGovernment was instituted. Objects of deep importance to the welfare of\r\nthe Union are constantly recurring to demand the attention of the\r\nFederal Legislature, and they call with accumulated interest at the\r\nfirst meeting of the two Houses after their periodical renovation. To\r\npresent to their consideration from time to time subjects in which the\r\ninterests of the nation are most deeply involved, and for the regulation\r\nof which the legislative will is alone competent, is a duty prescribed\r\nby the Constitution, to the performance of which the first meeting of\r\nthe new Congress is a period eminently appropriate, and which it is now\r\nmy purpose to discharge.\r\n\r\nOur relations of friendship with the other nations of the earth,\r\npolitical and commercial, have been preserved unimpaired, and the\r\nopportunities to improve them have been cultivated with anxious and\r\nunremitting attention. A negotiation upon subjects of high and delicate\r\ninterest with the Government of Great Britain has terminated in the\r\nadjustment of some of the questions at issue upon satisfactory terms and\r\nthe postponement of others for future discussion and agreement. The\r\npurposes of the convention concluded at St. Petersburg on the 12th day\r\nof July, 1822, under the mediation of the late Emperor Alexander, have\r\nbeen carried into effect by a subsequent convention, concluded at London\r\non the 13th of November, 1826, the ratifications of which were exchanged\r\nat that place on the 6th day of February last. A copy of the\r\nproclamation issued on the 19th day of March last, publishing this\r\nconvention, is herewith communicated to Congress. The sum of $1,204,960,\r\ntherein stipulated to be paid to the claimants of indemnity under the\r\nfirst article of the treaty of Ghent, has been duly received, and the\r\ncommission instituted, comformably to the act of Congress of the 2d of\r\nMarch last, for the distribution of the indemnity to the persons\r\nentitled to receive it are now in session and approaching the\r\nconsummation of their labors. This final disposal of one of the most\r\npainful topics of collision between the United States and Great Britain\r\nnot only affords an occasion of gratulation to ourselves, but has had\r\nthe happiest effect in promoting a friendly disposition and in softening\r\nasperities upon other objects of discussion; nor ought it to pass\r\nwithout the tribute of a frank and cordial acknowledgment of the\r\nmagnanimity with which an honorable nation, by the reparation of their\r\nown wrongs, achieves a triumph more glorious than any field of blood can\r\never bestow.\r\n\r\nThe conventions of 3d July, 1815, and of 20th October, 1818, will expire\r\nby their own limitation on the 20th of October, 1828. These have\r\nregulated the direct commercial intercourse between the United States\r\nand Great Britain upon terms of the most perfect reciprocity; and they\r\neffected a temporary compromise of the respective rights and claims to\r\nterritory westward of the Rocky Mountains. These arrangements have been\r\ncontinued for an indefinite period of time after the expiration of the\r\nabove-mentioned conventions, leaving each party the liberty of\r\nterminating them by giving twelve months' notice to the other. The\r\nradical principle of all commercial intercourse between independent\r\nnations is the mutual interest of both parties. It is the vital spirit\r\nof trade itself; nor can it be reconciled to the nature of man or to the\r\nprimary laws of human society that any traffic should long be willingly\r\npursued of which all the advantages are on one side and all the burdens\r\non the other. Treaties of commerce have been found by experience to be\r\namong the most effective instruments for promoting peace and harmony\r\nbetween nations whose interests, exclusively considered on either side,\r\nare brought into frequent collisions by competition. In framing such\r\ntreaties it is the duty of each party not simply to urge with unyielding\r\npertinacity that which suits its own interest, but to concede liberally\r\nto that which is adapted to the interest of the other. To accomplish\r\nthis, little more is generally required than a simple observance of the\r\nrule of reciprocity, and were it possible for the statesmen of one\r\nnation by stratagem and management to obtain from the weakness or\r\nignorance of another an overreaching treaty, such a compact would prove\r\nan incentive to war rather than a bond of peace. Our conventions with\r\nGreat Britain are founded upon the principles of reciprocity. The\r\ncommercial intercourse between the two countries is greater in magnitude\r\nand amount than between any two other nations on the globe. It is for\r\nall purposes of benefit or advantage to both as precious, and in all\r\nprobability far more extensive, than if the parties were still\r\nconstituent parts of one and the same nation. Treaties between such\r\nStates, regulating the intercourse of peace between them and adjusting\r\ninterests of such transcendent importance to both, which have been found\r\nin a long experience of years mutually advantageous, should not be\r\nlightly canceled or discontinued. Two conventions for continuing in\r\nforce those above mentioned have been concluded between the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the two Governments on the 6th of August last, and\r\nwill be forthwith laid before the Senate for the exercise of their\r\nconstitutional authority concerning them.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of the treaties of peace of November, 1782, and\r\nSeptember, 1783, between the United States and Great Britain, and which\r\nterminated the war of our independence, a line of boundary was drawn as\r\nthe demarcation of territory between the two countries, extending over\r\nnear 20 degrees of latitude, and ranging over seas, lakes, and\r\nmountains, then very imperfectly explored and scarcely opened to the\r\ngeographical knowledge of the age. In the progress of discovery and\r\nsettlement by both parties since that time several questions of boundary\r\nbetween their respective territories have arisen, which have been found\r\nof exceedingly difficult adjustment. At the close of the last war with\r\nGreat Britain four of these questions pressed themselves upon the\r\nconsideration of the negotiators of the treaty of Ghent, but without the\r\nmeans of concluding a definitive arrangement concerning them. They were\r\nreferred to three separate commissions consisting of two commissioners,\r\none appointed by each party, to examine and decide upon their respective\r\nclaims. In the event of a disagreement between the commissioners it was\r\nprovided that they should make reports to their several Governments, and\r\nthat the reports should finally be referred to the decision of a\r\nsovereign the common friend of both. Of these commissions two have\r\nalready terminated their sessions and investigations, one by entire and\r\nthe other by partial agreement. The commissioners of the fifth article\r\nof the treaty of Ghent have finally disagreed, and made their\r\nconflicting reports to their own Governments. But from these reports a\r\ngreat difficulty has occurred in making up a question to be decided by\r\nthe arbitrator. This purpose has, however, been effected by a fourth\r\nconvention, concluded at London by the plenipotentiaries of the two\r\nGovernments on the 29th of September last. It will be submitted,\r\ntogether with the others, to the consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhile these questions have been pending incidents have occurred of\r\nconflicting pretensions and of dangerous character upon the territory\r\nitself in dispute between the two nations. By a common understanding\r\nbetween the Governments it was agreed that no exercise of exclusive\r\njurisdiction by either party while the negotiation was pending should\r\nchange the state of the question of right to be definitively settled.\r\nSuch collision has, nevertheless, recently taken place by occurrences\r\nthe precise character of which has not yet been ascertained. A\r\ncommunication from the governor of the State of Maine, with accompanying\r\ndocuments, and a correspondence between the Secretary of State and the\r\nminister of Great Britain on this subject are now communicated. Measures\r\nhave been taken to ascertain the state of the facts more correctly by\r\nthe employment of a special agent to visit the spot where the alleged\r\noutrages have occurred, the result of whose inquiries, when received,\r\nwill be transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile so many of the subjects of high interest to the friendly relations\r\nbetween the two countries have been so far adjusted, it is matter of\r\nregret that their views respecting the commercial intercourse between\r\nthe United States and the British colonial possessions have not equally\r\napproximated to a friendly agreement.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the last session of Congress they were informed\r\nof the sudden and unexpected exclusion by the British Government of\r\naccess in vessels of the United States to all their colonial ports,\r\nexcept those immediately bordering upon our own territories. In the\r\namicable discussions which have succeeded the adoption of this measure,\r\nwhich, as it affected harshly the interests of the United States, became\r\na subject of expostulation on our part, the principles upon which its\r\njustification has been placed have been of a diversified character. It\r\nhas been at once ascribed to a mere recurrence to the old,\r\nlong-established principle of colonial monopoly and at the same time to\r\na feeling of resentment because the offers of an act of Parliament\r\nopening the colonial ports upon certain conditions had not been grasped\r\nat with sufficient eagerness by an instantaneous conformity to them. At\r\na subsequent period it has been intimated that the new exclusion was in\r\nresentment because a prior act of Parliament, of 1822, opening certain\r\ncolonial ports, under heavy and burdensome restrictions, to vessels of\r\nthe United States, had not been reciprocated by an admission of British\r\nvessels from the colonies, and their cargoes, without any restriction or\r\ndiscrimination whatever. But be the motive for the interdiction what it\r\nmay, the British Government have manifested no disposition, either by\r\nnegotiation or by corresponding legislative enactments, to recede from\r\nit, and we have been given distinctly to understand that neither of the\r\nbills which were under the consideration of Congress at their last\r\nsession would have been deemed sufficient in their concessions to have\r\nbeen rewarded by any relaxation from the British interdict. It is one of\r\nthe inconveniences inseparably connected with the attempt to adjust by\r\nreciprocal legislation interests of this nature that neither party can\r\nknow what would be satisfactory to the other, and that after enacting a\r\nstatute for the avowed and sincere purpose of conciliation it will\r\ngenerally be found utterly inadequate to the expectations of the other\r\nparty, and will terminate in mutual disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe session of Congress having terminated without any act upon the\r\nsubject, a proclamation was issued on the 17th of March last,\r\nconformably to the provisions of the sixth section of the act of 1st\r\nMarch, 1823, declaring the fact that the trade and intercourse\r\nauthorized by the British act of Parliament of 24th June, 1822, between\r\nthe United States and the British enumerated colonial ports had been by\r\nthe subsequent acts of Parliament of 5th July, 1825, and the order of\r\ncouncil of 27th July, 1826, prohibited. The effect of this proclamation,\r\nby the terms of the act under which it was issued, has been that each\r\nand every provision of the act concerning navigation of 18th April,\r\n1818, and of the act supplementary thereto of 15th May, 1820, revived\r\nand is in full force. Such, then, is the present condition of the trade\r\nthat, useful as it is to both parties, it can, with a single momentary\r\nexception, be carried on directly by the vessels of neither. That\r\nexception itself is found in a proclamation of the governor of the\r\nisland of St. Christopher and of the Virgin Islands, inviting for three\r\nmonths from the 28th of August last the importation of the articles of\r\nthe produce of the United States which constitute their export portion\r\nof this trade in the vessels of all nations. That period having already\r\nexpired, the state of mutual interdiction has again taken place. The\r\nBritish Government have not only declined negotiation upon this subject,\r\nbut by the principle they have assumed with reference to it have\r\nprecluded even the means of negotiation. It becomes not the self-respect\r\nof the United States either to solicit gratuitous favors or to accept as\r\nthe grant of a favor that for which an ample equivalent is exacted. It\r\nremains to be determined by the respective Governments whether the trade\r\nshall be opened by acts of reciprocal legislation. It is, in the\r\nmeantime, satisfactory to know that apart from the inconveniences\r\nresulting from a disturbance of the usual channels of trade no loss has\r\nbeen sustained by the commerce, the navigation, or the revenue of the\r\nUnited States, and none of magnitude is to be apprehended from this\r\nexisting state of mutual interdict.\r\n\r\nWith the other maritime and commercial nations of Europe our intercourse\r\ncontinues with little variation. Since the cessation by the convention\r\nof 24th June, 1822, of all discriminating duties upon the vessels of the\r\nUnited States and of France in either country our trade with that nation\r\nhas increased and is increasing. A disposition on the part of France has\r\nbeen manifested to renew that negotiation, and in acceding to the\r\nproposal we have expressed the wish that it might be extended to other\r\nsubjects upon which a good understanding between the parties would be\r\nbeneficial to the interests of both. The origin of the political\r\nrelations between the United States and France is coeval with the first\r\nyears of our independence. The memory of it is interwoven with that of\r\nour arduous struggle for national existence. Weakened as it has\r\noccasionally been since that time, it can by us never be forgotten, and\r\nwe should hail with exultation the moment which should indicate a\r\nrecollection equally friendly in spirit on the part of France. A fresh\r\neffort has recently been made by the minister of the United States\r\nresiding at Paris to obtain a consideration of the just claims of\r\ncitizens of the United States to the reparation of wrongs long since\r\ncommitted, many of them frankly acknowledged and all of them entitled\r\nupon every principle of justice to a candid examination. The proposal\r\nlast made to the French Government has been to refer the subject which\r\nhas formed an obstacle to this consideration to the determination of a\r\nsovereign the common friend of both. To this offer no definitive answer\r\nhas yet been received, but the gallant and honorable spirit which has at\r\nall times been the pride and glory of France will not ultimately permit\r\nthe demands of innocent sufferers to be extinguished in the mere\r\nconsciousness of the power to reject them.\r\n\r\nA new treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce has been concluded with\r\nthe Kingdom of Sweden, which will be submitted to the Senate for their\r\nadvice with regard to its ratification. At a more recent date a minister\r\nplenipotentiary from the Hanseatic Republics of Hamburg, Lubeck, and\r\nBremen has been received, charged with a special mission for the\r\nnegotiation of a treaty of amity and commerce between that ancient and\r\nrenowned league and the United States. This negotiation has accordingly\r\nbeen commenced, and is now in progress, the result of which will, if\r\nsuccessful, be also submitted to the Senate for their consideration.\r\n\r\nSince the accession of the Emperor Nicholas to the imperial throne of\r\nall the Russias the friendly dispositions toward the United States so\r\nconstantly manifested by his predecessor have continued unabated, and\r\nhave been recently testified by the appointment of a minister\r\nplenipotentiary to reside at this place. From the interest taken by this\r\nSovereign in behalf of the suffering Greeks and from the spirit with\r\nwhich others of the great European powers are cooperating with him the\r\nfriends of freedom and of humanity may indulge the hope that they will\r\nobtain relief from that most unequal of conflicts which they have so\r\nlong and so gallantly sustained; that they will enjoy the blessing of\r\nself-government, which by their sufferings in the cause of liberty they\r\nhave richly earned, and that their independence will be secured by those\r\nliberal institutions of which their country furnished the earliest\r\nexamples in the history of mankind, and which have consecrated to\r\nimmortal remembrance the very soil for which they are now again\r\nprofusely pouring forth their blood. The sympathies which the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States have so warmly indulged with their cause\r\nhave been acknowledged by their Government in a letter of thanks, which\r\nI have received from their illustrious President, a translation of which\r\nis now communicated to Congress, the representatives of that nation to\r\nwhom this tribute of gratitude was intended to be paid, and to whom it\r\nwas justly due.\r\n\r\nIn the American hemisphere the cause of freedom and independence has\r\ncontinued to prevail, and if signalized by none of those splendid\r\ntriumphs which had crowned with glory some of the preceding years it has\r\nonly been from the banishment of all external force against which the\r\nstruggle had been maintained. The shout of victory has been superseded\r\nby the expulsion of the enemy over whom it could have been achieved. Our\r\nfriendly wishes and cordial good will, which have constantly followed\r\nthe southern nations of America in all the vicissitudes of their war of\r\nindependence, are succeeded by a solicitude equally ardent and cordial\r\nthat by the wisdom and purity of their institutions they may secure to\r\nthemselves the choicest blessings of social order and the best rewards\r\nof virtuous liberty. Disclaiming alike all right and all intention of\r\ninterfering in those concerns which it is the prerogative of their\r\nindependence to regulate as to them shall seem fit, we hail with joy\r\nevery indication of their prosperity, of their harmony, of their\r\npersevering and inflexible homage to those principles of freedom and of\r\nequal rights which are alone suited to the genius and temper of the\r\nAmerican nations. It has been, therefore, with some concern that we have\r\nobserved indications of intestine divisions in some of the Republics of\r\nthe south, and appearances of less union with one another than we\r\nbelieve to be the interest of all. Among the results of this state of\r\nthings has been that the treaties concluded at Panama do not appear to\r\nhave been ratified by the contracting parties, and that the meeting of\r\nthe congress at Tacubaya has been indefinitely postponed. In accepting\r\nthe invitations to be represented at this congress, while a\r\nmanifestation was intended on the part of the United States of the most\r\nfriendly disposition toward the southern Republics by whom it had been\r\nproposed, it was hoped that it would furnish an opportunity for bringing\r\nall the nations of this hemisphere to the common acknowledgment and\r\nadoption of the principles in the regulation of their internal relations\r\nwhich would have secured a lasting peace and harmony between them and\r\nhave promoted the cause of mutual benevolence throughout the globe. But\r\nas obstacles appear to have arisen to the reassembling of the congress,\r\none of the two ministers commissioned on the part of the United States\r\nhas returned to the bosom of his country, while the minister charged\r\nwith the ordinary mission to Mexico remains authorized to attend at the\r\nconferences of the congress whenever they may be resumed.\r\n\r\nA hope was for a short time entertained that a treaty of peace actually\r\nsigned between the Governments of Buenos Ayres and of Brazil would\r\nsupersede all further occasion for those collisions between belligerent\r\npretensions and neutral rights which are so commonly the result of\r\nmaritime war, and which have unfortunately disturbed the harmony of the\r\nrelations between the United States and the Brazilian Governments. At\r\ntheir last session Congress were informed that some of the naval\r\nofficers of that Empire had advanced and practiced upon principles in\r\nrelation to blockades and to neutral navigation which we could not\r\nsanction, and which our commanders found it necessary to resist. It\r\nappears that they have not been sustained by the Government of Brazil\r\nitself. Some of the vessels captured under the assumed authority of\r\nthese erroneous principles have been restored, and we trust that our\r\njust expectations will be realized that adequate indemnity will be made\r\nto all the citizens of the United States who have suffered by the\r\nunwarranted captures which the Brazilian tribunals themselves have\r\npronounced unlawful.\r\n\r\nIn the diplomatic discussions at Rio de Janeiro of these wrongs\r\nsustained by citizens of the United States and of others which seemed as\r\nif emanating immediately from that Government itself the chargé\r\nd'affaires of the United States, under an impression that his\r\nrepresentations in behalf of the rights and interests of his countrymen\r\nwere totally disregarded and useless, deemed it his duty, without\r\nwaiting for instructions, to terminate his official functions, to demand\r\nhis passports, and return to the United States. This movement, dictated\r\nby an honest zeal for the honor and interests of his country--motives\r\nwhich operated exclusively on the mind of the officer who resorted to\r\nit--has not been disapproved by me. The Brazilian Government, however,\r\ncomplained of it as a measure for which no adequate intentional cause\r\nhad been given by them, and upon an explicit assurance through their\r\nchargé d'affaires residing here that a successor to the late\r\nrepresentative of the United States near that Government, the\r\nappointment of whom they desired, should be received and treated with\r\nthe respect due to his character, and that indemnity should be promptly\r\nmade for all injuries inflicted on citizens of the United States or\r\ntheir property contrary to the laws of nations, a temporary commission\r\nas charge d'affaires to that country has been issued, which it is hoped\r\nwill entirety restore the ordinary diplomatic intercourse between the\r\ntwo Governments and the friendly relations between their respective\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nTurning from the momentous concerns of our Union in its intercourse with\r\nforeign nations to those of the deepest interest in the administration\r\nof our internal affairs, we find the revenues of the present year\r\ncorresponding as nearly as might be expected with the anticipations of\r\nthe last, and presenting an aspect still more favorable in the promise\r\nof the next. The balance in the Treasury on January 1 last was\r\n$6,358,686.18. The receipts from that day to the 30th of September last,\r\nas near as the returns of them yet received can show, amount to\r\n$16,886,581.32. The receipts of the present quarter, estimated at\r\n$4,515,000, added to the above form an aggregate of $21,400,000 of\r\nreceipts. The expenditures of the year may perhaps amount to\r\n$22,300,000, presenting a small excess over the receipts. But of these\r\ntwenty-two millions, upward of six have been applied to the discharge of\r\nthe principal of the public debt, the whole amount of which, approaching\r\nseventy-four millions on the 1st of January last, will on the first day\r\nof the next year fall short of sixty-seven millions and a half. The\r\nbalance in the Treasury on the 1st of January next it is expected will\r\nexceed $5,450,000, a sum exceeding that of the 1st of January, 1825,\r\nthough falling short of that exhibited on the 1st of January last.\r\n\r\nIt was foreseen that the revenue of the present year would not equal\r\nthat of the last, which had itself been less than that of the next\r\npreceding year. But the hope has been realized which was entertained,\r\nthat these deficiencies would in nowise interrupt the steady operation\r\nof the discharge of the public debt by the annual ten millions devoted\r\nto that object by the act of 3d March, 1817.\r\n\r\nThe amount of duties secured on merchandise imported from the\r\ncommencement of the year until the 30th of September last is\r\n$21,226,000, and the probable amount of that which will be secured\r\nduring the remainder of the year is $5,774,000, forming a sum total of\r\n$27,000,000. With the allowances for drawbacks and contingent\r\ndeficiencies which may occur, though not specifically foreseen, we may\r\nsafely estimate the receipts of the ensuing year at $22,300,000--a\r\nrevenue for the next equal to the expenditure of the present year.\r\n\r\nThe deep solicitude felt by our citizens of all classes throughout the\r\nUnion for the total discharge of the public debt will apologize for the\r\nearnestness with which I deem it my duty to urge this topic upon the\r\nconsideration of Congress--of recommending to them again the observance\r\nof the strictest economy in the application of the public funds. The\r\ndepression upon the receipts of the revenue which had commenced with the\r\nyear 1826 continued with increased severity during the two first\r\nquarters of the present year. The returning tide began to flow with the\r\nthird quarter, and, so far as we can judge from experience, may be\r\nexpected to continue through the course of the ensuing year. In the\r\nmeantime an alleviation from the burden of the public debt will in the\r\nthree years have been effected to the amount of nearly sixteen millions,\r\nand the charge of annual interest will have been reduced upward of one\r\nmillion. But among the maxims of political economy which the stewards of\r\nthe public moneys should never suffer without urgent necessity to be\r\ntranscended is that of keeping the expenditures of the year within the\r\nlimits of its receipts. The appropriations of the two last years,\r\nincluding the yearly ten millions of the sinking fund, have each equaled\r\nthe promised revenue of the ensuing year. While we foresee with\r\nconfidence that the public coffers will be replenished from the receipts\r\nas fast as they will be drained by the expenditures, equal in amount to\r\nthose of the current year, it should not be forgotten that they could\r\nill suffer the exhaustion of larger disbursements.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Army and of all the branches of the public service\r\nunder the superintendence of the Secretary of War will be seen by the\r\nreport from that officer and the documents with which it is accompanied.\r\n\r\nDuring the last summer a detachment of the Army has been usefully and\r\nsuccessfully called to perform their appropriate duties. At the moment\r\nwhen the commissioners appointed for carrying into execution certain\r\nprovisions of the treaty of August 19, 1825, with various tribes of the\r\nNorthwestern Indians were about to arrive at the appointed place of\r\nmeeting the unprovoked murder of several citizens and other acts of\r\nunequivocal hostility committed by a party of the Winnebago tribe, one\r\nof those associated in the treaty, followed by indications of a menacing\r\ncharacter among other tribes of the same region, rendered necessary an\r\nimmediate display of the defensive and protective force of the Union in\r\nthat quarter. It was accordingly exhibited by the immediate and\r\nconcerted movements of the governors of the State of Illinois and of the\r\nTerritory of Michigan, and competent levies of militia, under their\r\nauthority, with a corps of 700 men of United States troops, under the\r\ncommand of General Atkinson, who, at the call of Governor Cass,\r\nimmediately repaired to the scene of danger from their station at St.\r\nLouis. Their presence dispelled the alarms of our fellow-citizens on\r\nthose borders, and overawed the hostile purposes of the Indians. The\r\nperpetrators of the murders were surrendered to the authority and\r\noperation of our laws, and every appearance of purposed hostility from\r\nthose Indian tribes has subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough the present organization of the Army and the administration of\r\nits various branches of service are, upon the whole, satisfactory, they\r\nare yet susceptible of much improvement in particulars, some of which\r\nhave been heretofore submitted to the consideration of Congress, and\r\nothers are now first presented in the report of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of providing for additional numbers of officers in the\r\ntwo corps of engineers will in some degree depend upon the number and\r\nextent of the objects of national importance upon which Congress may\r\nthink it proper that surveys should be made conformably to the act of\r\nthe 30th of April, 1824. 'Of the surveys which before the last session\r\nof Congress had been made under the authority of that act, reports were\r\nmade--\r\n\r\n1. Of the Board of Internal Improvement, on the Chesapeake and Ohio\r\nCanal.\r\n\r\n2. On the continuation of the national road from Cumberland to the tide\r\nwaters within the district of Columbia.\r\n\r\n3. On the continuation of the national road from Canton to Zanesville.\r\n\r\n4. On the location of the national road from Zanesville to Columbus.\r\n\r\n5. On the continuation of the same to the seat of government in\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n6.

All the officers of both corps of engineers, with several other\r\npersons duly qualified, have been constantly employed upon these\r\nservices from the passage of the act of 30th April, 1824, to this time.\r\nWere no other advantage to accrue to the country from their labors than\r\nthe fund of topographical knowledge which they have collected and\r\ncommunicated, that alone would have been a profit to the Union more than\r\nadequate to all the expenditures which have been devoted to the object;\r\nbut the appropriations for the repair and continuation of the Cumberland\r\nroad, for the construction of various other roads, for the removal of\r\nobstructions from the rivers and harbors, for the erection of\r\nlight-houses, beacons, piers, and buoys, and for the completion of\r\ncanals undertaken by individual associations, but heeding the assistance\r\nof means and resources more comprehensive than individual enterprise can\r\ncommand, may be considered rather as treasures laid up from the\r\ncontributions of the present age for the benefit of posterity than as\r\nunrequited applications of the accruing revenues of the nation. To such\r\nobjects of permanent improvement to the condition of the country, of\r\nreal addition to the wealth as well as to the comfort of the people by\r\nwhose authority and resources they have been effected, from three to\r\nfour millions of the annual income of the nation have, by laws enacted\r\nat the three most recent sessions of Congress, been applied, without\r\nintrenching upon the necessities of the Treasury, without adding a\r\ndollar to the taxes or debts of the community, without suspending even\r\nthe steady and regular discharge of the debts contracted in former days,\r\nwhich within the same three years have been diminished by the amount of\r\nnearly $16,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe same observations are in a great degree applicable to the\r\nappropriations made for fortifications upon the coasts and harbors of\r\nthe United States, for the maintenance of the Military Academy at West\r\nPoint, and for the various objects under the superintendence of the\r\nDepartment of the Navy. The report from the Secretary of the Navy and\r\nthose from the subordinate branches of both the military departments\r\nexhibit to Congress in minute detail the present condition of the public\r\nestablishments dependent upon them, the execution of the acts of\r\nCongress relating to them, and the views of the officers engaged in the\r\nseveral branches of the service concerning the improvements which may\r\ntend to their perfection. The fortification of the coasts and the\r\ngradual increase and improvement of the Navy are parts of a great system\r\nof national defense which has been upward of ten years in progress, and\r\nwhich for a series of years to come will continue to claim the constant\r\nand persevering protection and superintendence of the legislative\r\nauthority. Among the measures which have emanated from these principles\r\nthe act of the last session of Congress for the gradual improvement of\r\nthe Navy holds a conspicuous place. The collection of timber for the\r\nfuture construction of vessels of war, the preservation and reproduction\r\nof the species of timber peculiarly adapted to that purpose, the\r\nconstruction of dry docks for the use of the Navy, the erection of a\r\nmarine railway for the repair of the public ships, and the improvement\r\nof the navy-yards for the preservation of the public property deposited\r\nin them have all received from the Executive the attention required by\r\nthat act, and will continue to receive it, steadily proceeding toward\r\nthe execution of all its purposes. The establishment of a naval academy,\r\nfurnishing the means of theoretic instruction to the youths who devote\r\ntheir lives to the service of their country upon the ocean, still\r\nsolicits the sanction of the Legislature. Practical seamanship and the\r\nart of navigation may be acquired on the cruises of the squadrons which\r\nfrom time to time are dispatched to distant seas, but a competent\r\nknowledge even of the art of shipbuilding, the higher mathematics, and\r\nastronomy; the literature which can place our officers on a level of\r\npolished education with the officers of other maritime nations; the\r\nknowledge of the laws, municipal and national, which in their\r\nintercourse with foreign states and their governments are continually\r\ncalled into operation, and, above all, that acquaintance with the\r\nprinciples of honor and justice, with the higher obligations of morals\r\nand of general laws, human and divine, which constitutes the great\r\ndistinction between the warrior-patriot and the licensed robber and\r\npirate--these can be systematically taught and eminently acquired only\r\nin a permanent school, stationed upon the shore and provided with the\r\nteachers, the instruments, and the books conversant with and adapted to\r\nthe communication of the principles of these respective sciences to the\r\nyouthful and inquiring mind.\r\n\r\nThe report from the Postmaster-General exhibits the condition of that\r\nDepartment as highly satisfactory for the present and still more\r\npromising for the future. Its receipts for the year ending the 1st of\r\nJuly last amounted to $1,473,551, and exceeded its expenditures by\r\nupward of $100,000. It can not be an oversanguine estimate to predict\r\nthat in less than ten years, of which one-half have elapsed, the\r\nreceipts will have been more than doubled. In the meantime a reduced\r\nexpenditure upon established routes has kept pace with increased\r\nfacilities of public accommodation and additional services have been\r\nobtained at reduced rates of compensation. Within the last year the\r\ntransportation of the mail in stages has been greatly augmented. The\r\nnumber of post-offices has been increased to 7,000, and it may be\r\nanticipated that while the facilities of intercourse between\r\nfellow-citizens in person or by correspondence will soon be carried to\r\nthe door of every villager in the Union, a yearly surplus of revenue\r\nwill accrue which may be applied as the wisdom of Congress under the\r\nexercise of their constitutional powers may devise for the further\r\nestablishment and improvement of the public roads, or by adding still\r\nfurther to the facilities in the transportation of the mails. Of the\r\nindications of the prosperous condition of our country, none can be more\r\npleasing than those presented by the multiplying relations of personal\r\nand intimate intercourse between the citizens of the Union dwelling at\r\nthe remotest distances from each other.\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects which have heretofore occupied the earnest solicitude\r\nand attention of Congress is the management and disposal of that portion\r\nof the property of the nation which consists of the public lands. The\r\nacquisition of them, made at the expense of the whole Union, not only in\r\ntreasure but in blood, marks a right of property in them equally\r\nextensive. By the report and statements from the General Land Office now\r\ncommunicated it appears that under the present Government of the United\r\nStates a sum little short of $33,000,000 has been paid from the common\r\nTreasury for that portion of this property which has been purchased from\r\nFrance and Spain, and for the extinction of the aboriginal titles. The\r\namount of lands acquired is near 260,000,000 acres, of which on the 1st\r\nof January, 1826, about 139,000,000 acres had been surveyed, and little\r\nmore than 19,000,000 acres had been sold. The amount paid into the\r\nTreasury by the purchasers of the public lands sold is not yet equal to\r\nthe sums paid for the whole, but leaves a small balance to be refunded.\r\nThe proceeds of the sales of the lands have long been pledged to the\r\ncreditors of the nation, a pledge from which we have reason to hope that\r\nthey will in a very few years be redeemed.\r\n\r\nThe system upon which this great national interest has been managed was\r\nthe result of long, anxious, and persevering deliberation. Matured and\r\nmodified by the progress of our population and the lessons of\r\nexperience, it has been hitherto eminently successful. More than\r\nnine-tenths of the lands still remain the common property of the Union,\r\nthe appropriation and disposal of which are sacred trusts in the hands\r\nof Congress. Of the lands sold, a considerable part were conveyed under\r\nextended credits, which in the vicissitudes and fluctuations in the\r\nvalue of lands and of their produce became oppressively burdensome to\r\nthe purchasers. It can never be the interest or the policy of the nation\r\nto wring from its own citizens the reasonable profits of their industry\r\nand enterprise by holding them to the rigorous import of disastrous\r\nengagements. In March, 1821, a debt of $22,000,000, due by purchasers of\r\nthe public lands, had accumulated, which they were unable to pay. An act\r\nof Congress of the 2d March, 1821, came to their relief, and has been\r\nsucceeded by others, the latest being the act of the 4th of May, 1826,\r\nthe indulgent provisions of which expired on the 4th July last. The\r\neffect of these laws has been to reduce the debt from the purchasers to\r\na remaining balance of about $4,300,000 due, more than three-fifths of\r\nwhich are for lands within the State of Alabama. I recommend to Congress\r\nthe revival and continuance for a further term of the beneficent\r\naccommodations to the public debtors of that statute, and submit to\r\ntheir consideration, in the same spirit of equity, the remission, under\r\nproper discriminations, of the forfeitures of partial payments on\r\naccount of purchases of the public lands, so far as to allow of their\r\napplication to other payments.\r\n\r\nThere are various other subjects of deep interest to the whole Union\r\nwhich have heretofore been recommended to the consideration of Congress,\r\nas well by my predecessors as, under the impression of the duties\r\ndevolving upon me, by myself. Among these are the debt, rather of\r\njustice than gratitude, to the surviving warriors of the Revolutionary\r\nwar; the extension of the judicial administration of the Federal\r\nGovernment to those extensive and important members of the Union which,\r\nhaving risen into existence since the organization of the present\r\njudiciary establishment, now constitute at least one-third of its\r\nterritory, power, and population; the formation of a more effective and\r\nuniform system for the government of the militia, and the amelioration\r\nin some form or modification of the diversified and often oppressive\r\ncodes relating to insolvency. Amidst the multiplicity of topics of great\r\nnational concernment which may recommend themselves to the calm and\r\npatriotic deliberations of the Legislature, it may suffice to say that\r\non these and all other measures which may receive their sanction my\r\nhearty cooperation will be given, conformably to the duties enjoined\r\nupon me and under the sense of all the obligations prescribed by the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 6, 1827_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 19th of February\r\nlast, requesting a statement of all the expenses annually incurred in\r\ncarrying into effect the act of March 2, 1819, for prohibiting the slave\r\ntrade, including the cost of keeping the ships of war on the coast of\r\nAfrica and all the incidental expenses growing out of the operation of\r\nthat act, I transmit a report from the Secretary of the Navy, with the\r\nstatement, so far as it can be made, required by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 11, 1827_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate--\r\n\r\n1.

In doing this it has not been intended to maintain the\r\nregularity of his own proceedings or of those with whom he was\r\nassociated, to which they were not authorized by any sovereign authority\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\nThe documents appended to the report of the agent being original papers\r\nbelonging to the files of the Department of State, a return of them is\r\nrequested when the Senate shall have no further use for them.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 7, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the Senate of the 28th ultimo, requesting me to cause\r\nto be laid before the Senate all papers which might be in the Department\r\nof War relating to the treaty concluded at the Butte des Morts, on Fox\r\nRiver, between Lewis Cass and Thomas L. McKenney, commissioners on the\r\npart of the United States, and the Chippewa, Menomonie, and Winnebago\r\ntribes of Indians, having been referred to the Secretary of War, the\r\nreport of that officer thereon is herewith inclosed. The papers therein\r\nreferred to were all transmitted to the Senate with the treaty. Before\r\nthat event, however, a petition and several other papers had been\r\naddressed directly to me, in behalf of certain Indians originally and in\r\npart still residing within the State of New York, objecting to the\r\nratification of the treaty, as affecting injuriously their rights and\r\ninterests. The treaty was itself withheld from the Senate until it was\r\nunderstood at the War Department and by me that by the consent of the\r\npersons representing the New York Indians their objections were\r\nwithdrawn, as by one of them, the Reverend Eleazer Williams, I was\r\npersonally assured. Those papers, however, addressed directly to me, and\r\nwhich have not been upon the files of the War Department, are now\r\ntransmitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 14, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their consideration and advice, a treaty\r\nconcluded at the Wyandot village, near the Wabash, in the State of\r\nIndiana, between John Tipton, commissioner on the part of the United\r\nStates, and the chiefs, headmen, and warriors of the Eel River or\r\nThorntown party of Miami Indians, on the 11th day of February last.\r\n\r\nA letter from the commissioner to the Secretary of War, with a copy of\r\nthe journal of the proceedings which led to the conclusion of the\r\ntreaty, are communicated with it to the Senate.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 15, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of the 21st ultimo,\r\nrequesting me to lay before the House correspondence not heretofore\r\ncommunicated between the Government of the United States and that of\r\nGreat Britain on the subject of the claims of the two Governments to the\r\nterritory westward of the Rocky Mountains, I transmit herewith a report\r\nof the Secretary of State, with the documents requested by the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 21, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress copies of a treaty concluded on the 15th day of\r\nNovember, 1827, by commissioners of the United States and the chiefs and\r\nheadmen of the Creek Nation of Indians, which was duly ratified on the\r\n4th instant.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 22, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n3d instant, touching the formation of a new government by the Cherokee\r\ntribe of Indians within the States of North Carolina, Georgia,\r\nTennessee, and Alabama, and requesting copies of certain correspondence\r\nrelating thereto, I transmit to the House of Representatives a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of War, together with the documents desired by the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 25, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, prepared in\r\ncompliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n25th of February last, requesting copies of instructions and\r\ncorrespondence relating to the settlement of the boundary lines of the\r\nUnited States, or any one of them, under the Government of the\r\nConfederated States and by the definitive treaty of peace of 3d\r\nSeptember, 1783, with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 8, 1828_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n22d ultimo, on the subject of the treaty with the Creek Nation of\r\nIndians of the 15th November last, I transmit herewith a report from the\r\nSecretary of War, with the documents, containing the information desired\r\nby the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 15, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of the 9th instant,\r\nrequesting copies of the charges preferred against the agent of the\r\nUnited States for the Creek tribe of Indians since the 1st of January,\r\n1826, and of proceedings had thereon, I transmit herewith a report from\r\nthe Secretary of War, with documents, containing the information desired\r\nby the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 17, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the practice of all my predecessors, I have during my\r\nservice in the office of President transmitted to the two Houses of\r\nCongress from time to time, by the same private secretary, such messages\r\nas a proper discharge of my constitutional duty appeared to me to\r\nrequire. On Tuesday last he was charged with the delivery of a message\r\nto each House. Having presented that which was intended for the House of\r\nRepresentatives, whilst he was passing, within the Capitol, from their\r\nHall to the Chamber of the Senate, for the purpose of delivering the\r\nother message, he was waylaid and assaulted in the Rotunda by a person,\r\nin the presence of a member of the House, who interposed and separated\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\nI have thought it my duty to communicate this occurrence to Congress, to\r\nwhose wisdom it belongs to consider whether it is of a nature requiring\r\nfrom them any animadversion, and also whether any further laws or\r\nregulations are necessary to insure security in the official intercourse\r\nbetween the President and Congress, and to prevent disorders within the\r\nCapitol itself.\r\n\r\nIn the deliberations of Congress upon this subject it is neither\r\nexpected nor desired that any consequence shall be attached to the\r\nprivate relation in which my secretary stands to me.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_April 21, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their consideration and advice, a treaty\r\nof limits between the United States of America and the United Mexican\r\nStates, concluded by the plenipotentiaries of the two Governments on the\r\n12th of January last.

Clay,\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of War,\r\n_February 28, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War, by direction of the President of the United\r\nStates, announces to the Army the painful intelligence of the decease\r\n(the 24th of February) of Major-General Brown.\r\n\r\nTo say that he was one of the men who have rendered most important\r\nservices to his country would fall far short of the tribute due to his\r\ncharacter. Uniting with the most unaffected simplicity the highest\r\ndegree of personal valor and of intellectual energy, he stands\r\npreeminent before the world and for after ages in that band of heroic\r\nspirits who upon the ocean and the land formed and sustained during the\r\nsecond war with Great Britain the martial reputation of their country.\r\nTo this high and honorable purpose General Brown may be truly said to\r\nhave sacrificed his life, for the disease which abridged his days and\r\nhas terminated his career at a period scarcely beyond the meridian of\r\nmanhood undoubtedly originated in the hardships of his campaigns on the\r\nCanada frontier, and in that glorious wound which, though desperate,\r\ncould not remove him from the field of battle till it was won.\r\n\r\nQuick to perceive, sagacious to anticipate, prompt to decide, and daring\r\nin execution, he was born with the qualities which constitute a great\r\ncommander. His military _coup d'oeil_ his intuitive penetration, his\r\nknowledge of men and his capacity to control them were known to all his\r\ncompanions in arms, and commanded their respect; while the gentleness of\r\nhis disposition, the courtesy of his deportment, his scrupulous regard\r\nto their rights, his constant attention to their wants, and his\r\naffectionate attachment to their persons universally won their hearts\r\nand bound them to him as a father.\r\n\r\nCalm and collected in the presence of the enemy, he was withal tender of\r\nhuman life; in the hour of battle more sparing of the blood of the\r\nsoldier than his own. In the hour of victory the vanquished enemy found\r\nin him a humane and compassionate friend. Not one drop of blood shed in\r\nwantonness or cruelty sullies the purity of his fame. Defeat he was\r\nnever called to endure, but in the crisis of difficulty and danger he\r\ndisplayed untiring patience and fortitude not to be overcome.\r\n\r\nSuch was the great and accomplished captain whose loss the Army has now,\r\nin common with their fellow-citizens of all classes, to deplore. While\r\nindulging the kindly impulses of nature and yielding the tribute of a\r\ntear upon his grave, let it not be permitted to close upon his bright\r\nexample as it must upon his mortal remains. Let him be more nobly\r\nsepulchered in the hearts of his fellow-soldiers, and his imperishable\r\nmonument be found in their endeavors to emulate his virtues.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Army will wear the badge of mourning for six months\r\non the left arm and hilt of the sword. Guns will be fired at each\r\nmilitary post at intervals of thirty minutes from the rising to the\r\nsetting of the sun on the day succeeding the arrival of this order,\r\nduring which the National flag will be suspended at half-mast.\r\n\r\nJames Barbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 2, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIf the enjoyment in profusion of the bounties of Providence forms a\r\nsuitable subject of mutual gratulation and grateful acknowledgment, we\r\nare admonished at this return of the season when the representatives of\r\nthe nation are assembled to deliberate upon their concerns to offer up\r\nthe tribute of fervent and grateful hearts for the never-failing mercies\r\nof Him who ruleth over all. He has again favored us with healthful\r\nseasons and abundant harvests; He has sustained us in peace with foreign\r\ncountries and in tranquillity within our borders; He has preserved us in\r\nthe quiet and undisturbed possession of civil and religious liberty; He\r\nhas crowned the year with His goodness, imposing on us no other\r\nconditions than of improving for our own happiness the blessings\r\nbestowed by His hands, and, in the fruition of all His favors, of\r\ndevoting the faculties with which we have been endowed by Him to His\r\nglory and to our own temporal and eternal welfare.\r\n\r\nIn the relations of our Federal Union with our brethren of the human\r\nrace the changes which have occurred since the close of your last\r\nsession have generally tended to the preservation of peace and to the\r\ncultivation of harmony. Before your last separation a war had unhappily\r\nbeen kindled between the Empire of Russia, one of those with which our\r\nintercourse has been no other than a constant exchange of good offices,\r\nand that of the Ottoman Porte, a nation from which geographical\r\ndistance, religious opinions and maxims of government on their part\r\nlittle suited to the formation of those bonds of mutual benevolence\r\nwhich result from the benefits of commerce had kept us in a state,\r\nperhaps too much prolonged, of coldness and alienation. The extensive,\r\nfertile, and populous dominions of the Sultan belong rather to the\r\nAsiatic than the European division of the human family. They enter but\r\npartially into the system of Europe, nor have their wars with Russia and\r\nAustria, the European States upon which they border, for more than a\r\ncentury past disturbed the pacific relations of those States with the\r\nother great powers of Europe. Neither France nor Prussia nor Great\r\nBritain has ever taken part in them, nor is it to be expected that they\r\nwill at this time. The declaration of war by Russia has received the\r\napprobation or acquiescence of her allies, and we may indulge the hope\r\nthat its progress and termination will be signalized by the moderation\r\nand forbearance no less than by the energy of the Emperor Nicholas, and\r\nthat it will afford the opportunity for such collateral agency in behalf\r\nof the suffering Greeks as will secure to them ultimately the triumph of\r\nhumanity and of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe state of our particular relations with France has scarcely varied in\r\nthe course of the present year. The commercial intercourse between the\r\ntwo countries has continued to increase for the mutual benefit of both.\r\nThe claims of indemnity to numbers of our fellow-citizens for\r\ndepredations upon their property, heretofore committed during the\r\nrevolutionary governments, remain unadjusted, and still form the subject\r\nof earnest representation and remonstrance. Recent advices from the\r\nminister of the United States at Paris encourage the expectation that\r\nthe appeal to the justice of the French Government will ere long receive\r\na favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe last friendly expedient has been resorted to for the decision of the\r\ncontroversy with Great Britain relating to the northeastern boundary of\r\nthe United States. By an agreement with the British Government, carrying\r\ninto effect the provisions of the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent,\r\nand the convention of 29th September, 1827, His Majesty the King of the\r\nNetherlands has by common consent been selected as the umpire between\r\nthe parties. The proposal to him to accept the designation for the\r\nperformance of this friendly office will be made at an early day, and\r\nthe United States, relying upon the justice of their cause, will\r\ncheerfully commit the arbitrament of it to a prince equally\r\ndistinguished for the independence of his spirit, his indefatigable\r\nassiduity to the duties of his station, and his inflexible personal\r\nprobity.\r\n\r\nOur commercial relations with Great Britain will deserve the serious\r\nconsideration of Congress and the exercise of a conciliatory and\r\nforbearing spirit in the policy of both Governments. The state of them\r\nhas been materially changed by the act of Congress, passed at their last\r\nsession, in alteration of the several acts imposing duties on imports,\r\nand by acts of more recent date of the British Parliament. The effect of\r\nthe interdiction of direct trade, commenced by Great Britain and\r\nreciprocated by the United States, has been, as was to be foreseen, only\r\nto substitute different channels for an exchange of commodities\r\nindispensable to the colonies and profitable to a numerous class of our\r\nfellow-citizens. The exports, the revenue, the navigation of the United\r\nStates have suffered no diminution by our exclusion from direct access\r\nto the British colonies. The colonies pay more dearly for the\r\nnecessaries of life which their Government burdens with the charges of\r\ndouble voyages, freight, insurance, and commission, and the profits of\r\nour exports are somewhat impaired and more injuriously transferred from\r\none portion of our citizens to another. The resumption of this old and\r\notherwise exploded system of colonial exclusion has not secured to the\r\nshipping interest of Great Britain the relief which, at the expense of\r\nthe distant colonies and of the United States, it was expected to\r\nafford. Other measures have been resorted to more pointedly bearing upon\r\nthe navigation of the United States, and which, unless modified by the\r\nconstruction given to the recent acts of Parliament, will be manifestly\r\nincompatible with the positive stipulations of the commercial convention\r\nexisting between the two countries. That convention, however, may be\r\nterminated with twelve months' notice, at the option of either party.\r\n\r\nA treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce between the United States\r\nand His Majesty the Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia, has\r\nbeen prepared for signature by the Secretary of State and by the Baron\r\nde Lederer, intrusted with full powers of the Austrian Government.\r\nIndependently of the new and friendly relations which may be thus\r\ncommenced with one of the most eminent and powerful nations of the\r\nearth, the occasion has been taken in it, as in other recent treaties\r\nconcluded by the United States, to extend those principles of liberal\r\nintercourse and of fair reciprocity which intertwine with the exchanges\r\nof commerce the principles of justice and the feelings of mutual\r\nbenevolence. This system, first proclaimed to the world in the first\r\ncommercial treaty ever concluded by the United States--that of 6th\r\nFebruary, 1778, with France--has been invariably the cherished policy of\r\nour Union. It is by treaties of commerce alone that it can be made\r\nultimately to prevail as the established system of all civilized\r\nnations. With this principle our fathers extended the hand of friendship\r\nto every nation of the globe, and to this policy our country has ever\r\nsince adhered. Whatever of regulation in our laws has ever been adopted\r\nunfavorable to the interest of any foreign nation has been essentially\r\ndefensive and counteracting to similar regulations of theirs operating\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the close of the War of Independence commissioners\r\nwere appointed by the Congress of the Confederation authorized to\r\nconclude treaties with every nation of Europe disposed to adopt them.\r\nBefore the wars of the French Revolution such treaties had been\r\nconsummated with the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Prussia. During\r\nthose wars treaties with Great Britain and Spain had been effected, and\r\nthose with Prussia and France renewed. In all these some concessions to\r\nthe liberal principles of intercourse proposed by the United States had\r\nbeen obtained; but as in all the negotiations they came occasionally in\r\ncollision with previous internal regulations or exclusive and excluding\r\ncompacts of monopoly with which the other parties had been trammeled,\r\nthe advances made in them toward the freedom of trade were partial and\r\nimperfect. Colonial establishments, chartered companies, and\r\nshipbuilding influence pervaded and encumbered the legislation of all\r\nthe great commercial states; and the United States, in offering free\r\ntrade and equal privilege to all, were compelled to acquiesce in many\r\nexceptions with each of the parties to their treaties, accommodated to\r\ntheir existing laws and anterior engagements.\r\n\r\nThe colonial system by which this whole hemisphere was bound has fallen\r\ninto ruins, totally abolished by revolutions converting colonies into\r\nindependent nations throughout the two American continents, excepting a\r\nportion of territory chiefly at the northern extremity of our own, and\r\nconfined to the remnants of dominion retained by Great Britain over the\r\ninsular archipelago, geographically the appendages of our part of the\r\nglobe. With all the rest we have free trade, even with the insular\r\ncolonies of all the European nations, except Great Britain. Her\r\nGovernment also had manifested approaches to the adoption of a free and\r\nliberal intercourse between her colonies and other nations, though by a\r\nsudden and scarcely explained revulsion the spirit of exclusion has been\r\nrevived for operation upon the United States alone.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of our last treaty of peace with Great Britain was\r\nshortly afterwards followed by a commercial convention, placing the\r\ndirect intercourse between the two countries upon a footing of more\r\nequal reciprocity than had ever before been admitted. The same principle\r\nhas since been much further extended by treaties with France, Sweden,\r\nDenmark, the Hanseatic cities, Prussia, in Europe, and with the\r\nRepublics of Colombia and of Central America, in this hemisphere. The\r\nmutual abolition of discriminating duties and charges upon the\r\nnavigation and commercial intercourse between the parties is the general\r\nmaxim which characterizes them all. There is reason to expect that it\r\nwill at no distant period be adopted by other nations, both of Europe\r\nand America, and to hope that by its universal prevalence one of the\r\nfruitful sources of wars of commercial competition will be extinguished.\r\n\r\nAmong the nations upon whose Governments many of our fellow-citizens\r\nhave had long-pending claims of indemnity for depredations upon their\r\nproperty during a period when the rights of neutral commerce were\r\ndisregarded was that of Denmark. They were soon after the events\r\noccurred the subject of a special mission from the United States, at the\r\nclose of which the assurance was given by His Danish Majesty that at a\r\nperiod of more tranquillity and of less distress they would be\r\nconsidered, examined, and decided upon in a spirit of determined purpose\r\nfor the dispensation of justice. I have much pleasure in informing\r\nCongress that the fulfillment of this honorable promise is now in\r\nprogress; that a small portion of the claims has already been settled to\r\nthe satisfaction of the claimants, and that we have reason to hope that\r\nthe remainder will shortly be placed in a train of equitable adjustment.\r\nThis result has always been confidently expected, from the character of\r\npersonal integrity and of benevolence which the Sovereign of the Danish\r\ndominions has through every vicissitude of fortune maintained.\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of the affairs of our highborn American nations of\r\nthe south has been rather of approaching than of settled tranquillity.\r\nInternal disturbances have been more frequent among them than their\r\ncommon friends would have desired. Our intercourse with all has\r\ncontinued to be that of friendship and of mutual good will. Treaties of\r\ncommerce and of boundaries with the United Mexican States have been\r\nnegotiated, but, from various successive obstacles, not yet brought to a\r\nfinal conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe civil war which unfortunately still prevails in the Republics of\r\nCentral America has been unpropitious to the cultivation of our\r\ncommercial relations with them; and the dissensions and revolutionary\r\nchanges in the Republics of Colombia and of Peru have been seen with\r\ncordial regret by us, who would gladly contribute to the happiness of\r\nboth. It is with great satisfaction, however, that we have witnessed the\r\nrecent conclusion of a peace between the Governments of Buenos Ayres and\r\nof Brazil, and it is equally gratifying to observe that indemnity has\r\nbeen obtained for some of the injuries which our fellow-citizens had\r\nsustained in the latter of those countries. The rest are in a train of\r\nnegotiation, which we hope may terminate to mutual satisfaction, and\r\nthat it may be succeeded by a treaty of commerce and navigation, upon\r\nliberal principles, propitious to a great and growing commerce, already\r\nimportant to the interests of our country.\r\n\r\nThe condition and prospects of the revenue are more favorable than our\r\nmost sanguine expectations had anticipated. The balance in the Treasury\r\non the 1st of January last, exclusive of the moneys received under the\r\nconvention of 13th of November, 1826, with Great Britain, was\r\n$5,861,972.83. The receipts into the Treasury from the 1st of January to\r\nthe 30th of September last, so far as they have been ascertained to form\r\nthe basis of an estimate, amount to $18,633,580.27, which, with the\r\nreceipts of the present quarter, estimated at $5,461,283.40, form an\r\naggregate of receipts during the year of $24,094,863.67. The\r\nexpenditures of the year may probably amount to $25,637,111.63, and\r\nleave in the Treasury on the 1st of January next the sum of\r\n$5,125,638.14.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the present year have amounted to near two millions more\r\nthan was anticipated at the commencement of the last session of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe amount of duties secured on importations from the 1st of January to\r\nthe 30th of September was about $22,997,000, and that of the estimated\r\naccruing revenue is five millions, forming an aggregate for the year of\r\nnear twenty-eight millions. This is one million more than the estimate\r\nmade last December for the accruing revenue of the present year, which,\r\nwith allowances for drawbacks and contingent deficiencies, was expected\r\nto produce an actual revenue of $22,300,000. Had these only been\r\nrealized the expenditures of the year would have been also\r\nproportionally reduced, for of these twenty-four millions received\r\nupward of nine millions have been applied to the extinction of public\r\ndebt, bearing an interest of 6 per cent a year, and of course reducing\r\nthe burden of interest annually payable in future by the amount of more\r\nthan half a million. The payments on account of interest during the\r\ncurrent year exceed $3,000,000, presenting an aggregate of more than\r\ntwelve millions applied during the year to the discharge of the public\r\ndebt, the whole of which remaining due on the 1st of January next will\r\namount only to $58,362,135.78.\r\n\r\nThat the revenue of the ensuing year will not fall short of that\r\nreceived in the one now expiring there are indications which can\r\nscarcely prove deceptive. In our country an uniform experience of forty\r\nyears has shown that whatever the tariff of duties upon articles\r\nimported from abroad has been, the amount of importations has always\r\nborne an average value nearly approaching to that of the exports, though\r\noccasionally differing in the balance, sometimes being more and\r\nsometimes less. It is, indeed, a general law of prosperous commerce that\r\nthe real value of exports should by a small, and only a small, balance\r\nexceed that of imports, that balance being a permanent addition to the\r\nwealth of the nation. The extent of the prosperous commerce of the\r\nnation must be regulated by the amount of its exports, and an important\r\naddition to the value of these will draw after it a corresponding\r\nincrease of importations. It has happened in the vicissitudes of the\r\nseasons that the harvests of all Europe have in the late summer and\r\nautumn fallen short of their usual average. A relaxation of the\r\ninterdict upon the importation of grain and flour from abroad has\r\nensued, a propitious market has been opened to the granaries of our\r\ncountry, and a new prospect of reward presented to the labors of the\r\nhusbandman, which for several years has been denied. This accession to\r\nthe profits of agriculture in the middle and western portions of our\r\nUnion is accidental and temporary. It may continue only for a single\r\nyear. It may be, as has been often experienced in the revolutions of\r\ntime, but the first of several scanty harvests in succession. We may\r\nconsider it certain that for the approaching year it has added an item\r\nof large amount to the value of our exports and that it will produce a\r\ncorresponding increase of importations. It may therefore confidently be\r\nforeseen that the revenue of 1829 will equal and probably exceed that of\r\n1828, and will afford the means of extinguishing ten millions more of\r\nthe principal of the public debt.\r\n\r\nThis new element of prosperity to that part of our agricultural industry\r\nwhich is occupied in producing the first article of human subsistence is\r\nof the most cheering character to the feelings of patriotism. Proceeding\r\nfrom a cause which humanity will view with concern, the sufferings of\r\nscarcity in distant lands, it yields a consolatory reflection that this\r\nscarcity is in no respect attributable to us; that it comes from the\r\ndispensation of Him who ordains all in wisdom and goodness, and who\r\npermits evil itself only as an instrument of good; that, far from\r\ncontributing to this scarcity, our agency will be applied only to the\r\nalleviation of its severity, and that in pouring forth from the\r\nabundance of our own garners the supplies which will partially restore\r\nplenty to those who are in heed we shall ourselves reduce our stores and\r\nadd to the price of our own bread, so as in some degree to participate\r\nin the wants which it will be the good fortune of our country to\r\nrelieve.\r\n\r\nThe great interests of an agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing\r\nnation are so linked in union together that no permanent cause of\r\nprosperity to one of them can operate without extending its influence to\r\nthe others. All these interests are alike under the protecting power of\r\nthe legislative authority, and the duties of the representative bodies\r\nare to conciliate them in harmony together. So far as the object of\r\ntaxation is to raise a revenue for discharging the debts and defraying\r\nthe expenses of the community, its operation should be adapted as much\r\nas possible to suit the burden with equal hand upon all in proportion\r\nwith their ability of bearing it without oppression. But the legislation\r\nof one nation is sometimes intentionally made to bear heavily upon the\r\ninterests of another. That legislation, adapted, as it is meant to be,\r\nto the special interests of its own people, will often press most\r\nunequally upon the several component interests of its neighbors. Thus\r\nthe legislation of Great Britain, when, as has recently been avowed,\r\nadapted to the depression of a rival nation, will naturally abound with\r\nregulations of interdict upon the productions of the soil or industry of\r\nthe other which come in competition with its own, and will present\r\nencouragement, perhaps even bounty, to the raw material of the other\r\nState which it can not produce itself, and which is essential for the\r\nuse of its manufactures, competitors in the markets of the world with\r\nthose of its commercial rival. Such is the state of the commercial\r\nlegislation of Great Britain as it bears upon our interests. It excludes\r\nwith interdicting duties all importation (except in time of approaching\r\nfamine) of the great staple of productions of our Middle and Western\r\nStates; it proscribes with equal rigor the bulkier lumber and live stock\r\nof the same portion and also of the Northern and Eastern part of our\r\nUnion. It refuses even the rice of the South unless aggravated with a\r\ncharge of duty upon the Northern carrier who brings it to them. But the\r\ncotton, indispensable for their looms, they will receive almost duty\r\nfree to weave it into a fabric for our own wear, to the destruction of\r\nour own manufactures, which they are enabled thus to undersell.\r\n\r\nIs the self-protecting energy of this nation so helpless that there\r\nexists in the political institutions of our country no power to\r\ncounteract the bias of this foreign legislation; that the growers of\r\ngrain must submit to this exclusion from the foreign markets of their\r\nproduce; that the shippers must dismantle their ships, the trade of the\r\nNorth stagnate at the wharves, and the manufacturers starve at their\r\nlooms, while the whole people shall pay tribute to foreign industry to\r\nbe clad in a foreign garb; that the Congress of the Union are impotent\r\nto restore the balance in favor of native industry destroyed by the\r\nstatutes of another realm? More just and more generous sentiments will,\r\nI trust, prevail. If the tariff adopted at the last session of Congress\r\nshall be found by experience to bear oppressively upon the interests of\r\nany one section of the Union, it ought to be, and I can not doubt will\r\nbe, so modified as to alleviate its burden. To the voice of just\r\ncomplaint from any portion of their constituents the representatives of\r\nthe States and of the people will never turn away their ears. But so\r\nlong as the duty of the foreign shall operate only as a bounty upon the\r\ndomestic article; while the planter and the merchant and the shepherd\r\nand the husbandman shall be found thriving in their occupations under\r\nthe duties imposed for the protection of domestic manufactures, they\r\nwill not repine at the prosperity shared with themselves by their\r\nfellow-citizens of other professions, nor denounce as violations of the\r\nConstitution the deliberate acts of Congress to shield from the wrongs\r\nof foreign laws the native industry of the Union. While the tariff of\r\nthe last session of Congress was a subject of legislative deliberation\r\nit was foretold by some of its opposers that one of its necessary\r\nconsequences would be to impair the revenue. It is yet too soon to\r\npronounce with confidence that this prediction was erroneous. The\r\nobstruction of one avenue of trade not unfrequently opens an issue to\r\nanother. The consequence of the tariff will be to increase the\r\nexportation and to diminish the importation of some specific articles;\r\nbut by the general law of trade the increase of exportation of one\r\narticle will be followed by an increased importation of others, the\r\nduties upon which will supply the deficiencies which the diminished\r\nimportation would otherwise occasion. The effect of taxation upon\r\nrevenue can seldom be foreseen with certainty. It must abide the test of\r\nexperience. As yet no symptom? of diminution are perceptible in the\r\nreceipts of the Treasury. As yet little addition of cost has even been\r\nexperienced upon the articles burdened with heavier duties by the last\r\ntariff. The domestic manufacturer supplies the same or a kindred article\r\nat a diminished price, and the consumer pays the same tribute to the\r\nlabor of his own countryman which he must otherwise have paid to foreign\r\nindustry and toil.\r\n\r\nThe tariff of the last session was in its details not acceptable to the\r\ngreat interests of any portion of the Union, not even to the interest\r\nwhich it was specially intended to subserve. Its object was to balance\r\nthe burdens upon native industry imposed by the operation of foreign\r\nlaws, but not to aggravate the burdens of one section of the Union by\r\nthe relief afforded to another. To the great principle sanctioned by\r\nthat act--one of those upon which the Constitution itself was formed--I\r\nhope and trust the authorities of the Union will adhere. But if any of\r\nthe duties imposed by the act only relieve the manufacturer by\r\naggravating the burden of the planter, let a careful revisal of its\r\nprovisions, enlightened by the practical experience of its effects, be\r\ndirected to retain those which impart protection to native industry and\r\nremove or supply the place of those which only alleviate one great\r\nnational interest by the depression of another.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America and the people of every State of which they\r\nare composed are each of them sovereign powers. The legislative\r\nauthority of the whole is exercised by Congress under authority granted\r\nthem in the common Constitution. The legislative power of each State is\r\nexercised by assemblies deriving their authority from the constitution\r\nof the State. Each is sovereign within its own province. The\r\ndistribution of power between them presupposes that these authorities\r\nwill move in harmony with each other. The members of the State and\r\nGeneral Governments are all under oath to support both, and allegiance\r\nis due to the one and to the other. The case of a conflict between these\r\ntwo powers has not been supposed, nor has any provision been made for it\r\nin our institutions; as a virtuous nation of ancient times existed more\r\nthan five centuries without a law for the punishment of parricide.\r\n\r\nMore than once, however, in the progress of our history have the people\r\nand the legislatures of one or more States, in moments of excitement,\r\nbeen instigated to this conflict; and the means of effecting this\r\nimpulse have been allegations that the acts of Congress to be resisted\r\nwere _unconstitutional_. The people of no one State have ever delegated\r\nto their legislature the power of pronouncing an act of Congress\r\nunconstitutional, but they have delegated to them powers by the exercise\r\nof which the execution of the laws of Congress within the State may be\r\nresisted. If we suppose the case of such conflicting legislation\r\nsustained by the corresponding executive and judicial authorities,\r\npatriotism and philanthropy turn their eyes from the condition in which\r\nthe parties would be placed, and from that of the people of both, which\r\nmust be its victims.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the Secretary of War and the various subordinate\r\noffices of the resort of that Department present an exposition of the\r\npublic administration of affairs connected with them through the course\r\nof the current year. The present state of the Army and the distribution\r\nof the force of which it is composed will be seen from the report of the\r\nMajor-General. Several alterations in the disposal of the troops have\r\nbeen found expedient in the course of the year, and the discipline of\r\nthe Army, though not entirely free from exception, has been generally\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is particularly invited to that part of the\r\nreport of the Secretary of War which concerns the existing system of our\r\nrelations with the Indian tribes. At the establishment of the Federal\r\nGovernment under the present Constitution of the United States the\r\nprinciple was adopted of considering them as foreign and independent\r\npowers and also as proprietors of lands. They were, moreover, considered\r\nas savages, whom it was our policy and our duty to use our influence in\r\nconverting to Christianity and in bringing within the pale of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nAs independent powers, we negotiated with them by treaties; as\r\nproprietors, we purchased of them all the lands which we could prevail\r\nupon them to sell; as brethren of the human race, rude and ignorant, we\r\nendeavored to bring them to the knowledge of religion and of letters.\r\nThe ultimate design was to incorporate in our own institutions that\r\nportion of them which could be converted to the state of civilization.\r\nIn the practice of European States, before our Revolution, they had been\r\nconsidered _as children_ to be governed; as tenants at discretion, to be\r\ndispossessed as occasion might require; as hunters to be indemnified by\r\ntrifling concessions for removal from the grounds from which their game\r\nwas extirpated. In changing the system it would seem as if a full\r\ncontemplation of the consequences of the change had not been taken. We\r\nhave been far more successful in the acquisition of their lands than in\r\nimparting to them the principles or inspiring them with the spirit of\r\ncivilization. But in appropriating to ourselves their hunting grounds we\r\nhave brought upon ourselves the obligation of providing them with\r\nsubsistence; and when we have had the rare good fortune of teaching them\r\nthe arts of civilization and the doctrines of Christianity we have\r\nunexpectedly found them forming in the midst of ourselves communities\r\nclaiming to be independent of ours and rivals of sovereignty within the\r\nterritories of the members of our Union. This state of things requires\r\nthat a remedy should be provided--a remedy which, while it shall do\r\njustice to those unfortunate children of nature, may secure to the\r\nmembers of our confederation their rights of sovereignty and of soil. As\r\nthe outline of a project to that effect, the views presented in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of War are recommended to the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe report from the Engineer Department presents a comprehensive view of\r\nthe progress which has been made in the great systems promotive of the\r\npublic interest, commenced and organized under authority of Congress,\r\nand the effects of which have already contributed to the security, as\r\nthey will hereafter largely contribute to the honor and dignity, of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe first of these great systems is that of fortifications, commenced\r\nimmediately after the close of our last war, under the salutary\r\nexperience which the events of that war had impressed upon our\r\ncountrymen of its necessity. Introduced under the auspices of my\r\nimmediate predecessor, it has been continued with the persevering and\r\nliberal encouragement of the Legislature, and, combined with\r\ncorresponding exertions for the gradual increase and improvement of the\r\nNavy, prepares for our extensive country a condition of defense adapted\r\nto any critical emergency which the varying course of events may bring\r\nforth. Our advances in these concerted systems have for the last ten\r\nyears been steady and progressive, and in a few years more will be so\r\ncompleted as to leave no cause for apprehension that our seacoast will\r\never again offer a theater of hostile invasion.\r\n\r\nThe next of these cardinal measures of policy is the preliminary to\r\ngreat and lasting works of public improvement in the surveys of roads,\r\nexamination for the course of canals, and labors for the removal of the\r\nobstructions of rivers and harbors, first commenced by the act of\r\nCongress of 30th of April, 1824.\r\n\r\nThe report exhibits in one table the funds appropriated at the last and\r\npreceding sessions of Congress for all these fortifications, surveys,\r\nand works of public improvement, the manner in which these funds have\r\nbeen applied, the amount expended upon the several works under\r\nconstruction, and the further sums which may be necessary to complete\r\nthem; in a second, the works projected by the Board of Engineers which\r\nhave not been commenced, and the estimate of their cost; in a third, the\r\nreport of the annual Board of Visitors at the Military Academy at West\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\nFor thirteen fortifications erecting on various points of our Atlantic\r\ncoast, from Rhode Island to Louisiana, the aggregate expenditure of the\r\nyear has fallen little short of $1,000,000. For the preparation of five\r\nadditional reports of reconnaissances and surveys since the last session\r\nof Congress, for the civil constructions upon thirty-seven different\r\npublic works commenced, eight others for which specific appropriations\r\nhave been made by acts of Congress, and twenty other incipient surveys\r\nunder the authority given by the act of 30th April, 1824, about one\r\nmillion more of dollars has been drawn from the Treasury.\r\n\r\nTo these $2,000,000 is to be added the appropriation of $250,000 to\r\ncommence the erection of a breakwater near the mouth of the Delaware\r\nRiver, the subscriptions to the Delaware and Chesapeake, the Louisville\r\nand Portland, the Dismal Swamp, and the Chesapeake and Ohio canals, the\r\nlarge donations of lands to the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and\r\nAlabama for objects of improvements within those States, and the sums\r\nappropriated for light-houses, buoys, and piers on the coast; and a full\r\nview will be taken of the munificence of the nation in the application\r\nof its resources to the improvement of its own condition.\r\n\r\nOf these great national undertakings the Academy at West Point is among\r\nthe most important in itself and the most comprehensive in its\r\nconsequences. In that institution a part of the revenue of the nation is\r\napplied to defray the expense of educating a competent portion of her\r\nyouth chiefly to the knowledge and the duties of military life. It is\r\nthe living armory of the nation. While the other works of improvement\r\nenumerated in the reports now presented to the attention of Congress are\r\ndestined to ameliorate the face of nature, to multiply the facilities of\r\ncommunication between the different parts of the Union, to assist the\r\nlabors, increase the comforts, and enhance the enjoyments of\r\nindividuals, the instruction acquired at West Point enlarges the\r\ndominion and expands the capacities of the mind. Its beneficial results\r\nare already experienced in the composition of the Army, and their\r\ninfluence is felt in the intellectual progress of society. The\r\ninstitution is susceptible still of great improvement from benefactions\r\nproposed by several successive Boards of Visitors, to whose earnest and\r\nrepeated recommendations I cheerfully add my own.\r\n\r\nWith the usual annual reports from the Secretary of the Navy and the\r\nBoard of Commissioners will be exhibited to the view of Congress the\r\nexecution of the laws relating to that department of the public service.\r\nThe repression of piracy in the West Indian and in the Grecian seas has\r\nbeen effectually maintained, with scarcely any exception. During the war\r\nbetween the Governments of Buenos Ayres and of Brazil frequent\r\ncollisions between the belligerent acts of power and the rights of\r\nneutral commerce occurred. Licentious blockades, irregularly enlisted or\r\nimpressed seamen, and the property of honest commerce seized with\r\nviolence, and even plundered under legal pretenses, are disorders never\r\nseparable from the conflicts of war upon the ocean. With a portion of\r\nthem the correspondence of our commanders on the eastern aspect of the\r\nSouth American coast and among the islands of Greece discover how far we\r\nhave been involved. In these the honor of our country and the rights of\r\nour citizens have been asserted and vindicated. The appearance of new\r\nsquadrons in the Mediterranean and the blockade of the Dardanelles\r\nindicate the danger of other obstacles to the freedom of commerce and\r\nthe necessity of keeping our naval force in those seas. To the\r\nsuggestions repeated in the report of the Secretary of the Navy, and\r\ntending to the permanent improvement of this institution, I invite the\r\nfavorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nA resolution of the House of Representatives requesting that one of our\r\nsmall public vessels should be sent to the Pacific Ocean and South Sea\r\nto examine the coasts, islands, harbors, shoals, and reefs in those\r\nseas, and to ascertain their true situation and description, has been\r\nput in a train of execution. The vessel is nearly ready to depart. The\r\nsuccessful accomplishment of the expedition may be greatly facilitated\r\nby suitable legislative provisions, and particularly by an appropriation\r\nto defray its necessary expense. The addition of a second, and perhaps a\r\nthird, vessel, with a slight aggravation of the cost, would contribute\r\nmuch to the safety of the citizens embarked on this undertaking, the\r\nresults of which may be of the deepest interest to our country.\r\n\r\nWith the report of the Secretary of the Navy will be submitted, in\r\nconformity to the act of Congress of 3d March, 1827, for the gradual\r\nimprovement of the Navy of the United States, statements of the\r\nexpenditures under that act and of the measures taken for carrying the\r\nsame into effect. Every section of that statute contains a distinct\r\nprovision looking to the great object of the whole--the gradual\r\nimprovement of the Navy. Under its salutary sanction stores of ship\r\ntimber have been procured and are in process of seasoning and\r\npreservation for the future uses of the Navy. Arrangements have been\r\nmade for the preservation of the live-oak timber growing on the lands of\r\nthe United States, and for its reproduction, to supply at future and\r\ndistant days the waste of that most valuable material for shipbuilding\r\nby the great consumption of it yearly for the commercial as well as for\r\nthe military marine of our country. The construction of the two dry\r\ndocks at Charlestown and at Norfolk is making satisfactory progress\r\ntoward a durable establishment. The examinations and inquiries to\r\nascertain the practicability and expediency of a marine railway at\r\nPensacola, though not yet accomplished, have been postponed but to be\r\nmore effectually made. The navy-yards of the United States have been\r\nexamined, and plans for their improvement and the preservation of the\r\npublic property therein at Portsmouth, Charlestown, Philadelphia,\r\nWashington, and Gosport, and to which two others are to be added, have\r\nbeen prepared and received my sanction; and no other portion of my\r\npublic duties has been performed with a more intimate conviction of its\r\nimportance to the future welfare and security of the Union.\r\n\r\nWith the report from the Postmaster-General is exhibited a comparative\r\nview of the gradual increase of that establishment, from five to five\r\nyears, since 1792 till this time in the number of post-offices, which\r\nhas grown from less than 200 to nearly 8,000; in the revenue yielded by\r\nthem, which from $67,000 has swollen to upward of a million and a half,\r\nand in the number of miles of post-roads, which from 5,642 have\r\nmultiplied to 114,536. While in the same period of time the population\r\nof the Union has about thrice doubled, the rate of increase of these\r\noffices is nearly 40, and of the revenue and of traveled miles from 20\r\nto 25 for 1. The increase of revenue within the last five years has been\r\nnearly equal to the whole revenue of the Department in 1812.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the Department during the year which ended on the\r\n1st of July last have exceeded the receipts by a sum of about $25,000.\r\nThe excess has been occasioned by the increase of mail conveyances and\r\nfacilities to the extent of near 800,000 miles. It has been supplied by\r\ncollections from the postmasters of the arrearages of preceding years.\r\nWhile the correct principle seems to be that the income levied by the\r\nDepartment should defray all its expenses, it has never been the policy\r\nof this Government to raise from this establishment any revenue to be\r\napplied to any other purposes. The suggestion of the Postmaster-General\r\nthat the insurance of the safe transmission of moneys by the mail might\r\nbe assumed by the Department for a moderate and competent remuneration\r\nwill deserve the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nA report from the commissioner of the public buildings in this city\r\nexhibits the expenditures upon them in the course of the current year.\r\nIt will be seen that the humane and benevolent intentions of Congress in\r\nproviding, by the act of 20th May, 1826, for the erection of a\r\npenitentiary in this district have been accomplished. The authority of\r\nfurther legislation is now required for the removal to this tenement of\r\nthe offenders against the laws sentenced to atone by personal\r\nconfinement for their crimes, and to provide a code for their employment\r\nand government while thus confined.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed, conformably to the act of 2d March, 1827,\r\nto provide for the adjustment of claims of persons entitled to\r\nindemnification under the first article of the treaty of Ghent, and for\r\nthe distribution among such claimants of the sum paid by the Government\r\nof Great Britain under the convention of 13th of November, 1826, closed\r\ntheir labors on the 30th of August last by awarding to the claimants the\r\nsum of $1,197,422.18, leaving a balance of $7,537.82, which was\r\ndistributed ratably amongst all the claimants to whom awards had been\r\nmade, according to the directions of the act.\r\n\r\nThe exhibits appended to the report from the Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office present the actual condition of that common property of the\r\nUnion. The amount paid into the Treasury from the proceeds of lands\r\nduring the year 1827 and the first half of 1828 falls little short of\r\n$2,000,000. The propriety of further extending the time for the\r\nextinguishment of the debt due to the United States by the purchasers of\r\nthe public lands, limited by the act of 21st March last to the 4th of\r\nJuly next, will claim the consideration of Congress, to whose vigilance\r\nand careful attention the regulation, disposal, and preservation of this\r\ngreat national inheritance has by the people of the United States been\r\nintrusted.\r\n\r\nAmong the important subjects to which the attention of the present\r\nCongress has already been invited, and which may occupy their further\r\nand deliberate discussion, will be the provision to be made for taking\r\nthe fifth census or enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States.\r\nThe Constitution of the United States requires that this enumeration\r\nshould be made within every term of ten years, and the date from which\r\nthe last enumeration commenced was the first Monday of August of the\r\nyear 1820. The laws under which the former enumerations were taken were\r\nenacted at the session of Congress immediately preceding the operation;\r\nbut considerable inconveniences were experienced from the delay of\r\nlegislation to so late a period. That law, like those of the preceding\r\nenumerations, directed that the census should be taken by the marshals\r\nof the several districts and Territories of the Union under instructions\r\nfrom the Secretary of State. The preparation and transmission to the\r\nmarshals of those instructions required more time than was then allowed\r\nbetween the passage of the law and the day when the enumeration was to\r\ncommence. The term of six months limited for the returns of the marshals\r\nwas also found even then too short, and must be more so now, when an\r\nadditional population of at least 3,000,000 must be presented upon the\r\nreturns. As they are to be made at the short session of Congress, it\r\nwould, as well as from other considerations, be more convenient to\r\ncommence the enumeration from an earlier period of the year than the 1st\r\nof August. The most favorable season would be the spring. On a review of\r\nthe former enumerations it will be found that the plan for taking every\r\ncensus has contained many improvements upon that of its predecessor. The\r\nlast is still susceptible of much improvement. The Third Census was the\r\nfirst at which any account was taken of the manufactures of the country.\r\nIt was repeated at the last enumeration, but the returns in both cases\r\nwere necessarily very imperfect. They must always be so, resting, of\r\ncourse, only upon the communications voluntarily made by individuals\r\ninterested in some of the manufacturing establishments. Yet they\r\ncontained much valuable information, and may by some supplementary\r\nprovision of the law be rendered more effective. The columns of age,\r\ncommencing from infancy, have hitherto been confined to a few periods,\r\nall under the number of 45 years. Important knowledge would be obtained\r\nby extending these columns, in intervals of ten years, to the utmost\r\nboundaries of human life. The labor of taking them would be a trifling\r\naddition to that already prescribed, and the result would exhibit\r\ncomparative tables of longevity highly interesting to the country. I\r\ndeem it my duty further to observe that much of the imperfections in the\r\nreturns of the last and perhaps of preceding enumerations proceeded from\r\nthe inadequateness of the compensations allowed to the marshals and\r\ntheir assistants in taking them.\r\n\r\nIn closing this communication it only remains for me to assure the\r\nLegislature of my continued earnest wish for the adoption of measures\r\nrecommended by me heretofore and yet to be acted on by them, and of the\r\ncordial concurrence on my part in every constitutional provision which\r\nmay receive their sanction during the session tending to the general\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 8, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n2d of April last, I transmit a copy of the letter from the Cherokee\r\nCouncil to Colonel Hugh Montgomery, the agent, requested by the\r\nresolution, with a report[018] from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 8, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n23d of May last, I transmit a report from the Secretary of War, with\r\ndocuments, containing the information requested, relating to the\r\nharbors, roads, and other works of internal improvements undertaken and\r\nprojected since the 30th April, 1824.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 8, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the Senate, for their advice with regard to its\r\nratification, a treaty made and concluded at the missionary\r\nestablishment upon the St. Joseph of Lake Michigan the 20th day of\r\nSeptember last, between Lewis Cass and Pierre Menard, commissioners of\r\nthe United States, and the Potawatamie tribe of Indians, the journal and\r\nreport of the commissioners accompanying the treaty.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 8, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of War, with\r\ndocuments, prepared in compliance with their resolution of the 26th of\r\nMay last, concerning the practicability and probable cost of\r\nconstructing an artificial harbor, commonly called a \"breakwater,\" at or\r\nnear the mouth of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 9, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed report from the Secretary of State and subjoined documents\r\nare transmitted to the Senate in compliance with their resolution of\r\n25th April last, requesting information concerning the number of free\r\ntaxable inhabitants _who are not freeholders_ in certain States and\r\nTerritories of the Union.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 15, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n8th instant, referring to a negotiation of the British Government, by\r\nvirtue of a resolution of the House of the 10th of May last, relative to\r\nthe surrender of fugitive slaves, I transmit herewith a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, with copies of instructions and correspondence,\r\ncontaining the desired information.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_December 15, 1828_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their constitutional advice, an additional\r\narticle, signed on the 4th day of June last, to the convention of\r\nfriendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States and the\r\nHanseatic Republics of Lubeck, Bremen, and Hamburg concluded at this\r\nplace on the 20th December, 1827.

By the\r\nsame act the President of the United States was authorized to appoint a\r\nlaw agent to superintend the interests of the United States in the\r\npremises, and to employ assistant counsel if in his opinion the public\r\ninterest should require the same.\r\n\r\nIn the process of carrying into execution this law it was the opinion of\r\nthe Attorney-General of the United States that a translated complete\r\ncollection of all the Spanish and French ordinances, etc., affecting the\r\nland titles in Florida and the other territories heretofore belonging to\r\nFrance and Spain, would be indispensable to a just decision of those\r\nclaims by the Supreme Court. At his suggestion the task of preparing\r\nthis compilation was undertaken by Joseph M. White, of Florida, who was\r\nemployed as assistant counsel in behalf of the United States. The\r\ncollection has accordingly been made and is deposited in manuscript at\r\nthe Department of State, subject to such order as Congress may see fit\r\nto take concerning it. The letter from Mr. White to the Secretary of\r\nState, with a descriptive list of the documents collected and thus\r\ndeposited, is herewith transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 16, 1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 5th instant,\r\nrequesting detailed statements of the expenses incurred and of those\r\nwhich may be necessary for the expedition proposed for exploring the\r\nPacific Ocean and South Seas, and also of the several amounts\r\ntransferred from the different heads of appropriation for the support of\r\nthe Navy to this object and the authority by which such transfers have\r\nbeen made, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nwith documents, from which the Senate will perceive that no such\r\ntransfer has been made, and which contain the other information desired\r\nby the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 20, 1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 10th instant,\r\nrequesting copies of correspondence and communications from 20th\r\nOctober, 1816, to 24th November, 1817, received at the Department of\r\nState from the American commissioner under the fourth article of the\r\ntreaty of Ghent, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of\r\nState, with the copies of papers mentioned in the resolution.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 20, 1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwith documents, prepared in pursuance of their resolution of the 31st of\r\nDecember last, and showing the amount of expenses incurred in the\r\nsurvey, sale, and management of the public lands for the year 1827.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 25,1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBy the act of Congress of the 3d March, 1826, for the survey of a route\r\nfor a canal between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, the President\r\nof the United States was authorized to cause to be made an accurate and\r\nminute examination of the country south of the St. Marys River, and\r\nincluding the same, with a view to ascertain the most eligible route for\r\na canal admitting the transit of boats to connect the Atlantic with the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and also with a view to ascertain the practicability of\r\na ship channel; that he cause particularly to be examined the route to\r\nthe Appalachicola River or Bay, with a view to both the above objects;\r\nthat he cause the necessary surveys, both by land and along the coast,\r\nwith estimates of the expense of each, accompanied with proper plans,\r\nnotes, observations, explanations, and opinions of the Board of\r\nEngineers, and that he cause a full report of these proceedings to be\r\nmade to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn execution of this law I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary\r\nof War, with a copy of that of the Board of Engineers, upon this great\r\nand most desirable national work. The time not having allowed a copy to\r\nbe taken of the map, one copy only of the whole report is transmitted to\r\nthe Senate, with the request that it may be communicated to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and that the map may be ultimately returned to the\r\nDepartment of War.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 26, 1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 20th instant, I\r\ntransmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, with the\r\ninspection reports of Brevet Major-General Gaines for the years 1826 and\r\n1827, relating to the organization of the Army and militia of the United\r\nStates, with the request that the original documents may be returned to\r\nthe Department of War at the convenience of the Senate.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 26,1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their constitutional advice with\r\nregard to its ratification, a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation\r\nbetween the United States and His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, signed\r\nby the plenipotentiaries of the respective Governments at Rio de Janeiro\r\non the 12th day of December last. A copy of the treaty is likewise\r\ninclosed, with copies of the instructions under which it was negotiated\r\nand a letter from Mr. Tudor elucidating some of its provisions. It is\r\nrequested that at the convenience of the Senate the original papers may\r\nbe returned to the Department of State.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 28, 1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress copies of two Indian treaties, which have duly\r\nratified:\r\n\r\n1. A treaty with the Chippewa, Menominie, and Winnebago Indians,\r\nconcluded on the 11th of August, 1827, at the Butte des Morts, on Fox\r\nRiver, in the Territory of Michigan, between Lewis Cass and Thomas L.\r\nMcKenney, commissioners on the part of the United States, and certain\r\nchiefs and warriors of the said tribes on their part.\r\n\r\n2. A treaty with the Potawatamie tribe of Indians, concluded the 19th of\r\nSeptember, 1827, at St. Joseph, in the Territory of Michigan, between\r\nLewis Cass, commissioner on the part of the United States, and the\r\nchiefs and warriors of the said tribes, on their part.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_February 28, 1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n21st instant, requesting any information in my possession as to the\r\npractical operation of the recent act of the British Parliament entitled\r\n\"The customs amendment act,\" purporting a discrimination of duties upon\r\nthe importation of cotton from the British North American colonies and\r\nshowing how far this discrimination may affect existing treaties, I\r\ntransmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with copies of\r\nthe instructions and correspondence of the minister of the United States\r\nat London, containing the information requested.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_March 3, 1829_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to Congress a copy of the instructions prepared by\r\nthe Secretary of State and furnished to the ministers of the United\r\nStates appointed to attend at the assembly of American plenipotentiaries\r\nfirst held at Panama and thence transferred to Tacubaya. The occasion\r\nupon which they were given has passed away, and there is no present\r\nprobability of the renewal of the negotiations; but the purposes for\r\nwhich they were intended are still of the deepest interest to our\r\ncountry and to the world, and may hereafter call again for the active\r\nefforts and beneficent energies of the Government of the United States.\r\nThe motives for withholding them from general publication having ceased,\r\njustice to the Government from which they emanated and to the people for\r\nwhose benefit it was instituted requires that they should be made known.\r\nWith this view, and from the consideration that the subjects embraced by\r\nthese instructions must probably engage hereafter the deliberations of\r\nour successors, I deem it proper to make this communication to both\r\nHouses of Congress. One copy only of the instructions being prepared, I\r\nsend it to the Senate, requesting that it may be transmitted to the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n(From Senate Journal, Twentieth Congress, second session, p. 196.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington,\r\n_January 12, 1829_\r\n\r\n\r\n_The President of the United States to--, Senator for the State of--_:\r\n\r\nCertain matters touching the public good requiring that the Senate of\r\nthe United States should be convened on Wednesday, the 4th day of March\r\nnext, you are desired to attend at the Senate Chamber, in the city of\r\nWashington, on that day, then and there to receive and deliberate on\r\nsuch communications as shall be made to you.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 001: See Vol. I, pp. 352 to 354, inclusive.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 002: Relating to the proposed congress at Panama.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 003: Relating to land warrants issued to soldiers of the\r\nRevolutionary war, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 004: Relating to intervention of the Emperor of Russia with\r\nSpain for a recognition of the independence of the South American\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 005: Relating to the proposed congress of the Spanish American\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 006: Relative to governments to be represented at the congress\r\nat Panama.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 007 and 007a: Respecting the right of a foreign minister to\r\nretain money advanced by the President as an outfit beyond the sum\r\nappropriated by law.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 008: Relating to the negotiations with Great Britain for a\r\ncession of certain keys on the Bahama Banks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 009: Referred to in the protocol of the third conference of\r\nthe American and British plenipotentiaries on February 5, 1824, relating\r\nto trade with Great Britain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 010: Concerning the assembly of American ministers at\r\nTacubaya, Mexico]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 011 Relating to the conflicting claims of Georgia and the\r\nCreek Indians to lands in Georgia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 012: Relating to the conflicting claims of Georgia and the\r\nCreek Indians to lands in Georgia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 013: Relating to the northeastern boundary of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 014: Relating to the detention of American vessels by the\r\nnaval forces of Brazil.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 015: Relating to the war between Spain and her colonies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 016: By the authorities of the Province of New Brunswick.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 017: Relating to alleged blockade by the naval forces of\r\nBrazil, imprisonment of American citizens by Brazil, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 018: Relating to a survey for a canal through the Cherokee\r\ncountry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 019: Relating to claims of Georgia and the Creek Indians under\r\nthe treaty of 1821, held at Indian Springs.]",
