The first Navigation Act required that colonial exports should\r\nbe shipped to England in American or English vessels. This was followed\r\nby a long series of acts, regulating and restricting the American trade.\r\nColonists were not allowed to exchange certain articles without\r\npaying duties thereon, and custom houses were established and officers\r\nappointed. Opposition to these proceedings was ineffectual; and in 1696,\r\nin order to expedite the business of taxation, and to establish a better\r\nmethod of ruling the colonies, a board was appointed, called the Lords\r\nCommissioners for Trade and Plantations. The royal governors found\r\nin this board ready sympathizers, and were not slow to report their\r\ngrievances, and to insist upon more stringent regulations for enforcing\r\nobedience. Some of the retaliative measures employed were the suspension\r\nof the writ of habeas corpus, the abridgment of the freedom of the press\r\nand the prohibition of elections. But the colonists generally succeeded\r\nin having their own way in the end, and were not wholly without\r\nencouragement and sympathy in the English Parliament. It may be that\r\nthe war with France, which ended with the fall of Quebec, had much to do\r\nwith this rather generous treatment. The Americans, too, were favored by\r\nthe Whigs, who had been in power for more than seventy years. The policy\r\nof this great party was not opposed to the sentiments and ideas of\r\npolitical freedom that had grown up in the colonies; and, although more\r\nthan half of the Navigation Acts were passed by Whig governments, the\r\nleaders had known how to wink at the violation of nearly all of them.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the close of the French war, and after George III. had\r\nascended the throne of England, it was decided to enforce the Navigation\r\nActs rigidly. There was to be no more smuggling, and, to prevent this,\r\nWrits of Assistance were issued. Armed with such authority, a servant of\r\nthe king might enter the home of any citizen, and make a thorough search\r\nfor smuggled goods. It is needless to say the measure was resisted\r\nvigorously, and its reception by the colonists, and its effect upon\r\nthem, has been called the opening scene of the American Revolution. As a\r\nmatter of fact, this sudden change in the attitude of England toward the\r\ncolonies, marks the beginning of the policy of George III. which, had it\r\nbeen successful, would have made him the ruler of an absolute instead\r\nof a limited monarchy. He hated the Tories only less than the Whigs,\r\nand when he bestowed a favor upon either, it was for the purpose of\r\nweakening the other. The first task he set himself was that of crushing\r\nthe Whigs. Since the Revolution of 1688, they had dictated the policy of\r\nthe English government, and through wise leaders had become supreme\r\nin authority. They were particularly obnoxious to him because of their\r\nrepublican spirit, and he regarded their ascendency as a constant menace\r\nto his kingly power. Fortune seemed to favor him in the dissensions\r\nwhich arose. There grew up two factions in the Whig party. There were\r\nold Whigs and new Whigs. George played one against the other, advanced\r\nhis favorites when opportunity offered, and in the end succeeded in\r\nforming a ministry composed of his friends and obedient to his will.\r\n\r\nWith the ministry safely in hand, he turned his attention to the House\r\nof Commons. The old Whigs had set an example, which George was shrewd\r\nenough to follow. Walpole and Newcastle had succeeded in giving England\r\none of the most peaceful and prosperous governments within in the\r\nprevious history of the nation, but their methods were corrupt. With\r\nmuch of the judgment, penetration and wise forbearance which marks a\r\nstatesman, Walpole's distinctive qualities of mind eminently fitted\r\nhim for political intrigue; Newcastle was still worse, and has the\r\ndistinction of being the premier under whose administration the revolt\r\nagainst official corruption first received the support of the public.\r\n\r\nFor near a hundred years, the territorial distribution of seats in the\r\nHouse had remained the same, while the centres of population had shifted\r\nalong with those of trade and new industries. Great towns were without\r\nrepresentation, while boroughs, such as Old Sarum, without a single\r\nvoter, still claimed, and had, a seat in Parliament. Such districts,\r\nor \"rotten boroughs,\" were owned and controlled by many of the great\r\nlandowners. Both Walpole and Newcastle resorted to the outright purchase\r\nof these seats, and when the time came George did not shrink from doing\r\nthe same thing. He went even further. All preferments of whatsoever sort\r\nwere bestowed upon those who would do his bidding, and the business\r\nof bribery assumed such proportions that an office was opened at the\r\nTreasury for this purpose, from which twenty-five thousand pounds are\r\nsaid to have passed in a single day. Parliament had been for a long\r\ntime only partially representative of the people; it now ceased to be so\r\nalmost completely.\r\n\r\nWith, the support which such methods secured, along with encouragement\r\nfrom his ministers, the king was prepared to put in operation his policy\r\nfor regulating the affairs of America. Writs of Assistance (1761) were\r\nfollowed by the passage of the Stamp Act (1765). The ostensible object\r\nof both these measures was to help pay the debt incurred by the French\r\nwar, but the real purpose lay deeper, and was nothing more or less than\r\nthe ultimate extension of parliamentary rule, in great things as well as\r\nsmall, to America. At this crisis, so momentous for the colonists, the\r\nRockingham ministry was formed, and Burke, together with Pitt, supported\r\na motion for the unconditional repeal of the Stamp Act. After much\r\nwrangling, the motion was carried, and the first blunder of the mother\r\ncountry seemed to have been smoothed over.\r\n\r\nOnly a few months elapsed, however, when the question of taxing the\r\ncolonies was revived. Pitt lay ill, and could take no part in the\r\nproposed measure. Through the influence of other members of his\r\nparty,--notably Townshend,--a series of acts were passed, imposing\r\nduties on several exports to America. This was followed by a suspension\r\nof the New York Assembly, because it had disregarded instructions in the\r\nmatter of supplies for the troops. The colonists were furious. Matters\r\nwent from bad to worse. To withdraw as far as possible without yielding\r\nthe principle at stake, the duties on all the exports mentioned in\r\nthe bill were removed, except that on tea. But it was precisely the\r\nprinciple for which the colonists were contending. They were not in the\r\nhumor for compromise, when they believed their freedom was endangered,\r\nand the strength and determination of their resistance found a climax in\r\nthe Boston Tea Party.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Lord North, who was absolutely obedient to the king,\r\nhad become prime minister. Five bills were prepared, the tenor of which,\r\nit was thought, would overawe the colonists. Of these, the Boston Port\r\nBill and the Regulating Act are perhaps the most famous, though the\r\nultimate tendency of all was blindly coercive.\r\n\r\nWhile the king and his friends were busy with these, the opposition\r\nproposed an unconditional repeal of the Tea Act. The bill was introduced\r\nonly to be overwhelmingly defeated by the same Parliament that passed\r\nthe five measures of Lord North.\r\n\r\nIn America, the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been\r\nexpected by thinking men. The colonies were as a unit in their support\r\nof Massachusetts. The Regulating Act was set at defiance, public\r\nofficers in the king's service were forced to resign, town meetings\r\nwere held, and preparations for war were begun in dead earnest. To avert\r\nthis, some of England's greatest statesmen--Pitt among the number--asked\r\nfor a reconsideration. On February the first, 1775, a bill was\r\nintroduced, which would have gone far toward bringing peace. One month\r\nlater, Burke delivered his speech on Conciliation with the Colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE\r\n\r\nThere is nothing unusual in Burke's early life. He was born in Dublin,\r\nIreland, in 1729. His father was a successful lawyer and a Protestant,\r\nhis mother, a Catholic. At the age of twelve, he became a pupil of\r\nAbraham Shackleton, a Quaker, who had been teaching some fifteen years\r\nat Ballitore, a small town thirty miles from Dublin. In after years\r\nBurke was always pleased to speak of his old friend in the kindest way:\r\n\"If I am anything,\" he declares, \"it is the education I had there that\r\nhas made me so.\" And again at Shackleton's death, when Burke was near\r\nthe zenith of his fame and popularity, he writes: \"I had a true\r\nhonor and affection for that excellent man. I feel something like a\r\nsatisfaction in the midst of my concern, that I was fortunate enough to\r\nhave him under my roof before his departure.\" It can hardly be doubted\r\nthat the old Quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was\r\nalready so favorably inclined, and it is more than probable that the\r\ndaily example of one who lived out his precepts was strong in its\r\ninfluence upon a young and generous mind.\r\n\r\nBurke attended school at Ballitore two years; then, at the age of\r\nfourteen, he became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, and remained\r\nthere five years. At college he was unsystematic and careless of\r\nroutine. He seems to have done pretty much as he pleased, and, however\r\nmethodical he became in after life, his study during these five years\r\nwas rambling and spasmodic. The only definite knowledge we have of this\r\nperiod is given by Burke himself in letters to his former friend Richard\r\nShackleton, son of his old schoolmaster. What he did was done with a\r\nzest that at times became a feverish impatience: \"First I was greatly\r\ntaken with natural philosophy, which, while I should have given my mind\r\nto logic, employed me incessantly. This I call my FUROR MATHEMATICUS.\"\r\nFollowing in succession come his FUROR LOGICUS, FUROR HISTORICUS, and\r\nFUROR PEOTICUS, each of which absorbed him for the time being. It would\r\nbe wrong, however, to think of Burke as a trifler even in his youth. He\r\nread in the library three hours every day and we may be sure he read as\r\nintelligently as eagerly. It is more than probable that like a few other\r\ngreat minds he did not need a rigid system to guide him. If he chose\r\nhis subjects of study at pleasure, there is every reason to believe he\r\nmastered them.\r\n\r\nOf intimate friends at the University we hear nothing. Goldsmith came\r\none year later, but there is no evidence that they knew each other. It\r\nis probable that Burke, always reserved, had little in common with his\r\nyoung associates. His own musings, with occasional attempts at writing\r\npoetry, long walks through the country, and frequent letters to and from\r\nRichard Shackleton, employed him when not at his books.\r\n\r\nTwo years after taking his degree, Burke went to London and established\r\nhimself at the Middle Temple for the usual routine course in law.\r\nAnother long period passes of which there is next to nothing known.\r\nHis father, an irascible, hot-tempered man, had wished him to begin the\r\npractice of law, but Burke seems to have continued in a rather irregular\r\nway pretty much as when an undergraduate at Dublin. His inclinations\r\nwere not toward the law, but literature. His father, angered at such a\r\nturn of affairs, promptly reduced his allowance and left him to follow\r\nhis natural bent in perfect freedom. In 1756, six years after his\r\narrival in London, and almost immediately following the rupture with his\r\nfather, he married a Miss Nugent. At about the same time he published\r\nhis first two books, [Footnote: A Vindication of Natural Society and\r\nPhilosophical Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and\r\nBeautiful] and began in earnest the life of an author.\r\n\r\nHe attracted the attention of literary men. Dr. Johnson had just\r\ncompleted his famous dictionary, and was the centre of a group of\r\nwriters who accepted him at his own valuation. Burke did not want for\r\ncompany, and wrote copiously.[Footnote: Hints for an Essay on the\r\nDrama. Abridgement of the History of England] He became associated with\r\nDodsley, a bookseller, who began publishing the Annual Register in 1759,\r\nand was paid a hundred pounds a year for writing upon current events.\r\nHe spent two years (1761-63) in Ireland in the employment of William\r\nHamilton, but at the end of that time returned, chagrined and disgusted\r\nwith his would-be patron, who utterly failed to recognize Burke's worth,\r\nand persisted in the most unreasonable demands upon his time and energy.\r\n\r\nFor once Burke's independence served him well. In 1765 Lord Rockingham\r\nbecame prime minister, and Burke, widely known as the chief writer\r\nfor the Annual Register, was free to accept the position of private\r\nsecretary, which Lord Rockingham was glad to offer him. His services\r\nhere were invaluable. The new relations thus established did not end\r\nwith the performance of the immediate duties of his office, but a warm\r\nfriendship grew up between the two, which lasted till the death of Lord\r\nRockingham. While yet private secretary, Burke was elected to Parliament\r\nfrom the borough of Wendover. It was through the influence of his\r\nfriend, or perhaps relative, William Burke, that his election was\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days after taking his seat in the House of Commons, Burke\r\nmade his first speech, January 27, 1766. He followed this in a very\r\nshort time with another upon the same subject--the Taxation of the\r\nAmerican Colonies. Notwithstanding the great honor and distinction which\r\nthese first speeches brought Burke, his party was dismissed at the close\r\nof the session and the Chatham ministry formed. He remained with his\r\nfriends, and employed himself in refuting [Footnote: Observations on the\r\nPresent State of the Nation] the charges of the former minister, George\r\nGrenville, who wrote a pamphlet accusing his successors of gross neglect\r\nof public duties.\r\n\r\nAt this point in his life comes the much-discussed matter of\r\nBeaconsfield. How Burke became rich enough to purchase such expensive\r\nproperty is a question that has never been answered by his friends or\r\nenemies. There are mysterious hints of successful speculation in East\r\nIndia stock, of money borrowed, and Burke himself, in a letter to\r\nShackleton, speaks of aid from his friends and \"all [the money] he\r\ncould collect of his own.\" However much we may regret the air of mystery\r\nsurrounding the matter, and the opportunity given those ever ready to\r\nsmirch a great man's character, it is not probable that any one ever\r\nreally doubted Burke's integrity in this or any other transaction.\r\nPerhaps the true explanation of his seemingly reckless extravagance (if\r\nany explanation is needed) is that the conventional standards of his\r\ntime forced it upon him; and it may be that Burke himself sympathized\r\nto some extent with these standards, and felt a certain satisfaction in\r\nmaintaining a proper attitude before the public.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated case of Wilkes offered an opportunity for discussing\r\nthe narrow and corrupt policy pursued by George III. and his followers.\r\nWilkes, outlawed for libel and protected in the meantime through legal\r\ntechnicalities, was returned to Parliament by Middlesex. The House\r\nexpelled him. He was repeatedly elected and as many times expelled, and\r\nfinally the returns were altered, the House voting its approval by a\r\nlarge majority. In 1770 Burke published his pamphlet [Footnote: Present\r\nDiscontents] in which he discussed the situation. For the first time he\r\nshowed the full sweep and breadth of his understanding. His tract was\r\nin the interest of his party, but it was written in a spirit far removed\r\nfrom narrow partisanship. He pointed out with absolute clearness the\r\ncause of dissatisfaction and unrest among the people and charged George\r\nIII. and his councillors with gross indifference to the welfare of the\r\nnation and corresponding devotion to selfish interests. He contended\r\nthat Parliament was usurping privileges when it presumed to expel any\r\none, that the people had a right to send whomsoever they pleased to\r\nParliament, and finally that \"in all disputes between them and their\r\nrulers, the presumption was at least upon a par in favor of the\r\npeople.\" From this time until the American Revolution, Burke used every\r\nopportunity to denounce the policy which the king was pursuing at home\r\nand abroad. He doubtless knew beforehand that what he might say would\r\npass unnoticed, but he never faltered in a steadfast adherence to\r\nhis ideas of government, founded, as he believed, upon the soundest\r\nprinciples. Bristol elected him as its representative in Parliament. It\r\nwas a great honor and Burke felt its significance, yet he did not flinch\r\nwhen the time came for him to take a stand. He voted for the removal\r\nof some of the restrictions upon Irish trade. His constituents,\r\nrepresenting one of the most prosperous mercantile districts, angered\r\nand disappointed at what they held to be a betrayal of trust, refused to\r\nreelect him.\r\n\r\nLord North's ministry came to an end in 1782, immediately after the\r\nbattle of Yorktown, and Lord Rockingham was chosen prime minister.\r\nBurke's past services warranted him in expecting an important place in\r\nthe cabinet, but he was ignored. Various things have been suggested\r\nas reasons for this: he was poor; some of his relations and intimate\r\nassociates were objectionable; there were dark hints of speculations; he\r\nwas an Irishman. It is possible that any one of these facts, or all of\r\nthem, furnished a good excuse for not giving him an important position\r\nin the new government. But it seems more probable that Burke's abilities\r\nwere not appreciated so justly as they have been since. The men with\r\nwhom he associated saw some of his greatness but not all of it. He\r\nwas assigned the office of Paymaster of Forces, a place of secondary\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nLord Rockingham died in three months and the party went to pieces. Burke\r\nrefused to work under Shelburne, and, with Fox, joined Lord North in\r\nforming the coalition which overthrew the Whig party. Burke has been\r\nseverely censured for the part he took in this. Perhaps there is little\r\nexcuse for his desertion, and it is certainly true that his course\r\nraises the question of his sincere devotion to principles. His personal\r\ndislike of Shelburne was so intense that he may have yielded to his\r\nfeelings. He felt hurt, too, we may be sure, at the disposition made of\r\nhim by his friends. In replying to a letter asking him for a place\r\nin the new government, he writes that his correspondent has been\r\nmisinformed. \"I make no part of the ministerial arrangement,\" he writes,\r\nand adds, \"Something in the official line may be thought fit for my\r\nmeasure.\"\r\n\r\nAs a supporter of the coalition, Burke was one of the framers of\r\nthe India Bill. This was directed against the wholesale robbery and\r\ncorruption which the East India Company had been guilty of in its\r\ngovernment of the country. Both Fox and Burke defended the measure with\r\nall the force and power which a thorough mastery of facts, a keen sense\r\nof the injustice done an unhappy people, and a splendid rhetoric\r\ncan give. But it was doomed from the first. The people at large were\r\nindifferent, many had profitable business relations with the company,\r\nand the king used his personal influence against it. The bill failed to\r\npass, the coalition was dismissed, and the party, which had in Burke its\r\ngreatest representative, was utterly ruined.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the India Bill marked a victory for the king, and it\r\nalso prepared the way for one of the most famous transactions of Burke's\r\nlife. Macaulay has told how impressive and magnificent was the scene\r\nat the trial of Warren Hastings. There were political reasons for the\r\nimpeachment, but the chief motive that stirred Burke was far removed\r\nfrom this. He saw and understood the real state of affairs in India. The\r\nmismanagement, the brutal methods, and the crimes committed there in the\r\nname of the English government, moved him profoundly, and when he rose\r\nbefore the magnificent audience at Westminster, for opening the cause,\r\nhe forced his hearers, by his own mighty passion, to see with his own\r\neyes, and to feel his own righteous anger. \"When he came to his two\r\nnarratives,\" says Miss Burney, \"when he related the particulars of those\r\ndreadful murders, he interested, he engaged, he at last overpowered me;\r\nI felt my cause lost. I could hardly keep my seat. My eyes dreaded a\r\nsingle glance toward a man so accused as Mr. Hastings; I wanted to sink\r\non the floor, that they might be saved so painful a sight. I had no hope\r\nhe could clear himself; not another wish in his favor remained.\" The\r\ntrial lasted for six years and ended with the acquittal of Hastings. The\r\nresult was not a surprise, and least of all to Burke. The fate of the\r\nIndia Bill had taught him how completely indifferent the popular mind\r\nwas to issues touching deep moral questions. Though a seeming failure,\r\nhe regarded the impeachment as the greatest work of his life. It did\r\nmuch to arouse and stimulate the national sense of justice. It\r\nmade clear the cruel methods sometimes pursued under the guise of\r\ncivilization and progress. The moral victory is claimed for Burke, and\r\nwithout a doubt the claim is valid.\r\n\r\nThe second of the great social and political problems, which employed\r\nEnglish statesmen in the last half of the eighteenth century, was\r\nsettled in the impeachment of Warren Hastings. The affairs of America\r\nand India were now overshadowed by the French Revolution, and Burke,\r\nwith the far-sighted vision of a veteran statesman, watched the progress\r\nof events and their influence upon the established order. In 1773 he had\r\nvisited France, and had returned displeased. It is remarkable with what\r\naccuracy he pointed out the ultimate tendency of much that he saw. A\r\nclose observer of current phases of society, and on the alert to explain\r\nthem in the light of broad and fundamental principles of human progress,\r\nhe had every opportunity for studying social life at the French capital.\r\nUnlike the younger men of his times, he was doubtful, and held his\r\njudgment in suspense. The enthusiasm of even Fox seemed premature, and\r\nhe held himself aloof from the popular demonstrations of admiration and\r\napproval that were everywhere going on. The fact is, Burke was growing\r\nold, and with his years he was becoming more conservative. He dreaded\r\nchange, and was suspicious of the wisdom of those who set about such\r\nwidespread innovations, and made such brilliant promises for the future.\r\nBut the time rapidly approached for him to declare himself, and in 1790\r\nhis Reflections on the Revolution in France was issued. His friends\r\nhad long waited its appearance, and were not wholly surprised at the\r\nposition taken. What did surprise them was the eagerness with which the\r\npeople seized upon the book, and its effect upon them. The Tories, with\r\nthe king, applauded long and loud; the Whigs were disappointed, for\r\nBurke condemned the Revolution unreservedly, and with a bitterness\r\nout of all proportion to the cause of his anxiety and fear. As the\r\nRevolution progressed, he grew fiercer in his denunciation. He broke\r\nwith his lifelong associates, and declared that no one who sympathized\r\nwith the work of the Assembly could be his friend. His other writings\r\non the Revolution [Footnote: Letter to a Member of the National Assembly\r\nand Letters on a Regicide Peace.] were in a still more violent strain,\r\nand it is hard to think of them as coming from the author of the Speech\r\non Conciliation.\r\n\r\nThree years before his death, at the conclusion of the trial of Warren\r\nHastings, Burke's last term in Parliament expired. He did not wish\r\noffice again and withdrew to his estate. Through the influence of\r\nfriends, and because of his eminent services, it was proposed to make\r\nhim peer, with the title of Lord Beacons field. But the death of his son\r\nprevented, and a pension of twenty-five hundred pounds a year was given\r\ninstead. It was a signal for his enemies, and during his last days he\r\nwas busy with his reply. The \"Letter to a Noble Lord,\" though written\r\nlittle more than a year before his death, is considered one of the most\r\nperfect of his papers. Saddened by the loss of his son, and broken in\r\nspirits, there is yet left him enough old-time energy and fire to answer\r\nhis detractors. But his wonderful career was near its close. His last\r\nmonths were spent in writing about the French Revolution, and the third\r\nletter on a Regicide Peace--a fragment--was doubtless composed just\r\nbefore his death. On the 9th of July, 1797, he passed away. His friends\r\nclaimed for him a place in Westminster, but his last wish was respected,\r\nand he was buried at Beaconsfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURKE AS A STATESMAN\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a political tract or pamphlet of Burke's in which he\r\ndoes not state, in terms more or less clear, the fundamental principle\r\nin his theory of government. \"Circumstances,\" he says in one place,\r\n\"give, in reality, to every political principle, its distinguishing\r\ncolor and discriminating effect. The circumstances are what renders\r\nevery civil and political scheme beneficial or obnoxious to mankind.\" At\r\nanother time he exclaims: \"This is the true touchstone of all theories\r\nwhich regard man and the affairs of men; does it suit his nature in\r\ngeneral, does it suit his nature as modified by his habits?\" And again\r\nhe extends his system to affairs outside the realm of politics. \"All\r\ngovernment,\" he declares, \"indeed, every human benefit and enjoyment,\r\nevery virtue and every prudent act, is founded on compromise and\r\nbarter.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Burke thought the State existed for the people, and not\r\nthe people for the State. The doctrine is old to us, but it was not\r\nso in Burke's time, and it required courage to expound it. The great\r\nparties had forgotten the reason for their existence, and one of them\r\nhad become hardened and blinded by that corruption which seems to follow\r\nlong tenure of office. The affairs of India, Ireland, and America gave\r\nexcellent opportunity for an exhibition of English statesmanship, but in\r\neach case the policy pursued was dictated, not by a clear perception\r\nof what was needed in these countries, but by narrow selfishness, not\r\nunmixed with dogmatism of the most challenging sort. The situation in\r\nIndia, as regards climate, character, and institutions, counted for\r\nlittle in the minds of those who were growing rich as agents of the East\r\nIndia Company. Much the same may be said of America and Ireland. The\r\nsense of Parliament, influenced by the king, was to use these parts\r\nof the British Empire in raising a revenue, and in strengthening party\r\norganization at home. In opposing this policy, Burke lost his seat\r\nas representative for Bristol, then the second city of England; spent\r\nfourteen of the best years of his life in conducting the impeachment\r\nof Warren Hastings, Governor-General of India; and, greatest of all,\r\ndelivered his famous speeches on Taxation and Conciliation, in behalf of\r\nthe American colonists.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the distinctly modern tone of Burke's ideas, it would\r\nbe wrong to think of him as a thoroughgoing reformer. He has been called\r\nthe Great Conservative, and the title is appropriate. He would have\r\nshrunk from a purely republican form of government, such as our own,\r\nand it is, perhaps, a fact that he was suspicious of a government by the\r\npeople. The trouble, as he saw it, lay with the representatives of the\r\npeople. Upon them, as guardians of a trust, rested the responsibility\r\nof protecting those whom they were chosen to serve. While he bitterly\r\nopposed any measures involving radical change in the Constitution, he\r\nwas no less ardent in denouncing political corruptions of all kinds\r\nwhatsoever. In his Economical Reform he sought to curtail the enormous\r\nextravagance of the royal household, and to withdraw the means of\r\nwholesale bribery, which offices at the disposal of the king created.\r\nHe did not believe that a more effective means than this lay in the\r\nproposed plan for a redistribution of seats in the House of Commons. In\r\none place, he declared it might be well to lessen the number of voters,\r\nin order to add to their weight and independence; at another, he asks\r\nthat the people be stimulated to a more careful scrutiny of the conduct\r\nof their representatives; and on every occasion he demands that the\r\nlegislators give their support to those measures only which have for\r\ntheir object the good of the whole people.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that Burke's policy had grievous faults. His\r\nreverence for the past, and his respect for existing institutions as the\r\nheritage of the past, made him timid and overcautious in dealing with\r\nabuses. Although he stood with Pitt in defending the American colonies,\r\nhe had no confidence in the thoroughgoing reforms which the great\r\nCommoner proposed. When the Stamp Act was repealed, Pitt would have\r\ngone even further. He would have acknowledged the absolute injustice of\r\ntaxation without representation. Burke held tenaciously to the opposing\r\ntheory, and warmly supported the Declaratory Act, which \"asserted\r\nthe supreme authority of Parliament over the colonies, in all cases\r\nwhatsoever.\" His support of the bill for the repeal of the Stamp Act, as\r\nwell as his plea for reconciliation, ten years later, were not prompted\r\nby a firm belief in the injustice of England's course. He expressly\r\nstates, in both cases that to enforce measures so repugnant to the\r\nAmericans, would be detrimental to the home government. It would result\r\nin confusion and disorder, and would bring, perhaps, in the end, open\r\nrebellion. All of his speeches on American affairs show his willingness\r\nto \"barter and compromise\" in order to avoid this, but nowhere is there\r\na hint of fundamental error in the Constitution. This was sacred to him,\r\nand he resented to the last any proposition looking to an organic change\r\nin its structure. \"The lines of morality,\" he declared, \"are not like\r\nideal lines of mathematics. They are broad and deep, as well as long.\r\nThey admit of exceptions; they demand modifications. These exceptions\r\nand modifications are made, not by the process of logic, but the rules\r\nof prudence. Prudence is not only first in rank of all the virtues,\r\npolitical and moral, but she is the director, the regulator, the\r\nstandard of them all.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics, then, of Burke's political philosophy are\r\nopposed to much that is fundamental in modern systems. His doctrine is\r\nbetter than that of George III, because it is more generous, and affords\r\nopportunity for superficial readjustment and adaptation. It is this\r\nlast, or rather the proof it gives of his insight, that has secured\r\nBurke so high a place among English statesmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GROUP OF WRITERS COMING IMMEDIATELY BEFORE BURKE\r\n\r\n  Addison. . . . 1672-1719\r\n  Steele . . . . 1672-1729\r\n  Defoe. . . . . 1661-1731\r\n  Swift. . . . . 1667-1745\r\n  Pope . . . . . 1688-1744\r\n  Richardson . . 1689-1761\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GROUP OF WRITERS CONTEMPORARY WITH BURKE\r\n\r\n     Johnson . . . . 1709-1784\r\n     Goldsmith . . . 1728-1774\r\n     Fielding. . . . 1707-1754\r\n     Sterne. . . . . 1713-1768\r\n     Smollett. . . . 1721-1771\r\n     Gray. . . . . . 1716-1771\r\n     Boswell . . . . 1740-1795\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURKE IN LITERATURE\r\n\r\nIt has become almost trite to speak of the breadth of Burke's\r\nsympathies. We should examine the statement, however, and understand its\r\nsignificance and see its justice. While he must always be regarded first\r\nas a statesman of one of the highest types, he had other interests than\r\nthose directly suggested by his office, and in one of these, at least,\r\nhe affords an interesting and profitable study.\r\n\r\nTo the student of literature Burke's name must always suggest that of\r\nJohnson and Goldsmith. It was eight years after Burke's first appearance\r\nas an author, that the famous Literary Club was formed. At first it was\r\nthe intention to limit the club to a membership of nine, and for a\r\ntime this was adhered to. The original members were Johnson, Burke,\r\nGoldsmith, Reynolds, and Hawkins. Garrick, Pox, and Boswell came in\r\nlater. Macaulay declares that the influence of the club was so great\r\nthat its verdict made and unmade reputations; but the thing most\r\ninteresting to us does not lie in the consideration of such literary\r\ndictatorship. To Boswell we owe a biography of Johnson which has\r\nimmortalized its subject, and shed lustre upon all associated with him.\r\nThe literary history of the last third of the eighteenth century, with\r\nJohnson as a central figure, is told nowhere else with such accuracy, or\r\nwith better effect.\r\n\r\nAlthough a Tory, Johnson was a great one, and his lasting friendship for\r\nBurke is an enduring evidence of his generosity and great-mindedness.\r\nFor twenty years, and longer, they were eminent men in opposing parties,\r\nyet their mutual respect and admiration continued to the last. To Burke,\r\nJohnson was a writer of \"eminent literary merit\" and entitled to a\r\npension \"solely on that account.\" To Johnson, Burke was the greatest\r\nman of his age, wrong politically, to be sure, yet the only one \"whose\r\ncommon conversation corresponded to the general fame which he had in\r\nthe world\"--the only one \"who was ready, whatever subject was chosen, to\r\nmeet you on your own ground.\" Here and there in the Life are allusions\r\nto Burke, and admirable estimates of his many-sided character.\r\n\r\nComing directly to an estimate of Burke from the purely literary point\r\nof view, it must be borne in mind that the greater part of his writings\r\nwas prepared for an audience. Like Macaulay, his prevailing style\r\nsuggests the speaker, and his methods throughout are suited to\r\ndeclamation and oratory. He lacks the ease and delicacy that we are\r\naccustomed to look for in the best prose writers, and occasionally one\r\nfeels the justice of Johnson's stricture, that \"he sometimes talked\r\npartly from ostentation\", or of Hazlitt's criticism that he seemed to be\r\n\"perpetually calling the speaker out to dance a minuet with him before\r\nhe begins.\"\r\n\r\nThere may be passages here and there that warrant such censure. Burke is\r\ncertainly ornate, and at times he is extremely self-conscious, but the\r\ndominant quality of his style, and the one which forever contradicts\r\nthe idea of mere showiness, is passion. In his method of approaching a\r\nsubject, he may be, and perhaps is, rather tedious, but when once he\r\nhas come to the matter really in hand, he is no longer the rhetorician,\r\ndealing in fine phrases, but the great seer, clothing his thoughts\r\nin words suitable and becoming. The most magnificent passages in\r\nhis writings--the Conciliation is rich in them--owe their charm and\r\neffectiveness to this emotional capacity. They were evidently written\r\nin moments of absolute abandonment to feeling--in moments when he was\r\nabsorbed in the contemplation of some great truth, made luminous by his\r\nown unrivalled powers.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to this intensity of passion, is a splendid imaginative\r\nquality. Few writers of English prose have such command of figurative\r\nexpression. It must be said, however, that Burke was not entirely free\r\nfrom the faults which generally accompany an excessive use of figures.\r\nLike other great masters of a decorative style, he frequently becomes\r\npompous and grandiloquent. His thought, too, is obscured, where we\r\nwould expect great clearness of statement, accompanied by a dignified\r\nsimplicity; and occasionally we feel that he forgets his subject in an\r\nanxious effort to make an impression. Though there are passages in his\r\nwritings that justify such observations, they are few in number, when\r\ncompared with those which are really masterpieces of their kind.\r\n\r\nSome great crisis, or threatening state of affairs, seems to furnish the\r\nnecessary condition for the exercise of a great mind, and Burke is never\r\nso effective as when thoroughly aroused. His imagination needed the\r\nchastening which only a great moment or critical situation could give.\r\nTwo of his greatest speeches--Conciliation, and Impeachment of\r\nWarren Hastings--were delivered under the restraining effect of such\r\ncircumstances, and in each the figurative expression is subdued and not\r\nless beautiful in itself than, appropriate for the occasion.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be observed that no other writer of English prose has a\r\nbetter command of words. His ideas, as multifarious as they are, always\r\nfind fitting expression. He does not grope for a term; it stands ready\r\nfor his thought, and one feels that he had opportunity for choice. It\r\nis the exuberance of his fancy, already mentioned, coupled with this\r\nrichness of vocabulary, that helped to make Burke a tiresome speaker.\r\nHis mind was too comprehensive to allow any phase of his subject to pass\r\nwithout illumination. He followed where his subject led him, without any\r\ngreat attention to the patience of his audience. But he receives full\r\ncredit when his speeches are read. It is then that his mastery of\r\nthe subject and the splendid qualities of his style are apparent, and\r\nappreciated at their worth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is worth while observing that in the study of a\r\ngreat character, joined with an attempt to estimate it by conventional\r\nstandards, something must always be left unsaid. Much may be learned of\r\nBurke by knowing his record as a partisan, more by a minute inspection\r\nof his style as a writer, but beyond all this is the moral tone or\r\nattitude of the man himself. To a student of Burke this is the greatest\r\nthing about him. It colored every line he wrote, and to it, more than\r\nanything else, is due the immense force of the man as a speaker and\r\nwriter. It was this, more than Burke's great abilities, that justifies\r\nDr. Johnson's famous eulogy: \"He is not only the first man in the House\r\nof Commons, he is the first man everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GROUP OF WRITERS COMING IMMEDIATELY AFTER BURKE\r\n\r\nWordsworth . . . . 1770-1850\r\n\r\nColeridge . . . . . 1772-1834\r\n\r\nByron . . . . . . . 1788-1824\r\n\r\nShelley . . . . . . 1792-1822\r\n\r\nKeats . . . . . . . 1795-1821\r\n\r\nScott . . . . . . . 1771-1832\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPICS FOR SPECIAL REPORTS\r\n\r\n1. \"Like Goldsmith, though in a different sphere, Burke belongs both to\r\nthe old order and the new.\" Discuss that statement.\r\n\r\n2.

HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS, MARCH 22, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope, Sir, that notwithstanding the austerity of the Chair, your\r\ngood nature will incline you to some degree of indulgence towards human\r\nfrailty. You will not think it unnatural that those who have an object\r\ndepending, which strongly engages their hopes and fears, should be\r\nsomewhat inclined to superstition. As I came into the House full of\r\nanxiety about the event of my motion, I found, to my infinite surprise,\r\nthat the grand penal bill, [Footnote: 1] by which we had passed sentence\r\non the trade and sustenance of America, is to be returned to us from the\r\nother House. I do confess I could not help looking on this event as a\r\nfortunate omen. I look upon it as a sort of providential favor, by which\r\nwe are put once more in possession of our deliberative capacity upon a\r\nbusiness so very questionable in its nature, so very uncertain in its\r\nissue. By the return of this bill, which seemed to have taken its flight\r\nforever, we are at this very instant nearly as free to choose a plan for\r\nour American Government as we were on the first day of the session.\r\nIf, Sir, we incline to the side of conciliation, we are not at all\r\nembarrassed (unless we please to make ourselves so) by any incongruous\r\nmixture of coercion and restraint. We are therefore called upon, as it\r\nwere by a superior warning voice, again to attend to America; to attend\r\nto the whole of it together; and to review the subject with an unusual\r\ndegree of care and calmness.\r\n\r\nSurely it is an awful subject, or there is none so on this side of the\r\ngrave. When I first had the honor [Footnote: 2] of a seat in this House,\r\nthe affairs of that continent pressed themselves upon us as the most\r\nimportant and most delicate object of Parliamentary attention. My little\r\nshare in this great deliberation oppressed me. I found myself a partaker\r\nin a very high trust; and, having no sort of reason to rely on the\r\nstrength of my natural abilities for the proper execution of that trust,\r\nI was obliged to take more than common pains to instruct myself in\r\neverything which relates to our Colonies. I was not less under the\r\nnecessity of forming some fixed ideas concerning the general policy of\r\nthe British Empire. Something of this sort seemed to be indispensable,\r\nin order, amidst so vast a fluctuation of passions and opinions, to\r\nconcentre my thoughts, to ballast my conduct, to preserve me from being\r\nblown about by every wind of fashionable doctrine. I really did not\r\nthink it safe or manly to have fresh principles to seek upon every fresh\r\nmail which should arrive from America.\r\n\r\nAt that period I had the fortune to find myself in perfect concurrence\r\nwith a large majority in this House. Bowing under that high authority,\r\nand penetrated with the sharpness and strength of that early impression,\r\nI have continued ever since, without the least deviation, in my\r\noriginal sentiments. [Footnote: 3] Whether this be owing to an obstinate\r\nperseverance in error, or to a religious adherence to what appears to me\r\ntruth, and reason, it is in your equity to judge.\r\n\r\nSir, Parliament having an enlarged view of objects, made, during this\r\ninterval, more frequent changes in their sentiments and their conduct\r\nthan could be justified in a particular person upon the contracted scale\r\nof private information. But though I do not hazard anything approaching\r\nto a censure on the motives of former Parliaments to all those\r\nalterations, one fact is undoubted--that under them the state of\r\nAmerica has been kept in continual agitation. [Footnote: 4] Everything\r\nadministered as remedy to the public complaint, if it did not produce,\r\nwas at least followed by, an heightening of the distemper; until, by a\r\nvariety of experiments, that important country has been brought into her\r\npresent situation--a situation which I will not miscall, which I dare\r\nnot name, which I scarcely know how to comprehend in the terms of any\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nIn this posture, Sir, things stood at the beginning of the session.\r\nAbout that time, a worthy member [Footnote: 5] of great Parliamentary\r\nexperience, who, in the year 1766, filled the chair of the American\r\ncommittee with much ability, took me aside; and, lamenting the present\r\naspect of our politics, told me things were come to such a pass that\r\nour former [Footnote: 6] methods of proceeding in the House would be\r\nno longer tolerated: that the public tribunal (never too indulgent to a\r\nlong and unsuccessful opposition) would now scrutinize our conduct\r\nwith unusual severity: that the very vicissitudes and shiftings of\r\nMinisterial measures, instead of convicting their authors of inconstancy\r\nand want of system, would be taken as an occasion of charging us with a\r\npredetermined discontent, which nothing could satisfy; whilst we accused\r\nevery measure of vigor as cruel, and every proposal of lenity as weak\r\nand irresolute. The public, he said, would not have patience to see us\r\nplay the game out with our adversaries; we must produce our hand. It\r\nwould be expected that those who for many years had been active in such\r\naffairs should show that they had formed some clear and decided idea\r\nof the principles of Colony government; and were capable of drawing out\r\nsomething like a platform of the ground which might be laid for future\r\nand permanent tranquillity.\r\n\r\nI felt the truth of what my honorable friend represented; but I felt\r\nmy situation too. His application might have been made with far greater\r\npropriety to many other gentlemen. No man was indeed ever better\r\ndisposed, or worse qualified, for such an undertaking than myself.\r\nThough I gave so far in to his opinion that I immediately threw my\r\nthoughts into a sort of Parliamentary form, I was by no means equally\r\nready to produce them. It generally argues some degree of natural\r\nimpotence of mind, or some want of knowledge of the world, to hazard\r\nplans of government except from a seat of authority. Propositions are\r\nmade, not only ineffectually, but somewhat disreputably, when the minds\r\nof men are not properly disposed for their reception; and, for my part,\r\nI am not ambitious of ridicule--not absolutely a candidate for disgrace.\r\n\r\nBesides, Sir, to speak the plain truth, I have in general no very\r\nexalted opinion of the virtue of paper government; [Footnote: 7] nor\r\nof any politics in which the plan is to be wholly separated from the\r\nexecution. But when I saw that anger and violence prevailed every day\r\nmore and more, and that things were hastening towards an incurable\r\nalienation of our Colonies, I confess my caution gave way. I felt this\r\nas one of those few moments in which decorum yields to a higher duty.\r\nPublic calamity is a mighty leveller; and there are occasions when any,\r\neven the slightest, chance of doing good must be laid hold on, even by\r\nthe most inconsiderable person.\r\n\r\nTo restore order and repose to an empire so great and so distracted as\r\nours, is, merely in the attempt, an undertaking that would ennoble the\r\nflights of the highest genius, and obtain pardon for the efforts of the\r\nmeanest understanding. Struggling a good while with these thoughts, by\r\ndegrees I felt myself more firm. I derived, at length, some confidence\r\nfrom what in other circumstances usually produces timidity. I grew less\r\nanxious, even from the idea of my own insignificance. For, judging of\r\nwhat you are by what you ought to be, I persuaded myself that you would\r\nnot reject a reasonable proposition because it had nothing but its\r\nreason to recommend it. On the other hand, being totally destitute of\r\nall shadow of influence, natural or adventitious, I was very sure that,\r\nif my proposition were futile or dangerous--if it were weakly conceived,\r\nor improperly timed--there was nothing exterior to it of power to awe,\r\ndazzle, or delude you. You will see it just as it is; and you will treat\r\nit just as it deserves.\r\n\r\nThe proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war; not\r\npeace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless\r\nnegotiations; not peace to arise out of universal discord fomented,\r\nfrom principle, in all parts of the Empire, not peace to depend on the\r\njuridical determination of perplexing questions, or the precise marking\r\nthe shadowy boundaries of a complex government. It is simple peace;\r\nsought in its natural course, and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace\r\nsought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific. I\r\npropose, by removing the ground of the difference, and by restoring the\r\nformer unsuspecting confidence of the Colonies in the Mother Country,\r\nto give permanent satisfaction to your people; and (far from a scheme of\r\nruling by discord) to reconcile them to each other in the same act and\r\nby the bond of the very same interest which reconciles them to British\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMy idea is nothing more. Refined policy [Footnote: 8] ever has been, the\r\nparent of confusion; and ever will be so, as long as the world endures.\r\nPlain good intention, which is as easily discovered at the first view\r\nas fraud is surely detected at last, is, let me say, of no mean force in\r\nthe government of mankind. Genuine simplicity of heart is an healing\r\nand cementing principle. My plan, therefore, being formed upon the most\r\nsimple grounds imaginable, may disappoint some people when they hear it.\r\nIt has nothing to recommend it to the pruriency of curious ears. There\r\nis nothing at all new and captivating in it. It has nothing of the\r\nsplendor of the project [Footnote: 9] which has been lately laid upon\r\nyour table by the noble lord in the blue ribbon. [Footnote: 10] It does\r\nnot propose to fill your lobby with squabbling Colony agents, [Footnote:\r\n11] who will require the interposition of your mace, at every instant,\r\nto keep the peace amongst them. It does not institute a magnificent\r\nauction of finance, where captivated provinces come to general ransom\r\nby bidding against each other, until you knock down the hammer, and\r\ndetermine a proportion of payments beyond all the powers of algebra to\r\nequalize and settle.\r\n\r\nThe plan which I shall presume to suggest derives, however, one great\r\nadvantage from the proposition and registry of that noble lord's\r\nproject. The idea of conciliation is admissible. First, the House,\r\nin accepting the resolution moved by the noble lord, has admitted,\r\nnotwithstanding the menacing front of our address, [Footnote: 12]\r\nnotwithstanding our heavy bills of pains and penalties--that we do not\r\nthink ourselves precluded from all ideas of free grace and bounty.\r\n\r\nThe House has gone farther; it has declared conciliation admissible,\r\nprevious to any submission on the part of America. It has even shot a\r\ngood deal beyond that mark, and has admitted that the complaints of our\r\nformer mode of exerting the right of taxation were not wholly unfounded.\r\nThat right thus exerted is allowed to have something reprehensible in\r\nit, something unwise, or something grievous; since, in the midst of\r\nour heat and resentment, we, of ourselves, have proposed a\r\ncapital alteration; and in order to get rid of what seemed so very\r\nexceptionable, have instituted a mode that is altogether new; one that\r\nis, indeed, wholly alien from all the ancient methods and forms of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe principle of this proceeding is large enough for my purpose. The\r\nmeans proposed by the noble lord for carrying his ideas into execution,\r\nI think, indeed, are very indifferently suited to the end; and this I\r\nshall endeavor to show you before I sit down. But, for the present, I\r\ntake my ground on the admitted principle. I mean to give peace. Peace\r\nimplies reconciliation; and where there has been a material dispute,\r\nreconciliation does in a manner always imply concession on the one\r\npart or on the other. In this state of things, I make no difficulty\r\nin affirming that the proposal ought to originate from us. Great and\r\nacknowledged force is not impaired, either in effect or in opinion, by\r\nan unwillingness to exert itself. The superior power may offer peace\r\nwith honor and with safety. Such an offer from such a power will be\r\nattributed to magnanimity. But the concessions of the weak are the\r\nconcessions of fear. When such a one is disarmed, he is wholly at the\r\nmercy of his superior; and he loses forever that time and those chances,\r\n[Footnote: 13] which, as they happen to all men, are the strength and\r\nresources of all inferior power.\r\n\r\nThe capital leading questions on which you must this day decide are\r\nthese two: First, whether you ought to concede; and secondly, what your\r\nconcession ought to be. On the first of these questions we have gained,\r\nas I have just taken the liberty of observing to you, some ground. But\r\nI am sensible that a good deal more is still to be done. Indeed, Sir,\r\nto enable us to determine both on the one and the other of these great\r\nquestions with a firm and precise judgment, I think it may be necessary\r\nto consider distinctly the true nature and the peculiar circumstances\r\nof the object which we have before us; because after all our struggle,\r\nwhether we will or not, we must govern America according to that nature\r\nand to those circumstances, [Footnote: 14] and not according to our\r\nown imaginations, nor according to abstract ideas of right--by no means\r\naccording to mere general theories of government, the resort to which\r\nappears to me, in our present situation, no better than arrant trifling.\r\nI shall therefore endeavor, with your leave, to lay before you some\r\nof the most material of these circumstances in as full and as clear a\r\nmanner as I am able to state them.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that we have to consider with regard to the nature of\r\nthe object is--the number of people in the Colonies. I have taken for\r\nsome years a good deal of pains on that point. I can by no calculation\r\njustify myself in placing the number below two millions of inhabitants\r\nof our own European blood and color, besides at least five hundred\r\nthousand others, who form no inconsiderable part of the strength and\r\nopulence of the whole. This, Sir, is, I believe, about the true number.\r\nThere is no occasion to exaggerate where plain truth is of so much\r\nweight and importance. But whether I put the present numbers too high\r\nor too low is a matter of little moment. Such is the strength with which\r\npopulation shoots in that part of the world, that, state the numbers as\r\nhigh as we will, whilst the dispute continues, the exaggeration ends.\r\nWhilst we are discussing any given magnitude, they are grown to it.\r\nWhilst we spend our time in deliberating on the mode of governing two\r\nmillions, we shall find we have millions more to manage. Your children\r\ndo not grow faster from infancy to manhood than they spread from\r\nfamilies to communities, and from villages to nations.\r\n\r\nI put this consideration of the present and the growing numbers in the\r\nfront of our deliberation, because, Sir, this consideration will make\r\nit evident to a blunter discernment than yours, that no partial, narrow,\r\ncontracted, pinched, occasional system will be at all suitable to such\r\nan object. It will show you that it is not to be considered as one of\r\nthose minima which are out of the eye and consideration of the law;\r\nnot a paltry excrescence of the state; not a mean dependent, who may be\r\nneglected with little damage and provoked with little danger. It will\r\nprove that some degree of care and caution is required in the handling\r\nsuch an object; it will show that you ought not, in reason, to trifle\r\nwith so large a mass of the interests and feelings of the human race.\r\nYou could at no time do so without guilt; and be assured you will not be\r\nable to do it long with impunity.\r\n\r\nBut the population of this country, the great and growing population,\r\nthough a very important consideration, will lose much of its weight if\r\nnot combined with other circumstances. The commerce of your Colonies is\r\nout of all proportion beyond the numbers of the people. This ground\r\nof their commerce indeed has been trod some days ago, and with great\r\nability, by a distinguished person at your bar. This gentleman, after\r\nthirty-five years--it is so long since he first appeared at the same\r\nplace to plead for the commerce of Great Britain--has come again before\r\nyou to plead the same cause, without any other effect of time, than\r\nthat to the fire of imagination and extent of erudition which even then\r\nmarked him as one of the first literary characters of his age, he has\r\nadded a consummate knowledge in the commercial interest of his country,\r\nformed by a long course of enlightened and discriminating experience.\r\n\r\nSir, I should be inexcusable in coming after such a person with any\r\ndetail, if a great part of the members who now fill the House had not\r\nthe misfortune to be absent when he appeared at your bar. Besides, Sir,\r\nI propose to take the matter at periods of time somewhat different from\r\nhis. There is, if I mistake not, a point of view from whence, if you\r\nwill look at the subject, it is impossible that it should not make an\r\nimpression upon you.\r\n\r\nI have in my hand two accounts; one a comparative state of the export\r\ntrade of England to its Colonies, as it stood in the year 1704, and as\r\nit stood in the year 1772; the other a state of the export trade of this\r\ncountry to its Colonies alone, as it stood in 1772, compared with the\r\nwhole trade of England to all parts of the world (the Colonies included)\r\nin the year 1704. They are from good vouchers; the latter period from\r\nthe accounts on your table, the earlier from an original manuscript of\r\nDavenant, who first established the Inspector-General's office, which\r\nhas been ever since his time so abundant a source of Parliamentary\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe export trade to the Colonies consists of three great branches: the\r\nAfrican--which, terminating almost wholly in the Colonies, must be\r\nput to the account of their commerce,--the West Indian, and the North\r\nAmerican. All these are so interwoven that the attempt to separate them\r\nwould tear to pieces the contexture of the whole; and, if not entirely\r\ndestroy, would very much depreciate the value of all the parts. I\r\ntherefore consider these three denominations to be, what in effect they\r\nare, one trade. [Footnote: 15]\r\n\r\nThe trade to the Colonies, taken on the export side, at the beginning of\r\nthis century, that is, in the year 1704, stood thus:--\r\n\r\n Exports to North America and the West Indies. L483,265\r\n To Africa. ..................................  86,665\r\n                                               --------\r\n                                               L569,930\r\n\r\nIn the year 1772, which I take as a middle year between the highest and\r\nlowest of those lately laid on your table, the account was as follows:--\r\n\r\n To North America and the West Indies ...... L4,791,734\r\n To Africa. ................................  866,398\r\n To which, if you add the export trade from\r\n Scotland, which had in 1704 no existence ..  364,000\r\n                                             ----------\r\n                                             L6,022,132\r\n\r\nFrom five hundred and odd thousand, it has grown to six millions. It\r\nhas increased no less than twelve-fold. This is the state of the\r\nColony trade as compared with itself at these two periods within this\r\ncentury;--and this is matter for meditation. But this is not all.\r\nExamine my second account. See how the export trade to the Colonies\r\nalone in 1772 stood in the other point of view; that is, as compared to\r\nthe whole trade of England in 1704:--\r\n\r\n The whole export trade of England, including\r\n that to the Colonies, in 1704. ................ L6,509,000\r\n Export to the Colonies alone, in 1772 ......... 6,024,000\r\n\r\n                       ----------\r\n                   Difference,  L485,000\r\n\r\nThe trade with America alone is now within less than L500,000 of being\r\nequal to what this great commercial nation, England, carried on at\r\nthe beginning of this century with the whole world! If I had taken the\r\nlargest year of those on your table, it would rather have exceeded. But,\r\nit will be said, is not this American trade an unnatural protuberance,\r\nthat has drawn the juices from the rest of the body? The reverse. It\r\nis the very food that has nourished every other part into its present\r\nmagnitude. Our general trade has been greatly augmented, and augmented\r\nmore or less in almost every part to which it ever extended; but\r\nwith this material difference, that of the six millions which in the\r\nbeginning of the century constituted the whole mass of our export\r\ncommerce, the Colony trade was but one-twelfth part, it is now (as a\r\npart of sixteen millions) considerably more than a third of the whole.\r\nThis is the relative proportion of the importance of the Colonies at\r\nthese two periods, and all reasoning concerning our mode of treating\r\nthem must have this proportion as its basis, or it is a reasoning weak,\r\nrotten, and sophistical.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, I cannot prevail on myself to hurry over this great\r\nconsideration. [Footnote: 15] IT IS GOOD FOR US TO BE HERE. [Footnote:\r\n16] We stand where we have an immense view of what is, and what is past.\r\nClouds, indeed, and darkness, rest upon the future. Let us, however,\r\nbefore we descend from this noble eminence, reflect that this growth of\r\nour national prosperity has happened within the short period of the life\r\nof man. It has happened within sixty-eight years. There are those alive\r\nwhose memory might touch the two extremities. For instance, my Lord\r\nBathurst might remember all the stages of the progress. He was in 1704\r\nof an age at least to be made to comprehend such things. He was then old\r\nenough acta parentum jam legere, et quae sit potuit cognoscere virtus.\r\n[Footnote: 17] Suppose, Sir, that the angel of this auspicious youth,\r\nforeseeing the many virtues which made him one of the most amiable, as\r\nhe is one of the most fortunate, men of his age, had opened to him in\r\nvision that when in the fourth generation the third Prince of the House\r\nof Brunswick had sat twelve years on the throne of that nation which, by\r\nthe happy issue of moderate and healing counsels, was to be made Great\r\nBritain, he should see his son, Lord Chancellor of England, turn back\r\nthe current of hereditary dignity to its fountain, and raise him to\r\na higher rank of peerage, whilst he enriched the family with a new\r\none--if, amidst these bright and happy scenes of domestic honor and\r\nprosperity, that angel should have drawn up the curtain, and unfolded\r\nthe rising glories of his country, and, whilst he was gazing with\r\nadmiration on the then commercial grandeur of England, the genius should\r\npoint out to him a little speck, scarcely visible in the mass of the\r\nnational interest, a small seminal principle, rather than a formed body,\r\nand should tell him: \"Young man, there is America--which at this day\r\nserves for little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and\r\nuncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, [Footnote: 18]\r\nshow itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the\r\nenvy of the world. Whatever England has been growing to by a progressive\r\nincrease of improvement, brought in by varieties of people, by\r\nsuccession of civilizing conquests and civilizing settlements in a\r\nseries of seventeen hundred years, you shall see as much added to her\r\nby America in the course of a single life!\" If this state of his\r\ncountry had been foretold to him, would it not require all the sanguine\r\ncredulity of youth, and all the fervid glow of enthusiasm, to make him\r\nbelieve it? Fortunate man, he has lived to see it! Fortunate, indeed,\r\nif he lives to see nothing that shall vary the prospect, and cloud the\r\nsetting of his day!\r\n\r\nExcuse me, Sir, if turning from such thoughts I resume this comparative\r\nview once more. You have seen it on a large scale; look at it on a small\r\none. I will point out to your attention a particular instance of it\r\nin the single province of Pennsylvania. In the year 1704 that province\r\ncalled for L11,459 in value of your commodities, native and foreign.\r\nThis was the whole. What did it demand in 1772? Why, nearly fifty times\r\nas much; for in that year the export to Pennsylvania was L507,909,\r\nnearly equal to the export to all the Colonies together in the first\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nI choose, Sir, to enter into these minute and particular details,\r\nbecause generalities, which in all other cases are apt to heighten and\r\nraise the subject, have here a tendency to sink it. When we speak of\r\nthe commerce with our Colonies, fiction lags after truth, invention is\r\nunfruitful, and imagination cold and barren.\r\n\r\nSo far, Sir, as to the importance of the object, in view of its\r\ncommerce, as concerned in the exports from England. If I were to detail\r\nthe imports, I could show how many enjoyments they procure which deceive\r\nthe burthen of life; how many materials which invigorate the springs of\r\nnational industry, and extend and animate every part of our foreign and\r\ndomestic commerce. This would be a curious subject indeed; but I must\r\nprescribe bounds to myself in a matter so vast and various.\r\n\r\nI pass, therefore, to the Colonies in another point of view, their\r\nagriculture. This they have prosecuted with such a spirit, that, besides\r\nfeeding plentifully their own growing multitude, their annual export\r\nof grain, comprehending rice, has some years ago exceeded a million in\r\nvalue. Of their last harvest I am persuaded they will export much more.\r\nAt the beginning of the century some of these Colonies imported corn\r\nfrom the Mother Country. For some time past the Old World has been\r\nfed from the New. The scarcity which you have felt would have been a\r\ndesolating famine, if this child of your old age, with a true filial\r\npiety, with a Roman charity, [Footnote: 19] had not put the full breast\r\nof its youthful exuberance to the mouth of its exhausted parent.\r\n\r\nAs to the wealth which the Colonies have drawn from the sea by their\r\nfisheries, you had all that matter fully opened at your bar. You surely\r\nthought those acquisitions of value, for they seemed even to excite your\r\nenvy; and yet the spirit by which that enterprising employment has been\r\nexercised ought rather, in my opinion, to have raised your esteem and\r\nadmiration. And pray, Sir, what in the world is equal to it? Pass by the\r\nother parts, and look at the manner in which the people of New England\r\nhave of late carried on the whale fishery. Whilst we follow them among\r\nthe tumbling mountains of ice, and behold them penetrating into the\r\ndeepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay and Davis's Straits, whilst we\r\nare looking for them beneath the arctic circle, we hear that they have\r\npierced into the opposite region of polar cold, that they are at the\r\nantipodes, and engaged under the frozen Serpent of the south. Falkland\r\nIsland, which seemed too remote and romantic an object for the grasp of\r\nnational ambition, is but a stage and resting-place in the progress of\r\ntheir victorious industry. Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging\r\nto them than the accumulated winter of both the poles. We know that\r\nwhilst some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast\r\nof Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along\r\nthe coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries; no\r\nclimate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of\r\nHolland, nor the activity of France, nor the dexterous and firm sagacity\r\nof English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hardy\r\nindustry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent\r\npeople; a people who are still, as it were, but in the gristle, and not\r\nyet hardened into the bone of manhood. When I contemplate these things;\r\nwhen I know that the Colonies in general owe little or nothing to any\r\ncare of ours, and that they are not squeezed into this happy form by the\r\nconstraints of watchful and suspicious government, but that, through a\r\nwise and salutary neglect, a generous nature has been suffered to take\r\nher own way to perfection; when I reflect upon these effects, when I see\r\nhow profitable they have been to us, I feel all the pride of power sink,\r\nand all presumption in the wisdom of human contrivances melt and die\r\naway within me. My rigor relents. I pardon something to the spirit of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nI am sensible, Sir, that all which I have asserted in my detail is\r\nadmitted in the gross; but that quite a different conclusion is drawn\r\nfrom it. America, gentlemen say, is a noble object. It is an object well\r\nworth fighting for. Certainly it is, if fighting a people be the best\r\nway of gaining them. Gentlemen in this respect will be led to their\r\nchoice of means by their complexions [Footnote: 20] and their habits.\r\nThose who understand the military art will of course have some\r\npredilection for it. Those who wield the thunder of the state [Footnote:\r\n21] may have more confidence in the efficacy of arms. But I confess,\r\npossibly for want of this knowledge, my opinion is much more in favor\r\nof prudent management than of force; considering force not as an odious,\r\nbut a feeble instrument for preserving a people so numerous, so active,\r\nso growing, so spirited as this, in a profitable and subordinate\r\nconnection with us.\r\n\r\nFirst, Sir, permit me to observe that the use of force alone is but\r\ntemporary. It may subdue for a moment, but it does not remove the\r\nnecessity of subduing again; and a nation is not governed [Footnote: 22]\r\nwhich is perpetually to be conquered.\r\n\r\nMy next objection is its uncertainty. Terror is not always the effect of\r\nforce, and an armament is not a victory. If you do not succeed, you are\r\nwithout resource; for, conciliation failing, force remains; but, force\r\nfailing, no further hope of reconciliation is left. Power and authority\r\nare sometimes bought by kindness; but they can never be begged as alms\r\nby an impoverished and defeated violence.\r\n\r\nA further objection to force is, that you impair the object by your\r\nvery endeavors to preserve it. The thing you fought for is not the thing\r\nwhich you recover; but depreciated, sunk, wasted, and consumed in the\r\ncontest. Nothing less will content me than WHOLE AMERICA. I do not\r\nchoose to consume its strength along with our own, because in all parts\r\nit is the British strength that I consume. I do not choose to be caught\r\nby a foreign enemy at the end of this exhausting conflict; and still\r\nless in the midst of it. I may escape; but I can make no insurance\r\nagainst such an event. Let me add, that I do not choose wholly to break\r\nthe American spirit; because it is the spirit that has made the country.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have no sort of experience in favor of force as an instrument\r\nin the rule of our Colonies. Their growth and their utility has been\r\nowing to methods altogether different. Our ancient indulgence [Footnote:\r\n23] has been said to be pursued to a fault. It may be so. But we know if\r\nfeeling is evidence, that our fault was more tolerable than our attempt\r\nto mend it; and our sin far more salutary than our penitence.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are my reasons for not entertaining that high opinion of\r\nuntried force by which many gentlemen, for whose sentiments in other\r\nparticulars I have great respect, seem to be so greatly captivated. But\r\nthere is still behind a third consideration concerning this object which\r\nserves to determine my opinion on the sort of policy which ought to be\r\npursued in the management of America, even more than its population and\r\nits commerce--I mean its temper and character.\r\n\r\nIn this character of the Americans, a love of freedom is the\r\npredominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole; and as an\r\nardent is always a jealous affection, your Colonies become suspicious,\r\nrestive, and untractable whenever they see the least attempt to wrest\r\nfrom them by force, or shuffle from them by chicane, what they think\r\nthe only advantage worth living for. This fierce spirit of liberty is\r\nstronger in the English Colonies probably than in any other people of\r\nthe earth, and this from a great variety of powerful causes; which, to\r\nunderstand the true temper of their minds and the direction which this\r\nspirit takes, it will not be amiss to lay open somewhat more largely.\r\n\r\nFirst, the people of the Colonies are descendants of Englishmen.\r\nEngland, Sir, is a nation which still, I hope, respects, and formerly\r\nadored, her freedom. The Colonists emigrated from you when this part\r\nof your character was most predominant; and they took this bias and\r\ndirection the moment they parted from your hands. They are therefore not\r\nonly devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas, and\r\non English principles. Abstract liberty, like other mere abstractions,\r\nis not to be found. Liberty inheres in some sensible object; and\r\nevery nation has formed to itself some favorite point, which by way\r\nof eminence becomes the criterion of their happiness. It happened, you\r\nknow, Sir, that the great contests [Footnote: 24] for freedom in this\r\ncountry were from the earliest times chiefly upon the question of\r\ntaxing. Most of the contests in the ancient commonwealths turned\r\nprimarily on the right of election of magistrates; or on the balance\r\namong the several orders of the state. The question of money was not\r\nwith them so immediate. But in England it was otherwise. On this\r\npoint of taxes the ablest pens, and most eloquent tongues, have been\r\nexercised; the greatest spirits have acted and suffered. In order to\r\ngive the fullest satisfaction concerning the importance of this point,\r\nit was not only necessary for those who in argument defended the\r\nexcellence of the English Constitution to insist on this privilege of\r\ngranting money as a dry point of fact, and to prove that the right had\r\nbeen acknowledged in ancient parchments and blind usages to reside in\r\na certain body called a House of Commons. They went much farther; they\r\nattempted to prove, and they succeeded, that in theory it ought to be\r\nso, from the particular nature of a House of Commons as an immediate\r\nrepresentative of the people, whether the old records had delivered this\r\noracle or not. They took infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental\r\nprinciple, that in all monarchies the people must in effect themselves,\r\nmediately or immediately, possess the power of granting their own money,\r\nor no shadow of liberty can subsist. The Colonies draw from you, as with\r\ntheir life-blood, these ideas and principles. Their love of liberty, as\r\nwith you, fixed and attached on this specific point of taxing. Liberty\r\nmight be safe, or might be endangered, in twenty other particulars,\r\nwithout their being much pleased or alarmed. Here they felt its pulse;\r\nand as they found that beat, they thought themselves sick or sound. I\r\ndo not say whether they were right or wrong in applying your general\r\narguments to their own case. It is not easy, indeed, to make a monopoly\r\nof theorems and corollaries. The fact is, that they did thus apply those\r\ngeneral arguments; and your mode of governing them, whether through\r\nlenity or indolence, through wisdom or mistake, confirmed them in the\r\nimagination that they, as well as you, had an interest in these common\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThey were further confirmed in this pleasing error by the form of their\r\nprovincial legislative assemblies. Their governments are popular in an\r\nhigh degree; some are merely popular; in all, the popular representative\r\nis the most weighty; and this share of the people in their ordinary\r\ngovernment never fails to inspire them with lofty sentiments, and with\r\na strong aversion from whatever tends to deprive them of their chief\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIf anything were wanting to this necessary operation of the form of\r\ngovernment, religion would have given it a complete effect. Religion,\r\nalways a principle of energy, in this new people is no way worn out or\r\nimpaired; and their mode of professing it is also one main cause of this\r\nfree spirit. The people are Protestants; and of that kind which is the\r\nmost adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion. This is a\r\npersuasion not only favorable to liberty, but built upon it. I do\r\nnot think, Sir, that the reason of this averseness in the dissenting\r\nchurches from all that looks like absolute government is so much to be\r\nsought in their religious tenets, as in their history. Every one knows\r\nthat the Roman Catholic religion is at least co-eval with most of the\r\ngovernments where it prevails; that it has generally gone hand in hand\r\nwith them, and received great favor and every kind of support from\r\nauthority. The Church of England too was formed from her cradle under\r\nthe nursing care of regular government. But the dissenting interests\r\nhave sprung up in direct opposition to all the ordinary powers of the\r\nworld, and could justify that opposition only on a strong claim to\r\nnatural liberty. Their very existence depended on the powerful and\r\nunremitted assertion of that claim. All Protestantism, even the most\r\ncold and passive, is a sort of dissent. But the religion most prevalent\r\nin our Northern Colonies is a refinement on the principle of resistance;\r\nit is the dissidence of dissent, and the protestantism of the Protestant\r\nreligion. This religion, under a variety of denominations agreeing in\r\nnothing but in the communion of the spirit of liberty, is predominant\r\nin most of the Northern Provinces, where the Church of England,\r\nnotwithstanding its legal rights, is in reality no more than a sort of\r\nprivate sect, not composing most probably the tenth of the people. The\r\nColonists left England when this spirit was high, and in the emigrants\r\nwas the highest of all; and even that stream of foreigners which has\r\nbeen constantly flowing into these Colonies has, for the greatest part,\r\nbeen composed of dissenters from the establishments of their several\r\ncountries, who have brought with them a temper and character far from\r\nalien to that of the people with whom they mixed.\r\n\r\nSir, I can perceive by their manner that some gentlemen object to the\r\nlatitude of this description, because in the Southern Colonies the\r\nChurch of England forms a large body, and has a regular establishment.\r\nIt is certainly true. There is, however, a circumstance attending these\r\nColonies which, in my opinion, fully counterbalances this difference,\r\nand makes the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in\r\nthose to the northward. It is that in Virginia and the Carolinas they\r\nhave a vast multitude of slaves. Where this is the case in any part of\r\nthe world, those who are free are by far the most proud and jealous of\r\ntheir freedom. Freedom is to them [Footnote: 25] not only an enjoyment,\r\nbut a kind of rank and privilege. Not seeing there, that freedom, as in\r\ncountries where it is a common blessing and as broad and general as the\r\nair, may be united with much abject toil, with great misery, with all\r\nthe exterior of servitude; liberty looks, amongst them, like something\r\nthat is more noble and liberal. I do not mean, Sir, to commend the\r\nsuperior morality of this sentiment, which has at least as much pride as\r\nvirtue in it; but I cannot alter the nature of man. The fact is so; and\r\nthese people of the Southern Colonies are much more strongly, and with\r\nan higher and more stubborn spirit, attached to liberty than those to\r\nthe northward. Such were all the ancient commonwealths; such were our\r\nGothic ancestors; such in our days were the Poles; and such will be all\r\nmasters of slaves, who are not slaves themselves. In such a people the\r\nhaughtiness of domination combines with the spirit of freedom, fortifies\r\nit, and renders it invincible.\r\n\r\nPermit me, Sir, to add another circumstance in our Colonies which\r\ncontributes no mean part towards the growth and effect of this\r\nuntractable spirit. I mean their education. In no country perhaps in the\r\nworld is the law so general a study. The profession itself is numerous\r\nand powerful; and in most provinces it takes the lead. The greater\r\nnumber of the deputies sent to the Congress were lawyers. But all who\r\nread, and most do read, endeavor to obtain some smattering in that\r\nscience. I have been told by an eminent bookseller, that in no branch\r\nof his business, after tracts of popular devotion, were so many books\r\nas those on the law exported to the Plantations. The Colonists have now\r\nfallen into the way of printing them for their own use. I hear that they\r\nhave sold nearly as many of Blackstone's Commentaries in America as in\r\nEngland. General Gage marks out this disposition very particularly in\r\na letter on your table. He states that all the people in his government\r\nare lawyers, or smatterers in law; and that in Boston they have been\r\nenabled, by successful chicane, wholly to evade many parts of one of\r\nyour capital penal constitutions. The smartness of debate will say\r\nthat this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of\r\nlegislature, their obligations to obedience, and the penalties of\r\nrebellion. All this is mighty well. But my honorable and learned friend\r\non the floor, who condescends to mark what I say for animadversion, will\r\ndisdain that ground. He has heard, as well as I, that when great honors\r\nand great emoluments do not win over this knowledge to the service of\r\nthe state, it is a formidable adversary to government. If the spirit\r\nbe not tamed and broken by these happy methods, it is stubborn and\r\nlitigious. Abeunt studia in mores. [Footnote: 26] This study readers men\r\nacute, inquisitive, dexterous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, full\r\nof resources. In other countries, the people, more simple, and of a\r\nless mercurial cast, judge of an ill principle in government only by\r\nan actual grievance; here they anticipate the evil, and judge of the\r\npressure of the grievance by the badness of the principle. They augur\r\nmisgovernment at a distance, and snuff the approach of tyranny in every\r\ntainted breeze.\r\n\r\nThe last cause of this disobedient spirit in the Colonies is hardly less\r\npowerful than the rest, as it is not merely moral, but laid deep in\r\nthe natural constitution of things. Three thousand miles of ocean lie\r\nbetween you and them. No contrivance can prevent the effect of this\r\ndistance in weakening government. Seas roll, and months pass, between\r\nthe order and the execution, and the want of a speedy explanation of\r\na single point is enough to defeat a whole system. You have, indeed,\r\nwinged ministers of vengeance, [Footnote: 27] who carry your bolts in\r\ntheir pounces to the remotest verge of the sea. But there a power steps\r\nin that limits the arrogance of raging passions and furious elements,\r\nand says, SO FAR SHALL THOU GO, AND NO FARTHER. Who are you, that you\r\nshould fret and rage, and bite the chains of nature? Nothing worse\r\nhappens to you than does to all nations who have extensive empire; and\r\nit happens in all the forms into which empire can be thrown. In large\r\nbodies the circulation [Footnote: 28] of power must be less vigorous at\r\nthe extremities. Nature has said it. The Turk cannot govern Egypt and\r\nArabia and Kurdistan as he governs Thrace; nor has he the same dominion\r\nin Crimea and Algiers which he has at Brusa and Smyrna. Despotism itself\r\nis obliged to truck and huckster. The Sultan gets such obedience as he\r\ncan. He governs with a loose rein, that he may govern at all; and the\r\nwhole of the force and vigor of his authority in his centre is derived\r\nfrom a prudent relaxation in all his borders. Spain, in her provinces,\r\nis, perhaps, not so well obeyed as you are in yours. She complies, too;\r\nshe submits; she watches times. This is the immutable condition, the\r\neternal law of extensive and detached empire.\r\n\r\nThen, Sir, from these six capital sources--of descent, of form of\r\ngovernment, of religion in the Northern Provinces, of manners in the\r\nSouthern, of education, of the remoteness of situation from the first\r\nmover of government--from all these causes a fierce spirit of liberty\r\nhas grown up. It has grown with the growth of the people in your\r\nColonies, and increased with the increase of their wealth; a spirit that\r\nunhappily meeting with an exercise of power in England which, however\r\nlawful, is not reconcilable to any ideas of liberty, much less with\r\ntheirs, has kindled this flame that is ready to consume us.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to commend either the spirit in this excess, or the moral\r\ncauses which produce it. Perhaps a more smooth and accommodating spirit\r\nof freedom in them would be more acceptable to us. Perhaps ideas\r\nof liberty might be desired more reconcilable with an arbitrary and\r\nboundless authority. Perhaps we might wish the Colonists to be persuaded\r\nthat their liberty is more secure when held in trust for them by us, as\r\ntheir guardians during a perpetual minority, than with any part of it\r\nin their own hands. The question is, not whether their spirit deserves\r\npraise or blame, but--what, in the name of God, shall we do with it? You\r\nhave before you the object, such as it is, with all its glories, with\r\nall its imperfections [Footnote: 29] on its head. You see the magnitude,\r\nthe importance, the temper, the habits, the disorders. By all these\r\nconsiderations we are strongly urged to determine something concerning\r\nit. We are called upon to fix some rule and line for our future conduct\r\nwhich may give a little stability to our politics, and prevent the\r\nreturn of such unhappy deliberations as the present. Every such return\r\nwill bring the matter before us in a still more untractable form. For,\r\nwhat astonishing and incredible things have we not seen already! What\r\nmonsters have not been generated from this unnatural contention! Whilst\r\nevery principle of authority and resistance has been pushed, upon both\r\nsides, as far as it would go, there is nothing so solid and certain,\r\neither in reasoning or in practice, that has not been shaken. Until very\r\nlately all authority in America seemed to be nothing but an emanation\r\nfrom yours. Even, the popular part of the Colony Constitution derived\r\nall its activity and its first vital movement from the pleasure of the\r\nCrown. We thought, Sir, that the utmost which the discontented Colonies\r\ncould do was to disturb authority; we never dreamt they could of\r\nthemselves supply it--knowing in general what an operose business it is\r\nto establish a government absolutely new. But having, for our purposes\r\nin this contention, resolved that none but an obedient Assembly should\r\nsit, the humors of the people there, finding all passage through the\r\nlegal channel stopped, with great violence broke out another way. Some\r\nprovinces have tried their experiment, as we have tried ours; and\r\ntheirs has succeeded. They have formed a government sufficient for its\r\npurposes, without the bustle of a revolution or the formality of an\r\nelection. Evident necessity and tacit consent have done the business in\r\nan instant. So well they have done it, that Lord Dunmore--the account is\r\namong the fragments on your table--tells you that the new institution\r\nis infinitely better obeyed than the ancient government ever was in its\r\nmost fortunate periods. Obedience is what makes government, and not the\r\nnames by which it is called; not the name of Governor, as formerly, or\r\nCommittee, as at present. This new government has originated directly\r\nfrom the people, and was not transmitted through any of the ordinary\r\nartificial media of a positive constitution. It was not a manufacture\r\nready formed, and transmitted to them in that condition from England.\r\nThe evil arising from hence is this; that the Colonists having once\r\nfound the possibility of enjoying the advantages of order in the midst\r\nof a struggle for liberty, such struggles will not henceforward seem so\r\nterrible to the settled and sober part of mankind as they had appeared\r\nbefore the trial. Pursuing the same plan [Footnote: 30] of punishing by\r\nthe denial of the exercise of government to still greater lengths,\r\nwe wholly abrogated the ancient government of Massachusetts. We were\r\nconfident that the first feeling if not the very prospect, of anarchy\r\nwould instantly enforce a complete submission. The experiment was tried.\r\nA new, strange, unexpected face of things appeared. Anarchy is found\r\ntolerable. A vast province has now subsisted, and subsisted in a\r\nconsiderable degree of health and vigor for near a twelvemonth, without\r\nGovernor, without public Council, without judges, without executive\r\nmagistrates. How long it will continue in this state, or what may arise\r\nout of this unheard-of situation, how can the wisest of us conjecture?\r\nOur late experience has taught us that many of those fundamental\r\nprinciples, formerly believed infallible, are either not of the\r\nimportance they were imagined to be, or that we have not at all adverted\r\nto some other far more important and far more powerful principles,\r\nwhich entirely overrule those we had considered as omnipotent. I am much\r\nagainst any further experiments which tend to put to the proof any\r\nmore of these allowed opinions which contribute so much to the public\r\ntranquillity. In effect we suffer as much at home by this loosening\r\nof all ties, and this concussion of all established opinions as we do\r\nabroad; for in order to prove that the Americans have no right to their\r\nliberties, we are every day endeavoring to subvert the maxims which\r\npreserve the whole spirit of our own. To prove that the Americans\r\nought not to be free, we are obliged to depreciate the value of freedom\r\nitself; and we never seem to gain a paltry advantage over them in debate\r\nwithout attacking some of those principles, or deriding some of those\r\nfeelings, for which our ancestors have shed their blood.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, in wishing to put an end to pernicious experiments, I do not\r\nmean to preclude the fullest inquiry. Far from it. Far from deciding on\r\na sudden or partial view, [Footnote: 31] I would patiently go round and\r\nround the subject, and survey it minutely in every possible aspect. Sir,\r\nif I were capable of engaging you to an equal attention, I would state\r\nthat, as far as I am capable of discerning, there are but three ways\r\n[Footnote: 32] of proceeding relative to this stubborn spirit which\r\nprevails in your Colonies, and disturbs your government. These are--to\r\nchange that spirit, as inconvenient, by removing the causes; to\r\nprosecute it as criminal; or to comply with it as necessary. I would not\r\nbe guilty of an imperfect enumeration; I can think of but these three.\r\nAnother has indeed been started,--that of giving up the Colonies; but it\r\nmet so slight a reception that I do not think myself obliged to dwell a\r\ngreat while upon it. It is nothing but a little sally of anger, like the\r\nforwardness of peevish children who, when they cannot get all they would\r\nhave, are resolved to take nothing.\r\n\r\nThe first of these plans--to change the spirit, as inconvenient, by\r\nremoving the causes--I think is the most like a systematic proceeding.\r\nIt is radical in its principle; but it is attended with great\r\ndifficulties, some of them little short, as I conceive, of\r\nimpossibilities. This will appear by examining into the plans which have\r\nbeen proposed.\r\n\r\nAs the growing population in the Colonies is evidently one cause of\r\ntheir resistance, it was last session mentioned in both Houses, by men\r\nof weight, and received not without applause, that in order to check\r\nthis evil it would be proper for the Crown to make no further grants of\r\nland. But to this scheme there are two objections. The first, that there\r\nis already so much unsettled land in private hands as to afford room for\r\nan immense future population, although the Crown not only withheld its\r\ngrants, but annihilated its soil. If this be the case, then the\r\nonly effect of this avarice of desolation, this hoarding of a royal\r\nwilderness, would be to raise the value of the possessions in the hands\r\nof the great private monopolists without any adequate cheek to the\r\ngrowing and alarming mischief of population.\r\n\r\nBut if you stopped your grants, what would be the consequence? The\r\npeople would occupy without grants. They have already so occupied\r\nin many places. You cannot station garrisons in every part of these\r\ndeserts. If you drive the people from one place, they will carry on\r\ntheir annual tillage, and remove with their flocks and herds to another.\r\nMany of the people in the back settlements are already little attached\r\nto particular situations. Already they have topped the Appalachian\r\nMountains. From thence they behold before them an immense plain, one\r\nvast, rich, level meadow; a square of five hundred miles. Over this they\r\nwould wander without a possibility of restraint; they would change their\r\nmanners with the habits of their life; would soon forget a government by\r\nwhich they were disowned; would become hordes of English Tartars; and,\r\npouring down upon your unfortified frontiers a fierce and irresistible\r\ncavalry, become masters of your governors and your counsellors, your\r\ncollectors and comptrollers, and of all the slaves that adhered to them.\r\nSuch would, and in no long time must be, the effect of attempting to\r\nforbid as a crime and to suppress as an evil the command and blessing of\r\nprovidence, INCREASE AND MULTIPLY. Such would be the happy result of the\r\nendeavor to keep as a lair of wild beasts that earth which God, by an\r\nexpress charter, has given to the children of men. Far different,\r\nand surely much wiser, has been our policy hitherto. Hitherto we have\r\ninvited our people, by every kind of bounty, to fixed establishments. We\r\nhave invited the husbandman to look to authority for his title. We\r\nhave taught him piously to believe in the mysterious virtue of wax and\r\nparchment. We have thrown each tract of land, as it was peopled, into\r\ndistricts, that the ruling power should never be wholly out of sight.\r\nWe have settled all we could; and we have carefully attended every\r\nsettlement with government.\r\n\r\nAdhering, Sir, as I do, to this policy, as well as for the reasons I\r\nhave just given, I think this new project of hedging-in population to be\r\nneither prudent nor practicable.\r\n\r\nTo impoverish the Colonies in general, and in particular to arrest the\r\nnoble course of their marine enterprises, would be a more easy task. I\r\nfreely confess it. We have shown a disposition to a system of this kind,\r\na disposition even to continue the restraint after the offence, looking\r\non ourselves as rivals to our Colonies, and persuaded that of course we\r\nmust gain all that they shall lose. Much mischief we may certainly do.\r\nThe power inadequate to all other things is often more than sufficient\r\nfor this. I do not look on the direct and immediate power of the\r\nColonies to resist our violence as very formidable. In this, however,\r\nI may be mistaken. But when I consider that we have Colonies for no\r\npurpose but to be serviceable to us, it seems to my poor understanding\r\na little preposterous to make them unserviceable in order to keep them\r\nobedient. It is, in truth, nothing more than the old and, as I thought,\r\nexploded problem of tyranny, which proposes to beggar its subjects\r\ninto submission. But remember, when you have completed your system of\r\nimpoverishment, that nature still proceeds in her ordinary course;\r\nthat discontent will increase with misery; and that there are critical\r\nmoments in the fortune of all states when they who are too weak to\r\ncontribute to your prosperity may be strong enough to complete your\r\nruin. Spoliatis arma supersunt. [Footnote: 34]\r\n\r\nThe temper and character which prevail in our Colonies are, I am afraid,\r\nunalterable by any human art. We cannot, I fear, falsify the pedigree\r\nof this fierce people, and persuade them that they are not sprung from\r\na nation in whose veins the blood of freedom circulates. The language\r\nin which they would hear you tell them this tale would detect the\r\nimposition; your speech would betray you. [Footnote: 35] An Englishman\r\nis the unfittest person on earth to argue another Englishman into\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nI think it is nearly as little in our power to change their republican\r\nreligion as their free descent; or to substitute the Roman Catholic as\r\na penalty, or the Church of England as an improvement. The mode of\r\ninquisition and dragooning is going out of fashion in the Old World, and\r\nI should not confide much to their efficacy in the New. The education\r\nof the Americans is also on the same unalterable bottom with their\r\nreligion. You cannot persuade them to burn their books of curious\r\nscience; to banish their lawyers from their courts of laws; or to quench\r\nthe lights of their assemblies by refusing to choose those persons who\r\nare best read in their privileges. It would be no less impracticable\r\nto think of wholly annihilating the popular assemblies in which these\r\nlawyers sit. The army, by which we must govern in their place, would be\r\nfar more chargeable to us, not quite so effectual, and perhaps in the\r\nend full as difficult to be kept in obedience. With regard to the high\r\naristocratic spirit of Virginia and the Southern Colonies, it has been\r\nproposed, I know, to reduce it by declaring a general enfranchisement of\r\ntheir slaves. This object has had its advocates and panegyrists; yet I\r\nnever could argue myself into any opinion of it. Slaves are often much\r\nattached to their masters. A general wild offer of liberty would\r\nnot always be accepted. History furnishes few instances of it. It is\r\nsometimes as hard to persuade slaves [Footnote: 36] to be free, as it is\r\nto compel freemen to be slaves; and in this auspicious scheme we should\r\nhave both these pleasing tasks on our hands at once. But when we talk\r\nof enfranchisement, do we not perceive that the American master may\r\nenfranchise too, and arm servile hands in defence of freedom?--a measure\r\nto which other people have had recourse more than once, and not without\r\nsuccess, in a desperate situation of their affairs.\r\n\r\nSlaves as these unfortunate black people are, and dull as all men are\r\nfrom slavery, must they not a little suspect the offer of freedom from\r\nthat very nation which has sold them to their present masters?--from\r\nthat nation, one of whose causes of quarrel [Footnote: 37] with those\r\nmasters is their refusal to deal any more in that inhuman traffic? An\r\noffer of freedom from England would come rather oddly, shipped to\r\nthem in an African vessel which is refused an entry into the ports of\r\nVirginia or Carolina with a cargo of three hundred Angola negroes.\r\nIt would be curious to see the Guinea captain attempting at the same\r\ninstant to publish his proclamation of liberty, and to advertise his\r\nsale of slaves.\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose all these moral difficulties got over. The ocean\r\nremains. You cannot pump this dry; and as long as it continues in its\r\npresent bed, so long all the causes which weaken authority by distance\r\nwill continue.\r\n\r\n     \"Ye gods, annihilate but space and time,\r\n     And make two lovers happy!\"\r\n\r\nwas a pious and passionate prayer; but just as reasonable as many of the\r\nserious wishes of grave and solemn politicians.\r\n\r\nIf then, Sir, it seems almost desperate to think of any alterative\r\ncourse for changing the moral causes, and not quite easy to remove the\r\nnatural, which produce prejudices irreconcilable to the late exercise\r\nof our authority--but that the spirit infallibly will continue, and,\r\ncontinuing, will produce such effects as now embarrass us--the second\r\nmode under consideration is to prosecute that spirit in its overt acts\r\nas criminal.\r\n\r\nAt this proposition I must pause a moment. The thing seems a great\r\ndeal too big for my ideas of jurisprudence. It should seem to my way of\r\nconceiving such matters that there is a very wide difference, in reason\r\nand policy, between the mode of proceeding on the irregular conduct of\r\nscattered individuals, or even of bands of men who disturb order within\r\nthe state, and the civil dissensions which may, from time to time, on\r\ngreat questions, agitate the several communities which compose a great\r\nempire. It looks to me to be narrow and pedantic to apply the ordinary\r\nideas of criminal justice to this great public contest. I do not know\r\nthe method of drawing up an indictment against a whole people. I cannot\r\ninsult and ridicule the feelings of millions of my fellow-creatures as\r\nSir Edward Coke insulted one excellent individual (Sir Walter Raleigh)\r\nat the bar. I hope I am not ripe to pass sentence on the gravest public\r\nbodies, intrusted with magistracies of great authority and dignity, and\r\ncharged with the safety of their fellow-citizens, upon the very\r\nsame title that I am. I really think that, for wise men, this is not\r\njudicious; for sober men, not decent; for minds tinctured with humanity,\r\nnot mild and merciful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, Sir, I am mistaken in my idea of an empire, as distinguished\r\nfrom a single state or kingdom. But my idea of it is this; that an\r\nempire is the aggregate of many states under one common head, whether\r\nthis head be a monarch or a presiding republic. It does, in such\r\nconstitutions, frequently happen--and nothing but the dismal, cold, dead\r\nuniformity of servitude can prevent its happening--that the subordinate\r\nparts have many local privileges and immunities. Between these\r\nprivileges and the supreme common authority the line may be extremely\r\nnice. Of course disputes, often, too, very bitter disputes, and much ill\r\nblood, will arise. But though every privilege is an exemption, in the\r\ncase, from the ordinary exercise of the supreme authority, it is no\r\ndenial of it. The claim of a privilege seems rather, ex vi termini,\r\n[Footnote: 38] to imply a superior power; for to talk of the privileges\r\nof a state or of a person who has no superior is hardly any better than\r\nspeaking nonsense. Now, in such unfortunate quarrels among the component\r\nparts of a great political union of communities, I can scarcely conceive\r\nanything more completely imprudent than for the head of the empire to\r\ninsist that, if any privilege is pleaded against his will or his acts,\r\nhis whole authority is denied; instantly to proclaim rebellion, to beat\r\nto arms, and to put the offending provinces under the ban. Will not\r\nthis, Sir, very soon teach the provinces to make no distinctions on\r\ntheir part? Will it not teach them that the government, against which a\r\nclaim of liberty is tantamount to high treason, is a government to\r\nwhich submission is equivalent to slavery? It may not always be quite\r\nconvenient to impress dependent communities with such an idea.\r\n\r\nWe are, indeed, in all disputes with the Colonies, by the necessity of\r\nthings, the judge. It is true, Sir. But I confess that the character of\r\njudge in my own cause is a thing that frightens me. Instead of filling\r\nme with pride, I am exceedingly humbled by it. I cannot proceed with a\r\nstern, assured, judicial confidence, until I find myself in something\r\nmore like a judicial character. I must have these hesitations as long\r\nas I am compelled to recollect that, in my little reading upon such\r\ncontests as these, the sense of mankind has at least as often decided\r\nagainst the superior as the subordinate power. Sir, let me add, too,\r\nthat the opinion of my having some abstract right [Footnote: 39] in my\r\nfavor would not put me much at my ease in passing sentence, unless I\r\ncould be sure that there were no rights which, in their exercise under\r\ncertain circumstances, were not the most odious of all wrongs and the\r\nmost vexatious of all injustice. Sir, these considerations have great\r\nweight with me when I find things so circumstanced, that I see the\r\nsame party at once a civil litigant against me in point of right and a\r\nculprit before me, while I sit as a criminal judge on acts of his whose\r\nmoral quality is to be decided upon the merits of that very litigation.\r\nMen are every now and then put, by the complexity of human affairs, into\r\nstrange situations; but justice is the same, let the judge be in what\r\nsituation he will.\r\n\r\nThere is, Sir, also a circumstance which convinces me that this mode\r\nof criminal proceeding is not, at least in the present stage of our\r\ncontest, altogether expedient; which is nothing less than the conduct\r\nof those very persons who have seemed to adopt that mode by lately\r\ndeclaring a rebellion in Massachusetts Bay, as they had formerly\r\naddressed to have traitors brought hither, under an Act of Henry the\r\nEighth, [Footnote: 40] for trial. For though rebellion is declared, it\r\nis not proceeded against as such, nor have any steps been taken towards\r\nthe apprehension or conviction of any individual offender, either on\r\nour late or our former Address; but modes of public coercion have been\r\nadopted, and such as have much more resemblance to a sort of qualified\r\nhostility towards an independent power than the punishment of rebellious\r\nsubjects. All this seems rather inconsistent; but it shows how difficult\r\nit is to apply these juridical ideas to our present case.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, let us seriously and coolly ponder. What is it we\r\nhave got by all our menaces, which have been many and ferocious? What\r\nadvantage have we derived from the penal laws we have passed, and which,\r\nfor the time, have been severe and numerous? What advances have we made\r\ntowards our object by the sending of a force which, by land and sea, is\r\nno contemptible strength? Has the disorder abated? Nothing less. When I\r\nsee things in this situation after such confident hopes, bold promises,\r\nand active exertions, I cannot, for my life, avoid a suspicion that the\r\nplan itself is not correctly right. [Footnote: 41]\r\n\r\nIf, then, the removal of the causes of this spirit of American liberty\r\nbe for the greater part, or rather entirely, impracticable; if the\r\nideas of criminal process be inapplicable--or, if applicable, are in the\r\nhighest degree inexpedient; what way yet remains? No way is open but the\r\nthird and last,--to comply with the American spirit as necessary; or, if\r\nyou please, to submit to it as a necessary evil.\r\n\r\nIf we adopt this mode,--if we mean to conciliate and concede,--let us\r\nsee of what nature the concession ought to be. To ascertain the nature\r\nof our concession, we must look at their complaint. The Colonies\r\ncomplain that they have not the characteristic mark and seal of British\r\nfreedom. They complain that they are taxed in a Parliament in which\r\nthey are not represented. If you mean to satisfy them at all, you must\r\nsatisfy them with regard to this complaint. If you mean to please any\r\npeople you must give them the boon which they ask; not what you may\r\nthink better for them, but of a kind totally different. Such an act may\r\nbe a wise regulation, but it is no concession; whereas our present theme\r\nis the mode of giving satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSir, I think you must perceive that I am resolved this day to have\r\nnothing at all to do with the question of the right of taxation. Some\r\ngentlemen start--but it is true; I put it totally out of the question.\r\nIt is less than nothing in my consideration. I do not indeed wonder,\r\nnor will you, Sir, that gentlemen of profound learning are fond of\r\ndisplaying it on this profound subject. But my consideration is narrow,\r\nconfined, and wholly limited to the policy of the question. I do not\r\nexamine whether the giving away a man's money be a power excepted\r\nand reserved out of the general trust of government, and how far all\r\nmankind, in all forms of polity, are entitled to an exercise of that\r\nright by the charter of nature; or whether, on the contrary, a right\r\nof taxation is necessarily involved in the general principle of\r\nlegislation, and inseparable from the ordinary supreme power. These are\r\ndeep questions, where great names militate against each other, where\r\nreason is perplexed, and an appeal to authorities only thickens the\r\nconfusion; for high and reverend authorities lift up their heads on both\r\nsides, and there is no sure footing in the middle. This point is the\r\ngreat\r\n\r\n     \"Serbonian bog,\r\n     Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,\r\n     Where armies whole have sunk.\"\r\n     [Footnote: 42]\r\n\r\nI do not intend to be overwhelmed in that bog, though in such\r\nrespectable company. The question [Footnote: 43] with me is, not whether\r\nyou have a right to render your people miserable, but whether it is not\r\nyour interest to make them happy. It is not what a lawyer tells me I MAY\r\ndo, but what humanity, reason, and justice tell me I OUGHT to do. Is a\r\npolitic act the worse for being a generous one? Is no concession proper\r\nbut that which is made from your want of right to keep what you grant?\r\nOr does it lessen the grace or dignity of relaxing in the exercise of\r\nan odious claim because you have your evidence-room full of titles, and\r\nyour magazines stuffed with arms to enforce them? What signify all those\r\ntitles, and all those arms? Of what avail are they, when the reason\r\nof the thing tells me that the assertion of my title is the loss of my\r\nsuit, and that I could do nothing but wound myself by the use of my own\r\nweapons?\r\n\r\nSuch is steadfastly my opinion of the absolute necessity of keeping up\r\nthe concord of this Empire by an unity of spirit, though in a diversity\r\nof operations, that, if I were sure the Colonists had, at their leaving\r\nthis country, sealed a regular compact of servitude; that they had\r\nsolemnly abjured all the rights of citizens; that they had made a vow\r\nto renounce all ideas of liberty for them and their posterity to all\r\ngenerations; yet I should hold myself obliged to conform to the temper I\r\nfound universally prevalent in my own day, and to govern two million\r\nof men, impatient of servitude, on the principles of freedom. I am not\r\ndetermining a point of law, I am restoring tranquillity; and the\r\ngeneral character and situation of a people must determine what sort of\r\ngovernment is fitted for them. That point nothing else can or ought to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nMy idea, therefore, without considering whether we yield as matter\r\nof right, or grant as matter of favor, is to admit the people of our\r\nColonies into an interest in the Constitution; and, by recording that\r\nadmission in the journals of Parliament, to give them as strong an\r\nassurance as the nature of the thing will admit, that we mean forever to\r\nadhere to that solemn declaration of systematic indulgence.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the repeal of a revenue Act, upon its understood\r\nprinciple, might have served to show that we intended an unconditional\r\nabatement of the exercise of a taxing power. Such a measure was then\r\nsufficient to remove all suspicion, and to give perfect content. But\r\nunfortunate events since that time may make something further necessary;\r\nand not more necessary for the satisfaction of the Colonies than for the\r\ndignity and consistency of our own future proceedings.\r\n\r\nI have taken a very incorrect measure of the disposition of the House if\r\nthis proposal in itself would be received with dislike. I think, Sir, we\r\nhave few American financiers. But our misfortune is, we are too acute,\r\nwe are too exquisite [Footnote: 44] in our conjectures of the future,\r\nfor men oppressed with such great and present evils. The more moderate\r\namong the opposers of Parliamentary concession freely confess that\r\nthey hope no good from taxation, but they apprehend the Colonists have\r\nfurther views; and if this point were conceded, they would instantly\r\nattack the trade laws. [Footnote: 45] These gentlemen are convinced\r\nthat this was the intention from the beginning, and the quarrel of\r\nthe Americans with taxation was no more than a cloak and cover to\r\nthis design. Such has been the language even of a gentleman of real\r\nmoderation, and of a natural temper well adjusted to fair and equal\r\ngovernment. I am, however, Sir, not a little surprised at this kind of\r\ndiscourse, whenever I hear it; and I am the more surprised on account of\r\nthe arguments which I constantly find in company with it, and which are\r\noften urged from the same mouths and on the same day.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when we allege that it is against reason to tax a people\r\nunder so many restraints in trade as the Americans, the noble lord in\r\nthe blue ribbon shall tell you that the restraints on trade are futile\r\nand useless--of no advantage to us, and of no burthen to those on whom\r\nthey are imposed; that the trade to America is not secured by the\r\nActs of Navigation, but by the natural and irresistible advantage of a\r\ncommercial preference.\r\n\r\nSuch is the merit of the trade laws in this posture of the debate. But\r\nwhen strong internal circumstances are urged against the taxes; when\r\nthe scheme is dissected; when experience and the nature of things are\r\nbrought to prove, and do prove, the utter impossibility of obtaining an\r\neffective revenue from the Colonies; when these things are pressed, or\r\nrather press themselves, so as to drive the advocates of Colony taxes to\r\na clear admission of the futility of the scheme; then, Sir, the sleeping\r\ntrade laws revive from their trance, and this useless taxation is to be\r\nkept sacred, not for its own sake, but as a counterguard and security of\r\nthe laws of trade.\r\n\r\nThen, Sir, you keep up revenue laws which are mischievous, in order to\r\npreserve trade laws that are useless. Such is the wisdom of our plan in\r\nboth its members. They are separately given up as of no value, and yet\r\none is always to be defended for the sake of the other; but I cannot\r\nagree with the noble lord, nor with the pamphlet from whence he seems\r\nto have borrowed these ideas concerning the inutility of the trade laws.\r\nFor, without idolizing them, I am sure they are still, in many ways,\r\nof great use to us; and in former times they have been of the greatest.\r\nThey do confine, and they do greatly narrow, the market for the\r\nAmericans; but my perfect conviction of this does not help me in the\r\nleast to discern how the revenue laws form any security whatsoever to\r\nthe commercial regulations, or that these commercial regulations are the\r\ntrue ground of the quarrel, or that the giving way, in any one instance\r\nof authority, is to lose all that may remain unconceded.\r\n\r\nOne fact is clear and indisputable. The public and avowed origin of this\r\nquarrel was on taxation. This quarrel has indeed brought on new disputes\r\non new questions; but certainly the least bitter, and the fewest of all,\r\non the trade laws. To judge which of the two be the real radical cause\r\nof quarrel, we have to see whether the commercial dispute did, in order\r\nof time, precede the dispute on taxation? There is not a shadow of\r\nevidence for it. Next, to enable us to judge whether at this moment a\r\ndislike to the trade laws be the real cause of quarrel, it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to put the taxes out of the question by a repeal. See how the\r\nAmericans act in this position, and then you will be able to discern\r\ncorrectly what is the true object of the controversy, or whether any\r\ncontroversy at all will remain. Unless you consent to remove this\r\ncause of difference, it is impossible, with decency, to assert that the\r\ndispute is not upon what it is avowed to be. And I would, Sir, recommend\r\nto your serious consideration whether it be prudent to form a rule for\r\npunishing people, not on their own acts, but on your conjectures? Surely\r\nit is preposterous at the very best. It is not justifying your anger\r\nby their misconduct, but it is converting your ill-will into their\r\ndelinquency.\r\n\r\nBut the Colonies will go further. Alas! alas! when will this speculation\r\nagainst fact and reason end? What will quiet these panic fears which we\r\nentertain of the hostile effect of a conciliatory conduct? Is it true\r\nthat no case can exist in which it is proper for the sovereign to accede\r\nto the desires of his discontented subjects? Is there anything peculiar\r\nin this case to make a rule for itself? Is all authority of course lost\r\nwhen it is not pushed to the extreme? Is it a certain maxim that the\r\nfewer causes of dissatisfaction are left by government, the more the\r\nsubject will be inclined to resist and rebel?\r\n\r\nAll these objections being in fact no more than suspicions, conjectures,\r\ndivinations, formed in defiance of fact and experience, they did\r\nnot, Sir, discourage me from entertaining the idea of a conciliatory\r\nconcession founded on the principles which I have just stated.\r\n\r\nIn forming a plan for this purpose, I endeavored to put myself in that\r\nframe of mind which was the most natural and the most reasonable, and\r\nwhich was certainly the most probable means of securing me from all\r\nerror. I set out with a perfect distrust of my own abilities, a total\r\nrenunciation of every speculation of my own, and with a profound\r\nreverence for the wisdom of our ancestors who have left us the\r\ninheritance of so happy a constitution and so flourishing an empire,\r\nand, what is a thousand times more valuable, the treasury of the maxims\r\nand principles which formed the one and obtained the other.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of the kings of Spain of the Austrian family, whenever\r\nthey were at a loss in the Spanish councils, it was common for their\r\nstatesmen to say that they ought to consult the genius of Philip the\r\nSecond. The genius of Philip the Second might mislead them, and the\r\nissue of their affairs showed that they had not chosen the most perfect\r\nstandard; but, Sir, I am sure that I shall not be misled when, in a\r\ncase of constitutional difficulty, I consult the genius of the English\r\nConstitution. Consulting at that oracle--it was with all due humility\r\nand piety--I found four capital examples in a similar case before me;\r\nthose of Ireland, Wales, Chester, and Durham.\r\n\r\nIreland, before the English conquest, [Footnote: 46] though never\r\ngoverned by a despotic power, had no Parliament. How far the English\r\nParliament itself was at that time modelled according to the present\r\nform is disputed among antiquaries; but we have all the reason in the\r\nworld to be assured that a form of Parliament such as England then\r\nenjoyed she instantly communicated to Ireland, and we are equally sure\r\nthat almost every successive improvement in constitutional liberty, as\r\nfast as it was made here, was transmitted thither. The feudal baronage\r\nand the feudal knighthood, the roots of our primitive Constitution, were\r\nearly transplanted into that soil, and grew and flourished there. Magna\r\nCharta, if it did not give us originally the House of Commons, gave\r\nus at least a House of Commons of weight and consequence. But your\r\nancestors did not churlishly sit down alone to the feast of Magna\r\nCharta. Ireland was made immediately a partaker. This benefit of English\r\nlaws and liberties, I confess, was not at first extended to all Ireland.\r\nMark the consequence. English authority and English liberties had\r\nexactly the same boundaries. Your standard could never be advanced an\r\ninch before your privileges. Sir John Davis shows beyond a doubt that\r\nthe refusal of a general communication of these rights was the true\r\ncause why Ireland was five hundred years in subduing; and after the\r\nvain projects of a military government, attempted in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, it was soon discovered that nothing could make that country\r\nEnglish, in civility and allegiance, but your laws and your forms of\r\nlegislature. It was not English arms, but the English Constitution,\r\nthat conquered Ireland. From that time Ireland has ever had a general\r\nParliament, as she had before a partial Parliament. You changed the\r\npeople; you altered the religion; but you never touched the form or the\r\nvital substance of free government in that kingdom. You deposed kings;\r\n[Footnote: 47] you restored them; you altered the succession to theirs,\r\nas well as to your own Crown; but you never altered their Constitution,\r\nthe principle of which was respected by usurpation, restored with the\r\nrestoration of monarchy, and established, I trust, forever, by the\r\nglorious Revolution. This has made Ireland the great and flourishing\r\nkingdom that it is, and, from a disgrace and a burthen intolerable\r\nto this nation, has rendered her a principal part of our strength and\r\nornament. This country cannot be said to have ever formally taxed her.\r\nThe irregular things done in the confusion of mighty troubles and on the\r\nhinge of great revolutions, even if all were done that is said to have\r\nbeen done, form no example. If they have any effect in argument, they\r\nmake an exception to prove the rule. None of your own liberties could\r\nstand a moment, if the casual deviations from them at such times were\r\nsuffered to be used as proofs of their nullity. By the lucrative amount\r\nof such casual breaches in the Constitution, judge what the stated and\r\nfixed rule of supply has been in that kingdom. Your Irish pensioners\r\nwould starve, if they had no other fund to live on than taxes granted\r\nby English authority. Turn your eyes to those popular grants from whence\r\nall your great supplies are come, and learn to respect that only source\r\nof public wealth in the British Empire.\r\n\r\nMy next example is Wales. This country was said to be reduced by Henry\r\nthe Third. It was said more truly to be so by Edward the First. But\r\nthough then conquered, it was not looked upon as any part of the realm\r\nof England. Its old Constitution, whatever that might have been, was\r\ndestroyed, and no good one was substituted in its place. The care of\r\nthat tract was put into the hands of Lords Marchers [Footnote: 48]--a\r\nform of government of a very singular kind; a strange heterogeneous\r\nmonster, something between hostility and government; perhaps it has a\r\nsort of resemblance, according to the modes of those terms, to that of\r\nCommander-in-chief at present, to whom all civil power is granted as\r\nsecondary. The manners of the Welsh nation followed the genius of\r\nthe government. The people were ferocious, restive, savage, and\r\nuncultivated; sometimes composed, never pacified. Wales, within itself,\r\nwas in perpetual disorder, and it kept the frontier of England in\r\nperpetual alarm. Benefits from it to the state there were none. Wales\r\nwas only known to England by incursion and invasion.\r\n\r\nSir, during that state of things, Parliament was not idle. They\r\nattempted to subdue the fierce spirit of the Welsh by all sorts of\r\nrigorous laws. They prohibited by statute the sending all sorts of arms\r\ninto Wales, as you prohibit by proclamation (with something more of\r\ndoubt on the legality) the sending arms to America. They disarmed the\r\nWelsh by statute, as you attempted (but still with more question on the\r\nlegality) to disarm New England by an instruction. They made an Act to\r\ndrag offenders from Wales into England for trial, as you have done (but\r\nwith more hardship) with regard to America. By another Act, where one\r\nof the parties was an Englishman, they ordained that his trial should be\r\nalways by English. They made Acts to restrain trade, as you do; and they\r\nprevented the Welsh from the use of fairs and markets, as you do the\r\nAmericans from fisheries and foreign ports. In short, when the Statute\r\nBook was not quite so much swelled as it is now, you find no less than\r\nfifteen acts of penal regulation on the subject of Wales.\r\n\r\nHere we rub our hands.--A fine body of precedents for the authority of\r\nParliament and the use of it!--I admit it fully; and pray add likewise\r\nto these precedents that all the while Wales rid this Kingdom like an\r\nincubus, that it was an unprofitable and oppressive burthen, and that\r\nan Englishman travelling in that country could not go six yards from the\r\nhigh road without being murdered.\r\n\r\nThe march of the human mind is slow. Sir, it was not until after two\r\nhundred years discovered that, by an eternal law, providence had decreed\r\nvexation to violence, and poverty to rapine. Your ancestors did however\r\nat length open their eyes to the ill-husbandry of injustice. They found\r\nthat the tyranny of a free people could of all tyrannies the least be\r\nendured, and that laws made against a whole nation were not the most\r\neffectual methods of securing its obedience. Accordingly, in the\r\ntwenty-seventh year of Henry the Eighth the course was entirely altered.\r\nWith a preamble stating the entire and perfect rights of the Crown of\r\nEngland, it gave to the Welsh all the rights and privileges of English\r\nsubjects. A political order was established; the military power gave way\r\nto the civil; the Marches were turned into Counties. But that a nation\r\nshould have a right to English liberties, and yet no share at all in\r\nthe fundamental security of these liberties--the grant of their own\r\nproperty--seemed a thing so incongruous that, eight years after,\r\nthat is, in the thirty-fifth of that reign, a complete and not\r\nill-proportioned representation by counties and boroughs was bestowed\r\nupon Wales by Act of Parliament. From that moment, as by a charm, the\r\ntumults subsided; obedience was restored; peace, order, and civilization\r\nfollowed in the train of liberty. When the day-star of the English\r\nConstitution had arisen in their hearts, all was harmony within and\r\nwithout--\r\n\r\n     \"--simul alba nautis\r\n       Stella refulsit,\r\n     Defluit saxis agitatus humor;\r\n     Concidunt venti, fugiuntque nubes,\r\n     Et minax (quod sic voluere) ponto\r\n       Unda recumbit.\"\r\n     [Footnote: 49]\r\n\r\nThe very same year the County Palatine of Chester received the same\r\nrelief from its oppressions and the same remedy to its disorders.\r\nBefore this time Chester was little less distempered than Wales. The\r\ninhabitants, without rights themselves, were the fittest to destroy the\r\nrights of others; and from thence Richard the Second drew the standing\r\narmy of archers with which for a time he oppressed England. The people\r\nof Chester applied to Parliament in a petition penned as I shall read to\r\nyou:\r\n\r\n   \"To the King, our Sovereign Lord, in most hunible wise\r\n   shewen unto your excellent Majesty the inhabitants of\r\n   your Grace's County Palatine of Chester: (1) That where\r\n   the said County Palatine of Chester is and hath been always\r\n   hitherto exempt, excluded, and separated out and\r\n   from your High Court of Parliament, to have any Knights\r\n   and Burgesses within the said Court; by reason whereof\r\n   the said inhabitants have hitherto sustained manifold\r\n   disherisons, losses, and damages, as well in their lands,\r\n   goods, and bodies, as in the good, civil, and politic governance\r\n   and maintenance of the commonwealth of their said\r\n   county; (2) And forasmuch as the said inhabitants have\r\n   always hitherto been bound by the Acts and Statutes\r\n   made and ordained by your said Highness and your most\r\n   noble progenitors, by authority of the said Court, as far\r\n   forth as other counties, cities, and boroughs have been,\r\n   that have had their Knights and Burgesses within your\r\n   said Court of Parliament, and yet have had neither Knight\r\n   ne Burgess there for the said County Palatine, the said\r\n   inhabitants, for lack thereof, have been oftentime touched\r\n   and grieved with Acts and Statutes made within the said\r\n   Court, as well derogatory unto the most ancient jurisdictions,\r\n   liberties, and privileges of your said County Palatine,\r\n   as prejudicial unto the commonwealth, quietness,\r\n   rest, and peace of your Grace's most bounden subjects\r\n   inhabiting within the same.\"\r\n\r\nWhat did Parliament with this audacious address?--Reject it as a libel?\r\nTreat it as an affront to Government? Spurn it as a derogation from the\r\nrights of legislature? Did they toss it over the table? Did they burn\r\nit by the hands of the common hangman?--They took the petition of\r\ngrievance, all rugged as it was, without softening or temperament,\r\nunpurged of the original bitterness and indignation of complaint--they\r\nmade it the very preamble to their Act of redress, and consecrated its\r\nprinciple to all ages in the sanctuary of legislation.\r\n\r\nHere is my third example. It was attended with the success of the two\r\nformer. Chester, civilized as well as Wales, has demonstrated that\r\nfreedom, and not servitude, is the cure of anarchy; as religion, and\r\nnot atheism, is the true remedy for superstition. Sir, this pattern of\r\nChester was followed in the reign of Charles the Second with regard to\r\nthe County Palatine of Durham, which is my fourth example. This county\r\nhad long lain out of the pale of free legislation. So scrupulously was\r\nthe example of Chester followed that the style of the preamble is\r\nnearly the same with that of the Chester Act, and, without affecting the\r\nabstract extent of the authority of Parliament, it recognizes the equity\r\nof not suffering any considerable district in which the British subjects\r\nmay act as a body, to be taxed without their own voice in the grant.\r\n\r\nNow if the doctrines of policy contained in these preambles, and the\r\nforce of these examples in the Acts of Parliaments, avail anything, what\r\ncan be said against applying them with regard to America? Are not the\r\npeople of America as much Englishmen as the Welsh? The preamble of\r\nthe Act of Henry the Eighth says the Welsh speak a language no way\r\nresembling that of his Majesty's English subjects. Are the Americans not\r\nas numerous? If we may trust the learned and accurate Judge Barrington's\r\naccount of North Wales, and take that as a standard to measure the rest,\r\nthere is no comparison. The people cannot amount to above 200,000; not a\r\ntenth part of the number in the Colonies. Is America in rebellion? Wales\r\nwas hardly ever free from it. Have you attempted to govern America\r\nby penal statutes? You made fifteen for Wales. But your legislative\r\nauthority is perfect with regard to America. Was it less perfect in\r\nWales, Chester, and Durham? But America is virtually represented. What!\r\ndoes the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over\r\nthe Atlantic than pervade Wales,--which lies in your neighborhood--or\r\nthan Chester and Durham, surrounded by abundance of representation that\r\nis actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of\r\nvirtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for\r\nthe freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and\r\ncomparatively so inconsiderable. How then can I think it sufficient for\r\nthose which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?\r\n\r\nYou will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing\r\nto you a scheme for a representation of the Colonies in Parliament.\r\nPerhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great\r\nflood stops me in my course. Opposuit natura. [Footnote: 50 ]--I cannot\r\nremove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I\r\ndo not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory,[Footnote: 51] I\r\ndo not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation;\r\nbut I do not see my way to it, and those who have been more confident\r\nhave not been more successful. However, the arm of public benevolence is\r\nnot shortened, and there are often several means to the same end. What\r\nnature has disjoined in one way, wisdom may unite in another. When\r\nwe cannot give the benefit as we would wish, let us not refuse it\r\naltogether. If we cannot give the principal, let us find a substitute.\r\nBut how? Where? What substitute?\r\n\r\nFortunately I am not obliged, for the ways and means of this substitute,\r\nto tax my own unproductive invention. I am not even obliged to go to the\r\nrich treasury of the fertile framers of imaginary commonwealths--not\r\nto the Republic of Plato, [Footnote: 52] not to the Utopia of More,\r\n[Footnote: 52] not to the Oceana of Harrington. It is before me--it is\r\nat my feet,\r\n\r\n   \"And the rude swain Treads daily on it with his clouted shoon.\"\r\n   [Footnote: 53]\r\n\r\nI only wish you to recognize, for the theory, the ancient constitutional\r\npolicy of this kingdom with regard to representation, as that policy has\r\nbeen declared in Acts of Parliament; and as to the practice, to return\r\nto that mode which a uniform experience has marked out to you as best,\r\nand in which you walked with security, advantage, and honor, until the\r\nyear 1763. [Footnote: 54]\r\n\r\nMy Resolutions therefore mean to establish the equity and justice of a\r\ntaxation of America by GRANT, and not by IMPOSITION; to mark the LEGAL\r\nCOMPETENCY [Footnote: 55] of the Colony Assemblies for the support\r\nof their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to\r\nacknowledge that this legal competency has had a DUTIFUL AND BENEFICIAL\r\nEXERCISE; and that experience has shown the BENEFIT OF THEIR GRANTS and\r\nthe FUTILITY OF PARLIAMENTARY TAXATION as a method of supply.\r\n\r\nThese solid truths compose six fundamental propositions. There are three\r\nmore Resolutions corollary to these. If you admit the first set, you\r\ncan hardly reject the others. But if you admit the first, I shall be far\r\nfrom solicitous whether you accept or refuse the last. I think these six\r\nmassive pillars will be of strength sufficient to support the temple of\r\nBritish concord. I have no more doubt than I entertain of my existence\r\nthat, if you admitted these, you would command an immediate peace, and,\r\nwith but tolerable future management, a lasting obedience in America.\r\nI am not arrogant in this confident assurance. The propositions are all\r\nmere matters of fact, and if they are such facts as draw irresistible\r\nconclusions even in the stating, this is the power of truth, and not any\r\nmanagement of mine.\r\n\r\nSir, I shall open the whole plan to you, together with such observations\r\non the motions as may tend to illustrate them where they may want\r\nexplanation. The first is a Resolution--\r\n\r\n\"That the Colonies and Plantations of Great Britain in North America,\r\nconsisting of fourteen separate Governments, and containing two millions\r\nand upwards of free inhabitants, have not had the liberty and privilege\r\nof electing and sending any Knights and Burgesses, or others, to\r\nrepresent them in the High Court of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a plain matter of fact, necessary to be laid down, and,\r\nexcepting the description, it is laid down in the language of the\r\nConstitution; it is taken nearly verbatim from Acts of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe second is like unto the first--\r\n\r\n\"That the said Colonies and Plantations have been liable to, and bounden\r\nby, several subsidies, payments, rates, and taxes given and granted\r\nby Parliament, though the said Colonies and Plantations have not their\r\nKnights and Burgesses in the said High Court of Parliament, of their own\r\nelection, to represent the condition of their country; by lack whereof\r\nthey have been oftentimes touched and grieved by subsidies given,\r\ngranted, and assented to, in the said Court, in a manner prejudicial to\r\nthe commonwealth, quietness, rest, and peace of the subjects inhabiting\r\nwithin the same.\"\r\n\r\nIs this description too hot, or too cold; too strong, or too weak? Does\r\nit arrogate too much to the supreme legislature? Does it lean too much\r\nto the claims of the people? If it runs into any of these errors,\r\nthe fault is not mine. It is the language of your own ancient Acts of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n     \"Non meus hic sermo, sed quae praecepit Ofellus,\r\n     Rusticus, abnormis sapiens.\"\r\n     [Footnote: 56]\r\n\r\nIt is the genuine produce of the ancient, rustic, manly, homebred sense\r\nof this country.--I did not dare to rub off a particle of the venerable\r\nrust that rather adorns and preserves, than destroys, the metal. It\r\nwould be a profanation to touch with a tool the stones which construct\r\nthe sacred altar of peace. I would not violate with modern polish the\r\ningenuous and noble roughness of these truly Constitutional materials.\r\nAbove all things, I was resolved not to be guilty of tampering, the\r\nodious vice of restless and unstable minds. I put my foot in the tracks\r\nof our forefathers, where I can neither wander nor stumble. Determining\r\nto fix articles of peace, I was resolved not to be wise beyond what\r\nwas written; I was resolved to use nothing else than the form of sound\r\nwords, to let others abound in their own sense, and carefully to abstain\r\nfrom all expressions of my own. What the law has said, I say. In all\r\nthings else I am silent. I have no organ but for her words. This, if it\r\nbe not ingenious, I am sure is safe. [Footnote: 57]\r\n\r\nThere are indeed words expressive of grievance in this second\r\nResolution, which those who are resolved always to be in the right will\r\ndeny to contain matter of fact, as applied to the present case, although\r\nParliament thought them true with regard to the counties of Chester\r\nand Durham. They will deny that the Americans were ever \"touched and\r\ngrieved\" with the taxes. If they consider nothing in taxes but their\r\nweight as pecuniary impositions, there might be some pretence for\r\nthis denial; but men may be sorely touched and deeply grieved in their\r\nprivileges, as well as in their purses. Men may lose little in property\r\nby the act which takes away all their freedom. When a man is robbed of a\r\ntrifle on the highway, it is not the twopence lost that constitutes\r\nthe capital outrage. This is not confined to privileges. Even ancient\r\nindulgences, withdrawn without offence on the part of those who enjoyed\r\nsuch favors, operate as grievances. But were the Americans then not\r\ntouched and grieved by the taxes, in some measure, merely as taxes?\r\nIf so, why were they almost all either wholly repealed, or exceedingly\r\nreduced? Were they not touched and grieved even by the regulating duties\r\nof the sixth of George the Second? Else, why were the duties first\r\nreduced to one third in 1764, and afterwards to a third of that third\r\nin the year 1766? Were they not touched and grieved by the Stamp Act?\r\nI shall say they were, until that tax is revived. Were they not touched\r\nand grieved by the duties of 1767, which were likewise repealed, and\r\nwhich Lord Hillsborough tells you, for the Ministry, were laid contrary\r\nto the true principle of commerce? Is not the assurance given by that\r\nnoble person to the Colonies of a resolution to lay no more taxes on\r\nthem an admission that taxes would touch and grieve them? Is not the\r\nResolution of the noble lord in the blue ribbon, now standing on your\r\nJournals, the strongest of all proofs that Parliamentary subsidies\r\nreally touched and grieved them? Else why all these changes,\r\nmodifications, repeals, assurances, and resolutions?\r\n\r\nThe next proposition is--\r\n\r\n\"That, from the distance of the said Colonies, and from other\r\ncircumstances, no method hath hitherto been devised for procuring a\r\nrepresentation in Parliament for the said Colonies.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an assertion of a fact, I go no further on the paper, though, in\r\nmy private judgment, a useful representation is impossible--I am sure it\r\nis not desired by them, nor ought it perhaps by us--but I abstain from\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Resolution is--\r\n\r\n\"That each of the said Colonies hath within itself a body, chosen in\r\npart, or in the whole, by the freemen, free-holders, or other free\r\ninhabitants thereof, commonly called the General Assembly, or General\r\nCourt, with powers legally to raise, levy, and assess, according to the\r\nseveral usage of such Colonies duties and taxes towards defraying all\r\nsorts of public services.\"\r\n\r\nThis competence in the Colony Assemblies is certain. It is proved by the\r\nwhole tenor of their Acts of Supply in all the Assemblies, in which\r\nthe constant style of granting is, \"an aid to his Majesty\", and Acts\r\ngranting to the Crown have regularly for near a century passed\r\nthe public offices without dispute. Those who have been pleased\r\nparadoxically to deny this right, holding that none but the British\r\nParliament can grant to the Crown, are wished to look to what is done,\r\nnot only in the Colonies, but in Ireland, in one uniform unbroken tenor\r\nevery session. Sir, I am surprised that this doctrine should come from\r\nsome of the law servants of the Crown. I say that if the Crown could be\r\nresponsible, his Majesty--but certainly the Ministers,--and even these\r\nlaw officers themselves through whose hands the Acts passed, biennially\r\nin Ireland, or annually in the Colonies--are in an habitual course of\r\ncommitting impeachable offences. What habitual offenders have been all\r\nPresidents of the Council, all Secretaries of State, all First Lords of\r\nTrade, all Attorneys and all Solicitors General! However, they are safe,\r\nas no one impeaches them; and there is no ground of charge against them\r\nexcept in their own unfounded theories.\r\n\r\nThe fifth Resolution is also a resolution of fact--\r\n\r\n  \"That the said General Assemblies, General Courts, or other\r\n  bodies legally qualified as aforesaid, have at sundry times\r\n  freely granted several large subsidies and public aids for\r\n  his Majesty's service, according to their abilities, when\r\n  required thereto by letter from one of his Majesty's\r\n  principal Secretaries of State; and that their right to grant the\r\n  same, and their cheerfulness and sufficiency in the said\r\n  grants, have been at sundry times acknowledged by Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nTo say nothing of their great expenses in the Indian wars, and not to\r\ntake their exertion in foreign ones so high as the supplies in the year\r\n1695--not to go back to their public contributions in the year 1710--I\r\nshall begin to travel only where the journals give me light, resolving\r\nto deal in nothing but fact, authenticated by Parliamentary record, and\r\nto build myself wholly on that solid basis.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of April, 1748, a Committee of this House came to the\r\nfollowing resolution:\r\n\r\n  \"Resolved: That it is the opinion of this Committee that it is\r\n  just and reasonable that the several Provinces and Colonies\r\n  of Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and\r\n  Rhode Island, be reimbursed the expenses they have been\r\n  at in taking and securing to the Crown of Great Britain,\r\n  the Island of Cape Breton and its dependencies.\"\r\n\r\nThe expenses were immense for such Colonies. They were above L200,000\r\nsterling; money first raised and advanced on their public credit.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January, 1756, a message from the King came to us, to\r\nthis effect:\r\n\r\n  \"His Majesty, being sensible of the zeal and vigor with which\r\n  his faithful subjects of certain Colonies in North America\r\n  have exerted themselves in defence of his Majesty's just\r\n  rights and possessions, recommends it to this House to\r\n  take the same into their consideration, and to enable his\r\n  Majesty to give them such assistance as may be a proper\r\n  reward and encouragement.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of February, 1756, the House came to a suitable Resolution,\r\nexpressed in words nearly the same as those of the message, but with the\r\nfurther addition, that the money then voted was as an encouragement to\r\nthe Colonies to exert themselves with vigor. It will not be necessary to\r\ngo through all the testimonies which your own records have given to\r\nthe truth of my Resolutions. I will only refer you to the places in the\r\nJournals:\r\n\r\n  Vol. xxvii.--16th and 19th May, 1757.\r\n  Vol. xxviii.--June 1st, 1758; April 26th and 30th, 1759;\r\n          March 26th and 31st, and April 28th, 1760;\r\n          Jan. 9th and 20th, 1761.\r\n  Vol. xxix.--Jan. 22d and 26th, 1762; March 14th and 17th,\r\n         1763.\r\n\r\nSir, here is the repeated acknowledgment of Parliament that the\r\nColonies not only gave, but gave to satiety. This nation has formally\r\nacknowledged two things: first, that the Colonies had gone beyond their\r\nabilities, Parliament having thought it necessary to reimburse them;\r\nsecondly, that they had acted legally and laudably in their grants\r\nof money, and their maintenance of troops, since the compensation is\r\nexpressly given as reward and encouragement. Reward is not bestowed for\r\nacts that are unlawful; and encouragement is not held out to things that\r\ndeserve reprehension. My Resolution therefore does nothing more than\r\ncollect into one proposition what is scattered through your Journals. I\r\ngive you nothing but your own; and you cannot refuse in the gross what\r\nyou have so often acknowledged in detail. The admission of this, which\r\nwill be so honorable to them and to you, will, indeed, be mortal to\r\nall the miserable stories by which the passions of the misguided people\r\n[Footnote: 58] have been engaged in an unhappy system. The people heard,\r\nindeed, from the beginning of these disputes, one thing continually\r\ndinned in their ears, that reason and justice demanded that the\r\nAmericans, who paid no taxes, should be compelled to contribute. How did\r\nthat fact of their paying nothing stand when the taxing system began?\r\nWhen Mr. Grenville began to form his system of American revenue, he\r\nstated in this House that the Colonies were then in debt two millions\r\nsix hundred thousand pounds sterling money, and was of opinion they\r\nwould discharge that debt in four years. On this state, those untaxed\r\npeople were actually subject to the payment of taxes to the amount of\r\nsix hundred and fifty thousand a year. In fact, however, Mr. Grenville\r\nwas mistaken. The funds given for sinking the debt did not prove quite\r\nso ample as both the Colonies and he expected. The calculation was too\r\nsanguine; the reduction was not completed till some years after, and at\r\ndifferent times in different Colonies. However, the taxes after the war\r\ncontinued too great to bear any addition, with prudence or propriety;\r\nand when the burthens imposed in consequence of former requisitions were\r\ndischarged, our tone became too high to resort again to requisition. No\r\nColony, since that time, ever has had any requisition whatsoever made to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe see the sense of the Crown, and the sense of Parliament, on the\r\nproductive nature of a REVENUE BY GRANT. Now search the same Journals\r\nfor the produce of the REVENUE BY IMPOSITION. Where is it? Let us know\r\nthe volume and the page. What is the gross, what is the net produce? To\r\nwhat service is it applied? How have you appropriated its surplus? What!\r\nCan none of the many skilful index-makers that we are now employing find\r\nany trace of it?--Well, let them and that rest together. But are the\r\nJournals, which say nothing of the revenue, as silent on the discontent?\r\nOh no! a child may find it. It is the melancholy burthen and blot of\r\nevery page.\r\n\r\nI think, then, I am, from those Journals, justified in the sixth and\r\nlast Resolution, which is---\r\n\r\n\"That it hath been found by experience that the manner of granting the\r\nsaid supplies and aids, by the said General Assemblies, hath been more\r\nagreeable to the said Colonies, and more beneficial and conducive to the\r\npublic service, than the mode of giving and granting aids in Parliament,\r\nto be raised and paid in the said Colonies.\"\r\n\r\nThis makes the whole of the fundamental part of the plan. The conclusion\r\nis irresistible. You cannot say that you were driven by any necessity to\r\nan exercise of the utmost rights of legislature. You cannot assert that\r\nyou took on yourselves the task of imposing Colony taxes from the want\r\nof another legal body that is competent to the purpose of supplying the\r\nexigencies of the state without wounding the prejudices of the\r\npeople. Neither is it true that the body so qualified, and having that\r\ncompetence, had neglected the duty.\r\n\r\nThe question now, on all this accumulated matter, is: whether you will\r\nchoose to abide by a profitable experience, or a mischievous theory;\r\nwhether you choose to build on imagination, or fact; whether you prefer\r\nenjoyment, or hope; satisfaction in your subjects, or discontent?\r\n\r\nIf these propositions are accepted, everything which has been made to\r\nenforce a contrary system must, I take it for granted, fall along with\r\nit. On that ground, I have drawn the following Resolution, which, when\r\nit comes to be moved, will naturally be divided in a proper manner:\r\n\r\n\"That it may be proper to repeal an Act [Footnote: 59] made in the\r\nseventh year of the reign of his present Majesty, entitled, An Act\r\nfor granting certain duties in the British Colonies and Plantations\r\nin America; for allowing a drawback of the duties of customs upon the\r\nexportation from this Kingdom of coffee and cocoa-nuts of the produce\r\nof the said Colonies or Plantations; for discontinuing the drawbacks\r\npayable on china earthenware exported to America; and for more\r\neffectually preventing the clandestine running of goods in the said\r\nColonies and Plantations. And that it may be proper to repeal an Act\r\n[Footnote: 60] made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his present\r\nMajesty, entitled, An Act to discontinue, in such manner and for such\r\ntime as are therein mentioned, the landing and discharging, lading or\r\nshipping of goods, wares, and merchandise at the town and within\r\nthe harbor of Boston, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in North\r\nAmerica. And that it may be proper to repeal an Act made in the\r\nfourteenth year of the reign of his present Majesty, entitled, An Act\r\nfor the impartial administration of justice [Footnote: 61] in the cases\r\nof persons questioned for any acts done by them in the execution of the\r\nlaw, or for the suppression of riots and tumults, in the Province of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, in New England. And that it may be proper to repeal\r\nan Act made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his present Majesty,\r\nentitled, An Act for the better regulating [Footnote: 62] of the\r\nGovernment of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay, in New England.\r\nAnd also that it may be proper to explain and amend an Act made in the\r\nthirty-fifth year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth, entitled, An\r\nAct for the Trial of Treasons [Footnote: 63] committed out of the King's\r\nDominions.\"\r\n\r\nI wish, Sir, to repeal the Boston Port Bill, because--independently of\r\nthe dangerous precedent of suspending the rights of the subject during\r\nthe King's pleasure--it was passed, as I apprehend, with less regularity\r\nand on more partial principles than it ought. The corporation of Boston\r\nwas not heard before it was condemned. Other towns, full as guilty as\r\nshe was, have not had their ports blocked up. Even the Restraining Bill\r\nof the present session does not go to the length of the Boston Port\r\nAct. The same ideas of prudence which induced you not to extend equal\r\npunishment to equal guilt, even when you were punishing, induced me,\r\nwho mean not to chastise, but to reconcile, to be satisfied with the\r\npunishment already partially inflicted.\r\n\r\nIdeas of prudence and accommodation to circumstances prevent you from\r\ntaking away the charters of Connecticut and Rhode Island, as you have\r\ntaken away that of Massachusetts Bay, though the Crown has far less\r\npower in the two former provinces than it enjoyed in the latter, and\r\nthough the abuses have been full as great, and as flagrant, in\r\nthe exempted as in the punished. The same reasons of prudence\r\nand accommodation have weight with me in restoring the charter of\r\nMassachusetts Bay. Besides, Sir, the Act which changes the charter of\r\nMassachusetts is in many particulars so exceptionable that if I did not\r\nwish absolutely to repeal, I would by all means desire to alter it,\r\nas several of its provisions tend to the subversion of all public and\r\nprivate justice. Such, among others, is the power in the Governor to\r\nchange the sheriff at his pleasure, and to make a new returning officer\r\nfor every special cause. It is shameful to behold such a regulation\r\nstanding among English laws.\r\n\r\nThe Act for bringing persons accused of committing murder, under the\r\norders of Government to England for trial, is but temporary. That Act\r\nhas calculated the probable duration of our quarrel with the Colonies,\r\nand is accommodated to that supposed duration. I would hasten the happy\r\nmoment of reconciliation, and therefore must, on my principle, get rid\r\nof that most justly obnoxious Act.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Henry the Eighth, for the Trial of Treasons, I do not mean\r\nto take away, but to confine it to its proper bounds and original\r\nintention; to make it expressly for trial of treasons--and the greatest\r\ntreasons may be committed--in places where the jurisdiction of the Crown\r\ndoes not extend.\r\n\r\nHaving guarded the privileges of local legislature, I would next secure\r\nto the Colonies a fair and unbiassed judicature, for which purpose, Sir,\r\nI propose the following Resolution:\r\n\r\n\"That, from the time when the General Assembly or General Court of any\r\nColony or Plantation in North America shall have appointed by Act of\r\nAssembly, duly confirmed, a settled salary to the offices of the Chief\r\nJustice and other Judges of the Superior Court, it may be proper that\r\nthe said Chief Justice and other Judges of the Superior Courts of such\r\nColony shall hold his and their office and offices during their good\r\nbehavior, and shall not be removed therefrom but when the said removal\r\nshall be adjudged by his Majesty in Council, upon a hearing on complaint\r\nfrom the General Assembly, or on a complaint from the Governor, or\r\nCouncil, or the House of Representatives severally, or of the Colony in\r\nwhich the said Chief Justice and other Judges have exercised the said\r\noffices.\"\r\n\r\nThe next Resolution relates to the Courts of Admiralty. It is this.\r\n\r\n\"That it may be proper to regulate the Courts of Admiralty or Vice\r\nAdmiralty authorized by the fifteenth Chapter of the Fourth of George\r\nthe Third, in such a manner as to make the same more commodious to those\r\nwho sue, or are sued, in the said Courts, and to provide for the more\r\ndecent maintenance of the Judges in the same.\"\r\n\r\nThese courts I do not wish to take away, they are in themselves proper\r\nestablishments. This court is one of the capital securities of the\r\nAct of Navigation. The extent of its jurisdiction, indeed, has been\r\nincreased, but this is altogether as proper, and is indeed on many\r\naccounts more eligible, where new powers were wanted, than a court\r\nabsolutely new. But courts incommodiously situated, in effect, deny\r\njustice, and a court partaking in the fruits of its own condemnation is\r\na robber. The Congress complain, and complain justly, of this grievance.\r\n\r\nThese are the three consequential propositions I have thought of two or\r\nthree more, but they come rather too near detail, and to the province\r\nof executive government, which I wish Parliament always to superintend,\r\nnever to assume. If the first six are granted, congruity will carry the\r\nlatter three. If not, the things that remain unrepealed will be, I\r\nhope, rather unseemly incumbrances on the building, than very materially\r\ndetrimental to its strength and stability.\r\n\r\nHere, Sir, I should close, but I plainly perceive some objections\r\nremain which I ought, if possible, to remove. The first will be that, in\r\nresorting to the doctrine of our ancestors, as contained in the preamble\r\nto the Chester Act, I prove too much, that the grievance from a want\r\nof representation, stated in that preamble, goes to the whole of\r\nlegislation as well as to taxation, and that the Colonies, grounding\r\nthemselves upon that doctrine, will apply it to all parts of legislative\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nTo this objection, with all possible deference and humility, and wishing\r\nas little as any man living to impair the smallest particle of our\r\nsupreme authority, I answer, that the words are the words of Parliament,\r\nand not mine, and that all false and inconclusive inferences drawn from\r\nthem are not mine, for I heartily disclaim any such inference. I have\r\nchosen the words of an Act of Parliament which Mr. Grenville, surely\r\na tolerably zealous and very judicious advocate for the sovereignty of\r\nParliament, formerly moved to have read at your table in confirmation of\r\nhis tenets. It is true that Lord Chatham considered these preambles as\r\ndeclaring strongly in favor of his opinions. He was a no less powerful\r\nadvocate for the privileges of the Americans. Ought I not from hence to\r\npresume that these preambles are as favorable as possible to both, when\r\nproperly understood; favorable both to the rights of Parliament, and to\r\nthe privilege of the dependencies of this Crown? But, Sir, the object of\r\ngrievance in my Resolution I have not taken from the Chester, but from\r\nthe Durham Act, which confines the hardship of want of representation\r\nto the case of subsidies, and which therefore falls in exactly with the\r\ncase of the Colonies. But whether the unrepresented counties were de\r\njure or de facto [Footnote: 64] bound, the preambles do not accurately\r\ndistinguish, nor indeed was it necessary; for, whether de jure or de\r\nfacto, the Legislature thought the exercise of the power of taxing as\r\nof right, or as of fact without right, equally a grievance, and equally\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\nI do not know that the Colonies have, in any general way, or in any cool\r\nhour, gone much beyond the demand of humanity in relation to taxes. It\r\nis not fair to judge of the temper or dispositions of any man, or any\r\nset of men, when they are composed and at rest, from their conduct\r\nor their expressions in a state of disturbance and irritation. It\r\nis besides a very great mistake to imagine that mankind follow up\r\npractically any speculative principle, either of government or of\r\nfreedom, as far as it will go in argument and logical illation. We\r\nEnglishmen stop very short of the principles upon which we support any\r\ngiven part of our Constitution, or even the whole of it together. I\r\ncould easily, if I had not already tired you, give you very striking\r\nand convincing instances of it. This is nothing but what is natural and\r\nproper. All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every\r\nvirtue, and every prudent act, is founded on compromise and barter. We\r\nbalance inconveniences; we give and take; we remit some rights, that we\r\nmay enjoy others; and we choose rather to be happy citizens than subtle\r\ndisputants. As we must give away some natural liberty to enjoy civil\r\nadvantages, so we must sacrifice some civil liberties for the advantages\r\nto be derived from the communion and fellowship of a great empire. But,\r\nin all fair dealings, the thing bought must bear some proportion to the\r\npurchase paid. None will barter away the immediate jewel of his soul.\r\n[Footnote: 65] Though a great house is apt to make slaves haughty, yet\r\nit is purchasing a part of the artificial importance of a great empire\r\ntoo dear to pay for it all essential rights and all the intrinsic\r\ndignity of human nature. None of us who would not risk his life rather\r\nthan fall under a government purely arbitrary. But although there are\r\nsome amongst us who think our Constitution wants many improvements\r\nto make it a complete system of liberty, perhaps none who are of that\r\nopinion would think it right to aim at such improvement by disturbing\r\nhis country, and risking everything that is dear to him. In every\r\narduous enterprise we consider what we are to lose, as well as what\r\nwe are to gain; and the more and better stake of liberty every people\r\npossess, the less they will hazard in a vain attempt to make it more.\r\nThese are the cords of man. Man acts from adequate motives relative to\r\nhis interest, and not on metaphysical speculations. Aristotle, the great\r\nmaster of reasoning, cautions us, and with great weight and propriety,\r\nagainst this species of delusive geometrical accuracy in moral arguments\r\nas the most fallacious of all sophistry.\r\n\r\nThe Americans will have no interest contrary to the grandeur and glory\r\nof England, when they are not oppressed by the weight of it; and\r\nthey will rather be inclined to respect the acts of a superintending\r\nlegislature when they see them the acts of that power which is itself\r\nthe security, not the rival, of their secondary importance. In this\r\nassurance my mind most perfectly acquiesces, and I confess I feel not\r\nthe least alarm from the discontents which are to arise from putting\r\npeople at their ease, nor do I apprehend the destruction of this Empire\r\nfrom giving, by an act of free grace and indulgence, to two millions of\r\nmy fellow-citizens some share of those rights upon which. I have always\r\nbeen taught to value myself.\r\n\r\nIt is said, indeed, that this power of granting, vested in American\r\nAssemblies, would dissolve the unity of the Empire, which was preserved\r\nentire, although Wales, and Chester, and Durham were added to it. Truly,\r\nMr. Speaker, I do not know what this unity means, nor has it ever been\r\nheard of, that I know, in the constitutional policy of this country. The\r\nvery idea of subordination of parts excludes this notion of simple and\r\nundivided unity. England is the head; but she is not the head and the\r\nmembers too. Ireland has ever had from the beginning a separate, but not\r\nan independent, legislature, which, far from distracting, promoted the\r\nunion of the whole. Everything was sweetly and harmoniously disposed\r\nthrough both islands for the conservation of English dominion, and\r\nthe communication of English liberties. I do not see that the same\r\nprinciples might not be carried into twenty islands and with the same\r\ngood effect. This is my model with regard to America, as far as the\r\ninternal circumstances of the two countries are the same. I know no\r\nother unity of this Empire than I can draw from its example during these\r\nperiods, when it seemed to my poor understanding more united than it is\r\nnow, or than it is likely to be by the present methods.\r\n\r\nBut since I speak of these methods, I recollect, Mr. Speaker, almost\r\ntoo late, that I promised, before I finished, to say something of the\r\nproposition of the noble lord on the floor, which has been so lately\r\nreceived and stands on your Journals. I must be deeply concerned\r\nwhenever it is my misfortune to continue a difference with the majority\r\nof this House; but as the reasons for that difference are my apology for\r\nthus troubling you, suffer me to state them in a very few words. I shall\r\ncompress them into as small a body as I possibly can, having already\r\ndebated that matter at large when the question was before the Committee.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, I cannot admit that proposition of a ransom [Footnote: 66]\r\nby auction; because it is a mere project. It is a thing new, unheard of;\r\nsupported by no experience; justified by no analogy; without example\r\nof our ancestors, or root in the Constitution. It is neither regular\r\nParliamentary taxation, nor Colony grant. Experimentum in corpore vili\r\n[Footnote: 67] is a good rule, which will ever make me adverse to any\r\ntrial of experiments on what is certainly the most valuable of all\r\nsubjects, the peace of this Empire.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is an experiment which must be fatal in the end to our\r\nConstitution. For what is it but a scheme for taxing the Colonies in the\r\nante-chamber of the noble lord and his successors? To settle the quotas\r\nand proportions in this House is clearly impossible. You, Sir, may\r\nflatter yourself you shall sit a state auctioneer, with your hammer in\r\nyour hand, and knock down to each Colony as it bids. But to settle, on\r\nthe plan laid down by the noble lord, the true proportional payment for\r\nfour or five and twenty governments according to the absolute and the\r\nrelative wealth of each, and according to the British proportion of\r\nwealth and burthen, is a wild and chimerical notion. This new taxation\r\nmust therefore come in by the back door of the Constitution. Each quota\r\nmust be brought to this House ready formed; you can neither add nor\r\nalter. You must register it. You can do nothing further, for on what\r\ngrounds can you deliberate either before or after the proposition? You\r\ncannot hear the counsel for all these provinces, quarrelling each on\r\nits own quantity of payment, and its proportion to others If you should\r\nattempt it, the Committee of Provincial Ways and Means, or by whatever\r\nother name it will delight to be called, must swallow up all the time of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it does not give satisfaction to the complaint of the Colonies.\r\nThey complain that they are taxed without their consent, you answer,\r\nthat you will fix the sum at which they shall be taxed. That is, you\r\ngive them the very grievance for the remedy. You tell them, indeed, that\r\nyou will leave the mode to themselves. I really beg pardon--it gives me\r\npain to mention it--but you must be sensible that you will not perform\r\nthis part of the compact. For, suppose the Colonies were to lay the\r\nduties, which furnished their contingent, upon the importation of your\r\nmanufactures, you know you would never suffer such a tax to be laid. You\r\nknow, too, that you would not suffer many other modes of taxation, so\r\nthat, when you come to explain yourself, it will be found that you\r\nwill neither leave to themselves the quantum nor the mode, nor indeed\r\nanything. The whole is delusion from one end to the other.\r\n\r\nFourthly, this method of ransom by auction, unless it be universally\r\naccepted, will plunge you into great and inextricable difficulties. In\r\nwhat year of our Lord are the proportions of payments to be settled? To\r\nsay nothing of the impossibility that Colony agents should have general\r\npowers of taxing the Colonies at their discretion, consider, I implore\r\nyou, that the communication by special messages and orders between these\r\nagents and their constituents, on each variation of the case, when\r\nthe parties come to contend together and to dispute on their relative\r\nproportions, will be a matter of delay, perplexity, and confusion that\r\nnever can have an end.\r\n\r\nIf all the Colonies do not appear at the outcry, what is the condition\r\nof those assemblies who offer, by themselves or their agents, to tax\r\nthemselves up to your ideas of their proportion? The refractory\r\nColonies who refuse all composition will remain taxed only to your old\r\nimpositions, which, however grievous in principle, are trifling as to\r\nproduction. The obedient Colonies in this scheme are heavily taxed, the\r\nrefractory remain unburdened. What will you do? Will you lay new and\r\nheavier taxes by Parliament on the disobedient? Pray consider in what\r\nway you can do it. You are perfectly convinced that, in the way of\r\ntaxing, you can do nothing but at the ports. Now suppose it is Virginia\r\nthat refuses to appear at your auction, while Maryland and North\r\nCarolina bid handsomely for their ransom, and are taxed to your quota,\r\nhow will you put these Colonies on a par? Will you tax the tobacco of\r\nVirginia? If you do, you give its death-wound to your English revenue\r\nat home, and to one of the very greatest articles of your own foreign\r\ntrade. If you tax the import of that rebellious Colony, what do you\r\ntax but your own manufactures, or the goods of some other obedient and\r\nalready well-taxed Colony? Who has said one word on this labyrinth of\r\ndetail, which bewilders you more and more as you enter into it? Who\r\nhas presented, who can present you with a clue to lead you out of it?\r\nI think, Sir, it is impossible that you should not recollect that the\r\nColony bounds are so implicated in one another,--you know it by\r\nyour other experiments in the bill for prohibiting the New England\r\nfishery,--that you can lay no possible restraints on almost any of them\r\nwhich may not be presently eluded, if you do not confound the innocent\r\nwith the guilty, and burthen those whom, upon every principle, you ought\r\nto exonerate. He must be grossly ignorant of America who thinks that,\r\nwithout falling into this confusion of all rules of equity and policy,\r\nyou can restrain any single Colony, especially Virginia and Maryland,\r\nthe central and most important of them all.\r\n\r\nLet it also be considered that, either in the present confusion you\r\nsettle a permanent contingent, which will and must be trifling, and\r\nthen you have no effectual revenue; or you change the quota at every\r\nexigency, and then on every new repartition you will have a new quarrel.\r\n\r\nReflect, besides, that when you have fixed a quota for every Colony,\r\nyou have not provided for prompt and punctual payment. Suppose one, two,\r\nfive, ten years' arrears. You cannot issue a Treasury Extent against\r\nthe failing Colony. You must make new Boston Port Bills, new restraining\r\nlaws, new acts for dragging men to England for trial. You must send out\r\nnew fleets, new armies. All is to begin again. From this day forward the\r\nEmpire is never to know an hour's tranquillity. An intestine fire will\r\nbe kept alive in the bowels of the Colonies, which one time or other\r\nmust consume this whole Empire. I allow indeed that the empire of\r\nGermany raises her revenue and her troops by quotas and contingents;\r\nbut the revenue of the empire, and the army of the empire, is the worst\r\nrevenue and the worst army in the world.\r\n\r\nInstead of a standing revenue, you will therefore have a perpetual\r\nquarrel. Indeed, the noble lord who proposed this project of a ransom\r\nby auction seems himself to be of that opinion. His project was rather\r\ndesigned for breaking the union of the Colonies than for establishing a\r\nrevenue. He confessed he apprehended that his proposal would not be to\r\ntheir taste. I say this scheme of disunion seems to be at the bottom of\r\nthe project; for I will not suspect that the noble lord meant nothing\r\nbut merely to delude the nation by an airy phantom which he never\r\nintended to realize. But whatever his views may be, as I propose the\r\npeace and union of the Colonies as the very foundation of my plan, it\r\ncannot accord with one whose foundation is perpetual discord.\r\n\r\nCompare the two. This I offer to give you is plain and simple. The other\r\nfull of perplexed and intricate mazes. This is mild; that harsh. This\r\nis found by experience effectual for its purposes; the other is a new\r\nproject. This is universal; the other calculated for certain Colonies\r\nonly. This is immediate in its conciliatory operation; the other remote,\r\ncontingent, full of hazard. Mine is what becomes the dignity of a ruling\r\npeople--gratuitous, unconditional, and not held out as a matter of\r\nbargain and sale. I have done my duty in proposing it to you. I have\r\nindeed tired you by a long discourse; but this is the misfortune of\r\nthose to whose influence nothing will be conceded, and who must win\r\nevery inch of their ground by argument. You have heard me with goodness.\r\nMay you decide with wisdom! For my part, I feel my mind greatly\r\ndisburthened by what I have done to-day. I have been the less fearful\r\nof trying your patience, because on this subject I mean to spare it\r\naltogether in future. I have this comfort, that in every stage of the\r\nAmerican affairs I have steadily opposed the measures that have produced\r\nthe confusion, and may bring on the destruction, of this Empire. I now\r\ngo so far as to risk a proposal of my own. If I cannot give peace to my\r\ncountry, I give it to my conscience.\r\n\r\nBut what, says the financier, is peace to us without money? Your plan\r\ngives us no revenue. No! But it does; for it secures to the subject the\r\npower or refusal, the first of all revenues. Experience is a cheat, and\r\nfact a liar, if this power in the subject of proportioning his grant, or\r\nof not granting at all, has not been found the richest mine of revenue\r\never discovered by the skill or by the fortune of man. It does not\r\nindeed vote you L152,750 11s. 23/4d, nor any other paltry limited sum;\r\nbut it gives the strong box itself, the fund, the bank--from whence only\r\nrevenues can arise amongst a people sensible of freedom. Posita luditur\r\narca. [Footnote: 68] Cannot you, in England--cannot you, at this time\r\nof day--cannot you, a House of Commons, trust to the principle which has\r\nraised so mighty a revenue, and accumulated a debt of near 140,000,000\r\nin this country? Is this principle to be true in England, and false\r\neverywhere else? Is it not true in Ireland? Has it not hitherto been\r\ntrue in the Colonies? Why should you presume that, in any country, a\r\nbody duly constituted for any function will neglect to perform its\r\nduty and abdicate its trust? Such a presumption [Footnote: 69] would\r\ngo against all governments in all modes. But, in truth, this dread of\r\npenury of supply from a free assembly has no foundation in nature; for\r\nfirst, observe that, besides the desire which all men have naturally of\r\nsupporting the honor of their own government, that sense of dignity and\r\nthat security to property which ever attends freedom has a tendency to\r\nincrease the stock of the free community. Most may be taken where most\r\nis accumulated. And what is the soil or climate where experience has not\r\nuniformly proved that the voluntary flow of heaped-up plenty, bursting\r\nfrom the weight of its own rich luxuriance, has ever run with a more\r\ncopious stream of revenue than could be squeezed from the dry husks of\r\noppressed indigence by the straining of all the politic machinery in the\r\nworld? [Footnote: 70]\r\n\r\nNext, we know that parties must ever exist in a free country. We know,\r\ntoo, that the emulations of such parties--their contradictions, their\r\nreciprocal necessities, their hopes, and their fears--must send them all\r\nin their turns to him that holds the balance of the State. The parties\r\nare the gamesters; but Government keeps the table, and is sure to be the\r\nwinner in the end. When this game is played, I really think it is more\r\nto be feared that the people will be exhausted, than that Government\r\nwill not be supplied; whereas, whatever is got by acts of absolute\r\npower ill obeyed, because odious, or by contracts ill kept, because\r\nconstrained, will be narrow, feeble, uncertain, and precarious.\r\n\r\n\"Ease would retract Vows made in pain, as violent and void.\"\r\n\r\nI, for one, protest against compounding our demands. I declare against\r\ncompounding, for a poor limited sum, the immense, ever-growing, eternal\r\ndebt which is due to generous government from protected freedom. And so\r\nmay I speed in the great object I propose to you, as I think it would\r\nnot only be an act of injustice, but would be the worst economy in the\r\nworld, to compel the Colonies to a sum certain, either in the way of\r\nransom or in the way of compulsory compact.\r\n\r\nBut to clear up my ideas on this subject: a revenue from America\r\ntransmitted hither--do not delude yourselves--you never can receive it;\r\nno, not a shilling. We have experience that from remote countries it\r\nis not to be expected. If, when you attempted to extract revenue\r\nfrom Bengal, you were obliged to return in loan what you had taken in\r\nimposition, what can you expect from North America? For certainly, if\r\never there was a country qualified to produce wealth, it is India; or\r\nan institution fit for the transmission, it is the East India Company.\r\nAmerica has none of these aptitudes. If America gives you taxable\r\nobjects on which you lay your duties here, and gives you, at the same\r\ntime, a surplus by a foreign sale of her commodities to pay the duties\r\non these objects which you tax at home, she has performed her part to\r\nthe British revenue. But with regard to her own internal establishments,\r\nshe may, I doubt not she will, contribute in moderation. I say in\r\nmoderation, for she ought not to be permitted to exhaust herself. She\r\nought to be reserved to a war, the weight of which, with the enemies\r\n[Footnote: 71] that we are most likely to have, must be considerable\r\nin her quarter of the globe. There she may serve you, and serve you\r\nessentially.\r\n\r\nFor that service--for all service, whether of revenue, trade, or\r\nempire--my trust is in her interest in the British Constitution. My hold\r\nof the Colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names,\r\nfrom kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These\r\nare ties which, though light as air, [Footnote: 72] are as strong as\r\nlinks of iron. Let the Colonists always keep the idea of their civil\r\nrights associated with your government,--they will cling and grapple to\r\nyou, [Footnote: 73] and no force under heaven will be of power to tear\r\nthem from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your\r\ngovernment may be one thing, and their privileges another, that these\r\ntwo things may exist without any mutual relation, the cement is gone\r\n[Footnote: 74]--the cohesion is loosened--and everything hastens to\r\ndecay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the\r\nsovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the\r\nsacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race\r\nand sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards\r\nyou. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more\r\nardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience.\r\nSlavery they can have anywhere--it is a weed that grows in every soil.\r\nThey may have it from Spain; they may have it from Prussia. But, until\r\nyou become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural\r\ndignity, freedom they can have from none but you. This is the commodity\r\nof price of which you have the monopoly. This is the true Act of\r\nNavigation which binds to you the commerce of the Colonies, and\r\nthrough them secures to you the wealth of the world. Deny them this\r\nparticipation of freedom, and you break that sole bond which originally\r\nmade, and must still preserve, the unity of the Empire. Do not entertain\r\nso weak an imagination as that your registers and your bonds, your\r\naffidavits and your sufferances, your cockets and your clearances, are\r\nwhat form the great securities of your commerce. Do not dream that your\r\nletters of office, and your instructions, and your suspending clauses,\r\nare the things that hold together the great contexture of the mysterious\r\nwhole. These things do not make your government. Dead instruments,\r\npassive tools as they are, it is the spirit of the English communion\r\nthat gives all their life and efficacy to them. It is the spirit of the\r\nEnglish Constitution which, infused through the mighty mass, pervades,\r\nfeeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies every part of the Empire, even down\r\nto the minutest member.\r\n\r\nIs it not the same virtue which does everything for us here in England?\r\nDo you imagine, then, that it is the Land Tax Act which raises your\r\nrevenue? that it is the annual vote in the Committee of Supply which\r\ngives you your army? or that it is the Mutiny Bill which inspires\r\nit with bravery and discipline? No! surely no! It is the love of the\r\npeople; it is their attachment to their government, from the sense of\r\nthe deep stake they have in such a glorious institution, which gives you\r\nyour army and your navy, and infuses into both that liberal obedience\r\nwithout which your army would be a base rabble, and your navy nothing\r\nbut rotten timber.\r\n\r\nAll this, I know well enough, will sound wild and chimerical to the\r\nprofane herd [Footnote: 75] of those vulgar and mechanical politicians\r\nwho have no place among us; a sort of people who think that nothing\r\nexists but what is gross and material, and who, therefore, far from\r\nbeing qualified to be directors of the great movement of empire, are\r\nnot fit to turn a wheel in the machine. But to men truly initiated and\r\nrightly taught, these ruling and master principles which, in the opinion\r\nof such men as I have mentioned, have no substantial existence, are in\r\ntruth everything, and all in all. Magnanimity [Footnote: 76] in politics\r\nis not seldom the truest wisdom; and a great empire and little minds go\r\nill together. If we are conscious of our station, and glow with zeal\r\nto fill our places as becomes our situation and ourselves, we ought to\r\nauspicate [Footnote: 77] all our public proceedings on America with\r\nthe old warning of the church, Sursum corda! [Footnote: 78] We ought to\r\nelevate our minds to the greatness of that trust to which the order\r\nof providence has called us. By adverting to the dignity of this high\r\ncalling our ancestors have turned a savage wilderness into a glorious\r\nempire, and have made the most extensive and the only honorable\r\nconquests--not by destroying, but by promoting the wealth, the number,\r\nthe happiness, of the human race. Let us get an American revenue as we\r\nhave got an American empire. English privileges have made it all that it\r\nis; English privileges alone will make it all it can be.\r\n\r\nIn full confidence of this unalterable truth, I now, quod felix\r\nfaustumque sit, [Footnote: 79] lay the first stone of the Temple of\r\nPeace; and I move you--\r\n\r\n\"That the Colonies and Plantations of Great Britain in North America,\r\nconsisting of fourteen separate governments, and containing two millions\r\nand upwards of free inhabitants, have not had the liberty and privilege\r\nof electing and sending any Knights and Burgesses, or others, to\r\nrepresent them in the High Court of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 1. grand penal bill. This bill originated with Lord North.\r\nIt restricted the trade of the New England colonies to England and her\r\ndependencies. It also placed serious limitations upon the Newfoundland\r\nfisheries. The House of Lords was dissatisfied with the measure because\r\nit did not include all the colonies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 2. When I first had the honor. Burke was first elected\r\nto Parliament Dec. 26, 1765. He was at the time secretary to Lord\r\nRockingham, Prime Minister. Previous to this he had made himself\r\nthoroughly familiar with England's policy in dealing with her\r\ndependencies--notably Ireland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 3. my original sentiments. After many demonstrations both in\r\nAmerica and England the Stamp Act became a law in 1765. One of the first\r\ntasks the Rockingham ministry set itself was to bring about a repeal of\r\nthis act. Burke made his first speech in support of his party. He argued\r\nthat the abstract and theoretical rights claimed by England in matters\r\nof government should be set aside when they were unfavorable to the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of her colonies and herself. His speech was\r\ncomplimented by Pitt, and Dr. Johnson wrote that no new member had ever\r\nbefore attracted such attention.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 4. America has been kept in agitation. For a period of nearly\r\none hundred years the affairs of the colonies had been intrusted to a\r\nstanding committee appointed by Parliament. This committee was called\r\n\"The Lords of Trade.\" From its members came many if not the majority of\r\nthe propositions for the regulation of the American trade. To them the\r\ncolonial governors, who were appointed by the king, gave full accounts\r\nof the proceedings of the colonial legislatures. These reports, often\r\ncolored by personal prejudice, did not always represent the colonists in\r\nthe best light. It was mainly through the influence of one of the former\r\nLords of Trade, Charles Townshend, who afterwards became the leading\r\nvoice in the Pitt ministry, that the Stamp Act was passed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 5. a worthy member. Mr. Rose Fuller.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 6. former methods. Condense the thought in this paragraph.\r\nAre such \"methods\" practised nowadays?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 7. paper government. Burke possibly had in mind the\r\nconstitution prepared for the Carolinas by John Locke and Earl of\r\nShaftesbury. The scheme was utterly impracticable and gave cause for\r\nendless dissatisfaction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 8. Refined policy. After a careful reading of the paragraph\r\ndetermine what Burke means by \"refined policy.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 9. the project. The bill referred to had been passed by the\r\nHouse on Feb. 27. It provided that those colonies which voluntarily\r\nvoted contributions for the common defence and support of the English\r\ngovernment, and in addition made provision for the administration of\r\ntheir own civil affairs, should be exempt from taxation, except such as\r\nwas necessary for the regulation of trade. It has been declared by some\r\nthat the measure was meant in good faith and that its recognition and\r\nacceptance by the colonies would have brought good results. Burke, along\r\nwith others of the opposition, argued that the intention of the bill was\r\nto cause dissension and division among the colonies. Compare 7, 11-12.\r\nState your opinion and give reasons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 10. the noble lord in the blue ribbon Lord North (1732-1792)\r\nHe entered Parliament at the age of twenty-two, served as Lord of the\r\nTreasury, 1759; was removed by Rockingham, 1765; was again appointed\r\nby Pitt to the office of Joint Paymaster of the Forces, became Prime\r\nMinister, 1770, and resigned, 1781 Lord North is described both by\r\nhis contemporaries and later histonaus as an easy-going, indolent man,\r\nshort-sighted and rather stupid, though obstinate and courageous. He\r\nwas the willing servant of George III, and believed in the principle of\r\nauthority as opposed to that of conciliation. The blue ribbon was the\r\nbadge of the Order of the Garter instituted by Edward III Lord North\r\nwas made a Knight of the Garter, 1772. Burke often mentions the \"blue\r\nribbon\" in speaking of the Prime Minister. Why?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 11. Colony agents. It was customary for colonies to select\r\nsome one to represent them in important matters of legislation. Burke\r\nhimself served as the agent of New York. Do you think this tact accounts\r\nin any way for his attitude in this speech?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 12. our address Parliament had prepared an address to the\r\nking some months previous, in which Massachusetts was declared to be in\r\na state of rebellion. The immediate cause of this address was the\r\nBoston Tea Party.

Point out the connection between the thought here\r\nexpressed and Burke's idea of \"expediency.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 15. great consideration. This paragraph has been censured\r\nfor its too florid style. It may be rather gorgeous and rhetorical when\r\nconsidered as part of an argument, yet it is very characteristic of\r\nBurke as a writer. In no other passage of the speech is there such vivid\r\nclear-cut imagery. Note the picturesque quality of the lines and detect\r\nif you can any confusion in figures.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 16. It is good for us to be here. Burke's favorite books were\r\nShakespeare, Milton, and the Bible. Trace the above sentence to one of\r\nthese.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 17.\r\n\r\n          \"Facta parentun\r\n     Jam legere et quae sit poteris cognoscere virtus.\"\r\n           --VIRGIL'S Eclogues, IV., 26, 27]\r\n\r\nNotice the alteration.

Our ancient indulgence. \"The wise and salutary neglect,\"\r\nwhich Burke has just mentioned, was the result of (a) the struggle of\r\nCharles I. with Parliament, (b) the confusion and readjustment at the\r\nRestoration, (c) the Revolution of 1688, (d) the attitude of France\r\nin favoring the cause of the Stuarts, (e) the ascendency of the Whigs.\r\nEngland had her hands full in attending to affairs at home. As a result\r\nof this the colonies were practically their own masters in matters of\r\ngovernment. Also the political party known as the Whigs had its origin\r\nshortly before William and Mary ascended the throne. This party favored\r\nthe colonies and respected their ideas of liberty and government.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 24. great contests.

The act referred to, known as the Regulating\r\nAct, became a law May 10, 1774. It provided (a) that the council, or the\r\nhigher branch of the legislature, should be appointed by the Crown (the\r\npopular assemblies had previously selected the members of the council);\r\n(b) that officers of the common courts should be chosen by the royal\r\ngovernors, and (c) that public meetings (except for elections) should\r\nnot be held without the sanction of the king. These measures were\r\npractically ignored. By means of circular letters the colonies were\r\nfully instructed through their representatives. As a direct result of\r\nthe Regulating Act, along with other high-handed proceedings of the same\r\nsort, delegates were secretly appointed for the Continental Congress on\r\nSept. 1 at Philadelphia. The delegates from Massachusetts were Samuel\r\nAdams, John Adams, Robert Paine, and Thomas Cushing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 31. their liberties. Compare 24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 32. sudden or partial view. Goodrich, in his Select British\r\nEloquence, speaking of Burke's comprehensiveness in discussing his\r\nsubject, compares him to one standing upon an eminence, taking a large\r\nand rounded view of it on every side. The justice of this observation is\r\nseen in such instances as the above. It is this breadth and clearness of\r\nvision more than anything else that distinguishes Burke so sharply from\r\nhis contemporaries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 33. three ways. How does the first differ from the third?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 34. Spoliatis arma supersunt. Though plundered their arms\r\nstill remain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 35. your speech would betray you. \"Thy speech bewrayeth\r\nthee\"--Matt. xxvi 73. There is much justice in the observation that\r\nBurke is often verbose, yet such paragraphs as this prove how well he\r\nknew to condense and prune his expression. It is an excellent plan to\r\nselect from day to day passages of this sort and commit them to memory\r\nfor recitation when the speech has been finished.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 36. to persuade slaves. Does this suggest one of Byron's\r\npoems?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 37. causes of quarrel. The Assembly of Virginia in 1770\r\nattempted to restrict the slave trade. Other colonies made the same\r\neffort, but Parliament vetoed these measures, accompanying its action\r\nwith the blunt statement that the slave trade was profitable to England.\r\nObserve how effectively Burke uses his wide knowledge of history.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 38. ex vi termini.
