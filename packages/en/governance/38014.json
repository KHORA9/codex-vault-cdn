A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nMy aim in the preparation of this book has been to present in an\r\nelementary way the leading facts concerning the organization and\r\nactivities of national, state, and local government in the United\r\nStates. I have given rather greater emphasis than is customarily done in\r\ntextbooks of this character to what may be called the dynamics of\r\ngovernment, that is, its actual workings, as contradistinguished from\r\norganization. Likewise, I have laid especial stress upon the activities\r\nand methods of political parties, party conventions, primaries, the\r\nconduct of political campaigns, the regulation of campaign methods, and\r\nthe like. The increasing importance of citizenship has led me to devote\r\na chapter to that subject. To encourage wider reading among students, I\r\nhave added to each chapter a brief list of references to books which\r\nshould be in every high school library. The great value of illustrative\r\nmaterial as a means of acquainting students with the spirit and actual\r\nmethods of government is now recognized. For the convenience of\r\nteachers, I have therefore added at the end of each chapter a list of\r\ndocumentary and other illustrative material, most of which can be\r\nprocured without cost and all of which may be used to advantage in\r\nsupplementing the descriptive matter in the textbook. To stimulate the\r\nspirit of research and to encourage independent thinking among students,\r\nI have also added at the end of each chapter a list of search questions\r\nbearing upon the various subjects treated in the chapter.\r\n\r\nI am under obligations to a number of teachers for reading the proof\r\nsheets of this book and for giving me the benefit of their advice. Among\r\nthose to whom I am especially indebted are Mr. Clarence O. Gardner,\r\nformerly assistant in political science in the University of Illinois,\r\nMr. W. A. Beyer, of the Illinois State Normal University, Mr. C. H.\r\nElliott, of the Southern Illinois State Normal University, Mr. E. T.\r\nAustin, of the Sterling Township (Ill.)

In\r\naddition to (or sometimes instead of) the county or township government,\r\nmany of us live under a special form of government provided for urban\r\ncommunities,--cities, villages, or boroughs,--where the population is\r\ncomparatively dense and where, therefore, the somewhat simple form of\r\ngovernment provided for rural communities is insufficient. If the people\r\nof the smaller communities are allowed to choose their own public\r\nofficials and, within certain limits, to determine their own policies in\r\npublic matters of a local character, they have a system of _local\r\nself-government_. If, on the contrary, they are governed by some distant\r\ncentral authority which determines their local policies and by which\r\ntheir local officials are appointed, they live under a system of\r\n_centralized government_.\r\n\r\n=Merits of Local Self-Government.=--In the United States, the privilege\r\nof local self-government is regarded as one of the chief merits of our\r\npolitical system, and it is often declared to be one of the inalienable\r\nrights of the people. One great advantage of local self-government is\r\nthat it brings government near the door of every citizen, and permits\r\nthe people of each locality, who are most familiar with their own local\r\nconditions and who know best what are their local needs, to regulate\r\ntheir own affairs as they see fit. Also, such a system is well\r\ncalculated to secure responsibility. So long as the local authorities\r\nare chosen by the community from its own inhabitants and are constantly\r\nunder the eyes of the people, to whom they are responsible, they can be\r\nmore effectively controlled by local public opinion than is possible\r\nwhere they are chosen by authorities distantly removed. Another\r\nimportant advantage of local self-government is that it serves as a\r\ntraining school for the political education of the citizens. Allow them\r\nthe privilege of choosing their own local officials and of regulating\r\ntheir own local concerns, and their interest in public affairs will be\r\nstimulated and their political intelligence increased and broadened.\r\nThis not only will tend to secure more responsible government (local,\r\nstate, and national), but will produce a more active type of\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n=Importance of Local Government.=--With the growth and congestion of\r\npopulation in centers, and the increasing complexity of our industrial\r\nand social life, the importance of local self-government has enormously\r\nincreased. The local governments touch us at many more points to-day\r\nthan does either the state or the national government; they regulate a\r\nfar larger proportion of the concerns of our everyday life; and hence we\r\nfeel the effects of corrupt or inefficient local government more keenly\r\nthan we feel the effects of inefficient state or national government.\r\nWe depend largely upon our local governments for the maintenance of the\r\npeace, order, and security of the community; for the protection of the\r\npublic health; for the support of our schools; for the construction and\r\nmaintenance of roads and bridges; for the care of the poor; and if we\r\nlive in a city, for protection against fire, for our water supply,\r\nusually, and for many other services essential to our comfort and\r\nhappiness. Finally, the larger proportion of the taxes we pay goes\r\ntoward the support of local government--a fact which makes it very\r\nimportant that our local governments should be efficiently, honestly,\r\nand economically conducted.\r\n\r\n=Types of Local Government.=--The form of local government existing in\r\neach state is such as the state itself provides, the national government\r\nhaving no authority whatever over the matter. Such differences as exist\r\nare more largely the result of historical conditions growing out of the\r\nearly settlement of the states, than of any pronounced differences of\r\nopinion among the people in regard to forms of government. Since\r\ncolonial times there have been three general types of local rural\r\ngovernment in America: the _town system_, in New England; the _county\r\nsystem_, which originated in Virginia and spread to other colonies and\r\nstates; and the _county-township type_--a combination of the first two\r\nforms--which developed in the middle colonies of New York and\r\nPennsylvania and was carried to many Western states by settlers from the\r\nmiddle states, and is now the most common form to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n=Town and County in New England.=--The characteristic feature of the\r\ntown system of government is that the management of local affairs\r\ndevolves mainly upon the town (or township, as it is usually called\r\noutside of New England), while the county is little more than an\r\nadministrative district for judicial and election purposes. In some of\r\nthe New England states, where the town system originated and where it\r\nexists in its purest form, the county is almost ignored as an area for\r\nlocal government. In Rhode Island it performs practically no duties of\r\nlocal government and is merely a judicial district; there no county\r\nofficers are to be found except the sheriff and clerks of the courts. In\r\nthe other New England states the county plays a more important part than\r\nit does in Rhode Island, but in none of them does it share with the\r\ntowns in anything like an equal measure the burden of local government.\r\n\r\n=The New England Town.=--The towns of New England are the oldest\r\npolitical communities in America, some of them being older in fact than\r\nthe counties and states of which they are a part. Generally they vary\r\nfrom twenty to forty square miles in area, and are irregular in shape,\r\nbeing in this respect unlike the townships of many Western states, which\r\nwere laid out in squares, each with an area of thirty-six square miles.\r\nIn population they vary from a few hundred persons to more than 130,000\r\nas is the case with New Haven, which, though an incorporated city,\r\nmaintains a separate town organization.\r\n\r\n=Powers of Town Government.=--The functions performed by the town\r\ngovernments are varied and numerous. The most important, however, are\r\nthe support and management of public schools, the laying out and\r\nmaintenance of roads, the construction of bridges, the care of the poor,\r\nand in the more populous towns, fire protection, health protection, the\r\nmaintenance of police, lighting, paving of streets, establishment of\r\nparks, public libraries, etc. The towns also have power to enact\r\nordinances of a police character, relating to such matters as bicycle\r\nriding on sidewalks, the running of animals at large, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the management of the purely local affairs of the\r\ncommunity, the town acts as the agent of the state government for\r\ncarrying out certain state laws and policies. Thus it assesses and\r\ncollects the state taxes, keeps records of vital statistics, enforces\r\nthe health laws of the state, and acts for the state in various other\r\nmatters. Finally, except in Massachusetts, the town is a district for\r\nchoosing members of at least one branch of the legislature, and\r\neverywhere in New England it is a district for state and national\r\nelections.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Fairlie, \"Local Government,\" p. 147.\r\n\r\n=The Town Meeting.=--The central fact in the system of town government\r\nin New England is the town meeting, or assembly of the qualified voters\r\nof the town. The annual meeting is usually held in the early Spring\r\n(except in Connecticut, where it is generally held in October) and\r\nspecial meetings are called from time to time as necessity may require.\r\nAll persons qualified as voters under the state laws are entitled to\r\nattend and take part in the proceedings of the meeting. Formerly\r\nnon-attendance was punishable by a fine, but that is no longer resorted\r\nto; it being supposed that each voter's interest will be sufficient\r\ninducement to secure his presence. The attendance is larger in the towns\r\nof New England than in the states of the West where the town meeting\r\nexists, and it is larger in urban towns than in those of a rural\r\ncharacter. Formal notice must be given of the time and place of the\r\nmeeting, and this is done by a warrant issued by the selectmen, which\r\nspecifies also the matters of business to be considered. This notice\r\nmust be posted in conspicuous places a certain number of days before the\r\nmeeting. No other matters than those mentioned in the warrant can be\r\nintroduced or considered. The meetings are usually held in the town\r\nhall, though in the early history of New England they were frequently\r\nheld in the church, which was thus a \"meeting house\" for civil as well\r\nas for church purposes.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is called to order by the town clerk, who reads the warrant,\r\nafter which an organization is effected by the election of a presiding\r\nofficer called a moderator, and business then proceeds in accordance\r\nwith the customary rules of parliamentary law. The next order of\r\nbusiness is the election of the town officers for the ensuing year. This\r\ndone, appropriations are made for the payment of the public expenses of\r\nthe town, and the other measures necessary for the government of the\r\ntown are then discussed and adopted. The most interesting fact about the\r\nNew England town meeting is the lively discussion which characterizes\r\nits proceedings. Any voter may introduce resolutions and express his\r\nopinion on any proposition before the assembly. One great advantage of\r\nthis system of local government is its educative effect upon the\r\ncitizens. It affords a means of keeping alive interest in public affairs\r\nand thus tends to develop a more intelligent citizenship. Important\r\nmeasures may be carefully discussed and criticized before the final vote\r\nis taken, and it is difficult to \"railroad\" or smuggle an objectionable\r\nmeasure through, as is sometimes done in the legislatures and city\r\ncouncils. Everything the officials and committees of the town have done\r\nis subject to be criticized, everything they are to do is subject to be\r\nregulated by the meeting. The final action of the meeting, therefore, is\r\npretty apt to represent the real wishes of the people.\r\n\r\n=Conditions Unfavorable to Government by Town Meeting.=--Various causes,\r\nhowever, are at work in some parts of New England to weaken the system\r\nof government by town meeting and to render it less suited to the modern\r\nconditions under which it must be operated. The growth of manufacturing\r\nindustries in many of the towns has introduced a conflict of interests\r\nbetween factory owners and operators on the one hand, and farmers on the\r\nother. The result is occasional squabbles and controversies which are\r\nnot favorable to government by mass meeting. The influx of foreigners\r\nwho are unaccustomed to local self-government and who are therefore\r\nunfamiliar with the duties of citizens in self-governing communities has\r\nin recent years also introduced an unfavorable element. Finally, the\r\ncaucus has gained a foothold in many towns so that the election of\r\nofficers and the determination of important policies are often\r\ncontrolled by a small group of persons who get together prior to the\r\ntown meeting and prepare a \"slate\" which is put through without adequate\r\ndiscussion. It is also to be noted that with the growth of population,\r\nmany of the towns have become too populous to be governed effectively by\r\nmass meeting. Frequently the town hall is too small to accommodate all\r\nthe voters who attend, and satisfactory debate under such conditions is\r\nimpossible. Often when a town reaches this size it organizes itself into\r\na municipal corporation, and a city council takes the place of the\r\npopular assembly, but there are many places of considerable size which\r\nstill retain the town organization.\r\n\r\n=Town Officers.=--_Selectmen._--From the beginning of town government it\r\nwas necessary to choose agents to look after the affairs of the\r\ncommunity during the interval between town meetings. These persons were\r\ncalled _selectmen_, and they have retained the name until the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nEvery town now has a body of selectmen chosen at the annual meeting,\r\nusually for one year (in Massachusetts for three years) to act as a\r\ngeneral managing board for the community. The number for each town\r\nvaries from three to nine according to the size of the town, three being\r\nthe most usual number. Reëlections are frequent; one selectman in\r\nBrookline, Massachusetts, served nearly forty years. Their duties vary\r\nin the different towns. Generally they issue warrants for holding town\r\nmeetings, lay out roads, impanel jurors, grant licenses, abate\r\nnuisances, arrange for elections, control the town property, hear\r\ncomplaints, sometimes assess taxes (especially in the small towns), and\r\nmay appoint police officials, boards of health, overseers of the poor,\r\nand other local officers if they are not chosen by the voters assembled\r\nin the town meeting.\r\n\r\n_The Town Clerk._--Besides the selectmen, there are various other\r\nofficers of the town, the number varying according to its size and\r\nimportance. One of the most important of these is the _clerk_, who\r\nperforms some duties discharged by the county clerk in states outside of\r\nNew England. The town clerk is elected at the annual town meeting, and\r\nis frequently reëlected from year to year. His principal duties are to\r\nkeep the records of the town meetings, and of the meetings of the\r\nselectmen, issue marriage licenses, and keep registers of births,\r\nmarriages, and deaths.\r\n\r\n_Assessors and Treasurer._--In the large towns there are assessors of\r\ntaxes, who prepare tax lists; in the smaller ones, as stated above, the\r\nselectmen act as assessors. In all of the towns there is a town\r\ntreasurer who receives and takes care of all taxes collected from the\r\ncitizens, turning over to the proper officers the portion which goes to\r\nthe state and to the county. He also keeps an account of all receipts\r\nand disbursements and makes an annual report to the town meeting.\r\n\r\n_Overseers of the Poor._--To care for the pauper and dependent class\r\nthere are usually one or more overseers of the poor elected by the town\r\nmeeting, though in the smaller towns the selectmen perform this duty.\r\nTheir principal function is to determine who shall receive public aid.\r\n\r\n_Constables._--In every town one or more constables are elected.\r\nFormerly this office, like that of sheriff, was one of dignity and\r\ninfluence, but it has lost much of its early importance. As the sheriff\r\nis the peace officer of the county, the constables are the peace\r\nofficers of the town. They pursue and arrest criminals and execute\r\nwarrants issued by the selectmen and by the justices of the peace. In\r\naddition they sometimes summon jurors and act as collectors of the\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n_School Committee._--Generally there is also a school committee elected\r\nat the town meeting. It is charged with establishing and visiting\r\nschools, selecting teachers, prescribing the courses of instruction, and\r\nappointing truant officers.\r\n\r\n_Other Town Officials_ are justices of the peace; road surveyors or\r\nsimilar officers with other titles, charged with keeping public roads\r\nand bridges in repair; field drivers and poundkeepers, who take up and\r\nkeep stray animals until claimed by their owners; fence viewers, who\r\nsettle disputes among farmers in regard to partition fences and walls;\r\nsealers of weights and measures, who test the accuracy of scales and\r\nmeasures; surveyors of lumber; keepers of almshouses; park\r\ncommissioners; fish wardens; inspectors of various kinds; and a host of\r\nother minor officials, some of whom bear queer titles, and many of whom\r\nserve without pay or receive only trifling fees for their services. In\r\nsome of the small towns, officials are so numerous as to constitute a\r\ngoodly proportion of the population. The town of Middlefield (Mass.),\r\nfor example, with only eighty-two voters recently had a total of\r\neighteen officials.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] Hart, \"Actual Government,\" p. 172.\r\n\r\n=Town Government in the West.=--Town government is not confined to New\r\nEngland; it has been carried to many Western states where immigrants\r\nfrom New England have settled, though in none of them does it possess\r\nthe vitality or play the important part in the management of public\r\naffairs that it does in the older communities where it originated. In\r\nthe states of the South and the far West, there is no general system of\r\ntown government. Counties, however, are usually divided into districts\r\nfor a few unimportant purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n=The County.=--The county[3] is a civil division created by the state\r\npartly for purposes of state administration and partly for local\r\ngovernment. New York city embraces within its boundaries five counties;\r\nother cities, like Chicago, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Cincinnati, contain\r\nwithin their limits the larger part of the population of the counties in\r\nwhich they are situated. The population of a large majority of the\r\ncounties, however, is predominantly rural rather than urban in\r\ncharacter, and where there is a large city within a county, most of the\r\naffairs of that portion of the county lying within the city limits are\r\nmanaged by the city government.\r\n\r\n    [3] The corresponding division in Louisiana is called a parish.\r\n\r\n_Population and Area._--The population of the counties, and their areas,\r\nvary widely. Several counties in Texas in 1910 had less than 400\r\ninhabitants each, New York county, on the other hand, had more than\r\n2,750,000. The most populous counties are in the Eastern states, and\r\nthe least populous in the South and West. There are now about 3,000\r\ncounties in all the states, the number in each state ranging from three\r\nin Delaware and five in Rhode Island to 244 in Texas. In proportion to\r\npopulation Massachusetts has a smaller number (fourteen) than any other\r\nstate in the Union. In many states the minimum size of counties is fixed\r\nby the constitution. The minimum limit where it is fixed by the\r\nconstitution is usually 400 square miles, though in some states it is\r\n600 or 700 and in Texas it is 900 square miles. Where no such\r\nrestrictions have been prescribed, however, as in some of the old\r\nstates, the area is sometimes very small. In Rhode Island, for example,\r\nthere is one county with an area of only 25 square miles. New York has\r\none county (New York) with an area of 21 square miles, and another (St.\r\nLawrence) with an area of 2,880 square miles. On the other hand, Choteau\r\ncounty in Montana has an area of over 16,000 square miles, being\r\nconsiderably larger than the combined area of several of the smaller\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the legislature from creating new counties or altering the\r\nboundaries of existing counties against the wishes of the inhabitants,\r\nand to secure to the people home rule in such matters, the constitutions\r\nof a number of states provide that new counties may be formed, or the\r\narea of existing counties altered, only with the consent of the\r\ninhabitants concerned, given by a direct popular vote on the question.\r\n\r\n_Functions of the County._--The county is a judicial and elective\r\ndistrict, and the jails and courthouses and sometimes the almshouses are\r\ncounty rather than town institutions. Outside of New England the county\r\nis also often the unit of representation in the legislature; and it acts\r\nas an agent of the state in collecting taxes and executing many laws.\r\n\r\n=County Officers.=--_The County Board._--The principal county authority\r\nis usually a board of commissioners or supervisors (in Louisiana it is\r\ncalled the police jury), elected by the voters either from the county at\r\nlarge or from districts into which the county is divided. In most states\r\nit is a small board, usually three or five members; in some it is\r\nlarger, being composed of one member from each township in the county.\r\nIn a few Southern states (Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas), the county\r\ncourt of justices of the peace still acts as the county board, as in\r\nColonial days.\r\n\r\nThis board is both a legislative and an administrative body for the\r\ncounty, for the executive and legislative functions in local government\r\nare not always kept so separate and distinct as they are in the state\r\nand national governments. It levies taxes, appropriates money for\r\nmeeting the public expenses, has general control of county finances, has\r\ncharge of county buildings and other property, settles claims against\r\nthe county, approves bonds of county officials, and in many states it\r\nestablishes roads, lets contracts for the erection of bridges and other\r\npublic works and for repairing them, licenses ferries and sometimes\r\ninns, saloons, peddlers, etc., cares for the poor and dependent classes,\r\nand performs numerous other services which vary in extent and character\r\nin the different states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pueblo County Court House, Colorado]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Polk County Court House, Florida]\r\n\r\n_The Sheriff._--The most important executive officer of the county is\r\nthe sheriff. This office is a very ancient one, though it has lost much\r\nof its former dignity and importance. The sheriff is elected by the\r\npeople of the county, in all of the states except Rhode Island (where he\r\nis chosen by the state legislature), for a term ranging from one to four\r\nyears, the most usual term being two years. The sheriff is usually\r\nassisted by a number of deputies, who are either regularly employed by\r\nhim or especially summoned in case of emergencies. He is the general\r\nconservator of the peace of the county and is charged with attending the\r\ncourt as its executive officer and with carrying out its orders, whether\r\nit be to sell property for nonpayment of taxes, to seize and sell\r\nproperty in execution of a judgment, or to hang a convicted criminal. He\r\nhas the power, and it is his duty, to arrest offenders and commit them\r\nto the jail, of which he is usually the custodian, and to this end he\r\nmay summon to his aid the _posse comitatus_, which consists of the\r\nable-bodied male citizens of the county. In case of serious disturbance\r\nand riot he may call on the governor for the aid of the militia. He must\r\nexercise reasonable care for the safe-keeping of prisoners in his\r\ncustody, and in some states he may be removed from office by the\r\ngovernor for negligence in protecting them against mob violence. In some\r\nof the Southern states he is _ex officio_ tax collector and in some he\r\nis also _ex officio_ public administrator. Other duties of a special\r\nnature are imposed upon sheriffs in different states.\r\n\r\n_The Coroner._--Next to the sheriff among county officers in point of\r\norigin is the coroner, whose principal duty is to hold inquests upon the\r\nbodies of persons who are supposed to have died from violence or other\r\nunlawful means. In such cases it is the duty of the coroner to impanel a\r\njury, usually of six persons, who from the testimony of witnesses, if\r\nthere are such, and with the aid of a physician or other expert, decide\r\nthe facts as to how the deceased met his death. A coroner's inquest,\r\nhowever, is not a trial but merely an inquiry into the circumstances of\r\nthe death. By an old common-law rule, the coroner usually succeeds to\r\nthe office of sheriff in case the latter dies or for any other reason is\r\ndisqualified from acting.\r\n\r\n_County Clerk._--Usually in every county there is an official called the\r\ncounty clerk, who in most states serves both as the clerk of the county\r\nboard of commissioners, and as clerk of the county court and of the\r\ncircuit court. In the former capacity he keeps a record of the\r\nproceedings of the meeting of the board. His books must contain a record\r\nof all bids for the erection of county buildings, of all contracts let,\r\nnotices of elections ordered, licenses granted, roads laid out or\r\nchanged, and indeed of all transactions of the board. As clerk of the\r\ncourt he must prepare and keep the docket of all cases for trial and of\r\nthe judgments entered, issue processes and writs, certify to the\r\naccuracy of transcripts from the records of the court, and keep all\r\npapers and records of the court. In Pennsylvania and Delaware the clerk\r\nof the common pleas court is known as a \"prothonotary\"; in Massachusetts\r\nthe clerks of the probate courts are styled \"registers of probate.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few states these two sets of duties are intrusted to different\r\nofficials, one of whom is styled the county clerk and the other the\r\nclerk of the court. Usually the county clerk is also an election\r\nofficer, being charged with the giving of notices of elections, the\r\npreparation of ballots, and the keeping of election records. County\r\nclerks are usually elected by the people of the county for a period\r\nranging from one to four years, and reëlection is much more frequent\r\nthan is the case with other county officials, because of the greater\r\nneed of experience and familiarity with the duties of the office.[4]\r\n\r\n    [4] In Vermont and Connecticut, however, they are appointed by the\r\n    judges and hold during their pleasure, while in Rhode Island they are\r\n    elected by the legislature annually.\r\n\r\n_County Treasurer._--An important county officer is the treasurer, who\r\nreceives and has custody of the state and county taxes, though in a few\r\nstates having the county system of local government there are special\r\ntax collectors, and, as we have seen, in some of them these duties are\r\nperformed by the sheriff.[5] Nearly everywhere the office is filled by\r\npopular election, though in a few states treasurers are chosen by the\r\ncounty board or appointed by the governor. On account of the large sums\r\nof money often intrusted to their keeping, they are usually placed under\r\nheavy bond to insure the state and county against loss in case of\r\ndefalcation or other misapplication of the funds in their charge. County\r\ntreasurers frequently deposit the public funds in local banks and retain\r\nfor themselves the interest which they receive therefrom. Recently the\r\ntreasurer of Cook county, Illinois, agreed before his election to turn\r\nover to the county all interest received by him on county funds\r\ndeposited in banks, and in 1904 nearly half a million dollars was thus\r\npaid into the county treasury by him.\r\n\r\n    [5] Rhode Island is the only state in which there is no such official\r\n    as the county treasurer, the custody of local funds being intrusted\r\n    to the town treasurers.\r\n\r\n_County Auditor._--In a number of states the office of county auditor\r\nhas been provided. Generally he keeps the accounts of the county, so as\r\nto show the receipts and expenditures of the public moneys, and issues\r\nwarrants upon the treasurer for the payment of bills authorized by the\r\ncounty board. In some states his duties are limited merely to an\r\nexamination of the accounts of county officers to see that they have\r\nbeen properly kept and that there has been no misapplication of public\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n_Recorder of Deeds._--In all the states there are officials charged with\r\nkeeping records of certain legal documents such as deeds, mortgages, and\r\nleases. They are designated by different names, the most usual being\r\nregister of deeds or recorder of deeds. They make exact copies of the\r\ninstruments to be recorded, enter them in large books, and keep indexes\r\nby which such instruments can be readily found. In some states these\r\nduties are performed by the county clerk. The importance of the office\r\nis evident because upon the careful preservation and accuracy of the\r\nrecords must depend in many cases our rights to property.\r\n\r\n_School Officers._--In the states outside New England there is usually a\r\ncounty superintendent or commissioner of schools and in most of the\r\nSouthern states a county school board. In a large majority of the states\r\nthe county superintendent is elected by the people, though in a few he\r\nis appointed by the governor, elected by the local school boards, or\r\nchosen in other ways. The principal duties of the superintendent of\r\nschools are to examine teachers, issue certificates to teach, visit the\r\nschools, organize teachers' institutes, give advice on educational\r\nmatters to teachers and school trustees, make reports to the state\r\nsuperintendent of public education, sometimes decide questions appealed\r\nto him from the district trustees, and in general watch over and promote\r\nthe educational interests of the county. County school boards in the\r\nSouth establish schools as do the town school committees and school\r\ndistrict boards in other states.\r\n\r\n_Other County Officials_ are the surveyor, who makes surveys of land\r\nupon the application of private owners, prepares plats, and keeps\r\nrecords of the same; superintendent or overseers of the poor, who have\r\ncharge of almshouses, hospitals, and poor farms where they belong to the\r\ncounty; health officers or boards of health, whose duties are indicated\r\nby their titles; and occasionally other minor officials with varying\r\ntitles and duties.[6]\r\n\r\n    [6] The county court and the justices of the peace are discussed in\r\n    the chapter on the state judiciary (chapter vi).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY-TOWNSHIP SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIn most states the general type of local government is that which we\r\nhave designated as the county-township system. It is a system in which\r\nthere is a more nearly equal division of local governmental functions\r\nbetween the county and township than is found either in New England or\r\nin the Southern states.\r\n\r\n=The Two Types.=--Growing out of the fact that the county-township\r\nsystem has two sources it has developed into two different types: the\r\nNew York or supervisor type and the Pennsylvania or commissioner type.\r\n\r\n_A. New York Type._--In New York the town with its annual meeting early\r\nmade its appearance, though the town meeting there never exhibited the\r\nvigor and vitality that it did in New England. Early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury a law was enacted in New York providing that each township in\r\nthe county should elect an officer called a _supervisor_, and that the\r\nsupervisors of the several towns should form a county board and when\r\nassembled at the county seat should \"supervise and examine the public\r\nand necessary charge of each county.\" In time the management of most of\r\nthe affairs of the county was devolved upon the board of supervisors,\r\nand the system has continued to the present. This board is now composed\r\nof not only the supervisors of the townships but also the\r\nrepresentatives of the various villages and wards of the cities within\r\nthe county. The county board thus represents the minor civil divisions\r\nof the county rather than the county as a whole. It has charge of\r\nvarious matters that in New England are managed by the towns. The town\r\nmeeting exists but it is not largely attended, and does not play the\r\nimportant rôle in local government that it does in New England. This\r\nsystem in time spread to those states, like Michigan, Illinois, and\r\nWisconsin, which were largely settled by immigrants from New York.\r\n\r\n_B. The Pennsylvania Type._--As New York was the parent of the\r\nsupervisor system, Pennsylvania became the parent of the commissioner\r\nsystem. Instead of a county board composed of representatives from the\r\nvarious townships in the county, provision was made for a board of\r\ncommissioners elected from the county at large. The Pennsylvania system\r\nspread to Ohio and from there to Indiana and later to Iowa, Kansas,\r\nMissouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In some states the\r\ncommissioners are elected by large districts into which the county is\r\ndivided for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThus, first to New York, and second to Pennsylvania belongs the honor of\r\npredetermining the character of local government in the West. The\r\ncounty-township system is the most widely distributed system of local\r\ngovernment in the United States, and seems destined to become the\r\nprevailing system for the country as a whole.[7] The principal\r\ndifference between the two types consists in the presence of the town\r\nmeeting in the northern tier of states where the New York type prevails,\r\nand its absence in the states where the Pennsylvania type was\r\nintroduced; in the different manner in which the county boards are\r\nconstituted; and in the relative importance of the county and township\r\nin the local governments of the two groups of states.\r\n\r\n    [7] Goodnow, \"Comparative Administrative Law,\" Vol. I, p. 178.\r\n\r\n=Conflict of Different Systems in the West.=--An illustration of the\r\nattachment of the people of different parts of the country to the local\r\ninstitutions to which they were early accustomed, is found in the\r\nconflict which took place in Illinois between the settlers in the\r\nnorthern and southern parts of the state. The southern part of the\r\nstate was settled largely by people from the South, who brought with\r\nthem the Southern ideas of local government, and as they constituted the\r\nbulk of the population of the state at the time it was admitted to the\r\nUnion, the system of county government was established by law throughout\r\nthe state; but the county board was organized on the Pennsylvania plan\r\nand not according to the old Southern system. The northern part of the\r\nstate, on the other hand, was settled mainly by people from New England,\r\nwho were likewise strongly attached to the local government to which\r\nthey had been accustomed. They succeeded, therefore, in securing the\r\nadoption of a clause in the constitution (1848), allowing the people of\r\neach county to adopt the township system whenever the majority of the\r\nlegal voters of the county voting at any general election should so\r\ndetermine. Under the operation of this \"home rule\" provision, 85 of the\r\n102 counties of the state have adopted the township system. A somewhat\r\nsimilar conflict occurred in Michigan, where the Pennsylvania\r\ncommissioner system was first introduced, but with the influx of\r\ninhabitants from New York and New England dissatisfaction with that\r\nsystem increased until finally it was displaced by the New York or\r\nsupervisor type.\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. xxix.\r\n     BRYCE, The American Commonwealth (abridged edition), chs.\r\n     xlvii-xlviii.

In a\r\nsparsely settled community the governmental needs of the people are\r\ncomparatively few, and a simple governmental organization is sufficient\r\nfor supplying those needs. In a densely populated community, however, a\r\nmore complex and differently organized form of government must be\r\nprovided. When, therefore, a community becomes so populous that it\r\ncannot be governed effectively by town meetings, small boards, and the\r\nother forms of political machinery described in the previous chapter, it\r\nis incorporated as a municipality, that is, the state gives it a charter\r\nwhich confers upon it special powers and privileges and provides it with\r\na somewhat different type of local government for the exercise of those\r\npowers. The minimum population necessary to constitute a city varies in\r\nthe different states. They all require, however, that there must be a\r\nconsiderable number of inhabitants occupying a comparatively small area\r\nof territory, before the community can be incorporated as a city. In\r\nIllinois, for example, any community having at least 1,000 inhabitants\r\nresident within an area not exceeding four square miles may become a\r\ncity. In some other states, a population of not less than 5,000 is\r\nrequired, while in some a still larger number is required. The census\r\nbureau of the United States, for statistical purposes, has at different\r\ntimes taken 8,000 and 2,500 as the minimum population required to\r\nconstitute a city.\r\n\r\n=Growth of Cities.=--One of the most remarkable political and social\r\nfacts of the past century was the growth of towns and cities. When the\r\nConstitution of the United States went into operation there were but\r\nthirteen cities in the whole country with populations exceeding 5,000\r\neach. Only about four per cent of the people then lived under urban\r\nconditions: rural life was the rule, and city life the exception. Since\r\nthe middle of the last century, however, there has been a remarkable\r\nchange in the relative proportion of the total population living in the\r\ncities and in the country. According to the federal census of 1910 there\r\nwere 1,232 cities in the United States with a population of more than\r\n5,000 each, and in them lived 42 per cent of all the people. The number\r\nis now considerably larger. It is estimated that 90 per cent of the\r\npeople of Massachusetts now live in cities of over 5,000 inhabitants,\r\nand in a few other states the urban population constitutes more than two\r\nthirds of the whole. More than half the population of New York state is\r\nnow found in the city of New York alone. Even in several states of the\r\nWest, as Illinois, more than half the population is now living under\r\nurban conditions. What is even more remarkable has been the rapidity\r\nwith which many American cities have grown to their present size. Thus\r\nNew York in a period of 100 years grew from a city of 50,000 inhabitants\r\nto a city of more than 4,000,000. The growth of Chicago was even more\r\nrapid. In 1907 there was still living in that city the first white\r\nperson born within its present limits. This person saw Chicago grow from\r\na petty prairie village to a city of more than 2,000,000 souls.\r\n\r\n=Causes of City Growth.=--The causes that have led to the extraordinary\r\ngrowth of cities are partly economic and partly social. With the more\r\ngeneral use of labor-saving machinery in agriculture the number of men\r\nnecessary to cultivate the farms and supply the world with food has\r\ndecreased relatively, leaving a larger number to engage in the\r\nmanufacturing and other industries which are generally centered in the\r\ncities. One man with a machine can now do the work on the farm which\r\nformerly required several, so that fewer farmers in proportion to the\r\ntotal population are needed. On the other hand, the development of trade\r\nand commerce and the rise of the manufacturing industries have created\r\nan increasing demand for city workers. Many persons are also drawn away\r\nfrom the country by the social attractions and intellectual advantages\r\nwhich the cities offer. In the cities, good schools are abundant and\r\nconvenient. There also are colleges, libraries, picture galleries,\r\nmuseums, theaters, and other institutions for amusement and education.\r\nThere the daily newspaper may be left at one's door often for a cent a\r\ncopy; there are to be found fine churches with pulpits occupied by able\r\npreachers; there one finds all the conveniences of life which modern\r\nscience and skill can provide--everything to gratify the social\r\ninstinct, and little or none of the dullness of country life. These are\r\nsome of the attractions that lure the young and the old as well from the\r\nrural communities to swell the population of the cities. These are the\r\nforces that are converting us from a nation of country dwellers to a\r\nnation of city dwellers.\r\n\r\n=Consequences of City Growth.=--The congestion of the population in the\r\ntowns and cities has had far-reaching economic, social, and political\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n_Economic Results._--As the city population becomes more dense the\r\nnumber of those who are able to own their own homes becomes less, and\r\nthus the city tends more and more to become a community of tenants.\r\nAccording to the census of 1900, while more than 64 per cent of the\r\nfamilies of the United States living on farms owned their own homes,\r\nless than 35 per cent of those living in cities were owners of the\r\nhouses they occupied. In New York city the proportion was only about 12\r\nper cent, and in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx it was less\r\nthan 6 per cent. Of these hardly more than 2 per cent owned homes that\r\nwere clear of mortgages.\r\n\r\n_Social Results._--Another result of the movement of the people to the\r\ncities is the evil of overcrowding. Manifestly where the area of a city\r\nis limited, as is often the case, there must come a time when the\r\npopulation will be massed and crowded together under circumstances that\r\nare dangerous to the health, morals, and comfort of the people. In some\r\nof the large cities to-day the conditions resulting from overcrowding\r\nare truly shocking. According to the census of 1900, while the average\r\nnumber of persons to a dwelling throughout the country as a whole was\r\nabout five, the number in New York city was nearly fifteen, and in the\r\nboroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx it was more than twenty. In several\r\nparts of the city there are blocks containing more than 1,000 persons to\r\nthe acre. Under such circumstances the rate of mortality is necessarily\r\nhigh, and immorality and vice are encouraged. In the great cities one\r\nfinds a large floating population with no local attachment or civic\r\npride, and thousands of persons, foreigners and natives alike, with low\r\nstandards of life. There also the individual is lost in a multitude,\r\nand the restraining influence of public opinion, which is so powerful in\r\nthe country, is lacking. Thus the tendency to wrongdoing is greatly\r\naccentuated.\r\n\r\n_Political Results._--Finally, the growth of the cities has had\r\nimportant political consequences, in that it has given rise to\r\nconditions that have increased enormously the problems of local\r\ngovernment. As long as the population of the nation was predominantly\r\nrural and the cities few in number and small in size, the difficulties\r\nof local government were not serious. But the presence of such\r\nconditions as those described above, together with the task which\r\ndevolves upon the city of performing so many services for the people\r\nthat are not required in sparsely settled communities, has made the\r\nproblem of city government the most difficult of all governmental\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n=Movement to Check Immigration to the Cities.=--The abandonment of the\r\nfarms and the movement of the people to the cities is viewed by many\r\npersons with regret, not to say alarm. There are some who think that the\r\ncities are the plague spots of the country, that city life tends to\r\nproduce an enfeebled race with low moral standards; that they are\r\ntending to make of us a nation of tenants, tramps, anarchists, and\r\ncriminals; and that the economic welfare of the country is being\r\nendangered by the drift away from the farm. Such a view, of course,\r\nrepresents an exaggerated conception of the dangers, though it will be\r\nreadily admitted that the change is not without serious evils.\r\n\r\nLately we have heard a great deal of discussion among thoughtful men as\r\nto the possibility of checking the movement of the young to the cities.\r\nAnd notwithstanding the movement from the country to the city it is\r\nevident that the conditions of rural life are much more favorable than\r\nformerly. The daily free delivery of mail at the doors of the farmers,\r\nthe introduction of the telephone and the interurban railway, to say\r\nnothing of the use of labor-saving machinery, have done much to add to\r\nthe attractiveness of country life and to diminish the hardships of farm\r\nlife and other rural occupations. But these advantages have not checked\r\nthe movement to the cities, and other remedies must be found.\r\n\r\n=The Position of the City in the State.=--The city occupies a twofold\r\nposition in the state of which it is a part. In the first place, it is\r\nan agent of the state for carrying out certain state laws and policies.\r\nThus it acts for the state when it protects the public health, cares for\r\nthe poor, maintains peace and order, supports education, and collects\r\nthe taxes for the state. In the second place, the city undertakes to\r\nperform numerous services which are of interest to the people of the\r\nlocality alone and which do not concern the people of the state as a\r\nwhole. When acting in this latter capacity, the city is merely an organ\r\nof local government and not an agent of the state. Thus the city\r\nsometimes supplies the inhabitants with light and water, protects them\r\nagainst fire, maintains sewers, disposes of garbage and other refuse,\r\nbuilds wharves, docks, and bridges, and maintains public libraries,\r\nmuseums, bath houses, and other institutions.\r\n\r\n_State Control of Cities._--The organization, powers, and privileges of\r\nthe city are determined for the most part by the state constitution and\r\nlaws. In a few states the financial transactions of city officials are\r\nsubject to state inspection and audit, and in practically all of them\r\ntheir power to levy taxes and borrow money is placed under restrictions.\r\nIt is felt that if the cities were left entirely free from state control\r\nthey could not always be relied upon by the state to carry out the laws\r\nwhich they are charged with enforcing, and that in other respects their\r\naction might not be in harmony with the general policy of the state. In\r\nthose matters, however, which are of purely local interest, the state\r\nshould interfere as little as possible. Interference in such cases is\r\ncontrary to the ideas of local self-government which Americans cherish\r\nas one of their most valuable rights. However, the right of the people\r\nliving in cities to regulate their own local affairs according to their\r\nown notions is not always recognized, and there are frequent complaints\r\nthat state legislatures have interfered when the interests of the state\r\ndid not justify it.\r\n\r\n=The City Charter.=--The city, unlike the county, township, and other\r\nminor civil divisions described in the preceding chapter, has a charter\r\ngranted to it by the state which gives the city more of the character of\r\na public corporation. The charter contains the name of the place\r\nincorporated, a description of its boundaries, its form of organization,\r\nand a detailed enumeration of the powers which it may exercise. It is\r\ngranted by the state legislature, though, unlike the charter granted to\r\na private corporation, such as a bank or a railway company, it is not a\r\ncontract but simply a legislative act which may be repealed or altered\r\nat the will of the legislature. Thus, legally, the city is at the mercy\r\nof the legislature. Its charter, indeed, may be taken away from it and\r\nthe city governed directly by the legislature in such manner as it may\r\nchoose, and this has sometimes been done in the case of cities which\r\ngrossly abused their powers or got themselves into such hopeless\r\nfinancial condition that they were unable to meet their obligations or\r\nproperly discharge their duties.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Granting Charters._--Formerly it was the custom in most\r\nstates for the legislature to frame a charter for each city as\r\napplication was made. The result was that different cities received\r\ndifferent kinds of charters, some more liberal than others. Besides, the\r\ntime of the legislature was taken up with the consideration of\r\napplications for charters, and abundant opportunities were offered for\r\nfavoritism and for the use of improper influences upon members of the\r\nlegislature by cities that desired new charters or amendments to\r\nexisting charters. To avoid these evils many states adopted the practice\r\nof passing a general law for the government of all cities in the state,\r\nunder which any community which desired to be incorporated as a city\r\nmight by fulfilling certain prescribed conditions be organized under\r\nthis general act, which then became the charter of the city. Under this\r\nsystem all cities in the state would have practically the same\r\norganization and powers.\r\n\r\n_\"Home Rule\" Charters._--The feeling that the people concerned should be\r\ngiven some power in framing the charters under which they are to be\r\ngoverned has led in comparatively recent times to the adoption of \"home\r\nrule\" provisions in the constitutions of a number of states--that is,\r\nprovisions allowing the people of each city, under certain restrictions,\r\nto frame their own charters. Thus the Missouri constitution, adopted in\r\n1875, allows each city of more than 100,000 inhabitants to prepare its\r\nown charter, which, when approved by the voters, shall go into effect\r\nprovided it is not inconsistent with the state law. Other states having\r\n\"home rule\" charter provisions in their constitutions are California,\r\nOregon, Washington, Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma, Michigan, Wisconsin,\r\nTexas, Ohio, Nebraska, Arizona, and Connecticut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CITY HALL AND MUNICIPAL BUILDING, NEW YORK\r\n\r\nThe City Hall is in the foreground; the Municipal Building, containing\r\nadditional office room for city officials, is the tallest building\r\nshown.]\r\n\r\n_Powers of Municipal Corporations._--With the exception of a few cities,\r\nof which Houston, Texas, is an example, the powers that may be\r\nexercised by a city are specifically enumerated with great detail in the\r\ncharter, and where that is done no other powers may be exercised by the\r\ncity except such as are clearly incidental to, or implied in, those\r\nenumerated. Thus when the city of New York wished to build an elevated\r\nrailway, it had to secure express authority from the legislature, which\r\nbody insisted that the work should be carried out under the supervision\r\nof a state commission. Likewise when the city of Chicago wanted power to\r\nprescribe the width of wagon tires to be used on its streets, recourse\r\nhad to be made to the state legislature for permission, though in\r\nneither case was the matter involved one which concerned directly\r\nanybody except the people of the cities affected.\r\n\r\n=Legislative Interference in the Affairs of Cities.=--The power of the\r\nstate legislature over the cities has sometimes been employed to\r\ninterfere in their local affairs and to force upon the cities measures\r\nor policies to which they were opposed. Thus the legislature of\r\nPennsylvania passed an act requiring the city of Philadelphia to build\r\nan expensive city hall which cost the taxpayers of the city something\r\nlike $20,000,000, though it was not a matter of direct interest to the\r\npeople outside of the city. Likewise the legislature of Ohio required\r\nthe city of Cleveland to erect a soldiers' monument at a cost of\r\n$300,000 against the wishes of the taxpayers who had to bear the\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nSometimes the legislature employs its power of control over the cities\r\nin the interest of the political party which happens to be in control of\r\nthe legislature, and it frequently passes laws relating to the hours of\r\nopening and closing of saloons in the cities when local sentiment may be\r\nopposed to such laws. But as to the moral right of the legislature to\r\nenact such laws as the last mentioned, there is a difference of\r\nopinion. The disposition of the legislature to interfere in the affairs\r\nof the cities by means of special acts--that is, acts applying to a\r\nsingle city--has come to be a crying evil and has been a cause of\r\ncomplaint from the people of nearly every large city. The New York\r\nlegislature during a period of ten years passed nearly four hundred laws\r\napplying to the city of New York.\r\n\r\n=Constitutional Protection Against Special Legislation.=--To protect the\r\ncities against special legislation and at the same time to remove the\r\nopportunity which such a practice offers for bribery and the employment\r\nof other improper means to secure special legislation or to prevent it,\r\nwhen it is not desired, the constitutions of many states contain\r\nprovisions absolutely prohibiting the legislature from enacting laws\r\napplying to particular cities except where general laws are\r\ninapplicable. Where such constitutional provisions have been adopted,\r\nthe legislatures have frequently evaded them by a system of\r\nclassification by which acts are passed applying to all cities within a\r\nclass when in reality there may be but a single city in such a class.\r\nAnd the courts have generally held such acts to be constitutional where\r\nthe classifications are not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe New York constitution recognizes that special legislation applying\r\nto larger cities may sometimes be desirable, and instead of forbidding\r\nsuch legislation absolutely it classifies the cities of the state into\r\nthree classes according to population,--New York City, Buffalo, and\r\nRochester constituting the first class,--and allows the legislature to\r\nenact laws affecting a single city within a class, subject to the\r\ncondition that the proposed law must be submitted to the authorities of\r\nthe city affected, for their approval, and if disapproved it is void\r\nunless repassed by the legislature. Likewise by recent amendment to the\r\nconstitution of Illinois the legislature of the state is allowed to\r\npass special laws affecting the city of Chicago alone, but such\r\nlegislation cannot take effect until it has been approved by the voters\r\nof the city at a general or special election.\r\n\r\n=Functions of Municipal Government.=--The functions and activities of\r\ncity government are numerous and varied, much more so, of course, in\r\nlarge cities than in small ones. First of all, the problem of police\r\nprotection, the punishment of crime, and the care of the public safety\r\nin a community where thousands of persons of all nationalities and with\r\nvarying standards of respect for law are living in close proximity, is\r\nvery difficult and requires a small army of officials which would be\r\nentirely unnecessary in a rural community. Likewise the duty of caring\r\nfor the public health, of preventing the spread of disease, of securing\r\na wholesome water supply, of protecting the people against impure and\r\nadulterated food, and of securing wholesome and sanitary conditions\r\ngenerally, is very much greater in cities than in sparsely settled rural\r\ndistricts or in villages and small towns. Then there are the problems of\r\nfire protection, gas and electric light, street railway transportation,\r\nthe construction and maintenance of streets, education, building\r\nregulations, the care of the poor and dependent class, disposal of\r\nsewage and waste, the maintenance of hospitals, libraries, museums, and\r\nother institutions, the regulation of traffic on the streets, and many\r\nother activities too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\n=The City Council.=--The legislative branch of most city governments is\r\na council composed of members elected by the voters for a term ranging\r\nfrom one year in some of the cities of New England to four years in\r\ncertain other parts of the country, the most usual term being two years.\r\nThe number of members ranges from 9 in Boston to more than 130 in\r\nPhiladelphia. The city of New York has a council of 67 members; Chicago,\r\n70; and San Francisco, 18. In the large majority of cities this council,\r\nunlike the state legislatures, is a single-chambered body, though in a\r\nfew important cities, notably Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Louis, and\r\nLouisville, it is composed of two houses.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Election._--Generally, the members of the city council are\r\nchosen by districts or wards, usually one member from each, though in\r\nsome cities several are elected from each district; in Illinois cities\r\ntwo members are elected from each ward into which the city is divided.\r\nWhere the council is composed of two houses, the members of the upper\r\nhouse are sometimes chosen from the city at large on a general ticket,\r\nand the members of the lower house by wards. In San Francisco, where the\r\ncouncil is composed of but one house, the eighteen members are elected\r\nfrom the city at large. The same is true of Boston, whose council under\r\nthe new charter is composed of but nine members.\r\n\r\nThe method of election by wards is open to the objection that it tends\r\nto the election of inferior men and of men who are likely to consider\r\nthemselves the special representatives of their wards rather than the\r\nrepresentatives of the people of the city at large. On the other hand,\r\nelection from the city at large, or election of several members from\r\nlarge districts on a general ticket, unless coupled with a system of\r\nminority representation, is likely to give the majority party an undue\r\nadvantage. Perhaps the best plan would be to elect a certain number from\r\nthe city at large and the rest by wards.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in some cities, of which Chicago is a conspicuous example, the\r\nward system has led to inequality of representation. Thus it has\r\nsometimes happened that certain wards which are largely inhabited by the\r\nworst elements of the population are over-represented as compared with\r\nwards in other parts of the city inhabited largely by the better class\r\nof citizens. Finally, where the ward system prevails, the ward becomes\r\nthe seat of a local political organization whose methods are so often\r\ncorrupt and dishonorable that they constitute a great hindrance to good\r\ncity government.\r\n\r\n=Powers of City Councils.=--Unlike the state legislature, which is an\r\nauthority of general powers, the city council in America has only such\r\npowers as are conferred upon it by the charter of the city. These powers\r\nare numerous and varied and relate to such matters as the laying out and\r\ncare of streets, the protection of the public health, the regulation of\r\nthe sale of liquor, the control of places of public amusement, markets,\r\nbathing places, traffic on the streets, the suppression of vice and\r\nimmorality, protection against fire, the disposal of waste, the lighting\r\nof the streets, and in general the preservation of the good order and\r\npeace of the community. Its powers are exercised usually through acts\r\ncalled ordinances, which are framed and enacted after the manner\r\nfollowed by the legislature in enacting laws for the government of the\r\nstate. The power of the council is frequently limited by the state\r\nconstitution or laws. Thus very frequently it is forbidden to incur\r\ndebts beyond a certain limit, or to levy taxes above a certain amount,\r\nand frequently the purposes for which taxes may be levied and money\r\nappropriated are carefully specified.\r\n\r\n=Franchises.=--One of the most important powers of a city council is the\r\ngranting of franchises to street railway, gas, electric light, water,\r\nand other public service companies to maintain tracks, wires, pipe\r\nlines, etc., in the streets and other public places. As these franchises\r\nare often of great value to the companies receiving them, a temptation\r\nis thus created for the employment of bribery and other improper means\r\nfor securing concessions of this character. In some cities aldermen have\r\nbeen paid large sums of money for their votes on franchise grants, and\r\nindeed the practice has been so often resorted to that there is a\r\npopular belief that most public utility franchises in the larger cities\r\nare secured in this way. Formerly franchises were frequently granted for\r\nlong periods of years or for an indefinite period, and often without\r\nadequate compensation to the city. This abuse became so common that the\r\npeople gradually came to adopt constitutional provisions or state laws\r\nlimiting the periods for which public service franchises could be\r\ngranted, and indeed a few, notably those which have adopted the\r\ncommission form of government, have gone to the length of making all\r\nsuch grants subject to the approval of the voters of the city at an\r\nelection held for the purpose.\r\n\r\n=The Mayor.=--The chief executive officer of the city is the mayor. With\r\na few unimportant exceptions he is elected by the qualified voters of\r\nthe city and serves for a term varying from one to four years, the most\r\nusual term being two years. In Boston, Chicago, and New York city,\r\nhowever, the term is four years.\r\n\r\n=Powers and Duties.=--It is the duty of the mayor to enforce the\r\nordinances of the city and also such laws of the state as he may be\r\ncharged with executing. Like the sheriff of the county, he is a peace\r\nofficer and as such is charged with the maintenance of order and the\r\nsuppression of riots, and if a disturbance becomes so great that it\r\ncannot be suppressed by the police he may, like the sheriff, call on the\r\ngovernor for the militia. In some cities he is the presiding officer of\r\nthe city council, though not a member of it. Generally he is required\r\nto submit messages to the council concerning the condition of the city,\r\nand may recommend measures for its consideration. Practically everywhere\r\nhe has the power to veto ordinances passed by the city council, and some\r\nmayors have made extensive use of this power. The council, however, may\r\npass an ordinance over the mayor's veto.\r\n\r\nOne of the important powers of the mayor is the appointment of\r\nofficials, though usually the assent of the council is necessary to the\r\nvalidity of most appointments. In recent years there has been a\r\nconsiderable extension of this power in a number of the large cities,\r\nwhere the mayor has been given the absolute power of appointing the\r\nheads of the administrative departments. Indeed, the tendency now seems\r\nto be in the direction of concentrating larger powers of appointment in\r\nhis hands as a means of fixing responsibility more definitely. There is\r\nalso a tendency in the direction of giving him a large power of removal,\r\nsubject to the provision that the official shall be removed only for\r\ngood cause and that he shall be given a hearing and an opportunity to\r\nanswer the charges made against him.\r\n\r\nFinally, the mayor usually has the power to grant pardons for violations\r\nof the ordinances of the city, and this power is sometimes extensively\r\nused. Thus during the year 1909 the mayor of Chicago released more than\r\n1,100 offenders who had been committed to prison, or about 10 per cent\r\nof the whole number committed. In some cities also he may remit fines\r\nthat have been paid for violations of city ordinances.\r\n\r\n=Administrative Departments.=--_Single Commissioner System vs. the Board\r\nSystem._--In every large city there are, in addition to the mayor, a\r\nnumber of departments each charged with the conduct of some particular\r\nbranch of the city's affairs. They are organized on one of two\r\nprinciples: each is under the control either of a board or of a single\r\ncommissioner. Each method of organization has its advantages and\r\ndisadvantages, but experience has shown that the single-headed\r\ndepartment is the one best calculated to secure efficiency and\r\nresponsibility, and it is the one most generally employed. The board\r\nsystem is well adapted to secure deliberation, but not promptness and\r\nunity of action nor responsibility, because one member may easily shift\r\nthe responsibility for an error or blunder upon his colleagues. But for\r\ncertain branches of administration such as the civil service, park\r\nadministration, school administration, assessments, and possibly others,\r\nthe board system has important advantages.\r\n\r\n_Number of Departments._--The number of these administrative departments\r\nvaries widely among the different cities of the country. In general we\r\nfind the following departments: a finance department, a law department,\r\na health department, a fire department, a police department, a\r\ndepartment of charities, and a department of public works. In some\r\ncities, however, the number of departments is much larger than this.\r\nThus in some we find a street cleaning department, a department of\r\nbuildings, a sewer department, a department of parks, a department of\r\ndocks, and so on.\r\n\r\n_Choice of Heads of Departments._--The heads of these departments are in\r\nmost cases appointed by the mayor, to whom they are responsible, though\r\nnearly everywhere the approval of the council is necessary to his\r\nappointments. In recent years there has been more or less criticism of\r\nthe practice of choosing administrative officials by popular election.\r\nIn every large city there is a great mass of unintelligent voters who\r\nare easily controlled by corrupt and scheming politicians. Moreover, it\r\nis impossible for the voters in a large city, however intelligent they\r\nmay be, to become acquainted with the merits of all the numerous\r\ncandidates when there are a considerable number of offices to be filled.\r\nIt is believed by many municipal reformers, therefore, that better\r\nresults could be obtained by allowing the mayor to choose all the heads\r\nof important departments, except possibly the chief finance officer, who\r\nmight properly be chosen by the people. For the selection of the large\r\nnumber of subordinate officials, the best method yet devised is that\r\nknown as the civil service system, which has been introduced in most of\r\nthe larger cities. Under this system appointments are made on the basis\r\nof merit and fitness, which qualities are ascertained by an examination\r\nby a board of civil service commissioners.\r\n\r\n=City Finances.=--One of the most remarkable features of American\r\nmunicipal development has been the extraordinary growth of municipal\r\nexpenditures. The functions and activities of modern city government are\r\nindeed so numerous and varied as to require a larger number of officials\r\nand a greater expenditure of money than is required for the conduct of\r\nany other of the various governments under which we live. By far the\r\nlarger part of the taxes contributed by those who live in the cities go\r\nto meet the expenses of municipal government. In 1920 the budget of New\r\nYork city was over $270,000,000, while that of Chicago was about\r\n$130,000,000, in each case the amount being about five times as great as\r\nthe appropriations for the support of the government of the state in\r\nwhich the city is situated. The annual cost of operating our largest\r\ncity exceeds what was required to maintain the national government in\r\nits early days, and is greater than the national budget of a number of\r\nEuropean countries to-day. New York city in 1910 had a debt almost as\r\nlarge as the national debt, her annual interest account alone being in\r\nthe neighborhood of $30,000,000. The proper raising and expenditure of\r\nsuch vast sums of money is one of the most difficult tasks of a city\r\ngovernment. For this purpose there are assessors, collectors,\r\ntreasurers, comptrollers or auditors, and various other officials. The\r\nlevying of the taxes is everywhere a power of the city council, though\r\nin many states the amount of taxes which may be levied by it is\r\nlimited--usually to a certain percentage of the value of the taxable\r\nproperty within the city, and in some states the limit is fixed so low\r\nthat the cities are handicapped in raising sufficient revenue to meet\r\ntheir expenses. The purpose of such restrictions is to prevent\r\nextravagance and wastefulness, and the history of many of our cities\r\nproves that they have, in general, served a good purpose.\r\n\r\n_Sources of Municipal Taxation._--The principal source of income for\r\ncity, as for state and county, purposes is the general property tax,\r\nthough cities are usually allowed to levy a great variety of other\r\ntaxes, such as taxes on certain trades and businesses. Street peddlers\r\nare in many cases required to pay license fees. Before the liquor\r\ntraffic was prohibited, many cities derived a large portion of their\r\nincome from license taxes on saloons. Some cities receive a considerable\r\nincome from franchises granted to public corporations. Thus Chicago\r\nreceives a large percentage of the earnings of some of the street\r\nrailways, the amount aggregating more than $1,500,000 a year. In many\r\ncities the expense of public improvements, particularly street paving\r\nand the laying of sidewalks, is met by what are called \"special\r\nassessments,\" that is, assessments laid upon the owners of the property\r\nbenefited, in proportion to the benefits received from the improvement.\r\n\r\n_Municipal Expenditures._--Appropriations are in most cities made by the\r\ncity council subject to certain rules and restrictions prescribed by\r\nstate law. In New York city, however, the budget is prepared by a board\r\nof estimate and apportionment composed of a few high city officers, and\r\nin a few other cities the preparation of the budget is intrusted to\r\nother authorities than the city council. To secure accuracy and honesty\r\nin the expenditure of city funds, provision is commonly made for\r\nauditing the accounts of financial officials, and in a few states like\r\nOhio, Indiana, and Iowa, provision is made by law for state inspection\r\nand audit of municipal accounts by state examiners. This plan has proved\r\nvery effective. In one state, these inspectors found that municipal\r\nofficials had misappropriated more than $500,000, over half of which was\r\nrecovered and turned into the proper treasuries. In a number of cities\r\nwhere the commission form of government has been adopted provision is\r\nmade for monthly financial statements which must be published in the\r\nlocal newspapers, and for annual examinations of city accounts by expert\r\naccountants.\r\n\r\n_City Debts._--For the construction of permanent improvements, the\r\nerection of public buildings, and the establishment of commercial\r\nenterprises such as waterworks and gas works, cities must borrow money;\r\nand so one of the powers always given them is that of incurring debts.\r\nThis power, however, was greatly abused in the early history of our\r\nmunicipal development--so much so that many cities found themselves on\r\nthe verge of bankruptcy. In order to check this evil, many states have\r\nplaced a limit upon the municipal borrowing power, and some have\r\nprovided that whenever a debt is incurred, provision shall be made at\r\nthe same time for payment of the interest and the principal within a\r\ncertain period of years. The debt limit is usually a certain percentage\r\nof the assessed valuation of the taxable property within the city. It\r\nranges from 2 per cent in Boston, to 10 per cent in New York. In some\r\ncases the limit is so low that cities have been handicapped in\r\nconstructing needed permanent improvements. Thus in Chicago, where\r\nproperty has been assessed at only one fifth of its real value, the\r\nresult of the debt limitation has been to render extensive improvements\r\nvery difficult, and to compel the city to meet the expense of many\r\nabsolutely necessary undertakings out of its current revenues when the\r\ncost should have been distributed over a period of years. Chicago, as a\r\nconsequence, has the smallest debt of any of the large cities of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n=Police Protection.=--Where large numbers of people are living together\r\nin close proximity the problem of maintaining order and preventing some\r\nfrom violating the rights of others is very much greater than in\r\nsparsely settled rural communities. One of the principal tasks of the\r\nauthorities in a city, therefore, is to provide police protection for\r\nthe inhabitants. This is done through the agency of a body of men\r\norganized and uniformed somewhat after the manner of an army. The size\r\nof this force varies ordinarily in proportion to the population of the\r\ncity. In New York city, for example, the entire police force numbers\r\nmore than 10,000 men--a body as large as the army of the United States\r\nwas in the early days of our history. In Chicago there are altogether\r\nsome 8,000 men in the police service of the city.\r\n\r\n_Organization._--The management of the police force is usually under the\r\ndirection of an official called a commissioner, superintendent, or\r\nchief, though in some cities it is controlled instead by a board. In a\r\nfew cities this board is appointed by some state official, usually the\r\ngovernor, for it is believed by many persons that since the police are\r\ncharged with enforcing state laws as well as municipal ordinances, they\r\nshould be under state rather than local control. Where they are entirely\r\nunder local control, it is sometimes difficult to secure the enforcement\r\nof such state laws as those requiring saloons to be closed at certain\r\nhours during the night and on Sundays, especially when local sentiment\r\nis opposed to such restrictions. Below the head of the police force are\r\nusually deputy chiefs, inspectors, captains, sergeants, roundsmen, and\r\nfinally the patrolmen. The city is usually divided into precincts, in\r\neach of which there is a police station under the charge of a sergeant\r\nor some other official. A number of precincts are grouped together in\r\ndistricts with an inspector in charge of each, and so on. In the large\r\ncities there are also usually special detachments of the police force\r\norganized for special services. Such are the mounted police, the bicycle\r\nsquad, the river and harbor police, the sanitary police, and the\r\ndetective force.\r\n\r\n_Police Corruption._--The control of the police branch of the city\r\nservice is very difficult because of the opportunities for corruption\r\nwhich are open to the members of the force. It has not infrequently\r\nhappened that the police in the large cities have systematically sold\r\nthe right to violate the law. Gambling houses, saloons, and other places\r\nof vice sometimes regularly pay members of the police force for the\r\nprivilege of violating the law, and the heads of the force have\r\nfrequently found it impossible to prevent the practice. A recent police\r\ncommissioner in New York, for example, said that there was an organized\r\nsystem among the police of his city for selling the right to violate the\r\nlaw; that many of the captains and inspectors had grown rich out of the\r\nproceeds, and that the system was so thoroughly intrenched that he was\r\npowerless to break it up.\r\n\r\n=Health Protection.=--In densely populated districts the danger from the\r\nspread of disease is much greater than in rural communities where the\r\nconditions which breed disease are less prevalent, and where the spread\r\nof epidemics may be more easily prevented. In the smaller cities the\r\nchief health authority is a board, but in the large cities there is\r\nusually a department of health at the head of which is a single\r\ncommissioner. Other officials are inspectors of various kinds, analysts,\r\ncollectors of statistics, superintendents of hospitals, etc.\r\n\r\n_Work of the Health Department._--Among the principal duties of the\r\nhealth authorities are the inspection and abatement of unsanitary places\r\nand the suppression of nuisances; the inspection of public buildings and\r\nsometimes of private dwellings with special reference to drainage; the\r\nremoval of garbage and other refuse (in some cities); the inspection of\r\nthe city water supply; the inspection of food, particularly milk; the\r\ncontrol of certain establishments of an offensive character, such as\r\nslaughterhouses, soap factories, and fertilizer factories; the\r\nvaccination of school children and often of other persons, as a\r\nprecaution against smallpox; the isolation and quarantine of persons\r\nsuffering from contagious diseases; the maintenance of pesthouses and\r\nhospitals; and the collection of vital statistics.\r\n\r\nOne great source of disease in cities is impurity of the food supply,\r\nespecially of milk, and much of the activity of the health department is\r\ndirected toward the inspection of milk and other food. Crowded,\r\nill-ventilated, and poorly constructed dwellings are another source of\r\ndisease, and many cities have undertaken to prevent this evil as far as\r\npossible through tenement house laws and building regulations requiring\r\ndwellings to be constructed according to plans prescribed by law. The\r\nenforcement of these laws often devolves upon the health department,\r\nwhich carries out a rigid system of inspection.\r\n\r\nIn recent years much more attention than formerly has been given to the\r\nproblems of health administration, and great improvement has been made.\r\nSo efficient is the health administration of some of our large cities\r\nthat the death rate in proportion to the population is actually lower\r\nthan it is in many small country towns where little or no attention is\r\npaid to this important branch of administration.\r\n\r\n=Fire Protection.=--The danger from fire, like that from disease, is\r\nobviously greater in crowded cities than in country districts.\r\nTherefore, every large city and most small ones maintain an organized\r\nfire department. In the days of small cities reliance upon voluntary\r\nunpaid fire companies was the rule, and this is true even to-day in many\r\nof the smaller towns and cities. In the larger cities, however, there\r\nare organized professional companies, the members of which give all\r\ntheir time to the service and are paid regular salaries. New York city\r\nhas more than 5,000 men in its fire department, some 900 pieces of\r\napparatus including more than a dozen fire boats, and hundreds of\r\nthousands of feet of hose. At the head of the department there is\r\nusually an official called a fire chief or fire marshal, appointed by\r\nthe mayor. The rank and file of the department are under civil service\r\nrules, the employment is of a permanent character, and many cities have\r\nprovided a system of pensions for members who have grown old or are\r\ndisabled from injuries.\r\n\r\nGreat improvement has been made in the methods of fighting fires and in\r\nthe character of the apparatus employed, so that the danger from loss by\r\nfire has greatly diminished. Furthermore, the more general use of brick\r\nand stone for building purposes in the larger cities has made the danger\r\nfrom fire much less than in the old days when most houses were built of\r\nwood. Many cities have what are called \"fire limits,\" that is, districts\r\nin which it is forbidden to erect wooden buildings.\r\n\r\n=Municipal Public Utilities.=--People crowded together in cities depend\r\nlargely upon public service companies for their water supply, for\r\nelectric light and gas, for telephone service, and for the means of\r\ntransportation. The furnishing of each of these services, from the very\r\nnature of the case, tends to become a natural monopoly. Moreover, such\r\ncompanies must use the city streets in serving their patrons. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that they must be subject to public control,\r\notherwise the public might be charged exorbitant prices and the use of\r\nthe streets by the citizens unnecessarily interfered with. Before\r\nengaging in a service of this kind, therefore, the street railway\r\ncompany must secure permission from the city to lay tracks on the\r\nstreets and to operate cars thereon. Likewise a telephone or electric\r\nlight company must have permission to erect its poles on the streets or\r\nalleys, and a gas or water company must have authority to tear up\r\npavements and put its pipes and mains under the streets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUNICIPAL LIGHTING, DENVER, COLORADO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF THE LOS ANGELES AQUEDUCT, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nThis Aqueduct is 11 feet in diameter and carries water from Owens River\r\n246 miles to Los Angeles.]\r\n\r\n_Franchises._--The permit thus granted is called a \"franchise,\" and is\r\nin the nature of a contract between the city and the company. Public\r\nservice franchises are often of great value to the companies which\r\nreceive them, for the business of these companies in a large city is apt\r\nto be very profitable. Sometimes the dividends which they pay their\r\nstockholders are very large, and not infrequently, to deceive the public\r\nas to the real amount, the profits are concealed by \"watering\" the\r\nstock, that is, by increasing it beyond the amount of the capital\r\nactually invested. Experience has shown that in granting franchises\r\ncertain restrictions or conditions should be placed on the companies to\r\nwhom they are granted.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the duration of the franchise should be limited. Formerly,\r\nit was not uncommon to grant franchises for fifty or one hundred years,\r\nand indeed sometimes for an indefinite period. The objection to this\r\npractice is that with the growth of the city, the increased value of the\r\nfranchise resulting from such growth goes entirely to the company, while\r\nthe city is deprived of the opportunity of making a better bargain with\r\nthe company. A franchise ought, however, to be for a period sufficiently\r\nlong to enable the company to derive a reasonable return on its\r\ninvestment. Obviously, no company could afford to establish an electric\r\nlight plant or gas plant if its franchise were limited to a period as\r\nshort as five years. The better opinion now is that twenty or\r\ntwenty-five years is a reasonable period, and the constitution or\r\nstatutes of a number of states forbid the granting of franchises for a\r\nlonger period.\r\n\r\nFrequently the franchise contains provisions in regard to the rates to\r\nbe charged and the quality of service to be performed. In many states\r\nthere are state commissions which have power to supervise the operations\r\nof all public service corporations and in some cases even to fix the\r\nrates which they shall be allowed to charge. As long as such rates are\r\nreasonable, that is, high enough to allow the corporation a reasonable\r\nreturn on its investment, the courts will not interfere.\r\n\r\nIt is now the practice to require public service companies to pay a\r\nreasonable compensation for the franchises which they receive. This is\r\nusually a certain percentage of the gross receipts, or sometimes, in the\r\ncase of street railway companies, a certain sum for each car operated.\r\nWhen the compensation is a certain percentage of the receipts, provision\r\nought to be made for examination of the books of the company in order to\r\nprevent the public from being defrauded of its share of the earnings.\r\n\r\n=Municipal Ownership.=--Sometimes, instead of relying upon private\r\ncorporations to supply the people with water, gas, and electric light,\r\nthe city itself undertakes to do this. Very many cities own their\r\nwaterworks,[8] while some own their electric light plants, and a few own\r\ntheir gas plants. In Europe, municipal ownership and operation of such\r\npublic utilities is very common, and even the telephone and street\r\nrailway services are often supplied by the city.\r\n\r\n    [8] The Census Bureau reported in 1916 that 155 of the 204 cities\r\n    having populations in excess of 30,000 owned their water supply\r\n    systems.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for municipal ownership are that better service\r\nwill be furnished when the business is conducted by the city, because in\r\nthat case it will be operated solely with the interest of the public in\r\nview; and, secondly, the cost of the service to the community will be\r\nless because the earning of large dividends will not be the main end in\r\nview. The principal objection urged against municipal ownership in the\r\nUnited States is that \"spoils\" politics still play such an important\r\npart in our city government that the management of such enterprises is\r\nlikely to fall into the hands of incompetent politicians and party\r\nworkers. Experience with municipal ownership has been satisfactory in a\r\ngreat many cases where it has been tried, although the principle upon\r\nwhich it rests is contrary to the notions of many people in regard to\r\nthe proper functions of government.\r\n\r\n=Municipal Courts.=--In every city there are certain inferior courts\r\ncalled by various names, police courts, magistrates' courts, or\r\nmunicipal courts, which have jurisdiction over offenses against the\r\nordinances of the city. These courts constitute a very important part of\r\nour governmental machinery, and they have rarely received the\r\nconsideration which their importance requires. They are practically\r\ncourts of last resort for a large number of persons charged with minor\r\noffenses, and from them many ignorant persons in the large cities gain\r\ntheir impression of American institutions. In the city of New York, for\r\nexample, more than 100,000 persons are brought before these courts every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates who hold municipal courts are often men of little or no\r\nlegal training, and the experience of some cities has been that many of\r\nthem are without integrity. Recently there has been much discussion of\r\nhow to improve the character and usefulness of these courts, and in\r\nseveral cities notable reforms have already been introduced. The Chicago\r\nmunicipal court recently established is an excellent example of what can\r\nbe accomplished in this direction. It consists of thirty-one judges, and\r\nthe salary paid them is sufficiently large to attract well-trained\r\nlawyers of respectability. The procedure of the court is simple and it\r\nis so organized as to dispatch rapidly the cases brought before it, so\r\nthat justice is administered more swiftly, perhaps, in this city than in\r\nany other in America.\r\n\r\n=The Commission Plan of Government.=--The increasing dissatisfaction\r\nwith the government of our cities by mayor and councils has recently led\r\na number of cities to abandon the system for a new method known as the\r\ncommission plan. The principal feature of this method is that all the\r\npowers of government heretofore exercised by the mayor and council are\r\nintrusted to a small commission usually chosen from the city at large.\r\nThe plan was first put into operation in the city of Galveston after the\r\ngreat storm of 1900 which destroyed the lives of some 6,000 of its\r\ncitizens and left the city in a condition of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nUnder the new charter which was adopted, practically all the powers of\r\ngovernment were vested in a mayor and four commissioners, each of these\r\nmen being put in charge of one of the five departments into which the\r\nadministrative service was divided.\r\n\r\n_Merits._--Several advantages are claimed for this plan of municipal\r\ngovernment. In the first place, it does away with the evils of the ward\r\nsystem by providing that the commissioners shall be chosen from the city\r\nat large, and this tends to secure the election of men of larger\r\nability. Again, it is argued that a small body of men is better fitted\r\nto govern a city than a large council composed of members who consider\r\nthemselves the special representatives of the petty districts from which\r\nthey are chosen. The affairs of a city are necessarily complex and often\r\ntechnical in nature and require for their special management skill and\r\nefficiency. City government is often compared to the management of a\r\nbusiness enterprise like a bank or a manufacturing concern, which, as\r\nexperience has shown, can be better conducted by a small board of\r\ndirectors than by the whole body of stockholders. Finally, the\r\nconcentration of the powers of the city in a small body of men tends to\r\nsecure a more effective responsibility than can be secured under a\r\nsystem in which the responsibility is divided between the mayor and\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n_Objections._--The chief objections that have been urged against the\r\ncommission plan are that, by intrusting both the legislative and the\r\nexecutive power to the same hands, it sacrifices the principle of the\r\nseparation of powers--a principle long cherished in America. In the\r\nsecond place, by doing away with the council, it sacrifices to a\r\ncertain extent the representative principle and places all the vast\r\npowers of the city in the hands of a few men.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the system has much to commend it, and it has been adopted\r\nin about four hundred towns and cities.\r\n\r\n=The City Manager Plan.=--A still more recent form of municipal\r\ngovernment vests the management of the affairs of the city in a single\r\nperson, called the city manager. He is paid a reasonably high salary and\r\nis chosen by the commission because of his expert knowledge. This plan\r\nhas been introduced in Dayton, Springfield, and Sandusky, Ohio; Newburgh\r\nand Niagara Falls, New York; Sumter, South Carolina; Jackson, Grand\r\nRapids, and Kalamazoo, Michigan; San Diego and Alameda, California; and\r\nsome seventy other cities and towns.\r\n\r\n=Village Government.=--Differing from cities chiefly in size and in the\r\nextent of governmental powers, are small municipal corporations\r\nvariously called villages, boroughs, and incorporated towns. The\r\nprocedure of incorporation is usually by petition from a certain number\r\nof the inhabitants, and a popular vote on the question. The law\r\ngenerally prescribes a minimum population, which is usually\r\nsmall--sometimes as low as one hundred inhabitants.\r\n\r\n_Village Officers._--The principal authority is usually a small board of\r\ntrustees or a council, consisting of from three to seven members elected\r\nfrom the village at large, though in some instances the number is\r\nlarger, and some villages have the ward system. The village board is\r\nempowered to adopt ordinances relating to police, health, and other\r\nmatters affecting the good order and welfare of the community. They may\r\nlevy taxes, borrow money, open and construct streets, construct drains,\r\nestablish water and lighting plants and the like, and may license\r\npeddlers, hack drivers, and other persons who use the streets for the\r\nconduct of their business. The chief officer of the village is the\r\nmayor, president, or chairman of the trustees, elected either by the\r\nvoters or by the trustees. There is also usually a clerk or recorder, a\r\ntreasurer, a marshal or constable, and sometimes a street commissioner,\r\na justice of the peace, and an attorney.\r\n\r\nWhen the population reaches a certain number, which varies in the\r\ndifferent states (pp. 25-26), the village organization is put aside, the\r\ncommunity organizes itself into a city, takes on a more elaborate\r\norganization, receives larger powers, and undertakes a wider range of\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, chs.\r\n    xxvii-xxviii.

The consideration of state government properly precedes the\r\nstudy of national government, not only because the states existed before\r\nthe national government did, and in a sense furnished the models upon\r\nwhich it was constructed, but because their governments regulate the\r\nlarger proportion of our public affairs and hence concern more vitally\r\nthe interests of the mass of people than does the national government.\r\n\r\nThe states collectively make up our great republic, but they are not\r\nmere administrative districts of the union created for convenience in\r\ncarrying on the affairs of national government. They do not, for\r\nexample, bear the same relation to the union that a county does to the\r\nstate, or a township to the county. A county is nothing more than a\r\ndistrict carved out of the state for administrative convenience, and\r\nprovided with such an organization and given such powers of local\r\ngovernment as the state may choose to give it. The states, on the other\r\nhand, are not creations of the national government; their place as\r\nconstituent members of the union is determined by the Federal\r\nConstitution, framed by the people of the United States, and their\r\nrights and obligations are fixed by the same authority. Each state,\r\nhowever, determines its own form of government and decides for itself\r\nwhat activities it will undertake.\r\n\r\n=Division of Powers.=--The Federal Constitution has marked out a\r\ndefinite sphere of power for the states, on the one hand, and another\r\nsphere for the national government on the other, and each within its\r\nsphere is supreme. Upon the domain thus created for each the other may\r\nnot encroach. Each is kept strictly within its own constitutional sphere\r\nby the federal Supreme Court, and the balance between the union and its\r\nmembers is harmoniously preserved.\r\n\r\nThe states were already in existence with organized governments in\r\noperation when the national government was created. The founders of the\r\nnational government conferred upon it only such powers as experience and\r\nreason demonstrated could be more effectively regulated by a common\r\ngovernment than by a number of separate governments; they left the\r\nstates largely as they were, and limited their powers only so far as was\r\nnecessary to establish a more effective union than the one then\r\nexisting. Experience had taught them, for example, that commerce with\r\nforeign countries and among the states themselves should be regulated by\r\na single authority acting for the entire country: only in this way could\r\nuniformity be secured, and uniformity in such matters was indispensable\r\nto the peace and perpetuity of the union. Accordingly, the national\r\ngovernment was vested with power over this and other matters which\r\nclearly required uniformity of regulation, and the remaining powers of\r\ngovernment were left with the states, where they had always been. Thus\r\nit came about that the national government was made an authority of\r\nenumerated or delegated powers, while the states have reserved powers.\r\n\r\n_Prohibitions._--It was thought wise, however, to prohibit both the\r\nnational government and those of the states from doing certain things,\r\nand thus we find provisions in the Federal Constitution forbidding both\r\ngovernments from granting titles of nobility, from passing ex post facto\r\nlaws, bills of attainder, etc. Likewise the states were prohibited from\r\nentering into treaties with foreign countries, from coining money, from\r\nimpairing the obligation of contracts, and from passing laws on certain\r\nother subjects which it was clearly unwise to leave to state regulation.\r\n\r\n=Powers of the States.=--The powers left to the states, unlike those\r\nconferred upon the national government, cannot be enumerated. They are\r\nso varied in character, and so extensive, that an attempt to enumerate\r\nthem would involve cataloguing all the multitudinous business and social\r\nrelationships of life. The powers of the national government seem much\r\ngreater by comparison than those of the states, partly because they are\r\nset forth in the Constitution and partly because of their application\r\nthroughout the entire country, but in reality they are not only far less\r\nnumerous but affect less vitally the great mass of the people. The\r\npowers of the states include such matters as the regulation of the\r\nownership, use, and disposition of property; the conduct of business and\r\nindustry; the making and enforcing of contracts; the conduct of\r\nreligious worship; education; marriage, divorce, and the domestic\r\nrelations generally; suffrage and elections; and the making and\r\nenforcement of the criminal law. In the division of governmental powers\r\nbetween the nation and the state, says Bryce, the state gets the most\r\nand the nation the highest, and so the balance between the two is\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n     \"An American,\" says Mr. Bryce, \"may, through a long life, never be\r\n     reminded of the federal government except when he votes at\r\n     presidential and congressional elections, buys a package of tobacco\r\n     bearing the government stamp, lodges a complaint against the post\r\n     office, and opens his trunks for a customhouse officer on the pier\r\n     at New York when he returns from a tour in Europe. His direct taxes\r\n     are paid to officials acting under state laws. The state or local\r\n     authority constituted by state statutes registers his birth,\r\n     appoints his guardian, pays for his schooling, gives him a share in\r\n     the estate of his father deceased, licenses him when he enters a\r\n     trade (if it be one needing a license), marries him, divorces him,\r\n     entertains civil actions against him, declares him a bankrupt,\r\n     hangs him for murder; the police that guard his house, the local\r\n     boards which look after the poor, control highways, impose water\r\n     rates, manage schools--all these derive their legal powers from his\r\n     state alone.\"\r\n\r\n=Rights and Privileges of the States as Members of the Union.=--The\r\nstates have certain rights and privileges which are guaranteed them by\r\nthe Federal Constitution, and of which they cannot be deprived by the\r\nnational government without their consent.\r\n\r\n_Republican Government._--Thus it is made the duty of the United States\r\nto guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of\r\ngovernment, that is, a government by the chosen representatives of the\r\npeople of the state. In a few cases rival governments have been set up\r\nin a state, each claiming to be the legitimate government and entitled\r\nto the obedience of the people; the one recognized by the federal\r\nauthorities has always prevailed.\r\n\r\n_Protection Against Invasion._--It is also made the duty of the national\r\ngovernment to protect the states against invasion. This is right and\r\nproper, since the states are forbidden by the Constitution to keep ships\r\nof war or troops in times of peace.\r\n\r\n_Protection Against Domestic Violence._--Again, it is made the duty of\r\nthe national government to protect the people of the states against\r\ndomestic violence arising from insurrection or riots, _provided_ that\r\napplication has been made by the proper state authorities. The purpose\r\nof this proviso is to remove the temptation to federal interference in\r\nstate affairs for political or other reasons against the wishes of the\r\npeople of the state. The ordinary procedure for the suppression of a\r\nlocal disturbance is for the sheriff of the county, or the mayor of the\r\ncity, to make use of the local police, and if necessary he may call upon\r\nthe citizens to come to his aid. If this is not effective, the governor\r\nmay be called upon to order out the state militia for the suppression of\r\nthe riot. If, however, the riot should spread and assume such\r\nproportions that the power of the state and local authorities is\r\ninsufficient, it becomes the right and duty of the governor, or the\r\nlegislature if it be in session, to call on the President of the United\r\nStates for the assistance of national troops. If in the President's\r\njudgment the situation is one which warrants federal intervention, he\r\nsends a detachment of troops from a near-by military post to restore\r\norder. Many times in our history federal troops have been used to put\r\ndown riots where the state authorities had shown themselves incapable of\r\nmaintaining order; two recent examples being in connection with strikes\r\namong the miners of Nevada in 1907, and of Colorado in 1914.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the President has no lawful right to interpose in the affairs\r\nof the state by the employment of troops until he has received an\r\napplication from the governor or the legislature, but if the disturbance\r\nis one which interferes with the operations of the national government\r\nor with the movement of interstate commerce, the President may intervene\r\nwhenever in his opinion the situation calls for federal action. Thus\r\nduring the Chicago strike riots of 1894, President Cleveland ordered a\r\ndetachment of federal troops to that city against the protests of the\r\ngovernor, upon being assured that the strikers were interfering with the\r\nmovement of the mails and with the conduct of interstate commerce and\r\nwere also disregarding the writs and processes of the United States\r\ncourts. The interference of the President was criticized by some\r\npersons, but the great body of citizens approved his course, and the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court upheld the validity of his action.\r\n\r\n_Other Rights of the States._--Among the other rights of the states\r\nunder the Federal Constitution may be mentioned the right of equal\r\nrepresentation in the senate, a right of which no state can be deprived\r\nwithout its consent, and the right of territorial integrity: no new\r\nstate may be created within the jurisdiction of another state, nor may\r\nany state be formed by the junction of two or more states or parts of\r\nstates, without the consent of the states concerned.\r\n\r\n=Obligations and Duties of the States.=--Rights and privileges usually\r\nimply obligations, and so we find that the states owe certain duties to\r\none another and to the union of which they are a part, and the harmony\r\nand success of the federal system are dependent in a large measure upon\r\nthe performance of these duties in good faith.\r\n\r\n_Full Faith and Credit._--First of all, each state must give full faith\r\nand credit to the acts, judicial proceedings, and records of the other\r\nstates. This means, for example, that a properly authenticated copy of a\r\nwill or deed duly executed in one state will be taken notice of and\r\nrights depending on it will be enforced in other states as though the\r\ninstrument were made therein. Likewise, a marriage legally celebrated in\r\none state will usually be treated as valid in another state, and the\r\nfacts of a case at law will be recognized in other states without the\r\nnecessity of retrial. The provision as to full faith and credit does\r\n_not_ mean that one state must enforce within its borders the laws of\r\nother states, or that its courts in reaching their decisions are bound\r\nby the decisions of the courts of its sister states. As a matter of\r\npractice, however, courts in one state in deciding difficult questions\r\nof law will examine the decisions of the courts of other states on\r\nsimilar points for their own enlightenment, and will show respect for\r\nthese decisions, the degree of deference depending on the standing of\r\nthe judges rendering the decision and upon the similarity of the laws\r\nand policies of the states concerned.\r\n\r\n_Surrender of Fugitives from Justice._--In the next place, it is made\r\nthe constitutional duty of the executive of each state to surrender\r\ncriminals escaping from other states, in order that they may be returned\r\nfor trial and punishment in the state from which they have fled. The\r\ndemand for the surrender of such fugitives is made by the governor of\r\nthe state from which the criminal has fled, and the governor upon whom\r\nthe demand is made ought to comply with it unless for very substantial\r\nreasons. There is no way, however, by which this obligation may be\r\nenforced, and there have been many cases where governors have refused to\r\ndeliver up criminals escaping from other states--usually for the reason\r\nthat, in the governor's opinion, the fugitive would not receive a fair\r\ntrial in the state from which he had fled.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Citizens of Other States._--Still another obligation\r\nimposed by the Federal Constitution on the states is that of treating\r\nthe citizens of other states as they treat their own citizens, i. e.,\r\nwithout discrimination. But this obligation has reference rather to\r\ncivil rights than to political privileges. It does not mean that an\r\nilliterate man who is allowed to vote in Illinois may go to\r\nMassachusetts and vote where an educational qualification for the\r\nsuffrage is required; nor does it mean that a woman who is allowed to\r\npractice law in one state may therefore practice in another state which\r\nexcludes women from engaging in that profession. What the provision does\r\nmean, is that whatever privileges and immunities a state allows to its\r\nown citizens, it must allow the citizens of other states on the same\r\nterms, and subject to the same conditions and no more. Thus a state\r\ncannot subject the citizens of other states to higher taxes than are\r\nimposed upon its own citizens.\r\n\r\n_Other Obligations._--Finally, it goes without saying that it is the\r\nduty of each state to treat its sister states in the spirit of comity\r\nand courtesy; to carry out the mandates of the Federal Constitution\r\nrelating to the election of senators, representatives, and presidential\r\nelectors so as to keep up the existence of the national government; and,\r\nin general, to perform in good faith all their other obligations as\r\nmembers of the union, without the performance of which the republic\r\nwould be a mere makeshift. The existence of the states is essential to\r\nthe union, and their preservation is as much within the care of the\r\nConstitution as is the union itself. Indeed, the Constitution in all its\r\nparts, said the Supreme Court of the United States in a famous case,\r\nlooks to an indestructible union of indestructible states.\r\n\r\n=The State Constitution; how Framed.=--The governmental organization of\r\neach of the states is set forth in a written instrument called a\r\nconstitution. Unlike the constitutions of some of the European states,\r\nwhich were granted by kings, and unlike, also, those of the British\r\nself-governing colonies, which were enacted by Parliament, all the\r\nAmerican constitutions now in existence were framed by constituent\r\nbodies representing the people, and in most cases they were approved by\r\nthe people before they went into effect. As Mr. Bryce has remarked, the\r\nAmerican state constitutions are the oldest things in the political\r\nhistory of America. Before the Federal Constitution was framed each of\r\nthe thirteen original states had a constitution of its own, most of them\r\nbeing framed by popular conventions chosen especially for the purpose.\r\n\r\nLater, when a territory asked to be admitted to the union as a new\r\nstate, Congress, through what is called an \"enabling act,\" empowered the\r\npeople of the territory to choose a convention to frame a constitution\r\nwhich, when submitted to the voters and approved by them, became the\r\nfundamental law of the new state. In a number of cases, however, the\r\npeople of the territory went ahead on their own initiative, and without\r\nthe authority of an enabling act framed their constitution and asked to\r\nbe admitted, and sometimes they were admitted as though they had acted\r\nunder the authority of Congress. Whenever an existing state wishes to\r\nframe a new constitution for itself, the usual mode of procedure is for\r\nthe legislature either to pass a resolution calling a convention, or to\r\nsubmit to the voters the question of the desirability of a new\r\nconstitution. A resolution calling a convention usually requires an\r\nextraordinary majority of both houses of the legislature, two thirds of\r\nthe members being the most common rule.\r\n\r\n=Ratification of New Constitutions.=--When the draft of the constitution\r\nhas been completed by the convention, it is usually submitted to the\r\nvoters of the state at a general or a special election, and if it is\r\napproved by a majority of those voting on the constitution, or (in some\r\nstates) of those voting at the election, it supersedes the old\r\nconstitution and goes into effect on a day prescribed. In some\r\ninstances, however, new constitutions were not submitted to popular\r\nvote; instead, the convention assumed the right to put them into effect\r\nwithout popular approval. Of the twenty-five state constitutions adopted\r\nbefore the year 1801, only three were submitted to the voters for their\r\napproval, but as time passed the practice of giving the people an\r\nopportunity to approve or reject proposed constitutions became the rule.\r\nIn the twenty years between 1890 and 1910 eight new constitutions were\r\nsubmitted to the people, and only five were put into force without\r\npopular ratification, namely, those of Mississippi (1890), South\r\nCarolina (1895), Delaware (1897), Louisiana (1898), and Virginia (1902).\r\n\r\n=Frequency of New Constitutions.=--The frequency with which the states\r\nrevise their constitutions varies in different sections of the country.\r\nIn New England new constitutions are rare, while in the states of the\r\nWest and the South new constitutions are framed, on an average, at least\r\nonce in every generation and sometimes oftener. Since the Revolution\r\nmore than two hundred constitutions have been made by the states, though\r\nsome of them never went into operation. Several of the states within a\r\nperiod of less than one hundred years have had as many as six, and a few\r\nhave had even more. The constitution of Massachusetts of 1780, with\r\nseveral subsequent amendments, is still in force; but outside of New\r\nEngland there are few constitutions that are more than thirty years old.\r\nSome of the states, indeed, have inserted provisions in their\r\nconstitutions making it the duty of the legislature at stated intervals\r\nto submit to the voters the question of calling a convention to revise\r\nthe existing constitution or to adopt an entirely new one. In this way\r\nthe people are given an opportunity to determine whether the\r\nconstitution under which they live shall be revised or superseded by a\r\nnew one, independently of the will of the legislature.\r\n\r\n=Contents of State Constitutions.=--The early state constitutions were\r\nbrief documents and dealt only with important matters of a fundamental\r\nand permanent character. They were remarkably free from detail and\r\nrarely contained more than 5,000 words. As time passed, however, there\r\nwas an increasing tendency to incorporate in them provisions in regard\r\nto many matters that had formerly been left to the legislature to be\r\nregulated by statute, so that some of the constitutions of the present\r\nday are bulky codes containing detailed provisions concerning many\r\nmatters that might more properly be dealt with by statute. The\r\nconstitution of Virginia, for example, has expanded from a document of a\r\nfew pages to one of seventy-five, from an instrument of about 1,500\r\nwords to one of more than 30,000. The present constitution of Alabama\r\ncontains about 33,000 words; that of Louisiana, about 45,000; and that\r\nof Oklahoma, about 50,000. The Virginia constitution contains a lengthy\r\narticle on the organization of counties; one on the government of\r\ncities, constituting a code almost as elaborate as a municipal\r\ncorporations act; one on agriculture and immigration; one on\r\ncorporations, containing fourteen sections; one on taxation and finance,\r\netc. The constitution of Oklahoma contains an article of seven sections\r\non federal relations, one of which deals with the liquor traffic;\r\nelaborate provisions regarding the referendum and initiative; a section\r\ndescribing the seal of the state; a detailed enumeration of those who\r\nare permitted to accept railroad passes; an article on insurance; one on\r\nmanufactures and commerce; and one on alien and corporate ownership of\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n_Parts of a Constitution._--A typical constitution consists of several\r\nparts: (1) a preamble; (2) a bill of rights; (3) a series of provisions\r\nrelating to the organization of the government and the powers and duties\r\nof the several departments; (4) a number of miscellaneous articles\r\ndealing with such matters as finance, revenue and debts, suffrage and\r\nelections, public education, local government, railroads, banks, and\r\nother corporations generally; (5) an article describing the procedure by\r\nwhich amendments may be proposed and ratified; and (6) a schedule. Many\r\nconstitutions contain an article defining the boundaries of the state,\r\nand most of them one on the distribution of the powers of government.\r\nSome of the newer constitutions also prescribe numerous limitations upon\r\nthe legislature, so great is the popular mistrust of legislatures\r\nto-day; while others lay down various rules as to the procedure of the\r\nlegislature. The schedule contains provisions for submitting the\r\nconstitution to the voters and making necessary arrangements for putting\r\nthe new constitution into effect.\r\n\r\n=The Bill of Rights=, says Bryce, is historically the most interesting\r\npart of the state constitution, and if we may judge by the space devoted\r\nto these provisions and the attention paid to their framing, they\r\nconstitute a very important part of the constitution. In a sense they\r\nare the lineal descendants of great English enactments like Magna\r\nCharta, the Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement, and of the\r\nvarious declarations of the Revolutionary Congresses in America. They\r\nconsist of limitations upon the government and of statements of the\r\nfundamental rights of man.\r\n\r\n_Some Provisions of the Bills of Rights._--Examining these bills of\r\nrights, we find that they all contain declarations in favor of freedom\r\nof religious worship, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and of the\r\npress, and most of them forbid the establishment of a state church or\r\nthe appropriation of money for the establishment or support of any\r\nreligious denomination. Most of them contain declarations providing for\r\ntrial by jury in criminal cases, indictments by grand jury, the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the right of the accused to a\r\nspeedy and public trial; a declaration of the right of citizens to bear\r\narms; the prohibition of excessive bail, cruel and unusual punishments,\r\ngeneral search warrants, and imprisonment for debt; the prohibition of\r\ntitles of nobility, ex post facto laws, and bills of attainder[9]; and\r\nprovisions forbidding the taking of private property except for public\r\npurposes and then only when just compensation is made.[10] Many of them\r\ncontain philosophical enunciations of political doctrines such as the\r\nassertion that all governments originate with the people, and are\r\ninstituted solely for their good; that all men are equal; that all power\r\nis inherent in the people; and that the people have at all times the\r\nright to alter, reform, or abolish their government. Some of the newer\r\nconstitutions declare that monopolies and perpetuities are contrary to\r\nthe principles of free government; that every citizen shall be free to\r\nobtain employment wherever possible; that a long lease of office is\r\ndangerous to the liberties of the people; that aliens shall have the\r\nsame rights of property as citizens; and so on.\r\n\r\n    [9] An ex post facto law is retroactive, making criminal an act that\r\n    was not a crime when committed, or increasing the punishment for past\r\n    crimes. A bill of attainder is a law convicting an accused person\r\n    without a trial, and imposing on him the penalties of treason.\r\n\r\n    [10] The inherent power of the state to take private property for\r\n    public use is called the right of eminent domain.\r\n\r\nThe real importance of the bills of rights, now that executive tyranny\r\nis a thing of the past, is not very great.\r\n\r\n=Amendment of State Constitutions.=--The practice of inserting in the\r\nconstitution many provisions which are temporary in character, makes\r\nfrequent alteration a necessity if the constitution is to meet the\r\nrapidly changing needs and conditions of the state. Some of the early\r\nconstitutions contained no express provision for their own amendment,\r\nbut as time passed changes became manifestly necessary, and in time they\r\nwere all amended or supplanted entirely by new ones, notwithstanding the\r\nabsence of amending provisions. Ultimately the advantage of pointing out\r\nin the constitution a legal and orderly way of amendment came to be\r\ngenerally appreciated, and at the present time all of the constitutions\r\ncontain amending provisions. These clauses provide that amendments may\r\nbe proposed, either by a convention called by the legislature, or by the\r\nlegislature itself, usually by an extraordinary majority; in either case\r\nthe proposed amendment must be submitted to the voters for their\r\napproval, and it becomes a part of the constitution only if ratified by\r\na majority of those voting on the proposed amendment or, in some states,\r\nby a majority of those voting at the election at which the proposed\r\namendment is submitted. A new method of amendment by popular initiative\r\nwas adopted in Oregon in 1902. According to this method a proposed\r\namendment may be framed by the people by petition and submitted to a\r\npopular vote without the necessity of the intervention of the\r\nlegislature in any form.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the restrictions imposed, most of the constitutions are\r\nfrequently amended. During the two decades from 1900 to 1919, 1500\r\namendments were proposed by the legislatures of the several states, or\r\nby popular initiative, and of these about 900 were ratified. At the\r\ngeneral election of 1918, no less than 130 amendments were voted on by\r\nthe people of the different states, and a number of others were awaiting\r\nthe action of the legislatures soon to meet. In five western states\r\nalone 270 amendments were submitted from 1914 to 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, chs.\r\n     xxii-xxiii.

In general,\r\na state legislature may exercise any powers which are not denied to it\r\nby the Constitution of the United States or by the constitution of the\r\nstate. Its powers, in other words, are residuary in character, rather\r\nthan delegated or granted.\r\n\r\n_Limitations._--In recent years, however, mainly on account of the\r\npopular distrust in which our legislatures have come to be held,\r\nnumerous limitations upon their powers have been imposed by the\r\nconstitutions of many states. Thus they are frequently forbidden\r\nabsolutely to pass local or special laws where a general law is\r\napplicable, or they are allowed to enact such laws only under certain\r\nrestrictions. In most states, also, the legislature cannot run the state\r\ninto debt beyond a certain amount, and its power to impose taxes and\r\nappropriate money is generally restricted. Finally, its power of\r\nlegislation has been limited by the present practice of regulating many\r\nimportant matters in the constitution itself. In the newer constitutions\r\nespecially we find a large number of provisions relating to schools,\r\ncities, towns, railroads, corporations, taxation, and other matters. To\r\nthat extent, therefore, the legislature is deprived of its power of\r\nlegislation on these subjects.\r\n\r\n_Extent of the Legislative Power._--In spite of the numerous\r\nrestrictions, however, the power of the legislature is very large. It\r\nenacts the whole body of criminal law of the state; makes laws\r\nconcerning the ownership, use, and disposition of property, laws\r\nconcerning contracts, trade, business, industry, the exercise of such\r\nprofessions as law, medicine, pharmacy, and others; laws relating to the\r\ngovernment of counties, towns, cities, and other localities; laws\r\nconcerning the public health, education, charity, marriage and divorce,\r\nand the conduct of elections; laws concerning railroads, canals,\r\nferries, drainage, manufacturing, eminent domain, and a great variety of\r\nother matters. The subjects concerning which the legislatures may enact\r\nlaws are indeed so numerous and varied that it would be impossible to\r\nenumerate them all. For that reason the legislature is by far the most\r\nimportant branch of the state government, and it is highly important\r\nthat it should be composed of honest, intelligent, and efficient\r\nmembers. Unfortunately, however, in many states the legislature has\r\ndeclined in public esteem. In the early days of our history the\r\nlegislative branch of the government was all-powerful. It was not only\r\npractically unlimited as to its power of legislation, but it was\r\nintrusted with the choice of many important officers of the state. Now,\r\nhowever, there is a disposition to cut down its powers and place\r\nrestrictions on the exercise of those that are left to it. In many\r\nstates the people have secured the power to legislate for themselves by\r\nmeans of the initiative and referendum (pp. 85-89); and, to diminish the\r\npower of the legislature to enact useless laws, many constitutions limit\r\nthe length of the sessions to forty or sixty days in the hope of\r\ncompelling it to devote its time to the consideration of important\r\nmeasures of general interest.\r\n\r\n=Structure of the Legislature.=--Every state legislature to-day consists\r\nof two houses. At first several states followed the example of the\r\nCongress of the Confederation and tried the single-chamber system, but\r\nthey soon found its disadvantages serious, and substituted legislatures\r\nwith two houses. The principal advantage of a bicameral legislature is\r\nthat each house serves as a check upon the haste of the other and thus\r\ninsures more careful consideration of bills. Nevertheless, proposals\r\nhave recently been made in several states to establish a\r\nsingle-chambered legislature, and the question was voted on by the\r\nelectors of Oregon in 1912 and in 1914, and by those of Arizona in 1916.\r\n\r\nThe lawmaking body popularly known as the legislature is officially so\r\ndesignated in some states, but in others the formal name is the general\r\nassembly or the legislative assembly, and in two, Massachusetts and New\r\nHampshire, the colonial title, \"general court,\" is still retained. In\r\nall the states the upper house is styled the senate. In most of them the\r\nlower chamber is known as the house of representatives, though in a few\r\nit is styled the assembly and in three the house of delegates.\r\n\r\nBoth houses of the state legislature are chosen by the people. The\r\nprincipal differences in their make-up are, that the senate is a smaller\r\nbody and therefore each senator represents a larger constituency, the\r\nsenators in many states are chosen for a longer term, and usually the\r\nsenate is vested with special functions such as the approval of\r\nexecutive appointments to office, and the trial of impeachment cases.\r\n\r\n_The State Senate._--The size of the senate varies from seventeen\r\nmembers in Delaware to sixty-seven in Minnesota, the average number\r\nbeing about thirty-five. In about two thirds of the states the term of\r\nsenators is four years; in New Jersey their term is three years; in\r\nMassachusetts it is one year; in the remaining states it is two years.\r\nIn about one third of the states the terms of the senators and the\r\nrepresentatives are the same. In some states the senators are divided\r\ninto classes, and only half of them retire at the same time.\r\n\r\n_The House of Representatives._--The house of representatives everywhere\r\nis a more numerous body than the senate, and in a few states the\r\ndisproportion is very great. Thus the New Hampshire legislature with a\r\nsenate of 24 members has a house of representatives of more than 400\r\nmembers, the largest in any state, a body about as large as the national\r\nhouse of representatives. The Connecticut legislature is composed of a\r\nsenate of 35 members and a house of representatives of 258 members;\r\nVermont has a senate of 30 members and a house of representatives of\r\n246; Massachusetts has a senate of 40 members and a house of 240. The\r\nsmallest houses of representatives are those of Delaware and Arizona,\r\neach consisting of 35 members.\r\n\r\n_Apportionment of Senators and Representatives._--Senators and\r\nrepresentatives are apportioned among districts, usually on the basis of\r\npopulation. Political units, however, are often taken into\r\nconsideration, and in some states such units rather than the number of\r\ninhabitants are the determining element. Thus it is frequently provided\r\nthat each county shall be entitled to one senator, though the population\r\nof some counties may be many times as great as that of other counties.\r\nIn some of the New England states the inequalities of representation are\r\nso glaring as to constitute a great injustice to the more populous\r\ntowns. In Connecticut, for example, the members of the lower house are\r\ndistributed among the towns of the state, without regard to their\r\npopulation. As a result each of the small towns of Union, Hartland,\r\nKillingworth, and Colebrook, with an average population of less than\r\n1,000 persons, has two representatives, while New Haven, with 133,000\r\ninhabitants, has only two. Hartford, with about 99,000, has only two,\r\nand so has Bridgeport with a population of 102,000, and Waterbury with\r\n73,000. These four cities comprise about one third the population of the\r\nstate, but they have only one thirty-second part of the membership of\r\nthe house of representatives. A similar system of representation exists\r\nin Vermont and in the senate of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as a result of \"gerrymandering\" by the political party in\r\ncontrol of the legislature the legislative districts are frequently so\r\nconstructed as to give the majority party more than its fair share of\r\nrepresentatives. As a result there are in some states great inequalities\r\nof representation among the different counties or legislative districts.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent large cities from controlling the legislature and\r\nthereby dominating the state, a few constitutions limit their\r\nrepresentation in the legislature. Thus in New York it is provided that\r\nno county, however populous, shall have more than one third of all the\r\nrepresentatives, and a somewhat similar provision is contained in the\r\nconstitutions of Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n=Minority Representation in the Legislature.=--Where there are two\r\npolitical parties in the state, it is worth considering whether some\r\nprovision should not be made for allowing each party to choose a number\r\nof representatives in proportion to its numerical strength, or at least\r\nfor allowing the weaker party some representation in the legislature. It\r\nnot infrequently happens under the present system that the majority\r\nparty in the state succeeds in electing nearly all the representatives,\r\nleaving the other party practically without representation, although it\r\nmay be strong enough to cast hundreds of thousands of votes in the\r\nstate as a whole. In the Oregon state election of 1906, for example, the\r\nRepublican party, with only 55 per cent of the voting strength, elected\r\neighty-eight members of the legislature, while the Democratic party,\r\nthough casting 34 per cent of the total vote, elected only seven\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe present constitution of Illinois contains a clause which makes it\r\npossible for the minority party in each of the fifty-one legislative\r\ndistricts into which the state is divided to elect at least one of the\r\nthree representatives to which the district is entitled. Each voter is\r\nallowed three votes, and he may give one vote to each of three\r\ncandidates, or he may give all three to one candidate, or two to one\r\ncandidate and one to another. Usually the party having the majority in\r\nthe district elects two candidates and the minority party one, the\r\nvoters of the latter party concentrating all their votes on the one\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\n=Legislative Sessions.=--In the great majority of states the\r\nlegislatures hold regular sessions every two years. In New York, New\r\nJersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Georgia, and South Carolina the\r\nlegislature meets every year in regular session. Alabama is contented\r\nwith a session once in every four years. In California the session is\r\ndivided into two parts, the first being devoted exclusively to the\r\nintroduction of bills. The legislature then takes a recess of a month to\r\nenable the members to consult their constituents in regard to the bills\r\nintroduced, after which it reassembles for the enactment of such\r\nlegislation as seems to be demanded. In all the states the governor is\r\nempowered to call extraordinary sessions for the consideration of\r\nspecial matters of an urgent character.\r\n\r\nThere is a popular belief that legislatures waste much of their time in\r\nthe consideration of petty matters, and in many states the constitution\r\neither limits the length of the session,--sometimes to forty, fifty, or\r\nsixty days,--or provides that where the session is prolonged beyond a\r\ncertain number of days, the pay of members shall cease. The wisdom of\r\nlimiting the sessions to such brief periods, however, is doubtful, and\r\nseveral states that once imposed such restrictions have since removed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n=Legislative Compensation.=--In all the states, members of the\r\nlegislature receive pay for their services. This is either in the form\r\nof a definite amount per year, term, or session, or so much per day. The\r\nlargest legislative salaries are those of Illinois ($3,500 per biennial\r\nsession), New York ($1,500 per year), Massachusetts and Ohio ($1,000 per\r\nyear), and Pennsylvania ($1,500 per biennial session). In New Hampshire,\r\non the other hand, the salary is only $200 per biennial session, in\r\nConnecticut $300, and in South Carolina $200 for each annual session. In\r\nthirty states the per diem method of compensation prevails, the amount\r\nranging from three dollars per day, which is the salary paid in Kansas\r\nand Oregon, to ten dollars per day, in Kentucky, Montana, and Nebraska,\r\nthe most usual sum being four or five dollars per day. In several\r\nstates, however, the per diem compensation ceases, or is reduced to a\r\nnominal amount, after the legislature has been in session 60 days or 90\r\ndays. Mileage ranging in amount from ten cents per mile to twenty-five\r\ncents is usually allowed, and in a number of states there is a small\r\nallowance for postage, stationery, and newspapers. In some states the\r\npay of the legislators is fixed by the constitution, and hence the\r\nmatter is beyond control of the legislature. Indeed, in only a few\r\nstates is the matter of legislative pay left entirely to the discretion\r\nof the legislature without restriction.\r\n\r\nIn a number of them the constitution either forbids members to accept\r\nfree passes on the railroads, or makes it the duty of the legislature to\r\npass laws prohibiting the acceptance of such passes.\r\n\r\n=Organization of the Legislature.=--Each house is usually free to\r\norganize itself as it may see fit, though where the office of lieutenant\r\ngovernor exists, the constitution designates that official as the\r\npresiding officer of the senate.\r\n\r\n_The Speaker._--The presiding officer of the lower house is styled the\r\nspeaker, and in all the states he is chosen by the house from its own\r\nmembership. He calls the house to order, presides over its\r\ndeliberations, enforces the rules governing debate, puts motions and\r\nstates questions, makes rulings on points of order, recognizes members\r\nwho desire to address the house, appoints the committees, signs the acts\r\nand resolutions passed by the house, and maintains order and decorum. He\r\nusually belongs to the political party which is in the majority in the\r\nhouse, and in making up the committees and recognizing members for the\r\npurpose of debate he usually favors those of his own party.\r\n\r\n_The Clerk._--Each house has a clerk or secretary who keeps the journal\r\nof the proceedings, has custody of all bills and resolutions before the\r\nhouse, keeps the calendar of bills, calls the roll, reads bills, and\r\nperforms other duties of a like character. He is often assisted by other\r\nclerks such as a reading clerk, an engrossing clerk, sometimes an\r\nenrolling clerk, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATE CAPITOL, HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATE CAPITOL, SALEM, OREGON]\r\n\r\n_Sergeant-at-arms._--To execute the orders of the house in preserving\r\ngood order and enforcing the rules, there is an officer called a\r\nsergeant-at-arms. He usually has custody of the hall in which the\r\nmeetings are held, makes arrests when the house orders an outsider to be\r\ntaken into custody for contempt, compels absent members to attend\r\nwhen ordered by the house to do so, and sometimes keeps the accounts of\r\nthe pay and mileage of members.\r\n\r\n_Other Officers and Employees._--Usually, also, there is a chaplain who\r\nopens the session with prayer, though he is not always a paid employee;\r\na postmaster; and a number of miscellaneous employees such as\r\ndoorkeepers, janitors, copying clerks, stenographers, pages, etc.[11]\r\n\r\n    [11] The California house of representatives, consisting of eighty\r\n    members, had in 1907 a total of 335 employees, with salaries ranging\r\n    from $3 to $8 per day. The senate, composed of forty members, had 228\r\n    employees. Since then an amendment to the constitution of that state\r\n    has been adopted, limiting to $500 per day the amount that may be\r\n    expended by the legislature for clerical assistance. In some other\r\n    states the number of employees of the legislature seems excessive, and\r\n    restrictions similar to that now found in the constitution of\r\n    California might not be out of place. Thus in 1903 there were 226\r\n    employees of the legislature of Illinois, 315 in Missouri, 299 in New\r\n    York, and 225 in Oregon. The expense account of legislative employees\r\n    in Illinois for the session of 1913 amounted to more than $95,000; the\r\n    amount in New York was over $250,000; and in Wisconsin over $76,000.\r\n    One of the arguments now being urged in some states in favor of a\r\n    single-chamber legislature is that it would make possible a material\r\n    reduction in the number of legislative employees and a corresponding\r\n    diminution of expenses.\r\n\r\n_Committees._--For convenience in legislation the members of each house\r\nare grouped into committees, the more important of which are those on\r\nagriculture, corporations, finance or appropriations, ways and means,\r\njudiciary, railroads, labor, education, manufactures, engrossment and\r\nenrollment, and insurance. In the Western states there are usually\r\ncommittees on immigration, mining, dairies, forestry, fish and game,\r\ndrainage, swamp lands, irrigation, levees and river improvements, etc.\r\nThe number and size of the committees vary in different states. In some\r\nof the states there are as many as fifty or sixty committees, and\r\noccasionally as many as forty members are placed on a single committee.\r\nIn addition to the standing committees of each house there are\r\nfrequently select committees appointed for special purposes, and there\r\nare usually a number of joint committees made up of members of both\r\nhouses. In the New England states most of the committee work is done by\r\njoint committees, there being usually only four or five standing\r\ncommittees in each house.\r\n\r\n=How Bills are Passed.=--Each house is empowered to frame its own rules\r\nof procedure, but in order to insure publicity and careful consideration\r\nof bills the state constitutions have placed restrictions upon the\r\nlegislature in the consideration and passage of bills. Thus in all the\r\nstates each house is required to keep a journal of its daily\r\nproceedings; in most states it is provided that no law shall be passed\r\nexcept by bill, that no bill shall embrace more than one subject, which\r\nshall be clearly expressed in the title of the bill, that no money shall\r\nbe appropriated except by law, that every bill shall be read at least\r\nthree times before being passed, that no existing law shall be amended\r\nby mere reference to its title but the amended portion must be set out\r\nin full, and that the yeas and nays shall be recorded upon demand of a\r\ncertain number of members. Some states require that every bill shall be\r\nreferred to a committee, that every bill shall be printed and placed on\r\nthe desk of each member, that no bill shall be introduced after the\r\nlegislature has been in session a certain number of days, and that bills\r\nof a local or private character shall be introduced only after public\r\nnotice has been given in the locality affected and to be valid must be\r\npassed by a two-thirds majority of each house; and so on.\r\n\r\nIn general these constitutional restrictions represent an attempt to\r\neliminate the evils of undue haste, lack of consideration,\r\nextravagance, and objectionable local and private bills, and to compel\r\nthe legislature to do its work openly, carefully, and in the interest of\r\nthe public good.\r\n\r\n_Order of Procedure._--A common order of the procedure in passing bills\r\nis the following: 1. Introduction and first reading. 2. Reference to a\r\ncommittee. 3. Report of the committee. 4. Second reading. 5. Third\r\nreading. 6. Vote on passage. 7. Enrollment. 8. Approval by the Governor.\r\nThis order of procedure, however, is often departed from under a\r\nsuspension of the rules or by unanimous consent.\r\n\r\nUsually any member can introduce a bill on any subject and at any\r\ntime[12] except where the constitution forbids the introduction of bills\r\nafter a certain date, and some legislatures have even found a means of\r\nevading this restriction. In most states a bill can be introduced by\r\nfiling it with the clerk. It is then usually read the first time, though\r\nonly by title, and referred to the appropriate committee for\r\nconsideration and report. The committee may \"pigeonhole\" it and never\r\nreport, or it may make a report so late in the session that\r\nconsideration of the bill is impossible. If the bill seems worthy of\r\nbeing reported, the committee reports it to the house with a\r\nrecommendation that it be passed either with or without amendments, or\r\nthat it be rejected. If reported favorably it is placed on the calendar\r\nfor consideration in its turn. At this stage it is open for general\r\ndiscussion and for amendment by the house. If the bill meets the\r\napproval of the house, it is finally ordered to be engrossed and read a\r\nthird time. It is then put in shape by the committee on engrossment,\r\nafter which it is read a third time and finally passed. It then goes to\r\nthe other house, where the procedure is substantially the same. If\r\npassed by the second house, it is ready for the signature of the\r\ngovernor. If amended by the second house, it comes back to the first\r\nhouse for concurrence in the amendments. If the first house refuses its\r\nconcurrence, a conference committee is usually appointed by the two\r\nhouses to consider and recommend a compromise. The bill is not ready to\r\nsend to the governor until it has been passed by both houses in exactly\r\nthe same form.\r\n\r\n    [12] In Wisconsin and some other states, \"legislative reference\r\n    bureaus\" furnish members with information regarding subjects of\r\n    proposed legislation, and aid them in the drafting of bills.\r\n\r\n=Lobbying and Bribery.=--In all our states a large proportion of the\r\nlegislation enacted affects directly or indirectly the interests of\r\nparticular persons, classes, or localities. As a result, interested\r\nparties bring great pressure to bear upon the members to pass certain\r\nbills or to reject certain others.\r\n\r\n_Methods of the Lobbyist._--Usually when the legislature meets, the paid\r\nrepresentatives of interested individuals, corporations, or local\r\ngovernments appear on the scene to urge legislation in their interests\r\nor to defeat bills introduced that are unfavorable to them. These\r\npersons are known as \"lobbyists,\" and the means they employ to secure or\r\nprevent legislation are often improper and sometimes venal. Sometimes\r\nmoney is used to bribe members to vote for or against pending measures,\r\nand there are few states indeed where charges of this kind have not been\r\nmade. In one state recently, money was contributed in large quantities\r\nby persons interested in preventing certain legislation, and the sum\r\nthus contributed was known as the \"jack pot\" fund, out of which members\r\nwere handsomely paid for their votes. In a special message to the\r\nlegislature of New York state, Governor Hughes declared that certain\r\ndisclosures had \"caused honest citizens to tingle with shame and\r\nindignation and made irresistible the demand that every proper means\r\nshould be employed to purge and purify the legislature.\" The situation\r\ndescribed by the governor as existing in New York, unfortunately exists\r\nin other states as well.\r\n\r\n_\"Strike\" Bills._--Some of the great corporations maintain regularly\r\npaid lobbyists at the state capitals when the legislature is in session,\r\nnot so much for the purpose of securing legislation in their interests\r\nas to prevent the enactment of laws to which they are opposed. Sometimes\r\nthey are practically forced to have lobbyists on the ground to prevent\r\nthe enactment of what are called \"strike\" bills, that is, bills\r\nintroduced by unscrupulous members for the purpose of extorting money\r\nfrom the corporations to pay for defeating them.\r\n\r\n_Anti-lobbying Legislation._--The evils growing out of the practice of\r\nthe special interests in maintaining paid lobbyists near the legislature\r\nhave led to attempts in a number of states to restrict such abuses by\r\nlegislation. This legislation, in general, makes it unlawful to attempt\r\nto influence improperly any legislator. In several states lobbyists are\r\nrequired to make known the purpose of their business and to register\r\ntheir names with the secretary of state, and after the adjournment of\r\nthe legislature to file a sworn statement of their expenses.\r\n\r\n=Direct Legislation: the Initiative and the Referendum.=--The\r\nlegislature is not the only agency for enacting law and determining the\r\npublic policies of the state. Laws on certain subjects may be made by\r\nthe people themselves acting directly in their primary capacity as well\r\nas through the agency of representatives. This is done through what are\r\ncalled the initiative and the referendum. The initiative is a device by\r\nwhich the people themselves may propose laws and have them submitted to\r\nthe voters for their approval or rejection. Through the referendum the\r\npeople reserve the power to approve or reject by popular vote certain\r\nlaws enacted by the legislature.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of Referendum._--The referendum may be obligatory or optional\r\nin character, that is, the approval of the electorate may be required by\r\nthe constitution before certain laws shall go into effect, or the\r\nlegislature in its discretion may refer a law to the people for their\r\nopinion. Thus the constitutions of many states declare that no law for\r\nincreasing the debt of the state beyond a certain amount shall be valid\r\nuntil it has been submitted to the voters and approved by them. Again,\r\nthe referendum may be mandatory or advisory in character. Under the\r\nmandatory form, the legislature is required to carry out the will of the\r\nelectorate as pronounced on any subject referred to the voters, while\r\nthe advisory referendum is nothing more than an expression of opinion\r\nwhich may or may not be followed by legislative action.\r\n\r\nAgain, the referendum may be state-wide in its scope, as where a general\r\nlaw or question of public policy is submitted to the voters of the whole\r\nstate, or it may be of a local character, as where a law affecting a\r\nparticular community is referred to the voters thereof.\r\n\r\nThe referendum as a device for adopting constitutions and constitutional\r\namendments is as old as the republic itself, and is now the general\r\npractice (pp. 65, 70). In all the states except Delaware proposed\r\namendments must be submitted to the voters at a general or special\r\nelection, and must be adopted by them before going into effect. The use\r\nof the referendum for ordinary lawmaking is also an old practice, though\r\nit is much more generally resorted to now than formerly. Thus very early\r\nin our history it was employed for such purposes as the incorporation of\r\ntowns, borrowing money, the location of county sites, division of\r\ncounties, subscription to stock in railroads and other enterprises by\r\nstates, counties, or towns, and the levying of special taxes for the\r\nsupport of schools. One of the important uses to which it was put was\r\nthe determination of the question whether intoxicating liquor should be\r\nsold in a particular locality. In time what were called local option\r\nlaws were passed in many states, giving the people of towns, cities, or\r\nother local divisions of the state the privilege of determining by\r\npopular vote whether liquor should be sold within their limits. Other\r\nmatters that have frequently been made the subject of a referendum are:\r\nthe granting of the suffrage to negroes, and sometimes the\r\nenfranchisement of women; the location of state capitals; the sale of\r\nschool lands; the incorporation of state banks of issue; the granting of\r\naid to railroads; the adoption of the township form of local government;\r\nthe construction of canals; the erection of public libraries; and many\r\nother matters too numerous to mention. There is no state in which the\r\nreferendum is not provided by the constitution for certain kinds of\r\nlegislation, and there is hardly a general election held nowadays in\r\nwhich the voters are not called upon to pass judgment upon some proposed\r\nact of the legislature or some question of public policy.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois there has been enacted what is known as the \"public opinion\r\nlaw,\" which provides that upon petition by 10 per cent of the registered\r\nvoters of the state the legislature is required to submit to the voters\r\nany question of public policy for their opinion. The popular vote,\r\nhowever, is nothing more than an expression of opinion by the voters and\r\nis not binding upon the legislature.\r\n\r\n_The Oregon System._--The idea of the initiative and the referendum has\r\nbeen carried out most fully in Oregon, whose constitution provides that\r\n8 per cent of the voters may by petition propose an amendment to the\r\nconstitution, and when so proposed it must be submitted to the voters\r\nand if approved by a majority of them the amendment becomes a part of\r\nthe constitution. Likewise the constitution of Oregon provides for the\r\ninitiation and adoption of ordinary laws by the people. It further\r\nprovides that upon the petition of 5 per cent of the voters any act of\r\nthe legislature, with certain exceptions, before going into effect, must\r\nbe submitted to the people for their approval, and if not approved by a\r\nmajority of those voting, it shall not go into effect. From 1904 to\r\n1914, 130 constitutional amendments and statutes were submitted to\r\npopular vote, of which 46 were adopted. For the information of the\r\nvoters, \"publicity pamphlets\" are provided, containing an explanation of\r\nthe measures upon which they are called to vote, together with arguments\r\nfor and against each proposition. In 1912 these arguments (on 37\r\nmeasures) made a book of 252 pages.\r\n\r\n_Initiative and Referendum in other States._--Various other states\r\n(South Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Missouri, Maine,\r\nArkansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Nevada, California, Washington,\r\nMichigan, Ohio, North Dakota, Massachusetts, and Mississippi) have\r\nestablished both the initiative and the referendum in some form or\r\nother. The initiative and referendum are in use also in many cities,\r\nespecially those under the commission plan of government. Usually the\r\nnumber who are empowered to initiate a proposed law or ordinance is 8 or\r\n10 per cent of the registered vote. In Texas the referendum is applied\r\nto the formulation by political parties of their party policies, 10 per\r\ncent of the voters being allowed to propose policies which must be\r\nsubmitted to the party for their opinion.\r\n\r\n_Merits of the Referendum._--One of the chief merits of the referendum\r\nis that it serves as a check on the vices, follies, and errors of\r\njudgment of the legislature. Another merit claimed for the referendum is\r\nits educative effect upon the electorate. Where the voters are\r\nfrequently called upon to pass judgment upon the acts of the legislature\r\nor upon questions of public policy, they must, if they discharge their\r\nduty properly, study the measures submitted to them and thus become\r\ntrained in public affairs. The enjoyment of such a privilege also tends\r\nto stimulate their interest in political affairs and increase their\r\nfeeling of responsibility for the good government of the state.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the initiative is that it puts in the hands of the\r\npeople the power to bring forward needed measures of legislation and\r\nsecure a vote on them whenever the legislature refuses to act in\r\nobedience to the popular mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. xxv.\r\n     BRYCE, The American Commonwealth (abridged edition), ch. xxxix.\r\n     DEALEY, Our State Constitutions, ch. vii.

Is there any organization in your state for studying the records of\r\nmembers and for securing the election of honest and efficient\r\nlegislators?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE STATE EXECUTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Governor; Election and Qualifications.=--Each state has a chief\r\nexecutive styled a governor, who is charged with the execution of the\r\nlaws. In all he is elected by the people. In nearly all, a plurality of\r\nthe popular vote is sufficient to elect, but in a few states a majority\r\nis required and if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote,\r\neither the legislature makes the choice, or a second popular election is\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nTo be eligible to the office of governor, a man must have attained a\r\ncertain age, usually thirty years, and generally he must be a citizen of\r\nthe United States; in many states he must have been a citizen for a\r\nperiod ranging from five to twenty years. He is also usually required to\r\nhave been a resident of the state for a period ranging from one to ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n=Term.=--The term of the governor in twenty-five states is two years; in\r\nthe others it is four years except in New Jersey, where it is three\r\nyears. Formerly the term was one year in several states, but by 1920 all\r\nof them had changed it to two years. A one-year term seems to have\r\nlittle to recommend it, for experience is as necessary for the\r\nsuccessful administration of public affairs as for the conduct of\r\nprivate business, and familiarity with the duties of an office of such\r\nimportance cannot be acquired in so short a time. However, where the\r\none-year term prevailed, it was customary to reëlect the governor to a\r\nsecond term. In a number of states, the governor is ineligible to two\r\nsuccessive terms, the idea being that if reëligible he would make use of\r\nhis official power to secure his reëlection. A few state constitutions\r\nwisely provide that he may hold office until his successor has\r\nqualified, and thus the danger of a vacancy is obviated.\r\n\r\n=Salary.=--The salary of the governor is everywhere comparatively small,\r\nthough in recent years the tendency has been to increase it. In three\r\nfourths of the states now the salary is $5,000 per year or more. In\r\nCalifornia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania,\r\nit is $10,000 per year, and in Illinois it is $12,000. The smallest\r\nsalary is $2,500 per year, which is the amount allowed in Nebraska.\r\nFrequently the state provides the governor with a residence styled the\r\n\"executive mansion.\" A contingent fund out of which to meet the expense\r\nof emergencies in the execution of laws is usually placed at his\r\ndisposal, but this fund cannot be used for private purposes. Some\r\ngovernors, however, have not been very careful to distinguish between\r\nprivate and official purposes, and not infrequently the use made of this\r\nfund has been the subject of legislative investigation and of popular\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n=Organization of the Executive Department.=--The organization of the\r\nexecutive department of the state government is different in one\r\nimportant respect from that of the executive department of the United\r\nStates. In the national government the responsibility for the\r\nadministration of executive affairs is concentrated in the hands of the\r\nPresident, and the heads of the various departments are all his\r\nappointees; they are responsible directly to him for the discharge of\r\ntheir duties, are, within the limits of the law, subject to his\r\ndirection, and may be removed by him for any reason which to him may\r\nseem expedient. The executive power of the state, on the contrary,\r\ninstead of being concentrated in the hands of the governor, is really\r\ndivided between him and a number of other state officers, who are\r\ngenerally elected by the people and over whom he has little or no\r\ncontrol. They are, in short, his colleagues rather than his\r\nsubordinates. This method of organizing the executive power has justly\r\nbeen criticized on the ground that it introduces a division of\r\nresponsibility and lack of co-ordination in the state administration.\r\nThus, although the governor is charged with the execution of the laws,\r\nhe usually has no power to direct the attorney-general to institute\r\nproceedings against a person or corporation for violating the law, as\r\nthe President of the United States might do in a similar case. Again, he\r\nmay have reason to believe that the state treasurer is a defaulter, but\r\nin most of the states he has no power to examine into the affairs of the\r\ntreasurer's office, or to remove him from office. And so with the other\r\nprincipal officers that collectively make up the executive department.\r\nThe responsibility of these officials is usually to the people alone,\r\nand responsibility in such cases cannot always be enforced, for they are\r\nelected for specific terms and cannot be removed before the expiration\r\nof their terms, except by the cumbersome method of impeachment.\r\n\r\n_The Lieutenant Governor._--In about two thirds of the states there are\r\nlieutenant governors chosen for the same time and in the same manner as\r\nthe governor. About the only duty of this official is to preside over\r\nthe deliberations of the senate. In case of a vacancy in the office of\r\ngovernor on account of death, resignation, or removal, or in case of his\r\nabsence from the state, the lieutenant governor performs the duties of\r\nthe office for the time being.\r\n\r\n_Executive Councils._--Three of the New England states (Massachusetts,\r\nMaine, and New Hampshire) have executive councils--survivals of\r\ncolonial days--which share the executive power with the governor to a\r\nconsiderable extent. Their consent is necessary to the validity of many\r\nof his acts, such as the making of appointments, the granting of\r\npardons, and the like. A modified form of the executive council is found\r\nin a few other states.\r\n\r\n=Other Executive Officers.=--Besides the governor, who is the chief\r\nexecutive, there are in every state a number of state officers each in\r\ncharge of a particular branch of the administrative service.\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State._--The first of these in rank is the secretary of\r\nstate, who is the custodian of the state archives and of the great seal\r\nof the state; has charge of the publication and preservation of the\r\nlaws; countersigns the proclamations and commissions issued by the\r\ngovernor and keeps a record of them; issues certificates of\r\nincorporation to companies incorporated under the laws of the state; and\r\ndischarges other miscellaneous duties which vary in the different\r\nstates. He is elected by the people in all the states except a very few\r\nwhere he is either appointed by the governor or chosen by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n_The Treasurer_ of the state, as the name indicates, is the keeper of\r\nthe public moneys, such as taxes, trust funds, and the like, and upon\r\nwarrants issued by the auditor or other proper authority, he pays out\r\nmoney appropriated by the legislature. Everywhere he is elected by the\r\npeople, usually for a short term, and is required to give a heavy bond\r\nso as to insure the state against loss in case of his carelessness or\r\ndishonesty. He is generally paid a salary, which is increased in some\r\ncases by the practice of treasurers depositing the state's money in\r\nbanks from which they receive interest. The treasurer of a certain\r\nWestern state received thousands of dollars a year in this way, until\r\nthe legislature passed a law requiring him to turn into the state\r\ntreasury all moneys received in the form of interest on state deposits.\r\n\r\n_Auditor._--Another financial officer found in all the states is the\r\nauditor or comptroller, whose duties, in general, are to audit the\r\naccounts of the state and issue warrants upon the treasurer for the\r\npayment of moneys which have been appropriated by the legislature. A\r\nwarrant issued by the auditor is the treasurer's authority for paying\r\nmoney out of the treasury, and without such an order he has no lawful\r\nright to make a disbursement. Other duties of a miscellaneous character\r\nare imposed upon auditors in the different states.\r\n\r\n_Superintendent of Education._--Another important official is the\r\nsuperintendent or commissioner of public education, who has charge of\r\nthe larger educational interests of the state. He supervises the\r\nadministration of the school laws, distributes the school fund among the\r\nlocal districts, makes rules and regulations in regard to the holding of\r\nteachers' institutes, makes reports to the legislature concerning the\r\neducational conditions and needs of the state, and is frequently a\r\nmember of the state board of education and of the boards of trustees of\r\nthe state educational institutions.\r\n\r\n_Other Officers._--Besides the officials mentioned above, there are a\r\nmultitude of other officers and employees in the larger states, such as\r\nthe commissioner of agriculture, the commissioner of immigration, the\r\ncommissioner of labor, state engineer, railroad commissioners,\r\nsuperintendent of public works, state printer, factory inspectors, pure\r\nfood and dairy commissioners, state architect, land commissioner, mine\r\ninspectors, superintendents of insurance, and many others too numerous\r\nto mention. Of course, not every state has all these, but some of the\r\nmore populous ones such as New York and Massachusetts have most of them\r\nand others in addition.\r\n\r\n=The Governor's Powers.=--The powers and duties of governor may be\r\nroughly grouped into four classes: (1) his share in the making of the\r\nlaws; (2) his power to execute the laws and administer the affairs of\r\ngovernment; (3) his military power; and (4) his power to grant pardons\r\nfor violations of the laws.\r\n\r\n=Legislative Powers.=--_Power to Call Extra Sessions._--Everywhere he is\r\nempowered to call the legislature together in extraordinary session. He\r\nuses this power in case of emergencies, and also to secure the enactment\r\nof needed legislation which has been overlooked or neglected by the\r\nlegislature at the regular session. In New York recently, when the\r\nlegislature adjourned without enacting a promised law against race track\r\ngambling, the legislature was summoned in extraordinary session and\r\nexecutive pressure and public opinion were brought to bear upon it to\r\ncompel the enactment of the law. Sometimes a great catastrophe occurs\r\nwhen the legislature is not in session; for example, the California\r\nearthquake, the Cherry mine disaster in Illinois, and the Galveston\r\nstorm, each of which required the immediate attention of the\r\nlegislature. In order to prevent the legislature when in extraordinary\r\nsession from taking action for which there is really no need, the\r\nconstitutions of most states forbid it to consider any subjects not\r\nsubmitted to it by the governor; and in some states the length of an\r\nextra session is limited to thirty or sixty days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LABORATORY FOR TESTING FOODS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAD MAKING, VIRGINIA]\r\n\r\n_The Executive Message._--The governor is generally required to give the\r\nlegislature information concerning the affairs of the state and to\r\nrecommend the enactment of such laws as in his judgment the public good\r\nrequires, the idea being that he is more familiar than any one else with\r\nthe defects of the existing laws and with the legislative needs of\r\nthe state. This information, with the accompanying recommendations, is\r\ncommunicated to the legislature in a message at the beginning of the\r\nsession,[13] and is often followed by special messages from time to time\r\nrecommending consideration of particular matters that may arise in the\r\ncourse of the session. The weight which the recommendations of the\r\ngovernor have with the legislature depends, of course, upon his\r\ninfluence with the members and his standing with the people. If he\r\nbelongs to the same political party which is in control of the\r\nlegislature, and the party is not divided, or if he is especially\r\naggressive and is backed by a strong public opinion throughout the\r\nstate, his recommendations carry more weight than they would under\r\nopposite conditions.\r\n\r\n    [13] The constitution of Illinois requires the governor to transmit a\r\n    message to the legislature also at the end of his term, summing up the\r\n    condition of affairs of the state at the time.\r\n\r\n_The Veto Power._--Finally, in every state except North Carolina the\r\ngovernor has the power to veto bills passed by the legislature. Owing to\r\nfear of executive tyranny, the veto power was generally withheld from\r\ngovernors for a considerable time after the Revolution; in fact, in only\r\ntwo states (Massachusetts and New Hampshire) was this power granted to\r\nthe governor before the close of the eighteenth century. The worst fears\r\nof executive tyranny, however, proved to be without foundation, and the\r\nadvantage of vesting in the hands of the governor the power to correct\r\nthe mistakes of the legislature by refusing to approve objectionable\r\nlaws soon came to be generally appreciated. Under the interpretation of\r\nthe veto power the governor may refuse to sign a bill either because, in\r\nhis judgment, it is inconsistent with the constitution which he has\r\nsworn to support, or because he thinks it unwise or inexpedient, in\r\neither case his judgment being conclusive. But manifestly, an absolute\r\nveto is too great a power to intrust to a single person, however wise he\r\nmay be. The constitutions of all the states, accordingly, empower the\r\nlegislature to override the veto of the governor by repassing the vetoed\r\nbill, in which case it goes into effect notwithstanding the executive\r\nobjection. To do this, however, a majority of two thirds or three fifths\r\nof the members of the legislature is usually necessary, the idea being\r\nthat the judgment of so large a proportion of the legislature ought to\r\nbe allowed to prevail over that of the governor in case of a difference\r\nof opinion. In the few remaining states a bare majority of the members\r\nof the legislature may override the executive veto, though not\r\ninfrequently the statement of objections by the governor in his veto\r\nmessage serves to convince some of those who voted for the vetoed bill\r\nthat it is unwise, and thus the veto will be sustained. When a bill is\r\npresented to the governor for his signature he is allowed a period\r\nranging from three to ten days in which to consider it before taking\r\naction. A subject of criticism in some states is the practice of the\r\nlegislature of delaying final action on many bills until the last days\r\nof the session and then sending them all at once to the governor so that\r\nthe time allowed him for considering their merits is necessarily too\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nA wise provision found in the constitutions of about thirty states is\r\none which allows the governor to veto particular items in appropriation\r\nbills. Thus if the legislature passes a bill carrying appropriations for\r\na variety of objects, some worthy and others objectionable, the governor\r\nis not under the necessity of approving or rejecting the bill as a\r\nwhole, but may approve the desirable portions and veto the others. In\r\nthis way wasteful and objectionable appropriations of the public funds\r\nmay be prevented without inconvenience. In a few states the governor may\r\nalso veto particular sections of other bills.\r\n\r\n=Executive and Administrative Powers of the Governor.=--The governor is\r\ngenerally charged by the constitution with taking care that the laws are\r\nfaithfully executed, though, as already stated, the executive power is\r\nreally divided between him and a number of colleagues.\r\n\r\n_Power over State Officers._--He generally has a certain power of\r\noversight over the other principal state officers, but little power of\r\ncontrol over them. There is a tendency, however, to enlarge his power in\r\nthis respect.[14] Several constitutions, for example, empower him to\r\nrequire reports from the principal officers, and in some states he is\r\ngiven the right to examine into the condition of the treasurer's and\r\ncomptroller's offices and under certain conditions to remove the\r\nincumbent from office. In a very few states, also, the governor may\r\nremove sheriffs or mayors for negligence or abuse of power in the\r\nenforcement of the state laws.\r\n\r\n    [14] By an important act passed in Illinois in 1917 a large number\r\n    of bureaus and commissions were consolidated and placed under the\r\n    authority of departmental heads appointed by the governor, who has\r\n    a large power of control over them. A number of other states have\r\n    since done likewise.\r\n\r\n_Power of Appointment._--The governor's principal executive power\r\nconsists of the right to appoint certain officers and boards, and\r\nsometimes to remove them, subject to certain restrictions. In the early\r\ndays of our history, many of the state officers were chosen by the\r\nlegislature, but with the growth of the democratic spirit the selection\r\nof these officials was taken from the legislature and they were made\r\nelective by the people. In a very few states the legislature still\r\nretains a considerable power of appointment. In most states, however,\r\nthe governor appoints all officers not elected by the people. In a few\r\nstates he appoints the judges; in half a dozen or more he appoints\r\nseveral of the principal state officers, such as the secretary of state\r\nand the attorney-general, and in most of them he appoints some of the\r\nimportant administrative officers and the members of various boards and\r\ncommissions. In New York, for example, he appoints the superintendent of\r\ninsurance and banking, the members of the two public service\r\ncommissions, the superintendent of public works, the commissioner of\r\nagriculture, the commissioner of health, and other important officials.\r\nIn some states he appoints the railroad commissioners, the trustees of\r\npublic institutions, members of the state board of health, the members\r\nof various examining boards, pure food commissioners, factory\r\ninspectors, game commissioners, mining inspectors, and so on. As\r\ncompared with the President of the United States, his power of\r\nappointment, however, is very small. Moreover, his power to appoint is\r\nusually limited by the condition that his nominations must be approved\r\nby the senate or the executive council where there is such a body.\r\n\r\n_Power of Removal._--The governor can usually remove the officials whom\r\nhe appoints, but rarely any others. But the power of removal must exist\r\nsomewhere, because it would be intolerable to have to retain in the\r\npublic service men who are dishonest, incapable, or otherwise unfit. The\r\nother methods of removal provided are impeachment, removal by resolution\r\nof the legislature, and occasionally removal by the courts. Removal by\r\nimpeachment takes place by the preferment of a charge by the lower house\r\nof the legislature and trial by the upper house. This method, however,\r\nis cumbersome and is rarely resorted to--never in the case of minor\r\nofficials. Removal by resolution of the legislature is sometimes\r\nemployed for getting rid of unfit or corrupt judges. In several states,\r\nthe method of recall has been instituted, by which, on petition of 25\r\nper cent of the voters, the officer must submit his case to the voters,\r\nand if a majority of them pronounce in favor of his recall, he must\r\nretire.\r\n\r\n=The Military Powers of the Governor.=--In every state the governor is\r\ncommander in chief of the military forces of the state and also of the\r\nnaval forces where there are any--a power which means little in times of\r\npeace. Whenever there are riots or serious disturbances, however, this\r\npower becomes important. When the disturbance is too great to be\r\nsuppressed by the local authorities, the governor may order out a\r\nportion of the militia and may, if he elects, take charge of it himself.\r\nThere are few states where the governor has not at some time or another\r\nbeen compelled to make use of this power. Mobs sometimes break into\r\njails and take out prisoners and lynch them; and sometimes strike riots\r\noccur in mining or manufacturing communities, in which cases the\r\ngovernor may be called upon to send troops to the scene of the\r\ndisturbance and keep them there until quiet and order have been\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n_Power to Suspend the Writ of Habeas Corpus._--A usual part of the\r\ngovernor's military power is the right to suspend the writ of habeas\r\ncorpus in communities where great disorders prevail, that is, to suspend\r\nthe power of the courts to release prisoners charged with violations of\r\nthe law, thus leaving unhampered the power of the military authorities\r\nto restrain persons they may imprison. This power, however, is one which\r\nmight be grossly abused; therefore many state constitutions forbid the\r\nsuspension of the writ except under extraordinary conditions, and a\r\nfew, indeed, permit it to be suspended only by the legislature.\r\n\r\n_The Military Forces of the State_ consist usually of a number of\r\nregiments of citizen soldiers, who are organized, uniformed, and\r\nofficered after the manner of the regular army of the United States, who\r\nattend an annual encampment for purposes of drill and practice, and who\r\nmust always be ready to respond to the call of the governor. At the head\r\nof the state militia is an officer called the adjutant general, through\r\nwhom the military orders of the government are issued and carried out.\r\nThe governor also has a military staff which accompanies him on\r\noccasions of ceremony such as the inauguration of the President of the\r\nUnited States, grand army reviews, and the like.\r\n\r\n=The Pardoning Power.=--In every state the governor is vested with the\r\npower of pardoning offenders against the laws of the state, but in most\r\nstates the exercise of the power is subject to restrictions. The purpose\r\nof vesting this power in the governor is to make it possible to correct\r\nthe errors of courts and juries, as where subsequent to the conviction\r\nevidence is brought to light showing that the person convicted is\r\ninnocent, and has been wrongfully convicted, or where it becomes evident\r\nbefore the full penalty has been paid that the offender has been\r\nsufficiently punished and should be released.\r\n\r\nIn many states boards of pardon have been provided for sharing with the\r\ngovernor the responsibility for the exercise of this important\r\nprerogative.[15] These boards are of two kinds: first, those whose powers\r\nare limited to the hearing of applications for pardons and the making of\r\nrecommendations to the governor, who is not bound by their advice; and\r\nsecond, those whose approval is necessary for the validity of any pardon\r\ngranted by him. Convictions for treason and in impeachment cases are\r\nfrequently excepted from the list of cases in which the governor may\r\ngrant pardons, though in the case of treason he is sometimes given the\r\npower to suspend the execution of the sentence to await the action of\r\nthe legislature. In a number of states notice of an application for a\r\npardon must be published in the community where the applicant was\r\nconvicted, in order that the people of the community who have been\r\ninjured by his crime may have an opportunity to protest against the\r\ngranting of a pardon to him. Sometimes also the approval of the\r\npresiding judge of the court in which the criminal was convicted is\r\nnecessary before a pardon may be granted. It is usual to require the\r\ngovernor to make a report to the legislature at each session of all\r\npardons granted, and at the same time give the reason in each case why a\r\npardon was issued.\r\n\r\n    [15] In several states certain of the state officers, one of whom is\r\n    the attorney-general, serve as the pardon board; in others, it is the\r\n    senate; and in Massachusetts and Maine it is the executive council.\r\n\r\nGenerally with the right of pardon is included the power to grant\r\nreprieves, that is, stays of execution; commutations, that is, the\r\nsubstitution of a lesser punishment in the place of the one imposed; and\r\nremission of fines and forfeitures. The right also usually includes the\r\npower of amnesty or the power of granting by proclamation pardons to\r\nlarge numbers of persons, as in the case of uprisings or insurrections\r\nagainst the laws and authority of the state. A pardon may be absolute or\r\nconditional; in the first case, it is granted without restriction; in\r\nthe second case, it is valid only on certain conditions, as where the\r\noffender is required to lead an upright life or where he is required to\r\nleave the state. Generally the governor of the state, unlike the\r\nPresident of the United States, has no power to grant a pardon to an\r\nindividual offender before he has been convicted.\r\n\r\n=State Boards and Commissions.=--One of the remarkable political\r\ntendencies of recent years has been the multiplication of boards and\r\ncommissions to aid in the government of the states. Every state now has\r\na number of such boards, and in some of the populous commonwealths such\r\nas New York and Massachusetts there are upwards of a hundred of them.\r\nHardly a legislative session passes that does not create one or two\r\ncommissions for some purpose or other. These boards or commissions fall\r\nroughly into five classes, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, many of these boards are of an industrial character, such as\r\nboards of agriculture, food and dairy commissions, live stock, fish, and\r\nmining commissions, and the like. In general their purpose is to promote\r\nthe agricultural, mining, and industrial interests, generally, of the\r\nstate, through the collection and dissemination of information\r\nconcerning the best method of conducting those industries.\r\n\r\nA second class of boards are of a more distinctly scientific and\r\nresearch character, such as boards of health, bureaus of labor and\r\nstatistics, geological commissions, forestry boards, and the like.\r\nAlthough some of these, like the board of health, are charged with the\r\nexecution of certain laws, the general purpose of all of them is\r\nscientific research and the collection of data.\r\n\r\nA third class of boards are those charged primarily with the supervision\r\nof certain businesses or industries affecting the public interest, and\r\nwith the enforcement of the laws relating to such businesses. Such are\r\nthe railroad commissions, commissions of insurance, public utility\r\ncommissions, commissions of inland fisheries, and the like. In some\r\ninstances these commissions not only have power to prescribe rules for\r\nbusinesses affected with a public interest, but also to fix the rates\r\nwhich they may charge.\r\n\r\nA fourth group of commissions or boards are those charged with examining\r\napplicants for admission to practice certain professions or trades such\r\nas medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, architecture, and plumbing. The\r\npurpose of requiring such examinations is to secure a standard of\r\nefficiency, and to protect society against quacks.\r\n\r\nA fifth class includes those which have supervision over the public\r\ninstitutions of the state, educational, penal, reformatory, charitable,\r\netc. In recent years there has been a marked tendency to consolidate\r\nboards of this class, by putting all the charitable and penal\r\ninstitutions under the control of a single board, or under two boards,\r\none for charitable and the other for penal institutions. In a few states\r\nall the higher educational institutions are under one board.\r\n\r\nMembers of all these classes of boards are usually appointed by the\r\ngovernor, though occasionally a board is made up of members chosen by\r\npopular election.\r\n\r\n_State Administrative Reorganization._--In 1917 a more systematic\r\norganization of state administration was established in Illinois. Nine\r\nmain departments were established, each under a director, in place of a\r\nlarge number of former offices, boards, and commissions. Similar\r\nreorganizations have since taken place in a number of other states.\r\n\r\n=The State Civil Service System.=--The number of persons necessary to\r\ncarry on the state government in its various branches is very large. In\r\norder to provide a method by which subordinate employees can be selected\r\nwith regard to their fitness rather than with reference to their party\r\nservices, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Wisconsin, and other states\r\nhave enacted civil service laws establishing the merit system of\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nThe recent civil service laws provide, in general, for the\r\nclassification of all positions other than those filled by popular\r\nelection, by executive appointment, or by legislative choice, and for\r\nappointment to these positions only after an examination of the\r\ncandidates. Generally, those who pass the examination successfully are\r\nplaced on an eligible list in the order of the grades which they\r\nreceive, and when an office is to be filled, the appointing officer is\r\nrequired to make his choice from the three candidates highest on the\r\nlist. For the filling of certain positions requiring technical skill,\r\nspecial non-competitive examinations are given and less consideration is\r\ngiven to academic qualifications. Certain positions are not placed under\r\nthe civil service rules, and the appointing authority is allowed to make\r\nhis choice without the necessity of examinations. Such are the positions\r\nof private secretary, chief clerk, and other employees who occupy a\r\nconfidential relation to the heads of departments.\r\n\r\nThe chief advantage of the examination system of filling civil service\r\npositions is that it eliminates the evils of the spoils system and\r\nplaces the public service on a merit basis. It must be admitted,\r\nhowever, that the system is not perfect, because fitness for the\r\nperformance of administrative duties cannot always be determined by\r\nexaminations. Nevertheless, it is much better than the old method known\r\nas the \"spoils system,\" under which appointments were made for party\r\nservices; and it will in time, no doubt, be adopted in all the states.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. xxiv.\r\n     BRADFORD, Lessons of Popular Government, vol. ii, ch. 32.

What is the term of the governor of your state? the salary? Do you\r\nthink the salary is adequate? What are the governor's qualifications?\r\nCompare the provisions of the present constitution with those of\r\nprevious constitutions in regard to these matters. Is the governor\r\neligible to succeed himself? Is it customary to reëlect the governor in\r\nyour state? What, in your opinion, are the relative merits of a one-year\r\nterm and a four-year term for the governor?\r\n\r\n2. Suppose a question should arise as to who was really elected\r\ngovernor, what authority would determine the matter? Are there any\r\ncircumstances under which the legislature may elect the governor? Is the\r\ngovernor of your state required to vacate his office immediately at the\r\nexpiration of his term, or is he allowed to hold over until his\r\nsuccessor has qualified?\r\n\r\n3. Make a list of the names of the men who have held the office of\r\ngovernor of your state, indicating the years they served and the\r\npolitical parties to which they belonged. (This information can be\r\nobtained from the blue book or legislative manual or from some history\r\nof the state.)\r\n\r\n4. Does the constitution of your state provide for a lieutenant\r\ngovernor? In general, what has been the type of men elected to this\r\noffice?\r\n\r\n5. Make a list (from the blue book) of the offices in your state that\r\nare filled by appointment by the governor. Do you think the appointive\r\npower of the governor ought to be enlarged? Mention some offices now\r\nfilled by popular election which, in your opinion, should be filled by\r\nexecutive appointment.\r\n\r\n6. May the governor of your state remove officers appointed by him? If\r\nso, under what conditions? May he remove any officers elected by the\r\npeople? If he finds that the treasurer of the state has misappropriated\r\na large amount of state money, can he remove him? May the governor of\r\nthe state remove any local officers? Thus if the sheriff should allow a\r\nprisoner in his custody to be lynched by a mob or the mayor of a city\r\nshould refuse to execute a state prohibition law, may the governor\r\nsuspend or remove such officers for neglect of duty? If not, are there\r\nany means of punishing the negligent officer?\r\n\r\n7. What were the principal recommendations in the message of the\r\ngovernor to the legislature at its last session?\r\n\r\n8. May the governor of your state veto particular items in appropriation\r\nbills? May he sign a bill after the adjournment of the legislature? May\r\nhe veto a bill upon grounds of public policy as well as upon grounds of\r\nunconstitutionality? How many bills were vetoed by the governor at the\r\nlast session?\r\n\r\n9. Is there a civil service law in your state? If so, to what offices\r\nand employments does it apply? How are appointments made under the law?\r\n\r\n10. For what purposes and under what circumstances may the governor use\r\nthe military forces in your state? Have there been any instances\r\nrecently in which the militia was ordered out? What is meant by the\r\ngovernor's \"staff\"? Find out from the blue book how many regiments of\r\nthe national guard there are in your state.\r\n\r\n11. Are there any restrictions on the power of the governor to grant\r\npardons? May he also grant reprieves and commutations? May he remit\r\nfines and forfeitures? May he grant amnesties? Is there a pardon board\r\nin your state? If so, how is it constituted and what are its powers? How\r\nmany pardons have been granted by the present governor?\r\n\r\n12. May the courts control the governor by issuing writs to compel him\r\nto do his duty or to restrain him from doing certain things? May he be\r\narrested for wrongdoing? May he be compelled to give testimony in the\r\ncourts? If not, why not? Is there any way by which an unworthy governor\r\nmay be put out of office before the expiration of his term? Describe the\r\nprocedure by which this is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE STATE JUDICIARY\r\n\r\n\r\n=Function of the Courts.=--The legislature enacts the laws, the\r\nexecutive officers enforce them, the courts interpret their meaning\r\nand apply them to particular cases. The courts are also the\r\ninstrumentalities through which the rights guaranteed us by the\r\nconstitution and the laws are enforced. If your neighbor owes you a debt\r\nand refuses to pay, if you make a contract with some one and he refuses\r\nto perform the stipulations, if some one injures you in your person or\r\nproperty, in these and countless other instances you must look to the\r\ncourts for protection or redress. They are the agencies for settling\r\ndisputes among men, for enforcing contracts, for trying and punishing\r\nviolations of the law, and for determining what our rights are when they\r\nare drawn in dispute.\r\n\r\n=Grades of Courts.=--(1) _Justice of the Peace._--At the bottom of the\r\njudicial system stand the courts of the justices of the peace, which\r\nhave jurisdiction of civil cases involving small amounts, usually less\r\nthan $150, and of petty offenses against the laws. On a level with these\r\ncourts are certain municipal courts in the cities. The justice of the\r\npeace is a magistrate of ancient origin, and in reality his court is\r\nimportant since it is to this court that large numbers of persons resort\r\nfor the settlement of their disputes. Too little attention is given to\r\nthe choice of the men who fill this important office, and the result is\r\nthat the court of the justice of the peace has long been and still is\r\nthe weakest part of our judicial system. Generally there are several\r\njustices in every town or township. Usually they are elected by the\r\npeople, though sometimes they are appointed. One of the sources of the\r\nevils connected with the system is that they are paid fees rather than\r\nsalaries. This system of compensation often leads them to solicit\r\nbusiness and sometimes to divide their fees with lawyers who bring cases\r\nto them for trial. They not only try petty civil and criminal cases, but\r\nthey have the power to conduct preliminary examinations into more\r\nserious offenses in order to determine whether there is ground for\r\nholding the accused for trial. In case the justice thinks the evidence\r\nwarrants the trial of the offender, he \"binds\" him over to await the\r\naction of the grand jury.\r\n\r\n(2) _County Courts._--Next above the court of the justice of the peace\r\nis, in some states, the county court, so called because its territorial\r\njurisdiction embraces the entire county. This court has jurisdiction of\r\ncivil cases involving large amounts and of more serious criminal cases.\r\nIt also has the right to hear appeals from the justices of the peace.\r\n\r\n(3) _Circuit Courts._--Still higher in the judicial organization, in\r\nmost states, are the courts whose territorial jurisdiction embraces a\r\nlarger area of the state--usually a group of counties--and which are\r\nempowered to try any civil or criminal case without reference to the\r\namount in controversy or the character of the offense. They are\r\ngenerally styled circuit courts, because the judge usually travels from\r\ncounty to county holding court in each county in the district or\r\ncircuit. Sometimes, however, they are called district or superior\r\ncourts, and in a few states \"supreme\" courts.\r\n\r\n(4) _The Supreme Court._--Finally, at the top of the judicial hierarchy\r\nis the supreme court, or court of appeals, as it is sometimes called.\r\nUnlike the other courts below, its jurisdiction embraces the whole\r\nstate, and the judges are elected or appointed usually from the state at\r\nlarge. Unlike the other courts, moreover, instead of being held by a\r\nsingle judge, it is held by a bench of judges, the number ranging from\r\nthree to nine in the different states. It has original jurisdiction in\r\ncertain cases, but its most important function is that of hearing\r\nappeals from the decisions of the lower courts, and of deciding upon the\r\nconstitutionality of the laws. In cases appealed to it from the lower\r\ncourts, it has the final word of authority except where a federal\r\nquestion is involved, in which case an appeal may be taken to the United\r\nStates Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n=Courts of a Special Character.=--The justice's, circuit, and supreme\r\ncourts are found in all the states, though sometimes designated by\r\ndifferent names. In addition to these, however, we sometimes find other\r\ncourts of a more or less special character.\r\n\r\n_Probate Courts._--Thus in many states there are separate probate courts\r\nfor the settlement of the estates of deceased persons, for dealing with\r\nmatters relating to wills and inheritances, and sometimes with matters\r\naffecting orphans and minors. They are occasionally called surrogate's\r\nor orphans' courts. In many states, however, there are no separate\r\nprobate courts, the probate business being taken care of by the county\r\ncourt. In certain other states probate courts are separately provided\r\nonly for the more populous counties.\r\n\r\n_Juvenile Courts._--Frequently in the more populous cities there are\r\nalso juvenile courts for the trial of youthful offenders.\r\n\r\n_Equity Courts._--In a few states the distinction between law and equity\r\nis still maintained, and equity jurisdiction is intrusted to a distinct\r\nclass of courts. Equity had its origin in the practice of the King of\r\nEngland in early times in granting relief to suitors who, owing to the\r\ndeficiencies of the common law, could not obtain relief through the\r\ncourts of law. In time all such petitions came to be addressed to an\r\nofficer who stood very close to the king and who was called the\r\nchancellor. Out of this office there were ultimately evolved the\r\nchancery courts which administered justice, not according to the law,\r\nbut according to a less technical body of rules called equity. Thus\r\nthere came to be two bodies of rules according to which justice was\r\nadministered, and two classes of courts through which it was done. The\r\njurisdiction of equity courts included such matters as trusts, accounts,\r\nfraud, mistake or accident, and the like. Equity could also prevent\r\nwrongs, while law could only punish them.[16] Thus a court of equity\r\ncould command a person to do something for the benefit of an injured\r\nperson, or restrain him from committing an injury, while a court of law\r\ncould only award him damages after the injury had been done--a remedy\r\noften worthless or inadequate. The English system of equity, like the\r\ncommon law, was transplanted to America, and both are still in force\r\nhere except in so far as they have been modified by legislative acts.\r\nEngland, however, abolished the separate system of equity courts in\r\n1873, and left the law courts to administer equity wherever it was\r\napplicable. Likewise, in the United States, separate equity courts have\r\nbeen done away with in all except five states, leaving the same courts\r\nto administer both law and equity.\r\n\r\n    [16] Baldwin, The American Judiciary, p. 133.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Judges of Courts.=--_Qualifications._--Generally no qualifications\r\nfor the judicial office are prescribed by law, except in a few states\r\nwhere it is required that judges shall be lawyers or be \"learned in the\r\nlaw.\" As a matter of fact, however, judges are nearly always lawyers,\r\nexcept in the case of justices of the peace and police magistrates,\r\nwhere extensive knowledge of the law is not essential.\r\n\r\n_Terms of Office._--The terms of the judges vary widely among the\r\ndifferent states. In the early days of our history, the judges generally\r\nheld their offices during good behavior or until the attainment of a\r\ncertain age, usually sixty or seventy years. With the growth of\r\ndemocracy, however, most of the states came to adopt short terms for\r\njudicial as well as for other public officials. Only in Massachusetts\r\nand Rhode Island do the judges of the highest court now serve\r\npractically for life. In New Hampshire they serve until they are 70\r\nyears of age. Elsewhere the tenure varies from two years, in Vermont, to\r\ntwenty-one years, in Pennsylvania. In Maryland, the tenure is fifteen\r\nyears; in New York, fourteen; in several, it is twelve, in some nine, in\r\nmany six. The advantage of a long term is that it enables the judges to\r\nacquire experience and renders them less affected by political influence\r\nand popular clamor.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Choosing the Judges._--In early times the judges were chosen\r\neither by the legislature or by the governor. Choice by the legislature\r\nwas objectionable because it often resulted in selection by political\r\ncaucuses and in a parceling of the judgeships among the different\r\ncounties or sections of the state. Appointment by the governor was\r\nobjectionable to many because it often resulted in the choice of\r\npolitical favorites. Most of the states, therefore, abandoned these\r\nmethods of choice for popular election, Mississippi in 1832 being the\r\nfirst state to adopt this method. Only in Delaware, Connecticut, New\r\nJersey, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine, are the higher judges\r\nnow appointed by the governor,--subject to the confirmation of the state\r\nsenate or the legislature,--and only in Rhode Island, Vermont, South\r\nCarolina, and Virginia are they elected by the legislature. In all the\r\nother states they are elected by the people.\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favor of popular election are that it is more in\r\nharmony with the principles of popular government, and, it is claimed by\r\nsome, tends to secure a higher class of judges, thus doing away with the\r\nevils of executive appointment and of legislative choice described\r\nabove. The objection to this method, however, is that it compels\r\njudicial candidates to engage in political contests, and by making their\r\ntenures dependent upon popular favor subjects them to the temptation of\r\nshaping their decisions to meet the approval of the people, who,\r\nobviously, are not always qualified to judge of the soundness of\r\njudicial decisions involving intricate questions of law. Such a method,\r\nit is claimed by some, tends to secure the election of able politicians\r\nrather than of able judges.\r\n\r\n_Compensation of the Judges._--The pay of the judges, like their terms\r\nof service, varies widely among the different states. The salary paid\r\nthe judges of the highest court is not much more or less than the\r\ngovernor's salary. The highest salary paid in any state to the judges of\r\nthe highest court is $13,700 per year, in the state of New York,[17] a\r\nsalary about as large as that of the justices of the United States\r\nSupreme Court. In Illinois and a few other states, the justices of the\r\nsupreme court receive $10,000 a year. Many states pay less than $5,000 a\r\nyear. This scale of salaries is very low as compared with those in\r\nEngland, where the highest judges receive $25,000, and the lowest, the\r\ncounty judges, $7,500 a year. A few states have provided a system of\r\npensions for their higher judges who have served a certain number of\r\nyears or who have reached a certain age, after which they are allowed or\r\ncompelled to retire, but this provision has not yet become general.\r\n\r\n    [17] Trial court judges in certain districts receive $17,500 a year.\r\n\r\n=Trial of Civil Cases.=--The cases brought before the courts for trial\r\nare of two general classes: (1) civil actions and (2) criminal actions.\r\nA civil action is a suit brought for the enforcement of a private right\r\nor to secure compensation for damages on account of injuries sustained\r\nthrough the violation of one's rights. Thus a creditor sues a debtor for\r\nrefusing to pay a debt; an owner sues to recover property which has been\r\nwrongfully taken from him; a householder brings an action against his\r\nneighbor for trespassing upon his premises; and so on. The person who\r\nbrings the action is called the _plaintiff_; the one against whom it is\r\nbrought, the _defendant_; and the two together are known as the\r\n_parties_ to the action.\r\n\r\n_Beginning of a Civil Case._--A civil suit is usually started by the\r\nfiling of a complaint containing a statement of the facts, with the\r\ncourt, which then issues a summons directing the sheriff or constable to\r\nnotify the defendant to appear and make answer. If the plaintiff is a\r\ncreditor and has reason to believe that the defendant is preparing to\r\ndispose of his property with the intention of defrauding him, he may ask\r\nthe court to issue a _writ of attachment_ authorizing the sheriff to\r\ntake possession of the property. Or if the defendant is in wrongful\r\npossession of property belonging to the plaintiff the latter may ask the\r\ncourt to issue a _writ of replevin_ requiring the officers to seize the\r\nproperty and turn it over to the plaintiff. In both cases, however, the\r\nplaintiff is required to give a bond for the costs of the suit and for\r\nthe return of the property in case the court should decide that it does\r\nnot properly belong to him. The defendant now makes an answer or plea in\r\nwhich he denies the charges of the plaintiff as a whole or in part, or\r\nadmits their truth but denies the right of action, or maintains that the\r\ncourt has no jurisdiction, or pleads something else in bar of the\r\naction. The complaint of the plaintiff and the answer of the defendant\r\nare known as the _pleadings_.\r\n\r\n_The Trial._--The issue is now joined and the case is ready for trial.\r\nIf it is a suit in equity, it is tried by the judge alone without a\r\njury. If it is a suit at law, either party may demand a jury, but if\r\nboth parties agree to waive a jury trial, the case is tried by the judge\r\nalone. Frequently civil cases are tried without juries, the parties\r\npreferring to leave the decision to the judge. If, however, a jury trial\r\nis preferred, a list of qualified persons is prepared and from this list\r\ntwelve persons, or six, as the parties may agree upon, are selected to\r\ntry the case. After the jury is sworn the attorney for the plaintiff\r\ngenerally makes a statement of the facts upon which he rests his case.\r\nHe then calls his witnesses, who testify to their knowledge of the facts\r\nas they are questioned by counsel. When the attorney for the plaintiff\r\nhas completed the examination of each witness, the attorney for the\r\ndefendant is allowed to cross-examine him. Witnesses are required to\r\nconfine their testimony to what they know to be the truth, and are not\r\npermitted to tell what they believe to be true or what they have learned\r\nfrom mere hearsay.\r\n\r\nAfter the plaintiff has introduced all his evidence, the defendant's\r\ncase is presented in a like manner, the counsel for the plaintiff this\r\ntime conducting the cross-examination. When the evidence for the\r\ndefendant is all in, the plaintiff may introduce evidence in rebuttal,\r\nafter which the defendant may do likewise. The next step is the argument\r\nof counsel. The attorney for each side addresses the jury and endeavors\r\nto convince it that the evidence sustains the facts which he has\r\nundertaken to prove. The burden of proof in civil cases is usually on\r\nthe plaintiff, and his attorney generally has the privilege of closing\r\nthe argument. If the plaintiff has failed to make out a case the judge\r\nmay dismiss the suit without giving the case to the jury, or if the\r\nevidence is such as to admit of but one conclusion, the judge may direct\r\nthe jury to return a verdict in accordance therewith. But if the\r\nevidence leaves the question as to the facts in doubt, the case is given\r\nto the jury and it alone can make the decision. Before sending the jury\r\nto their room the judge instructs them as to the law applicable to the\r\ncase, but generally in this country he cannot comment on the weight of\r\nthe evidence or express any opinion as to the facts. The jury, after\r\nreceiving its instructions, retires from the court room and deliberates\r\nin secret. If, after a reasonable time, the jurymen cannot agree upon a\r\nverdict they so report to the judge and are discharged, and the trial\r\nmust be gone through with again.\r\n\r\n_Judgment; Execution_.--After the return of the verdict, the judge\r\nenters judgment in accordance therewith. In most civil cases the\r\njudgment, if for the plaintiff, requires the defendant to pay him a\r\ncertain sum of money as a compensation for the damages he has sustained.\r\nIf he refuses to pay, an \"execution\" is issued, that is, the sheriff is\r\nrequired to seize and sell a sufficient amount of the defendant's\r\nproperty to satisfy the judgment. If the suit is one in equity the\r\n\"decree,\" as the decision is called, is not usually for the payment of\r\ndamages but is a command to the defendant to do a specific thing, as,\r\nfor example, to carry out a contract or to pay a debt; or to refrain\r\nfrom doing something, such as maintaining a nuisance to the injury of\r\nthe defendant.\r\n\r\n_Appeal._--After the verdict has been rendered, the losing party may\r\ngenerally take an appeal to a higher court on the ground that errors\r\nwere committed by the judge in the course of the trial, as, for example,\r\nthe admission of improper evidence or the exclusion of proper evidence;\r\nor because the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence. The\r\nhigher court either affirms the judgment of the lower court or reverses\r\nit. If it affirms the judgment, it must then be carried out; if it\r\nreverses the judgment a new trial is granted and the whole procedure is\r\ngone through again.\r\n\r\n=Trial of Criminal Cases.=--Criminal actions, unlike civil actions, are\r\nbrought, not by the injured party, but by the state whose peace and\r\ndignity have been violated by the act complained of. The officer who\r\nbrings the action in the name of the state is called the _prosecuting\r\nattorney_, the _district attorney_, or the _state's attorney_. He\r\nconducts preliminary investigations into crimes and presents cases to\r\nthe grand jury for indictment. If the grand jury returns the indictment,\r\nthat is, decides that the accused shall be held for trial, the\r\nprosecuting officer takes charge of the case and conducts it for the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n_The Arrest._--Usually the first step in the trial of a person charged\r\nwith crime is to cause his arrest. The person injured, or any one else\r\nwho may have knowledge of the crime, appears before a magistrate and\r\nmakes a complaint setting forth the facts in regard to the crime. If the\r\nmagistrate is satisfied as to the truth of the complaint, he issues a\r\nwarrant commanding the sheriff or some other police officer to arrest\r\nthe accused. The warrant must particularly describe the offense, the\r\nplace where committed, and the circumstances under which it was\r\ncommitted, and must give the name of the person to be arrested. But in\r\nsome cases an arrest may be made without a warrant, as when an offender\r\nis seen committing a crime or when an officer has good reason to believe\r\nthat the person who is charged with committing a crime is the guilty\r\nperson. In practice, policemen frequently arrest on mere suspicion, and\r\nif they do so in good faith they will rarely be held liable for damages.\r\nAny private individual, as well as an officer, may arrest without\r\nwarrant a person whom he sees committing a crime. He may also arrest a\r\nperson whom he suspects of having committed a capital crime, although\r\nwithout personal knowledge of his guilt.[18]\r\n\r\n    [18] Baldwin, The American Judiciary, p. 227.\r\n\r\n_Commitment._--When arrested the accused is brought before a justice of\r\nthe peace and examined. If the justice of the peace, after such\r\nexamination, believes that the accused should be held for trial, he is\r\ncommitted to jail. If the offense is a minor one it can be tried by the\r\njustice of the peace. If it is a more serious crime the justice of the\r\npeace can hold the offender to await the action of the grand jury.\r\n\r\n_Habeas Corpus Proceedings._--If at any time it is alleged that a person\r\nis unlawfully deprived of his liberty, a judge may issue a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus and inquire into the case. In this way an accused person\r\nmay be set free if there is no sufficient reason for holding him.\r\n\r\n_Bail._--If the offense is not a capital one, the accused can secure his\r\nrelease from the jail while awaiting trial by giving bail. That is, he\r\ncan get one or more persons to obligate themselves to pay to the state a\r\ncertain sum of money should he fail to appear for the trial at the time\r\nset. Such persons are called sureties, and they have a certain power of\r\ncontrol over the accused as a means of insuring his appearance for the\r\ntrial. The constitutions of all the states allow the privilege of bail\r\nexcept in capital cases, and they all declare that the amount of bail\r\nrequired shall not be excessive, that is, shall not be more than is\r\nsufficient to insure the appearance of the accused for trial. What this\r\namount is must be determined by the judge according to his own\r\ndiscretion, due regard being paid to the gravity of the offense, the\r\nnature of the punishment, and the wealth of the defendant or his\r\nfriends. If the offender has been bound over to await the action of the\r\ngrand jury, the next step in the proceedings is the indictment.\r\n\r\n_The Grand Jury_ is one of the ancient institutions of the common law.\r\nThe number of persons constituting the grand jury was originally\r\ntwenty-three, but many of the states have changed this, a common number\r\nbeing fifteen. The grand jury is chosen by lot from a carefully prepared\r\nlist of persons in the county, qualified to serve. The members are sworn\r\nin on the first day of the term of court and are then \"charged\" by the\r\njudge to make a diligent inquiry into all cases of crime that have been\r\ncommitted in the county, and to return indictments against such persons\r\nas in their opinion should be held for trial. They then retire to their\r\nroom and conduct their investigations in secret.\r\n\r\n_The Indictment._--It must be remembered that the procedure of a grand\r\njury is not in the nature of a trial of the accused; it is only an\r\ninquiry to ascertain whether there is sufficient evidence of guilt to\r\nwarrant his being put on trial. In conducting this investigation, the\r\ngrand jury hears only one side of the case, that of the prosecution,\r\nneither the accused or his witnesses being heard. The prosecuting\r\nattorney attends the sessions of the grand jury and aids it in the\r\nconduct of its inquiries. He prepares the indictment and it is often\r\nupon his recommendation that the grand jury decides to indict or not to\r\nindict. In some states the procedure of indictment by grand jury for all\r\noffenses, or for all except the most serious ones, has been done away\r\nwith, the accusation taking the form of an \"information\" filed by the\r\nprosecuting attorney. One of the reasons given for abolishing the grand\r\njury is that it is often a source of delay since it can be called only\r\nwhen the court is in session, and in some communities the court is not\r\nin session for long periods in every year.\r\n\r\n_The Arraignment._--After the accused has been indicted the next step is\r\nto bring him before the court and arraign him. The charge is first read\r\nto him and he is directed to plead. If he pleads guilty, no further\r\naction is taken and the judge imposes the sentence. If he pleads not\r\nguilty, the trial proceeds. If he has no counsel to defend him, the\r\ncourt appoints some member of the local bar to act as his attorney, and\r\nthe lawyer so designated is under a professional obligation to undertake\r\nthe defense and do all in his power to clear him. In this way the\r\nmurderer of President McKinley was enabled to have the benefit of\r\ncounsel. Many writers on criminal law, indeed, contend that the state\r\nought to employ regular public defenders for accused persons just as it\r\nemploys public prosecutors, since it should be equally interested in\r\nseeing an innocent man acquitted as in seeing a guilty one convicted.[19]\r\n\r\n    [19] In several instances provision has recently been made for such an\r\n    officer; for example, in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n_Selection of the Jury._--The next step is the impaneling of a jury of\r\ntwelve persons to try the case. The law requires that the jury shall be\r\nselected from the community in which the offense was committed, in order\r\nthat the accused may have the benefit of any good reputation which he\r\nmay enjoy among his neighbors. The jury is chosen by lot from a list of\r\npersons qualified to perform jury service, and the jurymen are sworn to\r\nreturn a verdict according to the law and the evidence. Each side is\r\nallowed to \"challenge,\" that is, ask the court to reject, any juror who\r\nhas formed an opinion of the guilt or innocence of the accused or who is\r\nevidently prejudiced. In addition, each may reject a certain number of\r\njurors \"peremptorily,\" that is, without assigning a cause.\r\n\r\n_The Trial._--After the jury has been impaneled, the prosecuting\r\nattorney opens the trial by reciting the facts of the case and stating\r\nthe evidence upon which he expects to establish the guilt of the\r\naccused, for the law presumes the prisoner to be innocent, and the\r\nburden of proof to show the contrary rests upon the state. The procedure\r\nof examining and cross-examining the witnesses is substantially the same\r\nas in the trial of civil cases. There are well-established rules in\r\nregard to the admissibility of evidence and the weight to be attached to\r\nit, and if the judge commits an error in admitting improper evidence or\r\nin excluding evidence that should have been admitted in the interests of\r\nthe accused, the prisoner may, if convicted, have the verdict set aside\r\nby a higher court and a new trial granted him. One of the rules of\r\nprocedure is that the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt,\r\nfrom the evidence produced, that the accused is guilty.\r\n\r\n_Verdict; Sentence._--After being charged by the judge as to the law\r\napplicable to the case, the jury retire to a room where they are kept in\r\nclose confinement until they reach a unanimous verdict. If they cannot\r\nreach an agreement, they notify the judge, who, if satisfied that there\r\nis no longer any possibility of an agreement, discharges them; then the\r\naccused may be tried again before another jury. If a verdict of not\r\nguilty is returned, the court orders the prisoner to be set free; if a\r\nconviction is found, sentence is imposed and the punishment must be\r\ncarried out by the sheriff or some other officer. The usual punishment\r\nis fine, imprisonment in the county jail or state penitentiary, or\r\ndeath inflicted by hanging or electrocution. In a few states, notably\r\nMaine, Michigan, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, and Kansas, punishment by\r\ndeath has been abolished.\r\n\r\n_Probation; Reformation._--Imprisonment is generally for a specified\r\nperiod, though recently in a number of states the indeterminate sentence\r\nhas been provided, that is, the judge is allowed to sentence the\r\noffender for an indefinite period, the length of which will depend upon\r\nthe behavior of the prisoner and on the promise which he may show of\r\nleading a better life after being released. When thus released he may be\r\nplaced on probation and required to report from time to time to a\r\nprobation officer in order to show that his conduct is satisfactory. If\r\nunsatisfactory, he may be taken up and remanded to prison. The tendency\r\nnow in all enlightened countries is to adopt a system of punishment that\r\nwill not only serve as a deterrent to crime but at the same time help to\r\nreform the criminal and make a better citizen of him. The old idea that\r\nthe purpose of punishment was revenge or retribution has nearly\r\neverywhere disappeared, and in place of the severities of the old\r\ncriminal code we have introduced humane and modern methods which are\r\nprobably just as effective in deterring others from wrongdoing, and\r\nbesides conduce to the reformation of many unfortunate criminals.\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BALDWIN, The American Judiciary, chs. viii, xii,\r\n     xiv, xv, xvii, xxii.

The better opinion, as well as the\r\nalmost universal practice, is that suffrage is not at all a matter of\r\nright, but a privilege bestowed by the state upon those of its citizens\r\nwho are qualified to exercise it intelligently and for the public good.\r\nNo state allows all its citizens to vote; all the states restrict the\r\nprivilege to those who are at least twenty-one years of age; all confine\r\nthe privilege to those who are _bona fide_ residents of the community;\r\nand some require educational, property, and other qualifications of\r\nvarious kinds. On the other hand, eight states allow aliens who have\r\nformally declared their intention of becoming citizens, to vote equally\r\nwith citizens in all elections.[20] The terms \"voter\" and \"citizen,\"\r\ntherefore, are not identical or synonymous.\r\n\r\n    [20] These states are Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska,\r\n    Oregon, South Dakota, and Texas.\r\n\r\n=Existing Qualifications for Voting.=--In the early days of our history\r\nrestrictions on the voting privilege were much more numerous and\r\nstringent than now. Most of the early constitutions limited the\r\nprivilege to property owners, and some prescribed religious tests in\r\naddition. It is estimated that at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury not more than one person in twenty had the right to vote,\r\nwhereas now probably the proportion is two in five.\r\n\r\n_Federal Restriction._--In the United States the power to prescribe the\r\nqualifications for voting in both national and state elections belongs\r\nto the individual states, subject only to two provisions: in fixing the\r\nsuffrage they cannot abridge the privilege (1) on account of race,\r\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude, or (2) on account of sex. The\r\nfirst provision is found in the Fifteenth Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution, adopted in 1870, and its purpose was to prevent the states\r\nfrom denying the privilege of suffrage to negroes who by the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment, adopted in 1868, had been made citizens of the United States.\r\nThe second provision is in the Nineteenth Amendment adopted in 1920.\r\nThese provisions do not, however, prevent the states from limiting the\r\nprivilege on other grounds, such as illiteracy, criminality, vagrancy,\r\nnonpayment of taxes, and the like.\r\n\r\n_The Residence Requirement._--In the first place, all the states require\r\nresidence for a specified period in the state and in the election\r\ndistrict in which the voter exercises his privilege of voting. The\r\npurpose of this requirement is to confine the franchise to those who\r\nhave become identified with the interests of the community, and to\r\nexclude outsiders or newcomers who are unfamiliar with local conditions\r\nand unacquainted with the qualifications of the candidates. The required\r\nlength of residence in the state ranges from three months in Maine to\r\ntwo years in most of the Southern states, the more usual requirement\r\nbeing one year. The period of residence required in the county or\r\nelection district is shorter, the most common requirement being three\r\nmonths in the county and one month in the election district.\r\n\r\n_Educational Tests._--In addition to this requirement, nearly one third\r\nof the states insist upon some kind of educational test. Connecticut in\r\n1855 was the first state to require ability to read and write.\r\nMassachusetts followed her example shortly thereafter, and the precedent\r\nset by these two states was soon followed, with modifications, by\r\nCalifornia, Maine, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Washington.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, which indirectly\r\nconferred the right to vote on the negro race, and the unfortunate\r\nresults which followed the enfranchisement of the large mass of blacks\r\nin the South, led some of the Southern states to adopt educational and\r\nother restrictions to diminish the evils of an ignorant suffrage.\r\nMississippi in 1890 took the initiative, and required ability either to\r\nread the constitution of the state or to understand it when read by an\r\nelection officer. South Carolina followed her example in 1895, but with\r\nthe modification that an illiterate person who was the owner of at least\r\n$300 worth of property should not be disfranchised. Louisiana, Alabama,\r\nNorth Carolina, Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia followed with\r\nrestrictions based on similar principles. In several of these states,\r\nhowever, the educational qualification does not apply to those who were\r\nvoters in 1867 (when the negro race was still unenfranchised), or to\r\ntheir descendants, or to those who served in the army or navy during the\r\nCivil War. But in 1915 the Supreme Court of the United States decided,\r\nin the case of Oklahoma, that these so-called \"grandfather\" provisions\r\nwere unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n_Other Persons Excluded._--Most of the states deny the right to vote to\r\nconvicted criminals, idiots, and insane persons; some, particularly\r\nthose of the South, insist that the voter must have paid his taxes; some\r\nexclude vagrants, paupers, and inmates of public institutions.\r\n\r\n=Woman Suffrage.=--For a long time women everywhere were denied the\r\nright to vote, even long after their civil disabilities had been\r\nremoved. The principal arguments advanced by the opponents of woman\r\nsuffrage were: that active participation of women in political affairs\r\nwould tend to destroy their feminine qualities by forcing them into\r\npolitical campaigns, and thus causing them to neglect their children;\r\nthat it would tend to introduce discord into family life by setting\r\nhusband against wife on political issues; that since women are incapable\r\nof discharging all the obligations of citizenship, such as serving in\r\nthe army, militia, or police, they ought not to have all the privileges\r\nof citizenship; that a majority of the women did not desire the\r\nprivilege of voting; and that men could be trusted to care for the\r\ninterests of the whole family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOTER CASTING A BALLOT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMAN SUFFRAGE PARADE, WASHINGTON, D.C., MARCH 3, 1913]\r\n\r\n_Arguments in Favor of Woman Suffrage._--In favor of giving the ballot\r\nto women, it was argued that differences of sex do not constitute a\r\nlogical or rational ground for granting or withholding the suffrage if\r\nthe citizen is otherwise qualified; that women should be given the\r\nballot for their own self-protection against unjust class legislation;\r\nthat since millions of them had become wage earners and were competing\r\nwith men in nearly every trade and occupation and in many of the learned\r\nprofessions, the argument that the wage earner should have the ballot as\r\na means of defense applied equally to women as to men; that since the\r\nold civil disabilities to which they were formerly subject, such as the\r\ninability to own real estate, enter into contracts, and engage in\r\nlearned professions had been removed, it followed logically that their\r\npolitical disabilities should be removed also; and that since many of\r\nthem had become property owners and taxpayers it was unjust to permit\r\nthe shiftless nontaxpaying male citizen to take part in choosing public\r\nofficials and at the same time deny the right to women taxpayers.\r\nMoreover, it was argued that the admission of women to a share in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs would elevate the tone of politics and\r\nconduce to better government. Women are vitally interested in such\r\nmatters as taxation, education, sanitation, labor legislation, pure food\r\nlaws, and better housing conditions in the cities, and it was maintained\r\nthat in those states where they had been given the right to vote they\r\nhad been instrumental in securing wise legislation on many of these\r\nsubjects. Finally, it was argued, the fact that some women do not care\r\nfor the privilege is no reason why it should be denied to those who do\r\ndesire it.\r\n\r\n_The Enfranchisement of Women._.--These arguments in favor of suffrage\r\nfor women gradually made a strong appeal to the men and one state after\r\nanother conferred a limited suffrage on women citizens. At first they\r\nwere allowed to vote in school elections, or in municipal elections, or\r\non proposed bond issues (if they were taxpayers). From this it was a\r\nshort step to equal suffrage with men in all elections and by 1920 there\r\nwere some sixteen states in which this right had been conferred upon\r\nwomen. In the meantime various foreign countries, including England and\r\neven Germany, had granted the full right of suffrage to women. After\r\nlong agitation on the part of American women, Congress in 1919 submitted\r\nto the state legislatures an amendment to the Federal Constitution\r\nproviding for full woman suffrage in all the states, and this nineteenth\r\namendment was ratified in 1920.\r\n\r\n=The Duty to Vote.=--The better opinion is that the exercise of the\r\nsuffrage is not only a high privilege conferred by the state on a select\r\nclass of its citizens, but is a duty as well. Among the great dangers of\r\npopular government are indifference and apathy of the voters. If popular\r\ngovernment is to be a success, we must have not only an intelligent and\r\nhonest electorate but also one which is wide-awake and vigilant. Under a\r\ndemocratic system of government like ours, the character of the\r\ngovernment is largely what the voters make of it. If we are to have\r\ncapable and honest officials to enact laws and enforce them, the voters\r\nmust see to it that such men are nominated and elected and compelled by\r\nthe pressure of a vigorous and alert public opinion to the faithful\r\nperformance of their duties. Every voter should inform himself as to the\r\nqualifications of candidates for office and as to the merits of policies\r\nupon which he is called to express an opinion, and having done this, he\r\nought to go to the polls and contribute his share to the election of\r\ngood men and the adoption of wise public measures.\r\n\r\n_Compulsory Voting._--The question has sometimes been discussed as to\r\nwhether one who possesses the privilege of voting ought not to be\r\nlegally required to exercise it just as the citizen is compelled to\r\nserve on the jury or in the militia. Several European countries, notably\r\nBelgium and Spain, have adopted a system of compulsory suffrage under\r\nwhich failure to vote is punishable by disfranchisement, an increase of\r\ntaxes, publication of the name of the negligent voter as a mark of\r\ncensure, etc. But however reprehensible the conduct of the citizen who\r\nneglects his civic obligations and duties as a member of society, it is\r\nhardly the province of the state to punish the nonperformance of such a\r\nduty. Moreover, if required by law the duty might be exercised as a mere\r\nform and without regard to the public good. Better results are likely to\r\nbe obtained by treating it as a moral duty and a privilege rather than a\r\nlegal obligation. But public opinion ought to condemn the citizen who\r\nwithout good cause neglects his obligations to society, one of which is\r\nthe duty to take part in the election of those who are responsible for\r\nthe government of the country.\r\n\r\n=The Registration Requirement.=--Nearly all of the states now require as\r\na preliminary condition to the exercise of the suffrage that the voter\r\nshall be \"registered,\" that is, that he shall have his name entered on a\r\nlist containing the names of all qualified voters in the election\r\ndistrict who are entitled to take part in the election. The purpose of\r\nthis requirement is to prevent double voting and other abuses of the\r\nelectoral privilege. In densely populated districts it is impossible for\r\nthe election judges to know personally all the voters, and hence without\r\nsome means of identifying them it would be difficult to prevent persons\r\noutside the district from taking part in the election or to prevent\r\nthose properly qualified from voting more than once. In a few\r\ncommunities, however, the old prejudice against such a requirement still\r\nprevails; for example, the constitution of Arkansas declares that\r\nregistration shall not be required as a condition to the exercise of the\r\nelective franchise.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Registration._--Two general types of registration\r\nrequirements are now in existence. One is the requirement that the voter\r\nshall present himself in person before the board of registration prior\r\nto each election and get his name on the list. The chief objection to\r\nthis requirement is that it constitutes something of a burden to the\r\nvoter and often disfranchises him on account of his negligence or\r\ninability to register on the day prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe other type of registration requirement is in force in Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvania, and many other states. Where this system prevails, when\r\nthe voter's name is placed on the registration list, it is kept there so\r\nlong as he remains in the district, and it is unnecessary for him to\r\nregister each year. The principal criticism of this plan is that the\r\nregistration list is less likely to be correct, because the names of\r\npersons who have died or moved away are likely to be kept on the list;\r\nwhereas under the other method they would be stricken off.\r\n\r\n=Time of Holding Elections.=--National elections for the choice of\r\nPresident and Vice President are held on the Tuesday after the first\r\nMonday in November every four years. Elections for representatives in\r\nCongress are held on the same date, in most states, every second year.\r\nElections for state officers are generally held on the same day as\r\nnational elections, though where state officers are chosen annually,\r\nstate elections of course come oftener. A few states, however, prefer to\r\nhold their elections at a different date from that on which national\r\nelections are held. Four states, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, and\r\nVirginia, hold theirs in the odd years, while national elections always\r\noccur in the even-numbered years. A few others which have their\r\nelections in the even-numbered years hold them at a different time of\r\nthe year from that at which national elections are held. Thus Arkansas\r\nand Maine hold their state elections in September, Georgia holds her\r\nelection in October, and Louisiana holds hers in April.\r\n\r\nIn many of the states an attempt is made to separate national and state\r\nelections from municipal elections in order to encourage the voters to\r\nselect municipal officers without reference to state or national issues.\r\nThus in New York, where national and state elections occur biennially in\r\nthe even-numbered years, city elections are held in the odd-numbered\r\nyears. Likewise, in Illinois, city elections are held in April, while\r\nstate and national elections are held in November. So, too, in some\r\nstates judicial elections are held at a different date from other\r\nelections, in order to minimize the influence of party politics in the\r\nselection of judges.\r\n\r\nOther local elections--township, county, and village--are held in some\r\ncases at the same time as the state election, and in other cases such\r\nelections, or some of them, are held on different days.\r\n\r\n=Manner of Holding Elections.=--Before an election can be held, due\r\nnotice must be given of the time and place at which it is to be held and\r\nthe offices to be filled or the questions of public policy to be\r\nsubmitted to the voters. For the convenience of the voters the county or\r\ncity is divided into districts or precincts each containing a\r\ncomparatively small number of voters, and for each district there is\r\nprovided a polling place with the necessary number of booths, ballot\r\nboxes, and other election paraphernalia. The responsibility for\r\npreparing the ballots, giving notice of the election, and providing the\r\nnecessary supplies is intrusted to certain designated officials.\r\nSometimes the county clerk, sometimes the city clerk, and sometimes, as\r\nin the large cities, a board of election commissioners, performs these\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n_Election Officers._--At each polling place, on election day, there is a\r\ncorps of election judges or inspectors, poll clerks, ballot clerks, and\r\nthe like. Each party is allowed to have one or more watchers, and\r\nfrequently there is a police official to maintain order at the polls.\r\nWhile the polls are open, electioneering within a certain number of feet\r\nof the election place is forbidden, and usually no person except the\r\nelection officers, the watchers, and the person who is casting his\r\nballot are allowed in the polling room. Every polling place is equipped\r\nwith one or more voting booths which must be so constructed as to insure\r\nsecrecy on the part of the voter while he is marking his ballot. The\r\npolls are opened at a designated hour, and before the balloting begins\r\nthe ballot boxes must be opened and exhibited to show that they are\r\nempty, after which they are locked and the casting of the ballots\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n=Evolution of the Ballot.=--In the early days of our history, voting was\r\nby _viva voce_, that is, by living voice. Each voter as he appeared at\r\nthe polling place was asked to state the names of the candidates for\r\nwhom he desired to vote, and this he did in a distinct voice that could\r\nbe heard by the bystanders as well as the election officials. The\r\nobvious objection to such a method was that it did not secure secrecy,\r\nand moreover it stimulated bribery because it was easy for a person who\r\npurchased a vote to see that the vote was delivered as paid for. The\r\nstates soon began to experiment with the method of voting by ballot, and\r\nthe advantages were so evident that in time this method was adopted in\r\nall of them, the last state to abandon the old method being Kentucky in\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nAt first written ballots were generally used; then it became the\r\npractice for each candidate to print his own ballots; and later each\r\nparty would put on the same ballot the names of all the party candidates\r\nand have them printed at the expense of the party. Each of these methods\r\nhad its disadvantages. When the last method prevailed, for example, the\r\nballots of the different parties were printed on different colored\r\npaper, so that it was easy to ascertain a voter's intentions by the\r\ncolor of the ballot in his possession. These ballots were distributed\r\ndays before the election and were frequently marked by the voter before\r\ngoing to the polls. Such a system not only made secret voting difficult,\r\nbut it afforded abundant opportunities for using undue influence over\r\ncertain classes of persons to compel them to vote for particular\r\ncandidates. To remove these and other evils which increased as time\r\npassed, the Australian ballot system, with modifications, was introduced\r\ninto this country, first by the state of Massachusetts in 1888, and in\r\none form or another it is now found in practically all the states.\r\n\r\n=The Australian Ballot.=--The distinguishing features of the Australian\r\nsystem are the following: The names of all the candidates of every\r\npolitical party are placed on a single ballot; this ballot is printed at\r\npublic expense and not by the candidates or parties; no ballots are\r\ndistributed before the election, and none are obtainable anywhere except\r\nat the polls on election day, and then only when the voter presents\r\nhimself to vote; and the ballot can be marked only in voting booths\r\nprovided for the purpose, and in absolute secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe Australian system has been more or less modified in all the states\r\nwhere it has been introduced, so that it really does not exist in its\r\npure form anywhere in this country, the nearest approach to it being the\r\nMassachusetts system. The prevailing forms may be reduced to two general\r\ntypes: the \"office column\" type, of which the Massachusetts ballot is a\r\ngood example; and the \"party column\" type found in Indiana and many\r\nother states.\r\n\r\n_The \"Office Column\" Ballot_ has the names of the candidates for each\r\noffice arranged in alphabetical order under the title of the office, and\r\nto vote such a ballot it is necessary for the voter to look through each\r\ncolumn, pick out the candidate he favors, and mark a cross in a blank\r\nspace opposite each name for which he votes. To do this requires not\r\nonly considerable time, but a certain amount of intelligence and\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFFICE COLUMN BALLOT Part of Massachusetts Ballot of\r\nNovember, 1908]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARTY COLUMN BALLOT Part of Indiana Ballot of November,\r\n1908]\r\n\r\n_The \"Party Column\" Ballot_ arranges the candidates, not under the\r\noffices which they are seeking, but in parallel columns according to\r\npolitical parties, there being a column for each party. Opposite each\r\ncandidate's name on the \"party column\" ballot is a blank space, and at\r\nthe head of each column is a circle and usually a device or emblem to\r\nindicate the party. By making a mark in this circle the voter may cast a\r\nballot for all the candidates of the party. This is called \"straight\"\r\nvoting. He may if he wishes, however, vote a \"split\" ticket by putting a\r\ncross in the blank spaces opposite the names of candidates of his choice\r\nin the different columns. The chief objection that has been urged\r\nagainst this type of ballot is that by making it so easy to vote a\r\n\"straight\" ticket, it encourages strict party voting, whereas\r\nindependent voting, especially in city elections, should be encouraged\r\nby every possible means.\r\n\r\nThe \"office column\" ballot, on the other hand, encourages independent\r\nvoting by making it just as difficult to vote a \"straight\" ticket as a\r\n\"split\" one. In Massachusetts there has been a remarkable amount of\r\nindependent voting, due partly to the form of ballot used. The \"office\r\ncolumn\" type of ballot is now used for all elections in about one fourth\r\nof the states, and in a number of others for municipal elections.\r\n\r\n=Ballot Reform.=--In recent years there has been considerable discussion\r\nof the subject of ballot reform, and not a little experimenting with\r\ndifferent schemes. Political reformers generally demand the abolition of\r\nthe \"party column\" form, or at least the abolition of the party circle,\r\nas a means of discouraging straight party voting, but the professional\r\npoliticians insist upon its retention. Whatever may be the form\r\nultimately adopted, one reform is desirable, namely, greater\r\nsimplification, to the end that the electoral franchise may be exercised\r\nmore intelligently and easily. In some of our states the number of\r\nelective offices has increased to such proportions, and the ballot to\r\nsuch size, that it has become a real burden to vote it.\r\n\r\n     A ballot used in Chicago in 1906 contained the names of over 330\r\n     candidates and was over two feet in length and nearly two feet in\r\n     width. From this bewildering array of names the voter was compelled\r\n     to pick out his choice for the following offices: state treasurer,\r\n     state superintendent of public education, trustees of the\r\n     University of Illinois, representative in Congress, state senator,\r\n     representative in the state assembly, sheriff, county treasurer,\r\n     county clerk, clerk of the circuit court, county superintendent of\r\n     schools, judge of the county court, judge of the probate court,\r\n     members of the board of assessors, judges of the municipal court\r\n     for the two-year term (nine to be elected), members of the board of\r\n     review, president of the board of county commissioners, county\r\n     commissioners (ten to be elected on general ticket), trustees of\r\n     the sanitary district of Chicago (three to be elected), clerk of\r\n     the municipal court, chief justice of the municipal court, judges\r\n     of the municipal court (nine to be elected), judges of the\r\n     municipal court for the four-year term (nine to be elected). In\r\n     Oregon in the election of 1912 the ballot contained the names of\r\n     177 candidates and 37 laws and amendments.\r\n\r\nTo vote ballots containing many names requires a good deal of care, if\r\nnot experience, to avoid error which will result in having it thrown\r\nout, for the regulations governing the marking of the ballot are very\r\nstrict and must be observed if the vote is to be counted. Accordingly,\r\nelaborate instructions covering large sheets are posted throughout the\r\nelection district and at the polls for the guidance of the voters, and\r\nthese have to be carefully studied by inexperienced voters who desire to\r\navoid mistakes. Sample ballots also may be provided for practice. One\r\nresult of the increasing complexity of the ballot is to give an\r\nundesirable advantage to the professional politicians who understand how\r\nto vote such ballots, and to discourage those who are not politicians.\r\n\r\n_Voting Machines._--A few states have adopted voting machines,\r\nespecially for their large cities. These are so arranged that the voter\r\nmay, by going into a booth and pulling a number of knobs, register his\r\nvote quickly and without the danger of spoiling his ballot. When the\r\npolls are closed the results are already recorded on a dial, and the\r\nlong delay in counting the returns is eliminated. The chief objection to\r\nthe voting machine, however, is the expense, and this has prevented its\r\nmore general adoption.\r\n\r\n=Formalities of Voting.=--When the voter presents himself at the\r\npolls[21] he must announce his name and address to the election\r\nofficials. If his name is found on the registration list, he is given a\r\nballot and his name entered on the poll book. He then enters a booth,\r\nwhere he marks his ballot, for which purpose he is allowed to remain\r\ntherein not exceeding a certain length of time. He must not mark his\r\nballot in such a way that it can be identified after it has been placed\r\nin the ballot box, and no erasures are allowed. If he spoils his ballot\r\nhe will be given another, and if he is physically unable to mark it, or\r\nif, in some states, he is illiterate, he will be allowed the assistance\r\nof two persons representing different political parties. His right to\r\nvote may be challenged, in which case he will be required to identify\r\nhimself or \"swear in\" his ballot, a record of which must be duly kept.\r\nWhen he has marked his ballot he must fold it in such a manner as to\r\nconceal its face, and hand it to one of the election judges, who\r\nannounces the name of the voter; the fact of his voting is recorded, and\r\nthe ballot placed in the box.\r\n\r\n    [21] Most states have laws allowing voters to leave work for a certain\r\n    length of time on election day without deduction of wages. A few states\r\n    provide means for taking the votes of those who are necessarily absent\r\n    on business on election day. Many states provide for taking the votes\r\n    of men serving as soldiers in time of war.\r\n\r\nAt a certain hour prescribed by law the polls are closed, after which\r\nthe votes are counted; and when this task is complete the returns are\r\nannounced. Generally the ballots must be preserved for several months in\r\norder that an opportunity may be offered for a recount in case the\r\nelection is contested. Usually the ballots cannot be reopened and\r\nrecounted except by order of a court or of the committee on elections of\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\n=Legislation Against Fraudulent Voting; Corrupt Practices Acts.=--For a\r\nlong time in this country there was little legislation designed to\r\nregulate the conduct of elections and to protect the exercise of the\r\nelectoral privilege against fraud. The principal evils of the old system\r\nwere: lack of secrecy in voting; the use of separate ballots printed by\r\nthe candidates or their party organizations; the distribution of these\r\nballots before election day; lack of means for identifying the voters;\r\nbribery, intimidation, treating, and the use of other objectionable\r\nmeans for influencing voters; \"repeating\"; ballot box \"stuffing\"; and\r\nthe like. To eliminate or diminish these and other evils, practically\r\nall the states have passed laws of one kind or another. They are\r\ngenerally known as corrupt practices acts and are, for the most part,\r\nbased on the English law of 1883. Much of this legislation is detailed\r\nand complex, and some of it is still in the experimental stage.\r\n\r\nThe corrupt use of money in elections has come to be one of the greatest\r\npolitical evils of our time. The buying of votes is a very common\r\npractice in some communities, and unfortunately is not as strongly\r\ncondemned by public opinion as it should be. Some 50 per cent of the\r\nvoters in one county of Ohio were disfranchised by the court for selling\r\ntheir votes in the general election of 1910. The growth of great\r\ncorporations, many of which desire legislation in their interest, or\r\nimmunity from unfavorable laws, has introduced a more or less\r\ncorrupting element in our political life. Some states have enacted laws\r\nforbidding corporations, under heavy penalties, from making\r\ncontributions to the campaign funds of political parties. Others have\r\nforbidden the practice of political committees of assessing office\r\nholders for campaign purposes. Some have gone to the length of\r\nforbidding \"treating\" and other similar means of influencing voters.\r\nSome limit the amount of money that may be spent by a candidate or his\r\nfriends in the conduct of his campaign, usually specifying the purposes\r\nfor which expenditures may be made. Thus the Connecticut and New York\r\nlaws allow expenditures only for such matters as the rent of halls,\r\ncompensation of speakers and musicians, fireworks, printing,\r\nlithographs, advertisements, traveling expenses, postage, telegrams,\r\nhiring of carriages to take voters to the polls, and the like. A few,\r\nhowever, prohibit the hiring of carriages, and some forbid the giving\r\naway of liquor at elections. Some states require candidates to make\r\nsworn itemized statements of the expenditures incurred by them on\r\naccount of the election, and some fix the maximum amount that may be\r\nexpended. Thus in New York a candidate for governor may expend only\r\n$10,000 on account of his candidacy; candidates for other state officers\r\nare permitted to spend $6,000. The need of limitations was illustrated\r\nby the fact that the Democratic candidate for governor of New York in\r\n1906 spent over $256,000 in the prosecution of his candidacy, and a\r\ncandidate for state senator spent $30,000 to secure an election.[22] A\r\nrecent candidate for the United States senate in a Western state\r\nadmitted that his aggregate expenses were $107,000, and another\r\ntestified that he spent $115,000 in the effort to secure an election.\r\n\r\n    [22] Fuller, \"Government by the People,\" p. 150.\r\n\r\n_State Contributions to Party Campaign Funds._--In the belief that the\r\nstate ought to bear a part of the candidate's expenses, to the end that\r\nthe poor office seeker may be more nearly on an equal footing with the\r\ncandidate of means, Colorado recently passed a law providing that the\r\nstate should contribute to the campaign fund of each political party a\r\nsum of money equal in amount to twenty-five cents for every vote cast by\r\nthe party for governor at the preceding election. The law allowed the\r\ncandidates themselves to spend their own money to aid in their election,\r\nbut prohibited other persons or corporations from making contributions.\r\nIn short, the expense was to be borne by the state and the candidate\r\nalone. This Colorado law, however, was declared unconstitutional by the\r\nstate courts.\r\n\r\n_Other Restrictions._--In some states also the expenditures of party\r\ncommittees are limited, and such committees are required to make sworn\r\nstatements of their expenditures and the purposes for which they were\r\nmade. Several states prohibit the payment by other persons of a voter's\r\npoll tax where the payment of such a tax is a condition to the voting\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nEverywhere there are laws against bribery, intimidation, fraudulent\r\nvoting, and most of the other election offenses. More and more, public\r\nsentiment demands that elections shall be free from the taint of\r\ncorruption, to the end that the results shall represent the real choice\r\nof the people and thus popular government made to be what its founders\r\nintended that it should be.\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, pp.\r\n     453-457; also ch. xxiii.

Men differ in their opinions on matters of government as\r\nthey do on matters of religion, and hence they come to constitute well\r\ndifferentiated groups. Whenever such a group becomes large enough to\r\nprosecute a concerted policy and organizes itself for the purpose of\r\nfurthering its views in governmental matters, it becomes a political\r\nparty. A political party is, therefore, composed of voters who hold\r\nsubstantially the same opinions in regard to certain public questions or\r\ncertain principles of government. It is a purely voluntary organization,\r\nhowever, and any voter may decline to ally himself with any party, or,\r\nhaving done so, may change to another party whenever he wishes, or he\r\nmay unite with others of a like mind and form a new party. While men can\r\nprobably further the cause of good government best by means of\r\norganization and concert of action, no citizen should think more of his\r\nparty than he does of his country, and whenever the purposes of a\r\npolitical party are prostituted for other ends than the public good no\r\nvoter should feel morally bound to continue his support of such a party.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NATIONAL NOMINATING CONVENTION]\r\n\r\n_National Parties._--Under a system of popular government where public\r\npolicies are determined by the people and public officials are chosen by\r\npopular election, political parties are inevitable if not essential.\r\nAlmost from the beginning, therefore, we have had political parties in\r\nthis country, each believing in certain policies and each endeavoring to\r\ngain control of the government in order to carry out those policies. For\r\nthe promotion of policies that are national in character, such as those\r\nrelating to the tariff, the currency, or the foreign policy of the\r\ncountry, national parties have been formed with organizations extending\r\nthroughout the entire country.\r\n\r\n_Local Parties._--For the most part the organization of the national\r\nparties extends downward through the states and their local\r\nsubdivisions, and are made use of in local as well as in national\r\nelections. As the issues which divide the people in national elections,\r\nhowever, are not always the same as those which divide them in state and\r\nlocal elections, we sometimes have a realignment of parties in local\r\ncontests, and sometimes new parties of a local character are organized.\r\nThis, in fact, is to be desired for the reason that issues of a local\r\ncharacter ought not to be determined with reference to the views of men\r\non issues of a national character. It is wrong, for example, for\r\nDemocrats and Republicans who agree upon the issues involved in a\r\nmunicipal election to oppose each other in such a contest merely because\r\nthey do not agree on the expediency of a protective tariff or of a gold\r\nstandard in money matters. In purely local elections national party\r\nlines should cut no figure; local issues should be judged wholly on\r\ntheir merits without reference to national questions.\r\n\r\n=Existing Political Parties in the United States.=--At the present time\r\nthere are two great political parties in the United States, the\r\nDemocratic party and the Republican party, each with an organization\r\nextending to every part of the country, and together including the great\r\nmajority of the voters.\r\n\r\n_The Democratic Party._--In a general way, we may say that the\r\nDemocratic party is composed of men who believe that the sphere of the\r\nnational government should not be extended beyond what a strict\r\ninterpretation of the Federal Constitution warrants; that the rights of\r\nthe states should be interfered with as little as possible; and that the\r\nactivities of government, whether national, state, or local, should be\r\nkept down to a minimum so that the individual shall be allowed the\r\nlargest measure of freedom consistent with the maintenance of order,\r\npeace, and security. This party has uniformly opposed a protective\r\ntariff, ship subsidies, imperialism, and the extension of the powers of\r\nthe national government through \"constructions\" of the Constitution. On\r\nthe money question the party has not always been united, though for the\r\nmost part it has opposed the single gold standard and favored a\r\nbimetallic standard coupled with the free coinage of silver as well as\r\nof gold.\r\n\r\n_The Republican Party_ has contended for a liberal interpretation of the\r\nFederal Constitution, especially those parts relating to the powers of\r\nthe national government, which it desires to see extended; it has shown\r\nless sympathy than the Democratic party for the rights of the states; it\r\nis the champion of the protective tariff, of internal improvements under\r\nfederal auspices, of colonial expansion, liberal pensions for soldiers\r\nand sailors of the Civil War, of subventions for the merchant marine,\r\nnegro suffrage, and of a gold monetary standard. From the accession of\r\nthe Republican party to power in 1860 with the election of Abraham\r\nLincoln as President, down to 1913, it controlled the executive\r\ndepartment of the national government continually with the exception of\r\neight years when Grover Cleveland was President (1885-1889; 1893-1897).\r\nDuring most of that period it controlled Congress, though several times\r\nthe Democratic party had a majority in one or the other house and\r\noccasionally for a short time it was in the majority in both houses.\r\n\r\nSome state governments are controlled by one party, and some by the\r\nother. Since 1875 the Democratic party has usually been in power in\r\nnearly all of the Southern states, and the Republican party in more than\r\nhalf of the other states; but in some states control often shifts from\r\none party to the other.\r\n\r\n_The Progressive Party_ was organized in 1912 mainly but not wholly by\r\nthose members of the Republican party who felt that this party was not\r\nsufficiently progressive in its policies and that it attached rather too\r\nmuch importance to the interests of special classes and too little to\r\nthe rights of the masses of the people. First of all, it advocated a\r\nlarger social and industrial justice for men and women, especially the\r\nworking classes. It favored national jurisdiction over such matters as\r\ncannot be effectively regulated by the states; public ownership of\r\nforests, coal and oil lands, and water power; and suffrage for women. At\r\nthe election of 1912 the new party polled a total vote of 4,100,000 for\r\nits presidential candidate, Theodore Roosevelt; but a few years later\r\nthe party went out of existence.\r\n\r\n_The Prohibition Party._--Besides the Democratic, Republican, and\r\nProgressive parties, there are several minor parties with organizations\r\nof a national character. The oldest of these is the Prohibition party,\r\norganized in 1872 to promote the movement for the abolition of the\r\nmanufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors. Since its organization,\r\nit has regularly nominated candidates for President and Vice President\r\nof the United States, and in many states it nominates candidates for\r\nstate offices and for the legislature. Not infrequently it has succeeded\r\nin electing some of its candidates to the legislature, and it has been\r\ninstrumental in securing the enactment of local option laws and even\r\nstate-wide prohibition laws in several states.\r\n\r\n_The Socialist Labor Party_, organized in 1892, advocates government\r\nownership of land, railways, telegraph lines, and other means of\r\nproduction and transportation. _The Socialist Party_, organized in 1904\r\nmainly from the Socialist Labor party, advocates essentially the same\r\nviews. At the election of 1912 it cast about 900,000 votes throughout\r\nthe country, and in 1916 about 600,000. In 1919 a large section of the\r\nparty, composed of radicals who advocate the Bolshevist régime of\r\ngovernment by the working class, split off and formed the _Communist\r\nParty_.\r\n\r\n=Party Organization.=--Political parties, like other associations which\r\nhave ends to promote, must have organization. For the conduct of\r\nnational campaigns, each of the parties has a national organization; for\r\nstate purposes there is a state organization; and usually there are a\r\ncounty and a district organization. The characteristic feature of party\r\norganization is the use which is made of committees. The organization\r\neverywhere consists of a committee, at the head of which is a chairman,\r\nand which has also a treasurer and usually a secretary. The chairman is\r\nusually an experienced political leader; sometimes he is at the same\r\ntime an office holder.\r\n\r\n_The Convention._--The policies of the party are formulated by a\r\nconvention which is a representative gathering composed of delegates\r\nchosen directly by the members of the party or by local conventions. The\r\nnational convention, to be described hereafter, is composed of a\r\ncertain number of delegates from each state, while the state convention\r\nis composed of delegates chosen from the counties, the legislative\r\ndistricts, or other units. The county convention is composed of\r\ndelegates from the districts into which the county is divided, and the\r\ncity convention of delegates from the wards or precincts. This is the\r\nusual rule, but here and there are variations. The state convention\r\nformulates the principles of the party and sets them forth in a document\r\ncalled the platform; it nominates the candidates of the party, except in\r\nthose states where they are nominated by a direct primary; and it\r\nappoints the central committee, selects the chairman, and transacts such\r\nother business as may come before it. It is, in short, the supreme\r\nsovereign authority of the party in the state. It is usually a large\r\nbody, sometimes comprising 1,000 or more delegates, and in Massachusetts\r\nas many as 2,000.\r\n\r\n_Committees._--The committee is a select body for carrying on the\r\ncampaign and attending to such other matters as may be intrusted to it.\r\nThe national committee is composed of one member from each state; the\r\nstate committee, usually of delegates from the counties or legislative\r\ndistricts. The New York Republican state committee is composed of one\r\ndelegate from each congressional district in the state, while the\r\nDemocratic committee consists of one delegate from each of the fifty-one\r\nsenatorial districts of the state. Similarly, the county committee is\r\nmade up of delegates representing the political units into which the\r\ncounty is divided, towns, precincts, etc. Sometimes the county committee\r\nis a very large and representative body. The Republican committee of New\r\nYork county is made up of about 700 delegates, each delegate\r\nrepresenting 200 Republican voters in the county.\r\n\r\nIn the cities, there is not only the general city committee, but also a\r\nlocal committee for each ward or precinct. These ward committees come\r\ninto close relation with the voters, and the success of the party\r\ndepends to a large degree upon their activity.\r\n\r\n=Primaries.=--As soon as political parties were definitely formed it\r\nbecame necessary to devise some sort of machinery for selecting the\r\ncandidates which the party desired to put forward. In the beginning\r\ncandidates for local offices were presented to the voters upon their own\r\nannouncement or by a caucus (an informal meeting of the leading men of\r\nthe party) or a primary (a mass meeting of the members of the party). In\r\ntime the caucus, except as a means of selecting candidates for offices\r\nin legislative bodies, fell into disrepute, and the method of nomination\r\nby a convention composed of delegates representing the party became the\r\naccepted method. The delegates are chosen by the members of the party at\r\nan election called a primary, so called because it is the first or\r\noriginal meeting of the party voters in the process of choosing public\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n_Former Lack of State Control._--The calling of the primary, the manner\r\nof conducting it, and the fixing of the party test, that is, the\r\ndetermination of who may take part in the primary, are matters which for\r\na long time were regulated by each party according to its own notions,\r\nwithout interference upon the part of the state. In short, it was\r\nassumed that the state had no interest in the manner in which political\r\nparties nominated their candidates, and it therefore kept its hands off.\r\nThe control of the primaries, particularly in the more populous centers,\r\nfell into the hands of a small number of political leaders, or \"bosses,\"\r\nwho virtually dictated the nominations. Sometimes the primaries were\r\nheld at times or places unknown to the bulk of the members of the\r\nparty, or at inaccessible places, or in rooms inadequate to accommodate\r\nthe mass of the voters. They were sometimes packed with henchmen of\r\ncertain candidates; sometimes large numbers of the voters were kept away\r\nby \"sluggers\" or were intimidated by domineering leaders; sometimes the\r\nqualifications for participating in the primary were fixed in such a\r\nmanner as to exclude the great mass of the voters. Men of other parties\r\nwere sometimes brought in to aid in effecting the nomination of\r\nparticular candidates, ballot boxes were \"stuffed\" or other frauds\r\ncommitted, and often the votes were fraudulently counted. In short, the\r\nabuses became so intolerable as to create a widespread demand for the\r\nregulation of primaries by law so that the results might more truly\r\nrepresent the real opinions of the members of the party.\r\n\r\n_State Regulation of Primaries._--Accordingly, one state after another\r\nbegan to pass laws regulating the holding of primaries, on the ground\r\nthat the state was as much interested in the nomination of candidates as\r\nit was in the election of those nominated, for it was obvious that\r\nunless nominations were fairly made and unless the candidates selected\r\nreally represented the free choice of the people, popular government\r\nwould be at an end, since in many communities a nomination was\r\nequivalent to an election. At first, the laws enacted by the states for\r\nthe regulation of primary elections were simple, and were designed to\r\nprevent only a few of the worst abuses that had grown up. They usually\r\napplied only to the large cities, and in many cases they were optional\r\nin character, that is, they applied only to such communities as chose to\r\nconduct their primaries in accordance with the laws thus passed.\r\nBeginning about 1890, however, the legislatures here and there began to\r\nenact state-wide primary laws which were mandatory upon all localities\r\nand all parties, and applied to nominations for the great bulk of the\r\noffices filled by popular election.\r\n\r\n=Existing Primary Laws.=--At present nearly every state has a law\r\nregulating in some way the holding of primary elections. In general,\r\nthese laws apply to every organized political party that cast at least a\r\ncertain number of votes at the preceding election; and they provide that\r\nthe primaries of all such parties shall be held on the same day (in some\r\nstates at the same polling places, and by the same officials that hold\r\nthe regular elections), and in accordance with the rules and safeguards\r\ngoverning the regular elections. They fix the date on which the\r\nprimaries shall be held and require that due notice shall be given\r\nthereof; they prescribe the manner of nominating delegates (and such\r\ncandidates for public office as are chosen directly by the primaries);\r\nthey provide for the use of official ballots printed at public expense;\r\nthey contain provisions in regard to the organization and powers of the\r\nparty committees, and in general they regulate everything relating to\r\nthe conduct of the primaries that would be a subject of regulation if\r\nthey were regular elections.\r\n\r\n_The Party Test._--One of the most difficult problems in the enactment\r\nof legislation concerning the primary election is how to prescribe\r\nfairly the qualifications that must be possessed by those who shall be\r\nallowed to participate in the primary. It is often embarrassing and\r\ndisagreeable for a voter when he appears at the polls to cast his vote\r\nto be compelled to reveal his party affiliation, yet unless he is\r\nrequired to do so, the adherents of one party might easily participate\r\nin the primary of another with a view to bringing about the nomination\r\nof its weakest candidates. Thus in a Western city some years ago where\r\nthe primary law did not require a declaration of party affiliation, a\r\nlarge number of the members of one party entered the primary of the\r\nopposite party and brought about the nomination of their weakest\r\ncandidate for mayor, and thus at the regular election the party to which\r\nthe \"invaders\" belonged was easily able to defeat him with its own\r\ncandidate. An \"open\" primary is open to any and all voters. Most primary\r\nlaws, however, insist upon a statement by the voter of his party\r\naffiliation as a condition to participation in the primary, which is\r\ntherefore called a \"closed\" primary. Usually the test of membership is\r\nthat the voter must have affiliated with the party at the last election,\r\nand sometimes he must pledge himself to support at the coming election\r\nthe candidates nominated at the primary of the party in which he\r\nparticipates.\r\n\r\nAs a closed primary is an election by the members of a political party,\r\nindependents, or those who are not adherents of any party, are not\r\nallowed to participate. This discourages reform movements by independent\r\nvoters, but there seems to be no way to remedy the matter. Sometimes an\r\nexception is made in the primaries for the nomination of candidates for\r\ncity offices, on the ground that party lines should not be strictly\r\ndrawn in local contests and that independent movements should be\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\n=Nominations by Conventions.=--Before the introduction of the method of\r\nnominating candidates by the direct primary, to be described hereafter,\r\nthe universal method of nomination was by convention, and this is still\r\nthe prevailing method in many states.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Organization of a Convention._--The convention, as\r\npreviously stated, is composed of delegates chosen at a primary\r\nelection. The date and place of holding the convention are announced by\r\nthe party committee some weeks in advance. It is called to order by the\r\nchairman of the committee, after which a temporary chairman of the\r\nconvention is elected, and not infrequently a spirited contest takes\r\nplace over the election, especially when there is likely to be a\r\nstruggle for the nomination of the principal officers which the\r\nconvention has been called to nominate. The temporary chairman, upon\r\ntaking the chair, usually delivers an address in which he extols the\r\nparty for its achievements in the past, after which usually four\r\ncommittees are appointed: one on organization, one on rules, one on\r\nresolutions, and one on credentials.\r\n\r\n_Convention Committees._--Frequently rival delegations appear from some\r\ncounty or district, and the convention must decide which one is entitled\r\nto seats. Questions of this kind are referred to the committee on\r\ncredentials, which, after hearing both sides, reports to the convention\r\nrecommending which delegation shall be seated, and the recommendation of\r\nthe committee usually, though not always, is approved. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, both contesting delegations are seated, each delegate being\r\nallowed half a vote.\r\n\r\nThe committee on rules frames the rules of procedure by which the\r\nbusiness of the convention is to be transacted; its report is usually\r\nadopted without alteration.\r\n\r\nThe committee on permanent organization proposes the names of candidates\r\nfor permanent chairman, secretary, and such other officers of the\r\nconvention as may be needed. The officers suggested by this committee\r\nare usually elected, though sometimes the convention elects a different\r\nticket.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the committee on resolutions presents a draft of the\r\nplatform, which is adopted by the convention, usually, though not\r\nalways, without change.\r\n\r\n_The Nominations._--The convention is now ready for the chief business\r\nfor which it was called, namely, the nomination of candidates which the\r\nparty desires to put forward for the offices to be filled at the coming\r\nelection. The names of the candidates are usually presented to the\r\nconvention in highly eulogistic speeches, and the nominations are\r\ngenerally seconded by one or more delegates. The balloting then proceeds\r\nuntil the nominations are all made. Sometimes where more than two\r\ncandidates are placed in nomination no one of them is able to secure a\r\nmajority, and a \"deadlock\" ensues, lasting maybe for days or even weeks,\r\nand terminated by the nomination of a \"dark horse.\"\r\n\r\n_Objections to the Convention Method._--When deadlocks occur, the \"dark\r\nhorse\" chosen is likely to be an inferior candidate. Another objection\r\nto the method of nomination by convention is that the nominations are\r\nfrequently determined by a small number of leaders or \"bosses\" who\r\ncontrol the convention, and thus the nominations do not represent the\r\nchoice of the party. How a convention may be thus controlled by a few\r\npoliticians is thus stated by a careful writer who is fully conversant\r\nwith party methods:[23]\r\n\r\n    [23] Fuller, \"Government by the People,\" pp. 61-63.\r\n\r\n     \"The program of the convention, in practice, is almost always\r\n     decided upon down to the minutest detail, before the convention\r\n     meets. The party leader, or 'boss,' and his lieutenants discuss the\r\n     relative claims of candidates and decide who shall be nominated.\r\n     The party platform is written and submitted to the 'boss' for his\r\n     approval. The officers of the convention are agreed upon and their\r\n     speeches revised. All this is outside the law, which ignores the\r\n     existence of the party leader and assumes that the delegates are\r\n     free to exercise their own judgment. The real interest in the\r\n     convention is usually centered in the secret conferences of the\r\n     leaders which precede it and in which the contests over the\r\n     nominations are fought out, sometimes with much stubbornness. The\r\n     'slate' is finally made up by agreement between leaders who control\r\n     a majority of the delegates in the convention. The leaders of the\r\n     minority may either surrender or they may register their protest\r\n     by presenting the names of other candidates in the convention with\r\n     the certainty of defeat, for it is rare in state conventions that\r\n     there is so equal a division of strength as to leave the result in\r\n     doubt.\r\n\r\n     \"While the leaders are settling what the convention is to do, the\r\n     delegates are left to their own devices, ignorant of what is going\r\n     on in the 'headquarters' where the leaders are assembled. They are\r\n     not consulted and their advice is not asked. It often happens that\r\n     they do not know whom they are to nominate until they hear for the\r\n     first time in the convention hall the names of the candidates\r\n     agreed upon by the leaders. Although the law gives them the right\r\n     to bring forward the names of other candidates, they seldom\r\n     exercise it, and the delegate bold enough to disobey orders is\r\n     regarded with disapproval.\"\r\n\r\n=Nomination by the People: the Direct Primary.=--About 1889, because of\r\ngrowing dissatisfaction with the convention system, some of the states\r\nbegan to experiment with the method of popular nomination, that is,\r\ndirect nomination by the primary instead of by convention. Instead of\r\ncalling on the voters to choose delegates to a convention to which the\r\ntask of nomination was intrusted, they were now called upon to vote\r\ndirectly for the candidates themselves. It was said that if the voters\r\nwere competent to choose delegates to a convention they were equally\r\ncompetent to select the candidates themselves. The movement for the\r\ndirect primary, as it was called, spread rapidly particularly in the\r\nSouth and West. Thus the convention has been done away with in a large\r\nnumber of states except where it is still retained to frame platforms,\r\nappoint the central committee, and select delegates to the national\r\nconvention, and in some states it has been abolished even for these\r\npurposes, other means having been provided for taking care of these\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n_Objections._--The direct primary has been criticized because under it\r\ncandidates for state offices need to canvass the entire state in order\r\nto become acquainted with the voters--a task which requires much time\r\nand is very expensive. Such a system, it is argued, gives the candidate\r\nof leisure and wealth a decided advantage over the poor man who cannot\r\nafford the large expense involved.\r\n\r\nThe direct primary method, however, has given general satisfaction where\r\nit has been adopted.\r\n\r\n=Nomination by Petition.=--While most candidates for public office are\r\nnominated by the recognized political parties, the laws of many states\r\nallow candidates to be nominated also by petition of independent voters.\r\nThe procedure of nomination by petition is for the candidate or his\r\nfriends to prepare a nomination paper or petition containing the title\r\nof the office to be filled, together with the name and residence of the\r\ncandidate, get a certain number of voters to sign it, and then file it\r\nwith the proper election officer. The number of signatures necessary to\r\nnominate varies according to the nature of the office to be filled and\r\nthe population of the district or territory over which the jurisdiction\r\nof the office extends. Thus in New York a petition for the nomination of\r\na candidate for a state office must contain the signatures of at least\r\n12,000 legal voters (including at least 50 from each county), while in\r\nMassachusetts 1,000 is sufficient. For the nomination of candidates for\r\nlocal offices the number of petitioners required is smaller. Thus in New\r\nYork candidates for the legislature may be nominated by 500 voters; in\r\nMassachusetts candidates for local offices may be nominated by petitions\r\nsigned by one per cent of the number of voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, chs. vii,\r\n     xxx.

Do you consider political parties essential under a system of popular\r\ngovernment?

Do you think every voter ought to join some political party and\r\nsupport its candidates and policies? Suppose he does not approve the\r\ncandidates which it has nominated and the policies which it has adopted,\r\nwhat should he do? Ought independent voting to be encouraged? If so,\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\n3.

It assumed large powers in the belief\r\nthat the people, relying upon its patriotism and wisdom, would acquiesce\r\nin its acts. As yet, however, the states were not closely united, and\r\neach was free to go its own way. As time passed, the advantages of union\r\nbecame more manifest, and the states began to recognize the desirability\r\nof creating a common government with larger powers and with definite\r\nauthority. After a debate lasting off and on for more than a year,\r\nCongress adopted in November, 1777, an instrument called the Articles of\r\nConfederation, which was to go into effect when ratified by all the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n_Ratification of the Articles._--During the years 1778 and 1779, all the\r\nstates except Maryland ratified the Articles. Maryland withheld her\r\napproval because she doubted the advantage of a union among states, some\r\nof which held vast territory in the West while some did not. The states\r\nclaiming lands northwest of the Ohio River were Virginia, New York,\r\nMassachusetts, and Connecticut. As these lands had been wrested from\r\nGreat Britain while that power was weakened by her war with all the\r\nstates, Maryland insisted, as a condition to her adhesion, that the\r\nstates claiming these lands should surrender them to the nation for the\r\nbenefit of all the states. This argument appealed to the sense of\r\npatriotism and justice of the states claiming this northwestern\r\nterritory, and in the course of the next few years they ceded most of\r\ntheir lands to the United States for the common benefit. When it became\r\ncertain that this would be done, Maryland ratified the Articles, and the\r\nConfederation of the states was completed.\r\n\r\n=Government under the Articles.=--The Confederation thus formed was\r\nstyled a \"firm league of friendship\" under the name of \"the United\r\nStates of America,\" and its declared purpose was to provide for the\r\ncommon defense of the states, the security of their liberties, and their\r\nmutual and general welfare. To secure these ends the states bound\r\nthemselves to assist each other against all attacks upon either or all\r\nof them, upon any pretense whatever.\r\n\r\nFor the management of certain affairs common to the states composing the\r\nConfederation, the Articles provided for an annual Congress of delegates\r\nto be chosen by the states, no state to be represented by less than two\r\nmembers or more than seven. Unlike the Continental Congress, the\r\nCongress of the Confederation was given express power to deal with\r\ncertain affairs, and therefore it did not have to assume the powers it\r\nexercised. Among these were the power to declare war and make peace; to\r\nsend and receive diplomatic representatives; to enter into treaties; to\r\nmake rules regarding captures on the high seas; to grant letters of\r\nmarque and reprisal; to settle disputes between the states, upon\r\npetition of the disputants; to regulate the alloy and value of coin,\r\nwhether struck under the authority of Congress or by the states; to fix\r\nthe standard of weights and measures throughout the United States; to\r\nregulate trade and intercourse with the Indians; to make rules for the\r\ngovernment of the land and naval forces; to establish post offices; and\r\na few other powers of a like character.\r\n\r\nNo provision, however, was made for an executive department or for a\r\nnational judiciary, with the single exception of a court of appeal in\r\ncases involving captures on the high seas in time of war.\r\n\r\n_Prohibitions on the States._--In the interest of the general peace and\r\nsecurity, the states were forbidden, except with the consent of\r\nCongress, to send diplomatic representatives to foreign countries, or\r\nenter into treaties or alliances, or levy any duties on articles\r\nimported from abroad, if such duties should conflict with the provisions\r\nof foreign treaties; or keep ships of war in times of peace; or engage\r\nin war; or grant letters of marque and reprisal.\r\n\r\n=Defects of the Articles of Confederation.=--Although the Articles of\r\nConfederation proved of great value in securing concert of action among\r\nthe states in certain matters, the weaknesses of the union which they\r\ncreated and the defects of the governmental machinery provided by them\r\nsoon proved serious.\r\n\r\n_The States Retained too Much Power._--The union turned out to be the\r\nloosest sort of a league, in which the states for the most part did as\r\nthey pleased. Each retained its own sovereignty and could not be\r\ncompelled to perform its obligations as a member of the Confederation.\r\nSome of them deliberately violated the treaty of peace with Great\r\nBritain, and the Congress was unable to prevent such infractions.\r\nCongress being thus powerless to carry out the stipulations of the\r\ntreaty, Great Britain refused to perform her obligations thereunder.\r\nSince no executive department and no courts were created to enforce and\r\napply the laws passed by Congress, the nation had to depend upon the\r\nstates to carry out its will.\r\n\r\n_The Congress was not well Organized._--In the organization and\r\nprocedure of Congress there were serious defects. No member could serve\r\nfor more than three years in six, and each state paid its own members\r\nand might recall them at pleasure. Thus the dependence of the\r\nrepresentative upon his state was emphasized and his character as a\r\nnational representative minimized. Worse than this was the provision\r\nthat allowed each state, regardless of its population and size, but one\r\nvote in Congress. Thus Georgia with a population of only a few thousand\r\nsouls enjoyed the same power in all matters of national legislation that\r\nVirginia did, although the population of Virginia was some sixteen times\r\nas great. Still another serious weakness was the rule which required the\r\nassent of nine states to pass any important bill, such as those for\r\nborrowing or appropriating money, issuing bills of credit, declaring\r\nwar, entering into treaties, coining money, building war ships, raising\r\nmilitary forces, selecting commanders, and the like. As it was\r\nfrequently impossible to secure the concurrence of so large a proportion\r\nof the states, needed legislation was often prevented by the opposition\r\nof a few members or by the lack of a quorum. Thus in April, 1783, there\r\nwere present only twenty-five members from eleven states, nine being\r\nrepresented by only two members each. It would have been possible,\r\ntherefore, for three members to defeat any important measure.[24]\r\n\r\n    [24] Andrews, \"Manual of the Constitution,\" p. 38.\r\n\r\n_Congress had No Power of Taxation._--Not only were the defects in the\r\norganization and procedure of Congress of a serious character, but the\r\npowers conferred upon it by the Articles of Confederation were so meager\r\nthat its authority was little more than a shadow and carried little\r\nweight. One of the essential powers of government is that of taxation,\r\nyet the Congress had no authority to impose a dollar of taxes on any\r\nindividual in the land. Money was needed to pay the soldiers who were\r\nfighting the battles of the country, to pay the salaries and expenses of\r\ndiplomatic representatives who had been sent to Europe to negotiate\r\ntreaties and solicit the aid of foreign friends, to pay interest on\r\nloans incurred in France and Holland, to defray the cost of building war\r\nships and equipping the army, and to meet the various other expenses\r\nwhich every government must needs incur, yet the government of the\r\nConfederation was powerless to raise the necessary funds by taxation. In\r\nthe absence of all power to levy and collect taxes, Congress adopted the\r\npolicy of apportioning the national expenses among the states. But no\r\nstate could be compelled to contribute a dollar toward its quota; some\r\nof them in fact contributed little, and most of those which did respond\r\nto the appeal of Congress did so grudgingly and tardily. Of the\r\n$15,000,000 apportioned among the states between 1781 and 1786 less than\r\n$2,000,000 was actually paid in. Often there was not a dollar in the\r\ntreasury of the Confederation to pay the obligations of the government.\r\n\r\nTwo attempts were made to amend the Articles of Confederation so as to\r\ngive Congress power to levy a five per cent tariff duty on imported\r\ngoods, but since it required the assent of each of the thirteen states\r\nto adopt an amendment, the scheme fell through, in both cases on account\r\nof the opposition of a single state.\r\n\r\n_Congress had No Power to Regulate Commerce_, either with foreign\r\ncountries or among the states themselves. This was a serious defect.\r\nEach state had its own tariff system and its own customhouses, and\r\ncollected its own duties on goods brought into its ports from abroad. As\r\neach state was anxious to exploit this source of revenue for itself, it\r\nnaturally framed its tariff regulations and tonnage laws in such a way\r\nas to attract foreign commerce to its own ports. And so it was with\r\nregard to commerce among the states themselves. Each framed its trade\r\nregulations with its neighbors according to its own selfish interests\r\nand without regard to the general good. The result was continual\r\njealousies, dissensions, and sometimes reprisals and retaliations. New\r\nYork levied an import duty on certain articles brought in from its less\r\nfortunate neighbors, Connecticut and New Jersey, and each in turn\r\nretaliated as best it could. For purposes of foreign and interstate\r\ncommerce, each state was a nation itself, and the Confederation was a\r\nnonentity.\r\n\r\n=The Annapolis Convention.=--The worst evils described above reached a\r\nclimax in 1786, and the political leaders of America such as Hamilton\r\nand Washington were convinced that the government of the Confederation\r\nmust either be revised or superseded entirely by a new system. In\r\nSeptember, 1786, there assembled at Annapolis, Maryland, a convention of\r\ndelegates from five states, namely, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, and Virginia, called at the instance of the legislature of\r\nVirginia to take into consideration the subject of uniform trade\r\nregulation among the states, the lack of which had come to be one of the\r\nchief evils of the Confederation. So few states were represented that\r\nthe convention decided not to enter upon the business for which it had\r\nbeen called, but instead determined to put forth an effort to bring\r\nabout the assembling of a convention representing all the states and\r\nempowered to take into consideration the question of a general revision\r\nof the Articles of Confederation so as to render them more adequate to\r\nthe needs of the nation. Accordingly, a resolution prepared by Alexander\r\nHamilton, one of the delegates from New York, was adopted, calling on\r\nthe states to appoint delegates to a convention to be held at\r\nPhiladelphia on the second Monday in May next, for the purpose of\r\nrevising the Articles of Confederation.\r\n\r\n=The Constitutional Convention of 1787; Personnel.=--In pursuance of\r\nthis resolution, all the states except Rhode Island promptly appointed\r\ndelegates, the failure of Rhode Island being due to her satisfaction\r\nwith the Confederation, under which she enjoyed larger commercial\r\nadvantages than she could hope to enjoy if the Articles were amended so\r\nas to take away from the states their control over commerce. Altogether\r\nfifty-five members sat in the convention at one time or another, though\r\nonly thirty-nine signed the Constitution. From Virginia came George\r\nWashington, Edmund Randolph, and James Madison; from Massachusetts,\r\nRufus King and Elbridge Gerry; from Connecticut, William Samuel Johnson\r\nand Roger Sherman; from New Hampshire, John Langdon; from New York,\r\nAlexander Hamilton; from New Jersey, William Livingston and William\r\nPaterson; from Pennsylvania, Benjamin Franklin, Robert and Gouverneur\r\nMorris, Jared Ingersoll, and James Wilson; from Delaware, John\r\nDickinson; and from South Carolina, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, and\r\nCharles Cotesworth Pinckney. Some of the delegates, as Benjamin\r\nFranklin, had been members of the Albany Congress as far back as 1754;\r\nsome had been members of the Stamp Act Congress of 1765; most of them\r\nhad served in the Continental or Confederation Congresses; and a number\r\nof them were signers of the Declaration of Independence. A great many of\r\nthem had served in the legislatures of their states, and of the whole\r\nnumber there was not one who had not had some legislative experience.\r\n\r\n=The Work of the Convention of 1787.=--When the convention had been duly\r\norganized, \"plans\" of a proposed constitution were submitted by the\r\ndelegations of several states, and these became the bases of the\r\ndiscussion which followed.\r\n\r\n_The Virginia Plan._--The plan submitted by the Virginia delegation\r\nrepresented the views of delegates from the larger and more populous\r\nstates, and the Constitution as finally adopted embodied more largely\r\nthe features of this plan than those of any other. The most important\r\nresolution of this plan was that a national government ought to be\r\nestablished consisting of a supreme legislative, judiciary, and\r\nexecutive. This resolution, adopted in committee of the whole, went\r\ndirectly to the root of the chief evil of the existing system, which\r\ncontained no provision for an executive or a judicial department. It\r\nrecognized also what has come to be a fundamental doctrine of American\r\npolitical science, namely, the separation of the legislative, executive,\r\nand judicial functions.\r\n\r\n_The New Jersey Plan._--The views of delegates from the small states\r\nwere embodied in the New Jersey plan, which was laid before the\r\nconvention by William Paterson. In general, the New Jersey plan provided\r\nfor the retention of the principal features of the existing system,\r\nexcept that it proposed to enlarge the powers of Congress so as to make\r\nits authority more effective. This was all, in the judgment of the small\r\nstates, that was necessary to remove the existing evils.\r\n\r\n_The Problem of Representation in Congress._--The convention without\r\nmuch discussion decided that Congress should consist of two chambers or\r\nhouses instead of one as was the case under the Articles of\r\nConfederation. This done, the next problem was to determine the basis of\r\nrepresentation in each. This proved to be one of the most difficult\r\ntasks of the convention. The delegates from the large states insisted\r\nthat representation in both houses should be based on population, so\r\nthat a state such as Virginia with sixteen times the population of\r\nGeorgia should have sixteen times as many representatives in Congress.\r\nBut to this system of proportional representation, the delegates from\r\nthe small states objected. They maintained that the importance of a\r\nstate was not to be measured by its population; that the states were\r\nsovereign political entities, and when it came to participation in the\r\ngovernment of the nation they were all equal, large and small alike.\r\nThere was no more reason, said a delegate from one of the small states,\r\nwhy a large state should have more representation in Congress than that\r\na large man should have more votes than a small man. For a time the\r\ndifferences seemed irreconcilable, and more than once it looked as if\r\nthe convention would be disrupted on this question. The spirit of\r\ncompromise triumphed, however, and it was finally agreed that the states\r\nshould be represented equally in the senate but in proportion to their\r\npopulation in the house of representatives. As a result of this rule,\r\nNevada to-day with a population of less than 100,000 sends the same\r\nnumber of senators to Washington as does New York with a population of\r\nsome 10,000,000 souls. New York, on the other hand, sends forty-three\r\nrepresentatives to Congress while Nevada sends but one. This was the\r\nfirst great compromise of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n_The Question of Counting the Slaves._--The next problem, which was\r\nalmost equally difficult and which likewise had to be settled by\r\ncompromise, was the question of whether the slaves should be counted in\r\ndetermining the population of the state for purposes of representation.\r\nThe delegates from the Southern states argued that slaves were an\r\nimportant factor in contributing to the wealth and power of the country\r\nand should, therefore, be counted for purposes of representation. To\r\nthis argument the delegates from the Northern states, where the slave\r\npopulation was inconsiderable, objected on the ground that the slaves at\r\nlaw were treated merely as property and were not allowed to vote in the\r\nstates where they resided. The discussion over this question was long\r\nand at times exciting, but finally a compromise was reached by which it\r\nwas agreed that in determining the population for purposes of\r\nrepresentation, all the white population but only three fifths of the\r\nslaves should be counted. At the same time it was decided that direct\r\ntaxes among the states should be apportioned on the same basis. This\r\ncompromise was favorable to the slave states in that it gave them an\r\nincreased number of representatives, but it was unfavorable in that it\r\nincreased their proportion of direct taxes. This is known as the\r\nthree-fifths compromise.\r\n\r\n_Federal Regulation of Commerce._--Another question which became the\r\nsubject of heated discussion related to the national control of\r\ncommerce. The Northern states wished Congress to be given the power to\r\nregulate commerce, but the Southern states, which at the time furnished\r\nthe principal articles of export, feared that the power might be\r\nemployed in such a manner as to injure their commerce, and might also be\r\nused to prohibit the slave trade and thus prevent the Southern planters\r\nfrom stocking their farms with laborers. They accordingly insisted that\r\nCongress should be expressly prohibited from interfering with the\r\nimportation of slaves, and that it should be allowed to pass navigation\r\nacts only by a two-thirds majority of both houses. The whole matter was\r\nfinally settled by a compromise which forbade Congress to interfere with\r\nthe importation of slaves before the year 1808, but which allowed it to\r\npass laws by a majority vote for the regulation of commerce. This was\r\nthe last great compromise of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n_Other Compromises._--Many other questions were settled on the basis of\r\ncompromise, though none of them occasioned so much discussion as the\r\nthree mentioned above. Some have regretted that such compromises as that\r\nwhich allows the states equality of representation in the senate, as\r\nwell as the one which allowed representation on the basis of the slave\r\npopulation, should have ever found their way into the Constitution; but\r\nit is certain that without these compromises the Constitution could\r\nnever have been adopted.\r\n\r\nAfter the settlement of the questions mentioned above, the work of\r\nframing the Constitution proceeded with less difficulty. Finally, on\r\nSeptember 17, the completed draft was signed by thirty-nine delegates,\r\nafter which the convention adjourned. A few were absent and did not sign\r\nfor that reason; others, such as Gerry of Massachusetts and Mason of\r\nVirginia, disapproved of the Constitution and refused to attach their\r\nsignatures.\r\n\r\n=Ratification of the Constitution.=--Before adjourning, the convention\r\nresolved to send the draft of the Constitution to Congress with the\r\nrequest that it should transmit the instrument to the legislatures of\r\nthe several states and that these in turn should submit it to\r\nconventions for ratification. It was agreed, moreover, that when it\r\nshould have been ratified by conventions in nine states it should go\r\ninto effect between the states so ratifying.\r\n\r\n_Opposition to the Constitution._--As soon as the text of the\r\nConstitution was made known to the people of the states, a flood of\r\ncriticism was turned loose on it from almost every part of the country.\r\nThose who approved the Constitution and favored its ratification were\r\ncalled Federalists; those who opposed it were called Anti-Federalists.\r\nThe principal grounds of opposition were that in providing for a\r\nnational government with extensive powers the Constitution had\r\nsacrificed, to a large degree, the rights of the states; that such a\r\ngovernment would prove dangerous to the liberties of the people; that\r\nthe President for which the Constitution provided might become a\r\ndictator and a tyrant; that the senate would be an oligarchy; and that\r\nthe Federal Constitution, unlike those of the states, contained no bill\r\nof rights for the protection of the people against governmental\r\nencroachment upon their inherent rights such as freedom of speech,\r\nfreedom of press, freedom of religious worship, freedom of assembly, and\r\nthe like. The last mentioned objection was removed by the assurance on\r\nthe part of the friends of the Constitution that in the event of\r\nratification they would endeavor to have the Constitution amended at the\r\nearliest opportunity in such a way as to provide proper safeguards for\r\nthe security of these rights, a promise which was carried out soon after\r\nthe new government went into effect, by the adoption of the first ten\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n_Ratification by the States._--The first state to ratify the\r\nConstitution was Delaware, one of the small states whose delegates in\r\nthe Philadelphia convention had been strongly opposed to changing the\r\nexisting system. This state ratified on December 6, 1787, without a\r\ndissenting vote. Its action was shortly followed by Pennsylvania, New\r\nJersey, Georgia, and Connecticut, the last three of which were small\r\nstates whose delegates in the Philadelphia convention had also been in\r\nthe opposition. In Pennsylvania, however, the Constitution was ratified\r\nwith less unanimity and only after a fierce struggle in which the\r\nAnti-Federalists attacked almost every part of it. Massachusetts was the\r\nnext to ratify, although by a narrow majority, many of the leading\r\ncitizens being opposed or indifferent. Maryland and South Carolina\r\nfollowed, and finally the favorable action of New Hampshire on June 21,\r\n1788, insured its success, since nine states had now ratified and the\r\nConstitution could be put into effect between the states that had so\r\nratified. Four days later, before news of the ratification of New\r\nHampshire was received, Virginia fell in line and ratified, in spite of\r\nthe powerful opposition of Patrick Henry, Mason, Lee, and others.\r\n\r\nAttention was now turned to New York, where the opponents of the\r\nConstitution were believed to be in the majority. Geographically, New\r\nYork was like a wedge which divided the Union into two parts, and hence\r\nits adhesion was especially desirable. Because of its favorable\r\ncommercial position, the state enjoyed great advantages under the\r\nArticles of Confederation, since it could collect and turn into its own\r\ntreasury the duties on all articles coming into its ports from abroad--a\r\nprivilege of which it would be deprived under the Constitution. There\r\nwas good reason, therefore, why it should hesitate to exchange its\r\nposition for one less favorable. When the state convention assembled to\r\ntake action on the Constitution, it was found that about two thirds of\r\nthe members were at first opposed to ratification. Among the friends of\r\nthe Constitution, however, was Alexander Hamilton, whose powerful\r\nargument prevailed, and the Constitution was ratified by a majority of\r\nthree votes.\r\n\r\nRhode Island, like New York, enjoyed a favorable position under the\r\nArticles of Confederation, and was not in sympathy with the\r\nConstitution. She refused to ratify and remained out of the Union until\r\nMay, 1790, more than a year after the Constitution had gone into effect.\r\nNorth Carolina likewise refused to ratify until November, 1789.\r\n\r\n_The Constitution Goes into Effect._--When the ratification of the\r\nConstitution had been assured, the old Congress of the Confederation\r\nenacted that the new government should go into effect on March 4, 1789.\r\nIn the meantime senators and representatives were elected as the first\r\nmembers of the new Congress, and George Washington was chosen President.\r\nThus the old Confederation passed away and the new Republic entered upon\r\nits great career.\r\n\r\n=The System of Government Created.=--The government created by the\r\nConstitution is federal in character; that is, it consists of a system\r\nof national and state government under a common sovereignty. It is a\r\nrepublic as contradistinguished from such a limited monarchy as the\r\nBritish; that is, it is a government having a popularly elected\r\nexecutive rather than a titular executive who holds his office for life\r\nby hereditary tenure, who is politically irresponsible, and who governs\r\nthrough ministers who are responsible to the Parliament for his acts. It\r\nis also distinguished from confederate government or that form in which\r\nthe states are practically sovereign and in which the general government\r\nis nothing but the agent of the states for the care of a very few things\r\nof common concern, such as defense against foreign aggression. Finally,\r\nthe American system is one of popular rather than of aristocratic\r\ngovernment, that is, it is government by the masses of the people\r\ninstead of government by the favored few.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, ch. ii.

Under\r\nthe Articles of Confederation members of the old Congress were chosen\r\nannually, but that term was too short to enable them to acquire that\r\nfamiliarity with their duties which is essential to efficient\r\nlegislation. The term of a representative begins on the 4th of March in\r\nthe odd-numbered years, though Congress does not meet until the first\r\nMonday in December following, unless the President calls it together in\r\nextraordinary session earlier.\r\n\r\n=Sessions of Congress.=--There are two regular sessions of every\r\nCongress; the long session which begins on the first Monday in December\r\nof the odd-numbered years and lasts until some time in the following\r\nspring or summer; and the short session which begins on the same date in\r\nthe even-numbered years and lasts until the 4th of March following, when\r\nthe terms of all representatives expire. Each Congress is numbered,\r\nbeginning with the first, which began March 4th, 1789. The sixty-seventh\r\nCongress began March 4, 1921, and will end March 4, 1923. Extraordinary\r\nsessions are sometimes called by the President to consider matters of\r\nspecial importance which need to be acted upon before the meeting of the\r\nregular session. From 1789 to 1921 there were only nineteen such\r\nsessions, the last being that called by President Harding to meet in\r\nApril, 1921, to consider tariff and revenue measures and readjustment of\r\ninternational relationships.\r\n\r\n=Number and Apportionment of Representatives.=--The Constitution\r\nprovided that the first house of representatives should consist of\r\nsixty-five members, but that as soon as a census of the inhabitants\r\nshould be taken the number was to be apportioned among the several\r\nstates on the basis of population, not exceeding one for every 30,000 of\r\nthe inhabitants. After each decennial census is taken a new\r\napportionment is made by Congress on the basis of the new population.\r\nThe total number of representatives at present is 435,[25] being in the\r\nproportion of one member for every 211,877 inhabitants, which is known\r\nas the congressional ratio. The largest number from any one state is\r\nforty-three, the number from New York. Pennsylvania has thirty-six,\r\nIllinois twenty-seven, Ohio twenty-two, and so on down the list. Five\r\nstates are entitled to but one member each, namely, Arizona, Delaware,\r\nNevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming. As the population of several of these\r\nstates is less than the congressional ratio, they might not be entitled\r\nto a single member but for the provision in the Constitution which\r\ndeclares that each state shall have at least one representative.\r\n\r\n    [25] Each of the Territories is represented in Congress by a delegate\r\n    who is allowed to serve on certain committees and to take part in\r\n    debate but not to vote. The Philippine Islands are represented by two\r\n    Resident Commissioners, and Porto Rico by one. By courtesy they are\r\n    allowed seats in the house of representatives, like territorial\r\n    delegates, and may serve on committees.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of representatives after each census have been as follows:\r\n1790, 105; 1800, 141; 1810, 181; 1820, 212; 1830, 240; 1840, 223; 1850,\r\n234; 1860, 241; 1870, 292; 1880, 325; 1890, 356; 1900, 386; 1910, 435.\r\n\r\n=Election of Representatives.=--The Constitution provides that\r\nrepresentatives shall be chosen in each state by vote of such persons as\r\nare qualified to vote for members of the lower house of the legislature\r\nof that state. Thus it happens that the qualifications for participating\r\nin the choice of national representatives varies widely in the different\r\nstates. But the choice must be made by the people, not by the\r\nlegislature or by executive appointment, and, under the Fifteenth and\r\nNineteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution, the states cannot, in\r\nfixing the suffrage, discriminate against any class of persons because\r\nof their color, race, or sex. Subject to these restrictions the states\r\nare practically free to limit the right to vote for national\r\nrepresentatives to such of their citizens as they may see fit. It is\r\ntrue that the Fourteenth Amendment declares that whenever a state shall\r\nlimit the right of its adult male citizens to vote except for crime its\r\nrepresentation in Congress shall be proportionately reduced, but this\r\nprovision has never been enforced. Some statesmen hold that it was\r\nreally superseded by the Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES]\r\n\r\n_Manner of Choosing Representatives._--As in fixing the qualifications\r\nof the electors of representatives, so in the choosing of them, the\r\nstates are left a free hand, subject to the provision of the\r\nConstitution which gives Congress power to alter the regulations of the\r\nstates in regard to the manner and time of choosing members. For a long\r\ntime Congress did not exercise its power in this respect and each state\r\nchose its representatives when it wished and in such manner as it\r\npleased. Some states chose their representatives on general ticket from\r\nthe state at large, while others chose theirs by districts; some chose\r\nby secret ballot, while others did not. To secure uniformity in regard\r\nto the method of choice, Congress enacted in 1842 that representatives\r\nshould be chosen by districts of contiguous territory containing\r\npopulations as nearly equal to the congressional ratio as possible.\r\nIn 1871 it enacted that they should be chosen by written or printed\r\nballots (later choice by voting machine was also permitted). In 1872\r\nit enacted that representatives should be chosen on the same day\r\nthroughout the Union, namely, Tuesday after the first Monday in\r\nNovember.[26]\r\n\r\n    [26] By a subsequent act, those states whose constitutions provided a\r\n    different day for choosing representatives were exempted from the\r\n    provisions of this law. In pursuance of this act, elections for members\r\n    of Congress in Maine are held in September.\r\n\r\n\"_Gerrymandering._\"--When the number of representatives to which each\r\nstate shall be entitled has been determined, after the decennial census,\r\nit devolves upon the legislature to divide the state into as many\r\ndistricts as it is entitled to representatives.[27] In the exercise of\r\nthis power the political party in control of the legislature may arrange\r\nthe districts in an unfair manner so as to make it possible for the\r\nparty to elect a larger number of representatives than its voting\r\nstrength entitles it to. This is done by putting counties in which the\r\nopposite party is in a large majority in the same districts so that it\r\nmay choose a few members by large majorities, while the other party\r\ncarries the remaining districts by small majorities. Thus the voting\r\nstrength of the party in power is economized while that of the other\r\nparty is massed in a few districts and made to count as little as\r\npossible. This practice is known as \"gerrymandering\" and has often been\r\nresorted to by both the two great political parties, sometimes in such\r\na manner as to result in flagrant injustice to the minority party.\r\n\r\n    [27] In case the legislature neglects to redistrict the state when\r\n    additional representatives have been assigned to it, the latter are\r\n    chosen from the state at large. In 1916, for example, Pennsylvania\r\n    elected four such representatives; Illinois, Texas, Montana, and Idaho,\r\n    two each; Alabama and West Virginia, one each.\r\n\r\nThe requirement that the districts shall contain as nearly equal\r\npopulation as possible, is sometimes flagrantly violated. Thus one of\r\nthe Republican districts in New York recently contained 165,701\r\ninhabitants while one of the Democratic districts had a population of\r\n450,000. In 1910 one of the Illinois districts contained 167,000 while\r\nanother contained 349,000.\r\n\r\nSometimes districts are so constructed as to have fantastic shapes. Thus\r\na district in Mississippi some years ago was dubbed the \"shoe string\"\r\ndistrict from its long irregular shape. It followed the Mississippi\r\nRiver for the whole length of the state though in one place it was less\r\nthan thirty miles wide.\r\n\r\n=Qualifications of Representatives.=--To be eligible to the house of\r\nrepresentatives, a person must have been a citizen of the United States\r\nfor at least seven years, must have attained the age of twenty-five\r\nyears, and must be an inhabitant of the state from which he is chosen.\r\nResidence in the particular district which the member represents is not\r\nrequired by the Constitution or laws of the United States, but is nearly\r\nalways required by public opinion. A nonresident, however able and\r\ndistinguished he might be as a statesman, would have little chance of\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n_Objections to the Residence Requirement._--This custom of insisting\r\nupon residence in the district has frequently been criticized,\r\nespecially by foreign writers, as being a serious defect in our system\r\nof representation. It contrasts widely with the practice in Great\r\nBritain, where members of Parliament are very often chosen from other\r\ndistricts than those in which they reside. London barristers of promise\r\nare not infrequently chosen to represent country districts in which\r\nthey are practically strangers. The late William E. Gladstone, a\r\nresident of Wales, represented for a long time a Scotch district. When\r\nan important leader of any party in the House of Commons happens to be\r\ndefeated in his home district, it is a common practice for him to be\r\nmade a candidate in some district in which his party has a safe\r\nmajority. In the United States, in such a case, the man's service in\r\nCongress would probably be ended.\r\n\r\nFinally, one of the worst evils of the district system is that it tends\r\nto make the member feel that he is the representative, not of the United\r\nStates as a whole, but of the locality which chooses him. Instead of\r\nentertaining broad views upon purely national questions his views tend\r\nto become narrow and he votes and acts with reference to the welfare of\r\nhis own district rather than with reference to the good of the whole\r\ncountry. On the other hand, it may be said in favor of the district\r\nsystem that it is better adapted to secure local representation and\r\nmakes responsibility to the member's constituency more effective.\r\n\r\n=The Senate.=--_Purposes._--Regarding the desirability of creating a\r\nnational legislature of two houses there was little difference of\r\nopinion among the members of the convention. Experience with a\r\nsingle-chambered congress during the period of the Confederation had\r\nrevealed certain defects in such an organization. Moreover, all the\r\nstate legislatures except two were composed of two houses and these\r\nexceptions were destined soon to disappear. If a state legislature ought\r\nto consist of two houses, it was all the more important that the\r\nnational congress should be bicameral in organization, because, the\r\nunion being composed of states, it was desirable to provide a separate\r\nhouse in which they could be represented as constituent political units\r\njust as the other house was to be a body representing the people\r\nwithout regard to political divisions. Aside from considerations growing\r\nout of the character of the federal system, there were the usual\r\nadvantages which we associate with the bicameral system, such as\r\nprotection against hasty and ill-considered legislation, insurance\r\nagainst the possible despotism of a single chamber, and the like. Having\r\ndecided that Congress should consist of two houses, the convention felt\r\nthat if the upper house was to exert an effective restraining influence\r\non the lower house it ought not to be a mere duplication of the latter\r\nbut should be differently composed. It should to a certain extent be a\r\nmore conservative body than the lower house, which, being elected by the\r\npeople, would incline toward radicalism; it should, therefore, be\r\nsmaller in size, its members should be chosen for a longer term and by a\r\ndifferent method, higher age and residence qualifications should be\r\nrequired, and it should be given certain powers which were not conferred\r\non the lower house, such as a share in the appointing, treaty making,\r\nand judicial powers.\r\n\r\n_Term._--As already stated, the Constitution provides that the states\r\nshall be represented equally in the senate. It also provides that each\r\nstate shall elect two senators and that each senator shall have one\r\nvote. Under the Articles of Confederation, each state had one vote in\r\nCongress, and the vote of the state could not be divided; but under the\r\nConstitution the two senators from a state frequently vote on opposite\r\nsides of a question, especially if they belong to different political\r\nparties. On the question of the term of senators there was much\r\ndifference of opinion among the members of the convention. Some favored\r\na two-year tenure, some four years, some six, some nine, while Alexander\r\nHamilton favored a life tenure. The term finally agreed upon was six\r\nyears, which seemed to be long enough to give the senate an element of\r\npermanence and independence, and yet short enough to secure\r\nresponsibility to the people.\r\n\r\n_Classification of Senators._--The Constitution provided that\r\nimmediately upon the assembling of the senators after the first election\r\nthey should be divided into three classes and that the seats of those in\r\nthe first class should be vacated at the end of the second year, those\r\nof the second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and those of\r\nthe third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so that thereafter\r\none third might be chosen every second year. The purpose of this\r\nprovision is to avoid having the entire senate renewed at the same time.\r\nAs a result, not more than one third are new and inexperienced members\r\nat any particular time. When a new state is admitted to the Union, its\r\nfirst two senators draw lots to see which class each shall fall in. In\r\n1921 there were thirty-two senators in the first class, and their terms\r\nexpire March 4, 1923; thirty-two in the second class, and their terms\r\nexpire March 4, 1925; and thirty-two in the third class, and their terms\r\nexpire March 4, 1927. The three classes are kept as nearly equal as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n_Reëlection of Senators._--While the term of a senator is six years, he\r\nmay be reëlected as often as his state may see fit to honor him, and in\r\npractice reëlections have been frequent. Justin S. Morrill of Vermont,\r\nJohn Sherman of Ohio, and William B. Allison of Iowa, each served\r\ncontinuously for a period of thirty-two years. Nearly one third of the\r\nsenators in 1911 had served twenty years or more. Thus the senate is an\r\nassembly of elder statesmen and is a more conservative and stable body\r\nthan the house of representatives.\r\n\r\n=Mode of Election of Senators.=--In regard to the mode of election of\r\nsenators there was a wide difference of opinion among the members of the\r\nconvention. Some favored choice by the people; others favored election\r\nby the lower house of Congress; some proposed appointment by the\r\nPresident from persons nominated by the state legislatures; while others\r\nproposed election by the state legislatures, which was the method\r\nfinally agreed upon. Choice by the legislature, it was felt, would be\r\nthe means of forming a connecting link between the state governments and\r\nthe national government and would thereby tend to attach the former to\r\nthe latter--an important consideration then, in view of the prevailing\r\njealousy of the state governments toward the national government.\r\nFinally, it was believed that choice by the legislature would tend to\r\nsecure the election of senators of greater ability since the members of\r\nthe legislature would be more familiar with the qualifications of\r\ncandidates than the masses of the people could hope to be.\r\n\r\n=Objections to the Method of Choice by the Legislature.=--One of the\r\npractical objections to the original method of choosing senators was\r\nthat it frequently led to long and stubborn contests which sometimes\r\nended in deadlocks. Not infrequently the legislature failed to elect a\r\nsenator and the state was left with a vacancy in the senate. In such\r\ncases the governor could not fill the vacancy by appointment as he did\r\nwhen a senator died or resigned; the seat remained vacant until a\r\nsenator was chosen by the legislature. From 1890 to 1912 not less than\r\neleven states at one time or another were represented in the senate by\r\none member only, and in 1901 Delaware, on account of repeated deadlocks,\r\nhad no senator at all at Washington to speak for the state. Not\r\ninfrequently such contests were broken through the selection of a\r\nsecond-rate man or by an alliance between the members of the minority\r\nparty and certain members of the majority.\r\n\r\n_Bribery._--The breaking of deadlocks was sometimes accomplished by\r\nbribery or other improper influences. Indeed charges of bribery and\r\ncorruption in connection with the election of senators came to be very\r\ncommon, and there is little doubt that between 1895 and 1910 a number of\r\nwealthy men found their way into the senate through the votes of\r\nlegislators who were liberally paid for their support. Under these\r\ncircumstances it was frequently said that the senate was no longer truly\r\nrepresentative of the interests of the people.\r\n\r\n_Interference with Legislative Business._--A prolonged senatorial\r\ncontest also interfered too much with the regular business of the state\r\nlegislature. Where the session is limited to two or three months, as it\r\nfrequently is, the inroads upon the time at the disposal of the\r\nlegislature for looking after the needs of the state were\r\nconsiderable.[28] Members were badgered by candidates, passions and\r\nanimosities were engendered, a party coloring was given non-partisan\r\nmeasures, and the votes of members on legislative measures were\r\nsometimes determined by the senatorial contest, rather than by the\r\nmerits of the measure on which they were called to vote.\r\n\r\n    [28] In 1897 the business of the legislature of Oregon was completely\r\n    tied up for months because a sufficient number of members of the lower\r\n    house, in order to prevent the election of a certain senator, absented\r\n    themselves from the chamber and prevented a quorum. Not a bill could be\r\n    passed or a dollar of money appropriated for meeting the current\r\n    expenses of the state.\r\n\r\n=Popular Election of Senators.=--The dissatisfaction with the old method\r\nof choosing senators led to a movement to secure an amendment to the\r\nConstitution providing for the election of senators by the people. But\r\nthe senate itself for a long time blocked every attempt of this kind.\r\nFive different times between 1893 and 1911 the national house of\r\nrepresentatives by a large majority proposed an amendment for this\r\npurpose, but each time the senate refused its concurrence. In one form\r\nor another the legislatures of thirty-one states approved of the method\r\nof popular election and wherever a referendum was taken on the\r\nproposition, as was done in California, Nevada, and Illinois, the\r\npopular indorsement was overwhelming. Finally, in 1912, the senate\r\nyielded, and both houses of Congress adopted a resolution proposing an\r\namendment providing for the popular election of senators, which was\r\nratified by the necessary number of states during the following year.\r\nUnder this seventeenth amendment the senators of each state are elected\r\nby vote of such persons as are entitled to vote for members of the lower\r\nhouse of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth amendment provides that whenever a vacancy occurs in the\r\nsenate the governor of the state in which the vacancy occurs shall issue\r\na writ of election for the filling of such vacancy, but that the\r\nlegislature may authorize the governor to fill the vacancy by a\r\ntemporary appointment, the appointee to hold until a senator may be\r\nchosen by popular election. In practice special elections are rarely\r\ncalled for filling vacancies. In most states the governor makes a\r\ntemporary appointment, the appointee holding until the next regular\r\nelection when the people elect his successor.\r\n\r\n=Qualifications of Senators.=--The qualifications prescribed for\r\neligibility to the senate are the same in principle as those required of\r\nrepresentatives, though a little different in degree. Thus a senator\r\nmust be at least thirty years of age, must have been a citizen of the\r\nUnited States for nine years and must be a resident of the state at the\r\ntime of his election. It was thought that the longer term and higher\r\nqualifications would tend to give greater dignity and strength to the\r\nupper chamber than would be found in the lower house, and at the same\r\ntime a higher average of ability.\r\n\r\nThere is no provision of the Constitution which requires a senator to be\r\na resident of a particular part of the state, but in some states there\r\nis a custom that the two senators shall be taken from different\r\nsections. Thus in Vermont custom requires that one senator shall come\r\nfrom the section of the state east of the Green Mountains and the other\r\nfrom the west side. Sometimes when there is a large city in the state it\r\nis the custom to choose one of the senators from the city and the other\r\nfrom the country. For a long time Maryland did not trust this matter to\r\ncustom but by law enacted that one of the senators should be an\r\ninhabitant of the eastern shore and the other of the western shore.\r\n\r\n=Character of the Senate.=--In the early days when the states were\r\ngenerally regarded as sovereign communities, senators were looked upon\r\nsomewhat as ambassadors to the national government, and the right to\r\ninstruct them as to how they should vote on important questions was\r\nsometimes claimed and asserted by the legislatures. Sometimes the\r\nsenators obeyed the instructions, sometimes they refused; and in the\r\nlatter case there were no means of enforcing obedience. Not infrequently\r\nsenators are \"requested\" by the legislature of the state which they\r\nrepresent to vote for or against a particular bill.\r\n\r\nThe Senate undoubtedly possesses elements of strength and efficiency\r\nwhich are not to be found in the lower house. As it is a much smaller\r\nbody, debate there can be carried on with more effectiveness, and the\r\nindividual member has greater opportunity to make his influence felt\r\nupon legislation. The efficiency of the Senate is further increased by\r\nthe fact that its members are generally men of more mature age and\r\nlarger legislative experience, many of them having already served their\r\napprenticeship in the lower house. Moreover, owing to the longer term,\r\nthey are more independent of the popular opinion of the moment and,\r\ntherefore, under less temptation to yield to popular clamor and vote for\r\nmeasures which their better judgment condemns. These facts, it may be\r\nadded, have tended to increase the attractiveness of the Senate as a\r\nlegislative body and to draw into it statesmen of larger ability than\r\nthe lower house has been able to attract.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, these elements of strength have to some extent been\r\nsources of weakness. The attractions of the Senate have stimulated the\r\nambitions of rich men who have few other qualifications than the\r\npossession of great wealth, and so it came to pass that a considerable\r\nproportion of the members of the upper house were representatives of\r\ngreat corporations and of other forms of wealth. This was not\r\nnecessarily an evil, but it was often said that the senators were\r\nirresponsive to public opinion. Moreover, the Senate has been criticized\r\nfor usurping to a considerable extent the powers of the executive\r\ndepartment in regard to appointments and the conduct of foreign affairs,\r\nand has encroached upon the powers of the lower house in respect to the\r\ninitiation of revenue bills. Finally, the tradition of senatorial\r\ncourtesy, which makes it possible for a single senator to deadlock\r\nindefinitely the proceedings of the Senate, has been criticized as being\r\nquite out of harmony with reasonable notions of legislative procedure.\r\nAll these charges, however, have been vigorously denied by many\r\ndefenders of the Senate. Some of them are well founded, but all in all,\r\nthe Senate compares favorably with the best upper chambers of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n=Decisions as to Congressional Elections and Membership.=--Each house of\r\nCongress is the judge of the election, qualifications, and returns of\r\nits own members, that is, it is empowered to determine whether a member\r\nwho claims to have been elected has been legally chosen and whether he\r\nreally possesses the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution for\r\nmembership in the house. It seems to be admitted that either house may\r\nalso refuse to admit a member for other reasons than those prescribed by\r\nthe Constitution, as, for example, for having been convicted of a crime\r\nor because he is insane or suffering with a dangerous contagious\r\ndisease. Thus in 1900 the house of representatives refused to allow a\r\nmember from Utah to take his seat because he was living in violation of\r\nthe anti-polygamy laws, and in 1919 it excluded a Socialist member from\r\nWisconsin for disloyalty during the war.\r\n\r\n_Contested Elections._--Frequently there is a contested election from a\r\nstate or district, that is, two men claim to have been elected to the\r\nsame seat, in which case the house must decide which one is entitled to\r\nthe seat. In such a case the claims of the contestant and the contestee\r\nare heard by the committee on privileges and elections, which makes a\r\nreport to the house with a recommendation as to which shall be given the\r\nseat. Unfortunately, contested election cases are not always settled on\r\ntheir merits, the seat being usually given to the claimant who belongs\r\nto the party which has a majority in the house. In England this source\r\nof party favoritism is removed by vesting the settlement of cases of\r\ncontested elections in the courts, which are more apt to decide such\r\ncontests on their merits.\r\n\r\n_Power of Expulsion._--When a member has once been admitted to his\r\nseat, he can be deprived of it only by expulsion, and to prevent the\r\nemployment of this power for party purposes, the Constitution provides\r\nthat the concurrence of two thirds of the members shall be necessary to\r\nexpel a member. Several instances of expulsion have occurred in the\r\npast. Senator Blount of Tennessee was expelled from the senate in 1797,\r\nand a number of other cases occurred in each house during the Civil War.\r\n\r\n=Compensation of Members of Congress.=--The Constitution declares that\r\nsenators and representatives shall receive a compensation for their\r\nservices, the same to be paid out of the treasury of the United States.\r\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, each state paid its own members of\r\nCongress, and there was no uniformity in respect to the scale of\r\ncompensation. Some states paid much smaller salaries than others and in\r\norder to reduce the burden of maintaining their representatives, the\r\nstates generally sent to Congress the fewest number of representatives\r\nrequired, and as each state had only one vote, nothing was lost by\r\nhaving a minimum number present. One other objection to the method of\r\nstate payment was that it tended to make the representative dependent\r\nupon his state and caused him to feel that he was the representative of\r\na state rather than of the country as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn fixing the amount of the compensation of its members, Congress is\r\nsubject to no restrictions. It may fix the salary at any amount it\r\npleases, may make it retroactive in effect or may increase the amount at\r\nany time during the term for which the members are chosen. The present\r\nsalary of senators and representatives is $7,500 per year, but the\r\nSpeaker of the house receives $12,000 per year. In addition, each member\r\nreceives an allowance for a secretary, a small sum for stationery, and\r\nmileage of twenty cents per mile going and coming by the nearest route\r\nbetween his home and the national capital. This mileage is intended to\r\ncover the traveling expenses of the member and his family.\r\n\r\nIn some of the countries of Europe until recently members of Parliament\r\ndid not receive any compensation from the public treasury unless they\r\nhappened to be members of the cabinet; this was the rule in Great\r\nBritain prior to 1911. Sometimes, however, members who represented the\r\nsocialist or labor party were paid by voluntary contributions by the\r\nmembers of their party. The advantage of paying members of Congress a\r\nreasonable compensation is that it enables competent men without private\r\nincomes to serve the state equally with the well-to-do, who are not\r\ndependent upon their public salaries for a livelihood.\r\n\r\n_The Franking Privilege._--Another privilege which Congress allows its\r\nmembers is to send their mail through the post office without the\r\npayment of postage. The spirit of the law restricts the privilege to the\r\nofficial correspondence of members, but the privilege is generally\r\nabused. Thus a senator from South Carolina was recently criticized by\r\nthe post-office department for franking his typewriter through the\r\nmails. President Taft in his annual message to Congress in December,\r\n1910, dwelt upon the abuses of this privilege by members of Congress and\r\nother government officials. The postmaster general in 1914 called\r\nattention to a recent instance in which more than 300,000 pamphlets were\r\ncirculated under the frank of a member of Congress, the postage on which\r\nwould have amounted to $57,000. They related not to public business but\r\nto the interest of a certain industry in which he was concerned.\r\n\r\n=Rights and Privileges of Members of Congress.=--The Constitution\r\nprovides that members shall not be arrested in any case except treason,\r\nfelony, and breach of the peace, during their attendance at the\r\nsessions of their respective houses and in going to and from the same;\r\nand for any speech or debate in either house, they cannot be questioned\r\nin any other place. The purpose of the first provision is to prevent\r\ninterference with members in the discharge of their high and responsible\r\nduties, through arrest for trivial offenses or trumped-up charges. If a\r\nmember, however, commits an offense amounting to a breach of the peace,\r\nhis immunity from arrest ceases and he may be dealt with by the courts\r\nas any other offender. The object of the second provision is to secure\r\nto members absolute freedom of speech on the floor of Congress by\r\nrelieving them from the liability to prosecution for slander for\r\nanything they may say in the course of debate.\r\n\r\n_Disqualifications._--On the other hand, the Constitution provides that\r\nno person holding any office under the United States shall be a member\r\nof either house of Congress during his continuance in office. This\r\nprovision was adopted in pursuance of the view that the executive and\r\nlegislative departments should, as far as practicable, be kept separate.\r\nMoreover, no senator or representative may, during the time for which he\r\nis elected, be appointed to any civil office which shall have been\r\ncreated or the emoluments of which shall have been increased during such\r\ntime. The purpose of this provision is to prevent Congress from creating\r\nnew offices or increasing the salaries of existing offices for the\r\nbenefit of members who might desire to be appointed to them.\r\n\r\n=Special Functions of the Senate.=--The senate is not only a coequal\r\nbranch of the national legislature but it possesses in addition certain\r\npowers not enjoyed by the lower house.\r\n\r\n_Share in the Appointing Power._--First of all, it shares with the\r\nPresident the power of appointment to federal offices. The Constitution\r\nmakes its approval necessary to the validity of all appointments made by\r\nthe executive, the idea being that the participation of the senate would\r\nserve as a restraint upon the errors or abuses of the President and thus\r\ninsure the appointment of honest and capable men to office. But it was\r\nnever intended to give the senate anything more than the negative power\r\nof rejecting the nominations of the President. It is his power to\r\nnominate and that of the senate to approve or disapprove the nomination.\r\nNevertheless, there has grown up in the senate a practice by which the\r\nsenators from a particular state in which an appointment to a federal\r\noffice is to be made, claim the right to select the appointee themselves\r\nand when they have agreed upon him to present his name to the President\r\nfor appointment; provided, of course, that they are of the same party as\r\nthe President. If the President refuses to comply with the request of\r\nthe senators from a particular state, and nominates an official who is\r\nunacceptable to them, the custom of \"senatorial courtesy,\" which has\r\nbecome one of the traditions of the senate, requires that the senators\r\nfrom the other states shall stand by their associates in question and\r\nreject the nomination of the President. In this way the senate has, in\r\neffect, assumed the power of dictating to the President appointments to\r\nmany federal offices in the states, such as those of postmaster, federal\r\njudge, attorney, revenue collector, and the like. If the two senators\r\nfrom a state belong to different political parties, the one with whom\r\nthe President is in political sympathy controls the federal patronage in\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n_Share in the Treaty-Making Power._--The senate also shares with the\r\nPresident the power of making treaties with foreign countries. The\r\nordinary procedure is for the President, through the Department of\r\nState, to negotiate the treaty, after which it is laid before the senate\r\nfor its approval. Approval by a two-thirds vote of the senators is\r\nnecessary to the validity of the treaty. The purpose of giving the\r\nsenate a share in the treaty-making power was to provide a check or\r\nrestraint upon the possible abuses or errors of the executive. The\r\nextraordinary majority required for the approval of the treaty, however,\r\nhas frequently proved a handicap and led to the defeat of a number of\r\nvaluable treaties. Thus a small political minority can prevent the\r\nratification of a treaty and sometimes does so when it sees an\r\nopportunity to reap political advantage thereby.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution speaks of the \"advice and consent\" of the senate, but\r\nin practice all the senate does is to give its consent. In the early\r\ndays, however, the President not infrequently requested the \"advice\" of\r\nthe senate before starting the negotiation of a treaty, and if the\r\nadvice was unfavorable the proposed negotiations were abandoned. Even\r\nnow if the President has doubts as to whether a proposed treaty would\r\nreceive the approval of two thirds of the senate he will sometimes\r\nconsult with the members of the senate committee on foreign relations\r\nand with other influential members, before beginning the negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe senate may reject a treaty _in toto_, and has done so in many\r\ninstances, or it may amend a treaty laid before it, in which case it\r\nmust be sent back to the government of the other country which is a\r\nparty thereto for concurrence in the amendments. After the senate has\r\nconsented to the ratification of a treaty, the President may ratify it\r\nor not as he likes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, WASHINGTON, D.C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITE HOUSE,--THE PRESIDENT'S HOME AND OFFICE]\r\n\r\n_The Senate as a Court of Impeachment._--Another special function of the\r\nsenate is that of acting as a court for the trial of impeachment\r\ncases. The Constitution declares that the President, Vice President, and\r\nall civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on\r\nimpeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes\r\nand misdemeanors. Military and naval officers are tried by court-martial\r\nand are not therefore liable to impeachment.[29] To impeach an officer is\r\nto bring charges against him. So far as federal officers are concerned\r\nthis power belongs exclusively to the house of representatives, which\r\nacts somewhat as a grand jury does in finding indictments against\r\nordinary criminals. When sitting as a court of impeachment the senators\r\nare under a special oath, and when the President is on trial the chief\r\njustice of the Supreme Court is the presiding officer instead of the\r\nVice President, who, in such a case, would be directly interested in the\r\noutcome of the trial, since in the event of the conviction and removal\r\nof the President he would succeed to the office. Managers appointed by\r\nthe house of representatives appear at the bar of the senate to\r\nprosecute the charges preferred by the house, witnesses are examined,\r\nevidence presented, and the accused is defended by counsel of his own\r\nchoosing. In order to prevent the employment of the impeachment power\r\nfor party purposes, the Constitution provides that the concurrence of\r\ntwo thirds of the senators shall be necessary to convict.\r\n\r\n    [29] That members of Congress are not liable to impeachment was\r\n    determined in the case of William Blount, a senator from Tennessee in\r\n    1797, the senate deciding that it had no jurisdiction of the case.\r\n\r\nThe punishment which the senate may inflict in case of conviction is\r\nlimited to removal from office and disqualification from holding office\r\nin the future. The Constitution makes it mandatory upon the senate to\r\nremove the convicted official, but whether he shall forever be\r\ndisqualified from holding office in the future is left to the\r\ndiscretion of the senate. In England the House of Lords, which tries\r\nimpeachment cases, is not limited in the extent of punishment which it\r\nmay inflict, but may, at its discretion, sentence the convicted official\r\nto imprisonment or the payment of a fine. While the senate of the United\r\nStates cannot do this, the person convicted and removed may,\r\nnevertheless, be indicted and tried by the courts as any other criminal\r\nmay.\r\n\r\nThe procedure of removing an officer by impeachment is so cumbersome and\r\nunwieldy that it has rarely been resorted to. During our entire history\r\nthere have been only eight impeachment trials of federal officers, and\r\nof these there were convictions in but three cases.[30] If this were the\r\nonly method of removal it would be difficult to get rid of corrupt and\r\nincompetent officials, but it must be remembered that any federal\r\nofficial except the judges may be removed from office by the President\r\nfor any reason that to him seems fit and proper; and the power is\r\nfrequently exercised.\r\n\r\n    [30] The first was that of Judge John Pickering of the United States\r\n    District Court of New Hampshire, March, 1803. The second was that of\r\n    Judge Samuel Chase, of the Supreme Court, March, 1804. James H. Peck,\r\n    District Judge of Missouri, was impeached in April, 1830; West H.\r\n    Humphreys, District Judge of Tennessee, May, 1862; Andrew Johnson,\r\n    President of the United States, February, 1868; William W. Belknap,\r\n    Secretary of War, March, 1876; Charles Swayne, Judge of the United\r\n    States District Court for Florida, 1905; and Robert W. Archbald, Judge\r\n    of the Court of Commerce, 1912. Of these, Pickering, Humphreys, and\r\n    Archbald were convicted and removed from office, while Humphreys and\r\n    Archbald were in addition disqualified from holding federal office in\r\n    the future. Belknap resigned before impeachment charges were preferred,\r\n    but the senate decided that it had jurisdiction, nevertheless, and the\r\n    trial was proceeded with only to result in his acquittal.\r\n\r\n    =References.=--ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, pp. 47-68.

Is there any evidence that your state is \"gerrymandered\"?\r\n\r\n3. In what congressional district do you live? How many counties are\r\nthere in the district? What is its population? How much does the\r\npopulation vary from the congressional ratio? Who is your\r\nrepresentative? How many terms has he served? What is his party? By how\r\nlarge a majority was he elected?\r\n\r\n4. Who is the senior senator from your state? The junior senator? How\r\nmany terms has each served? To which of the three classes does each\r\nbelong?\r\n\r\n5. If the first congressional ratio of one member for 30,000 inhabitants\r\nwere now in force, what would be the number of representatives in the\r\nhouse? Give arguments for and against the proposition that a house of\r\n435 members is too large.\r\n\r\n6. Is the present salary of members of Congress sufficiently large to\r\nattract the best men? Do you think the European custom of not paying\r\nsalaries to members of Parliament a wise one?\r\n\r\n7. Do you think members of Congress are morally entitled to\r\n\"constructive\" mileage, that is, for mileage not actually traveled, as\r\nwhere one session merges into another?\r\n\r\n8. Members of the British Parliament are elected for a term of five\r\nyears, those of the German Reichstag for five years, those of the French\r\nChamber of Deputies for four years. In view of these rather long terms,\r\ndo you think a two-year term for American representatives is too short?\r\n\r\n9. Do you think the practice of members of Congress of distributing\r\nlarge quantities of garden seed among their constituents at public\r\nexpense a wise or a vicious one?\r\n\r\n10. Do you think public documents printed by authority of Congress\r\nshould be distributed free of cost to all who desire them?\r\n\r\n11. What is your opinion of the practice of members of Congress of\r\nprinting in the Congressional Record long speeches never delivered in\r\nCongress?\r\n\r\n12. Would the nomination of members of Congress by direct primary be a\r\nbetter method than nomination by convention?\r\n\r\n13. What would be the advantage in requiring a newly elected Congress to\r\nassemble shortly after the election instead of about thirteen months\r\nthereafter, as is the present rule?\r\n\r\n14.

Ought a representative to be required to be a resident of the\r\ndistrict from which he is elected?\r\n\r\n16. Do you think the states should be equally represented in the\r\nsenate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURE OF CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Organization of the Two Houses.=--_Officers._--Each house of Congress\r\nis free to organize itself in such a manner as it pleases, and to choose\r\nits own officers, except that the Vice President of the United States\r\nis, by the Constitution, made the presiding officer of the senate. The\r\npresiding officer of the house of representatives is called the speaker;\r\nthat of the senate, the president. Each house has one or more clerks who\r\nkeep the journals, call rolls, read bills, and have custody of all\r\nbills, resolutions, petitions, and memorials; a sergeant-at-arms who\r\npreserves order, has charge of the halls, pays members their salaries,\r\nand performs various other duties[31]; a postmaster; a doorkeeper; a\r\nchaplain; and other minor officials.\r\n\r\n    [31] The sergeant-at-arms of the house of representatives has custody\r\n    of the mace which is the symbol of the authority of the house. It is a\r\n    representation of the Roman _fasces_ in ebony, and is surmounted by a\r\n    globe and an eagle in silver. During the session it is kept in the\r\n    place provided for it near the speaker's desk, but when disorder breaks\r\n    out in the course of the debates, the sergeant-at-arms takes the mace\r\n    from its accustomed place and proceeds, bearing it aloft, to the part\r\n    of the house where the disorder prevails. He then commands order in the\r\n    name of the house, and if the display of the mace is not sufficient to\r\n    restore order, the house may order the disorderly member or members to\r\n    be arrested.\r\n\r\n_Opening of a New Congress._--When a new Congress assembles, the house\r\nof representatives is called to order by the clerk of the preceding\r\nhouse. He then calls the roll of the members whose credentials or\r\ncertificates of election have been filed with him, and if a quorum is\r\npresent the house proceeds to the election of a speaker. The members of\r\neach political party represented in the house have already in caucus\r\nagreed upon their candidates, and they are now put in nomination before\r\nthe house by some member representing each party. Usually the action of\r\nthe caucus of the majority party is equivalent to an election, and the\r\nhouse has only to ratify its choice. In several instances, however, the\r\nelection of the speaker involved long and bitter contests. Thus in 1849,\r\n63 ballots were taken, and again in 1855-1856, 133 ballots were\r\nnecessary, and in each case a special rule was adopted permitting a\r\nplurality to elect.\r\n\r\nThe senate, on the other hand, is always an organized body. The\r\npresiding officer--the Vice President--at the opening of a new Congress\r\ncalls the senate to order, and the other officers, who hold during the\r\npleasure of the senate, resume their duties. The senate elects one of\r\nits own members as president _pro tempore_ to preside over its\r\ndeliberations during the absence of the Vice President or in case there\r\nis no Vice President, as has often happened.\r\n\r\n_The Oath of Office_ is usually administered to the speaker by the\r\noldest member in point of service,--called \"the Father of the\r\nHouse,\"--after which the speaker calls the other members to the\r\nfront--usually by state delegations--and administers the oath to them.\r\nNewly elected senators are escorted to the Vice President's desk,\r\nusually each by his state colleague, and are sworn in individually.\r\n\r\n_Adoption of the Rules._--After the administering of the oaths of\r\noffice, the house adopts the rules of the preceding Congress for\r\nregulating its procedure pending the adoption of new rules. Usually\r\nthis is a perfunctory performance and is carried through without\r\nopposition. At the opening of the sixty-first Congress, however, strong\r\nopposition was manifested toward the old rules and they were not\r\nreadopted until important amendments had been made in them.\r\n\r\nAfter the adoption of the rules each house appoints a committee to\r\nnotify the other of its readiness for business, and the two then appoint\r\na joint committee to inform the President of the United States that\r\nCongress is ready to receive any communication that he may be pleased to\r\nmake. The message of the President is then laid before each house and\r\nthe business of Congress proceeds.\r\n\r\n=Quorum.=--The Constitution provides that a majority of each house shall\r\nconstitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but that a smaller\r\nnumber may compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and\r\nunder such penalties as each house may prescribe.\r\n\r\n_Old Method of Counting a Quorum._--For a long time the method of\r\nascertaining whether a quorum was present was by a roll call. If the\r\nroll call failed to show the presence of a majority, the speaker ruled\r\nthat no quorum was present, even though every member of the house was\r\nactually in his seat. In the course of time this rule came to be\r\nfrequently abused by the minority for the purpose of preventing\r\nconsideration of measures to which it was opposed. Thus in January,\r\n1890, when the Republicans had only a slight majority in the house of\r\nrepresentatives, the Democrats were able, owing to the absence of a few\r\nRepublican members, to break a quorum and prevent consideration of\r\nimportant measures, by refusing to answer to the roll call. On a notable\r\noccasion in January, 1890, the roll call showed 161 yeas, 2 nays, and\r\nnot voting 165, the 165 who refused to vote being Democrats who were\r\nopposed to the taking up of a certain measure which the Republicans\r\ndesired to pass. Under the rules the roll call did not show a quorum\r\npresent, though more than two thirds of the members were actually in\r\ntheir seats.\r\n\r\n_The New Method._--The Republican majority therefore adopted a new rule,\r\nthat members who were actually in their seats were to be counted by the\r\nspeaker as present, no matter whether they voted or not. The action of\r\nSpeaker Reed in enforcing this rule raised a storm of protest by the\r\nminority, but he courageously stood his ground. The new rule was\r\nreadopted by the next Congress though the Democrats were then in the\r\nmajority, and it has been continued ever since with the exception of one\r\nor two Congresses when the old rule was reverted to. Much of the\r\nbusiness of Congress is really done, however, when there is no quorum\r\npresent, this being permissible so long as the point of \"no quorum\" is\r\nnot raised by any member.\r\n\r\n=Open Sessions.=--The ordinary sessions of both houses are open to the\r\npublic, though until 1794 the senate held its sessions in secret. When\r\nthe senate goes into executive session, as it may do when it is\r\nconsidering nominations of the President to public office or is engaged\r\nin considering treaties, the galleries are cleared, the doors closed,\r\nand its deliberations are conducted in secret, though, the results of\r\nits transactions usually leak out in some way.\r\n\r\n=Seating of Members.=--Until 1913 each member of each house was provided\r\nwith a seat and a desk, but in that year the desks were removed from the\r\nhouse of representatives in order to bring the members nearer together.\r\nPrior to that date, seats were assigned to members by lot at the opening\r\nof Congress, but the leader of the minority party and one or two other\r\nmembers of long service were usually allowed to select their seats\r\nwithout resort to the lot. The Democrats are seated on the right of the\r\nspeaker and the Republicans on the left. In the senate, each seat as it\r\nbecomes vacant is assigned to the member who first makes application for\r\nit to the presiding officer. The house chamber is so large that members\r\nin the rear seats are at a disadvantage, and speech making is carried on\r\nwith difficulty. In 1913, however, this inconvenience was diminished by\r\na reduction in the size of the hall by about one third of the floor\r\nspace.[32] The senate chamber is less spacious, and debate can be\r\nconducted with much greater satisfaction and effectiveness. It would be\r\na great advantage if the number of representatives could be reduced to\r\n250 or 300 so as to make the house less unwieldy, but there is little\r\nprobability that such a reform will ever be effected. If smaller in\r\nsize, the house could transact its business with more dispatch, give\r\nmore careful consideration to bills, and allow members a greater\r\nopportunity for discussion.\r\n\r\n    [32] Two large office buildings have been erected near the Capitol for\r\n    the use of members of both houses.\r\n\r\n=Committees.=--Obviously an assembly of more than 400 members cannot\r\nlegislate effectively as a whole; its work must be done largely by\r\ncommittees. To some committee every measure and every petition is\r\nreferred, as are also the various recommendations of the President. In\r\nthe sixty-seventh Congress (1921-1923) there were thirty-four standing\r\ncommittees in the senate and sixty in the house. Usually there are also\r\nseveral select committees, and occasionally a few joint committees. In\r\nthe senate, the committees vary in size from three to sixteen members;\r\nin the house from three to thirty-five.\r\n\r\nThe most important committees in the senate are those on appropriations,\r\ncommerce, finance, foreign relations, interstate commerce, judiciary,\r\nmilitary affairs, naval affairs, and public expenditures. The least\r\nimportant are those on disposition of useless papers, University of the\r\nUnited States, and Revolutionary claims, since there is little or no\r\nbusiness referred to them. The most important committees in the house\r\nare those on ways and means, appropriations, banking and currency,\r\npublic expenditures, foreign affairs, interstate and foreign commerce,\r\njudiciary, military affairs, naval affairs, public buildings and\r\ngrounds, rivers and harbors, and rules (twelve members now, formerly\r\nfive). The least important is that on the disposition of useless\r\npapers.[33]\r\n\r\n    [33] There are obvious objections to a system in which legislation\r\n    is necessarily framed to a large extent by committees. These\r\n    objections are thus stated by Mr. Bryce in his \"American\r\n    Commonwealth\":\r\n\r\n    1. It destroys the unity of the house.\r\n\r\n    2. It prevents the capacity of the best members from being brought to\r\n    bear on any one piece of legislation, however important.\r\n\r\n    3. It cramps debate.\r\n\r\n    4. It lessens the cohesion and harmony of legislation by allowing each\r\n    committee to go its own way with its own bills just as though it were\r\n    legislating for one planet and the other committees for others.\r\n\r\n    5. It gives facilities for the exercise of underhand and even corrupt\r\n    influence, and encourages \"log rolling.\"\r\n\r\n    6. It reduces responsibility by dividing it among different committees.\r\n\r\n    7. It lowers the interest of the nation in the proceedings of Congress.\r\n\r\n    8. It throws power into the hands of the chairmen of committees,\r\n    especially those which deal with finance and other great national\r\n    interests.\r\n\r\n    The chief advantage of such a system is that it enables the house to\r\n    deal with a far greater number of subjects than could be otherwise\r\n    dealt with, and thus makes possible the dispatch of a vast amount of\r\n    work, especially in killing off worthless bills.\r\n\r\n_Method of Choosing Committees._--In the senate committee assignments\r\nare nominally made by the senate itself, but in reality they are made\r\nby two committees on committees selected by a caucus of the members of\r\neach party, the recommendations of the two committees usually being\r\naccepted by the senate without debate. Both parties are represented on\r\neach committee, the dominant party, of course, being given a majority of\r\nthe places. Thus on a committee of thirteen members, the majority party\r\nis usually represented by eight members and the minority by five; on a\r\ncommittee of seventeen, the numbers are eleven and six respectively, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nIn the house of representatives, from the beginning until very recently,\r\nall the committees were appointed by the speaker, a power which gave him\r\ngreat influence in shaping and determining the course of legislation,\r\nsince he might constitute the committees with reference to their\r\nfriendliness or unfriendliness toward legislative measures that were\r\nreferred to them for investigation and report. In making committee\r\nassignments, however, the speaker was not entirely free to follow his\r\nown individual preferences. Thus the tradition of the house required\r\nthat he must take into consideration the claims of members whose service\r\nhad been long and distinguished, while political gratitude led him to\r\nreward with desirable committee assignments those to whom he was\r\nespecially indebted for his election as speaker. Seniority of committee\r\nservice was also taken into account when the chairmanship of an\r\nimportant committee became vacant, the next ranking member of the\r\ncommittee having a strong claim to be promoted to the vacancy. In 1911,\r\nhowever, the house, then controlled by the Democrats, adopted a rule\r\nproviding for the election of all standing committees by the house; thus\r\nmaking the method of choosing committees the same as in the senate.\r\n\r\nIn the house, the chairmanship of every committee, whether important or\r\nunimportant, is given to a member of the dominant party, and of course\r\nalso a majority of the other places on the committee, the proportion\r\nbetween the representation of the two parties being about the same as on\r\nthe senate committees.\r\n\r\n=Introduction and Reference of Bills.=--After the appointment of the\r\ncommittees the house is ready for the transaction of legislative\r\nbusiness. Bills are introduced by sending them, indorsed with the name\r\nof the introducer, to the presiding officer's desk, where the fact of\r\npresentation is entered on the journal and the bill is given a\r\nnumber.[34] Thus the first bill introduced at the beginning of a new\r\nCongress is designated as \"S. 1,\" if presented in the senate, and \"H. R.\r\n1,\" if presented in the house of representatives.\r\n\r\n    [34] Private bills are delivered to the clerk instead of to the\r\n    speaker. The distinction between a public bill and a private bill is\r\n    that the former deals with matters of general interest to the public,\r\n    while the latter deals with matters of interest to a single individual\r\n    or a small class. An example of a public bill is one regulating\r\n    commerce; an example of a private bill is one granting a pension to a\r\n    particular individual, or settling a claim of a person against the\r\n    government. A distinction is also made between a bill and a resolution.\r\n    A bill deals with matters of a more fundamental and permanent\r\n    character, while a resolution deals with matters of a more temporary\r\n    and transient nature. Resolutions are of two kinds: joint and\r\n    concurrent. A joint resolution is passed like a bill and requires the\r\n    approval of the President but is cast in slightly different form and\r\n    is used for making small appropriations, the creation of commissions,\r\n    proposal of amendments to the Constitution, resolutions to admit new\r\n    states, ordering of printing, and the like. A concurrent resolution is\r\n    used for expressing the opinion of Congress on some question of\r\n    interest to that body alone and is not submitted to the President for\r\n    his approval.\r\n\r\n_Reference to Committees._--The next step is to refer the bill to a\r\ncommittee for consideration, and in the meantime it is printed and\r\nplaced on the desks of members. Reference to the appropriate committee\r\nis usually made by the presiding officer, though the house may direct\r\nthat it shall be referred to a particular committee.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the mass of legislative projects referred to the committees\r\nmay be gained from the fact that in the sixtieth Congress 27,114 bills\r\nand resolutions were introduced into the two houses, and that of these,\r\n7,839 were reported by the committees to which they were referred. We\r\nhave here a good illustration of the necessity of the committee system,\r\nsince it would have been a physical impossibility for either house as a\r\nwhole to have considered even slightly so many bills. The committees\r\nsift out of the mass of proposed legislation such measures as they think\r\nworthy of enacting into law, and report their recommendations to the\r\nhouse as a whole.\r\n\r\n_Committee Hearings._--Committees charged with the consideration of\r\nimportant bills frequently hold public hearings at which interested\r\nparties may appear and present arguments for and against the measures\r\nunder consideration. Thus the ways and means committee of the house in\r\n1909 held public hearings at Washington for many weeks on the tariff\r\nbill, and scores of persons appeared to advocate lower or higher rates\r\non various articles on which duties were to be imposed. Frequently\r\nmembers who introduce bills appear before committees and urge favorable\r\naction. The more important committees in each house have a regular day\r\nin each week for meeting, and a few of those in the house of\r\nrepresentatives meet twice a week. Most of the committees, however, have\r\nno regular meeting day, being called together by their chairmen as\r\noccasion requires.\r\n\r\n_Forms of Committee Action._--The committee to which a bill is referred\r\nmay pursue any one of the following courses: (1) It may report the bill\r\nback to the house with a recommendation that it be passed; (2) it may\r\namend the bill and recommend that it be passed as amended; (3) it may\r\nthrow the bill aside and report an entirely new one in its place; (4) it\r\nmay report the bill unfavorably with a recommendation that it do not\r\npass; (5) it may \"pigeonhole\" the bill, that is, take no action on it at\r\nall, or report it so late in the session that no opportunity is allowed\r\nfor its consideration. The latter method of disposal, sometimes called\r\n\"smothering,\" is the fate that awaits the great majority of bills\r\nintroduced into Congress. The \"smothering\" of bills became the subject\r\nof so much complaint among members recently that the rules were amended\r\nso as to allow members to demand that their bills be reported to the\r\nhouse for consideration. The house, of course, may at any time instruct\r\na committee to report a bill for its action, but this is rarely done.\r\n\r\nThe report to the house is usually made by the chairman of the\r\ncommittee, or some one designated by him. Not infrequently the minority\r\nmembers of the committee also make a report opposing the recommendation\r\nof the majority. The committee system of legislation is so thoroughly\r\nestablished in Congress that a bill favorably reported stands an\r\nexcellent chance of being passed, while one adversely reported hardly\r\never passes.\r\n\r\n=Rules of Procedure.=--The Constitution provides that each house may\r\nframe its own rules of procedure, though it requires certain things to\r\nbe done in the interest of publicity and to insure a reasonable degree\r\nof careful deliberation. Thus each house is required to keep and publish\r\na journal which must show how motions are disposed of and the vote for\r\nand against measures voted on. It also requires that on demand of one\r\nfifth of the members present the yeas and nays upon a measure shall be\r\nentered upon the journal. The purpose of this provision is to enable a\r\nsmall number of members to put the house on record so that the people\r\nmay know how their representatives have voted on important measures.\r\n\r\n_Filibustering._--This requirement serves a useful purpose, but it is\r\nsometimes taken advantage of by the minority in \"filibustering,\" that\r\nis, in obstructing and delaying legislative proceedings. Thus a member\r\nmay move to adjourn or to take a recess and ask that the roll be called\r\nand the yeas and nays on the question be entered upon the journal. If\r\none fifth of the members join in the demand, the roll must be called and\r\nthe process may be repeated indefinitely. On one occasion in the\r\nfiftieth Congress the house remained in session eight days and nights,\r\nduring which time there were over one hundred roll calls on motions of\r\nthis kind.\r\n\r\n_The Rules of the House of Representatives_ have evolved gradually out\r\nof the experience of the house during its long existence, and have come\r\nto be so complex and elaborate that they are really understood by only a\r\nfew of the members, principally those who have had long experience in\r\nadministering them. They have been revised from time to time, but except\r\nin a few particulars they are essentially what they were in 1880. They\r\nprescribe a certain order of business for each day's work, which,\r\nhowever, may be departed from by unanimous consent of all the members or\r\nby the adoption of a \"special order\" reported by the committee on rules.\r\n\r\n_Committee of the Whole._--Revenue and appropriation bills are\r\nconsidered by the house of representatives in committee of the whole.\r\nWhen the house goes into committee of the whole, the speaker leaves the\r\nchair and calls some one else to preside in his place, and the presence\r\nof 100 members constitutes a quorum. Debate in committee of the whole\r\nis conducted rather informally, and greater freedom of discussion is\r\nallowed. It is when in committee of the whole that many of the lengthy\r\nspeeches printed in the _Congressional Record_ are supposed to be\r\ndelivered. In reality, however, only a small portion of these speeches\r\nare actually delivered, for members after addressing the house a few\r\nminutes often secure leave to print the remainder of their remarks.\r\nUnder this leave, members frequently print long speeches which have\r\nlittle or no relation to the subject under consideration but are\r\nintended for campaign purposes or for effect upon their constituents.\r\nThey are then franked through the mails to the voters throughout the\r\ndistrict which the member represents.\r\n\r\nIf the bill is a private bill, it is called up for consideration on\r\nFriday, which is private bill day. Most of the private bills are\r\nreported from the committees on claims and on pensions. Six or seven\r\nthousand such bills are passed by each Congress, and they constitute\r\nabout nine tenths of the entire number enacted.\r\n\r\n_Suspension of the Rules._--The regular order of business may be\r\ndeparted from at any time on the demand of privileged committees like\r\nthose on ways and means, appropriations, elections, rules, and a few\r\nothers which have a sort of right of way in the house, because of the\r\nurgent character of the matters with which they deal. Furthermore, by\r\nunanimous consent, often granted, a particular member is allowed to\r\nbring up a bill for consideration outside the regular order. Finally, on\r\ntwo Mondays in every month and during the last six days of the session,\r\nthe rules may be suspended by a two-thirds vote and measures to which\r\nthere is little objection may be quickly passed and thus the business of\r\nthe house expedited.\r\n\r\n=The Speaker and the Committee on Rules.=--No discussion of the\r\nprocedure of the house of representatives would be adequate without a\r\nconsideration of the part played by the speaker and the committee on\r\nrules in determining the course and character of legislation.\r\n\r\n_The English Speaker._--The speakership is an ancient office inherited\r\nfrom England, where it originated in the fourteenth century, and is an\r\noutgrowth of the practical necessities of legislative procedure. The\r\nAmerican speakership, however, differs widely from its English\r\nprototype. The speaker of the House of Commons has no such power in\r\nshaping legislation and controlling debate as does the American speaker.\r\nHe is in fact little more than a moderator with power to put motions,\r\nstate questions, and preserve order and decorum in debate. He is\r\nentirely impartial, with no party prejudices.\r\n\r\n_Powers of the American Speaker._--The American speaker, on the\r\ncontrary, is not merely the presiding officer of the house, but he is an\r\nactive party leader who seldom hesitates to give members of his own\r\nparty every possible advantage in the course of debate. His right to\r\nappoint the committees of the house until 1911 gave him increased power\r\nover the shaping of legislation, because of the fact that the\r\nlegislation of the house has come to be legislation largely by its\r\ncommittees. As has already been said, he gave the members of his own\r\nparty all the chairmanships of committees, as well as a majority of the\r\nplaces on every committee, so that they easily controlled the work of\r\nthe committees and hence of the house itself.\r\n\r\n_Recognition._--Moreover, his power of recognition, especially before\r\n1910, that is, the power to grant or withhold the right of discussion,\r\nenabled him to a large degree to prevent consideration of measures to\r\nwhich he was opposed and to cut off debate by members of the minority\r\nparty, joined with the Democrats and brought about several amendments\r\nto the rules, one of which is designed to do away with the chief source\r\nof complaint in regard to the power of recognition.\r\n\r\n_Committee on Rules._--Still another source of the speaker's power until\r\n1910 was his control of the committee on rules. The committee consisted\r\nof five members, two from the majority, two from the minority, and the\r\nspeaker, who was the fifth member. The speaker appointed his four\r\nassociates on the committee and thereby controlled its decisions. If he\r\nwished at any time to have the house take up a bill at the bottom of the\r\ncalendar instead of one at the top, or in any other respect depart from\r\nthe established order of procedure, he could call the committee together\r\n(it was the one committee that had the right to meet when the house was\r\nin session) and have it report what was called a \"special order,\" to\r\nthat effect--an order which the house usually adopted. The opposition to\r\nthe power of this committee and more especially to its domination by the\r\nspeaker led in 1910 to the adoption of a rule depriving the speaker of\r\nmembership on the committee, increasing its size from five to eleven,\r\nand taking the appointment of the committee out of his hands. Since then\r\nit has been elected by the house, and is, it is asserted, a more\r\nrepresentative committee.\r\n\r\n=Caucus Methods.=--It is a common practice for the representatives of\r\neach party to hold a caucus before the beginning of the debate upon an\r\nimportant measure, especially one of a political character, for the\r\npurpose of deciding what shall be the policy of the party toward the\r\nmeasure. Sometimes a rule is adopted by the caucus binding the members\r\nof the party to vote for or against the bill on the floor. Thus in 1913\r\ncaucuses of Democratic and representatives declared the tariff and\r\ncurrency bills to be party measures and pledged the members to vote for\r\nthe bills without amendment. This practice has been criticized on the\r\nground that where members have bound themselves to vote for a bill\r\nbefore it has been discussed on the floor, debate is useless since their\r\nminds are no longer open to argument. Perhaps a better procedure would\r\nbe to hold the caucus after the discussion has terminated but before the\r\nfinal vote is taken.\r\n\r\n=Final Stages of Procedure.=--The rules of the house of representatives\r\nrestrict the time which may be occupied by any member in debating a\r\nmeasure to one hour, and this cannot be exceeded except by unanimous\r\nconsent. If he chooses, he may yield a portion of his time to some other\r\nmember. The chairman who reports the bill usually opens the discussion.\r\nHe is followed by the ranking member of the minority on the committee,\r\nand these are followed by other members of the committee in their turn.\r\n\r\n_The Previous Question._--After the discussion has proceeded for a time,\r\ndebate may be terminated and the house brought to a vote by means of the\r\nprevious question, which is moved in the form, \"Shall the main question\r\nnow be put?\" When ordered by the house it ends debate and brings the\r\nhouse directly to a vote. This is an effective method for putting an end\r\nto useless discussion of a measure and taking the sense of the house on\r\nits passage. It is a common form of procedure in legislative bodies,\r\nthough the senate, until 1917, had no way of limiting debate.\r\n\r\n_Voting on Bills._--Questions on the passage of bills are put by the\r\nspeaker as follows: \"As many as are in favor say _aye_\"; \"As many as are\r\nopposed say _no_\"; the speaker determining the result by the sound of\r\nthe voices. If there is a doubt as to which side has prevailed, a\r\n\"division\" is called for, in which case those in favor rise and are\r\ncounted after which those who are opposed rise and are counted. If there\r\nis still doubt as to the result, \"tellers\" may be appointed to determine\r\nthe vote, in which case those in favor of the measure file between the\r\ntwo tellers, who make a careful count, after which those opposed pass\r\nbetween them and are similarly counted. If one fifth of the members\r\ndemand that a yea and nay vote be taken, the clerk must call the roll\r\nand record each member's vote, and the result is published in the\r\njournal so that the way in which a member votes may be known to his\r\nconstituents and all others who may be interested.\r\n\r\n_Passage by the Second House._--When a bill is passed by one house, it\r\nis signed by the presiding officer, after which it is transmitted to the\r\nother house, where it goes through practically the same stages of\r\nprocedure as described above. If the bill is passed by the other house\r\nwithout amendment it is \"enrolled,\" after which it is ready for the\r\nsignature of the President. If, however, a bill as passed by one house\r\nis amended by the other, it is customary to appoint a conference\r\ncommittee, consisting usually of three members from each house, to\r\ndiscuss the differences and suggest a basis of compromise. The committee\r\nusually recommends that each house recede from its position on certain\r\npoints, and the result is reported to each house, which usually accepts\r\nthe agreement and the bill is passed. Many important bills are finally\r\npassed in this way, though occasionally the two houses fail to reach an\r\nagreement and the bill fails.\r\n\r\n_Approval of the President._--When the bill is presented to the\r\nPresident he is allowed ten days to make up his mind as to whether he\r\nwill sign or disapprove it. If he refuses to sign it, he usually returns\r\nit to the house in which it originated, with a statement of his\r\nobjections, after which the house must proceed to reconsider it, and if\r\nit is passed by a two-thirds vote it is sent to the other chamber and if\r\nrepassed by it by a two-thirds vote it becomes a law notwithstanding the\r\nveto of the President. But in such cases the yeas and nays must be\r\nentered on the journal of each house so that the record may show that\r\nthe bill was properly passed. In case the President does not approve the\r\nbill and neglects to return it within ten days to the house in which it\r\noriginated, it becomes law in the same manner as if he had signed it,\r\nunless Congress should adjourn in the meantime so that it cannot be\r\nreturned, in which case it does not become law. As a large number of\r\nbills are usually sent to the President during the last ten days of the\r\nsession, an opportunity is thus afforded him for defeating bills by\r\nneither signing nor vetoing them. This method of defeating bills is\r\npopularly described by the term \"pocket veto,\" a procedure sometimes\r\nresorted to where the President does not approve a bill and yet does not\r\nwish to take the responsibility for positively vetoing it.\r\n\r\n=Procedure in the Senate.=--In the senate, partly by reason of its small\r\nsize, partly by reason of its permanence, and partly by reason of the\r\ntradition of senatorial courtesy, the procedure is somewhat different\r\nfrom that of the house of representatives. For example, the senate rules\r\nare permanent, that is, they continue from one Congress to another and\r\ndo not have to be adopted anew every two years.\r\n\r\n_The President of the Senate_ is little more than a moderator; indeed,\r\nhe may belong to a different political party from that which is in\r\ncontrol of the chamber--a situation that never happens in the house. He\r\ndoes not appoint the committees of the senate, and so has no power of\r\npredetermining the character of legislation. Moreover, he has no power\r\nto control debate through the power of recognition. The traditions of\r\nthe senate require that he shall recognize the first senator who rises\r\nto speak, and that he shall treat the members of both parties\r\nimpartially in according recognition for purposes of debate.\r\n\r\n_Unlimited Debate._--Until 1917 one of the usages of the senate was the\r\nright of unlimited debate. Owing to the small size of the senate, much\r\ngreater freedom of discussion is possible than in the house of\r\nrepresentatives, where there are more than four times as many members.\r\nDebate can also be conducted with much more ease and is much more\r\neffective, since the size of the hall is smaller and members are not\r\nunder the necessity of speaking at the top of their voices. While a\r\nmember of the house can rarely get an opportunity to deliver a speech\r\nand then only for a few minutes, a senator may usually speak as long as\r\nhe pleases. Advantage of this privilege is frequently taken by senators\r\nto deliver long speeches, not so much to convince their colleagues, as\r\nto get their views before the country at large or to make an impression\r\non their constituents at home. Under the rules as they were before 1917,\r\nthere was no limit to a senator's right to debate. The privilege was\r\nmade use of occasionally near the close of a session for \"filibustering\"\r\npurposes. Thus a few senators with strong lungs, large vocabularies, and\r\na liberal supply of documents from which to read, might consume the time\r\nof the senate for weeks and prevent it from acting on measures to which\r\nthey were opposed. Many times in our history a single senator has forced\r\nthe senate to abandon the consideration of important measures, by\r\nthreatening to consume the remaining time of the session by speech\r\nmaking. In the last days of one session of Congress, a senator from\r\nWisconsin spoke continuously for more than seventeen hours in an effort\r\nto prevent action on a currency bill. Near the end of the 64th Congress\r\n(March, 1917) a small group of senators filibustered to prevent the\r\nsenate from taking a vote on a bill to give the President authority to\r\narm American merchant vessels for defensive purposes, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that nearly all the other senators desired to pass the bill.\r\nShortly thereafter the senate adopted a new rule which makes it\r\npossible, by a two-thirds vote, to limit the debate on any measure to\r\none hour for each senator. The rule was applied in November, 1919, to\r\nbring to an end protracted discussion of the treaty of peace with\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. xiv.\r\n     BRYCE, The American Commonwealth (abridged edition), chs. xiii-xv.\r\n     HART, Actual Government, ch. xiv.

When, therefore, the\r\nframers of the Constitution came to deal with this subject, they wisely\r\nprovided that Congress should have power to levy and collect its own\r\nrevenues. The power conferred is almost absolute, the only limitations\r\nbeing that no duties shall be levied upon exports; that excises and\r\nduties levied on imports shall be uniform throughout the United States,\r\nthat is, they shall be the same in amount on a given article everywhere;\r\nand that where direct taxes are levied, they shall be apportioned among\r\nthe states on the basis of population.\r\n\r\n=Forms of Federal Taxes.=--The two general forms of taxes recognized by\r\nthe Constitution are direct and indirect taxes. The only direct taxes,\r\nin the sense of the Constitution of the United States, are poll taxes,\r\nand taxes on real or personal property, all of which are required to be\r\napportioned among the states on the basis of population, whenever they\r\nare levied.\r\n\r\nOn account of the obvious injustice of levying a tax on the states on\r\nthe basis of population, inasmuch as there might easily be twice as much\r\nproperty in one state as in another having the same population, this\r\nmethod has fallen into general disuse. Indeed, it has been resorted to\r\nby Congress only five times in our history, and then only for very short\r\nperiods in each case. It does not seem likely that this method of\r\nfederal taxation will ever again be resorted to.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the two principal sources of federal revenue have been\r\nduties on imports, and internal revenue, or excise taxes, on certain\r\narticles produced in this country.\r\n\r\n=Customs Duties.=--_Specific and Ad Valorem._--Customs duties are taxes\r\nlevied on articles imported into the United States from abroad. They are\r\nof two kinds, specific and _ad valorem_. Specific duties are those\r\nlevied on the articles according to their weight or measurement without\r\nregard to their value. Thus a duty of one and a half cents a pound on\r\nimported tin plate, or five cents a pound on dyestuffs, or ten cents a\r\nyard on silk would be specific. An _ad valorem_ tax is one levied with\r\nreference to the value of the article. Thus a duty of 50 per cent on the\r\nvalue of imported woolen goods is an example of an _ad valorem_ duty.\r\nSometimes both forms of duty are levied on the same article.\r\n\r\nIn favor of the specific duty is the ease of collection, since the\r\narticle has only to be weighed or measured and then assessed. But it is\r\noften inadequate, since one yard of cloth or one pound of dye may be\r\nmany times more valuable than another, and so with many other articles.\r\nOne practical objection to the _ad valorem_ method is the opportunity\r\nwhich is afforded for fraud in the matter of valuation, since in many\r\ncases it is difficult to ascertain the real value of the article taxed.\r\n\r\n_The Protective Tariff._--From the beginning of our existence as a\r\nnation, reliance upon customs duties as a chief source of revenue has\r\nbeen a part of our established policy. In 1921 the receipts from this\r\nsource were $308,025,102; and in many earlier years they were nearly\r\nhalf of the entire ordinary income of the national government. Great\r\ndiversity of opinion, however, has existed in regard to what articles\r\nshould be taxed and the amount that should be imposed. The Republican\r\nparty has always insisted upon a tariff not only for revenue but also\r\nfor protection to American industries and American labor against the\r\ncheap labor of the Old World. The Democratic party, on the other hand,\r\nhas generally opposed the protective feature and insisted upon a tariff\r\nprimarily for revenue.[35]\r\n\r\n    [35] But in 1916 a Democratic Congress laid a protective tariff on\r\n    imported dyestuffs to encourage a home industry.\r\n\r\n_The Preparation of a Tariff Bill_ devolves upon the ways and means\r\ncommittee of the house of representatives, where all revenue bills must\r\noriginate.[36] In 1916 Congress provided for the creation of a\r\nbi-partisan Tariff Commission to investigate the operation of tariff\r\nlaws and to make reports with a view to furnishing Congress with\r\ninformation for its guidance in the preparation of tariff bills.\r\n\r\n    [36] The senate, however, has the right to propose amendments. Thus the\r\n    tariff bill of 1894 was amended by the senate in nearly a thousand\r\n    particulars. Again, the tariff bill of 1909 was so altered by the\r\n    senate that it was in many respects a new bill, and the differences\r\n    between the two houses were settled by a conference committee.\r\n\r\n_The Maximum and Minimum Principle._--In 1909 Congress adopted for the\r\nfirst time the maximum and minimum principle of fixing tariff rates. The\r\nlaw provided for a maximum and a minimum rate on many articles and\r\nauthorized the President to apply the minimum rate to goods imported\r\nfrom countries which extend the same concession to articles imported by\r\ntheir citizens from the United States and to apply the maximum rate to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n_Reciprocity Treaties._--At various times in the past reciprocity\r\ntreaties have been negotiated with foreign countries by which it was\r\nprovided that lower rates should be levied on articles imported from\r\nsuch countries in return for reciprocal concessions of a similar kind\r\nfrom them; or that there should be free admission of articles by one\r\ncountry from the other.\r\n\r\n=Collection of Customs Duties.=--The collection of the customs duties is\r\npart of the work of the treasury department. The country is divided into\r\ncollection districts, in each of which there are one or more ports of\r\nentry and customhouses at which all imported goods must be landed. In\r\neach district there are a collector and a corps of appraisers, weighers,\r\ngaugers, naval officers, surveyors, and the like.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important port of entry in the United States is the city\r\nof New York, where the aggregate receipts for the year 1910 were two\r\nthirds of the entire amount received from customs duties in the United\r\nStates. Until recently a number of the collection districts, however,\r\nwere unimportant, and in a few the expenses of administration exceeded\r\nthe receipts. Thus the receipts of the Georgetown (S. C.) district in\r\n1910 were only $49.38, while the expenses were $265; the receipts of the\r\nRock Island (Ill.) district were $51.79 and the expenses $660; the\r\nreceipts of the Saco (Me.) district were $9.08 and the expenses $753.92.\r\nIn pursuance of an act of Congress passed in 1912, the President has\r\nrecently abolished or consolidated many of these districts, so that the\r\nnumber is now only 49, whereas formerly it was 120. For a long time the\r\nsecretary of the treasury had urged Congress to authorize this reform,\r\nmainly in the interest of economy, but it acted tardily.\r\n\r\nWhen goods are purchased abroad to be imported into the United States,\r\nthe importer files with the United States consul at the foreign port\r\nfrom which they are to be exported an invoice containing a list of the\r\ngoods and a statement of their value at the place where manufactured or\r\nproduced. The consul certifies to the correctness of the invoice and\r\nsends a copy to the collector of the port at which the goods are to be\r\nlanded.\r\n\r\n_Appraisals._--Upon arrival in the United States, the cargo is examined\r\nby the customs officers to see that it corresponds with the description\r\ncontained in the invoice. If it is found that the goods are undervalued\r\nthe value will be raised by the appraiser. If there is evidence of\r\nfraud, the goods will be confiscated or a heavy fine imposed on the\r\nimporter.[37]\r\n\r\n    [37] If the importer for any reason does not desire to remove his goods\r\n    immediately and pay the duty thereon, he may store them in a government\r\n    warehouse by giving a bond for double the amount of their value. He may\r\n    then withdraw them at any time within a year upon the payment of the\r\n    duties. If they are reëxported the payment of duties is not required.\r\n\r\nThere is a general board of appraisers to which appeals may be taken by\r\nthe importer on questions of valuation, and recently there has been\r\ncreated a United States court of customs appeals for the determination\r\nof various questions arising in the administration of the tariff laws.\r\n\r\n=Internal Revenue Taxes.=--The second important source of federal income\r\nis excise taxes, or what are popularly known as internal revenue duties,\r\nthat is, taxes on commodities produced in the United States.\r\n\r\n_The Receipts_ from internal revenue taxes as compared with those from\r\ncustoms duties were inconsiderable before the Civil War. In 1862,\r\nhowever, Congress passed a comprehensive internal revenue law which\r\nincreased the tax on liquors and levied a tax on tobacco, besides\r\nlicense taxes on various trades and occupations. So many articles were\r\ntaxed that the revenue from this source in 1866 amounted to more than\r\n$309,000,000, the largest sum collected in one year from internal\r\nrevenue taxes until 1915. In 1917, in consequence of the war, the rates\r\nof many taxes were increased and new taxes were levied on freight and\r\npassenger transportation, express charges, telegrams, insurance\r\npolicies, theater tickets, automobiles and many other articles, and a\r\ngreat variety of business transactions, such as stock transfers, bond\r\nissues, etc. For some purposes the taxes on incomes, profits, and\r\ninheritances (page 224) are called internal revenue. The following are\r\nthe principal items of internal revenue in the year ending June 30,\r\n1921:\r\n\r\n    Income and profits tax                            $3,228,137,673\r\n    Distilled spirits                                     82,623,428\r\n    Tobacco                                              255,219,385\r\n    Estate inheritance tax                               154,043,260\r\n    Tax on sales                                         282,222,065\r\n    Tax on tickets of admission                           95,890,650\r\n    Tax on corporations                                   81,525,652\r\n    Tax on bonds, stock issues and transfers, etc.        72,468,013\r\n    Tax on transportation, telegraph and telephone       301,512,413\r\n\r\n=Collection of Internal Revenue Taxes.=--For convenience in collecting\r\ninternal revenue taxes, the country is divided into some sixty\r\ndistricts, not by act of Congress as is the case with customs districts,\r\nbut by the order of the President. Sometimes several states are grouped\r\ninto one district; sometimes a state is divided into several districts.\r\nThus there are four districts in Illinois, six in New York, and five in\r\nKentucky. In each district there is a collector who acts under the\r\nsupervision of the United States Internal Revenue Commissioner. The\r\ncollection of internal revenue taxes is a much more simple task than the\r\ncollection of customs duties, and is done for the most part by the sale\r\nof stamps to the manufacturer, who is required to affix them on the\r\narticles taxed. In assessing the tax on most articles their value is not\r\ntaken into consideration, and hence there is less opportunity for\r\narbitrary action on the part of the government officials and of course\r\nless likelihood of controversy, than is the case with the administration\r\nof the customs laws.\r\n\r\n=Other Sources of Federal Revenue.=--Besides the receipts obtained from\r\ntariff duties and internal revenue taxes, there are a number of other\r\nsources of revenue such as those from the sale of public land, the tax\r\non national banks, fines and penalties for violations of the laws of the\r\nUnited States, profits on coinage, naturalization, immigration, patent\r\noffice and other fees, etc.\r\n\r\n_Income Taxes._--In very recent years (since 1918), the income tax, in\r\nits various forms, has become the greatest of all the sources of revenue\r\nfor the federal government.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1862 that Congress levied for the first time a tax on incomes,\r\nthe rate varying from five to ten per cent according to the amount of\r\nthe income, all incomes below $600 being exempt from the tax. In 1872,\r\nthe law was repealed; but a demand for reviving this method of taxation\r\ngradually increased, and it came to be a standing part of the national\r\nplatform of the Democratic party. Accordingly when the Democrats got\r\ncontrol of Congress in 1894, they enacted a law providing that all\r\nincomes in excess of $4,000 a year should be taxed at the rate of two\r\nper cent on the amount in excess of that figure. Shortly after the law\r\nwent into effect, however, the Supreme Court, overruling its former\r\ndecisions, decided, by a vote of five to four, that the law was\r\nunconstitutional, mainly on the ground that a tax on income from\r\nproperty was a direct tax in the sense of the Constitution, and not\r\nhaving been apportioned among the states according to their population\r\nwas null and void. Sentiment in favor of such a tax, however, steadily\r\ngrew, and in 1913 the constitutional impediment was removed by the\r\nsixteenth amendment.\r\n\r\nLater in the year Congress levied an income tax, in connection with an\r\nact to reduce tariff duties. The income tax is one per cent on each\r\nindividual's annual net income in excess of $3000 (or $4000 for husband\r\nand wife living together), plus an additional tax of one per cent on net\r\nincome over $20,000 and not exceeding $50,000, two per cent on net\r\nincome over $50,000 and not exceeding $75,000, and so on up to six per\r\ncent on net income over $500,000.\r\n\r\n_The Corporation Tax._--Congress in 1909 passed a law imposing a tax on\r\ncorporations, joint-stock companies, and associations, to the extent of\r\none per cent on the net income of each in excess of $5,000 a year. In\r\nthe year 1912 the tax yielded $28,583,259. The next year the exemption\r\nof $5,000 was removed, thus making the entire net income of corporations\r\nliable to the tax.\r\n\r\n_Inheritance Taxes._--During the Civil War and the war with Spain,\r\nCongress levied a tax on inheritances, and the permanent adoption of\r\nthis form of taxation was strongly recommended by President Roosevelt in\r\nhis annual messages, but owing largely to the fact that many of the\r\nstates have passed laws of this kind, the idea has never commended\r\nitself to Congress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUSTOMHOUSE, NEW YORK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE MINT AT PHILADELPHIA]\r\n\r\n=Deposit of United States Funds.=--The taxes collected by the national\r\ngovernment, together with its other funds, are kept partly in the\r\ntreasury and partly in the nine subtreasuries located at Baltimore,\r\nBoston, Chicago, Cincinnati, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, St.\r\nLouis, and San Francisco. In addition the secretary of the treasury is\r\nauthorized to designate national banks as depositories and to deposit\r\ncertain of the funds therein. In times of financial stringency or\r\nthreatened crises, this authority may be used by the secretary to\r\nrelieve the money market, by distributing the public funds among the\r\ndepositories.\r\n\r\n=Federal Appropriations and Expenditures.=--Having studied the sources\r\nof federal revenues, we come now to the subject of expenditures. Revenue\r\nbills are prepared, as we have seen, by the ways and means committee of\r\nthe house of representatives. At first the appropriations of Congress\r\nwere embodied in a single bill prepared by the committee on\r\nappropriations, but as the operations of the government expanded, the\r\nappropriations came to be embodied in a number of bills, sixteen in\r\n1920, prepared by nine different committees. The committee on\r\nappropriations was responsible only for the half dozen more general\r\nappropriation bills, while other committees prepared the the bills\r\nappropriating large amounts for the army, navy, diplomatic service, post\r\noffice, Department of Agriculture, District of Columbia, Indian service,\r\nand improvement of rivers and harbors. In 1921, however, the committee\r\non appropriations was enlarged and again entrusted with the preparation\r\nof all the various appropriation bills, the house thus returning to the\r\nearlier system of a single committee responsible for all expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe growth of national expenditures has been rapid. The appropriations\r\nfor 1916 reached the unprecedented amount of $1,637,583,682; those for\r\nthe period of the war (1917-1918), $32,427,000,000, including\r\n$9,000,000,000 loaned to European allies. In 1921, the appropriations\r\nwere reduced to about $5,500,000,000.\r\n\r\n=The National Debt.=--Whenever the revenues of the government are\r\ninsufficient to pay its expenses recourse must be had to increased taxes\r\nor loans. In time of peace the ordinary revenues ought to be sufficient\r\nto meet expenses, but when extraordinary expenses must be incurred as is\r\nthe case when war breaks out, or foreign territory is purchased, or some\r\ngreat public work is to be constructed such as the digging of the Panama\r\nCanal, the government must have recourse to the borrowing power. The\r\nConstitution of the United States expressly confers upon Congress the\r\npower to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and no\r\nlimitations whatever are placed on the exercise of the power, such as\r\nare generally imposed on state legislatures by the state constitutions.\r\n\r\n_United States Bonds._--The usual mode by which the government borrows\r\nmoney is by the issue of its bonds, obligations similar in most respects\r\nto promissory notes made by individuals. A government bond is simply a\r\npromise to pay a certain sum at a particular time and with interest at a\r\ncertain rate. The bonds issued by the United States government are of\r\ntwo kinds: \"registered\" and \"coupon\" bonds. A registered bond is made\r\nout to the person who purchases it; a record is kept of it at the\r\ntreasury department, and when it is transferred to another person the\r\nrecord must be changed so as to show the new owner.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of such a bond is that if it is accidentally destroyed or\r\nlost the owner suffers no loss. The chief disadvantage is the difficulty\r\nin transferring it. A coupon bond is one which has interest coupons\r\nattached to it, which may be clipped off and presented to the treasury\r\nfor payment as the interest becomes due. The government keeps no record\r\nof the owner and it may be transferred as any other personal property.\r\nIf a coupon bond is lost or destroyed, however, the owner cannot collect\r\nthe amount of the bond. United States bonds are issued in various\r\ndenominations and for periods of time which vary widely. Usually bonds\r\nare sold to the highest bidder, but occasionally they are disposed of by\r\nnegotiation with capitalists on the best terms that can be secured.\r\nDuring President Cleveland's administration $262,000,000 of bonds were\r\nsold to New York capitalists in this way.\r\n\r\n_Rate of Interest._--The rate of interest which United States bonds pay\r\nhas varied from time to time. The Revolutionary War debt bore six per\r\ncent, and so did most of the civil war bonds. After the Civil War,\r\nhowever, the rate at which the government was able to borrow steadily\r\ndeclined, largely because of the desire of national banks to secure\r\nUnited States bonds (page 232). The rate of interest on bonds now\r\noutstanding ranges from two to five per cent.\r\n\r\n_Growth of the National Debt._--When the Constitution went into effect,\r\nthe national debt, including the war debts of the states which were\r\nassumed by the national government, amounted to about $127,000,000; but\r\nby 1836 the debt was extinguished and there was a surplus in the\r\ntreasury which was distributed among the states. The enormous expenses\r\nof the Civil War, however, had to be met largely by loans, and at the\r\nclose of the conflict (1866) the interest-bearing debt was more than\r\n$2,000,000,000. During the next twenty years the debt was reduced to\r\nabout $600,000,000, but this amount was increased between 1895 and 1899\r\nto about $945,000,000 on account of bond issues to replenish the gold\r\nreserve and to meet a portion of the expenses of the war with Spain. On\r\nJune 30, 1915, the interest-bearing debt stood at $969,759,090. In\r\n1917-19 five bond issues aggregating more than $21,000,000,000 were made\r\non account of the war with Germany.\r\n\r\nIn addition there is also a non-interest-bearing debt of $389,407,800,\r\nof which $346,681,016 consists of treasury notes issued during the Civil\r\nWar, and popularly known as \"greenbacks\" from their color. The national\r\ninterest-bearing debt of the United States on June 30, 1921, amounted to\r\nabout $24,000,000,000. The total debt of England is now about\r\n$40,000,000,000, that of France about $46,000,000,000, and that of\r\nGermany over $30,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n=The Monetary System.=--The coining of money is now regarded everywhere\r\nas a proper if not a necessary function of government. Under the\r\nArticles of Confederation, this power was possessed by the states as\r\nwell as by Congress, though in fact it was exercised by neither. The\r\nframers of the Constitution decided that the most effective way of\r\nsecuring a uniform system of money would be to place the whole matter\r\nunder the control of the national government, and so Congress alone was\r\ngiven the power of coinage. At the same time, remembering how the states\r\nhad before 1789 flooded the country with paper money which in some\r\ninstances had become worthless, the framers of the Constitution wisely\r\ndecided to prohibit them from issuing bills of credit, that is, paper\r\ndesigned to circulate as money. Likewise they were forbidden to make\r\nanything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in the payment of\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\n_The Acts of 1792 and 1834._--As soon as the new government under the\r\nConstitution had gone into operation, steps were taken to provide a\r\nsystem of metallic currency. In 1792, an act was passed providing for\r\nthe establishment of a mint at Philadelphia and for the striking of both\r\ngold and silver coins.[38] The gold coins were to be the double eagle,\r\nthe eagle, the half eagle, and the quarter eagle; the silver coins were\r\nto be the dollar, the half dollar, the quarter, the dime, and the half\r\ndime.[39] As the market value of a given quantity of gold bullion was\r\nthen about fifteen times that of silver, the weight of the silver coins\r\nwas made fifteen times that of the corresponding gold coins. But as the\r\nvalue of gold bullion presently began to increase in comparison with\r\nsilver, it was necessary to readjust the ratio so as to keep both in\r\ncirculation, and so in 1834 the weight of gold coins was reduced and the\r\nratio made sixteen to one.\r\n\r\n    [38] Later mints were established at Denver, San Francisco, and New\r\n    Orleans. Assay offices for refining and determining the purity of\r\n    bullion have been established at New York, St. Louis, Deadwood, Helena,\r\n    Boise, Carson City, Salt Lake, Seattle, and Charlotte, North Carolina.\r\n    To give strength and hardness to gold and silver coins an alloy of\r\n    copper equal to one tenth of their weight is added.\r\n\r\n    [39] In addition to the gold and silver coins mentioned above are the\r\n    five cent piece (nickel) and the one cent piece (copper).\r\n\r\n_Demonetization of the Silver Dollar._--But soon the increase in the\r\nsupply of gold again disturbed the ratio, making the silver coins worth\r\nmore as metal than as money; and as the difficulty of keeping up the\r\nadjustment seemed insuperable, Congress decided to abandon the attempt\r\nand so in 1873 the silver dollar was practically \"demonetized,\" that is,\r\nwas dropped from the list of coins, and other silver coins were made\r\nsubsidiary, that is, their weight was decreased so that the metal in\r\nthem was worth less than their face value, and they were made legal\r\ntender for small sums only.[40]\r\n\r\n    [40] At the present time all gold coins and the silver dollar are legal\r\n    tender for all sums. The smaller coins, however, are legal tender for\r\n    small sums only, the amount ranging from twenty-five cents in the case\r\n    of the nickel and copper pieces to $10 in the case of the silver coins.\r\n\r\n_Later Acts._--The opposition to the demonetization of the silver\r\ndollar, however, became so great that it was restored by the act of\r\n1878 and made full legal tender. But the free coinage of silver was not\r\nrestored; the act required the government to purchase and coin not less\r\nthan $2,000,000 nor more than $4,000,000 worth of silver bullion per\r\nmonth. In the mean time the market value of silver had declined until\r\nthe amount of silver in a silver dollar was worth less than eighty cents\r\nin gold, and it was believed that the act of 1878 by increasing the\r\ndemand for silver would restore its market value. This, however, did not\r\nhappen, and the market value of silver went on decreasing until at one\r\ntime the amount of silver in a dollar was worth only about forty-six\r\ncents in gold. In 1890 Congress increased the use of silver by requiring\r\nthe secretary of the treasury to purchase monthly four and one half\r\nmillion ounces of silver and pay for it with treasury notes which were\r\nredeemable in coin at the option of the secretary and which were to be\r\ncanceled or destroyed when so redeemed. This act was repealed in 1893,\r\nsince which date the government has purchased very little silver bullion\r\nfor coinage purposes.\r\n\r\n=Free Coinage.=--In determining its coinage policy, the government might\r\nfollow either of two methods: (1) It might coin any and all bullion\r\npresented by its owners at the mints, or (2) it might purchase its own\r\nbullion and coin only so much as the necessities of trade or other\r\nconsiderations might require. The former policy is that of free coinage;\r\nit is also unlimited coinage since it involves the coinage of all\r\nbullion offered, without limit. From the very first, the practice of the\r\ngovernment in regard to gold has been that of free and unlimited\r\ncoinage; that is, any owner of gold bullion may take it to a mint and\r\nhave it coined without charge except for the cost of the alloy. Prior to\r\n1873, the same policy was followed in regard to silver, thus maintaining\r\nin theory at least a bimetallic or double standard. In 1873, however,\r\nCongress abandoned the policy of free coinage of silver and adopted the\r\nsingle gold standard. From then until now the government has coined no\r\nsilver bullion for private owners.\r\n\r\n=Paper Currency.=--In addition to the metallic money described above\r\nthere is a vast amount of paper currency in the United States. This\r\ncurrency may be classified under five different heads.\r\n\r\n_Greenbacks._--First, there are the $346,681,016 of old United States\r\nnotes or \"greenbacks,\" already described. They were issued during the\r\nCivil War, they bear no interest, and are redeemable in coin upon the\r\ndemand of the holder. Since 1878 the practice of the government has been\r\nnot to retire them as they are redeemed but to reissue them and keep\r\nthem in circulation.\r\n\r\n_Gold and Silver Certificates._--Second, there is a large amount of\r\ncurrency in the form of gold and silver certificates. The law under\r\nwhich such currency is issued provides that any owner of gold or silver\r\ncoin may deposit it in the treasury and receive in exchange an\r\nequivalent amount of certificates. They are more convenient to handle\r\nthan coin, and are equally valuable for paying debts and purchasing\r\ncommodities. On the 1st of July, 1921, the amount of gold certificates\r\nin circulation was $452,174,709; the amount of silver certificates,\r\n$201,534,213. These two forms of currency constitute one eighth of our\r\nentire stock of money in circulation.\r\n\r\n_Sherman Treasury Notes._--A third form of paper money is the so-called\r\nSherman treasury notes issued in pursuance of the act of 1890 already\r\ndescribed. On July 1, 1921, there were $1,576,184 of them in\r\ncirculation. The law declares that they shall be redeemed in _coin_,\r\nthat is, either gold or silver, at the option of the government. To\r\nprevent the threatened depletion of the gold reserve[41] and provide the\r\nnecessary gold with which to redeem the increasing issues of Sherman\r\ntreasury notes, bond issues aggregating $262,000,000 were issued during\r\nthe years 1894 and 1895. By the act of 1900 the policy of maintaining a\r\nsingle gold standard was definitely adopted by Congress, and it was\r\nprovided that greenback notes, Sherman treasury notes, and other\r\nsecurities of the government should be redeemable in gold.\r\n\r\n    [41] The gold reserve is a sum of money set aside for the purpose of\r\n    redeeming the old \"greenbacks\" or United States notes. An effort has\r\n    always been made to keep the amount above $100,000,000.\r\n\r\n_National Bank Notes._--The fourth class of paper money is national bank\r\ncurrency. A national bank, unlike other banks, not only receives\r\ndeposits and makes loans and performs the other functions of banks, but\r\nalso issues notes which circulate as money. There are about 8,200\r\nnational banks in the United States, with an aggregate capital of more\r\nthan $1,000,000,000 and with a total circulation of $729,550,513 of\r\nnotes outstanding (July 1, 1921).\r\n\r\n_Federal Reserve Notes._--The federal reserve banks, established under\r\nthe act of 1913, not only receive deposits and make loans to other\r\nbanks, but also have power to issue federal reserve notes which\r\ncirculate as money. The amount in circulation July 1, 1921, was\r\n$2,680,494,274. This constitutes by far the largest amount of paper\r\nmoney in existence.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of money of all kinds in circulation on July 1, 1921,\r\namounted to $5,776,437,473, or a per capita circulation of about $53.40.\r\n\r\n=The National Bank System.=--Any number of persons, not less than five,\r\nmay organize a national bank, the amount of capital required depending\r\nupon the population of the town or city where the bank is located.\r\nPrior to 1914 the organizers were obliged to purchase and deposit with\r\nthe government, bonds of the United States equal to one fourth of the\r\ncapital of the bank; now they may do so if they wish. The comptroller of\r\nthe currency then delivers to the bank notes equal in amount to the par\r\nvalue of the bonds deposited. These notes when properly signed by the\r\npresident and cashier of the bank may then be loaned by the bank or\r\notherwise issued as currency, for though not a legal tender they are\r\ncommonly used as money. It must also be remembered that the United\r\nStates bonds deposited with the government remain the property of the\r\nbank and it receives the interest on them just as any other owner would.\r\n\r\n_Advantages of National Bank Currency._--If a national bank fails,\r\ndepositors may lose their money just as depositors of money in other\r\nbanks may, but the holder of a national bank note does not, for whenever\r\na bank is unable to redeem its notes, the comptroller of the currency\r\nmay sell the bonds which it has on deposit with him, and with the\r\nproceeds redeem its notes. Hence a bank note is as safe as any other\r\nform of currency. Moreover, national banks are subject to frequent and\r\ncareful examination by government examiners, and failures among them\r\noccur with less frequency than among other banks.\r\n\r\n=Federal Reserve Banks.=--By an important act passed in 1913 Congress\r\nprovided for the creation of a series of federal reserve banks to be\r\nlocated in different parts of the country. The committee intrusted with\r\nthe matter divided the United States into twelve districts, each of\r\nwhich is to have one federal reserve bank, located respectively in the\r\nfollowing cities: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond,\r\nAtlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San\r\nFrancisco. In each district the national banks are required to become\r\nmembers of the federal reserve association, and to subscribe for its\r\nstock. Other banks may do so, by conforming to certain requirements.\r\n\r\nFederal reserve banks are under the supervision and control of a federal\r\nreserve board consisting of the secretary of the treasury, the\r\ncomptroller of the currency, and five other members appointed by the\r\nPresident. The federal reserve notes which they issue are guaranteed by\r\nthe United States government, and are secured by commercial paper--notes\r\nand drafts--deposited in the treasury. It is expected that these banks\r\nwill provide a more adequate supply of money and credit when the need is\r\ngreatest, as during the crop-moving season, and at the same time give\r\ngreater stability to the business of banking.\r\n\r\n=Federal Land Banks.=--In 1916 Congress passed the so-called rural\r\ncredits law, which provides for the organization of a series of banks\r\nfor lending money to farmers at low rates of interest and for long\r\nperiods of time. Such banks are under the supervision of the federal\r\nfarm loan board consisting of the secretary of the treasury and four\r\nother members.\r\n\r\n     =References.=--ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, pp. 81-89,\r\n     104-118.

That power remained entirely with\r\nthe states. Each state accordingly made such regulations as it saw fit,\r\nwithout regard to the general welfare. It was this want of commercial\r\npower on the part of Congress that contributed as much as anything else\r\nperhaps to the downfall of the Confederation. The Constitution as\r\nfinally adopted gave Congress the exclusive power to regulate commerce\r\namong the states, with foreign countries, and with the Indian tribes,\r\nwhich were then treated somewhat as foreign nations for certain\r\npurposes. The only limitations placed on the power of Congress in this\r\nrespect were that no duty should be levied on goods exported from any\r\nstate; that no preference should be given by any regulation of commerce\r\nor revenue to the ports of one state over those of another; and that no\r\nvessels bound to or from one state should be obliged to enter, clear, or\r\npay duties in another.\r\n\r\n=Regulation of Foreign Commerce.= In pursuance of the power to regulate\r\ncommerce with foreign nations Congress has enacted a large amount of\r\nlegislation relating to tonnage duties, duties on imports, quarantine,\r\nimmigration, the importation of adulterated foods, wines, teas, and\r\nother food products, the conduct of navigation, the construction and\r\ninspection of ships carrying passengers, pilotage, clearances, the\r\nprotection of shipping, the rights of seamen, the registration and\r\ninsurance of vessels, life-saving appliances, the use of wireless\r\ntelegraph apparatus, and the like. It was also in pursuance of this\r\npower that the Embargo Act was passed in 1807 and the Nonintercourse Act\r\nin 1809--both of which were in effect prohibitions rather than\r\nregulations of commerce.\r\n\r\n_The Navigation Laws_ prescribe with great detail how vessels registered\r\nunder the American flag shall be constructed and equipped for the\r\ncomfort and safety of their crews and passengers; how they shall be\r\ninspected; rules that shall be observed to avoid collisions, how signals\r\nshall be displayed, etc.; the forms of papers vessels must carry; how\r\nthe wages of seamen shall be paid, the nature of their contracts, etc.\r\n\r\n_The Tonnage Laws_ prescribe the rate of tonnage duties that shall be\r\nlevied on vessels entering American ports. Tonnage duties, as the name\r\nindicates, are a form of taxation calculated on the basis of the tonnage\r\nadmeasurement of the vessel; they are levied on American as well as\r\nforeign ships, though the rate is higher on the latter than on the\r\nformer. Sometimes they have been higher on the vessels of some foreign\r\ncountries than on those of others, in which case they are known as\r\ndiscriminating tonnage duties. Such discriminating duties are employed\r\nfor the purpose of favoring the commerce of those nations which extend\r\nus commercial privileges and for shutting out or restricting that of\r\nnations which discriminate against our trade. In pursuance of the power\r\nto regulate foreign commerce, Congress prohibits foreign vessels from\r\nengaging in the coasting trade, and permits only citizens of the United\r\nStates to serve as masters on vessels registered under the American\r\nflag. Formerly only American-built vessels could be registered, but in\r\n1914, after the outbreak of the great war in Europe, Congress passed an\r\nact allowing ships built in foreign yards, when owned by American\r\ncitizens, to be registered under the American flag; and more than 100\r\nsuch vessels have been so registered.\r\n\r\n_Immigration._--By virtue of the commerce power Congress has enacted a\r\nseries of immigration laws imposing restrictions on the coming of\r\nimmigrants to our shores. For a long time immigration from Europe was\r\nencouraged rather than restricted, but within recent years so many\r\nundesirable persons have found their way to America that Congress has\r\nbeen led to pass various laws designed to shut out the worst of them and\r\nadmit only the desirable ones.[42]\r\n\r\n    [42] According to the report of the commissioner general of\r\n    immigration, 1,218,480 immigrants arrived in the United States during\r\n    the year 1914. Of those who applied for admission into the country,\r\n    more than 33,000 were turned back. In 1916 the number of arrivals\r\n    dropped to 366,748; in 1920 it was 430,000.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the immigration laws exclude convicts, insane persons,\r\npaupers and those likely to become paupers, persons suffering with\r\ndangerous, loathsome, and contagious diseases; epileptics, persons\r\nafflicted with tuberculosis, idiots, feeble-minded persons, polygamists,\r\nanarchists, immoral persons, and others of this character.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, what are known as alien contract laborers are\r\nprohibited from entering the United States, that is, persons who come\r\nunder contract already entered into, to perform labor, whether skilled\r\nor unskilled. The law excluding this class was enacted in obedience to\r\nthe demands of the union laborers of the United States, who did not wish\r\nto be subjected to competition with foreign laborers specially imported\r\nfor the purpose. Actors, teachers, lecturers, and members of other\r\nprofessions are exempted from the law, and so are skilled laborers if\r\ndomestic laborers of like kind are not available in the United States.\r\n\r\nA third group of excluded classes are Chinese laborers, the immigration\r\nof whom was first prohibited in 1882.\r\n\r\nA law of 1916 provides, with certain exceptions, that no alien shall be\r\nadmitted unless he can read English or some other language or dialect. A\r\nlaw passed in 1921 limits the number of immigrants who may enter\r\nannually from each country, to 3 per cent of the number already in the\r\nUnited States, or a total of about 356,000.\r\n\r\nThere is now a head tax of eight dollars levied upon every immigrant who\r\nis admitted. Persons whose steamship passage has been paid by others or\r\nwho have been otherwise assisted to come are not allowed to enter. When\r\nan immigrant has been denied admission by the commissioner of\r\nimmigration at the port at which he has landed, he may take an appeal to\r\na special board of inquiry. If the decision of this board is against him\r\nhe may appeal to the United States commissioner-general of immigration,\r\nand finally to the secretary of the department of labor. If the final\r\ndecision is against him, the steamship on which he sailed is required at\r\nits own expense to transport him to the port from which he sailed.\r\n\r\n_Quarantine._--In pursuance of the power to regulate foreign commerce,\r\nCongress has enacted a volume of legislation in regard to quarantine and\r\nmedical inspection of ships and their passengers coming from foreign\r\nports. In most instances inspections are made by the United States\r\nconsul at the port from which the vessel sails, and a bill of health is\r\nfurnished the master of the vessel, but in some Asiatic and South\r\nAmerican ports regular medical inspectors are stationed. At various\r\nports along the coast, national quarantine stations have been\r\nestablished at which inspections of incoming vessels are made and at\r\nwhich they may be detained if found to have on board persons suffering\r\nfrom dangerous contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n_Pure Food._--Congress has also provided for the inspection of foods\r\nimported from abroad. Whenever a vessel is found to have on board impure\r\nor adulterated foods or teas, it is forbidden to land the cargo or is\r\nallowed to land it only after certain conditions are complied with such\r\nas the change of labels to correspond with the actual contents of\r\npackages. In this way an attempt is made to protect the American\r\nconsumer against impure and unwholesome food products shipped here from\r\nforeign ports.\r\n\r\n=Interstate Commerce= has been interpreted to include the carriage of\r\npassengers from one state to another; the transportation of commodities\r\nof whatsoever character, including lottery tickets, obscene literature,\r\nand any other objects which may be the subject of transportation; and\r\nthe transmission of ideas or information by telegraph or telephone from\r\na point in one state to a point in another. In short, interstate\r\ncommerce means not only transportation and traffic in articles but\r\nintercourse and communication by the modern devices for transmitting\r\nthought; and the power to prescribe the conditions under which such\r\nintercourse may be carried on across state lines belongs to Congress.[43]\r\nCongress controls also the coasting trade between parts of the same\r\nstate and the traffic on all rivers which flow into the ocean or the\r\nGreat Lakes and thus constitute highways of interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n    [43] Under the commerce power. Congress has also enacted the white\r\n    slave law, and an act restricting the killing of birds that migrate\r\n    from one state to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMMIGRATION STATION, ELLIS ISLAND, NEW YORK HARBOR]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMMIGRANTS READY TO START WEST]\r\n\r\n_Power Retained by the States._--Nevertheless it is often difficult in a\r\nparticular case to draw the line between acts which regulate interstate\r\ncommerce and acts which merely affect it without regulating it. The\r\nSupreme Court in a long line of decisions has held that the states not\r\nonly have complete power of control over all commerce originating and\r\nending within their limits but that they may also enact legislation for\r\nthe protection of the public health, safety, good order, and morals of\r\ntheir people even when such legislation affects commerce among the\r\nstates, the only restriction being that such legislation must be\r\nreasonable and must not amount to a direct interference with interstate\r\ntraffic. The right of the states in this respect is known as the _police\r\npower_--a power which is very extensive and of which they cannot be\r\ndeprived by Congress. Thus they may enact reasonable quarantine laws\r\nforbidding the entrance into their territory of diseased persons from\r\nother states or the importation of diseased live stock. Likewise they\r\nmay limit the speed of interstate trains running through their towns,\r\nmay require railroads to provide gates at crossings, safety appliances\r\nfor cars, and the like.\r\n\r\n_The Original Package Doctrine._--A state, however, prior to 1920, could\r\nnot without the consent of Congress prohibit the importation of liquor\r\nin original packages into its territory from other states, although it\r\nmight be a prohibition state.[44] But Congress itself, by an act passed\r\nin 1913, prohibited the transportation of intoxicating liquors into\r\nstates having prohibition laws.\r\n\r\n    [44] Early in 1919 the eighteenth amendment to the federal constitution\r\n    was adopted, prohibiting the liquor traffic after one year.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the states cannot impose taxes on passengers passing through\r\ntheir territory bound for points in other states, or require interstate\r\ntrains to stop at county seats, or impose taxes on telegraph messages\r\nsent to points in other states, or on bills of lading of freight\r\ndestined to points in other states, or on goods intended for\r\nexportation, and so on.\r\n\r\n=Regulation of Interstate Railway Traffic.=--For a long time Congress\r\ntook no action toward regulating railway traffic among the states, thus\r\nleaving the railroads free to carry on their business as they pleased,\r\nregardless of the interest of the public whom they served. But with the\r\nenormous development of the railway system of the country gross evils\r\nbegan to creep in, in the form of excessive rates, discriminations,\r\ncombinations for the suppression of competition, inadequate provision\r\nfor the safety of passengers, etc., in consequence of which a widespread\r\ndemand grew up for legislation bringing the railroads under governmental\r\ncontrol. The outcome of this agitation was the interstate commerce act\r\nof 1887, the provisions of which have been amended and extended by\r\nseveral subsequent acts, notably the Elkins act of 1903, the railway\r\nrate law of 1906, and the interstate commerce law of 1910.\r\n\r\n_Interstate Commerce Commission._--The law of 1887 created an interstate\r\ncommerce commission which now consists of eleven members appointed by\r\nthe President and paid a salary of $12,000 a year each, which commission\r\nhas general supervision of the execution of the several acts mentioned\r\nabove. It hears complaints against the railroads, makes investigations\r\nupon petition, and to this end may summon witnesses and compel the\r\nproduction of papers and records, and conduct hearings. If, after an\r\ninvestigation, it finds that the law is being violated by a railroad\r\ncompany, it may request the proper federal authorities to institute a\r\nprosecution of the offending company, and the law requires that such a\r\nprosecution shall be made. For a long time the commission had no power\r\nto fix rates, but only the negative right to say that a given rate was\r\nunjust and unreasonable. But by the act of 1906 it was given the power,\r\nafter a full hearing, to determine and prescribe just and reasonable\r\nmaximum rates and charges, as well as to prescribe regulations for the\r\nconduct of railway traffic.\r\n\r\n_The Laws Now in Force_ prescribe that all railway rates and charges for\r\ncarrying freight and passengers must be just and reasonable; that no\r\nrebates, drawbacks, or special rates shall be granted to particular\r\nshippers; that no discriminations shall be made as to rates or service\r\nto certain persons or places; that no free passes, with certain\r\nspecified exceptions, shall be granted; that no greater charges shall be\r\nmade for a \"short haul\" than for a \"long haul\"; that no railroads shall\r\nbe allowed to transport commodities which they are engaged in producing,\r\nwith certain exceptions; that competing railways shall not be allowed to\r\npool their freight or earnings; that schedules showing rates, fares, and\r\ncharges shall be published and kept open for inspection and cannot be\r\nchanged except after thirty days' notice to the commission; that all\r\nrailroads shall keep their accounts according to a uniform system\r\nprescribed by the commission; and that they shall make annually to the\r\ncommission a full and complete report of their business and earnings.\r\n\r\nAn important extension of the interstate commerce act was made in 1906,\r\nwhen express and sleeping car companies, pipe lines used for\r\ntransporting oil from one state to another, and telegraph, telephone,\r\nand cable companies engaged in sending messages from one state to\r\nanother or to foreign countries, were brought under the operation of the\r\nlaw and their business subjected to the same conditions and restrictions\r\nas those applying to railroads. By an act of 1912 railroads were\r\nprohibited from owning, controlling, or having any interest in competing\r\nwater carriers, and by an act of 1913 provision was made for preparing a\r\nvaluation of all railroads in the United States.\r\n\r\nCongress has also enacted laws requiring interstate railroads to equip\r\ntheir cars with automatic couplers and other safety appliances, fixing\r\nthe liability of railway employers for injuries sustained by railway\r\nemployees, encouraging the arbitration of railway strikes, and\r\nestablishing an eight-hour work day on railways (1916). An act excluding\r\nthe products of child labor from interstate commerce (1916) was declared\r\nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of acts of Congress passed in 1916 and 1918, the President\r\nin 1918 took over the control of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones\r\nfor the duration of the war.\r\n\r\n=Federal Anti-trust Legislation.=--The commerce clause of the\r\nConstitution has also furnished the authority for some important\r\ncongressional legislation against what are popularly known as \"trusts,\"\r\nthat is, combinations of corporations or business associations formed to\r\navoid the wastes of competition and to secure economy of management. But\r\nthe control of the supply of a commodity means the elimination of\r\ncompetition and usually the maintenance of high rates to the injury of\r\nconsumers. For a long time the greater part of the business of the\r\ncountry was conducted by individuals, companies, or corporations, and\r\nthe advantages of competition were preserved to the public, but in the\r\ncourse of the economic development of the country, corporations began to\r\nconsolidate for the reasons stated, with the result that the supply of\r\nmany commodities came to be controlled by single combinations. At first\r\nthe states undertook to deal with the problem by passing anti-\"trust\"\r\nlaws, but the business of so many of the more powerful organizations\r\nwas interstate in character that state legislation was inadequate to\r\ndeal with them.\r\n\r\n_The Sherman Anti-\"trust\" Law._--Finally, in obedience to a widespread\r\npopular demand, Congress took action in 1890 by passing what is\r\npopularly known as the Sherman anti-\"trust\" act to protect trade and\r\ncommerce among the states against unlawful restraint and monopolies.\r\nThis act declared that every contract, combination in the form of trust\r\nor otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the\r\nstates or with foreign nations was illegal, and it prescribed\r\nappropriate penalties for violations thereof. This law, however, applies\r\nonly to \"trusts\" which are in restraint of trade among the states or\r\nwith foreign nations. It has no application to those whose activities\r\nare confined entirely within the boundaries of a single state; with such\r\n\"trusts\" the states alone have the power to deal.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act of 1890, prosecutions have been instituted in\r\nthe federal courts against a large number of \"trusts,\" and some of them\r\nhave been broken up, but the larger number have escaped. In 1911, for\r\nexample, the Supreme Court decided that the Standard Oil and tobacco\r\n\"trusts\" were illegal, and their dissolution was decreed.\r\n\r\n_The Clayton Anti-\"trust\" Act._--In 1914 Congress passed another\r\nimportant act directed against combinations in restraint of trade. In\r\nbrief, it prohibits price discriminations among purchasers, exclusive\r\ntrade agreements between manufacturers and retailers, the holding of the\r\nstock of one corporation by another, and interlocking directorates. Like\r\nthe other anti-\"trust\" acts it applies, of course, only to persons or\r\ncorporations engaged in interstate commerce or trade. To enforce the act\r\na _federal trade commission_ was created. It consists of five members\r\nappointed by the President, at a salary of $10,000 each.\r\n\r\n=Federal Pure Food Legislation.=--The commerce clause of the\r\nConstitution is also the source of some important legislation designed\r\nto protect the public against impure, unwholesome, and adulterated foods\r\nproduced in the United States. We have already called attention to the\r\nlegislation of Congress against the importation of impure foods, and\r\nteas from abroad. Still more recently Congress passed an interstate pure\r\nfood law prohibiting the transportation among the states and territories\r\nof any food products which are adulterated or which contain foreign\r\nsubstances not indicated in the labels. The law also provides for the\r\nfixing of a standard of pure foods and other products transported from\r\none state to another or intended for interstate transportation, and\r\nprovides that they must come up to the standard prescribed.\r\n\r\n_The Meat Inspection Law._--To protect the public against unwholesome\r\nmeat products, Congress enacted in 1891 a law which was strengthened in\r\nimportant particulars in 1906, providing for the inspection of\r\nslaughtering houses whose products are intended for interstate commerce.\r\nThe law requires the registration of all establishments engaged in\r\nslaughtering animals the products of which are to be shipped into other\r\nstates or are intended for export. Each is given a number, and federal\r\ninspectors are assigned to inspect the animals intended for slaughter,\r\nto inspect their carcasses in certain cases, and to see that the\r\nbusiness of slaughtering is conducted under clean and wholesome\r\nconditions. Animals found suffering with certain diseases are not\r\nallowed to be slaughtered for food purposes, and meat discovered to be\r\nunwholesome must be rejected. Supervision is also exercised over the\r\nprocesses of packing and canning, and there are detailed regulations in\r\nregard to labeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.= ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, pp. 89-95.\r\n     BEARD, American Government, ch. xix.

Under Franklin's direction postal routes were\r\nestablished throughout the colonies and the mails were carried over them\r\nat intervals of one or two weeks. In 1776 there were twenty-eight post\r\noffices located in the more important towns. The Constitution gave\r\nCongress power to establish post offices and post roads, and when the\r\nnew government was established, the postal service was reorganized and\r\nextended. In 1790, however, there were only seventy-five post offices in\r\nthe thirteen states, and less than 2,000 miles of post roads. The total\r\nrevenues were only $37,000, and the expenditures only $32,000. Now there\r\nare more than 60,000 offices and over 25,000 different routes, with an\r\naggregate mileage of about 450,000 miles. A recent postmaster-general\r\nhas well said: \"The postal establishment of the United States is the\r\ngreatest business concern in the world. It handles more pieces, employs\r\nmore men, spends more money, brings more revenue, uses more agencies,\r\nreaches more homes, involves more details, and touches more interests\r\nthan any other human organization, public or private, governmental or\r\ncorporate.\" Some idea of the magnitude of the service may be gained from\r\nthe fact that during the year 1919 about twenty billion pieces of mail\r\nwere handled, more than $1,000,000,000 worth of domestic money orders\r\nwere issued, and more than 120,000,000 articles were registered. The\r\nreceipts for the year 1919 aggregated $364,847,126, and the expenditures\r\n$362,497,635.\r\n\r\n_The Postal Deficit._--For many years the postal service was operated at\r\na loss, the principal causes of the deficit being due to the loss\r\nsustained by the government on the transportation of second-class matter\r\nand through the rural free delivery service. During the fiscal year 1917\r\nthe loss on the former account aggregated $72,000,000 and on the latter\r\nabout half that amount. There is also a heavy loss on mail carried free\r\nunder the Congressional frank. Thus in 1917 more than 60,000,000 pounds\r\nof such mail was carried, the postage on which would have cost more than\r\n$20,000,000. Nevertheless by rigorous economy the deficit was made to\r\ndisappear in 1911 for the first time in thirty years. In 1917 there was\r\na surplus of more than $9,000,000.\r\n\r\n=Mail Matter.=--Congress has power to decide what matter shall be\r\nadmitted to the mails and what shall be excluded. In addition to books\r\nand printed matter generally it allows parcels of merchandise weighing\r\nnot more than seventy pounds to be carried through the mails; also\r\nseeds, bulbs, roots, samples of flour, dried fruits, cut flowers,\r\ngeological and botanical specimens, soap, nuts, live queen bees, dried\r\ninsects, etc. On the other hand, the following matter is denied\r\nadmission to the mails: parcels weighing over seventy pounds; poisons,\r\nexplosives, live animals, liquors and other objects unsuitable for\r\ntransportation in the mails; obscene matter and articles adapted or\r\ndesigned for immoral purposes; all matter relating to lotteries and\r\nschemes for swindling the public, and, by acts of 1917, advertisements\r\nof intoxicating liquor intended for distribution in prohibition states\r\nand printed matter advocating treason, insurrection, resistance to the\r\nlaws, disloyalty, etc.\r\n\r\n_\"Fraud Orders.\"_--The mails are so frequently used by dishonest\r\nconcerns for circulating advertising matter designed to defraud the\r\npublic, that a law has been passed authorizing the postmaster-general to\r\nwithhold the privileges of the postal service from persons using it for\r\nsuch purposes. In pursuance of this authority, he frequently issues\r\n\"fraud orders,\" instructing the local postmaster not to deliver mail to\r\nspecified fraudulent concerns. It was reported in 1913 that in two years\r\nsuch concerns had swindled the people out of $129,000,000.\r\n\r\n_Classification of Mail Matter._--Mail is classified into four different\r\nclasses: _first_, letters and postal cards; _second_, newspapers and\r\nother periodical publications; _third_, printed matter not admitted to\r\nthe second class; and _fourth_, merchandise not comprehended in the\r\nother three classes.\r\n\r\n_The Rates of Postage_ on the different classes have varied in amount\r\nfrom time to time. In the early history of the post-office department\r\nthe rates for transporting letters were regulated on the basis of the\r\ndistance carried, and according to the number of sheets in the letter,\r\nthe amount ranging from six to twenty-five cents. Since 1863, however,\r\nthere has been a uniform rate on letters irrespective of distance. In\r\n1883 the rate was fixed at two cents; in 1917, three cents; in 1919, two\r\ncents. Before 1847, when the adhesive postage stamps were introduced,\r\npayment of postage was made in cash and the amount indorsed on the\r\nenvelope. Postal cards were introduced in 1872.\r\n\r\nOn the transportation of first-class mail the government realizes a\r\nprofit estimated at $60,000,000 per year, notwithstanding the long\r\ndistance much of it is carried. There is also a substantial profit\r\nderived from foreign mail.\r\n\r\n=Second-Class Matter= mailed by the publishers is carried at the rate of\r\n1-1/2 cents a pound, with an added charge (depending on distance) for\r\nadvertising matter;[45] but newspapers are carried free to any office\r\nwithin the county of publication except in cities having free delivery\r\nservice. The government has sustained heavy losses in carrying\r\nsecond-class matter. In the year 1917 more than 1,200,000,000 pounds was\r\ntransported at a loss of over six cents per pound. It constituted over\r\n60 per cent of all domestic mail, but yielded less than five per cent of\r\nthe postal revenues, the loss being greater than the profits realized on\r\nall other classes of mail combined.\r\n\r\n    [45] The rate for other persons than publishers is four cents a pound.\r\n\r\n_Should the Second-Class Rate be Increased?_--For some years there was\r\nconsiderable agitation in favor of increasing the rate paid by\r\npublishers, especially on magazines which are overloaded with\r\nadvertising matter and on other publications which are devoted largely\r\nto advertising purposes. Successive postmasters-general urged a\r\nreadjustment of the rates, but until 1917 Congress took no action\r\nfurther than to appoint a commission to investigate and report on the\r\nsubject. The two suggestions most considered were, that a higher rate\r\nshould be imposed on magazines than on newspapers in view of the fact\r\nthat the average distance of transportation is greater in the case of\r\nmagazines than in the case of newspapers, and that a higher rate be\r\nimposed on advertising matter than on purely reading matter.\r\n\r\nAgainst these arguments it was contended that the educational benefits\r\nderived from the extensive circulation of second-class matter are very\r\ngreat, and that for this reason the government can well afford to\r\ncontribute something toward the dissemination of advertising information\r\namong the masses of the people. Moreover, it was argued that the\r\ncirculation of second-class matter is responsible for a large amount of\r\nfirst-class matter and thus the government makes up in the increased\r\nprofits on first-class matter what it loses on second-class matter. Thus\r\nit was said that fifty pages of advertising matter in a popular magazine\r\nmight lead to the writing of 50,000 letters. Consequently a reduction in\r\nthe volume of second-class matter would inevitably be followed by a\r\ncorresponding reduction in first-class matter.\r\n\r\nFinally in 1917 Congress passed a law providing for a graduated increase\r\nin the rates on the advertising portions of newspapers and magazines,\r\nthe amount depending on the distance carried.\r\n\r\n=Free Delivery Service.=--The extension of _rural free delivery_ service\r\nhas been the most rapid and remarkable of all the undertakings of the\r\npost office department. It began as an experiment in 1897, when less\r\nthan $15,000 was appropriated to test the advantage of free delivery in\r\ncountry districts, and it has been extended until it now constitutes one\r\nof the largest branches of the postal service, the annual expenditures\r\non account of the service exceeding $50,000,000. This is the largest\r\nitem of expenditure by the post office department on any of its services\r\nexcept the transportation of mail on the railroads, which foots up\r\nnearly $55,000,000. There are more than 40,000 rural free delivery\r\nroutes in operation, and nearly three billion pieces of mail are\r\nannually delivered to 27,000,000 people along these routes. An\r\ninvestigation made in 1909 showed that the postage on the average\r\namount of mail collected on a rural route was $14.92 per month, while\r\nthe average cost of the service was $72.17. The average cost of the\r\nservice on a rural route, therefore, exceeded the average revenue\r\nderived from postage by $687 per year. On that basis the total loss on\r\nthe operation of the service was estimated to be about $28,000,000. But\r\nwhile the loss to the government in money has been great, the advantage\r\nto the country districts served has been notable. Besides the\r\nconvenience to the country residents it has brought them into closer\r\nrelation with the centers of population, made country life more\r\nattractive and less monotonous, increased farm values, and encouraged\r\nthe improvement of country roads, since the department insists upon the\r\nmaintenance of the highways in good condition as a prerequisite to the\r\nintroduction and continuance of the service.\r\n\r\n_Free Delivery in Cities._--Free delivery of mail in the larger towns\r\nand cities was first introduced during the Civil War, and the service\r\nhas been extended to include all places of not less than 10,000\r\ninhabitants or where the postal receipts are not less than $10,000 per\r\nyear. In 1885, provision was made by which immediate delivery (\"special\r\ndelivery\") of a letter upon its arrival at a city post office could be\r\nsecured by payment of ten cents.\r\n\r\n=Registry Service.=--In 1855, Congress established the registry service,\r\nby which upon the payment of extra postage--the extra rate is now ten\r\ncents per letter or parcel--special care is taken of letters or parcels\r\nregistered. Thus the safe delivery of a valuable letter or parcel is\r\npractically assured, and by a recent law the post office department has\r\nprovided a system of insurance against the loss of parcels mail--the\r\nmaximum amount allowed in case of loss being one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n=Money-Order Service.=--In 1864 the money-order service was established,\r\nby which upon the payment of a small fee, ranging from three to thirty\r\ncents according to the amount of the order, money may be sent through\r\nthe mails without danger of loss. At all the larger post offices and at\r\nmany of the smaller ones, international money orders may also be\r\nobtained at rates ranging from ten cents to one dollar, payable in\r\nalmost any part of the world where the mails are carried. The primary\r\nobject of the postal money-order service is to provide for the public a\r\nsafe, convenient, and cheap method of making remittances by mail, and it\r\nis the declared policy of the department to extend the service to all\r\npost offices where its introduction is practicable.\r\n\r\n=Postal Savings Banks.=--One of the most important extensions of the\r\npostal service is the establishment of a system of postal savings banks,\r\nauthorized by an act of Congress passed in 1910.[46] This service has\r\nlong been performed by the governments of many other countries, and its\r\nintroduction into the United States had been strongly recommended by\r\nsuccessive postmasters-general for a number of years. The proposition\r\nwas also indorsed by both of the great political parties in their\r\nnational platforms. In favor of the proposition it was pointed out that\r\nin many communities private savings banks are inaccessible, there being\r\nonly one such bank to every 52,000 of the population of the country, as\r\na whole; that on account of the popular distrust of private savings\r\nbanks in many communities, savings were hoarded and hidden and thus kept\r\nout of circulation; that on account of the popular confidence in the\r\ngovernment the establishment of savings banks under its auspices would\r\ncause the money now hidden to be brought out and put into circulation;\r\nthat it would encourage thrift and economy as well as stimulate loyalty\r\nand patriotism among depositors; and that it would improve the\r\nconditions of farm life, thus supplementing the work of the rural free\r\ndelivery service, the telephone, and the interurban trolley car.\r\n\r\n    [46] Already in 1906 a system of postal savings banks had been\r\n    established in the Philippine Islands, where it was giving entire\r\n    satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe new law for the establishment of postal savings banks, as amended in\r\n1918, provides that any person may deposit with the local postmaster of\r\nany office which has been made a depository (there were over 7000 such\r\noffices in 1918) any amount from one dollar up to $2500 and receive\r\ninterest thereon at two per cent per annum, provided the amount has been\r\non deposit at least six months. Detailed provisions are made for the\r\ninvestment by the government of the sums deposited in the post offices\r\nthroughout the country. There were in 1919 over 565,000 depositors and\r\nthe total deposits were $167,323,260,--an average of nearly $300 per\r\ndepositor.\r\n\r\n=Parcel Post Service.=--In many countries the post office department\r\nalso performs, through the parcel post service, what amounts to an\r\nexpress business. Thus in a number of the European countries one may\r\nsend boxes or parcels weighing as much as fifty or even one hundred\r\npounds through the mails at very low rates of postage. In the United\r\nStates books and packages of merchandise may be sent through the mails,\r\nbut the weight of the package except in the case of books was until 1913\r\nlimited to four pounds.[47] The limitation as to weight and the\r\ncomparatively high rate of postage--sixteen cents per pound--made\r\nresort to the express companies necessary much more than in Europe. For\r\nsome years there was a widespread agitation for the establishment of a\r\nparcel post system in the United States, and in 1912 Congress provided\r\nfor the installation of such a system on January 1, 1913. The maximum\r\nweight limit of parcels that might be transported through the mails was\r\nincreased to eleven pounds (and later to fifty pounds; seventy pounds\r\nfor short distances), and the list of mailable articles was enlarged so\r\nas to include butter, eggs, meats, fruits, and vegetables. In 1914 books\r\nwere added to the list. The country is divided into zones according to\r\nthe distance from each post office, and the rate of postage varies both\r\nwith the weight and with the zone to which it is sent. About one billion\r\nparcels, weighing over two billion pounds, are handled annually. So\r\npopular is the service that in 1914 the postmaster-general recommended\r\nthat the government take steps toward acquiring the telegraph and\r\ntelephone service of the country.\r\n\r\n    [47] The United States has long had \"parcels post\" treaties with a\r\n    number of foreign countries, however, by which parcels weighing as much\r\n    as eleven pounds may be sent through the mails to those countries at\r\n    the rate of twelve cents per pound.\r\n\r\n=Postal Subsidies.=--In recent years there has been considerable\r\nagitation, principally by the postal authorities and the commercial\r\norganizations of the country, in favor of extending our postal\r\nfacilities with certain foreign countries, notably South America and the\r\nOrient, where they are now very inadequate. While most of the European\r\ngovernments have quick and frequent postal communications with these\r\ncountries, ours are slow and infrequent. Most foreign governments have\r\nadopted the policy of subsidizing private steamship lines to carry the\r\nmails to out-of-the-way places. In 1891, Congress passed a law for this\r\npurpose, but the amount appropriated is so small that the post office\r\ndepartment has not been able to extend our mail facilities with foreign\r\ncountries as rapidly as needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POST OFFICE, NEWARK, NEW JERSEY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POST OFFICE, DES MOINES, IOWA]\r\n\r\n=Shipping Board.=--With a view to building up the American merchant\r\nmarine, which in recent years had greatly declined, Congress in 1916\r\nprovided for the appointment by the President of a federal shipping\r\nboard composed of five commissioners with power to construct or purchase\r\nmerchant vessels suitable as naval auxiliaries and for the carriage of\r\nAmerican commerce. The board is also to supervise common carriers\r\nengaged in transportation by water. As a war measure, the extent of its\r\nbuilding operations was greatly increased in 1917.\r\n\r\n=International Postal Union.=--In this connection it may be noted that\r\npractically all the countries of the world have joined in forming what\r\nis known as the International Postal Union, for the reciprocal exchange\r\nof mails between the post offices of all countries belonging to the\r\nUnion. The rates are fixed by a congress which represents the member\r\nstates and which meets, in normal times, every five years. A letter may\r\ntherefore be sent from one country to any other in the Union at a\r\nuniform rate, which, with some exceptions, is five cents. By special\r\narrangement the rate on letters between the United States and the\r\nBritish Isles has been reduced to two cents. Likewise the rate between\r\nthe United States and Canada or Mexico or most of the West Indies is by\r\nspecial arrangement two cents.\r\n\r\n=Classes of Post Offices.=--Post offices are grouped in four classes on\r\nthe basis of their gross annual receipts. First-class offices are those\r\nwhose gross receipts exceed $40,000 a year.[48] They are usually located\r\nin buildings owned by the government, and in the larger cities there are\r\nbranch offices or sub-stations in different parts of the city.\r\nFourth-class offices are those whose annual receipts are below $1,000.\r\n\r\n    [48] The receipts of the New York post office are about $45,000,000 a\r\n    year.\r\n\r\nSalaries of postmasters of the offices of the first three classes are\r\ndetermined mainly on the basis of the receipts of the office. Fourth-class\r\npostmasters receive no fixed salary, but instead are paid a percentage of\r\nthe value of the stamps cancelled. In the larger post offices there are in\r\naddition to the postmaster one or more assistant postmasters and a force of\r\nclerks and carriers, the number depending on the amount of business and the\r\nsize of the city. All postmasters are appointed after examinations under\r\nthe civil service rules. Postmasters of the fourth class are appointed by\r\nthe postmaster-general; those of the other three classes are appointed by\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\n=Copyrights.=--The Constitution gives Congress the power to promote the\r\nprogress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to\r\nauthors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings\r\nand discoveries. The purpose of the copyright law is to protect authors\r\nfrom having their books and other writings republished without their\r\npermission, and hence to prevent the rewards of their talent and\r\nindustry from being appropriated by others. In pursuance of this\r\nprovision Congress has enacted legislation enumerating the productions\r\nfor which copyrights may be granted, the conditions under which they may\r\nbe secured, and the terms for which the protection shall last. The law\r\nprovides that copyrights may be granted for books, musical compositions,\r\nmaps, works of art, photographs, and even for unpublished works. In the\r\ncase of published works two copies of the best edition must be deposited\r\nwith the register of copyrights at Washington. The ordinary form of\r\ncopyright notice is \"Copyright, 19--, by A. B.\"\r\n\r\nThe term of the copyright is twenty-eight years, but it may be renewed\r\nfor another period of twenty-eight years. During the period of the\r\ncopyright the author has the exclusive right to print, publish, and sell\r\nthe article copyrighted, and in case of infringement he may have\r\nrecourse to the federal courts for damages on account of the loss\r\nsustained. A copyright may be sold or otherwise transferred, but the\r\nfact must be recorded by the register of copyrights.\r\n\r\n_International Copyright._--Formerly the writings of an American author\r\nmight be republished in a foreign country without his consent, and thus\r\nhe had no protection outside of his own country. Accordingly, to secure\r\nprotection to American authors against the republication of their works\r\nin foreign countries without their consent, Congress enacted laws in\r\n1891 and 1909, looking toward the reciprocal protection of American and\r\nforeign authors against infringement of the rights of each in the\r\ncountry of the other. In pursuance of these acts a copyright will be\r\ngranted to a foreign author protecting him against the republication of\r\nhis works in the United States, provided the government of which he is a\r\nsubject will grant similar protection to American authors. But in the\r\ncase of foreign books published in the English language the book must be\r\nprinted and bound in the United States in order to secure the benefits\r\nof copyright. International copyright treaties designed to secure\r\nprotection of this sort have been entered into between the United States\r\nand a number of foreign countries.\r\n\r\n=Patents.=--A patent is a form of protection granted by the government\r\nto an inventor to secure to him for a limited period the exclusive\r\nenjoyment of the fruits of his skill and industry. Patents were granted\r\nby the state governments until the Constitution conferred this power on\r\nCongress. In 1790 Congress passed a law authorizing the granting of\r\npatents for new and useful inventions, and this law has been amended\r\nand its scope extended several times since.\r\n\r\n_The Patent Office._--In 1836, an office or bureau charged with\r\nreceiving applications, conducting examinations, and granting patents\r\nwas created in the department of state, but it was transferred to the\r\ndepartment of the interior in 1849. This office has grown to be one of\r\nthe largest and most important branches of the government service. It\r\nhas a large number of examiners and experts arranged in groups, each of\r\nwhich examines the applications for patents for inventions of a\r\nparticular class.\r\n\r\n_Conditions._--The applicant for a patent must declare upon oath that he\r\nbelieves himself to be the original inventor of the article for which he\r\ndesires a patent, and he must submit with his application a full\r\ndescription or drawing of the invention, and if demanded, also a model\r\nof the same. The invention must be a useful one, for patents will not be\r\ngranted for inventions which have no practical or scientific value. If\r\nthe patent is refused by the commissioner of patents, the applicant can\r\ntake an appeal to the court of appeals of the District of Columbia. A\r\nfee of fifteen dollars is charged for filing the application, and one of\r\ntwenty dollars for issuing the patent.[49] The term for which a patent\r\nmay be issued under the present law is seventeen years, which term may\r\nbe extended only by act of Congress. When a patent is granted the word\r\n\"patented\" with the date on which it was issued must be placed on the\r\narticle in order that the public may have notice of the fact that it is\r\npatented. During the term of the patent the inventor has the exclusive\r\nright to manufacture, use, or sell the article, and in case of\r\ninfringement the law allows him to apply for an injunction to restrain\r\nthe infringer, or to sue for damages. Patents, like copyrights, may be\r\nassigned or otherwise transferred, provided a record of the transfer is\r\nmade in the patent office.[50]\r\n\r\n    [49] Notwithstanding the large number of employees in the patent\r\n    office, the office is self-supporting by reason of the fees charged\r\n    and the large number of applications, the annual receipts amounting\r\n    to more than $2,000,000.\r\n\r\n    [50] An inventor who needs more time in which to perfect his invention\r\n    and to forestall the action of some one else may secure a caveat which\r\n    gives him a year in which to complete his invention.\r\n\r\nTrade-marks are also registered by the patent office provided they are\r\nto be used in interstate commerce. Trade-marks in other cases are\r\nusually protected by state registration.\r\n\r\n_Number of Patents Granted._--The inventive genius of the American\r\npeople is shown by the large number of patents which have been issued\r\nsince the first patent law was passed in 1790. The number granted during\r\nthe year 1919 alone amounted to 37,259. The annual reports of the\r\ncommissioner of patents, containing a list of the patents granted,\r\ntogether with specifications and drawings of the inventions for which\r\npatents have been issued, constitute a remarkable record of the growth\r\nof the country along industrial and scientific lines.\r\n\r\n=The Military Power of Congress.=--The Constitution confers upon\r\nCongress the power to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal,\r\nand make rules concerning captures on land and water. In England and\r\nsome continental European states the power of declaring war belongs to\r\nthe crown, though the means of carrying it on must be provided by the\r\nlegislative branch of the government. The framers of the Constitution,\r\nhowever, with their distrust of executive power, wisely left the whole\r\nmatter to Congress. In the exercise of this power Congress has several\r\ntimes declared war against foreign nations.\r\n\r\n_A Letter of Marque and Reprisal_ is the technical term for a commission\r\nissued to an individual by a belligerent government authorizing him to\r\nprey upon the commerce of the enemy. The vessel commanded by a person\r\nholding such a commission is called a _privateer_. Privateering was long\r\nrecognized as a legitimate mode of warfare, but the evils of the\r\npractice, due mainly to lack of control over the person bearing a\r\ncommission of this sort, were so great that a congress of European\r\nnations held in Paris in 1856 declared privateering to be abolished.\r\nAlthough the United States has never formally adhered to this act, there\r\nis no likelihood that our government will ever again resort to\r\nprivateering.\r\n\r\n_Captures._--In pursuance of the power to make rules concerning captures\r\non land and sea, Congress has adopted a code of rules, though that\r\nmatter is regulated for the most part by international law. Formerly it\r\nwas the practice to allow the commander and crew a share of the proceeds\r\nof prizes captured on the sea in time of war, but in 1898 a law was\r\npassed abolishing prize money and providing that the proceeds from the\r\nsale of prizes should be turned into the treasury of the United States.\r\nIn case of rebellion or insurrection the whole matter of the liability\r\nof the property of insurgents is within the control of Congress. Thus\r\nduring the Civil War acts were passed for the confiscation of all\r\nproperty of the Confederates used in the prosecution of the war, as well\r\nas all abandoned property, that is, property belonging to persons who\r\nwere away from their homes and in the Confederate service.\r\n\r\n=The Army.=--The Constitution expressly authorizes Congress to raise and\r\nsupport armies, subject to the limitation that no appropriation for the\r\nsupport of the army shall be for a longer period than two years. This\r\nperiod corresponds to the term of Congress, and hence the limitation\r\nserves to keep the army under the control of the people. There was more\r\nor less jealousy of standing armies at the time of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, and for a long time the regular army of the United States\r\nwas very small; in 1898, for example, it was only 27,000 men.\r\n\r\n_Present Strength of the Army._--By an act passed in 1916 provision was\r\nmade for increasing the peace strength of the regular army to 480,000\r\nmen; for establishing officers' reserve training corps at colleges and\r\nuniversities; for maintaining camps for giving military training to\r\ncitizens who apply for it; and for creating a regular army reserve, the\r\nmembers of which are to receive at least fifteen days' training each\r\nyear. Provision was also made for reorganizing the militia and for\r\nincreasing its strength ultimately to about 425,000 men. The expense of\r\nthe training camps and of equipping, training, and paying a small salary\r\nto the officers and men of the organized militia and of the regular army\r\nreserve is to be borne by the national government. After the beginning\r\nof the war with Germany (1917), provision was made for raising a large\r\narmy by conscription of able-bodied young men between the ages of 21 and\r\n31 years--later on between 18 and 45.[51] By the act of June 4, 1920, the\r\nstrength of the regular army was reduced to 150,000 men on October 1,\r\n1921.\r\n\r\n    [51] In 1918 when the World War closed some 2,000,000 Americans were\r\n    under arms in France and about 2,000,000 were in the training camps and\r\n    schools in the United States.\r\n\r\n_The General Staff._--In 1903 the office of \"commanding general\" was\r\nabolished and in its place a general staff was created, to prepare plans\r\nfor the conduct of military operations. By the acts of 1916 and 1920 the\r\ngeneral staff was reorganized. At its head is a chief of staff with the\r\nrank of major general, who in time of peace is the actual head of the\r\narmy. Among his assistants are: a chief of cavalry, a chief of field\r\nartillery, a chief of coast artillery, a chief of infantry, and a chief\r\nof chaplains.\r\n\r\n_Military and Naval Expenditures._--The expenditures on account of the\r\nmilitary and naval establishments have increased enormously in recent\r\nyears. Before the war with Spain the appropriations for the maintenance\r\nof the army did not exceed $50,000,000 per annum. The budget of\r\nexpenditures for the year 1922 as submitted to Congress by the President\r\naggregated nearly $4,000,000,000. It contained the following items: war\r\ndepartment, $390,000,000; navy, $478,000,000; pensions, $258,000,000;\r\nveterans bureau, $438,000,000; interest on the national debt,\r\n$976,000,000; total, $2,539,000,000, or more than 60 per cent of the\r\ntotal, leaving less than 40 per cent for civil purposes. In the hope of\r\nbringing about an agreement among the nations for a reduction of their\r\nmilitary and naval expenditures, a conference of the Powers, called by\r\nPresident Harding, assembled at Washington in November, 1921. Here an\r\nagreement was reached to reduce naval expenditures.\r\n\r\n_Volunteers._--Except during the Civil War and the war with Germany,\r\nresort has never been made to conscription for recruiting the army--a\r\npractice almost universal in Europe. In most of our wars the chief\r\nreliance has been on volunteers and the militia. Thus at the outbreak of\r\nthe Civil War the President was authorized to accept the services of\r\n500,000 volunteers, and at the outbreak of the war with Spain in 1898,\r\nthe President called for 200,000 volunteers. It takes much training to\r\nconvert an inexperienced volunteer into an efficient soldier; but many\r\nof our great battles have been fought chiefly by the volunteer forces.\r\n\r\n=The Militia.=--The Constitution also authorizes Congress to provide for\r\ncalling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress\r\ninsurrections, and repel invasions; and to provide for organizing,\r\narming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of\r\nthem as may be employed in the service of the United States. The militia\r\nas defined by act of Congress consists of all able-bodied male citizens\r\nof the United States between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. That\r\nportion of the militia regularly organized, uniformed, and occasionally\r\ndrilled and taught military tactics constitutes the national guard.[52]\r\n\r\n    [52] The actual strength of the national guard in 1921 was about\r\n    113,600 men. But the plans for its development contemplate an ultimate\r\n    strength of 425,000 men.\r\n\r\nEach state organizes and controls its own militia, and the national\r\ngovernment has no control over it until it has been called into the\r\nservice of the United States, when it becomes subject to the rules and\r\ndiscipline prescribed for the government of the regular army. In 1795,\r\nCongress passed an act prescribing the conditions under which the\r\nmilitia might be called into the service of the United States. This act\r\nconferred on the President of the United States the power to call out\r\nthe militia whenever, in his judgment, it was necessary or expedient.\r\nSuch calls are addressed to the governors of the states, who are the\r\ncommanders of their several portions of the militia. When, however, the\r\nmilitia has been mustered into the service of the United States the\r\nPresident becomes their commander in chief. In pursuance of this\r\nauthority the President has called out the militia on two different\r\noccasions; during the War of 1812 to repel invasion; and during the\r\nCivil War to suppress insurrection. In 1898 when the war with Spain was\r\ndeclared, the call was issued not for the militia but for\r\nvolunteers.[53] Nevertheless many of the volunteers who responded were as\r\na matter of fact members of the organized militia of their respective\r\nstates. In pursuance of authority conferred by Congress in 1916, the\r\nPresident drafted the organized militia into the federal service in that\r\nyear for service on the Mexican border, and again in 1917 on account of\r\nthe war with Germany.\r\n\r\n    [53] This was due to the fact that there was doubt as to whether the\r\n    militia could be called out and sent abroad for the purpose of\r\n    prosecuting a war against a foreign country, in view of the\r\n    specification in the Constitution of the objects for which the militia\r\n    may be called into the service of the United States. Under the Act of\r\n    1916, the organized militia may be drafted into the service of the\r\n    United States for use anywhere if Congress declares that an emergency\r\n    exists. They were so drafted in 1917 and sent to Europe, not as\r\n    militia, but as a part of the regular army.\r\n\r\n_The Naval Militia._--In a number of the seaboard states and some of\r\nthose bordering on the Great Lakes, there are organized bodies of naval\r\nmilitia, with training ships loaned by the United States for the purpose\r\nof drill and instruction. Like the land militia, the naval militia of\r\neach state is under the control of the state and until called into the\r\nfederal service is under the command of the governor.[54]\r\n\r\n    [54] According to the report of the secretary of the navy for 1916, the\r\n    naval militia of the states numbered 9,170 men and 636 officers.\r\n\r\n=The Navy.=--Congress is also authorized by the Constitution to provide\r\nand maintain a navy. In pursuance of this authority, Congress created a\r\nsmall naval establishment in 1794, but it amounted to little until the\r\nWar of 1812, when it was strengthened by the improvisation of a number\r\nof war vessels which won brilliant victories over the ships of Great\r\nBritain. Thereafter the navy was neglected until the necessities of the\r\nCivil War required its rehabilitation. At the close of the war the\r\nvessels in the service numbered 683, but they were sold or otherwise\r\ndisposed of, and what was once the most powerful navy in existence was\r\nallowed to go to pieces. In 1881 a board of naval officers prepared a\r\nsomewhat elaborate naval program and recommended the construction during\r\nthe next eight years of some 120 naval vessels. The work was begun in\r\n1883--a date which may properly be fixed as the beginning of our present\r\nnavy. The first important appropriation, that of 1883, was less than\r\n$15,000,000. Each year the amount was increased until in 1917 it had\r\nreached $535,000,000.\r\n\r\n_Present Strength of the Navy._--The number of officers and enlisted men\r\nin the navy in August, 1919, was 241,357, besides about 19,000 men in\r\nthe marine corps. The total number of vessels of all kinds for fighting,\r\nbuilt or in process of construction, was about 1070. These included 50\r\nbattleships, 18 armored cruisers of various types, 7 monitors, some 30\r\nunarmored cruisers of different types, about 360 destroyers and torpedo\r\nboats, about 160 submarines, 336 submarine chasers, and about 100\r\ngunboats and patrol vessels.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of the Secretary of the Navy in 1919, the naval\r\nstanding of the great powers was as follows:\r\n\r\n                        NUMBER OF SHIPS   TOTAL TONNAGE\r\n\r\n    Great Britain           812             2,691,211\r\n    United States           339             1,070,576\r\n    France                  222               552,755\r\n    Japan                   129               540,426\r\n    Italy                   237               287,923\r\n    Russia                  101               254,148\r\n    Germany                  36               116,886\r\n\r\nFor administrative purposes the ships of the navy are grouped into\r\nfleets, and these are again subdivided into squadrons. Thus the North\r\nAtlantic fleet is divided into a coast squadron and a Caribbean\r\nsquadron. Within each squadron there are usually a number of divisions.\r\nThere are navy yards where ships are either built or repaired at a\r\nnumber of places on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts,[55] and there are\r\nseveral training schools for recruits, and a naval academy at Annapolis\r\n(founded in 1845), where young men are educated for service in the\r\nnavy.[56] There is also a naval war college at Newport, Rhode Island, for\r\nadvanced study of naval problems and questions of international law.\r\n\r\n    [55] Most of the ships of the navy have been constructed by contract\r\n    with private ship-building companies, but several experiments have been\r\n    made of government construction in the navy yards. Thus the battleship\r\n    Louisiana and several others were constructed by the government in its\r\n    own shipyards.\r\n\r\n    [56] For further information concerning the naval academy, see p. 338.\r\n\r\n_Ranks._--Until 1862, the highest official rank in the navy was that of\r\ncaptain, although the title commodore was popularly applied to officers\r\nin command of a squadron. The following table is a list of the officers\r\nof the navy, beginning with the highest, together with the corresponding\r\nranks in the army:\r\n\r\n    _Navy_                         _Army_\r\n    Admiral.                     General.\r\n    Vice Admiral.                Lieutenant General.\r\n    Rear Admiral.                Major General.\r\n    Commodore.[57]                Brigadier General.\r\n    Captain.                     Colonel.\r\n    Commander.                   Lieutenant Colonel.\r\n    Lieutenant Commander.        Major.\r\n    Lieutenant.                  Captain.\r\n    Lieutenant, junior grade.    First Lieutenant.\r\n    Ensign.                      Second Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n    [57] The rank of commodore no longer exists except for its survival on\r\n    the retired list. There are some twenty-five or thirty rear admirals.\r\n    The act of 1899, under which Dewey was appointed admiral, provided that\r\n    the office should cease to exist with his death, but in 1915 the rank\r\n    of admiral and vice admiral was reëstablished and the former rank is\r\n    now held by the commanders of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic\r\n    fleets.\r\n\r\n_Marine Corps._--Officers in the Marine Corps have the same ranks as in\r\nthe army. While serving generally under the direction of the secretary\r\nof the navy, the corps may serve with the army by order of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n=Bankruptcy Legislation.=--The Constitution confers upon Congress the\r\npower to pass uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the\r\nUnited States. Bankruptcy is the condition of a person whose liabilities\r\nexceed his assets, and a bankruptcy law is one which provides for the\r\ndistribution of the assets of such a person among his creditors and for\r\nhis discharge from further legal obligation to pay his debts, thus\r\nenabling him to make a new beginning in business. The discharge is only\r\nfrom the _legal_ obligation; the _moral_ obligation remains, and should\r\nbe fulfilled in case of ability to do so in the future.\r\n\r\n_State Insolvency Laws._--Before the adoption of the Constitution the\r\nstates passed insolvency laws discharging debtors from their legal\r\nobligations, and it has been held by the Supreme Court that they may\r\nstill pass such laws, subject to the condition that they can affect only\r\ncitizens of the state in which the law is passed, and apply only to such\r\ncontracts as may be entered into subsequent to the enactment of the law.\r\nIf there is a federal bankruptcy law in force it supersedes all\r\nconflicting provisions in the state laws on the subject.\r\n\r\n_Federal Acts._--Since the Constitution went into effect Congress has\r\nenacted four different bankruptcy laws, namely, in 1802, 1840, 1867, and\r\n1898, the first three of which were in operation only fifteen years\r\naltogether. The present law--that of 1898--provides for both\r\n\"voluntary\" and \"involuntary\" bankruptcy. Any debtor, except a\r\ncorporation, may voluntarily have himself adjudged a bankrupt by filing\r\na petition in a United States district court, showing that his\r\nliabilities are in excess of his assets. Any debtor except a\r\ncorporation, a wage earner, or a farmer, may, against his will, upon\r\npetition of his creditors, be declared a bankrupt under certain\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nBankruptcy petitions are referred to \"referees\" for examination and\r\nreport. After hearing the testimony on the petition the referee reports\r\nhis findings to the court, which makes its decision largely on the basis\r\nof such findings.\r\n\r\n=Implied Powers.=--After expressly enumerating in succession the various\r\npowers of Congress, the more important of which have been described\r\nabove, the Constitution concludes with a sort of general grant,\r\nempowering Congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper\r\nfor carrying into execution those enumerated above. This is sometimes\r\ncalled \"the elastic clause,\" since it is capable of being stretched by\r\ninterpretation to cover many matters that Congress might not otherwise\r\nfeel authorized to deal with. It is doubtful, however, whether it really\r\nadds anything to the power of Congress, since that body would\r\nunquestionably have authority to do whatever is necessary and proper to\r\ncarry into effect the powers expressly conferred upon it. It is a maxim\r\nof constitutional construction that wherever power to do a particular\r\nthing is conferred, the means for doing it are implied. Manifestly it\r\nwould have been impossible to set forth in detail all the incidental\r\npowers necessary to be exercised in carrying into effect the mandates of\r\nthe Constitution relating to taxes, coinage, post offices, making war,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_Liberal vs. Strict Construction._--The question of the interpretation\r\nof the scope and meaning of this grant of powers arose very early in the\r\nhistory of the national government, in connection with the proposition\r\nof Hamilton to establish a United States bank. Hamilton contended that\r\nthe authority to establish such an institution was clearly implied in\r\nthe power to borrow money and pay the debts of the United States. A\r\nfederal bank, he urged, was a proper if not a necessary means for\r\ncarrying into effect these important powers of Congress, just as the\r\nestablishment of a mint was necessary to carry out the power relating to\r\nthe coinage of money. Jefferson and his school of political thinkers,\r\nhowever, held to a strict interpretation of the Constitution and\r\nmaintained that Congress had no right to exercise any power which was\r\nnot expressly conferred. The view of the \"loose\" or \"liberal\"\r\nconstructionists, however, prevailed, and from the beginning Congress\r\nhas relied upon the doctrine of implied powers for its authority to\r\nlegislate on many important questions.\r\n\r\n_Examples of Implied Powers._--It was upon this authority that foreign\r\nterritory has been purchased and governed; that a protective tariff has\r\nbeen levied; that a national bank was established; that legal tender\r\npaper money has been issued; that the construction of the Panama Canal\r\nhas been undertaken; that ship subsidies have been granted; that postal\r\nsavings banks have been established; that education has been fostered;\r\nand many other activities undertaken. The policy of liberal\r\ninterpretation was first adopted by Chief Justice Marshall of the\r\nSupreme Court and his associates, and with rare exceptions has been\r\nfollowed by the court throughout its entire history. The effect has been\r\nto strengthen the national government and render it capable of\r\nfulfilling the great purposes for which it was created. The whole\r\ncourse of our political and constitutional history is different from\r\nwhat it would have been had the view of the strict constructionists\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, pp. 120-148.\r\n     BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. xix.

There was no doubt,\r\ntherefore, in the minds of the framers of the Constitution in regard to\r\nthe desirability of providing for an executive department coördinate\r\nwith the legislative department. It was accordingly declared that the\r\nexecutive power should be vested in an officer called the President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n_Proposed Executive Council._--While the convention was practically\r\nunanimous in the view that the supreme executive power should be vested\r\nin a single person, a good many members looked with favor on a\r\nproposition to associate with the President an executive council which\r\nshould share with him the exercise of the executive power in certain\r\nimportant fields. Most of the state constitutions then in force had\r\nprovided such councils, and now that a national executive with far\r\nlarger powers was being created there was all the more reason why it\r\nshould be placed to some extent under the guardianship of a council. But\r\nthe proposition was rejected, and in its place the Senate was charged\r\nwith acting as an executive council to the President in negotiating\r\ntreaties and the making of appointments, but in no other respects.\r\n\r\n=Qualifications of the President.=--The Constitution requires that the\r\nPresident shall be a natural born citizen of the United States,[58] that\r\nhe must have attained the age of thirty-five years, and must have been\r\nfourteen years a resident of the United States. The same qualifications\r\nare required of the Vice President.\r\n\r\n    [58] Or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of\r\n    the Constitution. This exception was made out of respect to the\r\n    distinguished men of foreign birth, such as Alexander Hamilton and\r\n    James Wilson, who were members of the convention that framed the\r\n    Constitution. As more than a hundred years have elapsed since the\r\n    adoption of the Constitution, the exception, of course, no longer has\r\n    any meaning.\r\n\r\n=The Presidential Term.=--There was considerable discussion in the\r\nconvention regarding the term of the President. It was first decided\r\nthat the term should be seven years and the President made ineligible to\r\na second term, but upon further consideration the convention decided to\r\nfix the term at four years and nothing was said in regard to\r\nreëligibility. The result is, the President may serve as many terms as\r\nthe people may see fit to elect him. The following Presidents have been\r\nelected to two terms: Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Jackson,\r\nLincoln, Grant, Cleveland, McKinley, and Wilson.[59] Cleveland, after\r\nserving one term, was renominated by his party but was defeated by the\r\nRepublican candidate. He was then nominated for the third time by his\r\nparty and was elected. Washington declined a third term and his example\r\nhas been followed by his successors. The precedent thus established,\r\nthat the President shall serve only two terms, has become part of our\r\nunwritten constitution, and but two attempts have ever been made to\r\nbreak the custom.[60]\r\n\r\n    [59] Mr. Roosevelt became President by the death of President McKinley\r\n    about half a year after the beginning of the latter's second term. He\r\n    served out the unexpired term of Mr. McKinley and was elected to the\r\n    following full term of four years.\r\n\r\n    [60] The first was made by ex-President Grant, who in 1880 was a\r\n    candidate for the Republican nomination for a third term, but failed to\r\n    secure it. The second was made by ex-President Roosevelt in 1912.\r\n\r\n=Mode of Election.=--No question consumed so much of the time of the\r\nconvention as that relating to the method of choosing the President.\r\nVarious schemes were proposed. A few members favored election by the\r\npeople; others urged election by Congress. Against the method of popular\r\nchoice it was argued that the people were not competent to choose a\r\nchief magistrate for the entire country, and besides, under such a\r\nsystem, they would be influenced by demagogues and scheming politicians.\r\nAgain, the tumults and disorders, the \"heats and ferments\" of a popular\r\nelection would convulse the community to the breaking point. Against the\r\nmethod of election by Congress, it was urged that the President would be\r\na mere creature or tool of that assembly and would be under the\r\ntemptation of making promises or entering into bargains with influential\r\nmembers in order to secure an election. Moreover, such a method was\r\ncontrary to the great principle upon which all the members were agreed,\r\nnamely, that the three departments of the national government should be\r\nkept separate and independent of one another.\r\n\r\nThe clause as finally adopted provides that the President shall be\r\nchosen, not directly by the voters, but by electors to be appointed in\r\neach state in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, each\r\nstate to have as many electors as it has senators and representatives in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n_Breakdown of the Electoral Plan._--It was at first expected that the\r\nelectors of the different states, composed of leading citizens\r\npresumably well acquainted with the qualifications of the candidates for\r\nthe chief magistracy, would meet at the state capitals, discuss among\r\nthemselves the strength and weaknesses of the several candidates, and\r\nthen exercising their full judgment, cast their votes for the fittest.\r\nBut the scheme quickly broke down in practice, and instead of a real\r\nchoice by small bodies of men, we have a system which amounts to direct\r\nelection by the masses of the voters, though the form of indirect\r\nelection is still followed. As soon as political parties were thoroughly\r\norganized, the electors, who were intended to be men \"capable of\r\nanalyzing the qualities adapted to the Presidential office,\" were\r\nreduced to the position of party puppets who no longer exercised their\r\nown judgment in choosing the President but merely registered, like\r\nautomata, the will of their party. As Ex-President Harrison once\r\nremarked, an elector who should fail to vote for the nominee of his\r\nparty would be the object of execration and in times of very high\r\nexcitement might be the subject of a lynching.[61] So closely do the\r\nelectors obey the will of their party that we always know at the close\r\nof election day, on Tuesday after the first Monday in November, when the\r\nelectors themselves are chosen, who will be the next President, though\r\nin fact the electors do not meet in their respective states until the\r\nfollowing January, formally to register the choice of the people.\r\n\r\n    [61] \"This Country of Ours,\" p. 77.\r\n\r\n=Choosing Presidential Electors.=--In the beginning the presidential\r\nelectors of each state were chosen by the legislature, either by joint\r\nballot of the two houses sitting together, or by concurrent vote. In the\r\ncourse of time, however, popular election of electors was introduced,\r\nSouth Carolina (1868) being the last state to choose its electors by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n_Choice by General Ticket._--When the system of popular choice of\r\nelectors was adopted, two different methods were followed: choice by\r\ndistricts, and choice on general ticket from the state at large; but by\r\n1832 all the states except Maryland had adopted the general ticket\r\nmethod, and now there is no state which follows the district method.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives in Congress, as we have seen, are elected by districts,\r\nand hence the delegation in Congress from a particular state is often\r\ndivided between Democrats and Republicans. But not so with Presidential\r\nelectors; usually the party in the majority in the state, however small\r\nthe majority, chooses all the electors. Thus when the Democratic party\r\ncarried New York by a majority of hardly more than 1,000 votes in 1884,\r\nthe entire electoral vote was counted for Cleveland.[62]\r\n\r\n    [62] It sometimes happens that the electoral vote of a state is\r\n    divided, though the instances are rare. This may be due to the\r\n    personal unpopularity of one of the electoral candidates of the\r\n    majority party, or it may be due to the mistake of many voters in\r\n    casting their ballots for the candidate for elector at the head of\r\n    the ticket only, believing that they are thereby voting for the whole\r\n    ticket. As a result of the former cause, Harrison received one vote in\r\n    California in 1892, while Cleveland had the other eight. As a result\r\n    chiefly of the latter blunder, Taft received only two electoral votes\r\n    in Maryland in 1908, and Bryan received the other six. In 1916 the vote\r\n    of West Virginia was divided, Wilson receiving one vote and Hughes the\r\n    other seven.\r\n\r\nAmong the results of the rule which gives the entire electoral vote of\r\nthe state to one of the candidates, notwithstanding the size of the vote\r\npolled by the other candidate, is that each party concentrates its\r\nefforts in the large \"pivotal\" states whose votes are decisive, and\r\nthereby bribery and fraud in such states are powerfully stimulated.\r\n\r\nCandidates for the office of elector are nominated usually by the state\r\nconventions of each party. No senator or representative or any person\r\nholding an office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States is\r\neligible to the office of elector. Congress, under the Constitution, has\r\npower to fix the day on which the electors shall be chosen, and it has\r\nfixed the day as Tuesday after the first Monday in November.\r\n\r\n_Electoral and Popular Vote._--Generally the candidate for President\r\nwhose electors receive the largest popular vote will also receive the\r\nlargest electoral vote; but this has not always happened, and usually\r\nthere is only a rough correspondence between the popular vote and the\r\nelectoral vote. Thus in 1860 Lincoln received only about forty per cent\r\nof the popular vote, though he received a substantial majority (about\r\nfifty-nine per cent) of the electoral vote. Again, in 1864 he received\r\nonly about fifty-five per cent of the popular vote, but ninety-one per\r\ncent of the electoral vote. In 1912 Wilson received forty-two per cent\r\nof the popular vote, and eighty-two per cent of the electoral vote. Such\r\ndiscrepancies are due to the fact that the entire electoral vote of a\r\nstate is usually cast for the candidate who receives a plurality of the\r\npopular vote of the state, however small it may be. A party, therefore,\r\nmay carry enough states by small margins to secure a majority of the\r\nelectors and yet be in a minority so far as the popular vote of the\r\nentire country is concerned.\r\n\r\n=Choice of the President by the Electors.=--The electors, on the second\r\nMonday of January following their election, assemble in their respective\r\nstate capitals for the purpose of choosing the President.[63] The\r\nConstitution as it now stands requires the electors to vote by ballot\r\nfor President and by a distinct ballot vote for Vice President, and make\r\nseparate lists of all persons voted for as President and of all persons\r\nvoted for as Vice President.\r\n\r\n    [63] The day on which the electors assemble must be the same throughout\r\n    the Union. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent deals or\r\n    bargains among the electoral \"colleges\" of the different states.\r\n    Moreover, meeting on the same day, the action of one state cannot be\r\n    used to influence that of another. In 1857 the electors of Wisconsin\r\n    were prevented by a snowstorm from assembling at the state capital on\r\n    the day fixed by law. On the day following they met and cast the vote\r\n    of the state for Frémont. But when the question of counting Wisconsin's\r\n    vote came up in Congress, objection was made that it had not been cast\r\n    on the day prescribed by law. As the vote of the state was not\r\n    decisive, the matter did not become serious.\r\n\r\n_The Original Method._--The Constitution as originally adopted did not\r\nrequire the electors in casting their ballots to indicate the person for\r\nwhom they were voting as President and whom for Vice President, or to\r\nprepare distinct lists. The one who received the highest vote (if a\r\nmajority) was to be President, and the one receiving the next highest\r\nnumber (whether a majority or not) was to be Vice President. The result\r\nof this method of choosing the President was that as soon as political\r\nparties were formed and the electors came to vote strictly on the basis\r\nof party there would be a tie between the two persons highest on the\r\nlist, and as there was nothing to show on the record which was intended\r\nfor President and which for Vice President there would be no election.\r\nThis happened in 1801, when Jefferson and Burr each received\r\nseventy-three electoral votes, and the choice between them had to be\r\nmade by the house of representatives as the Constitution provides.\r\n\r\n_Twelfth Amendment._--To remove the difficulty, the Twelfth Amendment\r\nwas adopted in 1804, requiring the electors in preparing their ballots\r\nto indicate their choice for President and their choice for Vice\r\nPresident so that the person intended for the latter office could not be\r\nconfused with the person intended for President. The amendment also\r\nrequires a majority of the electoral vote to elect the Vice President as\r\nwell as the President.\r\n\r\n_Restrictions on the Electors._--In casting their votes the electors are\r\nprohibited from voting for candidates for both offices from the same\r\nstate as themselves. The purpose of this provision is to prevent the\r\nelectors from one state--if any state should ever become powerful\r\nenough--from choosing both the President and the Vice President from\r\nthat state. This does not mean, however, that both the President and the\r\nVice President could not be elected from the same state, since the\r\nelectors of the other states are not prohibited from voting for two\r\ncandidates from the same state.\r\n\r\n_Formalities and Precautions._--The Constitution requires the electors\r\nof each state to sign, certify, seal, and transmit to the president of\r\nthe United States senate, a list of the votes cast for President and\r\nVice President. The statutes also require two additional lists to be\r\nprepared, one to be sent to the president of the senate by special\r\nmessenger, and the other to be deposited with the nearest United States\r\ndistrict judge. These extra precautions are taken to prevent the loss of\r\nthe state's votes through accident or otherwise. This done, the office\r\nof the Presidential elector expires and the electoral colleges cannot be\r\nagain summoned to correct errors or to make a new choice in case the\r\nPresident elect should die before inauguration.\r\n\r\n=Counting the Electoral Vote.=--The Constitution directs that the votes\r\ntransmitted to the president of the senate shall be opened in the\r\npresence of both houses of Congress and that the votes shall then be\r\ncounted. The Constitution does not say who shall count the votes.\r\nApparently the framers believed that the process of counting would never\r\ninvolve anything more than a simple act of addition. But in the course\r\nof time disputed returns began to be sent in, and then the process of\r\ncounting came to involve the more difficult task of determining what\r\nshould be counted. Thereupon the question was raised, who shall count?\r\nWas the president of the senate to count and the two houses act merely\r\nas spectators, or was the president of the senate to open the votes and\r\nthe two houses do the counting? For a long time, when the disputes were\r\nnot serious enough to affect the result, the president of the senate was\r\nallowed to count the vote and proclaim the result.[64] In 1865 by a joint\r\nrule Congress assumed the right to count the electoral vote, thus taking\r\nthe power away from the president of the senate.\r\n\r\n    [64] Thus Jefferson as president of the senate in 1801, counted the\r\n    vote which elected him President of the United States and declared\r\n    himself duly elected. So did Adams in 1797. Suppose there had been a\r\n    serious dispute in either of these cases, could the president of the\r\n    senate have counted for himself the votes in dispute?\r\n\r\n_The Disputed Election of 1876._--In 1876 a serious election dispute\r\narose, involving the presidency. Both Hayes and Tilden claimed to have\r\nbeen elected, and the result depended upon which of two conflicting\r\nlists of votes from Florida, Oregon, South Carolina, and Louisiana\r\nshould be counted. Under the joint rule mentioned above, either house\r\ncould reject a questionable vote. One of the houses was Democratic and\r\nthe other Republican, and because of the great excitement over the\r\nmatter, it was feared that the votes of many states might be rejected\r\nfor trivial reasons. After much discussion, in the course of which many\r\nugly threats were made, Congress agreed to the creation of an electoral\r\ncommission, to decide the disputed votes. The commission was to consist\r\nof five senators, five representatives, and five justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt. As finally constituted it was composed of eight Republicans and\r\nseven Democrats, and by a strict party vote the commission decided in\r\nfavor of Hayes in every case, thus insuring his election. The minority\r\naccepted the result, but not without protest and criticism.\r\n\r\n_The Act of 1887._--After this decision, Congress took up the task of\r\ndevising permanent rules for counting the electoral vote, and finally in\r\n1887 it passed an elaborate act which now regulates the electoral count.\r\nIn brief, it places the responsibility so far as possible on the state\r\nauthorities, and provides that the determination of each state as to how\r\nits electoral vote was cast shall, under certain conditions, be final.\r\nIf, however, a state neglects to settle its own election contests, and\r\ndouble returns are transmitted to the president of the senate, the two\r\nhouses of Congress sitting separately must determine how the votes shall\r\nbe counted. But if the two houses fail to agree, as they did in counting\r\nthe vote of 1876, then the vote of the state is lost. The day fixed by\r\nCongress for opening and counting the vote is the second Wednesday in\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n=Election by the House.=--In case no candidate receives a majority of\r\nthe electoral votes, the choice devolves upon the house of\r\nrepresentatives. But in that case the house votes by states, each state\r\nhaving one vote, irrespective of its number of representatives, and the\r\nchoice is made from the three candidates standing highest on the\r\nlist.[65] A quorum for the election of a President by the house consists\r\nof a member or members from two thirds of the states, and the vote of a\r\nmajority of all the states is necessary to a choice.\r\n\r\n    [65] It was from the five highest before the adoption of the Twelfth\r\n    Amendment in 1804.\r\n\r\n_Objections to Election by the House._--The objections to this method of\r\nchoice are obvious. It is undemocratic, because the house on which the\r\nchoice would devolve in any case would be, not the new house chosen at\r\nthe recent election, but the old house, which might indeed, as has often\r\nhappened, be in the hands of the political party defeated at the late\r\nelection. In the second place, under such a scheme, New York with a\r\npopulation over 100 times as great as that of Nevada would have no\r\nlarger share in choosing the executive. In 1873, for example, had the\r\nchoice devolved upon the house, it would have been possible for 45\r\nmembers (being a majority of the representatives of nineteen states) to\r\ndetermine the choice in spite of the wishes of the other 247 members.\r\nFinally, the state delegations in the house might be equally divided\r\npolitically, and hence fail to elect.[66]\r\n\r\n    [66] This would have happened in 1912; 22 state delegations were\r\n    Republican, 22 were Democratic, and 4 were equally divided.\r\n\r\n_Instances of Choice by the House._--Twice has the electoral college\r\nfailed to make a choice, thus giving the election to the house of\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, there was a tie between Jefferson and Burr, each having the\r\nvote of a majority of the electors. There were then sixteen states, of\r\nwhich eight voted for Jefferson, six for Burr, and two were evenly\r\ndivided. On the thirty-sixth ballot the two divided states voted for\r\nJefferson and he was elected, as the electors had originally intended.\r\n\r\nThe second instance occurred in 1825, when the electoral vote stood as\r\nfollows: for Jackson 99; for Adams 84; for Crawford 41; and for Clay 37,\r\nno one having a majority. Under the Twelfth Amendment Clay was dropped\r\nfrom the list and the choice was confined to the three highest\r\ncandidates. There were then twenty-four states, and of these the\r\nrepresentatives of thirteen voted for Adams, seven for Jackson, and four\r\nfor Crawford.\r\n\r\n=Election of the Vice President by the Senate.=--The Constitution also\r\nprovides that if no candidate for Vice President receives a majority of\r\nthe electoral vote the choice shall devolve upon the senate, in which\r\ncase the election shall be made from the two highest on the list. Two\r\nthirds of the senate constitute a quorum for this purpose, and a\r\nmajority of the whole number is necessary to a choice. Only once has the\r\nchoice devolved upon the senate, namely, in 1836, when Richard M.\r\nJohnson, candidate for Vice President on the ticket with Mr. Van Buren,\r\nfailed to receive a majority of the electoral vote. He was promptly\r\nelected by the senate.\r\n\r\n=Methods of Nomination.=--Neither the Constitution nor the laws of the\r\nUnited States make any provision in regard to the nomination of the\r\ncandidates for President and Vice President. That is left entirely to\r\nthe regulation of the political parties themselves. In the early history\r\nof the republic, before political parties had risen, no nominating\r\nmachinery was devised, for none was needed.\r\n\r\n_Early Methods._--With the rise of political parties, however, the\r\nmethod of nomination by congressional caucus was introduced; that is,\r\nthe members of Congress belonging to each political party assumed the\r\npower of selecting its candidate in secret conclave. In this way\r\nJefferson was nominated by the Republican members of Congress in 1800\r\nand 1804, Madison in 1808 and 1812, and Monroe in 1816 and 1820. In the\r\nsame way the Federalist members put forward their candidates. In some\r\ncases, however, presidential candidates were nominated by state\r\nlegislatures. In the course of time, strong opposition grew up against\r\nthe method of nomination by members of Congress, and after 1824 the\r\ncaucus system was never again resorted to. The new nominating machinery\r\nwhich took its place was the national convention, which came into use\r\nbetween 1831 and 1840.\r\n\r\n=The National Convention.=--A national convention to nominate candidates\r\nfor President and Vice President is composed of delegates from each\r\nstate and territory in the Union, the number to which each is entitled\r\nbeing usually twice its number of senators and representatives in\r\nCongress.[67] Altogether the national convention consists of about 1,000\r\ndelegates. For each delegate there is an alternate who attends the\r\nconvention and in case of the absence of the delegate, takes his place.\r\n\r\n    [67] Apportionment of delegates among the states on the basis of their\r\n    representation in Congress bears no relation to the party strength. For\r\n    some years there has been a growing sentiment in the ranks of the\r\n    Republican party in favor of reducing the representation in the\r\n    national convention of the Southern states where the Republican party\r\n    is practically nonexistent. In December, 1913, the Republican national\r\n    committee adopted a resolution prescribing that representation in the\r\n    national convention of 1916 should to a certain extent be based on the\r\n    number of the voters of the party in each congressional district. The\r\n    effect was to reduce the number of southern delegates by eighty-seven,\r\n    and the number of northern delegates by seven. The basis of\r\n    representation in the Democratic convention, however, remains\r\n    unchanged.\r\n\r\nFormerly the four delegates-at-large of each party were chosen by the\r\nstate convention, and the other delegates by congressional district\r\nconventions. When direct primary laws were introduced, some states\r\nprovided that the latter delegates should be selected by the voters of\r\neach party at the primary, leaving the delegates-at-large to be chosen\r\nas formerly by the state convention. In 1912 a number of states passed\r\nwhat are known as \"presidential preference primary\" laws under which\r\ndelegates to the national conventions of that year were chosen. Some of\r\nthese laws permit the voters to choose their delegates to the national\r\nconvention but without allowing them to indicate their preference for\r\nany presidential candidate; others allow a direct expression of the\r\npopular preference for presidential candidates but make no provision for\r\nbinding the delegates to nominate the candidate preferred by the\r\nmajority of the voters; some, however, provide both for an expression of\r\nthe popular preference and for binding the delegates to the national\r\nconvention. More than one third of the states now have laws of one or\r\nanother of these three types.\r\n\r\n_The Time and Place_ for holding the national convention are fixed by\r\nthe national committee. The date usually falls in the latter part of\r\nJune or early in July of the year the President is to be elected, and\r\nthe place is usually some large city centrally located.\r\n\r\n=Procedure of a National Convention.=--The convention is usually held in\r\nsome spacious building especially erected for the purpose. Besides the\r\ndelegations of the states, there are the alternates, hundreds of\r\npoliticians who are not delegates, newspaper reporters, and thousands of\r\nspectators from all parts of the country, for all of whom accommodations\r\nare needed.\r\n\r\n_Organization of the Convention._--The convention is called to order by\r\nthe chairman of the national committee, and the secretary of the\r\ncommittee reads the call for the convention. Next come the choice of a\r\ntemporary chairman, and the appointment and report of committees on\r\ncredentials, on permanent organization, on rules, and on resolutions\r\nmuch as in the state conventions described on pp. 153-155.\r\n\r\n_The Platform_ is a series of resolutions commending the national\r\nadministration, or denouncing it, as the case may be, and setting forth\r\nthe position of the party on the political issues of the day.\r\nDeclarations are often made in the platform to attract or conciliate\r\nlarge masses of voters, sometimes when there is no real intention of\r\ncarrying them out. The platform is usually adopted by the convention as\r\nreported by the committee on resolutions, but sometimes important\r\nchanges are made on the floor after a spirited contest.\r\n\r\n_The Nominations._--After the adoption of the platform, the nomination\r\nof candidates for President is in order. The clerk calls the roll of the\r\nstates in alphabetical order so that each is given an opportunity to\r\npresent the name of its choice. The vote is then taken by a roll call of\r\nthe states, the chairman of each state delegation usually announcing the\r\nvote of the state. Under the rules of the Republican party the delegates\r\nvote as individuals, so that the vote of a state is often divided\r\nbetween two or more candidates, unless the conventions which appointed\r\nthe delegates have instructed them to cast the vote of the state for a\r\nparticular candidate. According to the \"unit rule\" of the Democratic\r\nparty, the state delegations vote as units and not as individuals, so\r\nthat there is no division of a state's vote; the majority of each\r\ndelegation determines how the votes of the state shall be cast.[68] The\r\nrules of the Democratic and Republican parties also differ in the\r\nmajority necessary to nominate a candidate.\r\n\r\n    [68] The convention of 1912 excepted certain states from this rule.\r\n\r\n_The Vote Necessary to Nominate._--According to the rules of the\r\nRepublican party, a majority of the delegates is sufficient to\r\nnominate, but under the rules of the Democratic party the concurrence of\r\ntwo thirds of the delegates is required. Thus if there are 1,000\r\ndelegates in the convention, 501 may nominate under the Republican rule,\r\nwhile 667 would be required under the rules of the Democratic party. The\r\nlarge majority necessary to nominate in the Democratic convention has\r\noften resulted in the defeat of the leading candidate and the nomination\r\nof a \"dark horse,\" that is, a candidate whose name has not been\r\npreviously presented to the convention or which has not been prominently\r\nkept before it. Presidents Polk and Pierce were nominated in this way.\r\n\r\n_Nomination of Vice President._--Usually there is little contest over\r\nthe nomination of the Vice President, the nomination usually being given\r\nto some one supported by a defeated faction or group of the party, or to\r\na particular section of the country. Thus if the presidential nomination\r\ngoes to an Eastern man, the vice presidential nomination is likely to be\r\ngiven to a Western man. In view of the comparatively large number of\r\nPresidents who have died in office it is to be regretted that so little\r\nconsideration is given to the nomination of candidates for Vice\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n_Notification of the Candidates._--The candidates are formally notified\r\nsome weeks later by a committee specially appointed for the purpose. The\r\nnominee in a formal speech accepts the nomination and pledges himself to\r\nsupport the platform. Usually this is followed by a letter of acceptance\r\nin which the views of the nominee are elaborated more at length. This\r\ncompletes the formalities of nomination, and the next step is to\r\ninaugurate the campaign for the election of the nominees.\r\n\r\n=Conduct of a Presidential Campaign.=--_The National Committee._--The\r\nmain task of managing the campaign falls on the chairman of the\r\nnational committee. This committee is made up of one member from each\r\nstate and territory, and is chosen by the national convention which\r\nnominates the candidates.[69] The chairman is usually an experienced\r\npolitical leader with a wide acquaintanceship, and is a trusted friend\r\nof the presidential candidate, by whom, in fact, he is usually selected.\r\n\r\n    [69] In reality each state delegation names one of its own number as\r\n    the national committeeman from the state, and the committee thus\r\n    constituted is appointed by the convention.\r\n\r\nSoon after the adjournment of the convention, the national committee\r\nmeets and organizes. In addition to the national chairman a treasurer\r\nand a secretary are chosen. The treasurer raises and has custody of the\r\nenormous funds expended in the conduct of the campaign. As the national\r\nchairman may be compared to a general who commands the forces, the\r\ntreasurer is the man who raises the sinews of the war.\r\n\r\n_Work of the National Committee._--The headquarters of the committee are\r\nusually established in New York city, with branch offices in Chicago or\r\nWashington, though during the campaign of 1908 the principal\r\nheadquarters were located in Chicago. The work of the committee is\r\nusually divided among bureaus or divisions, one of which has charge of\r\nthe mailing of campaign literature, another is engaged in the tabulation\r\nof reports, another looks after the employment and assignment of\r\nspeakers, another has charge of the organization of voters' clubs\r\nthroughout the country, etc.[70] Large quantities of campaign literature,\r\nconsisting of a \"Campaign textbook,\" speeches of the candidates or of\r\nmembers of Congress, pamphlets, leaflets, posters, lithographs, and in\r\nfact everything calculated to influence the voters, are sent broadcast\r\nthroughout the country and particularly in the close or doubtful states\r\nwhere the principal efforts of the committee are concentrated.[71]\r\n\r\n    [70] In 1908, the Democratic national committee had a labor bureau to\r\n    look after the labor vote, and a committee on college men's clubs to\r\n    look after the organization of college students into voters' clubs.\r\n\r\n    [71] In 1908, more than one million copies of Mr. Bryan's speech \"Shall\r\n    the People Rule\" were distributed, printed in all languages spoken in\r\n    the United States. Another million copies of his speeches on the\r\n    trusts, the tariff, guarantee of bank deposits, and injunctions were\r\n    also circulated.\r\n\r\n_Activity of the Presidential Candidate._--Formerly it was not\r\nconsidered proper for the presidential candidates themselves to take an\r\nactive part in the campaign by traveling about the country and making\r\nspeeches, but in recent years there has been a change in this respect.\r\nMr. Bryan in 1896 traveled about the country and delivered hundreds of\r\nspeeches in behalf of his candidacy, and he pursued a similar course in\r\n1900 and again in 1908 when he was the Democratic candidate. In the\r\nlatter year, Mr. Taft, the Republican candidate, likewise entered\r\nactively into the campaign and delivered more than 400 speeches in\r\nthirty different states. In 1912 Mr. Wilson and Mr. Roosevelt made\r\nextensive campaign tours and delivered many speeches. Similar tours were\r\nmade in later campaigns.\r\n\r\n=Raising and Expenditure of Campaign Funds.=--The management of a\r\nnational political campaign requires the expenditure of large sums of\r\nmoney for printing, postage, telegrams, express, rent of halls, music,\r\nexpenses of speakers, organizing clubs, and the like. This money is\r\nspent solely under the direction of the national chairman, who until\r\nrecently was not required to render an account of the moneys contributed\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n_The Raising of Campaign Funds._--Prior to 1884 the expenditures on\r\naccount of a national campaign were comparatively small and were raised\r\nby the party in power largely by assessments on federal office-holders;\r\nbut the civil service law enacted in the year previous forbade\r\nassessments of this kind and thus cut off an important source of supply.\r\nMore attention then began to be turned toward the great corporations,\r\nmany of which desired to become the beneficiaries of special legislation\r\nor to secure immunity from government interference with the management\r\nof their business. In a recent campaign, one corporation, a life\r\ninsurance company, contributed $200,000; one railroad company gave\r\n$100,000; and many others $50,000. Sometimes a corporation contributes\r\nequally to the campaign funds of both parties, on the principle that it\r\nis a wise policy to be on good terms with each.\r\n\r\n_Contributions of Corporations now Forbidden._--The raising and spending\r\nof so much money as a part of the process of electing a President has\r\nrecently given rise to a demand that the sources of national campaign\r\ncontributions should be made public. Moreover, it is coming to be\r\nregarded as an evil that the large corporations who desire beneficial\r\nlegislation or immunity from prosecution should have become the chief\r\ncontributors to campaign funds. This feeling led to the enactment by\r\nCongress in 1907 of a law forbidding national banks and other\r\ncorporations which have charters granted by Congress, from making\r\ncontributions to the campaign funds of any party at any election,\r\nnational, state, or local. The law also prohibits any corporation,\r\nwhether chartered under the authority of the national government or not,\r\nfrom making campaign contributions at any election at which the\r\nPresident of the United States or any member of Congress is to be\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\n_Publicity of Campaign Contributions._--In 1910 Congress passed a law\r\nrequiring the treasurer of each national party committee to make and\r\npublish after the election a sworn statement showing every contribution\r\nof $100 or more received by him, every expenditure of $10 or more, and\r\nthe totals of all other contributions and expenditures.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1911, Congress went still further and passed a law requiring\r\nthe publication of such statements _before_ the election. The elections\r\naffected by these acts are those of President and members of Congress.\r\nThe act of 1911 forbids any candidate for representative to spend or\r\npromise more than $5,000, and any candidate for senator more than\r\n$10,000, in his campaign. And such candidates are required to file\r\nstatements of all campaign receipts and expenditures.\r\n\r\n=The Succession to the Presidency.=--The Constitution declares that in\r\ncase of the removal of the President from office, or of his death,\r\nresignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of his\r\noffice, the same shall devolve upon the Vice President. In case of the\r\nremoval, death, resignation, or inability of both the President and the\r\nVice President, Congress is authorized to provide for the succession.\r\nThe only way in which the President may be removed is by impeachment and\r\nconviction. President Johnson was impeached, mainly for the violation of\r\nthe tenure of office act, but the senate failed by one vote to convict\r\nhim. Had he been convicted the office would have been declared vacant.\r\nThere has been no instance of the resignation of a President.[72] Five\r\nPresidents have died in office: Harrison, Taylor, Lincoln, Garfield, and\r\nMcKinley. In each case the dead President was succeeded by the Vice\r\nPresident. No case of inability to discharge the duties of the\r\npresidential office has ever been construed as existing, though in fact\r\nsuch a case existed from July 2, 1881, when President Garfield was shot,\r\nto September 19, when he died. A similar case existed during the period\r\nin which President McKinley lingered on his deathbed, from September 6\r\nto September 14, 1901. In neither case did the Vice President assume the\r\nreins of office until death had made the office vacant. Likewise during\r\nPresident Wilson's serious illness in 1919-1920, the Vice President did\r\nnot act.\r\n\r\n    [72] John C. Calhoun resigned the Vice Presidency to become a senator\r\n    from South Carolina. The statutes provide that the President shall\r\n    signify his resignation, in case he resigns, by a letter to the\r\n    secretary of state.\r\n\r\n_Succession Law of 1792._--Congress provided by law in 1792 that in case\r\nof the removal, death, resignation, or inability of both the President\r\nand the Vice President, the president _pro tempore_ of the senate should\r\nsucceed, and after him the speaker of the house. There were several\r\npractical and political objections to this arrangement, however. In the\r\nfirst place, there might be considerable periods of time when there was\r\nno president _pro tempore_ of the senate or speaker of the house, and\r\nconsequently no one to succeed in case of a vacancy.[73] Another\r\nobjection to the law--political in character--was illustrated by the\r\nsituation that existed in 1886. The Democratic Vice President Hendricks\r\nhad died, and in case the presidential office had become vacant it would\r\nhave been filled by a Republican president of the senate. Thus the\r\nexecutive branch of the government would have passed from the hands of\r\nthe party that had carried the country at the last election, to the\r\nother party, merely by the death of a public officer.\r\n\r\n    [73] From March 4 to October 10, 1881, there was no president of the\r\n    senate, and from March 4 to December 15 of the same year there was no\r\n    speaker, the new house not having met and organized. Had Vice President\r\n    Arthur died before Mr. Garfield's death there would have been no one to\r\n    succeed to the vacancy until October 10, when a new president _pro\r\n    tempore_ of the senate was chosen.\r\n\r\n_Succession Act of 1886._--In 1886 Congress changed the law so as to\r\ngive the succession to the presidency to the members of the cabinet, in\r\nthe order of the creation of their departments, in case of the death or\r\nremoval of both the President and the Vice President. As the members of\r\nthe cabinet usually belong to the same party as the President and Vice\r\nPresident, the office in such a contingency would remain in the control\r\nof the party which elected the President at the last election. No\r\nspecial provision has yet been made, however, in regard to the\r\nsuccession in case the President elect and Vice President elect should\r\ndie after their election by the electoral college on the second Monday\r\nin January and before their inauguration on the 4th of March. The\r\nelectoral college could not be reconvened because it becomes _functus\r\nofficio_ immediately after electing the President. As the law stands,\r\nthe succession would probably go to some member of the old cabinet, who\r\nmight be of the opposite party. In such a case, however, Congress might\r\nprovide for a special presidential election.\r\n\r\n     =References.=--ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, pp. 166-177.\r\n     BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. ix.

Toward noon on that day\r\nhe proceeds to the White House, as the official residence of the\r\nPresident is styled, where he joins the outgoing President and both are\r\ndriven to the Capitol, followed by a procession. _The oath of office_ is\r\nusually administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on a\r\nplatform erected for the purpose at the east front of the Capitol, and\r\nin the presence of a vast throng of spectators from all parts of the\r\ncountry.[74] Following the custom set by the first Chief Executive, the\r\nPresident delivers a short _inaugural address_ in which he foreshadows\r\nin a general way his policy as President, after which he returns with\r\nthe Ex-President to the White House, where he reviews for several hours\r\nthe procession of visitors.\r\n\r\n    [74] The oath of office was administered to President Washington in New\r\n    York city, then the temporary seat of government, by Chancellor\r\n    Livingston of New York state. In 1917, the 4th of March falling on\r\n    Sunday, President Wilson took the oath of office twice: on Sunday in\r\n    his office at the Capitol, and on the following day publicly in\r\n    connection with the inaugural ceremonies.\r\n\r\n_Inaugural Pageantry._--The inauguration of the President is made the\r\noccasion of a great pageant, to which hundreds of thousands of visitors\r\nthrong from every part of the Union. In the procession which escorts the\r\nPresident to the Capitol are militia companies, headed by governors of\r\nstates, and civil organizations of every variety. Owing to the\r\ninclemency of the weather which often prevails at this season of the\r\nyear, it has been proposed to change the date of the inauguration, but\r\nsince this will involve an amendment to the Constitution if the\r\ninauguration is to take place at the beginning of the presidential term,\r\nthe success of the movement is doubtful.[75]\r\n\r\n    [75] When Vice Presidents Tyler, Johnson, Arthur, and Roosevelt\r\n    succeeded to the presidency, Congress was not in session and the oath\r\n    of office was administered without formalities. Mr. Arthur took the\r\n    oath in New York city before a local magistrate, and Mr. Roosevelt did\r\n    the same in Buffalo, where Mr. McKinley died. Vice President Fillmore,\r\n    however, took the oath of office as President in the presence of both\r\n    houses of Congress, which happened to be in session at the time of the\r\n    death of President Taylor.\r\n\r\n=Compensation of the President.=--The Constitution declares that the\r\nPresident shall, at stated times, receive for his services a\r\ncompensation which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the\r\ntime for which he has been elected. He is also forbidden to receive any\r\nother emolument either from the United States or from any state.\r\n\r\nThe salary of the President was $25,000 a year until 1873, when it was\r\nraised to $50,000. In 1909 it was raised to $75,000. Besides this salary\r\nthere is an allowance of $25,000 a year for traveling expenses, and\r\nallowances for clerks, automobiles, house furnishings, fuel, lighting,\r\netc., making in the aggregate some $250,000 a year. In the White House\r\nthe nation furnishes the President with both a private and an official\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n=Extent of the President's Powers.=--The powers of the President are\r\npartly conferred by the Constitution, partly by acts of Congress and\r\ntreaties, and are partly the result of usage and precedent. The power\r\nwhich has been wielded at any given time, however, has depended upon the\r\ninitiative and force of the President and the extent to which he enjoyed\r\nthe confidence of Congress and the people. Again, the power which may be\r\nrightfully exercised depends upon the state of affairs under which the\r\noffice is administered. In time of war the power of the President may be\r\nso expanded as to be limited in effect only by the necessities of the\r\nnational existence. The powers wielded by President Lincoln during the\r\nCivil War were so great as to cause him to be frequently referred to as\r\na dictator. After the outbreak of the war with Germany in 1917 vast and\r\nunprecedented powers were conferred on President Wilson by a succession\r\nof far-reaching acts of Congress. Among the extraordinary powers thus\r\nconferred on him were: the control of the manufacture and distribution\r\nof commodities needful for war purposes, the requisition of ships and\r\nother war supplies, the fixing of prices of coal, wheat, sugar, steel,\r\nand various other commodities, the taking over and operation of private\r\nship-building plants, the closing of liquor distilleries and the seizure\r\nof their stocks, the prohibition of exports to foreign countries, the\r\nseizure of German ships in American ports, the making of regulations in\r\nrespect to the treatment of enemy aliens, and the taking over and\r\noperation of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones.\r\n\r\n=Classes of Powers.=--The various powers and duties which have been\r\nconferred on the President by the Constitution and the laws may be\r\ngrouped under the following heads:\r\n\r\n1. The power and duty of executing the laws, including the power to\r\nappoint, direct, and remove public officers.\r\n\r\n2. The management of the foreign affairs of the country.\r\n\r\n3. The power to command the army and navy.\r\n\r\n4. Legislative powers, including the sending of messages to Congress,\r\nthe calling of extra sessions, and especially the power to veto acts of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n5. The power to grant pardons for offenses against the laws of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n=Execution of the Laws.=--The President is the head of the executive\r\nbranch of the government, and it is his duty to see that the\r\nConstitution is preserved, protected, and defended, and that the laws\r\nenacted in pursuance thereof, the treaties made under its authority, and\r\nthe decisions rendered by the federal courts are enforced throughout the\r\nUnited States. For these purposes the army, the navy, and the militia\r\nare at his disposal, and in case of resistance to the laws and authority\r\nof the United States, they may be employed by him in such manner as he\r\nmay direct, to overcome such resistance. Moreover, nearly all the civil\r\nand military officers of the United States are appointed by him and are,\r\nto a large degree, subject to his direction.\r\n\r\n_The President's Responsibility._--Unlike the state governments, the\r\nnational government is so organized as to concentrate the power and the\r\nresponsibility for the enforcement of the laws in the hands of a single\r\nexecutive. Those who are charged with aiding him in carrying out the\r\ngovernment are his own appointees, and their responsibility is primarily\r\nto him alone.\r\n\r\n=Power of Appointment.=--The Constitution declares that the President\r\nshall, with the \"advice and consent\" of the senate, appoint all officers\r\nof the United States whose appointment is not otherwise provided for by\r\nthe Constitution, except that Congress may vest the appointment of\r\ninferior officers in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in\r\nthe heads of departments.[76] This is one of the most important powers\r\ndevolving upon the President, and probably consumes more of his time\r\nthan all his other duties together. In the early days of the\r\nConstitution, the number of appointments was small, but as the\r\ngovernment service expanded, the number of offices to be filled steadily\r\nincreased until there are now about 11,000 important presidential\r\noffices, that is, offices filled by the President and the senate. The\r\ntenure of office act of 1820 fixed the terms of the great bulk of\r\nfederal offices at four years, and even where the term is not prescribed\r\nby statute, it is the custom for most appointees to be replaced at the\r\nexpiration of four years, so that in practice the four-year tenure is\r\nuniversal, except for federal judges, and each President must during his\r\nterm make appointments to nearly all the presidential offices. In making\r\nthese appointments he is not limited by any constitutional or statutory\r\nrequirements in regard to qualifications. He is the sole judge of the\r\nfitness of candidates for appointments. The only limitation upon his\r\npower is the necessity of securing the approval of the senate, a\r\nrequirement already discussed in chapter x, pages 190-191.\r\n\r\n    [76] The only officers appointed by the courts of law are clerks,\r\n    reporters, and other minor ministerial officers; but there are a large\r\n    number of inferior officers in the various departments who are\r\n    appointed by the heads of departments.\r\n\r\n_Appointments to Minor Positions_ are often made upon the\r\nrecommendations of the representative in Congress from the district in\r\nwhich the office is located, though many such appointments are now made\r\non the basis of examinations, under civil service rules. Obviously the\r\nPresident or the head of the department could not fill the thousands of\r\nminor positions of this sort without reliance upon the advice of others.\r\nThey cannot investigate personally every application for appointments of\r\nthis kind. It is natural, therefore, that they should accept the\r\nrecommendations of members of Congress, who are more apt to be\r\nacquainted with the qualifications of applicants in their districts, and\r\nwho are familiar with local conditions.\r\n\r\n=Power of Removal.=--While the Constitution expressly authorizes the\r\nPresident to appoint officers, with the consent of the senate, it is\r\ncompletely silent on the question of whether he may remove an officer,\r\neither with or without the consent of the senate. The only provision in\r\nthe Constitution in regard to removal is that which relates to\r\nimpeachment. It might, therefore, be contended that the only\r\nconstitutional method of depriving an incumbent of an office to which he\r\nhas been appointed is by impeachment. But this process of removal is so\r\ncumbersome and unwieldy that if it were the only means of getting rid of\r\nincompetent office-holders many unfit persons would remain in office\r\nindefinitely, and, besides, it would be impossible for the President,\r\nupon whom the responsibility for the enforcement of the laws rests, to\r\nsurround himself with officials in whose integrity and fitness he has\r\nconfidence. Moreover, to resort to the process of impeachment to remove\r\na person from a petty inferior office would be very much like shooting\r\nbirds with artillery intended for destroying battleships.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, therefore, it was recognized that there was another\r\nprocess of removal than by impeachment. But there was a difference of\r\nopinion as to whether that power lay with the President alone, or\r\nwhether he could remove only with the consent of the senate, as in the\r\ncase of appointments; or whether the power lay with Congress to\r\nprescribe how removals might be made. The matter was threshed over in\r\nthe first Congress after the Constitution went into effect, and it was\r\ndecided that the President might remove alone, without the necessity of\r\nsecuring the consent of the senate. But there was considerable fear that\r\nhe might abuse the power, and Madison is said to have declared that the\r\nwanton removal of a meritorious officer would subject him to\r\nimpeachment.\r\n\r\n_Early Practice._--For a long time the power of removal was used\r\nsparingly. Several of the early Presidents, in fact, made no removals at\r\nall, and during the first forty years of our national existence the\r\ntotal number of officers removed probably did not exceed 100. With the\r\nincoming of President Jackson, however, what is known as the _spoils\r\nsystem_ was introduced; that is, large numbers of office-holders were\r\nremoved in order to make places for those who had rendered political\r\nservices to the party in power. Henceforth appointments were made\r\nlargely as rewards for party service, often without regard to merit and\r\nfitness. Nevertheless, the right of the President to make removals for\r\nany cause that seemed to him proper, or for any cause whatsoever,\r\ncontinued to be recognized and acquiesced in by all parties until the\r\nbreach occurred between President Johnson and Congress in 1867.\r\n\r\n_Act of 1867._--The action of President Johnson in removing officials\r\nwho were in sympathy with Congress greatly offended that body, and in\r\n1867 a tenure of office act was passed forbidding the President to make\r\nremovals except with the consent of the Senate.[77] Thus the custom which\r\nfor seventy-eight years had recognized the unlimited right of the\r\nPresident to remove officers without the necessity of securing the\r\nconsent of the senate was now reversed. The violation of this law by\r\nPresident Johnson was the chief cause of his impeachment in 1868. With\r\nthe incoming of President Grant, however, the law was modified, and in\r\n1887 it was repealed. Thus after a brief interval the original\r\ninterpretation was reverted to, and it has been followed ever since.\r\n\r\n    [77] While Congress was not in session, the President was to be allowed\r\n    the right to \"suspend\" officers for good cause, but he was required to\r\n    report all suspensions to the Senate at its next meeting and in case it\r\n    refused to concur in the suspension, the suspended officer was to be\r\n    allowed to resume his office.\r\n\r\n_The Present Rule._--The right of the President to remove any federal\r\nofficer appointed by him, except the judges, for any cause whatsoever,\r\nis now recognized, and Congress cannot abridge that right by prescribing\r\nthe conditions under which removals may be made. His power in this\r\nrespect is absolute and unlimited and may be employed for rewarding his\r\npolitical friends and punishing his enemies as well as for getting rid\r\nof incompetent and unfit persons in the public service.\r\n\r\n=Power of Direction.=--Resulting from the power of removal is the power\r\nof the President to direct the officers whom he appoints, in regard to\r\nthe discharge of their duties. Through the threat of removal, he may\r\ncompel obedience to his orders, though of course he cannot require an\r\nofficer to do an act which would amount to a violation of the law. Many\r\nof the duties of federal officers are prescribed by law, and the\r\nPresident cannot change these duties or require an officer to do his\r\nduty differently from the way in which the law requires him to do it.\r\nBut the law expressly recognizes that the President has the power to\r\ndirect many officers as to their duties. Thus the secretary of state in\r\nthe negotiation of treaties and the settlement of disputes with foreign\r\ncountries is almost wholly under the control of the President. The\r\nPresident may instruct him to begin negotiations with a particular\r\ngovernment or to cease negotiations, and the secretary must obey his\r\norders. So the President may direct the secretary of war in regard to\r\nthe disposition of the armed forces. In the same way he may order the\r\nattorney-general to prosecute a \"trust\" or institute proceedings against\r\nany violator of the federal laws, or may direct him to drop proceedings\r\nonce begun. Some officers, however, such as the secretary of the\r\ntreasury and the postmaster-general, are less under the direction of the\r\nPresident, their duties being prescribed with more or less detail by\r\nacts of Congress.[78]\r\n\r\n    [78] The act organizing the treasury department requires the secretary\r\n    of the treasury to make his annual report to Congress, while the other\r\n    cabinet heads make their reports to the President. It was the evident\r\n    intention of Congress to keep the secretary of the treasury more\r\n    closely under the control of the representatives of the people.\r\n\r\n=The Civil Service System.=--For a half century following the\r\nintroduction of the spoils system by President Jackson, both parties\r\nacted on the principle that the offices of the federal government were\r\nthe legitimate spoils of victory at the polls. Under such circumstances\r\nthe public service was demoralized and enfeebled, and the time of the\r\nPresident and heads of the departments was taken up with considering\r\napplications for office when it should have been devoted to more\r\nimportant matters. After the Civil War, a movement was started which had\r\nfor its purpose the establishment of the merit system in the public\r\nservice and the elimination of the spoils system.\r\n\r\n_The Civil Service Law of 1883._--The assassination of President\r\nGarfield in 1881 by a disappointed office seeker aroused public opinion\r\nto some of the worst evils of the existing system, and in obedience to\r\nthe demands of public sentiment, Congress in 1883 enacted the civil\r\nservice law which forms the basis of the present civil service system.\r\nThis law provided for the creation of a commission of three persons, not\r\nmore than two of whom should belong to the same political party. The\r\ncommission was charged with forming rules for making appointments to the\r\npublic service, and with carrying out the provisions of the law.\r\n\r\n_The Classified Service._--The act provided for the classification of\r\nthe positions in the departments at Washington and in the customhouses\r\nand post offices where at least fifty persons were employed, and for the\r\nholding, under the supervision of the commission, of competitive\r\nexaminations to test the fitness of applicants for appointments to\r\npositions in the classified service. The classified service now includes\r\nthe departmental service at Washington, the customs service, the post\r\noffice service, the railway mail service, the Indian service, the\r\ninternal revenue service, and the government printing service.\r\n\r\n_Extent of the Classified Service._--At first the law applied to only\r\nabout 14,000 positions, but since then the number has been increased\r\nfrom time to time by the creation of new offices and by orders of\r\nPresidents extending the rules to other classes of positions. A large\r\nextension, for example, was made by President Cleveland in 1896.\r\nPresident Roosevelt also made large extensions, so that when he went out\r\nof office there were about twice as many positions under the rules as\r\nthere were when he became President. In 1912 President Taft added over\r\n36,000 fourth-class postmasters and 20,000 artisans employed in the navy\r\nyards; and in 1917 President Wilson placed 10,000 first-, second-, and\r\nthird-class postmasters under the rules. Of 517,805 officers and\r\nemployees in the executive civil service in 1917, 326,899 were subject\r\nto competitive examination.\r\n\r\n_Exempt Positions._--Among the positions not under the rules and for\r\nwhich competitive examinations are not required are the more important\r\npresidential offices such as cabinet officers, assistant secretaries,\r\nchiefs of bureaus, United States attorneys, marshals, judges,\r\nambassadors and ministers, besides a large number of minor officials\r\nlike private secretaries. The income tax and currency acts of 1913\r\nexempted from the operation of the civil service laws employees who\r\ncollect the income tax and employees of the Federal Reserve Board. By an\r\nact of the same year deputy collectors of internal revenue and deputy\r\nmarshals were withdrawn from the operation of the laws. These acts have\r\nbeen criticized by civil service reformers.\r\n\r\n_Examinations._--Civil service examinations are held at least twice each\r\nyear in every state and territory, and any citizen of the United States\r\nis eligible to take the examination for any position to be filled. The\r\ncommission keeps a list of eligibles, that is, of persons who have\r\npassed an examination, and whenever an appointment is to be made, it\r\ncertifies to the appointing authority a list of those who are qualified,\r\nand from the three standing highest on the list the appointment must be\r\nmade. But in making the appointments preference must be given to persons\r\nhonorably discharged from the military or naval service by reason of\r\ntheir disability resulting from wounds or sickness. The examinations are\r\nrequired to be practical in character and of such a nature as to test,\r\nas far as possible, the capacity and fitness of the applicants to\r\ndischarge the duties of the position for which they desire an\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nNo appointment is permanent until after six months of probationary\r\nservice, during which time the appointee must have demonstrated his\r\ncapacity for the office. The law also prohibits members of Congress\r\nfrom making recommendations for appointments to positions in the\r\nclassified service except as to the character and residence of the\r\napplicant, and also forbids the levying of assessments on government\r\nemployees for campaign purposes or the solicitation of contributions\r\nfrom employees.[79]\r\n\r\n    [79] By a law of 1907, employees in the classified service are\r\n    forbidden to take active part in political campaigns, and this\r\n    prohibition has been construed to forbid service on political\r\n    committees, service as delegates to party conventions, publication\r\n    of newspaper articles of a political nature, membership in political\r\n    clubs, circulation of petitions of a political character, etc.\r\n\r\n_How Removals are Made._--When an appointment has been made in pursuance\r\nof the civil service rules, the appointee is protected from removal for\r\npolitical reasons. The rules now in force declare that removals from the\r\ncompetitive service can be made only for just cause and for reasons\r\nstated in writing, with an opportunity to the employee to be heard.\r\n\"Just cause\" is defined as being any cause not merely political or\r\nreligious, which will promote the efficiency of the service.\r\n\r\n_The Effect_ of the competitive system has been to give the public\r\nservice the character of permanency and increased efficiency. The\r\nadministration may change at Washington, but the more than 200,000\r\nofficials under the civil service rules are not affected thereby. There\r\nis no longer a \"clean sweep\" at the beginning of every administration,\r\nno longer the demoralization that once characterized the government\r\nservice when a new party came into power. Thus the whole tone of the\r\npublic service has been improved, and the President and heads of the\r\ndepartments have been partly relieved from the burden of listening to\r\nthe appeals of the army of office seekers who used to descend upon\r\nWashington at the beginning of every new administration.\r\n\r\n=Management of Foreign Affairs.=--The United States as a leading member\r\nof the family of nations has an extensive intercourse with other\r\ncountries. There is no nation with which it has not entered into\r\nrelations of some kind or another. With every civilized country and some\r\nthat are not civilized, we have one or more treaties regulating certain\r\nof our relations with them.\r\n\r\n_How Treaties are Negotiated._--The President, by and with the advice\r\nand consent of the senate, two thirds of the members concurring, is\r\ncharged with the negotiation of all treaties. The share of the senate in\r\nthe negotiation of all treaties has already been discussed in chapter x.\r\n\r\nThe President usually does not conduct negotiations himself,[80] but acts\r\nthrough the secretary of state, who is a sort of minister of foreign\r\naffairs. The secretary is subject to his directions, however, and while\r\nconducting negotiations keeps the President fully informed of their\r\nprogress, and secures his approval of all points which in his judgment\r\nshould be submitted to him for an opinion. Foreign ministers at\r\nWashington who wish to discuss questions of foreign policy with the\r\nPresident are referred to the secretary, who is his responsible minister\r\nin such matters. Ambassadors, ministers, and consuls of the United\r\nStates are appointed by the President, though the approval of the senate\r\nis essential to the validity of the appointment. Diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives sent abroad bear letters of credence signed by the\r\nPresident, and from time to time they are given instructions as to the\r\naction they shall take in negotiations with foreign governments. These\r\ninstructions are prepared by the secretary of state, though in\r\nimportant cases he consults the President and ascertains his wishes in\r\nthe matter. The President may transfer a minister from one post to\r\nanother, may recall him, or dismiss him whenever he likes.\r\n\r\n    [80] In 1915-1919, however, President Wilson wrote notes to the German\r\n    government, and took part in framing the treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n_Power to \"Receive\" Foreign Ministers._--The President is also the\r\nauthority designated by the Constitution for receiving ambassadors and\r\nministers accredited by foreign governments to the government of the\r\nUnited States. To receive a foreign minister is to recognize him as the\r\nofficial representative to the United States of the government which has\r\nappointed him. When a new minister arrives at Washington, he is escorted\r\nto the White House by the secretary of state on a day agreed upon, and\r\nis received by the President. The new minister presents his credentials\r\nand delivers a short ceremonial address, to which the President\r\nresponds. He is then recognized as the official organ of communication\r\nbetween the United States government and the government which he\r\nrepresents. The President, however, may refuse to recognize a minister\r\nfrom a country whose independence is in doubt, or one who is personally\r\nobjectionable to the United States government. He may also request a\r\nforeign government to recall a minister accredited to the United States,\r\nor may dismiss one for conduct highly offensive to the government.\r\n\r\n=The Military Powers of the President.=--The Constitution declares that\r\nthe President shall be commander in chief of the army and navy and also\r\nof the militia of the several states whenever it is called into the\r\nservice of the United States. The power to declare war, however, belongs\r\nto Congress, though the President may through his management of the\r\nforeign affairs of the country bring about a situation which may make a\r\ndeclaration of war a virtual necessity. Congress also determines the\r\nstrength of the army, the method of raising the forces, their terms of\r\nservice, pay, subsistence, organization, equipment, location of forts,\r\nand indeed everything relating to its make-up.\r\n\r\n_Extent of the President's Power._--The President, as commander in\r\nchief, decides where the troops are to be located, and where the ships\r\nare to be stationed. It is upon his orders that the troops are\r\nmobilized, the fleets assembled, and the militia of the states called\r\nout. He may direct the campaigns and might, if he wished, take personal\r\ncommand of the army, the navy, or the militia, though in practice he\r\nnever does, the army, in fact, being commanded by a military officer and\r\nthe navy by a naval officer. He may do whatever, in his judgment, may\r\nconduce to the destruction of the power or the weakening of the strength\r\nof the enemy, so long as he acts within the accepted rules of\r\ninternational law. His power, in short, is limited only by the\r\nrequirements of military necessity and the law of nations. Thus he may\r\ndeclare that any property used by the enemy for warlike purposes or\r\nwhich may in other respects be a source of strength to the enemy shall\r\nbe subject to confiscation. It was in pursuance of this power that\r\nPresident Lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation freeing the\r\nslaves in certain of the Southern states during the Civil War.\r\n\r\n_Power to Govern Occupied Territory._--When an enemy's territory has\r\nonce been occupied by the army, the President, as commander in chief,\r\nmay assume control and govern it through such agencies and in such\r\nmanner as he may see fit. He may displace the existing authorities or\r\nmake use of them as he wishes. He may appoint military governors and set\r\nup special tribunals in the place of existing courts. He may suspend the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus, institute martial law, and deprive the\r\ninhabitants of other safeguards established by the Constitution for\r\ntheir protection against the arbitrary encroachments of the government.\r\nBy virtue of this authority President Lincoln governed for some time\r\nthose parts of the South which came under the jurisdiction of the\r\nmilitary forces of the United States during the Civil War. In the same\r\nway President McKinley governed Porto Rico and the Philippines for many\r\nmonths during and after the war with Spain.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._--From this summary it will readily be seen that the\r\npowers of the President as commander in chief during war are very great,\r\nin fact almost unlimited. He may become, as President Lincoln did,\r\npractically a dictator, and if he should choose to abuse his powers he\r\nmight deprive the people of a large portion of their liberties.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace, the military powers of the President are far less than\r\nduring war, though they are still considerable. His duty to protect the\r\nstates against invasion and his power to order out the troops to\r\nsuppress domestic violence upon the application of the state executive\r\nor legislature are discussed in chapter iii. Whenever the movement of\r\ninterstate commerce or the instrumentalities of the national government\r\nare interfered with by rioters it is his right and duty to employ the\r\narmy or the navy if necessary to suppress the disturbances.[81] By an act\r\nof Congress passed in 1795 and still in force, the President is\r\nauthorized to call out the militia whenever the laws of the United\r\nStates are opposed or their execution obstructed by combinations too\r\npowerful, in his judgment, to be suppressed by the ordinary course of\r\njudicial proceedings, or by the federal marshals. And the President is\r\nthe sole judge of the existence of the state of facts thus described,\r\nand no court in the land can review his decision in regard thereto. It\r\nwas in pursuance of this act that President Lincoln issued his first\r\ncall for the militia in 1861.\r\n\r\n    [81] See further on this point, pp. 60-62.\r\n\r\n=The President's Share in Legislation.=--While the chief duty of the\r\nPresident is to execute the laws, he is at the same time given a share\r\nin their making. This share is both positive and negative in character.\r\n\r\n=Presidential Messages.=--The Constitution makes it his duty to give\r\nCongress from time to time information of the state of the Union and to\r\nrecommend for its consideration such measures as he may judge necessary\r\nand proper. This requirement rests upon the obvious fact that he\r\npossesses more extensive sources of knowledge in regard to the state of\r\npublic affairs than any one else, and is also familiar with the workings\r\nof the laws, and hence is in a position to recommend legislation for\r\ntheir improvement.\r\n\r\nThe information required to be furnished Congress is contained in an\r\nannual message communicated at the beginning of each session, and in\r\nspecial messages communicated from time to time during the session.\r\n\r\n_Early Practice._--It was the custom at the beginning of our national\r\nhistory for the President to deliver an address at the opening of\r\nCongress, in the presence of both houses assembled in the senate\r\nchamber, and for each house thereafter to draw up a suitable reply, in\r\naccordance with the English custom. This plan was followed by both\r\nWashington and Adams, but Jefferson inaugurated the practice of\r\ncommunicating what he had to say in the form of a written message. From\r\nthat time down till 1913 all the presidential messages to Congress were\r\nin written form only; but in the latter year President Wilson revived\r\nthe practice of addressing Congress in person.\r\n\r\n_Character of the Annual Messages._--The annual message contains a\r\nreview of the operations of the government during the preceding year,\r\ntogether with such recommendations for additional legislation as the\r\nPresident thinks the interests of the country require. It also usually\r\ncontains a summary of the reports of the several heads of departments,\r\nand is accompanied by the full reports of the departments. Sometimes one\r\nor the other of the houses adopts resolutions calling on the President\r\nfor information on particular subjects, and if in his judgment the\r\ncommunication of the information is not incompatible with the public\r\ninterests, the request is complied with.\r\n\r\nThe message is printed in full in nearly all the daily newspapers of the\r\ncountry on the day on which it is communicated to Congress, and it is\r\nwidely read by the people and commented on by editors. When the message\r\nhas been received by the Congress, it is ordered to be printed, and the\r\nvarious recommendations which it contains are distributed among the\r\nappropriate committees of each house. The consideration which the\r\nrecommendations receive at the hands of Congress depends upon the\r\ninfluence which the President wields with the two houses. If he belongs\r\nto a different political party from that which is in control of\r\nCongress, or if for other reasons Congress is out of sympathy with his\r\npolicies, his recommendations count for little.\r\n\r\n=Power to Call Extraordinary Sessions.=--The President has power to call\r\nextraordinary sessions of Congress for the consideration of special\r\nmatters of an urgent character. Of course the President cannot compel\r\nCongress to adopt his recommendations at a special session any more than\r\nat a regular session, but he can sometimes hasten action and if he is\r\nbacked by a strong public opinion he may be able to accomplish even\r\nmore. The authority to call extraordinary sessions has been exercised by\r\nPresidents Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Van Buren, Harrison, Pierce,\r\nLincoln, Hayes, Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson. In all\r\nthese cases Congress was called together to deal with extraordinary\r\nsituations such as foreign difficulties, financial panics, rebellion,\r\nthe enactment of appropriation bills which had failed at the regular\r\nsession, the enactment of tariff bills for which there was an urgent\r\ndemand, the approval of reciprocity treaties, and the like. The senate\r\nhas often been convened in extraordinary session at the beginning of a\r\nnew administration for the purpose of approving the nominations of the\r\nPresident, but the house of representatives has never been called alone.\r\n\r\n=Power to Adjourn Congress.=--The President is also authorized to\r\nadjourn the two houses in case of disagreement between them as to the\r\ntime for adjourning the session. Only one such case of disagreement has\r\never occurred, namely, in the special session of November, 1903, when\r\nthe senate proposed to adjourn and the house of representatives refused.\r\nPresident Roosevelt did not, however, exercise his power in this case,\r\nso the special session continued about two weeks longer, until it was\r\nended by the beginning of the regular session.\r\n\r\n=Power to Issue Ordinances.=--Under the legislative functions of the\r\nPresident may also be included what is known as the ordinance power,\r\nthat is, the power to issue certain orders and regulations having the\r\nforce of law. Such are the regulations for the government of the army\r\nand navy, and those relating to the postal service, patents, pensions,\r\npublic lands, Indian affairs, the customs service, internal revenue\r\nservice, marine hospital service, the consular service, the civil\r\nservice, and many other branches of administration. Some of these\r\nregulations are issued by the President under express authority\r\nconferred upon him by acts of Congress; others are issued as a result\r\nof the necessity of prescribing means for carrying into effect the laws\r\nof Congress and sometimes of interpreting them;[82] while still others\r\nare issued in pursuance of the constitutional powers of the President.\r\nSuch are the regulations issued for the government of the army and navy,\r\nin pursuance of the authority of the President as commander in chief.\r\n\r\n    [82] A recent example is found in the regulations issued by President\r\n    Taft for putting into effect the new law levying a tax on corporations.\r\n    The meaning of the law in various particulars had to be interpreted,\r\n    and the method and means of assessing and collecting the tax had to be\r\n    prescribed. Another example was the regulations issued by President\r\n    Wilson in 1913 for the collection of the income tax.\r\n\r\n=The Veto Power.=--Finally, the President is given an important share in\r\nlegislation through the constitutional requirement which requires that\r\nall bills and resolutions passed by Congress shall be submitted for his\r\napproval.[83] The power to withhold his approval of the acts passed by\r\nCongress is popularly known as the veto power. It was called by the\r\nframers of the Constitution the President's \"qualified negative.\" This\r\nprerogative constitutes an exception to the principle of the separation\r\nof governmental powers, and was conferred upon the executive as a means\r\nof enabling him to defend his constitutional powers and privileges\r\nagainst the encroachments of the legislative department, as well as to\r\nprovide a check upon hasty and careless legislation by Congress. The\r\nconditions under which the right of veto may be exercised, the forms\r\nwhich it may take, and the procedure by which it may be overridden by\r\nCongress are discussed in chapter xi. The President may veto a bill\r\nbecause he believes it to be unconstitutional, or because he believes it\r\nis unwise or inexpedient, though in both cases a wise executive will be\r\nslow to set his judgment against the combined judgment of the members of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n    [83] Ex-President Benjamin Harrison, in his book \"This Country of\r\n    Ours,\" p. 138, thus describes the course which a bill takes after it\r\n    has passed both houses: \"When a bill has passed both houses of Congress\r\n    and has been signed by the president of the senate and the speaker of\r\n    the house, it is taken, by the clerk of the committee on enrolled\r\n    bills, to the Executive Mansion, where the date of its delivery is\r\n    stamped upon it. The practice is then to send the bill to the head of\r\n    the department to which its subject matter belongs--to the war\r\n    department, if to army matters; to the interior, if to pensions, or\r\n    public lands, or Indian affairs, etc.--for the examination of the\r\n    secretary, and for a report from him as to any objections that may\r\n    occur to him. As to the frame of the bill, and as to any constitutional\r\n    questions involved, the attorney-general is often consulted, though the\r\n    bill does not relate to his department. The President then takes up the\r\n    bill, with the report from the department, and examines it, and if he\r\n    approves writes thereon \"Approved,\" giving the date, and signs his\r\n    name. The bill, now become a law, is then sent to the state department\r\n    to be filed and published in the statutes at large.\"\r\n\r\n_No Power to Veto Items in Appropriation Bills._--Unlike the governors\r\nof many of the states, he cannot veto particular items in appropriation\r\nbills, as a result of which he is sometimes confronted with the\r\nembarrassing duty of signing a bill carrying certain appropriations to\r\nwhich he objects, or of vetoing the entire bill. President Cleveland on\r\none occasion vetoed the rivers and harbors bill carrying an\r\nappropriation of many millions of dollars rather than approve certain\r\nitems in it which he considered wasteful and extravagant. If the\r\nPresident had the power to veto particular items in appropriation bills\r\nhe could prevent useless and extravagant appropriations in many cases\r\nwithout being under the necessity of defeating at the same time those\r\nwhich are desirable and necessary.\r\n\r\n_Use of the Veto Power._--The early Presidents either did not make use\r\nof the veto power at all, or employed it sparingly. Neither John Adams,\r\nnor Thomas Jefferson, nor John Quincy Adams, while in the presidential\r\nchair, vetoed any bills; and Washington, Madison, and Monroe together\r\nvetoed only eight. Many of the later Presidents used the veto power more\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\nNo bill was passed over the veto of a President until the administration\r\nof Tyler, when one was so passed. Four bills were passed over the vetoes\r\nof Pierce, fourteen over those of Johnson, three over those of Grant,\r\none over a veto of Hayes, one over a veto of Arthur, two over the vetoes\r\nof Cleveland, one each over the vetoes of Harrison, Taft, and Wilson.\r\n\r\n_Joint Resolutions_ as well as bills are usually presented to the\r\nPresident for his signature, and must be approved before they have any\r\nvalidity, though it has not been the practice to submit to the\r\nPresident, for his approval, joint resolutions proposing amendments to\r\nthe Constitution. Concurrent resolutions, which do not have the force of\r\nlaw, but are merely expressions of the sense of the legislative\r\ndepartment on some question of interest to it alone, do not require the\r\napproval of the President.[84]\r\n\r\n    [84] The distinction between bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent\r\n    resolutions is discussed on p. 204.\r\n\r\n_Importance of the Veto._--The threat of the President to employ the\r\nveto may be used to great effect. A strong President who has positive\r\nideas in regard to the kind of legislation which the country needs and\r\nwhich public opinion demands, may compel the adoption in whole or in\r\npart of those ideas by the threatened use of the veto. The necessity of\r\nobtaining the approval of the President really gives him a powerful\r\nshare in legislation. Roosevelt, for example, on a number of occasions\r\nthreatened to veto bills about to be passed by Congress unless they\r\nwere changed so as to embody the ideas which he advocated, and the\r\nthreats were not without effect.\r\n\r\n=The Pardoning Power of the President.=--The Constitution authorizes the\r\nPresident \"to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the\r\nUnited States except in cases of impeachment.\"[85] The President cannot,\r\nof course, pardon offenses against state law. Offenses against the\r\npostal laws, the revenue laws, the laws against counterfeiting, and the\r\nnational banking laws are those for which pardons are most frequently\r\nsought. Crimes committed in the territories are, however, offenses\r\nagainst the laws of the United States, and are frequently the object of\r\napplications for pardon.\r\n\r\n    [85] Impeachment offenses were excepted for the purpose of preventing\r\n    the President from granting pardons to his own appointees and thereby\r\n    shielding them from the consequences of their acts.\r\n\r\n    For definition of pardon and reprieve, and further discussion of the\r\n    nature and purpose of the pardoning power, see p. 102-103.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the limitation in regard to impeachment offenses,\r\nthe President's power of pardon is absolute. His power is not restricted\r\nby a board of pardons as is that of the governors of some of the states,\r\nnor can Congress in any way abridge his power or restrict the effect of\r\na pardon granted by him. Moreover, he may grant a pardon before as well\r\nas after conviction, though this is rarely done in the case of\r\nindividual offenses. It is sometimes done, however, where large numbers\r\nof persons have become liable to criminal prosecution for participation\r\nin rebellion, resistance to the laws, and similar acts.\r\n\r\n_Amnesty._--In such cases the pardon is known as an \"amnesty,\" and is\r\ngranted by proclamation. Thus in December, 1863, President Lincoln\r\nissued an amnesty proclamation offering a full pardon to all persons in\r\narms against the United States provided they would lay down their arms\r\nand return to their allegiance. In April, 1865, President Johnson issued\r\na proclamation offering amnesty to all those who had borne arms against\r\nthe United States, with certain exceptions and subject to certain\r\nconditions. The last instance of the kind was the proclamation issued by\r\nPresident Harrison, in 1893, granting amnesty to those Mormons who had\r\nviolated the anti-polygamy laws of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Commutation._--The power to pardon is held also to include the power to\r\ncommute a sentence from a heavier to a lighter penalty, and also to\r\nreduce a fine or remit it entirely.\r\n\r\n_Parole._--In 1910, Congress passed a law providing for the release on\r\nparole of federal prisoners sentenced to a term of more than one year,\r\nexcept life prisoners, provided their conduct has been satisfactory. At\r\neach of the three federal prisons there is a board of parole charged\r\nwith hearing applications for release.\r\n\r\n=Immunity of the President from Judicial Control.=--Being at the head of\r\na coördinate department of the government, the President, unlike other\r\npublic officers, is not subject to the control of the courts. They\r\ncannot issue processes against him, or restrain him or compel him to\r\nperform any act. During the trial of Aaron Burr for treason, Chief\r\nJustice Marshall issued a subpoena directed to President Jefferson\r\nrequiring him to produce a certain paper relating to Burr's acts, but\r\nthe President refused to obey the writ, declaring that if the chief\r\nexecutive could be compelled to obey the processes of the courts he\r\nmight be prevented from the discharge of his duties. Even if the\r\nPresident were to commit an act of violence, he could not be arrested or\r\nin any way restrained of his liberty. The only remedy against acts of\r\nviolence committed by him is impeachment by the house of representatives\r\nand trial by the Senate. If convicted, he must be deprived of his\r\noffice, after which his immunity ends and he is liable to prosecution\r\nand trial in the ordinary courts as any other offender. The principle\r\nupon which the President is exempt from the control of the courts is not\r\nthat he can do no wrong, but that if he were subject to judicial\r\nrestraint and compelled to obey the processes of the courts, the\r\nadministration of the duties of his high office might be interfered\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Supreme Court does not hesitate to exercise control\r\nover the subordinates through whom the President acts in most cases, and\r\nit will refuse to sanction orders or regulations promulgated by him if\r\nthey are unconstitutional. To this extent, his acts are subject to\r\njudicial control.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, pp. 180-201.\r\n     BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. x.

They are, in the order of rank, the\r\nsecretary of state (first styled the secretary of foreign affairs), the\r\nsecretary of the treasury, the secretary of war, the attorney-general,\r\nthe postmaster-general, the secretary of the navy, the secretary of the\r\ninterior, the secretary of agriculture, the secretary of commerce, and\r\nthe secretary of labor. They are appointed by the President with the\r\nconsent of the senate, which in practice is never refused; and they may\r\nbe dismissed by him at any time. The salary of cabinet members is\r\n$12,000 a year.\r\n\r\n=Origin and Nature of the Cabinet.=--There was no thought in the\r\nbeginning that the heads of departments should constitute a cabinet or\r\nadvisory council to the President, and during the first administration\r\nthey were never, as a matter of fact, convened by him for collective\r\nconsultation. When their opinions or advice were desired they were\r\nrequested by written communication. During his second term, however,\r\nPresident Washington adopted the practice of assembling the heads of\r\ndepartments occasionally for consultation not only on matters pertaining\r\nto their particular departments but in regard to questions of general\r\nexecutive policy. Thus the cabinet meeting became a regular feature of\r\nexecutive procedure, and the cabinet a permanent institution. It is\r\nwell to remember, however, that the cabinet as such is not mentioned in\r\nthe Constitution, and the name \"cabinet\" never appeared in any law until\r\nthe year 1907. No record is kept of its proceedings.\r\n\r\n_Cabinet Responsibility._--Unlike a European cabinet, the members of the\r\nPresident's cabinet are not, and cannot be, members of either house of\r\nCongress; they have no seats in Congress; they are not responsible to\r\nCongress for their policies, and they never think of resigning when\r\nCongress refuses to carry out their recommendations or to approve their\r\nofficial acts. They are responsible solely to the President for their\r\nofficial conduct, and are subject to his direction, except in so far as\r\ntheir duties are prescribed by law. They are, in short, the ministers of\r\nthe President, not of Congress; administrative chiefs, not parliamentary\r\nleaders. It may happen, therefore, that members of the cabinet, like the\r\nPresident, may belong to the party which is in the minority in\r\nCongress.[86]\r\n\r\n    [86] There is little resemblance between the American cabinet and a\r\n    European ministry. In foreign countries where the parliamentary system\r\n    prevails, cabinet ministers are chosen from the party having control of\r\n    the Parliament; they are usually members of Parliament, but whether\r\n    they are or not they are entitled to seats therein; and they prepare\r\n    and introduce all important legislative measures, urge their adoption\r\n    by the Parliament, and defend their political policies and acts\r\n    whenever they are attacked. To one or both of the legislative chambers\r\n    they are responsible for their political acts, and whenever they cease\r\n    to command the support of the chamber to which they are responsible\r\n    they must resign and make way for a new cabinet which does possess its\r\n    confidence. It is thus impossible for the legislative and executive\r\n    departments of the government to be antagonistic.\r\n\r\n=The Department of State.=--At the head of the department of state is\r\nthe secretary of state, who is the ranking member of the cabinet and the\r\nfirst in line for the presidency in case of the death or removal of\r\nboth President and Vice President. He sits at the right hand of the\r\nPresident at cabinet meetings and is given precedence over his\r\ncolleagues on occasions of ceremony. There are also three assistant\r\nsecretaries in the department, and a counselor, who advises the\r\nPresident and Secretary of State in regard to questions of international\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the secretary of state fall into three groups: first, he\r\nis the custodian of the great seal and of the archives of the United\r\nStates. In this capacity he receives the acts and resolutions of\r\nCongress, publishes them in certain papers, and preserves the originals.\r\nUnder this head also fall the duties of countersigning proclamations and\r\nimportant commissions of the President and of attaching thereto the\r\ngreat seal. In the second place, the secretary of state is the organ of\r\ncommunication between the national government and the state governments.\r\nThus an application from the governor of a state for troops to suppress\r\ndomestic violence, or a request for the extradition of a criminal who\r\nhas taken refuge in a foreign country, is made through the secretary of\r\nstate. In the third place, the secretary of state is the organ of\r\ncommunication between the United States and foreign powers, that is, he\r\nis the minister of foreign affairs. He carries on all correspondence\r\nwith foreign governments, negotiates treaties, countersigns warrants for\r\nthe extradition of fugitives from the justice of foreign countries,\r\nissues passports to American citizens wishing to travel abroad, and\r\ngrants exequaturs to foreign consuls in the United States.\r\n\r\n=The Diplomatic Service.=--For purposes of administration the department\r\nof state is organized into a number of bureaus and divisions. _The\r\nDiplomatic Bureau_ prepares diplomatic correspondence with foreign\r\ngovernments, and has charge of the engrossing of treaties and other\r\nformal papers, the preparation of the credentials of diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives, and of ceremonious letters. The United States\r\ngovernment is now represented at the governments of nearly fifty\r\ndifferent foreign countries by diplomatic representatives, and most of\r\nthese governments maintain diplomatic representatives at Washington. Our\r\nrepresentatives to Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Spain, Argentina,\r\nand Chile bear the rank of ambassador. The government is represented at\r\nmost of the other countries by envoys extraordinary and ministers\r\nplenipotentiary; but to one country (Liberia) it sends a minister\r\nresident. The principal difference between the different classes of\r\nministers is one of rank and precedence. At the more important foreign\r\nposts the ambassador or minister is provided with from one to three\r\nsecretaries. There are also interpreters at the legations in Oriental\r\ncountries, and at all the important foreign capitals military and naval\r\nattachés are attached to the legation.\r\n\r\n_Elimination of the Spoils System._--The efficiency of the diplomatic\r\nservice has been much impaired by the existence of the spoils system, as\r\na result of which diplomatic appointments are determined largely by\r\npolitical considerations, and changes are made by each new\r\nadministration. In the administrations of Presidents Roosevelt and Taft,\r\nhowever, a beginning was made toward the introduction of the merit\r\nsystem into the diplomatic service.\r\n\r\n_Duties of Diplomatic Representatives._--The principal duties of\r\ndiplomatic representatives are to watch over the interests of their\r\ncountry and its citizens in the country to which they are accredited and\r\nto see that they receive proper protection, to present and cause to be\r\nsettled all claims against the foreign country in which they reside, to\r\nnegotiate treaties, to settle disputes and adjust difficulties, to\r\npromote friendly relations, and, in general, to represent their\r\ngovernment in its relations with the government to which they are\r\naccredited. It is also the duty of a diplomatic representative to keep\r\nhis government fully informed on all matters in which it is likely to be\r\ninterested. He is expected to transmit reports relating to political\r\nconditions, finance, commerce, agriculture, arts and science, systems of\r\ntaxation, population, judicial statistics, new inventions, and other\r\nmatters of possible interest to his government.\r\n\r\nThe procedure by which treaties are negotiated may take either of two\r\ncourses: the secretary of state may conduct the negotiations with a\r\nforeign minister at Washington, or he may direct the American minister\r\nin the foreign country with which it is desired to treat to negotiate\r\nwith the minister of foreign affairs of that government.[87]\r\n\r\n    [87] The following description of the procedure observed in drawing up,\r\n    signing, and ratifying treaties is given by Mr. Van Dyne in his book\r\n    entitled \"Our Foreign Service,\" pp. 9-10:\r\n\r\n\"When the terms of a treaty are agreed upon, two exact copies are\r\nengrossed at the Department of State, and signed by the Secretary and\r\nthe foreign minister. Where the two countries have not a common language\r\nthe texts in the two languages are engrossed in parallel columns. In\r\ndrawing up treaties this government adheres to the 'alternat,' by which\r\nin the copy of the treaty to be retained by this government, the United\r\nStates is named first, and our plenipotentiary signs first. In the copy\r\nto be retained by the foreign government that government is named first\r\nand its plenipotentiary signs first. The seal of each plenipotentiary is\r\nplaced after his signature. Two narrow pieces of red, white and blue\r\nstriped silk ribbon are laid across the page, some hot wax is dropped on\r\nthe document at the place where the impression of the seal is to be\r\nmade, and the seals are placed on this, the ribbon thus fastened to the\r\nseals being used to bind the pages of the instrument. When the treaty is\r\nratified, a day is fixed and the plenipotentiaries meet and exchange\r\nratifications. The ratification is attached to the instrument. When the\r\nratification is completed, proclamation of the fact and publication of\r\nthe text are made simultaneously at the capitals of each nation, upon a\r\nday agreed upon.\"\r\n\r\n=The Consular Service.=--_The Consular Bureau_ in the department of\r\nstate has charge of the correspondence with our consular officers in\r\nforeign countries. A consul differs from a diplomatic representative in\r\nbeing a commercial rather than a political representative. Consuls are\r\nstationed at all important commercial centers in foreign countries, to\r\nlook after the commercial interests of their country, promote foreign\r\ntrade, watch over shipping and navigation, administer the estates of\r\nAmerican citizens dying abroad, assist in the administration of our\r\ncustoms, health, navigation, immigration, and naturalization laws, and\r\nto collect such information concerning the trade, industries, and\r\nmarkets of foreign countries as may be of value to the commercial\r\ninterests of the United States.[88]\r\n\r\n    [88] In certain Oriental countries, notably China, Morocco, Persia,\r\n    Siam, and Turkey, the United States consuls, by virtue of treaty\r\n    arrangements, exercise jurisdiction over American citizens in both\r\n    civil and criminal cases. They are empowered to try Americans for\r\n    offenses committed within their districts and to determine all civil\r\n    controversies between citizens of the United States residing therein.\r\n    In more serious criminal cases and in civil cases involving large\r\n    amounts, appeals may be taken to the American minister. The reason why\r\n    Western powers refuse to permit their citizens to be tried by the\r\n    courts of these countries is that their standards of law and procedure\r\n    are repugnant to those of Western countries. Formerly consular\r\n    jurisdiction existed in Japan also, but it was abolished by treaty in\r\n    1899.\r\n\r\n=Recent Reforms.=--In obedience to the widespread demands of the\r\ncommercial interests of the country, notable improvements have recently\r\nbeen made in our consular service. Formerly political considerations\r\nlargely determined appointments to the service, and at the beginning of\r\neach new administration a wholesale removal was made in order to find\r\nplaces for party workers. By acts of Congress passed in 1906 and 1909,\r\nhowever, the service was reorganized and attempts made to place it on a\r\nmerit basis. The fee system was abolished, consuls were prohibited from\r\npracticing law or engaging in other businesses, provision was made for\r\nperiodic inspection of consulates, and a system of examinations was\r\ninaugurated for determining the qualifications of appointees to the\r\nservice. The adoption of these reforms has brought about a marked\r\nincrease in the efficiency of the service and has tended to give to it\r\nthe character of a permanent professional career such as it enjoys in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n=Other Bureaus of the State Department.=--_The Bureau of Indexes and\r\nArchives_ is charged with keeping the records and indexing the\r\ncorrespondence of the department of state. It also prepares the annual\r\nvolumes of the foreign relations, containing portions of the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n_The Division of Passport Control_ is charged with the issue of\r\npassports to persons who desire to travel abroad. A passport is a paper\r\nsigned by the secretary of state certifying that the bearer is a citizen\r\nof the United States or has declared his intention of becoming a\r\ncitizen, and is entitled to the protection of the government when\r\ntraveling abroad. They are granted not only to citizens but, by a recent\r\nlaw, to loyal residents of the insular possessions and to aliens who\r\nhave declared their intention of becoming citizens and have resided in\r\nthe United States for three years. A fee of one dollar is charged for\r\neach passport.\r\n\r\n_The other bureaus and divisions_ in the department of state are:\r\naccounts, rolls and library, appointments, information, Far Eastern\r\naffairs, Near Eastern affairs, Western European affairs, and\r\nLatin-American affairs.\r\n\r\n=The Department of the Treasury.=--For the most part the department of\r\nthe treasury is concerned with the management of the national finances,\r\nincluding (1) the administration of the revenue laws, (2) the custody of\r\nthe national funds, (3) the preparation of the budget, (4) the\r\nadministration of the currency and national banking laws, (5)\r\nmiscellaneous functions such as those relating to the life-saving\r\nservice, the public health and marine hospital service, engraving and\r\nprinting, construction of public buildings, etc.\r\n\r\nThe custody of the government funds devolves upon the _Treasurer_, who\r\nis charged with receiving and disbursing upon proper warrant all public\r\nmoneys that may be deposited in the treasury at Washington or in the\r\nsubtreasuries at New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago,\r\nSt. Louis, New Orleans, and San Francisco, as well as in national banks\r\nand federal reserve banks. He is also the custodian of miscellaneous\r\ntrust funds, is the agent of the government for paying interest on the\r\npublic debt and for issuing and redeeming government paper currency and\r\nnational bank notes, and is the custodian of the bonds deposited to\r\nsecure national bank circulation.\r\n\r\n_The Register of the Treasury_ issues and signs all bonds of the United\r\nStates, registers bond transfers and redemption of bonds, and signs\r\ntransfers of public funds from the treasury to the subtreasuries or\r\ndepositories.\r\n\r\n_The Commissioner of Internal Revenue_ supervises the collection of the\r\nfederal income tax and of the taxes on the manufacture of tobacco, etc.,\r\nand supervises the enforcement of the prohibition law.\r\n\r\n_The Director of the Budget_, provided for by the new budget act of\r\n1921, prepares for the President the annual budget and all other\r\nestimates of revenues and expenditures, and with that end in view, has\r\npower to assemble, correlate, revise, reduce, or increase the estimates\r\nof the several departments or establishments. The President is, however,\r\ndirectly responsible for the budget, and transmits it to Congress. By\r\nthe same act, the office of _Comptroller of the Treasury_ was abolished,\r\nand the auditing and accounting functions were removed from the Treasury\r\nDepartment to an independent General Accounting Office, with the\r\n_Comptroller-General of the United States_ at its head.\r\n\r\nThe principal officers who have to do with currency administration are\r\nthe director of the mint and the comptroller of the currency. _The\r\nDirector of the Mint_ has general supervision of the administration of\r\nthe coinage laws and the management of the coinage and assay offices.[89]\r\n_The Comptroller of the Currency_ exercises supervision over the\r\nnational banks. It is his duty to see that national banks are properly\r\norganized, that the capital stock is fully subscribed and paid in, that\r\nthe necessary amount of United States bonds have been duly deposited\r\nwith the government to secure the circulation of their notes, and that\r\nall national banks are properly examined from time to time. He also has\r\nimportant duties in connection with the management of the federal\r\nreserve banks. He has charge of the issue of national bank notes and\r\n(under the supervision the Federal Reserve Board) of Federal reserve\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n    [89] For a list of the mints and assay offices, see pp. 228-229.\r\n\r\nAmong the bureaus of the treasury department which have no direct\r\nrelation to the public finances the most important is the _Public Health\r\nService_, which is under the direction of a surgeon general who is\r\ncharged with the supervision of the national quarantine stations and of\r\nhospitals for the relief of sick and disabled seamen, and discharged\r\nsoldiers, sailors, and marines. He calls conferences of all state health\r\nboards. He is authorized to adopt regulations to prevent the\r\nintroduction and spread of contagious diseases, and it is his duty to\r\nsupervise the medical examination of immigrants seeking admission to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n_The Coast Guard_, as organized in 1915, is charged with the duties of\r\nthe former _life-saving service_ and the _revenue cutter service_. It\r\nrenders assistance to persons and vessels in distress, patrols the coast\r\nfor the purpose of preventing violations of the customs laws, and\r\nenforces the laws relating to quarantine, navigation, protection of the\r\ngame, fishery, and seal industries, etc. It constitutes a part of the\r\nmilitary forces and is under the treasury department in time of peace\r\nand under the navy department in time of war.\r\n\r\n_The Supervising Architect_ is charged with the selection and purchase\r\nof sites for government buildings, such as federal courthouses,\r\npost-office buildings, customhouses, mints, etc.; with the preparation\r\nof plans and specifications and the awarding of contracts for such\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Engraving and Printing_ is charged with the duty of\r\nengraving and printing all government securities, including United\r\nStates notes, bonds, certificates, national bank notes, federal reserve\r\nnotes, internal revenue, customs, and postage stamps, treasury drafts,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_The Secret Service Division_ is a body of detective agents employed to\r\ndetect frauds and crimes against the government, such as counterfeiting\r\nor espionage. Some of the force are also employed in guarding the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of War Risk Insurance_ (created in 1914) is charged with\r\ncarrying out the laws relating to government insurance of American\r\nships, soldiers, and sailors.\r\n\r\n_The Federal Reserve Board_ and the _Federal Farm Loan Board_ (see p.\r\n234) are also under the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\n=The War Department.=--The secretary of war has charge of all matters\r\nrelating to national defense and seacoast fortifications, river and\r\nharbor improvements, the prevention of obstructions to navigation, and\r\nthe establishment of harbor lines; and all plans and locations, of\r\nbridges authorized by Congress to be constructed over navigable rivers\r\nrequire his approval.\r\n\r\nThe army is under the direction of the _General Staff_ described on p.\r\n263. Within the war department there are also a number of departments\r\nand bureaus, each under the direction of an army officer.\r\n\r\n_The Adjutant General_ has charge of the records and correspondence of\r\nthe army and militia; of the recruiting service, including enlistments,\r\nappointments, promotions, resignations, etc. He communicates to\r\nsubordinate officers the orders of the President and the secretary of\r\nwar, and preserves reports of military movements and operations.\r\n\r\n_The Inspector General_, with his assistants, visits and inspects\r\nmilitary posts, depots, fortifications, armories and arsenals, and\r\npublic works in charge of army officers, and makes reports on the\r\nconduct, efficiency, and discipline of officers and men, including their\r\narms and equipment.\r\n\r\n_The Quartermaster General_ has supervision over the quartermaster corps\r\nwhich is the main supply service of the army (except for technical\r\narticles), and furnishes food, clothing, equipment, animals, and forage.\r\nIt also has charge of building construction and transportation for the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n_The Chief of Finance_ has control over the finances of the army.\r\n\r\n_The Surgeon General_ has supervision over the medical service of the\r\narmy; looks after the sick and wounded; provides medical and hospital\r\nsupplies, and inquires into the sanitary conditions of the army. In\r\naddition to field hospitals permanent depots and hospitals are\r\nmaintained at various points.\r\n\r\n_The Judge-Advocate General_ is the chief law officer of the army; he\r\nreviews records of the proceedings of courts-martial, courts of inquiry,\r\nand military commissions, and acts as legal adviser to the war\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n_The Chief Signal Officer_ is charged with the supervision of military\r\nsignal duties, the construction, repair, and operation of military\r\ntelegraph lines and cables.\r\n\r\n_The Chief of the Air Service_ has supervision over aircraft production\r\nand the aviation service.\r\n\r\n_The Chief of Ordnance_ supervises the purchase, manufacture, and\r\ndistribution of artillery, small arms, and ammunition for the army and\r\nthe militia. For the manufacture of arms and ammunition there are\r\narsenals at Springfield, Mass., Rock Island, Ill., Watervliet, N. Y.,\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_The Chief of Engineers_ is at the head of the engineering corps, a\r\nbranch of the army which is charged with the construction of public\r\nworks such as military roads, bridges, fortifications, river and harbor\r\nimprovements, geographical explorations, and surveys. The construction\r\nof the Panama Canal is the most notable of the recent undertakings of\r\nthe war department in this field.\r\n\r\n_The Chief of the Chemical Warfare Service_ has supervision over the\r\nproduction of chemical warfare materials as well as defensive appliances\r\nfor protection against such warfare. He also supervises the training of\r\nthe army in the use of both.\r\n\r\n_The Militia Bureau_, created in 1916, has charge of all matters\r\nrelating to the National Guard.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the purely military functions and construction of public\r\nworks, the war department has certain duties in connection with the\r\ngovernment of the insular possessions and the Panama Canal Zone. So far\r\nas these duties relate to Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands they are\r\nunder the direction of the _Bureau of Insular Affairs_, at the head of\r\nwhich is an army officer with the title of chief of the bureau. This\r\nbureau also has charge of the collection of the revenues of Haiti and\r\nthe Dominican Republic in accordance with treaties which practically\r\nestablish an American receivership over those republics.\r\n\r\nFinally, the war department has charge of the _United States Military\r\nAcademy_ at West Point, the various post-graduate schools of instruction\r\nfor army officers located at different army posts, the national military\r\nparks at Chickamauga, Gettysburg, Shiloh, and Vicksburg, and the\r\nnational cemeteries in various parts of the country. The military\r\nacademy at West Point was founded in 1802. A certain number of cadets\r\n(the number--for a long time one only--has varied at different periods)\r\nare appointed from each congressional district and territory, upon the\r\nnomination of the representative in Congress from the district; also\r\ncertain numbers from each state at large, from the District of Columbia,\r\nand from the United States at large. All candidates are required to pass\r\na physical and intellectual examination; the course of instruction lasts\r\nfour years; and each cadet receives pay sufficient for his maintenance.\r\nGraduates receive appointments as second lieutenants in the army, those\r\nstanding highest usually being appointed to the engineering corps if\r\nthey prefer assignment to that branch of the service. The secretary of\r\nwar exercises general supervision over the academy, and it is inspected\r\nat regular intervals by a board of visitors of whom seven are appointed\r\nby the President, two by the Vice President, and three by the speaker of\r\nthe house of representatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEST POINT CADETS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCK IN THE PANAMA CANAL]\r\n\r\n=The Department of the Navy= was created in 1798. At its head is a\r\nsecretary, who, like the head of the war department, is usually taken\r\nfrom civil life. Like the war department, the navy department is\r\norganized into the _Office of Naval Operations_ and a number of bureaus.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Navigation_ has charge of the recruiting service, the\r\ntraining of officers and men, the naval academy; schools for the\r\ntechnical education of enlisted men, apprentice schools, the naval home\r\nat Philadelphia, transportation of enlisted men, records of squadrons,\r\nships, officers and men; the preparation of the naval register,\r\npreparation of drill regulations, signal codes, and cipher codes. Under\r\nthis bureau falls the publication of the Nautical Almanac, charts and\r\nsailing directions, the naval observatory, and the hydrographic office.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Yards and Docks_ has general control of the navy yards\r\nand docks belonging to the government, including their construction and\r\nrepair, and also of the construction of battleships whenever such\r\nconstruction is authorized by Congress. The navy yards are located at\r\nWashington, Brooklyn, Mare Island (California), Philadelphia (League\r\nIsland), Norfolk, Pensacola, Cavite (in the Philippines), and various\r\nother places.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Ordnance_ has charge of the supply of armament and\r\nammunition for the ships. It supervises the manufacture of guns and\r\ntorpedoes, installs armament on the vessels, and has charge of the naval\r\nproving ground and magazines, the naval gun factory, and the torpedo\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Construction and Repair_ has charge of the planning,\r\nbuilding, and repairing of vessels, and of their equipment, excepting\r\ntheir armament and engines.\r\n\r\n_Other Bureaus_ of the Navy Department, whose general duties are\r\nindicated sufficiently by their titles, are: the bureau of engineering,\r\nthe bureau of medicine and surgery, and the bureau of supplies and\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n_The Judge-Advocate General_ is the law officer of the navy department\r\nand performs duties similar to those of the judge-advocate general of\r\nthe war department.\r\n\r\n_The Major General Commandant of the Marine Corps_ issues orders for the\r\nmovement of troops under the direction of the secretary of the navy.\r\n\r\nThe department of the navy also has general charge of the _United States\r\nNaval Academy_ at Annapolis. The academy was founded in 1846, by George\r\nBancroft, then secretary of the navy. A specified number of midshipmen\r\nare allowed for each member of Congress and each territorial delegate,\r\nand certain numbers from the District of Columbia, from Porto Rico, and\r\nfrom the United States at large.[90] Appointments are made by the\r\nPresident after a physical and intellectual examination by a board, and\r\nan allowance is made for maintaining each midshipman while in residence\r\nat the academy. The course lasts four years and includes instruction in\r\ngunnery, naval construction, steam engineering, navigation, mathematics,\r\ninternational law, modern languages, etc. After the completion of the\r\ncourse, midshipmen spend two years at sea, after which they receive\r\nsubordinate appointments in the navy or marine corps.\r\n\r\n    [90] In addition, the secretary of the navy may appoint each year 100\r\n    midshipmen from the enlisted men of the navy less than twenty years\r\n    old, the selection being based on competitive examinations.\r\n\r\n=The Department of Justice.=--The office of attorney-general was created\r\nin 1789, and from the first the attorney-general was a member of the\r\ncabinet; but for a long time the duties of the office were not\r\nextensive, and it was not until 1870 that the office was made an\r\nexecutive department with its present title and organization.\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General_ is the chief law officer of the national\r\ngovernment and is the legal adviser of the President and the heads of\r\ndepartments. He represents the United States before the Supreme Court in\r\ncases in which it is a party, exercises a sort of administrative\r\nsupervision over the United States district attorneys and marshals and\r\nover the federal penitentiaries, examines applications for pardons, and\r\nadvises the President in the exercise of his pardoning power. The\r\nopinions which he renders on constitutional and legal questions referred\r\nto him are published by the government in a series of volumes, and\r\naltogether they constitute an important body of constitutional and\r\nadministrative law. Under the direction of the President he institutes\r\nproceedings and prosecutes cases against corporations and persons for\r\nviolations of the laws of the United States, or directs the district\r\nattorneys to do so.\r\n\r\n=The Post Office Department.=--At the head of the post office department\r\nis the postmaster-general. He establishes and discontinues post offices,\r\nappoints all postmasters whose compensation does not exceed $1,000 a\r\nyear, issues postal regulations, makes postal treaties with foreign\r\ngovernments, with the approval of the President, awards mail contracts,\r\nand has general supervision of the domestic and foreign postal service.\r\nThere is an assistant attorney-general for the post office department,\r\nwho advises the postmaster-general on questions of law, has charge of\r\nprosecutions arising under the postal laws, hears cases relating to the\r\nmisuse of the mails, and drafts postal contracts. There are also four\r\nassistant postmasters-general, each of whom has supervision over a group\r\nof services within the department. The postal service has already been\r\ndescribed in chapter xiv.\r\n\r\n=The Department of the Interior.=--The interior department, established\r\nin 1849, is one of the largest and most important of the ten executive\r\ndepartments. Next to the post office department, the services which it\r\nperforms reach more people than those performed by any other department.\r\nIts staff of employees at Washington ranks second in numbers only to\r\nthat of the treasury department. It has charge of the public lands,\r\nIndian affairs, pensions, patents, the geological survey, and, to some\r\nextent, the government of the territories.\r\n\r\n=The Public Lands.=--Perhaps the most important bureau in the interior\r\ndepartment is the _General Land Office_, which has charge of the public\r\nlands, and the care and control of the forest reserves. Before the\r\npublic lands are sold or otherwise disposed of they must be surveyed.\r\nFor this purpose there are seventeen surveying districts, in each of\r\nwhich there is a surveyor general.\r\n\r\n_Disposal of the Public Lands._--The public lands have been disposed of\r\nwith a somewhat lavish hand. In the early days liberal grants were made\r\nto the soldiers of the Revolutionary War. Immense quantities have also\r\nbeen sold at low rates--much of it at $1.25 per acre--in order to\r\nencourage settlers to establish homes thereon. Considerable quantities\r\nhave also been granted to the states for educational purposes and the\r\nconstruction of internal improvements. Beginning with Ohio in 1802, each\r\nnew state admitted to the Union was given one section in each township\r\nfor the support of elementary schools, and those admitted after 1850\r\nwere given two sections in each township. Under the Morrill act of 1862,\r\n10,000,000 acres were given to the states for the establishment of\r\ncolleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Some of the more recently\r\nadmitted states were given from one to four townships each for the\r\nestablishment of universities.[91]\r\n\r\n    [91] The six states admitted between 1889 and 1890 were given\r\n    23,000,000 acres.\r\n\r\nBefore the Civil War, large quantities were given to the states for the\r\nconstruction of canals and railroads. Large tracts of the public lands\r\nhave also been granted to private corporations as subsidies for the\r\nbuilding of transcontinental railways. Finally, by an act of 1902, the\r\nproceeds from the sale of all public lands in seventeen Western states\r\nare set aside for constructing irrigation works in those states.\r\n\r\nBy the _preëmption act_ of 1841, it was provided that 160 acres of land\r\nshould be given to any family living thereon for a period of six months\r\nand paying $200 therefor. This act was repealed in 1891, but millions of\r\nacres were disposed of during the fifty years it was in force.\r\n\r\nBy the _homestead act_ of 1863, still in force, any head of a family may\r\nacquire 160 acres by living on it for three years (it was five years\r\nbefore 1912), cultivating a certain part of it, and paying a small fee.\r\n\r\n_The Public Lands now Remaining_ aggregate about 665,000,000 acres,\r\nincluding those in Alaska. Of these lands a large part have been set\r\naside for Indian reservations, national parks, military reservations,\r\nand national forests,[92] and is therefore not open to purchase or entry\r\nunder the homestead act. Arid lands are sold in tracts not exceeding 640\r\nacres at $1.25 per acre; mineral lands are sold at from $2.50 to $5 per\r\nacre; timber and stone lands at a minimum of $2.50 per acre; town site\r\nlands at a minimum of $10 per acre; and agricultural lands at $1.25 per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n    [92] There are now 153 national forests, embracing 175,940,000 acres.\r\n\r\n_Land Offices_ are established in all the states where there is any\r\nconsiderable amount of public land left. At each office there is a\r\nregister and a receiver who examines applications for entries and issues\r\ncertificates upon which patents or deeds are finally granted.\r\n\r\n=Indian Affairs.=--Another important branch of the government service\r\nfalling within the department of the interior is the management of\r\nIndian affairs. For a long time each tribe was treated to some extent as\r\nthough it were an independent community, and was dealt with somewhat as\r\nforeign nations are dealt with. In 1871, however, it was enacted that\r\nhenceforth no Indian tribe should be acknowledged or treated as an\r\nindependent nation or power with which the United States may contract by\r\ntreaty--an act which marks the beginning of the end of Indian tribal\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe policy of extending the jurisdiction of the government over the\r\nIndians was begun by an act of 1885 which gave the United States courts\r\njurisdiction over seven leading crimes when committed by Indians on\r\ntheir reservations. Previous to that time, crimes committed by Indians\r\nagainst Indians within a reservation were left to be dealt with by the\r\ntribal authorities themselves.\r\n\r\n_The Allotment Act._--By the Dawes act of 1887 the new Indian policy\r\nbegun in 1871 was still further extended. This act provided for the\r\nallotment of Indian lands to individual members of the tribe, and\r\ndeclared that Indians who accepted such allotments or who should leave\r\ntheir tribe and adopt the habits of civilized life, should be considered\r\nas citizens of the United States and entitled to all the rights and\r\nprivileges of citizens. Previous to this time the lands occupied by the\r\nIndians were owned by the tribe as a whole and not by the individuals\r\nwho occupied them. Under this act, individual allotments aggregating\r\nmore than 30,000,000 acres have been made to 180,000 Indians. There\r\nremain about 120,000 Indians, to whom allotments are still to be made.\r\nThe result of this policy will ultimately be to extinguish the Indian\r\ntribes and incorporate them into the American body politic.\r\n\r\n_Indian Agents._--The control of the national government over the Indian\r\nreservations is exercised largely through Indian agents appointed by the\r\nPresident. They are charged with the regulation of trade with the\r\nIndians, and have control of the distribution of rations. At each agency\r\none or more schools are maintained, and in addition to the reservation\r\nschools there are schools for the higher education of Indians in various\r\nparts of the country, the most important being at Lawrence, Kansas, and\r\nCarlisle, Pennsylvania. The aggregate annual expenditures on account of\r\nthe service are now about $15,000,000, more than half of which consists\r\nof payments due the Indians under treaty stipulations or of interest on\r\ntrust funds held by the government for them. The total amount of these\r\ntrust funds is about $50,000,000.[93]\r\n\r\n    [93] The Secretary of the Interior says the Osage Indians are probably\r\n    the wealthiest people in the world, their average per capita wealth\r\n    being over $9,500. Some families have an income of $12,000 a year.\r\n\r\n=The Pension Bureau= has charge of the administration of the pension\r\nlaws. The payments on account of pensions now constitute the largest\r\nitem of expenditure by the national government. Before the outbreak of\r\nthe Civil War, pension expenditures rarely exceeded two million dollars\r\na year, and the total outlay for this purpose during the entire period\r\nof our national history aggregated less than half the amount now\r\nappropriated for a single year. According to the report of the\r\ncommissioner of pensions for 1919 there were 624,427 names on the\r\npension rolls, and the amount expended for pensions that year was over\r\n$220,000,000. More than $5,000,000,000 has been expended for pensions\r\nsince the Civil War, a larger amount than the national debt incurred on\r\naccount of the war itself.\r\n\r\n=The Patent Office= includes a large number of officers, examiners, and\r\nemployees, who are under the direction of the commissioner of patents.\r\nTheir work is described on p. 260.\r\n\r\n=Minor Divisions of the Interior Department.=--_The Bureau of Education_\r\nwas established in 1867. At its head is a commissioner whose duty it is\r\nto collect and publish statistics and other information concerning the\r\nmethods, conditions, and progress of education in the United States.\r\nEach year he publishes an elaborate report summarizing the educational\r\nprogress of the country, together with monographs by experts on special\r\ntopics of educational interest. The commissioner is also charged with\r\nthe administration of the funds appropriated for the support of the\r\ncolleges of agriculture and mechanic arts and with the supervision of\r\neducation in Alaska and the reindeer industry in that country.\r\n\r\n_The Geological Survey_ was established as a bureau in the department of\r\nthe interior in 1879. It is under the control of a director who is\r\ncharged with the classification of the public lands and the examination\r\nof the geological structure, mineral resources, and mineral products of\r\nthe public lands and the survey of the forest reserves. The bureau has\r\nundertaken the preparation of topographical and geological maps of the\r\nUnited States, a considerable portion of which has been completed, the\r\ncollection of statistics of the mineral products, the investigation of\r\nmine accidents, the testing of mineral fuels and structural materials,\r\nand the investigation of surface and underground waters.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Mines_, created in 1911, is charged with conducting\r\ninvestigations looking toward the prevention of mine accidents, the\r\nintroduction of improvements in the general health and safety\r\nconditions, the conservation of mineral resources, etc. The bureau\r\nreported in 1913 that it had brought about a reduction in the number of\r\nfatalities due to explosions, from 30 to 13 per cent.\r\n\r\n=The Department of Agriculture.=--A so-called \"department\" of\r\nagriculture was established in 1862, though its rank was only that of a\r\nbureau and its head bore the title of commissioner. From time to time,\r\nthe scope and functions of the \"department\" were extended until 1889,\r\nwhen it was raised to the rank of a cabinet department with a secretary\r\nat its head. Like the other departments, it is organized into bureaus,\r\noffices, and divisions.\r\n\r\n_The Weather Bureau_ has charge of the preparation of weather forecasts\r\nand the display of storm, cold wave, frost, and flood warnings for the\r\nbenefit of agriculture, commerce, and navigation.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Animal Industry_ conducts the inspection of animals,\r\nmeats, and meat food products under the act of Congress of June 30,\r\n1906, and has charge of the inspection of import and export animals, the\r\ninspection of vessels for the transportation of export animals, and the\r\nquarantine stations for imported live stock; supervises the interstate\r\ntransportation of animals, and reports on the condition and means of\r\nimproving the animal industries of the country.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Plant Industry_ studies plant life in its relations to\r\nagriculture. It investigates the diseases of plants and carries on field\r\ntests in the prevention of diseases. It studies the improvement of crops\r\nby breeding and selection, maintains demonstration farms, and carries on\r\ninvestigations with a view to introducing better methods of farm\r\npractice. It conducts agricultural explorations in foreign countries for\r\nthe purpose of securing new plants and seeds for introduction into the\r\nUnited States. It studies fruits, their adaptability to various\r\nclimates, and the methods of harvesting, handling, storing, and\r\nmarketing them.\r\n\r\n_The Forest Service_ is charged with the administration of the National\r\nForests. It also gives practical advice in the conservation and handling\r\nof national, state, and private forest lands, and in methods of\r\nutilizing forest products; investigates methods of forest planting, and\r\ngives practical advice to tree planters; studies commercially valuable\r\ntrees to determine their best management and use; gathers statistics on\r\nforest products, in coöperation with the bureau of the census, and\r\ninvestigates the control and prevention of forest fires, and other\r\nforest problems.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Chemistry_ conducts investigations into the chemical\r\ncomposition of fertilizers, agricultural products, and food stuffs. In\r\npursuance of the pure food law of 1906, it examines foods and drugs\r\nintended to be sent from one state to another, with a view to\r\ndetermining whether they are adulterated or misbranded. It also conducts\r\ninvestigations of food stuffs imported from abroad and denies entry to\r\nsuch as are found unwholesome, adulterated, or falsely labeled. It also\r\ninspects food products intended to be exported to foreign countries\r\nwhere standards of purity are required.\r\n\r\n_Other Bureaus_, whose duties are indicated by their titles, are: the\r\nbureau of soils, the bureau of crop estimates, the bureau of entomology,\r\nthe bureau of biological survey, the bureau of markets, and the bureau\r\nof public roads.\r\n\r\n=The Department of Commerce= embraces what remains of the department of\r\ncommerce and labor created in 1903, and divided in 1913 by the creation\r\nof the department of labor. It is charged with the promotion of the\r\ncommerce of the United States and its mining, manufacturing, shipping,\r\nfishing, and transportation interests.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of the Census_ is charged with the duty of taking the\r\ndecennial census of the United States, including the collection of such\r\nspecial statistics as Congress may authorize. The first census, that of\r\n1790, was taken under the direction of the United States marshals in\r\ntheir respective districts; the statistics collected related only to\r\npopulation, and the schedule embraced only six questions. In 1880 the\r\nuse of the marshals was done away with and a corps of census supervisors\r\nprovided. Until 1902 the machinery for taking the census was organized\r\nanew for each census, but in the latter year provision was made for a\r\npermanent census bureau. The schedule of inquiries has increased from\r\ndecade to decade until it now embraces a wide range of questions\r\nrelating not only to population, but also to vital statistics,\r\nagriculture, manufactures, defective and criminal classes, cotton\r\nproduction, statistics of cities, state and local finances,\r\ntransportation, mining, and various other matters, the results of which\r\nare published in a series of large volumes and in special bulletins. At\r\nthe head of the bureau is a director, who is aided by an assistant\r\ndirector, a number of statisticians and experts, and a corps of local\r\nsupervisors and enumerators. The census work was in the charge of the\r\ndepartment of state until 1850, when it was transferred to the\r\ndepartment of the interior.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Navigation_[94] is charged with the general\r\nsuperintendence of the merchant marine of the United States and of the\r\nenforcement of the navigation laws. It has charge of the registration of\r\nAmerican vessels engaged in the foreign trade, and of the enrollment and\r\nlicensing of vessels in the coasting trade. It supervises the execution\r\nof the tonnage laws and the collection of tonnage duties; prepares an\r\nannual list of vessels registered under the American flag; and\r\nsupervises the work of the United States shipping commissioners, who\r\nadminister the laws for the protection of seamen.\r\n\r\n    [94] This bureau in the department of commerce must not be confused\r\n    with the bureau of navigation in the navy department, already\r\n    described.\r\n\r\n_The Steamboat Inspection Service_ is charged with the administration of\r\nthe laws providing for the inspection of steam and sailing vessels\r\nregistered under the American flag; with the examination and licensing\r\nof officers of such vessels, and with the protection of life and\r\nproperty on water. At the head of the service is an inspector general,\r\nwho is aided by ten supervising inspectors, each of the latter having\r\nunder his supervision a number of local inspectors stationed at the\r\nimportant commercial ports. All vessels must be inspected once a year as\r\nto their safety, construction, and facilities for protection against\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Fisheries_ has control of fish hatcheries in many parts\r\nof the country, for the propagation of useful food fishes; studies fish\r\nculture and the causes of the decrease of food fishes; collects\r\nstatistics in regard to the fishery industry; and in general promotes\r\nthe fishery interests. It supervises the salmon fisheries of Alaska and\r\nthe fur seal industry on the Pribilof Islands of the Bering Sea.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Lighthouses_ is charged with the construction and\r\nmaintenance of lighthouses, light vessels, beacons, fog signals, buoys,\r\nand other aids to navigation. The seaboard is divided up into lighthouse\r\ndistricts, in each of which is a naval officer who serves as inspector\r\nand has immediate charge of the supply, maintenance, and administration\r\nof the lighthouses in his district. At each lighthouse there is a keeper\r\nand one or more assistant keepers. The establishment now consists of\r\nmore than 1,500 lighthouses and beacons, a fleet of light-ships, and\r\nmore than 6,000 buoys. Since 1910 the service has been under the\r\nsupervision of a commissioner.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Standards_, established in 1901, is charged with the\r\ncustody of the national standards, the testing of measuring apparatus,\r\nand the investigation of problems relating to standards of weighing and\r\nmeasuring.\r\n\r\n_The Coast and Geodetic Survey_ is charged with the survey of the coasts\r\nand of rivers to the head of tide water, and the publication of charts\r\nof the same; the investigation of questions relating to temperature,\r\ntides, currents, and the depths of navigable waters; the making of\r\nmagnetic observations; the determination of geographic positions, and\r\nthe like. The results are published in annual reports and special\r\npublications. It prepares tables, sailing directions, charts of the\r\ncoasts, harbor charts, notices to mariners, and other publications for\r\nthe use of mariners.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce_ is charged with fostering\r\nand developing the various manufacturing interests of the United States\r\nand extending the markets for manufactured articles abroad, by\r\ncollecting and publishing all available and useful information\r\nconcerning such markets and industries. It publishes statistics of\r\ncommerce, finance, etc., consular and trade reports, and an annual\r\nvolume known as the \"Commercial Relations of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n     _The Bureau of Corporations_, created in 1903, was intended mainly\r\n     to furnish an agency for the investigation of corporations\r\n     suspected of violating the anti-\"trust\" laws of the United States.\r\n     It was authorized to investigate the organization and methods of\r\n     any corporation or joint-stock company engaged in foreign or\r\n     interstate commerce (except common carriers subject to the\r\n     interstate commerce act) and to report to the President such\r\n     information as might be of value in enabling him to enforce the\r\n     anti-\"trust\" laws. It was abolished in 1914 and its duties were\r\n     devolved upon the newly created Federal Trade Commission, which has\r\n     already been described (see p. 245).\r\n\r\n=The Department of Labor= was created in 1913, and is charged with\r\nfostering, promoting, and developing the welfare of the wage earners of\r\nthe United States, especially the improvement of the conditions under\r\nwhich they work and the advancement of their opportunities for\r\nprofitable employment.\r\n\r\n_The Bureaus of Immigration and Naturalization_, formerly consolidated\r\nin the department of commerce and labor, were divided in 1913 and\r\ntransferred to the new department of labor. They are charged\r\nrespectively with the administration of the immigration laws and the\r\nadministration of the naturalization laws of the United States.[95]\r\n\r\n    [95] See also pp. 238-239. The increase in the number of immigrants by\r\n    decades is shown by the following table:\r\n\r\n    -------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------\r\n    DECADE | POPULATION AT BEGINNING | TOTAL NUMBER OF | OF DECADE |\r\n    IMMIGRANTS | |\r\n    -------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------\r\n    1821-1830................| 9,633,822 | 143,439\r\n    1831-1840................| 12,866,020 | 599,125\r\n    1841-1850................| 17,069,453 | 1,713,251\r\n    1851-1860................| 23,191,876 | 2,598,224\r\n    1861-1870................| 31,443,321 | 2,314,824\r\n    1871-1880................| 38,558,371 | 2,812,191\r\n    1881-1890................| 50,155,783 | 5,246,613\r\n    1891-1900................| 62,622,250 | 3,687,564\r\n    1901-1910................| 75,994,575 | 8,793,386\r\n    -------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n    In 1916 naturalization certificates were issued to 93,911 persons and\r\n    declarations of intention to become citizens were made by 207,935.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Labor Statistics_, formerly known as the bureau of labor,\r\nwas transferred from the former department of commerce and labor in\r\n1913. It is charged with collecting and diffusing among the people of\r\nthe United States useful information on subjects connected with labor\r\nin the most general and comprehensive sense of that word, and especially\r\nupon its relations to capital, the hours of labor, the earnings of\r\nlaboring men and women, and the means of promoting their material,\r\nsocial, intellectual, and moral prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is especially charged with investigating the causes of and facts\r\nrelating to all controversies and disputes between employers and\r\nemployees. It publishes from time to time the results of elaborate\r\ninvestigations on various subjects relating to labor and industry, and\r\nalso issues a bimonthly bulletin on special topics within the same\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n_The Children's Bureau_, established in 1912, is charged with the\r\ninvestigation of problems relating to the welfare of children, such as\r\nthe conditions of the employment of children, the causes of infant\r\nmortality, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the _Women's Bureau_ was established to promote the welfare of\r\nwage-earning women.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, pp. 327-352.\r\n     BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. xi.

What is the origin of the term \"cabinet\"? On what days are cabinet\r\nmeetings now held?\r\n\r\n2. What are the principal differences between the American cabinet and\r\nthe British cabinet?\r\n\r\n3. Do you think the members of the cabinet should be members of\r\nCongress?

Hamilton declared this to be the crowning defect of the old\r\ngovernment, for laws, he very properly added, are a dead letter without\r\ncourts to expound their true meaning and define their operations. During\r\nthe period of the Confederation, the national government was dependent\r\nfor the most part, as has been said, on the states for the enforcement\r\nof its will. Thus if some one counterfeited the national currency,\r\nrobbed the mails, or assaulted a foreign ambassador, there was no\r\nnational court to take jurisdiction of the case and punish the offender.\r\nThe only way by which he could be brought to justice and the authority\r\nof the national government upheld was through the kindly assistance of\r\nsome state court, and this assistance was not always cheerfully lent nor\r\nwas it always effective when tendered. Congress to be sure acted as a\r\ncourt for the settlement of disputes between the states themselves, but\r\na legislative assembly is never well fitted for exercising judicial\r\nfunctions. In the absence of a national judiciary it proved impossible\r\nto enforce solemn treaty stipulations to which the United States was a\r\nparty, a fact which led Great Britain to refuse to carry out certain of\r\nher treaty engagements with the United States.\r\n\r\n=The Judicial Power of the United States.=--The framers of the\r\nConstitution decided that the jurisdiction of the national courts should\r\nbe restricted to questions of national interest and to those involving\r\nthe peace and tranquillity of the Union, such as disputes between the\r\nstates themselves and between citizens of different states, and that the\r\njurisdiction of all other controversies should be left to the\r\ndetermination of the courts of the several states. The jurisdiction of\r\nthe federal courts, therefore, was made to include all cases whether of\r\nlaw or equity arising under the national Constitution, the laws of the\r\nUnited States, and all treaties made under their authority; all cases\r\naffecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; all cases of\r\nadmiralty and maritime jurisdiction; all controversies to which the\r\nUnited States is a party; all controversies between two or more states;\r\nand between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states or\r\ncitizens or subjects thereof.[96]\r\n\r\n    [96] In two classes of these cases, namely, those in which ambassadors,\r\n    other public ministers, and consuls are parties and those in which a\r\n    state is a party, the Supreme Court has _original_ jurisdiction, that\r\n    is, the right to hear and determine the case in the first instance. But\r\n    that does not mean that the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction in\r\n    such cases. Other federal courts may try such cases, and as a matter of\r\n    fact few original suits have ever been brought in the Supreme Court. In\r\n    the other classes of cases mentioned, the Supreme Court has _appellate_\r\n    jurisdiction (with such exceptions as Congress may make), that is, such\r\n    cases must be commenced in the lower courts, from which they may be\r\n    taken on appeal to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom and propriety of giving the federal courts jurisdiction over\r\nall such cases are obvious, since they involve either national,\r\ninterstate, or international questions. Manifestly, the state courts\r\ncould not properly be left to determine finally controversies involving\r\nthe meaning or the application of provisions of the federal\r\nConstitution, laws, or treaties, since in that case they would not be\r\nwhat they are declared to be, namely, the supreme law of the land.\r\nConflicting decisions would be rendered by the courts of different\r\nstates, and in case of inconsistency between state constitutions and\r\nlaws on the one hand and the federal Constitution, laws, and treaties on\r\nthe other, the state courts would be under the temptation to uphold the\r\nvalidity of the former.\r\n\r\n_The Eleventh Amendment._--As originally adopted, the Constitution\r\npermitted suits to be brought in the federal courts against a state by\r\ncitizens of another state or by citizens of foreign countries, and when\r\na suit brought against the state of Georgia in 1793 by a citizen of\r\nSouth Carolina named Chisholm for the recovery of a debt was actually\r\nentertained by the Supreme Court, widespread popular indignation\r\nfollowed the decision. The authorities of Georgia felt that it was\r\nderogatory to the dignity of a sovereign state that it should be made\r\nthe defendant in a suit brought by a private individual, and a demand\r\nwas made that the Constitution be amended so as to prevent such \"suits\"\r\nin the future. As a result of this demand, the Eleventh Amendment was\r\nadopted in 1798 which declared that the judicial power of the United\r\nStates should not be construed to extend to suits brought against a\r\nstate by citizens of another state or of a foreign country. Nevertheless\r\nwhile a state cannot be made a defendant in a federal court at the\r\ninstance of a private individual of another state, the federal courts\r\nmay entertain jurisdiction of suits between a state and a citizen of\r\nanother state provided the state is the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n_How Cases \"Arise.\"_--A case \"arises\" under the Constitution, laws, or\r\ntreaties whenever a suit is filed involving a right or privilege\r\nthereunder. Until a case \"arises,\" that is, until it comes before the\r\ncourts in due form, they will take no notice of it. When President\r\nWashington in 1793 sought the opinion of the Supreme Court on certain\r\npoints involving our obligations to France under the treaty of alliance\r\nof 1778 it declined to answer his question, holding that it could give\r\nopinions only in cases properly brought before it.\r\n\r\n=The Regular Federal Courts.=--The Constitution declares that the\r\njudicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court\r\nand in such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and\r\nestablish. The Supreme Court, therefore, is the only federal tribunal\r\nwhich owes its existence to the Constitution, the others being created\r\nby statute. Even as to the Supreme Court Congress has considerable power\r\nof control, since it determines the number of judges of which it shall\r\nbe composed, and the amount of their compensation. But it cannot remove\r\nany judge except upon impeachment, or reduce his compensation after he\r\nhas once been appointed.\r\n\r\n_The Supreme Court_ is at present composed of one Chief Justice and\r\neight associate justices. It holds its sessions in the city of\r\nWashington from October to May of each year. Practically all the cases\r\nwhich it hears are those appealed from the lower courts. When a case has\r\nbeen argued, the court holds a consultation at which the points involved\r\nare considered and a decision is reached. The Chief Justice then\r\nrequests one of his associates to prepare the opinion of the court, or\r\nhe may prepare it himself, after which it is scrutinized by the court at\r\na second conference and approved. Any member of the court who disagrees\r\nwith the majority may file a dissenting opinion, a right frequently\r\ntaken advantage of. The concurrence of at least five of the nine judges\r\nis necessary to the validity of a decision, and as a matter of fact,\r\nmany important decisions have been rendered in recent years by a bare\r\nmajority of the court. The opinions rendered are published as the\r\n_United States Reports_, of which there are now more than 200 volumes.\r\nThey constitute the great authoritative source of the constitutional law\r\nof the United States, are studied by lawyers and judges, and are relied\r\nupon by the courts as precedents for the decisions of future cases\r\ninvolving similar points of law.[97] There is a reporter who arranges and\r\npublishes the opinions, a clerk who keeps the records, and a marshal who\r\nattends the court, preserves decorum, and enforces its orders.\r\n\r\n    [97] The justices of the Supreme Court wear black silk gowns when\r\n    holding court. The Chief Justice sits in the middle of a row of chairs,\r\n    his associates being arranged on his right and left in the order of\r\n    seniority of service.\r\n\r\n_The Circuit Courts of Appeals._--Next below the Supreme Court are the\r\ncircuit courts of appeals, nine in all--one for each of the judicial\r\ncircuits into which the country is divided.[98] These courts were created\r\nby act of Congress in 1891 to relieve the Supreme Court from an\r\naccumulation of business that rendered the prompt decisions of cases\r\nimpossible, the docket of the court having become so overcrowded that it\r\nwas about three years behind with its business. The act creating the\r\ncircuit courts of appeals, however, did not provide an additional class\r\nof judges to hold these courts, but enacted that each of them should be\r\nheld by three judges assigned for the purpose from among the judges of\r\nthe circuit. The judges of each circuit include one justice of the\r\nSupreme Court assigned to the circuit, two or more circuit judges\r\nappointed for the circuit, and a considerable number of district judges,\r\neach appointed for a district in the circuit. Most circuit courts of\r\nappeals are held by three circuit judges; but occasionally by two\r\ncircuit judges together with a district judge or the Supreme Court\r\njustice. The circuit courts of appeals have only appellate jurisdiction,\r\nthat is, they hear and determine only cases appealed from the lower\r\ncourts, and their decisions are final in most cases. This relieves the\r\nSupreme Court of all but the most important cases, and enables it to\r\ngive more attention to the cases before it and to dispatch its business\r\nmore promptly.\r\n\r\n    [98] The first circuit embraces Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\r\n    and Rhode Island; the second, Connecticut, New York, and Vermont; the\r\n    third, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; the fourth, Maryland,\r\n    North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia; the fifth,\r\n    Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; the sixth\r\n    Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee; the seventh, Illinois,\r\n    Indiana, and Wisconsin; the eighth, Arkansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Iowa,\r\n    Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South\r\n    Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming; the ninth, Alaska, Arizona, California,\r\n    Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii.\r\n\r\n_Former Circuit Courts._--Prior to 1911 next below the circuit courts of\r\nappeals were the circuit courts, which were held in the different\r\ndistricts within the circuit, either by a circuit judge or by the\r\njustice of the Supreme Court assigned to the circuit, or by a district\r\njudge, or by the three, or any two of them, sitting together. In 1911\r\nthe circuit courts were abolished and their jurisdiction conferred on\r\nthe district courts. The circuit judges, however, were retained and will\r\nhenceforth sit in the circuit courts of appeal.\r\n\r\n_The District Courts._--The lowest grade of federal court is the district\r\ncourt, held in each of the districts (about eighty) into which the\r\ncountry is divided. In some cases a state constitutes one district; in\r\nother cases a state is divided into two, three, four, or five\r\ndistricts. Usually there is one judge for each district, though in a few\r\ncases there are several judges for a single district, each holding court\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the district court embraces civil and criminal cases\r\nunder the laws of the United States--such as suits for the infringement\r\nof patents and copyrights, admiralty cases, bankruptcy proceedings,\r\nrevenue cases; and offenses against the United States revenue laws, laws\r\nagainst counterfeiting, the public land laws, the pure food laws, the\r\npostal laws, and the interstate commerce laws. Controversies between\r\ncitizens of different states may also be brought to this court.[99]\r\n\r\n    [99] Such suits may also be brought in the state courts but may at the\r\n    option of the defendant be transferred to a federal court for trial.\r\n    Many lawyers prefer to bring their suits in the state courts even when\r\n    they have the privilege of suing in the federal courts, because of\r\n    their greater familiarity with the procedure of these courts.\r\n\r\nIn most cases appeals may be taken from the decisions of the district\r\ncourts to the circuit courts of appeals or to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n=Federal Attorneys, Marshals, and Clerks.=--In each of the federal\r\njudicial districts, there is a United States attorney who prosecutes\r\nviolations of the federal laws in his district. There is also in each\r\ndistrict a United States marshal who bears somewhat the same relation to\r\nthe federal court that a sheriff does to a state court. He executes the\r\nprocesses of the court, arrests offenders, and performs other\r\nministerial functions for the court. In each district there is a clerk\r\nwho has custody of the seal of the court and keeps a record of its\r\nproceedings, orders, judgments, etc. The marshal and attorney are\r\nappointed by the President, but the clerk is chosen by the court\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn each district, also, the court appoints a number of United States\r\ncommissioners who are empowered to issue warrants for arrest, take bail,\r\ndetermine whether accused persons shall be held for trial, and perform\r\nother duties somewhat similar to those discharged by justices of the\r\npeace under the judicial system of the state.\r\n\r\n=The Regular Federal Judges.=--_Appointment._--All federal judges are\r\nappointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate. The judges of most of the states, as we have seen, are now\r\nchosen by popular election, but that method did not commend itself to\r\nthe framers of the federal Constitution. The existing method of\r\nappointing federal judges has given general satisfaction, and with\r\nremarkably few exceptions, the persons appointed to the federal bench\r\nhave been men of integrity and fitness.[100]\r\n\r\n    [100] For a description of the comparative merits of the various\r\n    methods of selecting judges, see pp. 113-114.\r\n\r\nThe _term_ for which all the regular federal judges are appointed is\r\ngood behavior. This is virtually for life, since they cannot be removed\r\nexcept by impeachment.[101] All other officers of the United States are\r\nappointed for definite terms, usually for four years. Except in a few\r\nstates, the state judges are elected for definite terms ranging from two\r\nyears to twenty-one years (p. 113). The framers of the federal\r\nConstitution, however, were deeply impressed with the advantages of a\r\njudiciary possessing the qualities of permanency and independence, and\r\nthey wisely provided that the judges should hold their offices so long\r\nas their official conduct was above reproach.\r\n\r\n    [101] For a list of federal judges who have been impeached see p. 194.\r\n\r\n_Compensation._--The Constitution declares that the judges shall receive\r\nat stated times a compensation for their services which shall not be\r\ndiminished during their continuance in office. As we have seen, the\r\ncompensation of the President can neither be increased nor diminished\r\nduring the time for which he is elected, but the prohibition in the case\r\nof the judges applies only to a reduction of their salaries. Increases\r\nare permitted to be made at any time. The compensation now allowed the\r\nchief justice of the Supreme Court is $15,000 a year, and the associate\r\njustices $14,500, amounts which are low in comparison with the salaries\r\nof the highest English judges, who receive $25,000 a year. The circuit\r\njudges receive $8,500 a year, and the district judges $7,500.\r\n\r\nAny judge of a United States court having held his commission ten years\r\nand having attained the age of seventy years, may retire from the bench\r\nand receive the same salary during the rest of his life that was payable\r\nto him at the time of his resignation. Few judges do retire, however.\r\n\r\n=Power of the Supreme Court to Declare Laws Unconstitutional.=--An\r\nimportant power of the Supreme Court for which there is no direct\r\nauthority in the Constitution, is that of declaring acts of Congress\r\nwhich are in conflict with the Constitution, null and void and of no\r\neffect. This power was first exercised by the Supreme Court in 1801 in\r\nthe famous case of Marbury v. Madison. Congress had passed an act giving\r\nthe Supreme Court original jurisdiction in certain cases where the\r\nConstitution says it should have appellate jurisdiction, and when the\r\nact came before the court for enforcement it declined to be bound by it.\r\nThe great chief justice, John Marshall, wrote the opinion of the court\r\nwhich held the act of Congress null and void. His argument, in brief,\r\nwas that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and the judges\r\nare bound to give effect to it. When, therefore, the court is called\r\nupon to give effect to a law of Congress which is clearly in conflict\r\nwith the higher law of the Constitution, it must give the preference to\r\nthe latter, otherwise the declaration in favor of the supremacy of the\r\nConstitution would have no meaning. Down to 1913 the Supreme Court had\r\ndeclared thirty-three acts of Congress, or parts of such acts,\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\n_Power to Declare State Laws Unconstitutional._--Laws passed by the\r\nstate legislatures, ordinances of municipal councils, and even the\r\nprovisions of state constitutions themselves may be declared null and\r\nvoid by the Supreme Court in case they are in conflict with the national\r\nConstitution or the laws and treaties made in pursuance thereof. It has\r\nalready been pointed out that appeals may be taken to the federal\r\nSupreme Court from the highest courts of a state whenever a right,\r\ntitle, or privilege under the federal Constitution is involved and the\r\nstate court has decided against the right or privilege claimed. Thus\r\nwhere one is prosecuted and convicted under a state law or provision of\r\na state Constitution which he claims is contrary to some provision in\r\nthe federal Constitution or laws, he has a right to appeal to the United\r\nStates Supreme Court and have the question of the constitutionality of\r\nthe state law finally determined there. This is a necessary consequence\r\nof the supremacy of the federal Constitution and laws over those of the\r\nstates. More than 200 acts of state legislatures have been pronounced\r\nnull and void by the United States Supreme Court.[102]\r\n\r\n    [102] Baldwin, \"The American Judiciary,\" p. 106.\r\n\r\nSometimes inferior federal courts declare acts of Congress and of the\r\nstate legislatures to be unconstitutional, but in all such cases an\r\nappeal may be taken to the Supreme Court for final review.\r\n\r\n=Special Courts of the United States.=--In addition to the three classes\r\nof United States courts, already described, several tribunals of a\r\nspecial or temporary character have been created to hear and determine\r\nparticular classes of controversies. Some of these courts are held by\r\njudges who are appointed for definite terms.\r\n\r\n_The Court of Claims_ was created in 1855 to pass upon claims against\r\nthe government. It consists of a chief justice and four associate\r\njustices who serve during good behavior. It is a well-established\r\nprinciple of public law that a sovereign state cannot be sued against\r\nits will. Before the creation of this court claims against the\r\ngovernment had to be considered by Congress, a body which aside from\r\nbeing ill fitted for the hearing of such cases, was overburdened by the\r\nnecessity of considering the large number of claims annually laid before\r\nit. The government now allows itself to be sued in this court on most\r\nclaims of a contractual nature, but the judgments of the court cannot be\r\npaid until Congress appropriates the money for their payment, and hence\r\nthe court cannot issue an execution to enforce its findings. At each\r\nsession of Congress, an appropriation is made to satisfy any judgments\r\nmade or which may be made by the court. Appeals are allowed to be taken\r\nfrom the court of claims to the Supreme Court on questions of law. Among\r\nthe more important classes of claims that have been adjudicated by this\r\ncourt were the French Spoliation claims, and Indian depredation claims,\r\nboth involving numerous claims and very large amounts in the aggregate.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 a United States court was established in China to exercise\r\njurisdiction in certain cases previously exercised by the consuls. It is\r\nheld by a single judge appointed by the President for a term of four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe tariff law of 1909 created a _United States Court of Customs\r\nAppeals_, consisting of a presiding judge and four associates, to hear\r\nappeals from the board of general appraisers in cases involving the\r\nconstruction of the law and facts respecting the classification of\r\nimported articles and the rate of duty imposed thereon.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 a _Commerce Court_ was created, to decide appeals from the\r\norders of the Interstate Commerce Commission; but in 1913 this court was\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nIn the _District of Columbia_ Congress has created two courts, with\r\njudges appointed to hold office during good behavior: the supreme court\r\nof the district, consisting of a chief justice and five associate\r\njustices; and the court of appeals, consisting of a chief justice and\r\ntwo associate justices. Appeals may be taken from the former to the\r\nlatter, whose decisions in some cases are reversible by the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States. Appeals may also be taken from the decisions\r\nof the commissioner of patents to the court of appeals of the District\r\nof Columbia.\r\n\r\nIn each of the _territories_ there are supreme and district courts\r\nestablished by Congress in pursuance of its power to provide for the\r\ngovernment of the territories, but they are not considered as a part of\r\nthe judicial system of the United States, although the judges are\r\nappointed by the President.[103]\r\n\r\n    [103] In most of the countries of continental Europe there is a special\r\n    class of tribunals called \"administrative courts\" to decide\r\n    controversies between private individuals and the public authorities.\r\n    There are no such courts in the United States, although the customs\r\n    court, the court of claims, and the interstate commerce commission bear\r\n    some resemblance to an administrative court. Many \"administrative\"\r\n    questions are decided by such officials as the secretary of the\r\n    treasury, the commissioner of immigration, and the commissioner of\r\n    patents.\r\n\r\n=Constitutional Protections in the Federal Courts.=--The Constitution\r\ncontains a number of provisions intended to protect accused persons\r\nagainst unauthorized prosecutions in the federal courts, as well as\r\nagainst arbitrary procedure in the course of the trial. As the\r\nConstitution originally stood, it contained few provisions of this kind;\r\nand this fact constituted one of the most serious objections urged\r\nagainst the ratification of that instrument. In consequence of this the\r\nfirst ten Amendments were adopted in 1790, and of these no less than\r\nfive relate to the rights of accused persons on trial in the federal\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nMost important of all, perhaps, the _Sixth Amendment_ declares that in\r\ncriminal prosecutions (in the federal courts) the accused shall enjoy\r\nthe right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the\r\nstate and district wherein the crime shall have been committed; that he\r\nshall be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; that he\r\nshall have the right to be confronted by the witnesses against him; that\r\nhe shall have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor;\r\nand that he shall have the assistance of counsel for his defense.[104]\r\n\r\n    [104] The purpose and meaning of these guarantees are discussed in\r\n    chapter vi, pp. 118-119.\r\n\r\nThe _Fifth Amendment_ protects the accused from prosecution in capital\r\ncases or cases involving infamous crime except upon indictment by a\r\ngrand jury. Some of the states, as we have seen, have abolished the\r\ngrand jury, and provided for prosecutions in their courts without the\r\nintervention of such an agency, but no person may be prosecuted in a\r\nfederal court for a serious crime until he has been held for trial by a\r\ngrand jury. The same amendment also forbids the trial of a person a\r\nsecond time for the same offense, if he was acquitted on the first\r\ntrial; declares that he shall not be compelled to testify against\r\nhimself; that he shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property\r\nwithout due process of law; and that private property shall not be taken\r\nfor public use without just compensation.\r\n\r\n_The Fourth Amendment_ declares among other things that no warrant for\r\narrest (by the federal authorities) shall be issued except upon probable\r\ncause, supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the\r\nperson to be seized. This provision is designed to prevent arbitrary\r\narrests of persons on mere suspicion. It prohibits general search\r\nwarrants such as were commonly used by the British authorities in the\r\ncolonies prior to the outbreak of the Revolution and which were\r\npopularly known as \"writs of assistance.\" Such warrants did not mention\r\nthe name of the person to be arrested but permitted the officer to\r\ninsert any name in the warrant and arrest whomsoever he might choose.\r\n\r\n_The Eighth Amendment_ declares that excessive bail shall not be\r\nrequired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment\r\ninflicted. The purpose of the first provision is discussed on p. 119.\r\nThe purpose of the other two prohibitions is to prevent the old\r\nseverities of the penal code that were common two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n_Treason._--Among the crimes in the prosecution of which judges were\r\nfrequently arbitrary and which were punished with undue severity, was\r\nthat of treason. Treason has always been regarded as the highest crime\r\nknown to society, because it seeks the overthrow or destruction of the\r\ngovernment itself. In earlier times, judges frequently construed\r\noffenses to be treasonable which were not declared so by the laws. This\r\nwas known as _constructive_ treason. To prevent them from construing the\r\nexistence of treason where it really did not exist, parliament therefore\r\npassed a statute during the reign of Edward III defining the offense\r\nwith more or less precision, and this definition in substance was\r\nincorporated in the Constitution of the United States, This provision\r\ndeclares that treason against the United States shall consist only in\r\nlevying war against them or in adhering to their enemies, giving them\r\naid and comfort. The Supreme Court in interpreting this provision has\r\nruled that in order to constitute treason there must be an actual\r\nlevying of war or an assembling of persons for the purpose of making\r\nwar; that a mere conspiracy to subvert the government by force is not\r\ntreason, but after the war has once begun, all those who perform any\r\npart, however minute or remote, or who give aid and comfort to the\r\nenemy, are traitors and as such are liable to the penalties of treason.\r\nTo protect persons accused of treason against conviction upon the\r\ntestimony of a single witness, the Constitution requires the testimony\r\nof two witnesses to the act, or confession in open court, to convict.\r\nCongress is authorized to prescribe the punishment of treason, but the\r\nConstitution declares that no attainder of treason shall work corruption\r\nof blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.\r\nUnder the old law, a person convicted of treason was not only put to\r\ndeath in a barbarous manner, but his blood, was considered as\r\n\"corrupted\" or \"attainted,\" so that as a matter of course, without any\r\ndecree of the court to that effect, his children could not inherit\r\nproperty or titles through him. Thus the innocent offspring of the\r\ntraitor were punished for the offense of the parent. The provision of\r\nour Constitution places the punishment on the offender alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--ANDREWS, Manual of the Constitution, pp. 201-223.\r\n     BALDWIN, The American Judiciary, ch. ix.

In dealing with the territories the powers of\r\nCongress are general or residuary in character, whereas when it\r\nlegislates for that part of the country which has been erected into\r\nstates, its powers are specifically enumerated. Congress, therefore, may\r\nestablish practically any form of government in the territories that it\r\nchooses. It may, if it wishes, set up therein a military government or\r\nit may establish civil government with such limitations and exceptions\r\nas it may wish. In the latter case it may allow the inhabitants a\r\nlegislative assembly for purposes of local legislation, or Congress may\r\nlegislate directly for them itself. And in case it permits the\r\ninhabitants to have a legislative assembly of their own and to enact\r\ntheir own laws, Congress may veto or modify any law passed by such\r\nlegislature. Indeed, says the Supreme Court, Congress may make valid an\r\ninvalid act passed by a territorial legislature as well as declare\r\ninvalid a valid act passed by it.\r\n\r\n_Does the Constitution Extend to the Territories?_--A subject much\r\ndiscussed, especially at the time of the acquisition of Porto Rico and\r\nthe Philippines, was whether such provisions of the Constitution as\r\nwere applicable extended of their own force to new territories\r\nimmediately upon the establishment of American sovereignty over them;\r\nthat is, whether the Constitution \"follows the flag\" or whether its\r\nprovisions apply only when extended by act of Congress. One party\r\nasserted that such provisions go wherever the sovereignty of the United\r\nStates goes, that the government cannot be carried to any new territory\r\nunless accompanied by the Constitution from which it derives its\r\nauthority, and that Congress has no power to withhold such provisions as\r\nare applicable. The other party maintained that the Constitution was\r\nestablished only for the people of the United States; that whenever new\r\nterritories have been acquired, Congress has extended such provisions as\r\nit saw fit; and that Congress is unlimited as to its power in dealing\r\nwith the inhabitants of such territories. The Supreme Court in the\r\nfamous Insular Cases, decided in 1900 and 1901, upheld the latter view\r\nand ruled that for all practical purposes the territories of the United\r\nStates are completely subject to the legislative authority of Congress,\r\nand that it is not even restricted by those provisions of the\r\nConstitution which were adopted for the protection of individual\r\nliberty. In practice Congress has always extended to the domestic\r\nterritories such provisions of the Constitution as were applicable, thus\r\nputting the inhabitants upon the same footing as those of the states so\r\nfar as the enjoyment of _civil_ rights are concerned, but not as to\r\n_political_ rights. So far as the insular territories are concerned, it\r\nhas also extended most of the provisions relating to civil rights,\r\nthough in the case of the Philippines a few safeguards such as the right\r\nof indictment by grand jury, trial by jury, and the right to bear arms\r\nhave been withheld.\r\n\r\n=The Origin of the Territorial System.=--Before the Constitution was\r\nadopted, Congress had acquired by cession from certain of the original\r\nstates a vast domain of territory north of the Ohio River, and later it\r\nacquired a considerable domain lying south of the Ohio (p. 159). One of\r\nthe conditions upon which the territory north of the Ohio was ceded, was\r\nthat Congress should form the territory into distinct republican states\r\nwhich should be admitted to the Union on an equal footing with the old\r\nstates. It was felt, however, that the territory in question should be\r\nput through a sort of preparatory stage before being erected into\r\nstates; that is, it should be held in a state of dependency until the\r\npopulation was sufficiently numerous to maintain a state government and\r\nthe inhabitants had acquired sufficient political capacity to manage\r\ntheir own public affairs.\r\n\r\n_The Northwest Territory._--By the famous Ordinance of 1787, as\r\nreënacted and slightly modified two years later (after the adoption of\r\nthe Federal Constitution), Congress provided a scheme of government for\r\nthe northwest territory which was in force for many years. The Ordinance\r\nprovided for two grades of government: one for the territory before its\r\npopulation should amount to 5,000 inhabitants; the other for the\r\nterritory thereafter. The principal difference was that in the former\r\ncase the territory was to have no local legislature of its own, while in\r\nthe latter it was to have a legislative assembly. The scheme of\r\ngovernment provided in the beginning consisted of a governor, a\r\nsecretary, and three judges, appointed by the President. Although no\r\nlegislature was provided, the governor, secretary, and judges were\r\nempowered, not to make new laws, but to select such laws from the\r\nstatutes of the old states as were suitable.\r\n\r\nWhen the population had reached 5,000 inhabitants, the territory was\r\ngiven the second grade form of government, that is, it was allowed a\r\nlocal legislature, the lower house of which was elected by the\r\ninhabitants on the basis of a restricted suffrage, the upper house or\r\ncouncil to be appointed by the President from a list nominated by the\r\nlower house. The territory was now allowed to send a delegate to\r\nCongress with a right to a seat in that body, but no right to vote.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of government thus provided for the northwest territory\r\nbecame the model for the later territorial governments. It was\r\nintroduced into the southwest territory and later to the territory\r\nacquired west of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\n=The Organized Territories: Hawaii and Alaska.=--The territories and\r\ndependencies of the United States may be grouped into two classes: the\r\norganized and the unorganized. A territory of the first class is said to\r\nbe \"organized\" because it has its own local legislature, both houses of\r\nwhich are elected. At present the only territories of this class fully\r\nincluded as parts of the United States are Hawaii[105] and Alaska,[106] but\r\nsince most of the states were organized territories before being\r\nadmitted to the Union, this kind of government is of more than ordinary\r\ninterest to the student of civics.\r\n\r\n    [105] The Hawaiian Islands were annexed to the United States in July,\r\n    1898, by a joint resolution of Congress after a treaty of annexation\r\n    had been rejected by the senate. The senate of Hawaii is composed of\r\n    fifteen members, the house of thirty; ability to speak, read, and write\r\n    the English or Hawaiian language is required of voters; the governor\r\n    may veto special items in appropriation bills; and in case the\r\n    legislature fails to pass appropriation bills to pay the necessary\r\n    expenses for carrying on the government and meeting its obligations,\r\n    the treasurer may, with the approval of the governor, make such\r\n    payments, for which purpose the sums appropriated in the last\r\n    appropriation bills shall be deemed to have been reappropriated;\r\n    the purpose being to prevent the legislature from causing deadlocks.\r\n\r\n    [106] For Porto Rico and the Philippines, see pages 374-379.\r\n\r\n_Executive._--In a fully organized territory there is a governor who is\r\nappointed by the President with the consent of the senate for a term of\r\nfour years, and who enjoys the usual powers of a state executive. The\r\nappointment is usually made from the residents of the territory, though\r\nin a few cases outsiders have been appointed. There is also a secretary\r\nwho keeps the records of the territory, compiles and publishes the acts\r\nof the legislature, and serves as governor during the absence or\r\ndisability of the latter official. Other administrative officers of the\r\nterritory are the attorney-general, treasurer, commissioner of public\r\nlands, superintendent of public education, surveyor, and auditor.\r\n\r\n_The Legislature_ is composed of two houses, both of which are popularly\r\nelected. Regular sessions of the legislature are held every two years\r\nand are limited to sixty days, though the governor may call\r\nextraordinary sessions with the approval of the President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe territorial legislature is empowered to enact laws in respect to all\r\nrightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with the laws and\r\nConstitution of the United States. Congress, however, has from time to\r\ntime imposed various limitations upon the power of the territorial\r\nlegislatures, and has shown a tendency to increase the restrictions,\r\nespecially in regard to financial matters. Congress may veto any act of\r\na territorial legislature.\r\n\r\n_Judiciary._--For the administration of justice, a fully organized\r\nterritory has a supreme court, a number of district courts, and such\r\ninferior courts as the legislature may create. The judges of the higher\r\ncourt are all appointed by the President of the United States for a term\r\nof four years. The territory also has a United States district court, a\r\ndistrict attorney, and a marshal.\r\n\r\nFinally, a fully organized territory is given a limited representation,\r\nin the Congress of the United States through a delegate, elected by the\r\npeople of the territory every two years, who is allowed a seat in the\r\nhouse of representatives with a right to serve on committees and take\r\npart in debate, but not to vote.\r\n\r\n_Alaska_, acquired by purchase from Russia in 1867, was for seventeen\r\nyears after its acquisition administered directly by the President\r\nwithout any express authority from Congress. In 1884, however, an act\r\nwas passed providing a system of civil government for the territory, to\r\nbe administered by a governor appointed by the President for a term of\r\nfour years. The general laws of the state of Oregon, so far as\r\napplicable, were extended to the territory. In 1898 a criminal code was\r\nprovided for the territory, and in 1900 a complete civil code and a code\r\nof civil procedure were enacted. Finally, in 1912 Alaska was made a\r\nfully organized territory, with a legislative assembly consisting of a\r\nsenate of eight members and a house of representatives of sixteen\r\nmembers. Acts can be passed over the governor's veto by vote of\r\ntwo-thirds of the members of each house of the legislative assembly.\r\n\r\n=The Organized Dependencies.=--Porto Rico and the Philippines, acquired\r\nfrom Spain in 1898, were formerly, and are now to a certain extent,\r\nregarded more as colonies than as territories, although they are\r\ngoverned much like a territory. For many years they were classed as\r\n\"partly organized\" because in their legislatures only one house was\r\nelective. They now have legislatures in which both houses are elective;\r\nbut unlike the territories they are inhabited by a foreign race, and had\r\nbeen at the time of their cession to the United States for centuries\r\ngoverned by an entirely different system of laws and administration from\r\nthat to which the people of the United States were accustomed.\r\n\r\n=Porto Rico.=--By an act of Congress in 1917, the supreme executive\r\npower of the island is vested in a governor appointed by the President,\r\nfor an indefinite term. He has the usual powers of a territorial\r\ngovernor. There are six executive departments, namely, justice, finance,\r\ninterior, education, agriculture, and health. The attorney-general and\r\nthe commissioner of education are appointed by the President for a term\r\nof four years; the heads of the other four departments are appointed by\r\nthe governor for the same term. The department heads collectively form\r\nan executive council charged with the performance of such duties as the\r\ngovernor may prescribe.\r\n\r\n_The Legislature._--Formerly the legislature was composed of an upper\r\nhouse, known as the council, the members of which were appointed by the\r\nPresident, and a house of delegates, popularly elected. The act of 1917,\r\nhowever, provided for a legislature, both houses of which are elected by\r\nthe voters. The upper house is called the senate and is composed of\r\nnineteen members, elected for a term of four years. The lower chamber,\r\ncalled the House of Representatives, consists of thirty-nine members,\r\nelected for a term of four years. The legislature is required to meet\r\nbiennially and the governor may call extraordinary sessions. Laws vetoed\r\nby the governor and passed over his veto by the legislature must be\r\ntransmitted to the President for his approval or disapproval. All acts\r\nof the legislature are required to be laid before Congress which may\r\nannul the same. To prevent deadlocks in the administration of the\r\ngovernment, as several times happened in former years, the law provides\r\nthat whenever the appropriation bills for the support of the government\r\nfail of passage the amount appropriated for the past year shall be\r\nconsidered to have been appropriated for the ensuing fiscal year.\r\n\r\n_Suffrage and Citizenship._--Practically all citizens over twenty-one\r\nyears of age who can read and write are qualified voters. Formerly a\r\nsource of complaint among the inhabitants was that they were denied the\r\nstatus of United States citizenship. They were designated as citizens of\r\nPorto Rico and were entitled to be protected by the United States and\r\nwere eligible to receive passports for travel abroad, but they were not\r\ncitizens of the United States. The law of 1917, however, removed this\r\ngrievance by providing that all citizens of Porto Rico should be deemed\r\nto be citizens of the United States. The act also contains an elaborate\r\nbill of rights similar to those in the state constitutions.\r\n\r\n_Judiciary._--The elaborate system of Spanish courts and the Spanish\r\nlegal system generally have been done away with, and in their place a\r\nsystem of law and procedure and a judicial system modeled upon those of\r\nthe American states have been substituted. There is a supreme court\r\nconsisting of five judges appointed for life by the President, and of\r\nthese, three are Porto Ricans and two Americans. Below this court are a\r\nnumber of district courts each of which is presided over by one judge\r\nappointed by the governor with the consent of the council for a term of\r\nfour years. There are also twenty-four municipal courts, and in the\r\nseveral towns there are courts held by the justices of the peace. The\r\nact of 1917 provided for the establishment of a District Court of the\r\nUnited States for the island.\r\n\r\n_Resident Commissioner at Washington._--The interests of the island are\r\nlooked after at Washington by a resident commissioner who is elected by\r\nthe qualified voters for a term of four years. Unlike the delegate from\r\nan organized territory he has no right to a seat in the house of\r\nrepresentatives, but the house has granted him the courtesy of this\r\nprivilege. He is, however, entitled to official recognition by all the\r\nexecutive departments whenever he wishes to discuss with them matters of\r\nbusiness affecting Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe island has its own internal revenue system for raising taxes, and\r\nthe receipts from all customs duties on goods imported into the island\r\nare turned into the insular treasury. Unlike the Philippines, however,\r\nthe island does not have its own monetary system, but uses that of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n=The Philippines.=--The problem of governing the Philippines has proved\r\nmuch more difficult than that of governing Porto Rico. Instead of a\r\nsingle island inhabited by a fairly homogeneous population, the\r\nPhilippine archipelago consists of several hundred islands inhabited by\r\nvarious races and peoples representing almost every stage of development\r\nfrom savagery to fairly complete civilization. It has been a difficult\r\nproblem to develop a system of government adapted to the needs and\r\ncapacities of so many different elements. In addition to the\r\ndifficulties presented by these conditions, the Filipinos in various\r\nparts of the archipelago have resisted American rule, and no small\r\namount of effort and expenditure of money has been directed toward the\r\nsuppression of outbreaks and the maintenance of order.\r\n\r\n_Organic Act of 1902._--In 1902 Congress passed an organic act for the\r\ngovernment of the islands, and shortly thereafter William H. Taft was\r\ninaugurated civil governor. This act continued for the most part the\r\nform of government that had been created by the Philippine Commission.\r\nThe organic act provided, however, that as soon as the insurrection then\r\nexisting was suppressed, a census of the inhabitants should be taken and\r\nif the islands were in a state of peace, steps should be taken toward\r\nthe establishment of a legislative assembly, the lower house of which\r\nshould be popularly elected. This provision was duly carried out, and in\r\n1907 the assembly was chosen. The upper house was a commission of nine\r\nmembers, including the governor, appointed by the President; and members\r\nof the commission also served as heads of executive departments.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the government was altered by abolishing the commission and\r\ncreating a legislature in which both houses are elective. The governor\r\ngeneral, at the head of the executive department, is appointed by the\r\nPresident, as are also the vice governor and the auditor. Acts of the\r\nPhilippine legislature may be vetoed by the governor general (or finally\r\nby the President if passed over the governor general's veto), or may be\r\nannulled by Congress. The act of 1916 declared it to be the purpose of\r\nthe United States to grant the Philippines independence as soon as a\r\nstable government can be established therein.\r\n\r\n_Resident Commissioners._--The legislature is allowed to choose two\r\nresident commissioners to represent the islands at Washington. Like\r\nterritorial delegates, they have seats, but no vote, in the house of\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n_The Judicial System_ of the islands consists of a supreme court of\r\nseven judges who are appointed by the President, a court of first\r\ninstance in each province, the judges of which are appointed by the\r\ngovernor general, and various municipal courts. Unlike Porto Rico and\r\nHawaii, no United States district court has been established in the\r\nislands. Appeals lie from the supreme court of the islands directly to\r\nthe United States Supreme Court in all cases in which the Constitution\r\nor any statute or treaty is involved or in which the amount in\r\ncontroversy exceeds $25,000.\r\n\r\n_Local Government._--Each province is governed in local matters by a\r\nboard consisting of a governor and other officers elected by the voters.\r\nThe organized municipalities are governed by elective councils. Special\r\nprovision has been made for the government of districts inhabited by\r\ncertain non-Christian peoples by the creation of a Bureau of\r\nNon-Christian Tribes.\r\n\r\n=The Unorganized Territories and Dependencies.=--The third group of\r\nterritories or dependencies embrace those which have no legislative\r\nassembly whatever. These include Samoan Islands, Virgin Islands, Guam,\r\nthe Panama Canal Zone, and the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe American _Samoan Islands_, the chief of which is Tutuila with its\r\nvaluable harbor of Pagopago, are governed by a naval officer--the\r\ncommandant of the naval station at Tutuila. He makes the laws and\r\nregulations, and sees that they are enforced, but so far as possible the\r\ninhabitants are allowed to govern themselves.\r\n\r\nBy treaty of 1916, three of the _Virgin Islands_ were purchased from\r\nDenmark for $25,000,000. They were placed under the jurisdiction of a\r\ngovernor appointed by the President, but the local laws were kept in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n_Guam_ was seized by the United States during the war with Spain, and\r\nwas retained by the treaty of peace. It is governed by the commandant of\r\nthe naval station.[107]\r\n\r\n    [107] Other insular possessions of the United States are Wake Island,\r\n    Midway or Brooks Island, Howland and Baker Islands, all in the Pacific\r\n    Ocean. They are practically uninhabited and no provision for their\r\n    government has been found necessary.\r\n\r\n_The Panama Canal Zone_ is a strip of land ten miles wide extending from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean across the Isthmus of Panama, and was\r\nacquired by treaty from the Republic of Panama in 1904, upon the payment\r\nof $10,000,000. Soon after the conclusion of the treaty, Congress\r\npassed an act placing the entire government of the Canal Zone in the\r\nhands of the President. The powers of the President prior to 1914 were\r\nexercised through the Isthmian Canal Commission consisting of seven\r\nmembers, with authority to make and enforce all needful rules and\r\nregulations for the government of the Zone and to enact such local\r\nlegislation as might be needed, subject to the condition that it must\r\nnot be inconsistent with the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the\r\nUnited States. In January, 1914, President Wilson, in pursuance of an\r\nact of Congress passed in 1912, issued an order abolishing the\r\ncommission and organizing a system of civil government for the Canal\r\nZone. Colonel George W. Goethals was appointed the first civil governor.\r\n\r\n_The District of Columbia_ is a territory with an area of seventy square\r\nmiles, and was ceded to the United States in 1790 for the site of the\r\nnational capital. The district was administered from 1801 to 1871 under\r\nthe forms of municipal government, that is, by a mayor and council, but\r\nin the latter year Congress vested the government in a governor, a\r\nsecretary, a board of public works, a board of health, and a legislative\r\nassembly. At the same time the district was allowed to send a delegate\r\nto Congress. Largely on account of the extravagance of this government\r\nin under-taking expensive public improvements, Congress in 1874\r\nabolished the whole scheme and established the present system, which\r\nvests practically all governmental powers in the hands of a commission\r\nof three persons appointed by the President. Two of these must be\r\nappointed from civil life and the other must be an officer belonging to\r\nthe engineering corps of the army. This commission has the general\r\ndirection of administrative affairs and the appointment of employees,\r\nand exercises wide powers of a quasi legislative character, such as the\r\nissuing of health and police regulations. The legislature of the\r\ndistrict, however, is the Congress of the United States. In each house\r\nthere is a committee on the District of Columbia to which all bills\r\nrelating to the district are referred, and on one day of each week an\r\nhour is set apart in the house of representatives for the consideration\r\nof such bills. No provision is made for the representation of the\r\ndistrict in Congress, and the inhabitants take no part in presidential\r\nelections.[108] One half the expense of conducting the government of the\r\ndistrict is defrayed out of the national treasury, and the other half is\r\nraised from taxation on private property in the district.\r\n\r\n    [108] This is also true of the other territories and dependencies. The\r\n    organized territories, however, have been allowed to send delegates to\r\n    the national conventions for the nomination of the President and Vice\r\n    President.\r\n\r\nThe judicial establishment of the district consists of a court of\r\nappeals of three judges, a supreme court of six judges, and the usual\r\npolice courts and courts of justices of the peace. (See page 364.)\r\n\r\n=American Protection over Spanish American States.=--In addition to the\r\nownership of the various insular dependencies mentioned above, the\r\nUnited States, in pursuance of a long established policy known as the\r\n\"Monroe Doctrine,\" exercises a certain degree of protection over Latin\r\nAmerican states. As this policy is now interpreted it forbids the\r\nfurther acquisition by European powers of territorial possessions in the\r\nwestern hemisphere, or the extension by such powers of political\r\ninfluence on this continent. By virtue of special treaty arrangements\r\nthe United States exercises a virtual protectorate over certain of the\r\nsmaller Latin American republics. Thus under the \"Platt Amendment,\" to\r\nthe constitution of Cuba (also embodied in a treaty between the United\r\nStates and Cuba) the United States has the right to intervene in Cuba\r\nfor the maintenance of a stable government and for the protection of\r\npublic order and security; and this power was exercised in 1906.\r\nNaturally it exercises the power of protection over the republic of\r\nPanama through whose territory the Panama Canal runs, and recently\r\n(1915) it has established a sort of financial protectorate over Haiti\r\nand the Dominican Republic. In pursuance of treaty arrangements it\r\ncollects the customs revenues in those republics, applies them to the\r\npayment of their foreign debts, and has the right to intervene for the\r\nmaintenance of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--BEARD, American Government and Politics, ch. xxi.\r\n     BRYCE, The American Commonwealth (abridged edition), ch. xlvi.\r\n     HART, Actual Government, ch. xx.

From what clause or clauses in the Constitution is the power to\r\nacquire foreign territory derived?\r\n\r\n2. By what different methods has foreign territory been added to the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\n3. Are there any limitations on the powers of Congress in legislating\r\nfor the territories?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n=Who are Citizens.=--The population of every country is composed of two\r\nclasses of persons: citizens and aliens. The larger portion of the\r\ninhabitants are citizens, but the alien class is considerable in some\r\nstates of the Union, much more so than formerly, owing to the large\r\ninflux of immigrants from Europe in recent years.[109] A citizen is one\r\nwho has been admitted to full membership in the state, though he may not\r\nhave been given full political privileges, such as the privileges of\r\nvoting and holding public office. There is a large class of citizens in\r\nevery state who can neither vote nor hold public office, such, for\r\nexample, as minors, sometimes illiterate persons, those who have not\r\npaid their taxes, those who have been convicted of serious crimes, and\r\nothers. On the other hand, aliens in some states are allowed to vote and\r\nhold office, especially if they have formally declared their intention\r\nof becoming citizens. The terms \"citizen\" and \"voter,\" therefore, are\r\nnot identical, since there are some citizens who cannot vote and some\r\nvoters who are not citizens. (See page 125.)\r\n\r\n    [109] The census of New York of 1910 showed that of a total population\r\n    of 9,000,000 inhabitants there were more than 2,000,000 aliens.\r\n\r\n=How Citizenship is Acquired.=--Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\nfederal Constitution, all persons born in the United States[110] are\r\ncitizens of the United States, and also of the states in which they\r\nreside. Persons who come here from abroad may become citizens only by\r\nbeing naturalized.\r\n\r\n    [110] For some purposes, the residences of foreign diplomatic\r\n    representatives are considered as if belonging to the foreign country\r\n    represented. Thus a child of the French ambassador, if born in the\r\n    ambassador's residence at Washington, is born a citizen of France;\r\n    likewise a child of the United States ambassador at Paris, if born at\r\n    his residence in France, is nevertheless a natural-born citizen of the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n_Naturalization Law._--To acquire citizenship in this way, they must\r\nreside here for a period of five years, they must also be persons of\r\ngood moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution and\r\nwell disposed to the good order and happiness of the same. Under the law\r\nof 1906 they must also be able to write their own language and be able\r\nto read and speak English. Two steps are necessary in the procedure of\r\nnaturalization: first the applicant must go before a federal court or a\r\ncourt of record in some state and make oath that he is at least eighteen\r\nyears of age, and that it is his intention to become a citizen of the\r\nUnited States. At the same time he must renounce all allegiance to the\r\nforeign state of which he is a citizen or subject and must furnish the\r\ncourt with a variety of information concerning his past life, including\r\nthe date of his arrival in the United States and the name of the ship on\r\nwhich he arrived. He is then furnished with a certificate which is\r\npopularly known as his \"first papers.\" When he has resided in the United\r\nStates at least five years and possesses all the necessary\r\nqualifications the court will issue him a certificate of naturalization\r\nwhich makes him a citizen. Fees amounting to five dollars are now\r\ncharged for filing the petition and issuing the final certificate. In\r\norder to prevent the wholesale naturalization of aliens in the large\r\ncities for election purposes, the law provides that no certificate of\r\nnaturalization shall be granted within thirty days prior to any general\r\nelection. Any honorably discharged alien from the United States army may\r\nbe admitted to citizenship after a residence of one year, and the\r\npreliminary declaration of intention is not required of aliens who have\r\nserved five years in the navy.\r\n\r\n_Disqualifications._--In addition to the qualifications mentioned above,\r\nthere are certain disqualifications which serve to debar many foreigners\r\nfrom acquiring American citizenship. Thus only white persons and persons\r\nof African nativity are capable of being naturalized under our laws, so\r\nthat those belonging to the Mongolian or other races, such as Chinese,\r\nJapanese, Burmese, and East Indians, cannot become citizens of the\r\nUnited States unless born here. Other persons excluded for different\r\nreasons are polygamists, anarchists, and certain other classes of\r\ncriminals who are not considered worthy to enjoy the high privileges of\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nThe naturalization of a husband makes the wife and minor children\r\ncitizens, so that they do not have to go through the process of taking\r\nout their \"papers.\"\r\n\r\n_Other Methods of Acquiring Citizenship._--Citizenship may be acquired\r\nsometimes in other ways than the method described above. Thus a foreign\r\nwoman becomes a citizen by marriage to an American citizen, and the\r\ninhabitants of foreign territory annexed to the United States become\r\ncitizens by virtue of their incorporation into the body politic. In this\r\nway the inhabitants of the Louisiana territory, acquired from France,\r\nbecame citizens. In the same way those of Florida, Texas, California,\r\nAlaska, and Hawaii became citizens, but not those of Porto Rico and the\r\nPhilippines. Residents of Porto Rico, however, were made citizens of the\r\nUnited States by act of Congress in 1917.\r\n\r\n=How Citizenship may be Lost.=--As citizenship may be acquired in\r\nvarious ways so it may be lost by different acts. An American woman\r\nloses her citizenship by marriage to an alien. Acceptance of a\r\ncommission in the service of a foreign country; if it involves the\r\ntaking of an oath of allegiance to a foreign government, operates to\r\ndivest one of his American citizenship. The most common mode by which\r\ncitizenship is lost, however, is through voluntary removal from the\r\ncountry and naturalization in a foreign state. The right of the citizen\r\nto withdraw from the United States, renounce his allegiance, and acquire\r\nthe citizenship of a foreign state, is declared by our law to be an\r\ninalienable right. Mere removal from the United States and the\r\nestablishment of a residence in a foreign country, however, does not of\r\nitself operate to divest one of his citizenship. An American citizen may\r\nreside abroad many years for the purposes of business, education, or\r\npleasure, and so long as he preserves an intention of returning to the\r\nUnited States he is not held to have abandoned his American nationality.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent foreigners from coming to the United States,\r\nacquiring our citizenship, and returning to their native country for the\r\npurpose of living there without being subject to the burdens and\r\nobligations of military service, the law declares that a naturalized\r\nAmerican who returns to his native country and resides there for a\r\nperiod of two years will be presumed to have abandoned his American\r\ncitizenship, and unless he can show an intention of returning to America\r\nhe will be considered as no longer being a citizen.\r\n\r\n=Federal versus State Citizenship.=--In a country having the federal\r\nform of government, the inhabitants have a dual citizenship, that is,\r\nthey are citizens of the country as a whole and of the particular state\r\nin which they are residents. Thus our federal Constitution declares that\r\nall persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the\r\njurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the state\r\nin which they reside. A person, however, may be a citizen of the United\r\nStates without at the same time being a citizen of any state, as is the\r\ncase with those inhabiting the territories, the District of Columbia,\r\nand other places not forming a part of any state. On the contrary, it\r\nseems to be generally admitted that one may be a citizen of a state\r\nwithout necessarily being a citizen of the United States. Thus a state\r\nmay give an alien full political and civil rights and declare him to be\r\na citizen of the state before he has become a citizen of the United\r\nStates. Some states have in effect done this. It follows, therefore,\r\nthat federal and state citizenship are not necessarily identical and\r\ncoexistent, since there may be a class of state citizens upon whom the\r\nUnited States has not conferred its own citizenship, and a class of\r\nUnited States citizens who are not citizens of any state. The\r\ncitizenship of a particular state may be relinquished for that of\r\nanother by removal from the former state and the establishment of a\r\nresidence in the latter. No legal formality whatever is required to put\r\noff the one and take on the other.\r\n\r\n_Interstate Rights of Citizens._--There is a provision in the\r\nConstitution of the United States which declares that the citizens of\r\neach state shall enjoy all the privileges and immunities of the citizens\r\nof the several states. The purpose of this provision is to prevent one\r\nstate from discriminating against the citizens of other states in favor\r\nof its own citizens. Whatever rights and privileges it accords to its\r\nown citizens must be accorded equally to citizens of other states who\r\nmay be within its borders or who may wish to carry on business therein.\r\nThe states are also forbidden by the federal Constitution to abridge the\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, though the\r\nConstitution does not specify or indicate what these privileges and\r\nimmunities are. They include, however, such privileges as the making and\r\nenforcing of contracts, of suing in the courts, of inheriting, holding,\r\nand conveying property, of receiving equal protection of the laws, and,\r\nin general, of enjoying every right or privilege to which the citizen is\r\nentitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\n=Rights and Duties of Aliens.=--Aliens, though in a political sense\r\nmembers of foreign states, are, nevertheless, fully subject to the\r\njurisdiction of the state in which they are domiciled, and owe it a\r\ntemporary allegiance. They are bound to obey the laws equally with\r\ncitizens, and may be punished for violations of them equally with\r\ncitizens. They must also share, to a certain extent, the public burdens,\r\nand may be required to serve in the militia or police (though not in the\r\nregular army) if the common defense and domestic safety require their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n_Right of Protection._--It is now universally admitted that they are\r\nentitled to the protection of the government under which they are living\r\nso long as they are within its jurisdiction, but not when they go\r\nabroad. So far as the enjoyment of civil rights is concerned, the\r\ntendency is to treat them on a footing of equality with citizens. Both\r\nthe federal and the state courts are open to them on the same terms as\r\nto citizens, and if they suffer injuries in the course of riots and\r\nother disturbances, because of their foreign nationality, especially if\r\nthe public authorities fail to use due diligence to prevent or punish\r\nattacks upon them, the United States government will indemnify them or\r\ntheir heirs for the injuries sustained.[111]\r\n\r\n    [111] The United States government has uniformly refused to admit its\r\n    liability in such cases, but it has in practice generally allowed an\r\n    indemnity. This was done, for example, in the case of the Anti-Spanish\r\n    riots in New Orleans and Key West in 1851; in the case of the\r\n    Anti-Chinese riots at Rock Springs, Wyoming, in 1885; and in the case\r\n    of the Italian lynchings at New Orleans in 1891.\r\n\r\n_Disabilities of Aliens._--Formerly aliens were subject to disabilities\r\nmuch more commonly than now. Under the common law, for example, they\r\ncould not inherit land, but this disability has been abolished in most\r\nof the states, though some still make a distinction between resident and\r\nnonresident aliens in this respect, allowing the former class to take\r\nland by inheritance as well as by purchase but excluding the latter\r\nclass. Some states do not allow them to be employed on the public works,\r\nand a few subject them to other disabilities, but they are not important\r\nor numerous.[112] With regard to political privileges, however, the\r\ndisabilities of aliens are still generally maintained.\r\n\r\n    [112] In 1915 the Federal Courts held unconstitutional a law of Arizona\r\n    which forbade the employment of more than 20 per cent of aliens in any\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n=Rights and Obligations of Citizens.=--The chief privilege of\r\ncitizenship is that of protection by the government in all personal and\r\nproperty rights. If the citizen goes abroad for the purpose of business\r\nor pleasure, the government will protect him from wrongful treatment so\r\nlong as he obeys the law of the country to which he is, for the time\r\nbeing, subject, and demeans himself peaceably. If he is injured or\r\ndiscriminated against because of his foreign nationality, the government\r\nwhich fails to protect him will be required to make a suitable indemnity\r\nfor the injury.\r\n\r\n_Equality of Native and Naturalized Citizens._--When it comes to\r\nprotecting its citizens abroad, the United States government makes no\r\ndistinction between naturalized and native-born citizens. In the case of\r\na Russian, for example, who comes to America and is naturalized and goes\r\nback to Russia for business or pleasure, our government will insist that\r\nhe be treated by the Russian authorities as if he were a native-born\r\nAmerican citizen. At home a naturalized citizen enjoys the same\r\nprivileges as a native-born except that he is not eligible to the office\r\nof President or Vice President of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Duties and Obligations of Citizens._--Rights and privileges seldom\r\nexist without corresponding duties and obligations, and so citizenship\r\nhas its duties. One of these is to contribute to the bearing of the\r\nburdens of the state. This includes the payment of taxes, service in the\r\nmilitia or army for purposes of defense, and the discharge of such\r\npublic trusts as may be imposed. It is, of course, the duty of the\r\ncitizen, as it is of every one who lives in the state, to obey the laws\r\nand do what he can to secure their enforcement. Finally, if the citizen\r\npossesses political privileges, it is his duty to take an active part in\r\nsecuring the election of competent and honest officials to the end that\r\nthe government which protects him may be efficient and well\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\n=Obligations and Duties of Nations: International Law.=--Nations, like\r\nindividuals, are bound by rules of conduct in their relations with one\r\nanother. The rules governing nations constitute what is known as\r\ninternational law, a subject of which we have heard much since the\r\noutbreak of the great world war in 1914. The rules of international law,\r\nunlike those of national or municipal law, are not enacted by a\r\nlegislative body, for as yet, unfortunately, there is no world\r\nlegislature. They consist partly of customary rules and usages, and\r\npartly of international treaties. The most important of these treaties\r\nare those negotiated to end the World War, and also the so-called\r\nconventions, sixteen in number, recommended by the Peace Conferences at\r\nthe Hague in 1899 and 1907, and adopted, for the most part, by nearly\r\nall the civilized nations of the world. These conventions contain a\r\nlarge number of important rules prescribing the conduct to be observed\r\nby nations both in time of war and in time of peace.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, international law has one great weakness which\r\nnational law does not have. National law has what the lawyers call a\r\nsanction; that is to say, a penalty is prescribed for its violation, and\r\ncourts are established for punishing those who violate its rules. But in\r\nthe case of international law there is as yet no machinery for bringing\r\nto the bar of justice and inflicting punishment upon a nation which\r\nviolates its international duties and obligations, except as the League\r\nof Nations may succeed in performing this function. The only punishment\r\nwhich has often followed such an act is the reprobation of public\r\nopinion, which unhappily, as the World War has demonstrated, is not a\r\nsufficient deterrent in the case of nations which regard lightly their\r\nobligations of honor and good faith. Thinking men the world over realize\r\nhow important it is to make international law more effective, to compel\r\nnations by force or otherwise to observe their international\r\nobligations, and to prevent war, the world's greatest curse.\r\n\r\n\r\n     =References.=--ASHLEY, The American Federal State, ch. xxix; also pp.\r\n     212-217.

Distinguish between native-born and naturalized\r\ncitizens; between citizens and electors.\r\n\r\n2. Is the citizenship of a child determined by the law of the place\r\nwhere it is born or by the law of the place of which the parents are\r\ncitizens? Distinguish between the English and American practice in this\r\nrespect, on the one hand, and the continental European practice on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n3. What would be the citizenship of a child born in the United States if\r\nthe father were the ambassador of a foreign country, temporarily\r\nresiding here? What would be the citizenship of a child born of American\r\nparents on the high seas? of a child born abroad of American parents? of\r\na child born in the United States if the father were a foreign consul\r\nhere?\r\n\r\n4. A child born in the United States of French parents would be a\r\ncitizen of the United States under our law; it would also be a citizen\r\nof France, according to French law. Which citizenship would prevail?\r\n\r\n5. Do you think our law should admit persons of African descent to\r\nbecome citizens and yet deny the right to Japanese, Chinese, and natives\r\nof India?\r\n\r\n6. May one be a citizen of two different countries at the same time?\r\n\r\n7. What would be the status of an American woman who lost her American\r\ncitizenship by marrying a foreigner, in case of the death of her\r\nhusband? How could she reacquire her original citizenship?\r\n\r\n8. How long may an American reside abroad without losing his\r\ncitizenship?\r\n\r\n9. Many Europeans, in order to escape military service in their country,\r\nhave emigrated to America, acquired our citizenship and returned to\r\ntheir native country. Will the United States government protect such\r\npersons against impressment into the military service?\r\n\r\n10. Suppose a citizen of New York moves to Pennsylvania and establishes\r\na residence there. Does that act without any legal formality make him a\r\ncitizen of Pennsylvania?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION\r\n\r\n\r\n     ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION AND PERPETUAL UNION BETWEEN THE STATES OF\r\n       NEW HAMPSHIRE, MASSACHUSETTS BAY, RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE\r\n       PLANTATIONS, CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA,\r\n       DELAWARE, MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND\r\n       GEORGIA\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.--The style of this confederacy shall be, \"The United States\r\nof America.\"\r\n\r\nART.
